About the Author
Greg Harvey has authored tons of computer books, the most recent being
Excel 2003 For Dummies and Adobe Acrobat 6 PDF For Dummies. He started
out training business users on how to use IBM personal computers and their
attendant computer software in the rough and tumble days of DOS, WordStar,
and Lotus 1-2-3 in the mid-80s of the last century. After working for a number
of independent training firms, he went on to teach semester-long courses in
spreadsheet and database management software at Golden Gate University in
San Francisco.
His love of teaching has translated into an equal love of writing. For Dummies
books are, of course, his all-time favorites to write because they enable him
to write to his favorite audience, the beginner. They also enable him to use
humor (a key element to success in the training room) and, most delightful 
of all, to express an opinion or two about the subject matter at hand.


Dedication
To Chris — my partner and helpmate in all aspects of my life
Author’s Acknowledgments
I’m always very grateful to the many people who work so hard to bring my
book projects into being, and this one is no exception. This time, preliminary
thanks are in order to Andy Cummings and Tiffany Franklin for giving me
this opportunity to write about Roxio’s great new suite of media creation
programs.
Next, I want to express great thanks to my project editor, Christine Berman
(a better person to work with you’ll never find), and to my partner in crime,
Christopher Aiken (I really appreciate all your editing, additions, and com-
ments on this one). Thanks also go to Mark Chambers for the great technical
edit, Adrienne Martinez for coordinating its production, and everybody at
Wiley Publishing and TECHBOOKS Production Services for proofreading and

Special thanks to Chris Taylor, Product Market Manager at Roxio, for all his
personal help and encouragement as well as to his staff and support person-
nel for their speedy responses to my few questions about this great version
of their most versatile software.

Foreword
W
ith Roxio Easy Media Creator For Dummies, Greg Harvey has put
together a comprehensive overview of our software.  In true For
Dummies style, the book is written in plain language, logically arranged, 
and has an upbeat, entertaining tone that I believe you will enjoy.  
Maybe you bought Creator 7 to accompany your new DVD burner, digital
camera, or DV camcorder.  Or perhaps you picked it up because you have a
special project to complete such as archiving treasured family photos to CD,
creating an engaging slideshow of your daughter’s wedding, or producing an
MP3 disc of your favorite Liberace tunes.  Regardless of your endeavor, what
you will quickly discover — if you haven’t already — is that Creator 7 can
perform, and perform well, any and all media tasks you throw at it.
What you’ve purchased represents the realization of Roxio’s vision to bring
together its complete line of next generation, uncompromised photo, video,
music, burning, and authoring applications to deliver the first and only com-
prehensive, integrated digital media suite for the PC.  Seamlessly combining
the improved burning suite of Easy CD & DVD Creator, with best-of-breed
PhotoSuite® 7 Platinum, VideoWave® 7 Professional, and online music service
Napster®, Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 will enable you to take full command of
your digital life.  
On behalf of the staff of Roxio who worked so diligently to deliver Easy Media
Creator 7, I’d like to wish you well as you begin to fully explore the wonderful
world of digital media.  
Chris Taylor
Product Marketing Manager, Roxio


Introduction
T
he good news is that Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 really lives up to its
name by being genuinely easy to use. The bad news, if there is any, is that
because of its nature as a collection or suite of different applications and
tools, you may initially find it a bit confusing as to which part to turn to get 
a particular job done. This is where Roxio Easy Media Creator For Dummies
comes in. This book is designed to make you familiar with Roxio Easy Media
Creator’s many capabilities and get you up and running and comfortable with
its many features as quickly as possible.
If I had to choose just one word to characterize Easy Media Creator 7, it
would have to be versatility because this baby can do almost anything you
might want to do with the audio, photo, and video media that you collect.
With Easy Media Creator, you can go from capturing original digital media to
editing it and then using it in a wide array of different projects that you can
then output to disc in a very short time. Because the program’s emphasis is
always on making these processes as easy as can be, you don’t have to worry
if you don’t have any background in working with digital media and have lim-
ited or even no experience with multimedia editing and design.
I just hope that you find using Easy Media Creator to design, build, and burn
your own media projects half as much fun I found writing about them in this
book. I want to congratulate the Roxio engineers for providing all of us with a
truly outstanding set of tools with which to transform the sounds and images
of the world around us into memories that we can share with friends and
family alike.
About This Book
Roxio Easy Media Creator For Dummies is meant to be a simple reference to
the major components and features that its many components offer. I have,
however, endeavored as much as possible to arrange this reference material
according to the task you want to get done rather than according to the
module that you use in performing it (as you sometimes use the same module
to accomplish multiple tasks). This means that although the chapters in each
part are laid in a logical order, each stands on its own, ready for you to dig
into the information at any point. 

Whenever I could, I have also tried to make the topics within each chapter
stand on their own as well. When there’s just no way around relying upon
some information that’s discussed elsewhere, I include a cross-reference that
gives you the chapter and verse (actually the chapter and section) for where
you can find that related information if you’re of a mind to. 
Use the Contents at a Glance along with the full Table of Contents and Index
to look up the topic of the hour and find out exactly where it is in this compi-
lation of Easy Media Creator information. You’ll find that although most
topics are introduced in a conversational manner, I don’t waste much time
cutting to the chase by laying down the main principles at work (usually in
bulleted form) followed by the hard reality of how you do the deed (as num-
bered steps).
Foolish Assumptions
I’m going to make only one foolish assumption about you and that is that you
have the means to acquire some sort of digital media (be that audio, photos,
or video) and you now want to be able to something with that media (be that
burn the audio into CDs, use the photos in collages, or create video produc-
tions that you can view in your DVD player). I’m not assuming that you have
any experience in creating any of the kinds of projects you’d like to create
with your digital media, so you don’t have to be concerned about your level
of multimedia expertise (or the lack thereof).
As far as your computer hardware and software goes, I’m assuming only
that you have a computer that is robust enough to meet the rather stringent
memory and storage requirements for Easy Media Creator 7and that this
machine is running Windows 2000 or XP and is equipped with a CD-recordable
or, hopefully, a DVD-recordable drive. I am not, however, assuming that you
have access to the other peripherals such as a digital still camera, camcorder,
scanner, DVD recorder, and the like that I describe in the text. If you do have
all these goodies, so much the better, as this enables you to use all of Easy
Media Creator’s wonderful features. If not, you can still use the parts of the
program that pertain to kind of system you have.
How This Book Is Organized
Roxio Easy Media Creator For Dummies is divided into five parts (giving rise
to five of Rich Tennant’s great cartoons). Each part is organized around a
2
Roxio Easy Media Creator For Dummies 

central topic (getting to know Easy Media Creator and digital media, making
data backup discs, audio discs and photo projects, DVD projects, and the
like). All the chapters in each part are then related to some aspect of per-
forming the central task. In case you’re the least bit curious, here’s the low-
down on each of the parts and their chapters and what you can expect to
find there.
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator
and Digital Media
This part provides you with an orientation to Easy Media Creator 7’s compo-
nents and capabilities, along with an introduction to the sometimes confusing
world of digital media. 
Chapter 1 is your place to go to find out just what exactly is included in the
Easy Media Creator suite. It also introduces you to the Easy Media Creator
Home, the central bridge from which you can access all the other applica-
tions and tools in the suite.
Chapter 2 is not to be missed, even by those of you who do not consider
yourselves beginners by any stretch of the imagination. This chapter covers
the world of digital media, including the essential difference between analog
and digital media, the many different types of CD and DVD media and media
formats out there, as well as the different types of digital gear that Easy
Media Creator supports. The chapter ends with Greg’s advice on the proper
treatment of CD and DVD discs.
Part II: Creating Data Discs
Part II focuses on the important tasks of backing up and organizing your
media files. Chapter 3 takes up the call on how to use the Creator Classic
module to compile and burn data backup discs. This chapter also includes
information on how to use Creator Classic to schedule backups so that you’re
never at risk for losing invaluable data due to some computer malfunction.
Chapter 4 covers how to use the Media Manager module to organize, manage,
and backup all the different types of media files (audio, still images, and video)
that you use in your Easy Media Creator media projects. It covers tagging and
annotating media files for quick retrieval later using Media Manager’s Search
capability and concludes with instructions on how to back up media files by
burning them onto CD and DVD discs.

Introduction

Part III: Creating Audio CDs
and Photo Projects
This part takes an in-depth look at two of the most popular types of digital
media out there: digital audio and photos. Chapter 5 covers recording and
editing digital audio with Easy Media Creator’s powerful Sound Editor.
Chapter 6 turns to the subject of digital photos and how you can use the
PhotoSuite module not only to fix, edit, and enhance them but also to use
them in all sorts of great photo projects including slideshows, photo collages,
calendars, and the like. It concludes by giving you the lowdown on printing
your digital photos as well as sharing them electronically with friends and
family.
Chapters 7 and 8 give you the blow-by-blow for compiling and burning audio
CDs and MP3 discs with Creator Classic and then using Label Creator to
design and print labels for the discs and inserts for their jewel cases.
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs
Part IV is devoted to the subject of DVD projects. Chapter 9 concentrates on
how to use the Capture tool to acquire all the types of digital media (audio,
photo, and video) that you need for your DVD projects. 
Chapter 10 then covers the use of Easy Media Creator’s powerful VideoWave
module to design video productions to be used as titles for your DVD pro-
jects. Chapter 11 fills out the part by giving you the lowdown on using the
DVD Builder module to construct the titles for your DVD project complete
with interactive menus and then burn the finished project to CD or DVD disc.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Part V contains chapters that make up the Part of Tens. Chapter 12 is the
place to consult for a concise description of what each major application and
tool in the Easy Media Creator suite can do for you. This chapter also gives
cross references to the appropriate chapters in the book that give you in-
depth information on the use of a particular module.

Roxio Easy Media Creator For Dummies 

Chapter 13 highlights what I consider to be the top ten coolest features in the
entire Easy Media Creator suite (and, of course, that’s saying a lot when you
have as many features to choose from as you do with this baby).
Icons Used in This Book
The following icons are strategically placed in the margins throughout all the
chapters in this book. Their purpose is to get your attention and each has its
own way of doing that.
This icon denotes some really cool information (in my humble opinion) that
if you pay particular attention to will pay off by making your work just a lot
more enjoyable or productive (or both).
This icon denotes a tidbit that you ought to pay extra attention to; otherwise,
you may end up taking a detour that wastes valuable time.

You may want to skip these sections (or, at least, read them when no one else
is around).
Where to Go from Here
The question of where to go from here couldn’t be simpler — why off to read
the great Rich Tennant cartoons at the beginning of each of the four parts, of
course. Which chapter you go to after that is a matter of personal interest
and need. Just go for the gold and don’t forget to have some fun while you’re

A Bit about Easy
Media Creator and
Digital Media

In this part . . .
E
asy Media Creator, as you discover in this part, is not
one single program but a collection or suite of several
different application programs and tools that you can use
to create a wide variety of audio, photo, and video projects.
In Chapter 1 of this part, you get introduced to each of the
programs and tools you’ll be using and what they can do
for you. Chapter 2 then presents essential information
about the surplus of digital media and media file formats
that you come in contact with as you create your various
media projects. This chapter then concludes by giving
you a rundown of the various pieces of cool digital gear
you can use to play all the great projects you come up
with in Easy Media Creator, and guidelines on the proper
care of CDs and DVDs.

F
irst things first: Before you can use your newly installed Roxio Easy
Media Creator 7 to go off and create a copy of your favorite Norah
Jones audio CD or to burn a DVD of the family’s most recent outing in the
Adirondacks, you’re going to need to know your way around the program. As
you’re about to discover, there’s very little that Roxio Easy Media Creator 7
can’t do when it comes to dealing with all the many types of digital media
that are apt to come your way. 
Better yet, not only is this baby versatile but it’s as good as its name. The
Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 offers you consistently easy ways to complete all
of your media projects — from ripping, arranging, and burning your own
copies of your favorite CDs to finally organizing and tagging those gazillions
of digital photos you’ve dumped into nondescript folders all over your com-
puter’s hard disk.
The only catch (oh, there’s always a catch) is that in order for the Easy Media
Creator to be as multitalented as it is, the good engineers at Roxio had to carve
the program up into dozens of different little specialized programs and utili-
ties that taken in at once can be a bit overwhelming (to say the least). This is
where Chapter 1 comes in: Here you not only get a much needed overview of
the many individual and specialized components now at your fingertips but a
good feel for the Easy Media Creator Home that ties them all together. Once
you get your bearings in this all important hub, you’re ready to see what this
program can really do by looking at each of the individual components.

Welcome to the Easy Media
Creator Home
At the time you install the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 on your computer’s
hard disk, the Windows Installer automatically puts a Roxio Easy Media
Creator Home shortcut on the Windows desktop. To open the Easy Media
Creator Home, you simply locate this shortcut icon (shown in the left margin
of this paragraph) and double-click it.
Figure 1-1 shows the Easy Media Creator Home window that appears after you
double-click this desktop shortcut. As you can see in this figure, the Home
window that forms the hub of the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 is divided into
four distinct areas, each of which is labeled. Here’s the lowdown on each of
these areas:
 Tasks: This area, divided into the subsections: Music, Data, Photo,
Video, and DVD, enables you to launch a particular Easy Media Creator
program or tool by clicking the task you want to accomplish such as
Copy Audio CD or Capture Video
 Applications: Lists all the programs that you can launch to accomplish
the many things listed in the Tasks section
 Tools: Lists all the special tools and utilities that are available to you in
the Easy Media Creator 7 suite
 Recent Projects: Contains a chronological list of any of the audio or
video projects that you’ve been working on (this area is blank when you
first open the Easy Media Creator Home window) 
Note that you can condense parts of the Easy Media Creator Home window
by hiding the display of any of its three horizontal bands (the Applications
and Tools sections are lumped together as part of the horizontal band that
contains the full product name: Roxio Easy Media Creator 7, The Digital
Media Suite). You do this by clicking the any of the three buttons with the
two upward-pointing arrowheads (one on top of the other) that appear at 
the far right of each band. When you click one of these buttons, the detailed
information beneath its band is hidden and the button changes to one with
two downward-pointing arrowheads (which you can click to expand the sec-
tion and redisplay its details).
If you really want to make it easy to open the Easy Media Creator Home, you
can add this Home shortcut to the Windows Quick Launch toolbar by drag-
ging its icon to this bar and dropping it at the place on this toolbar that
immediately follows the Start button on the Windows taskbar. 
10
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

If you’re like me and are apt to become a really serious user of Easy Media
Creator, you may also want to fix the Easy Media Creator Home option on the
Windows Start menu. To do this, you follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Easy Media Creator Home shortcut on the desktop.
If you don’t have an Easy Media Creator Home shortcut on your desk-
top, you can click the Start button on the Windows taskbar, mouse over
the All Programs option on the Start menu, the Roxio option on the All
Programs menu, and then click Roxio Easy Media Creator Home option
on the Roxio submenu. 
The Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 Home shown in Figure 1-1 then opens.
2. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar to open the Start menu.
The Roxio Easy Media Creator Home option now appears on the left side
of the Windows Start menu.
3. Right-click the Roxio Easy Media Creator Home option to open its short-
cut menu and then click the Pin to Start Menu option on this menu.
As soon as you click the Pin to Start Menu option, Windows moves the Roxio
Easy Media Creator Home option to the upper area of the left side of the Start
Figure 1-1:

Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 7

menu (under such Start menu stalwarts as the Internet Explorer and Outlook
Express). If you later decide that you don’t need this option to be a perma-
nent part of the Start menu, you can remove it by right-clicking the option
and then clicking the Unpin from Start Menu option on its shortcut menu.
Attending to the Tasks at Hand
The Tasks section at the top of the Roxio Easy Media Creator Home window
(see Figure 1-1) divides the many things that you routinely want to accomplish
with the program into five distinct task areas: Music, Data, Photo, Video, and
DVD. Each task area contains a list of the most common tasks associated with
that area and each task listing is a hyperlink (just on a Web page).
Clicking the link associated with a particular task opens the appropriate
application for accomplishing that task. The beauty of the Tasks section in
the Home window is that you don’t have to give a second thought as to which
Easy Media Creator application to use in order to get done the project you
have in mind. 
The only problem is that the tasks displayed in each of the five task areas
represent only the most common things that you can do with Roxio Easy
Media Creator 7. Although you can rely on the Tasks section for most of your
media projects, be aware that not everything that you may need to do with
the program is listed here. Therefore, you will not want to ignore totally the
options listed in the Application and Tools areas.
My suggestion is that when you first start using the program, concentrate on
using the items listed in the Tasks section of the Easy Media Creator Home
window to get your work done. That way, as your experience with the pro-
gram grows, you’ll naturally become familiar with which applications are
associated with which types of media tasks. In no time at all, especially with
the help of the information in this book, you’ll pick up on which application
or tool to launch in order to complete a particular media project.
Acclimating to the Many Applications 
The applications listed in the Application area of the Easy Media Creator
Home window form the core of the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 program. As
you see in the center section of the window shown in Figure 1-1, this list
includes these seven: Disc Copier, Creator Classic, PhotoSuite, DVD Builder,
VideoWave, Drag-to-Disc, and Napster. Although this area of the window
refers to them as applications (a technical term for a program that enables
12
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

the user to create certain types of documents saved in individual file for-
mats), you will find that the program and documentation also refers to these
guys as “components” because they are just parts of the whole Media Suite.
A good example of this is when you click an Applications link such as Creator
Classic, an alert box appears with the following message: “Please wait . . .
Loading component.”
The following seven sections give you a brief introduction to each of the com-
ponents that you can load by clicking its Applications link in the Easy Media
Creator Home. Use this information to get a quick overview of the capabilities
and functions of each of Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 applications.
Copying discs with Disc Copier
As the name says, Disc Copier is the application you use when you need to
make a copy of an unprotected CD or DVD. When you click the Disc Copier
link in the Applications area in the Easy Media Creator Home window, the
program opens the window shown in Figure 1-2. Or, I should say, this window
opens after you dismiss an alert dialog box reminding you that you should use
the Disc Copier component only to make copies of digital media for which
you have the clear legal right to make copies. Knowing that none of you would
ever do anything like that, you can click the Don’t Show Me This Again check
box before you click OK to close this alert dialog box (for once and all).
You can use Disc Copier to copy an audio or data CD or DVD (usually one
that you’ve created with Roxio’s DVD Builder, since almost every single com-
mercial movie on DVD that you rent or purchase is copy-protected and can’t
be copied with Disc Copier). As you can see in Figure 1-2, all you need to do
to copy one of these discs is to specify the source and destination drive. The
great thing is, if your situation is like mine and you have only one CD or DVD
drive on your computer system, you can still use Disc Copier to copy your
audio, data, or video discs (refer to Chapters 3 and 5 for steps with concrete
examples of how you use Disc Copier to copy audio and data CDs).

13
Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 7

The comforts of Creator Classic
Creator Classic is the application you use primarily to assemble and burn
your audio and data CDs. Figure 1-3 shows you the window that opens when
you click the Creator Classic link in the Applications area of the Easy Media
Creator Home. As you can see in this figure, the Creator Classic window is
divided into three major areas:
 Tasks where you select the type of disc to burn to CD (Data Disc, Audio,
or MP3 Disc) and where you can indicate what type of CD to create
(Enhanced, Mixed-Mode, or Bootable)
 Select Source where you locate and select the files you want to copy to
data or audio CD
 Data Disc Project which displays the name of your project as well as all
the files you’ve added for burning onto the CD
Whereas you can use Disc Copier to make a copy of an existing audio or data
CD or DVD, you use Creator Classic to actually put together and burn your
own audio CDs or data CDs or DVDs. You use Creator Classic when you want
to make backups or archive data files on your disk. You can also use Creator
Classic to burn audio CDs that you can play in your computer’s CD or DVD
drive or in any standard CD player that you have handy. If you have audio
tracks saved on your hard disk in the more-and-more popular MP3 audio file
format, you can also burn them as an MP3 disc that you can play in most CD
computer drives. See Chapters 3, 5, and 6 for specific information and exam-
ples on using Creator Classic to assemble and burn audio and data CDs.

Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

Picture it in PhotoSuite
PhotoSuite is the application that you use to organize, edit, and share the 
digital photos that you take. You can use this component to enhance the
photos, organize them into albums, use them in creating projects like greet-
ing cards and calendars, as well as easily share them with friends and family.
Figure 1-4 shows you the basic PhotoSuite window that appears when you
click the PhotoSuite link in Applications area in the Easy Media Creator Home.
As you can see in this figure, the startup window for PhotoSuite is divided
into two panes on the left: Edit & Create and Print & Share. The upper Edit &
Create pane contains the common options for editing your digital photos and
starting new photo projects. The lower Print & Share pane contains a Print
option for printing digital photos that you’ve saved on your hard disk, an 
E-mail option for sending photos either as an attachment to an e-mail or right
inside the body of the e-mail message. The last option in this pane, Online
Photo Services, enables you to post your digital photos to a Web site where
others can view them with their Web browsers or to have them printed by a
professional photo finisher. 
Note that the pane on the right side of the initial PhotoSuite window gives
you general information about PhotoSuite 7. This area can also give you a
quick description of any option in the Edit & Create and Print & Share panes
that you might want to select. To display this descriptive information in the
pane on the right, simply position the mouse pointer somewhere over option

15
Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 7

in the panes on the left (when you do, not only does this descriptive informa-
tion appear on the right, but the option becomes underlined, indicating that
it contains a link). To initiate a particular option, you simply click its link.
When you do so, the layout and menu options in the PhotoSuite window
change to suit the task you’ve selected. See Chapter 8 for detailed informa-
tion on using all the PhotoSuite options.
Easy multimedia projects
thanks to DVD Builder
The DVD Builder is the application that you use to assemble and burn multi-
media projects on DVD. Multimedia projects are those that can combine
more than one type of media, including video clips, still photo images, text,
and audio tracks. You can use DVD Builder to quickly and easily convert your
digital home movies into menu-driven productions that you can play on a
computer DVD drive or a standalone DVD player attached to your TV. You
can also use DVD Builder to assemble your digital photo collections into
slideshows that once burned onto a DVD disc can be played in the selfsame
computer DVD drives or standalone DVD players.
Figure 1-5 shows the DVD Builder window that first opens after you click the
DVD Builder link in the Applications area in the Easy Media Creator Home (and
have indicated what type of DVD project to create). The DVD Builder window
is the most complicated of those that you’ll run into in Roxio Easy Media
Creator 7. As you can see in Figure 1-5, this window is divided into five panes:
 Add Content where you capture video for your DVD project from a
video camera attached to your computer or import it from clips or col-
lections already stored on your hard disk
 DVD Menu Settings where you can specify a visual theme for the
project’s menu screens (including layout and labeling of the menu but-
tons), select a photo or video to use as the background of all menu
screens, or add music or sound effects to play whenever the project’s
menu screens are displayed on the screen
 On-Disc Options where you can choose to burn your DVD project onto
disc or to edit a multimedia presentation previously saved on a DVD disc
 Menu Editor where you can customize the menu buttons or background
graphic
 Production Editor where you can edit the content of any one or all of
the titles (preassembled collections of photos or productions containing
video clips, still images, and audio) you’ve added to the DVD project,
including marking chapters (points in the title that you can jump to in
playback) and selecting transitions between individual video clips and
still images
16
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

DVD Builder is possibly the most versatile application in the entire Easy
Media Creator suite. Because you can combine all types of media (video, still
images, text, and audio) as you want, this is the place where you can be really
creative. In no time, you’ll be creating personalized and professional-looking
multimedia projects that you can share with all your friends and family who
have access to either a DVD drive in their computers or a standalone DVD
player. See Chapters 9, 10, and 11 for details on using the DVD Builder to
create your own DVD projects.
Riding the VideoWave
VideoWave is the application that you use to assemble and edit video projects
(referred to in the Roxio documentation as productions) that can include video
clips, still images, and audio. After assembling and editing a production in
VideoWave, you can either add it to a DVD project that you’re making in DVD
Builder or use DVD Builder to burn it onto a DVD disc (see “Easy multimedia
projects thanks to DVD Builder” that immediately precedes this section).
Figure 1-6 shows you the VideoWave 7 window that appears when you click
the VideoWave link in the Applications list in the Easy Media Creator Home.
When you first open the VideoWave window, it is divided into the three major
panes shown in this figure:

17
Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 7

 Production Preview where you can preview how your production will
play as you create and edit it
 Media Selector - Folders displaying file folders on your hard disk or
network with the media files (audio, video, or still) that you want to add
to the production (this pane can also display preassembled media col-
lections, transitions, text styles, overlays, or effects that you can add to
a production)
 Production Editor - Storyline displaying a storyboard view of the
video production, showing all the individual video clips and stills with
any in-between transitions in the order in which they will play in the
final production (this pane can also display the production in a Timeline
view which shows the timing of each element in the production along
with any audio or narration track that you’ve added)
Personally, I find that VideoWave interface is one of the easiest and most
straightforward for editing video that I’ve run across. I’m sure that with just
a little experience using this beauty, you’re going to love video editing.
If, however, you’re a complete newbie to video editing and are the least bit
intimidated about producing your own videos, you’ll be glad to know that
VideoWave includes two new components designed to make video editing
nearly foolproof:

18
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

 CineMagic which automatically edits your video production by trim-
ming your video clips and adjusting the tempo of the audio to fit the
flow and transitions you use (perfect for making MTV-type videos)
 StoryBuilder which uses a Wizard-type interface, providing step-by-
step guidance through assembling the various elements in your video
production
Starting your video-editing career with CineMagic and StoryBuilder is a per-
fect way to become familiar with the VideoWave interface and its capabilities.
From there, you can quickly move on to video editing on your own right using
the Storyline and Timeline views. See Chapter 11 for complete details on
using all aspects of VideoWave.
You launch VideoWave from the Easy Media Creator Home to create new
video productions. You also launch VideoWave directly from within the DVD
Builder application when you need to do some advanced editing on a video
production created earlier with VideoWave that you’ve imported into the
Video Project you’re currently working on or to do similar editing to the 
contents of a new title that you added to DVD project. Suffice it to say that
knowing how to use VideoWave goes a long way in mastering the video end 
of the Easy Media Creator suite.
Instant data copying thanks 
to Drag-to-Disc
Drag-to-Disc is one of the neatest yet simplest applications in the Easy Media
Creator suite. You can use this nifty program to make CD or DVD backups or
archives of data files on your hard disk or network simply by dragging their
folder or file icons on the Windows desktop and dropping them on the Drag-
to-Disc icon (shown in Figure 1-7). The Drag-to-Disc application is great
because it automatically does any formatting for the data CD or DVD as
needed to accommodate the files that you add.
To open the Drag-to-Disc icon, you can either click the Drag-to-Disc link in the
Applications area of the Easy Media Creator Home or click the Drag-to-Disc
icon (shown in the left margin of this paragraph) that appears in the Systems
Tray on the right side of the Windows taskbar immediately to the left of the
clock. If you click the Drag-to-Disc link when the Drag-to-Disc icon is already
displayed on your computer’s desktop (something that automatically hap-
pens when you first start your computer after installing Roxio Easy Media
Creator 7), the Easy Media Creator Home window is automatically minimized
to a button on Windows taskbar, displaying the Drag-to-Disc icon on your
desktop. For details on making quick data backups and archives with Drag-to-
Disc, see Chapter 3.

Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 7

Listening to the rap on Napster
Napster renown as the place to go on the Internet to download some cool tracks
is back, this time as one of the most complete online music stores available.
Napster enables you to search for, organize, and sample music tracks in seem-
ingly all genres of music, from Pop, Rock, Jazz, Metal, Hip-Hop, R&B, Soul,
Classical, Opera, to my personal favorite, Disco. Once you’ve found the album
or track you can’t live without, you can purchase it (99 cents a track and $9.95
for an entire album — much less than half the price you’d pay for the album in a
typical music store). You can then burn the tracks you’ve purchased to an audio
CD for playback in computer CD or DVD drive or standalone CD player or trans-
fer them directly to a standalone MP3 player (such as the Samsung - Napster 20
GB Digital Audio Player so prominently advertised on the Napster Home page).
The Easy Media Creator Home window contains two Napster buttons, one at
the bottom of the Applications area with a link labeled Napster and the other
in the lower-right corner of the Easy Media Creator Home window labeled
napster (in lowercase italic letters). You need Internet access in order to use
either one of these buttons. If you’ve never installed Napster on your com-
puter, you click the napster button at the bottom of the Easy Media Creator
Home window and sign up. After you’ve installed Napster on your computer,
you can click the Napster link at the bottom of the Applications area to
launch Napster (which, in turn, connects you to the Napster Web site).

Figure 1-8 shows you the Napster window as it opens when I click the Napster
link at the bottom of the Applications area on the Easy Media Creator Home
window (your Napster window won’t be quite as elaborate until you’ve started
using it to find and sample the music that turns you on). As you can see from
this figure, the main pane in the Napster window contains three buttons
(Home, Browse, and Library) with the Home button automatically selected.
You can also see that Home area contains four tabs (Music, Radio, Magazine,
and Message Boards) with Music automatically selected and its options 
displayed in the main viewing area below. To the immediate right of the 
main pane with the Music tab information displayed is a Now Playing pane
(your Napster window will lack this pane until you start playing around with
the Napster radio).
The Napster Home screen enables you to quickly display all sorts of artists
and albums for different music presets (Alternative, Classical, Country, Dance,
Hip-Hop, and so on) when the Music tab is selected, play a whole playlist of
tunes assembled into “radio” stations when the Radio tab is selected, peruse
issues of an online music magazine when the Magazine tab is selected, and
participate in online threaded chats about various music-related subjects.
You must subscribe to the Napster Premium service in order to have access
to the Radio, Magazine, and Message Boards tabs on the Napster Home
screen. This subscription service costs $9.99 a month and also entitles you
to completely sample and download most of the music available on the entire
Napster sites (some artists insist that you purchase their music before you
can play their entire track). Just be aware that if you don’t opt for joining 
this Premium service, all of your music sampling on Napster is restricted to
30 seconds of any track!

Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 7

The Napster Browse screen (displayed by clicking the Browse button at the
top of the Napster window) enables you to browse through the Napster cata-
log for the artists and albums that you want to sample and potentially pur-
chase. The Napster Library button (displayed by clicking the Library button)
organizes the music that you sample and purchase into convenient folders.
From this screen, you can play a track, send it to someone by e-mail, or even
burn it directly to an audio CD. 
Tools for Every Need
The Tools area of the Easy Media Creator Home window (see Figure 1-1)
contains a list of links to five tools (Media Manager, Capture, Label Creator,
Sound Editor, and Roxio Player), along with a link to the entire suite’s Help
Center and Tutorials. At the bottom of the this list, you find a pop-up button
labeled Extras & Utilities, which when clicked displays a menu of seven serv-
ices and utilities that you can access in using Roxio Easy Media Creator 7.
Clicking any of the five tool links launches a smaller program that performs a
specialized function that helps in creating various CD and DVD projects with
the applications discussed earlier in this chapter. The Help Center & Tutorial
link opens a Help Center window that you can access when you need guidance
in using any of the Easy Media Creator Applications and Tools. The remaining
sections of this chapter acquaint you with the primary function of each of the
program’s Tools, the Help Center, and the services and utilities collected on
the Extras & Utilities pop-up menu.
Media Manager at your service
You use the Media Manager to organize the many types of media files (video
clips, still images, audio, and video projects) that you use in the CD and DVD
projects you create. This handy-dandy little program enables you to keep
tabs on particular media files through the use of collections, special Easy
Media Creator files that associate selected media files together regardless of
where these files are actually physically located on your computer system.
Because collections reference to the media files you want to associate as a
group, you don’t have to go through all the trouble of copying or moving the
files into a single folder. You can also use the Media Manager to peruse your
media files, tag them with keywords for easy searching, as well as backing
these files up by burning them onto CD or DVD discs. 
Figure 1-9 shows the Media Manager window that appears when you click the
Media Manager link in the Tools area of the Easy Media Creator Home window.
Deceptively simple at first glance, this window is made up of only two panes:
22
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

a pane named Folders on the left that enables you to select any drive or folder
on your system and a pane with the name of the selected drive or folder on
the right that displays all the folders and files that that drive or folder con-
tains. You do the rest of the organizing magic with the buttons at both the top
of the Media Manager window and these panes (see Chapter 4 for details).
Catching up with Capture
As the name suggests, you use the Capture utility to import media files from
various devices such as a digital photo camera, video camera, scanner, and
microphone that’s connected to your computer system. You can also use
Capture to import media files from CD or DVD discs (which aren’t copy pro-
tected and to which you have the right to make copies) loaded into the CD or
DVD drive built into your computer.
Figure 1-10 shows the Capture window as it appears when I click the Capture
link in the Tools area of the Easy Media Creator Home window (your Capture
window may differ depending upon the actual devices you have connected to
your computer). As you can see, this window shows you all the devices from
which you can import media that are currently connected to your computer
system in the Detected Devices pane on the left. It then displays descriptive
general help information at the top of the Welcome to Capture pane on the
right, along with specific help about any of the connected devices when you
position the mouse pointer on its link in the Detected Devices pane.

23
Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Easy Media Creator 7

To import media from any of the devices connected to your computer
system, you simply click the link associated with the device link in the
Detected Devices pane. The layout and the options in the Capture window
then change to suit the type of device and the type of media file it supports
(see Chapter 10 for details on using Capture to import various types of
media files).
Lauding the Label Creator
You use the Label Creator tool to design and print labels for the CD and DVD
discs that you burn with the other Roxio Easy Media Creator applications. The
Label Creator makes quick work of designing both disc labels and the inserts
for their jewel cases. Figure 1-11 shows the Roxio Label Creator window as it
first opens. Note that you open this window not only by clicking the Label
Creator link in the Tools area of the Easy Media Creator Home window but
also by clicking a Create Label button in the final dialog box when burning CD
and DVD discs (see Chapters 5 and 12 for details).
The Label Creator window is divided into two panes: Tasks on the left and
Layout on the Right. The Tasks pane contains all of the tools you commonly
need to do the layout and add the content for your disc labels and jewel case
inserts. The Layout pane previews the contents of your disc label or jewel

case insert (the front and back printed cards that go inside the clear plastic
case that holds the disc), while at the same time enabling you to edit these
contents. For detailed information on using the Roxio Label Creator to design
and print labels for any of your CD or DVD discs, see Chapter 9.
Saying Hello to Sound Editor
You can use the Sound Editor tool to record audio from audio devices con-
nected to your computer (including analog sources such as cassettes and
LP records). You can then use its features to edit or enhance the audio
recording and convert to any of the supported digital audio file formats,
including MP3, WAV, OGG, and WMA (see Chapter 2 to find out what in the
world all these acronyms stand for).
Figure 1-12 shows you the Sound Editor window that appears when you
click the Sound Editor link in the Tools area of the Easy Media Creator Home
window after opening an MP3 audio file for editing. As you can see in this
figure, the Sound Editor interface represents the audio file graphically with a
sort of waveform readout (reminiscent of a snapshot of an oscilloscope dis-
play). This waveform displays the relative amplitude of the sound for the left
and right channels (marked L and R) of the audio file.

You can then use the controls at the bottom of the Sound Editor to playback
all of or any part of the audio track. You can also use the zoom controls located
immediately above the waveform display to magnify portions of the audio’s
waveform display or zoom out on it so that more of the entire track is shown in
the Sound Editor. See Chapter 5 for details on using the Sound Editor to record
and edit the audio files that you burn to CD or use in your DVD projects.
Playback with the Roxio Player
You can use the Roxio Player to playback video CDs or DVDs discs that you
create with the Roxio Easy Media Creator suite or video projects that you’ve
saved on your hard disk. This tool is particularly useful for previewing a video
CD or DVD disc that you’ve burned with your equipment before distributing
it to others for viewing on their equipment.
Figure 1-13 shows you the Roxio Player window after launching it by clicking
the Roxio Player link in the Tools area of the Easy Media Creator Home window
and loading a DVD movie that I created with the Roxio DVD Builder applica-
tion. Note that this simple window is composed of two parts: a display area
above where the video plays and a band at the bottom that contains all the
controls for playing the video.
To play a video CD or DVD that you’ve created, you follow these steps:
1. Start the Roxio Player by clicking the Start button on the Windows
taskbar, positioning the mouse pointer over All Programs on the Start
menu, then over Roxio on the All Programs Menu, and then click
Roxio Player on the Roxio submenu.
You can also start the Roxio Player from the Easy Media Creator Home
window by clicking the Roxio Player link in the Tools area.

2. Place the disc with the video CD or DVD you want to play in the Roxio
Player in your computer’s CD or DVD drive.
Wait a few seconds before performing Step 3 so that your CD or DVD
drive can wind up and the Roxio Player can find the disc.
3. Click the Play button in the middle of the Player controls at the
bottom of the Roxio Player window (see Figure 1-13).
If your computer is equipped with both a CD and DVD drive, you may
have to specify which drive contains the disc you want to play. To do
this, click the Options button in the lower-left corner of the Roxio Player
window and then click Change Selected Drive. Use the drop-down Drive
Letter menu in the Change Selected Drive dialog box to select the cor-
rect drive before you click OK. 
As soon as you click the Play button in the Player controls, the video CD or
DVD begins playing. If you’re playing a DVD and it has an Intro title, this intro-
duction title begins playing. If your video CD or DVD has an opening menu
screen, this screen appears, waiting for you to select the menu option for the
title you want to play.

If the menu screen offers several titles, each represented by its own menu
button, each of the titles is represented by a labeled button. You can play a
particular title by positioning the mouse pointer over the button to highlight
it and then clicking its button (when playing the disc in a standalone DVD
player, you would do this by pressing the arrow keys on the DVD controller
to highlight the button for the title you want to view and then pressing the
controller’s Enter key).
When playing a video CD or DVD, you can toggle back and forth between full-
screen video viewing and viewing the video within your normal Roxio Player
window by pressing the “F” key on your keyboard or double-clicking the
video display area. If you need access to the video controls after switching 
to full screen, click the screen (it doesn’t matter where the mouse pointer 
is when you do this). To make the video controls disappear, just click the
screen another time.
If after viewing part of a particular DVD title, you want to return to the main
menu screen to select another title to view, click the Menu button on the
Player controls. If the title you’re viewing in the Roxio player has chapters
(specific jump points in the video), you can jump to the next chapter by click-
ing the Skip Next button. If you want to jump to an earlier chapter in the title,
you click the Skip Previous button instead.
To pause the playing of a video CD or DVD, click the Pause button in the
Player controls. When you finish playing the disc, you can either stop the
play by clicking the Stop button or simply eject the disc from its CD or DVD
drive by clicking the Eject button in the Player controls.
You can’t use the Roxio Player to play DVDs that you haven’t created and
burned with the Roxio Easy Media Creator suite such as commercial DVD
movies that you’ve rented or purchased. To play these DVDs on your com-
puter, you need to use another player capable of playing DVDs such as the
Windows Media Player.
Help is on the way!
The Help Center & Tutorials link near the very bottom of the Tools area of the
Easy Media Creator window is your ticket to complete online help with using
any and all aspects of the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 suite. Figure 1-14 shows
you the Easy Media Creator Home Help Center window that opens when you
click this link in the Home window.
In getting program help from this window, you have a choice between help
topics that give you an overview of using the various applications and tools
included in the suite (sort of like this chapter gives you) or getting specific
help on a particular application or tool. To seek out general program help,
use the Contents, Index, Search, and Favorites tabs in the pane on the left
28
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

(this pane presents its help topics on the standard tabs in the manner
common to all Windows programs).
To get application- or tool-specific help, locate the name of the application
or tool in the larger Welcome to Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 pane on the right
side of the Home Help Center window. For a great many of the applications
and tools shown in this pane, you can choose between seeing an animated
tutorial and perusing the user guide for that application or tool.
If you’ve never opened a particular application or tool and are curious about
what it can do, you should definitely start by clicking the application’s or
tool’s Tutorial link. When you do this, the Help Center opens a separate
window in which the tutorial plays. Each animated tutorial has a sound track
and subtitles that explain the screens and animated actions shown in each
scene in the tutorial. To pause the playing of a tutorial, click the Pause button
(the second button) in the controls at the very bottom of the Tutorial
window. To resume playing the tutorial, click the Play button (the very first
control). To advance to a particular scene in the tutorial, drag the slider
button in the slider at the bottom or click the Skip Next (the button with the
two arrowheads pointing to the right) or the Skip Previous (the button with
the two arrowheads pointing to the left). When you finish playing the tutorial,
click its window’s Close box (the upper-right corner of the window) to close
the window.

Open an application’s or tool’s user guide when you need a printed copy of
the guide for using that particular application or tool. When you click the
User Guide link for an application or tool, the Help Center launches your
Web browser and Adobe Acrobat Reader (which appears inside the browser).
The opening page of the user guide (which is saved as PDF file) then appears
in browser window along with the Adobe Reader controls. 
To print a copy of the entire user guide, click the Print button on the very
first toolbar displayed at the top of your browser’s window and then click OK
in the Print dialog box. To print a particular help topic, use the bookmarks in
the Bookmarks Navigation pane on the left to determine its page numbers;
then click the Print button and fill in the appropriate start and stop page
numbers in the Pages From and To text boxes in the Print dialog box before
you click OK.
To copy a particular help topic or step-by-step instructions into a document
in another Windows program, click the Select Text Tool (labeled Select Text);
then use the I-beam pointer to drag through and select all the text you want
to copy. Then press Ctrl+C to copy the selected text to the Windows Clipboard,
switch to the document in the other program, click the insertion point at the
place where you want the help text copied, and then press Ctrl+V to insert
the help text into the document at the insertion point.
When perusing the help information in an application or tool user guide, you
can use the Zoom controls or the Actual Size, Fit Page, and Fit Width buttons
to resize the text in the Document pane on the right side of the browser
window. Click Fit Page to resize the text so that each page is fully displayed in
Document pane. Click Fit Width to resize the text so that it fills out the width
of the Document pane. Click Actual Size to resize the text with the 100% set-
ting so that it represents more-or-less the size at which the text prints. 
You can also use the Zoom Out and Zoom In buttons to decrease and
increase the magnification of the text in set increments. To select a particular
magnification, click the Magnification drop-down button and click a preset or
click the Insertion Point in the Magnification text box and replace the current
setting with one of your own (by selecting the current setting and then typing
in a new one). When you finish printing or viewing the help information in the
user guide, you can close it, Adobe Acrobat Reader, and your Internet Browser
by clicking the Browser window’s Close button in its upper-right corner.
Because each of the application and tool user guides are saved in the Adobe
PDF file format, you must have the Adobe Acrobat Reader (simply called the
Adobe Reader in version 6) or a full-fledged version of Adobe Acrobat installed
on your computer in order to view and print these guides. If you don’t yet
have Adobe Reader installed on your computer, you can download and install
a free copy by going on the Internet and visiting the following Web page:

Exploring the Extras and Utilities
The last item in the Tools area of the Easy Media Creator Home window is an
Extras & Utilities pop-up button. When you click this button, a pop-up menu
with the following options appears:
 Disc and Device Utility to display a Disc and Device Utility dialog box
where you can view all of the drives and external devices that are con-
nected to your computer system
 Roxio Retrieve to open the Roxio Retrieve utility that enables you to
get files from multi-disc data discs, backup data discs, and encrypted
data discs that you created with the Creator Classic application (see
Chapter 3 for information on using Roxio Retrieve to restore media files
stored across multiple CD or DVD discs)
 Roxio Updater to go online to the Roxio Web site to check for updates to
your Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 suite that you can download and install
 Audible Manager to go online to the Audible.com Web site where you
can register and purchase audio books for playing on your computer or
your MP3 player (see Chapter 6)
 Digital Media Services to go online to the Roxio.com Web site where
you get information about all the online services available for processing
the digital media you use in your CD and DVD projects
 Roxio Registration to register your copy of the Roxio Easy Media
Creator 7 suite online at the Roxio.com Web site (you have to do this
only if you didn’t register the program when you installed it)
 About Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 to display the About Roxio Easy
Media Creator 7 dialog box that contains a bunch of technical and legal
information (spread out on four tabs: General, Details, Legal, and System
Information) about your copy of Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 and your
computer system
To open a particular utility dialog box or window on this menu, you simply
click its name in the pop-up menu. Remember, however, that you must have
Internet access in order to use the Roxio Updater, Audible Manager, Digital
Media Services, and Roxio Registration options. 
The Disc and Device Utility and About Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 options
are most helpful when you’re having technical trouble getting some part of
the program to run properly. Your system information combined with the
information on the various devices connected to your computer system can
be most helpful to a Roxio support technician trying to diagnose and help
you fix the problem.

The Ins and Outs of Digital
Media and Gear
In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with the wide range of digital media file formats
 Converting analog media to digital
 Selecting your digital camera and camcorder
 Selecting your DVD and MP3 player
 The proper care and handling of your CD and DVD discs
T
he many tools the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 suite puts at your disposal
certainly make it easy to create your own audio and video projects. This
ease of use, however, is not quite matched when it comes to making heads or
tails of the many and sundry media formats and equipment you can use in
recording and saving these projects.
To help dispel potential confusion over your choices of media formats for the
particular audio and video gear you’re using, this chapter begins by examin-
ing the relationship of media formats to digital recording and playback equip-
ment. It then goes on to introduce you to the essential difference between
analog and digital media, why you want to get on the digital bandwagon, and
some of the devices you can use to convert your analog media to digital for
use with the Easy Media Creator. 
Finally, this chapter looks at some of your options in terms of digital record-
ing and playback paraphernalia, including digital still cameras, video cameras,
and audio recorders, not to mention CD and DVD drives, and CD, MP3, and
DVD players. It ends with a few important pointers on the care and feeding
(I mean, handling) of the CD and DVD discs you use for saving and recording
your Easy Media Creator projects.

Feeling at Home in the Digital
Media Menagerie
Before I can clear up any perplexity that you might have about the different
types of media that are available to you as you start working with the Easy
Media Creator, you need to be clear about the relationship between the digi-
tal media formats and the kinds of recorders and playback gear you have.
The standard media formats for both CD and DVD discs come in several fla-
vors (see the sidebar that follows for the essential difference between CD and
DVD discs). As you see in Table 2-1, by and large these formats differ accord-
ing to how much data they hold, their recording speed, and whether or not
they enable you to record data on them only once or erase and rerecord data
multiple times (referred to by the term rewritable).

When shopping for discs to use for your various Easy Media Creator projects,
you need to match the capacities of your recording and playback hardware
with the proper media. Be sure to check the boxes of media for the following
pieces of information:
 CD or DVD indicating whether the discs are formatted for recording and
playback of CDs or DVDs
 Maximum data capacity expressed in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB)
 Recording speed, anywhere from 1x (times) up to about 8x for DVDs and
anywhere up 52x for CDs
 R or RW indicating whether the discs can be recorded once or are
rewritable
34
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

You may be scratching your head wondering about what’s up with the 
DVD-R and DVD+R and the DVD-RW and DVD+RW formats listed in Table 2-1.
Basically, the minus and plus indicate two slightly different single and 
multi-session DVD recording formats. The -R and -RW formats were the first
DVD recording formats that were compatible with standalone DVD players
(the ones you connect to your TV). The +R and +RW formats are newer and
boast some improvements in recording (newer DVD-ROM computer drives
tend to be DVD+RW compatible drives).
DVD-R and DVD+R are the non-rewritable formats that are compatible with
almost all DVD players and DVD-ROM drives. DVD-RW and DVD+RW are the
rewritable formats and are compatible with about 75 percent of the DVD play-
ers and almost all DVD-ROM drives. 
Note that the DVD+RW format supports both a single-side 4.7 GB disc (known
as DVD-5) and a double-side 9.2 GB disc (known as DVD-10). The DVD-RAM
has the best recording features but it is not compatible with most DVD-ROM
drives and standalone DVD-video players (you need to check to make sure
that your recorder and player can deal with DVD-RAM discs).
35
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear
What separates the CDs from the DVDs
CD stands for Compact Disc and comes in two
very familiar forms: audio CDs that play in all
standard CD players and CD-ROMs that play in
your computer’s CD or DVD drive. DVD stands
for Digital Versatile Disc (although some replace
the Versatile with Video) and is most familiar in
the form of movies on DVD disc that you rent or
purchase. 
Both CDs and DVDs rely on laser technology to
decode their sequence of binary (0 and 1) data.
The big difference between CDs and DVDs is
their data capacity. Because DVDs use smaller
tracks than CDs (0.74 microns wide as opposed
to 1.6 microns), they can store much more digital
data on the same size disc (both CD and DVD are
the same diameter and often the same thick-
ness), about two hours of video or about 4.7 GB
(gigabytes or one billion bytes!) of digital data
compared to about 74 minutes of audio or about
700 MB (megabytes or one million bytes) of dig-
ital data or less. Because DVDs use smaller
tracks to fit more data on the same-size disc,
they also require special computer drives for
recording and playing their discs. Fortunately,
DVD drives can also record and play back CDs
(although CD drives cannot record and play
back DVD discs).

In terms of selecting new hardware for your computer, keep in mind the fol-
lowing distinctions among drives:
 CD-ROM drives can only read CD discs
 DVD-ROM drives can only read CD and DVD discs
 CD-RW/DVD combo drives can read and write CD discs but only read
DVD discs
 DVD-R and DVD+R drives can read and write CD discs but only read
DVD discs
 DVD-RW and DVD+RW drives can read and write both CD and DVD discs
If you’re in a position of selecting among the different types of drives for a
new computer system, go with a DVD+RW drive if you can possibly afford 
it. By selecting a DVD+RW drive, you get the benefits of all the other three
types of drives as well as the ability to back up data and video on your own
DVD discs. This means that you get to play your favorite music CDs and
movies and videos on your computer while at same time being able to take
full advantage of the Roxio Easy Media Creator software to create and burn
your own CD and DVD creations (including data and audio CDs and data and
multimedia DVDs).
Let’s hear it for the Video and
Super Video CD formats
In addition to the regular CD-R format used to record standard data and
audio CDs, you need to be aware of two other CD formats, both of which can
incorporate both audio and video like a DVD:
 Video CD (VCD) which can hold up to 74/80 minutes of video on a
650/700 MB CD and can be played in most of the new standalone
DVD players
 Super Video CD (SVCD) which can hold up to 35-60 minutes of video
on a 650/700 MB CD and can be played in many of the new standalone
DVD players
Note that SVCD format supports higher quality video than your regular
VCD but as you can see from the above descriptions is less compatible and
holds less video. When creating a new multimedia project with Roxio’s DVD
Builder application, you can choose to create in either the VCD or SVCD
format instead of the standard DVD format.
36
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

Ripping through those 
pesky audio formats
Audio file formats vary almost as much as CD and DVD formats. These for-
mats, however, only contain information about the shape and duration of the
audio’s waveform. In addition, the format will specify the sample rate (the res-
olution of the audio that determines the sound quality), bit-depth (the number
of bits, 0 and 1, used to describe the volume of the sample at any given point
in the audio stream), and may include the type of compression used (assum-
ing that the audio is compressed at all).
When an audio file uses an audio format without compression, it is naturally
a larger file that requires more computer memory to play than files using dif-
ferent compression schemes. As a general rule, a second of uncompressed
audio of the quality of your typical store-bought album on CD, which uses a
sample rate of 44.1 kHz (kilohertz), a bit-depth of 16-bit, and is stereo, takes
about 172 Kb (kilobytes) to store on your computer (that’s about 10 MB per
minute and 604 MB per hour).
On computers running Windows, uncompressed audio is almost always
stored in the so-called WAV audio format (pronounced wave). This format is
also known as PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) and carries a .WAV file extension.
WAV files store are standard CD quality (44.1 kHz, 16-bit, stereo), meaning
that they are big files that hog up your disk space.
In terms of compressed audio, you’ll run into a number of different 
schemes — each of which is technically known as a codec (short for compress/
decompress) — for compressing and later decompressing the audio stream. 
The most popular audio codecs for computers running some flavor of
Microsoft Windows are the ever-present MP3 (MPEG 3) and WMA (Windows
Media Audio). The WMA format was developed by Microsoft for its Windows
Media Player. This codec does not compress audio files as much as the much
more popular, MP3 but it does tend to have slightly better sound quality. MP3
is, however, the most popular codec for storing and streaming music (thus
the plethora of so-called MP3 players — see “I want my MP3” later in this
chapter for details). 
MPEG actually stands for Motion Picture Experts Group, the name of a highly
prestigious committee that sets standards for the encoding of digital video
and sound. MPEG 3 actually uses the so-called MPEG 1, a video codec for
compressing video in digital cameras and camcorders and in the creation of
VCDs (Video CDs supported by DVD Builder) with what’s called the Audio
Layer 3 codec, thus the name MPEG 3 or, as it’s more commonly known, MP3.
37
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear

In addition to MP3 and WMA compression, in the Roxio Easy Media Creator
components, you may also run across the OGG codec. OGG refers to Ogg
Vorbis, an open, patent-free codec for audio encoding and streaming that is
gaining some popularity. Ogg is not, as far as I can tell, an acronym like WMA
or MP3 (perhaps it refers to Ogg, the former gamekeeper at Hogwarts in book
four of Harry Potter before Hagrid takes over the post?). Where the name
Vorbis comes from is anyone’s guess.
If you’re a user of Apple’s iTunes, you run into another compression scheme
known popularly as AAC (Advanced Audio Coding). This scheme uses MPEG
4 compression codec, and Audio files saved in AAC are often smaller than
MP3 files with better sound quality (unfortunately, Roxio’s Easy Media
Creator 7 sound applications do not support this audio file format).
Don’t you hate those “lossy” codecs?
There’s one more consideration when it comes to compression schemes.
When considering a codec to select for your audio, you need to reflect on
whether or not the codec is lossy or lossless. A lossy codec is one that actu-
ally loses content that is considered to be duplicated or not essential in lis-
tening to the audio. A lossless codec is just the opposite: in compressing
audio, it does not remove any of the bits from the original audio file that it
cannot restore when the audio stream is decompressed for playback.
As you might guess, lossy codecs make for smaller compressed audio files
but with slightly lesser sound quality. Lossless codecs, on the other hand,
make for larger compressed files but usually with great fidelity to the original.
This is the reason that MP3 audio files are generally a little smaller than the
same WMA audio files and that WMA audio files are generally considered of
slightly higher quality than MP3 files because MP3 is the lossy codec of the
two and WMA the lossless one.
38
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 
Codecs for more than just audio
Although this section deals solely with audio
compression, codecs are by no means restricted
to audio compression. Digital photos and video
both use their own codecs in order to keep
down the size of their visual media. The most
popular codec for digital photos is JPEG (Joint
Photographic Experts Group), which can vary 
in terms of its size/quality ratio. For digital video,
the most popular codecs are MPEG 1, used
primarily for video from digital cameras and
camcorders, and MPEG 2, used primarily for
commercially produced movies on DVD and in
TiVo-type hard disk video recorders.

When applying lossy codecs such as MP3, JPEG (for digital images), and
MPEG1 (for digital camera and camcorder video) to your media files, the Easy
Media Creator applications and tools normally allow you to adjust the amount
of compression to apply by selecting the relative quality for the compressed
file. Select the best quality when larger file sizes aren’t an issue and lesser
quality when the relative size of the file is most important.
Ripping and burning those audio files
Before leaving behind the fascinating subject of audio file formats, you should
be aware of a couple more procedures, namely ripping and burning audio files
(terms, I admit, that suggest a degree of violence that is totally absent in their
actual processes). Ripping refers to the process of taking audio tracks from
one source in one audio format and saving them to another in a second audio
format. The most common example of ripping is when you take tracks from 
a commercially produced CD and save them in another compressed digital
format on your hard disk such as MP3 or WMA with the Creator Classic 
application.
Burning refers to the process of then taking the audio files that you’ve ripped
to a new audio format such as MP3 and WMA on your computer’s hard disk
and then transferring them to a blank CD disc for playback on other devices
(like a CD or MP3 player). Note that although you hear the term ripping
applied mostly to audio files, it can also be applied to video files saved on
DVD discs as well (although this requires special software besides Roxio Easy
Media Creator, as most DVDs are highly copy-protected).
The term burning is, however, applied equally to the creation of both CD and
DVD discs so that you find Burn buttons in both the Creator Classic and DVD
Builder applications.
Make Mine Digital!
It’s true that nowadays digital is king (and as the immortal Mel Brooks is so
fond of telling us, “It’s good to be king!”). Nowhere is this rush to digital seen
more clearly than in the purchase of consumer electronics which today are
almost entirely digital in nature, as in digital cameras, camcorders, DVD play-
ers, and digital audio players. It seems like the only electronics gear that is
still analog is tape recorders and even you have the choice of going digital
with DAT (Digital Audio Tape) recorders.
So what’s this all about, this analog versus digital business? Well, let me start
by giving you the textbook definition of each, followed by the classic example
that hopefully makes their rather dry explanations all clear.
39
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear

By definition, analog devices are apparatuses in which the data is repre-
sented by continuously variable physical quantities (you say what?). Digital
devices, however, are machines in which the data is represented by discrete
units, namely the binary number system which consists of just two measly
numbers, 0 and 1.
Okay, now that that’s clear as mud, take a look at the classic example of an
apparatus that exists in both analog and digital forms, namely your wrist-
watch. If your watch happens to have a dial that shows the sequence of the
twelve hours and represents the current time on this time with the placement
of its hands (at least an hour and minute hand and perhaps even a hand to
keep track of the passing seconds), then you’re wearing an analog device.
And this device represents its data (that is, the passing hours, minutes, and
seconds on the twelve-hour dial) “by continuously variable physical quanti-
ties” (that’s the moving watch hands to you and me).
If, however, you’re wearing a wristwatch that has no hour dial and uses no
hands but actually tells you the current time in Arabic numerals, as in 6:15:33
or 22:05:09, you are the proud owner of a digital device, one that represents
its data (the same passing hours, minutes, and seconds) in discrete binary
units (which clock manufacturer has skillfully disguised as a readout showing
the current time).
Now nice as the wristwatch example is, it doesn’t help too much in terms of
the kinds of devices you’ll be using with your Easy Media Creator software.
For examples closer to the work you’ll be doing with it, I prefer the examples
of the long-playing record versus the audio CD and the videocassette versus
video on DVD. Records are prime examples of analog audio media just as
videocassettes are great examples of analog video media. And you guessed it;
audio CDs and video DVDs are excellent examples of their digital audio and
video counterparts.
One way to keep analog mechanisms straight from digital ones is to remem-
ber that the word “analog” is related to the term “analogous,” denoting some-
thing that is similar to something else so that most analog devices capture
their data by acting like the sense organs with which we collect data. So,
analog cameras have lenses that capture light in similar ways that the lens in
the human eye and analog audio recorders have microphones that vibrate
like the tympanic membrane in the ear. Even the classic analog clock with its
dial and moving hands in some ways mimics a sundial in the way that the
sun’s shadow moves across its disk.
Why digital rules
And now I can tell you the main reasons that digital has been crowned king.
The first reason is that devices that play back such analog media as LPs and
videocassettes can only access their data (sound and music, in this case)
40
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

sequentially. The ramification of this fact becomes abundantly clear in the
case of a videocassette when you go to try to find and replay a favorite scene
in a movie on tape. Instead of being able to jump right to the scene as you
can do with the controller for your DVD player (assuming that the movie is
also available on DVD, which nowadays is almost always true), you have to
fast forward or reverse until you recognize the place in the movie you want to
replay. The discrete rather than continuous nature of digital audio and video
media is what makes this kind of random access of the data possible.
The second reason that digital is riding so high and mighty comes from the fact
that copies of any type of digital media (including sound, photos, and video)
are every bit (pun intended) as good as the original, since both the original and
copy contain the exact same sequence of 0 and 1s. This is definitely not true of
analog media. The quality of each copy of an analog master is slightly degraded
and copies made from copies are even worse (just as a photocopy made from
a photocopy of an original is fainter and lacks much of the original detail).
So too, the quality of most media that store analog data (with film being the
most notorious) naturally degrades with time (you have only to thumb
through an album filled with your baby pictures to know what I’m talking
about). By and large, this is not true of most digital media (hard disks and
DVD discs stored properly should last you a really long time) and, of course,
in the cases where it is, you can always create a new master from any copy
that is still intact (thus the singular importance of making backups and the
beauty of the fact that a copy made from a copy of an original is equal in
quality to that copy and, indeed, the original itself).
Converting analog media to digital
The best way to protect your precious analog data (usually stored in photos,
home movies, audio tape recordings, videocassettes, and LPs) is to convert
the analog data from digital data. In fact, this may well be your primary moti-
vation for learning how to use the applications and tools in the Roxio Easy
Media Creator suite and may turn out to be your primary use for the software. 
Like me, you may have shoeboxes of family pictures in the attic, a closet full
of Super 8 home movies, drawers full of videocassettes, and a basement full
of the most incredible collection of records, both LPs and 45s (now virtually
abandoned and utterly unplayed). Fortunately, you can take steps to pre-
serve this very precious data and all the wonderful memories it contains by
making digital copies of their media. The device you use to convert analog
data to digital depends upon the type of analog media you’re converting. 
The next two sections look at two of the most common and most reasonably
priced analog-to-digital conversion devices: the digital scanner that you can
use to digitize photos and, in some cases, slides and the analog-to-DV (digital
video) converters that enable you to convert video saved as home movies
and videocassettes.
41
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear

“Scotty, scan me up . . .”
A digital scanner is one of the most useful and cost-effective analog-to-digital
conversion devices you can own. Scanners come in several flavors: film scan-
ners designed specifically for scanning photos from film (including negatives)
and 35mm slides and film, handheld scanners that you pass over the object
or page you want digitized, sheetfed scanners where you feed the photo or
page to scanned, and flatbed scanners designed for scanning any object that
you can fit on its flatbed (especially printed text and images and photos
developed from film).
For about a $100 or less, you can get a really decent flatbed scanner with
which you can digitize all your family photos, news clippings, and favorite
cards and letters and preserve them in digital form before they become too
faded and stained to enjoy. If you want to be able to scan photo negatives,
slides, and filmstrips as well, you’ll have to pay more but you can still find a
flatbed scanner that can scan these without having to resort to purchasing a
special film scanner (which doesn’t enable you to scan items like cards, let-
ters, and pages of a book).
Note that almost any scanner that you buy today can connect to your com-
puter through an USB (Universal Serial Bus) 2.0 cable (the type of cable con-
nector typically used to connect a mouse to newer computers. Higher end
(and more costly) scanners can also connect to your computer through the
so-called FireWire (officially known by its much more boring designation, IEEE-
1394) cable. Although a FireWire connection between your scanner and com-
puter is not necessary, keep in mind that FireWire connectivity is completely
necessary when it comes to transferring digital video from a digital camera or
camcorder to your computer (in such cases, USB 2.0 just isn’t fast enough).
Analog-to-DV converters
Analog-to-DV converters are standalone devices that enable you to connect
analog devices such as an 8mm video camera or VHS format VCR to them via
Composite video or S-video and RCA audio cables. The converter then con-
verts the analog signal from the movie or tape to digital and sends the resulting
0 and 1 bits to your computer’s hard disk via a FireWire cable. And once you’ve
got the video data converted to digital and saved on your hard disk, you can
then use Easy Media Creator applications such as VideoWave and DVD Builder
to arrange and enhance the content (see Chapters 11 and 12 for details).
The nice thing about analog-to-DV converters like the Pyro A/V Link is that
the conversion is not limited to analog to digital. After you arrange and
enhance your digital video data with the Easy Media Creator software, you
can then use the converter to convert it back to analog and transfer it out to
a connected analog device such as a VCR. That way, you can save your final
digital video project on VHS tape and then share the resulting videocassette
with those in your family who haven’t yet crossed over the digital divide.
42
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

Sorting Out Your Digital Recording Gear
While it’s great to be able to convert your analog data to digital for use in
your Easy Media Creator projects, it’s even better (and a heck of a lot easier)
to capture the data in digital form in the first place. To be able to capture digi-
tal media for use in your Easy Media Creator projects, at the very minimum
you’ll want to have access to a digital still camera (sometimes abbreviated to
digicam) and a digital video camera (commonly called a camcorder, a trunca-
tion of camera-recorder).
When selecting a digital camera or camcorder, not only is the quality of the
camera lens critical in determining the quality of your photos as with their
analog counterparts but another unique factor comes into play, the resolution
of a sensor called a CCD (Charge Coupled Device), whose pixels actually reg-
ister the photographed image on the camera’s disk. It is the resolution of the
camera’s CCD that most affects the sharpness of the photographed image. 
Both digital still and movie cameras are rated by the highest CCD resolution
they support (measured in megapixels that are a factor of the product of the
number of horizontal and vertical pixels used on the CCD sensor). With still
cameras, you can select a resolution beneath the camera’s highest megapixel
rating, enabling you to store a greater number of lesser resolution photos on
the camera’s storage disk. With camcorders, you can’t modify the CCD resolu-
tion so that your movies are always recorded at the camera’s highest setting.
In addition to the megapixel rating of the camera’s CCD sensor, when select-
ing a digital still camera, you’ll want to pay attention to the following factors:
 Whether or not the camera has a zoom lens (usually a mechanical zoom
lens is superior to the so-called digital zoom that doesn’t actually move
the lens forward and back)
 How much built-in memory the camera has and whether this memory is
expandable through some kind of flash memory disk or memory stick
(the amount of memory determines how many photos you can take
before you have to transfer them onto your computer’s hard disk)
 Whether or not the camera has an LCD screen which enables you to pre-
view the photo right after you take it
 The kind of computer interface the camera has (most support USB 2.0
connectivity, although the higher-end cameras also support FireWire
connectivity
When selecting a digital camcorder, you apply many of the same criteria as
when choosing a digital still camera (megapixel rating, zoom lens, LCD screen,
and USB versus FireWire connectivity). Of course, the big difference between
a digital still camera and camcorder is how they record their images. 
43
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear

Many camcorders still record their video on film, although a few of the small-
est ones use flash memory cards and a few of the very newest ones can record
their video directly on MiniDVD discs. Most camcorders, however, continue
to record their video on Mini DV cassettes (which support the DV media
format with CD quality sound). Mini DV cassettes are normally available in
30-, 60-, and 90-minute sizes.
Be aware that MiniDVD discs (3-inch diameter or about half the size of a stan-
dard DVD disc) do not play in all DVD players. Before you invest in a cam-
corder that uses MiniDVD discs, be sure that your DVD Player plays media
this size. Otherwise, you’ll end up always having to dump the video that you
take with the camera onto your hard disk and then use one of the Easy Media
Creator applications to burn it onto a standard-size DVD in order to play it in
your machine.
When It’s “Playback” Time
Getting your digital recording gear is truly only half the story, for what good
is a digital camcorder if you have no way to play the movies you make with it
outside of its tiny LCD screen or on your computer screen? The other half of
the story has got to be what you are going to use to play all those great audio
and video projects you create with the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7.
The next two sections give you an overview of the capabilities of today’s crop
of DVD and MP3 players. Both of these devices are surely among the hottest
digital electronics on the market and ones that you want to consider invest-
ing in given the capabilities of your Roxio Easy Media Creator software.
Delving into the world of DVD players
DVD players have eclipsed videocassette players much faster than most
people anticipated. This is probably not only due to their much superior
video and sound quality but also to the dramatic decrease in their pricing:
you can now get a decent player for anywhere between $100 and $200.
When choosing a DVD player, you have to consider what media formats (DVD
and otherwise) that the player supports (see “Feeling at Home in the Digital
Media Menagerie” earlier in this chapter for details). Some DVD players not
only support a number of DVD media formats but audio DVD, CD, and MP3 as
well. This feature enables you to play the audio DVD, CDs, and MP3 discs as
well as the DVD video discs that you assemble and burn with your Easy Media
Creator software.
44
Part I: A Bit about Easy Media Creator and Digital Media 

If you still have a lot of videocassettes that you like to play (and you haven’t
yet bought into the idea of converting them all into digital DVD discs), you
might want to consider purchasing a DVD/VCR player that can play both DVD
video discs and your VHS cassettes.
If you’re into recording your favorite television programs as well as being
able to play your DVDs, you might consider investing in a DVD recorder
(often abbreviated DVR). These beauties enable you to record your favorite
programs onto DVD-R or DVD-RAM discs (remember that a DVD-RAM disc
holds a whopping 9.4 GB of data and can be rewritten over 100,000 times).
Some models are so fancy that they enable you to watch programs that have
been recorded on a DVD-R or DVD-RAM disc while the recorder is in the
process of recording another TV program on the same disc!
If you have a DVD recorder and you’re like me and want to be able to record
TV programs while you’re away from home or watching another program, 
the TiVo service is the only to go. TiVo enables you to program your DVD
recorder to save your favorite programs on a daily or weekly basis, any time
of the day. In addition, TiVo offers a new Home Media Option that lets you
program the recording of a TV program remotely through a computer, record
a program on a DVR in one room of your house and then play it on another
DVR in a different room, as well as use your MP3 playlists to play MP3s on
MP3 discs and organize a slideshow for viewing digital photos saved on data
CDs or DVDs.
I want my MP3!
Today’s DVD players enable you to play the audio CDs and MP3 discs that
you burn with the Roxio Easy Media Creator software with no problem. But
what about the times when you’re on the move (which is probably more
often than not) and you want to take your tunes with you? For that you’re
going to need a portable digital audio player more commonly referred to as
an MP3 player.
MP3 players, like those in Apple’s amazing iPod series, are now available in
an array of music capacities and price points. In general, they run the gamut
from $69 all the way to just over $500 (ouch!). The primary determinant of
the price of an MP3 is, by and large, the amount of built-in memory the device
has (which translates directly into how many MP3 music tracks it can store
and how many minutes/hours of audio listening you have available). For
example, at the low end, the $69 Rio has only 64MB of memory which gives
you about two hours of music. At the high end, the $470 Apple iPod has 40 GB
of memory which enables it to hold up to a whopping 10,000 tracks for more
than 20 hours of back-to-back playback.
45
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear

Because of the tight integration between the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7
suite and the Napster online music service (Roxio purchased and resurrected
Napster), you might want to consider the Samsung Napster 20.0 MB YP-910GS
MP3 player (shown in Figure 2-1). With 20 MB of memory, this player holds
about 5,000 tracks of music for about 10 hours of playback. This player also
has a built-in FM tuner (that lets you record songs from the radio) and trans-
mitter (that enables you to play your MP3 tracks through your car’s radio),
along with a voice recorder. But the best part of this mighty little MP3 player
is that it’s tightly integrated with the Napster 2.0 music service, enabling you
to download your playlists and MP3 tracks directly to the YP-910GS when it’s
connected to your computer via its USB 2.0 port (see Chapter 6 for details on
using this device with Napster).
Technically speaking, the Apple iPod is not really just an MP3 player. It is, in
fact, an MP4 player in that it’s capable of not only playing MP3 audio but digi-
tal audio stored in the more advanced MPEG-4 audio codec with the so-called
AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) compression. This type of compression not
only makes for smaller files but ones that some people say are equal to their
digital masters in sound quality. The only thing that you need to be aware of
is that when you purchase an iPod, you’re tied pretty heavily to the iTunes
music store (which is great in its own right), while the Roxio Easy Media
Creator software that you’ll be using to rip and burn your MP3 tracks is tied
heavily to the Napster music store.

The Care and Handling
of CD and DVD Discs
Earlier in this chapter when I was extolling the virtues of digital and telling
you why it’s king, I went so far as to claim that if stored properly digital data
should theoretically “last forever.” Well, when it comes to the most popular
forms of digital storage, CD and DVD discs, that statement is definitely an
exaggeration bordering on a blatant untruth.
Although disc manufacturers claim a life expectancy of up to 100 years for
their CD and DVD discs, you understand that this claim is not based on any
real experience (as CD and DVD disc media haven’t been around even half
that long). Some skeptics even worry that instead of a century of good use,
even CD and DVD discs stored under the most optimum conditions may not
have a life expectancy much beyond 5 to 10 years (a bit on the short side of
forever, I’d say).
With this lowball estimate comes a strong reminder to make multiple backup
copies of your CD and DVD discs, especially those that contain data vital to
your business. (And, of course, because Roxio’s Disc Copier application is
making this kind of disc backup so ridiculously easy that you now have no
excuse for not doing it.) Of course, regardless of how long the actual life
expectancy is for the CDs and DVDs that you create with the Easy Media
Creator, improper handling of these discs can drastically reduce it to nothing
at all (they’re only made of pretty thin plastic after all).
When it comes to the proper care and handling of your CD and DVD discs,
keep these important guidelines in mind:
 Always handle your discs by the outer edge or the center hole — avoid
touching the shiny surface of the disc where the laser reads the data at
all costs
 Keep dirt and dust and all other foreign material by storing your discs in
their jewel cases
 Always store your discs upright (like books on a shelf) in their cases
 Store your discs in a cool, dry, dark environment (they don’t take kindly
to extremes of temperature and humidity)
 Remove any dirt, fingerprints, smudges, and liquids from the shiny
bottom surface of your discs with a clean cotton cloth — always wipe in
a straight line from the center toward the outer edge and never with a
circular motion going around the disc
47
Chapter 2: The Ins and Outs of Digital Media and Gear

 Always use a non-solvent-based felt-tip permanent marker when marking
the label side of your discs (and, of course, never, ever write on the
shiny side which the laser reads)
 Remove stubborn dirt or gunk from the shiny, bottom surface of your
discs with CD/DVD-cleaning fluid or isopropyl alcohol if no commercial
cleaner is available
Most of you have the good sense to keep your hands off the shiny underside
of a CD or DVD disc, knowing full that if you mess up this surface, your disc is
toast. Unfortunately, many of you don’t realize that you can destroy your pre-
cious disc just as fast by messing with the topside of the disc where you put
the label. The truth is that this upper dye layer of a CD or DVD disc is actu-
ally the most sensitive part of the disc so that if you inadvertently scratch or
damage this layer, your data is cooked as good as if you’d taken a butcher
knife to the shiny underside! For this reason, it is not recommended that you
ever apply an adhesive label to your CD or DVD discs, as the adhesive disc
labels degrade rather quickly and if the label starts to peel off, it could take
part of the dye layer with it.
Despite the potential danger, I still cover using the Easy Media Creator’s great
Label Creator tool for making professional-looking CD and DVD disc labels in
Chapter 8. Just be aware that you’re better off labeling a disc that contains
important data that you want to last as long as possible with a non-solvent
felt-tip marking pen rather than applying a printed adhesive label.

Creating Data
Discs

In this part . . .
O
ne of the primary tasks that you’ll be doing in Easy
Media Creator is backing up the vast amounts of data
and media files that you accumulate on your computer
system. Chapter 3 of this part presents all the information
you need to use Creator Classic to create and burn these
backup discs. Chapter 4 gives you the lowdown on using
Easy Media Creator’s very handy Media Manager tool to
organize and manage these data files on your computer.
Taken together, Creator Classic and Media Manager make
it possible to finally get a handle on all that data you’re
sitting on and protect it from mishap.

 Making duplicates of your CD and DVD discs with Disc Copier
T
hanks to the advent of CD and DVD discs and their great capacity for
holding data (about 700MB for CD and an impressive 4.7GB for your aver-
age DVD), gone are any excuses for making disc backups of all your impor-
tant data. The Roxio Easy Media Creator offers you two different applications
for backing up the data you rely on all over your computer system. You can
use the quick-and-easy Drag-to-Disc utility to make data backup discs on the
fly or you can turn to Creator Classic when you want to create a data disc
project that you can save and reuse to make copies of important folders and
files. You can also use Creator Classic to create backup disc projects that
make scheduled backup copies of such files on a regular basis.
This chapter gives you all the information you need to use either application
for backing up your data. It also gives you some recommendations for which
type of CD or DVD disc you should use in different kinds of backup situations
(refer to Chapter 2 if you need a refresher in the differences between CD-R,
CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, and so on).

Drag-and-Drop Magic
Drag-to-Disc is the program to use when you need to make a onetime backup
of certain files and folders on your computer system. For example, suppose
you’ve used the Easy Media Creator Capture tool to capture a whole bunch of
video clips for later use in a DVD project with DVD Builder and want to back
them up on disc so that you can free up the hard disk space. As you’re not
going to be backing up the video files on a regular basis, Drag-to-Disc is the
perfect way to make the backup disc before deleting the video clips from
your hard disk.
As good as its name, to make a data disc with Drag-to-Disc all you have to do
is follow these easy steps:
1. Insert a blank CD or DVD disc in your computer’s CD or DVD drive.
Remember that you can’t put a DVD disc into a CD drive but that you
can put a CD disc into a DVD drive (see Chapter 2 for the reason).
2. Double-click the My Documents, My Computer, or My Network Places
icons to open them on your Windows desktop; then locate and select
the folders or files in them that you want copied onto the disc.
Remember that you can select multiple folders and files by holding the
Control key as you click their icons.
3. Drag the selected folders and files over to the Drag-to-Disc program
window and release the mouse button.
That’s all there is to it! If your CD or DVD disc needs formatting, the Drag-to-
Disc program alerts to this fact (and takes care of necessary formatting). If
your disc already has data on it (meaning you forgot to label it — shame on
you), Drag-to-Disc alerts you to this fact and gives you an opportunity to
replace it with a blank disc. If the disc is one of the rewritable types (see
Chapter 2), you can choose to add the selected folders and files (assuming
that they will all fit within the remaining free space) to the disc.
When the Drag-to-Disc application finishes copying the selected folders and
files to the target CD or DVD disc, the program automatically opens a window
for the disc showing you its new contents. If there’s additional space, you can
then add folders and files to the disc by dragging their icons either to this
open window or the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon. 
When you finish, be sure to eject the CD or DVD from its drive by clicking the
Eject button on the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon or by pressing Alt+J (for eJect)
after making the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon active rather than pressing the eject
button on your CD or DVD drive. That way, the Drag-to-Disc application has the
chance to prepare the disc for use in other computer drives. It also saves you
from having to reach around and physically press the drive’s eject button.
52
Part II: Creating Data Discs

Launching Drag-to-Disc on startup
Most of the time, you’ll want keep the Drag-to-Disc program icon (shown in
Figure 3-1) on your desktop so that it’s ready and available to do its backup
magic anytime you’re ready to feed it some files. With the installation of the
Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 suite, the setting to routinely launch the Drag-to-
Disc application whenever Windows starts up is automatically selected. This
means that you should be able to find the Drag-to-Disc desktop shown in
Figure 3-1 somewhere on your desktop.
If for some unknown reason you don’t have this desktop icon on your
Windows desktop after installing the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 software,
you can manually start Drag-to-Disc by following these four simple steps:
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar.
2. Position the mouse pointer on the All Programs item on the Start
menu to highlight it and open the All Programs submenu.
3. Position the mouse pointer on the Roxio item on the All Programs
menu to highlight it and open the Roxio submenu.
4. Click the Drag-to-Disc item on the Roxio submenu.
If the Easy Media Creator Home window is already open, you can forgo these
steps involving the Start menu altogether and start the Drag-to-Disc applica-
tion by clicking the Drag-to-Disc link near the bottom of the Applications
area. So too, you can manually start Drag-to-Disc by clicking its icon (shown
in the left margin of this paragraph) on the Systems Tray on the right side of
the Windows taskbar.

Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

By clicking the Drag-to-Disc icon in the Systems Tray on the Windows taskbar
when the Drag-to-Disc application is already running, you can display the
desktop icon on top of whatever window is currently obscuring your view of
it. Use this technique to redisplay the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon when it’s
hidden beneath a window holding the folders and files that you selected for
copying to the CD or DVD disc. That way, you can drag the selected folders
and files to the redisplayed Drag-to-Disc desktop icon without having to first
resize or close their window.
After manually starting the Drag-to-Disc application, you can ensure that it
automatically launches on each Windows startup by following these steps:
1. If the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon is not currently displayed, on the
Windows taskbar either click the Show Desktop icon in the Quick
Launch toolbar to minimize all open windows or click the Drag-to-Disc
icon in the Systems Tray to bring the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon to 
the top.
2. Right-click the Drag-to-Disc program icon on the Windows desktop.
The Drag-to-Disc shortcut menu opens.
3. Click the Settings item on the Drag-to-Disc shortcut menu or press
Alt+S.
The Drag-to-Disc Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 3-2, opens.
4. Click the Show Drag-to-Disc on Startup check box to put a checkmark
in its check box.
If you want to have the desktop icon always appear in the lower-right
corner of the Windows desktop, also put a checkmark in the Move to
Lower Right Corner of Desktop check box.
5. Click OK to close the Drag-to-Disc Settings dialog box and put your
new settings into effect.
You have to admit that compared to the other program icons on your
Windows desktop, the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon (which is technically a pro-
gram window and not an icon at all) is pretty large. You can, however, reduce
this window to a more manageable size. To do this, click the Drag-to-Disc
System tray icon to display the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon and then press
Alt+I (as in Icon View). Note that you can also reduce the icon by clicking the
Restore Down button — the one with the image of two windows, one in front
of the other — on the title bar of the Drag-to-Disc icon, but pressing Alt+I is
so much quicker and easier.
After you reduce the size of the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon, you can still use 
it to copy selected folders and files to a CD or DVD disc. Simply drag your
selected folders and files and then drop them onto this smaller version. If you
decide that it’s too much effort to drag stuff onto this smaller desktop icon,
you can enlarge it before doing your drag-and-drop operation by pressing
Alt+I a second time.
54
Part II: Creating Data Discs

Customizing other Drag-to-Disc settings
You may have noticed in Figure 3-2 that the Drag-to-Disc Settings dialog box
controls more than just when and where the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon is dis-
played on your Windows desktop. In addition, this dialog box contains a bunch
of Eject, File Type and Administrator settings that you can modify along with a
check box that turns on disc compression and a button that resets all your
“Don’t Show Me Again” alert dialog boxes that sometimes pop up when using
the Drag-to-Disc application.
In this dialog box, you can choose among these Eject settings:
 Use the Disc in this Computer Only: Choose this option button only
when you’re sure that the backup CD or DVD disc will be used in only in
this computer’s drive or a computer that uses the very same version of
the Drag-to-Disc application
 Use the Disc on Other Computers or Devices: Keep this option button
selected whenever there’s a chance that you’ll use the backup CD or

option button and the default This Disc Will Be Used on Other Computers
or Devices option button before physically ejecting the disc
 Advanced Eject Settings: Opens an Advanced Eject Settings dialog box
where you can individually modify the settings for non-rewritable and
rewritable discs that determine which version of UDF (Universal Disk
Format) is used (a standard designed to make optical media as compati-
ble in various systems as possible) and whether or not ISO/Joliet setting
is used (enabling Macintosh systems to recognize the long filenames
from a Windows’ disc — normally you won’t have to fiddle around with
these settings as the they’re already set to make your discs as readable
as possible by diverse computer systems)
In addition to the Display Settings and Eject Settings, the Drag-to-Disc Settings
dialog box also enables you to change the File Type Handling Settings and the
Administrator Settings. By default, all of the File Type Handling Settings prompt
you only with the options for a particular file type (such as audio files saved as
MP3, WAV, WMA, or OGG files or graphic images saved as BMP, JPG, or TIF files,
and the like) when you add that type of file to the disc. 
Changing the File Type Handling Settings
If you want to predetermine how Drag-to-Disc handles a particular type of file
when you add that type of file to the disc, click the File Type Handling button
in the Drag-to-Disc Settings dialog box. Drag-to-Disc then opens the Default
File Type Handling dialog box (shown in Figure 3-3). Then, click the drop-
down button for the particular type of file (Audio Files, MP3 Files, Photos or
Images, and so on) and click the appropriate option on its drop-down menu.

Part II: Creating Data Discs

For example, if you click the drop-down button to the right of Audio Files, you
can choose between the following two handling options:
 Send the Files to Creator Classic to Make an Audio CD
 Send the Files to Drag-to-Disc to Make a Data CD
The handling options for the other file types listed in the Default File Type
Handling dialog box are similar except that they target the Easy Media Creator
application designed to deal with that particular type of file in addition to
sending the files to Drag-to-Disc to make a data disc (so that the Video Clips
option enables you to send the files to DVD Builder to make a video disc).
Changing the Administrator Settings (if you dare)
When you click the Administrator Settings button in the Drag-to-Disc Settings
dialog box, an Administrator Settings dialog box appears with the following
four check box options:
 Verify RW Media on Full Format (checked by default) to have Drag-to-
Disc double check rewritable media (CD-RW, CD+RW, DVD-RW, and
DVD+RW) for errors when fully formatting the disc
 Verify Recording Using Read After Write to have Drag-to-Disc verify the
data it burns to disc by comparing it to the original data on your hard
disc (selecting this option slows down the recording process but ensures
greater data fidelity)
 Enable EasyWrite (MRW) Support (checked by default) to be able to
perform a quick format of a rewritable disc on an EasyWrite recorder
(also known as Mt.Rainier, this refers to types of CD and DVD recorders
that use a standard developed by Philips for recording CD-RW and
DVD+RW discs)
 Use UDF 2.0 Instead of 1.5 (For DVD Only) to burn the disc using an
older, less compatible version of UDF (Universal Disc Format) — select
this option only when you are using Drag-to-Disc to burn a DVD-R for
playback in a consumer DVD recorder 
For heaven’s sake, don’t go messing with these settings unless you know
what you’re doing or you’re told to make changes to them by someone who
does (or who you can blame if your data discs no longer work in the com-
pany’s computers). Changing these settings may not only degrade the perfor-
mance of these discs to a crawl but make them incompatible with different
computer systems used in your organization!
57
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Turning on disc compression
The last option on the Drag-to-Disc Settings dialog box (besides the Reset All
“Don’t Show Me Again” Check Boxes button that enables you to reactivate
the display of all those lovely alert dialog boxes) is the Turn On Compression
check box. When you click this check box option to put a checkmark in it,
Drag-to-Disc automatically compresses all of the files that you drop on its
desktop icon as it burns them to disc. This is great in that it reduces the size
of each of the files you add, enabling you to add more files to a given disc. 
Using compression does, however, mean that Windows computers which
aren’t running the latest copy of Drag-to-Disc won’t be able to decompress
and read the files unless the computer has a copy of the UDF (Universal Disc
Format) reader installed on it. It also means that computers not running the
Windows operating system (such as Macs and computers running under
UNIX or LINUX) won’t be able to decompress and read the files. Keep these
limitations in mind when making discs for coworkers or clients who may not
be so fortunate as to have the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 suite or the UDF
reader installed on their Windows systems or don’t run Windows at all.
Also keep in mind that you can use the compression option when making a
disc with an EasyWrite recorder.
Manually formatting a blank disc
Although Drag-to-Disc will automatically prompt you to format any blank disc
as soon as you attempt to add folders or files to it, you can also manually
format the disc before you start dragging-and-dropping your files. To do this,
insert the blank CD or DVD disc in the appropriate computer drive; then
follow these steps:
1. If the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon is not already displayed on your 
computer, click the Drag-to-Disc icon on the taskbar’s System Tray to
display it.
2. Right-click the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon and then click Format Disc
on its shortcut menu or press Alt+F.
The Drag-to-Disc Format Options dialog box shown in Figure 3-4
appears.
3. Click the Volume Label text box and enter a descriptive volume label
for your new disc.
Volume labels appear at the bottom of the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon
after the drive letter. When entering a volume label, keep in mind that
they can be no longer than 11 characters total and can’t contain spaces
or any of the following characters: 
58

\(backslash)
/ (forward slash)
: (colon)
; (semicolon)
* (asterisk)
? (question mark)
“ (double quotes)
< (less than)
> (greater than)
| (vertical bar)
+ (plus sign)
= (equal sign)
. (period)
, (comma)
[ (open square brace)
] (close square brace)
4. Click the Enable Compression on This Disc check box if you want to
compress all the files you add to the formatted disc.
Keep in mind the limitations on using compression (listed under the
Remember icon in the preceding section) before you select this option. 
5. If you’re formatting a rewritable disc and you want to do a full rather
than a quick format, click the Full Format the Entire Disc Before Using
It option button.
Selecting this option button automatically deselects the default Quick
Format Allows You to Begin Using the Disc Quickly option button.
6. Click the OK button to begin formatting your blank disc.
Instead of deleting the contents on a previously recorded disc that is rewritable
(such as CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM), you can completely get rid
of all its files by manually formatting it using these same steps for manually for-
matting a blank disc. Just be sure that you don’t want any of the files on the
rewritable disc before you manually reformat it, as there’s no way to retrieve
files after a disc has been reformatted.
59
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

You can use the Drag-to-Disc program’s Rename Disc command to change the
volume label for your CD or DVD disc. Make the program’s desktop icon
active; then right-click it and click the Rename Disc command on its shortcut
menu or press Alt+R. Then replace the existing volume label with a new name
(following the guidelines pointed out following Step 3 in the preceding steps)
in the Name for Disc text box in the Drag-to-Disc Rename Disc dialog box
before you click OK. 
Note that renaming a disc’s volume label in this manner does not change the
disc name that appears on the title bar of any window you open on the disc
with the Windows Explorer; the original volume label which gives rise to the
disc name continues to be associated with this disc according to Windows.
The new volume label does appear, however, in the Label text box if you open
a Properties dialog box for the disc.
Also, the new volume name that you give the disc does not appear at the
bottom of the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon until the next time you insert the disc
in the drive. This is because ejecting and re-inserting the disc in the drive is the
only way to force the Drag-to-Disc application to read the new volume label and
display it in the desktop icon (in other words, there’s no refresh button as in
your Web browser).
Editing a data disc
After you copy files to a CD or DVD disc using Drag-to-Disc, you can use those
files just as you would any files saved on your computer’s hard disk or disks
to which you have access on a network. The biggest question in editing a
backup CD or DVD created with Drag-to-Disc is whether the disc is of the
rewritable or nonrewritable type.

60
Part II: Creating Data Discs

Although you can theoretically edit the contents of either type of disc, keep
in mind that only rewritable discs actually update the disc contents to reflect
your changes. Therefore, practically speaking, the editing of a rewritable can
include reformatting the disc so that you can entirely replace its contents
rather piecemeal editing of its folders and files.
Displaying the properties of a data disc
Before you start editing the contents of a data disc, especially before adding
new files to it, you’ll probably want to get the basic statistics on the disc,
including whether the disc is rewritable or nonrewritable or how much disc
space is used and how much is free. The easiest way to get this information is
to follow these steps:
1. Put the backup CD or DVD disc in the appropriate computer drive.
2. If the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon is not already displayed on your 
computer, click the Drag-to-Disc icon on the taskbar’s System Tray to
display it.
3. Right-click the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon and then click Disc
Properties on its shortcut menu or press Alt+O (for PrOperties).
Drag-to-Disc opens a Disc Properties dialog box similar to the one shown in
Figure 3-5. Note in this figure that in addition to getting basic stats on the disc
(including its type, total capacity, and used and free space), you can also
change its volume name in it Label text box.

61
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Displaying the contents of a data disc
The easiest way to perform routine editing operations on a data disc (such as
adding, updating, or deleting files) is to open a window showing its contents
and then manipulate the file icons in this window. To display the contents of
CD or DVD disc, make the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon active and then right-click
it and click View Disc Contents on its shortcut menu or press Alt+V (for View).
Drag-to-Disc then responds by opening a separate disc window showing all the
folders and files that you’ve copied on it. Because this is a standard Windows
Explorer window, you can manipulate its contents much as you would a window
showing the contents of your computer’s hard disk or any disk to which you
have access on your network.
You can click the Details button at the bottom of the left panel of a window
showing a data disc’s contents to display the total capacity and free space on
that disc instead of having to resort to using the Drag-to-Disc program’s Disc
Properties option to get this information.
Copying files from a data disc
After the folders and files on the data disc are displayed in its own window,
you can then perform standard file operations on them such as cutting and
copying their files to your computer’s hard disk or disks that are available to
you on your network. 
To copy folders or particular files from the CD or DVD data disc to another
disk on your computer system disk, open a window for its disk on your hard
disk and then simply select and drag the icons for the folders or files you
want to copy over to that window. To copy selected files into a particular
folder on the computer disk, drop their files on the particular folder into
which they’re to be copied.
To cut files from the CD or DVD data disc that you can then copy onto one 
of your computer’s disks, open a window with the data disc’s files and then
select their folder and file icons before you press Ctrl+X (you can also do this
by selecting Edit➪Cut on the disc window’s menu bar). After cutting the files
from the data disc, you can insert them one of your computer’s disks by
making its window active and then selecting Edit➪Paste on its menu or by
pressing Ctrl+V.
If you cut folders or files from nonrewritable CD or DVD discs (see Chapter 2
for a list), their names are removed from the disc, but the space they take up
on the disc is not recovered. When, however, you cut folders or files from a
rewritable CD or DVD disc, the space they took up is recovered and you can
reuse by copying new files in their place. After all is said and done, this ability
to reuse the space from file you’ve cut or deleted from the disc is the essential
difference between a rewritable and nonrewritable CD and DVD disc.
62
Part II: Creating Data Discs

Deleting files from a data disc
The story on deleting disc files or replacing them with newer, updated versions
is pretty much the same as when cutting files from the disc. To delete files from
a CD or DVD data disc, open its window, select the files’ icons, and press the
Delete key or choose Edit➪Delete on the disc window’s menu bar.
When you delete files from a rewritable disc, their filenames are not only
removed from the disc, but the file space they occupied is recovered on the
disc. When, however, you delete them from a nonrewritable disc, their file-
names are removed from the disc (rendering them impossible to access) but
their file space is not recovered for later reuse.
Files that you delete from a data CD or DVD are not placed in your com-
puter’s Recycle Bin. Therefore, when you press the Delete key or choose
Delete on the window’s Edit menu, the files are gone for good. This means
that you need to be really careful to not select files that you really don’t want
to delete, especially if you don’t have copies of the files saved elsewhere.
You can use the Drag-to-Disc program’s Erase Disc option (Alt+E) to delete all
the files on a data disc. However, keep in mind that erasing all the files does not
actually remove their data from the disc. Instead, this option removes only the
list of folder and filenames on it. This means that it is possible for someone to
reconstruct the list and have access to some or all of the disc’s contents. If the
disc contains extremely sensitive data, you’re much safer physically destroying
the disc so that it can never be read again (you can do this most easily by peel-
ing off the disc’s label, rendering it completely unreadable). 
If your goal is to reuse the disc for backing up files, you’re better off reformat-
ting the disc (see “Manually formatting a blank disc” earlier in this chapter
for details) and before copying new files, provided that you’re using a
rewritable disc.
Replacing files on a data disc
You can replace files on a backup CD or DVD disc by dragging file icons with
the same filenames and dropping them onto the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon 
or the CD or DVD disc’s open window. When you do this, Microsoft Windows
opens a Confirm File Replace dialog box that gives you the opportunity not 
to go ahead with overwriting a particular file with one of the same name by
clicking the No instead of the Yes button. If do click the Yes button, Windows
replaces the identically named disc file with the one you’ve dragged onto the
Drag-to-Disc desktop icon or into the CD or DVD disc window.
When you replace a file on a rewritable disc, the original file is deleted and only
the new replacement file takes its place. When dealing with a nonrewritable
disc, however, only the name of the original file is removed from the disc so
that both the data in the original and replacement file remains on the disc,
taking up twice the space.
63
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Repairing discs with ScanDisc
ScanDisc is a great little utility that’s part of the Drag-to-Disc application. It
enables you often to repair CD or DVD data discs whose files have become
corrupted and somehow rendered unreadable. To start the ScanDisc utility 
to scan a CD or DVD data disc for errors and then, possibly try to fix them,
make the Drag-to-Disc desktop icon active and then right-click the icon and
click Launch ScanDisc on its shortcut menu.
When you select the Launch ScanDisc option at the bottom of the Drag-to-Disc
shortcut menu, the ScanDisc dialog box appears. Click the Scan button to have
the program check your CD or DVD data disc for errors. The ScanDisc dialog
box then changes to display its progress in checking the disc. When the utility
finishes checking the entire contents of the data disc, a new dialog box show-
ing files that have been pegged as damaged or lost (lost files are those that
don’t have filenames associated with them) may appear. Of course, if you’re
so lucky as to have a disc with no problems, no further dialog box appears
and you can click the Finish button to close the ScanDisc program and go on
your merry way.
If you do receive an indication of problems in the form of a File Recovery
dialog box listing the damaged or lost files that are considered recoverable,
you should take steps to copy these files to another destination on your hard
disk before taking the final step of having ScanDisc try to repair the disc.
That way, you’ll have the data files intact even if ScanDisc can’t repair the
damaged disc.
To copy the recoverable or lost files (which are given sequential numerical
filenames when they’re copied that you can then later change), click the Yes
button in the dialog box and then select the drive and folder that will serve
as the place to which the damaged or lost files are copied in the Destination
Drive drop-down list box.
When selecting the destination drive, you can select any local drive on your
computer except for the one that contains the CD or DVD disc that you’re
scanning for errors. Also note that you’re computer is part of a network; you
can’t copy the recoverable or lost files to any drive or folder on the network
unless that drive or folder has previously been mapped as such, meaning
that it’s been assigned its own drive letter between A and Z (to do this, open
the My Documents Window and then choose Tools➪Map Network Drive and
follow the prompts in Map Network Drive dialog box).
After designating the destination drive, you then designate the folder on that
drive into which you want the recoverable files copied (do this by selecting
the folder in the Destination Folder list or by clicking the New Folder button
64
Part II: Creating Data Discs

and creating a new folder). After indicating the drive and folder location, click
the Copy button in the File Recovery dialog box to begin copying the files.
When the copies are made, click the Done button.
After enabling you to copy and recover damaged and lost files to another
location on your computer system, the ScanDisc utility then prompts you to
attempt to repair the damaged disc to make it once again usable. Click the
Yes button when the program asks you if you want to repair the disc; then
click the Done button when the ScanDisc program finishes this operation
(including checking the integrity of the files).
ScanDisc is not able to repair all damaged discs. You may find that even after
attempting to repair a data disc, the disc is still unreadable in your computer’s
drive. You may also find that after repairing a disc, both Drag-to-Disc and
Windows can no longer access the files on it. For this reason, be sure that
your data disc is essentially a disc which backs up data that you also have
elsewhere and from which you can generate a new backup CD or DVD.
Turning to Creator Classic 
for Your Backups
Creator Classic is the application you want to turn to when you need to make
CD or DVD data discs on a regular basis from particular sets of data files or
when you want to make a CD or DVD disc that mixes both audio tracks and
data files. To start Creator Classic from the Easy Media Creator Home
window, click the Copy Files to Disc link in the Data column or the Creator
Classic link in the Applications area. If the Easy Media Creator Home window
is already open, you can launch Creator Classic by clicking the Start button
on the Windows taskbar, highlighting All Programs on the Start submenu,
Roxio on the All Programs submenu, and clicking Creator Classic on the
Roxio submenu.
Whichever way you choose to launch this application, after you do, the
Creator Classic window shown in Figure 3-6 appears on your screen. As you
can see in this figure, the Creator Classic window is divided into three areas:
the Tasks pane on the left side where you indicate the type of project to
create, the Select Source pane on the upper right where you locate the files
you want to backup, and the Data Disc Project pane on the lower right which
shows you all the files you add to the project.
65
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Opening a new disc project
When you first launch Creator Classic, the program is set to start a new data
disc project, that is, a disc that contains only data files. If this is the kind of
project that you need to make, all you need to do is start locating the files in
the Select Source pane and then add them to Data Project pane.
Data disc projects are not the only ones supported by Creator Classic. In
addition to the default Data Disc project, you can create the following audio
projects as well:
 Audio CDs that contain only audio tracks for playback in any CD player
(see Chapter 8 for details)

Part II: Creating Data Discs

 MP3 Discs that contain only audio tracks saved in the MP3 codec for
playback in CD and DVD players capable of playing MP3s (see Chapter 8
for details)
 Enhanced CDs that contain two sessions, the first consisting of audio
tracks and the second consisting of data files for playback of the music
in any CD player and the music and data in standard CD-ROM disc drives
 Mixed-Mode CDs that consists of a single session that contains both a
track of computer data followed by one or more audio tracks for play-
back only in CD-ROM drives and recorders
Note that the big difference among the different types of projects in this list is
whether or not they play audio tracks only or can deal with playing both audio
tracks and some form of data file (such as a video clips). Because Audio CD
and MP3 Disc projects consist of only audio tracks, you find information on cre-
ating these types in Chapter 8 in Part III on Creating Audio and Photo CDs.
Don’t get confused by all this talk about Audio, Enhanced, and Mixed-Mode
CDs into thinking that your Data Disc projects can only consist of standard
data file types like those that contain text, financial data, graphic images, and
the like. If your intention is to back up the music and video clips on a CD or
DVD disc (as opposed to playing them in sequence on a standalone CD or DVD
player), you can add any of these file types as data files to your data disc pro-
ject (provided that the file type is not specifically excluded in the data disc
project settings — see “Changing the Data Disc Project Settings” later in this
chapter for details). Just keep in mind that the audio or video files saved to
the resulting CD or DVD disc that you burn from the Data Disc project can
only be accessed by computer programs such as the Windows Media Player
when the disc is placed in your CD-ROM drive.
The Enhanced and Mixed-Mode CD projects create the two types of so-called
hybrid CD discs. Enhanced CDs are more versatile because you can play their
music in a standard Audio CD player and their data files in your computer’s
CD-ROM drive. They are often used to mix music tracks that can be played in
audio CD players with an accompanying music video (that you can create in
DVD Builder — see Chapter 11) that can be played only in your computer’s
CD-ROM drive. Mixed-Mode CDs, although limited to CD-ROM drives, are
great for putting together educational and entertainment CDs whose subject
matter naturally combines both data files and audio tracks.
Because both Enhanced and Mixed-Mode CD projects involve adding audio
and data files (although in different ways), you find information on starting
them and adding the data files to them in the following sections and informa-
tion on adding their audio tracks in Chapter 8.
67
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

To open either an Enhanced or Mixed-Mode CD project, click the Expand
button (the one with the two arrowheads pointing downward one over the
other) to right of Advanced Projects in the Tasks pane on the left side of the
Creator Classic window. The expanded Advanced Projects area contains the
following three links:
 Enhanced CD to open a new Enhanced CD project in the Project pane
 Mixed-Mode CD to open a new Mixed-Mode CD project in the Project
pane
 Bootable Disc to create bootable CD or DVD disc, that is, one that con-
tains enough Windows system information to enable you to start your
computer from the disc rather than your computer’s hard disk (see
“Making a bootable data disc” later in this chapter)
When you click the Enhanced CD link, the Project pane changes from Data
Disc Project – Untitled to Enhanced CD Project – Untitled and an Audio Project
icon appears above Data Project icon (reflecting the serial number default
disc name that appears in the Disc Name text box) in the work area below. 
When you click the Mixed-Mode CD link instead, the Project pane changes
from Data Disc Project – Untitled to Mixed-Mode CD Project – Untitled and
the Data Project icon (with the serial number disc name) appears above an
Audio Project icon in the work area below.
To add data files to a new Enhanced or Mixed-Mode CD project, you just have
to be sure that the Data Project icon is selected (indicated by highlighting) —
if the icon is not currently selected, you need to click it to select and high-
light it. Then you’re set to start adding the data files as described in “Adding
data files to a new project” later in this chapter.
Changing the Data Disc Project Settings
When you start a new Data Disc project, Creator Classic applies certain
default settings that you may want to review and possibly change before you
start adding files to the project. To review and change the Data Disc Project
Settings, click the View and Edit Your Project Settings button to the immedi-
ate left of the Burn button (one of the few labeled buttons) at the top of the
Project pane. The Project Properties dialog box shown in Figure 3-7 then
appears with its three tabs: General, Advanced, and Exclude File Types.
68
Part II: Creating Data Discs

In addition to displaying information about the type of disc and the number
of files and used space currently in the project, the General tab contains the
following options that you can modify:
 Volume Name to change the volume label or name of the disc
 File System to choose between three file systems: ISO9660 (for discs 
to be used on diverse platforms including DOS, UNIX, Macs, OS/2, and
Windows), Joliet (to support the use of filenames up to 64 characters
long — ISO filenames are restricted to the DOS 8.3 naming system), and
UDF 102 (for optical discs such as DVDs, especially when burning files
larger than 1GB)
 Bridge to choose between ISO9660 Bridge (to support the UDF and Joliet
file system), Joliet Bridge (to support the Joliet, UDF, and ISO file system),
and No Bridge (to support no file system other than the one currently
selected)
 Validate Source Files Before Recording when you want Creator Classic 
to verify that none of the source files have been moved, deleted, renamed,
or otherwise modified since you added them (if Creator Classic does find
such a file, it prompts you to remove the file from the Disc Project)
 Automatically Verify File System After Recording to have Creator
Classic compare the files burned to the CD with the original source files
on your computer system
Figure 3-7:

69
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

You can’t use the ISO9660 file system for any project that you intend to
encrypt (see “Encrypting the data disc” later in this chapter) for any project
that spans more than one disc (see “Burning a multi-disc data project” later
in this chapter).
Note that if you want the modifications you make to these settings on the
General tab to be new Data Disc default settings, click Set as Default button 
at the bottom of the this tab.
The settings on the Advanced tab of the Project Properties dialog box enable
you to record various vital statistics about the disc’s content such as the name
of the disc’s publisher and the name of the text file that contains the copyright
information and to determine which date to use as the disc’s publishing date.
Click the Advanced tab to review and change any of these settings: 
 Publisher Name to enter the name of the publisher (up to 64 characters
long when using the Joliet file system and 128 when using the ISO9660
file system)
 Prepared By to enter the name of the person or company who prepared
the disc (up to 64 characters long when using the Joliet file system and
128 when using the ISO9660 file system)
 Copyright to enter or browse for the name of the text file that contains
the disc’s copyright information (Creator Classic adds this text file to
the root directory of the disc when you burn it)
 Abstract to enter or browse for the name of the text file that contains
the a description or list of the disc’s contents (Creator Classic adds this
text file to the root directory of the disc when you burn it)
 Bibliography to enter or browse for the name of the text file that contains
the bibliographic information about the disc’s content (Creator Classic
adds this text file to the root directory of the disc when you burn it)
 Use Original File Date option button to time stamp the disc with the
date that the disc project is started (this is the date shown in the combo
box to the immediate right of the date options)
 Use Date When Disc is Written option button to time stamp the disc
with the date when you burn the disc
 Use This Date option button to time stamp the disc with the date you
select (when you click this button, the date combo box to the right
becomes active and you can type in a new date or click the drop-down
button and select one on the pop-up calendar that appears)
The Exclude File Types tab on the Project Properties dialog box enables you
to indicate what types of data files should not be added to the disc project.
Any file types that you indicate on this settings tab are automatically not
copied to the Project pane even when you’ve inadvertently selected them for
adding in the Select Source pane. When you click the Exclude tab, the Project
70
Part II: Creating Data Discs

Properties dialog box displays a list of all the individual file types you can
keep out in the Add Files area. To exclude a particular type of file, simply
click its check box to add a checkmark to it.
Below the Add Files area on the Exclude tab you find the following two check
boxes and button:
 Exclude All Hidden Files to automatically exclude all hidden files in any
group that you select in the Select Source pane
 Exclude All System Files to automatically exclude all system files in any
group that you select in the Select Source pane
 Select/Clear All button that you can click to select all the file types in
the Add Files area or, alternately, deselect them if they are currently all
selected
When you finish changing all the settings on the Project Properties dialog
box, click OK to close this dialog box and put your modifications into effect.
Titling the disc project
The first thing you may want to do after starting a new disc project is replace
the temporary title that Creator Classic automatically assigns your project
(that serial-number type volume label that appears in the Disc Name text box
at the top of the Project pane) with a volume label of your own. To do this, drag
through the serial-number type name in the Disc Name text box to select it and
then type in your replacement volume label. When naming the disc project,
you need to follow the naming guidelines outlined in the steps on manually for-
matting a disc for use with Drag-to-Disc (see “Manually formatting a blank disc”
earlier in this chapter).
After you type in the new volume label name in the Disc Name, this new name
automatically appears to the right of the Data Project icon in the work area of
the Project pane below.
Adding data files to a disc project
When adding files to your disc project, you have a choice between two simi-
lar methods:
 Using the drag-and-drop method to drag selected files from the Source
pane and drop them on the Data Project portion in the Project pane
 Select the files in the Source pane and then click the Add Selected Files
Above to Project button and have Creator Classic add them to the
Project pane for you
71
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

I happen to prefer the second method in adding the initial chunk of data files
to a new project that are usually located in a common folder. I then find that
later on I tend to rely on the first method to add an individual file or groups
of files from diverse folders to the project.
When you use the drag-and-drop method to add files to a disc project, you
don’t have to be concerned about where you drop the files in the Project
pane. Creator Classic automatically adjusts the list of data files to display all
them all in strict alphabetical order of their filenames.
As you add data files to the Project pane, Creator Classic not only displays a
list of their filenames but also indicates the current estimated size of the pro-
ject and the free space remaining (both in terms of MB or GB free and in form
of the slider that appears about these stats as shown in Figure 3-8). You can
use these statistics to roughly gauge how many more files you can still add to
the project.
Locating files you want to add to your project
If you’re not exactly sure where the data files that you need to add to your
project are located on your computer system, you can use the Windows XP
Search Results feature to find them. To open the Windows Search Results
window, click the Search for Files button at the top of the Select Source pane.
When the Search Results window opens, you can use its search features to
locate just the files that meet your search criteria.
Figure 3-8:
As you add
data files to
a project,
their
filenames
appear in
the Project
pane along
with the
estimated
project size.
72
Part II: Creating Data Discs

You can also use the navigation tree in the Select Source pane to explore the
contents of drives and folders on your computer system when trying to locate
the files you want to add to a project. To expand a drive or folder in the tree
so that its contents appear in its display area to the immediate right, click its
icon’s Expand button (the one with the plus sign).
To explore the contents of any folders that you add to the data portion of
your project, click its folder icon in the Project pane’s navigation tree. Creator
Classic then displays its contents in the display to its right. 
When exploring the contents of any subfolder in either the Select Source
pane’s or the Project pane’s navigation tree, remember that you can always
go back up one level to display the contents of the folder which contains it by
simply by clicking the Go Up One Level button in the appropriate pane (it is
the first button on each pane’s toolbar).
Removing files from your project
If you find that you’ve added files to your data disc project in error, you can
easily remove them from the project. Select their filenames in the Project
pane and then click the Remove from Project button at the top of the pane.
Creator Classic then displays a Warning alert dialog box asking you if you’re
sure that you want to remove the selected file(s) from the project. To go
ahead and remove the files, click the Yes button. If you’re not sure that you
want to remove the files, click the No button instead. 
Keep in mind as well that deleting files from a data disc project only removes
them from the Project pane. It does not remove them from your hard disk, so
you have no worries should you delete a file from a data project in error. You
can always re-add it to the Project pane from its folder on the hard disk in the
Source pane.
Encrypting the data disc
If your data disc project contains sensitive data such as personnel records or
corporate financial data, you can encrypt and password-protect the CD or
DVD so that only those who have the password can decrypt the data and gain
access to its files. Just be careful when using this encryption and password-
protection feature as you must know the password exactly as you entered it in
order to be able to decrypt the disc files (don’t lose that password or the data
is as good as gone!). Also be aware that the only way to decrypt an encrypted
disc so that you can open the data files and have access to their data is by
using the Roxio Retrieve utility to retrieve the files to your computer’s hard
disk (see “Recovering Data with Roxio Retrieve” later in this chapter).
73
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

Technically speaking, you can encrypt the files on a data disc without pass-
word protecting the disc. In such a case, anyone to whom you distribute the
disc must still use Roxio Retrieve to be able to read the files, although they
could do so without having to worry about a password. In my view, if the files
on the data disc are sensitive enough to encrypt their data, the disc should
surely be password-protected as well.
To encrypt the files for the data disc project you’re building in Creator
Classic, you follow these steps:
1. Click the Set Encryption Settings for Your Project button on Project
pane’s toolbar.
Creator Classic then opens the Encryption dialog box similar to the one
shown in Figure 3-9.
2. Click the Enable File Encryption (128 bit) check box.
This turns on the file encryption that requires the use of the Roxio
Retrieve utility to decrypt.
3. To password-protect the disc, click the Password text box, and then
enter a password of at least six characters.
In order to complete the password-protection of the disc, you must now
re-enter the password in the Re-enter Password text box exactly as you
originally entered it in the Password text box.
4. Press Tab or click the Re-enter Password text box and then re-type the
password exactly as you originally entered it in the Password text box.
If you wish, you can hide the display of the filenames on the data disc 
as well as prevent their use by any unauthorized parties by performing
Step 5. If you don’t perform Step 5, anyone can get a list of the filenames
on the disc using the Windows explorer (or some program like it) but
they still can’t open any of the files without being able to correctly repro-
duce the password and then using Roxio Retrieve to copy the encrypted
files to their computer’s hard disk.
5. (Optional) Click the Hide File Names on Disc check box to block the
display of the filenames in any Windows directory listing.
6. Click the OK button to close the Encryption dialog box and put your
encryption settings into effect.
74
Part II: Creating Data Discs

Making a bootable data disc
Creator Classic makes it possible to create a bootable CD-ROM disc. A bootable
disc in essence emulates a 1.44 floppy disk drive (the so-called A: floppy drive
that is so often missing from today’s computers, especially in laptops which
are normally configured with only a CD or DVD disc drive) and that contains
the Windows system files necessary to boot your computer. Such a disc enables
you to boot your computer from your computer’s CD or DVD drive in the event
that you experience some kind of glitch with your computer’s hard disk that
prevents it from using its own Windows system files.
Before you can use Creator Classic to create a bootable disc, you have to
ascertain that your computer system’s BIOS settings support this feature.
While most computers based on the Pentium-class computer chip support
this feature, you may still have to check your computer documentation to
learn how to access your system’s BIOS settings and whether or not you have
actually enabled a bootable CD-ROM option.
If your CD or DVD drive is connected to your computer via a SCSI host adapter,
it may have its own BIOS. You still need to check the drive’s documentation to
verify that the SCSI adapter supports the bootable CD-ROM feature and, if so,
how to activate it for your drive.
Assuming that your system supports the bootable CD-ROM feature and that
you have activated it for your computer, you can then create a bootable
CD-ROM using these steps:

75
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

1. Place a blank CD-ROM into your computer’s CD or DVD drive.
Make sure that this is a new CD-R disc and not one that you’ve burned
before and then later on erased.
2. Launch Creator Classic and then click the Advanced Projects Expand
button to display the three advanced projects in the Tasks pane on the
left side of the Creator Classic window.
The three advanced projects are Enhanced CD, Mixed-Mode CD, and the
one you want to use, Bootable Disc.
3. Click the Bootable Disc link in the Advanced Projects area.
The Choose Type of Bootable Disc dialog box shown in Figure 3-10
opens where you select between generating the disc from an existing
floppy disk or from a boot image file that’s installed on your computer’s
hard disk when you install the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7.
4. If you have a bootable 1.44 MB floppy disk that you want used in
making the bootable CD-ROM, click the Generate Image from Floppy
option button. Otherwise, leave the Use Existing Image File option
button selected and then click the Browse button and locate the boot
image file on your hard disk.
If you click the Generate Image from Floppy option, you must insert the
disk in your computer’s floppy drive before you click OK in the Choose
Type of Bootable Disc dialog box. 
If you leave the Use Existing Image File option selected but don’t want to
use the boot image file supplied by Roxio, click the Browse button to its
immediate right and then locate and select the image file you want to use.
5. Click the OK button at the bottom of the Choose Type of Bootable Disc
dialog box to close it and have Creator Classic format your CD-ROM
disc and copy the bootable system files to it.
If you use the Generate Image from Floppy option, an alert dialog box
appears prompting you to insert the disk in your computer’s A: drive. Click
OK to have Creator Classic continue with preparing the disc and copying the
necessary files.
After preparing and copying the system files to your CD-ROM disc, Bootable
Disc Project – Untitled appears at the top of the Project pane and you can
then use Creator Classic to add any additional files that you want burned
onto the disc (for example, you might want to add hard disk utilities, applica-
tion installers, or other backup utilities to the disc in addition to the boot
image files).
76
Part II: Creating Data Discs

If you want to access information on your computer from your bootable disc
(beyond just starting up the system), be sure to add these files to your
Bootable Disc Project. These include the following:
 mscdex.exe
 cdrom.sys
 Device drivers for your computer’s CD and/or DVD drives
After burning the files you add to your Bootable Disc Project (see “Saving the
disc project and burning the disc” that immediately follows for details, you 
need to test out your bootable CD-ROM. To do this, restart your computer while
the CD-ROM is still in your CD or DVD drive (by clicking the Start button on the
Windows taskbar, the Turn Off Computer item on the Start menu and the Restart
button in the Turn Off Computer dialog box). If your computer starts from the
CD-ROM rather than from your computer’s hard disk, your bootable CD-ROM
has all the information it needs to start your system in case of any hard disk
problems. Of course, this means that you have now to remove the CD-ROM from
your CD or DVD drive to resume normal startup from the hard disk.
Saving the disc project and burning the disc
After you add all the files you want to your disc project, you can save it so
that you can use it at a later time to burn additional CD or DVD discs without
having to go through all that creation rigmarole all over again. To save the
project you’re working on:

Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

1. Choose File➪Save Project on the Creator Classic menu bar or press
Ctrl+S.
The standard Windows Save As dialog box appears where you can select
the drive and folder in which to save the project and the filename under
which to save the project.
2. Indicate the drive and folder where you want to save the project with
the Save In combo box.
3. Replace Untitled in the File Name text box with the filename you want
to use (just don’t delete the .rcl filename extension).
4. Click the Save button to close the Save As dialog box and save your
project settings on your hard disk.
Note when you save the project, Creator Classic doesn’t actually save the files
in the project on your hard disk. This means that if you want to use the project
again a later time to burn a disc, the files in the project must be in the same
folders and disk locations as they were at the time you saved the project.
To burn the CD or DVD by copying the files in your project, all you have to do
is click the Burn button on the right side of the Creator Classic toolbar. When
you click this button, the Roxio Creator Classic - Burn Progress dialog box
appears, giving you Project Summary and Device Summary statistics. To burn
the disc using these stats, click the Burn button.
If, however, you want to change any of these settings (such as the destination
device or the write speed), click the >>Details button at the bottom left of the
dialog box to display an expanded version of the Burn Progress dialog box
similar to the one shown in Figure 3-11.
Figure 3-11:

78
Part II: Creating Data Discs

As you can see in Figure 3-11, this expanded version of the Roxio Creator
Classic - Burn Progress dialog box enables you to select a new destination
drive (if you have one), select a new write speed (if your CD or DVD media
support this), and increase the number of disc copies to be made. In addi-
tion, you can select, deselect, or modify any of the following options:
 Disc Image File option button to save a complete copy of the disc pro-
ject on your hard disk which can then be burned to a CD or DVD disc a
later time using Creator Classic (keep in mind that the data files added
to the project are not saved as part of this disc file image and so must be
in the same folder and disk locations on your hard drive as they were
when you created the project)
 Read Only Disc (Cannot Add Data at a Later Time) check box, which
when selected prevents you from adding any more data files to this disc
even when there’s sufficient free space and you’re using rewritable media
 Record Options drop-down to choose between Write Only to begin record-
ing without doing any testing, Test Only to perform the recording test to
determine whether or not files in the project can be successfully written to
the disc, and Test and Write to perform the recording test and then, if the
disc passes automatically continue and burn the files to the disc
 Buffer Underun Prevention check box to enable or disable buffer pre-
vention for your CD or DVD drive that creates a buffer in the memory to
ensure that the data is recorded to the disc without any interruptions
(this option is disabled for older drives that don’t support this feature)
 Do Not Eject Discs After Recording check box to ensure or prevent
Creator Classic from automatically ejecting each CD or DVD disc after it
finishes recording all its data files
 Erase button to erase all the data on a rewritable CD or DVD disc (see
Chapter 2 for details) before Creator Classic begins recording the files in
your project on it
After adjusting all the necessary options in the Burn Progress dialog box,
click the Burn button to begin recording your files. The information in the
Burn Progress dialog box is then updated to a Disc 1 of x (where x is the total
number of discs required to copy all the files in your disc project). This dialog
box also shows you the progress of the data recording both in terms of the
tracks and overall disc progress. This updated Burn Progress dialog box 
contains a Start Label Creator button that you can click to launch the Label
Creator application for creating a custom label for your CD or DVD disc(s)
after the recording is completed (see Chapter 9 for details). 
If you don’t want to make a label for your disc after the files are burned onto
it, simply click the Close button to close the Roxio Creator Classic - Burn
Progress dialog box and return to the Creator Classic window.
79
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

If you’ve added more files to your disc project than can be burned on a single
CD or DVD disc, Creator Classic indicates the number of discs required along
with the total size of the project at the bottom of the Project pane. When you
burn the project, Creator Classic prompts to insert a new disc in the destina-
tion drive after it finishes copying as many files as fit on the current disc. This
continues until all the files are copied. Because Creator Classic can split data in
a single file across more than one disc, you need to use the Roxio Retrieve util-
ity in order to access files burned on such a multi-disc project (see “Recovering
Data with Roxio Retrieve” later in this chapter for details). Just be sure to label
the discs in a multi-disc project sequentially (1, 2, 3, and so on) so that you
identify each disc when using this tool to recover their files.
Adding files to an existing CD or DVD disc
Provided that a rewritable CD or DVD disc you’ve burned still has space free
for additional files and was not recorded with the Read-Only Disc option (see
“Saving the disc project and burning the disc” earlier in this chapter for
details), you can append files to the disc by taking the following steps:
1. Launch Creator Classic by clicking the Creator Classic link in the
Applications area of the Easy Media Creator Home window.
If the Easy Media Creator Home window is not open, click the Start
button on the Windows taskbar, highlight All Programs on the Start
menu, followed by Roxio on the All Programs submenu, and then click
Roxio Easy Media Creator Home on the Roxio submenu.
2. Put CD-ROM disc to which you want append additional files in your
computer’s CD or DVD drive.
Remember that in order to add files to this CD-ROM disc, it must have
sufficient free space and it must not have been originally burned as a
Read-only disc.
3. Click the Import Data from an Appendable CD button on the Project
pane’s toolbar (the one the second from left of the Burn button).
Creator Classic responds by starting a new Data Disc project to which it
adds all the folders and files on the existing CD.
4. Continue to add the other folders and files on your hard disk that you
want recorded on the disc as you normally would (refer to “Adding
data files to a disc project” earlier in this chapter for details).
If you think you might ever reuse this new project, name the project by
replacing the numeric name in the Disc Name text box and then choose
File➪Save Project (Ctrl+S) on the Creator Classic menu bar.
80
Part II: Creating Data Discs

5. Click the Burn button at the right of the Project pane’s toolbar; then
select the appropriate burn options in the Roxio Creator Classic –
Burn Progress dialog box (see “Saving the disc project and burning
the disc” earlier in this chapter) and click its Burn button.
Note that you don’t have to burn the new data disc project to the same disc.
If you want to burn it to a new CD or DVD disc, replace the one from which
you imported most of the data with a blank disc before you click the Burn
button on the Project pane’s toolbar.
Creating a Backup project
Creator Classic supports the creating of a special Data Disc project called a
Backup project. A Backup project differs from a regular Data Disc project in
that you get to specify not only what files are copied to disc but how often.
Backup projects are perfect for backing up files such as personnel or finan-
cial data files that require routine and regular backups as you add to and edit
their contents during the course of business.
When creating a Backup project, you not only determine which files are
backed up, how they are backed up, and whether or not they are encrypted,
but also how often you should be prompted by Creator Classic to use the
Backup project to burn the backup discs.
To start a new Backup project, you follow these steps:
1. Click the Go to Backup Projects link at the top of the Other Tasks list
in the Tasks pane on the left of the Creator Classic window.
The Creator Classic window is updated to show all the Backup projects
you’ve created in the pane on the right and listing the individual Backup
Tasks at the top of the Tasks pane on the left.
2. Click the Create New Project link at the top of the Backup Tasks list in
the Tasks pane. (See Figure 3-12.)
The Backup Options dialog box with the What, When, and How tabs
shown in Figure 3-13 appears. Note that the What tab options are auto-
matically displayed.
3. Type in a name for the new Backup project in the Project Name text box.
Note that you can’t later change the project name that you enter here.
4. Indicate what folders to include in the Backup project by expanding
their drives and folders so that they are displayed in the navigation
tree and then click the check boxes in front of the their folder names
to put checkmark in the boxes.
81
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

After indicating what files to back up, you may then change the other
options at the bottom of the Backup Options dialog box including which
files types are excluded with the Exclude File Types button, whether or
not source files are verified before they’re copied to disc with the Validate
Source Files before Backing Up check box, and whether or not the data
backup files is verified after copying with the Automatically Verify File
System after Backing Up (see “Changing the Data Disc Project Settings”
earlier in this chapter for details).
5. Click the When tab to display the When tab options indicating when
and how often to be reminded to make the backup disc(s).
Here, you begin by specifying whether to use daily, weekly, or monthly
reminders. By default, the new Backup project selects weekly reminders.
6. Click the Set Reminder check box. If you want to be reminded daily or
monthly, click the drop-down button and select Daily or Monthly on
the Set Reminder pop-up menu.
The interval settings that appear in the area beneath the Set Reminder
options depend upon which period you select. When you choose Daily,
you can choose between the Every Day and Every Weekday options.
When you choose Weekly, you can choose the day of the week you
receive the reminder and whether you receive it every week, every two
weeks, or every third week. When you choose Monthly, you can choose
the day of the month you receive the reminder and whether you receive
it every month, every two months, every three months, and so on.
7. Make any necessary changes to the settings for reminder interval you
selected.
Now all that’s left to do on the When tab is to select the time of day to be
reminded.
8. Select the time of the day you want to be reminded in the Set Reminder
At text box by clicking each part of the time and then adjusting it with
the buttons.
The How tab contains all the options for encrypting, password-protecting,
and hiding the files on the backup disc (refer back to “Encrypting the data
disc” earlier in this chapter for help on changing individual settings).
9. (Optional) Click the How tab and set any encryption and password
settings that you want applied when making the backup disc.
Remember that if you encrypt the disc with a password, you must be
able to produce the password exactly as you assigned it or you have no
access to the disc and can just kiss the data goodbye.
10. Click OK button to save your Backup project and return to the Creator
Classic window.

Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

When you return to the Creator Classic, the Backup Projects pane now lists
your new Backup project. This list includes the project name, details on
whether or not the backup is needed (it is always needed when you first
create the project), what kind of encryption, if any, is called for, as well as the
estimated size of the project and the number of CD or DVD discs it requires.
To burn a Backup project listed in the Backup Projects pane, make sure that
it’s selected and then click the Burn button at the top of this pane. If you
need to review or make changes to a particular Backup project, select the
project in this pane and then click the View and Edit the Selected Backup
Project’s Settings button on the Backup Projects toolbar (the button to the
immediate left of the Burn button). If you want to delete a particular Backup
project instead, click the Delete the Selected Backup Project (the one with
the red X at the beginning of the Backup Projects toolbar).
To return to the regular Creator Classic window after initially defining and
burning a Backup project, click the Go to Main Projects link in the Other
Tasks area of the Tasks pane.
Getting the Lowdown on a Disc
You can use the Disc and Device Utility to get all kinds of information about
the discs that you burn with Creator Classic or Drag-to-Disc. You can also use
this utility to erase and reformat discs so that you can reuse their media for
burning other data disc projects.
To launch this handy utility from Creator Classic, click the Disc and Device
Utility link in the Other Tasks area of the Tasks pane on the left. If Creator
Classic isn’t running at the time you want to use the Disc and Device Utility,
you can launch it from the Easy Media Creator Home window by clicking the
Extras & Utilities pop-up button at the bottom of the Tools area in the Home
window and then clicking Disc and Device Utility at the very top of this menu.
Any way that you choose to launch it, a Disc and Device Utility dialog box
very similar to the one shown in Figure 3-14 appears. When you first open
this dialog box, it shows you only condensed information about the disc in
your CD or DVD drive and the drive itself. To get more information on the
disc, including as detailed Session and Disc properties, click the Expand
button (the one with the plus sign) in front of the disc’s description. To get
detailed information about the drive, click its Expand button instead.
To erase or reformat the disc, click media’s icon in the Disc and Device Utility
dialog box and then click the Erase/Format button (this button may be grayed
out and unavailable until you click the disc’s icon). The Disc Erase/Format
Confirmation alert dialog box then appears giving you the opportunity to
choose between the Quick Erase/Format (selected by default) and the Full
Erase/Format option button. 
84
Part II: Creating Data Discs

If you want to ensure that all the data on the disc is erased before the disc 
is formatted, click the Full Erase/Format option button before you click the
Start button. If you’re not worried about a full erase and want to be able to
use the disc quickly, leave the default Quick Erase/Format option button
selected when you click the Start button.
Recovering Data with Roxio Retrieve
You can use the Roxio Retrieve tool to recover files from the data disc pro-
jects you burn onto multiple discs or to recover files on discs that you have
encrypted (see “Encrypting the data disc” earlier in this chapter). 
Unlike the data disc projects burned onto a single CD or DVD where all the files
are on that disc (and which you can readily access in any standard window
opened with the Windows File Explorer), the data in some of files in a multi-
disc project can actually be split across more than one physical disc. Because
of this, you must use the Roxio Retrieve tool in order to copy such files to your
computer’s hard disk or some other network disk to which you have access.
Don’t try to use the Windows Explorer to access files that are split across
discs in a multi-disc project. Doing so can render the files on the discs in the
set unusable. Therefore, always use the Roxio Retrieve tool to restore any of
the files from a multi-disc project to your computer’s hard disk.
To recover files from a multi-disc project with Roxio Retrieve, follow these
steps:
1. Put whatever disc of the multi-disc set into your computer’s CD or
DVD drive you think contains the files you want to restore.
Whenever you put in a disc from a multi-disc set, Roxio Retrieve shows
you all the folders and files on the disc set along with the number of the
disc on which they’re stored.
Figure 3-14:
Use the 
Disc and
Device
Utility to get
information

Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

2. Launch the Roxio Retrieve tool by clicking the Extras and Utilities
drop-down button at the bottom of the Tools area of the Easy Media
Creator Home window and then clicking the Roxio Retrieve item on
the pop-up menu.
A Roxio Retrieve window similar to the one shown in Figure 3-15 then
opens. This window shows the name of the disc with its navigation tree
in the pane on the left and the names of all the folders and files at the
current level along with its source disc number in the pane on the right.
If the disc is encrypted, you will be prompted to enter the disc’s pass-
word. If the disc is part of a backup disc project (see “Creating a Backup
project” earlier in this chapter for details), the Roxio Retrieve window
shows the backup history in the Backup History list. You can then
choose the backup history you want to use (usually the most recent
one, unless you’re looking for an earlier version of a file before certain
editing changes were made).
3. Scroll up and down the navigation tree in the left pane and through
the folder and file list in the right pane until you locate the files you
want to copy to your hard disk.
To open a folder and displays its contents, click its icon in the navigation
tree to the left. To return to the previous level in the tree and display 
its folders and files, click the Up One Level button on Roxio Retrieve
window’s toolbar. Note that Roxio Retrieve indicates all files whose data
is split across discs by listing the two disc numbers in the Source Disc
column in the pane on the right (in Figure 3-15, you know that the file
named LHASA22.MPG is split across two discs because its Source Disc
information is listed as 1-2, telling you part of the information is on the
disc 1 currently being scanned and part is on disc 2).
4. Click the check box before the names of all the folders or files that
you want copied to your hard disk so each of its boxes contains a
checkmark.
To copy all the files on the disc, click the check box in front of the disc’s
name in the pane on the left. Once you finish marking all the folders and
files to copy, you’re ready to start the copy procedure and indicate
where the folders and files are to be copied.
5. Click the Click to Copy Selected Files and Folders button on the Roxio
Retrieve window’s toolbar (the one the farthest to the right).
The Choose Destination dialog box shown in Figure 3-16 appears. By
default, Roxio Retrieve selects the Alternate Destination option button
to save the selected files in the directory whose path is shown below.
You can accept this default directory, change it with the Browse button,
or have the files copied to their original directories by selecting the
Original Location(s) option button.
6. Indicate where you want the selected folders and files copied in the
Choose Destination dialog box and then click its Retrieve button.
86
Part II: Creating Data Discs

As soon as you click the Retrieve button, Roxio Retrieve starts copying the
selected folders and files to your designated location on your computer
system. When copying a file that’s not on the disc currently in your CD or
DVD drive or one that’s split across discs, Roxio Retrieve automatically
ejects the current disc and prompts you to replace it with the number of
the disc that contains the files or part of the file in question. 
When Roxio Retrieve finishes copying all of the files, the utility displays
a Roxio Retrieve alert dialog box indicating that the Retrieve process
has been successfully completed.
7. Click the OK button the Roxio Retrieve alert dialog box indicating the
completion of the copying operation to close it and then click the
Close button in the upper-right corner of the Roxio Retrieve window
to close this utility.
Note that you can resort the files displayed in the right pane of the Roxio
Retrieve window by clicking on their column heading. For example, to sort
the files by their Source Disc number in descending order (from highest to
lowest), click the Source Disc column heading once. To then resort the files
by Source Disc number in ascending order (lowest to highest), click the
Source Disc column heading a second time.

Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

You can also use the Search for Files and Folders on the Disc Set button to
locate particular files on the disc set. Simply enter the complete name of the
file (including its filename extension) you want to find in the Named text box
and click the Search Now button in the Search for Files and Folders dialog
box that appears. Roxio Retrieve then expands the Search for Files and Folders
dialog box to show you the number of the disc that contains your file.
Disc Copies in a Jiffy
The Roxio Disc Copier enables you to make duplicates of any noncopy-
protected CD or DVD even if your computer system has only a single CD or
DVD drive. This nifty application is especially useful when you need to make
additional copies of CD or DVD discs that you burned either with Drag-to-Disc
or Creator Classic.
To make a disc copy with Disc Copier, you follow these easy steps:
1. Put the CD or DVD disc which you want copied in your computer’s CD
or DVD drive.
Now you’re ready to launch the Roxio Disc Copier application.
2. Click the Roxio Disc Copier link at the top of the Applications area in
the Easy Media Creator Home window.
The Roxio Disc Copier alert dialog box warns you that unless you own
the copyright or have the explicit permission of the copyright holder to
copy the disc, you may be violating the Copyright law and be subject to
legal penalties (such as fines and even perhaps damages). As soon as
you click the OK button to close this alert dialog box, the Roxio Disc
Copier window divided into a Source pane on the left and a Destination
pane on the right appears.

Part II: Creating Data Discs

3. Click the Advanced button to expand the Roxio Disc Copier window
to show information on the disc you want to copy and source and des-
tination drive.
An expanded version of Roxio Disc Copier window similar to the one
shown in Figure 3-17 then appears. This version shows the type or
recorder and write speed and enables you to change these settings as
well as to increase the number of copies to make.
4. (Optional) If your computer has more than a disc drive (such as a
CD-ROM and a DVD recorder), select the drive with the disc you want
to copy on the Drive drop-down list in the Source pane and the drive
that contains the blank disc to which the files are to be copied on the
Recorder drop-down list in the Destination pane.
5. Click Copy button to begin the disc copy operation.
The Roxio Disc Copier – Burn Progress dialog box then appears, 
keeping you apprised of the copy operation by displaying Finished and
Disc Progress sliders showing you the percentage completed and the
elapsed time.
If your computer has only one CD or DVD drive which acts both as the
source and destination, after copying all the disc files to a temporary
location on your hard disk, the Roxio Disc Copier automatically ejects the
disc you’re copying and displays an Insert Media dialog box that prompts
you to replace the ejected disc with a blank disc of the same media type.
After you click Continue Recording button to close this dialog box, a
Select Write Speed dialog box may appear, enabling you to select a new
write speed for the disc copy (to use the same write speed, simply click
the Continue Recording button in this dialog box). When the Finished and
Disc Progress indicators in Roxio Disc Copier – Burn Progress dialog box
reach 100%, you can then either start the Label Creator to design and
print a label for the newly copied disc (see Chapter 8) or close the Roxio
Disc Copier application.
6. To create a label for the disc copy, click the Start Label Creator
button. To close the Roxio Disc Copier – Burn Progress dialog box,
eject the disc, and return to the Roxio Disc Copier window, click the
Close button instead.
If you don’t choose to make a label for your new disc copy, you can then
close the Roxio Disc Copier application by clicking its Close button in
the upper-right corner of the window.
You can also use the Roxio Disc Copier application to burn copies of discs
made either from a disc image file or a DVD-Video folder. A disc image file is
one that contains DVD-video, audio, or video-CD content (a valid disc image
file is marked with an icon showing two cascading discs, one on top of the
other). A DVD-Video folder is one that contains only DVD-Video content that
is not copy-protected (a DVD-Video folder is marked with a disc on top of the
standard folder icon). 
89
Chapter 3: Backing Up and Copying Data Files

To use the Roxio Disc Copier to burn a disc image file onto a blank disc, click
Disc Image or the DVD-Video Folder option button in the Source pane of the
Roxio Disc Copier window and then click the Select button to the immediate
right. Then, select the disc image file or the DVD-Video folder in the navigation
tree in the left pane of the Select File or Folder dialog box or click the Search
button to locate the disc image file or DVD-Video folder you want to copy.
When you select a DVD-Video folder, the right pane of the Select File or Folder
dialog box displays all of its contents, including all the individual movies and
any extras. It does this by showing the first frame of each movie along with 
a description of it in the right pane (to preview the content of any movie or
extra, click its Play button). By default, the Roxio Disc Copier copies all of the
video content in a DVD-Video folder. If you want to copy only a single movie
in the folder, click the Copy Single Movie option button and then click the
movie’s key frame or description to select it.
After selecting the disc image files or DVD-Video folders in the Select File or
Folder dialog box, click the OK button to close this dialog box and return to
the Roxio Disc Copier window. From there, you can begin making the disc
copy by clicking the Save As button (which replaces the Copy button when
you select disc image files) or Burn (which replaces the Copy button when
you select DVD-Video folders).

Organizing Media Files with
the Media Manager
In This Chapter
 Finding your way around Media Manager
 Browsing file folders and collections for media files
 Creating media collection files
 Searching for media files on your computer system
 Backing up your media files by burning them to CD or DVD discs
M
edia Manager is the place to go when you need to organize or find the
various types of media files used in the creation of the various projects
you build with the Easy Media Creator. These media files include photos,
video clips, audio files, music tracks as well as the actual Easy Media Creator
project files themselves.
This chapter gives you the lowdown on using Media Manager to keep tabs on
the many types of files even when they’re saved on widely divergent loca-
tions on computer system. As you find out, you can use Media Manager both
to organize and quickly find and review all the different media files stored on
various drives and on media (including CD and DVD discs) throughout your
computer system. 
This chapter also covers using Media Manager to make it possible to quickly
locate particular types of media files by enabling you to assign keywords to
them that you can then use in the searches you conduct for media files of a
particular kind (you can even create media file collections based on your
search results). Last but not least, you get vital information on using Media
Manager to make backup copies of all your media files by burning them to CD
or DVD discs (which then enables you to free up much needed hard disk).

92
Part II: Creating Data Discs 
Making the Most of Media Manager
If the Easy Media Creator Home window is open, you can launch Media
Manager simply by clicking the Media Manager link at the top of the Tools
column. If this window is not open, you can launch Media Manager from the
Windows operating system by following these steps:
1. Click the Start button on the Windows taskbar.
This opens the Start menu where you select the All Programs option.
2. Position the mouse pointer on All Programs in the Start menu.
This opens the All Programs submenu where you select Roxio.
3. Position the mouse pointer on Roxio in the All Programs submenu.
This opens the Roxio submenu where you select Media Manager.
4. Click Media Manager in the Roxio submenu.
Either way you go about it, when you launch Media Manager a window very sim-
ilar to the one shown in Figure 4-1 opens. This window is initially divided into a
Folders navigation pane on the left and the folder’s Contents pane displaying
all the subfolders in the My Documents folders on the right. Note that in the
Media Manager, you can switch between the default Folders navigation pane
and the Collections navigation pane that let you navigate all the collections
you create and display the files and folders they contain in the Contents pane.
To switch to the Collections navigation pane, you click the Browse Collections
button on the toolbar on the left below the menu bar (see “Browsing your
collections” later in this chapter). Then you can return to the default Folders
navigation pane by clicking Browsing Folders button (see “Browsing your
folders” that follows for details).
Browsing your folders
The Folders navigation pane in the Media Manager window enables you to
explore the folders and files on your computer’s hard disk, removable media
in your computer’s CD and DVD drives, as well as the other drives on your
network to which you have access. To display the contents of a particular
drive or folder on your system, click the Expand button (the one with the
Plus sign) in front the Desktop, My Computer, My Documents, or My Network
Places system folder icons to display the drives and folders they contain.
Then, to display the contents of a drive or folder contained within one of
these system folders, click its drive or folder. Media Manager responds by
displaying all the folders and files on that drive or in that folder in the
Contents pane on the right. You can continue in this manner, expanding
folders within folders to peruse their files and reacquaint yourself with the
folders on your drives and their hierarchical relationship.

Figure 4-2 shows you the Media Manager after I expanded the My Documents
system folder on my hard disk and then expanded the My Pictures folder
before clicking the Mission Murals folder. Media Manager responds by dis-
playing thumbnails of all the digital photos in this folder in the Contents
pane. Note that after you use the Folders navigation tree to descend several
levels deep within a particular drive or system folder, you can then ascend
the tree, jumping back one level at a time by clicking the Up One Level button
until you reach the very top of the tree (the Desktop in this case).
After you select a folder you want to explore in the Folders navigation pane,
you can then use the following buttons on the pane’s toolbar to manipulate
the folder as follows:
 Create a New Folder to create a new subfolder within the current folder
that you can name
 Rename Selected Folder to select the name of the currently selected
folder so that you can replace it with a new folder name
 Delete Selected Folder to delete the current folder and everything
within it (be careful with this button)

files in the pane) using the following buttons that appear on the Contents
pane’s toolbar:
 Delete Selected Items from Folder to remove the selected files (and any
selected subfolders) upon your confirmation
 Rotate Selected Item(s) to rotate the selected graphic files (this button
isn’t available when audio or video media files are selected) in 90-degree
increments in a clockwise direction
 Preview Selected Item(s) to preview graphic or video media files (this
button isn’t available when audio files are selected) in separate windows
that give you the file size and resolution — graphic file previews let you
zoom in and out on the image, whereas video file previews let you play

 Increase Thumbnail Size to increase the size of all the thumbnail
images used to identify media files and folders within the current folder
(resulting in fewer being displayed in the Contents pane)
 Decrease Thumbnail Size to decrease the size of all the thumbnail
images used to identify media files and folders within the current folder
(resulting in more being displayed in the Contents pane)
 Sort By to modify the order of the files and folders within the current
folder by such attributes as Date Modified, Date Created, Size, and Type
in either ascending or descending sort order (Media Manager sorts them
by Name in ascending order by default)
 View By to change from viewing thumbnails of the media files and folders
to either Details which lists filename, size, date created and modified, and

others as attachments, as well as to any number of Easy Media Creator
utilities including QuickShow to create an impromptu video movie, photo
slideshow or audio playlist (see sidebar that follows), the PhotoSuite
editor for enhancement, Photo Stitch to create a single panoramic photo
from the individual shots, and to VideoWave for inclusion in the story-
board for a video project
95
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with the Media Manager
Impromptu movies, slideshows, and
playlists thanks to QuickShow
You can use the QuickShow option on the
Send Selected Items To drop-down list to make
a selection of video clips into a quick-and-
dirty movie, photo images into an off-the-cuff
slideshow, or audio files into a spur-of-the-
moment track playlist. Open a folder that con-
tains a bunch of the same type of media files
(video, graphic, or audio) and then select their
files in the Contents pane in the order in which
you want to them to play in the impromptu show.
Then click the Send Selected Items To drop-
down button followed by QuickShow on drop-
down list. Media Manager then switches to
full-screen mode and plays the media in the
selected files. This show screen contains a
simple playback controller in the upper-right
corner containing Play, Pause, Previous, Next,
and Exit buttons that you can use to control the
show. This controller uses an AutoHide feature
so that it automatically disappears from the
screen after a few seconds of play (to make the
controller reappear, position the mouse pointer
in the upper-right corner in the vicinity of the
unhidden controller).
To change the QuickShow settings such as
the amount of time each slide is displayed or
whether to play an audio track as background
music for the show, choose Tools➪Options on
the Media Manager menu bar and modify any
necessary settings (such as the Slide Duration or
Play Background Sound) on the QuickShow tab
of the Options dialog box before you click OK.

Browsing your collections
When you click the Browse Collections button right above the Folders naviga-
tion pane on the left side of the Media Manager window, the Folders pane
changes to the Collections pane (see Figure 4-3). This pane enables you to
browse all the special media collections files on your computer system (see
“Creating Media File Collections” later in this chapter for details on creating
collections), search for items within your collections, display a calendar view
of your collections that groups media files by creation date, and a tag view
that lets you assign keywords, comments, and sounds to media files in collec-
tion to make them easier to search. 
When you click Browse Collections button, the following buttons appear in
the Collections pane on the toolbar immediately beneath the Collections title
bar. You can use these buttons to change the view in the Collections pane so
that you can perform the following operations on your media file collections:
Add tags

Part II: Creating Data Discs 

 Browse and Manage Collections to browse and select collections on
your computer system. When you select the name of a particular collec-
tion in the Collections pane, the different types of media files are dis-
played in the Contents pane to the right.
 Search for Items in Your Collections to search for collections by name,
keyword, or comments (see “Finding Wayward Media Files” later in this
chapter)
 View Items in Your Collections by Creation Date to display the media
files in your various collections by the month and year that they were
created
 Add Tags to Items in Your Collection to assign keywords, sounds, and
comments to a selected media file collection to make that collection
easier to find when conducting a search for a particular type of media
Scanning your computer for media files
You can have Media Manager scan your computer system for all the media
files that it contains, including supported audio, video, and graphic files as
well as all Roxio project files. To have Media Manager scan your computer to
locate all of its media files, you follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Scan for Media Files on the Media Manager menu bar.
Media Manager displays a Scan for Media Files dialog box that informs
you that by scanning your computer for media files, Media Manager then
enables you to more easily browse, search, and tag these files for quick
retrieval.
2. Click the Scan Settings button in the Scan for Media Files dialog box.
The Scan Settings dialog box (shown in Figure 4-4) appears where you
can adjust which folders and disks on your computer system are
scanned, what types of supported files are scanned, and how often
Media Manager is to scan your computer.
3. Click the check boxes in front of the disks and folders listed in the Scan
In list box until they match the color and type of mark (x or standard
checkmark) for the type of scanning you want in the legend to the right.
By default, most of the local disks and system folders (with the excep-
tion of the My Computer) are selected for scanning their folder and of
their subfolders. In addition, all network disks and Web folders (indi-
cated by the My Network Places and Share-to-Web Upload Folder check
boxes) are not set up to be scanned at all. You can change any of these
scan settings by continually clicking its checkmark until its color and
mark (x or standard checkmark) match the desired kind of scanning
listed in the Legend area of the Scan Settings dialog box.
97
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with the Media Manager

4. Click the check boxes in front of the different types of media files
listed in the Scan For list box to either clear its checkmark (so it’s not
scanned) or insert a checkmark in it (so that it is scanned).
By default, Media Manager scans all types of media files except for audio
files on the designated disks and folders. To include audio files, click the
check box in front of All Supported Audio Files. To remove any of the
other three types (photo, video, or Roxio project files), click the check
box in front of an option to remove its checkmark.
5. Click the option button in the Automatically Scan list box to indicate
how often to scan your computer (Never, Daily, Weekly, or the default,
Monthly).
By default, Media Manager is automatically set to scan your computer
(using the Scan In and Scan For setting you designate here) on a monthly
basis to check for media file updates. To switch to a more frequent inter-
val, click the Daily or Weekly option button. To prevent Media Manager
from automatically scanning your computer, click the Never option
button instead.
6. Click the OK button to close the Scan Settings dialog box and return
to the Scan for Media Files dialog box.
Now you’re ready to have Media Manager begin scanning your computer
for the specified types of media files.
7. Click the Scan Now button in the Scan for Media Files dialog box to
have Media Manager begin scanning your computer.

98
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

As soon as you click the Scan Now button, the Scan for Media Files dialog
box disappears and Media Manager begins scanning the disks, folders, and
subfolders you specified for your designated media files. Media Manager
keeps you apprised of its progress in the scanning process by showing you
which folder it is currently scanning on the status bar at the bottom of the
Scan for Media Files dialog box.
When Media Manager finishes scanning your computer for all the designated
file types, it then adds an All Media icon to the Collections pane (displayed
by clicking the Browse Collections button directly below the menu bar).
When you click this icon in the Collections pane, thumbnails of all the desig-
nated media files (of the types included in the scan) are displayed in the
Contents pane to the right.
Once you’ve got all your media files scanned and identified in the All Media
folder, you can then easily add them to collections that you’re building (see
“Creating Media File Collections” later in this chapter), tag them for quicker
retrieval (see “Tag, You’re It!” later in this chapter), or bring them into the
workspace (see “Working that Workspace” that immediately follows).
Working that Workspace
Media Manager has a special Workspace pane (similar to the one shown in
Figure 4-5) that you can use to assemble media files from diverse folders and
collections on your computer to that you can then perform a particular activity
to all the files at the same time (such as saving them all in a new collection 
or printing or e-mailing them). For example, you can use the Workspace to
collect a bunch of photos saved in different folders all across your hard disk
and then display them sequentially in an onscreen slideshow by clicking the
QuickShow item on the Send Selected Items To button’s pop-up menu from
the Workspace toolbar.
To open the Workspace pane, click the Workspace button on the right side
of the Media Manager toolbar. The Workspace pane opens at the bottom of
the Media Manager containing its own toolbar for processing the assembled
media files.
To bring files into the Workspace for simultaneous processing, select their
folders in the Folders navigation or Collections pane and then drag their
icons from the Contents pane and drop them on the Workspace pane. When
you finish using the Workspace pane, you can clear it of files by clicking the
Clear All button on the pane’s toolbar and then clicking the Yes button in the
Confirm Clearing Workspace alert dialog box (note that these files are then
removed only from the Workspace and not deleted from their respective fold-
ers on your computer’s disks). To close the Workspace pane when you no
longer are using it, click the Workspace button on the right side of the Media
Manager toolbar a second time.
99
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with the Media Manager

Burning up that Burn List
In place of the Workspace pane, you can open a Burn List pane at the bottom
of the Media Manager window that enables you to assemble all the media
files that you want burned on a backup CD or DVD disc. To open the Burn
List pane (similar to the one shown in Figure 4-6), click the Burn List button
(to the immediate right of the Workspace button on the toolbar at the top of
the Media Manager window).
After you open the Burn List pane, you can add folders, files, and collections
to it by selecting their folders or collections in the Folders or Collections
pane and then dragging their icons from the Contents pane and then dropping
them into the Burn List pane. As you add files to this pane, the status

information at the bottom of the Burn List pane keeps you informed of the
amount of free space left on the type of disc you’re using (see “Backing Up
Media Files on Disc” later in this chapter for details on using the Burn List
pane to make a backup of your media files).
Keep in mind that the free-space gauge is dependent upon which type of disc
you select with the Select Disc Type drop-down list button (the one to the
immediate left of the gauge that uses a disc icon). To select a CD or DVD disc
with a different capacity, click this drop-down button and then click the type
you intend to use in the burn process (650 MB CD, 700 MB CD, 4.7 GB DVD,
185 MB MiniCD, or 210 MB MiniCD).
Close the Burn List pane when performing other tasks in Media Manager
by clicking the Burn List button on the far right side of the Media Manager’s
toolbar when you haven’t yet added enough files to fill a CD or DVD disc.
Then, when you come upon some more media files that you want to burn to
disc, you can open the Burn List pane (by clicking the Burn List button once
more) so that you can drag-and-drop them into this pane.

Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with the Media Manager

Creating Media File Collections
Media file collections are a key element in the struggle to organize and keep
on top of the many media files of different types that you use in the various
projects you create with the Roxio Easy Media Creator suite. Collections
enable you to associate different types of media that you might want to use
together in a particular project (such as a DVD movie as described in Chap-
ter 12). The great thing about Collections is that you don’t have to physically
move or copy all the media files you want to associate with one another into
the same folder. A Collection can keep track of all the different files regardless
of where they’re actually located on your computer system (this includes
files saved in folders on your hard disk, files saved in folders on a network
drive to which you have access, and files saved in folders on backup CD and
DVD discs (that you can actually create with Media Manager — see “Backing
Up Media Files on Disc” later in this chapter for details).
To create a new media file Collection, follow these steps:
1. Launch the Media Manager and then click the Browse Collections
button on the right side of the Media Manager toolbar.
Media Manager displays the Collections navigation tree in the
Collections pane.
2. Click the My Collections icon to expand this portion of the tree.
Media Manager displays all the collections you’ve created in the Contents
pane and the Create a New Collection button becomes active on the
toolbar on the second row of the Collections pane.
3. Click the Create a New Collection button.
Media Manager adds a Collection to the navigation tree named New
Collection and gives you the opportunity to rename it (see Figure 4-7).
4. Type in a new descriptive name for the Collection and then press the
Enter key.
The name you enter replaces the default “New Collection” name.
As you can see in Figure 4-7, any new collection that you create is automati-
cally empty and ready for you to add your media files to it. Media Manager
offers a couple of different methods for adding a new media file to the
Collection you create: 
 Click the Add to Collection button (the one to the immediate right of the
Create a New Collection button) and then select the folders and files to
associate with the new Collection in the Add to Collections dialog box. 
102
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

 Click the Add Items to Your Collections on the left side of the Media
Manager toolbar to split the window into four panes: the Folders
Navigation and Folders Contents panes above the Collections Navigation
and Collections Content panes below. Next select the media files in the
upper Folders Contents pane to add and then click the downward-
pointing arrow button to the left of the Add button to add them into the
Collections Contents pane below.
To select all the media files in the currently selected folder, click somewhere
in the Contents pane and then press Ctrl+A. Media Manager then selects all
the media files in the folder (including the ones you can’t see in the Contents
pane).

Collection by adding all its media files to the Workspace pane and then creat-
ing the new collection out of its files. This second method for creating a new
Collection is sometimes superior to the first in that it enables you to do other
things to its media files such as preview all media files of a certain type with
the QuickShow utility (see the “Impromptu movies, slideshows, and playlists
thanks to QuickShow” sidebar earlier in this chapter) or print all the graphics
files as well as associate all of them in a new Collection.
To create a new Collection from the contents of the Workspace pane, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Workspace button to open the Workspace pane at the bottom
of the Media Manager window.
An empty Workspace pane opens at the bottom of the Media Manager
window.
2. Select the folder containing the media files you want to add in the
Folders navigation pane and then select the media files in the Contents
pane on the right.
3. Drag the selected files to the Workspace pane and then release the
mouse button to drop them into this pane.
Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until you have added all the media files to the
Workspace pane that you want in the new Collection.
4. Click the Save as New Collection button on the Workspace pane’s tool-
bar (the second button from the left).
The Save as New Collection dialog box opens.
5. Click the Enter a Name for the New Collection text box and then type
in the name for the new Collection and then click the Save button.
Media Manager closes the Save as New Collection dialog box and creates
a new Collection with all the media currently in the Workspace pane.
6. Click the Clear All button at the beginning of the Workspace pane’s
toolbar and then click the Yes button in the Confirm Clearing
Workspace dialog box to clear the pane.
After clearing the media files from the Workspace pane, you are ready
to close it.
7. Click the Workspace button on the Media Manager’s toolbar to close
the Workspace pane.
You can then check new Collection you created by clicking on the left side of
the Browse Collections button on the Media Manager toolbar and then click-
ing the Expand button in front of the My Collections icon and finally clicking
the name of the new Collection. All the media file that you added to the
Workspace pane now appear in the Collection’s Contents pane.
104
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

Filtering the files in a Collection
Media Manager makes it easy to filter out the types of media files that you
don’t want displayed in the Folders or Collections Contents pane. This is
useful when you’re dealing with the Contents pane for a folder or Collection
that contains a bunch of different types of media files and you want “narrow
down the field” so that it displays only a single type of media file (that you
can then review).
To filter out all but a single type of media file, click the Filter for Media
Types drop-down button on the Media Manager toolbar and then click the
type of media file that you do want displayed in the Contents pane (Photos,
Audio Files, Video Files, or Roxio Projects) in the pop-up menu. Media
Manager temporarily removes the display of all files except for the type 
you selected in the Contents pane. To redisplay all of the media files in the
Contents pane for the currently selected folder or Collection, click the Filter
for Media Types drop-down button on the Media Manager toolbar and this
time click All Media Files at the very top of the pop-up menu.
Tag, You’re It!
Media Manager enables you to tag the media files you assemble into
Collections (see “Creating Media File Collections” earlier in this chapter) so
that later you can more easily identify their contents or search for them. The
program supports three different types of tags:
 Keywords that enable you to find related groups of files when doing
searches in Media Manager (see “Finding Wayward Media Files” that
immediately follows)
 Comments that enable you to add text notes that describe the contents
of a media file (such as adding the location where a photo was taken and
the names of the people who are in it)
 Sounds that enable you to add audio notes that describe the contents
of a media file (if your digital camera supports adding sound notes to
your photos, these are automatically imported along with the image when
you use the Capture tool to bring it into a Roxio project — see Chapter 10
for details)
To check a media file for tags, right-click its file icon and then click Properties
on its shortcut menu. Then click the Tags tab in the Properties dialog box.
This tab displays all the keywords, the text of any comments added to the
file, as well as the name of any sound file associated with the media file.
105
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with the Media Manager

Adding keywords to Collection files
To add keywords to the media files in a Collection in Media Manager, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Browse Collections button on the Media Manager toolbar.
The Collections pane appears.
2. If necessary, expand My Collections in the navigation tree and then
click the name of the Collection with files you want to tag.
Next, you need to switch from Browse Collections to Assign and Manage
Keywords in the Collections pane.
3. Click the Add Tags to Items in Your Collection button (the one to the
farthest right on the Collections toolbar.
Media Manager opens the Assign and Manage Keywords portion of the
Collections pane with its own toolbar of three buttons (see Figure 4-8).
4. Select all the media files in the Collections Contents pane that you
want to tag with the same keyword(s).
Now you’re ready to select the keyword(s) to assign to the selected files.
5. Click the check boxes in front of all applicable keywords listed near
the bottom of the Collections navigation pane.

106
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

If none of the currently listed keywords applies, you can create a new
keyword(s) to apply.
6. (Optional) Click the Add New Keyword button and then type in the
keyword in the blank box and press Enter.
If you add a new keyword in Step 6, then you still need to take the next
step to apply it to the selected files.
7. (Optional) Click the check box in front of the new keyword you just
added to apply it to the files selected in the Contents pane on the right.
After you assign keyword(s) to different groups of media files in a Collection,
you can then view which keywords apply to what files in the Collection in 
the Assign and Manage Keywords portion of the Collections pane by simply
selecting the media file’s icon in the Contents pane. As soon as you click the
files’ icon, checkmarks appear in all the keywords that you’ve applied to it
(if all the check boxes are empty, this means that you haven’t yet applied any
keywords to the file).
To remove a keyword that you’ve applied to a file, all you have to do is to
click the keyword’s check box to remove its checkmark.
Adding comments to Collection files
In addition to or instead of keywords, you can add explanatory comments to
a media file that help you identify its contents. To add a comment to a media
file, make its Collection active in the Collections navigation pane and then
select the media file in the Contents pane. Next, click the Add Tags to Items 
in Your Collection button on the Collections toolbar and then click the
Comments button in the middle of the second toolbar below. 
When you click the Comments button, View and Edit Comments portion of the
Collections pane appears containing a Look In drop-down list box where you
can select the Collections file whose contents you want displayed in the atten-
dant Contents pane. Below this, you find a Comments list box which displays
the text of your comments. To add a comment, click the comments list box
and then type the text of your note. To edit the contents of a note that you’ve
added, use the I-beam mouse pointer to select the text that needs editing and
either delete it with the Delete key or replace the text by typing over it.
Adding sound tags to Collection files
In place of a written comment, you can add a sound tag to a particular media
file that explains something about the file’s contents or how the file should be
edited or used in any of the other projects you create with Roxio Easy Media
Creator 7. The process for assigning a sound tag is very similar to that for
107
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with the Media Manager

assigning a comment except that instead of clicking the Comments button in
the lower toolbar in the Collections pane, you click the Sounds button (the
one on the far right with the speaker icon).
When you click the Sounds button, the Associated Sounds portion of the
Collections pane appears. This area contains its own Look-in drop-down list
box and below that a Select Sound drop-down list box (where you can select
audio files with sound notes that you’ve already recorded for other media
files). To record a new sound note, click the Record a Sound button near the
bottom of the Collections pane.
Media Manager then launches the Roxio’s Capture tool, which you can use
to record your sound note (see Chapter 10 for details on recording sound
with Capture). After you finish recording your sound note in Capture, click
its Done button with the Go Back to the Launching Application option button
still selected to return to Media Manager where the newly recorded sound
note is assigned to the selected media file (indicated by the presence of a
speaker icon at the bottom of the selected file’s thumbnail image).
To listen to the sound note that you’ve assigned to a media file, click the Play
This Sound button that appears right above the Record a Sound button in the
Collections pane. Media Manager then plays back the sound note you just
recorded and the Play this Sound button turns into a Stop button (which you
can click as soon as you’ve heard enough of the note). 
To remove a sound note from a selected media file, click the Select Sound
drop-down button and then click the None item at the top of this box’s pop-
up menu. To delete the file with the sound note you recorded, click its file
icon in the Contents pane, press the Delete key, and then click the Yes button
in the Confirm Removal of Selected Media File(s) alert dialog box.
Finding Wayward Media Files
Media Manager enables you to find just the media files you want to work with
by searching all the media files or Collections on your computer system.
When searching for media files, you can do the search on the name of the file
or Collection as well as on keywords that you’ve assigned to the files and
even the text of comments that you assigned to them (see “Tag, You’re It!”
earlier in this chapter for details on assigning keywords and comments to
your media files).
Media Manager supports two kinds of media searches:
 Simple search in which you just enter search text and Media Manager
then searches for it in all media filenames and Collection names,
keywords, and comments in all the media files scanned on your
108
Part II: Creating Data Discs 

computer system (see “Scanning your computer for media files” earlier
in this chapter)
 Advanced search in which you specify what text to search for in media
filenames and Collection names and what type of media files and
Collections to include in the search
To conduct a simple search, you follow these simple steps:
1. Click the Browse Collections button on the Media Manager toolbar.
Media Manager opens the Collections pane.
2. Click the Search for Items in Your Collections button on the Collections
pane’s toolbar (the one second from the left with the magnifying 
glass icon).
Media Manager opens the Simple Search portion of the Collections pane
similar to the one shown in Figure 4-9.
3. Type the text to search for in the names of your Collections or filenames
they contain and in the keywords and comments you’ve assigned to
these files in the Simple Search text box.
The search text that you enter can be just part of a Collection name
(such as vacation to find both the Collection called Europe vacation 
and Last summer’s vacation) or media filename.
4. Click the Search button to initiate the search.

Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with the Media Manager

Media Manager then displays all the icons for the collections and thumbnails
for the media files that contain the search text either in their Collection name
or filename or in their keywords or comments. These matching Collections
and files appear in the Search Results pane on the right side of the Media
Manager window (this pane replaces the usual Collections Contents pane
when you click the Search for Items in Your Collection button).
Conducting an advanced search is very similar except that you get to specify
the text to search for in collection names and media filenames and to what
types of media files and what collection(s) to include in the search. You con-
duct an advanced search from the Simple Search portion of the Collections
pane (by following the first two steps of the simple search procedure given at
the beginning of this section). Then you follow these additional steps:
1. Click the Advanced Search button to the immediate right of the
Simple Search button on the Collections pane’s toolbar.
The Collections pane changes from Simple Search to Advanced Search
similar to the one shown in Figure 4-10.
2. Enter the file or collection name to search for in the Search Text box.
You can then narrow the search by selecting which types of media files
to include in the search.
3. (Optional) Click the check boxes in front of the types of media files
that you do not want included in the search under Search For to
remove their checkmarks.
You can even further narrow the search by selecting what collection(s)
to include in the search.

Part II: Creating Data Discs 

4. (Optional) Click the Look In drop-down button and click the name
of the collection to include in the search on the Look In drop-down
list box.
To search all the collections on your computer, click All Collections in
Look In drop-down list. To search all media files that Media Manager
scanned on your computer system, click All Media instead.
5. Click the Search button to conduct the advanced search using all your
search criteria.
As with the Simple Search, Media Manager displays all the collections and
media files that match your search criteria in the Search Results pane on the
right side of the Media Manager window.
If you want to make all the collections and media files displayed in the Search
Results pane into its own collection file, click the Save as New Collection
button near the bottom of the Simple Search and Advanced Search portion of
the Collections pane and then give a new name for the collection in the Save
as New Collection dialog box.
Backing Up Media Files on Disc
In addition to enabling you to preview and organize all the different kinds of
media files you use with the Roxio Easy Media Creator suite, Media Manager
also makes it easy to backup these media files by burning them to CD or DVD
discs. To do this, you use the Media Manager’s Burn List pane opened and
closed by clicking the Burn List button on the far right side of the Media
Manager’s toolbar.
When the Burn List pane is displayed at the bottom of the Media Manager,
you can then add all the collections and individual groups of media files that
you want burned to disc. As you drag-and-drop these files into the Burn List
pane, its status bar at the bottom of the pane keeps you informed of the
amount of space that added files will take up on the type of media that you
use (see Figure 4-11). This status bar also contains a Disc Name text box in
which you can add your own volume name for your backup disc, a Disc
Recorder pop-up button which enables you to select a new CD or DVD
recording device, and a Disc Type pop-up which enables you to select the
type of disc media — 650 MB CD, 700 MB CD (the default), 4.7 GB DVD,
185 MB MiniCD or 210 MB MiniCD — on its pop-up menu.
When you finish adding all the collections and individual media files to the
Burn List pane that you want (or can fit) on your CD or DVD backup disc,
click the Burn button to start burning the disc. The Media Manager - Burn
Progress dialog box then appears, which you can expand to display further
burn options or just start burning the disc by clicking its Burn button (the
111
Chapter 4: Organizing Media Files with the Media Manager

options in this dialog box work exactly like the ones in the Burn Progress
dialog box described in Chapter 3). When you do this, the Media Manager -
Burn Progress dialog box appears that keeps you informed of the burning
process. When all the files in the Burn List pane have been burned to the
disc, Media Manager automatically ejects the disc from its CD or DVD drive.
Keep in mind when adding media files to the Burn List pane that you can add
folders that contain these files as well as collections. However, when you
drag a folder icon from the Folders navigation pane into the Burn List pane,
Media Manager automatically converts the folder into a new collection (with
the same name) that appears both in the Burn List navigation pane and the
Burn List Contents pane.
After burning a CD or DVD disc, you can then empty the Burn List pane by
selecting all its collections and media files (do this by clicking the Burn List
contents pane and then pressing Ctrl+A) and then clicking Remove Selected
Item(s) from Burn List button on its toolbar). Before you empty the Burn List
pane, you can save all its files in its own collection by Clicking the Create a
New Collection button on the Burn List navigation pane’s toolbar when the
Burn List disc icon is selected at the top of the navigation tree.

U
ndoubtedly, the digital audio and digital photos that
Part III deals with represent some of the most fun
media to work with (who doesn’t love a good tune and the
memories that photos of our favorite activities engender?).
This part begins with Chapter 5, which covers all aspects
of digital audio, from recording it (both live and from pre-
recorded sources, including those beloved old LPs and
audio cassettes) to editing and enhancing it. Chapter 6 is
the place to go for information on acquiring, editing, and
using your digital photos. Part III concludes with Chapter 7,
which gives you the ins and outs of compiling and burning
audio CDs and MP3 discs, and Chapter 8, which covers
Easy Media Creator’s Label Creator tool that makes it as
easy as can be to design and print disc labels and case
inserts for all your CDs and DVDs.

 Recording an audio file from a connected analog playback device
 Selecting the audio to edit in an audio file
 Applying special audio effects to an audio file
 Saving an audio file in a new format and selecting appropriate encoder
and compression settings
A
s you find out in this chapter, Sound Editor is the place to go when you
need to preview, edit, or enhance audio files (assuming that they’re non-
licensed files which are not copy-protected) that you want to use in various
projects you create with Roxio Easy Media Creator 7. You can also use this
tool to record audio from analog playback devices such as LP records and
audio cassettes. 
The Sound Editor also lets you save your recorded and edited audio files
using a variety of different audio formats (MP3, WMA, OGG, or WAV) and com-
pression settings. Because Sound Editor can open audio files saved in any of
these formats and then save them back out in any of these formats, you can
use the Sound Editor to convert audio tracks that you receive saved in one
audio format into another more compressed or manageable format for use in
your other Roxio projects. You can then use the edited files you create in
Sound Editor as part of the tracks that you burn to standard audio CDs or
MP3 discs with applications such as Roxio’s Creator Classic (see Chapter 8
for details).

Getting Cozy with Sound Editor
Just like with the other Roxio Easy Media Creator tools, you can launch Sound
Editor from the Easy Media Creator Home window or from the Windows XP
operating system. To launch the tool from the Easy Media Creator Home
window, click the Sound Editor link in its Tools column. To launch Sound
Editor from the Windows taskbar, click the Start button, position the mouse
pointer on All Programs on the Start menu, then on Roxio on the All Programs
submenu, and finally click Sound Editor on the Roxio submenu.
An empty Sound Editor window then opens where you can record a new
audio file or edit an existing audio file already saved to disk. To open an
audio file for editing, click File➪Open on the Sound Editor’s menu bar or
press Ctrl+O. Then locate the audio file to edit in the Open dialog box using
the Look In drop-down list box or one of the buttons in the left panel (My
Recent Documents, Desktop, My Documents, My Computer, or My Network
Places) and click the Open button.
When you open an audio file for editing, Sound Editor represents its sound
visually as a waveform (as shown in Figure 5-1). This waveform shows the rel-
ative amplitude of the sound (that’s volume to you and me) with its different
spikes, peaks, valleys, and dips over time.

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

If you try to open an audio file for editing in Sound Editor to which you don’t
have the rights and which is protected (as is the case with all audio tracks
that you download or purchase from a music service such as Napster, the
Sound Editor displays an alert dialog box letting you know that the file is pro-
tected and cannot be opened with Sound Editor.
As you can see in Figure 5-1, the Sound Editor shows the waveform for both
the left and right channels (which are identical when editing a sound file that
wasn’t recorded in stereo). Both the left and right channels of the waveform
are plotted against a decibel (abbreviated dB) scale on the right side of the
Sound Editor window. 
These left- and right-channel dB scales measure the voltage gain of the ampli-
fier against the strength of its original signal (indicated by the red baseline
that runs through the middle of each scale). When the audio file’s waveform
rises above this baseline, the scales measure how much stronger the audio
signal is than the original carrier signal. When the waveform dips below this
baseline, the scales measure how much weaker the audio signal is when com-
pared to the original carrier signal.
At the far left side of the Sound Editor window, Peak meters appear for both
the left and right channels. These meters indicate how close the recording
level comes to the zero dB clipping point where the sound literally goes off
the chart. Volumes in the safe zone are indicated in green and yellow bars
and sounds that actually exceed this point where sounds are clipped are indi-
cated in red bars.
Zoom, zoom, zoom . . .
You can use the zoom controls at the top of the Sound Editor window to
zoom in and out on the waveform:
 Zoom In to zoom in on the waveform so that you can see more detail of
the waveform over less time in the Sound Editor window
 Zoom Out to zoom out on the waveform so that you can see less detail
but over more time in the Sound Editor window
 Zoom to Selection to zoom in just the portion of the audio waveform
that you’ve selected in the Sound Editor window
As you click the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons, the scale on the time track
beneath the waveform changes to show the how much of the recording’s
waveform is currently displayed in the Sound Editor window (this timescale
shows the number of minutes and seconds that have elapsed from the start
of 0:00.0).
117
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio with Sound Editor

When you zoom all the way out on the audio file, the recording’s entire wave-
form is displayed in the Sound Editor window and the Zoom Out button
becomes grayed out (indicating that it’s temporarily unavailable). As you
zoom in on the recording and not all of its waveform is displayed in the
Sound Editor window, the scroll bar (the green bar that appears immediately
beneath the timescale) no longer extends the entire width of the window. 
You can then drag this bar to the left and right to bring different parts of the
recording’s waveform into view in the Sound Editor window.
To zoom in on just a particular portion of the waveform, click the mouse
pointer at the starting place in the waveform and then drag through the
waveform until you’ve selected through the entire of portion of the waveform
you want to examine up close. Then click the Zoom to Selection button (the
zoom button on the far right underneath the Sound Editor menu bar) to dis-
play just the selected section of the waveform in the Sound Editor window. To
return to the previous view of the waveform, click the Zoom Out button once.
To deselect the waveform selection, click the mouse pointer anywhere in the
waveform (a position cursor indicated by a thin, white dotted vertical line
replaces the waveform selection at the place you click).
You can use the plus (+) and minus (-) keys on your keyboard to zoom in and
out on a recording’s waveform. In fact, by pressing the plus key you can actu-
ally zoom out on the waveform many times more than by clicking the Zoom
Out button until only fractions of a second of the recording is displayed in
the Sound Editor window and the left and right channels of the waveform
appear as very spaced-out waves extending above and below the dB scale’s
baseline.
Playing with the playback
and recording controls
You can use the playback controls at the bottom of the Sound Editor window
to play the audio file that you’re editing or enhancing. When you click the Play
button to play back the file’s recording, Sound Editor begins the playback
from the Position indicator (the thin, yellow vertical line that moves across
the waveform from left to right as you playback the audio). This Position indi-
cator begins playback at the beginning of the audio file unless you double-
click the mouse pointer at some other, later point in the waveform (doing this
not only starts the playback at that position in the recording but also leaves a
cursor indicated by a white, dotted vertical line at that position). 
When you click the Play button to start the audio playback, this button
changes to a Pause button, which you can then click to pause the playback.
Note that if you click the Stop button, Sound Editor stops the playback and
resets the Position indicator at the very beginning of the waveform. To the
immediate right of the Stop button, you find a Rewind/Previous Track button
118
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

that you can click to move the Position indicator to the beginning of the pre-
vious track (which is the same as the beginning of the recording if the record-
ing has only one track in it). Likewise, you can click the Fast Forward/Next
Track button located to its immediate right to jump to the beginning of the
next track in the recording (or to the very end of audio file if it has only a
single track).
Drag the Volume slider to control the volume (drag left to reduce the volume
and right to increase it). If you need to temporarily mute the volume alto-
gether, click the Mute/Unmute button to the immediate right of the Volume
slider. The first time you click this button, Sound Editor mutes the playback.
The second time you click this button, the program removes the muting,
returning to the original playback volume.
Table 5-1 gives you a list of the most common keystroke shortcuts that you
can use to control the playback of a recording in Sound Editor. You can use
any of these keystrokes instead of having to click the controls at the bottom
of the Sound Editor window.

Recording Audio
You can use Sound Editor to record audio from analog sources such as LP
records and audio cassettes. To do this, you must first connect your analog
audio equipment to your computer’s sound input with the appropriate
119
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio with Sound Editor

cables. Most of the time, this cable will be a y-shaped cable with one red and
one white stereo-jack connector on one end that come together in a single
earphone- or microphone-type connector on the other.
You then connect the red and white stereo-jack connectors to the left and
right-channel line out connections on your analog audio equipment (tape
deck, stereo receiver, and so on). On most personal computers that aren’t
equipped with a special analog-to-digital converter (see Chapter 2), you then
connect the other connector to the microphone connection on your personal
computer so that this acts as the sound input when recording your LPs or
cassette tapes with Sound Editor.
Note that when trying use Sound Editor to record audio from a record player,
you must take the line out of a stereo receiver or some other type of amplifier
to which the record player is connected (if you were to cable the record
player directly to your computer’s sound input, the audio would be too weak
for Sound Editor to record it).
After connecting your analog device to your computer’s sound input, you
take these steps in the Sound Editor program to record audio played through
the device: 
1. Click Tools on the Sound Editor menu bar and then click Recording
Device on the Tools menu and the actual name of your recording
device on the Recording Device submenu.
If you can’t get Sound Editor to work when selecting your actual record-
ing device, try selecting Default Mapper Device on the Recording Device
submenu to use the Windows’ sound mixer.
2. Click Tools on the Sounder Editor menu bar and then click Recording
Source on the Tools menu and the name of your computer’s recording
source on the Recording Source submenu.
For example, if you’re recording through a microphone connected to
your computer’s sound input, click Microphone on this submenu. If
you’re recording through a line connected to an analog device such as 
a cassette recorder, click the option on this submenu that mentions 
Line or Line In (the actual items on this submenu vary according to the
sound card your system uses). Note that if you select Default Mapper
Device on the Recording Device submenu, this same choice is automati-
cally selected for you on the Recording Source submenu.
3. Click the Record Mode button at the bottom of the Sound Editor
window to the immediate right of the Record Level slider.
When you click this button, the Record Mode button’s icon turns red
and the Play/Pause button turns into a red Record/Pause button that
you can use to start and temporarily pause the recording of your audio.
4. (Optional) Drag the Record Level slider to the right (maybe midway)
to set a test volume for recording.
120
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

Next, you want to test the recording level by playing the audio track you
want Sound Editor to record.
5. Start playing the track(s) you want to record on the analog device con-
nected to your computer (record player, cassette player, and the like).
When playing the track(s) you want to record with Sound Editor, you
should hear the audio through your computer’s speakers and see the L
(left channel) and R (right channel) peak meters light up with green,
yellow, and, hopefully, on occasion red bars.
6. Adjust the volume by dragging the Record Level slider as needed so
that the L and R peak meters mostly display in the green, infrequently
in the yellow, and seldom, if ever, in the red.
If the peak meters display persistently in the red, then clipping has
occurred. You must click the meters to clear them and then reduce the
volume by dragging the Record Level slider to the left and then retesting
your recording levels by replaying the audio track(s) you want to record.
Once the recording levels on both the L and R peak meters check out,
you’re ready to record the track. 
7. Cue up the LP record or cassette to the point at which you want to
start recording in Sound Editor.
If you’re recording tracks on an LP, place the needle near or at the end of
the track previous the one you want to record and then when the record
player reaches the silence in between the tracks, proceed to Step 8. If
you’re recording a track on cassette, cue up to the silence in between
the two tracks and immediately after you follow Step 8, click the play
button on the cassette player.
8. Click the red Record/Pause button in the playback controls at the
bottom of the Sound Editor window.
As Sound Editor begins to record your audio, it draws the waveform of
the left and right channels in the Sound Editor window. If you need to
pause the recording to switch the tape or turn over the LP, click Sound
Editor’s Record/Pause button. To begin recording again, click the
Record/Pause again.
9. Click the Sound Editor’s Stop button when your analog source finishes
playing all the audio you want to record.
Now you’re ready to save the new digital version of the audio you just
recorded under a new filename, using appropriate encoding and com-
pression options.
10. Choose File➪Save on the Sound Editor menu bar to open the Save
dialog box. Indicate where you want to save the file in the Save In
location, the name you want to give the file in the File name text box,
the type of audio file in the Save as Type drop-down list, and the type
of encoding in the Encoder drop-down list box, and then click the
Save button.
121
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio with Sound Editor

As you see in Figure 5-2, by default Sound Editor saves your recorded audio
in stereo using the uncompressed WAVE audio format with the PCM encoder
(which eats up a lot of disk space fast). If you need to save space, select a
different audio format such as MP3 or OGG that use compression and then
modify their compression settings as appropriate (see “Choosing Audio
Formats and Compression Settings” later in this chapter for more on this
topic).
Removing silences from a recording
One of the first things you may want to do after saving your new recorded
audio to disk is remove any leading or trailing silences that you may have
recorded. You will get a leading silence if you have a delay between the time
you cue up the analog audio, click the Sound Editor’s Record button, and
actually start playing the LP or cassette tape that you want to record. You
will get a trailing silence if you have a delay between the time the LP or tape
finishes playing and the time you click the Sound Editor’s Stop button to
stop the recording.

122
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

To get rid of a recording’s leading silence, you choose Edit➪Select Leading
Silence on the Sound Editor’s menu bar. Sound Editor then automatically
locates and selects the silence at the very beginning of the recording (see
Figure 5-3) and you can delete this silence simply by pressing the Delete key.
You can also do this by right-clicking the selection and then clicking Edit➪
Delete on the shortcut menu.
To get rid of trailing silence, you choose Edit➪Select Trailing Silence on the
Sound Editor’s menu bar and then either press the Delete key or right-click
the selection and then click Edit➪Delete on the selection’s shortcut menu.
If you delete a leading or trailing silence only to suddenly realize that you
need to retain that silence in this recording (perhaps to act as a track break
when combining this recording with another audio track in one of your Easy
Media Creator projects), press Ctrl+Z to Undo your deletion of the silence and
put it back in your file before you do any more editing. Then click the mouse
pointer anywhere in the recording’s waveform to remove the selection. 
Inserting silences into a recording
Should you find that you need a leading or trailing silence in a recording that
you don’t already have, you can use the Edit➪Insert Silence command on the
Sound Editor menu bar to insert one. Simply click the mouse pointer at the
place in the recording where you want the silence to be inserted before you
choose Edit➪Insert Silence.
Sound Editor then opens the Insert Silence dialog box shown in Figure 5-4
where you indicate the number of seconds of silence to insert (two seconds

is the default and is usually quite sufficient) in the Seconds text box before
you click the OK button.
The Edit➪Insert Silence command can come in real handy after you’ve used
the Edit➪Insert Audio File command to insert another track or recording into
your current audio and need a gap between the two to mark and separate the
individual tracks.
Adding track breaks to a recording
If the audio file that you’ve recorded with Sound Editor had more than one
track, you can use Sound Editor’s Tools➪Auto Locate Tracks command to
have the program detect the silences in the recording and add track breaks at
each of them. You can then click the Fast Forward/Next Track button on the
Sound Editor’s playback controls at the bottom of the window to advance
through each of the tracks. You can also rename any of the tracks by right-
clicking the temporary track name, Untitled Track, which appears after its
sequential number at the top of left track’s waveform and then clicking
Rename Track on its shortcut menu. Replace Untitled Track by typing over 
it and then press Enter.
If Sound Editor’s Auto Locate Tracks’ command doesn’t correctly identify all
the track breaks in the recording because some of the tracks have no silences
between them, you can manually insert track breaks at the appropriate places.
To do this, follow these steps:
1. Open the audio in Sound Editor by choosing File➪Open on the menu
bar and then selecting the audio file into which to insert tracks.
Figure 5-4:
To insert a
silence into
a recording,
open the
Insert
Silence
dialog box
and indicate
the number

insert.
124
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

Next you locate the place in the recording where you need to insert the
first track break. You can do this either by listening to the recording or, if
you know the place in the timeline where one track ends and the other
begins, scrolling to that place in the recording.
2. Locate the position where the track break is to be inserted and then
click this place with the mouse pointer to insert the cursor there.
Now you’re ready to insert the track break at the cursor’s position.
3. Choose Tools➪Insert Track Break on the Sound Editor menu bar.
Sound Editor inserts a new break at the cursor’s position in the wave-
form. This new track break is given the next sequential track number
and the temporary name, Untitled Track.
4. Right-click Untitled Track that appears above the left-track waveform,
click Rename on its shortcut menu, and then type in your name for
the track break and press Enter.
When Sound Editor inserts a new track break at the cursor’s position, it
does not automatically add a silence between it and the previous track.
If you want to do this, you must take an additional step.
5. (Optional) Choose Edit➪Insert Silence on the Sound Editor menu bar
and then type in the number of seconds in the Seconds text box of the
Insert Silence dialog box before you click OK.
Be sure to remember to save your audio file after inserting the track breaks
with the File➪Save command (Ctrl+S). Note, however, that each time you
save changes to the recording you’re editing in Sound Editor, the program
opens the Save dialog box, giving you the opportunity to change various set-
tings as well as save your changes (most other Windows’ programs only do
this when you choose File➪Save As). You must then click the Save button to
close the Save dialog box and click the Yes button in the alert dialog box that
appears, asking you to confirm the replacement of the original audio file even
when you’re only saving the track breaks you’ve added to the recording!
Selecting the Audio to Edit
After you’ve saved the recording you made with Sound Editor with all the
superfluous silences removed and the track breaks identified, you may still
need to edit all or just portions of the audio by adding any of Sound Editor’s
many audio effects (see the section “Enhancing Audio Files” that follows
immediately for details). To apply an effect to the entire audio file, you need
to select its entire waveform: you can do this either by choosing Edit➪Select
All on the Sound Editor’s menu bar or simply by pressing Ctrl+A.
If your recording has multiple tracks and you want to apply a particular audio
effect to only that track, you can quickly select it by choosing Edit➪Select
125
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio with Sound Editor

Track on the Sound Editor menu bar and then clicking the number and name
(if it has one) of the track whose audio is to be selected in the Select Track
submenu. Sound Editor then selects the entire portion of the waveform that
contains the audio for the designated track.
If you only want to apply an audio effect to a portion of a track, you need to
manually select that part of the waveform before applying the particular
enhancement. To do this, you click and drag the mouse pointer through 
the portion of the waveform to be modified. Of course, you can use Sound
Editor’s playback controls to locate the portion of the track to be enhanced
by listening to it. Just be sure to note the starting and ending times on the
timeline as you listen to it.
Keep in mind that you can zoom in on the portion of the waveform that you
select by pressing the plus key (+). If you want to zoom in on the first half of
the selected portion of the waveform so that it appears at the beginning of
the Sound Editor window, choose View➪Zoom In to Left on the Sound Editor
menu bar or hold down the Shift key located on the left side of the keyboard
as you press the plus key (+). To zoom in on the last half of selected wave-
form, choose View➪Zoom In to Right on the Sound Editor menu bar or hold
down the Shift key located on the right side of the keyboard as you press the
plus key (+).
Enhancing Audio Files
Sound Editor supplies you with a multitude of different kinds of audio effects
that you can apply to the recording you make with it. To apply an effect to
the waveform that you’ve selected (using any of the selection techniques out-
lined in “Selecting the Audio to Edit” that immediately precedes this section),
you choose Tools➪Apply Effect to Selection command on the Sound Editor
menu bar. Sound Editor then opens a submenu listing all the following audio
effects you can apply to your selection by clicking its menu item:
 Invert to flip the positive and negative offsets of the selected audio
 Reverse to play the selected audio backward (in hopes, I guess, of hear-
ing its secret message!)
 Fade In to apply a fade-in effect so that beginning of the selection begins
at zero volume increasing to full volume by the end of the selection
(apply this effect only to the start of tracks in your audio file)
 Fade Out to apply a fade-out effect so that beginning of the selection is
at full volume decreasing down to zero volume at the end of the selec-
tion (apply this effect only to the end of tracks in your audio file)
 Normalize to level out the peaks in the volume in the current audio
selection (apply this effect when the audio file contains tracks recorded
126

at different volume levels and you want the combined audio recording to
play at a uniform volume)
 Alienizer to add metallic and alien synthesized effects to your audio by
dragging the Alpha and Beta sliders to the left or right in the Alienizer
dialog box — click the Play button in this dialog box to hear the result
on the selected audio of your adjustments to the Alpha and Beta values
before clicking OK to apply them
 DeClick to remove distinctive clicks or crackles in the selected audio by
dragging the DeClick and/or DeCrackle sliders to the right — click the
Play button in this dialog box to hear the result on the selected audio of
your adjustments to the DeClick or DeCrackle percentages before click-
ing OK to apply them
 DeTuner to adjust the pitch of the selected audio without affecting the
speed by clicking the Pitch or Demi-Tone option button and then adjust-
ing its slider to the left or right in the DeTuner dialog box — click the
Play button in this dialog box to hear the result on the selected audio of
your adjustments to the Pitch and Demi-Tone values before clicking OK
to apply them
 Enhancer to adjust three aspects of the selected audio by manipulating
three sliders: Bass Boost to increase the amplitude of the low frequency
(bass) sounds; Brighten to increase the amplitude of high frequency
(treble) sounds; and Stereo Width to increase the perceived separation
between the left and right channels of stereo audio
 Equalizer to display a 10-band equalizer (as shown in Figure 5-5) that
enables you to boost or cut the amplitude (volume) for ten bands of
sound frequencies by dragging their respective frequency sliders (note
that this equalizer contains a Master slider that you can use to adjust
overall volume for the selected audio) — click the Play button in this
dialog box to hear the result on the selected audio of your amplitude
adjustments to individual frequencies before clicking OK to apply them

Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio with Sound Editor

 Maturizer to adjust the quality of the selected audio (especially LPs
recorded from older “vintage” equipment) by adjusting any or all of five
different sliders: Noise (for tapes that have a lot of noise), Hum, Crackle,
Click (for 33 rpm or 78 rpm LPs), and Bandlimit — click the Play button
in the Maturizer dialog box to hear the result on the selected audio of
your particular adjustments to these five areas before clicking OK to
apply them
 Parametric Equalizer to display a 4-band equalizer (shown in Figure 5-6)

can use to adjust the overall gain for the selected audio) — click the
Play button in this dialog box to hear the result on the selected of your
gain and bandwidth adjustments to the different bands before clicking
OK to apply them
 Robotizer to add metallic and robotic synthesized effects (similar to the
Alienizer) to your audio by dragging the Alpha and Beta sliders to the
left or right in the Robotizer dialog box (note that you can also click the
Broaden Stereo check box to increase the perceived separation of the
left and right channels of a stereo recording) — click the Play button in
this dialog box to hear the result on the selected audio of your adjust-
ments to the Alpha and Beta values before clicking OK to apply them
 Room Simulator to add different types of reverberation audio effects on
the selected audio: Box, Room, Church, or Space to simulate these vari-
ous environments as reverberation chambers (note that for any of the
four options you choose, you can adjust the amount of reverberation
and echo by adjusting the Reverb Time and Echo Level sliders) — click

the Play button in this dialog box to hear the result on the selected
audio of your Box, Room, Church, or Space Option button selection and
any adjustments you make to the Reverb Time and/or Echo Level sliders
before clicking OK to apply them
Keep in mind that Sound Editor’s audio effects are cumulative, that is, they
are layered on top of the other. This means that you need to test each effect
as you apply it by listening to the result before applying another effect. That
way, if you find that you goofed up and really don’t like the audio effect you
just applied, you can remove it by choosing Edit➪Undo on the Sound Editor
menu bar or pressing Ctrl+Z (remember that you can also reapply an effect
that you remove with the Undo command by immediately choosing the
Edit➪Redo command or pressing Ctrl+Y).
Choosing Audio Format and
Compression Settings
When you first save a recording that you make with Sound Editor, the program
defaults to saving the resulting audio file in the WAVE audio format (using the
.wav filename extension). This default audio format saves audio files that
sound nearly identical to the original source recordings (as identical as is pos-
sible for digital audio made from an analog counterpart to sound). The only
problem with WAVE audio files is that they’re completely uncompressed, mean-
ing that they can be really huge files (especially for recordings of any length).
When disk space is a question (and when isn’t it), you often need to select a
different audio format whose encoder supports the use of different sample
rates, bit rates, and compression settings. That way, you can experiment with
saving a version of the resulting audio file so that it is as compact as possible
while retaining whatever sound quality that you feel is crucial given its ulti-
mate use.
If you have the disk space available, always save the original recording using
the uncompressed WAVE audio file format. Then you can experiment creating
versions saved in other audio file formats, using different compression set-
tings until you find the optimal combination for your particular needs while
still retaining an uncompressed original sampled at the highest rate.
To save a more compact version of the audio you’ve recorded in Sound
Editor, you need to modify the settings in the Save dialog box (these settings
are available to you not only the first time you save a new recording but each
time you save editing changes to it), starting with the audio file type. In addi-
tion to the default WAVE audio file, Sound Editor also gives you a choice among
these other three audio file formats in the Save as Type drop-down list box in
its Save dialog box:
129
Chapter 5: Recording and Editing Audio with Sound Editor

 MPEG Layer 3 Audio (*.mp3) which gives you a choice between the
Coding Technologies MP3 encoder (the default) and the Fraunhofer MP3
encoder (a version of MPEG developed and patented by Fraunhofer IIS,
that is, Institut Integrierte Schaltungen)
 OGG File (*.ogg) using the OGG Vorbis 1 encoder
 Windows Media Audio File (*.wma) using the Windows Media-Audio
encoder
When you select the MP3, OGG, or WMA as the audio file type instead of
WAVE, you cannot only modify the Audio Format settings but the Compression
Settings as well (see Figure 5-7) in the Save dialog box to create more com-
pact versions of your Sound Editor recordings.
The Audio Format settings include the following options that you can modify
depending upon which of the four available audio formats (WAVE, MP3, OGG,
or WMA) you select:
 Stereo or Mono option buttons to choose between two-channel stereo
sound and a single-channel monographic sound: choose Mono when
dealing with a monographic recording to save valuable disk space
 Sample Rate drop-down list box to select the rate at which the audio
source is sampled: you can choose a value in range between 8 KHz up to
48 KHz depending upon the audio file type selected, with the higher the
rate the better the sound, and 44.1 KHz the default and standard for
most audio CDs
 Bits per Sample drop-down list box to select between a sample size of
8 or 16 bits (the default) when you select WAVE as the audio file type
(the higher the number of bits per sample, the higher the quality of the
resulting audio)
When you choose MP3, OGG, or WMA as the audio file in the Save as Type
drop-down list box, you can change the following Compression Settings
as well:
 Constant Bit Rate or Variable Bit Rate option buttons to choose
between a constant bit rate and a variable bit rate (which can some-
times give you better sound audio)
 Smallest Size to Best Quality compression rate slider to determine the
bit rate/compression factor to be applied to the audio file: drag the slider
to the left to increase the amount of compression, resulting in a smaller
file size with less sound fidelity, and to the right to decrease the amount
of compression, resulting in a larger file size with greater sound quality
 Options drop-down list box to select between Normal Stereo (the
default), Joint Stereo (which can sometimes reduce the size of the audio
file slightly without greatly compromising the stereo quality), and Dual
Channel
130
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

When experimenting with these Audio Format and Compression Settings,
keep in mind that you usually want to strike a balance between decent sound
and huge file sizes. When dealing with a recording where two-channel stereo
is not important or the original recording is not stereo, always start with your
file-size savings by selecting the Mono option button in the Audio Format
area of the Save dialog box. 
When selecting compression settings for stereo recordings, start by saving
the audio file with the Smallest Size to Best Quality compression rate slider 
at dead center so that your bit rate/compression factor matches the sound
quality equally against the file-size savings. Then, if that resulting audio file is
still too big for your needs, you can delete that compressed version and then
open the original WAVE audio file and try saving another compressed version
of the file, this time after dragging the compression rate slider left toward the
Smallest Size end so that the file-savings factor outweighs the sound quality
slightly.

W
orking with digital photos has become one of the more important
functions of today’s computer software. In the PhotoSuite application
in the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 suite, you have one of the most powerful
tools for fixing and editing your digital photos. Coupled with the capacity 
of the suite’s Media Manager tool for organizing your digital photos (see
Chapter 4) and the ability of its VideoWave application to arrange photos
into a slideshow (see Chapter 11), you have at hand all the software you need
for maintaining and arranging all your digital photo collections from now on.
In this chapter, you find out how to use the PhotoSuite application to fix,
edit, and enhance your digital photos. You also discover how easy it is to
use PhotoSuite to print your photos either individually, in groups on a single
page, or as a contact sheet. In addition, this chapter covers sharing your
digital photos with your friends and family. As you see in this chapter, with
PhotoSuite you not only can send your photos as e-mail attachments or in
the body of your e-mail message, but you can also package a group of them
into a slideshow that your recipients can then play in sequence (complete
with background music, if you decide to add it).
Launching PhotoSuite Your Way
If you have the Easy Media Creator Home window open, clicking the
PhotoSuite link in the Applications area is the easiest way to launch the pro-
gram. It is, however, not the only way to launch PhotoSuite from the Easy

Media Creator Home. If your intention is to edit a bunch of photos with
PhotoSuite’s many editing features, you can launch the program and have it
go directly to the Open dialog box in the My Pictures folder by clicking the
Edit and Fix Photos link under the Photo column in the Tasks area at the top
of the Easy Media Creator Home. 
So too, if your intention is to e-mail photos to your friends or family with
PhotoSuite, you can launch the PhotoSuite and have it automatically select
the program’s E-mail task pane by clicking the E-mail Photos link in this
Photos column. Finally, if your intention is to create any of the several photo
projects (such as a greeting card , collage, or calendar) using your digital
photos, you can launch PhotoSuite and have it open the program’s Create 
a Project task pane by clicking the Create a Greeting Card link at the very
bottom of the Photo column in the Tasks area.
If, however, the Easy Media Creator Home window is not open, you can also
launch PhotoSuite from the Windows taskbar by clicking the Start button,
highlighting All Programs on the Start menu with the mouse pointer, followed
by highlighting Roxio on the All Programs submenu, and then finally clicking
PhotoSuite on the Roxio submenu.
Don’t forget that if you’ve recently edited photos in PhotoSuite or used its
project templates to create your own photo projects and you haven’t yet fin-
ished working on them, you can both launch PhotoSuite and go directly to
work editing the particular photos or photo project by double-clicking the
photo or project in the Recent Projects area at the very bottom of the Roxio
Easy Media Creator Home window. Click the Expand button on the far right
side of the bar that says Recent Projects (the one with the two arrowheads
pointing downward) if none of the thumbnails of your recently created pro-
jects appear at the bottom of the Easy Media Creator Home window.
Getting Familiar with PhotoSuite 7
When you launch PhotoSuite from the Start menu on the Windows taskbar or
by clicking the PhotoSuite link in the Applications column of the Easy Media
Creator Home, the PhotoSuite Home Page window shown in Figure 6-1
appears. PhotoSuite’s Home Page window contains two panes, Edit & Create
at the top left and Print & Share at the bottom left each of which contains
several hyperlink options that you can click to perform various functions
with PhotoSuite. 
Note that you can display more information about any of the options on the
right side of the PhotoSuite Home Page window by positioning the mouse
pointer on its link. This descriptive information then appears beneath the
general PhotoSuite 7 welcome information that always appears at the top
right of the initial PhotoSuite window.

PhotoSuite’s Supported File Formats
PhotoSuite makes it a snap to fix damaged digital photos, edit their contents,
and enhance their overall look with the program’s extensive editing features.
PhotoSuite can open and edit photos saved in any of the following graphics
file formats:
 BMP (Bitmap) with the .bmp, .rle, or .dib filename extension
 JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) with the .jpg, .jpe. or .jpeg file-
name extension
 PNG (Portable Network Graphics) with the .png filename extension
 TIFF (Tagged Information File Format) with .tif or .tiff filename extension
BMP or Bitmap is the Microsoft Windows’ standard graphics file format.
Bitmap files come in 2, 16, 256, and 16.7 million (24-bit) color and most use no
compression. The so-called RLE or Run-Length Encoded variation of the basic
Bitmap does use some modest compression (RLE files use 16 or 256 colors
and are primarily used in saving graphics used as the Windows desktop’s
wallpaper and background images).
The JPEG file format is one of the most popular graphics file formats for digi-
tal photos (many digital cameras save their photos as JPEG files). This graph-
ics file format uses a “lossy” compression scheme that attempts to reduce
the overall file size by reducing detail in certain areas which often results
(especially in photos with lots of details) in a slight degradation of the overall
picture quality. JPEG is an especially good format to use for photos that you
intend to display on Web pages on the Internet.
The PNG file format was developed as an alternative to the GIF (Graphics
Information Format), the ever-popular file format for displaying Web page
graphics. PNG files come in 256-color, True Color, and 32-bit color varieties
and use a lossless compression scheme to cut down on the overall size.
136
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

The TIFF file format was developed as a portable format for bitmap images.
TIFF files come in monochrome, 16-color and grayscale, 256-color and
grayscale, and 16.7 million-color (24-bit) varieties. This file format gives you
the highest quality in terms of bitmap images but their files are notoriously
large, especially for high-resolution images.
Although the PhotoSuite can both open for editing and save edited photos in
the Bitmap, JPEG, PNG, or TIFF file format, the program’s native graphics file
format is something known as DMSP (using the .dmsp filename extension).
This file format was developed for editing photos in PhotoSuite and developing
photo projects using the program’s templates (see “Playing with PhotoSuite
Project Templates” later in this chapter for details). This file format supports
the use of a layer scheme (somewhat akin to that used in Adobe Photoshop)
that enables you to undo changes made to specific graphic objects (even when
you’ve combined multiple photos and other objects together in a collage).
When editing photos originally saved in the other supported graphics file for-
mats with PhotoSuite, after opening the photo, use the File➪Save As command
to save the file in the PhotoSuite’s DMSP format — you do this by selecting
PhotoSuite Format (*.dmsp) in the Files of Type drop-down list in the Save As
dialog box before clicking the Save button. Then, after you finish making all
your editing changes to the photo in PhotoSuite, you can save the final edited
version in its original graphics file format (BMP, JPEG, PNG, or TIFF) for distri-
bution to others. 
The process of saving the original file as a DMSP file for the editing process
and then saving it back out in its original file format when the editing’s done
is especially important when it comes to dealing with JPEG photos. That’s
because continually saving the editing changes made to a JPEG photo in
PhotoSuite contributes to the overall degradation of its quality (especially
when the photo has a lot of detail).
Photos saved in PhotoSuite’s native DMSP file format can only be opened
with PhotoSuite. For this reason, never send a DMSP photo to anyone you
aren’t completely certain has PhotoSuite installed on his or her computer.
Also, photos saved in PhotoSuite’s DMSP native file format can’t be opened
on the Internet (always save photos bound for the Web either in the JPEG or
PNG file formats).
Fixing, Editing, and Enhancing Photos
To edit a photo in PhotoSuite, you can click the Edit and Fix Photos link in the
Photo column of the Tasks area if the Easy Media Creator Home window is
displayed, or if you’re in PhotoSuite itself, click its Edit link that appears at
the top of the PhotoSuite window. The Open dialog box shown in Figure 6-2
then opens where you can select the collection (see Chapter 4 for details) or
folder that contains the photo you want to edit.
137
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

When you locate the photo you want to edit in the Open dialog box, click its
thumbnail and then click the Open button. The selected photo then appears on
the right side of the PhotoSuite window along with either the All Edit Features
task pane (shown in Figure 6-3) or the Common Edit Features task pane. If the
program displays the Common Edit Features task pane, you can click the Show
All Features button to switch to the All Edit Features task pane which contains
nine editing buttons. You use the features on the pop-up menus associated
with the nine buttons in the All Edit Features task pane to fix, transform, and
add special effects to the photo you’re editing.
If you click the Show Common Features button right below the Cutouts &
Masks button, PhotoSuite switches to the Common Edit Features task pane
that only contains the PhotoDoctor, Crop, Rotate, Red Eye, and Add or Edit
Text buttons (these five represent the most commonly used photo editing
features and they are found on the pop-up menus associated with the Overall
Quality, Transform, Facial Flaws, and Text buttons on the All Edit Features
task pane).
Fix me up
Two buttons, Facial Flaws and Damaged Photos, on the All Edit Features task
pane contain options designed to help you improve the quality of photos by
fixing particular flaws such as the ever-present red eye (especially problem-
atic in pet photos) and other types of flaws such as dust motes (speaks caused
by dust on the photo) and scratches or tears (usually associated with older
photos developed film that you scan into your computer).

138
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

The Facial Flaws button contains these three options for fixing problems with
the subjects in your digital photos:
 Red Eye to remove red eye from the subjects in your photo
 Wrinkles to remove particular wrinkles from subjects in your photo
 Blemishes to remove particular blemishes from the subjects in your
photo
The Damaged Photos button contains these three options for fixing problems
with the photos themselves:
 Dust to remove the presence of specks (dust motes) throughout the
photo
 Scratches to repair and remove particular scratches that appear in the
photo
 Clone to repair a particular damaged area in the photo by using pixels
from a similar, undamaged area to replace it
The Red Eye option on the Facial Flaws menu and the Dust option on the
Damaged Photos pop-up menu have an AutoFix button that you can click to
attempt to have PhotoSuite automatically find and take care of the problem.

Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

If you use the AutoFix button in the Red Eye task pane and it doesn’t elimi-
nate all your red eye problems, you can use its three-step manual process for
finding and eliminating those goblin eyes (see “Get the red out!” that follows).
If you use the AutoFix button in the Dust task pane and it doesn’t remove all
your dust imperfections, you can try using the Clone option to remove indi-
vidual dust motes as described in “Bring in the clones” later in this chapter.
Get the red out!
Red eye is a prominent problem in portraits (often caused when the subject’s
eyes reflect lights from a flash). To take care of red eye in the photo you have
open in PhotoSuite, click the Facial Flaws button in the All Edit Features task
pane and then click Red Eye on its pop-up to open up the Red Eye task pane.
You can then click the AutoFix button at the top of this task pane to try and
have PhotoSuite take care of the problem automatically.
If the AutoFix button doesn’t take care of the problem, you can still take the
red out of the eyes of particular subjects in the photo by following this
manual procedure:
1. Click the Zoom In button on the toolbar above the photo on the right
side of the PhotoSuite window or choose File➪Zoom In on the pro-
gram’s menu bar and then drag the vertical and horizontal scroll bars
to bring the subject whose red eye you want to fix into view on the
screen.
Repeat Step 1 until you’ve zoomed in the subject’s eyes so that they’re
clearly visible on the screen and big enough to manipulate.
2. Position the mouse pointer (which assumes a circular shape with a
crosshair in the middle) over of one of the subject’s red eyes.
The mouse pointer must be the same size as the eyes you’re going to
treat (see Figure 6-4) before you can go ahead and click the mouse
button to replace red eye with blue coloring.
3. Drag the brush size slider in the Red Eye task pane to the left (to
decrease the diameter of the mouse pointer) or to the right (to increase
the diameter of the mouse pointer) until the mouse pointer is the same
size or just slightly smaller than the subject’s eyes.
Now you’re ready to replace the red eye by clicking the mouse button.
4. Position the mouse pointer so that it covers one of the subject’s eyes
and then click the mouse button.
When you click the mouse button, PhotoSuite replaces the red in the eye
with blue pixels.
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 to remove the red from the subject’s
other eye.
140
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

After you finish manually removing red eye from the subjects in the photo
you’re editing, click the Done button at the bottom of the Red Eye task pane
to return to the All Edit Features task pane. If you screw up and replace more
than the just the red eye area with blue, click the Undo Last Stroke button
until the unwanted color is removed. If you decide that you want to close the
Red Eye task pane without retaining the changes you’ve made to red eye in
the photo, click the Cancel button.
Bring on the clones
The Clone task pane, opened by clicking the Damaged Photos button and
then clicking Clone at the bottom of its pop-up menu, contains the controls
for sampling an area of the photo and then painting another area with the
same pixels. This feature is great for repairing damaged or washed out areas
of a photo by taking a part of the nearby background and using it to fill in the
missing or damaged places.
To use the Clone task pane to repair an area of your photo, you follow these
steps:
1. (Optional) Click the Zoom In button and drag the horizontal and verti-
cal scroll bars until both the damaged area and the area whose pixels
you want to clone are prominently displayed in the PhotoSuite window.
Figure 6-4:

then use the

task pane to

141
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

2. Position the mouse pointer (which assumes a circular shape with a
crosshair in the middle) over the one edge of the undamaged area
whose pixels you want to paint with.
Next you may need to adjust the size, transparency, and edge fading set-
tings with their respective sliders. Use the Size slider to adjust the size
of the circular mouse pointer, keeping in mind that its diameter becomes
the size of both the source brush you use to sample the pixels you want
to clone and the destination brush you use to paint the damaged area
with the cloned pixels. Use the Transparency slider to determine the
intensity of cloned pixels: drag to the right for a lighter effect and to the
left for a more opaque effect. Use the Edge Fading slider to increase or
decrease the amount of fading around the edge of the destination brush
(that is, the one you paint the damaged area of the photo with).
3. (Optional) Manipulate the Size, Transparency, and Edge Fading sliders
until you’ve got the settings you think you want to use in cloning.
Now you’re ready to establish the starting point for the cloned pixels by
clicking the mouse pointer. This establishes the starting point for the
source brush that clones whatever pixels it passes over.
4. Click the mouse pointer to establish the starting point for the source
brush which clones the pixels it passes over.
All that’s left to do now is paint with the mouse pointer over the dam-
aged or washed out portion of the photo using the pixels in the area
around the cloning start point. 
5. Drag the mouse pointer over the damaged or washed out area of the
photo, replacing its pixels with those passed over by the source brush.
When painting the damaged or washed out area, be aware not only of the
strokes of your destination brush that’s repairing the damaged area but also
keep your eye on the strokes of your source brush picking up the pixels you’re
painting with. If the strokes of your source brush go outside of the area you
want cloned in the damaged area, you start painting with part of the image
that don’t want copied to the damaged area. If this happens, click the Undo
Last Stroke button near the bottom of the Clone task pane until the cloned
pixels that don’t belong are removed from the photo.
If you find that you keep painting with an unwanted part of the picture, try
resetting the start point of the source brush at a place where there are more
pixels you want to use. To do this, click the Reset Start Point button near the
top of the Clone task pane and then click the mouse pointer at a new, safer
starting point for the source brush before dragging the mouse pointer to
paint with the destination brush.
When you’ve repaired all the damaged or washed out areas in the photo,
click the Done button to return to All Edit Features task pane. If you want to
forgo all the changes you’ve made with the Clone task pane, click the Cancel
button instead.

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

Transform me
Between the options on the pop-up menus attached to its Overall Quality and
Transform buttons, PhotoSuite includes all the features that you should ever
need for improving the quality of your digital photos. The Overall Quality
options include those for modifying such things as the photo’s exposure, color
saturation and tint, as well as its overall brightness and tint. The Transform
options include those for doing such things as cropping, rotating, flipping,
straightening, and resizing the photo image.
In matters of exposure and color
As all photographers know, you can’t always take your shot in the most opti-
mal lighting conditions. The worst lighting conditions, of course, are those
outdoor settings where it’s way too bright, as when shooting right into the
sun rather than having the sun at your back and those indoor settings where
it’s way too gloomy as when taking a shot in a fairly dimly light room and the
flash doesn’t go off. As a result, like it or not, the quality of many of the pic-
tures you shoot ends up being compromised by the presence of some really
overexposed and/or underexposed areas. 
Fortunately, digital photo editing often enables you to compensate for most
extreme lighting conditions, making it possible to return a certain amount of
balance and detail to your favorite photo. This is especially true in the case
of grossly underexposed photos where the color and detail is washed out
throughout. It also works pretty well with photos which are overexposed
overall. Where it’s not so successful is with digital photos that suffer from
both extremely over- and underexposed areas. In these cases, you usually
have to split the difference and settle for just a certain amount of improve-
ment in toning down the washed out effect in overexposed areas and in bring-
ing back a little of the color and detail to the underexposed ones.
To improve the quality of a digital photo, you turn to the help of the options
on the Overall Quality button at the top of the All Edit Features task pane.
The very first option on this button’s pop-up menu is PhotoDoctor. The
PhotoDoctor automates the process of trying to find the correct exposure,
saturation, and sharpness settings for a photo that suffers either from some
underexposure or overexposure deficiencies.
To let the PhotoDoctor diagnose and attempt to cure your photo’s ills, you
click PhotoDoctor on the Overall Quality’s pop-up menu, the PhotoDoctor
task pane opens containing only an Auto Fix button as shown in Figure 6-5.
When you click this Auto Fix button, PhotoSuite attempts to diagnose prob-
lems in the photo’s exposure, color saturation, and sharpness, and then pro-
ceeds to reset them. After transforming the photo, the PhotoDoctor task pane
lists which settings have been modified, while showing you the result in pane
on the right (see Figure 6-6).

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

If you don’t like the results (and often, you won’t), click the Cancel button 
at the bottom of the PhotoDoctor task pane to dump the modifications and
return to the All Edit Features task pane. If you do like what you see and want
to retain the modified photo, click the Done button instead and then save the
changes to the file (Ctrl+S). Of course, if you take the added precaution of
working on a copy of the original digital photo, you can always fall back to
opening the original photo in PhotoSuite.
If the PhotoDoctor isn’t able to cure what ails your photo, you can try using
one or more of the individual controls, Exposure, Saturation, Sharpness, Tint,
and Brightness & Contrast to fix the problems. Like the PhotoDoctor task
pane, the Exposure, Saturation, and Sharpness task panes (opened by click-
ing their respective options on the Overall Quality pop-up menu) all contain
their own Auto Fix buttons that you can click in the hope that PhotoSuite will
correctly diagnose and fix problems with the photo’s exposure, color satura-
tion, and sharpness settings. 
I often find that I get better results by fiddling with the Exposure, Saturation,
and Sharpness controls individually and in the order of their appearance on
the Overall Quality pop-up menu rather than by using the PhotoDoctor. After
making corrections in each of these areas, I very seldom, if ever, have to go
on and fool with the Brightness & Contrast control as well. 
The Exposure, Saturation, and Sharpness task panes also have their own slid-
ers that you can use instead to manually achieve the amount of correction
your photo needs:
 Exposure task pane contains Dark Areas, Midtones, and Bright Areas
sliders that enable to adjust the exposure in just the darker or brighter
areas of the photo or only in the mid ranges in between
 Saturation task pane contains a Saturation slider for adjusting the over-
all saturation of color in the photo and a Midtones slider for adjusting
color saturation in just the mid ranges of the photo
 Sharpness task pane contains an Amount slider for adjusting the amount
of contrast in the photo’s edge pixels, a Radius slider for adjusting the
number of pixels radiating from the edge pixels that you want to sharpen,
and a Threshold slider for adjusting how different pixels must be to be
considered as the edge pixels for sharpening
The controls in the Tint task pane enable you to correct the overall hue and
balance of color in a photo. It’s useful when you’re dealing with an old photo
print that shows yellowing from age that carries over into the digital photo
during scanning. To change the tint of a photo, in the Tint task pane, you click
the area of the photo that should be white or gray with the mouse pointer
(which appears in the guise of an eyedropper). PhotoSuite then automatically
adjusts the tint of the photo. 
145
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

In cases where you’re not trying to get rid of yellowing by restoring the whites
and grays but rather want to “tint” the photo in a particular color (often to
add a mood to it), you use the Tint Color slider to select the color you want
to tint the photo and then the Tint Balance slider to increase or decrease the
amount of color tinting applied.
The Brightness & Contrast task pane, as its name implies, enables you to
modify the amount of brightness and contrast in the photo by manipulating
its Brightness and/or Contrast sliders. This task pane is one of the very few
associated with the Overall Quality button that don’t offer any control for
automatically selecting the optimal brightness and contrast settings. Here,
you have to manipulate the appropriate slider(s) to make any modifications.
The Exposure, Saturation, Sharpness, Tint, and Brightness & Contrast task
panes all contain Show Preview check boxes that are all automatically
checked so that you immediately see the effects of all the modifications you
make with the various sliders. You can use this check box to compare the
changes you’ve made to the original photo. Simply click the Show Preview
check box to remove its checkmark and display the original photo and then
click this check box again to reapply its checkmark to once again display the
modifications you’ve just made.
In matters of size, shape, and orientation
The pop-up menu attached to the Transform button in the All Edit Features
task pane contains a number of important options (Crop, Rotate, Flip,
Straighten, and Resize) that enable you to manipulate the size, shape, and
orientation of your photo. This menu also contains Position and Change
Order options which are only available when you superimpose more than
one photo on another (see “Superimposing one photo on another” later in
this chapter for details).
Here we come a cropping
The Crop option on the Transform button’s pop-up menu enables you to cut
out whatever parts you consider extraneous in the photo so that it concen-
trates on whatever you consider to be the photo’s primary subject or sub-
jects. Cropping is one of the most used editing tools for photos. When you
click the Crop option, crop marks (indicated by dashed lines with resizing
handles shown as circles at each corner) surround the perimeter of the
photo and the Crop task pane similar to the one shown in Figure 6-7 appears.
The Crop task pane enables you to select a crop shape (other than the default
rectangular shape matching the proportions of your original photo) and then
drag the crop marks so that only the part of the photo you want is within the
dotted lines (referred to as “the area of interest”). Note that PhotoSuite also
indicates which part of the photo will be cropped and which part is in the
area of interest (and will be retained) when you finish the cropping proce-
dure (by clicking the Done button) by making the display of the cropped area
fairly transparent while continuing to display the area of interest as normal. 
146
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

This differentiation is important when using any non-rectangular crop shape
as the program continues to display the crop marks that you manipulate as 
a rectangle that contains the crop shape you select. This means that when
using a non-rectangular crop shape, you need to pay attention to which areas
are transparent and which are in the area of interest (which no longer corre-
spond to the crop marks) order to tell what is going to be cropped and what
is going to be retained.
When defining the area of interest with the crop marks, keep these tech-
niques in mind:
 Drag anywhere on the vertical or horizontal dashed crop lines to move
them individually
 Drag the resize handles at a corner to resize both the vertical and hori-
zontal lines extending from that corner while at the same time maintain-
ing the current aspect ratio
 Press and hold down the Shift key when dragging a resize handle when
you want to move the vertical and horizontal lines extending from it
without maintaining the current aspect ratio
 Drag the entire area of interest within the photo by positioning the
mouse pointer somewhere within this area and then dragging the open
hand mouse pointer
Figure 6-7:
Use the
controls in
the Crop
task pane to
cut out all
extraneous
portions of
the photo.
147
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

To select a new proportion for the crop marks, click the new proportion set-
ting from the Standard Proportion drop-down list. The proportion refers to
the comparative relation of width to height (when the default Portrait option
button is selected) or height to width (when the Landscape option button is
selected).
To see how your photo will appear when the area indicated for cropping is cut
out (without actually going ahead with the cropping), click the Hide Cropped
Area check box to put a checkmark in it. PhotoSuite then temporarily removes
all but the indicated area of interest until you click the Hide Cropped Area
check box again to remove the checkmark. If you’re happy with the results
and want to go ahead with the cropping, click the Done button at the bottom
of the Crop task pane. If you decide against cropping the photo, click the
Cancel button instead to return to the All Edit Features task pane without
modifying the photo.
Getting reoriented or resized
The Rotate, Flip, Straighten, and Resize options on the Transform button’s
pop-up menu enable you to quickly put the photo into its correct orientation
or modify its overall size. Of all these four, the Rotate option is probably the
most important, given that whenever you turn the camera up to get a tall,
vertical shot, this photo appears as a picture in landscape mode (as though it
were laying on its side) that needs to be rotated either ninety degrees coun-
terclockwise (to the left) or clockwise (to the right).
When you open the Rotate task pane, this pane contains the following three
buttons you can use to quickly correct the orientation of most photos:
 90º Left to rotate the photo ninety degrees counterclockwise
 90º Right to rotate the photo ninety degrees clockwise
 180º to rotate the photo so that it’s completely turned upside down
If you want to rotate the photo to any other angle, you can use the combo
box right below the 180º button by typing in a particular value (representing
the number of degrees between 1 and 359 that the photo should be rotated in
a clockwise direction). You can also select the number of degrees to rotate
the photo by clicking the combo box’s Plus (+) or Minus (–) button until the
desired number of degrees is displayed in the combo box. 
If you’re more of the hands-on type, you might want to manually rotate the
photo. You do this by positioning the mouse pointer on the rotation handle
that appears from the dashed line hanging down from the top center. Then,
when the mouse pointer changes its shape so that it matches that of the rota-
tion handle’s icon (the arrow curving around and up to the right), drag the
rotation handle (and by extension the entire photo) in the direction you want
the photo oriented and then release the mouse button when it’s oriented
exactly as you want it.
148
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

The Flip option enables you to reverse the orientation of your photo. The Flip
task pane contains three buttons that you choose among when flipping your
photo:
 Horizontally so that what appears on the right in the original photo now
appears on the left
 Vertically so that appears at the top in the original photo now appears
on the bottom (this is equivalent to rotating the photo 180 degrees)
 Both Ways so that the photo is flipped both horizontally and vertically
The Straighten option enables you to straighten your photo (something I
always seem to need help with). To use this feature, you open the Straighten
task pane and then follow these simple steps:
1. Click the mouse pointer at one end of some object in the photo that
should be perfectly horizontal or vertical.
You now need to draw a horizontal or vertical line that PhotoSuite can
use as a guideline when straightening the photo (see Figure 6-8).
2. Drag the mouse pointer along the object to draw the guide line to be
used in straightening the photo horizontally or vertically.
Now you’re ready to have PhotoSuite actually straighten the picture.
Figure 6-8:
To
straighten a
photo, you
draw a

or vertical
guideline
that the
program

ening it.
149
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

3. Click the Straighten button in the Straighten task pane.
PhotoSuite straightens the photo along the line you’ve drawn.
4. Click the Next button at the bottom of the Straighten task pane.
Because straightened photos often need to be cropped, PhotoSuite dis-
plays the Crop task pane (see “Here we come a cropping” earlier in this
chapter for details).
5. (Optional) If your newly straightened photo needs some cropping
cleanup, crop the photo and then click the Done button at the bottom
of the Crop task pane.
The Resize option lets you resize your photo by dragging the picture’s bor-
ders. To increase or decrease the overall photo size in the Resize task pane,
you follow these steps:
1. Click the More Settings button in Resize task pane.
PhotoSuite then displays the Width and Height text boxes along with the
Units drop-down list box that you can use to keep an eye on how small
or large you’re actually making the picture (it’s often hard to tell on the
screen when the magnification setting is anything other 100%).
2. Drag the sizing handles (the circles at each corner and in the center of
each side) around the photo until it is the size you want.
If you’re making the photo larger and you’re having trouble dragging the
sizing handles, decrease the picture’s magnification by clicking the Zoom
Out button or by selecting a new magnification setting in the Select
Zoom Level drop-down list and then try Step 2 again.
Before setting the new picture size, you should now check its dimensions
(this can be important if you intend to print the photo and it’s now larger
than the paper size your printer can handle).
3. Check the new dimensions in the Width and Height text boxes and if
they’re okay, click the Done button at the bottom of the Resize task
pane to actually resize the photo.
Of course, if you happen to know the exact dimensions you want to use in
resizing the photo, you can enter them into the Width and Height text boxes.
However, keep in mind that as long as the Maintain Proportions check box
has a checkmark in it, entering a new value into either one of these text boxes
automatically changes the value in the corresponding text box. (By the way,
to have PhotoSuite actually change the size of the photo in the work area
after you’ve typed in a new value into either the Width or Height text box,
you must click the I-beam mouse pointer in the other text box.)
Don’t remove the checkmark from the Maintain Proportions check box before
you start resizing the photo either manually or by entering new values into
the Width or Height text boxes unless you are sure you know what you’re
doing. By resizing a photo without regard to the aspect ratio between the
150
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

width and the height (that’s the proportions that are being maintained), you
can end up with a photo that’s really distorted.
Achieving that perfect photo effect
PhotoSuite is the best when it comes to easy-to-apply special effects. In addi-
tion to the ready-made special effects you have to choose from, you can also
lighten a photo by increasing its transparency setting or give the photo a real
old-fashioned look by using the Edge Fading control to dissolve its edges.
In addition to applying these filters, transparency, and edging effects, you can
also add text to your photos, paint and draw on them, and even add cutouts
that remove particular shapes from the photo (a really handy technique when
combined with non-rectangular crop shapes where you want to cut off the
white areas that fill in the original rectangle that are left behind after crop-
ping the photo to the new shape).
Dazzling special effects for every mood
PhotoSuite includes a wide array of special effects that can really change the
look of your photo. To have a gander at all the effects and experiment with
what they do (or don’t do for your photo), click the Effects button in the All
Edit Features task pane and then click Special Effects at the top of its pop
up menu.
PhotoSuite then opens the Special Effects task pane that contains an Effects
list box that displays thumbnails of but a small portion of all the effects
offered by the program. To narrow the list by displaying only a particular
category of special effects, click the drop-down list button to the right of 
All Effects and then click the category (Adjust Color through Warp) in the
drop-down list whose effects you want displayed in the Effects list box. You
can also display thumbnails of all the special effects on a pop-up palette (as
shown in Figure 6-9) by clicking the Palette pop-up button (the one with the
arrowhead pointing to the right) immediately to the right of the Effects drop-
down list button.
When you click one of the special effect thumbnails, PhotoSuite immediately
applies that special effect to the preview of your photo shown in work area
on the right side of the PhotoSuite window. If you don’t like the effect, you
can just go ahead and choose another (PhotoSuite’s special effects are not
cumulative so you don’t have to cancel one effect before trying another).
Note that some of the special effects enable you to adjust their settings (this
is especially true of the more radical effects in such categories as Blur, Distort,
Pattern, and Texture). You can tell when the special effect you’ve selected
allows you to modify its settings because the Adjust Settings button in the
Special Effects becomes active (that is, it is no longer grayed out).
151
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

When you click the Adjust Settings button to modify the settings for the spe-
cial effect you’ve selected, the Special Effects task pane displays whatever
controls that that particular special effect offers for modifying its settings
(usually in the form of sliders). After you’ve finished modifying the special
effect’s settings, click the Done button to return to the normal Special Effects
task pane (you can also abandon your changes when returning to this task
pane by clicking the Cancel button instead).
When you’ve got the special effect that you want to stay with, click the Done
button at the bottom of the Special Effects task pane to return to the All Edit
Features task pane. If you want to dump the special effect that you thought
was so cool a moment ago, click the Cancel button instead.
Adding text to your photos
PhotoSuite makes it easy to annotate your pictures with text. You can use
this feature to add titles to your photos. To do this, click the Text button and
then click the Add or Edit Text item at the top of its pop-menu. PhotoSuite
then displays the Add or Edit Text task pane like the one shown in Figure 6-10
where you can enter the title or whatever label you want to add and then
select the text color, font, font size, font attributes, and alignment for it.

To annotate your photo with text in the Add or Edit Text task pane, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Add a New Text Object button.
After you click this button, PhotoSuite puts the cursor in the Edit Text
list box and adds a new text box in the center of your photo.
2. Type the text you want to appear in the photo in the Edit Text list box.
To add line breaks to the title or comments you’re typing, press the
Enter key.
Now you’re ready to adjust the text settings beginning with the text
color. By default, PhotoSuite selects black as the text color which only
works when placing the text on a very light background in the photo.
3. (Optional) Click the Color drop-down button and then click the text
color you want to use on the pop-up palette.
If you want to use a color that appears in the photo, click the eyedrop-
per icon in the lower-right corner of the color palette and then click the
color you want to use in photo. If you want to mix a sample color, click
the More Colors button in the lower-left corner of the color palette and
then create a new color by entering the appropriate Red, Green, and
Blue values or by dragging the crosshairs in the Hues and Shades
sample boxes before clicking OK.

Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

By default, PhotoSuite picks Tahoma as the font in which to display the
text. If you wish, you can select another font to use from a wide variety
of fonts that PhotoSuite makes available.
4. (Optional) Click the Font drop-down button and then click the name of
the font you want to use in the drop-down list.
By default, PhotoSuite selects 7 points as the font size (pretty small by
any reckoning). If you wish, you can select a larger font size to use.
5. (Optional) Type a new point size in the Font Size combo box or use its
Plus (+) or Minus (–) buttons to select a new point size.
In addition to adjusting the font and font size, you can also change the
alignment of the text in its text box (which is centered both horizontally
and vertically by default), add the bold, italics, or underlining attribute
to the text, and even scrunch up or spread out the text in the text box by
modifying the horizontal spacing percentages (percentages below 100%
bring the text closer together and percentages above 100% spread it out).
6. (Optional) Make any necessary adjustments to the text alignment, text
attributes, or to the horizontal scaling.
PhotoSuite positions the new text box in the dead center of the photo.
Almost all the time, you’ll want to move the text box to a more appropri-
ate location in the photograph.
7. Position the mouse pointer inside the text box and when the pointer
changes to an open hand, drag the text box to the desired position on
the photo.
In addition to repositioning the text box in the photo, you may also want
to re-orient the text by rotating the text box.
8. (Optional) Position the mouse pointer on the rotation handle (the
larger ball in the middle at the top of the box) and then when the
mouse pointer turns into a circular arrow drag it until the text is 
oriented just as you want it to appear in the final photo.
When you have the text positioned and oriented the way you want it,
you’re ready to set it.
9. Click the Done button to return to the All Edit Features task and then
click outside the text box to remove the box’s outline as well as its
sizing and rotation handles.
After returning the All Edit Features task pane, don’t forget to save the changes
you’ve made to the photo (and by extension, the text you added) with the
File➪Save or File➪Save As commands on the PhotoSuite menu bar.
Touching up your photos with painting and drawing
You can use PhotoSuite’s painting and drawing tools to touch up your photos
or even add either freehand or predefined shapes to your photos. These
154
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

tools include a paint brush tool that you can use to add brushstrokes to your
photo, a flood fill tool that you can use to fill particular areas of the photo
with color, and a touchup paint tool that enables you to add color to the
photo by actually painting on it (when you use the paint brush and flood fill
tool, you create and add new graphic art objects to the photo, which means
that you can continue to edit it because the object is on its own layer).
In addition to adding painting and drawing to your photo, you can also add
standard shapes such as circles, squares, triangles, and the like with the
Predefined Shapes item on the Paint & Draw pop-up menu as well as create
custom shapes of your own design with the Custom Shapes menu item. Note,
however, that you will mostly want to reserve the adding of shapes to photo
projects where they can combine with the photos you’re adding rather than
literally overshadow them (see “Playing with PhotoSuite Project Templates”
later in this chapter for information on creating projects).
In the Paint Brush task pane (opened by selecting Paint Brush on the Paint &
Draw button’s pop-up menu), you need to select the brush shape and paint
color. You can then use the three sliders to refine your brush settings:
 Size to increase or decrease the size of the paint brush (reflected in the
size of the mouse pointer in the photo)
 Transparency to determine how solid or faint the brush strokes are
 Edge Fading to determine how much each stroke blends into the
background
After you finish setting your brush settings, you can drag the mouse pointer
to paint strokes on the photo. If you make a mistake and want to erase a par-
ticular stroke, click the Undo Last Change button to remove it.
Note that working with the touchup brush in the Touchup Brush task pane is
similar except that in addition to selecting your brush shape, paint color,
brush size, transparency, and edge fading settings, you need to select a par-
ticular style of the touchup brush that determines what kind of painting you
do. These brush style selections include a wide variety of effects which the
PhotoSuite attempts to illustrate through the use of butterfly thumbnails dis-
played above the name of each brush type in the Select a Touchup Brush list
box (you can also display a pop-up palette of brush styles by clicking the
pop-up button to the right of this list box). 
Note that the function of most of the brush styles in this list is far from evi-
dent from their thumbnails. You should experiment with them to see just
what effects they produce, as some are quite surprising. For example, the
Lighten brush style actually lightens the colors of whatever object you paint
with it rather than putting down the paint color you’ve selected. So too, the
Transparency brush style actually removes all color acting like an eraser in
other paint programs.
155
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

When you paint with the touchup brush using the settings you’ve chosen,
PhotoSuite does not put down each stroke as a separate graphics object
(indicated by the lack of selection handles along the brushstroke). This does
not mean that you can’t delete a brushstroke made with the touchup brush
(you do this by clicking the Undo Last Change), but it does mean that you
can’t do any more editing to the brushstroke, such as move or rotate it after
you’ve finish painting with this brush (something you can do when using the
regular paint brush).
Getting ready to use the flood fill tool in the Flood Fill task pane (opened by
clicking Flood Fill on the Paint& Brush button’s pop-up menu) is very similar
to getting ready to use the touchup brush tool in that you must select a fill
style in the Select a Fill Style list box (using the exact same list of styles illus-
trated with the very same butterfly thumbnails as in Select a Touchup Brush
list box), fill color, transparency, and edge fading.
Instead of setting the brush size as you do in the Touchup Brush task pane, in
the Flood Fill task pane, you indicate how the pixels in the photo are selected
for filling using the Tolerance slider. If you set a low tolerance with this slider,
PhotoSuite fills the pixels area you click with the paint bucket mouse pointer
that are the same color or very close in hue. If you set a high tolerance with
this slider, PhotoSuite fills the pixels that are similar but not exactly same in
the area you click.
After making your modifications to the flood fill settings, you can fill sections
of the photo by clicking the paint bucket mouse pointer on the area you want
filled. Which pixels are filled with the selected color using the designated fill
style in the area you click depends upon the tolerance you use. If you want 
to fill more areas than the current tolerance allows, you can drag the paint
bucket mouse pointer around the area to be filled. If PhotoSuite ends up fill-
ing more of the photo that you wanted, click the Undo Last Fill button in the
Flood Fill task pane to remove it.
Now, cut that out!
The Create Cutout feature enables you to separate an area of special interest
in a photo from its background by cutting that area out so that you can save
it in it own graphics file. When defining the object or area in a photo to cut
out, you can either enclose the area in a wide variety of predefined shapes 
or you can select the area by tracing it or having PhotoSuite automatically
attempt to trace the area by its edges or its color.
To create a cutout using a predefined shape, you follow these steps:
1. Open the Create Cutout task pane by clicking Create Cutout option on
the Cutouts & Masks button’s pop-up menu.
The initial step in this pane is labeled 1, How Would You Like the
Selected Item to be Cutout. It contains two option buttons: By Using
156
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

Preset Shapes (selected by default) and By Freehand Tracing, Edge
Tracing, or Picking Colors.
2. Make sure that the By Using Preset Shapes option button is selected
and then click Next button at the bottom of the Create Cutout pane.
The Create Cutout pane now contains the next two areas: 2 where you
choose the shape(s) you want to use in defining the area of the photo-
graph to cut out and 3 where you can adjust the cutout selection by
inverting it.
3. Click the shape that you want to use in defining the cutout in the list
box and then click the Add Selected Shape button.
When you click the Add Selected Shape button, PhotoSuite inserts that
shape in your photo surrounded by a rotation and sizing handles.
4. Move, size, and rotate the shape as required so that it encloses the
area to be included in the cutout.
When enclosing the cutout area with preset shapes, you can use more
than one shape (Figure 6-11 shows an example of this where I combined
a triangle and rectangle to enclose Transamerica Pyramid building in
downtown San Francisco). When the Combine with Current Selection
option button is selected (as it is by default), PhotoSuite adds each new
shape to the cutout. When you click the Subtract From Current Selection
option button, each new shape reduces the cutout area (depending on
how you make them overlap the original cutout shape, you can end up
with very interesting effects). PhotoSuite differentiates between the
shape enclosing the cutout and that outside of the cutout by displaying
the cutout area normally and all that beyond the cutout as transparent.
If you’re happy with the cutout selection and are ready to save it in a
new file or make it into a new graphics object, proceed to Step 6. If, how-
ever, you want to cut out everything but what’s in the shape(s) you’ve
set in the photo, you need to take Step 5 first.
5. (Optional) If you want to make the cutout everything in the photo but
what’s enclosed within the preset shapes, click the Invert Selection
button.
Now you’re ready to proceed to area 4 where you take the last steps in
the process.
6. Click the Next button at the bottom of the Create Cutout task pane.
The area marked 4 in the Create Cutout task pane contains three option
buttons to choose from: Cut It Out to copy the cutout selection to a new
graphics file, Create a New Object (the default) to copy the cutout as a
new graphics object in the same photo (so that’s superimposed on the
original photo), or Cookie-cut It Out to turn the cutout into a new graph-
ics object in the photo that is removed from the rest of the photo (and
therefore leaves a hole in it when you move the graphic).
157
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

7. Select the type of cutout you want to create by selecting the Cut It Out,
Create a New Object, or Cookie-cut It Out option button and then click
the Next button.
Depending upon which option button is selected when you click the
Next button, the final Create Cutout task pane either contains one or two
additional steps. When the Cut It Out option button is selected, you can
only modify the transparency and edge fading settings before saving the
cutout either to a new file or to the Windows Clipboard. When you select
either of the other two, you can also move, resize, or rotate the cutout in
the current photo.
8. Make any necessary adjustments to the cutout’s transparency or edge
fading settings by dragging the appropriate slider.
If you want, you can now save a copy of the cutout in a separate file or
copy it to the Windows Clipboard so that you can quickly paste it into
another photo you’re editing or into another photo project you’re
creating.
9. (Optional) Click the Save Cutout to a File button and then select the
folder into which to save the file and enter its filename in the Save As
dialog box before you click the Save button.
Note that PhotoSuite allows you to save your cutout only in the PNG
graphics files format. If you need the file in another graphics file format,
Figure 6-11:
You can
combine
preset
shapes
when using
shapes to
define the
area to
cutout.
158
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

open the resulting PNG file and then use the program’s File➪Save As
command to convert it to another format by selecting that format in the
Files of Type drop-down list before clicking the Save button.
10. (Optional) To copy the cutout to the Windows Clipboard for later past-
ing in other projects and programs, click the Copy Cutout to the
Clipboard button.
If you used the Create a New Object or Cookie-cut It Out options, you
can still move, resize, or rotate the selected cutout before leaving the
Create Cutout task pane.
11. (Optional) Reposition, resize, and/or rotate the cutout shape as
needed in the photo.
Now you’re ready to close the Create Cutout task pane and return to the
All Edit Features task pane.
12. Click the Done button at the bottom of the Create Cutout task pane.
If you retained a copy of the cutout in the original photo (as opposed to
saving the cutout in a separate PNG file), you may want to save your
changes in a new or the original graphics file.
13. (Optional) To save the cutout in the original photo file, choose File➪
Save on the PhotoSuite menu bar. To save the modified photo with
cutout in a new file, choose File➪Save As and modify the folder loca-
tion and/or filename before you click the Save button in the Save As
dialog box.
Note that once you’re back in the All Edit Features task pane, you can still
manipulate the cutout in the photo and even delete it, if you decide it’s no
longer necessary (by pressing the Delete key or right-clicking the object and
then clicking Delete on its shortcut menu).
Cutouts using predefined shapes are great for giving whimsical or meaningful
shapes to the parts of photos that you intend to put into a collage project
(see “Calling all collages” later in this chapter). For example, you can cut out
heart-shaped figures in photos intended for valentines or wedding collages
and cards or starburst-shaped ones for graduation albums.
The procedure for creating a cutout by freehand tracing, edge tracing, or
picking colors is similar in every way except for the procedure of actually
selecting the cutout area. After clicking the By Freehand Tracing, Edge
Tracing, or Picking Colors option button in the initial Cutout task pane, you
have a choice among the following methods:
 Freehand Tracing: choose this option button to manually designate the
cutout area by clicking a starting point (which appears as a white circle)
and then tracing all around the area until you meet back with and con-
nect the selection by clicking on the starting point (as you trace, you
159
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

can click to establish intermediary points that enable you to turn cor-
ners and change direction)
 Edge Tracing: choose this option button to manually designate the
cutout area by clicking a starting point (which appears as a white circle)
and then clicking all around the area until you close the selection by
clicking on the start point and then clicking the Done Tracing button in
the Create Cutout task pane
 Picking Colors: choose this option button to select the cutout area
simply by clicking on its color in the photo with the magic wand mouse
pointer (you can use the Tolerance slider to determine how much the
hues can differ when making the selection)
After selecting the cutout area using any of these three methods, the rest of the
steps outlined for creating cutouts from predefined shapes apply (that is, from
Step 5 on in the step-by-step procedure that appears earlier in this section).
Mask that effect!
The Create Mask feature enables you to apply a special effect to just a partic-
ular area in your photo by masking out and thereby protecting all the other
areas in the picture. The procedure for actually creating the mask (which,
remember, defines the area that you can then apply special effects to) is iden-
tical to that for creating cutouts: you can either create a mask using any of
the preset shapes or by freehand tracing, edge tracing, or picking colors (see
“Now, cut that out!” earlier in this chapter for details).
Once you’ve defined the mask in the Create Mask task pane (opened by click-
ing Create Mask on the Create Cutouts & Masks button’s pop-up menu), you
are ready to use it when applying special effects in the Special Effects task pane
(opened by clicking Special Effects on the Effects button’s pop-up menu —
see “Dazzling special effects for every mood” earlier in this chapter for details).
You can tell when the effect that you select is going to be applied only to the
area in a mask because of the addition of the Disable/Enable Mask button to
the toolbar in the photo’s viewing area. This toggle button enables you to
temporarily remove the mask so that the effect you select applies to the
entire photo and not just the area within the mask you created (because it is
a toggle button, you can re-enable the mask and limit a special effect to it by
clicking the Disable/Enable Mask button a second time).
Figure 6-12 illustrates how this masking thing works. For this photo, I created
a mask that included only the buildings on Columbus Street in San Francisco,
featuring the blue sky. I then applied the Antique special effect to the photo.
Because of the mask, only the buildings within the mask are given the sepia
tone, leaving the sky its deep, azure blue (a fact that you surely can’t appreci-
ate seeing the photo only in black-and-white).

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

Superimposing one photo on another
PhotoSuite’s Add Photos button in the All Edit Features task pane makes it
easy to combine photos by superimposing one on top of the other. This fea-
ture makes it easy to put together a photo montage that combines different
images into one. In addition to making it possible to add photos, PhotoSuite
also lets you add what it calls props (and what I think of more as stock images
along the line of Windows clipart but a great deal classier) to your photos.
To superimpose a photo on top of the photo you’re currently editing, you
follow these steps:
1. In the All Edit Features task pane, click the Add Photos button and then
click Add Photos & Cutouts at the top of the button’s pop-up menu.
The Add dialog box (which works just like the Open dialog box) appears
where you select the folder or collection containing the photo or the
cutout saved in its own file (see “Now, cut that out!” earlier in this chap-
ter) you want to add and then click the photo’s filename before clicking
the Add button.

Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

2. Open the collection or file folder that contains the file with the photo
or cutout you want to add, then click the graphic file’s icon before you
click the Add button.
When the Add dialog box closes, the added photo appears selected
(indicated by its sizing and rotation handles) in the center of the photo
you’re currently editing. Next, you can reposition and, if necessary,
resize and rotate the added photo.
3. Resize and rotate the added image and then drag it to its final position
on the background photo.
You can also edit this added photo with any of the features available on
the Overall Quality, Facial Flaws, Damaged Photos, and Effects button in
the All Edit Features task pane.
4. (Optional) Making any needed editing changes to the added photo,
including improving its overall quality, removing red eye and dust, or
adding special effects, changing the transparency, or adding a shadow.
Now you’re ready to save your changes either in the original graphics
file, or, more likely in a new graphics file.
5. Choose File➪Save on the PhotoSuite menu bar to save your combined
photos in the original photo’s file or choose File➪Save As and modify the
folder location and/or filename before you click the Save button in the
Save As dialog box to save your photo montage in a new graphics file.
When you add one photo to another, PhotoSuite opens a Gallery pane which
shows you thumbnails of each of the photos you’re working with. You can
use this Gallery to easily select the photo you want to edit: simply click its
thumbnail in the Gallery pane. PhotoSuite shows you that the photo you click
is now selected in the work area by enclosing the photo in dashed lines and
adding sizing and rotation handles to it.
As I mention at the beginning of this section, instead of superimposing just
photos on top of the photo you’re editing, you can also add what the pro-
gram likes to call props, which are small pictures of different isolated objects
such as animals, vegetables, musical instruments, and the like.
To superimpose one of PhotoSuite’s props on the photo you’re currently edit-
ing, you follow these steps:
1. Click Add Photos & Cutouts button in the All Edit Features task pane
and then click Add Props on its pop-up menu.
The Add Props task pane opens showing a list of all the Prop collections
included with the program.
2. Click the drop-down button in the Select a Prop drop-down list box
and then the name of the Prop category you want to use.
If you click the All item at the very top of the list, PhotoSuite displays
thumbnails of all its prop photos in one huge list. You can also have a
162
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

better gander at these thumbnails by clicking the pop-up Palette button
(the one with the arrowhead pointing towards the right).
3. Double-click the thumbnail of the prop you want to add or drag it
over to the photo in the work area and drop it anywhere.
PhotoSuite superimposes a copy of the prop in the exact center of the
background photo. Now you’re ready to resize it and put the prop in its
proper position (I dare you to say that twenty times really fast).
4. If needed, resize the prop and rotate it before you drag it to the
desired position in relation to the background photo.
To see how your prop fits in with the background, you may want to
select it (especially if you reduced its size) to remove all the selection
hash marks and sizing and rotation handles. You can do this by clicking
the background photo anywhere outside of the prop or by clicking the
thumbnail image of the background photo in the Gallery pane.
5. Click the Done button and then save the changes to the file in the All
Edit Features task pane with File➪Save or in a new file with File➪
Save As.
Figure 6-13 shows my photo of Columbus Street with the Transamerica
Pyramid after adding the Hot Air Balloon prop and positioning it up in the
sky. (I sure hope that that balloon doesn’t end up coming down on the top of
that Pyramid building’s spike — ouch!)

Playing with PhotoSuite
Project Templates
PhotoSuite goes out of its way to make it easy to use your digital photos to
create fun and interesting photo projects. These projects run the gamut from
the ever-popular photo collage to posters. All are based on adding your own
digital photos to project templates that give you ready-made background
and, in many cases, stock text that you can adapt to your own needs. 
To get a list of the various types of projects that PhotoSuite supports, launch
PhotoSuite and then click the Projects link in the Edit & Create area of its
Home Page. PhotoSuite opens the Create a Project task pane where you can
select any of the following projects in the Project Type list box:
 Collage to make a collage with your photos using either a blank collage
background or any of a number of pre-designed backgrounds including
those for the new baby, birthdays, Christmas, weddings, and so on
 Albums to put your photos into the pages of photo albums using pre-
designed pages dedicated to subjects such as the new baby, your wed-
ding, the latest vacation, and the like
 Calendars to make calendars with your own photos using any of a wide
variety of different calendar designs
 Cards to make greeting cards with your own photos for almost all the
major holidays and occasions (including birthdays, anniversaries, grad-
uation, and so on)
 Gift Tags to make gift tags carrying your photos for decorating anniver-
sary, birthday, and Christmas presents
 Magazines to add your photos to pre-designed magazine covers for sub-
jects as diverse as Cooking, Computer, Health & Beauty, Teen, Sports,
Outdoor Adventure, and Home Décor (to name a few)
 Postcards to add your vacation photos to any of the various travel post-
card designs
 Posters to make a poster using your own photos for events such as the
Book Club, Concert, Birthday, and so on
In all categories, PhotoSuite makes it as easy as possible to create your new
photo project by walking you through the steps. In most cases, all you have
to do is select the project template you want to use, choose the photos you
want to add to that template, and then make a few changes to modify the
arrangement of the photos and customize the stock text.
164
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

Bring on the Borders
PhotoSuite’s Borders feature enables you to give your photos a finished look
by surrounding them with some sort of decorative border. When you click
the Borders link in the PhotoSuite Home Page, The Borders task pane opens
giving you a choice between three different types of borders:
 Frame to surround the photo in any of a wide variety of frame-type
graphics
 Mat to mat the photo either with a solid color or colored texture
 Edge to select a type of edging that you then combine with a mat color
or pattern
When you select the Frame option (the default), PhotoSuite then lets you
choose a particular frame style and size (3.5x5, 4x6, 5x7, or 8x10). After you
select the frame to use, PhotoSuite then lets you move and, if necessary, resize
the photo in the frame in the program’s work area. To help you in moving and
resizing the photo in its frame, PhotoSuite indicates the edges of the image
by showing its perimeter as a dotted line with round sizing handles at the
corners and midpoints. Most often these edges image extend beyond the
cutout portion of the frame. Moving and/or resizing the photo in the frame
therefore displays different parts of the image in the cutout region (the frame
actually ends up cropping parts of the image). Be careful when manipulating
the image in the frame that you don’t expose the white background behind
the photo or crop a part of the image that you want displayed.
When you select the Mat option, PhotoSuite lets you select the proper mat
among a wide variety of solid colored and textured (patterned) mats, or even
enables you to select a photo as the textured mat. After selecting the mat
color or texture, you then designate the size of the mat and can adjust the
width of the mat as well as control whether or not to display beveling on the
mat’s edges and include v-groove (and adjust its offset from the inside of the
mat). At the end of the process of adding a mat, PhotoSuite even gives you
the opportunity to add a frame to surround the mat before you save your
masterpiece.
When you select the Edge option, PhotoSuite lets you select an edging style
to use with the matting. Immediately after you select the Edge style to use,
you’re given the opportunity to select the mat color or texture that you want
to use with that style. After you select the mat color or texture, its size, and
thickness, you are then given the chance to select a frame to surround the
mat before you save your work of art.

Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

Stitching It All Together
PhotoSuite’s Photo Stitch feature makes it possible to create a single photo
with a sweeping panorama from sequential and overlapping individual photos
that you take of the same view. This feature is great provided that you’ve
done your homework and the photos that you’re trying to stitch together
match up and overlap correctly. Accordingly, Roxio has set up some impor-
tant guidelines for you to follow before attempting to stitch together your
favorite photos of the Grand Canyon:
 Use a tripod when taking the photos to stitch together (if you don’t have
a tripod, try to keep the camera level and in same position when taking
the pictures by rotating your body around the camera rather than rotat-
ing the camera around your body)
 Overlap each photo that you take in the sequence (Roxio recommends
between 20% to 40% overlap on each shot)
 Don’t change any of the settings on your camera between the shots
you take
 Use only optical zoom when taking the picture: if your camera has a
digital zoom, don’t use it in shooting the photo sequence
 Take your photos in sequence from left to right or if you’re scanning in
developed photos, scan them in left-to-right order to ensure that their
filenames appear in order
 Do not edit your photos in PhotoSuite before you stitch them together:
instead, edit the final panorama produced by Photo Stitch
 Rotate your camera 90 degrees to take portrait shots of the panorama:
doing this requires more shots but results in a much taller panorama
with more detail
In addition to following these guidelines when taking the shots you would later
like to stitch together, you must have one more piece of information at your
fingertips when using Photo Stitch and that is the focal length used in taking
the photos. Now focal length as any photographer will tell you is distance
between the film (or CCD in a digital camera) and the optical center of the
lens when the lens is set on infinity (this distance is usually given in millime-
ters and marked on the side of the fixed lenses on a standard 35mm camera).
Trying to determine the focal length for digital cameras, even real fancy ones
like my Sony that are equipped with an optical zoom lens, can be difficult.
Determining this information is complicated by the fact that the actual focal
166
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

length for digital cameras is much less than for a standard 35mm camera
because their CCDs are much smaller than 35mm film. 
If your digital camera has an optical zoom lens, check and see if the camera
records the focal length at the time you take your photos. If your camera
doesn’t record this information (I know that mine doesn’t), check your
camera manual. If you can’t find that or it doesn’t give you a clue as to the
focal length of your lens when set at infinity, you’ll just have to guess when it
comes time to give Photo Stitch that information.
The procedure for stitching two or more sequential photos together to create
a single panoramic photo is as follows:
1. Launch PhotoSuite and then click the Photo Stitch link on the
PhotoSuite Home Page.
Next you need to select the photos to stitch together. You must select a
minimum of two photos although most panoramas (especially those
taken in portrait mode) require more.
2. Click the photos you want to stitch together in the Most Recently Used
Photos list box or click the Add More Photos button and select them
in the Add dialog box and then click the Next button.
Photo Stitch now gives you an opportunity to make any adjustments to
the rotation or order of the photos you added to the work area. If they’re
not in order, you need to use the Sort Ascending button or drag them
into order (don’t forget to select the Fit to Page setting at the very
bottom of the Select Zoom Level drop-down list box to display all the
photos together in the work area).
3. Make any necessary adjustments to the orientation or order of the
photos so that they’re all in portrait or landscape mode and are left-to-
right order for stitching and then click the Next button.
Photo Stitch now attempts to automatically determine the focal length
of your photos. If it can’t determine this value (which is true for most
of the digital photos you take), you need to select this value by
dragging the Focal Length slider until the correct number (in millimeters)
appears immediately above the right end of the Focal Length slider
(see Figure 6-14).
4. (Optional) If Photo Stitch can’t automatically determine the focal
length for your photos; select the correct length (or your best guess)
with the Focal Length slider.
Now you’re ready to have Photo Stitch do its magic.
167
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

5. Click the Auto Align button.
Photo Stitch stitches together your photos, showing you a preview of
the new panorama in the work area. If you notice some problems, try
clicking the Fine Tuning button to see if Photo Stitch can detect and fix
the problem. If this doesn’t do it, click and manually drag the photos
into final position (remember that you can use the arrow keys to nudge
the selected photo into place).
6. If necessary, fine-tune the positioning of the photos and then click the
Next button.
Photo Stitch shows you the final product ready for you to save or print
(see Figure 6-15). Be sure to save your photo before you click the Done
button to return to the PhotoSuite Home Page.
7. Click the Save button and then save your new panoramic photo in the
DMSP file format in the Save As dialog box.
After saving your panorama, you can edit its graphics file in PhotoSuite as
you would any other digital photo that you at your disposal. Now is the time
to use Overall Quality features to improve any exposure or color balance
problems.

Group Editing
The last PhotoSuite feature to look at is the Multi Photo Enhance feature.
This one enables you to do group editing to a bunch of photos that all need
the same kind of modifications or enhancements. It’s a real timesaver when
you have a lot of photos that all need the same kind of changes made to them.
The modifications and enhancements that you can perform at one time on a
group of photos include:
 Fix to take care of any of the exposure, color saturation, sharpness, or
red eye problems in the group (you can even use the PhotoDoctor on
them)
 Transform to rotate, flip, or resize all the photos in the group in the
same way
 Special Effects to apply the Black and White, Invert, or Sepia special
effects to all the photos in the group

Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

 Rename to give new filenames made up of a keyword and a sequential
number (such as Newbaby00, Newbaby01, Newbaby02, and so on)
 Convert to convert the group from one type of graphics file to another
(such as DMSP to JPEG for use on the Internet)
Among the most important and unique modifications that you can perform with
the Multi Photo Enhance feature are surely the Rename and Convert options.
The Rename option enables you to name of group of related photo files so 
that they all show up together in a preset order in any file listing you do. The
Convert option enables you to move a batch of photos from one file format to
another in a fraction of the time it would take to convert them individually.
Printing and Sharing Your Photos
The Print option at the top of the Print & Share area at the bottom of the
PhotoSuite Home Page enables you to print photos individually, in groups
arranged for different types of photo paper, or even altogether as a contact
sheet. You can use the E-mail link in the Print & Share area to e-mail photos to
your friends and family. When sending photos, you have a choice between
sending them as attachments to your messages or in the body of the message
itself. 
You can also use the E-mail link to assemble a bunch of photos together, add
in a favorite tune as background music and package the whole thing up as a
Windows WMV multimedia video file that you can then send to friends and
family as an e-mail attachment. Your e-mail recipients can then open and play
the resulting multimedia file as an automated slideshow complete with music
using the Windows Media Player on their computers.
Finally, you can use the Online Photo Services link at the very bottom of the
Print & Share area of the PhotoSuite Home Page to connect to the Roxio
Photo Center where you can get your favorite digital photos professionally
printed or post them to a Web page which your friends and family can then
visit to see your latest and greatest snapshots.
Printing your own photos
Printing your photos with PhotoSuite is a straightforward process. About the
only thing that could be considered the least little bit challenging about it is
figuring out which photos you want to group together when printing snap-
shots at smaller sizes on paper that can accommodate multiple pictures
together on the same page.
170
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

After you click the Print link on the PhotoSuite Home Page and select the
photos you want to print, the Print task pane gives you the following printing
options:
 One Photo per Page to print each of the selected photos on a separate
sheet of paper
 Multiple Photos per Page to choose between a wide variety of layouts
using different readily-available paper, card, and label stock for printing
more than one photo per page
 As a Contact Sheet to print all the selected photos sequentially as
thumbnails with their filenames for easy identification
After you select your printing option and in the cases of the Multiple Photos
per Page and As a Contact Sheet options, the page layout, you are then given
the opportunity to select the printer to use, the photo layout on the page,
and the number of copies. Figure 6-16 shows these options as they appear
when you select the One Photo per Page printing option.
Figure 6-16:
Getting

171
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

When specifying the photo layout for the One Photo per Page printing option,
PhotoSuite gives you a choice among three different sizing options:
 Resize to Fit (the default) to reduce photos to the size required for them
to print within the margins for the specified paper size
 Crop to Fill to crop the photos as required for them to fill the page and
still print within the margins for the specified paper size
 Stretch to Fit to stretch the photos as required for them to fill the page
and still print within the margins for the specified paper size
When specifying the photo layout for the Multiple Photos per Page printing
option, PhotoSuite lets you decide between printing the same photo as many
times on the same page as your selected photo size allows with the default
Fill Each Page with Same Photo option button) and printing each of the
selected photos only once per page with the Use Each Photo option button.
Note that when you select the Use Each Photo option button, the Times text
box (with 1 as the default value) becomes available. If you want to have each
of the multiple photos that you’ve selected printed a set number of times
(using as many pages as the photo size and layout require), you enter that
number in this text box.
When specifying the photo layout for the As a Contact Sheet printing option,
PhotoSuite lets you specify the number of columns and rows (with 4 columns
in 5 rows being the default) and the spacing between them. You can also
choose not to print the filenames beneath each thumbnail by clicking the
Print Titles check box to remove its checkmark.
After specifying your print settings, be sure that you’ve loaded your printer
with the right type of paper and that the printer is ready to go before you
click the Print button at the bottom of the Print task pane to start the print
job. During the brief moments that PhotoSuite takes to send your photo(s) to
the printer, you can click the OK button in the Cancel dialog box if you decide
to stop the printing. After PhotoSuite finishes printing your photo(s), click
the Done button in the Print task pane to return to the PhotoSuite Home Page.
E-mailing your photos
PhotoSuite makes it easy to e-mail your edited photos to friends and family.
When e-mailing photos, you can send them as attachments to an e-mail mes-
sage or in the body of the message. To send your photos as part of a new
e-mail message, you follow these steps:
172
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

1. Launch PhotoSuite and then click the E-mail link in the Print & Share
area of the PhotoSuite Home Page.
PhotoSuite opens the E-mail task pane that asks you to select the
photo(s) you want to send. If these photos are among those shown in
the Most Recently Used list box, you can select them by clicking their
thumbnails in this list box. If the photo(s) are not listed here, click the
Add More Files button and then select them by opening the appropriate
file folder or collection and clicking them in the Add dialog box.
2. Select the photo or photos you want to send either from the Most
Recently Used list box or the Add dialog box opened by clicking the
Add More Files button and then click the Next button.
The E-mail task pane that now appears enables you to choose between
the default option, Send as Individual Files, and the option, Package All
Files Into One Slideshow. Because you want to send your photos as indi-
vidual files (either within the body of the e-mail message or as separate
attachments, you leave the default option button selected).
This task pane also contains an E-mail options button that you can
select to modify the general options for sending your e-mail and getting
your selected photos ready to send. By default, PhotoSuite is automati-
cally set to warn when your total attachment file size exceeds a limit of
1Mb and to automatically convert your photos to the JPEG graphics file
type optimized for a screen display set to a resolution of 800x600 pixels
(many Internet service providers impose limits of 2Mb on e-mail attach-
ments and large attachments not only take a really long time to send on
a dial-up connection and forever to download on the other end but are
more prone to errors that prevent successful transmission). If you want,
you can make these options on the General and Photos tabs in the E-mail
Options dialog box.
3. Make any necessary changes in the E-mail Options dialog box (opened
by clicking the E-mail Options button) to the e-mail options on the
General and Photos tabs before you click the Next button.
The E-mail task pane that now appears enables you to either send your
photos now using your current e-mail program (the default) or save the
photos for sending later on. This task pane also contains a Format Photos
as HTML Message check box that you select if you want your photo(s)
placed inside the body of a new e-mail message rather than sent as file
attachments. Note, however, that not all e-mail servers accept HTML
e-mail (in which case, the photos get sent as attachments).
4. Leave the Send Now Using My Default E-mail Client option button
selected, but be sure to click the Format Photos as HTML Message
check box if you want the photo(s) to appear in the body of the new
e-mail message, before you click the Send button at the bottom of the
E-mail task pane.
173
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

When you click the Send button, PhotoSuite opens your computer’s e-mail
messaging program with a new e-mail message in which you then fill in
the To and Subject lines and type in the message you want to accompany
your photos (whose filenames are either listed in the Attach line of the
new message or contents actually displayed at the very bottom of the new
message).
5. Click the Send button in your e-mail program to send the message.
After the e-mail program finishes sending your message with photos, its
program window closes.
6. Click the Done button at the bottom of the E-mail task pane to return
to the PhotoSuite Home Page.
Instead of sending your photos as standard e-mail attachments, you can have
PhotoSuite package them into a slideshow complete with music that is sent
as file attachment to a new e-mail message. When recipients receive the mes-
sage, they can then play this slideshow with the Windows Media Player on
their computers.
The procedure for putting your photos into a slideshow multimedia file and
then sending that file as an e-mail attachment is almost identical to that for
sending photos as regular file attachments. The big difference is that after
selecting the files to be sent (in the order they should appear in the slideshow),
then in the second E-mail task pane, you click the Package All Files into One
Slideshow option button before you click the Next button (note that you can
also click the E-mail Options button in this task pane and then modify the
options for the slideshow on the Slideshows tab in the E-mail Options dialog
box before clicking Next).
When you click the Next button after clicking the Package All Files into One
Slideshow option button, PhotoSuite displays the Add a Background Sound
dialog box. If you want to add music to play in the background as the
slideshow plays, click the Yes button in this dialog box and then select the
audio file to use in the Add a Background Sound dialog box. If you don’t want
to bother with music, just click the No button instead.
The next E-mail task pane that appears enables you to select a new screen
size for the slideshow (the default is the medium size, 320 x 240 pixels) and
then preview the slideshow before generating it and sending it:
1. Click the SlideShow.DMSM thumbnail in the work area and then click
the Preview button to play the slideshow in its own Preview window.
When you finish viewing the slideshow preview, click this window’s
Close button.
When you click the Preview button, PhotoSuite generates a quick-and-
dirty preview where the photo quality is not nearly as high as the fin-
ished product. If you want to take the time to have the program generate
174
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

a high-quality preview using the Size setting you’ve chosen, click the
Generate Preview button below the Size drop-down list box instead.
If you need to temporarily pause the playback of the slideshow preview,
click the Pause button at the bottom of the Preview window. If you want
to stop the slideshow entirely, click the Stop button instead. When
you’re finished playing the slideshow preview, click the window’s Close
button.
2. If you’re satisfied with the slideshow and ready to send it, click the
Next button. If you need to make some changes to the music selection
or the photos include, click the Back button and retrace your steps.
As soon as you click the Next button, PhotoSuite begins generating the
slideshow, showing you its progress in the Generate Slideshow dialog
box. When the program finishes generating the slideshow, a thumbnail
for the file called SlideShow.WMV replaces that of SlideShow.DMSM. The
WMV is the multimedia and video format used by the Windows Media
Player.
3. Click the Send button at the bottom of the E-mail to open a new e-mail
message in your e-mail program with the SlideShow.WMV file attached
to it.
Fill in the To and Subject lines and then type the text of the new e-mail
message.
4. Click the Send button in your e-mail program’s window after filling
the send To and subject information and typing the text for your new
message.
After your e-mail program finishes sending the new message with your
multimedia slideshow file attached, you can close the E-mail task pane.
5. Click the Done button to close the E-mail task pane and return to the
PhotoSuite Home Page.
When the recipients open the slideshow attachment in your e-mail message
on their computers, the Windows Media Player will automatically open and
play the slideshow for them.
Using the Online Photo Services
When you click the Online Photo Services link at the very bottom of the Print
& Share section of the PhotoSuite Home Page, PhotoSuite opens an Online
Photo Services task pane where you select the photos that you want profes-
sionally developed or to upload to the Web. After you finish selecting the
photos and you click the Next button, the Location of Photos to Share dialog
box appears. This dialog box lets you know that copies of all your selected
photos are ready to share, having been converted to the Internet-ready file
175
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

format (JPEG) and placed in the For Sharing folder whose path is displayed
both in this dialog box and in the Online Photo Services task pane.
After you click OK to close the Location of Photos to Share dialog box, you
need to click the Launch Browser button in the Online Photos Services task
pane to launch your Web browser and, if necessary, connect to the Internet.
After your browser connects to the Internet, the Roxio Digital Media Services
Web page similar to the one shown in Figure 6-17 appears.
Here, you must sign up for a new Roxio Photo Center, password-protected
account (which is free) by clicking the Sign Up Free button and then filling
out the new account form. After filling in your name, e-mail and physical
address and picking a new password, you submit the account form by click-
ing the Get Started button. After submitting your account form, you can then
start using the Online Photo Services (run by an outfit called Snapfish) by
clicking the Start Using Snapfish button.
After you sign up for your Snapfish account, you can get right onto uploading
photos for printing or viewing online by clicking the Log In button on the
Roxio Digital Media Services Web page. This brings you to a Log In page
where you enter your e-mail address and your password before you click the
Log In button. Click the Remember Me Every Time I Visit Snapfish check box,
if you want the site to automatically input your log in information each time
you visit the site so that all you have to do is click the Log In button.
Figure 6-17:

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

Uploading your photos to the Roxio Photo Center
Before you can have the Roxio Photo Center process prints from your digital
photos or can share them on the Internet, you have to upload them to into a
new album on the Roxio Media Center Web site. To do this, you need to log
into your Snapfish account after selecting your photos and clicking the
Launch Browser button in PhotoSuite’s Online Photo Services task pane.
Then click the Upload Photos link on your account page.
A new Web page opens with the icon for a new photo album given the title
Album followed by the current day and month (you can change this album
title by clicking the Album Title text box and replacing this automatic name.
Next, you need to click the Upload to This Album button.
An Upload Photos Web page now opens where you click the Select Photos
button to display an Open dialog box. In this dialog box, you need to select
the path of the For Sharing folder where PhotoSuite placed the photos that
you earlier selected. After you locate and open this For Sharing folder on
your hard disk, select the photos that you want to upload. If you want to
upload all the photos in the folder, press Ctrl+A to select them all before you
click the Open button.
Snapfish then displays thumbnails of all the photos that you select in your
For Sharing folder in the middle of the Upload Photos Web page. You can
remove a particular photo from this list by clicking the Remove button that
appears beneath it. If you need to rotate a photo, you can do so by clicking
the Rotate Clockwise button (the one on the left side with the curved arrow
rotating in a clockwise direction) or the Rotate Counterclockwise button (the
one on the right side with the curved arrow rotating in a counterclockwise
direction) that appear beneath the thumbnail on either side of the Remove
button.
When you have the photos you want to upload properly displayed on the
Upload Photos Web page, click the Upload button to have them copied onto
the Roxio Photo Center’s Web site. Once this uploading process is complete,
you can then order prints of the photos or share them.
Ordering prints from the Roxio Photo Center
You can use the Roxio’s online Photo Center to get high-quality prints of your
favorite digital photos, develop and digitize rolls of standard photo film, and
even upload and store your digital photos online for sharing on the Internet
(see “Sharing photos online” later in this chapter for details). As an added
bonus for you owners of the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 suite, your subscrip-
tion includes the printing 10 free 4x6 film-quality prints from digital photos
that you upload to the Center as well as the developing and digitizing of one
roll of photo film and all you pay is $1.99 for the return shipping and handling
of your prints and negatives.
177
Chapter 6: Managing Digital Photos

To get prints of the photos that you’ve uploaded to the Roxio Photo Center,
follow the procedure for uploading the photos outlined in the previous sec-
tion, and then click the Order Print button. You can then select the photos in
your album that you want prints of. Note that if an orange triangle appears
immediately above a photo’s check box, this means that quality of your digital
photo is not sufficient for the default 4x6 print size, and it’s not recommended
that you order professional prints (in other words, you need to upload high-
resolution digital photos to get your money’s worth when ordering prints
from the Roxio Photo Center).
After selecting the photos in your album to print, click Choose These Photos
to view the items you’ve ordered on Your Cart Web page. There, you can select
the number of prints you want made of each photo as well as designate the
print sizes before clicking the Check Out button. This takes you to the Billing
and Shipping Web page where you need to give your credit card information
and ship to address before placing your print order.
Sharing photos online
In addition to ordering high-quality prints of the digital photos that you upload
to the Roxio Photo Center, you can also invite friends and family to view the
photos that you’ve uploaded. To do this, you log onto the Roxio Photo Center,
upload the photos into a new album (see “Uploading your photos to the
Roxio Photo Center” earlier in this chapter) and then click the Share This
Album link (this appears beneath the Share button when you click it). The
Share an Album Web page opens where you can enter the e-mail addresses
for all the people who you want to invite to view your photos online (when
entering different e-mail addresses in the To list box, be sure to separate each
address by a comma or press Enter after typing in each address to put it on
its own line). You can then personalize the standard Subject line and stock
message before clicking the Share Album Now button.
As soon as you click the Share Album Now button, Snapfish sends e-mail
message to all the recipients you listed in the To list box inviting them to
get online and come and see your works of art. The e-mail message that each
person in the list receives contains a Snapfish window that shows the first
photo in your uploaded album and that contains a View My Photos button.
When recipients click this button, their Web browsers connect them to
Internet and take them directly to the Roxio Photo Center Web site. There,
after registering to use the Roxio Photo Center and then clicking the View the
Album button, they can view thumbnails of all the photos in your album. To
see any of the thumbnails full size, they simply click on the thumbnail, after
which, they can view all the rest of the photos in the album full size either by
clicking the Play link which automatically displays each photo in sequence
as a slideshow or one at a time by clicking the Next link.

R
oxio Easy Media Creator makes it easy for you to compile your favorite
tunes and burn them onto CDs for playing on standalone audio CD play-
ers (such as the one in your car and the Walkman-variety you listen to at the
gym) as well as on the CD-ROM drive in your computer. The audio CDs that you
burn can be composed of music tracks that you’ve downloaded and purchased
from online music stores such as Napster, recorded from analog recordings
(such as LPs and audio cassettes) with the Sound Editor (see Chapter 5), or
ones that you rip from audio CDs that you already own.
As you find out in this chapter, with the Easy Media Creator you can create
not only standard audio CDs but MP3 discs, Enhanced CDs, and Mixed-mode
CDs as well. MP3 discs are audio CDs whose tracks are saved in the MP3 com-
pressed file format. This file format enables you to fit many more tracks on
the CD than is possible on a standard CD-R disc (hundreds of tracks in MP3
versus about 20 maximum in the CD-R’s normal WAVE format, which aren’t
compressed at all). Besides being able to play the MP3 discs that you burn in
the Creator Classic application of Easy Media Creator on your computer’s
CD-ROM drive, however, you can only play MP3 discs on standalone players
that support the MP3 file format. Fortunately, many of today’s audio CD play-
ers, including the ever-popular Walkman-type, support the MP3 file format so
that this limitation may be no problem at all.

Enhanced and Mixed-mode CDs are CDs that mix computer data and audio
files together. Enhanced CDs are multi-session CDs with the first session con-
taining the audio tracks that can be played by any standard audio CD player
and CD-ROM drive and the second session containing the data files that can
be played only on the computer’s CD-ROM drive. Mixed-mode CDs are also
CDs that mix computer data and audio files. However, unlike the Enhanced
CD which separates music tracks from data files in separate sessions, the
Mixed-mode CD contains only one session with both the data and music (the
data is laid down in the first track of the CD and all the audio tracks follow).
This means that a Mixed-mode CD can only be played by your computer’s
CD-ROM drive (regular audio CD players like the one in your car can’t play
this kind of CD at all).
After exploring how to create all these types of audio CDs, this chapter ends
with information on how to make copies of both the CDs that you burn with
Easy Media Creator with the Roxio Disc Copier application.
Creating an Audio CD Project
Creator Classic is the Easy Media Creator application that you use for compil-
ing and burning all your audio CDs. To launch Creator Classic from the Easy
Media Creator Home window, click the Create New Audio CD link in the Music
column or the Creator Classic link in the Applications area. If the Easy Media
Creator Home window is not already open, you can launch Creator Classic by
clicking the Start button on the Windows taskbar, highlighting All Programs
on the Start submenu, Roxio on the All Programs submenu, and clicking
Creator Classic on the Roxio submenu.
If you launched Creator Classic by clicking the Create New Audio CD link on
the Easy Media Creator Home, the Creator Classic window with a new unti-
tled Audio Project shown in Figure 7-1 appears. If, however, you started the
application by clicking the Creator Classic link in the Easy Media Creator
Home or from the Windows Start menu, you need to click the Audio CD link
listed in the Common Tasks area of the Tasks pane.

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

Adding audio tracks to your project
After starting a new Audio CD project, you simply need to fill in your name for
the new disc in the Disc Title text box and the name of the artist(s) involved in
the Artist Name text box if you want this information to be included before
you add the music tracks to the project.
When adding your tracks to the Audio CD project, you follow these simple
steps:
1. Open the folder or disc on your computer system with the Windows
Explorer in the Select Source pane that contains the tracks you want
to add.
If you’ve already copied the tracks you want to add to your computer’s
hard disk, these tracks are probably located in the My Music folder on
your computer. If you’re copying tracks from an audio CD in your com-
puter’s CD-ROM drive, select that drive’s letter.

2. Select the names of the track(s) you want to add.
If you select your computer’s CD-ROM drive, Creator Classic attempts to
obtain the track names and other album information of the CD it contains
from the online Gracenote CD database. When this information is found,
the album name appears in the Disc Title text box, the artist name in the
Artist Name text box, and the names of the individual tracks appear in
the list box below. 
In front of each track name you find a check box containing a checkmark
indicating that the track is now selected for adding to the project. If you
don’t want to add a particular track in the list added to the audio CD
project, click its check box to remove this checkmark before proceeding
to Step 3.
If you’re adding tracks from a folder such as the My Music folder, you
can select multiple files by Ctrl+clicking their names.
3. Drag the selected tracks down to the Audio CD Project window or
click the Add the Selected Files Above to Project button.
Creator Classic adds the names of all the selected tracks to the Audio CD
Project pane. After adding your tracks to the project, their names appear
in the Audio CD Project pane along with the number of tracks and their
total estimated playing time and the estimated amount of total free play-
ing time still left on the disc appear on the status bar at the bottom
Project pane. 
If you find that you’ve added a track that you don’t really want to include
on the final CD, click the track and then press the Delete key or click the
Remove from Project button on the Audio CD Project pane’s toolbar and
then click the Yes button in the Warning dialog box that appears.
If you try to add a track that you’ve downloaded to your computer’s hard disk
for playback but for which you don’t have permission to copy by burning to 
a CD or MP3 disc, the Error alert dialog box appears. If this Error dialog box
appears for a track that you’ve downloaded from an online music store without
actually purchasing, you can rectify this situation by going back to the store and
buying the track. When you purchase a music track from most online music
centers such as Napster, you obtain both the play and burn rights to the song
(although the burn rights may not enable you to make unlimited copies — you
need to check this with the particular store).
So too, if you try to add an audio file to the project that’s recorded in a file
format not supported by the Easy Media Creator (that is, any format besides
MP3, OGG, WAV, or WMA), Creator Classic displays a Warning Unsupported
Files alert dialog box that tells you that the file you’re trying to add carries an
182
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

unrecognized file extension and that it will not be added to your project. This
is what would happen, for example, if you tried to add a track that you’d pur-
chased from Apple’s online iTunes Music Store that uses Apple’s AAC audio
file format with the .M4P filename extension that’s not supported by the
Roxio Easy Media Creator software.
Accessing the online music database
If the disc information including the album title, artist’s name, and track titles
for a particular audio CD doesn’t show up in the Select Source pane when you
click the disc’s CD or DVD drive in the Window Explorer, you can try to have
this information located and downloaded from the online Gracenote CDDB
(CD Database). The Gracenote CDDB is the world’s largest online database of
music information (listing about two and a half million CDs with just a little
over 33 million songs!). 
To get the vital statistics on the album you have in your computer’s CD or
DVD drive, click the Get Audio CD Info from the Gracenote CDDB Online Music
Database button on the Select Source toolbar or choose Tools➪Get Audio CD
Info from CDDB on the Creator Classic menu bar. Creator Classic then con-
nects you to the Internet and the Gracenote CDDB to look for the CD’s ISRC
(International Standard Code) number in this humongous database. When it
finds a match to the album’s IRSC number in the Gracenote CDDB, it then
downloads the information to the Select Source pane in the Creator Classic
window.
Listening to tracks before you add them
You can listen to tracks with Creator Classic before you add them to the
audio CD project you’re building. To do this, click the track in the Select
Source pane to select and then press the Enter key. As soon as you press the
Enter key, Creator Classic opens the Preview pane shown in Figure 7-2 on the
left side of the Creator Classic window and starts playing the selected track.
As you can see in this figure, the Preview pane contains its own playback con-
trols with buttons modeled on those on a standard CD and DVD remote con-
trol. Beneath this controller, you find a slider that you can drag to manually
advance or rewind the playback, along with a volume-control slider that you
can drag to increase or reduce the volume.

Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs and MP3 Discs

Rearranging tracks
When you add individual tracks from various sources that you copied on
your computer’s hard disk to your Audio CD Project (as opposed to a block
of audio tracks from a single source such as a CD in your CD or DVD drive),
Creator Classic automatically lists these tracks alphabetically by track title in
the Project pane. You will not, however, always want to burn your audio CD
with its tracks in this type of alphabetical order. More often than not, you’ll
end up arranging the tracks in the order in which you think you’d most prefer
to listen to them (regardless of what havoc that inflicts upon the alphabetical
track name order).
To modify the track order prior to burning the final audio CD disc, you need to
drag the tracks in the Audio CD Project to their desired positions. To do this,
click the track that you want to move to select it and then drag up or down to
reposition it. As you drag, a dashed line appears right above the mouse pointer
indicating where the track you’re moving will be inserted if you release mouse
button. Once you’ve positioned this dashed line in between the tracks in the
Project pane where you want it to now appear, release the mouse button to

184
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

move the selected track to that new position in the list. As soon as you release
the mouse button, Creator Classic renumbers all the tracks to suit the new
track order. 
Although it is a little tedious to have to reposition each track in this manner,
it is the only method that Creator Classic supports for rearranging the tracks
you add so that they don’t appear in alphabetical order by track name on the
new CD.
Renaming tracks
Creator Classic enables you to rename the tracks that you add to your audio
CD project. You might need to do this when Gracenote can’t return the cor-
rect track name or when you’re dealing with tracks that aren’t registered with
this database (as in the case of original music).
To rename one of the tracks, click its name in the Audio CD Project pane and
press F2 (you can also do this by right-clicking the track name and then click-
ing the Rename item on the track’s shortcut menu). Creator Classic then
selects the track name within a text box waiting for you to make your changes
to the name. To replace the name entirely, just start typing the new track name. 
To edit the track name by inserting text, you can just click the Insertion point
at the place in the track name where you need to start inserting characters.
To delete just some of the characters in the name, drag through them with
the arrowhead mouse pointer to select them and then press the Delete key.
When you finish editing or replacing the track name, press the Enter key or
click the mouse anywhere outside of the of the track name’s text box.
Merging different tracks into one
Creator Classic makes it possible to merge the audio from different tracks that
you’ve added to the Audio CD Project together so that they play as one contin-
uous song track on the resulting CD that you burn. To merge song tracks, you
simply Ctrl+click the tracks (if they’re not sequential) in the Audio CD Project
list or Shift+Click them (if they’re sequentially listed in a block) and then
choose Track➪Merge Tracks on the Creator Classic menu bar or right-click
the track selection and click Merge Tracks on its shortcut menu.
Creator Classic then joins the selected track together into one long track.
This is indicated in the Project pane by the joining of the track titles so that
the merged track now has a hyphenated track name (consisting of all the
individual track names in the order in which you selected them for merging)
and the presence of an Expand/Collapse button in front of the merged track.
When you click the Expand button indicated by the plus sign (+), Creator
185
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs and MP3 Discs

Classic expands to list the names of all the individual tracks of which it’s 
now composed in outline form (see Figure 7-3). When you click the Collapse
button (–) which replaces the Expand button, Creator Classic collapses the
outline so that only the merged song track with its hyphenated track name is
shown in the Audio CD Project pane.
Figure 7-3 illustrates the merging of two tracks in the track list of the Audio CD
Project pane. For this particular example, I merged the first two tracks of
Douglas Spotted Eagle’s wonderful album, Closer to Far Away. I did this because
the first track, “Dii’saad’beh (With These Words)” is actually a short introduc-
tion that flows quite naturally into the second song, “Closer to Far Away,” 
the track that gives the album its name. When played as the merged track
“Dii’saad’beh (With These Words)/ Closer to Far Away,” there is no longer any
gap between the end of the first song and the beginning of the second so that it
plays one song (an edit which I think the producers of this album might well
have made themselves in the studio when mixing this album).
In Figure 7-3, I’ve expanded the merged track by clicking its Expand button
(+) so that the track names, track lengths, and sources of the two individual
song tracks are now displayed in the track list in the Audio CD Project pane. 
After combining tracks into one merged track, you should listen to the merged
track (to make sure you like the sound of it played back as one song). To do
this, click the merged track name in the Audio CD Project pane and then press
the Enter key. If you decide that it wasn’t the greatest idea in the world to
merge those particular individual tracks, you can split the merged track back

into its individual tracks by choosing Track➪Split Tracks on the Creator
Classic menu bar or by right-clicking the merged track and then clicking Split
Tracks on its short cut menu. Creator Classic immediately splits the merged
track into its individual components, which are once again listed as individual
tracks (with their original track names) in the Audio CD Project pane.
Adding audio transitions between tracks
You can control the types of transitions that occur between the song tracks
in the list of tracks added to the Audio CD Project pane. When adding audio
transitions between tracks, you can add a gap between the tracks that places
so many seconds of silence between them or you can add a fade-in transition
at the beginning of a track (so that the volume level gradually increases from
silence to normal) and a fade-out transition at the end of the track (so that
the volume level gradually decreases from normal to silence) of a particular
duration of so many seconds.
To add an audio transition to a track that you’ve added to the Audio CD
Project pane, follow these steps:
1. Click the track to which you want to add some sort of audio transition
in the Audio CD Project pane.
Now you’re ready to open the Audio Transitions dialog box where you
can select an audio transition for the start and end of the selected track.
2. Click the Edit Track Transitions button on the Project pane’s toolbar or
choose Track➪Transition Effects on the Creator Classic menu bar.
Creator Classic opens the Audio Transitions dialog box similar to the 
one shown in Figure 7-4. This dialog box shows a graphic display of the
currently selected track beneath the Current Track drop-down list box.
Below this graphic display of the track, you find two pairs of Play and Stop
buttons, the first pair on the left side that you can use to start and stop
playing the Start Transition you define and the other on the right that you
can use to start and stop playing any End Transition that you define.
Beneath the Play and Stop buttons, you find the controls for defining a
Start Transition and a Stop Transition for the current track. When defin-
ing the Start Transition, you can select between a Fade-out at the end of
the previous track and a Fade-in to the current track and set the number
of seconds for the fade-out and fade-in effects, or you can choose between
a Gap of silence and a Crossfade of so many seconds duration between
the end of the previous track and the start of the current track.
When defining the End Transition, you can select between a Fade-out at
the end of the current track and a Fade-in to the next track and set the
number of seconds for the fade-in and fade out effects, or you can choose
between a Gap of silence and a Crossfade of so many seconds duration
between the end of the current track and the start of the next track.
187
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs and MP3 Discs

3. Select the desired Start Transition and/or End Transition effects and
then test them with the appropriate pair of Play and Stop buttons.
Creator Classic depicts the particular fade-out, fade-in, gap, or cross-
fade effects that you select in the graphic track display in the Audio
Transitions dialog box. Fade-out effects appear as gray curves at the 
end of the track that extend from top to bottom of the track’s thickness.
Fade-in effects appear as gray curves at the beginning of the track that
extend from the bottom to the top of the track’s thickness. Gaps appear
as gray spaces between the two tracks, and cross-fade effects appear as
spaces in the color of the current track with tiny, vertical lines in the
color of the preceding or following track.
Note that you can click the Apply to All button at the bottom of the
Audio Transitions dialog box to apply the Start Transition and/or the
End Transition you define to all the tracks listed in the Audio CD Project
pane. Likewise, you can click the Clear All button to remove all start and
end transitions between these tracks.
Be sure that you use the Start Transition Play and Stop buttons or the
End Transition Play and Stop buttons to listen to the audio transitions to
ensure that they are what you want on the CD you burn before go on to
Step 4.
4. Click the OK button to apply your transitions to the current track and
close the Audio Transitions dialog box.
After you define start and end transitions for a track in the Audio Transitions
dialog box, Creator Classic indicates their presence in the track listing in the
Audio CD Project pane by representing the transition with back-to-back gray
triangles (that together form a ramp with a gap between the triangles that
Evel Knievel might want to jump) in the Transitions column of the track list.

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

To edit or remove an audio transition for a particular track in this listing in 
the Audio CD Project pane, you simply click the transition representation (the
back-to-back triangles) for the track in question to open the Audio Transitions
displaying its Start Transition and End Transition settings. To remove a particu-
lar transition, you select the No Transition setting in the appropriate Fade-in or
Fade-out drop-down list box or reduce duration of the Gap or Crossfade effect
to 0 in its particular Sec text box before you click the OK button.              
Changing the Project and Track Settings
Prior to burning the tracks that you’ve added to the Audio CD Project pane,
you can check and, if necessary, change the properties for the CD project. To
do this, you open the Project Properties dialog box shown in Figure 7-6 by
clicking the View and Edit Your Project Settings button on the Audio CD
Project pane’s toolbar, pressing Ctrl+R, or choosing File➪Project Settings on
the Creator Classic menu bar. A Project Properties dialog box appears.
The Project Properties dialog box contains two tabs, Audio and CD Text. The
Audio lists the number of tracks and the total playing time. It also contains a
UPC text box where you can enter the CD’s 12-digit Universal Product Code if
you’ve obtained one for your CD or are copying a CD and happen to know it.
Beneath the UPC text box, you find the Normalize Audio (Applied at Time of
Burn) check box. Click this check box when you’ve added audio tracks from
different sources and want to have Creator Classic normalize their volume at
the time that the tracks are burned onto the CD. 
Beneath the Normalize Audio (Applied at Time of Burn) check box, you find
the Automatically Save Artist/Title/Track Names After Recording check box
that is automatically checked. When this box is checked, Creator Classic
saves the artist, album name, and track names on your hard disk after burn-
ing the CD so that the next time you put the disc into your computer’s CD or
DVD drive to play it, these vital statistics will be available to the program you
use to play the disc (such as the Windows Media Player or iTunes).
The CD Text tab of the Project Properties dialog box contains a list of different
languages in which you can burn the CD Text at the beginning of the audio 
disc that contains the artist, title, and track names (many playback devices
such as Walkman portable CD players can read this CD Text and show this
information on the device’s display screen). By default, only the English check
box is selected, so this information is stored only in English. If you want to
store this information in other languages (German, French, Spanish, Italian, or
Dutch), click that language’s check box on the CD Text tab before clicking the
OK button to close the Project Properties dialog box.
189
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs and MP3 Discs

In addition to getting information about the entire audio project you’re creat-
ing, you can also get specific information on any track that you add to the
Project pane. Simply right-click the track whose information you want dis-
played in the Audio CD Project pane and then click Properties at the bottom
of the track’s shortcut menu. When you do this, Creator Classic opens an
Audio Track Properties dialog box. 
The Audio Track Properties dialog box shows the selected track’s track
number and playing time along with the album’s title, the artist’s name, and
the source on your computer for that track. In addition, beneath this informa-
tion, you find an ISRC (International Standard Recording Code) text box where
you can enter the 12-digit ISRC code for the track if you know it before you
click the OK button to close the Audio Track Properties dialog box.
A music track’s ISRC number serves as the recording’s international identifier
for the purposes of rights management. In other words, an ISRC number indi-
cates who’s entitled to the royalty payments for the distribution of that
recording. If you’re making a CD of your own music for distribution to various
record companies and radio stations, you will definitely want to obtain ISRC
numbers from an approved ISRC Agency and encode the tracks of the CD
you’re burning with Creator Classic for any type of distribution with those
numbers.
Burning the CD
Once you’ve added all the tracks you want to your audio CD project and made
any necessary adjustments to the tracks, including merging, audio transitions,
track ISRC information, project settings, and the like, you’re ready to burn the
CD disc. Prior to starting the burn process, you may want to save your Audio
CD Project so that you can use it again to burn future CDs. To save the project,
press Ctrl+S or choose File➪Save Project on the Creator Classic menu bar; then
select the appropriate folder and project name (Creator Classic automatically
assigns .RCL file extension to all project files) in the Save As dialog box before
you click the Save button.
To burn the audio project to CD, you then click the Burn button on the far right
side of the Audio CD Project pane’s toolbar or choose File➪Burn on the Creator
Classic menu bar. Creator Classic then opens the Roxio Creator Classic - Burn
Progress dialog box. To expand the dialog box so that this dialog box displays
all of your options for burning the CD, you need to click the >>Details button in
the lower-left corner of the dialog box.
Figure 7-5 shows the expanded version of the Burn Progress dialog box after
clicking this button. In addition to the Project Summary and Device(s)
Summary information, you also have access to the options offered in the
Destinations, Record Methods, and Record Options areas as well.
190
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

The options that you can modify in these areas of the Burn Progress dialog
box include:
 Write Speed drop-down list box may enable you to select another write
speed (this depends upon what type of CD burner your computer is
equipped with)
 Number of Copies text box to indicate the number of CD discs you want
to burn
 Disc Image File option button to save a complete copy of the audio CD
project on your hard disk which can then be burned to a CD disc at later
time using Creator Classic
 Read Only Disc (Cannot Add Data at a Later Time) check box, which
when selected prevents you from adding any more data files to this disc
even when there’s sufficient free space and you’re using rewritable
media (you must use this option if you want to be able to play your CD
in standalone audio CD players such as the one in your car or on a
portable Walkman-type player)
 Record Options drop-down to choose between Write Only to begin record-
ing without doing any testing, Test Only to perform the recording test to
determine whether or not files in the project can be successfully written to
the disc, and Test and Write to perform the recording test and then, if the
disc passes automatically, continue and burn the files to the disc
 Buffer Underun Prevention check box to enable or disable buffer pre-
vention for your CD or DVD drive that creates a buffer in the memory to
ensure that the data is recorded to the disc without any interruptions
(note that check box will not be available when using an older CD
recordable drive)

Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs and MP3 Discs

 Do Not Eject Discs After Recording check box to ensure or prevent
Creator Classic from automatically ejecting each CD or DVD disc after it
finishes recording all its data files
After making changes to any of these options in the Burn Progress dialog box,
click the Burn button to begin recording burning your tracks. The Burn
Progress dialog box then shows its progress in caching each of the tracks to
your computer’s hard disk (if the tracks you’re burning are being taken from
an existing CD and have not been copied onto your computer’s hard disk). 
After Creator Classic finishes caching the tracks from the existing CD, it then
ejects that CD from your computer’s CD-ROM drive and then displays an Insert
Media dialog box that prompts you to insert a blank disc in its place. After you
replace it with a blank disc and click the Continue Recording button in the
Insert Media dialog box, the information in the Burn Progress dialog box is then
updated to Disc 1 of 1, which shows you the progress of the data recording both
in terms of the tracks and overall disc-recording progress. This updated Burn
Progress dialog box contains a Start Label Creator button that you can click to
launch the Label Creator application for creating a custom label for your new
audio CD after its recording is completed (see Chapter 9 for details). 
If you don’t want to make a label for your new audio CD after all the tracks
are burned onto it and Creator Classic ejects the disc, simply click the Close
button to close the Roxio Creator Classic - Burn Progress dialog box and
return to the Creator Classic window.
Creating an MP3 Disc Project
If you have a standalone or portable CD or DVD player capable of playing
MP3 discs, instead of using Creator Classic to start an audio CD Project for
burning standard audio CDs, you can start an MP3 disc project and burn an
MP3 audio disc. The benefit of creating an MP3 audio disc instead of a stan-
dard CD is clear: because MP3 discs are composed only of audio files saved
in the MPEG3 compressed file format, you can fit many, many more song
tracks on your average MP3 disc than you ever can on a standard audio CD
composed of tracks saved in the uncompressed WAVE file formats.
To start a new MP3 Disc Project from the Easy Media Creator Home window,
click the Create New MP3 Disc link in the Music column of the Tasks area. To
start a new MP3 Disc Project in Creator Classic, click the MP3 Disc link in the
Common Projects area of the Tasks pane. Creator Classic then starts a new
untitled MP3 Disc Project that contains a default playlist called (appropriately
enough) PLAYLIST (see Figure 7-6).
192
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

After starting a new MP3 Disc Project, you can edit the volume name of the new
disc and rename the default playlist. To change the volume name of the disc,
click the Disc Name text box; then edit the default numeric name that Creator
Classic assigns the disc and when finished, click somewhere outside of this text
box. To rename the playlist, click PLAYLIST in the Folder Navigation Tree in the
MP3 Disc Project pane to open the Playlist Editor dialog box and then replace
PLAYLIST in the Playlist File Name text box before you click the OK button.
Adding MP3 files to a new MP3 Disc Project is much the same process as adding
tracks to an Audio CD Project (simply select the files in the Select Source pane
with Windows Explorer and then drag them into the MP3 Disc Project pane or
click the Add Selected Files Above to Project button on the MP3 Disc Project
pane’s toolbar). The big difference is that instead of just adding individual songs
as you do with an Audio CD Project, you can add entire folders of MP3 files to
the Playlist (simply by dragging the folder from the Select Source pane down to
MP3 Disc Project pane below the Playlist icon).

Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs and MP3 Discs

MP3 Disc Projects balk at any attempt to add anything but MP3 files. If you
select an audio file saved in any other file format (WAVE, WMA, or OGG) and
try to add it to the MP3 Disc Project pane, Creator Classic displays a Warning:
Unsupported Files alert dialog box indicating that one or more files being
added has an unrecognized file extension (that is, other than .MP3) and that
these files will not be added to your MP3 disc project. If the audio file is saved
as a WAVE file on an audio CD that you own, you can rip its track as MP3 files
(see the sidebar that follows) and then add it to the MP3 Disc Project. If the
audio file you want to add is saved on your hard disk and you have the burn
rights to the track, you can open it in Sound Editor and then use its File➪Save
As command to save it as an MP3 file that you can add to your MP3 Disc
Project (see Chapter 5 for details).
Note that when adding individual MP3 files to the MP3 Disc Project pane, you
can create a new folder in which to add them. To create a new folder in the
MP3 Disc Project pane, right-click the disc icon in the Navigation Tree and
then click New Folder on its shortcut menu. Creator Classic then adds a new
folder named (what else?) New Folder (which you can rename by clicking and
then pressing F2 or right-clicking and then clicking Rename on the folder’s
shortcut menu). You can then add MP3 files to the new folder by clicking its
icon in the Navigation Tree before you select and add individual MP3 files or
groups of MP3 files in the Select Source pane.
Keep in mind that many simple MP3 disc players can’t play tracks that you put
into folders. When in doubt, keep all the tracks in the MP3 project in the root
directory under PLAYLIST and don’t add them to folders beneath this root level.
As you add MP3 files to your MP3 disc project, Creator Classic keeps track of
them in the Playlist. To open the playlist to review or change the order of the
songs in the playlist, click (no need to right-click) the playlist icon (named
PLAYLIST until you rename it) in the Navigation Tree. Creator Classic then
opens the Playlist Editor dialog box for the MP3 disc project similar to the
one shown in Figure 7-7.
Figure 7-7:

194
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

You can use the controls in the Playlist Editor to arrange the order in which
the MP3 normally plays in the final MP3 disc you burn. If you want a truly
random order for the songs, simply click the Random button. If you want to
manually determine where a particular song appears in the playlist, you can
either drag its filename up or down the list or click the song filename and
then click the Promote button (the one with triangle pointing upward) or
Demote button (the one with the triangle pointing downward) to move the
song up or down to the desired position.
After adding all the MP3 files that you want (or can fit) onto a new disc and
arranging them in the order in which you want them to normally play, you’re
ready to burn the CD. To do this, you click the Burn button on the right side
of the MP3 Disc Project pane’s toolbar or choose File➪Burn Project on the
Creator Classic menu bar (see “Burning the CD” earlier in this chapter for
details on the process of burning a new CD disc).
Creating an Enhanced CD
An Enhanced CD is a type of multi-session CD that combines data and audio
together. The first session on the CD contains audio tracks (such as you add
to a standard Audio CD Project — see “Creating an Audio CD Project” earlier
in this chapter for details). The second session contains the data file such as
you might add to a standard Data Disc Project in Creator Classic — see
Chapter 3 for details).
When you play an Enhanced CD disc in a standalone CD player (such as the
one in your car or a Walkman-type portable unit), the player plays the music
session so that you can listen to its music tracks as you would any other
195
Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs and MP3 Discs
Ripping MP3 files from audio CDs 
with Creator Classic
Remember that you can use Creator Classic to
rip tracks from the audio CDs that you own so
that you can then, in turn, add them to an MP3
Disc Project that you create with the program.
To rip MP3 from an audio CD, insert the CD into
your computer’s CD or DVD drive; then select
that drive’s letter in the Creator Classic’s Select
Source pane with the Windows Explorer and
click the Copy Tracks from Audio CD button to
open the Copy Tracks from Audio CD - Options
dialog box. You can then designate the folder
into which to copy the ripped MP3 tracks and
adjust the compression slider for better quality
audio or smaller MP3 files before clicking the
Start button to start ripping the tracks. After
Creator Classic finishes ripping the MP3 files,
you can then add them to your MP3 Disc Project
for burning onto a new MP3 disc.

audio CD. When, however, you play an Enhanced CD disc in your computer’s
CD-ROM or DVD drive, you cannot only play its music tracks with a software
program such as the Windows Media Player, but you also have access to its
data portion with the appropriate software program.
Enhanced CDs are a perfect solution when you’ve created an MTV-type music
video (see Chapter 10 for details) that you want to package along with a
bunch of music tracks. You can then add the music tracks to the first audio
session and the music video file to the second data session of the Enhanced
CD Project and then burn them together on a CD disc for distribution to
friends, family, and, yes, that MTV producer who’s about to discover you.
To start a new Enhanced CD Project, launch Creator Classic; then click the
Advanced Projects Expand button (the one with two arrowheads pointing
downward) in the Tasks pane on the left side of the Creator Classic window
to display its three options and finally, click the Enhanced CD link at the top
of the Advanced Projects area.
Creator Classic opens a new untitled Enhanced CD Project as shown in Figure
7-8. As you can see in this figure, in the Enhanced CD Project pane, two icons,
an Audio Project and Data Disc icon (indicated by the numeric volume name)
appear immediately below the Enhanced CD icon in the Navigation Tree. You
add your audio tracks to the Audio Project portion of this tree (see “Adding
audio tracks to your project” earlier in this chapter) and you then add your
folders and data files to the Data Disc portion of the tree below (see Chapter 3).
Figure 7-8:

196
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects

After you finish adding your music tracks and data files to your Enhanced CD
Project, you can save the project with the File➪Save command and then burn
the CD by clicking the Burn button on the Enhanced CD Project pane’s tool-
bar or by choosing File➪Burn on the Creator Classic menu bar (see “Burning
the CD” earlier in this chapter for details on the burn process).
Creating a Mixed-CD
Like an Enhanced CD, a Mixed-mode CD also combines data files and music
tracks on the same CD disc. Unlike the Enhanced CD, however, the Mixed-mode
CD records both the computer data and music tracks in a single session and
therefore can only be played back in your computer’s CD or DVD drive using
the appropriate software such as the Windows Media Player. Mixed-mode CDs
are typically used to create multi-media projects for learning or entertainment
(game) purposes that you can enjoy exclusively on the computer.
To start a new Mixed-Mode CD Project, launch Creator Classic; then click the
Advanced Projects Expand button (the one with two arrowheads pointing
downward) in the Tasks pane on the left side of the Creator Classic window
to display its three options, and finally click the Mixed-Mode CD link in the
middle of the Advanced Projects area.
Creator Classic opens a new untitled Mixed-Mode CD Project as shown in Figure
7-9. As you can see in this figure, in the Mixed-Mode CD Project pane two icons,
a Data Disc icon (indicated by the numeric volume name) and an Audio Project
icon appear immediately below the Mixed-Mode CD icon in the Navigation Tree.
You add your folders and data files to the Data Disc portion of the tree (see
Chapter 3) and then add your audio tracks to the Audio Project portion below
(see “Adding audio tracks to your project” earlier in this chapter).
After you finish adding your data files and your music tracks to your Mixed-
Mode CD Project, you can save the project with the File➪Save command and
then burn the CD by clicking the Burn button on the Mixed-Mode CD Project
pane’s toolbar or by choosing File➪Burn on the Creator Classic menu bar
(see “Burning the CD” earlier in this chapter for details on the burn process).

Chapter 7: Burning Audio CDs and MP3 Discs

Copying an Audio CD
Although CD discs are long lived, they are by no means indestructible (see
the end of Chapter 2 for information on the proper care and feeding of your
CD and DVD discs). For that reason, you will be well-served to use the Roxio
Disc Copier to make copies of the audio CDs and MP3 discs that you burn
with Creator Classic. 
To launch the Roxio Disc Copier application from the Easy Media Creator
Home, click the Copy Audio CD link at the very top of the Music column of
the upper Tasks area. You can also launch this application by clicking the
Disc Copier link at the very top of the Applications column in the Home
window. If you don’t have the Easy Media Creator Home window open, you
can launch this program by clicking the Start button on the Windows taskbar,
highlighting All Programs on the Start menu and then Roxio on the All
Programs submenu before you click Disc Copier on the Roxio submenu.
When you launch the Disc Copier application, the Roxio Disc Copier alert
dialog box appears, warning you that unless you own the copyright to the
material on the CD or have explicit permission to copy the disc from the
copyright owner, you’re in danger of violating copyright law and are subject
to paying damages. You can go ahead and click the OK button to dismiss this
alert box (on the presumption that you have said permission to burn the
songs onto the original CD or MP3 disc). After you get rid of this annoying
alert dialog box, the Roxio Disc copier window shown in Figure 7-10 appears.

With the audio CD or MP3 disc that you want to copy in your CD or DVD
drive (and a new blank disc on which to make the copy at hand), you can
then go ahead and click the Copy button on the right side of the Roxio Disc
Copier window to start the copy process. (For complete details on using the
Roxio Disc Copier, refer to the final section in Chapter 3.)

Creating Disc Labels 
and Case Inserts
In This Chapter
 The many ways of launching the Label Creator tool
 Choosing the proper disc template and disc project theme
 Automating the process of getting album and disc information for the new label
 Editing the image, graphic, and text objects in your label project
 Printing disc labels and case inserts
 Applying adhesive labels properly so you don’t ruin your discs
T
he Label Creator tool in the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 Suite makes it a
snap to create professional-looking disc labels, covers, booklet inserts
and jewel case inserts for the audio CDs, MP3 discs, and DVD discs that you
burn with various Easy Media Creator programs including Drag-to-Disc, Disc
Copier, Creator Classic, and DVD Creator. 
As you find out in this chapter, Label Creator makes the job of creating disc
labels so easy through the combination of its standard templates and Smart
Objects and Auto-Fill features that automate the filling in of vital information
on the contents of your disc. This contents information can come either
directly from the Gracenote CDDB in the case of audio CDs or from the
Creator Classic and DVD Builder projects (see Chapters 3, 8, and 12) which
you use in burning the discs in the case of both audio and DVD discs.
This chapter also covers how Label Creator can make short work of design-
ing CD and DVD case covers, booklet inserts, and jewel case inserts. When
designing these types of case inserts, you can make use the Smart Objects
and Auto-Fill features you use to fill in disc label content as well as apply the
same or new graphic themes. Finally, you find out how to print the labels and
case inserts you create with Label Creator and how to properly apply the
labels you print to the CD and DVD discs you burn.

Getting Familiar with the 
Label Creator Window
You can launch the Label Creator tool from Roxio Easy Media Creator Home
window by clicking the Label Creator link in the Tools column. If the Home
window is not open, launch the program from the Windows taskbar by click-
ing the Start button, then highlighting All Programs on the Start menu and
Roxio on the All Programs submenu before clicking Label Creator on the
Roxio submenu.
Figure 8-1 shows the Roxio Label Creator window that then opens. As you can
see in this figure, this window contains two major panes: 
 Tasks pane on the left side composed of the Edit Layout, Add Object,
Tools, and Properties palettes, each containing the various tools you
need in designing a new disc label and case inserts 
 Layout pane on the right side that displays a preview of the disc label or
case insert that you’re currently designing
Figure 8-1:

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

The Edit Layout palette
As you can see in Figure 8-1, the Tasks pane of the Label Creator window con-
tains a whole bunch of design tools arranged into four palettes. The first one
at the top of the Tasks pane is the Edit Layout palette consisting of the follow-
ing links that you can click to perform common tasks for designing your disc
labels and case inserts:
 Show/Hide Smart Objects link to display and hide the Show/Hide Smart
Objects dialog box where you can select which type of information (such
as Title, Track List, Disc Type, and so on) about the audio or data disc to
include on the disc label on case inserts you’re designing for the disc in
Label Creator
 Auto-Fill from Disc link to add the name of the album, artist, and track
list for the CD that you’re burning or you have inserted into your com-
puter’s CD-ROM or DVD drive
 Apply Template/Theme link to open the Apply Template/Theme dialog
box where you can select the type of layout template to use for the type
of disc label you’re creating (Audio, Backup, Game, MP3, Photos, Videos,
and so on) and/or a graphic theme to apply to the design of both the
label and the case inserts you’re creating in Label Creator
 Edit Background link to open the Edit Smart Objects dialog box where
you can select an image or a color to use for the background of the label
or case insert you’re currently designing in Label Creator
 Scan Image link to open a Scan dialog box where you can use your scan-
ner to scan in a new image for use in the disc label or case inserts you’re
designing in Label Creator (if you get an error message when you click
the Scan Image link, choose File➪Select Device on the Label Creator
menu bar and make sure that your scanner is selected in the Select
Source dialog box before you click this link again)
The Add Object palette
The Add Object palette (shown in Figure 8-2) contains the five following tools
that you can use when you need to add images to or draw specific shapes 
in the disc labels or case inserts that you’re creating in Label Creator. Label
Creator recognizes three different types of objects that you can add to and
manipulate in the labels and case inserts you’re designing:
 Image objects which are graphics or photo images stored in separate
files that you can bring into the label project
 Graphic objects which are rectangular or oval shapes or straight lines
that you can size and place in the label project
203
Chapter 8: Creating Disc Labels and Case Inserts

 Text objects which are blocks of text inside text boxes that you can size
and position on the label project
The Add Object palette contains the following buttons for adding image,
graphic, or text objects to your label project:
 Add an Image to the Current Layout button to open the Add dialog box
where you can select the file containing the graphic or photo image you
want to add as an image object to the disc label or case insert you’re
designing in Label Creator
 Add Rectangle Object button to add a new rectangular graphic object to
the disc label or case insert you’re designing in Label Creator
 Add Circle Object button to add a new circular graphic object to the
disc label or case insert you’re designing in Label Creator
 Add Line Object button to add a straight line as a new graphic object to
the disc label or case insert you’re designing in Label Creator
 Add Text Object button to add a text object to the disc label or case
insert you’re designing in Label Creator where you can enter text that
you want to appear on the label or insert
Add rectangular object
Add image to current layout

204
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

The Tools palette
The Tools palette contains a whole cartload of useful stacking and alignment
tools (see Figure 8-3) that you can use to control which image, graphic, or
text objects are front and which are behind the others as well as how
selected objects are aligned on the disc label or case insert layout you’re
editing. The buttons on the Tools palette include:
 Bring Object to Front button to bring the object you select in front all of
the other objects that cover it in some way
 Send Object to Back button to place the object you select in back all of
the other objects that its covers in some way
 Align Selected Objects Left button to left-align all the selected objects
with the object you last select
 Center Selected Objects Vertically button to center all the selected
objects on the vertical centerline of the disc label or case insert you’re
currently designing
 Align Selected Objects Right button to right-align all the selected
objects with the object you last select
 Align Selected Objects Top button to align all the tops of the selected
objects with the top of the object you last select
 Center Selected Objects Horizontally button to center all the selected
objects on the horizontal centerline of the disc label or case insert
you’re currently designing
 Align Selected Objects Bottom button to align all the bottoms of the
selected objects with the bottom of the object you last select
 Match Object Width button to match the width of all the selected
objects to that of the object you last select
 Match Object Height button to match the height of all the selected
objects to that of the object you last select
 Match Object Width and Height button to match the width and height
of all the selected objects to that of the object you last select
 Size to Text button to resize the text box of a text graphic object so that
all of its text is displayed
205
Chapter 8: Creating Disc Labels and Case Inserts

The Properties palette
The Properties palette at the very bottom of the Tasks pane on the left side of
the Label Creator window contains just two tools for selecting the fill color
and outline color and thickness for selected image and graphic objects in the
layout you’re editing:
 Fill-Color button and Transparency slider to select the fill color and
opacity for either the image or graphic objects that are currently
selected in the label project
 Line-Color button, Transparency slider, and Thickness drop-down list
box to select the outline color, opacity, and thickness for the graphic
objects that are currently selected in the label project
Note that Fill-Color and Line-Color controls have no effect on any text objects
that are selected in the layout at the time you change their settings.

Instant Disc Labels and Case Inserts
Label Creator 7 supports an Instant Label Creator Mode which enables you to
whip up new disc labels, case inserts, and booklets in a jiff. You can access the
Instant Label Creator Mode by clicking the Start Label Creator button in any
Burn Progress dialog box or by choosing Tools➪Instant Label Creator Mode
from the Label Creator menu bar within the Label Creator window itself.
Label Creator responds by displaying the first page of the Instant Label Creator
in the dialog box shown in Figure 8-4. Here, you select the type of layout(s) that
you want to create by clicking the appropriate check box or boxes:
 Disc to create a standard CD or DVD disc label (the default already
checked whenever you open the Instant Label Creator dialog box)
 Mini Disc to create a disc label for the smaller 3-inch diameter mini-CD
(sometimes called a micro-CD)
 Front to design the front cover insert for a CD jewel case
 Slim Case Insert to create the front cover insert for a slim CD jewel case
 Back to create to the back cover insert for a CD jewel case
 DVD Case to create a front, back, and spine cover insert for a DVD case
 Booklet to create the front and back of a booklet insert for a CD jewel case
 DVD Booklet to create the front and back of a booklet insert for a DVD case
After you select all the check boxes for the layouts you want to include in the
new label project and click the Next button, the second page of the Instant
Label Creator similar to the one shown in Figure 8-5 appears. Here, you can
select the template that you want to use for the selected layout in the Template
drop-down list box and any theme that you want to apply to the entire label
project in the Theme drop-down list box. In addition, you can indicate which
Smart Objects to use in the new label project by selecting or deselecting their
check boxes.
Click the Auto-Fill from Disc link that you find on the lower-right side of the
Instant Label Creator dialog box to have Label Creator retrieve the information
for the Smart Objects that are checked in this dialog box from the audio or data
disc that’s currently in your computer’s CD-ROM or DVD drive. Label Creator
then adds the appropriate statistics such as the album name, artist name, and
track titles to the Preview section of the Instant Label Creator dialog box,
depending upon which particular template and layout are selected.

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

Note that you can edit any of the Smart Objects that you select in the Smart
Objects of the Layout section of the second page of the Instant Label Creator
by clicking the Edit link that appears after its name. For example, suppose that
you want to replace the default CD Audio R icon that automatically appears at
the bottom of a new disc label using the Audio template with CD Audio RW
(because you’ve burned an audio disc that is rewritable). To make this change,
you click the Edit link following the Disc Type check box to open the Edit Smart
Objects dialog box (shown in Figure 8-6) where you click the CD_audio_RW.png
graphic file in the Disc Type list box before clicking the OK button.
If you selected more than one layout check box in the dialog box with the first
page of the Instant Label Creator, you can use the Layout drop-down list box on
the second page to select any of those layouts. You can modify the theme for
that particular layout or edit a particular Smart Object that the layout uses.
When you finish editing the elements for the different layouts in your label
project in the second page of the Instant Label Creator, you can print the label
project by clicking the Print Now button. If you want to save your label project
and perhaps review its contents, checking for any further editing changes
that you might need to do in the Label Creator’s Layout pane, click the Edit
More button to close the Instant Label Creator dialog box and return to the
Label Creator window.
Always save your label project when you return to the Label Creator window
so that you can reuse it if you later make more copies of the same CD or DVD
disc. To save a label project, choose File➪Save Project on the Label Creator
menu bar or press Ctrl+S and then select the appropriate folder and filename
(Label Creator automatically adds the .JWL extension to it) in the Save As
dialog box before you click the Save button.

Editing Elements of the Label Project
Chances are that even after editing the contents of the layouts you select in
the second page of the Instant Label Creator, you will still want to make some
modifications to the layouts of the disc label and case inserts in your label
project. As you see in Figure 8-7, you can do your further editing in Label
Creator’s Layout pane using both the two rows of buttons at the top of the
Layout pane and the many controls in the Tasks pane (see “Getting Familiar
with the Label Creator Window” earlier in this chapter for details on the con-
trols in the Tasks pane).

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

Displaying the layout you want to edit
The top row of buttons on the Layout pane enables you to display and edit
the different layouts that you’ve included in your label project. The tab but-
tons that appear on this row depend upon which layouts you select for the
label project on the first page of the Instant Label Creator dialog box.
For the particular example shown in Figure 8-7, I included three layouts in 
the label project: Disc, Front, and Back. Label Creator therefore created three
tab buttons: Disc Label Layout, CD Case Front Insert Layout, and CD Case
Back Insert Layout to jump to and display the Disc, Front, and Back layout,
respectively. 
Note that the Show/Hide Layouts button at the end of the first row is always
displayed at the end of the first row of buttons regardless of which layout but-
tons you have. You click this button to display the Show/Hide Layouts dialog
box. This dialog box includes all the disc label and case insert layouts that
you selected from on the first page of the Instant Label Creator and enables
you to add to or remove layouts from the current project that you’re editing.
Editing the text objects in your layouts
The second row of buttons across the top of the Layout pane mostly enables
you to make modifications to the text objects in your layouts. However, the
very first button enables you to select zoom in and out on the layout you’re
editing by selecting a new magnification setting, and the very last button
enables you to layout you’re editing (or all the layouts in the label project, 
if you so desire).
The rest of the tools on this second row are used in modifying the text objects
that you have selected in the layout you’re editing. Most of these tools are the
standard ones you’re probably familiar with from using them in your word pro-
cessing program. For example, you use the Font drop-down list box to select a
new font for the selected text objects and the Font Size drop-down list box to
select a new font size. So too, you click the Bold Text button to add or remove
the boldface enhancement in the selected text objects, the Italicize Text button
to add or remove italics, the Underline Text to add or remove underlining, and
the Shadow Text to add or remove the shadow text enhancement (note that
you can only apply the shadow enhancement to certain fonts).
The Change Text Color button enables you to select a new color for the text 
in the text objects you’ve selected by clicking its color square in the pop-up
palette that appears when you click the button (you can also create new
colors for the text using the Eyedropper tool, the Hue and/or Shades mixing
boxes, or by entering new Red, Green, and Blue values or new Hue, Saturation,
211
Chapter 8: Creating Disc Labels and Case Inserts

and Value percentages). You can use the Left Align Text, Center Text, and Right
Align Text buttons to modify the text alignment within the text boxes of the
selected text objects. Note that Center Text option is the default for all new
text objects and that Label Creator automatically adjusts the text using what-
ever alignment option you select when you modify the size and shape of text
object’s text box.
The only two buttons that are definitely not standard in word processing 
programs are the Straighten Text and Curve Text buttons. These buttons are
great, however, when editing the layout for your disc labels. Because of the
round nature of disc labels, it often makes sense to put text like the album
and artist’s name on a curve rather than on a straight line. 
To curve a particular text object in the Disc Label Layout, click the text object
or objects (Ctrl+Click to select more than one) and then click the Curve Text
button. After curving the text box of a particular text object, you can then
rotate that text box around the disc label (Label Creator will modify the text to
suit the new orientation on the disc). If you decide that a particular text object
doesn’t look so hot on the curve, you can convert it back to a standard text
box with straight text by clicking the Straighten Text button.
When it comes to the text objects that contain track lists (automatically gener-
ated by clicking the Auto-Fill from Smart Objects link in the second page of the
Instant Label Creator dialog box or by choosing Tools➪Auto-Fill Smart Objects
from Disc on the Label Creator menu bar), Label Creator automatically left-aligns
their text in their text boxes. Further in the Disc Label Layout, the program also
automatically indents the list to fit the curve of the label (both the curve of the
inside hole and that of the outer diameter) when you position this list on the left
or right side of the disc label.
Figure 8-8 shows my edited disc label after making modifications to all of its
text objects. In this example, I used the Curve Text button to put both the
album and artist name on the bias at the top of the label (I also used the Bold
button to boldface their text and the Font drop-down list box to change the
font from Minya Nouvelle to Arial). For the text object containing the track
list, I manually resized its text box after selecting Arial Narrow in the Font
drop-down list and reducing the font from 9 to 8 points by selecting 8 in the
Font Size drop-down list. Then I dragged this text object to its final position
on the right side of the label, making sure that all of the track list information
was now displayed.
Remember that instead of having to manually resize each text box to suit a
font or font size change, you can have Label Creator automatically do this for
you by clicking the Size to Text button in the Tools palette in Tasks pane.
212
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

Editing the image and graphic 
objects in your layouts
When editing the layouts for the disc label and case inserts in your label pro-
ject, you may well have to edit their image and graphic objects. Remember that
image objects contain any graphics files that you add to the layouts, whereas
graphic objects are composed of the rectangles, circular shapes, and straight
lines that you insert with the Add Rectangle Object, Add Circle Object, and Add
Line Object tools on the Add Object palette.
When you click an image or graphic object in the layout, Label Creator indi-
cates that it is selected by placing sizing handles around the perimeter of the
object. You can then drag these sizing handles to make the selected image or
graphic object larger or smaller.
To reposition the image or graphic object that you’ve selected, position the
mouse pointer in the middle of the selected image or graphic and then use the
hand pointer to drag the object to the desired position in the current layout.
Figure 8-8:
The Disc
Label Layout

its text
objects with
the tools at
the top of
the Layout
pane.
213
Chapter 8: Creating Disc Labels and Case Inserts

The sizing and moving of line graphic objects present a little different story
from all the rest. To select a line graphic for resizing, click one of its two ends
to add a gray resizing handle. Then position the arrowhead mouse pointer over
that sizing handle and drag the mouse (the pointer then becomes a hand) until
the line is longer or shorter (you can also rotate the line around the opposite,
unselected end which remains stationary).
To reposition a line graphic, drag the mouse to draw a bounding box around
the line to select both ends. One end of the line then displays a gray sizing
handle, while the other end displays a white repositioning handle. You posi-
tion the arrowhead mouse pointer over the white repositioning handle and
then drag the mouse (the pointer then becomes a hand) to move the entire
line graphic object to the desired position in the current layout.
You can also delete and cut or copy a selected image or graphic object to the
Windows Clipboard. To delete the object, press the Delete key. To cut the
image (for later pasting in other layout), press Ctrl+X. To copy the object
instead, press Ctrl+C. To paste the object you’ve cut or copied to the Clipboard
in a new part of the layout (or another layout that you’ve selected by clicking
its tab button on the top row of the Label Creator window), press Ctrl+V.
Keep in mind when editing the images and graphics in a particular layout that
you can also select a new background image or color to use in that layout 
by clicking the Edit Background link in the Edit Layout palette in the Tasks
pane. Label Creator then opens the Edit Smart Objects dialog box with the
Background object selected (any color or image you select in this dialog box
overrides any background graphic supplied to the current layout by the
theme you’ve applied to the entire label project). 
To add a new background color, click the color in the color palette in the Edit
Smart Objects dialog box or click the More Colors button and create a custom
color in the More Colors dialog box. To add a new background image instead,
click the Use the Following Image as Background Image check box in the Edit
Smart Objects dialog box and then click the Browse button. Label Creator
then opens the Add dialog box where you can select the folder and graphics
file that contains the image you want displayed as the background of the
layout you’re editing.
Figure 8-9 shows you my sample disc label in the Label Creator’s Layout pane
after modifying the two image objects: the one of the album cover that serves
as the Content Illustration on the left side (this scanned image replaces the
stock photo of the guy sitting in the chair listening to music with his head-
phones) and the default Disc Type graphic that identifies the disc as the CD
Audio R type. I resized the Content Illustration so that it matches as closely
as possible the size of the track list and then repositioned this image on the
left side of the disc label. I then resized the Disc Type image, although I left it
in its original position at the bottom of the label.
214
Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

If you decide that you want to replace a particular image object in the layout,
double-click the object. Doing this causes Label Creator to open the Edit Smart
Objects dialog box with that image’s smart object already selected. You can
then use the controls in this dialog box to select the replacement graphic.
Printing Disc Labels and Case Inserts
After you have all the layouts in your label project edited the way you want
them, you’re ready to print the project (after you saved your changes with
Ctrl+S, of course). Before you actually send the project to the printer, it’s
always a good idea to use the program’s Print Preview feature to check each
layout in the project and make sure that every detail is exactly as you want it
(remember, generally speaking you’re wasting special, fairly expensive paper
with the adhesive disc labels and perforations for the case inserts and not
just regular cheapo paper if you print your layouts with errors).
To check the layouts with Print Preview, click the tab button for the first
layout at the top of the Layout pane and then choose File➪Print Preview on
the Label Creator menu bar. Label Creator opens the first layout (usually 
the one with the disc label) in the Print Preview window (shown in Figure
8-10). You can then use the buttons in the Print Preview toolbar to display the
Figure 8-9:
Sample disc
label in 
the Layout
pane after
resizing and
reposition-
ing its image
objects.
215
Chapter 8: Creating Disc Labels and Case Inserts

next and previous pages (Next and Prev) in the project, zoom in and out on
details in the layout (Zoom In and Zoom Out), or even switch between two-
page and single-page displays (Two Page and One Page, which replaces the
Two Page button when you click it). Note that you can also click a particular
section of the layout with the Magnifying Glass mouse pointer to zoom in on
it in the display.
When you finish checking your layouts in Print Preview, you can load your
printer with special label paper and then click the Print button to open the
Print dialog box and then send the job to the printer. If you find some details
that need further modification or you want to check the page setup settings
before you print the project, click the Close button to close the Print Preview
window and to return to the Label Creator window.
Because you want to use special paper in printing the different layouts in a
typical label project (high-gloss adhesive label paper for labels and matte
finish perforated paper for case inserts), you often need to change the page
settings before printing each layout in the project separately, each time
putting the right paper into your printer as well as making sure that you’ve
put the paper in the right way (some printers want the glossy side of the
label paper facing down, while others want it facing up).

the Paper Type to use in printing each layout in the label project as well as
make any necessary adjustments to where the printing starts. To select a dif-
ferent paper type besides Generic (plain paper), the default setting for all the
layouts in your project, click the Current Paper Type drop-down list button
for that layout and select the type and size of paper you’re using (this list
contains a wide range of paper types and sizes from different manufacturers).
To select a new layout for which to select a new paper type, click that layout’s
tab at the top of the Page Setup dialog box (click the button at the right of the
last tab with the blue triangle pointing right to display more tabs for the other
layouts in your label project).
The Page Setup dialog box also enables you to adjust the start positioning of
the printout on the particular paper you select. To adjust how far the printing
starts from the left edge of the paper (relative to the orientation of the diagram
of the sheet shown in the Position to Print Out to the Paper area of the Page
Setup dialog box), enter a new value into the Horizontal text box or select a
new value with its plus (+) or minus (–) buttons. To adjust how far down the
printing starts from the top of the paper (relative to the way it’s shown in the
diagram), enter a new value into the Vertical text box or select a new value
with its plus (+) or minus (–) buttons.
After you finish selecting the paper type for the various layouts in your label
project, you’re ready to print each one. To do this, close the Page Setup dialog
box by clicking OK and then choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P to open the
Print dialog box like the one shown in Figure 8-12.

Chapter 8: Creating Disc Labels and Case Inserts

The Print dialog box contains a whole bunch of print options that you can
modify before actually sending the print job to the printer by clicking the 
OK button:
 Name drop-down list box to select a different printer installed on your
computer system to use in printing the label project
 Status displays the current printing status of the printer selected in the
Name drop-down list box
 Type displays the model of printer that is currently selected in the Name
drop-down list box
 Properties button to open the Properties dialog box for the type of printer
currently selected where you can change certain advanced settings (which
are entirely printer dependent) such as the paper orientation (Portrait or
Landscape), the page order in printing, the paper source, and the printer
quality, among other things
 Printer Adjustments button to open the Printer Adjustments dialog box
(see Figure 8-13) where you can tweak where the printer starts printing on
each page and increase or decrease the height and width of the printing
 Paper Type displays a description of the type of paper along with its
diagram for the layout which is currently selected in the area with the
check boxes below. Click the check box before the name of each layout
you want included the print job. Click the name of the layout following
the check box to display a description and diagram of the type of paper
selected for that particular layout in central sections of the Print dialog
box (click the Page Setup button to open the Page Setup dialog box
where you can modify the paper type for the selected layout)

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

 Print Disc Cut Lines check box to print dotted lines indicated where the
label or case inserts should be cut in the printout
 Print Disc Outline check box to print the outline of the disc (when print-
ing the Disc layout) in the printout
 Page Setup button to open the Page Setup dialog box where you can
select a new type of paper for the currently selected layout and modify
the start position for the printing on that type of paper
 Page Range option button to print only the range of pages you indicate
in the From and To text boxes rather than all the pages needed for each
layout you’ve selected for printing in the Paper Type area of the Print
dialog box
 Copies text box to indicate the number of copies to print of each layout
whose check box is selected in the Print dialog
 Print Test Page button to obtain a quick and dirty printout just showing
part of the outline of the disc label or case insert you’re printing: you
can then use this test page to compare with the outlines of the labels on
the actual label paper or perforations of the case inserts on the actual
insert paper to see if you need to make any adjustments to where the
printing starts before actually returning to the Print dialog box and
printing the real disc labels and case inserts
After you finish modifying the necessary print settings in the Print dialog box,
you can start the printing by clicking the OK button to send the print job to 
the printer. If your printer requires manual feeding of the type of paper you
selected for printing one or more of the selected layouts, you will be prompted
to insert the paper before the printing actually begins.
After printing your label project, you may find that you still need to make
slight adjustments to where the print area begins or to the overall size of the
print area. To make these adjustments before trying to print the label project
again, choose File➪Printer Adjustments on the Label Creator menu bar or, 
if you have the Print dialog box open, click the Printer Adjustments button.
Label Creator opens the Printer Adjustments dialog box shown in Figure 8-13.
Here, you can adjust the left edge of the print area (relative to the left edge 
of the paper as it’s fed into the printer as shown in the Preview Area of this
dialog box) by entering a new value between –5.00 and 5.00 in the Horizontal
text box or by selecting the value with its plus (+) and minus (–) buttons — a
positive value moves the print area slightly to the right, while a negative value
moves it slightly to the left (relative to the default print area for the type of
printer you’ve selected). 
219
Chapter 8: Creating Disc Labels and Case Inserts

So too, you can adjust the top edge of the print area (relative to the top edge
of the paper as it’s fed into the printer as shown in the Preview Area of this
dialog box) by entering a new value between –5.00 and 5.00 in the Vertical
text box or by selecting the value with its plus (+) and minus (–) buttons — 
a positive value moves the print area slightly down, while a negative value
moves it slightly up (relative to the default print area for the type of printer
you’ve selected).
In addition to adjusting where the print area starts in relation to left and top
edge of the paper, you can also increase or decrease the size of the printing
area (and thereby the size of the disc labels and case inserts that are being
printing within it) by adjusting the scaling in the Height and Width text boxes
in the Printer Adjustments dialog box. 
Note that as long as the Keep Aspect Ratio check box has a checkmark, any
adjustment you make to the scaling of the height in the print area in the Height
text box is automatically echoed in the Width text box as well. So, for example,
if you enter 90 into the Height text box, Label Creator immediately changes the
value in the Width text box to 90 as well (and because this 90 represents a per-
centage of the overall height and width of the print area and not an actual
dimension, the physical length and width change proportionally). 
If you want to be able to adjust the Height and Width percentages indepen-
dently, you need to click the Keep Aspect Ratio check box to remove its
checkmark before you enter a new percentage value in either of these text
boxes or select one with their respective plus (+) and minus (–) buttons.
After making any necessary adjustments to paper alignments or print area scal-
ing in the Printer Adjustments dialog box and clicking the OK button, you’re
ready to try printing all or just some of the layouts in your label projects.

Part III: Creating Audio CDs and Photo Projects 

Applying Labels to Discs
Applying the disc label to the actual CD or DVD disc is, perhaps, one of the
most daunting tasks that a body can perform because if you mess up and get
any wrinkles or bubbles in the label, you might as well toss the CD or DVD
disc in the trash, cause it’ll never play properly (if at all). 
So too, you must never, never, ever try to remove and reapply a disc label 
that you’ve only got partially applied to a disc, as the adhesive in the label will
undoubtedly rip off part of the coating on the top of the disc (the one that’s
not read by the laser) and as a result the disc is dead meat and will never 
play again.
In other words, the application of disc labels to your CD or DVD discs is a one-
shot deal during which you cannot afford any flub-ups (enough to make you
sweat bullets). In fact, because it’s such a delicate practice that I’ve screwed
up plenty in my time, I won’t even attempt to apply a disc label without the
aid of one of the those applicators which consists of a spindle for centering
the disc and label and a base for holding the label (adhesive side up and
printed side down) with a spring-loaded plunger-type spindle in the middle,
with the button in the middle for pushing down the disc (with the top, coated
side facing down and the shiny, data side that you never touch facing up) to
meet and bond with the adhesive on the label. (The particular model I favor is
a sweet Italian number by Neato that has a felt pad on the bottom of the base
so it won’t slide during the crucial punch-down phase where the top, coated
side of the CD or DVD disc meets the adhesive of the disc label.) You can also
find other models by manufacturers such as DYMO and USDM that you can
use to do the same thing.

Part IV
Creating Projects
for DVDs

In this part . . .
I
t seems to me that the heart of the Easy Media Creator 7
suite lies in its two major applications for video produc-
tions: VideoWave, which provides you with an easy-to-use
but robust video editor; and DVD Builder, which provides
you with both an easy-to-use DVD project builder and
Roxio’s great burn engine for burning both your video and
DVD projects to disc. Part IV not only covers the complete
use of these two applications (in Chapters 10 and 11) but
also covers, in Chapter 9, Easy Media Creator’s Capture
program, a tool that you’ll come to rely on heavily for
acquiring the various types of digital media you use in
your projects destined for DVD.

Chapter 9
Acquiring Digital Media 
In This Chapter
 Launching the Capture tool and selecting the devices from which to acquire media
 Scanning photos or copying them directly from your digital camera
 Capturing live video or video clips from your Web camera or digital camcorder

 Moving and copying captured media files to new media collection files
B
efore you can get down to making your own videos and movies with
either the Easy Media Creator’s VideoWave program or its DVD builder,
you have to acquire the digital media files that you need in putting together
your final multimedia productions. These media files can include video clips
taken from your digital camcorder, still images from your digital camera and
scanner, audio files recorded with your computer’s microphone or taken
through a line into your computer from an analog device like a LP record
player or audio cassette as well as audio tracks from an audio CD and, if all
that’s not enough for you, DVD movie titles that you’ve saved on your com-
puter’s hard disk as well.
This chapter gives you the lowdown on how to use Roxio Easy Media
Creator’s Capture utility to acquire all these different types of digital media
for your video and DVD movie productions. It also gives you pointers on how
to organize the media files that you acquire and save to your hard disk with
the Capture utility into media collections that are ready to use when you go
on to make your multimedia productions with VideoWave (see Chapter 10)
and the DVD Builder (see Chapter 11).
Using the Capture Tool
In acquiring media for your video and DVD movie productions, you will come
to rely heavily on the Roxio Capture tool. To launch Capture from the Roxio
Easy Media Creator Home window, click the Capture link in the Tools column.
To launch Capture from the Windows taskbar, click the Start button on the

taskbar; highlight the All Programs option on the Start menu followed by the
Roxio option on the All Programs submenu before you click the Capture
option at the very top of the Roxio submenu.
Capture is also supposed to automatically launch whenever you use
Windows XP’s plug-and-play feature to an external digital device such as a
scanner, digital camera, or digital camcorder to your computer using the
cable and port appropriate to that device. Note, however, that this feature
may not work if you’ve installed another graphics or video editing program
after installing Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 on your computer. In such a case,
you have to manually launch Capture after connecting the device.
The initial Capture window similar to the one shown in Figure 9-1 appears.
This window contains links to all the digital devices along with all the other
sources for acquiring different types of digital media that you have available
to your computer in the Detected Devices pane on the left. When you posi-
tion the mouse pointer over a particular link in the Detected Devices pane, a
description of what kind of media you can acquire from that device appears.
To start the process of acquiring data from a particular device (such as your
digital camera or camcorder) or source (such as DVD movie titles saved on
your hard disk), you click its link in the Detected Devices.
Figure 9-1:

226
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs

Connecting digital devices 
to use in Capture
Before an external device such as your scanner, digital camera, or camcorder
will appear in the Detected Devices pane of the Capture window, you must
have it properly installed and connected to your computer. Note that most
digital devices such as digital cameras and scanners connect to your com-
puter through a free USB (Universal Serial Bus) port using a special USB cable.
Others devices such as digital video cameras (also known as camcorders)
usually connect to your computer via the faster, IEEE1394 FireWire connection
necessary to handle streaming video (note, however, that some of the newer
digital cameras that take video as well as still pictures also support FireWire).
When dealing with external digital devices such as scanners and digital still
cameras, there are two standards (both of which are supported by Capture)
for acquiring still images and streaming video: the so-called TWAIN (as in
Kipling’s “Never the twain shall meet . . .”) standard and Microsoft’s WIA
(Windows Image Acquisition) standard developed for Windows XP. In order
for Capture to recognize your TWAIN or WIA device, you must have installed
the TWAIN or WIA device drivers on your computer (these drivers are sup-
plied on the CDs that come with your devices — if you don’t have the CD
readily available, check the manufacturer’s Web site for them).
To install the drivers for a new digital device, you may need to open the
Scanners and Cameras control panel dialog box (do this by clicking the Control
Panel item on the Windows Start menu, the Printers and Other Hardware link 
in the Pick a Category area of the Control Panel dialog box, and then clicking
Scanners and Cameras link in the Or Pick a Control Panel Icon area of the
Printers and Other Hardware dialog box). In the Scanners and Cameras dialog
box, click the Add an Imaging Device link in Imaging Tasks pane on the left 
and then follow the steps in the Scanner and Camera Installation Wizard 
that appears. When prompted for the name of the scanner or camera you 
want to install, either select the name of the manufacturer and model in the
Manufacturer and Model list boxes or click the Have Disk button and then
select the letter of your computer’s CD drive in the Copy Manufacturer’s Files
From drop-down list box before you click the OK button.
After Windows finishes copying the device drivers from the manufacturer’s CD,
an icon with the name of the new digital scanner or camera appears in the
Scanners and Cameras dialog box. If you close this dialog box and then launch
Capture, the name of the scanner or camera you just installed with the Windows
Scanner and Camera Installation Wizard appears in the Detected Devices. This
happens as soon as you connect the scanner or camera to your computer with
the proper USB or IEEE1394 FireWire cable and turn the device on (the name of
the device appears behind a WIA or TWAIN icon depending upon which type 
of driver it uses). You can then start acquiring images from these digital devices
in Capture by clicking the links associated with their names in the Detected
Devices pane.
227
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

Customizing the Capture options
Before you start working with Capture to acquire your favorite media files,
you may want to modify the default locations where the program automati-
cally saves different types of media files in the Options dialog box. To do this,
choose File➪Options to open the Options dialog box similar to the one shown
in Figure 9-2. As you can see in this figure, the top portion of this dialog box
contains a Temporary Working Folders list box that shows you the path and
the name of the folder where Photo, Video, Audio, and DVD media files are
automatically saved when you acquire them with Capture.
To change any of these default folder locations, click the type of media and
its pathname in this list box and then click the Modify Selected Media Type’s
Location button (that becomes active only after you click one of the media
types in the Temporary Working Folders list box). The Browse Location
dialog box then appears with a list box containing a Navigation Tree that
shows the selected media type’s current default folder location. Use the
Navigation Tree in this list box to select a new folder location (you can also
use the New Folder button at the bottom of the Browse Location dialog box
to create a new folder to use) and then click the OK button.
The lower portion of the Options dialog box contains three option buttons,
File (Recommended), Memory, and Native, which determine how devices
using the TWAIN-type drivers transfer their files. The File (Recommended)
option button is the default and the Roxio people highly advocate leaving this
option selected. Should you connect a TWAIN device that can’t use the File
transfer option, Capture is programmed to talk to the device and automati-
cally select either the Memory or Native transfer option. You would only
manually change to one of these two other options if Capture proved unable
to automatically detect which of these two other transfer methods to use.

Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs

Acquiring Digital Photos
Most of the time, you will acquire the digital photos that you use in your vari-
ous photo and DVD productions either from your scanner or directly from your
digital camera. You use the scanner to acquire and simultaneously convert
developed photos into digital media. Photos taken with a digital camera, of
course, require no analog-to-digital conversion and don’t have to be acquired
through Capture (you may prefer to acquire digital photos from your camera
and save them on your computer using the software that came with the camera
or using Windows Scanner and Camera Wizard).
The next two sections cover how to use Capture to acquire digital photos from
these two types of devices. First, you find out how to acquire photos that you
scan via Capture and then you find out how to acquire photos when your 
digital camera is connected to your computer using either a TWAIN or WIA
device driver.
Scanning images into Capture
To scan a photo into Capture, you follow these steps:
1. Launch Capture and then connect the scanner to your computer and
turn it on if you haven’t already done so.
Place the photo that you want to acquire in Capture in the proper posi-
tion on the scanner’s glass plate. If you’re using a scanner in which you
feed the sheet, get the paper ready to feed. If you’re using a handheld
scanner, position the scanner at the top of the sheet.
2. Click the link associated with the scanner’s name in the Detected
Devices pane.
Capture opens a Capture window which contains two panes: a Capture
From pane on the left showing the name the scanner and a Contents Of
pane on the right that shows the preview of the photo you’re scanning
after you click the Preview button.
3. Click the Preview button to have the scanner preview the photo
you’re scanning.
After the scanner finishes previewing the image you’re scanning, its pre-
view appears in the Contents pane. You can then adjust the scan rectangle
in the Contents pane so that it surrounds only the photo (if it’s smaller
than the platen) or the part of the photo you want scanned. To adjust the
scanning area, you drag the sizing handles on the scan rectangle until it
encloses just the area you want included (see Figure 9-3).
229
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

4. Drag the sizing handles on the scan rectangle until this rectangle
encloses the area of the photo you want scanned.
You can adjust the scan quality by selecting among the Good (100 dpi),
Better (150 dpi), Best (300 dpi), and Other option buttons — when you
select Other, you can choose between 600 x 600 dpi (dots per inch) and
1200 x 1200 dpi, in the Scan Quality drop-down list box, assuming that
your scanner supports these very high resolution settings. Of course,
the higher the scan resolution, the more detail you get and the larger the
resulting graphics file.
5. (Optional) Select the desired scan quality option button and then click
the Next > button to proceed to the next Capture window.
The Capture task pane enables you to designate the folder where you
want to save the scanned digital photo file as well as the descriptive name
you want to assign to the photo (Capture automatically appends the next
available sequential number starting with 00000 to this name) and allows
you to associate the photo with one of the collections that you’ve already
set up in Media Manager or with a new collection that you create.
6. (Optional) To save the photo in a folder other than default folder for
Photo media, click the Browse Folders button and then select the
desired destination folder using the Navigation Tree in the Browse
Location dialog box.
You can change the descriptive part of the photo name in the Name the
Photo text box. If you don’t select a new photo name, Capture automati-
cally uses Captured Photos as the descriptive name to which it appends
the next available sequential number, as in Captured Photos 00000,
Captured Photos 00001, and so on.
7. (Optional) Click the Name the Photo text box and replace Captured
Photos with your own descriptive name.
You may associate the photo you’re about to scan with an existing or a
new collection (see the section “Adding Media Files to Collections” later
in this chapter for more on file collections).
8. (Optional) Click the Browse Collections button and then click the
name of the collection file to which you want to make the scanned
photo a part in the Browse Collection dialog box or click its New
button and enter the name for the new collection in the Browse
Collection Navigation Tree before you click OK.
Now that you’ve made all your desired changes to the settings in the
Capture task pane, you’re ready to have Capture actually scan the photo
and save it on your hard disk.
230
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs

9. Click the Capture > button at the bottom of the Capture Settings pane
to scan the photo.
After Capture finishes scanning and saving your photo, the program 
displays the Photo Successfully Captured alert dialog box.
10. Click OK to close the Photo Successfully Captured alert dialog box.
After you close this alert dialog box, Capture displays its final Capture
task pane (shown in Figure 9-4) where you can select an Easy Media
Creator application (Media Manager, DVD Builder, PhotoSuite 7, or
VideoWave 7) in which to use the scanned photo (Capture opens the
program whose option button is selected as soon as you click the Done
button). You can also elect to do more media capturing by clicking the
Capture More option button (which takes you back to the initial Capture
window when you click the Done button), or you can indicate that you’re
finished capturing media by leaving the default Finished Capturing
option button selected when you click the Done button.
11. Select the appropriate activity option button in the Capture task pane
and then click the Done button at the very bottom of the Capture
window.

Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

Copying photos directly from your camera
The procedure for capturing photos directly from a digital camera that you’ve
connected to your computer is very similar to that for capturing scanned
images. The big difference between the two procedures is the amount of
photos that you capture: normally, when you use Capture to copy photos from
your digital camera, you import a whole bunch of photos at one time rather
than copying just a single image as when capturing from your scanner.
The general steps for copying the photos on your digital camera onto your
hard disk are as follows:
1. Launch Capture and then connect the digital camera to your computer
and turn it on if you haven’t already done so.
Note that connecting your camera may well cause the Windows XP
Photo Wizard or some other photo editing software that came with your
camera to automatically start up. If that happens, click the program’s
close box to return to the Capture program.
You have to click the link in the Detected Devices pane of the initial
Capture window for your camera.
2. Click the link with your camera’s name in the Detected Devices pane.
Capture opens a Capture window which contains two panes: a Capture
From pane on the left showing the name the camera and a Contents Of

232
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs

pane on the right that shows thumbnails of all the photos on your
camera, all of which are automatically selected for copying.
Depending upon the make of your camera, the Capture From task pane
may contain more than one folder from which you can import files (this is
especially true in the case of digital cameras that take video as well as still
images). If, after selecting the folder which contains the images to import,
you decide that you don’t want to copy all the images onto your hard disk,
click the Deselect All Files button and then hold down the Ctrl key as you
click the thumbnails of just the photos you do want to import.
3. (Optional) Select the folder that contains the images you want to
import. If you don’t want all the images in a folder, click the Deselect
All Files button and then Ctrl+click the thumbnails of the images you
do want to copy.
After selecting the images to import, you’re ready to proceed to the next
window where you select a destination folder, specify a group name for
the photos, and, if you wish, make the imported photos part of a media
collection.
4. Click the Next > button to proceed to the next Capture window.
You can change the folder on your hard disk where the digital photos
are saved.
5. (Optional) To save the photos in a folder other than the default folder
for Photo media, click the Browse Folders button and then select the
desired destination folder using the Navigation Tree in the Browse
Location dialog box.
You can assign a descriptive group name to the photos in the Group Files
Name text box. If you don’t select a new photo name, Capture automati-
cally uses the filenames that the camera assigns to the photos. If you do
enter a group filename, Capture then automatically appends the next
available sequential number starting with 00000 whatever group name
you assign.
6. (Optional) Click the Group File Name text box and type in a descrip-
tive name for the group of photos you’re about to import.
You may associate the photos you’re about to copy with an existing or 
a new collection (see “Adding Media Files to Collections” later in this
chapter for more on file collections).
7. (Optional) Click the Browse Collections button and then click the
name of the collection file to which you want to make the imported
photos a part in the Browse Collection dialog box or click its New
button and enter the name for the new collection in the Browse
Collection Navigation Tree before you click OK.
You may want to have Capture remove the selected photos from the
camera after copying them to your hard disk.
233
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

8. (Optional) Click the Delete Photos from Camera After Capture check
box if you want Capture to remove the selected photos from the
camera’s storage after it copies them onto your hard disk.
Now you’re ready to have Capture import the selected photos to the
destination folder that you’ve specified.
9. Click the Capture > button at the bottom of the Capture Settings pane
to scan the photo.
After Capture finishes copying and saving your photo, the program dis-
plays the Files Successfully Captured alert dialog box and thumbnails of
the imported photos appear in the Contents pane on the right side of
the Capture window.
10. Click OK to close the Files Successfully Captured alert dialog box.
After you close this alert dialog box, Capture displays its final Capture
task pane where you can select an Easy Media Creator application
(Media Manager, DVD Builder, PhotoSuite 7, or VideoWave 7) in which 
to use the scanned photo (Capture opens the program whose option
button is selected as soon as you click the Done button). You can also
elect to do more media capturing by clicking the Capture More option
button (which takes you back to the initial Capture window when you
click the Done button), or you can indicate that you’re finished captur-
ing media by leaving the default Finished Capturing option button
selected when you click the Done button.
11. Select the appropriate activity option button in the Capture task pane
and then click the Done button at the very bottom of the Capture
window.
Acquiring Digital Video
Capture is perhaps most useful when you use it to capture digital video that
you’ve taken with your DV (digital video) camera (also known affectionately as
a camcorder). Note that although you will mostly use capture to import video
clips from footage that you’ve already taken, you can also use Capture to 
capture live video taken with your camcorder (which, of course, must remain
connected to your computer throughout the shoot) or with a Web camera.
When importing previously recorded video clips from your DV camera, you 
can choose between importing the video with Manual Capture or SmartScan
Capture. When you capture clips with Manual Capture (the only mode available
when you’re capturing live footage with your DV or Web camera), you decide
which video to capture by manually operating a Start Capturing and Stop
234
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs

Capturing button. When you capture clips with SmartScan Capture, Capture
scans the entire video tape, using the time-code information stored on the tape
to automatically divide it into discrete scenes which you can then import.
Figure 9-5 shows the type of Capture window that appears after you connect
your camera to you computer, turn the camera on in Video mode (sometimes
abbreviated VTR) and then click the link for your DV Camera in the initial
Capture window. This DV Capture window contains a Capture Preview pane
where you can see the video footage that you’re capturing on the left side
and a Media Selector pane where you can select the media collection file into
which you want to add the captured video.
Beneath the Preview Pane, you see the following three controls that enable
you to select the Capture settings that you now want to use in capturing your
video:
 Video Capture Format drop-down list box that enables you to choose
between the default DV mode, which captures full-size video in the AVI
uncompressed file format that eats up hard disk space like nobody’s
business, and MPEG-2 mode, which captures full-size video using the
MPEG-2 compressed file format (which still gives you good quality video
along with smaller files sizes)

After specifying the video capture format, mode, and settings, select All
Collections in the Media Selector drop-down list box and then click the name
of the of media collection to which you want to add the video clips that you
import before you click the Next > button. Selecting the collection in which 
to put the clips before you start capturing them saves you from having to
organize them later with Media Manager. Note, however, that you must have
created the media collection file in Media Manager (see Chapter 4) before you
launch Capture and select the name of your DV camera in the Detected
Devices pane.
Capturing recorded video 
with SmartScan Capture
When you click the SmartScan Capture button to have the program scan your
tape for scenes, a Capture Window similar to the one shown in Figure 9-6
appears. Here, you click the Start Scan button (which then turns into a Stop
Scan button). Capture responds by rewinding the video tape if necessary and
then scanning the tape for potential scenes. 
As Capture fast forwards through the video, scanning its time code, the pro-
gram lists the scenes it locates in the SmartScan – Scenes pane on the right.
Each scene listed in the SmartScan – Scenes pane displays the thumbnail of
the first frame in the scene, is sequentially numbered (Scene 1, Scene 2, and
so on), and lists the duration of the scene in minutes and seconds (as in
5m42s for a scene that is five minutes and 42 seconds long).
236
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs

After Capture finishes scanning your video tape and identifying all the scenes
it contains, you need to click the Next > button to advance to the next Capture
window (shown in Figure 9-7) where you indicate which scenes to capture
and where to capture them to:
1. Ctrl+Click all the individual scenes in the SmartScan – Scenes pane that
you want to import or press Ctrl+A to select all the scenes identified on
the tape.
After selecting the scenes to capture in the SmartScan – Scenes pane, you
can select the descriptive part of the video filename into which the indi-
vidual video scenes are saved. If you don’t modify this option, Capture
gives these video files the default filename of VideoCap followed by the
next available sequential number as in VideoCap0, VideoCap1, and so on.
2. (Optional) Click the Video File text box and replace the descriptive
part of the default video file name with one of your own.
Before you begin capturing video in the selected scenes, you need to
select the folder in which the video is automatically saved (usually this
default folder is the My Videos folder in the My Documents folder on
your hard disk).
3. Click the Default Folder button and then select the folder in which
you want the video files saved using the Navigation Tree in the Folder
Location dialog box or click the New button to create a new folder
before you click OK.

Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

Now you’re ready to start capturing the video in the selected scenes.
4. Click the Start Capture button to have Capture locate and record the
video in the selected scenes.
The moment you click the Start Capture button to start recording the
video, it becomes a Stop Capture button that you can click to stop the
recording before all the selected scenes are captured.
5. Click the Done button when Capture finishes capturing all the selected
scenes.
Capture then displays a Files Successfully Captured alert dialog box indi-
cating where your video files have been saved.
6. Click the OK button to close the Files Successfully Captured dialog box.
Capture displays its final Capture task pane where you can select an Easy
Media Creator application (Media Manager, DVD Builder, PhotoSuite 7, 
or VideoWave 7) in which to use the scanned photo (Capture opens the
program whose option button is selected as soon as you click the Done
button). You can also elect to do more media capturing by clicking the
Capture More option button (which takes you back to the initial Capture
window when you click the Done button), or you can indicate that you’re
finished capturing media by leaving the default Finished Capturing option
button selected when you click the Done button.
7. Select the appropriate activity option button in the Capture task pane
and then click the Done button at the very bottom of the Capture
window.

Capturing recorded video 
with Manual Capture
Instead of having Capture decide where the scenes are in your video tape, you
can identify the scenes yourself and determine what video you want to import
using the Manual Capture mode. To manually capture video, make sure that
the Manual Capture option button is selected in the initial Capture task pane
before you click the Next > button. Capture then displays a window similar to
the one shown in Figure 9-8 where you can use the standard controls at the
bottom of the Preview pane (the same as you find on your video remote) to
preview the video and find that place where you want to start recording.
As with SmartScan, you can indicate the group filename you want your video
clips to have, specify the folder where these video files are saved, and specify
the media collection file with which they are associated before you begin cap-
turing the video.
To capture a video clip, locate the place in the tape where you want to begin
recording the clip and then click the Pause button to pause the playback.
Next, click the Start Capturing button to begin recording a new scene. When
you reach the place in the tape where you want to stop the recording, click
the Stop Capturing button (which replaces the Start Capturing button the
moment you click it). Note that Capture may automatically divide your video

clip into sequentially numbered scenes starting with Scene_000000 depend-
ing upon the Limit Capture setting in effect for your video camera before you
actually click the Stop Capturing button.
If you want to record all the video on the tape, simply click the Capture Full
Tape button. Capture then rewinds the tape and records all its video from
beginning to end.
When you finish manually capturing video clips, click the Done button. As with
SmartScan Capture, the program displays the Files Successfully Captured alert
dialog box followed by the final Capture task pane that contains the next activity
option buttons (Media Manager, DVD Builder, PhotoSuite 7, VideoWave 7, Capture
More, or Finished Capturing) that you can select before clicking its Done button.
Recording live video with Manual Capture
Instead of importing video clips from the video you’ve already recorded on
tape, you can use Capture’s Manual Capture mode to import live video as
you’re actually recording it. To record live video in Capture, you have to
make sure that you switch your DV camera to Camera or Record mode rather
than Video mode before you select the DV camera in the Detected Devices
pane in the initial Capture window. When you select your camcorder in the
initial Capture window and the camera is set to Camera or Record mode,
Manual Capture is the only capture mode available (the SmartScan Capture
option button is grayed out).
When you click the Next > button, the familiar Manual Capture window
appears (like the one shown earlier in Figure 9-8) where you can select the
standard part of the video filenames and the folder where the clips are saved
as well as the media collection with which the video files are to be associ-
ated. You’ll find the biggest difference in the Capture Preview pane, which
now shows you what your video camera’s lens is actually seeing at the time
rather than a key frame recorded on the tape.
To start capturing what the camera is seeing (even if the video camera is 
in standby mode), click the Start Capturing button in the Capture window.
Capture then records what the camera sees in real time. To get the shot you
want, you can then pan the camera and use its zoom lens to zoom in and out
on objects around you. When you’re finished recording a clip in real time,
click the Stop Capturing button (which replaces the Start Capturing button 
as soon as you click it). 
When you finish recording live video clips, click the Done button. As with
SmartScan Capture and Manual Capture with previously recorded video, the
program displays the Files Successfully Captured alert dialog box followed by
240
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs

the final Capture task pane that contains the next activity option buttons
(Media Manager, DVD Builder, PhotoSuite 7, VideoWave 7, Capture More, or
Finished Capturing) that you can select before clicking its Done button).
Acquiring Audio Files
Capture enables you not only to import images (both still and video) for use
in other Easy Media Creator projects but your audio as well. When using
Capture to import audio, you have a choice between recording the audio live,
that is, capturing it in real time as the audio is playing or copying audio tracks
from a pre-recorded audio CD.
To acquire live audio, you click the Audio Capture Device link in the Detected
Devices pane of the initial Capture window. This audio-capture device can be
your computer’s built-in microphone or some analog audio device such as an
amplifier with a record player playing an LP or audio cassette connected to
your computer’s line-in connection (see Chapter 5 for details).
To acquire audio tracks from a CD, you click the Audio CD link in the Detected
Devices pane of the initial Capture window. This audio CD can be one that
you’ve purchased or one that you’ve burned with the Easy Media Creator’s
Creator Classic program (see Chapter 8).
Capturing live audio
To record an audio file with Capture, connect the external analog audio device
to your computer (usually through its external microphone jack). Turn on the
analog audio device and cue up the LP record or audio cassette you want to
record. Then launch Capture and click the Audio Capture Device link in the
Detected Devices pane of the initial Capture window.
Capture then opens a Capture window similar to the one shown in Figure 9-9.
This window is divided into a Capture from Audio Capture Device pane on
the left side and a Contents Of pane that displays the contents of the media
collection that is currently selected.
In the Capture from Audio Capture Device pane, you can select a new folder
in which to save the audio file you’re about to record. To do this, click the
Browse Folders button beneath the Capture Files To heading and then click
the desired folder name. You can also select a group name for the audio files
in Name of Group Files text box, associate the files with a particular media
collection with the Browse Collections button beneath the Add Files to
Collection heading, and choose the recording quality in the Select a
Recording Quality drop-down list box.
241
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

When it comes to selecting the recording quality in this drop-down list box,
you can choose among the following three options:
 CD Quality (the default) that produces a WAV audio file of the highest
quality and the largest size
 Radio Quality that produces a WAV audio file of the medium quality and
average size
 Telephone Quality that produces a WAV audio file of the lowest quality
and smallest size
After selecting the desired recording settings in the Capture from Audio
Capture Device pane, you’re ready to record the live audio by following these
steps:
1. If the source of the audio is an analog playback device, cue up the
track on that device.
For example, if you’re about to record a track on the audio cassette, 
you need to find the silence right before the track on the tape. If you’re
recording live audio with a microphone connected to your computer,
you need to make sure that the mike is on and positioned correctly for
recording the sound.
2. Click the Record button at the bottom of the Capture from Audio
Device pane in the Capture window.
Figure 9-9:
Selecting
the

242
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs

Right after you click the Record button, you need to start the playback
of the analog recording that you’re saving. If you’re recording live audio
through a microphone, you don’t perform Step 2 until the live audio you
want to record starts playing.
3. If the source of the audio is an analog playback device, start playing
the recording that you want to capture with that device.
As Capture records the live audio, its recording light blinks red and gray
and the Recorded Length indicator keeps you informed of how long the
program has been recording.
4. When the audio source stops playing, click the Stop button (which
replaces the Record button as soon as you click it).
As soon as you click the Stop button, Capture adds a WAV audio file using 
the Group Filename and the next available sequential number (starting with
00000 as in Captured Sounds 00000.wav, Captured Sounds 00001.wav, and so
on). The program saves the WAV audio file in the folder that you selected
with the Browse Files button and associates it with the media collection that
you selected with the Browse Collections button.
After clicking the Stop button, you can then immediately start recording
another live recording with Capture simply by clicking the Record button
again. When you’re finished recording with Capture, click the Next > button 
at the bottom of the Capture from Audio Device pane.
The Capture program then displays the final Capture task pane that contains
the next activity option buttons (Media Manager, DVD Builder, PhotoSuite 7,
VideoWave 7, Capture More, or Finished Capturing) that you can select before
clicking its Done button.
Remember that you can edit the WAV files that you record in Capture with
Easy Media Creator’s Sound Editor tool where you can use its many features
to enhance the raw audio that you’ve captured (see Chapter 5 for details).
Copying tracks from an audio CD
To copy tracks from an audio CD, place the CD in your computer’s CD or DVD
drive and then click the Audio CD link in the Detected Devices pane of the ini-
tial Capture window.
Capture then opens a Capture window similar to the one shown in Figure 9-10.
This window is divided into a Capture from Audio CD pane on the left side
and a Contents Of pane on the right side showing the contents of the media
collection that is currently selected.
243
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

In the Capture from Audio CD pane, you can select a new folder in which to
save the tracks you’re about to record with the Browse Folders button beneath
the Capture Files To heading. You can also associate the audio tracks with a
particular media collection with the Browse Collections button beneath the
Add Files to Collection heading, and specify the name of a subfolder in which
the tracks are stored in the Create a Subfolder and Subcollection for the Copied
Tracks text box. Note that if you don’t specify your own subfolder name,
Capture automatically creates a composite name for this folder and new collec-
tion that is composed of Copied Tracks followed by the current date and time
(when you opened the Capture from Audio CD pane) as in Copied Tracks
[2004-3-17] [09_50am].
The Capture from Audio CD pane also contains a Select Tracks list box that
contains a listing of all the tracks on the audio CD (indicated by track number
only as in Track 1, Track 2, and the like). If you want Capture to replace the
track numbers with the appropriate track names, click the Get Disc Information
button immediately beneath the Select Tracks list box. Capture then connects
to the Gracenote CDDB Web site from which it attempts to obtain the track
information. If the program finds this information online, Capture then replaces
the track numbers in the Select Tracks list box with their corresponding names
and playing time.
If you want to listen to a particular track on the CD before selecting it for
copying in the Select Tracks list box, click its track number or name in this
list box. Then, click the triangular Play button in the playback controls that
Figure 9-10:
Specifying
the settings
for copying
tracks from
an audio 
CD with
Capture.
244
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs

appear at the bottom of the Select Tracks list box (these controls only appear
when one track is selected in this list box). When you finish listening to the
track, click the square Stop button in the playback controls (which replaces
the Play button as soon as you click it).
To select only certain tracks from the list in the Select Tracks list box, hold
down the Ctrl key as you click it. To select all the tracks in the list, click the
first one at the top of the box; then drag the scroll button down and hold
down the Shift key as you click the final track.
Once you’ve selected the tracks that you want Capture to copy to your hard
disk in the Select Tracks list box, click the Copy Tracks button at the bottom
of the Capture from Audio CD pane. Capture displays the Copying Audio
Tracks dialog box that shows you the progress of the track copying. When
Capture finishes copying the selected tracks, this dialog box disappears and
thumbnails of the copied track(s) appear in the Contents Of pane that now
shows the contents of the subfolder (and new collection) that was created as
part of the copy process.
If you’re finished copying tracks from the CD, you can replace it with another
and continue copying in Capture from Audio CD pane or, if you’re done, you
can click the Next > button. The program then displays the final Capture task
pane that contains the next activity option buttons (Media Manager, DVD
Builder, PhotoSuite 7, VideoWave 7, Capture More, or Finished Capturing)
that you can select before clicking its Done button.
Use Sound Editor to convert the audio CD tracks that you’ve just copied to
your hard disk in the WAV audio file format to MP3 files if you want to be able
to download them onto your portable MP3 player or add them to a playlist
on an MP3 disc that you create with Creator Classic (see Chapter 8). To do
this, you open the WAV file form of the track in Sound Editor and then choose
its File➪Save command. Then click the MPEG Layer 3 (*.mp3) item in the
Save as Type drop-down list box before you click the Save button in the Save
dialog box.
Copying DVD Movie Titles
If you’ve created DVD discs with the Easy Media Creator’s VideoWave or DVD
Builder applications, you can use Capture to copy particular movie titles
from the disc to your computer’s hard disk (note that you can’t use Capture
to copy movie titles from professionally recorded DVDs that you rent or pur-
chase, as these discs are encrypted).
To copy movie titles from a DVD disc that you’ve prepared, you follow these
steps:
245
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

1. Place the DVD disc that contains the movie titles you want to copy to
your hard disk in your computer’s DVD drive.
Now you’re ready to launch the Capture tool.
2. Launch Capture and then click the link with the volume name of your
DVD disc in the Detected Devices pane of the initial Capture window.
A new Capture window appears with a Capture From pane (followed by
the name of the disc) on the left and a The Titles Of pane (followed by the
name of the disc) on the right. This pane displays thumbnails of all the
movie titles on your DVD disc. By default, all the thumbnails are selected
so that all the movie titles on the DVD disc are copied.
3. (Optional) If you don’t want all the movie titles copied, click the
Deselect All Titles button in Capture From pane and then hold down
the Ctrl key as you click the individual thumbnails of all the titles you
do want to copy.
Now you’re ready to copy the selected movie titles.
4. Click the Next > button at the bottom of the Capture From pane.
A Capture window with a new Capture From pane and Contents Of pane
appears. In the Capture From pane, you can specify a different folder that is
to contain the copied movie titles with the Browse Folders button (Capture
uses your My Videos folder by default), change the group name for the
copied files in the Name of Group Files text box (Captures uses Captured
Media followed by the next available sequential number starting with
00000 by default), or select a different media collection with which to
associate the copied movie titles with the Browse Collections button.
5. (Optional) Make any necessary changes to the destination folder, the
group filename, and/or the media collection settings in the Capture
From pane.
Now you’re ready to have Capture copy the selected movie titles to your
hard disk.
6. Click the Copy> button at the bottom of the Capture From pane to
begin copying the selected movie titles.
Captures displays the DVD Copy dialog box that keeps you informed 
of the progress in copying the selected movie titles. When Capture fin-
ishes making the copies, the DVD Copy dialog box closes and the Files
Successfully Captured alert dialog box appears.
7. Click the OK button in the Files Successfully Captured dialog box to
close it.
In the Contents Of pane of the Capture window on the right, thumbnails
of the copied movie titles with the group filename and the next available
sequential number appear (and the .mpg for MPEG filename extension). 
246
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs

The Capture pane on the left contains the activity option buttons: Media
Manager, DVD Builder, PhotoSuite 7, VideoWave 7, Capture More, or
Finished Capturing. You can select one of these before you click the
Done button.
8. Click the option button of application you want to launch next or click
the Capture More button (if you want to do more copying) or the
Finished Capturing button (if you’re done capturing) before you click
the Done button at the bottom of the Capture From pane.
Moving and Copying Files 
to New Collections
As discussed in Chapter 4, media collections enable you to associate different
types of media with one another even when the files are physically stored
across different folders and on different drives spread out over your computer
system. The Capture program heavily encourages the use of media collections
when capturing the different types of media files it supports (photos, audio
files, video clips, and movie titles) by including collections as part of the
Capture program’s setup for each media type.
Sometimes after using Capture to copy a particular type of media files, you
may decide that you want to move the files you’ve captured and associated
with one collection to another, better-suited collection. You may also decide
that you want to copy files from the collection to which you originally added
the files during the capture process to an additional collection file which also
needs to make use of the same media.
In these cases, you need to return to the Easy Media Creator Home window
after you finish with Capture and click its Media Manager link at the very top
of the Tools column. Then, when the Media Manager window opens, you
need to follow these general steps for moving or copying media files already
apart from one collection to another:
1. Click the Organize Your Collections button (the one on the end of the
toolbar immediately above Folders pane on the left side of the Media
Manager window).
Media Manager splits the window into four panes.
2. Click the name of the collection that contains the media files that you
want to move or copy to another collection in the Collections pane in
the upper-left of the Media Manager.
Thumbnails of all the media files added to the collection you select
appear in the upper Media Manager Contents pane on the right.
247
Chapter 9: Acquiring Digital Media

3. Click the name of the collection into which you want to move or 
copy the media files from the upper Contents pane in the lower
Collections pane.
Media Manager now displays the contents of the collection you selected
as the destination collection in the lower Contents pane.
4. Select all the media files you want to move or copy in the upper
Contents pane.
Remember that you can Click, Shift+Click to select a series of thumbnails
(click the first one in the series and then Shift+Click the last one to
select all of them in between) or Ctrl+Click to select multiple, individual
thumbnails.
Now you’re ready either to move or copy the selected media files in the
collection displayed in the upper Contents pane to the collection dis-
played in lower Contents pane. To move the files from the upper to lower
pane, you click the Move Selected Collection Item(s) Above to Collection
Below button (the one with downward-pointing arrow to the left of the
word Move). 
To copy the files from the upper to lower pane, you click the Copy
Selected Collection Item(s) Above to Collection Below button (the one
with downward-pointing arrow to the left of the word Copy) instead.
5. Click the Move Selected Collection Item(s) Above to Collection Below
button to move the selected media files. Otherwise, click the Copy
Selected Collection Item(s) Above to Collection Below button to 
copy them.
After you finish moving or copying the selected media files, you can return
the Media Manager window to its normal Folders view by clicking the Browse
Folders button (the first one on the left on the toolbar right below the Media
Manager menu bar) or to a single Collections view by clicking the Browse
Collections button (the second from the left on the same toolbar).
Keep in mind that moving and copying media files to different collections in
the Media Manager when the Organize Your Collections button is selected is
a two-way street. Although the preceding steps outline how to move or copy
files from the source collection in the upper Contents pane to a destination in
the lower Contents pane, you can just as well reverse this process, making
the collection displayed in the lower Contents pane the source and the col-
lection displayed in the upper Contents pane the destination.
To do this, make sure no media files are selected in the upper Contents pane
(you can do this by clicking anywhere in the upper pane in the space between
the media files thumbnails) and then select the media files that you want to
move or copy in the lower Contents pane. To move the selected media files
248
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs

from the collection in the lower Contents pane to the one in the upper pane,
click Move Selected Collection Item(s) Below to Collection Above button (the
one with upward-pointing arrow to the immediate right of the word Move). To
copy the selected media files from the collection in the lower Contents pane
to the one in the upper pane instead, click Copy Selected Collection Item(s)
Below to Collection Above button (the one with upward-pointing arrow to the
immediate right of the word Copy).

V
ideoWave is a powerful video editing program which enables you to
quickly assemble your digital video clips, audio tracks, and photo
images (which you can capture with the Easy Media Creator Capture utility
as described in Chapter 10) into professional-looking finished video produc-
tions. You can then output the finished VideoWave video productions into a
variety of file formats or burn the video on a DVD disc for distribution to your
friends and family. You can also use your VideoWave video productions as
movie titles in the next DVD project that you create with Easy Media Creator’s
DVD Builder application (see Chapter 13).
This chapter covers all the major aspects of using VideoWave to create a
wide variety of video productions. It begins by familiarizing you with the fea-
tures and components of the VideoWave window, and then goes on to intro-
duce you the use of the program’s new CineMagic component, a nifty little
feature for turning your favorite video clips into instant music videos using
music of your own choice. Next, the chapter covers the use of VideoWave’s
new StoryBuilder component, a Wizard-like feature that enables you to create
thematic videos which play your video clips as part of pre-designed themes
that include ready-made graphic backdrops and stock background music. 
If CineMagic and StoryBuilder aren’t enough for your video needs, the chapter
then introduces you to the use of VideoWave’s full-featured Production Editor.
Here, you discover how to edit your videos in both the standard storyline and

the more advanced timeline view. As part of this process, you also find out
how to add audio to your video and apply any of a variety of scene transitions
and special video effects. 
The chapter concludes with information on your options for outputting your
final video productions into a variety of different formats. These include for-
mats for playback on your computer with programs like Windows Media
Player, playback on your TV or camcorder, as well as for uploading to the
Web or e-mailing to your friends and family. You also find out how to burn
your final video productions to DVD disc for playback on your computer’s
DVD drive and standalone DVD players.
Getting Cozy with VideoWave
You can launch VideoWave from the Easy Media Creator Home window either
by clicking the Edit Video link in the Video column in the row at the top or
clicking the VideoWave link in the Applications column in the middle of the
window. If Easy Media Creator isn’t running, you can also launch VideoWave
from the Windows taskbar by clicking the Start button, then highlighting All
Programs on the Start menu and Roxio on the All Programs submenu before
you click VideoWave on the Roxio submenu.
When you first launch VideoWave, a VideoWave 7 – Production Window
appears. This window is divided into three panes: 
 Production Preview pane in the upper left where you can preview 
the video clips, transitions, and special effects you add to your video
production
 Media Selector pane in the upper right where you can select the folder
or media collection that contains the video, audio, or still images you
want to add to your video production
 Production Editor pane in Storyline view in the lower third of the Video-
Wave window where you can add and edit video clips, background 
audio or narration, scene transitions, and special effects for your video
production
The Production Preview pane
The Production Preview pane enables you to review your video at any stage
as you build and edit its content. As you see in Figure 10-1, beneath the pre-
view display, this pane shows the time code of your current position in the
video review as well as that of the very last frame. By checking out the time
code of the last frame (which gives you the hours, minutes, seconds, and
tenths of a second), you can immediately tell how long the video is.
252
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Beneath the current and ending time code, this pane displays the playback
buttons and controls that you find on your standard DVD controller. To
advance to the first frame of the video, you click the Go to Start button. To
then play the video, you click the Play button (which immediately changes 
to a Pause button). 
To advance through the video quickly to find a particular frame to review,
you click the Fast Forward button. So too, if you want to go back through the
video to find an earlier frame, you click the Rewind button. If you’re review-
ing a really long video and you want to increase the fast forward or rewind
speed, you simply click the Fast Forward or Rewind button again.
To manually advance forward or backward in the video to find a particular
frame, you drag the Scrubber button right or left along the bottom of the
Production Preview pane. If you want to move forward or backward through
the frames in equal increments to find a specific place, drag the Jog Wheel
control to the right or left instead.
Keep in mind that the Production Preview pane is only for reviewing the video
that you’re building in the Production Editor. You can’t use this pane to review
the video clips or previously made videos in the Media Selector pane that you
might possibly want to add to the current video production. (For information
on how to preview the video clips and movies displayed in the Media Selector
pane, see “Previewing video in the Media Selector pane” later in this chapter.)

The Media Selector pane
The Media Selector pane enables you to locate the different types of digital
media files (video, audio, and still graphic images such as photos) that you
might want to use in your final video production. This pane can display the
contents of any of the folders on your computer system or any of the media
collection files that you’ve created (see Chapter 4 for details).
Figure 10-2 shows you the Media Selector – Folders pane (the default) after
choosing the My Videos folder that resides in the Windows’ My Documents
folder in Navigation Tree displayed on the Select Folder drop-down list. To
switch the Media Selector to Collections, click the Browse Collections on the
left side of the toolbar at the bottom of the Media Selector pane. To switch
back to Folders (the default view), you click the Browse Folders on Your
Computer button at the very beginning of this lower toolbar.
Previewing video files displayed in the Media Selector pane
Video clips and finished movie files displayed in the Media Selector pane
can’t be played in the Production Preview pane. To preview these video files
before you add them to your video production, you can either click the video

file’s thumbnail(s) and then click the Preview Selected Item(s) button on
Media Selector’s toolbar or you can click the Play button in the lower-right
corner of each video clip’s or movie’s thumbnail.
When you click the Preview Selected Item(s) button to play selected thumb-
nails, VideoWave opens a separate Preview Window where the selected video
plays (similar to the one shown in Figure 10-3). This window appears in the
middle of the VideoWave screen. At the bottom of this window, you find a
Pause button (that changes to a Play button when you click it) and a Stop
button that you can use to start and stop the video playback. Immediately
following the Pause and Stop buttons, you find the time code for your current
position in the video that’s playing along with the time code for the video’s
duration (indicating the total length of the video clip or finished movie). 
If you select more multiple video file thumbnails before you click Preview
Selected Item(s) button, this Preview window contains a Previous and a Back
button that you can use to advance to the next selected video or return to
the previous one. Immediately below the Preview window’s display, you find
a horizontal scroll bar that you can use to move back and forth through the
frames of the video without playing it. Drag the scroll button to move back
and forth to particular key frames in the video file. Click the left or right
scroll-arrow button to scrub through the video (like you do with Scrubber
button in the Production Preview pane).
If you click the tiny Play button that appears in the lower-right of a particular
video file’s thumbnail image, VideoWave then plays the file’s video in place in
the Media Selector pane, that is, at the very same size and position as its
original thumbnail image. As soon as VideoWave starts playing the video, a
Pause button and a progress indicator appears below the thumbnail video

display. You can click the Pause to pause the playback of the video at any
time. When you’re finished previewing the video, click anywhere outside of
the thumbnail video display to remove the video’s Pause button and progress
indicator, returning the file’s thumbnail to its original still image.
Controlling how folders and files are displayed in Media Selector pane 
After you open the folder or collection in the Media Selector pane that con-
tains the media files you’re potentially interested in using in your new video,
you can then use the buttons on the right half of the toolbar at the top of the
Media Selector pane to modify how its folders and files are displayed.
You can click the Increase Thumbnail Size button to make the thumbnail
images larger so that you can make out more detail on each (although fewer
images will then be displayed at one time in the Media Selector pane). You can
also click the Decrease Thumbnail Size button to make the thumbnail images
smaller so that more images can be displayed at one time in this pane.
By default, the Media Selector pane shows all types of media files contained
within the current folder or collection that you have open in the pane. To make
the file list more manageable, you can use the Show Media Types button to
control which types of files are displayed. To filter all but a particular media file
type in the open folder or collection, click the Show Media Types button and
then click the type of file (Video, Photo, or Audio) that you do want displayed
on the button’s pop-up menu.
To further help you locate the media files you want to work with, you can click
the View As button and click the Details or List item on the button’s pop-up
menu (the default View As setting is Thumbnails, which displays only the file-
name below each file’s thumbnail image). When you click the Details item on
the View As pop-up menu, VideoWave then displays the file information in
columns that include the File Name (with a really small thumbnail image), File
Size, Date Created, Date Modified, and Attributes. When you click the List item
on the View As pop-up menu, VideoWave displays the file information in the
Media Selector pane as a simple, multi-columnar list that displays only the file-
name following the file’s thumbnail image.
In addition to modifying how folders and file attributes are displayed in the
Media Selector pane, you can also can modify the order in which they are dis-
played in this pane by clicking the Sort By button. By default, VideoWave 
displays the folders and files by name. If you prefer to see the folder and files
arranged in another order, you can have VideoWave reorder the contents of
the Media Selector pane by selecting a new attribute on which to sort (Date
Created, Date Modified, or Size) in the Sort By pop-up menu.
When you view the contents of the Media Selector pane in Detail view (by
selecting Details on the View As button’s pop-up menu), you can have Video-
Wave resort the folder and files list simply by clicking the column heading at the
top of the pane. Click the column heading (such as File Size) once to have the
list sorted by that column in ascending order (from A to Z alphabetically and
256
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

smaller to larger numerically). Click the same column heading a second time to
have VideoWave sort the list on that column this time in descending order (from
Z to A alphabetically and larger to smaller numerically).
Editing the video files in Media Selector pane
The Tools button, the very last one at the far right of the Media Selector tool-
bar, contains a pop-up menu full of options that you can use to perform a
variety of important edits on the media files in the Media Selector pane (you
can also display these options on a shortcut menu by right-clicking a particu-
lar media file’s thumbnail in the Media Selector pane). 
The options on the Tools pop-up menu include common ones associated with
file editing, including an option for previewing the file, adding the file to collec-
tion automatically created for the current video production, cutting, copying
and pasting the file to the Windows Clipboard as well as deleting and renaming
the file. In addition to these general editing options, you also find the following
options that are targeted specifically to the video files found in the Media
Selector pane:
 Scene Detect to have VideoWave use the video’s time code to find and
mark individual scenes in the video 
 Extract Image to open the Extract Image dialog box where you can pre-
view the video until you find the frame you want to save as still photo in
any of the graphic file formats (such as BMP, JPG, or PNG) that Easy
Media Creator supports
 Extract Audio to have VideoWave save the audio track in the video in a
separate WAV audio file
 Export to TV to open VideoWave’s Output to TV/VCR window where you
can you can play the video file on your TV or save it on video cassette on
your VCR (assuming that these devices are connected to your computer)
 Export to Internet to open VideoWave’s Output to Internet window
where you can upload the video to a particular Web page (note that 
this option is only available for movies that you’ve already output to the
Internet by saving it as a compressed WMV file — see “Outputting the
Video Production” later in this chapter for details)
 Export to DV Recorder to open VideoWave’s Output to DV Camcorder
window where you can transfer your finished movie to playback on your
digital camcorder for playback (assuming that the camcorder’s connected
to your computer with an IEEE 1394 FireWire cable and that the recorder
is set to its VCR/VTR mode).
The final option on the Tools pop-up menu is the Properties option. Click this
option to open a Properties dialog box with a General and a Details tab that
give you file statistics and specific file information appropriate to its particular
type of media file (video, audio, or photo).
257
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

Use the Extract Image option on the Tools menu to pull out still images from
the key frames in your videos that you want to save as individual photos. You
can then edit your extracted photos with PhotoSuite’s many features (see
Chapter 6) as you would any other of your digital photos. Extracted photos
can make wonderful introductory screens to the video portion of your digital
movies, especially when you use PhotoSuite’s Add or Edit Text feature to
annotate them with general information about the movie or with the movie’s
credits (see Chapter 11 for more ideas on designing DVD movies with DVD
Builder).
The Production Editor pane
The Production Editor pane is the area where all the VideoWave designing
action takes place. This is the spot where you add and sequence the video
clips, audio track, still photos and other graphics that you want played in
your finished movie production. When designing and sequencing a movie in
the Production Editor pane, you can work in one of two modes: 
 Storyline mode (the default) which presents the movie in storyboard
fashion by showing the sequence of video clips and still images that you
add to the movie in the order in which they play, along with all the scene
transitions you add to take you from one video or still image to another
(see “Working in Storyline mode” later in this chapter for details)
 Timeline mode which presents the movie as individual video, audio,
effects, text, and overlay tracks along a time line that indicates when
particular elements on each track play in the movie (see “Working in
Timeline mode” later in this chapter for details)
Most of the time, you want to construct the basic elements for your new movie
in Storyline mode, including the video clips, still images, and the transitions
you want between them. Then, if you add background audio or narration, or
any text, overlays, and special effects to your production, you will want to
switch over to Timeline mode so that you can check up and adjust their timing
in relation to the movie’s video.
Instant Music Videos with CineMagic
CineMagic is a nifty new feature of VideoWave 7 for creating instant music
videos, that is, videos that have no other sound than the music track that 
you choose to play (the wizard automatically suppresses the audio track
recorded by your camcorder). One way of thinking about CineMagic music
videos is to consider the music as setting the right mood and enhancing the
action contained in the video. The only caveat when using CineMagic to
create a new music video is that the length of the video clip that you select
258
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

has to be at least twice as long as the length of the song track that you select
to accompany it. In other words, if the song you want to use is 2:22 (two
minute, twenty-two seconds) long, your video clip needs to be at the very
least 4:44 (four minutes, forty-four seconds) long.
The best way to understand how easy it is to create a new music video with
CineMagic is to follow along with the steps for creating one. For this example,
I’m creating a music video using vacation video of my recent boat trip down
the Yang-tze River in central China with the music provided by Vivaldi’s
Fantasmi from his Concerto No. 2 in G Minor.
To begin the new CineMagic music video production, I begin by launching 
the Easy Media Creator Home window and then clicking its Auto Edit with
CineMagic link in the Video column (you can also launch it from within
VideoWave by choosing File➪New CineMagic Production on the VideoWave
menu bar). The initial CineMagic window opens similar to the one shown in
Figure 10-4. This window is divided into panes: the pane on the left with the
instructions for creating a new video that keeps you informed of what step
you’re completing, the pane in the middle with the Production Preview display
and the controls that you use in defining elements for the video and the pane
on the right with the Media Selector which you use to select the video clips
and audio track that you want your new music video to play.
Figure 10-4:

259
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

To use the CineMagic wizard to create a new music video, follow these steps:
1. Click the Name for Your New Production text box and then replace
the temporary CineMagic1 name with one of your own.
Next, you may want to select a new folder into which you save the new
video (by default VideoWave saves all videos in the My Videos folder in
the My Documents folder on your hard disk).
2. If you want to save the video in a new folder, click the Browse button
and then select the new folder in Save Production As dialog box and
click the Save button before you click the Next > button at the bottom
of the CineMagic window.
In the second CineMagic window (similar to the one shown in Figure 10-5,
you select the video clips that you want to use in your video. Keep in
mind that you can add as many different video clips as you’d like to the
production (just make sure that all total they take at least twice as long to
play as your music selection) and that CineMagic will follow the general
order in which the video is played but that when it comes to ordering the
different scenes within each clip, CineMagic is completely in charge.
3. Select the folder or collection that contains the video files that you
want to add to the music video in Media Selector pane and then select
the their thumbnails and drag them to the Add Video list box below
the Production Preview display in the middle pane and then click the
Next > button.
As you add your various video clips, VideoWave keeps you informed of
the total video duration with the indicator below the Add Video list box.
Make sure that this duration is at least twice as long as that of the music
you’re about to select in the next step (you should check the length of
the music track you intend to use in a program such as the Windows
Media Player before you launch the CineMagic wizard).
In the third CineMagic window (similar to the one shown in Figure 10-6),
you select the audio track that you want the new video to play in the Media
Selector pane and then drag it to the Audio text box in the middle pane.
4. Select the folder or collection that contains the video files that you
want to add to the music video in Media Selector pane; then select the
their thumbnails and drag them to the Add Video list box below the
Production Preview display in the middle pane. Click Next >.
VideoWave displays the duration of the audio track you select above the
duration of your video clip(s): remember that the video duration must
be at least twice that of the audio or you will get an error message when
you click the Next > button and then have to retrace your steps by rese-
lecting the audio or selecting few or different video clips.
The fourth CineMagic window is where you select a style for your new
music video. Each style uses slightly different cuts, transitions, and
backgrounds. In deciding which style to select, click the name in the
260
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Video Style list box and then read the description of that style beneath
the list box. For my Yang-tze Fantasy music video, I selected the Fun and
Fast style described as being “fast paced with cuts timed to the music.”
Keep in mind that all these CineMagic styles scramble the order of the
scenes in your original video a little differently.
5. Click the name of the style of music video you want to create in the
Video Styles list box and then click the Next> button.
The CineMagic wizard begins processing your music video by analyzing
your video and audio selections and then generating the production.
When the wizard finishes processing the music video, the Edit Production
and Output To options appear in middle pane and the Play button in the
playback controls beneath the Production Preview display becomes
active. You can then preview the finished video (see Figure 10-7), save it 
to disk by clicking the Finish button (because the Output To option is
automatically selected), or you can edit the video in VideoWave using the
Production Editor (see “Video Editing with the Production Editor” later in
this chapter) by clicking the Edit Production option before you click the
Finish button.
6. Click the Play button to preview the music video and then click the
Finish button save the production.
When you click Finish when the Output To option is selected, the Video-
Wave Output To window opens. Here, you select the destination for your
finished video: Video File for playback on your computer, Internet for
uploading your movie to a Web site, TV/VCR for playback on your TV,
VCR, or analog camcorder, DV Camcorder for playback on your digital
camcorder, or E-mail to send the movie as an attachment to an e-mail
message.
7. Click the appropriate destination option in the Select Destination list
box and then click the Next > button.
The options that appear in the Output To window when you click the
Next > button depend upon which destination option you select. For
some destinations, you must select a purpose and video quality for your
finished movie. For others, you select the file type and video quality.
(When you select DV Camcorder as the destination, you are taken right
to the step for designating the filename in Step 9).
8. Select the purpose, quality, and file type associated with your destina-
tion in the appropriate drop-down list boxes and then click the Next >
button.
In the next Output To window, VideoWave lets you modify the name you
give the finished movie and where it’s saved on your computer. By default,
VideoWave gives the new movie file the same name as you gave to the
video production and saves it in the My Videos folder in My Documents
on your hard disk.
261
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

9. If you want, modify the movie’s file name in the Choose a File Name
for the Finished Movie text box and select a new folder in which to
save the file in the Save Movie As dialog box (opened by clicking the
Browse button). Then click Next >.
10. Click the Render File button.
As VideoWave renders the frames in the new movie, it previews them in
the Production Preview pane while showing you the overall progress 
in the Completed indicator below. When VideoWave finishes rendering
the entire movie, the View Movie button appears in the window along
with Video Complete message and you can preview the movie by click-
ing the View Movie button.
11. Click the View Movie button beneath the Production Preview pane to
see and hear your finished music video masterpiece.
The finished music video plays in its own Preview window in the middle of
your computer screen. Click the Pause to temporarily pause the movie’s
playback. Click the Stop button to stop the playback and rewind the movie
to the start. Use the scroll bar arrow buttons or scroll button to scrub
through the video or select a new place from which to start the playback.
When you finish previewing the music video, click its Close button to get
rid of the preview window.
12. Click the Close button in the Preview window to close it and then
click the Finish button in the Output To button to close it.

Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

When you close the Output To window, the normal VideoWave window
appears. This window contains your new video production displayed in the
Timeline view. You can then do further editing to the video production (see
“Video Editing with the Production Editor” later in this chapter) or use
VideoWave’s Output Your Production in Different Forms or File➪Output
Production To command to save your music video in another file suited 
for playback on a different device or from a different destination (see
“Outputting the Video Production” later in this chapter for details).
Instant Themed Videos with StoryBuilder
VideoWave’s new StoryBuilder wizard makes it fun and easy to create movies
that use pre-designed themes and templates. Unlike when creating a music
video with the program’s CineMagic wizard where you have to pair video
clips with your own music track, when creating a movie with StoryBuilder,
you have only to select a video category and template to use before you
select the video clips to play and you’re done (the only other thing you can
possibly do is edit the introductory and end text that the template uses in
the first and last frames of the movie and this step is purely optional).
To get an idea of how easy it is to create a themed video with StoryBuilder,
follow along with the steps I used to create a video of my youngest dog’s first
birthday, which, of course, makes use of StoryBuilder’s readymade birthday
template.
To begin the new StoryBuilder video production, I begin by launching the
Easy Media Creator Home window and then clicking its Guided Edit with
StoryBuilder link in the Video column (you can also launch it from within
VideoWave by choosing File➪New Storybuilder Production on the VideoWave
menu bar). The initial StoryBuilder window opens similarly to the one shown
in Figure 10-8 . This window is divided into panes: the pane on the left con-
tains instructions for creating a new video that keeps you informed of what
step you’re completing; the pane in the middle has the Production Preview
display and the controls that you use in defining elements for your movie; the
pane on the right includes the Media Selector which you use to select the
video clips that you want to add to your new movie.
264
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

To use the StoryBuilder wizard to create a themed video, follow these steps:
1. Click the Name for Your New Production text box and then replace
the temporary StoryBuilder1 name with one of your own.
You may want to select a new folder into which you save the new video
(by default VideoWave saves all videos in the My Videos folder in the My
Documents folder on your hard disk).
2. If you want to save the video in a new folder, click the Browse button
and then select the new folder in Save Production As dialog box and
click the Save button before you click the Next > button at the bottom
of the StoryBuilder window.
In the second StoryBuilder window, you select the category of your
video. StoryBuilder lets you choose Birthday, Contemporary Concepts,
Holidays, Moments in Time, Sports, or Travel as the video’s category. Of
course, for this example, I chose Birthday at the very top of the Select a
Category list box as the category for my new video production.
3. Click the most appropriate category for your new video production in
the Select a Category list box and then click the Next > button.
Figure 10-8:
Selecting
the name for
the new

window.
265
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

Each video category has different templates with their own backgrounds
and transitions associated with it. In the third StoryBuilder window, 
you select the template that you want to use. For my particular video, I
selected first template thumbnail called Balloons in the Select a Template
list box.
If you can’t find a template that you want to use for the category you’ve
selected, click the < Back button and then select a different category 
in the Select a Category list box before you click the Next > button to
return to the window with the Select a Template list box.
4. Click the thumbnail of the template you want to use in the Select a
Template list box and then click the Next > button.
The fourth StoryBuilder window shows you the text that the template
that you’ve selected uses as an introduction in the first few frames of the
finished video (in the case of the Balloons template, this introductory
text is Happy Birthday!). You can, if you want, edit this default text in 
the Enter the Text to Appear for the Introduction list box. You can also
select a new font size for the text from the Font Size drop-down list box
and change the default center justification to left- or right-aligned on the
movie display. 
To preview any changes that you make to the introductory text or just to
see the introduction for the particular template you’ve selected, click
the Play button in the controls that appear beneath the Production
Preview display before you click the Next > button to display the fifth
StoryBuilder window.
5. (Optional) Edit the introductory text in the Enter the Text to Appear
for the Introduction list box, its font size in the Font Size drop-down
list box, and/or click a new Justification option button (Left or Right)
and then click the Next > button.
In the fifth StoryBuilder window (similar to the one shown in Figure 10-9),
you select all video clips that you want in new your video production.
Select the folder or collection that contains the video clips to be added to
the movie in the Media Selector pane. Then drag the thumbnails of each
video clip you want to add from the Media Selector to the Drag Clips To
list box. 
After you add the clips, you can do any of the following things to them:
• To preview how the video clips you’ve added will play in the final
movie, click the Play button in the controls beneath the Production
Preview pane. To shorten a particular clip by trimming its start
and/or end point, select it in the Drag Clips To list box and then
click the Adjust the Duration of the Selected Item button (the one
with the alarm clock). VideoWave opens a Video Trimmer dialog
box similar to the one shown in Figure 10-10. Drag the Start Jog
Wheel until you come to the frame at which you want the clip to
begin and then click the Set the Start Point at the Current Position
button. Next, drag the End Jog Wheel to the frame on which the
266
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

clip is to end and then click the Set the End Point at the Current
Position button before you click OK.
• To change the order in which the clips play, click the clip in the
Drag Clips To list whose play you want to promote so that is plays
earlier in the sequence and then click the Move Selected Item Up
button (the one with the green arrow pointing up) until it’s in its
proper position. To demote a clip so that it plays later in the
sequence, select it and then click the Move Selected Item Down
button (the one with the green arrow pointing down) until it’s
properly positioned. 
• To remove a video clip from the movie, click its thumbnail in the
Drag Clips To list box and then click the Remove the Selected Item
button (the one with the big red X). 
• To remove the background music from the final movie (some of it
is pretty chintzy), click the Play Background Music check box that
appears right below the Drag Clips To list box to remove its check-
mark before you click the Next > button. Note that if you don’t dis-
able the Play Background Music option and your video clips have
their own sound tracks (which almost all do), both the background
music and sound tracks will play against each other in the finished
production.
6. Open the folder or collection in the Media Selector pane that contains
the video clips you want to add and then drag their thumbnails to the
Drag Clips to List Box Below list box, then adjust their order and
length as needed before you click the Next > button.
In the sixth StoryBuilder builder, you have a chance to edit the text
that’s displayed in the last frames of the video. As with the introductory
text, you can edit this end text in the Enter the Text to Appear for the
Ending list box, change its font size in the Font Size drop-down list box,
and/or change its justification on the screen. To preview any changes
you make to the ending text, click the Play button in the playback con-
trols at the bottom of the Production Preview pane.
7. (Optional) Edit the ending text in the Enter the Text to Appear for the
Ending list box, its font size in the Font Size drop-down list box, and/
or click a new Justification option button (Left or Right) before you
click the Next > button.
The seventh and last StoryBuilder window appears. There, you can pre-
view the entire production and select between outputting it to a movie
file and editing it further in VideoWave’s Production Editor. 
When you click the Finish button and the default Output To option is
selected, VideoWave opens an Output To window with the same wizard
that you use in CineMagic. This wizard enables you to select the play-
back destination, video quality, movie filename and folder and to have
VideoWave render your finished movie (see Steps 7–12 in the previous
section, “Instant music videos with CineMagic” for details).
267

Video Editing in the Production Editor
As great as CineMagic and StoryBuilder are for quickly putting together finished
videos, by their very automation of common video tasks they can put a damper
on your own creativity. If you want to be free to make your own decisions when
it comes to what goes into a particular scene, how long a scene lasts, or what
transition to use when going on to the next scene, you need to be familiar and
comfortable using VideoWave’s Production Editor.
Fortunately, Roxio has made using the Production Editor to design your own
video movies as easy as pie. Both its Storyline and Timeline modes are intu-
itive and take very little getting used to make you feel like you’re ready to
video editing with the “big boys.”
Working in Storyline mode
Figure 10-11 shows the Production Editor pane in the VideoWave window as it
first opens in Storyline mode after adding some video clips and transitions. In
Storyline mode, individual scenes are represented by panels that are sequen-
tially numbered and arranged in rows (a kind of digital storyboarding). Each
scene panel can contain a particular photo, video clip, or color panel that
you add from the Media Selector pane to the Production Editor pane by drag-
ging it to its numbered panel square.

Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

In between each scene panel, you find a transition panel that you can use to
add a particular scene transition, determining how one scene leads into the
next. VideoWave gives you a choice among hundreds of different transitions,
the most widely used one being the Dissolve transition whereby the last frames
of the current scene literally dissolve into the first frames of the next scene
(the duration of the Dissolve transition being the determining factor in how
much information from the current scene remains visible as the beginning of
the next scene takes over). 
Note that you don’t have to add any transition between scene panels in your
video production, but keep in mind that if you don’t use add transitions, 
your finished movie will have a jumpy feel to it if it contains multiple video
clips and still images. This is because the moment one scene ends, the next
one abruptly starts up. Depending upon how different the visual information
at the end of one clip is from that of the beginning of the next, the effect can
be jarring to the eye and very disrupting to the flow of your story. Therefore,
I highly recommend the use of transitions to smooth the changeover from
one scene to the next, while at the same time, I caution against using a whole
bunch of different transitions in the same movie. Be careful with your transi-
tion selections because using a variety of different transitions to make scene
changes can be almost as distracting as using none.
The Storyline Playback Head keeps your place in the Production Editor as you
preview the video production using the playback controls at the bottom of the
Production Preview pane. As you review your video production, the Storyline
Playback Head moves through the scene and transition panels in the Production
Editor pane, keeping track of your present position in the current video clip, still
image, or transition as its images appear in the Production Preview pane above.
Note that you can’t move the Storyline Playback Head directly in the Production
Editor: to move it to a new place in this pane, you need to use the playback con-
trols in the Production Preview pane. For example, to find the place in the movie
where you want to start playing back the production, you drag the Scrubber
button or the Jog Wheel to advance to frame in the video production where you
want the playback to begin and then click the Play button to start the playback
from that position.
Note that when working on a video production in Storyline mode, you can
add audio, special effects, and overlays for the entire production simply by
dragging their thumbnails to Production Editor pane and then dropping them
anywhere on the Production Editor Background (just make sure that you
don’t drop the icon on a specific scene pane or the audio, special effect, or
overlay will apply only to that scene, not to the entire video production).
The different kinds of files you can add to your movie
Most of the movies that you’ll make with VideoWave will consist of video
clips that you’ve acquired with the Capture application (see Chapter 10 for
details). Some of the movies you make may also include the use of digital still
photos that you’ve acquired with the Capture program and then edited with
the PhotoSuite application (as described in Chapter 7). 
270
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

In addition to standard video clips and still photos, you may also want to add
color panels to the first and last scenes of the movie. These color panels, usu-
ally in black, enable you to transition from a black matt screen into the first
frames of the initial video clip and then from last frames of the final video clip
to another black matt (when you use the Dissolve transition between the final
video clip and the final black matt, in Hollywood lingo, your movie is said to
fade to black).
Note that you can also add finished movies created with VideoWave and
output to the MPG file format to scene panels in a new VideoWave video pro-
duction. When you add a finished movie to a panel, VideoWave then plays
that movie (with all of its scenes, transitions, audio, and so on) as soon as the
Storyline Playback Head reaches it during playback.
Don’t forget that you can use VideoWave to make a really effective slideshow
out of your digital photos. All you have to do is add your digital photos to the
sequential scene panels in the Production Editor pane in the order you want
them to appear in the slideshow, add the type of transition you want between
each photo, and then add any background audio or narration that you want
your audience to hear. 
Table 10-1 shows a list of all the files types that you can add to your video
production. Note that the graphic file formats supported include the BMP,
JPEG, and PNG graphics file formats. Bitmap graphics are most often used for
storing simple images such as Clip Art. The JPEG graphics format is most
often used for storing digital still photos as well as more complex graphic
images. The PNG graphics file format is mostly used for Web graphics (where
it’s attempting to replace the older, GIF (Graphics Information File) format.
The video and audio file formats supported by VideoWave include all the
major formats that you’re likely to run into. In terms of the video file formats,
the Easy Media Creator applications are only able to save its video produc-
tions in the MPEG2 and WMV compressed video formats. The Windows AVI
and MOV video files that you use in your VideoWave productions must be
produced in programs not part of the Easy Media Creator suite and then
imported into VideoWave.

In addition to the standard graphics, video, and audio file formats listed in
Table 10-1, VideoWave also lets you add Roxio project files created with the
PhotoSuite application and saved in its native file format to a new video pro-
duction. These project files carry the .dmsp filename extension. Note, how-
ever, that you cannot add VideoWave project files (that carry the .dmsm
filename extension) directly to a new VideoWave video production. Before
you can add movies that you create with VideoWave to new VideoWave video
productions, you must first output them and save them as MPG files (see
“Outputting the Video Production” later in this chapter for details).
Adding color panels and text to your movie
As stated earlier, you can add black color panels to the beginning and end of
your movies and then with the help of the Dissolve transition start the video
production by fading in from black and then end it by fading to black. Because
you can add text to your color panels, you can also use them to introduce new
scenes in the movie, to create general introductions to the movie as well as to
provide the credits for production (with you, of course, as the director).
You follow these two steps to create a new color panel in your video 
production:
1. Right-click the blank scene panel in the Production Editor pane where
the color panel is to appear and then click Insert Color Panel on the
shortcut menu.
The Color Picker dialog box appears where you select the color for the
new panel. If none of the pre-defined colors will do, click the Create
272
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Colors >> button to expand the Color Picker dialog box. Here, you can
create a new color by dragging through the Hues and Shades boxes,
clicking the Eyedropper mouse pointer on some color in the Production
Preview pane, or entering new values in the Hue, Saturation, and Values
or the Red, Green, and Blue text boxes.
2. Select the color for the new color panel in the Color Picker dialog box
and then click the OK button.
VideoWave inserts a panel in the color you selected in the Color Picker
in the scene panel you right-clicked.
After inserting a color panel in your video production, you can, if you want,
add text to the panel that explains the upcoming scene in the vein of those
old silent movies or gives your audience some important information about
the video clip that they’re about to witness. To add text to a color panel you
added, you follow these steps:
1. Click the scene panel in the Production Editor pane that contains the
color panel to which you want to add your text.
After selecting the color panel, you need to select the Text samples in
the Media Selector pane above.
2. Click the Text button at the bottom of the Media Selector pane (the
one with the abc icon).
VideoWave displays the first of many text samples in the Media Selector.
To narrow the samples to a particular category, click the drop-down
button on the right of the drop-down list box at the top of Media
Selector pane and then click the category (see Figure 10-12). 
If you want to animate your text so that moves onto and off the color
panel (like some Hollywood movie credits do), click the Motion cate-
gory. VideoWave then displays ten different animated text samples from
which to choose. To get an idea of how your text will move onto the
color panel and in some cases move off, click the animated sample’s tiny
Play button in its lower-right corner.
3. Click the text sample in the Media Selector- Text pane that you want
to follow in creating your own text and then drag the sample to the
Production Editor pane and drop it on color panel to which the text is
to be affixed.
VideoWave opens its Text Editor window similar to the one shown in
Figure 10-12. This window contains a preview display on the left side
with Text tab options on the right where you can enter the text and
define its basic attributes. In addition, this window contains four other
tabs of options (Style, Path, Frame, and 3-D) which you can use to fur-
ther enhance the text.
Enter the text you want to appear on color panel in the list box at the
top of the Text tab. Press the Enter key to insert line breaks in the text.
273
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

Use the options on the Font, Size, Style, and Justification drop-down list
boxes to select a new font, font size, style other than Bold, and justifica-
tion other than Center. You can also increase or decrease the spacing
between the letters in the text by entering a new value in the Letter
Spacing text box or selecting one with its Plus (+) or Minus (–) keys.
Likewise, you can increase or decrease the spacing between lines when
the text spans multiple lines by entering a new value in the Line Spacing
text box or selecting one with its Plus (+) or Minus (–) keys.
You can use the options on the Style tab to customize such items as the
fill of the text characters, their outline, and shadow. You can use the
options on the Path tab to animate the text and control how it appears
and disappears on the color panel. You can use the options on the
Frame tab to add a custom frame that appears around the text. You can
use the options on the 3-D tab to create custom 3-D effects for the text
characters as well as their outlines, frames, and the frame edges.
When defining the settings for animated text, you can preview the ani-
mation in the Preview display by clicking its Play button before you
close the Text Editor window by clicking its OK button.
4. Enter the text you want to appear on color panel in the list box at the
top of the Text tab and then use the options on this tab as well as 
the other four tabs to customize its settings before you click the OK
button.
VideoWave closes the Text Editor window while building a preview of
the color panel with your text, which now appears on the color panel in
the Production Editor pane of the VideoWave window (unless you’ve
selected animated text). If your text is animated, you can preview it by
clicking the Play button in the Production Preview pane.
You may want to adjust the time that color panel and its text stays on
the screen when your movie plays. By default, VideoWave displays all
still images including scanned graphics, digital photos, and color panels
that you add to a video production, and these panels are given a dura-
tion of five seconds. If you have a lot of text on your color panel, you
may want to increase this duration. If you have just a simple one- or two-
line title, you may want to decrease this duration.
5. (Optional) To increase or decrease the time the color panel stays
onscreen in your movie, right-click the color panel and then click
Adjust Duration on the shortcut menu.
The Adjust Duration dialog box appears where you can increase or
decrease the time that the panel is displayed by entering a new value (in
seconds) in the Duration text box or by selecting one with its Plus (+) or
Minus (–) keys. 
If you want to make the new value you enter in the Duration text box the
default for all still images (including photos and color panels) that you
add to your VideoWave video productions, click the Save as Default
check box. If you want to apply the new value to all other still images
274
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

(photos and color panels) that you’ve already added to the current
VideoWave video production, click the Apply Duration to All Still Images
in the Current Production check box.
6. (Optional) Enter a new value (in seconds) in the Duration text box in
the Adjust Duration dialog box before you click the OK button.
Note that in addition to color panels, you can also add text to photos or any
other kinds of still graphic image as well as to the video clips in your video pro-
duction. In fact, you can even add text to the entire video production which is
displayed during the entire playing of the movie (to do this, you have to drag
the text thumbnail from the Media Selector pane and drop it on the Production
Editor Background in the Production Editor pane rather than a specific scene
panel). When adding text to a still image, video clip, or entire video production,
you may have to use the Enter key to insert a number of line returns in order to
get the text down low enough on the screen so that it doesn’t obscure some
important part of the still or video image that is playing.
If you decide that you want to get rid of the text that you’ve added to a par-
ticular photo or color panel, you can remove the text without removing the
image by right-clicking its scene panel in the Production Editor pane and then
clicking Remove➪Text on its shortcut menu.

Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

If you decide that you want to delete the color panel from the video production
(along with any text that you’ve added to it), you can just click its scene panel
in the Production Editor pane to select it and then press the Delete key (you
can also do this by right-clicking the pane and then clicking Delete on its short-
cut menu). VideoWave immediately eliminates the still image along with any
text the image contains and closes any gap its removal has caused in the video
production without asking you to confirm the deletion. If you get a case of
“Deleters angst,” you must immediately press Ctrl+Z or choose Edit➪Undo on
the VideoWave menu bar to bring the still image back.
Adding video clips and still images to your movie
The basic technique for adding video clips or still images such as scanned
graphics or photos that you’ve captured to your VideoWave video produc-
tions couldn’t be simpler: you open the folder or media collection that con-
tains the clips or photos you want to use in the Media Selector pane and then
drag their thumbnails from the Media Selector pane to Production Editor
pane and drop them on the next unused scene panel. 
Actually, when dragging a video clip or photo into the Production Editor pane,
you don’t even have to be that careful with where you drop it as VideoWave
will insert clip or image in the next available unused scene panel even if you
don’t drop it exactly on that panel. Also keep in mind that you can add multi-
ple images or video clips at one time by selecting all their thumbnails in the
Media Selector pane (with Ctrl+click) and then dragging all the selected
thumbnails down to Production Editor pane.
The only time you have to be really careful about where you drop the video
clip or photo is when you intentionally mean to insert it between two already
occupied scene panels. Suppose, for example, that you discover a new video
clip that you want played in between the clips currently occupying Panel 4
and Panel 5 of your video production. All you have to do to insert the new
video clip in between them is drop the new one right on top of Panel 5. When
you release the mouse button, instead of the new clip replacing the clip that
previously occupied Panel 5, the new clip takes over its position in Panel 5
and the previous owner of Panel 5 moves over to Panel 6 (and the rest of the
occupied panels from 6 on are adjusted one to the right as well).
You can also play musical scene panels by rearranging the still images and
video clips that you’ve added to the Production Editor pane. Just click the
panel with the image or clip that you want to move and then drag it to and
then drop it on the panel where it should go. VideoWave will then insert the
image or clip you moved in the panel where you dropped it and adjust the
panel position of all the remaining images and clips in the production as
needed.
To duplicate an image or clip that you’ve added to the production, right-click
its panel in the Production Editor pane and then click Copy on the panel’s
shortcut menu. Then, to insert the copied image or clip, right-click the panel
276
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

in the Production Editor pane in front of which the duplicate image or clip is
to go and then click Paste on that panel’s shortcut menu. VideoWave then
inserts the copied image or clip into a new panel at the place in the produc-
tion, moving the panel you originally right-clicked and all the panels that
come after it down one.
If you want to remove an image or clip from the video production, click its
panel in the Production Editor pane and then press the Delete key (or you
can right-click the panel and click the Delete item on its shortcut menu. As
with deleting color panels, VideoWave deletes your photos and video clips
without asking for your confirmation. The only way to bring them back to the
production if you made a boo-boo is to press Ctrl+Z or choose Edit➪Undo on
the VideoWave menu bar right away.
Use the Tools➪Find Panel command on the VideoWave to quickly locate and
select a particular clip or still image that you’ve added to your production.
When you select this command, VideoWave opens a Find Panel dialog box
that sequentially lists the names of all the scene and transition panels in your
production along with a short description and the scene or transition’s start-
ing and ending time. To go directly to a particular panel or transition in the
Production Editor pane, click in the Find Panel dialog box and then click the
OK button. VideoWave then closes the Find Panel dialog box and then goes to
the selected panel or transition in the Production Editor pane. VideoWave
also positions the Storyline Playback Head right in front of the panel so that
you can review the scene or transition in the Production Preview pane simply
by clicking that pane’s Play button.
Trimming your video clips
Some of the video clips that you add to a production may require some trim-
ming to make them just the right length and to ensure that clip starts and
ends on just the frames that you want included. To trim a video clip that
you’ve added to your video production, right-click its panel in the Production
Editor pane and then click the Adjust Duration option on its shortcut menu.
VideoWave then opens a Video Trimmer dialog box similar to the one shown
in Figure 10-13. Here, you can reset either the starting or the ending frame of
the video clip or reset both the starting and ending frames. To reset the start-
ing frame, use the playback controls under the center preview area to display
the frame where you want to clip to begin playing and then click the Set the
Start Point at the Current Position button. To reset the ending frame, use the
playback controls to display the frame where you want to clip to stop playing
and then click the Set the End Point at the Current Position button. 
To preview the trimmed clip from start to end, click the Go to Start button in
the playback controls and then click its Play button. If you’re happy with how
the clip now plays, click the OK button to close the Video Trimmer dialog box
and return to the VideoWave window. If you’re not happy with where the clip
now starts or ends, click the Reset Start Point or Reset End Point button and
then readjust where the video clip starts or ends.
277
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

Adjusting the quality of your video clips and still images
Not all the video clips and still images that you add to your video production
will be of the highest quality. If you need to, you can tweak the overall bright-
ness, contrast, and color balance and tint of any video clip or still image in the
Production Editor pane. When dealing with video clips, you can also fine-tune
the speed at which the video plays (this feature, of course, is not available
when editing still images).
To make any of these adjustments to the video clip or still image you’ve 
added to the Production Editor pane, simply right-click its panel and then
click Edit➪Adjust on its shortcut menu. VideoWave opens the Video Adjust
Editor dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 10-14. If the panel you
right-clicked contains a still image, the image appears in the preview area of
the dialog box and the Speed adjustment slider is grayed out and only the
Color Adjust sliders (Brightness, Contrast, Color, Red, Green, and Blue) are
available to you. If the panel you right-clicked contains a video clip (as does
the one in Figure 10-14), the first frame of the clip appears in the preview area
and the Speed slider as well as all the Color Adjust sliders are available to you.
To adjust a particular visual aspect of still image or video, drag the appropri-
ate slider to the right or left or click Plus (+) or Minus (–) buttons to change
its settings. If you want to return to a default speed or color setting, click the
Default button to the immediate right of its slider.
If you’re adjusting the speed of a video clip by tweaking its Speed slider, you
can click the Play button to review the speed adjustment in the Preview area
before putting the change into effect. When everything is as you want it for
the edited clip or image, click the OK button to close the Video Trimmer
dialog box and return to the VideoWave window where the program puts
your adjusted settings into effect.

If you’re dealing with a digital photo and find that you need to make adjust-
ments to it such as cropping, rotating, removing red eye, or resizing it, you
can subject it to this type of photo editing in the Photo Editor window. To
open the Photo Editor, right-click the photo’s panel in the Production Editor
pane and then click the Edit➪Photo options on its shortcut menu. The Photo
Editor contains four tabs (Crop, Rotate, Red Eye, and Resize) of options for
editing your photo (see Chapter 7 if you need help using any of these photo
editing options).
Automatically panning and zooming your still images
VideoWave has this really cool Auto Motion feature that you can apply to the
still images such as scanned graphics and digital photos that you add to a
new video production. When you apply the Auto Motion feature to a photo,
VideoWave gives the illusion of animating it by panning and/or zooming in or
out on the image.
To apply this feature to a still image that you’ve added to the Production
Editor pane, right-click its panel and then click the Auto Motion option on its
shortcut menu. VideoWave then applies the feature to the image and immedi-
ately positions the Storyline Playback Head immediately in front of the still
image in the video production. You can then preview actual panning and
zooming applied to your still image by then clicking the Play button in
Production Preview pane. If you don’t happen to like the Auto Motion effect
that VideoWave has applied, press Ctrl+Z or choose Edit➪Undo on the
VideoWave menu bar immediately to remove it and return it to its original
completely static image.

Adding panning and zooming to still images and video clips
If you like to remain in control of any pan-and-zoom effects that you add to
your still images or would like to control the camera motion in a video clip
that you’ve added to video production, you can use VideoWave’s Motion
Pictures editor to do this. Right-click the panel with the image or video clip
you want to pan and zoom and then click Edit➪Motion Pictures on its short-
cut menu.
VideoWave opens the Motion Pictures Editor window similar to the one
shown in Figure 10-15. Here, you create panning effect by defining a smaller
Visible Window within in the still image or video clip and then defining a path
upon which this window moves at different key points in the playback of the
video clip or the still image’s duration. To zoom in and out on key frames of
the video or on portions of the image, you simply modify the size of the visi-
ble window at any given key point in time.

280
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

To get an idea of how you can use the Motion Picture Editor to create pan
and zoom motion effects, follow along with the steps I followed for slowly
zooming out from the top of Buddha’s crown in the still photo shown in
Figure 10-15 to reveal the entire Buddha image at the end of the still image’s
five-second duration:
1. Right-click the panel where you add the pan and zoom effect and then
click the Edit➪Motion Pictures options on its shortcut menu.
VideoWave opens the Motion Pictures Editor window just like the one
shown in Figure 10-15. Note that the Edit option button is automatically
selected at the top of the right pane in this window (you must select the
Edit option button in order to be able to resize the view window and
define its path).
When you first open the Motion Pictures Editor, the Visible Window
(indicated by the bounding box with a dashed outline) is as large as the
still image or the first frame of the video clip. The first step in defining
any pan or zoom motion effect is to reduce the size of this window. 
(In other words, before you can zoom out on this photo, I must zoom in.)
For this example, I reduced the Visible Window until it was only big
enough to display the very top of Buddha’s head.
2. Drag the Size slider in the Keyframeable area to the left until the
Visible Window is the size that you want it at the first frame of the
video clip or at the beginning of the still image’s duration.
After resizing the Visible Window, you can now drag its bounding box
into position within the image or first frame of the video. 
3. Drag the bounding box representing the View Window to the place in
the first video frame or the start of the image’s duration where you
want VideoWave to zoom in.
For this example, I repositioned the Visible Window so that it encloses
just the top of Buddha’s crown. Keep in mind that if I were now to play
the Motions Picture effect I’ve added to my photo of Buddha, VideoWave
would start the playback as though it had zoomed in on just Buddha’s
crown that’s displayed within the Visible Window. In other words, the
crown portion of the Buddha image would zoom up so that it fills the
entire preview screen if I were to click the Play button!
To pan to a new area or zoom out further in the video or still image, I
now need to establish another key point in its timeline (the key points
that you add define the motion path). To establish the next key point, I
drag the View Screen Slider to that place in the timeline where I want to
make my next adjustment to the position or size of the Visible Window
and then click the Add button at the bottom of the Preview display.
281
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

4. Drag the View Screen Slider to the place in the clip’s or image’s time-
line and then click the Add button.
As soon as you click the Add button, VideoWave adds a new key point
whose indicator appears on the timeline. The next step is to resize and
reposition the Visible Window to display the portion of the video frame
or clip that you want displayed on the screen at this new key point.
In my case, I only need to increase the size of the Visible Window’s
bounding box and move it slightly so that it’s still centered on the
Buddha image and now encloses both his crown and forehead.
5. Adjust the size of the Visible Window using the Size slider as required at
this key point and then drag its bounding box into the desired position.
For this example, I established four additional key points for the zoom out
effect. At each key point, I slightly enlarged the Visible Window so that it
encompassed more and more of the Buddha image, each time reposition-
ing the bounding box so that it remained centered on his image.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you have established all the key points on
the timeline for the pan-and-zoom effect you want.
After you finish establishing your key points, you’re ready to see what
you’ve got. To preview the motion effect, you must first click the Preview
option button (automatically deselecting the Edit option button) and
then click the Play button in the playback controls.
7. Click the Preview option button on the right side of the Motions Pictures
window and then click the Play button in the playback controls below
the preview area.
If, upon reviewing the pan-and-zoom motion effects, you’re happy with
what you’ve got, you click the OK button to apply the motion effect to
the video clip or still image.
If you still need to fine-tune the effect, you can do so by clicking the Edit
option button again. To change the effect at a particular key point, click
its indicator in the timeline and then adjust the size and position of the
Visible Window as required. If you find that you don’t really need a par-
ticular key, you can remove it by clicking its indicator and then clicking
the Delete button.
8. Click the OK button to close the Motion Pictures window and apply
the effect to the clip or image in the VideoWave window.
Adding transitions to the scenes in your movie
VideoWave offers you a wide choice in transitions that can smooth the
changeover from one scene to the next in your movie. To add a transition
between the scene panels in the Production Editor pane, you follow these
steps in the VideoWave window:
282
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

1. Click the Transitions button at the bottom of the Media Selector pane
(the one with the rectangle that is divided diagonally).
VideoWave displays thumbnails for the first two rows of its all transi-
tions in the Media Selector - Transitions pane as shown in Figure 10-16.
To reduce the display to only the transitions in a particular category,
click the drop-down list button to the right of All and click the desired
category (Basic, Simple Reveals, Theme Reveals, Page Turns, Particles,
Slab, 3-D, or SMPTE Wipes) in the drop-down list box.
To get an idea of how the transition works, click the tiny Play button in
the lower-right corner of its thumbnail. The thumbnail demonstrates the
transition from A (in dark blue) to B (in gold) with A representing the
current scene in the panel to the immediate left of the transition panel in
the Production Editor pane where you set this transition and B repre-
senting the very next scene in the panel to the immediate right.
2. Drag the thumbnail of the transition you want to use from the Media
Selector pane to the Production Editor pane and then drop it on the
blank transition panel between the two scene panels that are to use
that transition.
After setting a transition between scenes, VideoWave automatically posi-
tions the Storyline Playback Head right before the new transition so that
you can then test it out in the Production Preview pane by simply click-
ing its Play button.
3. Click the Play button in the Production Preview pane’s controls to
review the new transition.
Sometimes the transition will play so quickly that your audience doesn’t
get the full visual effect when the movie goes from one scene to the next.
If this is the case, you can lengthen the duration of the transition to slow
it down.
4. (Optional) To adjust the length of the new transition, right-click it in
its transition panel, click the Set Transition Duration option on its
shortcut menu, and then enter or select a new length (in seconds) in
the Duration text box before clicking the Set Transition Duration
dialog box’s OK button.
Instead of repeating the previous steps to individually add the same transition
over and over again to the rest of the transition panels in your video produc-
tion, you can apply the first transition that you add manually to all the other
transition panels. Right-click the transition panel containing the first transition
that you added by hand and then click the Apply Transition to All option that
appears on its shortcut menu. VideoWave then displays an alert dialog box
asking you to confirm the replacement of all transitions in your production. As
soon as you click the Yes button in this dialog box, the program adds the first
transition to the all the rest of the transition panels that occur between occu-
pied scene panels.
283
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

If you don’t really want to use the exact same transition between every scene
in the video production, instead of selecting the Apply Transition to All option
on the transition panel’s shortcut menu, try using the Apply Transition Theme
option instead. When you click this option, VideoWave opens the Apply
Transition Theme dialog box where you can select among five different transi-
tion themes (Fast Dissolves, Slow Dissolves, Simple Transitions, Page Turns,
and Random). When you click one of these transition themes and then click
the OK button (and click the Yes button in the alert dialog box asking you to
confirm the replacement of all existing transitions in your production), the
program applies a progression of related transitions (that is, those in a similar
style) to all the rest of the transition panels between occupied scenes in the
production.
Adding special effects and overlays to your movie
VideoWave offers you a wide variety of special effects (that consist mostly of
filters with some cutouts) and overlays (that consist mostly of cutouts and
frames) that you can apply to the video clips and still images that you’ve
added to the scene panels of your production in the Production Editor pane.
To choose a particular filtering or cutout effect for your video production in
the Effects category, you click the Effects button (the one with the starburst)
at the end of the toolbar at the bottom of the Media Selector pane. VideoWave
opens the Media Selector - Effects pane displaying the thumbnails for the first
Figure 10-16:

Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

two rows of all the special effects you can choose from. To narrow the display
to particular subcategories of effects, click the drop-down button to the right
of the drop-down list box that currently contains All and then click the subcat-
egory to display (Mirror, 3-D, Colorize, Fun Effects, Frames, Soften & Sharpen,
Basic Effects, Emboss, or Noise) on this list. 
To choose a particular cutout or frame for your video production in the
Overlays category, click the Overlays button (the one with a transparent sheet
of paper over a darker, regular sheet) to the immediate left of the Effects button
on the Media Selector pane’s toolbar. VideoWave opens the Media Selector -
Overlays pane displaying the thumbnails for the first two rows of all the over-
lays you can choose from. To narrow the display to certain subcategories of
overlays, click the drop-down button to the right of the drop-down list box that
currently contains All and then click the subcategory to display (Edges, Frames,
Motion, News Banners, Textures, or My Overlays) on this list.
You can add a particular effect or overlay to an individual scene panel or to all
the panels in the entire production. To add an effect or overlay to an individual
scene panel, you drag the effect or overlay’s thumbnail from the Media Selector -
Effects or Media Selector - Overlays pane to the Production Editor pane. 
Then drop it on the particular scene panel to which you want it to apply. After
applying an effect to a particular scene panel, the Effects icon (the starburst)
appears in the lower-left corner of that panel’s thumbnail. So too, after applying
an overlay, the Overlays icon (a transparent sheet of paper over a darker, regu-
lar sheet) appears in the lower-left corner of the panel’s thumbnail.
To apply a particular effect or overlay to all the panels in the entire video
production, you drag the effect or overlay thumbnail from the Media Selector
pane and drop it on the Production Editor Background (that is, in the blank
space in the area surrounding specific scene or transition panels). Note that
when you add an effect and/or overlay to the entire video production, the
Production Editor pane gives you no visual clue as to its existence. The only
way to tell that a production is using a special effect or overlay is by recog-
nizing that fact when you review the movie in the Production Preview pane.
You can sometimes effectively combine an effect with an overlay to lend a 
definite mood to your production. For example, to give your movie a really 
old feel, try combining the Low Sepia or Medium Sepia special effect with the
Old Photo overlay. Together, your movie seems more like something produced
around the turn of the last century (that is, the early 1900s) than something
produced with twenty-first century computer software.
Removing special effects and overlays
Sometimes after reviewing the footage with a special effect or overlay that
you’ve added to a scene in the Production Preview pane, you’ll decide that
you definitely don’t want to keep it. To remove an effect from a scene panel,
right-click the panel and then click Remove➪Effects on the shortcut menu. 
To remove an overlay, you follow the same procedure except that you click
Remove➪Overlays on the panel’s shortcut menu.
285
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

If you’ve added an effect or overlay to an entire video production and then
decide that you need to lose it fast, you need to right-click somewhere in the
Production Editor Background (that is, in the space in between the scene 
and transition panels) and then click the Remove➪Effects or the Remove➪
Overlays options on the shortcut menu.
Customizing special effects and overlays
You don’t have to use a particular special effect or overlay exactly as it comes
out of the box. VideoWave enables you to customize the look and feel of an
effect or overlay that you apply to a particular scene panel or the entire video
production. What controls are available for customizing an effect or overlay
and how exactly you’re able to use them to customize it depend entirely upon
the particular effect or overlay you’re customizing. When customizing filter-
ing effects, most of them enable you to adjust their color and tint settings.
When customizing cutout overlays, most of them enable you to adjust the
size and positioning of the cutout through which the video plays or the sill
image is displayed.
To customize an effect that you’ve added to a scene panel, you right-click the
panel and then choose Edit➪Effects on its shortcut menu. To customize an
effect added to the entire production, right-click somewhere in the Production
Editor Background and then choose Edit➪Effects on the background’s short-
cut menu. VideoWave then opens to the Effects Editor dialog box for that par-
ticular effect, and you use its controls to modify the effect’s settings.
To customize an overlay that you’ve added to a scene panel, right-click the
panel and then choose Edit➪Overlays on the panel’s shortcut menu. To cus-
tomize an overlay added to the entire production, right-click somewhere in
the Production Editor Background and then choose Edit➪Overlays on the
background’s shortcut menu. VideoWave opens the Overlay Editor dialog box
for the particular overlay, and you can use its controls to modify the overlay’s
settings.
Figure 10-17 shows you the Overlay Editor dialog box that opens when you
choose the Edit➪Overlay command on the shortcut menu for a panel to
which the Old Photo overlay has been applied. As you can see in this figure,
above the Preview display, you find the Save Custom Overlay and Turn on the
Ability to Position the Overlay on the Screen buttons.
To modify the thickness of the old photo frame in the Preview display, you
can drag the Zoom slider control on the right side slightly to the right. To be
able to move the old frame in relation to the video background, you can click
the Turn on the Ability to Position the Overlay on the Screen button and then
drag the frame with the mouse. 
286
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

You can save the modifications you make to the Old Photo overlay by click-
ing the Save Custom Overlay button and then entering a new name for the
overlay (such Narrow Old Photo) in the Save dialog box before you click the
OK button. After that, the name of your customized overlay (Narrow Old
Photo in this example) is listed as part of the My Overlays subcategory. You
can then apply the customized overlay to your current and future video pro-
ductions by selecting its name in the Media Selector - Overlays pane.
Adding audio clips to your video production
VideoWave makes it easy to add background audio to your video productions.
When adding audio, you have a choice between adding a prerecorded audio
file and recording your own narration sound track for your video production.
You can even add both types of audio tracks to the same video production if
you so desire (although you have to be careful that the different audio tracks
don’t start competing with each other for the poor audience’s limited listening
attention span).
Keep in mind when adding either or both types of audio tracks to your video
production that this audio plays in the background of the movie without in
anyway canceling the audio that’s been recorded as part of the video clips
added to the production. In some cases, this will mean that your background

Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

audio tracks will compete with the sound recorded as part of each individual
video clip. As a result, you may end up having either to turn down the volume
on the background audio tracks or on the audio that’s part of each video clip
(I give you instructions on how to adjust the volume of each kind of audio
clip later in this chapter).
Often, a prerecorded audio file can serve as a background track that sets the
mood of your movie. To add a prerecorded audio file to your entire video pro-
duction, follow these steps:
1. Click the Add Background Audio to Production button (the one with
the eighth note and the plus sign) in the middle of Production Editor
pane’s toolbar.
VideoWave opens the Select Background Audio dialog box where you
locate and select the audio file that you want played as the background
music or narration for your movie. 
Note that you can only add audio files in the Select Background Audio
dialog box for which you have the Digital Management Rights. If you try
to add a file whose thumbnail has a small padlock in the lower-right
corner, when you click the Open button, VideoWave will display an alert
dialog box indicating that you don’t have the rights to the audio you
selected and VideoWave will fail to add the selected track to your video
production.
2. Select the audio file in the folder or media collection that you want to
add as the background audio in the Select Background Audio list box
and then click the Open button.
VideoWave closes the Select Background Audio dialog box and adds your
selected audio file to the production. Depending upon the length of the
audio file that you select and the length of your video production, the Fit
to Audio button may become active (if it remains grayed out, it means
that there’s just too much of a difference between the length of the movie
and the audio file to fit the video production to the background audio).
If the Fit to Audio button becomes active and you want VideoWave to
adjust the length of your video production so that it matches that of 
the total background audio, you can click this button. When you do,
VideoWave displays a Fit to Audio dialog box that indicates the discrep-
ancy between the duration of the video and still images in your movie
and the background audio and that informs of what types of changes will
be made to the duration of your video and image panels to obtain the
desired length. (This feature works best, by the way, when your video
contains color panels and scene panels with still images whose duration
can be modified as needed to get the overall length of the movie to match
that of the audio.) When you click the OK button in the Fit to Audio dialog
box, VideoWave modifies the length of the video production so that it
exactly meshes with that of the background audio.
288
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

3. (Optional) Click the Fit to Audio button on the Production Editor
pane’s toolbar and then click the OK button in the Fit to Audio dialog
box to adjust the length of the video production so that it fits exactly
that of the background audio.
Recording a narration for your video production
To record you own narration for the video production, you click the Add
Narration to Your Production button (the one with the old-fashioned micro-
phone) on the Production Editor pane’s toolbar. VideoWave then temporarily
puts the program into Timeline view and replaces the Media Selector pane
with a Narration pane (like the one shown in Figure 10-18).
The great thing about recording the narration track for your video is that you
get to watch the video footage in the Production Preview pane as you actually
record the accompanying narration. This enables you to describe in words
what the audience is seeing as you watch the video footage (which is helpful
even if you’re reading from a prepared script, which is always recommended).
Before you begin recording your narration, you may need to select the Input
device (which is most often the microphone that’s built into your computer 
or that you’ve connected to your computer) and fiddle with the Volume slider
(which usually should be somewhere in the center). Unless you intend to 
Figure 10-18:

289
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

narrate the movie from the very beginning, you will also need to use the
Scrubber button or the Jog Wheel in the playback controls at the bottom of
the Production Preview pane to cue up the frame at which you want the narra-
tion to start.
To begin recording, click the Start Recording button and begin speaking
directly into the microphone (in a normal tone). As you speak, VideoWave
will automatically begin playing the movie from the current frame in the
Production Preview pane. You can then tailor your comments to the actual
footage that’s being shown (I often remember details when watching the
footage that I’m able to capture as part of the narration). 
As soon as you finish making your narrative comments, click the Stop Recording
button (which replaces the Start Recording button the moment you click it). As
soon as you click the Stop Recording button, VideoWave saves your recorded
audio as a WAV file with the filename Nar (standing for Narration) followed by
the next available sequential number as in Nar1.wav for the first narration track
that you’ve saved. In addition, a blue bar with this filename now appears in the
Narration track in the Production Editor - Timeline pane.
Note that you can record several individual narrations for different scenes in
the movie as part of the Narration track. Just cue up the starting frame for the
next narration, click the Start Recording button, record your comments for 
the next segment in the video, and then click the Stop Recording button when
you’re through.
To preview your movie with its new narration track, drag the Timeline Playback
Head (the vertical line extending down from an upside down triangle in the
Production Editor - Timeline pane) until it’s right at the beginning of the narra-
tion in the Narration track (the one with the old fashioned microphone icon)
and then click the Play button in the Production Preview pane. 
If you’re satisfied with what you now see and hear, click the Done button at
the bottom of the Narration pane to return to the normal VideoWave window
where the Production Editor is in its default Storyline mode. If you don’t like
what you hear and would like to rerecord one or more of your narrations, click
the WAV file in the Narration track and then press the Delete button to first
remove the narration and then use the Start Recording and Stop Recording
buttons to rerecord your comments.
Adding audio clips to individual panels in the video production
Instead of, or in addition to, a background audio file that plays through the
entire video, you can also add audio files to the individual items (color panels,
video clips and still images). These audio clips then play only as long these
particular panels play in the video production. These audio clips can contain
prerecorded sound effects, narration, or music that you want should just play
as part of the panel.
290
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

To add an audio clip to a particular panel, select its audio file in the Media
Selector pane, drag its thumbnail to the Production Editor pane and then drop
it on the particular scene panel to which it is to be associated. VideoWave lets
you know that you’ve added an audio file to that panel by displaying a speaker
icon in the lower-left corner of the panel. 
The program automatically trims any clip that runs longer than the duration 
of the panel to which it is affixed (if the audio clip is shorter than the panel’s
duration, you can loop it so that it repeats until the panel finishes playing —
see “Editing audio clips in Timeline mode” later in this chapter for details).
Working in Timeline mode
Recording a narration track for your video production gives a taste for work-
ing with your video production in Timeline rather than the default Storyline
mode. Figure 10-19 shows you the VideoWave window after switching from
Storyline to Timeline mode by clicking the Timeline button near the begin-
ning of Production Editor pane’s toolbar. The Production Editor pane in this
figure shows the information that I’ve added to the entire video production in
the Video, Background Audio, Narration, Effect, and Text tracks (there’s also
an Overlay track with the name of the overlay that’s been applied to the entire
video production that isn’t visible in this figure).
When you switch to Timeline mode, the Production Editor pane presents all
the information in your current video production in individual tracks rather
than by sequential panels. By default, Timeline mode displays the informa-
tion for the entire video production in the Background Audio, Narration,
Effect, Text, and Overlay tracks beneath the Video track in the Production
Editor pane. 
Hide and seek Track style
If you haven’t added an effect, text, or overlay to the entire video production
and aren’t likely to, you can make more room for yourself in the Production
Editor pane by hiding the Effect, Text, and Overlay tracks. If you want to be
able to edit the audio that’s recorded as part of the video clips added to the
Video track (referred to as native audio), you can display the Native Audio
track. Also, if you want to add an audio clip to the video production as a
sound effect or have already done so, you need to display the Sound Effects
track in order to add the audio clip to it (by dragging its audio file from the
Media Selector and dropping it onto this track in Production Editor pane) and
to later be able to edit the audio clip.
291
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

To hide certain tracks that you don’t need in the Production Editor pane or to
display tracks that are now temporarily hidden click the Show/Hide Tracks
button at the very beginning of the Production Editor - Timeline pane’s tool-
bar. VideoWave opens the Show/Hide Tracks dialog box that has check boxes
in front of the names of all the tracks you can view in the Production Editor -
Timeline pane (Native Audio, Background Audio, Narration, Sound Effects,
Effect, Text, and Overlay). To display a particular track in the Show/Hide
Tracks dialog box, click the track’s check box until it contains a checkmark.
To hide a particular track, click its check box until the checkmark is cleared.

Marking time with the Timeline ruler
At the top of the tracks in the Production Editor - Timeline pane, you find 
the Timeline ruler. This ruler enables you to estimate the relative length of
the individual items in the tracks below. You can zoom in and expand the
level of detail in the tracks at the place in the Timeline ruler that you click
with the Hand mouse pointer and then drag to the right. So too, you can
return to your previous level of detail by dragging the ruler to the left.
Keep in mind that the zooming in and out that you do by dragging the Timeline
ruler (one of the coolest features of VideoWave in my humble opinion) is more
generalized than zooming in and out by clicking the Zoom In and Zoom Out
buttons on the Timeline toolbar. Use these buttons to zoom in and out on the
particular part of the Video track displayed in the Production Editor pane after
using the ruler-dragging method to bring that part into view in Production
Editor.
The benefits of editing your video production in Timeline mode
At first blush, the benefits of editing your video production in Timeline mode
may not be apparent. Actually, there are two main benefits to editing your
video production in Timeline mode:
 In the tracks in Timeline mode you can add multiple items including
audio clips, narration, text, special effects and overlays to the entire
video production or to a single still image or video clips the production
contains 
 By comparing information in different tracks In Timeline mode you can
see clearly how the different elements of the video production overlap
and relate to one another
The first benefit point is by far the most important. If you try, for example, to
add two different audio files that you want to play one after the other as the
background audio for your video production in Storyline mode, VideoWave
will ask you if you want to replace the first audio file as soon as you try to
add the second one. If, however, you switch to Timeline, you add the second
audio file right after the first one in the Background Audio track simply by
dragging it into position on this track.
When editing in Timeline mode, you need to be aware that there are two
views that you can switch between:
 Production level (the default) in which the tracks in the Production
Editor - Timeline pane show only the elements applied to the entire
video production
293
Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

 Internal tracks in which the tracks in the Production Editor - Timeline
pane show only the elements applied to the particular still image or
video clip in the production that you have selected
To switch from the Production-level view to the Internal tracks view, you
simply locate the still image or video clip in the Video track whose internal
tracks you want displayed and then double-click somewhere within that
image or clip. The Production Editor - Internal Tracks pane then appears at
the bottom of the VideoWave window. This pane contains the tracks for just
the still image or video you double-clicked. You can then edit the audio, text,
effects, and overlays applied only to this element in the appropriate tracks in
this view. When you’re finished editing in the localized Internal Tracks view,
you can return to the more general Production-level view by clicking the
Done button (the one with the green bent arrow) that’s added to the left side
of the Internal Tracks toolbar.
When editing elements in the tracks of the Production Editor (either in the
Production-level or the Internal tracks view), you can drag the bars representing
the different types of media items (audio, effects, text, overlays, and what not)
to resize or reposition them on its particular track. To resize an item (such as an
effect or an overlay, position the mouse pointer at the end of the item in its
track and then when the mouse pointer turns into a double-pointed arrow, drag
its blue bar to the left (to make it shorter) or to the right (to make it longer).
When editing certain items such audio clips, effects, text, and overlays at the
Production-level view, you can split the items in two at the position of Timeline
Playback Head in the Production Editor by clicking its track and then clicking
the Split Media Item at the Current Position button. After splitting an item, you
can then resize and drag its now separate parts to different positions on the
timeline so that they each affect only a certain part of the video production.
Editing audio clips in Timeline mode
Although you can edit the length and the position (how long and where they
play) of the audio clips in your video production by directly manipulating their
bars in their respective tracks (Native Audio, Background Audio, Narration,
and Sound Effects) in Production Editor, if you want to the trim the audio or
modulate its volume or adjusting some other aspect of its sound, you need to
open the clip in the Audio Editor. 
To do this, locate the audio clip in its track in the Production Editor - Timeline
pane and then double-click -click somewhere on it or right-click and then click
the Edit option on its shortcut menu. VideoWave then generates a preview of
the selected audio clip and opens it in the Audio Editor window similar to the
one shown in Figure 10-20. 
294
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

In the Audio Editor, you can make any of the following edits to the selected
audio clip:
 Adjust the overall volume of the audio clip by dragging the Overall
Volume (dB) slider to the right (to increase the volume) or the left (to
diminish the volume)
 Adjust the volume throughout the audio clip by clicking different
places in the waveform envelope to add edit points that you can then
drag up above the centerline to increase the volume or down below the
centerline to diminish the volume
 Fade the volume in at the start and out at the end of the audio clip by
clicking the Fade In and Fade Out check boxes and then enter the fade-in
and fade-out times in the associated text boxes (in seconds) or select
them by clicking the Plus (+) or Minus (–) buttons
 Equalize the sound in the audio clip by dragging the Bass, Midrange,
and/or Treble sliders in the Equalizer area to the right (to modulate the
sound using a 10-band equalizer, click the Advanced option button at the
top of Equalizer area; to select a predefined equalization, click the Open

button and click its name in the Media Selector; to save your customized
settings, click the Save button and enter a name for the audio settings in
the Save dialog box)
 Trim the audio clip by clicking the Trim Audio button to open the Audio
Trimmer. There, you drag the Audio Start marker to the new start position
and click the Set Start Point at the Current Position button before you
drag the Audio End marker to the new end position and click the Set End
Point at the Current Position button. You then complete the trimming
sequence by clicking OK.
 Loop the audio clip by clicking the Loop check box in the Audio
Trimmer dialog box before clicking its OK button
When you finish making some or all of these editing changes to your audio
clip, you can preview the modifications by clicking the Play button in the
audio controls at the bottom-left of the Audio Editor window. When you’re
satisfied with the tweaks and edits you’ve made to your sound clip, click the
OK button to close the Audio Editor and put the new audio settings into
effect in VideoWave window.
To remove the audio portion that’s been recorded as part of a video clip,
double-click its clip in the Native Audio track and then drag the Overall
Volume (dB) slider all the way to the left so that in the future the video clip
plays completely silently in the movie as though it no longer had any audio
associated with it.
Outputting the Video Production
When you finish having fun with the hundreds of VideoWave editing features
and finally have your video production just the way you want it and all the
last-minute changes are saved with the File➪Save command (in the native
VideoWave 7 DMSM file format), you’re ready to output your finished produc-
tion as a movie that you can share it with the rest of the world (Sundance
look out!).
VideoWave attempts to make outputting your finished production as easy as
possible. All you have to decide during this process is where you want the fin-
ished movie shown (on what device) and in what quality (which determines
how much compression is used in the final video file and how large the file is).
To output your finished and saved video production, click the Output Your
Production to in Different Formats button near the end of the Production
Editor pane’s toolbar or choose File➪Output Production To on the Video-
Wave menu bar. VideoWave displays the VideoWave window similar to the
one shown in Figure 10-21 that contains the program’s Output To wizard.
296
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Here, you must select from the following destinations for your movie before
you click the Next > button:
 Video File to make a movie that you can play on your computer using a
program such as Windows Media Player
 Internet to make a movie that you can upload to a Web site on the Internet
 TV/VCR to make a movie that you can output to a video cassette tape
and then show on TV
 DV Camcorder to make a movie that you can output to digital tape on
your DV camcorder
 E-mail to make a movie that you can send as an attachment to an e-mail
message
As soon as you click the Next> button the next window in the Output To
wizard appears. The options that this window contains depend upon which
destination you selected in the initial window. In general, in this window, you
need to specify the quality of the movie that you’re making. In selecting the
quality of the final video file, you are necessarily selecting the amount of
compression to be used and how large the resulting file will be (the higher
the quality, the less the compression and the bigger the final video file).

Chapter 10: Creating and Editing Video Productions

Note that when you select Video File as the destination, you must also select
the purpose of the video file in the Purpose drop-down list box (you select
the Playback on This Computer option on the drop-down list when your
intention is just to play the movie with Windows Media Player). Note too, if
you select the Show All option in the Purpose drop-down list, VideoWave dis-
plays another drop-down list box that contains all the possible video formats
(MPEG-1, MPEG-2, compressed and uncompressed AVI, or WMV), the physical
movie sizes (such as 320x240 pixels), and the number of frames per second
(fps). You can then select the individual file format that best suits your imme-
diate purpose for the movie (you can, of course, always return to this wizard
and select another file format to which to output the movie when your pur-
pose changes).
Keep in mind when selecting a video format, physical movie size, and frames
per second from the Purpose drop-down list that each aspect affects the over-
all size of the resulting movie file. The larger the physical movie size and the
higher the frames per second, the larger the resulting movie file. Large movie
file sizes are not only more difficult to share on the Internet but require more
processing power for playback on a personal computer.
After specifying the quality of the finished movie and clicking the Next > button,
the wizard prompts you to enter a filename for the finished movie (you can also
change the location on your hard disk by selecting a new folder with the Browse
button). After entering the filename and clicking the Next> button again, the
wizard normally presents you with a window that contains a Render File button. 
Click the Render File button to have the VideoWave Output To wizard create
the finished movie file by rendering it frame-by-frame in the video file format
that conforms to the destination and purpose you designated for the final
movie file. If, for example, you select the Internet or E-mail as your destination,
VideoWave renders the video production into a WMV file ready to upload to
the Internet or send as an e-mail attachment. If, however, you select Video File
(with Playback On This Computer) or TV/VCR as your destination, the pro-
gram renders your production into an MPEG video file. And when you select
DV Camcorder as your destination, the program renders your production into
an AVI video file.
After the wizard finishes rendering the video file, you can then click the
Preview button to preview the finished product. For all destinations except
for Video File, the Output To wizard then presents you with a button that 
you click to output the finished file to its target destination:
 Upload to Internet when you’ve selected Internet as the destination and
you want to upload the file to a particular URL on the Internet
 Send E-mail when you’ve selected E-mail as the destination and you
want to open a new message in your E-mail program with the movie
attached to it
298
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

 Output My Video when you’ve selected TV/VCR or DV Camcorder as the
destination and you want to open transfer the movie file to video cas-
sette tape on a VCR or a digital video tape on your Camcorder attached
to the computer
After you finish transferring the final movie file to its desired destination,
click the Done button in the VideoWave window to close the Output To
wizard and return to the normal VideoWave window.
Burning the Video Production to Disc
Instead of outputting your finished video production to video file, you can just
send it to a DVD disc instead. To burn your finished and saved video produc-
tion to a DVD disc, click the Burn Production to Disc button at the very end of
the Production Editor pane’s toolbar or choose File➪Burn Production to Disc
on the VideoWave menu bar.
As soon as you choose this command, the VideoWave application closes, the
DVD Builder application launches, and the Project Type dialog box appears.
Here, you must select the type of DVD project you want to build (DVD, Video
CD, Super Video CD, or DVD on CD) and then click OK. You must then click
the Burn button on the far right of the Menu Editor pane’s toolbar or choose
File➪Plug & Burn on the DVD Builder menu bar and follow the prompts in the
Burn Setup and Burn Progress dialog boxes to actually copy your movie onto
a DVD disc (see Chapter 11 for details on this burning process and how to
make your finished video file into a movie title in a larger DVD project).

D
VD Builder is the place to go to when you want to build and burn
your DVD projects. With DVD Builder, you can construct projects that
play on standalone DVD players (including the latest machines using the
newer VCD and SVCD formats) as well as your computer’s DVD drive. As
with all the other applications in the Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 suite, DVD
Builder makes it as easy as possible to build and burn sophisticated
DVD discs.
This chapter acquaints you with all the aspects of using DVD Builder to create
your DVD projects and burn them to disc. It starts by familiarizing you with
the different DVD projects supported by DVD Builder. The chapter then goes
on to introduce you to the DVD Builder window and its features (which will
be very familiar to those of you who have used the information in Chapter 11
to design and build video productions in the VideoWave application). As part
of this introduction, you find out how to use and customize DVD Builder’s
built-in themes, add new DVD titles to your project, as well as how to create 
a menu system for selecting titles you add to your DVD.
The chapter ends by giving you pointers on how to preview and test out your
DVD project before burning it to disc and then giving you the ins and outs of
burning your finished project to disc.

Launching DVD Builder and Selecting
Your DVD Project
You can launch DVD Builder from the Easy Media Creator Home window by
clicking the Create New DVD link in the DVD column or the DVD Builder link in
the Applications column. If the Easy Media Creator Home window is not open,
you can launch DVD Builder from the Windows XP taskbar by clicking the
Start button, then highlighting All Programs on the Start menu and Roxio on
the All Programs submenu before clicking DVD Builder on the Roxio submenu.
When you first launch DVD Builder, the Project Type dialog box appears,
giving you a chance to select the type of DVD project you want to build (see
Figure 11-1). DVD Builder automatically selects the DVD option button in the
Project Type dialog box as the default project type. If you know that you will
mainly be building one of the other types (Video CD, Super Video CD, or DVD
on CD) instead, after clicking that other type’s option button, be sure that
you click the Set as Default for New Projects check box before you click the
OK button.
When selecting a type for your new DVD project, you have a choice in creat-
ing the following types:
 DVD to create a project for a DVD-Recordable disc that can hold up to
two hours of high-quality video in the DVD-Video or DVD+RW format for
playback on most standalone DVD players and computer DVD drives
 Video CD (also known as VCD) to create a project for a CD-Recordable
disc that can hold up to 74 minutes of video on a 650MB CD or up to 80
minutes on a 700MB CD in the Video CD (VCD) format for playback in
some of the newer standalone DVD players and computer DVD drives
Figure 11-1:
The first
thing you
must do
after

302
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

 Super Video CD (also known as SVCD) to create a project for a CD-
Recordable disc that can hold between 35 and 60 minutes of high quality
video on 650/700MB CDs in the Super Video CD format for playback on
some of the new standalone DVD players and computer DVD drives
 DVD on CD to create a project for a CD-Recordable disc that can hold
between 15 and 20 minutes of video in the mini DVD format for playback
only on computer DVD drives
After selecting the type of DVD project you want to create, click the OK
button to close the Project Type dialog box and begin building your new DVD
project.
Getting Cozy with the
DVD Builder Window
As soon as you close the Project Type dialog box, the empty DVD Builder
window similar to the one shown in Figure 11-2 appears. As you can see in
Figure 11-2 the DVD Builder window is divided into three panes: the Edit Task
pane on the left side, the Menu Editor pane at the top right, and the
Production Editor pane right below it.

Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

To any of you who are the least little bit familiar with any of the other appli-
cations in the Easy Media Creator suite, the pane layout in this window
should seem very familiar. As with the VideoWave application, DVD Builder
places the links to the different types of tasks you create in the pane on the
left side of the window, while dividing the right side into upper and lower
panes where you do the work.
The main difference between the VideoWave and DVD Builder windows is
that the upper-right pane in DVD Builder (the Menu Editor pane) holds not
the source of the elements that you add to the Production Editor pane below
(as in VideoWave) but rather the layout of the main screen of your DVD pro-
ject. What this means in practical terms is that you work with the upper
Menu Editor pane in DVD project almost as much, if not more, as you do the
Production Editor pane.
The Edit Task pane
The Edit Task pane shown in Figure 11-3 holds the links to the common tasks
that you perform in building your DVD project. At the top of this pane, you
find the Edit and Preview buttons (with the Edit button pressed by default).
Beneath these buttons, the Edit Task pane is divided into three smaller panes
(from top to bottom):
304
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 
The big difference between the titles of a DVD
project and the titles in a DVD project
Please don’t get confused between the titles
that you add to DVD project and the titles that
you place in your DVD project. The former, the
titles of the DVD project, refer to the textual
labels that assign to the menu screen and nav-
igation buttons that describe their function in
the project. The latter, the titles in the DVD pro-
ject, refer to the video productions that you add
to the project and the menu buttons you assign
to them. The video productions in your DVD
titles (often prepared in VideoWave, although
you can create them in DVD Builder as well) can
consist of a sequence of video clips or still
graphic images or a combination of the two.
To avoid confusion between the titles of the
DVD project and the titles in it, in this chapter I
will refer to the titles that you assign to the menu
or the menu buttons in the project as names or
labels. That way, when you see the term titles in
the text, you know to think of the video produc-
tions and associated menu buttons that you add
to your DVD project.

 Add Content with the links for adding new DVD titles to the DVD project
and links for adding content and transitions to the title you’re currently
editing and capturing photos or video for it
 DVD Menu Settings with the links for selecting a theme for your DVD
project, selecting a background graphic or audio
 On-Disc Options with the links for using the Plug & Burn link to record
videotape from a device connected to your computer directly to a CD or
DVD disc and editing the content on a rewritable DVD disc
Note that you can hide the options in any of the smaller panes that you’re
currently not using (Add Content, DVD Menu Settings, and On-Disc Options)
in the Edit Task pane by clicking its collapse button (the one on the right
of the pane’s title bar with the two upward-pointing arrowheads). To redis-
play the options in a particular sub-pane, click its Expand button (that
replaces the Expand button as soon as you click it marked with the two
downward-pointing arrowheads).
You click the Preview button at the top of the Edit Task pane to put DVD
Builder into preview mode, wherein you can not only review the titles you’ve
added to the DVD project but also simulate using your onscreen menus to
navigate these titles and play them (see “Previewing the finished DVD pro-
ject” later in this chapter for details).

Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

The Menu Editor pane
The Menu Editor pane shown in Figure 11-4 is the place where you design
the look and feel and layout of your DVD project. The display screen in the
center of this pane contains the name of the DVD project’s menu, the menu
buttons that your users click to play the titles (that contain the video and
still images you want played — see the following sidebar) in the DVD, and the
labels that identify these menu buttons as well as the background graphic on
which these buttons and labels are placed. (Note that the arrangement of
these menu buttons and their labels form the main menu system for your
DVD project.)

The Production Editor pane
The Production Editor pane shown in Figure 11-5 should be old hat to any of
you who have experience using the almost identical Production Editor pane
in the VideoWave application in its default Storyline mode. The Production
Editor pane in the DVD Builder window is a little different in that it displays
only the contents of the title whose navigation button is currently selected in
the Menu Editor pane above (although you can display all the titles in your
DVD project in this pane by clicking the Show All Titles link to put a check-
mark in its check box).
The Production Editor pane displays the video clip and/or still image con-
tents in the current title in a series of scene panels separated by transition
panels which contain the particular scene transitions that you take you from
one panel to the next (see Chapter 10 for details on adding video clips and
still images to the Production Editor pane in Storyline mode).

Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

The Production Editor pane toolbar contains the basic tools you need to edit
the contents of a DVD title, including adjusting the duration of the video clip
or still image in the current panel, rotating the orientation of a still image in
the current panel, removing a panel from the title, adding background audio
for the title, and adding transitions between specific title panels. In addition,
this toolbar contains a Mark Chapters button that you can use to mark spe-
cific jump points in the title — that is, pauses in the video sequence or
photos where your users can directly jump to by clicking the Next Chapter
button (>|) with their DVD remote controls. 
The last tool on the Production Editor pane toolbar is the Advanced Edit
button that you can use to launch the VideoWave application and open 
the title in its window as a Storyboard production in Storyline mode (see
Chapter 10 for details).
Building Your DVD Project
After you launch DVD Builder and select the type of DVD project you want to
build, you’re ready to begin designing the project’s menus and adding the
titles you wan it to contain. The following sections take you through the gen-
eral steps from selecting the theme for your new DVD project all the way to
previewing the finished project prior to burning it to CD or DVD disc.
Selecting the project theme
The first thing you want to do in a new DVD project is select its theme. DVD
Builder offers a whole bunch of prefab themes that include the graphics for
the menu background, the look of the menu, chapter, and navigation buttons,
the fonts used in displaying the main menu and chapter menu names and the
button labels, and even the background music that plays whenever the main
menu screen is displayed (indicated in the Menu Editor pane by the presence
of an eighth note in the lower-right corner of main menu screen).
To select a theme for your new DVD project, click the Theme link in the DVD
Menu Settings portion of the Edit Task pane or choose DVD Menu➪Change
Menu Theme on the DVD Builder menu bar. DVD Builder opens the Menu
Theme dialog box shown in Figure 11-6. This dialog box contains two tabs on
the left side: the Predefined Themes tab, which contains 17 prefab themes to
choose from, and the Custom Themes tab, which contains any customized
themes that you’ve designed and saved. On the right side, this dialog box con-
tains two more tabs: the Main Themes that displays the background, menu
buttons, and the font used by the main menu screen for the theme selected on
the Predefined Themes or Custom Themes tab and Chapter Menus that shows
308
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

the background graphic, the chapter and navigation buttons, as well as
the font used on the chapter menu screen (chapter menus are created only
when you add chapters to a title and you elect to have menus created for the
chapters — see “Adding chapters to a title” later in this chapter for details).
To preview the type of background graphic, menu, chapter, and navigation
buttons, and the font that a particular predefined theme uses, click its thumb-
nail on the Predefined Themes tab and then view the preview on both the
Main Menus and Chapter Menus tabs.
To customize the look of a predefined theme that you’ve selected on the
Predefined Themes tab, click its thumbnail. Then click the Advanced >>
button at the bottom of the Menu Theme dialog box to expand this dialog box
to the Advanced Theme dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 11-7.
You can then use the controls in the lower half of the Advanced Menu Theme
dialog box.
You can then use the controls in the lower half of the Advanced Menu Theme
dialog box to customize the look and feel and layout of the basic theme. For
example, you can change the background graphic used in the theme by click-
ing the Browse button to the right of the Photo/Video drop-down list and then
selecting one of your own photos in the Browse Folder dialog box. Likewise,
you can select a new audio file to use as the main menu screen background
music by clicking the Browse button to the right of the Audio drop-down list
and then selecting a new audio file in its Browse File dialog box. 
If you don’t want any audio playing when your users are viewing the main
menu screen (this can be obnoxiously repetitive because even when it fades
out, it always starts right up again), click the drop-down button attached to
the Audio drop-down list and then click None at the very bottom of this list.

dialog box.
309
Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

After you finish customizing the layout and look and feel of the predefined
theme to your satisfaction, you can save your changes as a custom theme.
Click the Save as Custom Theme button at the bottom of the Advanced Main
Theme dialog box and then enter a name for your custom theme in the Save
Theme dialog box. Then click the OK button. To apply the custom theme
you’ve saved, you then click the OK button in the Advanced Main Theme
dialog box.
Modifying the name of the
first main menu screen
After you select the theme you want to use in your new DVD project, you
probably want to change the generic name of the main menu from the com-
pletely uninspiring names such as Menu, Wedding, and Baby to something
more descriptive such as The French Riviera, Wedding Bells, and Baby’s
First Year.
To modify the name of the main menu, click the I-beam mouse pointer some-
where in its generic name in the preview in the Menu Editor pane to display
its bounding box and then edit the text. To change the font, font size, or the
attributes used by main menu name, right-click the name and then click the
Change Font option at the top of its shortcut menu.

Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

The Font dialog box opens where you can select a new font, font size, change
the text enhancements (Bold, Italic, Outline, and Shadow), as well as select
new colors for the text, text outline, or shadow.
To reposition the main menu name on the main menu screen, click the name
to display its bounding box and then position the mouse pointer on one of
the edges of the bounding box. When the pointer changes to a four-headed
arrow, you can drag the name to a new place on the screen. To nudge the
name just a little after dropping it in its new position, press the appropriate
arrow keys on your keyboard (left-arrow to nudge to the left, right-arrow key
to nudge to the right, and so on).
Keep in mind that the main menu name is restricted to a single line (there’s
no way to add a second line). If the text of your modified name extends
beyond the edges of the screen, you will have to reduce the font size of the
text until it all fits on the screen. Keep in mind as well that any text that
extends beyond the safe areas on the left or right side of the main menu
screen may be cut off when the DVD project is played on some televisions.
Click the Show/Hide Safe Area for Televisions button on the Menu Editor
pane’s toolbar to display the safe area and check if any text is in danger of
being cut off (indicated by characters in the unsafe, checkerboard area).
Adding titles to your DVD project
After you have the theme and the main menu name settled, you’re ready to
start adding the titles with the content you want to play to your DVD project.
Most of the time, these titles will be in the form of video productions that
you’ve created ahead of time in the Easy Media Creator’s VideoWave applica-
tion (see Chapter 11 for details). If you haven’t created a video production
ahead of time, you can also create a title for your new DVD project by adding
the media content and creating it as you go.
Adding existing video productions as titles
To add a new title from an existing VideoWave production, click the Add New
Title link at the top of the Add Content area in the Edit Task pane or choose
DVD Menu➪Add New Title and then click the name of the DMSM file (the file-
name extension given to Roxio Media Production files) in the Add Media to
Project dialog box before you click the Add button. 
DVD Builder then adds a menu button with the name of the video produc-
tion’s filename in the Menu Editor pane while at the same time adding the
contents of the video production to Production Editor pane below (see
Figure 11-8).
311
Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

I encourage you to create the different titles for your DVD project in the
VideoWave application beforehand and then assemble them in your project
by adding them as individual titles. That way, you’ll have each title laid out
and working exactly the way you want it before you launch DVD Builder.
Having your titles completed beforehand makes assembling them and burn-
ing them with DVD Builder a snap.
Creating new titles as you add their content
Sometimes, you need to add a title to your new DVD project that you haven’t
already assembled beforehand as a VideoWave production. To create a new
title as you add its content, click the Add New Title link at the top of the Add
Content area in the Edit Task pane or choose DVD Menu➪Add New Title and
then select the name of the video or graphic file that you want to add to appear
at the beginning of the new title in the Add Media to Project dialog box.
DVD Builder then adds a menu button for the new title in the Menu Editor
pane. This button uses the first frame or the graphic in the file you selected
as its image and the name of the file you selected as its label. The program
also inserts the video clip or still image in the first scene panel in the
Production Editor pane below.
Figure 11-8:

312
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

To add other video clips and/or still graphic images (and photos) to the new
title, click the Add to Selected Title link in the Add Content area of the Edit
Task pane. Then select the name of the video or graphic file that you want to
appear in the next panel in the Add Media to Project and click the Add button.
DVD Builder then adds the video clip or photo you next selected to the next
panel in the Production Editor pane. You can continue in this manner, adding
video clips or still images until your new title contains all the video clips
and/or still images you want for that title in the sequence you want them to
play back. 
After adding all the video clips and/or still images, you can click the
Transitions Themes link on the Production Editor pane’s toolbar to add simi-
lar transitions in between all the panels in your new title. You can click the
Advanced Edit button at the end of this toolbar to open the new title in the
VideoWave window where you can do all sorts of edits including adding indi-
vidual transitions between the panels and annotating them with text (see
Chapter 10 for detailed information on all the types of editing that you can do
with VideoWave).
Renaming, repositioning, and resizing menu buttons
Many times after adding a number of different titles to a menu screen, you
find that you need to rename, reposition, and even resize their menu buttons.
To rename a menu button, click the insertion point in its label (beneath the
thumbnail image) and then edit the name as you would any other text. When
you finish editing the menu button’s name, click the mouse button somewhere
on the screen background outside of its text box.
To reposition a menu button on its menu screen, click the button’s thumbnail
and then position the mouse pointer somewhere within the thumbnail image.
When the pointer changes into a four-headed arrow, drag the button to its
desired position. Note that, by default, the Snap to Grid button on the Menu
Editor pane’s toolbar is selected so that the button automatically goes to the
nearest gridline on an invisible grid when you drop the button into place by
releasing the mouse button. If you want to be able to position in between the
invisible gridlines, click the Snap to Grid button to deselect it and then drag
the button to the desired position or nudge it into place with the appropriate
arrow keys on your keyboard.
To reposition more than one button at a time, Ctrl+click the buttons and then
drag their images to the desired position. If you want DVD Builder to auto-
matically align the selected buttons for you on a horizontal line, click the
Align Horizontally button on the Menu Editor toolbar. To automatically align
the selected buttons vertically, click the Align Vertically button on this tool-
bar instead.
313
Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

Click the Auto Arrange button on the Menu Editor pane’s toolbar to have DVD
Builder automatically rearrange all the menu buttons at one time according
the layout for the theme that your DVD project uses. Note that if you later
want to manually reposition one or more of the buttons individually, you first
need to click the Auto Arrange button on the Menu Editor toolbar. To align
buttons in a row, Ctrl+click all the buttons that should line up in a single row
to select their images and then click the Align Horizontally button. To then
align buttons a single column, Ctrl+click all the buttons that should line up in
that column and then click the Align Vertically button.
Many times the menu buttons that you add to a menu screen are larger than
you want them to be. To avoid overcrowding on the menu screen and over-
lapping the text of the button labels, you may want to make the buttons
smaller (DVD Builder automatically reduces the size of a button’s label when
you make its button image smaller).
To resize a menu button, click its image to select it (indicated by the white
border around the image with teeny-tiny sizing handles in each corner). Then
position the mouse pointer in one of the corners on a sizing handle. When
the mouse pointer changes into a double-headed arrow, drag the pointer
toward the center of the image to make the button smaller or away from the
center to make the button larger.
Inserting a new title menu screen into the DVD project
Many of your DVD projects, especially those of the DVD project type that you
burn to DVD discs, will require too many titles for just the one main menu
screen. To add new a title menu screen to your DVD project after you fill up
the main menu screen, choose DVD Menu➪New Menu on the DVD Builder
menu bar. DVD Builder then adds a new blank title menu screen using the
same background graphic and generic menu name as the main menu screen. 
The program also adds a Previous navigation button (in the style of the
theme you selected for the project) that the user can click to return to the
main menu screen, while at the same time adding a Next navigation button 
to the main menu screen that the user can click to display this second title
menu screen and have access to its menu buttons.
You can then rename this second title menu screen and add new titles to it
just as you did in the main menu screen. To jump between the menu screens,
you click the Menu Selector drop-down list button and then click the numeric
name of the title menu screen to which you want to jump (Title Menu 1 is the
name given to the main menu screen of your DVD project).
You can add as many title menu screens as you need to accommodate all the
titles you want to add to your DVD project. Just watch the DVD Disc Project
Size indicator at the bottom of DVD Builder window as you add your titles to
see how close you’re coming to filling up the disc.
314
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Adding an Intro Title to your DVD project
An Intro Title is one that automatically plays at the beginning of your CD or
DVD disc when the user puts the disc into his or her DVD player. When the
Intro Title finishes playing, the main menu screen appears and stays on
screen, from which you can select the next title that you want to watch.
To add an Intro Title to your DVD project, click the Add Intro Title link in the
Add Content area of the Edit Task pane or choose DVD Menu➪Add Intro Title
on the DVD Builder menu bar. DVD Builder then opens the Add Media to
Project dialog box where you can select the video production, video clip, 
or still image that you want to use as the Intro Title for your DVD project. 
When you click the Add button to close the Add Media to Project dialog box
after selecting the media file, DVD Builder displays the Intro DVD Builder
window similar to the one shown in Figure 11-9. This window shows the photo
or the first frame of the video clip you selected in the Add Media to Project
dialog box in the Menu Editor pane and panels and transitions in the file in
the Production Editor pane below. The Edit Task pane at the left side of this
window, however, contains only the Add Contents options. Also, the name,
Intro, appears in the text box of the Media Selector drop-down list in the
upper-right corner of the Menu Editor pane.
Figure 11-9:

315
Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

For your Intro Title, you may want to add a color panel or still photo on which
you place some introductory text with an overview of the disc’s contents or
the credits for your production, including yourself, of course, as the director,
best boy, key grip, and who knows what else!
Dividing a title into chapters
Sometimes, you’ll want to break up a long video sequence in a title or provide
certain jump points in a title composed of a long sequence of photographic
images. You do this by adding chapters to the title. When you add chapters
to a title, your users can jump back and forth to these jump points by clicking
the Previous (|<) and Next (>|) buttons on their DVD player’s remote control.
When creating chapters for a title, you also have the option of creating chap-
ter menus whose buttons your users can click to jump back and forth between
the title’s chapters.
To mark the chapters in one of the titles in your DVD project, follow these
steps:
1. Select the title menu in the Menu Selector drop-down list box that con-
tains the title for which you want to add chapters and then click its
button to select it.
2. Click the Mark Chapters buttons on the Production Editor pane’s tool-
bar or choose Title➪Mark Chapters on the DVD Builder menu bar.
DVD Builder opens the Mark Chapters dialog box similar to the one
shown in Figure 11-10. Here, you can add, change, or delete chapter
makers in the current title. When adding chapter markers, you can have
DVD Builder automatically detect chapters by looking for changes in
brightness and color between successive frames and the pauses in the
title and add chapter markers at each pause. Or you can add them man-
ually by scanning the frames or photos in the title. 
To use DVD Builder’s Auto Detect feature to detect the changes or
pauses and add the chapter markers for you, click the Auto Detect
button. To increase the program’s sensitivity in differentiating chapters
by changes in the brightness and color of frames, you drag the Sensitivity
slider to the right or click the Plus (+) button. To control how long a
pause must be before the Auto Detect feature will insert a new chapter
marker, enter the number of seconds in the Minimum Seconds Between
Chapters text box or select a new value by clicking its Plus (+) or Minus
(–) buttons.
To add the chapter markers manually, you use the playback controls
(Previous Frame, Play, and Next Frame or the Plus (+), Minus (–), and
scroll button) found under the title’s preview on the left side of the
dialog box to find the frame or photo where you want to start a new
316

chapter. When you come upon this frame or photo, you then click the
Add button to add a new chapter marker (whose thumbnail with its time
code then appears in the list box on the right side of the dialog box).
3. To have DVD Builder detect and add the chapter markers for you,
click the Auto Detect button. To add the markers yourself, use the
playback controls to display the frame (or photo in a slideshow title)
where the marker is to occur and then click the Add button.
Sometimes DVD Builder’s Auto Detect feature adds chapter markers that
you decide you really don’t need to retain. In that case, you can follow
Step 4 to remove the unwanted chapter marker
4. (Optional) To remove any chapter marker that you don’t want to use,
click its thumbnail in the list box on the right and then click the
Remove button.
If your project is a DVD or DVD or CD, you can have DVD Builder create
chapter menus that act as submenus for selecting and playing particular
chapters in the title.
5. (Optional) To have DVD Builder create chapter menus for the chapter
markers displayed in the list box on the right side of the Mark
Chapters dialog box, click the Create Chapter Menus check box to put
a checkmark in it.
When you have chapters you want in your title, you’re ready to have
DVD Builder create them.
6. Click the OK button to close the Mark Chapters dialog box and add
the chapter markers to your project.

Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

If you added chapter menus to your title, you can see check them out when
you preview the finished DVD project as described in the section immediately
following. For the Chapter menu screen, DVD Builder automatically assigns
the name of the title as the screen label and sequentially numbers and
arranges the chapters (with their thumbnails) on this screen. Unfortunately,
DVD Builder provides no way for you to rename the Chapter menu screen 
or the chapters themselves (I prefer something a little more descriptive 
than 1, 2, 3, and the like for my chapters).
Previewing the finished DVD project
After you’ve got all the media you need in your DVD project, it’s time to pre-
view the final production before you burn it to DVD or CD disc. To preview
the DVD project you’re working on, you simply click the Preview button at
the top Edit Task pane to the immediate right of the Edit button. 
As soon as you click the Preview button, a DVD Builder window similar to
the one shown in Figure 11-11 appears. This window contains two panes:
the Playback Controls pane on the left, which contains a virtual DVD remote
control, and the Preview pane on the right, which contains a preview of
your project’s Main menu screen.
If your project contains an Intro Title (see “Adding an Intro Title to your DVD
project” earlier in the chapter for details), the Intro button at the top of the
DVD Controls will be available (otherwise it’s grayed out) as well as the Menu
button. To preview the Intro Title in your DVD project, click the Intro button
in the virtual DVD remote (remember that the Intro Title plays automatically
on the disc you create from this project as soon as the user puts the disc in
the player).
To preview the other titles on the Main menu, click the Left, Right, Up, and
Down controls on the virtual remote until the title you want to view is
selected (indicated by a highlighted outline around its thumbnail) and then
click the OK button on the virtual remote. When the title begins playing, you
can then use the other playback controls such as Pause and Fast Forward to
preview its contents. If you added chapter markers to your title, you can use
the Next Chapter and Previous Chapter buttons to jump to and from different
chapters in the title.
When you finish previewing a certain title, you can return to the Main menu
screen by clicking the Stop button. If your DVD project contains more than
one menu screen, you can advance to the next menu screen by highlighting
the Next button (an arrow in the project’s selected theme pointing to the
right) near the bottom of the Main menu screen and then clicking the OK
button on the virtual remote. You can then return to the Main menu screen
by highlighting this new menu screen’s Back button (an arrow in the style of
the selected theme pointing to the left) and clicking the remote’s OK button.
318
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

If a title that you select for previewing contains Chapter menus, its Chapter
menu screen appears when you highlight its title thumbnail and click the OK
button in the virtual remote. You can then play a particular chapter by high-
lighting its chapter thumbnail and then clicking the OK button on the virtual
remote. You can also advance to the next chapter in the title by clicking the
Next Chapter button or to an earlier chapter by clicking the Previous Chapter
button. 
When you click the Stop button after previewing a particular chapter, DVD
Builder returns you to the Chapter menu screen. To return to the menu screen
from which you selected the title containing the chapters you just previewed,
you highlight the Up button (the one with the arrow in the style of your pro-
ject theme that points upward) and then click the OK button on the virtual
remote control.

Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

When you finish previewing the titles on your DVD project, click the Edit
button above the DVD Controls to return to the original DVD Builder window
divided into the Edit Task Pane, Menu Editor, and Production Editor. From
there, you can make any necessary changes that you noted when previewing
the titles in the project, or, if everything looks good, you can burn the DVD
project to CD or DVD disc.
Burning DVD Projects to Disc
After you preview your DVD project and make any necessary last-minute
changes to it, you’re ready to burn it to disc. The procedure for burning your
DVD projects to CD or DVD disc (depending upon the project type — see
“Launching DVD Builder and Selecting Your DVD Project” earlier in this chap-
ter for details) with DVD Builder is very much like burning a data disc project
(see Chapter 3) or audio CD or MP3 project (see Chapter 7) with Creator
Classic. 
After saving the finalized DVD project in the program’s native DMSD file
format by choosing File➪Save or File➪Save As and putting a blank CD-R or
DVD-R disc in your computer’s CD or DVD drive, you begin the process by
clicking the Burn button at the far right of the Menu Editor Pane’s toolbar.
DVD Builder then opens the condensed version of the Burn Setup dialog box.
To expand this dialog box and display all the settings for this dialog box (as
shown in Figure 11-12), click the Show Advanced Settings button near the
bottom of the original Burn Setup dialog box.
As you can see in Figure 11-12, by default, the Burn to Disc check box is
selected so that DVD Builder burns your DVD project to the type of disc
called for by the project’s type. If you also want to save the DVD project 
as an image file on your hard disk, click the Save Image File check box and 
then use its Browse button to select the folder into which to save this file 
in the Save Image dialog box. An image file contains the entire contents of
your DVD project and you can burn discs from this file later by using the 
Easy Media Creator’s Creator Classic application (see Chapter 3).
DVD Builder also selects the Finalize Disc check box by default when burning
the project to a DVD-R, DVD+R, or DVD-RAM disc (this check box option is
grayed out when you’re recording to a DVD-RW or DVD+RW disc). When the
Finalize Disc check box contains a checkmark, you cannot later add more
files after you burn your DVD project to disc. Note that you can safely de-
select the Finalize Disc check box option when you intend only to view the
disc in your computer’s drive and want to be able to later add more files to it.
If, however, your intention is to burn a DVD disc for viewing in a standalone
DVD player, you must finalize the DVD-R, DVD+R, or DVD-RAM disc in order
to be able to play it in these types of players.
320
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

The steps for selecting the other burn settings and then burning your project
to disc are as follows:
1. (Optional) If you’ve inserted a rewritable disc that already contains
files into computer’s drive, click the Erase Disc button to remove
these files.
The Erase Disc button is only available when you’re not using a blank
disc and the disc is rewritable. If you’re using a blank disc, you may skip
to Step 2 if you want to review and possibly change any of the settings
for disc’s video quality, audio format, video system, or recording format.
If you don’t want to make any changes to these settings, skip to Step 3.
When making changes to these settings, keep the following things
in mind:
• If the DVD project is DVD or DVD on CD, you can change the Video
Quality settings from the default of Best to Good, Medium, or Low
in order to increase the amount of data compression applied to the
files in your project (while at the same time lowering the visual
Figure 11-12:

your

dialog box.
321
Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

quality of the video and still images). Note that if your project is
set to Video CD, the quality is automatically set to VCD, just as
when the project set to Super Video CD, the program automatically
sets the quality to SVCD. Note that in neither the case of a Video
CD or Super Video CD does DVD Builder enable you to modify its
default Video Quality.
• If the DVD project is DVD or DVD on CD, you can choose between
compressed audio using the LPCM and Dolby Digital AC-3 default
format. If you want the best-quality audio, you can choose the
LPCM audio format on the Audio Format drop-down list. If you
select PAL instead of NTSC as the video system to use in the
Standard drop-down list box, you can also choose MPEG as the
audio format to increase the audio compression even further 
(just be aware that this audio format is not compatible with all
DVD players).
• If the size of your DVD project is greater than the size of the disc
you’re using, you can click the Fit to Disc button beneath the Audio
Format drop-down list box to have DVD Builder select both the
Video Quality and Audio Format settings needed in order to fit all
your titles on the disc (when the project size is less than the total
amount of space available on your disc, this button is grayed out).
• By default, DVD Builder selects NTSC as the video system to use 
in the Standard drop-down list box (NTSC is the system of 29.97
frames per second with 525 individual scan lines used in North
America, Japan, and a good deal of South America. If you’re making
the disc for a European DVD player, you may want to select PAL in
the Standard drop-down list (the standard system of 25 frames per
second with 625 individual scan lines favored in Europe).
• By default, DVD Builder selects the DVD-Video option button as the
default Recording Format setting (which is the standard recording
format for commercial DVDs and is compatible with all types of
DVD players). Select the +VR option button to select the DVD+RW
Video Recording Format to create a disc that can be edited by a
DVD+RW video recorder (just note that +VR playback is not com-
patible with all types of DVD players).
• By default, DVD Builder selects the Save Original Photos to CD
(VCD/SVCD Slideshow Titles Only) check box at the bottom of the
Burn Setup dialog box to copy the still images used in the DVD pro-
ject to a directory on the CD when you burn the project to a disc.
Deselect this check box only if you don’t want the still images
copied in your VCD or SVCD slideshow.
2. Click the Show Advanced Settings button to display the options in 
the Advanced Burn Setup dialog box and then make any necessary
changes to the video quality, audio format, video system, and record-
ing format settings with the associated drop-down list boxes.
322
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

Now you’re ready to close the Burn Setup dialog box and proceed to the
Burn Progress dialog box which keeps you informed of the program’s
progress in encoding and then writing and finalizing all the titles and the
menus in your DVD project to CD or DVD disc.
3. Click the OK button at the bottom of the Burn Setup dialog box to
close it and then open the Burn Progress dialog box which keeps you
informed of its progress in burning the individual titles and menus in
your DVD project to CD or DVD disc.
After DVD Builder finishes burning your DVD project to disc, a DVDBUILDER
dialog box appears that enables you to play your disc using any of the DVD
video and movie playing software programs on your computer (including, of
course, the Windows Media Player). To play the disc, click the program you
want to use to play your disc and then click the OK button. To close this
dialog box without playing the disc, click the Cancel button instead.
After closing the DVDBUILDER dialog box (and the software such as Windows
Media Player, if you chose to play the disc), you are returned to the Burn
Status dialog box (which now shows the Overall Status and Current Operation
as complete). Close this dialog box by clicking its OK button to return to the
DVD Builder window from which you initiated the burn operation.
Regardless of whether you play a newly burned DVD disc in your computer’s
DVD drive using software such as Windows Media Player, you will definitely
want to try playing the new DVD disc in your standalone DVD Player using its
remote control to test out and select the various titles on the disc’s menus.
Note that you can also prepare an adhesive label for your DVD disc and inserts
for its jewel case using Roxio’s Label Creator (as described in Chapter 8). If
you don’t want to take the risk of applying an adhesive label to the disc (see
the end of Chapter 2 for my warning on using adhesive labels on discs), iden-
tify the disc by writing its name with a non-solvent based marker on the label
(what is commonly called the top) side of the disc. Of course, you never, never
write on the bottom, shiny side of the disc, as this is the side the laser reads.
Plug & Burn: From tape to disc in one step
DVD Builder’s Plug & Burn feature enables you to burn your raw, unedited
digital video directly from your camcorder or your TV or VCR connected to
your computer directly to a DVD disc in your computer’s DVD drive. This is 
a great feature for transferring video such as lectures or live entertainment
events (when video recording is not prohibited) where editing is not really
required for the DVD disc.
To use the Plug & Burn feature, connect your camera, TV, or VCR to the com-
puter using the appropriate cable and then insert a blank DVD disc in your
computer’s DVD drive. Then follow these steps:
323
Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

1. Launch DVD Builder and then click the Plug & Burn link in the On-
Disc Options area of the Edit Task Pane.
DVD Builder opens a Plug & Burn dialog box similar to the one shown 
in Figure 11-13. This dialog box contains a preview area with playback
controls below it where you can cue up the frame when recording from 
a video or cassette tape from which you want to begin recording.
By default, DVD Builder captures your video at the best quality using the
Dolby Digital AC-3 compressed audio file format in the NTSC standard
recording format. To modify these settings or the audio recording level
or balance, you open the Capture Settings dialog box by clicking the
Capture Settings button in the Plug & Burn dialog box.
By default, the program burns the video using the DVD-Video recording
format rather than the +VR format, the so-called DVD+RW Video
Recording Format that can be edited by a DVD+RW video recorder. To
change the recording format, open the Burn Settings dialog box and then
click the +VR option button in the Capture Burn Settings dialog box.
2. (Optional) Make any necessary changes in the Capture Settings dialog
box and/or Burn Settings dialog box (opened by clicking the Capture
Settings and Burn Settings buttons, respectively).
Next you need to enter a new name for your DVD disc in the New Title
Name text box.
3. Click the Insertion point in the Next Title Name text box and drag
through the temporary disc name before you begin typing to replace
this text with the name you want the DVD disc to have.
If you’re recording a video or cassette tape and you want to record the
entire tape, you first need to rewind the tape before you click Capture
Entire Tape. If you’re recording from tape and you want to begin record-
ing from a particular frame in the video, you need to use the playback
controls to display this starting frame in the preview area before you
click the Start Capturing button. If you’re recording from your TV tuner,
you need to select the right channel before you click the Start Capturing
button.
4. If recording a video or cassette tape, find the frame in the tape where
you want to start recording (this is the first frame if you want to
record the whole tape) and then click the Start Capturing or Capture
Entire Tape button. If recording from your TV tuner, select the right
channel and then click the Start Capturing button.
As soon as you click the Start Capturing button, it becomes a Stop
Capturing button. If you want to pause the video capture (either to miss
a commercial break or find a new place in the tape), click the Stop
Capture button. Then, when you want to restart the recording (after the
break or when you’ve cued the tape), click the Capture Again button
(which replaces the Stop Capture button as soon as you click it). Note
324
Part IV: Creating Projects for DVDs 

that each time you click Start Capture after stopping it, DVD Builder cre-
ates a new title for the disc.
5. As soon as you finish recording your video, click the Close button at
the bottom of the Plug & Burn dialog box.
As soon as you click the Close button to close the Plug & Burn dialog box,
DVD Builder displays the Burn Status dialog box which keeps you informed of
the program’s progress as it begins burning your captured video to the DVD
disc in your computer’s drive. As soon as the program finishes burning all the
titles, the DVDBUILDER dialog box appears where you can select a software
program such as Windows Media Player to play your disc.
After you close the playback software program or click the Cancel button in
the DVD BUILDER dialog box, you still need to click the OK button in the Burn
Status dialog box to close it. The program returns you to the DVD Builder
window where the title saved on disc appears in the Production Editor pane.
You can then close the DVD Builder window or start a new DVD project by
choosing File➪New on the menu bar or open an existing project for further
editing by choosing File➪Open or File➪Open Recent and then selecting the
DMSD file to open.

Chapter 11: Building and Burning DVDs

Editing a rewritable DVD disc
DVD Builder enables you to edit the contents of a DVD project on a DVD-R,
DVD+R, or DVD-RAM disc that has not been finalized or on any DVD-RW 
or DVD+RW (you can always edit the titles on these types of rewritable discs
provided that they are not already full of data). To edit a DVD project, you
insert the DVD disc in your computer’s DVD drive, launch DVD Builder, and
then click the Edit DVD Disc link at the bottom of the On-Disc Options in the
Edit Task Pane. Select the drive with the DVD disc in the Disc to Record To
drop-down list box in the Edit DVD Disc dialog box and then click the OK
button.
DVD Builder then opens the DVD project in the DVD Builder window where
you can use any of its editing features to create additional titles (provided
that there’s sufficient free disc space) or edit the contents of the existing
titles. When you finish editing the DVD project, save the changes to the pro-
ject by choosing File➪Save or File➪Save As (if you want to retain the original
unedited DVD project on your hard disk) on the DVD Builder menu bar and
then click the Burn button at the far right of the Menu Editor pane’s toolbar
or choose File➪Burn on the menu bar.
The Burn Status dialog box opens, showing you the progress while the edited
DVD project is burned to the DVD disc. When the program finishes burning
the updated project, click the OK button to close the Burn Status dialog box
and return to the DVD Builder window.

A
s you soon discover when you start using Easy Media Creator 7, it’s
more like a combo of different mini-programs than a single software pro-
gram. This chapter looks at each of the top ten modules in the Easy Media
Creator suite, with an eye toward its basic functions and features. Use this
list to get the lowdown on each of the major applications and tools that you
use to collect, organize, and create cool projects using all the different forms
of digital media: audio, still image, and video.
Roxio Disc Copier
Roxio Disc Copier is the application to use when you need to duplicate the
CD and DVDs that you create and burn with the other Easy Media Creator
components including Creator Classic and DVD Builder. In addition, you can
use this nifty program to make backup copies of non-protected the commer-
cially produced CDs and DVDs.

The greatest thing about this program is that you don’t need to have two CD or
DVD drives on your computer in order to make your copies: Disc Copier can
make backups using one CD or DVD drive by temporarily copying the disc files
from the original CD or DVD disc to your hard disk and then copying these files
from the hard disk onto a new CD or DVD disc that you put in the same drive.
You can access this program from the Easy Media Creator Home by clicking
any of the four following links:
 Copy Audio CD in the Music column
 Copy Data Disc in Data column
 Copy DVD in the DVD column
 Disc Copier
See Chapters 3 and 8 for details on using Disc Copier to make backup copies
of data and audio CDs.
Audio and Data Discs Thanks
to Creator Classic
Creator Classic is the place to go when you need to compile diverse data or
music files into a single project. You can then use Creator Classic to burn CD
or DVD discs from the data or audio media files you add to your particular
projects. 
Creator Classic supports the creation of data backup discs from Data Disc
projects as well as standard Audio CDs from Audio CD projects and the more-
and-more popular MP3 discs from MP3 Disc Projects. In addition, you can use
Creator Classic to create two different kinds of special projects that mix data
and audio. You can burn Enhanced CDs that combine data and audio in sepa-
rate sessions that can be played in any CD player or CD-ROM drive (CD players
play only the music tracks in the later sessions, while CD-ROM can read both
the data in the first session and the audio files in the later sessions) from
Enhanced CD Projects. You can also burn Mixed-CDs that combine data and
audio in a single session that can only be played in your computer’s CD-ROM
or DVD drive with software programs like Windows Media Player from Mixed
Mode CD Projects.
When creating audio CDs, Creator Classic makes it easy to obtain track,
artist, and album information from the Gracenote CD online database. You
can also use Creator Classic’s features to edit the tracks that you add to your
audio project, including merging different tracks into one as well as adding
transitions between them.

Getting the Media You
Need with Capture
The Capture utility enables you to acquire digital media files from both digital
and analog sources connected to your computer. You can use Capture to
acquire still images from scanners and digital cameras connected to your
computer. You can also use Capture to acquire digital video directly from
your digital camcorder or from an analog device such as your VCR connected
to your computer. And if that’s not enough for you, you can use Capture to
acquire audio files from audio CDs in your computer’s CD-ROM or DVD drive,
as live audio using a microphone, or from other some other analog playback
device such as a record player or audio cassette player connected to your
computer. And finally, you can use Capture to acquire individual movie titles
from unencrypted DVD discs (usually the ones you create with DVD Builder)
that you put in your computer’s DVD drive.
To launch Capture from the Easy Media Creator Home, you can click any of
the following links:
 Import Photos in the Photo column
 Capture Video in the Video column
 Capture in the Tools column
331
Chapter 12: Top Ten Components of Easy Media Creator 7

To get detailed information on using Capture to acquire any of the previously
mentioned types of digital media, see Chapter 9.
Audio Recording and Editing
with Sound Editor
The Sound Editor tool enables you to record audio from various digital and
analog audio devices connected to your computer and to edit audio files that
you’ve already acquired. In addition, you can use Sound Editor to convert
one type of audio file into another (for example, if you have an audio file
saved in the uncompressed WAV audio file format that you want to add to an
MP3 Disc Project that you’re preparing with Creator Classic). You can open it
in Sound Editor and then convert it to a compressed MP3 file (after selecting
the audio quality and the amount of compression).
When it comes to editing audio files, Sound Editor not only enables you to
trim the audio file, add fade-in and fade-out effects at the beginning and end,
and adjust the overall volume, but it also enables you to insert or remove
silences in a recording, add track breaks, as well as enhance the audio using
any of a number of useful and some not so useful but zany and fun special
effects.
To launch the Sound Editor from the Easy Media Creator Home, click the
Sound Editor link in the Tool column. For detailed information about using
Sound Editor to both record and edit audio files, see Chapter 5.
Disc Labeling with Label Creator
Label Creator is a really fun and surprisingly efficient utility for designing and
printing labels and jewel case inserts for the CD and DVD discs you create
with its Creator Classic and DVD Builder applications. Label Creator makes
short work of the design end of the process by offering you a wide variety of
disc label and jewel case inserts to choose from. In addition, its Auto-Fill fea-
ture enables you to automatically obtain the track, artist, and album informa-
tion for audio CDs and volume information for data discs.
After designing your disc labels and jewel case inserts, you can use Label
Creator to print out labels either on plain paper, specially prepared adhesive
disc label, or even directly on your disc as well as on perforated case insert
paper. The utility also makes it easy to make any necessary printing adjust-
ments to get the label and case inserts to print just where you want them on
the page.
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

To launch Label Creator from the Easy Media Creator Home, click the Label
Creator link in the Tools column. You can also launch this utility from the
Burn Progress dialog box when burning a CD or DVD disc with Creator Classic
by clicking the Start Label Creator button. For complete information on using
the Label Creator, see Chapter 8.
Getting Your Media Organized
with Media Manager
Media Manager is a godsend when it comes to managing all the different files
of different media types that you end up using with the projects you create
with the various Easy Media Creator applications. Among the most useful of
its features are its media collections. Collections are special files that gather
together whatever media files you add to them without requiring you to
physically locate the files together in the same file folder on your hard disk.
Because collections don’t require you to physically relocate the media files
they contain, you can make the same media file (such as a company logo or
often-used audio track) a part of as many different collections as you want.
Whenever you open a particular collection in the Media Manager window, all
of its files are available to you without your having to pay any attention to
where in the world they’re actually located on computer system.
In addition to organizing your media files into collections, Media Manager
also makes it easy to find specific media files by tagging them with keywords,
textual comments, and sound tags. You can then later use Media Manager’s
Search feature to quickly and easily find media files that contain the same
keyword or commentary text. Media Manager also makes it easy to back up
your media files on disc using the same burn engine as Creator Classic.
You can launch Media Manager from the Easy Media Creator Home by click-
ing the Media Manager link at the top of the Tools column. To get detailed
information on using Media Manager’s cool features for organizing your
media files, see Chapter 4.
Enhancing and Organizing Digital
Photos with PhotoSuite
PhotoSuite provides multipurpose editing for your digital photos. In addition
to being able to make enhancements that fix flaws such as redeye, over- and
under-exposure, and blurriness, you can also do standard editing such as
rotating, cropping, and resizing images. PhotoSuite also has tools that enable
333
Chapter 12: Top Ten Components of Easy Media Creator 7

you to annotate your photos by adding text and to retouch them by painting
and drawing on them. 
Beyond these very useful but very typical photo editing features, PhotoSuite
offers some really exciting and unusual ones. The program makes it easy to
superimpose multiple photos on top of one another to create photo montages.
The program also offers several different project templates for placing your
photos in projects such as photo collages, greeting cards, gift tags, postcards,
and calendars. Last but not least, PhotoSuite contains a Photo Stitch feature
that enables you to create sweeping panoramas from multiple individual
photos that pan a landscape and overlap one another.
Of course, the program makes short work of printing photos, either individu-
ally, in groups, or even as contact sheets. PhotoSuite also makes it easy to
share your edited photos with friends and family by sending them as e-mail
attachments or by uploading them to the Roxio Photo Center.
To launch PhotoSuite from the Easy Media Creator Home, you can click any
of the following links:
 Edit and Fix Photos in the Photo column to launch PhotoSuite and dis-
play the Open dialog box where you can select the photo file to edit
 E-mail Photos in the Photo column to launch PhotoSuite and open the 
E-mail pane in its program window
 Create Greeting Card in the Photo column to launch PhotoSuite and
open the Create a Project pane in its program window
 PhotoSuite in the Applications column to simply open the PhotoSuite
program
For complete information on using PhotoSuite to enhance your photos or in
any of its photo editing projects, see Chapter 6.
Easy Video Editing with VideoWave
VideoWave is one of the most amazing digital editing programs available for
personal computers. It combines an easy-to-use interface and a couple of
step-by-step wizards with sophisticated video editing features and the option
between editing the production in its default Storyline or new Timeline mode.
VideoWave enables you to add background audio or actually narrate your
production in real time. The program also offers you a choice among a wide
variety of scene transitions along with a good assortment of text, overlay, and
filter effects. In addition, VideoWave contains a powerful Motions Pictures
effect that enables you to pan and zoom around still images (giving them the
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

illusion of motion) and video clips (enabling you to focus on the action within
the frames).
When you complete the editing of your video production, VideoWave makes
it easy to output your finished movie to whatever format suits your needs, be
that showing the movie on your computer with the Windows Media Player,
uploading it to the Internet for viewing on the Web, sending it to an external
device such as your VCR or digital video camera, or even sending it as an
e-mail attachment.
To launch VideoWave from the Easy Media Creator Home, you can click any
of the following links:
 Edit Video in the Video column to launch VideoWave and open a new
production in Storyline mode
 Create Slideshow in the Photo column to launch VideoWave and start a
Storyboard production
 Auto Edit with CineMagic in the Video column to launch VideoWave and
start the CineMagic wizard
 Guided Edit with StoryBuilder in the Video column to launch
VideoWave and start the StoryBuilder wizard
 VideoWave in the Applications column to launch VideoWave and open a
new production in Storyline mode
For details on using VideoWave, refer to Chapter 10.
Creating and Burning DVD Projects
with DVD Builder
The DVD Builder application enables you to assemble your digital video and
still images into DVD projects that you can then burn to CD or DVD disc com-
plete with menus for viewing in standalone DVD players or in your computer’s
DVD drive. DVD Builder makes it easy to assemble your media in finished
productions using readymade themes that you can easily customize. 
When you’re finished assembling, editing, and previewing your DVD project,
you can then use the program to burn the finished production to disc using
the standard DVD, VCD (Video CD), or SVCD (Super Video CD) formats. In
addition to its powerful tools for assembling DVD projects, DVD Builder also
includes its new Plug & Burn and Edit DVD Disc features. Plug & Burn enables
you to burn your video direct from camcorder or video cassette player to DVD
disc. The Edit DVD disc player enables you to edit the titles on an existing
335
Chapter 12: Top Ten Components of Easy Media Creator 7

DVD disc (which has been neither encrypted nor finalized) and then burn the
changes you make using the DVD Builder editing tools onto the disc.
To launch DVD Builder from the Easy Media Creator Home, you can click any
of the following links:
 Create New DVD in the DVD column to launch DVD Builder and open
the Project Type dialog box where you select the type of DVD project
to create
 Plug & Burn in the DVD column to launch DVD Builder and open the
Plug & Burn dialog box for burning video tape directly to DVD disc
 DVD Builder in the Applications column to launch DVD Builder and
open the Project Type dialog box where you select the type of DVD
project to create
For complete details on using DVD Builder, see Chapter 11.
Copying Files on the Fly 
with Drag-to-Disc
Last but certainly not least is Drag-and-Drop, the program that makes it a
snap to backup media files of any type on disc. All you have to do to start a
backup is put a CD or DVD disc in your computer’s CD-ROM or DVD drive,
drag the icons for the folder or file to backup from the Windows Explorer, and
then drop them on the Drag-to-Disc program icon which you keep on your
Windows desktop at all times when using the computer. The Drag-to-Disc pro-
gram formats the CD or DVD disc if the disc requires it and then proceeds to
copy the files. You can continue to copy files to the disc if there’s still addi-
tional space.
In addition to copying media files to disc on the fly, Drag-and-Drop offers a
nifty little ScanDisc utility that can check your disc for errors and attempt to
repair discs whose files have become unreadable or otherwise corrupted.
To launch Drag-to-Disc (when its program icon doesn’t automatically appear
when you start up Windows) from the Easy Media Creator Home, click the
Drag-to-Disc link in the Applications column. To get more information on
using Drag-to-Disc to backup files, see Chapter 3.

oxio Easy Media Creator 7 sports some very remarkable and definitely
cool features for working with all types of media. This chapter highlights
the ten coolest of the cool with an eye toward how they can help you get your
work done in crack time or, at the very least, have yourself a rocking good
time! As I note, some of these features are brand spanking new to version 7
of this suite, but whether new or old, they are all just plain great to use.
Home Is Where Access to Every Easy
Media Creator Component Is
In Easy Media Creator 7, the new Home module is the be-all and end-all of the
various applications, tools, and utilities. This new module gives you instant

access to all these Easy Media Creator components with its single-click
hyperlinks arranged into the categories of Applications and Tools. In addi-
tion, the Easy Media Creator Home enables you to launch just the module
you need to use by selecting links to common tasks, these task links being
arranged into media categories (Music, Data, Photo, Video, and DVD) along
the top of the Home window.
The Easy Media Creator Home even makes it easy to open projects that
you’ve created (while at the same time launching its associated application
or tool) for further editing by listing all the various types of productions and
projects you’ve worked on in the Recent Projects pane along the bottom of
the Home window.
I guess the best thing about Home is the way that it interconnects Easy Media
Creator’s diverse components. By launching different applications and tools
using its links, you’re assured that you’ll return Home the moment you exit
the program or utility that you launched. This gives you the opportunity to
then launch the next module that you may need in the editing process. In any
case, launching and then returning to the Easy Media Creator Home gives 
you a much better sense of how all its diverse components come together to
make almost any type of media editing possible. See Chapter 1 for more on
using the Easy Media Creator Home module.
Napster at Your Service
I’m definitely no rapster, but when it comes to downloading and streaming
audio from the Internet it just has to be Napster. This Napster is not the much
maligned pirates’ cove of free music downloads but has been reborn as a
great online music service where you can sample and then purchase almost
any genre of music. Best yet is the Napster Premium Service. For $9.95 a
month, this subscriber service (which I’m using to listen a favorite playlist
even as I write this paean) enables you to stream and download almost any
tune in its enormous music database to your computer for your listening
enjoyment (you have to purchase the tracks if you want to be able to burn
them to audio CDs using Easy Media Creator’s Creator Classic program).
If you have a MP3 portable player, you can download the Napster tunes you
purchase directly to your player already organized in playlists. If you want 
to make an audio CD out of the tunes you buy, you can burn the CD directly
from Napster without having to bother with returning to the Easy Media
Creator Home and launching its Creator Classic program (both Napster 
and Creator Classic share the same burn engine).
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Easy Media Creator Home gives you easy access to the Napster program
through either its Download and Stream Music or Napster link. It also enables
you to download and install the Napster program through a single click of the
Napster button in the lower-right corner of the Easy Media Creator window. I
just don’t see how they could make it any easier for you to have and enjoy
your favorite music. 
Videos, Slideshows, and Playlists
to Go with QuickShow
One of my most favorite features in Easy Media Creator 7 is quietly tucked
away in the Media Manager module. This is the QuickShow feature that
enables you to instantly turn a group of video clips, photos, or audio tracks
into impromptu movies, slideshows, or playlists, respectively. All you do to
put on any of these instant shows is open the folder or collection file that
contains the media you want to use. Then select the thumbnails of all the
same media type (video, still image, or audio files) in the Contents area of
Media Manager window and click the Send Selected Items To drop-down list
button on the Contents pane’s toolbar and then click QuickShow.
Media Manager then arranges the selected media files into a show that
Windows displays full screen on your computer. This screen contains a
simple playback controller that you can then use to pause the show, advance
to its next element, or even close to return to the Media Manager window.
QuickShow is not only fun to use but is a great way to put together quick-and-
dirty video sequences to create a kind of instant storyboarding. See the side-
bar in Chapter 4 for more on this cool feature.
Simple to Create Music
and Themed Videos
CineMagic and StoryBuilder are two new fun and easy ways to convert your
digital video into finished productions in no time at all. With CineMagic you
can turn the digital photos or video clips of your favorite vacation into a
music video set to a music track of your own choice. All you have to do is
select the media files and the background music to use in your production
and CineMagic does the rest (making all the editing decisions for you).
339
Chapter 13: Ten Coolest Features in Easy Media Creator 7

With StoryBuilder you can quickly turn the digital photos or video clips of
your child’s last birthday party or your parents’ 25th wedding anniversary
into a themed video. All you have to do is select the digital photos and videos
to include and the category and particular template of video theme you want
to use and StoryBuilder does the rest. Like CineMagic, StoryBuilder makes all
the editing decisions, including what background music to use.
See Chapter 10 for details on creating your own video productions with
CineMagic and StoryBuilder.
More Complex Video Editing
in Timeline Mode
VideoWave 7 adds a new editing mode known as Timeline to its already tried-
and-true Storyline editing mode. When editing your video productions in
Timeline mode, you have more control over your production, including the
ability to add multiple elements (such as background audio, narration, text,
special effects, and overlays) to either the entire video production or just one
of its elements such as a particular video clip or still image that you’ve added
to one of its panels.
In addition, editing in Timeline mode gives you a view of each of the elements
in your video production as they relate to the Timeline ruler. This ruler gives
you the time code for any point in the production and can be instantly
expanded from the current position by simply dragging one its indicators
with the mouse.
Combined with the intuitive Storyline mode, editing in Timeline mode gives
you much finer control over video productions where you want to time and
overlay different elements with great precision. See Chapter 10 for details on
editing your video production in Timeline mode.
Scene Stealing with SmartScan
SmartScan is a real dream come true when it comes to capturing digital
video from your camcorder. Instead of forcing you to manually scan and then
capture each and every scene on your videotape, with SmartScan you can
have VideoWave do all the work. SmartScan will scan your entire videotape
for scene breaks. It then presents each scene with its own thumbnail and
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

time code, enabling you to pick and choose the scenes that you actually want
captured as video clips on your hard drive. 
After selecting the scenes to capture, SmartScan will then automatically
locate these scenes in the videotape and copy them to your hard disk with-
out your having to click another button. For more on this timesaving feature,
see Chapter 9.
Direct From Tape to Disc
with Plug & Burn
Plug & Burn is another one of those wonderful features that you didn’t know
you missed until you got it and then you wondered how you ever did without
it. This little wonder enables you to go directly from videotape to DVD disc
without having to bother with the intermediate step of using a DVD editor
such as DVD Builder. This is perfect for transferring finished video cassettes
to the more durable disc media or for immediately creating DVD discs from
digital videotape that doesn’t need any type editing such as recordings of live
events (for which you have the right to copy, of course!).
All you need to do to use Plug & Burn convert videotape into DVD disc is con-
nect the videotape player or camcorder to your computer, put the DVD disc
in your computer’s DVD drive, and then cue up the place in the tape where
you want to start the recording. If you want to record the entire tape to disc,
all you have to do is click the Capture Entire Tape button in the Plug & Burn
dialog box. For more on using this nifty feature to go from tape to disc in one
step, see Chapter 11.
Easy DVD Disc Copies
In addition to making copies of your audio CDs, you can use Roxio Disc Copier
to make copies of any unencrypted DVD disc (which, of course, includes all
the DVD projects that you burn to DVD disc with DVD Builder). Because Disc
Copier visually displays the video and audio contents of your DVD disc, you
can easily remove any unwanted content from the copy. If you want to make a
duplicate disc, all you have to do to make the copy is switch the original and
blank DVD disc when Disc Copier prompts you to do so. Duplicate discs make
it possible to keep one set on the business site and another off-site just in
case anything goes wrong at the office. 
341
Chapter 13: Ten Coolest Features in Easy Media Creator 7

Direct Editing of Your DVD Discs
Last but not least of the coolest Easy Media Creator features is the ability to
edit the contents of rewritable DVD discs or discs that you didn’t finalize
when originally burning them in DVD Builder. Editing DVD discs enables you
to delete video content that you no longer want as well as add updated video
content. This feature is perfect for editing DVDs created by capturing TV con-
tent through a set-top DVD recorder attached to your set. You, of course, can
also use it to edit DVD discs that you’ve burned from DVD projects created in
DVD Builder. For more on editing DVD discs, see Chapter 11.
