Introduction
A
rabic, the official language of more than 20 coun-
tries, is the mother tongue of more than 300 mil-
lion people. It’s spoken throughout the Middle East, 
from Morocco to Iraq. Also, because Arabic is the 
language of the Koran and Islam, it’s understood by 
more than 1.2 billion people across the world.
Due to recent geopolitical events, Arabic has cata-
pulted to the top of the list of important world lan-
guages. Even in countries where Arabic isn’t the 
official language, people are scrambling to master this 
vital global language.
Arabic Phrases For Dummies is designed to equip you 
with phrases necessary to function in many life situa-
tions, from shopping to visiting the theater. So buckle 
up and enjoy the journey!
About This Book
Arabic Phrases For Dummies is modular in nature; 
every chapter is organized in such a way that you 
don’t have to read the whole book in order to under-
stand the topic that’s discussed. Feel free to jump 
through chapters and sections to suit your specific 
needs. Also, every grammatical and linguistic point is 
explained in plain English so that you can incorporate 
the concept immediately.
There are basically three different types of Arabic: 
Koranic Arabic, local dialects, and Modern Standard 
Arabic:
 
✓ Koranic Arabic is the Arabic used to write the 
Koran, the holy book for Muslims. This form of 
Arabic is very rigid and hasn’t changed much 
since the Koran was written approximately 

2
Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
1,500 years ago. Koranic Arabic is widely used in 
religious circles for prayer, discussions of 
Islamic issues, and serious deliberations. Its 
usage is limited primarily within a strict reli-
gious context. It’s the equivalent of Biblical 
English.
 
✓ The regional dialects are the most informal 
type of Arabic. They tend to fall into three geo-
graphical categories: the North African dialect 
(Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya); the 
Egyptian dialect (Egypt, parts of Syria, Palestine, 
and Jordan); and Gulf Arabic (Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar, and the United Arab 
Emirates). Even though the words are pro-
nounced differently and some of the everyday 
expressions differ dramatically from region to 
region, speakers from different regions can 
understand each other.
 
✓ Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the most 
widely used and understood form of Arabic in 
the world. While it’s not the native language of 
any speaker of Arabic, it’s used in schools, news 
broadcasts, and other formal settings. It’s less 
rigid than Koranic Arabic but more formal than 
the local dialects.
This book focuses on MSA, but I include examples 
from regional dialects as well.
Conventions Used in This Book
Here are a couple key conventions I use throughout 
the book:
 
✓ I present Arabic phrases in transliteration 
(Arabic sounds represented with English char-
acters). You can see the Arabic alphabet in 
Chapter 1.
 
✓ Throughout the book, each new Arabic word 
appears in boldface. It’s followed by its pronun-
ciation and its English translation in parentheses.

Foolish Assumptions
In writing Arabic Phrases For Dummies, I made the fol-
lowing assumptions about my readers:
 
✓ You’ve had little or no exposure to the Arabic 
language, or else you’ve been exposed to Arabic 
but need to brush up on your language skills.
 
✓ You’re interested in mastering Arabic for either 
personal or professional reasons.
 
✓ You want to be able to speak a few words and 
phrases now so that you can communicate 
basic information in Arabic.
Icons Used in This Book
To help you get in and get out of this book easily and 
efficiently, I use icons that identify important pieces 
of information by category. The following icons 
appear in this book:
 
When you see this icon, read carefully. It 
points to information that will directly 
improve your Arabic language skills.
 
I use this icon to bring your attention to 
information that you definitely want to keep 
in mind when studying and practicing Arabic.
 
Even though this isn’t a grammar book, it 
does include important grammar lessons you 
need to be aware of. This icon is attached to 
major grammar points that will help you 
learn and use the Arabic language.
 
This icon points out nonverbal methods of 
communication common in Arabic-speaking 
countries and among Arabic speakers. I use 
this icon to fill the gap between language and 
culture so that you know the cultural con-
texts in which you can use newly discovered 
words and phrases.

Where to Go from Here
Go ahead and start anywhere. You don’t have to go 
in a specific order. Just choose a topic that seems 
appealing, find the corresponding chapter in the table 
of contents, and start learning Arabic!
But if you’ve never taken Arabic before, you may want 
to read Chapters 1 and 2 before tackling the later 
chapters. They give you some basics, such as how to 
pronounce the sounds.

arHaba (mahr-hah-bah; welcome) to the won-
derful world of Arabic! In this chapter, I ease 
you into the language by showing you some familiar 
English words that trace their roots to Arabic. You 
discover the Arabic alphabet and its beautiful letters, 
and I give you tips on how to pronounce those letters.
Part of exploring a new language is discovering a new 
culture and a new way of looking at things, so in this 
first chapter of Arabic Phrases For Dummies, you begin 
your discovery of Arabic and its unique characteristics.
Taking Stock of What’s Familiar
If English is your primary language, part of grasping 
a new lougha (loo-ghah; language) is creating con-
nections between the kalimaat (kah-lee-maht; words) 
of the lougha, in this case Arabic and English. You 
may be surprised to hear that quite a few English 
words trace their origins to Arabic. For example, did 
you know that “magazine,” “candy,” and “coffee” are

As you can see from the table, Arabic has had a major 
influence on the English language. Some English 
words such as “admiral” and “arsenal” have an indi-
rect Arabic origin, whereas others, such as “coffee” 
and “cotton,” are exact matches. The influence runs 
the other way, too, especially when it comes to rela-
tively contemporary terms. For example, the word 
tilifizyuun (tee-lee-fee-zee-yoon; television) comes 
straight from the word “television.”
Discovering the Arabic Alphabet
Unlike English and other Romance languages, you 
write and read Arabic from right to left. Like English, 
Arabic has both vowels and consonants, but the 
vowels in Arabic aren’t actual letters. Rather, Arabic 
vowels are symbols that you place on top of or below 
consonants to create certain sounds. As for conso-
nants, Arabic has 28 different consonants, and each 
one is represented by a letter. In order to vocalize 
these letters, you place a vowel above or below the 
particular consonant. For example, when you put a 
fatHa, a vowel representing the “ah” sound, above 
the consonant representing the letter “b,” you get the 
sound “bah.” When you take the same consonant and 
use a kasra, which represents the “ee” sound, you get 
the sound “bee.”
All about vowels
Arabic has three main vowels. Luckily, they’re very 
simple to pronounce because they’re similar to 
English vowels. However, it’s important to realize 
that Arabic also has vowel derivatives that are as 
important as the main vowels. These vowel deriva-
tives fall into three categories: double vowels, long 
vowels, and diphthongs. In this section, I walk you 
through all the different vowels, vowel derivatives, 
and vowel combinations.
Main vowels
The three main Arabic vowels are:

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
8
 
✓ fatHah: The first main vowel in Arabic is called 
a fatHa (feht-hah). A fatHa is the equivalent of 
the short “a” in “hat” or “cat.” Occasionally, a 
fatHa also sounds like the short “e” in “bet” or 
“set.” Much like the other vowels, the way you 
pronounce a fatHa depends on what consonants 
come before or after it. In Arabic script, the 
fatHa is written as a small horizontal line above 
a consonant. In English transcription, which I 
use in this book, it’s simply represented by the 
letter “a,” as in the words kalb (kah-leb; dog) or 
walad (wah-lahd; boy).
 
✓ damma: The second main Arabic vowel is the 
damma (dah-mah). A damma sounds like the 
“uh” in “foot” or “book.” In Arabic script, it’s 
written like a tiny backward “e” above a particu-
lar consonant. In English transcription, it’s rep-
resented by the letter “u,” as in funduq 
(foon-dook; hotel) or suHub (soo-hoob; clouds).
 
✓ kasra: The third main vowel in Arabic is the 
kasra (kahs-rah), which sounds like the long “e” 
in “feet” or “treat.” The kasra is written the same 
way as a fatHa — as a small horizontal line — 
except that it goes underneath the consonant. In 
English transcription, it’s written as an “i,” as in 
bint (bee-neht; girl) or ‘islaam (ees-lahm; Islam).
Double vowels
One type of vowel derivative is the double vowel, 
which is known in Arabic as tanwiin (tahn-ween). The 
process of tanwiin is a fairly simple one: Basically, 
you take a main vowel and place the same vowel 
right next to it, thus creating two vowels, or a double 
vowel. The sound that the double vowel makes 
depends on the main vowel that’s doubled. Here are 
all possible combinations of double vowels:
 
✓ Double fatHa: tanwiin with fatHa creates the 
“an” sound, as in ‘ahlan wa sahlan (ahel-an wah 
sahel-an; Hi).
 
✓ Double damma: tanwiin with damma creates 
the “oun” sound. For example, kouratoun (koo-
rah-toon; ball) contains a double damma.

 Chapter 1: I Say It How? Speaking Arabic
9
 
✓ Double kasra: tanwiin with kasra makes the 
“een” sound, as in SafHatin (sahf-hah-teen; page).
Long vowels
Long vowels are derivatives that elongate the main 
vowels. Think of the difference between long vowels 
and short (main) vowels in terms of a musical beat, 
and you should be able to differentiate between them 
much more easily. If a main vowel lasts for one beat, 
then its long vowel equivalent lasts for two beats. 
Whereas you create double vowels by writing two 
main vowels next to each other, you create long 
vowels by adding a letter to one of the main vowels. 
Each main vowel has a corresponding consonant that 
elongates it. Here are a few examples to help you get 
your head around this long-vowel process:
 
✓ To create a long vowel form of a fatHa, you 
attach an ‘alif to the consonant that the fatHa is 
associated with. In English transcription, the 
long fatHa form is written as “aa,” such as in 
kitaab (kee-taab; book) or baab (bahb; door). 
The “aa” means that you hold the vowel sound 
for two beats as opposed to one.
 
✓ The long vowel form of damma is obtained by 
attaching a waaw to the consonant with the 
damma. This addition elongates the vowel “uh” 
into a more pronounced “uu,” such as in nuur 
(noohr; light) or ghuul (ghoohl; ghost). Make 
sure you hold the “uu” vowel for two beats and 
not one.
 
✓ To create a long vowel form of a kasra, you 
attach a yaa’ to the consonant with the kasra. 
Just as the ‘alif elongates the fatHa and the 
waaw elongates the damma, the yaa’ elongates 
the kasra. Some examples include the “ii” in 
words like kabiir (kah-beer; big) and Saghiir 
(sah-gheer; small).
The Arabic characters for the long vowels are shown 
in Table 1-2.

Diphthongs
Diphthongs in Arabic are a special category of vowels 
because, in essence, they’re monosyllabic sounds that 
begin with one vowel and glide into another vowel. A 
common example in English is the sound at the end of 
the word “toy.” Fortunately, Arabic has only two diph-
thong sounds used to distinguish between the yaa’ and 
the waaw forms of long vowels. When you come across 
either of these two letters, one of the first questions to 
ask yourself is: “Is this a long vowel or a diphthong?” 
There’s an easy way to determine which is which: 
When either the yaa’ or the waaw is a diphthong, you 
see a sukun (soo-koon) above the consonant. A sukun 
is similar to the main vowels in that it’s a little symbol 
(a small circle) that you place above the consonant. 
However, unlike the vowels, you don’t vocalize the 
sukun — it’s almost like a silent vowel. So when a 
waaw or yaa’ has a sukun over it, you know that the 
sound is a diphthong. Here are some examples:
 
✓ waaw diphthongs: yawm (yah-oom; day); nawm 
(nah-oom; sleep); Sawt (sah-oot; noise)
 
✓ yaa’ diphthongs: bayt (bah-yet; house); ‘ayn (ah-
yen; eye); layla (lah-ye-lah; night)
All about consonants
Arabic uses 28 different consonants, and each conso-
nant is represented by a different letter. Because the 
Arabic alphabet is written in cursive, most of the letters 
connect with each other. For this reason, every single 
letter that represents a consonant actually can be writ-
ten four different ways depending on its position in a 
word — whether it’s in the initial, medial, or final posi-
tion, or whether it stands alone. In English transcription 
of the Arabic script, all letters are case-sensitive.

Thankfully, most of the consonants in Arabic have 
English equivalents. Unfortunately, a few Arabic con-
sonants are quite foreign to nonnative speakers. Table 
1-3 shows all 28 Arabic consonants, how they’re writ-
ten in Arabic, how they’re transcribed in English, and 
how they sound.

exotic Arabic sounds is repetition, repetition, and 
even more repetition!

 Chapter 1: I Say It How? Speaking Arabic

Tackling Tough Letters 
and Words
In this section, I help you focus on pronunciation of 
difficult letters. Here are some difficult letters and 
some related words you should familiarize yourself 
with:
 
✓ Haa’: Hamraa’ (hahm-raah; red); Hassan (hah-
san; man’s name); Hiwaar (hee-war; conversa-
tion); Haziin (hah-zeen; sad)
 
✓ ‘ayn: ‘ajiib (ah-jeeb; amazing); ‘aziima (ah-zee-
mah; determination); ‘ariiD (ah-reed; wide)
 
✓ qaaf: qif (kee-f; stop); qird (kee-red; monkey); 
qaws (qah-wes; bow)
 
✓ ghayn: ghaDbaan (ghad-bahn; angry); ghurfa 
(ghoor-fah; room); ghadan (ghah-dan; tomorrow)
 
The difference between native Arabic 
speakers and nonnatives is enunciation. So 
your challenge is to enunciate your letters 
clearly — particularly the more difficult 
ones. Practice these words over and over 
until you feel comfortable repeating them 
quickly and distinctly.
Addressing Arabic Transcription
The transcription I use in this book is a widely used 
and universally recognized method of transcrib-
ing Arabic to English. Students of Arabic across the 
United States and around the world use this method. 
It’s very helpful for beginners because it allows you to 
speak the language without actually knowing how to 
read Arabic script.

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
16
In the transcription method used in this book, every 
letter in Arabic is represented by a letter in Roman 
script. It’s important to note that this method is case-
sensitive, which means that a lowercase Roman letter 
represents a different letter in the Arabic script than 
a capital Roman letter.
 
Transcription is a very helpful tool for begin-
ners, but it’s recommended that intermedi-
ate and advanced students of Arabic master 
the fundamentals of the Arabic script.

Introducing Nouns, Adjectives, 
and Articles
Nouns name a person, place, thing, quality, or action. 
Adjectives modify nouns. Although nouns and adjec-
tives go hand in hand, the best way to understand 
how they work in Arabic is to address each one 
separately.

Getting a grip on nouns
In Arabic, every noun has a masculine, feminine, sin-
gular, and plural form. Table 2-1 lists some common 
Arabic nouns. You’ll notice that I’ve listed both singu-
lar and plural forms of some nouns, as well as mascu-
line (M) and feminine (F) forms of others.

Notice that all you do is add the suffix -a to the mas-
culine adjective to obtain its feminine form. This rule 
applies to all regular adjective forms.
 
One of the biggest differences between 
adjective and noun interactions in the 
English and Arabic languages is that nouns 
in Arabic come before the adjectives. In 
English, nouns always come after their 
adjectives.
Discovering definite and indefinite 
articles (and the sun and moon)
A common trait that nouns and adjectives share 
in the Arabic language is that both can be modi-
fied using definite article prefixes. To refresh your 
memory, an article is a part of speech that you use to 
indicate nouns or adjectives and specify their applica-
tions. In English, there are two types of articles: indef-
inite and definite. The indefinite articles in English 

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
20
are “a” and “an,” such as in “a book” or “an umbrella.” 
The definite article is the word “the,” as in “the book” 
or “the umbrella.”
Unlike English, Arabic has no outright indefinite 
article; instead, the indefinite article in Arabic is 
always implied. For example, when you say kitaab 
(kee-tab; book), you mean both “book” and “a book.” 
Similarly, madrasa (mad-rah-sah; school) means 
both “school” and “a school.” However, Arabic does 
employ a definite article, which is the prefix you 
attach to either the noun or the adjective you want 
to define.
The rule
The definite article in Arabic is the prefix al-. 
When you want to define a noun or adjective, 
you simply attach this prefix to the word. For 
example, “the book” is al-kitaab, and “the school” 
is al-madrasa.
The inevitable exceptions
 
Sometimes, the “l” in the prefix al- drops off 
and is replaced by a letter identical to the 
first letter of the word being defined. For 
example, the word nuur (noor) means 
“light” in Arabic. If you want to say “the 
light,” you say an-nuur (ah-noor), replacing 
the “l” in al- with the first letter of the defi-
nite word.
So how do you know whether to use al- or another 
definite article prefix format? The answer’s really 
cool. Every single letter in Arabic falls into one of 
two categories: sun letters and moon letters. Every 
word that begins with a moon letter gets the prefix 
al-, and every word that begins with a sun letter 
gets the prefix a- followed by its sun letter. Table 2-3 
lists all the sun letters. Every other letter in Arabic 
is automatically a moon letter.

 Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
21
Understanding the interaction 
between nouns and adjectives
In Arabic, the way you pair up nouns and adjectives 
creates definite and indefinite phrases.
Indefinite phrases
To create an indefinite phrase, all you do is take an 
undefined noun and add to it an undefined adjective. 
For example, to say “a big book” or “big book,” you add 
the adjective kabiir (kah-beer; big) to the noun kitaab 
(kee-tab; book). So the phrase kitaab kabiir means “a 
big book” in Arabic. Here are some other examples:
 
✓ walad Tawiil (wah-lad tah-weel; a tall boy)
 
✓ bint jamiila (bee-net jah-mee-lah; a pretty girl)
 
✓ Taawila Hamraa’ (tah-wee-lah ham-rah; a red 
table)

Adding more descriptive words to the noun is very 
simple: Because adjectives follow the noun in Arabic, 
you just add an extra adjective and you’re done! But 
don’t forget to add the conjunction wa (wah; and) 
between the adjectives. Check out some examples:
 
✓ walad Tawiil wa kabiir (wah-lad tah-weel wah 
kah-beer; a tall and big boy)
 
✓ bint Tawiila wa jamiila (bee-net tah-wee-lah wah 
jah-mee-lah; a tall and pretty girl)
 
✓ Taawila Hamraa’ wa qaSiira (tah-wee-lah ham-
rah wah qah-see-rah; a red and short table)
Definite phrases
The biggest difference between creating an indefinite 
phrase and a definite phrase is the use of the definite 
article prefix al-. Both noun and adjective must be 
defined using the definite article prefix. For example, 
to say “the big book,” you say al-kitaab al-kabiir. 
Here are some examples of definite phrases:
 
✓ al-walad aT-Tawiil (al-wah-lad ah-tah-weel; the 
big boy)
 
✓ al-bint al-jamiila (al-bee-net al-jah-mee-lah; the 
pretty girl)
 
✓ aT-Taawila al-Hamraa’ (ah-tah-wee-lah al-ham-
rah; the red table)
Using similar patterns, you can create a defined 
phrase using multiple adjectives. Just like in indefi-
nite phrases, make sure you use the conjunction wa 
between adjectives:
 
✓ al-walad aT-Tawiil wa al-kabiir (al-wah-lad ah-
tah-weel wah al-kah-beer; the tall and big boy)
 
✓ al-bint aT-Tawiila wa al-jamiila (al-bee-net ah-
tah-wee-lah wah al-jah-mee-lah; the tall and 
pretty girl)
 
✓ aT-Taawila al-Hamraa’ wa al-qaSiira (ah-tah-
wee-lah al-ham-rah wah al-qah-see-rah; the red 
and short table)

 Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
23
Creating Simple, Verb-Free 
Sentences
There are two ways to form sentences in Arabic: You 
can manipulate definite and indefinite nouns and adjec-
tives, or you can pull together nouns, adjectives, and 
verbs.
To be or not to be: Sentences without 
verbs
 
There’s actually no “to be” verb in the Arabic 
language. You create “to be” sentences by 
manipulating indefinite and definite nouns 
and adjectives.
When you put an indefinite noun with an indefinite 
adjective, you create an indefinite phrase. Similarly, 
when you add a definite adjective to a definite noun, you 
end up with a definite phrase. So what happens when 
you combine a definite noun with an indefinite adjec-
tive? This combination — defined noun and undefined 
adjective — produces an “is/are” sentence similar to 
what you get when you use the verb “to be” in English.
Take the defined noun al-kitaab (the book) and add 
to it the indefinite adjective kabiir (big). The resulting 
phrase is al-kitaab kabiir, which means “The book is 
big.” Here are some more examples to illustrate the 
construction of “is/are” sentences:
 
✓ as-sayyaara khadraa’. (ah-sah-yah-rah kad-rah; 
The car is green.)
 
✓ aT-Taaliba dakiiya. (ah-tah-lee-bah dah-kee-yah; 
The student is smart.) (F)
 
✓ al-‘ustaadh Tawiil. (al-oos-taz tah-weel; The pro-
fessor is tall.) (M)
If you want to use additional adjectives in these verb-
free sentences, you simply add the conjunction wa. 
Here are some examples of “is/are” sentences with 
multiple adjectives:

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
24
 
✓ as-sayyaara khadraa’ wa sarii’a. (ah-sah-yah-rah 
kad-rah wah sah-ree-ah; The car is green and fast.)
 
✓ aT-Taaliba dakiiya wa laTiifa. (ah-tah-lee-bah 
dah-kee-yah wah lah-tee-fah; The student is 
smart and nice.) (F)
 
✓ al-‘ustaadh Tawiil wa Sa’b. (al-oos-taz tah-weel 
wah sahb; The professor is tall and difficult.) (M)
This construct is fairly flexible, and if you change the 
nature of one of the adjectives, you radically alter 
the meaning of the jumla (joom-lah; sentence). For 
instance, the examples all show a defined noun with 
two indefinite adjectives. What happens when you 
mix things up and add an indefinite noun to an indefi-
nite adjective and a definite adjective?
Consider the example al-bint SaHiiHa wa qawiiya 
(The girl is healthy and strong). Keep al-bint as a defi-
nite noun but change the indefinite adjective SaHiiHa 
into its definite version, aS-SaHiiHa; also, drop the 
wa, and keep qawiiya as an indefinite adjective. The 
resulting phrase is al-bint aS-SaHiiHa qawiiya, which 
means “The healthy girl is strong.”
You can grasp what’s going on here by dividing the 
terms into clauses: The first clause is the definite 
noun/definite adjective combination al-bint aS-SaHiiHa 
(the healthy girl); the second clause is the indefinite 
adjective qawiiya (strong). Combining these clauses is 
the same as combining a definite noun with an indefi-
nite adjective — the result is an “is/are” sentence. Here 
are more examples to help clear up any confusion 
regarding this concept:
 
✓ as-sayyaara al-khadraa’ sarii’a. (ah-sah-yah-rah 
al-kad-rah sah-ree-ah; The green car is fast.)
 
✓ aT-Taaliba ad-dhakiiya laTiifa. (ah-tah-lee-bah 
ah-dhah-kee-yah lah-tee-fah; The smart student is 
nice.) (F)
 
✓ al-‘ustaadh aT-Tawiil Sa’b. (al-oos-taz ah-tah-
weel sahb; The tall professor is difficult.) (M)

and other types of words, such as adjectives, verbs, 
nouns, or other substantives. Table 2-4 lists the most

✓ al-‘imra’a al-jamiila fii as-sayyaara as-sarii’a. (al-
eem-rah-ah al-jah-mee-lah fee ah-sah-yah-rah ah-sah-

kabiira. (al-koor-see ah-sah-gheer wah-rah-ah ah-
tah-wee-lah al-kah-bee-rah; The small chair is 
behind the big table.)
Using demonstratives and 
forming sentences
A demonstrative indicates the noun that you’re refer-
ring to. Common demonstratives in English are the 
words “this” and “that.” If a demonstrative refers to 
a number of objects (such as “those” or “these”), 
it’s gender-neutral and may be used for both mascu-
line and feminine objects. If you’re using a singular 
demonstrative (“this” or “that”), it must agree with 
the gender of the object being singled out.
Following are demonstratives in the singular format:
 
✓ haadhaa (hah-zah; this) (M)
 
✓ haadhihi (hah-zee-hee; this) (F)
 
✓ dhaalika (zah-lee-kah; that) (M)
 
✓ tilka (teel-kah; that) (F)

 Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
27
Here are the plural demonstratives, which are 
gender-neutral:
 
✓ haa’ulaa’i (hah-oo-lah-ee; these)
 
✓ ‘ulaa’ika (oo-lah-ee-kah; those)
You can combine demonstratives with both definite 
and indefinite nouns and adjectives. For example, to 
say “this boy,” add the definite noun al-walad (boy) 
to the demonstrative haadhaa (this; M); because 
demonstratives always come before the nouns they 
identify, the resulting phrase is haadhaa al-walad. 
Here are more examples of this construct:
 
✓ haadhihi al-bint (hah-zee-hee al-bee-net; this girl)
 
✓ ‘ulaa’ika al-banaat (oo-lah-ee-kah al-bah-nat; 
those girls)
 
✓ haa’ulaa’i al-‘awlaad (hah-oo-lah-ee al-aw-lad; 
these boys)
 
✓ tilka al-‘ustaadha (teel-kah al-oos-tah-zah; that 
professor) (F)
 
✓ dhaalika al-kitaab (zah-lee-kah al-kee-tab; that 
book)
When a demonstrative is followed by a defined noun, 
you get a definite clause, as in the examples in the 
preceding list. However, when you attach an indefi-
nite noun to a demonstrative, the result is an “is/are” 
sentence. For instance, if you add the demonstrative 
haadhaa to the indefinite subject noun walad, you 
get haadhaa walad (hah-zah wah-lad; This is a boy). 
Using the examples from the preceding list, I show 
you what happens when you drop the definite article 
from the subject noun in a demonstrative clause:
 
✓ haadhihi bint. (hah-zee-hee bee-net; This is a 
girl.)
 
✓ ‘ulaa’ika banaat. (oo-lah-ee-kah bah-nat; Those 
are girls.)

✓ haa’ulaa’i ‘awlaad. (hah-oo-lah-ee aw-lad; These 
are boys.)
 
✓ tilka ‘ustaadha. (teel-kah oos-tah-zah; That is a 
professor.) (F)
 
✓ dhaalika kitaab. (zah-lee-kah kee-tab; That is a 
book.)
When you combine a demonstrative clause with a 
definite subject noun and an indefinite adjective, the 
resulting phrase is a more descriptive “is/are” sen-
tence:
 
✓ haadhihi al-bint jamiila. (hah-zee-hee al-bee-net 
jah-mee-lah; This girl is pretty.)
 
✓ ‘ulaa’ika al-banaat Tawiilaat. (oo-lah-ee-kah al-
bah-nat tah-wee-lat; Those girls are tall.)
 
✓ tilka al-madrasa kabiira. (teel-kah al-mad-rah-
sah kah-bee-rah; That school is big.)
Conversely, when you combine a demonstrative 
clause with a definite subject noun and a definite 
adjective, you get a regular demonstrative phrase:
 
✓ haadhaa ar-rajul al-jamiil (hah-zah ah-rah-jool 
al-jah-meel; that handsome man)
 
✓ dhaalika al-kitaab al-‘ajiib (zah-lee-kah al-kee-
tab al-ah-jeeb; that amazing book)
 
✓ tilka al-madiina aS-Saghiira (teel-kah al-mah-
dee-nah ah-sah-ghee-rah; that small city)
Forming “to be” sentences using 
personal pronouns
Personal pronouns stand in for people, places, things, 
or ideas. Table 2-5 presents all the major personal 
pronouns in the Arabic language.

In the translation and conjugation tables in 
this section and throughout this book, in 
addition to singular and plural denotations, 
you see a form labeled dual. This number 
form doesn’t exist in English. It is reserved 
for describing two items (no more, no less).

The personal pronoun always comes before the predi-
cate noun that it designates, and it also creates an “is/
are” sentence. For instance, when you say hiya bint 
(hee-yah bee-net), you mean “She is a girl.” Similarly, 
huwa walad (hoo-wah wah-lad) means “He is a boy.” 
The meaning changes slightly when the subject noun 
is defined. For example, hiya al-bint means “She is the 
girl,” and huwa al-walad means “He is the boy.” Here 
are some more examples:

Creating negative “to be” sentences
Although Arabic doesn’t have a “to be” regular verb 
to create “I am” or “you are” phrases, it does have a 
verb you use to say “I am not” or “you are not.” This 
special irregular verb laysa (lay-sah) creates negative 
“to be” sentences. Table 2-6 shows laysa conjugated 
using all the personal pronouns.

“To be” in the past tense
Arabic’s verb for “was/were” (in other words, “to 
be” in the past tense) is kaana (kah-nah; was/were). 
Similar to the negative form of “to be,” the past form 
is an irregular verb form conjugated using all the per-
sonal pronouns. See Table 2-7.

Working with Verbs
Verb tenses in Arabic are fairly straightforward. 
Basically, you need to be concerned with only two 
proper verb forms: the past and the present. A future 
verb tense exists, but it’s a derivative of the present 
tense that you achieve by attaching a prefix to the 
present tense of the verb.
Digging up the past tense
The structural form of the past tense is one of the eas-
iest grammatical structures in the Arabic language. 
First, you refer to all regular verbs in the past tense 
using the huwa (hoo-wah; he) personal pronoun. 
Second, the overwhelming majority of verbs in huwa 
form in the past tense have three consonants that are 
accompanied by the same vowel: the fatHa (feht-hah). 
The fatHa creates the “ah” sound.
For example, the verb “wrote” in the past tense is 
kataba (kah-tah-bah); its three consonants are “k,” “t,” 
and “b.” Here are some common verbs you may use 
while speaking Arabic:
 
✓ ‘akala (ah-kah-lah; ate)
 
✓ fa’ala (fah-ah-lah; did)
 
✓ ra’a (rah-ah; saw)

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
34
Table 2-8 shows the verb kataba (kah-tah-bah; wrote) 
conjugated using all the personal pronouns. Note that 
the first part of the verb remains constant; only its suffix 
changes depending on the personal pronoun used.

Every personal pronoun has a corresponding suffix 
used to conjugate and identify the verb form in its spe-
cific tense. Table 2-9 outlines these specific suffixes.

Anytime you come across a regular verb you want to 
conjugate in the past tense, use these verb suffixes 
with the corresponding personal pronouns.
Here are some simple sentences that combine nouns, 
adjectives, and verbs in the past tense:
 
✓ ‘al-walad dhahaba ‘ilaa al-madrasa. (al-wah-lad 
zah-hah-bah ee-lah al-mad-rah-sah; The boy went 
to the school.)
 
✓ ‘akalnaa Ta’aam ladhiidh. (ah-kal-nah tah-am 
lah-zeez; We ate delicious food.)
 
✓ dhahaba ar-rajul ‘ilaa al-jaami’a fii as-sayaara. 
(zah-hah-bah ah-rah-jool ee-lah al-jah-mee-ah fee 
ah-sah-yah-rah; The man went to the school in 
the car.)

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
36
Note that some regular verbs have more than three 
consonants, such as:
 
✓ tafarraja (tah-fah-rah-jah; watched)
 
✓ takallama (tah-kah-lah-mah; spoke)
To conjugate them, you keep the first part of the 
word constant and change only the last part of the 
word using the corresponding suffixes to match the 
personal pronouns.
Examining the present tense
Conjugating verbs in the present tense is a bit trick-
ier. Instead of changing only the ending of the verb, 
you must also alter its beginning.
To illustrate the difference between past and present 
tense, Table 2-10 conjugates the verb kataba (wrote) 
as yaktubu (yak-too-boo; to write).

prefixes and suffixes to conjugate verbs in the present 
tense. Table 2-11 includes every personal pronoun

ent tense.

Aside from prefixes and suffixes, another major differ-
ence between the past and present tenses in Arabic is 
that every verb in the present tense has a dominant 
vowel that’s unique and distinctive. For example, the 
dominant vowel in yaktubu is a damma (dah-mah; 
“ooh” sound). However, in the verb yaf’alu (yaf-ah-
loo; to do), the dominant vowel is the fatHa (feht-hah; 
“ah” sound). This means that when you conjugate 
the verb saf’alu using the personal pronoun ‘anaa, 
you say ‘anaa ‘af’alu and not ‘anaa ‘af’ulu. For com-
plete coverage of Arabic vowels (damma, fatHa, and 
kasra), check out Chapter 1.
The dominant vowel is always the middle vowel. 
Unfortunately, there’s no hard rule you can use to 
determine which dominant vowel is associated with 
each verb. The best way to identify the dominant 
vowel is to look up the verb in the qaamuus (qah-
moos; dictionary).

 Chapter 2: Grammar on a Diet: Just the Basics
39
In this list, I divide up some of the most common 
Arabic verbs according to their dominant vowels:
damma
 
✓ yaktubu (yak-too-boo; to write)
 
✓ yadrusu (yad-roo-soo; to study)
 
✓ ya’kulu (yah-koo-loo; to eat)
 
✓ yaskunu (yas-koo-noo; to live)
fatHa
 
✓ yaf’alu (yaf-ah-loo; to do)
 
✓ yaqra’u (yak-rah-oo; to read)
 
✓ yadhhabu (yaz-hah-boo; to go)
 
✓ yaftaHu (yaf-tah-hoo; to open)
kasra
 
✓ yarji’u (yar-jee-oo; to return)
 
✓ ya’rifu (yah-ree-foo; to know)
 
When you conjugate a verb in the present 
tense, you must do two things:
 1. Identify the dominant vowel that will be used 
to conjugate the verb using all personal 
pronouns.
 2. Isolate the prefix and suffix that correspond to 
the appropriate personal pronoun.
Peeking into the future tense
You achieve the future tense by adding the prefix 
sa- to the existing present tense form of the verb. For 
example, yaktubu means “to write.” Add the prefix 
sa- to yaktubu and you get sayaktubu, which means 
“he will write.” Table 2-12 shows how to conjugate 
this verb.

Talking Numbers
Arabic ‘arqaam (ar-qahm; numbers) are part of one of 
the earliest traditions of number notation. But even 
though the Western world’s number system is some-
times referred to as “Arabic numerals,” actual Arabic 
‘arqaam are written differently.
 
You read Arabic numbers from left to right. 
That’s right! Even though you read and write 
Arabic from right to left, you read and write 
Arabic numbers from left to right!

You get the ‘arqaam from ‘iHdaa ‘ashar (11) 
to tis’ata ‘ashar (19) by combining a part of 
‘ashra (10) — specifically ‘ashar (tenth) — 
with part of the singular number. In the case 
of the ‘arqaam from thalaathata ‘ashar (13) 
through tis’ata ‘ashar (19), all you do is add 
the suffix -ta to the regular number and add 
the derivative form ‘ashar.
Table 3-2 shows the ‘arqaam in increments of 10 from 
20 to 100.

Discovering Ordinal Numbers
Ordinal numbers are used to order things in a first-
second-third kind of format. In Arabic, ordinal num-
bers are gender-defined, so you need to be familiar 
with both the masculine and feminine ordinal forms, 
which I present in Table 3-3.

Telling Time in Arabic
If you want to ask someone for the time, you ask
kam as-saa’a? (kam ah-sah-ah; What time is it?)
If someone asks you this question, answer as-saa’a 
followed by the ordinal of the hour. So you would say, 
for instance, “It’s the eleventh hour” as opposed to 
saying “It’s 11 o’clock.” Because as-saa’a is a feminine 
noun, you use the feminine form of the ordinal num-
bers, which are listed in Table 3-4.
as-saa’a al-Haadiya ‘ashra. (ah-sah-ah al-hah-dee-
yah ah-shrah; It’s 11:00.)

You need to use the definite prefix article al- 
with the ordinals because you’re referring to 
a specific hour and not just any hour.

Following are some additional key words related to 
telling time in Arabic:
 
✓ saa’a (sah-ah; hour)
 
✓ daqiiqa (da-kee-qah; minute)
 
✓ thaaniya (thah-nee-yah; second)
 
✓ ba’da (bah-dah; after)
 
✓ qabla (kab-lah; before)
 
✓ al-yawm (al-yah-oum; today)
 
✓ al-ghad (al-ghah-d; tomorrow)
 
✓ al-baariHa (al-bah-ree-hah; yesterday)
 
✓ ba’da al-ghad (bah-dah al-ghah-d; the day after 
tomorrow)
 
✓ qabla al-baariHa (kab-lah al-bah-ree-hah; the 
day before yesterday)
Specifying the time of day
Because Arabic uses neither the a.m./p.m. system 
nor the 24-hour military clock when giving the time, 
you need to specify the time of day by actually saying 
what part of the day it is.
Here are the different times of day you’re likely to use:
 
✓ aS-SabaaH (ah-sah-bah; morning, or sunrise to 
11:59 a.m.)
 
✓ aDH-DHuhr (ah-zoo-her; noon, or 12:00 p.m.)
 
✓ ba’da aDH-DHuhr (bah-dah ah-zoo-her; after-
noon, or 12:01 p.m. to 4:00 p.m.)
 
✓ al-‘asr (al-ah-ser; late afternoon, or 4:01 p.m. to 
sunset)
 
✓ al-masaa’ (al-mah-sah; evening, or sunset to two 
hours after sunset)
 
✓ al-layl (ah-lah-yel; night)

 Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds
47
For example, if the time is 2:00 p.m., then you attach 
ba’da aDH-DHuhr to the proper ordinal. If sunset 
is at 6:00 p.m. and you want to say the time’s 7:00 
p.m., then you use al-masaa’ and the ordinal because 
al-masaa’ applies to the two-hour period right after 
sunset; if sunset is at 6:00 p.m. and you want to say 
the time’s 9:00 p.m., then you use al-layl and the ordi-
nal because 9:00 p.m. falls outside the scope of the 
evening convention.
The convention used to specify the part of the day is 
fairly straightforward:
as-saa’a + ordinal number + fii (fee; in) + part of 
the day
The following are some examples to better illustrate 
responses to the question kam as-saa’a?:
 
✓ as-saa’a al-waaHida fii ba’da aDH-DHuhr. (ah-
sah-ah al-wah-hee-dah fee bah-dah ah-zoo-her; It’s 
1:00 in the afternoon.)
 
✓ as-saa’a al-khaamisa fii al-‘asr. (ah-sah-ah al-kah-
mee-sah fee al-ah-ser; It’s 5:00 in the late 
afternoon.)
 
✓ as-saa’a al-Haadiya ‘ashra fii aS-SabaaH. (ah-
sah-ah al-hah-dee-yah ah-shrah fee ah-sah-bah; 
It’s 11:00 in the morning.)
 
✓ as-saa’a at-taasi’a fii al-layl. (ah-sah-ah ah-tah-
see-ah fee ah-lah-yel; It’s 9:00 in [at] night.)
 
✓ as-saa’a as-saabi’a fii al-masaa’. (ah-sah-ah ah-
sah-bee-ah fee al-mah-sah; It’s 7:00 in the 
evening.)
Specifying minutes
You can specify minutes in two different ways: noting 
the fractions of the hour, such as a half, a quarter, 
and a third, or actually spelling out the minutes.

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
48
When using the fraction method of telling minutes, 
use the following structure:
as-saa’a + ordinal number + wa (wah; and) + 
fraction
So what you’re saying is “It’s the second hour and a 
half,” for example. In English transliteration, that’s the 
equivalent of “It’s half past two.”
The main fractions you use are:
 
✓ an-niSf (ah-nee-sef; half)
 
✓ ath-thuluth (ah-thoo-looth; third)
 
✓ ar-rubu’ (ah-roo-booh; quarter)
 
✓ ‘ashara (ah-sha-rah; tenth)
The following examples show you how to use the frac-
tion method to specify minutes when telling time:
 
✓ as-saa’a ath-thaaniya wa ar-rubu’. (ah-sah-ah 
ah-thah-nee-yah wah ah-roo-booh; It’s quarter 
past two.)
 
✓ as-saa’a at-taasi’a wa an-niSf. (ah-sah-ah ah-tah-
see-ah wah ah-nee-sef; It’s half past nine.)
 
✓ as-saa’a al-khaamisa wa ar-rubu’. (ah-sah-ah 
al-kah-mee-sah wah ah-roo-booh; It’s quarter 
past five.)
 
✓ as-saa’a al-Haadiya ‘ashra wa an-niSf. (ah-sah-
ah al-hah-dee-yah ah-shrah wah ah-nee-sef; It’s 
half past eleven.)
If you want to say “It’s quarter of” or “It’s twenty of”, 
you need to use the preposition ‘ilaa (ee-lah), which 
means “of” or “to.” If you think of the preposition wa 
as adding to the hour, then think of ‘ilaa as subtract-
ing from the hour.
 
Because ‘ilaa subtracts from the hour, you 
must add one hour to whatever hour you’re 
referring to. For example, if you want to say 
“It’s 5:45,” then you must say “It’s quarter of 
six.” Here are some examples that use ‘ilaa:

 Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds
49
 
✓ as-saa’a as-saadisa ‘ilaa ar-rubu’. (ah-sah-ah ah-
sah-dee-sah ee-lah ah-roo-booh; It’s quarter to 
six, or 5:45.)
 
✓ as-saa’a al-waaHida ‘ilaa ath-thuluth. (ah-sah-ah 
al-wah-hee-dah ee-lah ah-thoo-looth; It’s twenty to 
one, or 12:40.)
If you want to express minutes as a fraction and spec-
ify which time of day (a.m. or p.m.), you simply add 
fii and the time of day:
 
✓ as-saa’a ath-thaamina wa ar-rubu’ fii aS-
SabaaH. (ah-sah-ah ah-thah-mee-nah wah ah-roo-
booh fee ah-sah-bah; It’s 8:15 in the morning.)
 
✓ as-saa’a al-khaamisa ‘ilaa ar-rubu’ fii al-’asr. 
(ah-sah-ah al-kah-mee-sah ee-lah ah-roo-booh fee 
al-ah-ser; It’s quarter to five in the late afternoon, 
or 4:45 p.m.)
You can also specify the minutes by actually spelling 
them out. Use the following format:
as-saa’a + ordinal/hours + wa + cardinal/minutes 
+ daqiiqa
So as-saa’a al-khaamisa wa ‘khamsat daqiiqa (ah-sah-
ah al-kah-mee-sah wah kam-sat dah-kee-qah) means 
“It’s 5:05.” Here are some other examples:
 
✓ as-saa’a al-waaHida wa ‘ishriin daqiiqa. (ah-
sah-ah al-wah-hee-dah wah eesh-reen dah-kee-
qah; It’s 1:20.)
 
✓ as-saa’a ath-thaamina wa khamsa wa ‘arba’iin 
daqiiqa fii aS-SabaaH. (ah-sah-ah ah-thah-mee-
nah wah kam-sah wah ar-bah-een dah-kee-qah; 
It’s 8:45 in the morning.)
Referring to Days and Months
The days of the ‘usbuu’ (ooh-seh-booh; week) are 
derived from Arabic numbers. So recognizing the 
roots of the words for days of the week is key:

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
50
 
✓ al-‘aHad (al-ah-had; Sunday)
 
✓ al-‘ithnayn (al-eeth-nah-yen; Monday)
 
✓ ath-thulathaa’ (ah-thoo-lah-thah; Tuesday)
 
✓ al-‘arbi’aa’ (al-ah-reh-bee-ah; Wednesday)
 
✓ al-khamiis (al-khah-mees; Thursday)
 
✓ al-jumu’a (al-joo-moo-ah; Friday)
 
✓ as-sabt (ass-sah-bet; Saturday)
 
al-jumu’a gets its name from jumu’a, which 
means “to gather;” it’s the day when Muslims 
gather at the mosque and pray. Similarly, as-
sabt is the day of rest, similar to the Jewish 
Sabbath.
Arabs use different types of calendars to note the pas-
sage of time, including these two:
 
✓ The Gregorian calendar is basically the same 
calendar as the one used throughout the 
Western world.
 
✓ The Islamic calendar is based on the lunar cycle 
and has different names for the months than its 
Western counterpart. It is based entirely on the 
moon’s rotations and is used to identify specific 
religious holidays, such as the end and beginning 
of the holy month of Ramadan, in which Muslims 
fast from the break of dawn until dusk.
Tables 3-5 and 3-6 show the ash-hur (ah-shuh-hur; 
months) in the Gregorian and Islamic calendars.

calendar, making it difficult to match the months with 
the Gregorian ones.
To specify a date, such as December fifth, use the ordi-
nal number. Because the terms for months are mascu-
line, you must use masculine ordinals to identify specific 
dates. For example, you say disambar al-khaamis (dee-
sam-bar al-kah-mees; December fifth) or yanaayir ath-
thaamin (yah-nah-yeer ah-thah-meen; January eighth). In 
addition, because the ordinal acts as a possessive adjec-
tive, you must include the definite prefix al-.
Money, Money, Money
al-maal (al-mal; money) is an essential part of every-
day life. Here are a few words to get you started:
 
✓ fuluus (foo-loos; cash/physical currency)
 
✓ nuquud (noo-kood; money/coins)
 
✓ naqd (nah-ked; coin)
 
✓ ‘awraaq (aw-rak; money/paper currencies)

✓ shiikaat (shee-kat; checks)
 
✓ maSraf (mas-raf; bank)
 
✓ Hisaab maSrafii (hee-sab mas-rah-fee; bank 
account)
Opening a bank account
One of the most important things you may do in a 
maSraf is open a Hisaab maSrafii. Here are two types 
of Husub (hoo-soob; accounts) you may inquire about:

 Chapter 3: Numerical Gumbo: Counting of All Kinds

The two basic transactions you’ll probably make are:
 
✓ wadii’a (wah-dee-ah; deposit)
 
✓ ‘insiHaab (een-see-hab; withdrawal)
Using the ATM
Most ATMs accept all sorts of cards, whether they’re 
issued by the same maSraf that operates the ATM ter-
minal or not. However, some ATMs charge you a ‘ujra 
(ooj-rah; fee) if you use a card not issued by a recog-
nized maSraf. In addition, most ATMs accept both 
biTaaqaat al-‘i’timaad (credit cards) and biTaaqaat 
al-‘istilaaf (debit cards). Note: Another word for 
“credit card” is biTaaqa diiniiya (bee-tah-qah dee-
nee-yah). Here are some ATM-related commands and 
phrases:
 
✓ ‘udkhul al-biTaaqa (ood-kool al-bee-tah-qah; 
Insert the card.)
 
✓ ‘udkhul ar-raqm as-siriiy. (ood-kool ah-rah-kem 
ah-see-ree; Enter the PIN/secret number.)
 
✓ ‘insiHaab al-fuluus (een-see-hab al-foo-loos; cash 
withdrawal)
 
✓ ‘udkhul al-kammiyya. (ood-kool al-kah-mee-yah; 
Enter the amount.)
 
✓ ‘akkid al-kammiyya. (ah-keed al-kah-mee-yah; 
Confirm the amount.)
 
✓ khudh al-fuluus. (kooz al-foo-loos; Take the cash.)
 
✓ hal turiidu ‘iiSaala? (hal too-ree-doo ee-sah-lah; 
Do you want a receipt?)
 
✓ khudh al-‘iiSaala. (kooz al-ee-sah-lah; Take the 
receipt.)
 
✓ Haqqiq ar-raSiid. (hah-keek ah-rah-seed; Check 
the balance.)
 
✓ Hawwil al-amwaal. (hah-weel al-am-wal;

✓ ‘azil al-biTaaqa min faDlik. (ah-zeel al-bee-tah-
qah meen fad-leek; Please remove the card.)

Exchanging currency
If you’re traveling to a foreign dawla (dah-ou-lah; 
country), you won’t get very far if you don’t have 
the right ‘umla mutadaawala (oom-lah moo-tah-dah-
wah-lah; currency), or ‘umla (oom-lah) for short. (Of 
course, you could rely on shiikat al-musaafir [shee-
kat al-moo-sah-feer; traveler’s checks], but you may 
find that carrying ‘umla is more convenient.) You 
can exchange ‘umla at a number of different places, 
at a maSraf or a maktab as-sarf (mak-tab ah-sah-ref; 
exchange desk).
The following list of questions can help you facilitate 
this exchange at the maSraf:
 
✓ ‘ayna maktab as-sarf? (ay-nah mak-tab ah-sah-
ref; Where is the exchange desk?)
 
✓ mataa yaHull maktab as-sarf? (mah-tah yah-hool 
mak-tab ah-sah-ref; When does the exchange 
desk open?)
 
✓ maa huwa mu’addal as-sarf al-yawm? (mah 
hoo-wah moo-ah-dal ah-sah-ref al-yah-oum; What 
is today’s exchange rate?)
 
✓ hal mu’addal as-sarf sayakuun ‘aHsan ghadan? 
(hal moo-ah-dal ah-sah-ref sah-yah-koon ah-san 
ghah-dan; Will the exchange rate be better 
tomorrow?)
 
✓ hal hunaaka ‘ujra li tasriif al-fuluus? (hal hoo-
nah-kah ooj-rah lee tas-reef al-foo-loos; Is there a 
fee for exchanging money?)
 
✓ ‘uriidu ‘an ‘aSrifa duularaat ‘ilaa daraahim. 
(oo-ree-doo an as-ree-fah doo-lah-rat ee-lah dah-
rah-heem; I would like to exchange dollars into 
dirhams.)
 
✓ kam min diinaar li mi’at duulaar? (kam meen 
dee-nar lee mee-at doo-lar; How many dinars for 
100 dollars?)
Here are some answers you may hear from the ‘amiin 
maktab as-sarf (ah-meen mak-tab ah-sah-ref; exchange 
desk representative):

n this chapter, I show you how to greet people in 
Arabic, how to respond to basic greetings, and

out when it’s appropriate to use formal and informal 
terms, how to make small talk, and how to introduce 
yourself. HaDHan sa’iidan! (had-dan sa-ee-dan; Good 
luck!)
Greetings!
In Arabic, the greeting you use depends on whom 
you’re addressing. If you’re greeting someone you 
don’t know for the very first time, you must use the 
more formal greetings. If you’re greeting an old family 
friend or a colleague you know well, feel free to use 
the more informal forms of greeting. If you’re not sure 
which form to use, you’re better off going formal.

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
58
You say hello . . .
The formal way of greeting someone in Arabic is ‘as-
salaamu ‘alaykum (ass-sa-laam-ou a-lai-koum). Even 
though it translates into English as “hello,” it literally 
means “May peace be upon you.”
Using ‘as-salaamu ‘alaykum is appropriate when
 
✓ You’re greeting a potential business partner.
 
✓ You’re at a formal event, dinner, or gala.
 
✓ You’re meeting someone for the first time.
The most common reply is wa ‘alaykum ‘as-salaam 
(wa a-lai-koum ass-sa-laam; and upon you peace).
The phrase ‘ahlan wa sahlan (ahel-an wah sah-lan) is 
a very informal way of greeting a person or group of 
people. Translated into English, it resembles the more 
informal “hi” as opposed to “hello.” When someone 
says ‘ahlan wa sahlan, you should also reply ‘ahlan 
wa sahlan.
Using ‘ahlan wa sahlan is appropriate when
 
✓ You’re greeting an old friend.
 
✓ You’re greeting a family member.
 
✓ You’re greeting someone at an informal gather-
ing, such as a family lunch.
Simply saying ‘ahlan! is the most informal way of 
greeting someone. Use it only with people you’re very 
comfortable with.
. . . I say goodbye
Saying goodbye in Arabic doesn’t have formal or 
informal options. Here are the most common ways of 
saying goodbye in Arabic:

 Chapter 4: Making New Friends 
59
 
✓ ma’a as-salaama (ma-a ass-sa-laa-ma; go with 
peace, or goodbye)
 
✓ ‘ilaa al-liqaa’ (ee-laa al-li-kaa; until next time)
 
✓ ‘ilaa al-ghad (ee-laa al-gad; see you tomorrow)
How are you doing?
The most common way to ask someone how he’s 
doing is kayf al-Haal? (ka-yef al-haal), which literally 
means “How is the health?”
kayf al-Haal is gender-neutral, but you can also use 
gender-defined greeting terms, which are derivatives 
of the kayf al-Haal phrase:
 
✓ When addressing a man, use kayf Haaluka (ka-
yef haa-lou-ka).
 
✓ When addressing a woman, use kayf Haaluki 
(ka-yef haa-lou-kee).
 
kayf Haalak? (ka-yef haa-lak; How is your 
health?) is a bit more personal and informal.
I’m doing well!
When someone asks you how you’re doing, if you’re 
doing just fine, the typical response is al-Hamdu li-
llah (al-ham-dou lee-lah). It literally means “Praise to 
God,” but in this context, it translates to “I’m doing 
well.” Typically, after you say al-Hamdu li-llah, you 
follow up by saying shukran (shouk-ran; thank you).
After you say al-Hamdu li-llah, shukran, you need to 
ask the other person how he or she is doing:
 
✓ If you’re speaking with a man, you say wa ‘anta 
kayf al-Haal (wa an-ta ka-yef al-haal; And you, 
how are you?).
 
✓ If you’re speaking with a woman, you say wa 
‘anti kayf al-Haal (wa an-tee ka-yef al-haal; And 
you, how are you?).

Making Introductions
This section explains how to ask people for their 
names and how to share your name using the posses-
sive form.
Asking “What’s your name?”
You need to know only two words: ‘ism (name) and 
maa (what). If you’re addressing a man, you ask maa 
‘ismuka? (maa ees-moo-ka; What’s your name?) (M). 
When addressing a woman, you ask maa ‘ismuki? 
(maa ees-moo-kee; What’s your name?) (F).
 
If you say maa ‘ismuk without using the suf-
fixes –a or –i at the end of ‘ismuk, you’re 
actually using a gender-neutral form, which 
is perfectly acceptable. You can address 
both men and women by saying maa 
‘ismuk? (maa ees-mook; What’s your 
name?) (GN).
Responding with “My name is . . .”
 
The possessive form is one of Arabic’s easi-
est grammatical lessons: All you do is add 
the suffix –ii (pronounced ee) to the noun, 
and — voila! — you have the possessive form 
of the noun. To say “my name,” add –ii to 
‘ism and get ‘ismii (ees-mee; my name). So to 
say “My name is Amine,” all you say is ‘ismii 
amiin.
When someone introduces himself or herself, a polite 
response is tasharrafnaa (tah-shah-raf-nah; It’s a plea-
sure to meet you). You can also say ‘ahlan wa sahlan 
(ahel-an wah sah-lan; Nice to meet you.), which is 
much more informal.

Talking about Countries 
and Nationalities
When you meet someone for the first time, you 
may want to know what country he or she is from. 
Fortunately for English speakers, the Arabic names of 
many countries are similar to their names in English.
Asking “Where are you from?”
You can use these two phrases to ask someone where 
they’re from:
 
✓ min ‘ayna ‘anta (min ay-na ann-ta) if you’re 
asking a man.
 
✓ min ‘ayna ‘anti (min ay-na ann-tee) if you’re 
asking a woman.

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
62
If you want to ask if a man is from a certain place — 
for example, America — you say
hal ‘anta min ‘amriikaa? (hal ann-ta min am-ree-
kaa; Are you from America?) (M)
If you’re speaking with a woman, you simply replace 
‘anta with ‘anti.
Answering “I am from . . .”
To say “I am from . . .,” you use the preposition 
min (from) and the personal pronoun ‘anaa (I/me). 
Therefore, “I’m from America” is ‘anaa min ‘amriikaa. 
It’s that simple!

Asking Questions
One of the best ways to start a conversation is to ask 
a su’aal (soo-aahl; question). To get you started, here 
are some key question words in Arabic:
 
✓ man? (meh-n; Who?)
 
✓ ‘ayna? (eh-yeh-nah; Where?)
 
✓ mataa? (mah-taah; When?)
 
✓ maa? (maah; What?)
 
✓ maadhaa? (maah-zaah; What?) (used with 
verbs)
 
✓ lii maadhaa? (lee maah-zaah; Why?)
 
✓ kayfa? (keh-yeh-fah; How?)
 
✓ bikam? (bee-kah-m; How much?)
 
✓ kam min? (kam meen; How many?)

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
64
You may use these question words to ask more elabo-
rate and detailed questions. Here are some examples:
 
✓ maa ‘ismuka? (maah ees-moo-kah; What’s your 
name?) (MS)
 
✓ maa ‘ismuki? (maah ees-moo-kee; What’s your 
name?) (FS)
 
✓ maa mihnatuka? (maah meeh-nah-too-kah; What 
do you do?; literally “What is your job?”) (MS)
 
✓ maa mihnatuki? (maah meeh-nah-too-kee; What 
do you do?; literally “What is your job?”) (FS)
 
✓ maadha taf’al? (maah-zaah tah-feh-al; What are 
you doing?) (MS)
 
✓ maadha taf’aliina? (maah-zaah tah-feh-alee-nah; 
What are you doing?) (FS)
 
✓ min ‘ayna ‘anta? (meh-n eh-yeh-nah ahn-tah; 
Where are you from?) (MS)
 
✓ min ‘ayna ‘anti? (meh-n eh-yeh-nah ahn-tee; 
Where are you from?) (FS)
 
✓ hal tuHibbu al-qiraa’a? (hal too-hee-buh al-kee-
raa-ah; Do you like to read?) (MS)
 
✓ hal haadhaa kitaabuka? (hal hah-zah kee-tah-
boo-kah; Is this your book?)
 
✓ ‘ayna maHaTTatu al-qiTaar? (eh-yeh-nah mah-hah-
tah-too al-kee-taar; Where is the train station?)
 
✓ mataa satadhhab ‘ilaa al-maTaar? (mah-taah sa-
taz-hab ee-laah al-mah-taar; When will she go to 
the airport?)
 
✓ ‘ayna ‘aHsan maT’am? (eh-yeh-nah ah-sah-n 
mah-tam; Where is the best restaurant?)
Notice that some of the questions above refer to either 
masculine or feminine subjects. When you ask a ques-
tion in Arabic, you choose the gender of the subject by 
modifying the gender suffix of the noun in question. For 
example, kitaab (kee-tab) means “book,” but kitaabuka 
(kee-tah-boo-kah) means “your book” (M), and kitaabuki 
(kee-tah-boo-kee) means “your book” (F). So if you want 
to ask a man for his book, you use kitaabuka.

The ‘usra plays a very important role in Arab 
life, society, and culture, and the Arab ‘usra 
structure is very different than the Western 
family unit. The notion of the ‘usra is much 
more comprehensive and reinforced in the 
Arab world and the Middle East than it is in 
America or other Western countries. The 
family unit most prevalent in the West is the 
nuclear family — generally comprised of two 
parents and their children. But the ‘usra in 
the Arab world is an extended, close-knit 
family network made up of parents, children, 
grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.
It’s not uncommon to find an Arab household in 
which children live not only with their parents but 
also with their aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandpar-
ents. In Arab culture, the idea of the immediate family 
extends to second- and even third-degree cousins! 
In addition, lineage is important, and the terms for 
family relatives are specifically designed to differen-
tiate between cousins from the mother’s side (‘ibn 
al-khaal) and cousins from the father’s side (‘ibn 
al-’amm). Thus, if you’re talking to an Arab about his 
or her family, you can be sure that you’ll have a lot to 
talk about!
Talking about Work
You can generally find out a lot about a person based 
on his or her mihna (meeh-nah; job). If you want to 
ask someone about his or her profession, you have 
two options:
 
✓ maa mihnatuka? (maah meeh-nah-too-kah; What 
is your job?; literally “What do you do?”) (M)
 
✓ maa mihnatuki? (maah meeh-nah-too-kee; What 
is your job?; literally “What do you do?”) (F)
 
✓ ‘ayna ta’mal? (eh-yeh-nah tah-mal; Where do you 
work?) (M)
 
✓ ‘ayna ta’maliina? (eh-yeh-nah tah-mah-lee-nah; 
Where do you work?) (F)

Shooting the Breeze: Talking 
about the Weather
If you want to engage in kalaam khafiif, shoot the 
breeze, or chitchat with a friend or stranger, talking 
about Taqs (tah-kes; weather) is a pretty safe topic. In 
conversations about Taqs, you’re likely to use some 
of the following words:
 
✓ shams (shah-mes; sun)
 
✓ maTar (mah-tar; rain)
 
✓ ra’d (rah-ed; thunder)
 
✓ barq (bah-rek; lightning)
 
✓ suHub (soo-hoob; clouds)
 
✓ Harara (hah-rah-rah; temperature)
 
✓ daraja (dah-rah-jah; degrees)

Arabic Phrases For Dummies

✓ bard (bah-red; cold)
 
✓ sukhoun (suh-koon; hot)
 
✓ ruTuuba (roo-too-bah; humidity)
 
✓ riiH (ree-eh; wind)
 
✓ ‘aaSifa (ah-tee-fah; storm)
 
✓ thalj (thah-lej; snow)
 
✓ qawsu quzaH (qah-wuh-suh koo-zah; rainbow)
 
If you want to express the temperature, as in 
“It’s x degrees,” you must use the following 
construct: al-Harara (insert number) daraja. 
So, al-Harara 35 daraja means “It’s 35 
degrees.”
Here are some expressions you can use to start talk-
ing about Taqs:
 
✓ hal sayakun maTar al-yawm? (hal sah-yah-koon 
mah-tar al-yah-oum; Is it going to rain today?)
 
✓ yawm sukhoun, na’am? (yah-oum suh-koon, nah-
am; Hot day, isn’t it?)
 
✓ ‘inna yahubbu al-bard faj’atan. (ee-nah yah-hoo-
boo al-bah-red fah-jeh-ah-tan; It’s gotten cold all 
of a sudden.)
 
✓ kayfa aT-Taqs fii nyuu yoork? (keh-yeh-fah 
ah-tah-kes fii noo york? How’s the weather in 
New York?)
 
✓ hal satakun shams? (hal sah-tah-koon shah-mes? 
Is it going to be sunny?)
 
✓ hal sayabqaa aT-Taqs haakadhaa kul al-
usbuu’? (hal sah-yab-qah at-tah-kes hah-kah-zah 
kool al-oos-boo; Will the weather remain like this 
all week?)

It would be difficult to chat about the weather without 
mentioning the fuSuul (fuh-sool; seasons):
 
✓ Sayf (sah-yef; summer)
 
✓ khariif (kah-reef; fall)
 
✓ shitaa’ (shee-tah; winter)
 
✓ rabii’ (rah-beeh; spring)
 
Temperatures in the majority of the Middle 
Eastern countries are stated in Celsius and 
not Fahrenheit. If you hear someone say that 
al-harara 25 daraja (al-hah-rah-rah 25 dah-
rah-jah; It’s 25 degrees), don’t worry that 
you’re going to freeze! They actually mean 
that it’s almost 80 degrees Fahrenheit. To 
convert degrees from Celsius to Fahrenheit, 
use the following formula:
(Celsius x 1.8) + 32 = Degrees Fahrenheit

may want a small wajba khafiifa (waj-bah kah-fee-fah; 
snack) instead.

Lunch
Eating your fuTuur keeps you shab’aan (shab-an; sat-
isfied) for a few hours. When you get jaai’ (jah-eeh; 
hungry) again, it’s time for al-ghidaa’ (al-gee-dah; lunch).
 
al-ghidaa’ is a very important wajba (waj-bah; 
meal). In most Middle Eastern countries, work-
ers don’t sit in their cubicles and eat their 
ghidaa’. Rather, most offices close and employ-
ees get two hours or more for al-ghidaa’!
Here are some of the common Ta’aam (tah-am; foods) 
you can expect during the ghidaa’:
 
✓ laHam (lah-ham; meat)
 
✓ laHam al-baqar (lah-ham al-bah-kar; beef)
 
✓ laHam al-ghanam (lah-ham al-ghah-nam; lamb)
 
✓ laHam al-‘ajal (lah-ham al-ah-jel; veal)

In order to make a sandwiish even more delicious,

Dinner
In most Arab countries, ‘ishaa’ (eeh-shah; dinner) 
is usually eaten very late, around 9 or even 10 p.m. 
Because ghidaa’ and fuTuur are the meals at which 
people eat a lot, and because of the traditionally late 
hour of ‘ishaa’, most people in the Arab world have 
light meals during ‘ishaa’.

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
82
A typical ‘ishaa’ consists of some sort of samak (sah-
mak; fish), dajaaj (dah-jaj; chicken), or other kind of 
laHm (lah-hem; meat).
Enjoying a Meal at Home
This section covers key terms to help you prepare 
and set the table for a wajba ladhiida fii al-manzil 
(waj-bah lah-zee-zah fee al-man-zeel; a delicious home-
cooked meal)!
Here are some common items you might find in your 
maTbakh (mat-bak; kitchen):
 
✓ furn (foo-ren; stove)

When you’re done Tibaakha (tee-bah-kah; cooking) 
daakhil (dah-keel; inside) the maTbakh, you’re ready 
to step into the ghurfat al-‘akel (ghoor-fat al-ah-kel; 
dining room) and set up the Ta’aam on top of the 
maa’ida (mah-ee-dah; dining table). Here are some

Dining Out
Going to a nice maT’am (mat-am; restaurant) is one 
of my favorite things to do. In this section, you find 
out how to interact with the wait staff and choose the 
best food.
 
The dining experience in most restaurants in 
the Middle East, as well as in Middle Eastern 
restaurants all over the world, is truly an 
enchanting and magical experience. The 
décor is usually very ornate and sumptuous, 
with oriental patterns and vivid colors 
adorning the rooms. The wait staff usually 
wears traditional jellaba (jeh-lah-bah), which 
are long, flowing garments that are pleasing 
to the eye, and the food is very exotic, spicy, 
and delicious. When you go to a Middle 
Eastern restaurant, allow at least a couple of 
hours for the dining experience — don’t be 
surprised if you end up savoring a five- or 
even seven-course meal!
Perusing the menu
As in other restaurants, the qaa’imat aT-Ta’aam (qah-
ee-mah ah-tah-am; menu) in Middle Eastern restau-
rants is usually divided into three sections:
 
✓ muqabbilaat (moo-qah-bee-lat; appetizers)
 
✓ Ta’aam ra’iisii (tah-am rah-ee-see; main course/
entrees)
 
✓ taHliya (tah-lee-yah; dessert)

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
84
Appetizers
In the muqabbilaat section of the menu, you find 
some Ta’aam khafiif (tah-am kah-feef; light food) to 
help build your appetite. Here are some common 
muqabbilaat:
 
✓ rubyaan (roob-yan; shrimp)
 
✓ baadhinjaan (bah-zeen-jan; eggplant)
 
✓ kam’a (kam-ah; truffles)
 
✓ thuum muHammar (toom moo-hah-mar; roasted 
garlic)
 
✓ waraq ‘ay-nab (wah-rak ay-nab; stuffed grape 
leaves)
 
✓ ‘adas (ah-das; lentils)
 
✓ Hasaa’ (hah-sah; soup)
 
✓ Hariira (hah-ree-rah; Moroccan soup)
Entrees
The Ta’aam ra’iisii consist of dishes featuring dajaaj 
(dah-jaj; chicken), various other laHam (lah-ham; 
meat), and samak (sah-mak; fish). Most restaurants 
have a pretty extensive selection of samak, including:
 
✓ salmoon (sal-moon; salmon)
 
✓ al-qood (al-kood; cod)
 
✓ tuun (toon; tuna)
 
✓ al-’uTruuT (al-oot-root; trout)
 
✓ ‘isqoomrii (ees-koom-ree; mackerel)
 
✓ shabbooT (shah-boot; carp)
 
✓ moosaa (moo-sah; sole)
 
✓ qirsh (kee-resh; shark)
Desserts
The taHliya is a great way to wrap up a nice 
wajba. I like the taHliya because there are a lot of 

 Chapter 5: Enjoying a Drink or a Snack (or a Meal!)
85
Halawiyyaat (hah-lah-wee-yat; sweets) to choose 
from. Here are some popular taHliya:
 
✓ ka’k (kahk; cake)
 
✓ ka’k ash-shuukuulaat (kahk ah-shoo-koo-lat; 
chocolate cake)
 
✓ Buudha (boo-zah; ice cream)
 
✓ ‘aTbaaq (at-bak; pudding)
 
✓ al-jubun (al-joo-boon; cheese)
Beverages
In addition to Ta’aam, you may also notice a portion 
of the menu — or an entirely different menu — intro-
ducing different kinds of mashruubaat (mash-roo-bat; 
drinks). The following are some mashruubaat you 
may come across in the qaa’imat aT-Ta’aam:
 
✓ maa’ (mah; water)
 
✓ maa’ ghaaziya (mah ghah-zee-yah; soda water)
 
✓ ‘aSiir al-laymoon (ah-seer ah-lay-moon; 
lemonade)
 
✓ al-khamer (al-kah-mer; alcohol)
 
✓ biirra (bee-rah; beer)
 
✓ nabiidh (nah-beez; wine)
 
✓ nabiidh ‘aHmar (nah-beez ah-mar; red wine)
 
✓ nabiidh ‘abyaD (nah-beez ab-yad; white wine)
Placing your order
After you peruse the qaa’imat aT-Ta’aam, you’re 
ready to place your order with either the
 
✓ khaadim al-maT’am (kah-deem al-mat-am; 
waiter) or the
 
✓ khaadimat al-maT’am (kah-dee-maht al-mat-am; 
waitress).

maT’am staff are usually highly trained individuals 
who know the ins and outs of the Ta’aam that the 
maT’am serves, so don’t be afraid to ask lots of ‘as’ila 
(ass-ee-lah; questions) about things on the qaa’imat 
aT-Ta’aam. Here’s how you might order:
Waitress: marHaba bikum ‘ilaa maT’am ‘aTlas. 
kayfa yumkin ‘an ‘usaa’idukum? (mar-hah-bah 
bee-koom ee-lah mat-ham at-las. kay-fah yoom-
keen an oo-sah-ee-doo-koom? Welcome to 
Restaurant Atlas. How may I help you?)
Sam: ‘ay mashruubaat ‘indakum? (ay mash-roo-
bat een-dah-koom? What do you have to drink?)
Waitress: ‘indanaa maa’, maa’ ghaaziya wa 
‘aSiir al-laymoon. (een-dah-nah mah, mah ghah-
zee-yah wah ah-seer ah-lay-moon. We have water, 
soda water, and lemonade.)
Sam: sa-nabda’ bi maa’ min faDlik. (sah-nab-dah 
bee mah meen fad-leek. We’ll start with water 
please.)
Waitress: turiidaani maa’ Tabi’ii ‘aw maa’ 
‘aadii? (too-ree-dah-nee mah tah-bee-eey aw mah 
ah-dee? Do you want mineral [bottled] water or 
regular [tap] water?)
Sam: maa’ Tabi’ii. (mah tah-bee-eey. Mineral 
water.)
Waitress: fawran. hal turiidaani khamer 
‘ayDan? (faw-ran. hal too-ree-dah-nee kah-mer 
ay-zan? Right away. And would you like any alco-
holic drinks as well?)
Atika: hal ‘indakum nabiidh? (hal een-dah-koom 
nah-beez? Do you have any wine?)
Waitress: na’am. ‘indanaa nabiidh ‘abyaD wa 
nabiidh ‘aHmar. (nah-am. een-dah-nah nah-beez 
ab-yad wah nah-beez ah-mar. Yes. We have white 
wine and red wine.)
Atika: sa-na’khudh nabiidh ‘aHmar min faDlik. 
(sah-nah-kooz nah-beez ah-mar meen fad-leek. 
We’ll have red wine please.)

Excellent. I’ll give you some time to read through 
the menu.)
Sam: shukran. (shook-ran. Thank you.)
Waitress: hal ‘antumaa musta’idaani li-’iTlaab

For appetizers, we’d like shrimp and truffles.)
Waitress: ‘ikhtiyaar mumtaaz. (eek-tee-yar 
moom-taz. Excellent selection.)
Sam: wa ba’da dhaalika sa-na’khudh salmoon. 
(wah bah-dah zah-lee-kah sa-nah-kooz sal-moon. 
And after that we’d like to have salmon.)
Waitress: shay’ ‘aakhar? (shay ah-kar? Anything 
else?)
Atika: nuriid ka’k ash-shuukuulaat li at-taHliya. 
(noo-reed kahk ah-shoo-koo-lat lee ah-tah-lee-yah. 
We’d like the chocolate cake for dessert.)
Finishing your meal and paying 
the bill
When you finish your meal, you need to take care of 
your Hisaab (hee-sab; bill). You may ask your waiter 
for the bill by saying al-Hisaab min faDlik (al-hee-sab 
meen fad-leek; the bill please). Another option is to 
ask the waiter or waitress kam al-kaamil? (kam al-
kah-meel; What’s the total?).
Like in the United States, tipping your waiter or waitress 
is customary in Arabic-speaking countries and Middle 
Eastern restaurants. The amount of the baqsheeh (bak-
sheesh; tip) depends on the kind of service you received, 
but usually 15 to 20 percent is average.

Going to the Store
When you want to buy something, you head to the 
dukkaan (doo-kan; store). Depending on your shop-
ping list, you can choose from different types of 
dakaakiin (dah-kah-keen; stores). Here are some spe-
cialty dakaakiin you may need to visit:
 
✓ makhbaza (mak-bah-zah; bakery)
 
✓ maktaba (mak-tah-bah; bookstore/library)

Other types of dakaakiin provide services, such as

that are more service-oriented:

travel agency)
 
✓ Hallaaq (hah-lak; barber/hairdresser)

If you need to shop for a variety of goods, your des-
tination is the dukkaan kabiir (doo-kan kah-beer; 
department store/mall), where you can find almost 
anything you want.
Browsing the merchandise
Sometimes you just need to browse. If so, a khaadim 
ad-dukkaan (kah-deem ah-doo-kan; store clerk) (M) 
or a khaadima ad-dukkaan (kah-dee-mah ah-doo-kan; 
store clerk) (F) may ask:

part of the store, head to the maktab al-’i’laamaat

your ‘as’ila (ass-ee-lah; questions) answered. Here are 
some ‘as’ila to help you practice:

Asking for a Particular Item
When you want a particular item, you’re likely to need 
a demonstrative word, such as “that one” or “this” or 
“those over there.” Demonstratives are the little words 
we use to specify particular items. Table 6-1 presents 
the common demonstratives in Arabic:

haa’ulaa’ii
hah-oo-lah-ee
these (gender neutral)
‘ulaa’ika
oo-lah-ee-kah

In a sentence, you always place the demonstrative 
word before the object being pointed to, which is 
often a noun. In addition, the noun must be defined 
using the definite prefix pronoun al-.
The following conversation illustrates some common 
demonstratives:
Omar: hal ‘indakum jakiiTaat? (hal een-dah-
koom jah-kee-tat? Do you have jackets?)
Salesperson: na’am. ‘indanaa ‘anwaa’ kathiira

Similar to English, the comparative forms of adjec-
tives always follow this pattern:
noun + adjective comparative form + preposition 
min (meen; than) + second adjective
 
It’s essential that you include the preposition 
min right after every comparative adjective. 
In addition, all nouns being compared need 
to be defined by attaching to them the defi-
nite article prefix al-.

 Chapter 6: Shop ’til You Drop!

Here are some common examples of comparative sen-
tences using the adjective forms:
 
✓ al-bint ‘akbar min al-walad. (al-bee-net ak-bar 
meen al-wah-lad; The girl is bigger than the boy.)
 
✓ at-tilifizyuun ‘aghlaa min al-midyaa’. (ah-tee-
lee-fee-zee-yoon ag-lah meen al-meed-yah; The 
television is more expensive than the radio.)
 
✓ as-sayyaara ‘asra’ min as-shaaHina. (ah-sah-yah-
rah as-rah meen ah-shah-hee-nah; The car is 
faster than the bus.)
 
✓ aj-jakiiTa ‘arkhas min al-qamiis. (ah-jah-kee-tah 
ar-kas meen al-qah-mees; The jacket is cheaper 
than the shirt.)
When forming these types of sentences, you may add 
demonstratives to be even more specific. Here are 
examples of comparative sentences used in conjunc-
tion with demonstratives:
 
✓ haadhihi al-bint ‘akbar min dhaalika al-walad. 
(hah-zee-hee al-bee-net ak-bar meen zah-lee-kah 
al-wah-lad; This girl is bigger than that boy.)
 
✓ haadhihi as-sayyaaraat ‘asra’ min ‘tilka as-
shaahinaat. (hah-zee-hee ah-sah-yah-rat as-rah 
meen teel-kah ah-shah-hee-nat; These cars are 
faster than those buses.)
 
✓ tilka al-‘imra’a ‘ajmal min dhaalika ar-rajul. 
(teel-kah al-eem-rah-ah aj-mal meen zah-lee-kah 
ah-rah-jool; That woman is prettier than that 
man.)
 
✓ haadhaa al-walad ‘akbar min ‘ulaa’ika al-
banaat. (hah-zah al-wah-lad ak-bar meen oo-lah-
ee-kah al-bah-nat; This boy is bigger than those 
girls.)
 
Notice in the examples that the adjective 
comparative form remains constant whether 
the nouns being compared are a combination 
of singular/singular, singular/plural, or 

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
98
plural/plural. In other words, the adjective 
comparatives are neutral: They remain the 
same regardless of both gender and number.
Picking out the best item
You use a superlative to say something is the “best,” 
“brightest,” “fastest,” “cleanest,” or “cheapest.” 
Basically, a superlative in Arabic is nothing more than 
the comparative form of the adjective! The only dif-
ference is that comparatives include the preposition 
min (than) and superlatives don’t include any prepo-
sition. For example, to tell someone, “This is the big-
gest house,” you say haadhaa ‘akbar manzil (hah-zah 
ak-bar man-zeel).
 
The biggest differences between superlatives 
and comparatives are:
 
✓ The superlative adjective always comes before 
the noun.
 
✓ When expressing a superlative, the noun is 
always undefined.
Here are some examples of superlative sentences:
 
✓ haadhihi ‘ajmal bint. (hah-zee-hee aj-mal bee-
net; This is the prettiest girl.)
 
✓ dhaalika ‘ab’ad dukkaan. (zah-lee-kah ab-ad 
doo-kan; That is the farthest store.)
If you switch the order of the words to demonstra-
tive + noun + superlative, be sure to define the noun. 
That’s the only other way you can construct a super-
lative sentence. For example:
 
✓ haadhihi al-bint ‘ajmal. (hah-zee-hee al-bee-net 
aj-mal; This girl is the prettiest.)
 
✓ dhaalika ad-dukaan ‘ab’ad. (zah-lee-kah ah-doo-
kan ab-ad; That store is the farthest.)

Shopping for Clothes
For many people, one of the most essential items to 
shop for is malaabis (mah-lah-bees; clothes). Table

An important consideration when you’re out shop-
ping for malaabis is al-Hajem (al-hah-jem; size). The 
four standard clothes sizes are:
 
✓ Saghiir (sah-gheer; small) (American size 
[Men’s]: 34–36; American size [Women’s]: 6–8)
 
✓ waSat (wah-sat; medium) (American size [Men’s]: 
38–40; American size [Women’s]: 10–12)
 
✓ kabiir (kah-beer; large) (American size [Men’s]: 
42–44; American size [Women’s]: 14–16)
 
✓ zaa’id kabiir (zah-eed kah-beer; extra large) 
(American size [Men’s]: 46 and above; American 
size [Women’s]: 18–20)
Another important consideration in clothes shopping 
is the lawn (lah-wen; color). Because ‘alwaan (al-wan; 
colors) are adjectives that describe nouns, a lawn 
must always agree with the noun in terms of gender. 
How do you know whether a noun is feminine or 
masculine? In about 80 percent of the cases, feminine

nouns end with a fatHa, or the “ah” sound. For the 
rest, you must look up the word in the qaamuus (qah-
moos; dictionary) to determine its gender. The mas-
culine and feminine forms of some common colors 
appear in Table 6-5.

Visiting Museums
A ziyaara (zee-yah-rah; visit) to a matHaf (mat-haf; 
museum) can be a wonderful experience as long as 
you follow a number of qawaa’id (qah-wah-eed; rules). 
These qawaa’id ensure that your experience and the 
experiences of others at the matHaf are jamiila (jah-
mee-lah; pleasant).

When visiting a matHaf, here are some phrases you 
may use or see posted:
 
✓ hayyaa binaa ‘ilaa al-matHaf al-yawm. (hah-yah 
bee-nah ee-lah al-mat-haf al-yah-oum. Let’s go to 
the museum today.)
 
✓ ‘ayna al-matHaf? (eh-yeh-nah al-mat-haf? Where 
is the museum located?)
 
✓ wa bikam biTaaqat ad-dukhuul? (wah bee-kam

entry ticket?)
 
✓ mataa yaftaHu al-matHaf? (mah-tah yaf-tah-hoo

✓ al-matHaf yaftaHu ma’a as-saa’a ath-thaamina 
fii aS-SabaaH. (al-mat-haf yaf-tah-hoo mah-ah ah-

museum opens at 8:00 in the morning.)
 
✓ Suwar mamnuu’a. (soo-war mam-noo-ah; Taking 
pictures is prohibited.)
 
✓ malaabis munaasiba Daruuriya (mah-lah-bees 
moo-naa-see-bah dah-roo-ree-yah; Proper attire

Arab scholars and Western civilization
Many of the works of the ancient Greek masters, such as 
Aristotle and Plato, were preserved by Islamic scholars 
when Europe was plunged into the Dark Ages (from about 
the Fifth through the Tenth centuries). Muslim scholars 
throughout the Muslim world, in Cordoba, Spain, and else-
where, translated gargantuan amounts of texts from Greek 
and Latin into Arabic. They studied these texts extensively 
and added a significant amount to the pool of knowledge. 
Thanks to the work of these Muslim scholars, much of the 
knowledge that serves as the basis of Western thought and 
civilization was preserved. In fact, while Europe was in the 
Dark Ages, Islam went through a revival and renaissance 
period not experienced anywhere else in the world.

Going to the Movies
Going to see a shariiT siinimaa’ii (sha-reet see-nee-
mah-ee; movie) in a maSraH siiniima’ii (mas-rah see-
nee-mah-ee; movie theater) is a very popular pastime 
for people in the Middle East. Here are some popular 
movie genres:
 
✓ mughaamara (moo-ghah-mah-rah; action/
adventure)
 
✓ maSraHiyya (mas-rah-hee-yah; comedy)
 
✓ draamii (drah-mee; drama)
 
✓ ru’aat al-baqar (roo-aht al-bah-kar; western)
 
✓ wathaa’iqii (wah-tha-ee-kee; documentary)
 
✓ rusuum al-mutaHarrika (roo-soom al-moo-tah-
hah-ree-kah; cartoon)
Most of the movies shown in these maSraH 
siiniima’ii are actually the original versions of 
American films with tarjamat al-Hiiwaar (tar-jah-mat 
al-hee-war; subtitles).
The verb most commonly associated with going to 
the movies is dhahaba (za-hah-bah; to go). Using the 
conjugations that follow, you can say
dhahabtu ‘ilaa al-maSraH as-siiniima’ii (za-hab-
too ee-lah al-mas-rah ah-see-nee-mah-ee; I went to 
the movie theater.)
yadhhabu ‘ilaa al-maSraH as-siiniima’ii (yaz-
hah-boo ee-lah al-mas-rah ah-see-nee-mah-ee; He 
is going to the movies.)

Touring Religious Sites
If you’re in a Middle Eastern or Arab city, be sure 
to check out a masjid (mas-jeed; mosque). The larg-
est masaajid (mah-sah-jeed; mosques) in the Muslim 
world are located in Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia, 
and in Casablanca, Morocco.
A few rules to keep in mind
When visiting masaajid, you must follow certain 
qawaa’id (rules):
 
✓ If you’re Muslim, you’re allowed to walk into 
any masjid you like; but before entering, you 
must remove your shoes and say the shahada 
(shah-hah-dah; religious prayer): laa ‘ilaaha 
‘illaa allah wa muHammad rasuul allah (lah ee-
lah-hah ee-lah ah-lah wah moo-hah-mad rah-sool 
ah-lah; There is no god but God and Muhammad 
is his Prophet.).
 
✓ If you’re non-Muslim, entry into a masjid is 
sometimes forbidden, whether you’re in the 
Middle East, the United States, or anywhere 
around the world. However, certain mosques, 
such as the masjid Hassan II in Casablanca, 
have designated wings that are open to both 
Muslims and non-Muslims. These wings are set 
aside more as exhibition rooms than as religious 
or prayer rooms, so you’re allowed to enter 
them, but you still must remove your Hidaa’ 
(hee-dah; shoes).

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
110
 
The word masjid comes from the verb sajada 
(sah-jah-dah), which means “to prostrate” or 
“to kneel.” Another word for “mosque” is 
jaami’ (jah-meeh), which comes from the 
word jama’a (jah-mah-ah; to gather). So the 
Arabic words for “mosque” are related to 
what one actually does in the mosque, which 
is to gather in a religious setting and pray.
The Hajj
One of the most popular events during the year for 
Muslims is the Hajj (haj), which is the pilgrimage to 
Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The Hajj, which generally lasts 
for five days, takes place once a year and is actually 
one of the five pillars of Islam.
As soon as the Hajjaaj (hah-jaj; pilgrims) arrive in 
Mecca, they must shed all their worldly clothing and 
possessions and change into sandals and a simple 
ihram (eeh-ram), which basically consists of a white 
cloth wrapped around the body. The logic behind 
wearing only the ihram is that every Hajjaaj is equal 
before God, and because no difference exists between 
a king and a beggar during the Hajj, everyone must 
wear the same thing.
After they don the ihram, the Hajjaaj begin a ritual 
known as the Tawaf (tah-waf; to turn), in which they 
walk around the ka’ba (kah-bah), a cubelike struc-
ture located in the middle of the masjid al-Haraam 
(mas-jeed al-hah-ram; The Sacred Mosque of Mecca). 
According to the Koran and other religious texts, 
the ka’ba was built by the Prophet Abraham for 
the purpose of worship. The Hajjaaj must circle the 
ka’ba seven times in an anti-clockwise manner. After 
the Tawaf, the Hajjaaj walk to the hills of Safa and 
Marwah before going to the hill of Arafat, then to the 
city of Mina, before returning to the ka’ba for a final 
Tawaf.

 Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 111
A man who has completed the Hajj is called al-Hajj 
(al-haj), and a woman who has done the Hajj is called 
al-Hajja (al-hah-jah).
 
Saudi Arabian law prohibits non-Muslims 
from entering Mecca.
Sporting an Athletic Side
I don’t know about you, but I love playing riyaaDa 
(ree-yah-dah; sports), whether it’s an individual sport 
such as al-ghuulf (al-ghoo-lef; golf) or a team sport 
like kurat al-qadam (koo-rat al-qah-dam; soccer).
kurat al-qadam is one of the most popular sports 
among Arabic-speaking people because it’s a riyaaDa 
mushaahada (ree-yah-dah moo-sha-hah-dah; spectator 
sport). In a typical mubaara (moo-bah-rah; game), you 
will use the following words:
 
✓ fariiq (fah-reek; team)
 
✓ mal’ab (mah-lab; stadium)
 
✓ natiija (nah-tee-jah; score)
 
✓ fawz (fah-wez; win)
 
✓ khasar (kah-sar; loss)
 
✓ khata’ (kah-tah; foul)
 
✓ Hakam (hah-kam; referee)
 
✓ malaabis riyaaDiyya (mah-lah-bees ree-yah-dee-
yah; uniforms)
 
✓ kura (koo-rah; ball)
 
✓ laa’ib (lah-eeb; player) (MS)
 
✓ laa’iba (lah-ee-bah; player) (FS)
Here are some other favorite sports:
 
✓ sibaaHa (see-bah-hah; swimming)
 
✓ furusiiyya (foo-roo-see-yah; horseback riding)

✓ kurat aT-Taa’ira (koo-rat ah-tah-ee-rah; 
volleyball)
 
✓ kurat as-salla (koo-rat ah-sah-lah; basketball)
 
✓ kurat al-miDrab (koo-rat al-meed-rab; tennis)
 
✓ daraaja (dah-rah-jah; cycling)
 
✓ tazaHluq (tah-zah-look; skiing)
 
✓ tazalluj (tah-zah-looj; ice skating)
 
✓ jumbaaz (joo-meh-baz; gymnastics)
 
✓ siibaaq as-sayaara (see-bah-kah ah-sah-yah-rah; 
racecar driving)
One of the most common verbs used with sports and 
other recreational activities is la’aba (lah-ah-bah; 
play). Because the verb la’aba is commonly used and 
important, knowing how to conjugate it in both the 
past and the present tenses is a good idea. Tables 7-3

Use the verb la’aba or yal’abu followed by 
the sport or activity you’re playing. For 
example, you may say
‘anaa ‘al’abu kurat as-salla. (I am playing 
basketball.)
hiya la’abat kurat al-miDrab. (She played 
tennis.)
Another important phrase commonly used relating to 
sports and other fun activities is hayyaa binaa (hah-
yah bee-nah; Let’s go). You’ll often hear friends telling 
each other hayyaa binaa followed by the activity or 
location of the activity, such as hayyaa binaa ‘ilaa 
mal’ab kurat al-qadam (hah-yah bee-nah ee-lah mal-
ahb koo-rat al-aah-dam; Let’s go to the soccer field).
The following conversation gives you some important 
phrases in case you want to get a friend to play kurat 
al-qadam with you:
Karim: hayyaa nal’ab kurat al-qadam ghadan. 
(hah-yah nah-lab koo-rat al-qah-dam ghah-dan. 
Let’s go play soccer tomorrow.)
Kamal: haadhihi fikra mumtaaza. (hah-zee-hee 
feek-rah moom-tah-zah. That’s an excellent idea.)
Karim: ‘ayy saa’a? (ay sah-ah? At what time?)
Kamal: hal as-saa’a al-khaamisa tuwaafiquka? 
(hal ah-sah-ah al-kah-mee-sah too-wah-fee-koo-
kah? Does 5:00 work for you?)
Karim: na’am. as-saa’a al-khaamisa muwaafiqa. 
‘ayna sa-nal’ab? (nah-am. ah-sah-ah al-kah-mee-
sah moo-wah-fee-qah. eh-yeh-nah sa-nah-lab? Yes. 
5:00 works for me. Where are we going to play?)
Kamal: fii mal’ab al-madrasa. (fee mah-lab al-
mad-rah-sah. In the school stadium.)
Karim: mumtaaz! hal ‘indaka kura? (moom-tahz! 
hal een-dah-kah koo-rah? Excellent! Do you have 
a ball?)

 Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 115
Kamal: na’am ‘indii kura. wa laakin laysa ‘indii 
malaabis riyaaDiyya. (nah-am een-dee koo-rah. 
wah lah-keen lah-yeh-sah een-dee mah-lah-bees 
ree-yah-dee-yah. Yes, I have a ball. But I don’t 
have any uniforms.)
Karim: laa sha’na lanaa bidhaalika. lam naHtaaj 
bi al-malaabis riyaaDiyya. (lah sha-nah lah-nah 
bee-zah-lee-kah. lam nah-taj bee al-mah-lah-bees 
ree-yah-dee-yah. That’s not a big deal. We really 
don’t need uniforms.)
Going to the Beach
Whether you go to the shaaTi’ (shah-teeh; beach) with 
your ‘aSdiqaa’ (ass-dee-qah; friends) or your ‘usra 
(oos-rah; family), it’s a really great place to have a fun 
time! Here are some useful words for the beach:
 
✓ malaabis as-sibaaHa (mah-lah-bees ah-see-bah-
hah; bathing suit)
 
✓ dihaan shamsii (dee-han shah-meh-see; 
sunscreen)
 
✓ shams (shah-mes; sun)
 
✓ saHaab (sah-hab; cloud)
 
✓ muHiiT (moo-heet; ocean)
 
✓ miDalla (mee-dah-lah; beach umbrella)
 
✓ ramla (rah-meh-lah; sand)
 
✓ mooja (moo-jah; wave)
hayyaa binaa ‘ilaa ash-shaaTi’! (hah-yah bee-nah 
ee-lah ah-shah-teeh! Let’s go to the beach!)
Playing Musical Instruments
No matter where you come from or what languages 
you speak, moosiiqaa (moo-see-qah; music) has the 

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
116
power to break down barriers and bring people closer 
together. Popular aalaat moosiiqiyya (ah-lat moo-see-
kee-yah; musical instruments) include:
 
✓ biiyaano (bee-yah-noo; piano)
 
✓ qiithaar (kee-thar; guitar)
 
✓ kamanja (kah-mah-neh-jah; violin)
 
✓ Tabl (tah-bel; drums)
 
✓ fluut (feh-loot; flute)
 
✓ buuq (book; trumpet)
 
✓ saaksuufuun (sak-soo-foon; saxophone)
In order to say that someone plays a particular instru-
ment, use the muDaari’ form of the verb yal’abu. 
For example yal’abu al-qiithaar means “He plays the 
guitar” or “He is playing the guitar”.
 
Middle Eastern music is one of the most pop-
ular types of music in the world. It is charac-
terized by a special kind of string instrument 
called the ‘uud (ood) that has 12 strings and 
a round hollow body. The ‘uud is generally 
accompanied by a number of percussion 
instruments, such as the regular drum and 
the special Tabla (tah-beh-lah) that keeps the 
beat and adds extra flavor to the serenading 
of the ‘uud.
Popular Hobbies
Besides riyaaDa and moosiiqaa, you may enjoy a 
number of other types of hobbies. Do you consider 
qiraa’a (kee-rah-ah; reading) a hiwaaya (hee-wah-yah; 
hobby)? Perhaps you’re creative and like rasm (rah-
sem; drawing) or fakhaar (fah-kar; pottery)?

 Chapter 7: Making Leisure a Top Priority 117
Some other popular hobbies include:
 
✓ waraq al-la’ib (wah-rak ah-lah-eeb; cards)
 
✓ raqS (rah-kes; dancing)
 
✓ shaTranj (sha-teh-rah-nej; chess)
 
✓ Hiyaaka (hee-yah-kah; knitting)
 
✓ shi’r (shee-ar; poetry)
When you want to discuss hobbies and personal 
activities, you often use the verb la’aba. For example, 
you say la’abtu kurat al-qadam (lah-ab-too koo-rat al-
qah-dam; I played soccer) or la’aba al-kamanja (lah-
ah-bah al-kah-mah-neh-jah; He played the violin). Here 
are some other example sentences that pair activities 
with the verb la’aba:
 
✓ la’abat shaTranj. (lah-ah-bat sha-teh-rah-nej; She 
played chess.)
 
✓ la’abnaa kurat as-salla. (lah-ab-nah koo-rat ah-
sah-lah; We played basketball.)
 
✓ la’abaa waraq al-la’ib. (lah-ah-bah wah-rak ah-
lah-eeb; They played cards.) (dual/MP/FP)

W
hether you’re looking for a job or just need to 
talk with your coworkers, this chapter has 
the phrases for you. I also give you basic phone 
vocabulary and tell you how to send letters, e-mails, 
and faxes.
Landing a Job
If you’re looking for ‘amal (ah-mal; work/job) or trying 
to decide what mihna (meeh-nah; profession) to 
pursue, this section is for you. 
One of the first things to keep in mind when you go 
about your job search is that you need to find an 
‘amal that suits your particular maSlaHaat (mas-lah-
hat; interests) and mahaaraat (mah-hah-rat; skills). 
You may want to start your search by talking to 
‘aSdiqaa’ (ass-dee-qah; friends) or asking around at 
your local jam’iyya (jam-ee-yah; university). Also, 
you’re likely to find listings in the following:
 
✓ jariidaat (jah-ree-dat; newspapers)
 
✓ ma’luumaat (mah-loo-mat; classified ads)

As you search, make sure you find out as 
much as possible about a potential mustakh-
dim (moos-tak-deem; employer). When you’re 
able to secure an interview with a sharika 
(shah-ree-kah; company), here’s a list of 
things you may want to find out about your 
potential mustakhdim:
 
✓ ‘adad al-‘ummaal (ah-dad al-oo-mal; number of 
employees)

insurance)
 
✓ raatib (rah-teeb; salary)
 
✓ waqt al-‘uTla (wah-ket al-oot-lah; vacation time)
 
✓ ta’aaqud (tah-ah-kood; pension)

Mary: marHaban bika. tafaDDal min faDlik.

Managing the Office 
Environment
The maktab is an essential part of modern life. In 
most Arabic-speaking and Muslim countries, ‘ummaal 
(ooh-mal; workers) work from al-‘ithnayn (al-eeth-nah-
yen; Monday) until al-jumu’a (al-joo-moo-ah; Friday). 
Most ‘ummaal follow a standard as-saa’a at-taasi’a 
‘ilaa al-khaamisa (ah-sah-ah ah-tah-see-ah ee-lah al-
kah-mee-sah; 9:00 to 5:00) schedule for workdays.
 
Although most makaatib (mah-kah-teeb; 
offices) around the world give their 
‘ummaaal time for ghadaa’ (ghah-dah; 
lunch), the duration depends on the 
employer and the country. For example, in 
the United States, it’s not uncommon for an 
‘aamil (ah-meel; worker) to eat her ghadaa’ 
while sitting at her maktab (mak-tab; desk). 
On the other hand, in most Middle Eastern 
countries, an ‘aamil gets two hours for 
ghadaa’ and is encouraged to eat his ghadaa’ 
at his manzil (man-zeel; house) with his 
‘usra (oos-rah; family).

 Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 123
Here are some key words and terms to help you navi-
gate the workplace:
 
✓ ‘amal (ah-mal; work/job)
 
✓ mihna (meeh-nah; profession)
 
✓ sharika (shah-ree-kah; company)
 
✓ sharika kabiira (shah-ree-kah kah-bee-rah; large 
company)
 
✓ sharika Saghiira (shah-ree-kah sah-ghee-rah; 
small company)
 
✓ ma’mal (mah-mal; factory)
 
✓ zubuun (zoo-boon; client)
 
✓ zabaa’in (zah-bah-een; clients)
You can choose from many different kinds of shari-
kaat (shah-ree-kat; companies) to work for, including 
a maSraf (mas-raf; bank), a sharikat al-Hisaab (shah-
ree-kat al-hee-sab; accounting firm), and a sharikat al-
qaanuun (shah-ree-kat al-qah-noon; law firm). You also 
have many choices when it comes to mihan (mee-han; 
professions). Here are some popular mihan:
 
✓ maSrafii (mas-rah-fee; banker) (M)
 
✓ maSrafiiya (mas-rah-fee-yah; banker) (F)
 
✓ rajul al-‘a’maal (rah-jool al-ah-mal; 
businessman)
 
✓ ‘imra’at al-‘a’maal (eem-rah-at al-ah-mal; 
businesswoman)
 
✓ muHaamiiy (moo-hah-mee; lawyer)
 
✓ shurTa (shoor-tah; police officer)
 
✓ rajul al-‘iTfaa’ (rah-jool al-eet-fah; firefighter)
Most sharikaat have a lot of ‘ummaal with different 
responsibilities, and most ‘ummaal find themselves in 
daa’iraat (dah-ee-rat; divisions/groups/departments) 
within the sharika. Here are some of the common 
daa’iraat you may find in a sharika:

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
124
 
✓ daa’irat al-Hisaab (dah-ee-rat al-hee-sab; 
accounting department)
 
✓ daa’irat al-‘aswaaq (dah-ee-rat al-as-wak; market-
ing department)
 
✓ daa’irat al-qaanuun (dah-ee-rat al-qah-noon; 
legal department)
 
✓ daa’irat al-’ummaal (dah-ee-rat al-ooh-mal; 
human resources department)
 
✓ daa’irat az-zabaa’in (dah-ee-rat ah-zah-bah-een; 
customer service department)
Interacting with your colleagues
Unless you’re in a mihna that doesn’t require you to 
interact with people face-to-face, you need to be able 
to get along with your zumalaa’ (zoo-mah-lah; col-
leagues) at the maktab:
 
✓ zamiil (zah-meel; colleague) (MS)
 
✓ zamiila (zah-mee-lah; colleague) (FS)
 
✓ zumalaat (zoo-mah-lat; colleagues) (FP)
 
✓ mudiir (moo-deer; director) (MS)
 
✓ mudiira (moo-dee-rah; director) (FS)
 
✓ mudiiruun (moo-dee-roon; directors) (MP)
 
✓ mudiiraat (moo-dee-rat; directors) (FP)
 
✓ ra’iis (rah-ees; president) (MS)
 
✓ ra’iisa (rah-ee-sah; president) (FS)
 
✓ ru’asaa’ (roo-ah-sah; presidents) (MP)
 
✓ ru’asaat (roo-ah-sat; presidents) (FP)
You can address people you work with in a number of 
different ways, such as based on rank, age, or gender. 
These categorizations may seem discriminatory in an 
American sense, but these terms actually carry the 
utmost respect for the person being referenced:

 Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 125
 
✓ Use sayyidii (sah-yee-dee; sir) to address the 
mudiir or someone with a higher rank than you.
 
✓ Use sayiidatii (sah-yee-dah-tee; madam) to 
address the mudiira or ra’iisa.
 
✓ Use Sadiiqii (sah-dee-kee; friend) to address a 
male colleague.
 
✓ Use Sadiiqatii (sah-dee-qah-tee; friend) to 
address a zamiila.
 
✓ Use al-‘akh (al-ak; brother) to address a male 
coworker or colleague.
 
✓ Use al-‘ukht (al-oo-ket; sister) to address a 
zamiila.
 
In Arabic culture, it’s okay to address 
coworkers or people close to you as ‘akh 
(brother) or ‘ukht (sister) even though they 
may not be related to you.
Here are some phrases to help you interact cordially 
and politely with your zumalaa’:
 
✓ hal turiid musaa’ada? (hal too-reed moo-sah-ah-
dah; Do you need help?) (M)
 
✓ hal turiidiina musaa’ada? (hal too-ree-dee-nah 
moo-sah-ah-dah; Do you need help?) (F)
 
✓ hal yumkin ‘an ‘usaa’iduka bii dhaalika? (hal 
yoom-keen an oo-sah-ee-doo-kah bee zah-lee-kah; 
May I help you with that?) (M)
 
✓ hal yumkin ‘an ‘usaa’idukii bii dhaalika? (hal 
yoom-keen an oo-sah-ee-doo-kee bee zah-lee-kah; 
May I help you with that?) (F)
 
✓ sa ‘adhhab ‘ilaa al-maT’am. hal turiid shay’an?

an; I’m going to the cafeteria. Do you want any-
thing?) (M)

Do you want anything?) (F)

Do you have a pen?) (M)

Writing reports is something most people have to do 
at the office. Here’s a conversation you might have 
with your colleagues:

Samir: ‘anaa katabtu niSf at-taqriir, wa laakin

Giving orders
The imperative verb form, also known as the com-
mand form, is used to give orders or directions. It’s 
an important verb to know in the workplace because 
that’s where you’re usually told what to do and where 
you tell others what to do. The imperative structure 
is fairly straightforward. This section shares some 
quick tips to allow you to master the imperative form.
First, because the imperative is a command form, you 
can use it only with present personal pronouns such 
as ‘anta (an-tah; you) (M) and ‘anti (an-tee; you) (F). 
You can’t use the imperative with absent personal 
pronouns such as huwa (hoo-wah; him) because you 
can’t give an order to someone who isn’t present. 
The following is a list of the personal pronouns to use 
with the imperative:

 ‘anta (an-tah; you) (MS)
 
 ‘anti (an-tee; you) (FS)
 
 ‘antum (an-toom; you) (MP)
 
 ‘antunna (an-too-nah; you) (FP)
 
 ‘antumaa (an-too-mah; you) (dual)
Second, the imperative form is nothing but a derived 
form of the regular verb in the maaDii (mah-dee; past) 
and the MuDaari’ (moo-dah-reeh; present) tenses. 
The following is a list of the most common imperative 
verbs:
 
 ‘uktub (ook-toob; write)
 
 ‘iqra (eek-rah; read)
 
 ‘unDHur (oon-zoor; look)
 
 ‘a’id (ah-eed; repeat)
 
 qull (kool; say)
 
 ‘u’kul (ooh-kool; eat)
 
 takallam (tah-kah-lam; speak)
 
 qif (keef; stop)
 
 taHarrak (tah-hah-rak; move)
One of the more important verb command forms 
is the verb kataba (kah-tah-bah; to write). Table 8-1 
shows the imperative (command) form of the verb 
kataba.

Supplying your office
In order to function properly and efficiently at the 
maktab, you need a number of work-related items. 
Here are some supplies you can expect to find at the 
maktab:
 
✓ kursiiy (koor-see; chair)
 
✓ maktab (mak-tab; desk)
 
✓ ‘aalat al-Hisaab (ah-lat al-hee-sab; computer)
 
✓ haatif (hah-teef; telephone)
 
✓ ‘aalat al-faks (ah-lat al-fah-kes; fax machine)
 
✓ maTba’a (mat-bah-ah; printer)
 
✓ ‘aalat al-Tibaa’ (ah-lat ah-tee-bah; photocopier)
Besides ‘aalaat (ah-lat; machines) and heavy furni-
ture, you also need smaller tools:
 
✓ qalam jaaf (qah-lam jaf; pen)
 
✓ qalam ar-rasaas (qah-lam ah-rah-sas; pencil)
 
✓ mimHaat (meem-hat; eraser)
 
✓ kitaab (kee-tab; book)
 
✓ daftar (daf-tar; notebook)
 
✓ ‘awraaq (aw-rak; papers)
 
✓ mishbak ‘awraaq (meesh-bak aw-rak; paper 
clip)
 
✓ Dammat ‘awraaq (dah-mat aw-rak; stapler)
 
✓ lisqah (lee-skah; glue)
 
✓ skooch (seh-koo-tech; tape)
If you can’t find a daftar or lisqah, ask a zumalaa’ if 
you can borrow one. Here’s how you ask a colleague a 
question, depending on whether you’re speaking to a 
man or a woman:

✓ hal ‘indakii daftar? (hal een-dah-kee daf-tar; 
Do you have a notebook?) (F)
 
✓ hal ‘indaka lisqah? (hal een-dah-kah lee-skah; 
Do you have glue?) (M)
 
✓ hal ‘indakum skooch? (hal een-dah-koom seh-
koo-tech; Do you have tape?) (MP)
 
✓ hal ‘indahu qalam? (hal een-dah-hoo qah-lam; 
Does he have a pen?)
Picking Up the Phone
The haatif (haa-teef; phone) is an important tool for 
the office. In this section, I explain how to properly 
begin and end a mukaalama haatifiyya (moo-kaah-la-
mah haa-teef-eeya; phone conversation), how to make 
plans over the phone, and how to leave a proper 
phone message in Arabic.
Dialing up the basics
Before you can talk on the haatif, you need to be 
familiar with the following basic terminology:
 
✓ haatif ‘aam (haa-teef aahm; public phone)
 
✓ haatif selulayr (haa-teef seh-loo-layer; 
cellphone)
 
✓ raqm al-haatif (rak-em al-haa-teef; phone 
number)
 
✓ biTaaqat al-haatif (bee-taa-kaht al-haa-teef; 
phone card)
 
✓ mukaalama haatifiyya (moo-kaah-la-mah haa-
teef-eeya; phone conversation)
Beginning a phone conversation
You can begin a phone conversation in a number of 
ways. The most common, whether you’re the caller or 
the person answering the phone, is to simply say allo 
(all-low; hello).

 Chapter 8: When You Gotta Work 133
It’s proper etiquette to state your name right after the 
person who picks up the phone says allo, particularly 
if you don’t know that person. If you’re the caller, you 
may say ‘anaa (an-nah; I am) followed by your name. 
Alternatively, you may say haadhaa (M) / haadhihi 
(F) (haa-zaah / haa-zee-hee; this is) followed by your 
name. A familiar phrase you can also use after you 
say allo is ‘as-salaamu ‘alaykum (ass-sa-laam-ou a-lai-
koum; hello) or ‘ahlan wa sahlan (ahel-lan wah sahel-
lan; hi). Flip to Chapter 4 for more on greetings and 
making small talk.
Asking to speak to someone
Sometimes, a person other than the one you want to 
talk to answers the phone. A common phrase to help 
you ask for the person you called to speak with is 
hal (insert name here) hunaa? (hal [name] hoo-
naah), which means “Is (name) here?”
Alternatively you can also use the personal pronouns 
huwa (if the person you’re looking for is a man) or 
hiya (in the case of a woman) instead of using the 
person’s name.
Making business appointments
If you need to set up a maou’id (maw-oo-eed; appoint-
ment) over the phone, the following conversation will 
give you some good phrases:
Susan: allo. (all-low. Hello.)
Katiba: allo. sharikat rialto. daqiiqa min faDlik? 
(all-low. shah-ree-kaht ree-all-toh. dah-kee-qah 
meen fad-leek? Hello. Rialto Inc. Can you wait 
one minute please?)
Susan: Tab’an. (tah-bah-’an. Of course.)

Susan: mataa sa-yakun mawjood? (mah-taah sah-

Katiba: ayy daqiiqa. (ay dah-kee-qah. Any minute

Dealing with voice mail
When you leave a voice mail khabaran (khah-bah-ran; 
message) on someone’s haatif, you want to make sure 
to include the following:
 
✓ Your ‘ism (ee-seh-m; name)
 
✓ The waqt al-mukaalama (wah-ket al-muh-kaah-
lah-mah; time of the call)
 
✓ Your raqm al-haatif (rah-kem al-haa-teef; phone 
number or callback number)
 
✓ The ahsan waqt li al-mukaalama (ah-sahn wah-
ket lee al-muh-kaah-lah-mah; best times you’re 
available to talk)
A greeting message that you might hear on someone’s 
phone could go like this:
‘ahlan, haadhaa kareem. ‘anaa lastu hunaa wa

Transportation
In This Chapter
▶ Taking to the skies
▶ Catching taxis, buses, and trains
▶ Asking for directions
W
hen it comes to getting around the block, the 
city, or the world, you have a lot of different 
modes of naql (nah-kel; transportation) to choose 
from. In this chapter, I tell you not only how to use all 
major transportation methods but also how to navi-
gate a Middle Eastern city and ask directions.
Traveling by Plane
One of the most common methods of naql is flying in 
a Taa’ira (tah-ee-rah; airplane). Chances are if you’re 
in North America or Europe and want to go to the 
Middle East, you’ll take a Taa’ira.
Making reservations
The first step in air travel is making a Hajz (haj-z; 
reservation) and buying a biTaaqat as-safar (bee-tah-
kaht ah-sah-far; plane ticket). You may purchase your 

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
138
biTaaqat as-safar by visiting your wakiil safariyaat 
(wah-keel sah-fah-ree-yat; travel agent) or by going 
online. The following conversation is one you might 
have with your travel agent:
Sophia: ‘ahlan wa sahlan ‘aHmed. haadhihi 
sofia. (ahel-an wah sa-hel-an ah-med. hah-zee-hee 
so-fee-ah. Hi Ahmed. This is Sophia.)
Ahmed: ‘ahlan sofia. kayfa yumkin ‘an ‘usaa’iduki?

Getting some legwork out 
of the verb “to travel”
 
If there’s one verb you need to be familiar 
with relating to travel, it’s the verb saafara 
(sah-fah-rah; to travel). Even though saafara 
has four consonants instead of the usual 
three, it’s nevertheless considered to be a 
regular verb because the fourth consonant, 
the ‘alif, is actually a consonant that acts as 
a long vowel elongating the siin. (For more 
on regular verbs, flip to Chapter 2.) 
Use the form yusaafiru to conjugate “traveling” in the 
present tense. Table 9-1 shows you how:

Registering at the airport
With a biTaaqat as-safar, you’re ready to head off to 
the maTaar (mah-tar; airport) and board the Taa’ira. 
But before you actually get on the Taa’ira, you need 
to take care of a few logistical things. First, you must

present your jawaaz as-safar (jah-waz ah-sah-far; pass-
port) and your biTaaqat as-safar at the airport tasjiil 
(tass-jeel; registration) desk, which is located in the 
maHaTTat al-khuTuut al-jawwiya (mah-hah-tah al-
koo-toot al-jah-wee-yah; airport terminal).
Second, you must also answer some ‘as’ila (ass-ee-lah; 
questions) about your safar and your ‘amti’a (am-tee-
ah; luggage):
 
✓ kam min ‘amti’a satusajjiliina? (kam meen am-

of luggage are you going to register?)
 
✓ hal naDHamti al-’amti’a binafsuki? (hal nah-

pack your bags by yourself?)

Boarding the plane
So you’re ready to board the Taa’ira! After you check 
your ‘amti’a and present your biTaaqat as-safar and 
your jawaaz as-safar to the airline attendant, be sure 
to follow all ta’liimaat (tah-lee-mat; instructions) 
carefully.
When you reach the madkhal (mad-kal; gate) and 
board the Taa’ira, present your biTaaqat as-safar to 
the muwaafiq aT-Taa’ira (moo-wah-feek ah-tah-ee-rah; 
flight attendant), who will show you your maq’ad 
(mak-had; seat). The following terms are related to 
the Taa’ira and your flight:
 
✓ raakib (rah-keeb; passenger)
 
✓ rukkaab (roo-kab; passengers)
 
✓ muwaafiq (moo-wah-feek; attendant) (M)

A brief departure on 
the verb “to arrive”
 
A helpful verb to know when you’re traveling 
is waSala (wah-sah-lah; to arrive). (You can 
also use the verb waSala to express “to land” 
or “to come.”) Even though waSala has three 
consonants and therefore should fall into the 
mold of regular verb forms, it’s nevertheless 
classified as an irregular verb because it 
includes the initial consonant waaw. Verbs 
with initial waaw are classified as irregular 
because their present tense forms are differ-
ent than the regular present tense verb 
forms. As a result, whereas the past tense of 
waSala follows a regular pattern, the present 
does not. You need to use the irregular form 
yaSilu to conjugate “arriving” in the present 
tense. Table 9-2 shows you how:

immigration) and diwaana (dee-wah-nah; customs) offi-
cials. In recent years, airports have established more 
stringent requirements on musaafiruun (moo-sah-fee-
ruun; travelers), so be prepared to answer a number of 
‘as’ila regarding the details and purpose of your safar. 
Here are some common questions a hijra or diwaana 
official may ask you:
 
✓ maa ‘ismuk? (mah ees-mook; What’s your 
name?)
 
✓ kam ‘umruk? (kam um-rook; How old are you?)
 
✓ ‘ayna taskun? (eh-yeh-nah tass-koon; Where do 
you live?)
 
✓ maa hiya mihnatuk? (mah hee-yah meeh-nah-
took; What do you do?)
 
✓ kam muddat safaruk? (kam moo-dat sah-fah-
rook; How long is your trip?)
 
✓ maa hadaf safaruk? (mah hah-daf sah-fah-rook; 
What’s the purpose of your trip?)

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
146
 
✓ ‘ayna sataskun li muddat as-safar? (eh-yeh-nah 
sah-tass-koon lee moo-dat ah-sah-far; Where will 
you be staying during the trip?)
 
✓ hal tusaafir biwaHdik? (hal too-sah-feer bee-
wah-deek; Are you traveling alone?)
 
Provide clear and accurate answers to these 
questions. Providing false statements to an 
official from hijra or diwaana is a serious 
offense, so make sure you’re truthful 
throughout the questioning.
 
If you’re visiting a Muslim country, check 
with your travel agent or consular official 
about restrictions certain countries may 
have regarding bringing particular items into 
the country. For example, if you’re traveling 
to Saudi Arabia, you can’t bring alcohol with 
you into the country; and if you’re a woman, 
you may have to wear specific clothing, such 
as the Hijaab (hee-jab; veil), in order to 
comply with local religious laws. You want to 
be certain you are aware of all the rules and 
laws before you face someone from hijra or 
diwaana.

Getting through the hijra post puts you one step 
closer to leaving the maTaar and discovering the 
wonders of the exotic country you’re visiting! After 
your interview with the hijra, you may proceed 
to pick up your ‘amti’a. You may use the help of a 
Hammaal (hah-mal; baggage handler/porter), or you 
may simply use an ‘ariiba (ah-ree-bah; cart) to haul 
your own luggage.
Before you actually leave the maTaar, you must 
go through diwaana (customs). Use the following 
phrases when speaking with diwaana officials:
 
✓ laa shay’ li al-‘i’laan. (lah shay lee al-eeh-lan; 
Nothing to declare.)
 
✓ ‘indii shay’ li al-‘i’laan. (een-dee shay lee al-eeh-
lan; I have something to declare.)
Getting Around on Land
Major metropolitan areas and most small towns have 
a number of transportation methods you can choose 
from. Table 9-3 lists some of the most common forms 
of transportation you’re likely to use.

Hailing a taxi
 
When hailing a cab in a foreign country, keep 
the following advice in mind:
 
✓ Make sure that the taxi you hail is fully 
licensed and authorized by the local agencies 
to operate as a taxi. A number of companies 
operate illegal taxis and take advantage of 
unsuspecting tourists — make sure you’re not 
one of them! Most legitimate taxi operators have 
licensing information on display somewhere 
inside the cab or even on the car’s exterior.
 
✓ Be aware that most taxis that run to and from 
the airport charge a flat rate. Inquire about the 
flat rate before you get into the taxi.
 
✓ If you’re in the city, make sure the taxi saa’iq 
(sah-eek; driver) turns on the Hasuub (hah-
soob; meter). A common occurrence is that a 
driver forgets (either accidentally or intention-
ally) to turn on the meter and ends up charging 
you an exorbitant amount of money for a short 
ride.

 Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 149
In most Arab and Middle Eastern countries, tipping 
the saa’iq is not required. However, I’m sure the 
saa’iq won’t argue if you decide to give him a little tip!

Taking a bus
The Haafila (hah-fee-lah; bus) is a convenient mode of 
transportation whether you’re traveling across town 
or across the country. If you’re in a city and travel-
ing within city limits, taking the bus is a good option 
because it usually costs less than a taxi. If you’re 
traveling across the country, not only is taking a bus 
an economical option, but you also get to enjoy the 
beautiful scenery!
Most Haafilaat (hah-fee-lat; buses) accept prepaid 
biTaaqaat (bee-tah-kaht; tickets). If you take the 
Haafila frequently, refill your biTaaqa regularly. 
Otherwise, if you take a bus only occasionally, you’ll 
be glad to know that most Haafilaat also accept 
fuluus (foo-loos; cash) as long as it’s small bills. Here 
are some common terms you may need or encounter 
if you decide to take a Haafila:
 
✓ biTaaqat al-Haafila (bee-tah-kaht al-hah-fee-lah; 
bus ticket)
 
✓ maHaTTat al-Haafila (mah-hah-tat al-hah-fee-lah; 
bus station/bus stop)

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
150
 
✓ saa’iq al-Haafila (sah-eek al-hah-fee-lah; bus 
driver)
 
✓ tawqiit al-Haafila (taw-keet al-hah-fee-lah; bus 
schedule)
 
If you want to say “every” as in “every day” or 
“every hour,” all you do is add the word kul 
(kool; every) before the noun that describes 
the time you’re referring to. For example:
 
✓ kul yawm (kool yawm; every day)
 
✓ kul saa’a (kool sah-ah; every hour)
 
✓ kul niSf saa’a (kool nee-sef sah-ah; every half 
hour)
 
✓ kul rubu’ saa’a (kool roo-booh sah-ah; every 15 
minutes)
Here are some other phrases to help you find the bus 
you need:
 
✓ ‘afwan, hal haadhihi al-Haafila tadhhab ‘ilaa 
waSat al-madiina? (af-wan, hal hah-zee-hee al-
hah-fee-lah taz-hab ee-lah wah-sat al-mah-dee-
nah? Excuse me, does this bus go downtown?)
 
✓ ‘ayna al-Haafila ‘ilaa waSat al-madiina? (eh-yeh-
nah al-hah-fee-lah ee-lah wah-sat al-mah-dee-nah? 
Which bus goes downtown?)
 
✓ mataa sataSil al-Haafila raqm ‘ashra? (mah-tah 
sah-tah-sil al-hah-fee-lah rah-kem ash-rah? When 
does bus number 10 arrive?)
Boarding a train
The qiTaar (kee-tar; train) is a popular alternative if 
you’re looking for transportation that’s convenient, 
fast, affordable, and allows you to do a little sight-
seeing while you’re on the go. When you board the 
qiTaar, be ready to provide your biTaaqa to the 
qiTaar attendant. Although boarding most qiTaar 
doesn’t require a biTaaqa shakhSiyya (bee-tah-kah 
shak-see-yah; personal ID card), you should be ready 
to present one if an attendant asks you for it.

 Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 151
Asking for Directions
Being able to ask for — and understand — ‘ittijaahaat 
(ee-tee-jah-hat; directions) is an important skill. In this 
section, I tell you how to interact with native speakers 
in order to get relevant information to help you find 
what you’re looking for!
Asking “where” questions
The best way to get directions-related information 
from Arabic speakers is to ask ‘ayna (eh-yeh-nah; 
where) questions. Luckily, the structure of an ‘ayna 
question is relatively straightforward: You use ‘ayna 
followed by the subject. For example:
 
✓ ‘ayna al-funduq? (eh-yeh-nah al-foon-dook; 
Where is the hotel?)
 
✓ ‘ayna al-haatif? (eh-yeh-nah al-haa-teef; Where is 
the phone?)
 
✓ ‘ayna al-mirHaaD? (eh-yeh-nah al-meer-haad; 
Where is the bathroom?)
 
Be sure to define the subject following ‘ayna. 
You define a subject by adding the definite 
article prefix al- to the subject noun. For 
example, funduq means “hotel,” and al-fun-
duq means “the hotel.” So if you’re asking 
where the hotel is located, you say, ‘ayna al-
funduq? (Where is the hotel?) and not ‘ayna 
funduq?, which translates to “Where is 
hotel?”
Answering “where” questions
You can answer an ‘ayna question in a number of 
different ways, ranging from the simple to the convo-
luted. In order to answer ‘ayna questions, you have to 
understand the structure of the ‘ayna question reply, 
which usually follows this format: subject, preposi-
tion, object.

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
152
Take a look at some common ‘ayna questions and 
their corresponding replies:
 
✓  ‘ayna al-mustashfaa? (eh-yeh-nah al-moos-tash-
faah; Where is the hospital?)
 
 al-mustashfaa fii al-madiina. (al-moos-tash-faah 
fee al-mah-dee-nah; The hospital is in the city.)
 
✓  ‘ayna al-maT’am? (eh-yeh-nah al-mah-tam; 
Where is the restaurant?)
 
 al-maT’am qariib min al-funduq. (al-mah-tam 
qah-reeb meen al-foon-dook; The restaurant is 
close to the hotel.)
 
✓  ‘ayna al-kitaab? (eh-yeh-nah al-kee-taab; Where 
is the book?)
 
 al-kitaab taHta aT-Taawila. (al-kee-taab tah-tah 
at-tah-wee-lah; The book is underneath the 
table.)
Notice that in these examples, you use a preposition 
to establish a connection between the subject (in this 
case, what or who you’re looking for) and the object 
(the location of the desired subject). In order to estab-
lish the desired relationship, it’s very important for 
you to be familiar with some common prepositions:
 
✓  ‘alaa (ah-laah; on)
 
✓  fii (fee; in)
 
✓  ‘ilaa (ee-laah; to)
 
✓  qariib min (qah-reeb meen; close to)
 
✓  ba’id min (bah-eed meen; far from)
 
✓  bijaanib (bee-jaah-neeb; next to)
 
✓  fawqa (faw-qah; on top of)
 
✓  taHta (tah-tah; underneath/below)
 
✓  ‘amaama (ah-maah-mah; in front of)
 
✓  waraa’a (wah-raah-ah; behind)
 
✓  yamiin min (yah-meen meen; right of)
 
✓  yasiir min (yah-seer meen; left of)

 Chapter 9: I Get Around: Transportation 153
 
The subject in the reply to an ‘ayna question 
must also be defined. In addition, the object in 
the ‘ayna reply statement should be defined 
as well, either by using the definite article 
prefix al- or by including a predefined object.
Asking with courtesy
Of course, you can’t just go up to someone and ask 
them bluntly, ‘ayna al-funduq? (Where is the hotel?). 
That wouldn’t be very polite. The proper etiquette 
for approaching someone and asking for directions is 
to first say as-salaamu ‘alaykum (ah-sah-lah-moo ah-
lay-koom; hello) or ‘ahlan wa sahlan (ah-hel-an wah 
sah-hel-an; hi) and then ask if he or she would permit 
you to ask a question. For example, you begin the 
exchange by saying:
‘afwan. hal yumkin ‘an ‘as’alaka su’aal? (ahf-
wan. Hal yoom-keen an ass-ah-lah-kah soo-aah-l; 
Excuse me. May I ask you a question?)
After the person agrees to take your question, you 
may proceed to ask for directions.
Could you repeat that?
Sometimes, when you ask for directions, the person 
who tries to help you starts talking too fast and you 
can’t quite understand what he or she is saying. Other 
times, you may be in a loud area, such as near a down-
town traffic jam, and you can’t make out what the 
other person is saying. In either case, you have to ask 
the person who’s giving you directions to speak more 
slowly or to repeat what he or she has just said. These 
phrases can help you cope with these situations:
 
✓ ‘afwan (ahf-wan; excuse me/pardon me)
 
✓ ‘ismaH lii (ees-maah lee; excuse me)
 
✓ laa ‘afham (laa ah-fham; I don’t understand)
 
✓ takallam bi baT’in min faDlik (tah-kah-lahm bee 
bat-een meen fahd-leek; speak slowly please)

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
154
 
✓ hal yumkin ‘an ta’id min faDlik? (hal yoom-
keen an tah-eed meen fahd-leek; Could you 
repeat please?)
 
✓ ‘a’id min faDlik (ah-eed meen fahd-leek; Repeat 
please)
 
✓ maadhaa qult? (maah-zaah koo-let; What did 
you say?)
Here’s a conversation that puts these phrases to use:
John: ‘afwan. hal yumkin ‘an ‘as’alaka su’aal? 
(ahf-wan. hal yoom-keen an ass-ah-lah-kah soo-

John: ‘ayna al-madrasa? (eh-yeh-nah al-mah-drah-

Using command forms
When you ask someone for directions, the person 
directs you to a specific location. Essentially, he or 
she tells you where to go, which qualifies as a com-
mand form. The command form applies to all personal 
pronouns, but you have to use different commands for 
men and women. Here are some common command 
forms:
Masculine Command
Feminine Command
‘a’id (ah-eed; repeat)
‘a’idii (ah-eed-ee; repeat)
‘idhhab (eez-hab; go)
‘idhhabii (eez-hab-ee; go)

form is used to tell someone how to get to their 
destination:

P
icking the right funduq (foon-dook; hotel) for 
you and your family or friends can sometimes 
make or break your safar (sah-far; trip). During a safar 
or riHla (reeh-lah; vacation), the funduq is your home 
away from home.
In this chapter, I show you the ins and outs of choos-
ing the right funduq to meet your travel, budgetary, 
and personal needs. You find out how to inquire 
about specific aspects of the funduq (such as avail-
able amenities and proximity to the city center), 
how to make a room reservation and check into your 
room, how to interact with the funduq staff, and, last 
but not least, how to successfully check out of your 
hotel room!

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
160
If you’re staying in someone’s home (or establishing 
your own), I also offer some key terms to help you 
navigate around the house.
Choosing the Right 
Accommodation
When choosing the right funduq, you need to con-
sider a number of factors:
 
✓ thaman (tah-man; price)
 
✓ ghurfa (ghoor-fah; room)
 
✓ Hajem al-ghurfa (hah-jem al-ghoor-fah; room size)
 
✓ naw’ al-ghurfa (nah-ouh al-ghoor-fah; room type)
 
✓ khidmat al-ghurfa (keed-mat al-ghoor-fah; room 
service)
 
✓ ‘iiwaa’ (ee-wah; accommodations)
 
✓ maraafiq (mah-rah-feek; amenities)
 
✓ masbaH (mas-bah; swimming pool)
 
✓ maT’am (mat-ham; restaurant)
When inquiring about a ghurfa, you may need to use 
the following terms:
 
✓ ghurfa li-shakhS waaHid (ghoor-fah lee-sha-kes 
wah-heed; single room)
 
✓ ghurfa li-shakhsayn (ghoor-fah lee-shak-sayn; 
double room)
 
✓ sariir (sah-reer; bed)
 
✓ mirHaad (meer-had; toilet)
 
✓ balcoon (bal-koon; balcony)
 
✓ tilifizyoon (tee-lee-feez-yoon; television)
 
✓ Tabaq (tah-bak; floor/level)

 Chapter 10: Hotel or Home 161
 
To create a possessive noun in English, you 
usually use an apostrophe, such as “the girl’s 
cat” or “the woman’s house.” It’s the same in 
Arabic, except that you reverse the word 
order — you use an indefinite noun followed 
by a definite noun, as in Hajem al-ghurfa. al-
ghurfa (a definite noun because it contains 
the definite article prefix al-) means “the 
room,” and Hajem (an indefinite noun) 
means “size.” So when you read or hear 
Hajem al-ghurfa, you automatically know 
that the ghurfa is the possessor acting on 
the Hajem (size) to express the “room’s size” 
or, literally, “the size of the room.”
Here are some other phrases that may come in handy:
 
✓ ‘uriidu ‘an ‘a’raf ‘idhaa kaana ‘indakum ghuraf 
faarigha. (oo-ree-doo ann ah-raf ee-zah kah-nah 
een-dah-koom ghoo-raf fah-ree-ghah. I would like 
to know whether you have any rooms 
available.)
 
✓ hal ‘indakum ghuraf li-shakhsayn? (hal een-
dah-koom ghoo-raf lee-shak-sayn? Do you have 
any double rooms?)
 
✓ hal fii al-Hammaam duush wa banyoo? (hal fee 
al-hah-mam doosh wah ban-yoo? Is there a 
shower and a bathtub in the bathroom?)
 
✓ hal fii al-ghurfa khizaana? (hal fee al-ghoor-fah 
kee-zah-nah? Is there a safe in the room?)
 
✓ hal al-ghurfa ‘indahaa mikwaa al-malaabis? 
(hal al-ghoor-fah een-dah-hah meek-wah al-mah-
lah-bees? Does the room come equipped with a 
clothes iron?)
 
✓ kam min sariir fii haadhihi al-ghurfa? (kam 
meen sah-reer fee hah-zee-hee al-ghoor-fah? How 
many beds are in this room?)
 
✓ hal ‘indahaa balcoon? (hal een-dah-hah bal-
koon? Does it have a balcony?)
 
✓ sa-a’khudh haadhihi al-ghurfa. (sah-ah-kooz 
hah-zee-hee al-ghoor-fah. I’ll take this room.)

Making a Reservation
After you identify the right funduq with the right 
maraafiq and ghurfa, you’re ready to make a Hajzu 
(haj-zoo; reservation). Before you do, though, you 

 Chapter 10: Hotel or Home 163
have a few considerations to make, such as the dura-
tion and length of your stay, the number and type of 
ghuraf you’re reserving, the number of people stay-
ing, and the cost to stay at the funduq. This section 
explores all these elements so that you can be pre-
pared to make a smooth Hajzu and secure the best 
accommodation for your safar!
Figuring out the price
thaman (tah-man; price) is an important factor to 
think about before you make your Hajzu. Fortunately, 
there are many accommodation options to suit every 
mizaaniya (mee-zah-nee-yah; budget). If you can afford 
it, making a Hajzu in a funduq faakhir (foon-dook fah-
kheer; luxury hotel) is nice. If you’re a Taalib (tah-leeb; 
student), staying at a daar aT-Talaba (dar ah-tah-lah-
bah; youth hostel) is a more affordable option.
When making your Hajzu, be sure to inquire about 
any special tanziilaat (tan-zee-lat; discounts) that the 
funduq might be offering. Here are some tanziilaat 
you can ask about:
 
✓ tanziilaat al-majmoo’aat (tan-zee-lat al-maj-moo-
at; group discounts)
 
✓ tanziilaat as-saa’aat baTaala (tan-zee-lat ah-sah-
at bah-tah-lah; off-peak discounts)
 
✓ tanziilaat al-fuSul (tan-zee-lat al-foo-sool; sea-
sonal discounts)
 
✓ rayTaat as-safar (ray-tat ah-sah-far; special travel 
packages)
And here are some of the questions you’ll need to ask 
to take advantage of these discounts:
 
✓ kam thaman ghurfa li-shakhS waaHid li 
muddat layla waaHida? (kam tah-man ghoor-fah 
lee-sha-kes wah-heed lee moo-dat lay-lah wah-hee-
dah? How much is a single room for one night?)
 
✓ hal ‘indakum ‘ay tanziilaat li al-fuSul? (hal een-
dah-koom ay tan-zee-lat lee al-foo-sool? Do you 
have any seasonal discounts?)

Indicating the length of your stay
Making sure you get the room you want when you 
need it is as important as sticking to your funduq 
budget. Securing a ghurfa can be difficult, particularly 
during the faSl al-‘uTla (fah-sel al-oot-lah; holiday 
season); therefore, it’s advisable you make your 
Hajzu ahead of schedule so that you’re assured to 
get the ghurfa you want during the mudda (moo-dah; 
period) of your choosing.
To say you’re going to stay at the funduq “for a 
period of” so much time, use the following formula: 
li muddat (lee moo-dat) followed by the duration of 
your stay. For example, to say you’re staying “for a 
period of a week,” say li muddat ‘usbuu’ (lee moo-dat 
oos-booh). Here are some other examples:
 
✓ li muddat yawm (lee moo-dat yah-oum; for a 
period of one day)
 
✓ li muddat khamsat ‘ayyam (lee moo-dat kam-sat 
ah-yam; for a period of five days)
 
✓ li muddat ‘usbuu’ wa niSf (lee moo-dat oos-booh 
wah nee-sef; for a period of one and a half weeks)
To say that you’re staying from one date until another 
date, use the prepositions min (meen; from) and ‘ilaa 
(ee-lah; until). For example, if you’re staying “from 
Monday until Thursday,” you say min al-‘ithnayn 
‘ilaa al-khamiis (meen al-eeth-nayn ee-lah al-kah-
mees). Here are some other examples:
 
✓ min al-‘arbi’aa’ ‘ilaa al-’aHad (meen al-ar-bee-ah 
ee-lah al-ah-had; from Thursday until Sunday)
 
✓ min ‘ishriin yulyuu ‘ilaa thalaathiin yulyuu 
(meen eesh-reen yoo-leh-yoo ee-lah thah-lah-theen 
yoo-leh-yoo; from July 20 until July 30)
 
✓ min ‘aghusTus ‘ilaa sibtambar (meen ah-ghoo-
seh-toos ee-lah seeb-tam-bar; from August until 
September)
 
✓ ‘uriidu haadhihi al-ghurfa li-muddat ‘usbuu’. 
(oo-ree-doo hah-zee-hee al-ghoor-fah lee-moo-dat 

 Chapter 10: Hotel or Home 165
oos-booh. I’d like this room for a period of one 
week.)
 
✓ ‘uriidu haadhihi al-ghurfa min Disambar al-
’awwal ‘ilaa Disambar as-saabi’. (oo-ree-doo 
hah-zee-hee al-ghoor-fah meen dee-sahm-bar al-
ah-wal ee-lah dee-sahm-bar ah-sah-bee. I’d like 
this room from December 1 until December 7.)
And if you do want to take a vacation during the holi-
days, you can ask
hal haadhihi al-ghurfa mawjuuda li ‘uTlat 
nihaayat as-sana? (hal hah-zee-hee al-ghoor-fah 
maw-joo-dah lee oot-lat nee-hah-yat ah-sah-nah? Is 
this room available during the end of year 
holiday?)
 
The verb for “to stay” is baqaa in the past 
tense and yabqaa in the present. To put a fi’l 
(fee-ehl; verb) in the mustaqbal (moos-tak-
bal; future), all you do is add the prefix sa- to 
the fi’l in the present tense. For example, to 
communicate “I will stay for a period of one 
week,” you say sa-’abqaa li muddat ‘usbuu’ 
(sah-ab-qah lee moo-dat oos-booh).
Checking In to the Hotel
When you arrive at your funduq after a long safar, 
probably the last thing on your mind is going through 
the formalities of checking in. If you already have a 
Hajzu, ask the muwaDHaf al-‘istiqbaal (moo-wah-daf 
al-ees-teek-bal; desk clerk) for more ma’luumaat (mah-
loo-mat; information). You might try this phrase:
‘ahlan. ‘indii Hajzu li ghurfa li-shakhs waaHid 
li muddat ‘usbuu’ bidaa’an al-yawm. (ah-lan. 
een-dee haj-zoo lee ghoor-fah lee-shah-kes wah-
heed lee moo-dat oos-booh bee-dah-an al-yah-oum. 
Hi. I have a reservation for a single room for one 
week beginning today.)

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
166
If you don’t have a Hajzu, you can inquire about room 
mawjooda (maw-joo-dah; availability) at the front 
desk. Here are some important terms you may need 
during check-in:
 
✓ miftaH (meef-tah; key)
 
✓ miftaH al-ghurfa (meef-tah al-ghoor-fah; room 
key)
 
✓ ‘amti’a (am-tee-ah; luggage)
 
✓ shanTa (shan-tah; suitcase)
 
✓ miHfaDHa (meeh-fah-dah; briefcase)
 
✓ Tabiq (tah-beek; floor)
 
✓ miS’ad (mees-ad; elevator)
 
✓ ‘istiqbaal (ees-teek-bal; reception)
 
✓ maktab al-‘istiqbaal (mak-tab al-ees-teek-bal; 
reception desk)
 
✓ muwaDHaf al-‘istiqbaal (moo-wah-daf al-ees-
teek-bal; desk clerk) (M)
 
✓ muwaDHafa al-‘istiqbaal (moo-wah-dah-fah al-
ees-teek-bal; desk clerk) (F)
 
✓ bawwaab (bah-wab; concierge) (M)
 
✓ bawwaaba (bah-wah-bah; concierge) (F)
 
✓ maDmuun (mad-moon; included)
When interacting with the funduq staff, the following 
key phrases are likely to come in handy:
 
✓ hal al-fuTuur maDmuun ma’a al-ghurfa? (hal al-
foo-toor mad-moon mah-ah al-ghoor-fah; Is break-
fast included with the room?)
 
✓ mataa yabda’u al-fuTuur? (mah-tah yab-dah-oo 
al-foo-toor; When does breakfast begin?)
 
✓ mataa yantahii al-fuTuur? (mah-tah yan-tah-hee 
al-foo-toor; When does breakfast end?)
 
✓ hal hunaaka khabaran lii? (hal hoo-nah-kah kah-
bah-ran lee; Are there any messages for me?)

 Chapter 10: Hotel or Home 167
 
✓ ‘uriidu nahaad bi shakel mukaalama ma’a as-
saa’a as-saabi’a. (oo-ree-doo nah-had bee shah-kel 
moo-kah-lah-mah mah-ah ah-sah-ah ah-sah-bee-ah; 
I would like a wake-up call at 7:00.)
 
✓ hal ‘indakum mushrifat al-ghurfa? (hal een-dah-
koom moosh-ree-fat al-ghoor-fah; Do you have 
room service?)
Here are some phrases you might hear from the hotel 
staff:
 
✓ ghurfatuka fii aT-Tabiq as-saadis. (ghoor-fah-
too-kah fee ah-tah-beek ah-sah-dees. Your room is 
located on the sixth floor.)
 
✓ haa huwa al-miftaH. (hah hoo-wah al-meef-tah. 
Here is your room key.)
 
✓ hal ‘indaka ‘amti’a? (hal een-dah-kah am-tee-ah? 
Do you have any luggage?)
 
✓ al-Hammaal sa-yusaa’iduka ‘ilaa al-ghurfa. (al-
hah-mal sah-yoo-sah-ee-doo-kah ee-lah al-ghoor-
fah. The baggage handler will help you to your 
room.)
Checking Out of the Hotel
After your stay at the funduq, it’s time for waqt al-
khuruuj (wah-ket al-koo-rooj; checkout). The following 
phrases will help you check out on time: 
 
✓ mataa waqt al-khuruuj? (mah-tah wah-ket al-
koo-rooj? When is the checkout time?)
 
✓ maa hiya al-faatuura al-’aama? (mah hee-yah al-
fah-too-rah al-ah-mah? What’s the total bill?)
 
✓ ‘uriidu ‘iiSaala min faDlik. (oo-ree-doo ee-sah-
lah meen fad-leek. I’d like a receipt please.)
Before you leave the funduq, make sure you get all 
your stuff from your ghurfa, and take care of the bill. 
Some common extra charges to watch out for on your 
faatuura (fah-too-rah; bill) include:

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
168
 
✓ faatuura al-haatif (fah-too-rah al-hah-teef; tele-
phone bill)
 
✓ faatuura at-tilfaaz (fah-too-rah ah-teel-faz; TV 
pay-per-view bill)
 
✓ faatuura aT-Ta’aam (fah-too-rah ah-tah-am; food 
bill)
When you pay the faatuura, it’s a good idea to get an 
‘iiSaala (eeh-sah-lah; receipt) in case you have a prob-
lem with the bill later on or can be reimbursed for 
your travel costs.
Life at Home
If you’re like most people, you spend a lot of time at 
your manzil (man-zeel; house). The manzil is a bit dif-
ferent than the bayt (bah-yet; home) because a manzil 
can be any old manzil, whereas the bayt is the space 
where you feel most comfortable. In many cultures, a 
manzil is a family’s or individual’s most prized pos-
session or asset.
As you know, a manzil consists of ghuraf (ghoo-raf; 
rooms). This list should help you become familiar 
with the major types of ghuraf in a manzil:
 
✓ ghurfat al-juluus (ghoor-fat al-joo-loos; sitting 
room)
 
✓ ghurfat al-ma’iisha (ghoor-fat al-mah-ee-shah; 
living room)
 
✓ ghurfat al-‘akl (ghoor-fat al-ah-kel; dining room)
 
✓ ghurfat an-nawm (ghoor-fat ah-nah-wem; 
bedroom)
 
✓ Hammaam (hah-mam; bathroom)
 
✓ ghurfat al-ghasl (ghoor-fat al-ghah-sel; washing/
laundry room)
 
✓ maTbakh (mat-bak; kitchen)

 Chapter 10: Hotel or Home 169
In addition to ghuraf, a manzil may also have a 
karaaj (kah-raj; garage) where you can park your 
sayyaara (sah-yah-rah; car), as well as a bustaan 
(boos-tan; garden) where you can play or just relax. 
Some manaazil (mah-nah-zeel; houses) even have a 
masbaH (mas-bah; swimming pool).
Each ghurfa in the manzil contains different items. 
For example, you can expect to find a sariir (sah-reer; 
bed) in a ghurfat an-nawm. Here are some items you 
can expect to find in the Hammaam:
 
✓ mirHaaD (meer-had; toilet)
 
✓ duush (doosh; shower)
 
✓ maghsala (mag-sah-lah; sink)
 
✓ shawkat al-‘asnaan (shaw-kat al-ass-nan; 
toothbrush)
 
✓ ghasuul as-sha’r (ghah-sool ah-shah-er; 
shampoo)
 
✓ Saabuun (sah-boon; soap)
 
✓ mir’aat (meer-at; mirror)
You can expect to find the following items in the 
maTbakh:
 
✓ furn (foo-ren; stove)
 
✓ tannuur (tah-noor; oven)
 
✓ thallaaja (thah-lah-jah; refrigerator)
 
✓ zubaala (zoo-bah-lah; trash can)
 
✓ shawkaat (shaw-kat; forks)
 
✓ malaa’iq (mah-lah-eek; spoons)
 
✓ sakaakiin (sah-kah-keen; knives)
 
✓ ku’uus (koo-oos; glasses)
 
✓ ‘aTbaaq (at-bak; dishes)

Emergencies

H
andling an emergency in your native tongue can 
be difficult enough to deal with, and dealing with 
a situation in a foreign language such as Arabic may 
seem daunting. But don’t panic! In this chapter, I give 
you the right words, phrases, and procedures to help 
you overcome an emergency situation — whether 
medical, legal, or political.
Shouting Out for Help
When you’re witnessing or experiencing an emer-
gency such as a theft, a fire, or even someone having 
a heart attack, your first instinct is to yell musaa’ada 
(moo-sah-ah-dah; help)! This section tells you which 
words to use to express your sense of emergency ver-
bally in order to get the right kind of musaa’ada.
Arabic has two words that mean “help”: musaa’ada 
(moo-sah-ah-dah) and mu’aawana (moo-ah-wah-nah). 
Both words are used interchangeably to ask for help 
in an emergency. You attract even more attention 
when you shout the words consecutively:

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
172
 
✓ musaa’ada musaa’ada! (moo-sah-ah-dah moo-
sah-ah-dah; Help help!)
 
✓ mu’aawana mu’aawana! (moo-ah-wah-nah moo-
ah-wah-nah; Help help!)
Arabic actually has a third word that means “help”: 
najda (nah-jeh-dah). You can use najda to call for help, 
but be aware that screaming najda means that someone 
is in a severe, extremely dangerous, life-and-death situa-
tion. (If there were degrees to words for “help” — where 
level 3 is high and level 5 is extreme — musaa’ada and 
mu’aawana would be level 3s and najda would be a 
level 5.)
If you’re witnessing or experiencing a drowning, a 
heart attack, or a suicide attempt, you should scream 
najda like this:
an-najda an-najda! (ahn-nah-jeh-dah ahn-nah-jeh-
dah; Help help!) 
Here are some other important words and phrases to 
help you cope with an emergency:
 
✓ saa’iduunii! (sah-ee-doo-nee; Help me!)
 
✓ ‘aawinuunii! (ah-wee-noo-nee; Help me!)
 
✓ shurTa! (shoo-reh-tah; Police!)
 
✓ ‘uriidu Tabiib! (oo-ree-doo tah-beeb; I need a 
doctor!)
 
✓ liSS! (lehs; Thief!)
 
✓ naar! (nahr; Fire!)
A little help with the verb “to help”
 
The word musaa’ada is derived from the 
verb saa’ada (sah-ah-dah), which means “to 
help.” Although screaming musaa’ada is an 
important first step to attract attention to an 
emergency, you also need to be able to 
coherently formulate a sentence in order to 

 Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 173
get the right kind of help. Use the form 
saa’ada to conjugate the verb “to help” in the 
past tense and yusaa’idu (yoo-sah-ee-doo) to 
conjugate it in the present tense. Table 11-1 
shows the past tense. (Check out Chapter 2 
for a quick reminder of the tenses.)

Use the form yusaa’idu to conjugate “to help” in the

 Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 175
 
Although Arabic has more than one word for 
“help,” musaa’ada is the most conjugated 
verb form. mu’aawana may also be conju-
gated using the form ‘aawana in the past 
tense and yu’aawinu in the present tense, 
but it’s more of an archaic and arcane verb 
that isn’t widely used in everyday Arabic. 
Because najda is more of a code word for 
distress, it doesn’t have a verb equivalent 
form.
Lending a hand
Being in an emergency doesn’t always mean that 
you’re the one who needs help. You may be faced 
with a situation where you’re actually the person 
who’s in a position to offer help. The first thing you 
do in such a situation is ask questions to assess the 
damage and determine what course of action to take:
 
✓ maadhaa waqa’a? (mah-zah wah-qah-ah; What 
happened?)
 
✓ hal kul shay’ bikhayr? (hal kool shah-yeh bee-
kayr; Is everything all right?)
 
✓ hal turiidu musaa’ada? (hal too-ree-doo moo-
sah-ah-dah; Do you want help?)
 
✓ hal yajibu ‘an tadhhab ‘ilaa al-mustashfaa? (hal 
yah-jee-boo ann taz-hab ee-laa al-moos-tash-fah; 
Do you need to go to the hospital?)
 
✓ hal turiidu Tabiib? (hal too-ree-doo tah-beeb; Do 
you want a doctor?)
If you’re in a situation in which injuries are serious 
and the person appears to be disoriented, then you 
must take further steps, such as contacting the shurTa 
(shoo-reh-tah; police) or other first responders.
If you’re ever in a situation where you need to call 
the police, you may say the following on the phone: 
‘aHtaaju bi musaa’ada fawran (ah-tah-joo bee moo-
sah-ah-dah faw-ran; I need help right away). 

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
176
Here’s an example of how you can ask someone 
whether they need help:
Lamia: ‘afwan. hal kul shay’ bikhayr? (ah-feh-
wan. hal kool shah-yeh bee-kayr? Excuse me. Is 
everything all right?)
Woman: na’am. kul shay’ bikhayr. (nah-am. kool 
shah-yeh bee-kayr. Yes. Everything is all right.)
Lamia: maadhaa waqa’a? (mah-zah wah-qah-ah? 
What happened?)
Woman: laa shay’. laqad saqaTtu. (lah shah-yeh. 
lah-kad sah-qah-too. Nothing. I fell.)
Lamia: hal turiidiina musaa’ada? (hal too-ree-
dee-nah moo-sah-ah-dah? Do you need help?)
Woman: laa shukran. kul shay’ sayakun 
bikhayr. (lah shook-ran. kool shah-yeh sah-yah-
koon bee-kayr. No thank you. I will be all right.)
Getting Medical Help
Visiting the doctor is sometimes essential, and this 
section introduces you to important medical terms to 
help you interact effectively with medical staff.
Locating the appropriate doctor
In case of a medical urgency, your first stop should 
be the mustashfaa (moos-tash-fah; hospital) to see 
a Tabiib (tah-beeb; doctor). If you simply need a 
checkup, go see a Tabiib ‘aam (tah-beeb ahm; general 
doctor). If your needs are more specific, look for one 
of these specialist doctors:
 
✓ Tabiib ‘asnaan (tah-beeb ahs-nan; dentist)
 
✓ Tabiib ‘aynayn (tah-beeb ah-yeh-nayn; 
ophthalmologist)
 
✓ Tabiib rijl (tah-beeb ree-jel; orthopedist)
 
✓ Tabiib ‘aTfaal (tah-beeb aht-fal; pediatrician)

 Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 177
Talking about your body
Locating the right doctor is only the first step toward 
getting treatment. In order to interact with the Tabiib, 
you need to be able to identify your different body 
parts in Arabic, explaining which parts hurt and 
which are fine. Table 11-3 lists all your major body 
parts.

Explaining your symptoms
The Tabiib can’t provide you with the proper treat-
ment unless you communicate the kind of pain you’re 
experiencing. How mariiD (mah-reed; sick) do you 
feel? Do you have a SuDaa’ (soo-dah; headache)? Or 
perhaps a Haraara (hah-rah-rah; fever)? Table 11-4 
lists common symptoms.

When you go to the Tabiib, he or she may ask you, 
maadha yu’limuka? (mah-zah yoo-lee-moo-kah; What 
hurts you?). The most common way to respond to 
this question is to name the body part that hurts fol-
lowed by yu’limunii (yoo-lee-moo-nee; hurts me).
So when the Tabiib asks maadha yu’limuka?, you 
may say:
 
✓ ra’sii yu’limunii. (rah-see yoo-lee-moo-nee; My 
head hurts me.)
 
✓ Sadrii yu’limunii. (sah-der-ee yoo-lee-moo-nee. 
My chest hurts me.)
 
✓ diraa’ii yu’limunii. (dee-rah-ee yoo-lee-moo-nee. 
My arm hurts me.)
Getting treatment
After the Tabiib analyzes your symptoms, he or she 
is able to offer you ‘ilaaj (ee-laj; treatment). Following 
the Tabiib’s orders is important for both getting and 
remaining saliim (sah-leem; healthy), so pay atten-

Acquiring Legal Help
Let’s hope it’s never the case, but you may have 
a run-in with the law and need the services of a 
muHaamiiy (moo-hah-mee; lawyer). The muHaamiiy 
has a good understanding of the qaanuun (qah-noon; 
law) and is in a position to help you if you’re ever 
charged with committing a mujrima (mooj-ree-mah; 
crime).
 
If you happen to be in a foreign country and 
need legal representation, the best route is 
to contact your country’s qunSuliyya (koon-
soo-lee-yah; consulate) and ask to speak to 

 Chapter 11: Dealing with Emergencies 181
the qunSul (koon-sool; consul). Because con-
sular officers have a very good understand-
ing of the laws of their host countries, you 
may be better off getting help directly from 
them rather than finding your own 
muHaamiiy. Especially if it looks like you 
have to go to maHkama (mah-kah-mah; 
court) and face a qaadiiy (qah-dee; judge), 
the help a qunSuliyya can provide is 
invaluable.
You may also want to call your country’s sifaara 
(see-fah-rah; embassy) if you’re in a really serious situ-
ation. Even if you’re unable to talk to the safiir (sah-
feer; ambassador) directly, your sifaara may take the 
appropriate steps to provide you with assistance.

Ten Favorite Arabic 
Expressions
A
rabic uses a lot of colorful expressions and 
words. Here are ten of the best.
marHaba bikum!
mahr-hah-bah bee-koom; Welcome to all of you!
This term of welcoming is extremely popular with 
Arabic speakers. It’s usually said with a lot of zest 
and enthusiasm and is often accompanied by very 
animated hand gestures. It’s not uncommon for some-
one to say marHaba bikum and then proceed to hug 
you or give you a kiss on the cheek. This expression 
is a very affectionate form of greeting someone, such 
as an old friend, a very special guest, or a close rela-
tive. But the relationship doesn’t necessarily have to 
be a close one — if you’re ever invited into a Middle 
Eastern home for a dinner or a lunch, don’t be sur-
prised if the host jovially shouts marHaba bikum and 
gives you a great big bear hug!
mumtaaz!
moom-tahz; Excellent!
This expression is a way to note that something 
is going very well. A teacher may tell her students 
mumtaaz if they conjugate a difficult Arabic verb in 

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
184
the past tense, or a fan may yell mumtaaz if his team 
scores a goal against an opponent. mumtaaz is used 
during joyous events or as a sign of encouragement. 
It’s a very positive word that Arabic speakers like to 
use because it connotes a positive attitude.
al-Hamdu li-llah
al-hahm-doo lee-lah; Praise to God
al-Hamdu li-llah is a part of everyday Arabic. Arabic 
speakers say al-Hamdu li-llah after performing almost 
any task, including finishing a meal, drinking water, 
finishing a project at work, and running an errand. 
The expression’s extensive application goes beyond 
completing tasks; for example, if someone asks you 
kayf al-Haal? (kah-yef al-hal; How are you doing?), 
you may reply al-Hamdu li-llah and mean “Praise to 
God; I’m doing well.” Because of its versatility, it’s 
customary to hear al-Hamdu li-llah quite often when 
native speakers are talking to each other.
inshaa’ allah
een-shah-ah ah-lah; If God wishes it
If you’ve ever watched Arabic speakers on Arabic 
TV, you’ve probably heard them use the expression 
inshaa’ allah. This expression, which literally means 
“If God wishes it” or “If God wills it,” is very popu-
lar among Arabic speakers when discussing future 
events. It’s almost a rule that whenever someone 
brings up an event that will take place in the future, 
the expression inshaa’ allah follows soon after. For 
example, when someone asks you how you think 
you’re going to do on your next exam, you say, ‘ata-
mannaa ‘an ‘anjaH inshaa’ allah (ah-tah-mah-nah 
ann an-jaheen-shah-ah ah-lah; I hope I do well, if God 
wishes it). 

 Chapter 12: Ten Favorite Arabic Expressions 185
mabruk!
mahb-rook; Blessing upon you!
The root of the word mabruk is the noun baraka 
(bah-rah-kah), which means “blessing.” mabruk is 
used at joyous occasions, such as the birth of a baby 
or a wedding ceremony. Though its strict interpreta-
tion is “Blessing upon you,” mabruk is just like saying 
“Congratulations.” When you say mabruk, make sure 
you say it with a lot of energy and enthusiasm!
bi ‘idni allah
bee eed-nee ah-lah; With God’s guidance
This expression is meant to motivate and offer sup-
port and guidance, and although this expression 
contains a reference to God, it’s actually a lot less 
common than expressions such as inshaa’ allah or 
al-Hamdu li-llah. That’s because bii ‘idni allah is 
used only during very special occasions, when one 
is facing serious challenges or is having difficulty in 
life, marriage, work, or school. Whenever someone’s 
facing hardship, it’s common for him or her to say 
sa-‘uwaajihu haadhihi as-su’uubu bi ‘idni allah (sah-
oo-wah-jee-hoo hah-zee-hee ah-so-oo-boo bee eed-nee 
ah-lah; I will face this difficulty, with God’s guidance). 
bi SaHHa
bee sah-hah; With strength
Even though this expression literally means “with 
strength,” it’s not necessarily used in a context of 
encouragement or support like bi ‘idni allah is. 
Rather, bi SaHHa is an appropriate thing to say after 
someone has finished a difficult task and can relax. 

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
186
For example, if a friend has wrapped up writing a 
book, closed a big deal, or ended a difficult case, you 
may say to him bi SaHHa, which signifies that your 
friend will be stronger as a result of accomplishing 
what he’s accomplished and now can rest a bit.
taHiyyaat
tah-hee-yat; Regards
taHiyyaat is a religious term that Muslims use when 
they’re praying. After a Muslim finishes praying, he 
performs the taHiyyaat by turning once to the right 
and once to the left, acknowledging the two angels 
that Muslims believe guard each person. In addition 
to its religious affiliation, Arabic speakers commonly 
use taHiyyaat to send their regards. For instance, a 
friend may say to you, salaam ‘an ‘abuuka (sah-lam 
ann ah-boo-kah; Say hello to your father for me.) 
Similarly, to send your regards to a friend, you say, 
taHiyyaat.
muballagh
moo-bah-lag; Equally
muballagh is an expression that’s similar to taHi-
yyaat in that you use it to send regards. However, 
unlike taHiyyaat, muballagh is a response; that is, 
you use it after someone sends their regards to you. 
So if someone says to you, salaam ‘an ‘ukhtuk (sah-
lam ann ook-took; Say hello to your sister for me), you 
respond, muballagh. Responding with this expression 
means that you acknowledge the message and thank 
the person for it on behalf of your sister. So make 
sure to say muballagh only after someone sends their 
regards — not before!

 Chapter 12: Ten Favorite Arabic Expressions 187
tabaaraka allah
tah-bah-rah-kah ah-lah; With God’s blessing
This expression is the equivalent of “God bless you” 
in English; it’s most commonly used among close 
friends or family members to congratulate each other 
on accomplishments, achievements, or other happy 
events. For instance, if a son or daughter receives 
a good grade on an exam, the parents would say, 
tabaaraka allah. Another very popular use for this 
expression is to express warmth and joy toward kids.

Ten Great Arabic 
Proverbs
E
ven if you’ve read only a few chapters of this 
book, you’ve probably figured out that Arabic is 
a very poetic language. One aspect of the language 
that reinforces its poetic nature is the use of ‘amthila 
(am-thee-lah; proverbs). Proverbs play an important 
role in the Arabic language. If you’re having a conver-
sation with an Arabic speaker or listening to Arabic 
speakers converse among themselves, don’t be sur-
prised to hear proverbs peppered throughout the 
conversation. This chapter introduces you to some of 
the more common and flowery proverbs of the Arabic 
language.
al-’amthaal noor al-kalaam.
al-am-thal noor al-kah-lam; Proverbs are the light of 
speech.
The role of proverbs in Arabic is so important that 
there’s a proverb on the importance of proverbs!
‘a’mal khayr wa ‘ilqahu 
fii al-baHr.
ah-mal kah-yer wah eel-qah-hoo fee al-bah-her; 
Do good and cast it into the sea.

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
190
Arab culture emphasizes humility and modesty. 
This proverb means that when you commit a chari-
table act, you shouldn’t go around boasting about it; 
rather, you should “cast it into the sea” where no one 
can find out about it.
‘uTlubuu al-’ilm min al-mahd 
‘ilaa al-laHd.
oot-loo-boo al-ee-lem meen al-mahd ee-lah al-lah-hed; 
Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave.
al-’ilm (al-ee-lem; knowledge) is an important virtue 
in Arabic culture. Arabs have produced some of the 
greatest legal, medical, and scientific minds in his-
tory, in no small part because Arabs like to instill in 
their children a lifelong desire to learn and continue 
learning every single day of one’s existence.
yad waaHida maa tusaffiq.
yad wah-hee-dah mah too-sah-feek; A hand by itself 
cannot clap.
This proverb, which is common in the West but origi-
nates in Arab culture, underscores the importance of 
teamwork, cooperation, and collaboration.
al-Harbaa’ laa Yughaadir 
shajaratuh hattaa yakun 
mu’akkid ‘an shajara ‘ukhraa.
al-har-bah lah yoo-gah-deer shah-jah-rah-tooh hah-tah 
yah-koon moo-ah-keed ann shah-jah-rah ook-rah; The 

 Chapter 13: Ten Great Arabic Proverbs 191
chameleon does not leave his tree until he is sure of 
another.
This proverb stresses the importance of foresight, 
planning, and looking ahead. A chameleon that is 
mindful of predators won’t change trees until it knows 
that it’ll be safe in the next tree it goes to.
khaTa’ ma’roof ‘aHsan min 
Haqiiqa ghayr ma’roofa.
kah-tah mah-roof ah-san meen hah-kee-kah gah-yer 
mah-roo-fah; A known mistake is better than an 
unknown truth.
This metaphysical proverb has a deep meaning: It’s 
better for you to identify and learn from a mistake 
than not to know a truth at all. In the debate of known 
versus unknown knowledge, this proverb indicates 
that knowing is better than not knowing, even if what 
you know is not an absolute truth.
as-sirr mithel al-Hamaama: 
‘indamaa yughaadir yadii yaTiir.
ah-seer mee-thel al-hah-mah-mah: een-dah-mah yoo-gah-
deer yah-dee yah-teer; A secret is like a dove: When it 
leaves my hand, it flies away.
A secret is meant to be kept close to your chest — in 
other words, you shouldn’t divulge a secret. As soon 
as you let a secret out of your “hand,” it flies away and 
spreads around. Just as a dove won’t leave unless you 
release it, a secret won’t become known unless you 
divulge it.

Arabic Phrases For Dummies 
192
al-’aql li an-niDHaar wa al-kalb 
li as-simaa’.
al-ah-kel lee ah-nee-zar wah al-kah-leb lee ah-see-mah; 
The mind is for seeing, and the heart is for hearing.
The mind is to be used for analytical purposes: obser-
vation and analysis. The heart, on the other hand, 
is for emotions; you should listen and feel with your 
heart.
kul yawm min Hayaatuk SafHa 
min taariikhuk.
kool yah-oum meen hah-yah-took saf-hah meen tah-ree-
kook; Every day of your life is a page of your 
history.
You only live one life, so you should enjoy every 
single day. At the end, each day’s experiences are 
what make up your history.
li faatik bi liila faatik bi Hiila.
lee fah-tek bee lee-lah fah-tek bee hee-lah; He who sur-
passes (is older than) you by one night surpasses you 
by one idea.
In Arabic culture and society, maturity and respect 
for elders is a highly regarded virtue. This proverb 
reinforces the idea that elders are respected, and 
their counsel is sought often.
