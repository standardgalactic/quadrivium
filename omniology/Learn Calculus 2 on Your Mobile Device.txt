What Makes This Book Different
What Makes This Book Diﬀerent?
Thousands of books have been written about calculus. I recently performed a book
search on Amazon.com that returned over 57,000 results for the term “calculus”. Do we
really need another calculus textbook?
So, what makes this book diﬀerent?
The way I see it, some points of distinction
between this book and others include:
• Open learning design
• Multimodal learning format
• Live–streaming presentations
• Active learning spaces
• Optimization for mobile devices.
Open learning design
My tagline of“everyone deserves access to learning on a level playing ﬁeld”is grounded
in the belief that open access to education is a public right and a public good. The design
of this book follows these beliefs in the sense that the book is absolutely free; and does
not require any special software to function. The book can be printed out or used purely
in electronic form.
Multimodal learning format
Traditional textbooks feature, well, text. In recent years, graphics have played a more
common role within textbooks, especially with the move away from black and white texts
to full colour. However, the traditional textbook is still percieved as being static and
unimodal in the sense that you can read the text. While some texts have attempted to
use video as an “added extra”, the current textbook aims to fully integrate online video
into the learning experience. When the rich and expressive format of video is integrated
with simple text it leads to what I call a multimodal learning experience (sight, sound,
movement etc), going way beyond what a traditional textbook can oﬀer.
Live–streaming presentations
The video tutorials that are integrated into this textbook are all“live–streamed”. This
means that the presentations go out live, with no editing or postproduction. They have a
distinctly low budget feel. It’s my view that the live element makes the presentations feel
more engaging, dynamic and real. The use of live–streamed video is one of the aspects
that makes this book unique.

What Makes This Book Different
Active Learning Spaces
It’s far too easy to sit back and just passively “watch” – whether it’s a lecture, a
tutorial, a TV show or an online video. However, learning is not a spectator sport. I
believe in the power of active learning: that is, in learners doing things and thinking
about what they are doing and what they have done.
To encourage active learning, this book features blank spaces where learners are re-
quired to actively engage by taking notes, making annotations, drawing diagrams and the
like. I call these blank spaces “active learning spaces”.
Optimization for mobile devices
The ﬁnal dimension of this book that makes it unique is in its optimization for mobile
devices. By this, I mean that all of the associated online videos have been designed with
small screens in mind. The aim is to enable learning anywhere, anytime on smart phones,
tablets and laptops.

Functions of Two Variables

Chapter 1
Functions of Two Variables
One of the aims of mathematics is to act as a scientiﬁc framework from which we can
model and understand our world. In our quest to better–understand more complicated
phenomena, we require more sophisticated mathematics that is up to the task.
In this section we look at functions that depend on two variables. In doing so, we
extend our capability of basic modeling through functions such as y = f(x) where there is
one (dependent) variable, to the case of z = f(x, y), where now there are two independent
variables x and y.

Functions of Two Variables
In particular, we will learn how to extend and apply basic calculus in the wider setting
of functions of two variables. In a nutshell, calculus is concerned with rates of change,
and the ideas form an important part of applied mathematics. In this chapter we will
look at problems concerning: partial derivatives; second–order partial derivatives (there
are four!); chain rule(s); error estimation; and some geometrical concepts, such as normal
vector and tangent plane to a surface.
The ideas herein generalise to the case when a function has more than two variables
in a standard way.

Chapter 2
Techniques of Integration
If diﬀerentiation is the“yin”of calculus, then integration is the“yang”. In fact, the two
are reverse processes and one cannot really get a good understanding of calculus without
mastery of both parts and comprehension of the connection between them.
In this section, we explore various techniques that are used in integration processes.
While the diﬀerent techniques may seem rather random in nature at times, the common
principle throughout is to turn a complicated integral into something that is simpler and
more managable. Possible techniques involve: using a substitution; applying trigonometric
formulae; employing a reduction formula; completing the square in the denominator; or
exerting the method of partial fractions. We shall meet all of these ideas in this chapter.

The examples in this chapter will assume the reader can recall basic identities, such
as
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
sin2 x + cos2 x = 1
tan2 x + 1 = sec2 x
cos 2x = 2 cos2 x −1.
The approach is reasonably theoretical in this chapter, but we’ll see some nice applications
of integration in the ﬁnal chapter of this book.

First Order Ordinary Differential Equations

Chapter 3
First Order Ordinary Diﬀerential
Equations
An “ordinary diﬀerential equation” (ODE) involves at least two things:
1. the derivative(s) of a function of one variable;
2. an equals sign.
A general (ﬁrst order) form of an ODE is
dy
dx = f(x, y)
where f is a known function of two variables and y = y(x) is the unknown function.
The motivation for the study of diﬀerential equations lies in their use in applications.
By solving diﬀerential equations we can gain a deeper understanding of the physical
processes that the equations are describing.

First Order Ordinary Differential Equations
Like most equations arising in mathematics and its applications, we want to “solve”
these kinds of equations. Thus, we try to ﬁnd a function y = y(x) that satisﬁes the
diﬀerential equation for all values of x in some interval I. Rather than taking an arbitrary
guess at what the solution might be, we will build up a collection of solution methods,
basing our choice of method on the form of the diﬀerential equation under consideration.
The use of diﬀerential equations may empower us to make precise predictions about the
future behaviour of our models. Even if we can’t completely solve a diﬀerential equation,
we may still be able to determine useful properties about its solution (so–called qualitative
information).
In this chapter we discuss some basic ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations that can be
explicitly solved.

Second Order Ordinary Diﬀerential
Equations
Of all the diﬀerent types of diﬀerential equations, the form
ay′′ + by′ + cy = 0
(4.0.1)
is perhaps the most important due to its simplicity and ability to model a wide range of
phenomena. Above: a, b and c are given constants.
We will concentrate our analysis on solving a quadratic equation that is related to
(4.0.1). This special polynomial equation is called the “characteristic equation” (or auxil-
iary equation) of (4.0.1) and is
aλ2 + bλ + c = 0.

Second Order Ordinary Differential Equations
We normally go straight to the characteristic equation (4.0.2), solve it and simply
write down the “general solution”, which is formed by taking all linear combinations of
any two (linearly independent) solutions to (4.0.1).
In this chapter, we’ll see several examples involving the above process. We’ll also see
a connection between solutions to (4.0.1) and solutions to a more general problem when
the right hand side of (4.0.1) has “0” replaced by a known function of x.
By the way, (4.0.2) arises from the assumption that solutions y to (4.0.1)“don’t change
much when diﬀerentiated”, as the derivatives in the left hand side of (4.0.1) need to add
up to zero. Such an assumed form is something like y = Aeλx where A is a constant and
λ is to be determined.

Sequences and Series of Constants
Chapter 5
Sequences and Series of Constants
The ﬁrst part of this chapter explores sequences. Sequences are like functions, where
the domain is restricted to whole numbers.
Sequences occur in nature all around us and a good understanding enables accurate
modelling of many “discrete” phenomena. For example, you might have heard of a Fi-
bonacci sequence which is seen in describing population models, such as in the breeding
of rabbits; and the reproduction of honey bees.
Sequences are also a very useful tool in approximating solutions to complicated equa-
tions. For example, you may have come across the Newton–Raphson method for approxi-
mating the solutions of equations. The method employs a basic sequence where a solution
to the problem is obtained via a limiting process.
Sequences are also one of the basic building blocks in the fascinating area of “mathe-
matical analysis”.
In this section we will see how we can apply various methods from calculus to calculate
the limit of a sequence.
That is, if an is a sequence of numbers (with domain, say,
n = 1, 2, 3, . . .) then what is
lim
n→∞an?
We will use basic identities, such as
eln x = x
and apply the squeeze theorem (also called the sandwich theorem and the pinching theo-
rem).
In the second part of this chapter, we investigate inﬁnite series. Inﬁnite series are a
fundamental pillar of integration and integral calculus.
An inﬁnite series is the sum of an inﬁnite sequence of numbers:
a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · =
∞

i=1
ai
How to add together inﬁnitely many numbers is not so clear.
Inﬁnite series sometimes have a ﬁnite sum. For example, consider
1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + · · · = 1
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

LEARN CALCULUS 2 ON 
YOUR MOBILE DEVICE
41
Sequences and Series of Constants
41
which may be veriﬁed by adding up the areas of the repeatedly halved unit square.
Other series do not have a ﬁnite value. Consider
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + · · ·
It is not obvious whether the following inﬁnite series has a ﬁnite value or not
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + · · ·
We will explore diﬀerent approaches to answer the question, does a given series “con-
verge” in the sense that the following limit exists (and is ﬁnite)
lim
N→∞(a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + aN) =
∞

i=1
ai.
The tools that we shall consider include: telescoping sums; the integral test; the compar-
ison test; the ratio test; and the alternating series test.

Chapter 6
Power Series
Power series aim to express a function f = f(x) in terms of an inﬁnite sum involving
powers of x, namely in the form
a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + · · ·
(6.0.1)
where the numbers ai are either given, or are to be determined.
From a calculus point of view, one of the advantages of writing a suitable function f
in the form (6.0.1) is due to powers of x being easy to integrate and diﬀerentiate.

Power Series
In this chapter, we’ll look at: how to determine the domain of a given power series
(the so–called interval of convergence); how to determine a special power series (known
as a Maclaurin series) of a given function; gaining some idea of how to use power series to
obtain other interesting results. We’ll also look at how polynomials can approximate given
functions, which is important from an approximation point of view: try to approximate
complicated functions with simple polynomials.
In our work with Maclaurin series, we will use the identity
n! := n(n −1) · · · 3 · 2 · 1.

Chapter 7
Applications of Integration
In this chapter, we look at some of the geometric uses for integration. In a ﬁrst course
in calculus, you see integration as a means for computing area under a curve. We now
move to the next phase, illustrating how integration can be used for obtaining: the length
of a curve; surface area; and the volume of a certain solids.
Although not explicitly mentioned in this chapter, the idea above are of more than
just geometrical interest. If we wish to compute the total mass of a spring, for example,
and the spring is in the shape of a known function and has a constant density, then being
able to calculate the length of the spring is key to the total mass calculation.
There is much more about these kinds of applications in [35].
The identity
cos 2x = 1 −2 sin2 x
will be required in the ﬁnal example on volume.
