Real Functions in Several Variables: Volume-I 
Point sets in Rn

Preface
Preface
The topic of this series of books on “Real Functions in Several Variables” is very important in the
description in e.g. Mechanics of the real 3-dimensional world that we live in. Therefore, we start from
the very beginning, modelling this world by using the coordinates of R3 to describe e.g. a motion in
space. There is, however, absolutely no reason to restrict ourselves to R3 alone. Some motions may
be rectilinear, so only R is needed to describe their movements on a line segment. This opens up for
also dealing with R2, when we consider plane motions. In more elaborate problems we need higher
dimensional spaces. This may be the case in Probability Theory and Statistics. Therefore, we shall in
general use Rn as our abstract model, and then restrict ourselves in examples mainly to R2 and R3.
For rectilinear motions the familiar rectangular coordinate system is the most convenient one to apply.
However, as known from e.g. Mechanics, circular motions are also very important in the applications
in engineering. It becomes natural alternatively to apply in R2 the so-called polar coordinates in the
plane. They are convenient to describe a circle, where the rectangular coordinates usually give some
nasty square roots, which are diﬃcult to handle in practice.
Rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates are designed to model each their problems.
They
supplement each other, so diﬃcult computations in one of these coordinate systems may be easy, and
even trivial, in the other one. It is therefore important always in advance carefully to analyze the
geometry of e.g. a domain, so we ask the question: Is this domain best described in rectangular or in
polar coordinates?
Sometimes one may split a problem into two subproblems, where we apply rectangular coordinates in
one of them and polar coordinates in the other one.
It should be mentioned that in real life (though not in these books) one cannot always split a problem
into two subproblems as above.
Then one is really in trouble, and more advanced mathematical
methods should be applied instead. This is, however, outside the scope of the present series of books.
The idea of polar coordinates can be extended in two ways to R3. Either to semi-polar or cylindric
coordinates, which are designed to describe a cylinder, or to spherical coordinates, which are excellent
for describing spheres, where rectangular coordinates usually are doomed to fail. We use them already
in daily life, when we specify a place on Earth by its longitude and latitude! It would be very awkward
in this case to use rectangular coordinates instead, even if it is possible.
Concerning the contents, we begin this investigation by modelling point sets in an n-dimensional
Euclidean space En by Rn.
There is a subtle diﬀerence between En and Rn, although we often
identify these two spaces. In En we use geometrical methods without a coordinate system, so the
objects are independent of such a choice. In the coordinate space Rn we can use ordinary calculus,
which in principle is not possible in En. In order to stress this point, we call En the “abstract space”
(in the sense of calculus; not in the sense of geometry) as a warning to the reader. Also, whenever
necessary, we use the colour black in the “abstract space”, in order to stress that this expression is
theoretical, while variables given in a chosen coordinate system and their related concepts are given
the colours blue, red and green.
We also include the most basic of what mathematicians call Topology, which will be necessary in the
following. We describe what we need by a function.
Then we proceed with limits and continuity of functions and deﬁne continuous curves and surfaces,
with parameters from subsets of R and R2, resp..

Preface
Continue with (partial) diﬀerentiable functions, curves and surfaces, the chain rule and Taylor’s for-
mula for functions in several variables.
We deal with maxima and minima and extrema of functions in several variables over a domain in Rn.
This is a very important subject, so there are given many worked examples to illustrate the theory.
Then we turn to the problems of integration, where we specify four diﬀerent types with increasing
complexity, plane integral, space integral, curve (or line) integral and surface integral.
Finally, we consider vector analysis, where we deal with vector ﬁelds, Gauß’s theorem and Stokes’s
theorem. All these subjects are very important in theoretical Physics.
The structure of this series of books is that each subject is usually (but not always) described by three
successive chapters. In the ﬁrst chapter a brief theoretical theory is given. The next chapter gives
some practical guidelines of how to solve problems connected with the subject under consideration.
Finally, some worked out examples are given, in many cases in several variants, because the standard
solution method is seldom the only way, and it may even be clumsy compared with other possibilities.
I have as far as possible structured the examples according to the following scheme:
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
From high school one is used to immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level, let alone situations in real life, are often so complicated that it in
general will be a good investment also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to
be absolutely certain of what to do in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can
always be executed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. They are not telegram short hands,
and from a logical point of view they usually do not make sense at all! Instead, write in a plain
language what you mean or want to do. This is diﬃcult in the beginning, but after some practice it
becomes routine, and it will give more precise information.
When we deal with multiple integrals, one of the possible pedagogical ways of solving problems has
been to colour variables, integrals and upper and lower bounds in blue, red and green, so the reader
by the colour code can see in each integral what is the variable, and what are the parameters, which

Preface
do not enter the integration under consideration. We shall of course build up a hierarchy of these
colours, so the order of integration will always be deﬁned. As already mentioned above we reserve
the colour black for the theoretical expressions, where we cannot use ordinary calculus, because the
symbols are only shorthand for a concept.
The author has been very grateful to his old friend and colleague, the late Per Wennerberg Karlsson,
for many discussions of how to present these diﬃcult topics on real functions in several variables, and
for his permission to use his textbook as a template of this present series. Nevertheless, the author
has felt it necessary to make quite a few changes compared with the old textbook, because we did not
always agree, and some of the topics could also be explained in another way, and then of course the
results of our discussions have here been put in writing for the ﬁrst time.
The author also adds some calculations in MAPLE, which interact nicely with the theoretic text.
Note, however, that when one applies MAPLE, one is forced ﬁrst to make a geometrical analysis of
the domain of integration, i.e. apply some of the techniques developed in the present books.
The theory and methods of these volumes on “Real Functions in Several Variables” are applied
constantly in higher Mathematics, Mechanics and Engineering Sciences. It is of paramount importance
for the calculations in Probability Theory, where one constantly integrate over some point set in space.
It is my hope that this text, these guidelines and these examples, of which many are treated in more
ways to show that the solutions procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students
who have just started their studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Introduction to volume I,
Point sets in Rn. The maximal domain of a function
In this ﬁrst volume of the series of books on Real Functions in Several Variables we start in Chapter 1
by giving a small theoretical introduction to what is needed in order to get started on the main subject.
We shall work in Euclidean space En, which in rectangular coordinates is similar to the vector space
Rn, also called the coordinate space. The diﬀerence may at the ﬁrst glance seem very small, and yet
this diﬀerence is quite important. If we ever prove something in En, then this is done geometrically
without any coordinate axes. This may be very strange to most younger readers, who have never
learned Geometry in school using only ruler and compasses. For that reason I have in lack of better
words called objects in En for “abstract” or “theoretical”, though they are neither “abstract” nor
“purely theoretical”.
Once we have chosen a rectangular coordinate system in En, i.e. deﬁned the n orthonormal basic
vectors, then we have also deﬁned the rectangular coordinates (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rn of an element x ∈En.
The reason for this transformation from the Euclidean space En to its corresponding coordinate space
Rn is of course that it is often easier to compute things in Rn than to argue geometrically in En.
Obviously, E2 ∼R2 and E3 ∼R3 are very important examples of En ∼Rn, so the main emphasis is
put on these two cases, though we cannot totally rule out higher dimensional spaces.
We introduce the dot product in all Rn and use it to deﬁne the norm (or length) and angle.
In E3 ∼R3 (and only in this space) we also introduce the important cross product or vector product,
which is applied in particular in Physics.
Even if rectangular coordinates may seem natural in the beginning, they are not well suited for all
our problems. When we consider Mechanics in the plane E2, there are clearly two very important
motions, which we should be able to describe in a reasonable way, namely the rectilinear motion,
where rectangular coordinates clearly are most appropriate, and the circular motion, where we in
a rectangular description almost always end up with some nasty square roots. To ease matters we
instead introduce the polar coordinates in the plane. In this case E2 and the corresponding polar
coordinate space ⊂R2 are clearly not of the same geometrical shape. The circular motion is usually
easy to describe in polar coordinates, when the coordinate system is put properly.
Once we have started introducing another coordinate system like the polar coordinates instead of the
usual rectangular coordinate system, we may of course proceed by introducing other useful coordinate
systems, like semi-polar coordinates in R3, which are designed to describe bodies of revolution with
the z-axis as the axis of revolution, and the spherical coordinates in in R3, which are convenient, when
we are dealing with spheres and balls in E3.
All these new coordinate systems are only deﬁned in Chapter 1. However, their applications will be
demonstrated over and over again in the following volumes.
We continue with introducing the most basic of what is called Topology.
We deﬁne the interior,
exterior, boundary and closure of (abstract) sets. We shall also need all these abstract concepts in
the following.
We give some examples of typical sets, which will be used frequently in the following. For the same
reason we also include a section on the classical cones and conical sections from Geometry, because
we cannot assume that all readers have seen them before.

Introduction
We shall start by deﬁning the model number spaces Rn, so they are at hand, when we in the next
section consider the corresponding Euclidean spaces En. There is a bijective correspondence between
En and its coordinate space Rn, when we use the obvious orthonormal basis. The subtle diﬀerence
is that we argue in En in an “abstract way” on the geometry of the set, while we set up some rules
of computation in the coordinate space Rn. In other words, En contains the abstract geometrical
objects, which then are described analytically in the coordinate space Rn. In rectangular coordinates
a point set A ⊆En has the same geometry as its set of coordinates ˜A ⊆Rn, so one may hardly see
the diﬀerence. However, whenever it is convenient to use another coordinate system, which is not
rectangular, e.g. polar or spherical coordinates, then the set of coordinates ˜A ⊆Rn has apparently a
diﬀerent geometry from that of the original set A ⊆En.
Whenever there is a need to distinguish between the “abstract space” of A ⊆En and its coordinate
set ˜A ⊆Rn, we shall use the following colour code: black in the “abstract” space En, and blue,
red, green, etc. in the coordinate space Rn. This is, however, not needed in the ﬁrst volumes, and it
only becomes convenient, when we are describing plane or space integrals, etc., where we calculate
analytically the value of these integrals.
So ﬁrst we deﬁne the model number spaces Rn, and then discuss Rn as a real vector space, followed
by introducing the most commonly used coordinate systems, i.e. rectangular coordinates (in Rn in
general), polar coordinates (only in R2), semi-polar coordinates, also called cylindric coordinates (only
in R3), and ﬁnally the spherical coordinates. These are here only deﬁned in R3, but it is not hard to
prove that generalized spherical coordinates can be deﬁned in any number space Rn, where n ≥3.
In the following sections we turn to point sets in the Euclidean space En. To ease matters for the
reader we shall, as already mentioned above, whenever it is felt convenient, identify a point set A ⊆En
with its coordinate set ˜A ⊆Rn in rectangular coordinates. Note, however, that in principle A and ˜A
are not the same set, although they may look alike!
We introduce some necessary abstract topological concepts like open and closed sets, boundary sets,
convex and starshaped sets, etc.. These may seem very strange for the unexperienced reader, but they
are needed, when we later shall describe limits and continuity of functions.
In the last section of this chapter we describe functions in several variables, and extend them to vector
functions. We also describe how to visualize functions in several variables. Finally, we mention the
problem of implicit given functions. It is not possible here to give a correct proof of the Theorem of
implicit given function, though it clearly is very important.

1.2
The real linear space Rn
The real number space Rn is considered as a real vector space (Rn, +, ·, R), also called a linear space.
The elements of Rn are ordered sets of n real numbers, which are called the coordinates of the point.
Hence, an element of Rn is written
x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rn,
where x1, . . . , xn ∈R.
Although we have not proved it yet, we mention that this is a description of x in rectangular co-
ordinates, so when x ∈Rn is identiﬁed with the corresponding element in the Euclidean space En,
which is also denoted by x, then x is interpreted, depending on the actual situation, either as a point
x ∈En, or as a vector −→x ∈En pointing from 0 = (0, . . . , 0), or −→0 = (0, . . . , 0) to the end point x.
The addition in the vector space Rn is deﬁned by
x + y = (x1, . . . , xn) + (y1, . . . , yn) = (x1 + y1, . . . , xn + yn) ,
so we add the coordinates at place j, j = 1, . . . , n.
The addition is clearly commutative,
x + y = y + x,
for x, y ∈Rn.
The neutral element is the zero point (or zero vector 0, because
x + 0 = (x1, . . . , xn) + (0, . . . , 0) = (x1, . . . , xn) = x.
The scalar multiplication by λ ∈R of x ∈Rn is deﬁned by
λx = λ (x1, . . . , xn) = (λx1, . . . , λxn) ,
so each coordinate is multiplied by the same scalar λ. This can be interpreted as a stretching. We
note that we have no notation for the scalar product. In fact, there is no way to misunderstand the
concatenation λx, and we shall later use the most obvious notation “·” for another important product
in Rn.
A natural basis of Rn is given by the vectors of the coordinates
e1 = (1, 0, · · · , 0), · · · , en = (0, . . . , 0, 1),
where e.g. ej has 1 on its j-th coordinate, while all other coordinates are 0. In fact, it is obvious that
we have
x = (x1, . . . , xn) = x1e1 + · · · + xnxn,
and if
x1e1 + · · · + xnen = 0 = (0, . . . , 0),
then necessarily all xj = 0, so the description of x is unique, and {e1, . . . , en} is indeed a basis of Rn.
One usually adds a so-called inner product in Rn. This is a function denoted by · : Rn × Rn →R. It
is in order to avoid confusion that we do not introduce a notation for the scalar product of a scalar
and a vector.

The inner product of two elements x, y ∈Rn is deﬁned in the following way:

This is actually a geometrical concept, which shall be demonstrated in the following. Note in particular
that
ei · ej := δij =

if i = j,
0
if i = j.
The symbol δij deﬁned above is called the Kronecker symbol. Due to this relation one may say that
the vectors e1, . . . , en are perpendicular to each other.
Since ej · ej = 1, we call the ej unit vectors. They form an orthonormal system.
We call
xj = x · ej
the projection of x onto the line deﬁned by the unit vector ej. It is interpreted as the (signed) length
of the orthogonal projection of x onto the line deﬁned by the unit vector ej.
Using Pythagoras’s theorem repeatedly n −1 times we easily derive that
x := √x · x =

for x ∈Rn,
is the length (also called the norm) of the vector −→x ∼x. Hence, whenever we are given an inner
product – in general satisfying some conditions, which are not given here – then we can talk about the
length of a vector, and even of the angle between two vectors. We shall see below, how this is done.
We mention the following properties of the norm x deﬁned above for x ∈Rn. Let x, y ∈Rn and
λ ∈R be given. Then

4)
|x · y| ≤x y
(Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality)
The proofs of the ﬁrst two claims are straightforward (left to the reader) by using the coordinate
description.
Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality is proved in the following way: Let x, y ∈Rn be given points, and let
λ ∈R be a scalar. Then

which holds for all λ ∈R. This is a real polynomial in λ of second degree, and it is nonnegative for
all λ ∈R. Hence, its discriminant is not positive,
4(x · y)2 −4x2 y2 ≤0,
so by a rearrangement,
|x · y| ≤x y,
and the claim is proved.
We prove below, after we have deﬁned the angle between two vectors, that the equality sign holds if
and only if x and y are proportional, i.e. there exists a λ ∈R, such that either x = λy or y = λx.
(We cannot rule out the possibilities of either x = 0 or y = 0.)

Figure 1.1: The triangle inequality
Remark 1.1 The vectors −→x and −−−→
x + y form a triangle, if we add the vector y from x, cf. Figure 1.1.
The triangle inequality says that the length from 0 to x + y is at most equal to the length of the
broken path from 0 via x to x + y. ♦
Figure 1.2: The angle between two vectors
Let x, y = 0 be two non-zero vectors from Rn (or En). Then they span an ordinary plane, so we can
use the usual geometrical argument of trigonometry in this plane. In fact, we only use Pythagoras’s
theorem and the high school deﬁnition of cosine. In particular, the angle θ ∈[0, π] between x and y
is uniquely determined by the relation
x · y = x y cos θ,
thus
cos θ =
x · y

which deﬁnes θ uniquely in the interval [0, π].
Note in particular that if x, y = 0, and we have equality in Cauchy-Schwarz’s inequality, then
cos θ = ±1, so we have either θ = 0 or θ = π. In either cases x and y are proportional. When x = 0
or y = 0 this statement is of course trivial.
1.3
The vector product
The three-dimensional case R3 has through centuries been thoroughly studied, because it models the
daily space which we live in. It was very early realized by physicists and mathematicians that it would
be quite convenient to introduce yet another product, denoted × : R3 × R3 →R3. It is in rectangular
coordinates deﬁned by
x × y
=
(x1, x2, x3) × (y1, y2, y3)
=
(x2y3 −x3y2, x3y1 −x1y3, x1y2 −y2x1)
(1.1)
and it works only in R3!
If the reader is familiar with how to calculate (3 × 3)-determinants, then (1.1) can also formally be
written in the following way,
(1.2)
x × y =

x1
x2
x3
y1
y2
y3
e1
e2

,
where e1, e2, e3 form an orthonormal basis, and (x1, x2, x3) , (y1, y2, y3) ∈R3 are the coordinates of
x, y, resp., expanded with respect to this basis.
It is easy to remember the structure of this determinant. We put the coordinates of the ﬁrst factor
in the ﬁrst row, the coordinates of the second factor in the second row, and the three basis vectors in
the third row.
By using Linear Algebra we immediately get the following results:
1) When x and y are interchanged, then the ﬁrst two rows in the determinant are interchanged, so
the determinant changes its sign, and we obtain that
y × x = −x × y.
This means that the vector product is anticommutative.
2) It is easy to see that

Since the value of the determinant does not change, when we change the rows cyclically, we
immediately get the following result,
(x × y) · z =

= (y × z) · x = x · (y × z),
which shows that we can interchange the two products if we only keep the order of the vectors
x, y, z. Hence,
(x × y) · z = x · (y × z).
3) By choosing z = x, or z = y it also follows from (1.3) that
(x × y) · x = 0
and
(x × y) · y = 0.
This means that (x × y) is perpendicular to both x and y, and since all vectors lie in R3, the
vector (x × y) is either 0 or normal to the plane spanned by x and y.
4) The products · and × are actually geometrically connected with the “abstract” Euclidean space
E3, which means that they are independent of our speciﬁc choice of orthonormal basis. This means
that we can choose the basis, such that x and y lie in the plane spanned by e1 and e2, which
means that
x = (x1, x2, 0)
and
y = (y1, y2, 0) .
Then we get from (1.1) that
(x × y) = (0, 0, x1y2 −y1x2) =

0, 0,

x1
x2
y1
y2


,
and it is well-known that the absolute value of the third coordinate, |x1y2 −y1x2| is the area of
the parallelogram deﬁned by the vectors x and y.
When we look closer at the sign of x1y2 −y1x2, it follows that when x, y and x × y are all = 0,
then x, y and x × y in this order deﬁnes a right hand system of vectors. This means that if x
is directed along your right thumb, and y along your right foreﬁnger, then x, y must point along
your right middle ﬁnger. This is also a way to ﬁnd out the direction, in which x × y is pointing.
The length of x × y is as noted above equal to the area of the parallelogram, which is spanned by
x and y.
5) When we combine 3) and 4) above it follows that |(x×y)·z| is the volume of the parallelepipedum
spanned by the three vectors x, y and z.
6) Finally, we shall consider the double vector product x × (y × z), which by 3) must be orthogonal
to both x and y × z. It must therefore in particular lie in the plane spanned by y and z, so there
are real constants α and β, such that
x × (y × z) = αy + βz.

This is orthogonal to x, so
0 = x · (αy + βz) = α(x · y) + β(x · z).
This is only possible, if there exists a real constant λ, such that
α = λ(x · z)
and
β = −λ(x · y).
Finally, by insertion,
x × (y × z) = λ{(x · z)y −(x · y)z}.
This shows that x × (y × z) and (x · z)y −(x · y)z are proportional. Then use the coordinates of
x, y and z with respect to the orthonormal basis e1, e2, e3 and prove that λ = 1. (Left to the
reader.) It follows that
x × (y × z) = (x · z)y −(x · y)z.
These results on the vector product in R3 will later be important in our treatment of e.g. integration
in R3.

The most commonly used coordinate systems
When we are given the Euclidean space En and want to describe it by coordinates in Rn, it is obvious
that the coordinate system can be chosen in many ways. We shall always try to choose the coordinate
system in such a way that the calculations become as easy as possible. This is of course a very vague
statement, which does not help the reader, so we here list the most commonly used coordinate systems.
Concerning the choice of which one, the reader should be guided by e.g. the geometry of the domain,
or in case of integration, of the structure of the integrand.
1) The rectangular coordinate system in Rn, n ∈N arbitrarily chosen. This is the most obvious
coordinate system to start with. As already mentioned previously, its basis is given by the vectors
e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , en = (0, . . . , 0, 1),
in general,
ej = (δ1j, δ2j, . . . , δnj) ,
where δij is the Kronecker symbol, deﬁned by
δij =



1
for i = j,
0
for i = j.
The domain in the Euclidean space En is congruent with the corresponding coordinate domain in
Rn, and one hardly notices the diﬀerence.
Figure 1.3: The usual way to draw the rectangular coordinate system in R3.
If x = (x1, . . . , xn) and y = (y1, . . . , yn) with respect to the basis above, then the inner product of
x and y is deﬁned by
x · y = x1y1 + · · · + xnyn =
n

j=1
xjyj.

Basic concepts
In the important special case of R3 we also deﬁne the vector product by
x × y
=
(x1, x2, x3) × (y1, y2, y3)
=
(x2y3 −x3y2, x3y1 −x1y3, x1y2 −y2x1) .
The rectangular system is well designed for linear problems, e.g. rectilinear motions. In the case
of integration, the domain of integration should be limited by straight lines. If this condition is
not satisﬁed, one may by the following reductions end up with almost incalculable integrals.
2) Polar coordinates in the plane. These can only be used in dimension 2.
Figure 1.4: The coordinate system in polar coordinates
Assume that the point P in the Euclidean space E2 has the rectangular coordinates (x, y), cf.
Figure 1.4. The distance ̺ from origo O: (0, 0) to P : (x, y) is by Pythagoras’s theorem given by
̺ =

x2 + y2.
It then follows by high school trigonometry that
x = ̺ cos ϕ
and
y = ̺ sin ϕ,
where ϕ is the angle measured from the X-axis in the positive sense of the plane.
If ̺ = 0, i.e. P = O, so we are at origo, then the angle ϕ is undetermined. Every ϕ ∈R will do in
this case.
If x = 0, then
tan ϕ = y

Note, however, that when ̺ > 0, the angle is only speciﬁed modulo 2π, so we can always add a
multiple of 2π to the angle ϕ without changing x and y.
Summing up, we get the following correspondence between rectangular coordinates
(x, y) ∈R2 \ {(0, 0)} and polar coordinates (̺, ϕ), where ̺ > 0, and ϕ belongs to some half open
interval of length 2π,

Experience shows that students are not too happy with the polar coordinates, when they ﬁrst meet
them. This is probably due to the fact that the angle ϕ is not uniquely determined, in general
only modulo 2π. Nevertheless, they are very useful, and when circular motions are considered,
they are better than rectangular coordinates, so they are very important in e.g. Mechanics. We
shall here illustrate this by the simplest possible example. The unit circle is explicitly described
in polar coordinates by the simple equation
̺ = 1.
This unit circle is implicitly described in rectangular coordinates by

x2 + y2 = 1,
or
x2 + y2 = 1,
so by solving this equation with respect to y we get the more messy explicit expression,
y =



√
1 −x2
for x ∈[−1, 1] ¡nd y ≥0,
−
√
1 −x2
for x ∈[−1, 1] and y ≤0.
Figure 1.5: The unit circle in E2.
When we compare Figure 1.5 and Figure 1.6 it is obvious that although the two sets are in
correspondence, they do not look like each other.
This means that in polar coordinates the
geometry is quite diﬀerent in the Euclidean plane E2 and the coordinate plane R2. Therefore,
they must not be confused!
The polar coordinates are used, whenever we are dealing with circular motion or domains, which
are discs. Also, when the integrand contains expressions which are functions in

x2 + y2 in the
rectangular coordinates, one should rewrite the problem in polar coordinates, because then we
may get rid of at least some of these square roots. The drawback is of course that the angle ϕ
in (1.4) is only speciﬁed modulo 2π, so we must choose an half-open ϕ-interval of length 2π, e.g.
] −π, π]], or ] 0, 2π], or more general, ] α, α + 2π] for some constant α, depending on the geometry
of the domain under consideration.

Figure 1.6: The parameter set in polar coordinates of the unit circle in R2.
We note that the description of the inner product in polar coordinates is not an easy job, and we
shall not derive it.
3) Semi-polar coordinates in E3. These can only be applied in the Euclidean space E3. Also in this
case, the corresponding domain in the coordinate space R3 is distorted compared with the original
set in E3.
Given the usual rectangular basis e1, e2, e3 in En, the idea is to apply the polar coordinates in
the plane spanned by e1 and e2, and keep the rectangular coordinate along the e3-axis.

If (x, y) = (0, 0), then ϕ is determined modulo 2π. On the z-axis, where (x, y) = (0, 0), the angle
ϕ is undetermined, and any ϕ ∈R can be used.
When the angle ϕ is kept ﬁxed, while ̺ ≥0 and z ∈R vary, we describe a half plane, which we call
the meridian half plane. In such a meridian half plane (̺, z) are ordinary rectangular coordinates.
If instead ̺ > 0 is kept ﬁxed, while ϕ and z vary, we describe a cylindric surface with the z-axis as
its axis of rotation. For that reason the semi-polar coordinates are also called cylindric coordinates.
The semi-polar coordinates are typically used, when we are dealing with rotational bodies in E3,
or, if a rectangular coordinate system in R3 e.g. the variables (x, y) only appear in the combined
form

x2 + y2.
4) Spherical coordinates in R3. It was noted above in 3), semi-polar coordinates, that for ﬁxed ϕ we

Figure 1.9: The geometry of the deﬁnition of the spherical coordinates in R3.
We call (r, θ, ϕ) the spherical coordinates in R3. If r > 0 is kept ﬁxed, then (1.5) describes a sphere
of radius r.
If we let r = the radius of the Earth and specify ϕ ∈[−π, π] ∼[−180◦, 180◦], and deﬁne

∼[−90◦, 90◦], then ϕ is the degree of longitude, and ϑ is the degree of
latitude. It is well-known that these two spherical coordinates with success have been applied for
centuries in Geography and Astronomy.
Spherical coordinates are in particular applied, when we are dealing with a sphere, or when the
rectangular coordinates (x, y, z) also appear in the form

x2 + y2 + z2.
If instead θ ∈]0, π[ is kept ﬁxed, then (1.5) describes a cone,, and – as already seen above – when
ϕ is a constant, then (1.5) describes a meridian half plane.
5) It is possible to extend this construction of spherical coordinates to Rn for n > 3. In fact, if
(x, y, z, t) are the rectangular coordinates in R4, then we can start by using the spherical coordinates
above in the variables (x, y, z). When ϕ and θ are kept ﬁxed, we again obtain a meridian half
plane. This time the rectangular coordinates are (r, t). Let (r, t) be a vector in this half plane, and

r = R sin ϑ,
ϑ ∈[0, π] and R =

and we obtain by insertion the rectangular coordinates (x, y, z, t) ∈R4 expressed in the hyper-
spherical coordinates (R, ϕ, θ, ϑ).
Continue this construction to higher dimensions, whenever needed.
Note, however, that this
construction will not be used in this series of books.
Remark 1.2 The author has actually used this construction in an analysis of solid balls in En.
These have an unexpected geometry, when n > 3, and one cannot just conclude that “they behave
as the solid balls in the usual Euclidean space E3”. One example is the following: Choose any
small ε, δ ∈]0, 1[, and let Bn denote the unit ball in Rn of n-dimensional volume |Bn|. Let An
denote the subset of Bn, which is obtained by restricting e.g. the x1-coordinate, so
An :=

(x1, . . . , xn) | x2
1 + · · · + x2
n ≤1 and −ε ≤x1 ≤ε

with its n-dimensional volume denoted by |An|
Then there exists an N ∈N, such that for all n ≥N most of the volume of Bn lies the slab An,
or more precisely,
|An| ≥(1 −δ) |Bn| .

Point sets in space
We shall in this section introduce the most necessary of what mathematicians call Topology. We shall
use the Euclidean space En as our model space, and whenever necessary we shall choose a rectangular
coordinate system and use the equivalent coordinate space Rn. This means that at least in E2 and
E3 it should be possible to visualize the sets. In particular, the sets are easily drawn in the Euclidean
plane E2.
The formal deﬁnition of a set A in the Euclidean space En is given by
A = {x ∈En | p(x)} ,
where p denotes a property, which is satisﬁed for all x ∈A. In plain words this is expressed as “A is
the set of x ∈Rn, for which property p(x) is true”.
If A ⊆En allows some symmetry, it is convenient to introduce the axes, such that these are in harmony
with this symmetry. Such a choice will usually have the eﬀect that the corresponding coordinate set
˜A ⊂Rn becomes simple.
In the Euclidean plane E2 ∼R2 it is easy to draw the most important sets for the applications. This
does not mean that all plane sets can be reasonably drawn. For instance, we have problems in drawing
the set
{(x, y) | x ∈[0, 1] ∩Q, y ∈[0, 1] ∩Q},
which is the set of all points in the square [0, 1]2 of rational coordinates. However, we shall in the
following mostly avoid such pathological sets, so in general they are not at problem.
We shall, whenever necessary or convenient, use the following conventions on drawings in E2 ∼R2:
What is included in a set is marked by
1) a hatching (2-dimensional),
2) a full-drawn line (1-dimensional),
3) a small circle or just a point (0-dimensional).
In particular, a dot-and-dash line is only limiting a hatched set, and the points on such a line do not
belong to the set. Cf. Figure 1.10 to the left.
Note that if a closed curve without double points surrounds a set which together with the curve is
totally included in the set, we do not hatch the set inside the closed curve. Cf. Figure 1.10 to the
right.

where (x1, . . . , xn) and (y1, . . . , yn) ∈Rn are the coordinates of x and y, resp.. Then it is possible to
introduce solid balls in En ∼Rn as the points of distance smaller than (or equal to) a given radius
from a given centre x0.
The open ball B (x0, r) of radius r > 0 and centre x0 ∈En ∼Rn is given by
B (x0, r) := {x ∈En | distn (x, x0) < r} = {x ∈Rn | x −x0 < r} .
The closed ball B [x0, r] of radius r > 0 and centre x0 ∈En ∼Rn is given by
B [x0, r] := {x ∈En | distn (x, x0) ≤r} = {x ∈Rn | x −x0 ≤r} .
In the latter case we may allow r = 0, in which case the closed ball of centre x0 and radius 0 is just
the centre, B [x0, 0] = {x0}. These balls are fundamental in describing more general objects.
1) If x1 ∈A, and there exists an r > 0, such that B (x1, r) ⊆A, then we call x1 an interior point of
A. The set of all interior points of A is called the interior of A, and it is denoted by A◦.
2) If x2 /∈A, and there exists an r > 0, such that B (x2, r) ∩A = ∅, then we call x2 an exterior point
of A. The set of all exterior points of A is called the exterior of A. If ∁A := E2 \ A denotes the
complementary set of A, then the exterior of A is the interior of the complement of A, i.e. the set
(∁A)◦. The point x2 on Figure 1.11 is exterior.
3) The remaining part En \

Figure 1.11: A set A ⊆E2 divides E2 into three sets, 1) the interior S◦of A, 2) the exterior (∁A)◦

A boundary point x ∈∂A is characterized in the following way: For every r > 0, the open ball
B(x, r) contains points from both the interior A◦and the exterior (∁A)◦, i.e.
B(x, r) ∩A◦= ∅
and
B(x, r) ∩(∁A)◦= ∅.
Note that the boundary point x ∈∂A may or may not be a point in A.
The union of the interior and the boundary is called the closure of A. It is denoted by A, hence
A = A◦∪∂A = A ∪∂A.
A set A is called open, if it does not contain any boundary point, i.e. if
A ∩∂A = ∅,
or equivalently,
A = A◦.
Summing up we see that
A is open, if and only if A ∩∂A = ∅,
and
A is closed, if and only if ∂A ⊆A.
A set A is called a neighbourhood of x ∈A, if there exists an r > 0, such that B(x, r) ⊆A. In
particular, when A = A◦is open, then A is a neighbourhood of all its points.
A boundary point P of A is called an isolated point, if there exists an r > 0, such that B(P, r) ∩A =
{P}, i.e. if P is the only point from A in a neighbourhood of P.

Starshaped and convex sets
Concerning the shapes of the sets under consideration the situation is very simple in the 1-dimensional
case of E1, where it usually suﬃces only to consider intervals. However, even in the two-dimensional
case of E2 concerning the shapes of sets, the situation becomes far more complicated, and it is not
always obvious which type of sets we should look at.
Clearly, the n-dimensional intervals
I1 × I2 × · · · × In := {(x1, x2, . . . , xn) | x1 ∈I1, x2 ∈I2, . . . , xn ∈In}
are obvious candidates, where each Ij is of one of the following four types,
Ij = ]aj, bj[ , ]aj, bj) , [aj, bj[ , [aj, bj] .
The balls deﬁned previously are also often used sets.

Figure 1.12: A convex and a starshaped set.
We may, however, also be interested in sets having some weaker geometrical properties.
A set A ⊆En is called starshaped with respect to a point x0 ∈A, if for every x ∈A, the straight
line segment [x0, x] from x0 to x lies totally in A. The set to the right of Figure 1.12 illustrates why
the set is called starshaped. Every line segment from the centre to any other point in A lies in A.
However, if we choose two points from adjacent arms of the star, it is obvious that the line segment
between them is not totally contained in A, so we cannot in general choose the point x0 arbitrarily.
If the line segment between any two points of A also lies in A, then we say that this (clearly) starshaped
set is convex. The set to the left of Figure 1.12 is convex.
Finally, we say that a set A ⊂En is bounded, if there exists an R > 0, such that A ⊆B(0, R), i.e. A
is contained in a ball of ﬁnite radius. Any centre x0 may of course be used here instead.

Catalogue of frequently used point sets in the plane and the space
We shall in this section give a summary of frequently used point sets in E2 ∼R2 and E3 ∼R3.
1) If I, J ⊂R are ordinary one-dimensional intervals, we deﬁne their product set by
I × J :=

(x, y) ∈R2 | x ∈I, y ∈J

.
If J = I, we often write I2 instead of I × I.
If I and J are bounded, then I × J is a rectangle. In particular, I2 is a square, if I is a bounded
interval.
Let I be a bounded interval. Then I × R is called a strip, and I × [a, +∞[ and I× ] −∞, a] are
called half-strips, cf. Figure 1.13.
The set R+×R+ = R2
+ is the open ﬁrst quadrant, and R×R+ is the upper half-plane, cf. Figure 1.14.
We mention the possibilities of the open right half-plane R+ × R, the open left half-plane R−× R
and the open lower half-plane R × R−and variants of these.

2) Let A ⊂R2 be a bounded plane set, and let I ⊆R be an interval. We deﬁne a cylinder in R3 by
A × I :=

(x, y, z) ∈R3 | (x, y) ∈A, z ∈J

cf. Figure 1.15.
When the interval I is bounded, then the length |I| of I is called the height of the cylinder.
If A is a polygon, we also call the cylinder a prism. Special cases are a parallelepipedum, where A
is a rectangle, and a cube,, where A is a square.
3) Assume that the coordinate system has been chosen, such that the coordinate description of the
set A only contains the ﬁrst two coordinates (x, y) in the form x2 + y2. Then A is rotational
symmetric with respect to the z-axis, and the three-dimensional set A can be fully described by

(̺, z) or the polar coordinates (r, θ), as described earlier. Then the point set A can be described as
a body of revolution, which is obtained by revolving the so-called meridian section, cf. Figure 1.16
Figure 1.16: The meridian section to the left is a half disc in the right (̺, z)-half-plane. The body of
revolution is a solid ball
4) A torus is the body of revolution, which is obtained by revolving a disc with respect to a line,
which does not meet the disc. If the coordinate system is placed conveniently with the z-axis as the
axis of revolution, then the disc in the meridian half-plane (i.e. the meridian section) is described
by the inequality
z2 + (̺ −a)2 ≤b2,
where 0 < b < a,
cf. Figure 1.21.

where the term 2C1 x1 y1 has disappeared, because we have obtained that C1 = 0 for some suitable
choice of (q11, q21), which deﬁnes an orthogonal substitution.
We have proved that if we choose a speciﬁc orthogonal substitution, then the general quadratic
equation (1.6) is reduced to
(1.7) A x2 + B y2 + 2Dx + 2Ey + F = 0,
where (A, B) = (0, 0),
and where we for convenience write (x, y) instead of (x1, y1).

This equation is simpliﬁed, when we introduce the new variables

Then the reduced equation becomes

dividing it by K to get

Two straight lines

We shall in the following brieﬂy discuss these possibilities. For simplicity we again write (x, y) instead
of (x1, y1).
The ellipse. The normed equation of the ellipse is given by
(1.8) x2
a2 + y2
b2 = 1,
where a, b > 0.
In the special case where a = b, formula (1.8) describes a circle of centre (0, 0) and radius r = a =.
In general, (1.8) has the two coordinate axes as axes of symmetry. The ellipse cuts the x-axis at
the points A+ : (a, 0) and A−: (−a, 0), and the y-axis at the points B+ : (0.b) and B−: (0, −b).
These four points are called the top point of the ellipse. The numbers a and b (or more correctly
the line segments from O : (0, 0) to A+ : (a, 0), and from O : (0, 0) to B+ : (0, b)) are called the
semi-axes of the ellipse. The larger of a and b is called the major semi-axis, and the smaller of
them is called the minor semi-axis of the ellipse. Let us assume in the following that a > b. Then
we deﬁne the eccentricity e of the ellipse by
e :=

1 −b2
a2 ,
0 < e < 1,
where we formally may add e = 0 in the limiting case b = a, when the ellipse becomes a circle.
The foci of the ellipse (in singular: focus) are when a > b the points
F+ : (ea, 0)
and
F−: (−ea, 0).
If P : (x, y) lies on the ellipse, then a small computation shows that

The coordinate axes are the axes of symmetry. The hyperbola (1.10) intersects the x-axis at the

positive numbers a and b are called the semi-axes of the hyperbola.

Figure 1.25: An hyperbola.
The lines y = ± b
a x are the asymptotes of the hyperbola. They are found by replacing 1 on the
right hand side of (1.10) by 0 and then solving the equation. It is obvious that b is the length of
the line segment perpendicular to the x-axis from A to the asymptote in the ﬁrst quadrant.
The eccentricity e of the hyperbola is deﬁned by

The foci are deﬁned by their coordinates, i.e.
F+ : (ea, 0)

We call the ellipses, the hyperbolas and the parabolas the (non-degenerated) conic sections, because

Quadratic equations in three variables. Conic sectional surfaces.
The general quadratic equation in three variables has the form
(1.15) A x2 + B y2 + C z2 + 2D xy + 2E xz + 2F yz + 2g x + 2H y + 2I z + J = 0,
where A, B, . . . , J ∈R are real constants, and where (A, B, C, D, E, F) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).
As usual, the product terms 2D xy + 2E xz + 2F yz are a nuisance, when (D, E, F) = (0, 0, 0), so the
ﬁrst task is to transform (1.15) into some new variables x1, y1, z1, such that the new coeﬃcients are
all zero, (D1, E1, F1) = (0, 0, 0).

where Q = (q1 q2 q3) ,
with q3 = q1 × q2,
such that

Just ﬁnd the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of A. (Here MAPLE may be used to ease
the computations.)
When we use this coordinate transformation, then (1.16) is reduced to
λ1 x2
1 + λ2 y2
1 + λ3 z2
1 + 2(G H I)Q


x1
y1
z1

+ J = 0.
Then introduce
G1 = (G H I)q1,
H1 = (G H I)q2,
I1 = (G H I)q3,
and the equation is reduced to
(1.17) λ1 x2
1 + λ2 y2
1 + λ3 z2
1 + 2G1 x1 + 2H1 y1 + 2I1 z1 + J = 0.
It follows from the analysis above that it suﬃces to consider the simpler equation
A x2 + B y2 + C z2 + 2G x + 2H y + 2I z + J = 0,
(A, B, C) = (0, 0, 0),
where we again have simpliﬁed the notation.
We shall split the investigation into three cases.
I. First case, A = 0, B = 0 and C = 0.
In this case, (1.17) can be rewritten as
A

x + G

+ B

y + H

= G2
A + H2

C −J.
If we put
x1 = x + G
A,
y1 = y + H
B ,
z1 = z + I
C ,
K = G2
A + H2
B + I2
C −J,
then the equation (1.17) is reduced to the simpler form
A x2
1 + B y2
1 + C z2
1 = K.
Let us ﬁrst assume that K = 0. Then it is customary to norm the equation by dividing it by K,

then (1.18) is reduced to

K = G2

because then (1.18) takes the simpler form
(1.19) A x2

Again we must split into the two cases, K = 0 and K = 0. If K = 0, then we write for short

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

III. The third case. Here we assume that A = 0, while B = C = 0. Then (1.17) is reduced to
(1.20) A x2 + 2G x + 2H y + 2I z + J = 0.
If (H, I) = (0, 0), e.g. I = 0, then (1.20) is reformulated as

Some useful procedures
2.1
Introduction
In this chapter we collect some simple and useful practical procedures, like integration of trigonometric
polynomials, the technique of partial fractions, when MAPLE is not at hand, integration of a quotient
of two polynomials, and how to ﬁnd the domain of a given function. All these will be important in
the following chapter.
2.2
Integration of trigonometric polynomials
Problem 2.1 Calculate the integral

sinm x cosn x dx
for m, n ∈N0.
Notation: By the degree of the product sinm x cosn x we shall understand the sum m + n of the
exponents.
Split the problem into a simpler one: There are two main cases, odd and even degree. Each of
these is again split into two subcases:
1) m + n odd.
a) m even and n odd, i.e. m = 2p and n = 2q + 1, p, q ∈N0,
b) m odd and n even, i.e. m = 2p + 1 and n = 2q, p, q ∈N0.
2) m + n even.
a) m and n are both odd, i.e. m = 2p + 1 and n = 2q + 1, p, q ∈N0,
b) m and n are both even, i.e. m = 2p and n = 2q, p, q ∈N0.
The most diﬃcult case occurs in 2b), where both m and n are even.
Method of solution:
1) a) m = 2p and n = 2p + 1.
Apply the substitution u = sin x corresponding to m = 2p even:

sin2p x cos2q+1 x dx
=

sin2p x · cos2q x · cos x dx
=

sin2p x · (1 −sin2 x)q d sin x
=

u=sin x
u2p(1 −u2)q du,
where the integral is a usual polynomial in u of degree 2p + 2q.

Some useful procedures
b) m = 2p + 1 and n = 2q.
Apply the substitution u = cos x corresponding to n = 2q even:

sin2p+1 x · cos2q x dx
=

sin2p x · cos2q x · sin x dx
=

(1 −cos2 x)p cos2q x · (−1) d cos x
=
−

u=cos x
(1 −u2)pu2q du,
where the integral is a usual polynomial in u og degree 2p + 2q.
2) When the degree m + n is even, the trick is to change the problem to a similar one by doubling
the angle, thereby halving the degree. Therefore, we use the formulæ
cos2 x = 1
2 (1 + cos 2x),
sin2 x = 1
2 (1 −cos 2x),
sin x cos x = 1
2 sin 2x.
a) m = 2p + 1 and n = 2q + 1 are both odd.
The integrand is transformed in the following way:
sin2p+1 x · cos2q+1 x
=
(sin2 x)p · (cos2 x)q · sin x cos x
=
1
2 (1 −cos 2x)
p 1
2 (1 + cos 2x)
q
· 1
2 sin 2x.
Hence we are in a special case of 1b), so by the substitution u = cos 2x we get

sin2p+1 x cos2q+1 x dx
=
1
2p+q+1

(1 −cos 2x)p(1 + cos 2x)q sin 2x dx
=
1
2p+q+1

(1 −cos 2x)p(1 + cos 2x)q ·

−1
2

d cos 2x
=
−
1
2p+q+2

u=cos 2x
(1 −u)p(1 + u)q du.
b) m = 2p and n = 2q are both even.
In this case there is no ﬁnal formula, but there is a procedure by which we can reduce the
problem to a sum of several problems of the types 1a) and 2b) of lower degree. The result is
obtained after a ﬁnite number of steps.
The integrand is rewritten in the following way:
sin2p x cos2q x =
1
2 (1 −cos 2x)
p 1
2 (1 + cos 2x)
q
.
The left hand side is a trigonometrical polynomial of degree 2p + 2q in the angle x. The right
hand side is a trigonometric polynomial of degree p + q in the doubled angle 2x. Each term
of this polynomial must be handled separately, depending on whether the degree j(≤p + q) is
odd (case 1a) or 1b)) or even (case 2b)).
Remark 2.1 It is of course in principle possible to create a speciﬁc solution formula, but it
will be more confusing than the description of the procedure given above. ♦
MAPLE. When m, n ∈N0 are explicitly given as numbers, an application of MAPLE is of course
the easiest method. When either m or n ∈N0 is not speciﬁed, one applies the method above.

Some useful procedures
2.3
Complex decomposition of a fraction of two polynomials
Problem 2.2 Write the quotient P(x)
Q(x) of two polynomials as a sum of elementary fractions.
Remark 2.2 This problem occurs typically in connection with integration, and in courses on series
also in telescopic summation. If the denominator has complex conjugated roots of at least order 2, a
complex decomposition is usually the easiest method. If the order is 1, then real decomposition may
be applied instead. We shall here show the method of complex decomposition. ♦
Procedure.
1) If the degree of the numerator is ≥the degree of the denominator, we ﬁrst perform a division by
the denominator,
P(x)
Q(x) = P1(x) + R(x)
Q(x),
where the residual polynomial R(x) (the new numerator) has a degree smaller than the degree of
Q(x). We save the resulting polynomial P1(x) for the last step.
2) The denominator Q(x) is then factorized into polynomials of degree one (with complex roots):
Q(x) = c · (x −a1)p1 · · · (x −ak)pk.
Check that the sum p1 + · · · + pk of all exponents is equal to the degree of Q(x). If Q(x) is a real
polynomial, check that the complex conjugated roots occur of the same degree.

Some useful procedures
3) To ease matters, choose the simplest one of the two polynomials P(x) and R(x). The following
method gives the same result, whether P(x) or R(x) is used. Since it is here theoretically most
correct to use R(x), we shall use R(x) in the rest of this description, and it is left to the reader to
write P(x) instead of R(x), whenever this will give us simpler calculations.
4) The fraction is rewritten in the following way
R(x)
Q(x) = 1
c ·
R(x)
(x −a1)p1 · · · (x −ak)pk .
We get the coeﬃcient of the special simple fraction
1
(x −a1)p1
by “covering by one’s hand” the factor (x−a1)p1 in the denominator and then putting x = a1 into
the remainder part:
b1,p1 = 1
c ·
R(x)
(x −a2)p2 · · · (x −ak)pk

x=a1
.
Save the result
b1,p1
(x −a1)p1
for the last step in this procedure.
5) Repeat 4) on any other of the factors
(x −a2)p2,
· · ·
(x −ak)pk,
in the denominator and save all the found special fractions.
6) Subtract all the found special fractions from R(x)
Q(x) and reduce:
1
c ·
R(x)
(x −a1)p1 · · · (x −ak)pk −
b1,p1
(x−a1)p1 −· · · −
bk,pk
(x−ak)pk
= 1
d ·
R1(x)
(x −a1)q1 · · · (x −ak)qk.
If the calculations are made without errors, then
q1 < p1,
· · ·
qk < pk.
Check this! (A weak test.)
7) Repeat 4), 5) and 6) on the reduced fraction
1
d ·
R1(x)
(x −a1)q1 · · · (x −ak)qk .
Remember in each step to write down the elementary fractions which have been found. The
process must necessarily stop after a ﬁnite number of steps, because the degree of the denominator
is becoming smaller by each iteration.

Some useful procedures
8) Finally, collect all the found elementary fractions together with the polynomial from 1).
The description above is the standard procedure. My experience has shown me that one often can
ﬁnd shortcuts, which are impossible to systemize here. I shall therefore here only give one example of
many possibilities.
Example 2.1 Let us here try to decompose the fractional function
1
x4 −1.
1) The standard procedure as described above. The denominator has the simple roots 1, i, −1, −i,
hence
1
x4 −1
=
1
(x −1)(x −i)(x + 1)(x + i)
=
1
(1−i)(1+1)(1+i) ·
1
x−1 +
1
(i−1)(i+1)(i+i) ·
1
x−i
+
1
(−1−1)(−1−i)(−1+i) ·
1
x+1 +
1
(−i−1)(−i−i)(−i+1) ·
1
x+i
=

4 ·
1

x+i

=
1
4 ·
1
x−1 −1
4 ·
1
x+1 −1
2 ·
1
x2 + 1.
This is of course fairly tiresome, though it works.
2) Alternatively it is seen that
x4 −1 =

x22 −1 = (x2 + 1)(x2 −1),
so if we write u = x2, and ﬁrst decompose with respect to u followed by a decomposition with
respect to x, we easily get in two simpler steps that
1
x4 −1
=
1
u2 −1 =
1
(u −1)(u + 1) = 1
2
1
u −1 −1

u + 1

Some useful procedures
In the latter two cases we should of course continue with a complex decomposition of
1
x2 + 1. The
simple details are left to the reader.
2.4
Integration of a fraction of two polynomials
Problem 2.3 Calculate
 P(x)
Q(x) dx, where P(x) and Q(x) are (real) polynomials.
Procedure.
1) Decompose P(x)
Q(x) as described in the previous chapter on complex decomposition.
Then P(x)
Q(x) is written as a sum of a polynomial P1(x) and some elementary fractions of the type
c
(x −a)p , i.e. we perform a partial fraction construction.
2) The polynomial P1(x) is integrated in the usual way.
3) The elementary fractions where p > 1 are also integrated in the usual way

c
(x −a)p dx = −
c
p −1 ·
1
(x −a)p−1 ,
no matter whether a is real or complex. If P(x) and Q(x) are real, then any complex fraction of
the type
c
(x −a)p will be accompanied by its complex conjugated fraction
c
(x −a)p . This means
that the integration of such a pair of complex conjugated fractions can be reduced to
 
c
(x −a)p +
c
(x −a)p

p −1 ·
Re{c · (x −a)p−1}
{x2 −2 Re a · x + |a|2}p−1
4) If p = 1, and a is real, then of course

x
x −a dx = c · ln |x −a|.
5) If p = 1, and a is complex, then both
c
x −a and
c
x −a occur in the decomposition. A direct
integration is not possible, unless one is familiar with the theory of Complex Functions. Instead
we add the two elementary fractions before the integration. (Note that when p > 1, this is done
after the integration, cf. 3)).

Point Sets
Example 3.1 Sketch the point set A, the interior A◦, the boundary ∂A and the closure A in each of
the cases below.
Furthermore, examine whether A is open, closed or nothing of that kind.
Finally, check whether A is bounded or unbounded.
1) {(x, y) | xy = 0}.
2) {(x, y) | 0 < x < 1, 1 ≤y ≤3}.
3) {(x, y) | y ≥x2, |x| < 2}.
4) {(x, y) | x2 + y2 −2x + 6y ≤15}.
A Examination of point sets in the plane.
D Each set is analyzed on a ﬁgure.
I 1) The set A = {(x, y) | xy = 0} is the whole plane with the exception of the X and the Y axes. It
is obvious that it is open,
A = A◦.
The boundary ∂A is the union of the X and the Y axes.
The closure is A = A◦∪∂A = R2, i.e. the whole plane.
Finally, A is clearly not bounded.

2) It is easy to sketch the rectangle A = ]0, 1[ ×[1, 3]. We see that
A◦= ]0, 1[ × ]1, 3[.
The boundary of the rectangle is rather complicated to describe formally:
∂A
=
{(x, y) | 0 ≤x ≤1, y = 1} ∪{(x, y) | 0 ≤x ≤1, y = 3}
∪{(x, y) | x = 0, 1 ≤y ≤3} ∪{(x, y) | x = 1, 1 ≤y ≤3} .
This example shows why one shall often prefer a ﬁgure instead of a formally correct mathe-
matical description.

Examples of point sets, conics and conical sections
can be rewritten as
x2 −2x + 1 + y2 + 6y + 9 ≤9 ≤15 + 1 + 9 = 25 = 52,
i.e. put into the form
(x −1)2 + (y + 3)2 ≤25 = 52,
it follows that
A = {(x, y) | (x −1)2 + (y + 3)2 ≤52} = K((1, 3); 5).
This describes a closed disc of centre (1, −3) and radius 5, thus A = A.

∂A = {(x, y) | (x −1)2 + (y + 3)2 = 52},
and A = A is closed and bounded.
Remark. Note that whenever a set like the one under consideration is described by an in-
equality between simple algebraic expressions, one will usually obtain the open set A◦by only
using the inequality signs < or > without equality sign, obtain the closed set by using ≤or ≥
everywhere, and ﬁnally get the boundary by only using equality sign =. This is unfortunately
only a rule of thumb, and one must be aware of that there are exceptions from this rule. ♦

3) The set is the exterior of a parabola. If (x0, y0) ∈A is any point we can always ﬁnd a straight
line through (x0, y0), which cuts the parabola in two diﬀerent points. The points on the line
beyond the most distant intersection point cannot be connected with (x0, y0) by a straight line
inside A, so A is not star shaped seen from any point.
4) This set A is a part of the set in Example 3.6.3, hence it lies in the right half plane.
First note that
y + λ2 = −2λ(x −λ)
is a tangent of the parabola for every λ > 0. This can also be written
y + 2λx = λ2,
λ > 0.
Indirect proof. Assume that A indeed was star shaped from a point (x, y). Then
y + 2λx ≥λ2
for all λ > 0,
which can also be written
y ≥λ(λ −2x)
for all λ > 0.
This is of course not possible for any (x, y) ∈A. In fact, the right hand side of this inequality
tends to +∞for λ →+∞, while y remains constant, and the inequality is violated.
We conclude from this contradiction that A is not star shaped.

I If (x0, y0) ∈B, then K((x0, y0); r), r > 0, i.e. the solid ball of centre (x0, y0) and any positive radius
r, will always contain points (x, y), of which at least one of the coordinates is irrational, hence
K((x0, y0); r) \ B = ∅
for every r > 0.
We conclude from this that B◦= ∅.
Let (x0, y0) ∈[0, 1] × [0, 1] be any point in the bigger set. Then the ball K((x0, y0); r) of centre
(x0, y0) and any radius r > 0 will always contain points from B. This means that (x0, y0) ∈B, i.e.
B ⊇[0, 1] × [0, 1].
It is on the other hand trivial that B ⊆[0, 1] × [0, 1], hence we must have equality,
B = [0, 1] × [0, 1].
Finally, the boundary is found by means of the deﬁnition,
∂B = B \ B◦= [0, 1] × [0, 1] \ ∅= [0, 1] × [0, 1] = B.

A parametric description of the fourth plane is e.g.
(x, y, z)
=
(2, 0, 0) + u{(0, 1, 0) −(2, 0, 0)} + v{(0, 0, 2) −(2, 0, 0)}
=
(2, 0, 0) + u(−2, 1, 0) + v(−2, 0, 2)
=
(2 −2u −2v, u, 2v),
from which y = u and z = 2v.
When we eliminate u and v, we get
x = 2 −2u −2v = 2 −2y −z,
and the equation of the fourth plane is
z = 2 −x −2y.
The points of T must satisfy the inequalities
0 ≤x (≤2),

0 ≤z ≤2 −x −2y.

It follows that B(z) is similar to B above with the factor of similarity 1 −z
2.
2) We see in the same way as in Example 3.9.1 that three of the planes are described by
x = 0,
y = 0
and
z = 2.
A parametric description of the fourth plane is e.g.
(x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) + u(2, 0, 2) + v(0, 1, 2) = (2u, v, 2u + 2v),
from which x = 2u and y = v. When u and v are eliminated we get
z = 2u + 2v = x + 2y,
which is an equation of the fourth plane.
The points of T must satisfy the inequalities
0 ≤x (≤2),

(x, y, z) = (−1, 0, 0) + u(1, 2, 2) + v(1, 0, 4) = (−1 + u + v, 2u, 2u + 4v),
i.e.

y = 2u,
z = 2u + 4v,

u = y

v = 1 + x −u = 1 + x −y

Finally, the points (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 4), (1, 1, 0) lie in the plane of the parametric description
(x, y, z) = u(1, 0, 4) + v(1, 1, 0) = (u + v, v, 4u),
from which
v = y,
u = x −v = x −y
and
z = 4u = 4x −4y.
The points in T must satisfy the inequalities
0 ≤x ≤1,
0 ≤y ≤x,
0 ≤z ≤4x −4y.
In particular, the triangle B is
B = {(x, y) | 0 ≤x ≤1, 0 ≤y ≤x},
and we get
T = {(x, y, z) | 0 ≤x ≤1, 0 ≤y ≤x, 0 ≤z ≤4x −4y}.

Figure 3.34: The domain A in Example 3.10 is that component of the plane, which contains the point
(0, 0).
I It follows from the deﬁnition of A that we have the three restrictions
x + 2y ≤2,
x −y ≤2,
y −x ≤2.
We note that (0, 0) satisﬁes all three inequalities. Thus, the domain A is the closed component
(the intersection of three closed half planes), which contains (0, 0). The boundary ∂A consists of
pieces of the lines
x + 2y = 2,
x −y = 2,
y −x = 2.

Conics and conical sections
Example 3.11 A conic F is given by the equation
2x2 −2y2 + αz2 = 1,
where α is a real constant.
1) Find the values of α, for which F is a surface of revolution. Indicate in each of these cases the
type of the surface and its axis of symmetry.
2) Prove that there is one value of α, for which the surface F is a cylindric surface. Indicate for this
value of α the type of the surface and its axis of symmetry.
A Conic sections.
D Analyze each of the three cases α < 0, α = 0 and α > 0.
I 1) a) When α < 0, the conic is an hyperboloid with two sheets:

Real Functions in Several Variables: Volume-I 
Point sets in Rn

Examples of point sets, conics and conical sections
Example 3.13 Let a, b, c be constant diﬀerent from zero satisfying the equation
a + b + c = 0.
Prove that the plane of the equation
x + y + z = 0
cuts the conic given by
yz
a + zx
b + xy
c = 0
in two straight lines (generators), which form an angle of 2π
3 .
A Intersection of two surfaces.
D Start by e.g. eliminating z = −x −y.
I Clearly, (0, 0, 0) lies in the intersection of the two surfaces. Furthermore, if two of the variables are
0, e.g. x = y = 0, then we have a point on the conic, no matter the value of the third variable
(here z). We conclude that the X, the Y and the Z axes all lie on the conic section. Of course,
none of then are contained in the oblique plane x + y + z = 0.
If we keep oﬀthe coordinate planes, i.e. we assume in the following that xyz = 0, then the equation
of the conic can also be written
0 = yz
a + zx
b + xy
x = xyz

i.e.

When we put everything here into the same fraction and reduce we get
(3.1) 0 = 1
a (x + y)y + 1
b (x + y)x −1
c xy,
which is an homogeneous polynomial of second degree in (x, y).
Now x = 0, if and only if y = 0, so the solutions must have the structure
(3.2) y = α x,
α = 0.
It follows that the intersection of the two surfaces must have the structure
r(t) = (t, αt, −(1 + α)t) = t(1, α, −(1 + α)),
t ∈R,

because z = −x −y, and because we can trivially continue to (0, 0, 0).
When (3.2) is put into (3.1), we get that α is a solution of a polynomial of second degree with the
roots α1 and α2, corresponding to two straight lines. (According to the geometry the solutions
exist, so we must necessarily have the the roots α1 and α2 are real numbers).

We obtain surfaces of revolution when

2) x2 + k(2 −k)z2 = x2 + z2, i.e. when k = 1.
3) 4 −k2 = k(2 −k), i.e. k = 2, which however produces degenerated surfaces of revolution.
4) k = 0 gives Z axis as the degenerated “surface of revolution”.
1) When k = −

3 we are in case 3., so we have an hyperboloid of revolution with two sheets where
the Z axis is the axis of revolution.
2) When k = 0 we are in case 4., which is the degenerated case of the Z axis. The Z axis is clearly
the axis of revolution.
3) When k = 1 we are in case 5., and we get an ellipsoid of revolution with the Y axis as the axis
of revolution.
4) When k =
√
3 we are again in case 5., so we get an ellipsoid of revolution with the Z axis as
the axis of revolution.
5) When k = 2 we are in the degenerated case 6. The two planes have clearly the X axis as the
axis of revolution.

Formulæ
Some of the following formulæ can be assumed to be known from high school. It is highly recommended
that one learns most of these formulæ in this appendix by heart.
4.1
Squares etc.
The following simple formulæ occur very frequently in the most diﬀerent situations.
(a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab,
a2 + b2 + 2ab = (a + b)2,
(a −b)2 = a2 + b2 −2ab,
a2 + b2 −2ab = (a −b)2,
(a + b)(a −b) = a2 −b2,
a2 −b2 = (a + b)(a −b),
(a + b)2 = (a −b)2 + 4ab,
(a −b)2 = (a + b)2 −4ab.
4.2
Powers etc.
Logarithm:

(extensions for some r).
Exponential, ﬁxed base:

(ax)y = axy, a > 0
(extensions for some x, y),
a−x = 1
ax , a > 0,
(extensions for some x),
n√a = a1/n, a ≥0,
n ∈N.

Remark 4.1 It happens quite frequently that students make errors when they try to apply these
rules. They must be mastered! In particular, as one of my friends once put it: “If you can master the
square root, you can master everything in mathematics!” Notice that this innocent looking square
root is one of the most diﬃcult operations in Calculus. Do not forget the absolute value! ♦

Diﬀerentiation
Here are given the well-known rules of diﬀerentiation together with some rearrangements which some-
times may be easier to use:
{f(x) ± g(x)}′ = f ′(x) ± g′(x),
{f(x)g(x)}′ = f ′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x) = f(x)g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the latter rearrangement presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0.
If g(x) = 0, we get the usual formula known from high school
f(x)
g(x)
′
= f ′(x)g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
.
It is often more convenient to compute this expression in the following way:
f(x)
g(x)

= d
dx

f(x) ·
1
g(x)

= f ′(x)
g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
= f(x)
g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the former expression often is much easier to use in practice than the usual formula from high
school, and where the latter expression again presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0. Under these
assumptions we see that the formulæ above can be written
{f(x)g(x)}′
f(x)g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x) ,
{f(x)/g(x)}′
f(x)/g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x) .
Since
d
dx ln |f(x)| = f ′(x)
f(x) ,
f(x) = 0,
we also name these the logarithmic derivatives.
Finally, we mention the rule of diﬀerentiation of a composite function
{f(ϕ(x))}′ = f ′(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x).
We ﬁrst diﬀerentiate the function itself; then the insides. This rule is a 1-dimensional version of the
so-called Chain rule.

Integration
The most obvious rules are dealing with linearity

{f(x) + λg(x)} dx =

f(x) dx + λ

g(x) dx,
where λ ∈R is a constant,
and with the fact that diﬀerentiation and integration are “inverses to each other”, i.e. modulo some
arbitrary constant c ∈R, which often tacitly is missing,

f ′(x) dx = f(x).
If we in the latter formula replace f(x) by the product f(x)g(x), we get by reading from the right to
the left and then diﬀerentiating the product,
f(x)g(x) =

{f(x)g(x)}′ dx =

f ′(x)g(x) dx +

f(x)g′(x) dx.
Hence, by a rearrangement
The rule of partial integration:

f ′(x)g(x) dx = f(x)g(x) −

f(x)g′(x) dx.
The diﬀerentiation is moved from one factor of the integrand to the other one by changing the sign
and adding the term f(x)g(x).
Remark 4.3 This technique was earlier used a lot, but is almost forgotten these days.
It must
be revived, because MAPLE and pocket calculators apparently do not know it.
It is possible to
construct examples where these devices cannot give the exact solution, unless you ﬁrst perform a
partial integration yourself. ♦
Remark 4.4 This method can also be used when we estimate integrals which cannot be directly
calculated, because the antiderivative is not contained in e.g. the catalogue of MAPLE. The idea is
by a succession of partial integrations to make the new integrand smaller. ♦
Integration by substitution:
If the integrand has the special structure f(ϕ(x))·ϕ′(x), then one can change the variable to y = ϕ(x):

f(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x) dx = “

f(ϕ(x)) dϕ(x)′′ =

y=ϕ(x)
f(y) dy.

Formulæ
Integration by a monotonous substitution:
If ϕ(y) is a monotonous function, which maps the y-interval one-to-one onto the x-interval, then

f(x) dx =

y=ϕ−1(x)
f(ϕ(y))ϕ′(y) dy.
Remark 4.5 This rule is usually used when we have some “ugly” term in the integrand f(x). The
idea is to put this ugly term equal to y = ϕ−1(x). When e.g. x occurs in f(x) in the form √x, we put
y = ϕ−1(x) = √x, hence x = ϕ(y) = y2 and ϕ′(y) = 2y. ♦

Trigonometric formulæ
The trigonometric formulæ are closely connected with circular movements. Thus (cos u, sin u) are
the coordinates of a point P on the unit circle corresponding to the angle u, cf. ﬁgure A.1. This
geometrical interpretation is used from time to time.

Figure 4.1: The unit circle and the trigonometric functions.
The fundamental trigonometric relation:
cos2 u + sin2 u = 1,
for u ∈R.
Using the previous geometric interpretation this means according to Pythagoras’s theorem, that the
point P with the coordinates (cos u, sin u) always has distance 1 from the origo (0, 0), i.e. it is lying
on the boundary of the circle of centre (0, 0) and radius
√
1 = 1.
Connection to the complex exponential function:
The complex exponential is for imaginary arguments deﬁned by
exp(i u) := cos u + i sin u.
It can be checked that the usual functional equation for exp is still valid for complex arguments. In
other word: The deﬁnition above is extremely conveniently chosen.
By using the deﬁnition for exp(i u) and exp(−i u) it is easily seen that
cos u = 1
2(exp(i u) + exp(−i u)),
sin u = 1
2i(exp(i u) −exp(−i u)),

Formulæ
Moivre’s formula: We get by expressing exp(inu) in two diﬀerent ways:
exp(inu) = cos nu + i sin nu = (cos u + i sin u)n.
Example 4.1 If we e.g. put n = 3 into Moivre’s formula, we obtain the following typical application,
cos(3u) + i sin(3u) = (cos u + i sin u)3
= cos3 u + 3i cos2 u · sin u + 3i2 cosu · sin2 u + i3 sin3 u
= {cos3 u −3 cosu · sin2 u} + i{3 cos2 u · sin u −sin3 u}
= {4 cos3 u −3 cosu} + i{3 sinu −4 sin3 u}
When this is split into the real- and imaginary parts we obtain
cos 3u = 4 cos3 u −3 cosu,
sin 3u = 3 sin u −4 sin3 u.
♦
Addition formulæ:
sin(u + v) = sin u cos v + cos u sin v,
sin(u −v) = sin u cos v −cos u sin v,

Hyperbolic formulæ
These are very much like the trigonometric formulæ, and if one knows a little of Complex Function
Theory it is realized that they are actually identical. The structure of this section is therefore the same
as for the trigonometric formulæ. The reader should compare the two sections concerning similarities
and diﬀerences.
The fundamental relation:
cosh2 x −sinh2 x = 1.
Deﬁnitions:
cosh x = 1
2 (exp(x) + exp(−x)) ,
sinh x = 1
2 (exp(x) −exp(−x)) .
“Moivre’s formula”:
exp(x) = cosh x + sinh x.
This is trivial and only rarely used. It has been included to show the analogy.
Addition formulæ:
sinh(x + y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) + cosh(x) sinh(y),
sinh(x −y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) −cosh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x + y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) + sinh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x −y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) −sinh(x) sinh(y).
Formulæ of halving and doubling the argument:

Magnitudes of functions
We often have to compare functions for x →0+, or for x →∞. The simplest type of functions are
therefore arranged in an hierarchy:
1) logarithms,
2) power functions,
3) exponential functions,
4) faculty functions.
When x →∞, a function from a higher class will always dominate a function form a lower class. More
precisely:
A) A power function dominates a logarithm for x →∞:
(ln x)β
xα
→0
for x →∞,
α, β > 0.
B) An exponential dominates a power function for x →∞:
xα
ax →0
for x →∞,
α, a > 1.
C) The faculty function dominates an exponential for n →∞:
an
n! →0,
n →∞,
n ∈N,
a > 0.
D) When x →0+ we also have that a power function dominates the logarithm:
xα ln x →0−,
for x →0+,
α > 0.
