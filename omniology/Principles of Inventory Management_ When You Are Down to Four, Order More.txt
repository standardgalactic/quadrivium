Preface
The importance of managing inventories properly in global supply chains cannot be
denied. Each component of these numerous supply chains must function appropriately
so that inventories are managed efﬁciently. To manage efﬁciently requires the leaders
and staffs in each organization to comprehend certain basic principles and laws. The
purpose of this book is to discuss these principles.
The contents of this text represent a collection of lecture notes that have been created
over the past 33 years at Cornell University. As such, the topics discussed, the sequence
in which they are presented, and the level of mathematical sophistication required to
understand the contents of this text are based on my interests and the backgrounds of
my students. Clearly, not all topics found in the vast literature on quantitative methods
used to model and solve inventory management problems can be covered in a one-
semester course. Consequently, this book is limited in scope and depth.
The contents of the book are organized in a manner that I have found to be effective
in teaching the subject matter. After an introductory chapter in which the fundamental
issues pertaining to the management of inventories are discussed, we introduce a vari-
ety of models and algorithms. Each such model is developed on the basis of a set of
assumptions about the manner in which an operating environment functions.
In Chapter 2 we study the classic economic order quantity problem. This type of
problem is based on the assumption that demands occur at a constant, continuous, and
known rate over an inﬁnite planning horizon. Furthermore, the cost structure remains
constant over this inﬁnite horizon as well. The focus is on managing inventories at a
single location.
The material in Chapter 3 extends the topic covered in Chapter 2. Several multi-
location or multi-item models are analyzed. These analyses are based on what are called
power-of-two policies. Again, the underlying operating environments are assured to be
deterministic and unchanging over an inﬁnite horizon.

Preface
The assumptions made about the operating environment are altered in Chapter 4.
Here the planning horizon is ﬁnite in length and divided into periods. Demands and
costs are assumed to be known in each period, although they may change from period
to period.
In all subsequent chapters, uncertainty is present in the operating environment. In
Chapter 5 we study single-period problems in which customer demand is assumed to
be described by a random variable. In Chapter 6, the analysis is extended to multiple
periods. The discussion largely focuses on establishing properties of optimal policies in
ﬁnite-horizon settings when demand is described by a non-stationary process through
time. Serial systems are also discussed. The objective is to minimize the expected costs
of holding inventories and stocking out. Thus, the cost structure in this chapter is limited
to the case where there are no ﬁxed ordering costs.
In Chapter 7, we study environments in which demands can occur at any point in
time over an inﬁnite planning horizon. Whereas we assumed in Chapter 6 that inven-
tory procurement decisions were made periodically, in this chapter we assume such
decisions are made continuously in time. The underlying stochastic processes govern-
ing the demand processes are stationary over the inﬁnite planning horizon, as are the
costs. As in Chapter 6, we assume there are no ﬁxed ordering costs.
The analysis in Chapter 7 is conﬁned to managing items in a single location. In
Chapter 8 we extend the analysis to multi-echelon systems. Thus the underlying sys-
tem is one in which inventory decisions are made continuously through time, but now
in multiple locations. The importance of understanding the interactions of inventory
policies between echelons is the main topic of this chapter.
Chapters 9 and 10 contain extensions of the materials in Chapters 7 and 6, respec-
tively. In both chapters, we introduce the impact that ﬁxed ordering costs have on the
form of optimal operating policies as well as on the methods used to model and solve
the resulting optimization problems. Both exact and approximate models are presented
along with appropriate algorithms and heuristics. A proof of the optimality of so-called
(s,S) policies is given, too.
As mentioned, the materials contained in this text are ones that have been taught to
Cornell students. These students are seniors and ﬁrst year graduate students. As such,
they have studied optimization methods, probability theory (non-measure-theoretic)
and stochastic processes in undergraduate level courses prior to taking the inventory
management course. In addition to presenting fundamental principles to them, the in-
tent of the course is also to demonstrate the application of the topics they have studied
previously.
The text is written so that sections can be read mostly independently. To make this
possible, notation is presented in each major section of each chapter. The text could be
used in different ways. For example, a half semester course could consist of material
in Chapter 2, Section 4.1, Sections 5.1–5.2, Sections 6.2–6.3, most of Sections 9.1–

Preface
ix
9.2, Sections 10.1–10.2, and Section 10.5. While we have chosen to examine stochastic
lot sizing problems at the end of the text, these materials could easily be studied in
a different sequence. For example, Chapter 9 could be studied after Chapter 3, and
Chapter 10 could be studied after Chapter 6. Rearranging the sequence in which the
text can be read is possible because of the way it has been written.
I have mentioned that the scope of this text is limited. I encourage readers to study
other texts to complete their understanding of the basic principles underlying the topic
of inventory management. These texts include those authored by Sven Axs¨ater; Ed
Silver and Rein Peterson; Steve Nahmias; Craig Sherbrooke; Paul Zipkin; and Evan
Porteus. Each of these authors has made exceptional contributions to the science and
practice of inventory management.

Acknowledgments
I began my study of inventories while a student at the University of Michigan. My
teachers there, Richard C. Wilson and Herbert P. Galliher, taught me the basics of the
subject. These two were great teachers and engineers. They prodded and encouraged
me during and after my student years. I am deeply indebted to them.
As is often the case in a person’s life, an event occurred that altered every profes-
sional activity I have undertaken thereafter. This event occurred for me in the early
1970s when I was asked to develop an approach for computing procurement quanti-
ties for engines and other repairable items for the U.S. Air Force’s F-15 aircraft. At
that time I was an active duty Air Force Ofﬁcer. Suddenly, I had to truly learn and
then apply the principles of inventory theory. The people with whom I worked on this
project were capable, dedicated, and truly of great character. At the Air Force Logistics
Command Headquarters, where I worked, these people included Major General George
Rhodes, Colonel Fred Gluck, Major Gene Perkins, Captain Jon Reynolds, Captain Mike
Pearson, MSgt Robert Kinsey, Tom Harruff, Vic Presutti, and Perry Stewart. I learned
much from my friends and colleagues at the RAND Corporation: Irv Cohen, Gordon
Crawford, Steve Drezner, Murray Geisler, Jack Abel, Mort Berman, Lou Miller, Bob
Paulson, Hy Shulman, and John Lu. I also beneﬁted greatly from research conducted
at RAND by Craig Sherbrooke. Many of the ideas presented in Chapter 8 are directly
related to his efforts. Also, I had the distinct privilege of learning about the practice of
inventory management from Bernie Rosenman, who headed the Army Inventory Re-
search Ofﬁce, and his colleagues Karl Kruse and Alan Kaplan.
Since 1974 I have been on the faculty at Cornell and have had the opportunity to
work with some of the ﬁnest scholars in the ﬁeld of operations research. Peter Jack-
son, Bill Maxwell, Paat Rusmevichientong, and Robin Roundy all have greatly inﬂu-
enced my thinking about the principles of inventory management. I have been fortu-
nate to have taught and worked with many gifted students. Almost 1,000 students have

been taught inventory management principles at Cornell since 1974. I am especially
indebted to many former Ph.D. students, who, without exception, have been wonder-
ful people and a great joy to work with. They include Kripa Shanker, Peter Knepell,
Mike Isaac, Jim Rappold, Kathryn Caggiano, Andy Loerch, Bob Sheldon, Ed Chan,
Alan Bowman, David Murray, Jong Chow, Eleftherios Iacovou, Susan Alten, Chuck
Sox, Howard Singer, Sophia Wang, Juan Pereira, and, most recently, Retsef Levi, Tim
Huh, and Ganesh Janakiraman. Major sections of Chapter 10 are due to these latter
three. Thanks also to Tim Huh, Retsef Levi, Ganesh Janakiraman, and Joseph Geunes
for their early adoption of the book and helpful feedback.
Amar Sapra, my co-author and former Cornell student, urged me for many years to
write this book. Without his encouragement and substantial assistance, the book would
not have been completed.
I cannot express with mere words how thankful I am to all of these truly exceptional
people.
I also appreciate the heroic efforts of June Meyermann, who had to decipher my
handwriting as she typed the manuscript. She is a jewel. Kathleen King and Paat Rus-
mevichientong have provided substantial support in the preparation of this book, as
well.
Lastly, and most importantly, my wife Linda has been very supportive of the time
I have spent working on the text. The many hours that I have not been available for
activities with her are too numerous to count. I deeply appreciate her constant love and
support.

Inventories Are Everywhere
This morning I began the day by pouring a glass of orange juice from a half gallon
container, ﬁlling a bowl with cereal, which was stored in a large box in a kitchen cabinet,
taking a banana from a bunch sitting on our kitchen countertop along with many other
items, slicing the banana onto the cereal, pouring milk into the bowl from a gallon
container, and then sitting at a table to enjoy my breakfast. There are six chairs at
my breakfast table, but, of course, I occupy only one. When taking the cereal from
the cabinet, I had to choose from six different cereals we have stocked. I could have
selected either low or high pulp content orange juice, since we stock both types; I could

used at a future time. My Jaguar convertible will not be used today. It is raining, so I
will take the Dodge minivan to the ofﬁce.
All of the items I have mentioned are examples of inventories that we have around
us that support our daily living. But why do we have these inventories? Is it simply
convenience or are there economic factors at play as well?
Inventories are obviously prevalent in the commercial world. Retail stores are
stocked with an abundance of material. Manufacturing facilities are also ﬁlled with
inventories of raw materials, work in process, and perhaps ﬁnished goods. But they are
also stocked with inventories of equipment, machines, spare parts, and people, among
other things. Governments stockpile material, too, including items to be used in emer-
will used to keep roads clear in the winter, and military equipment and material, to men-
smooth execution of commerce in the U.S. economy. Regional blood banks stock large

these and many more types of inventories are evident throughout the world. But again
why are these inventories created and maintained at particular levels?
In general, inventories exist because there is an imbalance between the supply of an
item at a location and its consumption or sale there. The imbalances are the consequence
of many technical, economic, social, and natural forces. Note that inventories are a
consequence and not a cause of some policy or action. Hence inventories become a
dependent rather than an independent variable.
If I choose to go to the grocery store once or twice a week (this is my policy), then
I must carry inventory of food sufﬁcient to satisfy my needs until the next trip to the
store. If a manufacturing plant contains equipment that is designed to make components
efﬁciently when operating, but is engineered in a way that requires a lengthy setup time
between production runs of different component types, then an economic production
run of a particular component type will yield a large number of units, and the produc-
tion runs will occur infrequently. Inventories are therefore created in each run to meet
delivery requirements between successive production runs. These examples illustrate
that policy and technology together dictate that inventories must exist.
1.1 The Roles of Inventory
We all recognize the necessity of carrying inventories to sustain operations within an
economy. One role of management is to determine policies that create and distribute
inventories most effectively. As we have mentioned, there are many forces that affect
the choice of a policy that managements might select. These policies, to a major extent,
reﬂect the environment in which a company operates. The environmental factors, in
turn, result in the roles inventories play in a corporation’s or supply chain’s strategy.
Let us consider one way to think about deﬁning types of inventories and the roles
they play. While there are other ways to categorize inventories, we think of them as
being one of the following types: anticipation stock, cycle stock, safety stock, pipeline
stock, and decoupling stock. We will discuss each type.
Anticipation stocks are created by a ﬁrm not to meet immediate needs, but to meet
requirements in the more distant future. In a manufacturing setting, for example, im-
mediate needs could be current orders that must be fulﬁlled or those expected to be
demanded within a manufacturing lead time. In businesses with seasonal demands (say
snow shovels), production may occur throughout the year to build up inventories that
will be depleted in a few weeks or months. The buildup occurs because production ca-
pacity is incapable of meeting the demand at the time it occurs. Thus the decision to
limit production capacity results in creating inventories in anticipation of demand.

1.1
The Roles of Inventory
3
In some instances, anticipation stocks are created owing to speculation. If raw ma-
terial prices are expected to increase, then it may be advantageous to purchase large
quantities of them at a point in time in anticipation of the need for their use at a much
later point in time.
Agricultural output is dictated by the growing seasons for crops in a particular loca-
tion. Hence production occurs in anticipation of future demand and market prices. The
harvested crops may not be consumed for several years.
These examples illustrate that inventories may be created because of capacity limi-
tations, speculative motives, or seasonal cycles. These are all examples of anticipation
stocks.
A second role of inventory is to meet current demand from stock which was created
earlier because of the cyclic nature of the incoming supply of inventory. Suppose that a
product is ordered from a supplier each month. Then the amount received each month
must be adequate to meet demands throughout the ensuing month. Assume that demand
occurs at a constant, continuous rate throughout the month. The left portion of the graph
in Figure 1.1 illustrates the effect of receiving material at the beginning of the month, or
more generally a cycle, and the constant rate at which the inventory level decreases as
a consequence of the constant, continuous nature of the demand process. The average
inventory carried in stock
due to the cycle length, one
month in our example, is
equal to the average time a
unit remains in stock times
the demand rate. Since in-
ventory is depleted at a con-
stant rate, the average time
a unit of stock remains on
hand is one half the cycle
length. If the cycle length is
altered, the average amount
of cycle stock changes in
a proportional manner. Re-
ducing cycle lengths reduces
cycle stock levels. Replen-
ishment of inventories is not

instantaneous in most instances. The length of time between the placement of an order
on a supplier and its receipt is called a lead time. To ensure that adequate stock is on
hand, an order is placed to replenish stocks when the inventory level reaches a particular
value, which is called the reorder point. The inventory graph in the right-hand portion
of Figure 1.1 illustrates possible demand patterns that reduce on-hand stock during a

lead time when demand during the lead time is uncertain. Thus total demand may be
greater than, less than, or about the same as predicted for this period. Furthermore, as
illustrated in Figure 1.1, the lead time is also subject to variation. To protect against
uncertain demand over an uncertain lead time, another type of stock is created called
safety stock, or demand-driven safety stock.
As we will show later in the book, safety stocks may be necessary because pro-
ductive capacity of a supplier is limited. When such a capacity limitation on supply
exists, lead times are not ﬁxed and hence more inventory may be required to ensure
customer service is maintained. When capacity limitations exist, these inventories are
called capacity-driven safety stocks.
There is a complex relationship that exists between cycle and safety stocks, which
will be discussed in detail in subsequent chapters. The goal of many companies is to
keep reducing cycle lengths, thereby reducing cycle stocks. But doing so also increases
the number of cycles per year and correspondingly the number of times the company
is exposed to the possibility for a stockout to occur. The need to maintain service to
customers may thus force the company to increase safety stock levels.
The fourth type of stock that exists in a system is called pipeline stock. This stock
exists because of the length of time it takes from the issuing of an order for stock
replenishment until it is ready for issue or sale at the receiving location. This time is the
replenishment lead time. Pipeline stock is equal to the expected demand over the lead
time, which is equal to the expected demand per day times the length of the lead time,
measured in days. This is a consequence of the well-known law called Little’s law.
Again observe that pipeline stock is proportional to the lead time length, so doubling
the average lead time doubles the pipeline stock.
Decoupling stock is another type of safety stock. In manufacturing settings, there
are successive operations in a plant corresponding to the production of products. Each
operation corresponds to the physical transformation of material, basic processing of
material, assembly of components, or possibly testing of the product at various produc-
tion stages. For example, assembling of an automotive engine is normally accomplished
through a sequence of tasks. Each task corresponds to adding components to the par-
tially assembled engine. The tasks are performed at work stations. In order to keep
the assembly process operating smoothly, inventories are introduced between succes-
sive stations. These inventories protect against variation in processing times or machine
breakdowns at a station, and are called decoupling stocks. They are given this name be-
cause the presence of these stocks essentially permits each station to operate indepen-
dently of all others. There will be stock available to work on when a task is completed,
and there will be a place to temporarily store the output of the task performed at each
station. Each station is neither starved for material to work on nor blocked from sending
its output to the next station. Hence all operations are essentially decoupled from one
another.

1.2
Fundamental Questions
5
Multi-echelon inventory systems operate smoothly when a request from a supplying
location can be satisﬁed with minimal or no delay. To ensure that this smooth ﬂow
exists between echelons, safety or decoupling stocks are often created.
While inventories play different roles and are created for different purposes, the
question remains as to how much inventory of each type should exist.
1.2 Fundamental Questions
There are four fundamental questions that must be answered pertaining to inventories.
The ﬁrst is: what items should be stocked in a system? The answer depends on the
objectives of a business and the strategy employed to achieve the objectives. Walmart
and Amazon.com are both retail companies, but they differ in fundamental ways. One
way they are different is in the range of stock they offer. Walmart stores may stock
many tens of thousands of item types. You can order any one of over 40 million item
types from Amazon.com. Thus the breadth of the product offering is a key decision that
must be made by a company.
The second question is: where should the item be stocked? Should all stores in a
retail chain stock the same item types? Amazon.com does not have retail stores. It sup-
plies its customers from its own as well as supplier warehouses. What items should be
stocked in each warehouse? Should all items be stocked everywhere, or should certain
items be stocked in only a single location?
Xerox maintains a large inventory of service parts. There are many hundreds of
thousands of different part types that are stocked in their multi-echelon resupply system.
There are also many thousands of technicians who repair Xerox machines. What part
types should they carry in the trunks of their vehicles or in an inventory locker? How
should these technicians be resupplied? Where in this complex resupply system should
each part be stocked?
The third question is: how much should be ordered when an order is placed? As
we will see, the answer to this question will depend on a large number of factors that
we will discuss in the next section. These factors will also determine the answer to the
fourth question, which is “when should an order be placed?”
The material presented in this book focuses almost entirely on answering the third
and fourth questions. The second question is addressed indirectly when we examine
multi-echelon systems. To answer these questions we will construct a variety of math-
ematical models, each built on a different set of assumptions concerning the way the
system being studied operates. Thus our goal in this book is to show how to represent
a broad range of problem environments mathematically and to show how to answer the
third and fourth questions for each such environment.

1.3 Factors Affecting Inventory Policy Decisions
When constructing mathematical models that address the questions raised in the previ-
ous section, we must consider several key factors. Models, by their nature, are repre-
sentations or abstractions of real operating environments. Hence all the factors affecting
inventory policy decisions are not always captured or represented in a model. We will
examine many models in this text, and each differs in the manner in which the individ-
ual factors are expressed mathematically. Before we begin exploring these mathemati-
cal models, let us discuss these underlying factors that affect inventory policy decision
making.
1.3.1 System Structure
The ﬁrst factor is the supply chain’s structure. The structure indicates the manner in
which both material and information ﬂow in a supply chain system. This system may
consist of many stages or echelons. If the environment being represented is a service
parts system for a high tech company, the system structure will likely look like the one

found in Figure 1.2. In such
a system, a central ware-
house may stock a broad
range of item types received
from a variety of manufac-
turing sources. These items

a set of locations, which we are calling branches. There may be 75 or more such
branches in the United States. Service technicians receive stock needed to repair equip-
ment, found in customer locations, from these branches. In many cases, there are thou-
sands of technicians servicing customer locations.

1.3
Factors Affecting Inventory Policy Decisions
7
The central warehouse, regional warehouses, branches, and technician levels in the
diagram each represent an echelon in the system in our service parts system example.
How material ﬂows and how information ﬂows depends on this echelon structure.
The echelon structures found in complex supply chains are more complicated than
the one we portrayed in our example. In an automotive supply chain there are echelons
corresponding to raw material suppliers, component suppliers, manufacturing plants,
vehicle assembly plants, and car dealers. The suppliers of raw materials and compo-
nents will likely deliver material to more than one car company and to multiple loca-
tions for a given car company.
In this automotive example, and in most retail situations, the various echelons in the
supply chain are owned by different economic entities. This fact makes management
of inventories within a supply chain much more difﬁcult. Inventory policies as well
as information ﬂows need to be coordinated throughout a supply chain, that is, across
echelons, to ensure timely and cost-effective delivery of inventories. Coordination of
policies, even when the echelons are part of the same company, is often lacking. Poor
coordination negatively affects a supply chain’s performance.
Since supply chains are increasingly becoming global, their echelon structures are
sometimes affected by governmental requirements for local content, tax policies, labor
rules, cost, etc. Thus a supply chain’s structural complexity is in part the result of na-
tional and regional policies. Such policies play a major role in the echelon structure of
ﬁrms with businesses in the European Union, for example.
1.3.2 The Items
A second factor to be considered is the nature of the items being stocked in the supply
chain and at a particular location. The number of items being stocked and their inter-
actions are important when establishing stocking policies. The total amount of space,
for example, that is available in a warehouse will limit the amount of inventory held for
each item type. The ability to process incoming freight in a warehouse might limit the
frequency at which each item can be received.
Clearly Amazon.com has many inventory management issues that it must address
daily simply because of the range of item types it stocks. These issues are not the same
as those considered by a small retail shop whose owner can manage inventories of
a limited number of items with a very simple system. But even in small operations,
efﬁcient management of inventories is an essential component of economic success.
Additionally, items differ in their physical attributes. They differ by weight and vol-
ume. Storing automotive mufﬂer systems, which have unusual shapes, is different than

8

Inventories Are Everywhere
storing items that are small and are in boxes. Furthermore, if there are only a small
number of box sizes, then warehouses can be designed much more efﬁciently.
Obsolescence is also an issue. This is a major factor in electronics and style goods
industries where product life cycles are short.
Products are sometimes perishable. Foods, hospital supplies, and blood are all exam-
ples of items that must be managed carefully owing to their limited shelf lives. Certain
of these items require refrigeration. The need to refrigerate products affects the design
of supply chains.
Some products are not unique in the eyes of a customer. As the number of available
products of basically the same type increases (soft drinks, for example), substitutions
occur more frequently. Hence substitution of one product for another is common. If a
retailer stocks out of one item, the customer may take another in its place. This phe-
nomenon is so prevalent that it makes demand estimation quite difﬁcult to do with a
high degree of accuracy. One must analyze inventory and sales data carefully so as to
not miss the effect of substitutions.
Market requirements also differ among items. Demand rates and variability in de-
mand differ. Some products will be required by the customer immediately, such as bread
in a grocery store; for others, such as a Jaguar, customers are willing to wait to get ex-
actly what they want. More will be said about demand characteristics subsequently.
Another important attribute of items is whether they are a consumable, such as foods,
or a repairable item, such as a jet engine. Clearly the management of such items will be
different, which implies that supply chains and inventory policies will differ between
consumable and repairable items.
Finally, the most obvious way that items differ is their cost. The cost of an automo-
bile engine differs dramatically from that of a toothpick. Hence policies for controlling
items will depend to a large extent on the cost of the items and the cost inherent in
storing and managing them. The nature of these costs is discussed in what follows.
1.3.3 Market Characteristics
As we discussed, not all item types are the same. A key way in which they differ is their
demand rates. In most commercial settings, some items have very high demand rates
relative to the vast majority of the items, which have low demand rates. It is not unusual
for a small percentage of the items sold to account for 80% to 90% of the units or value
of units shipped. This is an example of Pareto’s law, or, as it is sometimes called, the
“80–20” rule. In the inventory context, this rule implies that approximately 20% of the
items account for about 80% of a company’s total sales revenue or items sold. Within
this context, the item types that yield this 80% of sales are sometimes called the A

1.3

9
items. Those items comprising the next 15% of sales are called the B type items, and
the remainder are called C type items. The C type items often account for about 50%
of the item types sold, although they generate only about 5% of the sales.
In many instances, this ABC type classiﬁcation also holds for a company’s cus-
tomers. That is, a very large portion of sales of a company goes to a few customers, the
A customers. Smaller portions go to the B and C customers, where, as before, 50% of
the customers generate only a small fraction of the company’s sales.
The two Pareto curves in Figures 1.3 and 1.4 illustrate the nature of these ABC
curves for items and customers. The graph in Figure 1.3 represents the cumulative

percentage of demand as a function of the cumulative percentage of items for a ma-
jor on-line retailer for three product lines. While the classical Pareto curve assumes that
80% of demand would be in 20% of the items, these data show that in the on-line retail
sector this assumption does not hold. In fact, about 10% of the items account for over
80% of the demand in the example.

The graph in Figure 1.4 illustrates a Pareto curve for customers versus demand. The
graph was constructed from data obtained from a ﬁrm that produces components for
the automotive, truck, construction and farm equipment sectors. Note that in this case
80% of the total demand over a year arose from 20% of the customers (187 out of 935),
an exact example of the classic 80–20 rule.

A reason for performing an ABC analysis is to help understand what items to stock
at which locations. Furthermore, delivery promises made to customers for these item
types should probably differ. Unless margins are large, it is very difﬁcult to achieve high
off-the-shelf service and to provide the service proﬁtably. Demand for lower-volume
products is often highly variable, thereby resulting in substantial forecast errors. Given
the generally high forecast errors for low demand rate items, companies have relatively
larger amounts of safety and cycle stock in low demand rate items. It is not unusual for
20% or more of the inventory stocked by a company to be in the C type items. Such
inventories are prone to become obsolete, and hence can become a severe ﬁnancial
liability to a company.
The graph in Figure 1.5 illustrates the volatility of the demand. These data corre-
spond to actual demands experienced by a ﬁrm with which we have worked.
The models we will develop all make assumptions concerning the way demand pro-
cesses evolve over time and what we know about these patterns. We will assume in
some cases that demand is perfectly predictable, while in others we will assume that
forecast errors exist. In the latter case, we will assume some statistical distribution of
observed demand relative to the forecast of demand, such as a Poisson distribution or

1.3
Factors Affecting Inventory Policy Decisions
11
a normal distribution. The inventory optimization models require us to stipulate the
underlying mathematical models for these distributions. In this text, as is the case in
virtually all texts, these distributions of forecast errors are called the demand distri-
butions. Thus what will be called demand distributions are in fact the distribution of
observed demand relative to the forecast.
Fig. 1.5. Historical demand by day.
The models that are used to describe demand processes can represent seasonal pat-
terns, high or low degrees of uncertainty (as measured by the coefﬁcient of variation,
which is the standard deviation of demand over a period of time divided by the ex-
pected demand over that same time period), correlations between items over time, or
other factors. As stated, in some instances we will assume that demand processes are
known with certainty, while in others we may assume that demand processes are either
stationary or non-stationary.
The perception of demand and the demand model that is used will depend in practice
on the information systems employed throughout a supply chain. The degree to which
collaboration exists throughout a supply chain affects the forecast errors and hence
the demand model. While variability may exist when supply chain partners plan op-
erational strategy and tactics collaboratively, uncertainty will be reduced dramatically.

12

Inventories Are Everywhere
Uncertainty in demand forecasting and the degree of collaboration or information shar-
ing are tightly linked. The greater the degree of collaboration, the lower the coefﬁcient
of variation of the demand model.
1.3.4 Lead Times
Lead times exist in supply chains, and greatly affect stock levels. In general, lead times
measure the time lag between the placement of an order and its receipt. Normally, we
think of lead time length as a measure of the responsiveness of a supplier. The longer the
lead time, the more uncertain we are as to the demand over the lead time and, therefore,
the requirement for inventory.
When modeling the demand process, we usually are thinking of the demand that
arises over a lead time. This is the case since safety stock requirements are directly
related to the length of the lead time. When a lead time’s length is uncertain, then the
demand over a lead time almost surely becomes more uncertain and again safety stock
requirements increase.
We will show how lead times affect inventory requirements in many places in this
text. We will make assumptions about lead time lengths and uncertainty when we de-
velop decision models. In some cases we will assume lead times are constants and in
others that lead times are random variables. We will assume that lead times of succes-
sive orders may or may not cross. That is, if an order is placed for an item type at a
point in time and another order for the same item type is placed at a later point in time,
we may assume that the order placed ﬁrst must arrive ﬁrst. This is called the no crossing
assumption.
1.3.5 Costs
Cost is one of the key factors in determining an inventory policy. Most models for
planning inventory requirements consider costs of various types. Some of the types of
costs that are found in practice and captured in models include purchasing, carrying
or holding, stockout, and obsolescence costs. Additionally, costs of receiving, order-
ing, processing, and fulﬁlling customer orders (including accounting and information
acquisition) are considered in some models.
Purchasing costs differ by application. In manufacturing settings, purchasing implies
acquisition of components and raw materials as well as obtaining supplies and equip-
ment. In retail environments, purchasing pertains to the acquisition of products offered

1.3
Factors Affecting Inventory Policy Decisions
13
for sale, normally to customers. Inventory policies used to manage the acquisition of
materials, components, or ﬁnished goods will depend on the unit costs and the ﬁxed
costs incurred when placing orders. Unit costs may depend on the volume purchased;
sometimes there are discounts for all units purchased when an order passes a threshold.
Other times the incremental cost of purchasing additional units is lower than the per
unit purchasing cost of the preceding unit. We have all seen ads that say “buy one at
full price and get the second unit for 50% off.” Thus variable purchasing costs can be
quantity-dependent.
Fixed procurement costs are those costs that when incurred are independent of the
quantity purchased. We incur such costs every time we go to a store to purchase food.
There is a cost to get to the store that is independent of how much we purchase. Suppose
we went to a grocery store to purchase the ingredients needed to make a single sandwich
every time we wanted to eat a sandwich. Thus the frequency at which we would visit the
grocery store to purchase these ingredients would exactly match the frequency at which
we desire to eat a sandwich. An alternative strategy would be to purchase quantities of
many different ingredients (ham, roast beef, turkey, tuna ﬁsh, various breads, etc.) that
can be used to assemble sandwiches that we may desire to eat over the next several
days. Thus the frequency of visiting the grocery store would be lower, but there are
other potential problems. Perhaps I would not eat all that has been purchased before it
spoils. Then there is another cost that is incurred. If I purchased very large quantities of
various ingredients I would have also committed money that could have been used for
other activities.
Then there are tradeoffs. The frequency of making purchases results in ﬁrms ex-
pending resources. As the frequency of making purchases increases, the amount of
ﬁxed costs incurred increases; however, the cost of holding or carrying inventories for
most items for short periods of time is relatively low. When purchases are made infre-
quently, ﬁxed ordering costs are low, but more inventory is carried in the form of cycle
stocks.
The carrying costs for ﬁrms consist of the opportunity cost of not applying the capital
to other projects; the cost of this capital invested in inventory by the ﬁrm; out of pocket
costs for insurance, taxes, damage, pilferage, and warehouse operating costs (ﬁxed and
variable); and the cost of obsolescence.
Costs of carrying inventory vary greatly by product, stocking location, potential for
technological obsolescence, physical storage costs, and so forth. These holding costs
are often charged using a simple approximation which may be appropriate in an aggre-
gate sense for a range of investment levels a ﬁrm makes in managing its inventories.
The approximation is to charge holding costs proportional to the monetary value of the
on-hand inventory. The proportionality factor normally ranges from .15 to .25, on an
annual basis, while a value of .40 is possible for items that require special storage facil-

14

Inventories Are Everywhere
ities and are subject to obsolescence. Certain drugs or electronic devices are examples
of such items.
Many of the models developed in this text are based on the assumption that we will
use this proportionality method for calculating inventory holding costs. In several envi-
ronments we will examine, the goal will be to minimize the average annual operating
costs. In these cases, the holding cost proportionality constant has the dimension $/$
invested/year. In other models, in which time is divided into periods, the holding costs
are charged on the basis of the number of units of stock held at a period’s end. The
holding costs are usually calculated using a proportionality factor, but also by taking
the period’s length into account when setting the proportionality constant.
Holding costs are incurred when supply exceeds demand; but, on occasion, there
may not be enough inventory on hand to meet all the demand at the point in time at
which the demand arises. In these cases, some form of stockout cost is incurred. Some-
times customers simply choose to purchase something else, in which a so-called lost
sales cost for the item is incurred. This cost certainly includes the cost of the lost proﬁt
margin, but also includes the possibility that future sales may be affected as well. In
retail settings, a customer can immediately determine whether or not the desired item
is available; however, when purchasing from ﬁrms such as L.L. Bean or Amazon.com,
notifying customers of shortages is not quite as simple. Customers may be informed
that goods are not in stock at the time a request for them is made. Perhaps an estimate
of when the stock will be available is provided to the customer. Customers may re-
ceive several updates about product availability over that time. Providing notiﬁcation to
customers requires the provider of the goods to maintain a complex information infra-
structure, which is costly. Once the goods do arrive they may be shipped to the customer
using a premium transportation mode, such as air freight, which can increase delivery
costs substantially.
In manufacturing settings, stockouts have serious implications for supply chain part-
ners. Production schedules can be disrupted, causing customers to adjust their plans as
well. Premium transportation modes are sometimes used. It is not uncommon for low-
value items to be shipped via expensive air freight because of a temporary shortage at
a component plant. Suppliers to automotive companies do this so that assembly lines
will not be halted for a lack of parts.
Anyone who has worked in a material management organization knows that a very
substantial amount of management’s time is devoted to dealing with inventory short-
ages. Hence the indirect costs of managing shortfalls internally and externally are not
insigniﬁcant. While these crises are commonplace, measuring the cost of dealing with
them is difﬁcult since there are no accounting measures that directly track these incurred
costs.
The models that we will study are divided into either backorder or lost sales mod-
els. In the backorder case, we assume customers wait for the inventory to arrive and

1.4
Measuring Performance
15
eventually have their orders satisﬁed. In the backorder case, we capture shortage costs
in either of two ways. First, there may be a penalty cost incurred given that a demand
arises and cannot be met from stock within a customer’s desired response time. This
cost is charged independently of how long a customer must wait before receiving the
ordered item. Second, the penalty cost may be charged as a function of the length of
time a customer must wait to receive the desired products. Thus stockout costs are
charged from the time an order is received (or due) until it is ﬁnally satisﬁed in this
case. Some models contain both types of costs.
In the models we will study where sales are lost if inventory is not available on time
to meet a customer’s request, a penalty cost will be charged in proportion to the number
of sales that are lost.
1.4 Measuring Performance
Inventory systems exist to provide customers with products and services. Normally
the level of service expected is high, but the level expected depends on the type of
product, the customer being served, and the timeliness of both the need and supply
that is possible or required. I may be willing to wait for several weeks to get a new
Jaguar that meets my exact desires, but I will not wait at all for almost all grocery,
book, electronic, or other media products. Suppliers of products cannot possibly meet
all possible ranges of demands for all products immediately, because of the cost that
would be incurred. Thus, given the nature of the product and customer requirements,
supply chains are constructed and inventory strategies are employed to meet demands
using the physical and management infrastructures inherent in the design of the supply
chains.
The inventory strategies used are based on some form of model. The models may
be very simplistic in nature or may be quite complex. Inventory strategies are based on
models of the supply chain and demand which could be simplistic or complex. Com-
plexity is a function of model components chosen to describe demand, costs, constraints
and the intricacies of the supply chain. Independently of the model’s complexity, there
is some goal that is to be achieved through the application of the model.
The goal may be to establish a policy that would maximize proﬁt or minimize rele-
vant costs when implemented. Of course the optimal policy will depend on the assump-
tions made about the way costs are incurred, how demands arise and are satisﬁed, and
other elements of a supply chain’s operations. Different assumptions lead to different
policies.
Sometimes the system objective is to minimize the cost of achieving some perfor-
mance goal, such as a customer ﬁll rate target or a maximum expected waiting time to

16

satisfy demands. By ﬁll rates, we mean the fraction of demand that is satisﬁed from
stock on time, that is, without backordering. In practice, ﬁll rate goals are often set for
each portion of a supply chain without much understanding of the impacts on cost of
these performance targets. Consequently, too much inventory is often present in supply
chains consisting of many echelons. Hence, substantial inefﬁciencies exist in the man-
aging of supply chain inventories. Judicious use of models can improve understanding
of policies for managing inventories and information within supply chains.
Our goal in this text is to present a variety of models and algorithms that are useful
in setting policies, computing stock levels, and estimating ﬁnancial and operational
performance within supply chains.

EOQ Model
The ﬁrst model we will present is called the economic order quantity (EOQ) model.
This model is studied ﬁrst owing to its simplicity. Simplicity and restrictive modeling
assumptions usually go together, and the EOQ model is not an exception. However, the
presence of these modeling assumptions does not mean that the model cannot be used in
practice. There are many situations in which this model will produce good results. For
example, these models have been effectively employed in automotive, pharmaceutical,
and retail sectors of the economy for many years. Another advantage is that the model
gives the optimal solution in closed form. This allows us to gain insights about the
behavior of the inventory system. The closed-form solution is also easy to compute
(compared to, for example, an iterative method of computation).
In this chapter, we will develop several models for a single-stage system in which
we manage inventory of a single item. The purpose of these models is to determine how
much to purchase (order quantity) and when to place the order (the reorder point). The
common thread across these models is the assumption that demand occurs continuously
at a constant and known rate. We begin with the simple model in which all demand is
satisﬁed on time. In Section 2.2, we develop a model in which some of the demand
could be backordered. In Section 2.3, we consider the EOQ model again; however, the
unit purchasing cost depends on the order size. In the ﬁnal section, we brieﬂy discuss
how to manage many item types when constraints exist that link the lot size decisions
across items.

EOQ Model
2.1 Model Development: Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model
We begin with a discussion of various assumptions underlying the model. This discus-
sion is also used to present the notation.
1. Demand arrives continuously at a constant and known rate of λ units per year. Ar-
rival of demand at a continuous rate implies that the optimal order quantity may
be non-integer. The fractional nature of the optimal order quantity is not a signiﬁ-
cant problem so long as the order quantity is not very small; in practice, one simply
rounds off the order quantity. Similarly, the assumption that demand arrives at a
constant and known rate is rarely satisﬁed in practice. However, the model produces
good results where demand is relatively stable over time.
2. Whenever an order is placed, a ﬁxed cost K is incurred. Each unit of inventory costs
$I to stock per year per dollar invested in inventory. Therefore, if a unit’s purchasing
cost is C, it will cost I ·C to stock one unit of that item for a year.
3. The order arrives τ years after the placement of the order. We assume that τ is
deterministic and known.
4. All the model parameters are unchanging over time.
5. The length of the planning horizon is inﬁnite.
6. All the demand is satisﬁed on time.
Our goal is to determine the order quantity and the reorder interval. Since all the
parameters are stationary over time, the order quantity, denoted by Q, also remains
stationary. The reorder interval is related to when an order should be placed, since
Q

a reorder interval is equal to
the time between two suc-
cessive epochs at which an
order is placed and is called
the cycle length. A cycle is
the time between the plac-
ing of two successive or-
ders. The question of when
to place an order has a sim-
ple answer in this model.
Since demand occurs at a
deterministic and ﬁxed rate
and the order once placed ar-
rives exactly τ years later,
we would want the order to

arrive exactly when the last unit is being sold. Thus the order should be placed τ years
before the depletion of inventory.

2.1
Model Development: Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model
19
The ﬁrst step in the development of the model is the construction of cost expres-
sions. Since total demand per year is λ, the total purchasing cost for one year is Cλ.
Similarly, the number of orders placed per year is equal to λ/Q. Therefore, the total
annual average cost of placing orders is Kλ/Q. The derivation of the total holding cost
per year is a bit more involved. We will begin by ﬁrst computing the average inventory
per cycle. Since each cycle is identical to any other cycle, the average inventory per
year is the same as the average inventory per cycle. The holding cost is equal to the
average inventory per year times the cost of holding one unit of inventory for one year.
Using Figure 2.1, we ﬁnd the average inventory per cycle is equal to:
Area of triangle ADC
Length of the cycle =

2QT

2 .
The annual cost of holding inventory is thus equal to ICQ/2.
Adding the three types of costs together, we get the following objective function,
which we want to minimize over Q:
min
Q≥0 Z(Q) = Cλ + Kλ
Q + ICQ
2 .
(2.1)
Before we compute the optimal value of Q, let us take a step back and think about
what the optimal solution should look like. First, the higher the value of the ﬁxed cost
K, the fewer the number of orders that should be placed every year. This means that the
quantity ordered per order will be high. Second, if the holding cost rate is high, placing
orders more frequently is economical since inventory will on average be lower. A higher
frequency of order placement leads to lower amounts ordered per order. Therefore, our
intuition tells us that the optimal order quantity should increase as the ﬁxed ordering
cost increases and decrease as the holding cost rate increases.
To compute the optimal order quantity, we take the ﬁrst derivative of Z(Q) with
respect to Q and set it equal to zero:
dZ
dQ = 0−K λ
Q2 + IC
2 = 0
or
Q∗=

(2.2)
where Q∗is the optimal order quantity. Note that the derivative of the purchasing cost
Cλ is zero since it is independent of Q. The following examples illustrate the compu-
tation of the optimal order quantity using (2.2).
In our ﬁrst example, we assume an ofﬁce supplies store sees a uniform demand rate
of 10 boxes of pencils per week. Each box costs $5. If the ﬁxed cost of placing an

20
2
EOQ Model
order is $10 and the holding cost rate is .20 per year, let us determine the optimal order
quantity using the EOQ model. Assume 52 weeks per year.
In this example K = 10, I = .20, C = 5, and the annual demand rate is λ =
(10)(52) = 520. Substituting these values in (2.2), we get
Q∗=
s
2(520)(10)
(0.2)(5)
= 101.98 ≈102.
In our second example, suppose the regional distribution center (RDC) for a ma-
jor auto manufacturer stocks approximately 20,000 service parts. The RDC fulﬁlls
demands of dozens of dealerships in the region. The RDC places orders with the na-
tional distribution center (NDC), which is also owned by the auto manufacturer. Given
the huge size of these facilities, it is deemed impossible to coordinate the inventory
management of the national and regional distribution centers. Accordingly, each RDC
manages the inventory on its own regardless of the policies at the NDC.
We consider one part, a tail light, for a speciﬁc car model. The demand for this part
is almost steady throughout the year at a rate of 100 units per week. The purchasing
cost of the tail light paid by the RDC to the NDC is $10 per unit. In addition, the RDC
spends on average $0.50 per unit in transportation. A breakdown of the different types
of costs is as follows:
1. The RDC calculates its interest rate to be 15% per year.
2. The cost of maintaining the warehouse and its depreciation is $100,000 per year,
which is independent of the amount of inventory stored there. In addition, the costs
of pilferage and misplacement of inventory are estimated to be 5 cents per dollar of
average inventory stocked.
3. The annual cost of a computer-based order management system is $50,000 and is
not dependent on how often orders are placed.
4. The cost of invoice preparation, postage, time, etc. is estimated to be $100 per order.
5. The cost of unloading every order that arrives is estimated to be $10 per order.
Let us determine the optimal order quantity. The ﬁrst task is to determine the cost
parameters. The holding cost rate I is equal to the interest rate (.15) plus the cost rate
for pilferage and misplacement of inventory (.05). Therefore, I = .20. This rate applies
to the value of the inventory when it arrives at the RDC. This value includes not only the
purchasing cost ($10) but also the value added through transportation ($0.5). Therefore,
the value of C is $10.50. Finally, the ﬁxed cost of order placement includes all costs
that depend on the order frequency. Thus, it includes the order receiving cost ($10) and
the cost of invoice preparation, etc. ($100), but not the cost of the order management
system. Therefore, K = 110. We now substitute these parameters into (2.2) to get the
optimal order quantity:

Q∗=

= 738.08 units.
Next, let us determine whether or not the optimal EOQ solution matches our intu-
ition. If the ﬁxed cost K increases, the numerator of (2.2) increases and the optimal order
quantity Q∗increases. Similarly, as the holding cost rate I increases, the denominator of
(2.2) increases and the optimal order quantity Q∗decreases. Clearly, the solution fulﬁlls
our expectations.
To gain more insights, let us explore additional properties the optimal solution pos-
sesses. Figure 2.2 shows the plot of the average annual ﬁxed order cost Kλ/Q and the
annual holding cost ICQ/2
as functions of Q. The aver-
age annual ﬁxed order cost
decreases
as
Q
increases
because fewer orders are
placed. On the other hand,
the average annual holding
cost increases as Q increases
since units remain in inven-
tory longer. Thus the or-
der quantity affects the two
types of costs in opposite
ways. The annual ﬁxed or-
dering cost is minimized by
making Q as large as possi-
ble, but the holding cost is
minimized by having Q as
small as possible. The two

and, in this case, Q1 = Q∗. The exact balance of the holding and setup costs yields
the optimal order quantity. In other words, the optimal solution is the best compromise
between the two types of costs. (As we will see throughout this book, inventory models
are based on ﬁnding the best compromise between opposing costs.) Since the annual
holding cost ICQ∗/2 and the ﬁxed cost Kλ/Q∗are equal in the optimal solution, the
optimal average annual total cost is equal to

The purchasing cost is equal to ($5)(520) = $2600, and the holding and order place-
ment costs account for the remaining cost of $101.98.
2.1.1 Robustness of the EOQ Model
In the real world, it is often difﬁcult to estimate the model parameters accurately. The
cost and demand parameter values used in models are at best an approximation to their
actual values. The policy computed using the approximated parameters, henceforth re-
ferred to as approximated policy, cannot be optimal. The optimal policy cannot be com-
puted without knowing the true values of the model’s parameters. Clearly, if another
policy is used, the realized cost will be greater than the cost of the true optimal policy.
The following example illustrates this point.
Suppose in the ofﬁce supplies example that the ﬁxed cost of order placement is
estimated to be $4 and the holding cost rate is estimated to be .15. Let us calculate the
alternative policy and the cost difference between employing this policy and the optimal
policy. Recall that the average annual cost incurred when following the optimal policy
is $2701.98. To compute the alternative policy, we substitute the estimated parameter
values into (2.2):
Q∗=
s
2(520)(4)
(0.15)(5) = 74.48.
The realized average annual cost if this policy is used when K = 10 is

= $2707.06.

2.1

Thus the cost difference between the alternative and optimal policies is $2707.06 −
$2701.98 = $5.08. Note that the cost of implementing the alternative policy is calcu-
lated using the actual cost parameters.
Let us now derive an upper bound on the realized average annual cost of using the
approximate policy relative to the optimal cost. Suppose the actual order quantity is
denoted by Q∗
a. This is the answer we would get from (2.2) if we could use the true
cost and demand parameters. Let the true ﬁxed cost and holding cost rate be denoted
by Ka and Ia, respectively. We assume that the purchasing cost C and the demand rate
λ have been estimated accurately. The estimates of the ﬁxed cost and holding cost rate
are denoted by K and I, respectively. The estimated order quantity is denoted by Q∗.

Since the purchasing cost Cλ is not inﬂuenced by the order quantity, we do not
include it in the comparison of costs. The true average annual operating cost (the sum
of the holding and order placement costs) is equal to

Therefore, if the estimated order quantity is α times the optimal order quantity, the

times
the optimal cost. For example, if α = 2 (or 1
2), that is, the estimated order quantity
is 100% greater (or 50% lower) than the optimal order quantity, then the cost corre-
sponding to the estimated order quantity is 1.25 times the optimal cost. Similarly, when
α = 3 (or 1
3), the cost corresponding to the estimated order quantity is approximately
1.67 times the optimal cost.
Two observations can be made. First, and importantly, even for signiﬁcant inaccura-
cies in the order quantity, the cost increase is modest. As we showed, the cost increase
is only 25% for a 100% increase in the estimated order quantity from the optimal or-
der quantity. The moderate effect of inaccuracies in the cost parameters on the actual
incurred average annual cost is very profound. Second, the cost increase is symmet-
ric around α = 1 in a multiplicative sense. That is, the cost increase is the same for
Q∗/Q∗
a = α or Q∗/Q∗
a = 1
α . This observation will be useful in the discussion presented
in the following chapter.
How do we estimate α? Clearly, if we could estimate α precisely, then we could
compute Q∗
a precisely as well and there would be no need to use the estimated order
quantity. Since we cannot ascertain its value with certainty, perhaps we can estimate
upper and lower bounds for α. These bounds can give us bounds on the cost of using the
estimated order quantity relative to the optimal cost. The following example illustrates
this notion in more detail.
Suppose in the ofﬁce supplies example that the retailer is conﬁdent that his actual
ﬁxed cost is at most 120% but no less than 80% of the estimated ﬁxed cost. Similarly,
he is sure that his actual holding cost rate is at most 110% but no less than 90% of the
estimated holding cost rate. Let us determine the maximum deviation from the optimal
cost by implementing a policy obtained on the basis of the estimated parameter values.
We are given that
0.8 ≤Ka
K ≤1.2,
and that
0.9 ≤Ia
I ≤1.1.
The cost increases when the estimated order quantity is either less than or more than
the optimal order quantity. Our approach will involve computing the lower and upper
bounds on α and then computing the cost bounds corresponding to these values of α.
The maximum of these cost bounds will be the maximum possible deviation of the cost
of using the estimated order quantity relative to the optimal cost.
Since α =

, we use the upper bound on Ia/I and the lower bound on
Ka/K to get an upper bound on α. Thus,

The cost of using the estimated order quantity corresponding to α = 1.17 is 1

1.17) = 1.013 times the optimal cost.
Similarly, to get a lower bound on α, we use the lower bound on Ia/I and the upper
bound on Ka/K. Thus,
α ≥

1.2 = 0.87.
The cost of using the estimated order quantity corresponding to α = 0.87 is 1

of 1.01 and 1.013 times the optimal cost. Therefore, the cost of using the estimated
order quantity is at most 1.3% higher than would be obtained if the optimal policy were
implemented.
2.1.2 Reorder Point and Reorder Interval
In the EOQ model, the demand rate and lead time are known with certainty. Therefore,
an order is placed such that the inventory arrives exactly when it is needed. This means
that if the inventory is going to be depleted at time t and the lead time is τ, then an order
should be placed at time t −τ. If we place the order before time t −τ, then the order
will arrive before time t. Clearly holding costs can be eliminated by having the order
arrive at time t. On the other hand, delaying the placement of an order so that it arrives
after time t is not permissible since a backorder will occur.
How should we determine the reorder point in terms of the inventory remaining on
the shelf? There are two cases depending upon whether the lead time is less than or
greater than the reorder interval, that is, whether τ ≤T or τ > T. We discuss the ﬁrst
case here; the details for the second case are left as an exercise. Since the on-hand
inventory at the time an order arrives is zero, the inventory at time t −τ should be equal
to the total demand realized during the time interval (t −τ,t], which is equal to λτ.
Therefore, the reorder point when τ ≤T is equal to
r∗= λτ.
(2.4)
In other words, whenever the inventory drops to the level λτ, an order must be placed.
Observe that r∗does not depend on the optimal order quantity.
On the other hand, when τ > T, the reorder point is equal to

26
2
EOQ Model
r∗= λτ1,
(2.5)
where τ1 is the remainder when τ is divided by T. That is, τ = mT + τ1, where m is a
positive integer.
The time between the placement of two successive orders, T, is equal to the time
between the receipt of two successive order deliveries, since the lead time is a known
constant. Since orders are received when the inventory level is zero, the quantity re-
ceived, Q∗, is consumed entirely at the demand rate λ by the time the next order is
received. Therefore, if the optimal reorder interval is denoted by T ∗, Q∗= λT ∗. Hence
T ∗= Q∗
λ =
r
2K
λIC.
(2.6)
Suppose in our ofﬁce supplies example that the lead time is equal to 2 weeks. In this
case, the reorder interval T ∗is equal to
T ∗= Q∗
λ = 101.98
520
= 0.196 year = 10.196 weeks.
Since τ = 2
52 years, which is less than the reorder interval, we can use (2.4) to ﬁnd
the reorder point. The reorder point r∗is equal to
r∗= λτ = (520)(2/52) = 20.
2.2 EOQ Model with Backordering Allowed
In this section we will relax one of the assumptions we have made about satisfying all
demand on time. We will now allow some of the demand to be backordered, but there
will be a cost penalty incurred. The rest of the modeling assumptions remain unaltered.
As a result, the cost function now consists of four components: the purchasing cost, the
ﬁxed cost of order placement, the inventory holding cost, and the backlog penalty cost.
The system dynamics are shown in Figure 2.3.
Each order cycle is comprised of two sub-cycles. The ﬁrst sub-cycle (ADC) is T1
years long and is characterized by positive on-hand inventory which decreases at the
demand rate of λ. The second sub-cycle (CEF) is T2 years long, during which demand
is backordered. Hence there is no on-hand inventory during this time period. Since no
demand is satisﬁed in this latter period, the backlog increases at the demand rate λ. The
total length of a cycle is T = T1 +T2.

There are two decisions to be made: How much to order whenever an order is placed,
and how large the maximum backlog level should be in each cycle. The order quantity
is denoted by Q as before, and we use B to denote the maximum amount of backlog
allowed. When an order arrives, all the backordered demand is satisﬁed immediately.
Thus, the remaining Q−B units of on-hand inventory satisﬁes demand in the ﬁrst sub-
cycle. Since this on-hand inventory decreases at rate λ and becomes zero in T1 years,
Q−B = λT1.
(2.7)
In the second sub-cycle, the number of backorders increases from 0 to B at rate λ over
a period of length T2 years. Thus
B = λT2
(2.8)
and
Q = λ(T1 +T2) = λT.
(2.9)
The cost expressions for the purchasing cost and annual ﬁxed ordering cost remain
the same as for the EOQ model and are equal to Cλ and Kλ/Q, respectively. The
expression for the average annual holding cost is different. We ﬁrst compute the average
inventory per cycle and then multiply the result by the holding cost IC to get the annual
holding cost. The average inventory per cycle is equal to

We next substitute for T1 and T. This results in an expression which is a function only
of Q and B, our decision variables.

The computation of the average annual backordering cost is similar. We let π be
the cost of backordering a unit for one year. The ﬁrst step is to compute the average
number of backorders per cycle. Since all cycles are alike, this means that the average
number of outstanding backorders per year is the same as the average per cycle. To get
the average backorder cost per year, we multiply the average backorder quantities per
year by the backorder cost rate. The average number of backorders per cycle is equal to
the area of triangle CEF in Figure 2.3 divided by the length of the cycle T:

In the last equality, we have used the relationships T2 = B/λ and T = Q/λ. Therefore,
the average annual backorder cost is equal to π B2
2Q.
We now combine all the cost components and express the average annual cost of
managing inventory as
Z(B,Q) = Cλ +K λ
Q +IC(Q−B)2
2Q

2Q.
(2.10)
Before we obtain the optimal solution, let us anticipate what properties we expect
the optimal solution to possess. As before, if the ﬁxed order cost K increases, fewer
orders will be placed, which will increase the order quantity. An increase in the holding
cost rate should drive the order quantity to lower values. The effect of the backorder
cost on the maximum possible number of units backordered should be as follows: the
higher the backorder cost, the lower the maximum desirable number of backorders. We
will state additional insights after deriving the optimal solution.
To obtain the optimal solution, we take the ﬁrst partial derivatives of Z(B,Q) in
(2.10) with respect to Q and B and set them equal to zero. This yields two simultaneous
equations in Q and B:

Again, let us return to our ofﬁce supplies example. Assume now that the pencils
sold by the ofﬁce-supplies retailer are somewhat exotic and that they are not available
anywhere else in the town. This means that the customers wait if the retailer runs out of
the pencil boxes. Sensing this, the retailer now wants to allow backordering of demand
when determining the inventory replenishment policy. Suppose that the cost to backor-
der a unit per year is $10. Let us determine the optimal order quantity and the maximum
quantity of backorders that will be permitted to accumulate. Since IC = (0.2)(5) = 1,
π = 10, and QE = 101.98, we can use (2.14) to determine
Q∗= QE

Next, we use (2.15) to determine the maximum level of backlog
B∗= Q∗
IC
IC +π = (106.96)

1+10 = 9.72.
Several observations can now be made.
1. Our pre-derivation intuition holds. As K increases, Q∗increases, implying a decrease
in the number of orders placed per year. As the holding cost rate I increases, IC+π
IC
=
1+ π
IC decreases, and Q∗decreases. Finally, as π increases, the denominator of (2.15)
increases, and B∗decreases.
2. The maximum number of backorders per cycle, B∗, cannot be more than the order
quantity per cycle Q∗since B∗
Q∗=
IC
IC+π ≤1.
3. Q∗is never smaller than QE, the optimal order quantity for the EOQ model with-
out backordering. Immediately after the arrival of an order, part of the order is used
to fulﬁll the backordered demand. This saves the holding cost on that part of the
received order and allows the placement of a bigger order. As π increases, backor-
dering becomes more expensive and B∗decreases. As a result, the component of Q∗
that is used to satisfy the backlog decreases and Q∗comes closer to QE.
4. As the holding cost rate I increases,
IC
IC+π increases and B∗increases.
To improve our understanding even further, let us compare the ﬁxed cost to the sum of
the holding and backordering costs at Q = Q∗and B = B∗.
From (2.15), B∗
Q∗=
IC
IC+π , which means that
Q∗−B∗
Q∗

Q∗= 1−
IC
IC +π =

Now, the holding cost at Q = Q∗and B = B∗is equal to

which, after substitution of Q∗, is equal to

2(IC+π).
On the other hand, the ﬁxed cost of order placement at Q = Q∗is equal to
λK
Q∗=
s
λKICπ
2(IC +π),
where we have substituted for Q∗. The expressions for the average annual ﬁxed cost
and the sum of the holding and backordering costs are equal. Once again we note that
in an optimal solution the costs are balanced.
2.2.1 The Optimal Cost
Since the optimal average annual cost is equal to the purchasing cost plus two times the
average annual ﬁxed cost,
Z(B∗,Q∗) = Cλ +K λ
Q∗+IC(Q∗−B∗)2
2Q∗

2Q∗= Cλ +2K λ

Let us compute the cost of following the optimal policy in our backordering exam-
ple. Recall that K = 10, λ = 520, I = .20, C = $5, and π = 10. Thus the optimal cost
is
Z(B∗,Q∗) = Cλ +

= 2697.23.
The purchasing cost is equal to $2600 and the remaining cost of $97.23 arises from
inventory/backlog management. Notice that the optimal cost is lower than the cost ob-
tained without backordering.
2.3 Quantity Discount Model
In this section, we will study inventory management when the unit purchasing cost
decreases with the order quantity Q. In other words, a discount is given by the seller if
the buyer purchases a large number of units. Our objective is to determine the optimal

32
2
EOQ Model
ordering policy for the buyer in the presence of such incentives. The remainder of the
model is the same as stated in Section 2.1.
We will discuss two types of quantity discount contracts: all units discounts and
incremental quantity discounts. An example of all units discounts is as follows.
Table 2.1. Example data for all units discount.

If the buyer purchases 100 or fewer units, he pays $5 for each unit purchased. If
he purchases at least 101 but no more than 250 units, he pays $4.50 for each unit

purchased. Thus the cost of
purchasing 150 units in a
single order is (150)(4.5) =
$675. Similarly, his purchas-
ing cost comes down to only
$4.00 per unit if he pur-
chases at least 251 units.
Therefore, in the all units
discounts model, as the order
quantity increases, the unit
purchasing
cost
decreases
for every unit purchased.
Figure 2.4 shows the total
purchasing cost function for
the all units discounts.
Fig. 2.4. Total purchasing cost for all units discount.
The incremental quantity discount is an alternative type of discount. Let us consider
an example. Here the unit purchasing price is $1.00 for every unit up to 200 units. If
Table 2.2. Example data for incremental quantity discount.

Per-Unit Price

only for units numbered 201 through 500. The total purchasing cost of 300 units will be
(200)(1)+(300−200)(0.98) = $298. Similarly, if at least 501 units are purchased, the
unit purchasing price de-
creases to $0.95 for units
numbered
501,
502,
etc.
Therefore, in the incremen-
tal quantity discounts case,
the
unit
purchasing
cost
decreases only for units be-
yond a certain threshold and
not for every unit as in the all
units discounts case. Figure
2.5 illustrates the total pur-
chasing cost function.
Why are these discounts
offered by suppliers? The
reason is to make the cus-
tomers purchase more per
order. As we learned before,

large orders result in high inventory holding costs because an average unit spends a
longer time in the system before it gets sold. Thus the seller’s price discount subsidizes
the buyer’s inventory holding cost.
We will begin with an analysis of the all units discounts contract. We want to ﬁnd
the order quantity that minimizes the average annual sum of the purchasing, holding,
and ﬁxed ordering costs.
2.3.1 All Units Discount
Similarly to the EOQ model, we assume that backordering is not allowed. Let m be the
number of discount possibilities. In the example in Table 2.1, there are three discount
levels, so m = 3. Let q1 = 0,q2,q3,...,qj,qj+1,...,qm be the order quantities at which
the purchasing cost changes. Even though we gave an example in which units were dis-
crete, for simplicity in our analysis we will assume from now on that units are inﬁnitely
divisible. The unit purchasing cost is the same for all Q in [qj,qj+1); let the correspond-
ing unit purchasing cost be denoted by Cj. Thus, the jth lowest unit purchasing cost is
denoted by Cj; Cm is the lowest possible purchasing cost with C1 being the highest unit
purchasing cost. Going back to the example in Table 2.1, q1 = 0, q2 = 101, q3 = 251,
C1 = $5, C2 = $4.50, and C3 = $4.

34
2
EOQ Model
The expression for the average annual cost is similar to (2.1) with one difference.
The purchasing cost now depends on the value of Q. We rewrite the average annual cost
to take this difference into account:
Z j(Q) = Cjλ +K λ
Q + ICjQ
2
,
qj ≤Q < qj+1.
(2.16)
Thus we have a family of cost functions indexed by the subscript j. The jth cost func-
tion is deﬁned for only those values of Q that lie in [qj,qj+1). These functions are shown
in Figure 2.6. The solid portion of each curve corresponds to the interval in which it is
deﬁned. The average annual cost function is thus a combination of these solid portions.
Two observations can be made. First, the average annual cost function is not continu-
ous. It is segmented such that each segment is deﬁned over a discount interval [qj,qj+1).
The segmented nature of the average annual cost function makes solving the problem
slightly more difﬁcult since we now cannot simply take a derivative and set it to zero to
ﬁnd the optimal solution.
It is the second observation that paves the way for an approach to ﬁnd the optimal
solution. Different curves in Figure 2.6 are arranged in an order of decreasing unit
purchasing cost. The curve at the top corresponds to the highest per-unit purchasing
C3/unit
Total
Annual
Cost
C1/unit
C2/unit
q2
q3
q4
cost C1, and the lowest curve
corresponds to the lowest
per-unit purchasing cost Cm.
Also, the curves do not cross
each other. To obtain the op-
timal solution, we will start
from the bottom-most curve
which is deﬁned for Q in
[qm,∞), and compute the
lowest possible cost in this
interval. Then, in the second
iteration, we will consider
the second-lowest curve and
check to see if we could do
better in terms of the cost.
The algorithm continues as
Fig. 2.6. Total cost for all units discount.
long as the cost keeps decreasing. The steps of the algorithm are outlined in the follow-
ing subsection.

2.3

2.3.2 An Algorithm to Determine the Optimal Order Quantity for the All
Units Discount Case
Step 1: Set j = m. Compute the optimal EOQ for the mth cost curve, which we
denote by Q∗
m:
Q∗
m =
s
2Kλ
ICm
.
Step 2: Is Q∗
m ≥qm? If yes, Q∗
m is the optimal order quantity and we are done. If
not, the minimum cost occurs at Q = qm owing to the convexity of the cost function.
Since the minimum point Q∗
m < qm, the cost function for the mth discount level is
increasing on the right of qm. Consequently, among all the feasible order quantities,
that is, for order quantities greater than or equal to qm, the minimum cost occurs at
Q = qm.
Compute the cost corresponding to Q = qm. Let this cost be denoted by Zmin and
Qmin = qm and go to Step 3.
Step 3: Set j = j −1. Compute the optimal EOQ for the jth cost curve:
Q∗
j =
s
2Kλ
ICj
.
Step 4: Is Q∗
j in [qj,qj+1)? If yes, compute Z(Q∗
j) and compare with Zmin. If Z(Q∗
j) <
Zmin, Q∗
j is the optimal order quantity. Otherwise, Qmin is the optimal order quantity.
In either case, we are done.
Otherwise, if Q∗
j is not in [qj,qj+1), then the minimum cost for the jth curve occurs
at Q = qj owing to the convexity of the cost function. Compute this cost Z(qj). If
Z(qj) < Zmin, then set Qmin = qj and Zmin = Z(qj). If j ≥2, go to Step 3; otherwise,
stop.
We now demonstrate the execution of the above algorithm with the following example.
Let us revisit the ofﬁce supplies company once again. Suppose now that the retailer
gets an all units discount of 5% per box of pencils if he purchases at least 110 pencil
boxes in a single order. The deal is further sweetened if the retailer purchases at least
150 boxes in which case he gets a 10% discount. Should the retailer change the order
quantity?
We apply the algorithm to compute the optimal order quantity. There are three dis-
count categories, so m = 3. Also, C1 = 5, C2 = 5(1−0.05) = 4.75, C3 = 5(1−0.1) =
4.50, q1 = 0, q2 = 110, and q3 = 150.

36

EOQ Model
Iteration 1: Initialize j = 3.
Step 1: We compute Q∗
3 =
q
2(520)(10)
(0.2)(4.50) = 107.5.
Step 2: Since Q∗
3 is not greater than q3 = 150, the minimum cost occurs at Q = 150.
This cost is equal to
Zmin = (4.50)(520)+ (10)(520)
150
+ (0.2)(4.50)(150)
2
= $2442.17.
Step 3: Now, we set j = 2. We compute Q∗
2 =
q
2(520)(10)
(0.2)(4.75) = 104.63.
Step 4: Once again, Q∗
2 is not feasible since it does not lie in the interval [110,150).
The minimum feasible cost thus occurs at Q = q2 = 110 and is equal to
Z(q2) = (4.75)(520)+ (10)(520)
110
+ (0.2)(4.75)(110)
2
= $2569.52,
which is higher than Zmin and so the value of Zmin remains unchanged. Now we
proceed to Iteration 2.
Iteration 2:
Step 3: Now, we set j = 1. Recall that the value of Q∗
1 is equal to 101.98.
Step 4: Q∗
1 is feasible since it lies in the interval [0,110). The corresponding cost is
equal to $2701.98, which is also higher than Zmin.
Thus the optimal solution is to order 150 units and the corresponding average annual
cost of purchasing and managing inventory is equal to $2442.17.
Observe that the algorithm stops as soon as we ﬁnd a discount for which Q∗
j is fea-
sible. This does not mean that the optimal solution is equal to Q∗
j; the optimal solution
can still correspond to the ( j + 1)st or higher-indexed discount. That is, the optimal
solution cannot be less than Q∗
j.
2.3.3 Incremental Quantity Discounts
The incremental quantity discount case differs from the all units discount case. In this
situation, as the quantity per order increases, the unit purchasing cost declines incre-
mentally on additional units purchased as opposed to on all the units purchased. Let
q1 = 0,q2,...,qj,qj+1,...,qm be the order quantities at which the unit purchasing cost
changes. The number of discount levels is m. In the example, we assumed that the

2.3
Quantity Discount Model
37
units are discrete; for analysis we will assume that the units are inﬁnitely divisible
and the purchasing quantity can assume any real value. The unit purchasing cost is
the same for all values of Q in [qj,qj+1), and we denote this cost by Cj. By deﬁnition,
C1 >C2 > ··· >Cj >Cj+1 > ··· >Cm. In the above example, m = 3, q2 = 201, q3 = 501
(q1 by deﬁnition is 0), C1 = $1, C2 = $0.98, C3 = $0.95.
Our goal is to determine the optimal number of units to be ordered. We ﬁrst write
an expression for the average annual purchasing cost if Q units are ordered. Let Q be in
the jth discount interval, that is, Q lies between qj and qj+1. The purchasing cost for Q
in this interval is equal to
C(Q) = C1(q2 −q1)+C2(q3 −q2)+···+Cj−1(qj −qj−1)+Cj(Q−qj).
Note that only the last term on the right-hand side of the above expression depends on
Q. Let R j be used to denote the sum of the terms that are independent of Q. That is,
R j = C1(q2 −q1)+C2(q3 −q2)+···+Cj−1(qj −qj−1),
j ≥2,
with R1 = 0. Therefore,
C(Q) = R j +Cj(Q−qj).
Now the average unit purchasing cost for Q units is equal to C(Q)
Q , which is equal to
C(Q)
Q
= R j
Q +Cj −Cj

The average annual purchasing cost when each order consists of Q units is equal to
C(Q)
Q λ. The ﬁxed order cost and holding cost terms remain similar to those in the basic
EOQ model except that the average annual holding cost per unit is now equal to I C(Q)
Q .
This is not surprising since the holding cost per unit depends on the cost of each unit,
which is a function of the order size given the cost structure here. The average annual
cost of managing inventory is thus equal to

which is valid for qj ≤Q < qj+1.
Figure 2.7 shows the Z(Q) function. Once again, we have a family of curves, each of
which is valid for a given interval. The valid portion is shown using a solid line. Thus
the curve with the solid line constitutes the Z(Q) function. Unlike the all units discount
cost function, Z(Q) is a continuous function. It turns out that the optimal solution Q∗
cannot be equal to any one of {q1,q2,...,qm,qm+1}. We use this fact to construct an
algorithm to determine the optimal order quantity.
2.3.4 An Algorithm to Determine the Optimal Order Quantity for the
Incremental Quantity Discount Case
The algorithm for this case is as follows.
Step 1: Compute the order quantity that minimizes Z j(Q) for each j, which is de-
noted by Q∗

This step gives us a total of m possible order quantities.
Step 2: In this step we check which one of these potential values for Q∗is feasible,
that is, qj ≤Q∗
j < qj+1. Disregard the ones that do not satisfy this inequality.
Step 3: Calculate the cost Z j(Q∗
j) corresponding to each remaining Q∗
j. The order
quantity Q∗
j that produces the least cost is the optimal order quantity.
Let us now illustrate the execution of this algorithm. Suppose in the preceding exam-
ple the retailer is offered an incremental quantity discount. Let us determine the optimal
order quantity.
Step 1: R1 = 0, R2 = C1(q2 −q1) = (5)(110 −0) = 550, and R3 = C1(q2 −q1) +
C2(q3 −q2) = R2 +(4.75)(150−110) = 740. We compute

Thus, the optimal solution is to order 294.39 units and the corresponding average

2.4 Lot Sizing When Constraints Exist
In the preceding portions of this chapter, we focused on determining the optimal order-
ing policy for a single item. In many if not most real-world situations, decisions are not
made for each item independently. There may be limitations on space to store items in
warehouses; there may be constraints on the number of orders that can be received per
year; there may be monetary limitations on the value of inventories that are stocked.
Each of these situations requires stocking decisions to be made jointly among the many
items managed at a location. We will illustrate how lot sizing decisions can be made for
a group of items.
Holding costs are often set to limit the amount of space or investment consumed as
a result of the lot sizing decisions. Rather than assuming a holding cost rate is used to
calculate the lot sizes, suppose a constraint is placed on the average amount of money
invested in inventory. Thus a budget constraint is imposed that limits investment across
items. Let Qi be the procurement lot size for item i and Ci the per-unit purchasing cost
for item i, i = 1,...,n, where n is the number of items being managed. The sum
n
∑
i=1
Ci
Qi

measures the average amount invested in inventory over time. Let b be the maximum
amount that can be invested in inventory on average. Furthermore, suppose our goal is
to minimize the average annual total ﬁxed procurement cost over all item types while
adhering to the budget constraint. Let λi and Ki represent the average annual demand
rate and ﬁxed order cost for item i, respectively. Recall that λiKi/Qi measures the aver-
age annual ﬁxed order cost incurred for item i given Qi is the lot size for item i. Deﬁne
Fi(Qi) = λiKi/Qi.
This procurement problem can be stated as follows:

We will obtain the solution for this problem by constructing the corresponding

The function Fi(Qi) is a strictly decreasing function for all i. Hence if there were no

EOQ Model
Observe that the expression for Q∗
i is the same as the EOQ solution with I equal to
θ. Thus θ is the imputed holding cost rate given the budget limitation, b. Note also how
θ is related to the value of b: θ is proportional to the square of the inverse of b.
Let us examine an example problem. Suppose n = 2 and b = 7000. Additional data
are given in the following table.

Thus as the budget level is increased the average annual cost of placing orders decreases
by the value of θ∗.
Many other constrained multi-item lot sizing problems can be formulated and
solved. Some examples are given in the exercises.

2.3. The demand for toilet paper in a convenience store occurs at the rate of 100 pack-
ets per month. Each packet contains a dozen rolls and costs $8. Assuming the order

optimal order quantity, reorder interval, and optimal cost using the EOQ model. Take
one month to be the equivalent of four weeks.

2.4. Suppose now that backordering of demand is allowed in the situation described in
the previous question. The cost of backordering is $10/packet/year. Use the EOQ model
with backordering to determine the optimal order quantity, maximum backlog allowed,
and optimal average annual cost. Also, compute the lengths of the portions of a cycle
with positive on-hand inventory and backorders, respectively.
2.5. Compare the optimal average annual costs obtained in the last two exercises. As-
sume that the relationship between the optimal costs of the EOQ model and the EOQ
model with backordering holds true in general with the same holding cost, ﬁxed order-
ing cost, and demand rate (for example, you may ﬁnd that the optimal cost of the EOQ
model with backordering is lower than the optimal cost of the EOQ model.) Can you
think of an intuitive explanation for your conclusion?
2.6. If the lead time in Exercise 2.3 is 1 week, determine the reorder point.
2.7. The demand for leather laptop cases in an electronics store is fairly regular through-
out the year at 200 cases per year. Each leather case costs $50. Assuming the ﬁxed order
placement cost to be $5/order and holding cost rate to be .30, determine the optimal or-
der quantity using the EOQ model. Compute the reorder point assuming the lead time
to be 4 weeks.
2.8. Suppose in Exercise 2.3 the convenience store receives a discount of 5% per packet
on all units purchased if the order quantity is at least 200 and 7.5% per packet if the
order quantity is at least 250. Would your answer change? If so, what is the new rec-
ommended purchase quantity?
2.9. Solve the last exercise assuming the discount type to be an incremental quantity
discount.
2.10. We illustrated that in the all units discount case, the cost curves for different dis-
count levels are in increasing order of per-unit cost. That is, a curve with a higher
per-unit cost always lies above another curve with lower per-unit cost for any order
quantity. Establish this observation mathematically by comparing the total average an-
nual costs for the two levels of discounts with purchasing costs C1 and C2 such that
C1 < C2.
2.11. The purchasing agent of Doodaldoo Dog Food company can buy horsemeat from
one source for $0.06 per pound for the ﬁrst 1000 pounds and $0.058 for each additional
pound. The company requires 50,000 pounds per year. The cost of placing an order is
$1.00. The inventory holding cost rate is I = .25 per year. Compute the optimal purchase
quantity and the total average annual cost.

2.13. Show in the EOQ model with no backordering that it is optimal to place an order
such that it arrives when the on-hand inventory is zero. Speciﬁcally, show that the cost
of any other policy such that the order arrives when the on-hand inventory is positive is
greater than the cost of the policy in which the order arrives when the on-hand inventory
is zero.

2.15. Consider the basic EOQ model. Suppose the order is delivered in boxes each of
which holds A units. Thus, the order quantity can only be a multiple of A. Using the
convexity of the cost function in Q, compute the optimal order quantity.
2.16. Recall that in the algorithm for the all units discount model we stop as soon as we
identify a discount for which the optimal EOQ, Q∗
j, is feasible. An alternative stopping
criterion is as follows. In Step 3, compute Z(Q∗
j) and stop if Z(Q∗
j) ≥Zmin. While this
stopping criterion involves additional computation, it may eliminate some iterations
and save computational effort overall.
Prove that an algorithm that utilizes the above stopping criterion generates an opti-
mal solution. That is, show that if j is the largest discount index for which Z(Q∗
j) ≥Zmin,
then the optimal order quantity cannot be less than Q∗
j.

Suppose we restrict Q to be integer-valued. Develop an approach for ﬁnding Q∗in this
case.
2.18. Llenroc Automotive produces power steering units in production lots. These units
go into Jaguar’s 4.2 liter engine models and have a demand rate estimated to be 20,000
units per year. Llenroc makes a variety of power steering units in addition to the one
used in this model of Jaguars. Switching from producing one power steering model type
to another incurs a cost of $400. The cost of carrying a power steering unit in stock for
a year is estimated to be $35. While the goal is to minimize the average annual cost
of changeovers and carrying inventory, management has decided that no more than 10
setups per year are permissible for the pump in question.
Develop a mathematical model and a solution approach for determining the opti-
mal lot size given the constraint on production. What is the solution if 20 setups were
possible?

a maximum of b orders can be processed in total in a year. Derive formulas that can
be used to determine the optimal procurement quantities for each item so that the aver-
age annual cost of holding inventories is minimized subject to a constraint on the total
number of orders that can be processed per year. Also, construct formulas for each item
when the objective is to minimize the sum of the average annual ﬁxed ordering costs
and the average annual holding costs subject to the same constraint.

Power-of-Two Policies
We will extend the results of the last chapter in three ways. First, we will consider multi-
stage systems. These systems are characterized by multiple locations where inventory
management decisions have to be made. Recall that in the last chapter, there was only
a single stage, that is, the ordering and inventory management decisions involved only
one location. Second, we will work with the reorder interval as the decision variable
over which cost is optimized instead of the order quantity. We continue to assume that
demand occurs at a deterministic and stationary rate. Thus, once we know the reorder
interval, we can easily determine the corresponding order quantity. Therefore, the two
decision variables are equivalent; our preference for the reorder interval is due to practi-
cal reasons, as we explain below. Third, instead of determining the optimal solution, we
will develop algorithms that determine reorder intervals that are easier to use in practice
but are not necessarily optimal. However, we will establish that the worst possible cost
will not be higher than the optimal cost by more than 6%. These inventory management
policies that we will develop are referred to as power-of-two (PO2) policies.
As we explained in Chapter 1, many of the inventory management models are ap-
plicable in production systems as well. In inventory systems, these models are used to
determine the optimal order quantity and reorder interval; in production systems the
objective is to ﬁnd the lot size and the reorder interval between consecutive production
runs. The PO2 policies that we will study in this chapter can be applied both in pro-
duction and inventory systems. We will discuss the speciﬁc applications while studying
various types of multi-stage systems.
The ﬁrst advantage of the use of the reorder interval is motivated by a production
system. Clearly, while planning production, it is natural to think in terms of producing
items once every planning period (for example, shift, week, or month). When working
with the order quantity as the decision variable, the corresponding reorder interval may
be any real number; remember the relationship from last chapter, T = Q/λ. It could be

1.85 weeks, 2.3 weeks, or an irrational number, for example,
q
9
7 weeks. Such reorder
intervals make resource planning over time a very difﬁcult task.
Another advantage is that the mathematical formulation is simpler if we work with
the reorder interval rather than with the order quantity as the decision variable. In a
multi-stage production system, at each stage it is necessary to ensure that all the com-
ponents required to produce the batch are available at the time of the production. This
constraint is more easily formulated with the reorder interval as the decision variable.
There are practical reasons for using reorder intervals in a non-production setting
as well. It is fairly common for retailers to place orders such that the order quantity
is equal to n periods of forecast demand where n is chosen by the inventory manager.
The length of a period can be measured in hours, days, weeks, etc., depending on the
applications. Thus orders are placed only once every n periods.
3.1 Basic Framework
As in the previous chapter, we will assume that the demand occurs continuously over
time at a constant and known rate λ. Whenever an order is placed, a ﬁxed cost K is
incurred, which is independent of the size of the order quantity. Holding inventory also
incurs a cost, which is proportional to the average inventory. Throughout this chapter,
we use h = IC. The holding cost h is the cost (in $) of holding one unit for one year.
Backordering is not allowed.
Recall from the previous chapter that the EOQ model is given as follows:
min
Q≥0 Z(Q) = Cλ +K λ
Q + 1
2hQ,
(3.1)
where Z(Q) is the average annual cost of managing the inventory and Q is the quantity
purchased per order. In the subsequent analysis we will ignore the annual purchasing
cost term Cλ because it is constant and therefore independent of Q.
Let us assume that the lead time is zero to simplify the discussion. Hence an order is
placed and received at the same instant. Once Q units arrive, they are consumed at the
rate λ. Recall that the reorder interval T = Q/λ. By substituting for Q by λT in (3.1)
and eliminating the purchasing cost term Cλ, we obtain the following formulation of
the decision problem:
min
T≥0 Z(T) = K
T + 1
2hλT.
(3.2)

We abuse the notation here and continue to use Z to denote the cost function when
the argument is T. To simplify notation further, let g = 1
2hλ. Note that g = 1
2hλ is the
annual holding cost if only one order of size λ is placed every year. Substituting g into
(3.2), we get
min
T≥0 Z(T) = K

where T is measured in years. We next obtain the optimal solution by setting dZ(T)

3.1.1 Power-of-Two Policies
So far we have imposed only one constraint on the reorder interval T, the non-negativity
constraint. Often the solution in (3.4) is impractical to implement; for example, it could
be 1.09 weeks. For practical reasons, we assume that there exists a base planning period
TL and that the reorder interval must be an integer multiple of TL. The base planning
period could be equal to a shift, a day, a week, or even a year. Thus the minimum reorder
interval is equal to TL. This constraint can be expressed as follows:
T = nTL,
n ∈{1,2,3,...}.
We will further constrain n to be a power of two, that is, n can only be 1,2,4,8,16,... .
Therefore, the reorder interval T assumes only one of the following values:
{TL,2TL,4TL,8TL,...}.

Power-of-Two Policies
This type of inventory management policy in which the reorder interval is a power-
of-two multiple of the base planning period is known as a power-of-two policy (or
PO2 policy). Two questions arise at this point: What are the advantages of using PO2
policies, and why a power of two and not a power of three, four or ﬁve? The second
question is easier to answer, and we discuss it ﬁrst. The worst-case cost of using a PO2
policy is lower than the worst-case cost of using a PO3, PO4, or POn policy where n is
any non-negative integer. In other words, if we compare the worst possible costs among
the POn type policies, the PO2 policy’s worst-case cost is closest to the optimal cost.
To discuss the advantages of PO2 policies, we reproduce here an example presented
by Muckstadt and Roundy [240]. In their example, they cite the production control sys-
tem used by a major automotive manufacturer in its stamping plants. The demand for
products (doors, body panels, etc.) remained relatively constant over time. The deci-
sion regarding when to produce an item was divided into two stages. In the ﬁrst stage,
the week of the production was determined. This was done in such a way that each
component was produced exactly once, twice, or four times during a four-week cycle.
This is equivalent to the reorder interval being equal to one week, two weeks, or four
weeks. The production quantity during each run was approximately the same. In the
second stage, given the week of the production, the exact time of the production (day,
shift, etc.) was determined. The job of the production planner was considerably easier
because of this approach to production scheduling.
To see another advantage of the PO2 policies, let us consider a simple production
system in which three products, A, B, and C, share a machine. Suppose that A, B, and
C are produced every week, every three weeks, and every ﬁve weeks, respectively. In
this case, the production cycle repeats every ﬁfteen weeks; see the table below. In other
words, all the three products will be produced in the same week every ﬁfteen weeks.
This causes a problem in balancing the load on the machine over time since the ﬁfteenth
week is likely to be overloaded.

To summarize, the PO2 policies make production scheduling easier. They are also
useful in ensuring a more balanced load on machines in a production system. This is
the case when many items are produced on a particular machine. This was the situation
in the real automotive example discussed earlier in this subsection.
3.1.2 PO2 Policy for a Single-Stage System
The inventory management problem for a single-stage system in which the reorder
interval is restricted to be a power-of-two multiple of the base planning period is as
follows:
min
T≥0 Z(T) = K
T +gT,
(3.5)
subject to
T = 2ℓTL,
ℓ= {0,1,2,3,... },
where TL is known. To solve
this problem, we cannot sim-
ply take the derivative of the
objective function, since T
can take only discrete val-
ues. Therefore, we will use a
different approach to obtain
an optimal solution.
Figure 3.1 illustrates that
Z(T) is a convex function of
T. This causes Z(T) to ﬁrst
decrease and then increase
among the feasible values
for T, TL,2TL,.... Let an op-
timal value of T be equal to
2ℓ∗TL. Then ℓ∗should satisfy
the following inequalities:
Z(T)
T=1
T=2
T=4
T=8
T=16
T=32
T=64

ℓ∗≥1,
Z(2ℓ∗TL) ≤Z(2ℓ∗+1TL),
ℓ∗= 0.
For simplicity, we will assume that ℓ∗≥1. The above inequalities can be interpreted in
the following two equivalent ways:

Power-of-Two Policies
1. Consider all the integers ℓsuch that the cost corresponding to the reorder interval
2ℓTL is no greater than the cost corresponding to a reorder interval of length 2ℓ+1TL.
That is, Z(2ℓTL) ≤Z(2ℓ+1TL). Then ℓ∗is the smallest among these values.
For example, in Figure 3.1, possible values of ℓsuch that Z(2ℓTL) ≤Z(2ℓ+1TL) are
3,4,5,..., and ℓ∗= 3.
2. Consider all the integers ℓ≥1 such that the cost corresponding to the reorder interval
2ℓTL is strictly lower than the cost corresponding to a reorder interval of length
2ℓ−1TL. Then ℓ∗is the largest among these values. Note that if Z(2ℓ−1TL) ≤Z(2ℓTL)
for all ℓ≥1, then the optimal PO2 reorder interval is equal to TL. In this case, the cost
function is increasing among the feasible values for T. Thus, the optimal solution
occurs at the lowest feasible value, TL.
For example, in Figure 3.1, possible values of ℓsuch that Z(2ℓTL) ≤Z(2ℓ−1TL) are
1,2, and 3. The largest among them is 3, so ℓ∗= 3.
We will use the ﬁrst statement to compute ℓ∗. Thus, ℓ∗is the smallest non-negative
integer (including zero) such that
Z(2ℓ∗TL) ≤Z(2ℓ∗+1TL).
This relationship implies the following:

Let us consider an example. For a base planning period equal to one week, let us
obtain the optimal PO2 policy for pencil boxes for the ofﬁce supplies retailer example
in Chapter 2.
The solution to this problem can be obtained as follows. Given TL = 1 week, TL
is 1/52 of a year. From the solution to the example in Chapter 2, TE = 0.196 years.
Therefore, the optimal power-of-two multiple 2ℓ∗is the smallest non-negative integer
such that

and hence 2ℓ∗= 8. The optimal PO2 reorder interval is equal to 2ℓ∗TL = (8)(1/52) =
0.154 years = 8 weeks.
3.1.2.1
Cost for the Optimal PO2 Policy
In the previous subsection we stated that the optimal PO2 reorder interval is the largest
positive integer ℓ≥1 such that the cost for a reorder interval T = 2ℓTL is lower than the
cost when T = 2ℓ−1TL, or T = TL. Thus, ℓ∗is also the largest non-negative integer such
that

Therefore the optimal PO2 reorder interval is at least

Since Z(T) is a convex function of T, for any T1 ≤T2 ≤T3, Z(T2) ≤max{Z(T1),

Let us now compare the cost of the optimal PO2 policy (excluding the purchasing
cost) computed in our earlier example with that of the optimal policy computed in
Chapter 2.

3.2 Serial Systems
The simplest multi-stage extension to the EOQ problem is a serial system consisting of
n stages arranged linearly. Figure 3.2 shows an example of a serial system. Observe that
each stage except stage n has exactly one predecessor stage and that each stage except
stage 1 has exactly one successor stage. Our goal is to determine how to determine the
reorder intervals for each of the n stages.

.....
Fig. 3.2. Serial system.
In the following subsection we introduce some nomenclature that will facilitate our
discussion.
3.2.1 Assumptions and Nomenclature
Conceptually we can represent a serial system as a directed graph. The stages form the
nodes and the ﬂow of the product is along the arcs of this graph. Let N(G) and A(G)
denote the node set and the arc set, respectively. That is,
N(G) = {1,...,n}
and
A(G) = {(n,n−1),...,(2,1)}.
For any stage i, λi represents the demand rate, measured in units per year. Since stage
i could use several components produced at stage i + 1, λi could be different for each
stage. There could be demand for components completing a subset of the stages, too.
However, for simplicity, we will assume λi is the same for all the stages. In other words,
λi = λ for all i ∈N(G). We assume there exists a base planning period, TL, measured
in years. All the reorder intervals must be power-of-two multiples of TL. That is, if Ti
represents the reorder interval for stage i, then
Ti = 2ℓiTL,
ℓi ∈{0,1,2,... },
i = 1,...,n.

56

Power-of-Two Policies
There are many policies within the class of power-of-two policies that we could
consider. We will consider only policies that are both nested and stationary. By a nested
policy we mean that if stage i places an order at time t, then stages 1 through i−1 also
place an order at the same time. Thus when stage n orders, all succeeding stages order
and the system restarts its inventory planning cycle. By stationary we mean the reorder
intervals do not change over time. The reorder interval for stage i is always Ti.
Nested policies have two advantages. First, for the same order frequency and order
sizes per year, a nested policy generates lower annual holding cost than a non-nested
policy for a serial system; we discuss this fact in more detail later. Second, since the
order placement at a stage in a nested policy leads to the order placement at all the
successor stages, a nested policy prevents buildup of work-in-process inventory.
We will consider two types of costs, the ﬁxed ordering cost and the holding cost.
Let Ki be the ﬁxed cost at stage i. The average annual ﬁxed cost of placing orders is
computed in the same manner as for the EOQ model and is equal to Ki/Ti for stage
i. The computation of the annual holding cost at each stage could also be done in a
manner similar to the one used in the development of the EOQ model. Speciﬁcally, the
average annual stage-i holding cost could be obtained by multiplying the average on-
hand stock by the on-hand holding cost rate hi. However, as we will see, this approach
is difﬁcult to use for complex networks including serial systems. Therefore, we will use
a different but equivalent method to compute the average annual holding cost.
In the new approach, the average annual holding cost at stage i is computed as the
product of the average echelon holding cost and echelon stock. The echelon holding
cost, denoted by h′
i, is a measure of the value added only due to the activity at stage
i. On the other hand, the conventional holding cost hi is a measure of the total value
added up to and including stage i. Therefore, the echelon holding cost for stage i, h′
i, is
equal to the difference of the conventional holding cost for stage i, hi, and conventional
holding cost for the predecessor stage i+1, hi+1. That is, h′
i = hi −hi+1. For stage n, the
echelon and conventional holding costs are equal, that is, hn = h′
n. If we add the echelon
holding costs for stages j = i,i+1,...,n, we get
h′
i +h′
i+1 +···+h′
n = (hi −hi+1)+(hi+1 −hi+2)+···+(hn−1 −hn)+(hn),
where, for stage n, we substitute h′
n = hn. The right-hand side telescopes to hi. Thus,
hi =
n
∑
j=i
h′
j. This expression is intuitive; it says that the total value added up through
stage i (of which hi is the measure) is equal to the sum of the incremental values added
in stages n through i (of which h′
i is the measure). Note that both the on-hand and
echelon holding costs are measured in $ per unit per year.
Let us examine a three-stage serial system. Let the on-hand (conventional) holding
costs be h1 = 5, h2 = 4, h3 = 1. Let us compute the echelon holding costs. For stage 3,

3.2
Serial Systems
57
h′
3 = h3 = 1. For stages 1 and 2, we will use the relation h′
i = hi −hi+1. Therefore, for
stage 2, h′
2 = h2 −h3 = 3 and for stage 1, h′
1 = h1 −h2 = 1.
We deﬁne the echelon stock for stage i to be the sum of the on-hand inventories at
stages 1 through i. For example, if stage 1 has 2 units, stage 2 has 3 units, and stage
3 has 1 unit, then the echelon stocks for stage 3 and stage 2 are equal to 6 units and 5
units, respectively. The echelon stock for stage 1 is equal to its on-hand stock, 2 units.
Figure 3.3 shows both the on-hand and echelon stocks for a two-stage system. Ob-
serve that the echelon stock graphs for both the stages exhibit the familiar saw-tooth
pattern. On the other hand,
the graphs for the on-hand
stock are not both saw-tooth
in nature. Consequently, for
more complex systems it is
not always easy to calculate
the average on-hand stock.
However, the graph of ech-
elon stock is always of the
saw-tooth form no matter
how complex the system.
Hence it is easier to compute
the average echelon stock
compared to the average on-
hand stock. But do the two
approaches yield the same
holding costs? The answer
is yes. We show the equiv-
alence between the two ap-
proaches for a two-stage sys-
tem where T1 = 1
2T2.
First, we compute the av-
erage annual holding cost
using the average on-hand
inventory and on-hand in-
ventory holding cost. For
stage 2, consider the cy-

cle that starts at time t, as shown in Figure 3.3. At time t, an order of size λT2 is placed.
Since nested policies are followed, stage 1 also places an order of size λT1 = 1
2λT2
with stage 2 at time t. Assuming the lead time is zero, the order sent from stage 2
arrives immediately at stage 1. Consequently, the leftover inventory at stage 2 at time t
is λT2 −1
2λT2 = 1
2λT2. Now at time t +T1, stage 1 places another order of size λT1 =

2λT2 with stage 2, which again is sent and received immediately. This depletes all the
remaining inventory at stage 2 and so the on-hand inventory at stage 2 is zero in the
second half of the cycle. Therefore, the average annual inventory holding cost at stage
2 is
(h2)Area Under the Inventory Curve DEFG
Length of the Cycle

2h2λT1.
For stage 1, the computation of the average annual inventory cost is the same as for the
EOQ model and is equal to 1
2h1λT1. Therefore, the total average annual inventory cost
for the two stages is
1
2h2λT1 + 1
2h1λT1 = 1
2(h1 +h2)λT1.
(3.8)
Next we compute the average annual cost of holding inventory using the echelon
stocks and echelon holding costs. Figure 3.3 also shows how the echelon stock at stage
2 changes over time. Once again, let us consider the cycle that starts at time t. Even
though half of the inventory that stage 2 received at time t is sent to stage 1 immediately,
it still remains part of the echelon stock for stage 2. Thus, the echelon stock for stage
2 at time t is equal to λT2. Similarly, at time t +T1 the remaining on-hand inventory at
stage 2 is sent to stage 1. But the on-hand stock at stage 1 is part of the echelon stock
for stage 2 and therefore the echelon stock at t + T1 for stage 2 is equal to λT1. The
echelon stock declines at the rate λ. The annual holding cost for stage 2 is thus equal to

In Figure 3.4, suppose an or-

which stage 1 places an or-
der. Consider another plan
that differs from the ﬁrst one
only in that the order placed
at stage 2 is moved from t′

sions remain the same. The
number of setups is the same
in both plans; however, the

Having laid the background, we will develop the model in the following subsection.

i. The above formulation has two types of constraints. The ﬁrst type
of constraint (Ti = 2ℓiTL) arises from the restriction of a PO2 policy. The second type
of constraint (Ti ≥Ti−1) is necessary to ensure nestedness. Given nestedness, an order
placed by stage i always requires i−1 to place an order. As a result, the reorder interval
at stage i cannot be less than the reorder interval at stage i−1 (Ti ≥Ti−1).

In problem (RP), the reorder intervals are not restricted to be power-of-two multiples
of the base planning interval. As a result, (RP) is easier to solve. Our approach will be
to ﬁrst obtain the solution to (RP) and then use this solution to solve (P).
Let us introduce some additional deﬁnitions. Deﬁne a subgraph G of G′ to consist
of a node set N(G) and an arc set A(G) such that N(G) and A(G) are subsets of the
sets of nodes and arcs of G′,
that is, N(G) ⊂N(G′) and
A(G) ⊂A(G′), respectively.
Further, an arc (i, j) is an el-
ement of A(G) if and only
if the nodes i and j are in
N(G). This condition is a
sensibility condition that en-
sures that there are no arcs in
G whose beginning and end-
ing nodes are not contained
in N(G). In Figure 3.5, G
is a subgraph of graph G′.
Also, N(G) = {1,2,3} and
A(G) = {(3,2),(2,1)}.
Now, suppose G1 and G2
are subgraphs of G′. We say
that G1 and G2 are ordered
by precedence if there does

not exist an arc (j,i) ∈A(G′) such that j ∈N(G1) and i ∈N(G2). In other words, if G1
and G2 are ordered by precedence, then no arc can start from a node in N(G1) and end
at a node in N(G2); any arcs that connect G1 and G2 must originate in G2. The upper
portion of Figure 3.6 shows two subgraphs G1 and G2 for graph G′ shown in Figure 3.5.
Subgraphs G1 and G2 are ordered by precedence since the only arc that connects the
two subgraphs goes from node 3, belonging to higher-indexed G2, to node 2, belonging
to lower-indexed G1.
The lower portion of Figure 3.6 also shows two subgraphs G1 and G2 for graph G′
shown in Figure 3.5. The only connecting arc between the two subgraphs starts from

node 6 and ends at node 3. Since node 6 belongs to lower-indexed G1 and node 3
belongs to higher-indexed G2, subgraphs G1 and G2 are not ordered by precedence.
This deﬁnition can be extended to include multiple subgraphs. A collection of sub-
graphs G1,...,GM are ordered by precedence if for ℓ,k ∈{1,2,...,M} such that ℓ< k,
there does not exist a node j ∈N(Gℓ) and i ∈N(Gk) such that (j,i) ∈A(G′). Once
again, arcs that connect two subgraphs cannot originate in a subgraph with a lower in-
dex; they must always originate in a subgraph with a higher index when the subgraphs
are ordered by precedence.

Next, we deﬁne the term ordered partition. Subgraphs G1,...,GM form an ordered
partition of G′ if
1. The subgraphs G1,G2,...,GM are ordered by precedence.
2. Node subsets N(Gi), i = {1,2,...,M}, form a partition of N(G′), that is,
SM
i=1 N(Gi) = N(G′), and for any i, j ∈{1,2,...,M},N(Gi)∩N(G j) = /0 for i ̸= j.
This means that all the nodes in N(G′) are split into M different sets N(G1), N(G2),
..., N(GM) in such a way that each node is in exactly one of these sets.
In general, for a serial system, if G1,...,GM is an ordered partition, then N(GM) =
{nM−1 + 1,...,n}, N(GM−1) = {nM−2 + 1,...,nM−1}, ..., N(G1) = {1,...,n1}. Each
subgraph contains a certain number of consecutive nodes.
Finally, a directed cut of a graph G1 is an ordered partition of G1, (G−
1 ,G+
1 ). As an
example, consider the serial system in Figure 3.7. Suppose G1 with node set N(G1) =
{3,4,5,6} is a subgraph. An ordered partition of G1 = G−
1 ∪G+
1 , where the node set
of G−
1 is N(G−
1 ) = {3,4} and the node set of G+
1 is N(G+
1 ) = {5,6}. A directed cut is
just like any other ordered partition with one major distinguishing feature: the ordered
partition has only two subgraphs.
We will now proceed to solving our problem. Consider a smaller version of the
optimization problem (RP) that is deﬁned on a given subgraph Gk of the serial system:

subject to
Ti ≥Ti−1 ≥0,
(i,i−1) ∈A(Gk).
We further assume that the reorder interval for each stage in Gk is the same, that is,
Ti = T(k) for all i ∈N(Gk). Then (RPk) becomes

The above formulation is similar to that of the EOQ problem and its solution can be

How can we use the above observations? Suppose we generate an ordered parti-
tion of the serial system into M subgraphs such that the stages in a subgraph will have
the same reorder interval. Then we can use the solution to (RPk) to compute these re-
order intervals. Further, suppose these reorder intervals are feasible in the sense that
the reorder intervals are non-decreasing as we go upstream in the serial system. Will
this solution be optimal to (RP)? If yes, then how do we generate this type of ordered
partition? The answer to the ﬁrst question is a qualiﬁed yes, and we discuss it in the fol-
lowing theorem. The answer to the second question, that is, the computational approach
to generate the optimal partition, is discussed after the theorem.

(ii) T(1) ≤T(2) ≤··· ≤T(M) (feasibility), and
(iii) For any subgraph Gk, k = 1,...,M, there does not exist a directed cut (G−
k ,G+
k ) of
Gk for which
K(G−

g(G−

g(G+
k ) .
Condition (i) states that every reorder interval in the optimal solution must be equal
to the common reorder interval
p
K(Gk)/g(Gk) of some subgraph Gk in an ordered
partition. Condition (ii) is a feasibility condition that requires that the reorder intervals
satisfy the constraints in problem (RP). The most important requirement in the above
theorem is conveyed in Condition (iii) which characterizes the ordered partition that
gives us the optimal solution to (RP). According to it, if we are able to partition a
subgraph Gk further into two subgraphs (G−
k ,G+
k ) in such a way that the reorder interval
for G−
k is less than that for G+
k , then the solution will not be optimal. The solution will
be optimal if and only if we are unable to generate such a directed cut for any subgraph
in the optimal partition.
We now use this condition to design an algorithm that will give us an optimal solu-
tion to (RP).
3.2.3 Algorithm to Obtain an Optimal Solution to (RP)
Step 1: Set k = 1,i = 1. Set N(Gk) = {1}.
Step 2: Set i ←i+1. If i ≤n, go to Step 3. Otherwise, we are done.
Step 3: If K(Gk)
g(Gk) ≤Ki
gi , then k ←k + 1 and N(Gk) = {i}. Go to Step 2. Otherwise,
N(Gk) ←N(Gk)∪{i}. If k > 1, go to Step 4; otherwise, return to Step 2.
Step 4: Set l = k.
Step 5: If K(Gl−1)
g(Gl−1) ≤K(Gl)
g(Gl) , then set k = l and go to Step 2. Otherwise, go to Step 6.
Step 6: N(Gl−1) ←N(Gl−1)∪N(Gl) and l ←l −1. If l > 1, go to Step 5. Otherwise,
k = l and go to Step 2.
We will refer to this algorithm as the string algorithm.
The crucial step in the above algorithm is Step 3. In this step, we consider adding
node i to subgraph Gk. If the square of the reorder interval for stand-alone node i, Ki
gi ,
is greater than or equal to that of the subgraph Gk, K(Gk)
g(Gk) , then node i is not included
in the subgraph Gk, and it becomes the ﬁrst node in a new subgraph. This step ensures
feasibility of the reorder intervals. Since node i −1 belongs to subgraph Gk, this step
ensures that Ti ≥Ti−1. On the other hand, when Ki
gi < K(Gk)
g(Gk) , not adding node i to Gk

would violate the feasibility condition. Therefore, we add node i to Gk. However, this
changes the reorder interval for Gk, which now is lower than when i was not part of
it. As a result, the reorder interval for Gk may now become lower than that for Gk−1.
Thus, we may have to merge some of the subgraphs G1,G2,...,Gk, which we do in
Steps 4–6, to ensure that the reorder intervals remain feasible.
The following example shows an implementation of the above algorithm. The pro-
duction of an item requires it to go through ﬁve processes sequentially. The ﬁxed cost
of production at each stage is obtained by multiplying the setup time with the labor cost
per unit time. The following table contains the estimates of the ﬁxed cost of production
along with the holding cost per year.

Next, we apply the string algorithm.
Iteration 1:
Step 1: Set k = 1, i = 1, N(G1) = {1}.

25 = 0.4 and compare it with K2
g2 =

37.5 = 0.32. Since
K(G1)
g(G1) > K2
g2 , we add process 2 to N(G1). Since k = 1, we do not need to go to Step 4.
Iteration 2:
Step 2: Set i = 3.

25+37.5 = 0.352 and compare it with K3
g3 =
25
62.5 = 0.4.
Since K(G1)
g(G1) < K3
g3 , we do not add process 3 to N(G1). Instead, we create a new sub-
graph N(G2) = {3}, and set k = 2.
Iteration 3:
Step 2: Set i = 4.
Step 3: We compute K(G2)
g(G2) =
25
62.5 = 0.4 and compare it with K4
g4 =

12.5 = 0.56. Since
K(G2)
g(G2) < K4
g4 , we do not add process 4 to N(G2). Instead, we create a new subgraph
N(G3) = {4}, and set k = 3.
Iteration 4:
Step 2: Set i = 5.
Step 3: We compute K(G3)
g(G3) = 0.56 and compare it with K5
g5 =
2
12.5 = 0.16. Since
K(G3)
g(G3) > K5
g5 , we add process 5 to N(G3) and go to Step 4.
Step 4: Set l = 3.
Step 5: Recall that K(G2)
g(G2) = 0.4. Next compute K(G3)
g(G3) = K4+K5
g4+g5 = 9
25 = 0.36. Since
K(G2)
g(G2) > K(G3)
g(G3) , we go to Step 6.
Step 6: Set N(G2) = N(G2)∪N(G3) = {3,4,5}. Also, set l = 2 and go to Step 5 in
the next iteration.
Iteration 5:
Step 5: We compute K(G2)
g(G2) = K3+K4+K5
g3+g4+g5 =
34
87.5 = 0.39 and compare it with K(G1)
g(G1) =
0.352 as computed in Iteration 2. Since K(G2)
g(G2) > K(G1)
g(G1) , we set k = 2 and go to Step
2. The algorithm terminates since i+1 = 6 > n.
Therefore, the ordered partition is N(G1) = {1,2},N(G2) = {3,4,5}. The reorder
intervals that solve the relaxed problem are as follows,
T(1) =
s
K(G1)
g(G1) =

(0.35) = 0.59 years, and
T(2) =

Suppose now that we have an optimal solution to problem (RP). That is, we have an
optimal ordered partition G1,...,GM of the serial system such that the reorder intervals
for all stages in Gk are equal to T(k), k = 1,...,M. To ﬁnd the optimal PO2 solution
for the serial system, we solve the following problem for each of the subgraphs Gk,
k = 1,...,M:

Observe that the above formulation is equivalent to the single-stage problem we
examined in Section 3.1.2. Since its solution can be found using a ﬁrst differencing
approach as before, the optimal value for ℓis the smallest non-negative integer for
which

It can be shown that this solution is optimal for problem (P), which can be found in
Muckstadt and Roundy [240]. To summarize, the optimal solution to (P) can be found
using a 3-step procedure.
1. Find the optimal partition using the string algorithm.
2. Compute T(k) =
p
K(Gk)/g(Gk), the solution to (RP).
3. Find the optimal PO2 reorder interval using (3.9).
Assuming a base planning period of 1 week, let us now compute the optimal PO2
production policy for the earlier example. For subgraph G1, the optimal power-of-two
multiple 2ℓcorresponds to the smallest ℓsuch that 2ℓ≥
1

2TL T(1) =

2(1/52)(0.59) =

P = (25)(1/52) = 0.62 years.
Similarly, for subgraph G2, the optimal power-of-two multiple 2ℓcorresponds to the
smallest ℓsuch that 2ℓ≥

2TL T(2) =

2(1/52)(0.62) = 22.8. Thus, ℓ∗= 5 again and the
optimal PO2 reorder interval T ∗
P = (25)(1/52) = 0.62 years. Thus all stages will follow
the same plan in the power-of-two solution even though not all the reorder intervals
assumed the same value in the solution to the relaxed problem.

3.3 Multi-Echelon Distribution Systems
In this section, we consider a simple distribution system consisting of one central ware-
house and multiple regional warehouses. The central warehouse routinely replenishes
inventory to the regional warehouses. Assume that shipments made from the central
warehouse arrive instantaneously at the regional warehouses. The inventory at the cen-
tral warehouse is replenished by an outside supplier. The question we are interested
in answering is how often should the inventory at the regional warehouses and central
warehouse be replenished.
Suppose there are a total of n regional warehouses. Suppose further that the demand
rate at warehouse i is λi units/year, and that holding costs are charged in proportion to
echelon stock. At the central warehouse, the echelon stock is equal to the total of on-
hand stock at the central warehouse as well as at the n regional warehouses, that is, all
the inventory in the system. At a regional warehouse, the echelon stock is equal to its
on-hand stock. Let h′
i be the echelon holding cost rate for warehouse i, i = 0,1,...,n,
where 0 denotes the central warehouse. For the central warehouse, h0 = h′
0, where h0
is the conventional on-hand inventory holding cost rate. If hi is the conventional on-
hand inventory cost rate at regional warehouse i, then h′
i = hi −h0. The reason we
charge costs proportional to the echelon stock is the same as for a serial system; the
graph of echelon stock follows a saw-tooth pattern which makes it easy to compute
average inventory levels over time. A ﬁxed cost of Ki is incurred for each order placed
by warehouse i.
As we did for the serial system, we assume that the inventory management policy
is both nested and stationary. We assume that a base planning period exists, which we
denote by TL. The reorder interval at each location is a power-of-two multiple of TL
(measured in years). That is, the reorder interval at warehouse i is
Ti = 2ℓiTL,
ℓi ∈{0,1,2,... },
i = 0,...,n.
Let us now state the mathematical model and the solution algorithm.

T0 ≥Ti ≥0,
i = 1,...,n,
where gi = 1
2λih′
i. The constraint T0 ≥Ti is necessary to ensure nestedness of the policy.
As was the case for the serial system problem, this problem is also solved in a two-
step process. We ﬁrst solve a relaxation to the above problem in which we ignore the
power-of-two restriction of the base planning period. Once we ﬁnd the solution to the
relaxed problem, we use it to ﬁnd the optimal solution to (P). We will now examine the
relaxation and then show how the optimal solution to (P) can be found.

subject to

i = 1,...,n.
Since (RP) has fewer constraints than (P), the optimal cost to (RP) provides a lower
bound estimate on the objective function of (P).
Our approach to ﬁnding the solution to (RP) remains the same as for a serial sys-
tem. We want to ﬁnd an ordered partition of the graph G with node set N(G) =
{0,1,2,... ,n} and arc set A(G) = {(0,1),(0,2),... ,(0,n)}. The optimal solution to
(RP) has the following form. All the regional warehouses can be divided into two cat-
egories. The regional warehouses in the ﬁrst category share a common reorder interval
with the central warehouse. The remaining regional warehouses lie in the second cat-
egory. These warehouses follow their natural reorder intervals, that is, unconstrained
reorder intervals
q
Ki
gi .
Without any loss of generality, suppose the regional warehouses are numbered such
that K1
g1 ≤K2
g2 ≤··· ≤Kn
gn . Let C be the set of nodes corresponding to the regional ware-
houses sharing a common reorder interval with the central warehouse. If Kn
gn ≤K0
g0 , then
C = /0 and N(G) is partitioned such that N(Gi) = {i} and Ti =
q
Ki
gi , i = 0,1,...,n.
Therefore, all the warehouses follow their own reorder interval.
If C is not an empty set, let ¯i be the smallest value of i for which

(3.10)
and C = {¯i, ¯i+1,...,n}. Then the ordered partition is N(G1) = {1},...,N(G¯i−1) = {¯i−
1}, N(G¯i) = {¯i,...,n,0}. Note that C is always a subset of N(G¯i) and N(G¯i) = C∪{0}.
The formation of C is based on the following simple rule: add a node to C only when
leaving it alone would result in infeasibility. Suppose C = {j + 1,...,n} and we are
considering whether or not to add node j to C. If node j is not added to C, then the
reorder interval of the subgraph containing node 0 is equal to
T0 =
s
Kj+1 +Kj+2 +···+Kn +K0
gj+1 +gj+2 +···+gn +g0
and the reorder interval of node j would equal Tj =
q
Kj
gj . If Kj
gj were greater than
Kj+1+Kj+2+···+Kn+K0
gj+1+gj+2+···+gn+g0 , then Tj would be greater than T0 which would not be feasible. As a
result, we add node j also to C. This ensures that nodes j and 0 have the same reorder
interval thus preserving feasibility. We keep adding such nodes until we hit upon the
node ¯i which is the last node that if left alone would have a higher reorder interval than
node 0. All nodes having an index less than ¯i, that is, nodes 1,2,..., ¯i−1, have reorder
intervals that are equal to their natural reorder intervals.
We next show that the above approach results in an optimal solution by demonstrat-
ing that the resulting solution satisﬁes Theorem 3.2.
1. The subgraphs G1,G2,... form an ordered partition of G; these subgraphs must sat-
isfy two conditions to form an ordered partition of G. First, arcs connecting any two
subgraphs must start from a higher-indexed subgraph (ordering by precedence) and
the set of nodes N(G1),N(G2),...,N(G¯i) must form a partition to N(G). Regarding
the ﬁrst requirement, since arcs go only from node 0 (which is in G¯i, the highest-
indexed subgraph) to other nodes, the subgraphs are ordered by precedence. The
second requirement is fulﬁlled because S¯i
j=1 N(G j) = N(G) and each node belongs
to exactly one subgraphs’s node set.
2. The feasibility condition is satisﬁed by construction. Since the regional warehouses
are indexed such that K1
g1 ≤K2
g2 ≤··· ≤Kn
gn ,T(1) =
q
K1
g1 ≤··· ≤T(¯i −1) =
q K¯i−1
g¯i−1 .
Using (3.10), ¯i−1 is the largest-indexed warehouse that does not satisfy the inequal-
ity in (3.10). Thus,
∑n
j=¯i Kj +K0

j=¯i gj +g0

3. There is no directed cut of G¯i for which
K(G−

g(G−

K(G+

g(G+

G¯i cannot be split into two subgraphs that are ordered by precedence such that the
subgraph that does not contain 0 has a K
g -ratio (and hence the reorder interval) that
is lower than the K
g -ratio for the other subgraph. Our method of creating G¯i automat-
ically precludes such a possibility.

Let us now illustrate this solution approach. Suppose the supply chain for spare parts
of an automobile manufacturer consists of two echelons, 2 large national warehouses
and 6 regional warehouses spread all over the US. Each part is stocked in exactly one
national warehouse and in each of the 6 regional warehouses. The regional warehouses
fulﬁll the orders placed by the dealerships in their region. The regional warehouses get
their supplies for each part from the national warehouse that stocks them; the national
warehouse places orders with an external supplier who is the manufacturer.
Brake pads see steady demand throughout the year (200 per year) at each of the
regional warehouses. Given a base planning period of 1 week, let us determine the
reorder intervals for brake pads at the appropriate national warehouse and the regional
warehouses without imposing the power-of-two restriction on the reorder intervals. The
remaining data are as follows:

The new indexes of the regional warehouses are as follows: 1′ ←5, 2′ ←3, 3′ ←6,
4′ ←4, 5′ ←1, 6′ ←2.
Iteration 1:
Since K6′
g6′ > K0
g0 , C is not an empty set. Add node 6′ to C.
Iteration 2:
Next, we check if node 5′ should be added to C. Since K5′
g5′ = 0.2 > K0+K6′
g0+g6′ = 625
6200 =
0.1, we add node 5′ to C.
Iteration 3:
To check if node 4′ should be added to C, we compare K4′
g4′ = 0.19 with K0+K6′+K5′
g0+g6′+g5′ =
725
6700 = 0.108. Since .19 > .108, we add node 4′ to C.
Iteration 4:
To check if node 3′ should be added to C, we compare
K3′
g3′ = 0.13
with
K0 +K6′ +K5′ +K4′
g0 +g6′ +g5′ +g4′ = 875
7500 = 0.117.
Since .13 > .117, we add node 3′ to C.
Iteration 5:
To check if node 2′ should be added to C, we compare
K2′
g2′ = 0.11
with
K0 +K6′ +K5′ +K4′ +K3′
g0 +g6′ +g5′ +g4′ +g3′ = 965
8200 = 0.118.
Therefore, node 2′ is not added to C and ¯i = 3′. Thus, C = {3′,4′,5′,6′}. At this point,
we revert back to the original indexes. Thus, with original indexes, C = {6,4,1,2}.
The reorder intervals are
T0 = T6 = T4 = T1 = T2 =

0.118 = 0.343 years
T3 = T2′ =

warehouses accordingly such that warehouse number 1 is the one with the smallest

so on.
Step 2: Find ¯i using condition (3.10). Deﬁne C = {¯i, ¯i+1,...,n}.

3.4 Joint Replenishment Problem (JRP)
Oftentimes a supplier provides multiple products to a customer. When the customer
places an order, the supplier incurs two types of ﬁxed costs. The ﬁrst type of ﬁxed cost
is independent of the number of products ordered. This cost may arise from payment

3.4
Joint Replenishment Problem (JRP)
75
to the shipping company whose charges do not depend on the assortment of products
inside the truck. The second type of ﬁxed cost is incurred for each product shipped.
This cost may arise from postage, invoice preparation, testing upon arrival, any special
handling while unloading the product, etc. As before, both types of ﬁxed costs are
independent of the order sizes. Given that the ﬁrst type of ﬁxed cost is the same no
matter how many products are ordered, it might be economical to combine orders of
several products. Our goal in this section is to identify the ordering policy for each
product.
The graphical structure of this problem is shown in Figure 3.8. Arcs originate from
n nodes that form the ﬁrst echelon to node 0, which is the single node in the lower
echelon. Thus, we consider a two-echelon system here. Observe that the direction of
ﬂow is opposite to that of the distribution system we studied in the last section.

3.4.1 A Mathematical Model for Joint Replenishment Systems
As Figure 3.8 indicates, the sets of nodes and arcs in the system are
N(G) = {0,1,...,n},
A(G) = {(1,0),(2,0),... ,(n,0)}.

76

Power-of-Two Policies
The nodes 1,2,...,n represent different products. The purpose of the arcs is to represent
precedence; a real ﬂow of products does not occur. Whenever an order is placed by node
i, i = 1,...,n, that is, for product i, a ﬁxed cost Ki is incurred. This cost is independent
of the order quantities for any product including product i. By having arcs go from
other nodes to node 0, we ensure that the reorder interval for node 0 will not be higher
than the reorder intervals for the other nodes. Whenever an order is placed for any of
the products, an order is placed for node 0, too, and the setup cost K0 is incurred. Now,
the value added for this setup is 0 and thus h′
0 = 0. For other nodes, the annual holding
costs are charged in proportion to the echelon stock; since inventory is not held at node
0, the echelon stock at node i, i = 1,2,...,n, is equal to the on-hand stock at node i.
Finally, the demand rate for product i is λi units/year i = 1,...,n.
We again employ a nested and stationary policy in which the reorder interval for
each node is a power-of-two multiple of a base planning period. Any order for any
product i, i = 1,2,...,n, requires an order to be placed by node 0. Thus nestedness of
the ordering policy is a necessity for this system. The following is the model for the
system problem.

straints Ti = 2ℓiTL ensure a PO2 policy is followed.
Similarly to the serial system and distribution system problems, this problem is
solved in two steps. First, we construct a relaxation in which the power-of-two restric-
tion is dropped. In the second step, we use a rounding rule to establish the power-of-two
solution. The relaxed problem is

Suppose the nodes are indexed such that

If the nodes are not indexed in this way, then we must re-index them such that node 1
is the one with the smallest K
g -ratio, node 2 is the one with the second-smallest K
g -ratio,
and so on.
To obtain the optimal solution to the relaxed problem (RP), we will establish an
ordered partition of the graph in Figure 3.8 to create two categories of subgraphs. The
ﬁrst category consists of only one subgraph, which contains the nodes 0 and 1 and
possibly some other nodes from among {2,3,...,n}. All the nodes in this subgraph
have the same reorder interval. Each subgraph in the second category contains a single
node.
To obtain this ordered partition, we identify the nodes that are in the same subgraph
as node 0. Let ¯i ≥2 be the largest (sorted) index for which
∑
¯i−1

¯i−1

(3.11)
Then deﬁne C = {2,..., ¯i} and N(G1) = C ∪{0,1} = {0,1,2,... , ¯i}. Note that node 1
will always be contained in G1. Let K(G1) = ∑
¯i
j=0 Kj and g(G1) = ∑
¯i
j=1 gj. For i > ¯i,
N(Gi−¯i+1) = {i}. Then the optimal solution to the relaxed problem is
T0 = T1 = ··· = T¯i =

and
Tj =

j > ¯i.
The formation of C is based on the following simple rule: add a node to C only when
not including it in C would result in infeasibility. Suppose C = {2,3,..., j −1} and we
are considering whether or not to add node j to C. Let T j−1
0
be the reorder interval
of node 0 when C contains nodes 2,3,..., j −1. If node j is not added to C, then the
reorder interval of the subgraph containing node 0 is equal to
T j−1

K0 +K1 +···+Kj−1

and the reorder interval of node j would be equal to Tj =

g1+g2+···+gj−1 , then Tj would be less than T j−1

which would violate the feasibility
constraint. As a result, we add node j to C as well, which makes j and 0 share a common

reorder interval. We keep adding nodes until we reach node ¯i. After we add node ¯i to C,
T ¯i
0 is less than or equal to T¯i+1,T¯i+2,...,Tn.
The optimality of this solution can be checked in two ways. The ﬁrst method is by
applying Theorem 3.2 and the second method is by using the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker or
KKT conditions. Let us consider the three conditions in Theorem 3.2:
1. The subgraphs as constructed form an ordered partition of G. Arcs go from nodes
1,2,..., ¯i to node 0, which is subgraph G1. G2,G3,... consist of a single node and
no arcs. Hence the subgraphs are ordered by precedence. Furthermore, the sets of
nodes N(G1),N(G2),... form a partition to N(G) since their union is equal to N(G)
and each node is contained in exactly one such node set.
2. The feasibility condition is satisﬁed by construction. Using (3.11), ¯i+1 is the small-
est index that does not satisfy the inequality in (3.11). Thus,

3. There is no directed cut of G1 for which K(G−

g(G−

g(G+
1 ) . This condition requires that
G1 cannot be split into two ordered subgraphs such that the subgraph that contains
0 has a K
g -ratio (and hence the reorder interval) lower than the other subgraph. Our
method of creating G1 automatically precludes such a possibility.
The second approach for verifying the optimality of the solution requires evaluating
the KKT conditions at this calculated solution. Recall the formulation of the problem
(RP):

subject to
Tj ≥T0 ≥0,
j = 1,...,n.
The constraints can be equivalently written as T0 −Tj ≤0,−T0 ≤0. Let us now
write the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, where θj is the multiplier associated with
the constraint Tj−T0 ≥0 and θ0 is the multiplier associated with the constraint −T0 ≤0.

This selection is not mere speculation. We obtain θ1,θ2,...,θn from (3.15) and (3.12).
Since T0 ̸= 0, using (3.14), θ0 = 0.
We chose θj to ensure that (3.16) is satisﬁed. For the same reason, observe that
(3.12) is also satisﬁed. Next, for j = 0,1,2,..., ¯i, Tj = T0 and so (3.15) holds for these
values of j. The same equation is also satisﬁed for j = ¯i + 1,...,n, since θj = 0. By
substituting for θj in (3.17), we obtain

and
hence (3.17) is satisﬁed. Obviously, (3.13) is also satisﬁed.
Since Tj and T0 are feasible, the inequalities in (3.19) are also satisﬁed. Our ﬁnal
objective is to show that θj ≥0 for j = 1,..., ¯i. For j = 1,..., ¯i,

solution to problem (RP), we next show how to use this solution to obtain the solution
to (P).

All the nodes are indexed in the proper order so we do not need to re-index them.

Step 2: This is an iterative step in which we determine the set C. We know that C
contains at least one node, node 1.
Iteration 1:
Begin with node 2. Since the ratio K2
g2 = 2 is less than K0+K1
g1
= 6
1 = 6, add node 2
to C.
Iteration 2:
Next, we consider node 3. Once again, the ratio K3
g3 = 3 is less than K0+K1+K2
g1+g2
= 8
2 = 4,
so we also add node 3 to C.
Iteration 3:
Next, we consider node 4. The ratio K4
g4 = 6 is greater than K0+K1+K2+K3
g1+g2+g3
= 11
3 = 3.67,
so we do not add node 4 to C. Therefore, ¯i = 3, N(G1) = {0,1,2,3}, and K(G1) = 11
and g(G1) = 3.
Step 3: The optimal power-of-two value ℓ0 for nodes 0,1,2, and 3 is the smallest
non-negative integer such that 2ℓ0 ≥

In a similar way, we ﬁnd that the optimal PO2 reorder interval for node 5 is 4.92

short breaks but the surge in demand right after the break almost always makes up for it.

ﬁrst arrive in this warehouse and then are repackaged appropriately for shipment to the
store. The time to transfer material from the warehouse to the store is at most a few
hours and thus can be ignored. The ﬁxed cost of placing an order with the supplier is
$20 per order and the ﬁxed cost of transferring items from the warehouse to the store is
$10 per order. Taking the holding cost at the warehouse to be $0.30/unit/year and at the
store to be $0.50/unit/year, determine the optimal PO2 policy for placing orders with
the supplier and for transferring items to the store. Assume a base planning period of a

the echelon holding cost for each stage.

3.6. A regional retail chain receives shipments from manufacturers at its central ware-
house and in turn sends the shipments to the retail stores. Consider a miniature version
of this problem having three retail stores and a single item, ceiling lamps. The annual
demand for ceiling lamps is 100 at store 1, 80 at store 2, and 110 at store 3. The holding
cost rate at each of the stores is .20 and the cost of a ceiling lamp at the time of entering
a store is $15 per unit. This cost includes the original purchasing cost and all the value
added. The value can be added, for example, by transportation, testing, unpackaging,
etc. The holding cost rate for the central warehouse is .15 and the cost of an item at the
time it enters the warehouse is estimated to be $12. The ﬁxed cost to place an order is
$100 for the warehouse and $10 for the retail stores. Assuming a base planning period
of 2 weeks and a year consisting of 52 weeks, determine the optimal PO2 policy for
each of the retail stores and the central warehouse.
3.7. In a serial system, is it enough to constrain the reorder intervals such that Ti ≥Ti−1

3.8. A deli orders three different types of patties (vegan, tuna, and beef) from a local
manufacturer for use in sandwiches. The demand for vegan, tuna, and beef patties is 20,
30, and 125 per week, respectively. The order placement is rather easy; the store man-
ager just goes to the manufacturer and collects as many patties as he wants. Each trip
takes 30 minutes; assume the worth of the manager’s time to be $30 per hour. The store
manager, being a conscientious person, ensures that the patties are safe for consump-
tion. This takes 30 minutes per order of the vegan and tuna patties and 20 minutes per

$7 per hour. Taking the holding cost of these patties to be $0.80/patty/year, determine
the optimal PO2 replenishment policy. Assume a base planning period of a week.
3.9. Suppose the demands for each of the three products in the last problem were dou-
bled. Compute the new optimal PO2 policy.
3.10. Consider the system in Section 3.3.1. Suppose the demands in the regional ware-
houses are not identical, but are equal to 100, 125, 200, 80, 150, and 225, respectively.
Assume the ﬁxed cost and holding costs are as in the example. Determine the optimal
PO2 reorder intervals assuming the base planning period is 2 weeks.

Dynamic Lot Sizing with Deterministic Demand
To this point we have examined environments in which demand was assumed to occur at
a known, constant rate over an inﬁnite horizon. We now turn our attention to developing
a ﬁnite-horizon, discrete-time model with deterministic but non-stationary demand for
a single product at a single stage. In a ﬁnite-horizon discrete-time model, as the name
suggests, the length of the planning horizon is ﬁnite and the order placement decisions
are made at discrete intervals of time. Inventory is reviewed only at the beginning of
a period, hence we can call this model a periodic review model. Backorders are not
permitted.
There are three types of costs considered in this environment, the ﬁxed ordering cost,
were no ﬁxed cost, it would be optimal to place an order in every period. The ﬁxed
cost provides an economic incentive to combine several periods’ demands into a single
order. The variable procurement cost is also incurred only when an order is placed. The
magnitude of this cost is proportional to the order quantity. Unlike the ﬁxed and variable
costs of order placement, the holding cost is not incurred when an order is placed. The
holding cost is charged every period in proportion to the amount of on-hand inventory
at a period’s end.
We will present three ways to solve this type of problem. The ﬁrst method is called
the Wagner–Whitin [360] algorithm. The second approach is called the Wagelmans–
Hoesel–Kolen [357] algorithm. Both of these methods will ﬁnd an optimal solution.
While these two algorithms produce an optimal solution, they do differ in the computa-
tional complexity required to compute the optimal procurement plan. The Wagner–
Whitin algorithm may require a number of calculations proportional to T 2, where
T is the length of the planning horizon. For a general planning environment, the
Wagelmans–Hoesel–Kolen algorithm requires calculations proportional to T logT. For
the assumptions on which the dynamic lot sizing problem is based, the latter algorithm

Dynamic Lot Sizing with Deterministic Demand
requires calculations that are only proportional to T. Hence the second method is more
efﬁcient in ﬁnding the optimal solution. It is important to understand that not all algo-
rithms are equally efﬁcient. Efﬁcient implementation in ongoing operations is essential
to effective management of inventory. The third way is to employ a heuristic method to
create a procurement plan. We will describe two such heuristics. The ﬁrst is called the
Silver–Meal heuristic and the second is called the least unit cost heuristic. Both heuris-
tics are order T methods for computing a procurement plan. Although these approaches
are very simple to implement, they do not necessarily obtain an optimal solution. We
note that the Wagner–Whitin algorithm was the ﬁrst approach in the literature to solve
this lot sizing problem to optimality.
We begin by discussing the Wagner–Whitin algorithm. We will then present the
Wagelmans–Hoesel–Kolen algorithm and then discuss the two heuristics.
4.1 The Wagner–Whitin (WW) Algorithm
The notation and the remaining assumptions for the model are as follows. Denote the
ﬁxed ordering cost and the holding cost in period t by Kt and ht, respectively. In general,
the Wagner–Whitin analysis applies to more general cases than we will discuss. Specif-
ically, if Ct is the per-unit purchasing cost, then the analysis requires that Ct +ht ≥Ct+1
for all t. For simplicity we will assume that these parameters are stationary over time.
Consequently, Ct ≡C, Kt ≡K, and ht ≡h for any period t, t = 1,...,T. It is not nec-
essary for all the periods to be of equal length even though that is often the case in the
real world. When periods vary in length, the values of ht would likely vary, too. We
denote the known deterministic demand in period t by dt. We use xt to represent the
inventory at the beginning of period t before the order-placement decision is made. We
also assume that the lead time is zero to simplify the discussion.
We use yt to denote the on-hand inventory after the order-placement decision is
made and the order is received. Equivalently, yt is equal to the sum of xt and the order
quantity. Because the order size is nonnegative, yt is always greater than or equal to xt.
If an order is placed in period t, yt is strictly greater than xt, that is, yt > xt. Otherwise,
when no order is placed in period t, yt is equal to xt. Also, yt must be large enough to
satisfy the demand in period t since backorders are not allowed.
The events in any period are as follows. At the beginning of the period, it is decided
whether or not to place an order. If an order is placed, ﬁxed and variable purchase
costs are incurred. Since the lead time is zero, the order is received immediately. The
demand is realized through the rest of the period. At the end of the period, a holding
cost is charged in proportion to the amount of remaining on-hand inventory.

4.1
The Wagner–Whitin (WW) Algorithm
87
We next develop an expression for the cost in a generic period t. The ﬁxed cost is
equal to K if yt > xt; otherwise it is 0. Equivalently, we can write the ﬁxed cost as K ·δt
where
δt =
 1, yt > xt,
0, otherwise.
The purchasing cost is equal to the product of the unit purchasing cost C and the order
quantity yt −xt. Finally, the leftover inventory at the end of period t is yt −dt, and the
corresponding holding cost is h(yt −dt). Combining the three terms, we obtain the total
cost in period t as
Kδt +C(yt −xt)+h(yt −dt).
The cumulative cost over the whole horizon is equal to
T
∑
t=1
{Kδt +C(yt −xt)+h(yt −dt)}.
We also impose two types of constraints. Since the order quantity is non-negative, yt
must be greater than or equal to xt in any period t. To ensure that there is no backlogging,
yt ≥dt.
Let Z1(x1) be the optimal cost for the whole horizon given that the inventory at the
beginning of the horizon is x1. The complete formulation of the dynamic lot sizing
problem is as follows:
Z1(x1) = min
T
∑
t=1
{Kδt +C(yt −xt)+h(yt −dt)}
subject to
y1 ≥x1, y2 ≥x2,..., yT ≥xT,
y1 ≥d1, y2 ≥d2,..., yT ≥dT,
where
xt+1 = yt −dt,
t = 1,2,...,T.
The cumulative variable purchasing cost
T
∑
t=1
C(yt −xt) is independent of the decision
variables, y1,y2,...,yT. The sum total of the order quantities over the horizon is
T
∑
t=1
(yt −xt) = (y1 −x1)+(y2 −x2)+···+(yT−1 −xT−1)+(yT −xT).

Dynamic Lot Sizing with Deterministic Demand
Using the relationship, xt+1 = yt −dt, we can substitute for y1 with x2 + d1, y2 with
x3 +d2, and, in general, yt with xt+1 +dt in the above expression. After the substitution,
the above expression becomes
T
∑
t=1
(yt −xt) = (x2 +d1 −x1)+(x3 +d2 −x2)+···
+ (xT +dT−1 −xT−1)+(xT+1 +dT −xT),
which simpliﬁes to
T
∑
t=1
(yt −xt) = d1 +d2 +···+dT −x1 +xT+1.
(4.1)
Observe that all the terms on the right-hand side except xT+1 are constant and thus
independent of the decision variables. The term xT+1 is the inventory remaining at the
end of the horizon. This inventory is unutilized and is wasted. Therefore, in any optimal
policy, xT+1 must be equal to zero. This implies that the cumulative order quantity over
the horizon is independent of the decision variables. Since the total purchasing cost
over the horizon is equal to the product of this cumulative order quantity and a constant
C, the variable cost of order placement is also independent of the decision variables.
Therefore, we exclude it from the cost function. The revised formulation is as follows:
Z1(x1) = min
T
∑
t=1
{Kδt +h(yt −dt)}
subject to
y1 ≥x1, y2 ≥x2,..., yT ≥xT,
y1 ≥d1, y2 ≥d2,..., yT ≥dT,
where
xt+1 = yt −dt, xt+1 ≥0,
t = 1,2,...,T −1, xT+1 = 0.
Having developed the model, we now proceed to solving it. We develop the founda-
tion for the algorithm in the following subsection.

The Wagner–Whitin (WW) Algorithm

4.1.1 Solution Approach
Given the inventory level xt at the beginning of period t, let the optimal cost for period
t and onwards through the end of the horizon be denoted by Zt(xt). Then
Zt(xt) = min
T
∑
k=t
(Kδk +h(yk −dk))
subject to
yt ≥xt,..., yT ≥xT,
xt+1 = yt −dt,..., xT = yT−1 −dT−1,xT+1 = 0,
xj ≥0, j = t +1,...,T.
Equivalently, Zt(xt) is equal to the sum of the optimal cost incurred in period t,
Kδt +h(yt −dt), and the cost incurred over periods t +1 through the end of the horizon.
The inventory at the beginning of period t +1 is equal to yt −dt and so the optimal cost
for periods t +1 onwards is equal to Zt+1(yt −dt). Formally,
Zt(xt) =
min
yt≥xt,yt≥dt Kδt +h(yt −dt)+Zt+1(yt −dt).
For ease of discussion, we assume that the inventory at the beginning of the horizon
x1 is equal to zero. It is easy to convert a problem with x1 ̸= 0 to a problem with x1 = 0.
Just change the demand in the ﬁrst period to d1−x1, that is, d1 ←d1−x1, assuming d1 ≥
x1. Thus, the ﬁrst period demand is reduced by x1 units. The new ﬁrst period demand is
the actual demand that we have to fulﬁll through the order placement. If d1 < x1, then
ﬁnd the ﬁrst period j > 1 for which ∑j
t=1 dt > x1. Set dt = 0 for t = 1,2,..., j −1 and
dj ←∑j
t=1 dt −x1.
We next obtain some insights regarding the optimal solution. To illustrate the ﬁrst
idea, consider an example with T = 5. The following table provides the demand data
and an order policy.

Observe that the order placed in period 3 is larger than the demand in period 3 but is not
large enough to cover the demand of period 4. The costs incurred in periods 3 and 4 are

90

Dynamic Lot Sizing with Deterministic Demand
K + 15h and K, respectively. Suppose we tweak the above policy such that everything
remains the same except for the order quantities in periods 3 and 4. Suppose we reduce
the order quantity in period 3 by 15 units and increase the order quantity in period 4
by 15 to 45 units. The cost of the tweaked policy in period 3 is K which is lower than
before. The cost incurred in other periods including period 4 remains the same. As a
result, the revised policy has a lower overall cost.
The major characteristic of the revised policy is that whenever an order is placed, the
quantity ordered is equal to the total demand over some number of future time periods.
In the example, the order quantity in period 1 is equal to the sum of demands of the
ﬁrst two periods. The lower cost of the tweaked policy is not fortuitous. In general if an
order satisﬁes a future period’s demand only partially, it can be tweaked to reduce the
overall costs.
The above discussion implies that in any period at least one of the two variables,
the order quantity and the beginning of the period inventory, is zero. Equivalently, the
product of the order quantity and the inventory at the beginning of the period is zero in
any period. We state this observation formally in the following theorem.
Theorem 4.1. In any optimal policy, xt(yt −xt) = 0 for t = 1,2,...,T.
The example also illustrates the fact that the order quantity in any period is equal to
the sum of the demands of a certain number of future periods.
Theorem 4.1 can also be used to show the following result.
Proposition 4.1. Suppose period t’s demand is satisﬁed by an order placed in period j,
j < t, in an optimal policy. Then the demands of periods j +1, j +2,...,t −1 are also
satisﬁed by the same order.
Proposition 4.1 builds on Theorem 4.1 and tells us that not only the order size must
equal the total demands over some number of future periods, but also that the demands
should occur in consecutive periods. For example, it rules out placing an order in period
t to satisfy the demands of periods t and t +2 and placing another order in period t +1 to
satisfy its demand in that period. Clearly, such a policy will be a violation of Proposition
4.1. Therefore, if an order is placed in period t, then yt = dt +dt+1 +···+dk−1 +dk for
some k ≥t.
Suppose now that by some magic we discover that the beginning inventory in period
t +1, xt+1, is equal to 0 in an optimal policy. In that case, do the ordering decisions made
in periods 1,2,...,t affect the cost and ordering decisions in periods t +1,t +2,...,T?
The answer is no. The reason is that the ordering decisions made in one period inﬂuence
future decisions through the inventory that is carried into these periods. For example,
if a large order is placed in a period, then there will be no need to place an order over
the several subsequent periods. Furthermore, the holding cost incurred over the next

4.1
The Wagner–Whitin (WW) Algorithm
91
several periods will be large owing to the amount of inventory being carried. When no
inventory is carried from period t to period t + 1, there is no effect of the decisions
made in periods up through t on the cost and ordering decisions made in period t + 1
and beyond.
We make use of the above observation when designing a solution algorithm. For
every period t, we will assume that the inventory at its end (or the beginning of the next
period t +1) is zero. Thus, we consider a t-period problem. This absolves us of all the
future responsibility and we can focus on periods 1,2,...,t −1,t to determine when
to place an order to satisfy period t’s demand. It gets even simpler than this. Suppose
we ﬁnd that the demand for period t −1 is satisﬁed by an order placed in period v in
the optimal solution to the t −1-period problem. That is, yv = dv + dv+1 + ··· + dt−1
in the t −1-period problem’s solution. Then the order that optimally satisﬁes period
t’s demand in the t-period problem must be placed in period v or later. See Subsection
4.1.4 for the technical details.
Before we outline the steps of the algorithm, let us understand the cost computa-
tions. Deﬁne F(t) to be the optimal cost from period 1 through period t when inventory
at the end of period t is zero. Also, deﬁne Cs
t to be the minimum cost over periods 1
through t when the inventory level at the end of period t is zero and period t’s demand
is satisﬁed by an order placed in period s. Cs
t can be written as the sum of the minimum
costs incurred over periods 1 through s −1 and periods s through t when xs = 0 and
ys = ∑t
j=s dj. The optimal cost over periods 1 through s −1 is equal to F(s −1). The
cost incurred between periods s and t includes the ﬁxed cost incurred in period s and the
holding costs incurred in periods s,s + 1,...,t. The holding cost in period s is propor-
tional to the inventory at the end of period s, which is equal to the sum of the demands
in periods s+1,s+2,...,t. Similarly, the holding cost in period s+1 is proportional to
the inventory carried forward to period s+2 which is equal to the sum of the demands
in periods s + 2,s+ 3,...,t. Since inventory at the end of period t is assumed to be 0,
no holding cost is incurred in period t. Therefore, the total cost incurred in periods s
through t is equal to
K +h(ds+1 +ds+2 +···+dt)+h(ds+2 +ds+3 +···+dt)+···+h(dt).
(4.2)
We can now write an expression for Cs
t by adding F(s−1) to (4.2):
Cs
t = F(s−1)+K +h(ds+1 +ds+2 +···+dt)+h(ds+2 +ds+3 +···+dt)
+··· +h(dt).
(4.3)
As noted, if period t −1’s demand is optimally satisﬁed by an order placed in period
v in the t −1-period problem, then it is sufﬁcient to consider periods v,v + 1,...,t as
periods in which to optimally place an order to satisfy period t’s demand in a t-period

92

Dynamic Lot Sizing with Deterministic Demand
problem. For each of these choices, we can compute the minimum cost over periods 1
through t. Hence, when period t −1’s demand is satisﬁed in period v in a t −1-period
problem, the optimal cost over periods 1 through t, F(t), is
F(t) = min{Cv
t ,Cv+1
t
,...,Ct−1
t
,Ct
t}.
We are now prepared to state the Wagner–Whitin algorithm.
4.1.2 Algorithm
The steps of the algorithm are as follows.
Step 1: Set t = 2, v = 1 and F(1) = K.
Step 2: Since an order is placed in period 1, we need to determine whether to place
an order in period 1 or in period 2 to satisfy period 2’s demand. When the order is
placed in period 2, the total cost is F(1)+K2 = K1 +K2 since no inventory is carried
into period 2. When the order placed in period 1 is for d1 +d2 units, the total cost is
C1
2 = F(1)+hd2 = K1 +hd2. Choose the decision with the least total cost for periods
1 and 2. That is,
F(2) = min{K1 +K2,K1 +hd2.}
Set v = 2 if K1 +K2 < K1 +hd2. Otherwise, v remains unchanged.
Step 3: Consider the t-period problem. Given v, the demand for period t is sat-
isﬁed by placing the order in one of the periods v,v + 1,v + 2,...,t. Compute
Cv
t ,Cv+1
t
,...,Ct−1
t
,Ct
t using (4.3) and ﬁnd
F(t) = min{Cv
t ,Cv+1
t
,...,Ct−1
t
,Ct
t}.
Choose to place the order in the period with the lowest cost. Set a new value of v
accordingly.
Step 4: Set t ←t +1. Stop if t = T +1. Otherwise, go to Step 3.
We illustrate the algorithm using the following example.
Consider an inventory system for a product whose life-cycle permits placement of
ﬁve orders, that is, the length of the planning horizon is ﬁve periods. Whenever an order
is placed, a ﬁxed cost K = $100 is incurred. The holding cost for any period t is equal
to h =$ 1/unit/period. The projected demands are as follows: d1 = 10, d2 = 60, d3 = 15,
d4 = 150, d5 = 110.
The algorithm proceeds as follows.

4.1
The Wagner–Whitin (WW) Algorithm
93
Iteration 1:
Step 1: We set t = 2 and v = 1. Since an order is placed in period 1, F(1) = K.
Step 2: C1
2 = K+hd2 = 100+(1)(60) = 160 and C2
2 = F(1)+K = 200. Thus, F(2) =
min{C1
2,C2
2} = 160 and the order is tentatively placed in period 1 to meet the demand
for both periods. We continue to have v = 1.
Step 3: We next compute C1
3,C2
3, and C3
3.
C1
3 = K +h(d2 +d3)+hd3 = 100+1(60+15)+1(15) = 190,
C2
3 = F(1)+K +hd3 = 100+100+1(15) = 215,
C3
3 = F(2)+K = 160+100 = 260.
Therefore, F(3) = 190 and the order is tentatively placed in period 1 to meet the
demand for the ﬁrst three periods. The value of v remains unchanged at 1.
Step 4: Since t < 5, we go to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
Step 3: We compute C1
4,C2
4,C3
4, and C4
4 as follows:
C1
4 = K +h(d2 +d3 +d4)+h(d3 +d4)+h(d4) = 640,
C2
4 = F(1)+K +h(d3 +d4)+h(d4) = 515,
C3
4 = F(2)+K +h(d4) = 410,
C4
4 = F(3)+K = 290.
Hence F(4) = 290, and we produce in period 4 to meet period 4’s demand. Set v = 4.
Step 4: Since t < 5, we perform one more iteration.
Iteration 3:
Step 3: We need to compute only C4
5 and C5
5.
C4
5 = F(3)+K +h(d5) = 400
C5
5 = F(4)+K = 390
Thus we order in period 5 to meet period 5’s demand.
Step 4: We stop since all the periods have been covered.
The solution to this problem is to produce 85 units in period 1, 150 units in period
4, and 110 units in period 5.

The dynamic lot sizing problem can also be represented as a shortest-path network
ﬂow problem. In the following subsection, we demonstrate the formulation for such a
representation.
4.1.3 Shortest-Path Representation of the Dynamic Lot Sizing Problem
In a shortest-path network ﬂow problem, the objective is to identify a shortest path from
the source to the destination. There are several intermediate nodes between the source
and destination nodes. If a route exists between two nodes, it is indicated by a directed
arc; thus the network is a directed graph. The path between the source and destination is
a combination of such arcs. There is a cost corresponding to each arc/route. The shortest
path is the one with the minimum total cost.
A dynamic lot sizing problem is represented using a graph having T + 1 stages.
Node 1 is the source and node T +1 is the destination. From each node t, an arc goes to
all the downstream nodes, that is, to nodes t + 1,t + 2,...,T + 1. Thus, the number of
arcs that leave node t is equal to T +1−t. Similarly, arcs come into node t from nodes
1,2,...,t −1. An arc (s,t) represents an order placed in period s to satisfy the demands
of periods s,s+1,...,t −1. For example, an arc that connects nodes 1 and 3 represents
an order placed in period 1 to satisfy the demands of periods 1 and 2.
The cost cs,t of an arc (s,t) is equal to the ﬁxed ordering and holding costs incurred
in periods s through t −1. The costs incurred in periods s through t −1 are
cs,t = K +h(ds+1 +ds+2 +···+dt−1)+h(ds+2 +ds+3 +···+dt−1)+···+hdt−1,
which can be written equivalently as
cs,t = K +h
t−1
∑
k=s+1

∑

Let ys,t ∈{0,1} be a binary variable corresponding to arc (s,t). If ys,t = 1 in a solu-
tion, the arc (s,t) is part of the shortest path in that solution. When ys,t = 0 in a solution,
no order is placed in period s.
The complete formulation is as follows:

Observe that to solve this shortest path problem, all values of cs,t must be computed
in advance. Note that all these calculations are not required when solving the lot sizing
problem using the Wagner–Whitin approach; refer to the table in the example found in
Subsection 4.1.2. For example, to solve the shortest path problem, we would have to
compute the costs c1,5,c2,5, and c3,5 in the example, which were not computed when
using the Wagner–Whitin algorithm. Hence, the dynamic programming approach that
underlies the Wagner–Whitin algorithm is a more efﬁcient way to solve the lot sizing
problem.
4.1.4 Technical Appendix for the Wagner–Whitin Algorithm
The goal of this subsection is to provide certain technical details for the Wagner–Whitin
algorithm. Again assume that Ct +ht ≥Ct+1 for all t.
Previously, we stated that if xt+1 = 0 in the optimal solution, then the ordering de-
cisions made prior to period t +1 do not affect the ordering decisions made in periods
t +1 through T. Recall that we deﬁned F(t) as the optimal cost of running the system
from periods 1 through t such that xt+1 = 0. Suppose period t’s demand is satisﬁed by
an order placed in period j∗(t) in the t-period problem. The following theorem states
that j∗(t +1) cannot be less than j∗(t).

96
4
Dynamic Lot Sizing with Deterministic Demand
Theorem 4.2. (Planning Horizon Theorem) Suppose in the t-period problem, period
t’s demand is satisﬁed by an order placed in period j∗(t) in an optimal solution. Then
there exists an optimal solution for the t + 1-period problem in which period t + 1’s
demand is satisﬁed by an order placed in period j∗(t +1) such that j∗(t +1) ≥j∗(t).
How is the above theorem useful in developing the solution algorithm? In the al-
gorithm, the iterations are indexed by time t. Thus, in each iteration, we consider a
t-period problem. We assume that xt+1 = 0 in the optimal solution. Given this assump-
tion, we identify the period in which an order is placed to satisfy period t’s demand,
that is, j∗(t). In the subsequent iteration, we consider a t +1-period problem. By virtue
of the planning horizon theorem, we need to consider only j∗(t), j∗(t)+1,...,t +1 (as
opposed to all the prior periods) as possible periods in which an order could be placed
to satisfy period t + 1’s demand. This observation may result in making substantially
fewer calculations.
4.2 Wagelmans–Hoesel–Kolen (WHK) Algorithm
Recall that the Wagner–Whitin algorithm is based on a forward in time dynamic pro-
gramming recursion. That is, we ﬁrst consider a limited version of the problem consist-
ing only of the ﬁrst period while ignoring the rest of the periods in the horizon. Then we
expand the problem to include period 2. Once again, we ignore the remaining periods
and just solve the two-period problem. In general, we go forward gradually and include
one additional period at a time.
An alternative to this procedure is to go backwards. That is, ﬁrst consider only the
Tth period and ignore periods 1 through T −1. Then we go backwards and include
period T −1 as well. In general, we iteratively add one additional period at a time and
solve the resulting problem.
As we stated earlier, the advantage of the WHK algorithm is that its worst-case
computational performance is better than that of the WW algorithm. Whereas the WW
algorithm’s worst-case performance in terms of computational time is of the order of
T 2, this algorithm’s worst-case computational time is of the order of T logT for prob-
lems with time varying ordering and holding costs. When these costs are stationary, the
worst-case computational time is of the order of T. Note that this does not mean that this
algorithm will always perform better than the WW algorithm. The algorithm may not
perform better even in terms of the average time taken when the two algorithms are run
for a certain number of data instances. That WHK has better worst-case performance
means that for large values of T, this algorithm will outperform the WW algorithm from
a computational perspective. Remember, both algorithms ﬁnd the optimal solution.

4.2
Wagelmans–Hoesel–Kolen (WHK) Algorithm
97
The outline for this section is as follows. First, we develop other formulations for
the dynamic lot sizing problem. Then, we discuss the general approach behind the al-
gorithm. Finally, we present the algorithm in detail for the stationary cost case and
illustrate its steps with an example.
4.2.1 Model Formulation
Recall that when we discussed the Wagner–Whitin model and algorithm we let xt rep-
resent the number of units of on-hand inventory at the beginning of period t prior to
placing an order and yt represent the on-hand inventory following the placement of an
order in period t. We assumed that the lead time was zero in length. Furthermore, we let
zt = yt −xt, which equals the amount ordered in period t. We also let Kt, ht, dt, and C
represent the ﬁxed ordering cost, per-unit holding cost, demand, and per-unit purchase
cost in period t.
Then the dynamic lot sizing problem is

implies that the total supply must be at least as large as total demand through the end
of each period. The second constraint implies that the amount purchased in a period
cannot exceed the total demand in that and future periods in the planning horizon.
Now let ft = ∑T

timization process. Also, ∑T

Next, let zti be the amount of period i’s demand that is produced in period t. Then zt =

To simplify our discussion, let us assume that dt > 0 for all t, t = 1,...,T. Let us
deﬁne Zt to be the cost of following an optimal policy over a horizon consisting of
periods t through T when xt = 0. Deﬁne ZT+1 = 0.
Since zt ∈

(4.6)
Recursion (4.6) states that we procure an amount in period t to satisfy demands through
the end of period s −1 and then follow an optimal strategy thereafter. Thus we begin
with t = T and compute ZT. Next, we determine ZT−1 using the value of ZT. Using
(4.6) we continue the process until we ﬁnd Z1 and an optimal procurement plan.
The recursion that we have described for computing Zt requires comparing T −t +1
expressions. If this process is executed in the usual manner, then the recursion results
in an order T 2 algorithm, essentially the same as is required to carry out the steps of the
Wagner–Whitin algorithm. However, as we will now discuss, we can calculate (4.6) in
order T logT time rather than order T 2 time.
Let us deﬁne the notion of an efﬁcient period. As we will see, efﬁcient periods are
important in the sense that in a t-period problem, the next order after period t can
be placed only in one of these efﬁcient periods. Suppose t = 4 and T = 8 and periods
5 and 7 are efﬁcient periods.
Then the next order after pe-
riod 4 can only be placed
in either period 5 or 7 but
not in periods 6, 8 or 9
(an order in period 9 means
no order is placed after pe-
riod 4 until the end of the
horizon). Thus, the number
of periods that we have to
consider when determining
the next period in which a
procurement order is placed
is reduced when knowing
what periods are efﬁcient pe-
riods.
Fig. 4.1. Optimal costs of t-period problems (Zt) as a function
of cumulative demand computed backwards.
We now show how to determine efﬁcient periods graphically. Suppose we know
Zt+1,Zt+2,...,ZT. Suppose we plot these values in a graph against cumulative demands
computed backwards. That is, we plot the points (0,0) = (0,ZT+1),(dT ,ZT),(dT +
dT−1,ZT−1),...,(dT +dT−1 +··· +dt+1,Zt+1). Figure 4.1 shows a sample plot. Think

of these points as pins on the graph. Suppose we now take a cord and wrap it around
the pins so that all the pins are above the cord and the cord is not slack. Efﬁcient
periods correspond to the pins that touch the cord. For instance, if a pin correspond-
ing to the point (dT,ZT) touches the cord, then period T is efﬁcient. Points (0,0) and
(dT + dT−1 + ··· + dt+1,Zt+1), being endpoints, are always touched by the cord. If we
now draw a curve that imitates the cord, then this curve is called the lower convex
envelope or the greatest convex minorant of the curve.
Suppose we have identiﬁed the efﬁcient periods. Let st be the optimal value for s
in (4.6), that is, the next period in which an order will be placed following period t.
Observe that the lower convex envelope is a piecewise linear function. Between two
consecutive efﬁcient periods k and l, k < l, its slope is equal to
Zk−Zl
dk+dk+1+···+dl−1. In ad-
dition, this slope is increasing as we move to the right. The value st in (4.6) is equal to
the smallest efﬁcient period k such that
Zk −Zl
dk +dk+1 +···+dl−1
>
T
∑
j=t
hj = ft .
(4.7)
That is, st is the left endpoint of the last segment (as we go right) in the lower convex
envelope whose slope is greater than ft. With st known, we can compute Zt.
Observe that the right-hand side of inequality (4.7) increases as t decreases. This
means that the slope of the segment that determined st+1 may not satisfy the inequality
for the t-period problem. Therefore, st ≤st+1. This observation is helpful because when
we search for st we need only consider efﬁcient periods from t +1 through st+1.
We now discuss how to determine efﬁcient periods algebraically. For the t-period
problem, clearly period t is an efﬁcient period. It turns out that other efﬁcient periods
for the t-period problem form a subset of efﬁcient periods for the problem beginning
in period t +1. In other words, to search for the efﬁcient periods for the t-period prob-
lem, it sufﬁces to consider the set of efﬁcient periods for the (t + 1)-period problem.
Furthermore, only a certain number of consecutive periods that lie adjacent to t cease
to be efﬁcient as we go from the problem beginning in period t + 1 to the problem
beginning in period t. More precisely, if t + 1 = t1 < t2 < ··· < tr < ··· < tn = T + 1
are the efﬁcient periods for the (t +1)-period problem, then the set of efﬁcient periods
for the t-period problem will consist of all of these periods (plus period t, of course)
except t1,t2,...,tr−1 for some r. It is possible that all the periods that are efﬁcient in the
(t +1)-period problem continue to remain efﬁcient for the t-period problem.
Suppose tr is the smallest period such that
Zt −Ztr
dt +dt+1 +···+dtr−1
>
Ztr −Ztr+1
dtr +dtr+1 +···+dtr+1−1
.
(4.8)

4.2

Then periods t1,t2,...,tr−1 cease to be efﬁcient as we go from the (t +1)-period prob-
lem to the t-period problem. If the above inequality holds for t1, then all the efﬁcient
periods for the (t + 1)-period problem remain efﬁcient for the t-period problem. An-
other important fact that we state without proof is that tr ≤st+1. This fact reduces the
number of efﬁcient periods that we need to consider to determine tr.
Why is it that some pe-
riods cease to be efﬁcient
when we consider the t-
period problem? Recall how
we generated the efﬁcient
periods by wrapping a cord
around the pins. Suppose we
have the pins that correspond
to periods t + 1 through T +
1 and we add another point
(dt + dt+1 + ··· + dT,Zt). If
we wrap the cord around
the pins once again, we now
have to include the pin corre-
sponding to period t. But in
Fig. 4.2. Elimination of some efﬁcient periods as we include
period t.
doing so, as Figure 4.2 shows, some of the points that were touching the cord earlier do
not do so anymore. Consequently, they are not part of the new lower convex envelope
and are no longer efﬁcient.
We now describe an iterative procedure based on these observations. The algorithm
is described and illustrated with an example in the following subsection.
Before we present the details of the WHS algorithm let us discuss why it can be
executed in the order of T logT time. Clearly ft, Kt and ∑T
i=t di = ∑T
i=t+1 di + dt, t =
1,...,T, can be found in time proportional to T.
In each of the T iterations of the algorithm we will calculate Zt, t = 1,...,T. The
value of Zt is found during iteration T −t +1 since the algorithm is initiated with t = T.
Let S be an ordered list of the efﬁcient points at the time iteration T −t +1 is executed.
Then the value of tr that satisﬁes (4.8) can be found using a binary search on S, which
can be accomplished in the order of logT time. In each iteration, some efﬁcient periods
in S at the beginning of the iteration may need to be removed from S. That is, they are
no longer efﬁcient periods when the next iteration is executed. Each period can only
be removed from the set of efﬁcient periods once. Furthermore, at each comparison in
an iteration we either conclude that we have found tr or we move to the next period
considered in the order list S and continue the binary search. Each such calculation is
made for each of the T periods in the planning horizon. Combining these observations,
we see that the total complexity associated with calculating Z1 is of the order of T logT.

Let us focus on a special case when ht = h. Then ft = (T −t + 1)h and therefore
ft > ft+1 > ··· > fT. In this case, the algorithm, which we will state shortly, can be
solved in linear time. In fact, this occurs in general when f1 ≥f2 ≥··· ≥fT. This is the
case for the Wagner–Whitin model. This occurs because the binary search process can
be replaced by a search that requires only a number of comparisons that in total is of
the order of T.
4.2.3 Algorithm
We will now state the algorithm for solving the economic lot size problem in order T
time. We assume that the elements of S are ordered from smallest to largest, where S is
the set of efﬁcient periods.
Step 0: Let S = {T,T +1}, t = T, sT = T +1, ZT+1 = 0, and compute ZT = K +hdT.
Step 1: t = t −1. If t = 0, go to Step 4; otherwise, go to Step 2.
Step 2: Find the smallest k ∈S, k ≤st+1, such that
Zk −Zl
dk +···+dl−1
< (T −t +1)h,
where l is the next largest efﬁcient period exceeding k. Set st = k.
Given k, compute Zt = K +(T −t +1)h∑k−1
i=t di +Zk.
Step 3: Let S =

t1,...,tq
	
, t1 < t2 < ··· < tq, be the set of efﬁcient periods. Let
tr ∈S, tr < st, be the smallest efﬁcient period for which
Zt −Ztr

i=t di

∑tr+1−1

if one exists.
Let S = {t}∪(S\{t1,...,tr−1}), the new set of efﬁcient periods.
Return to Step 1.
Step 4: Compute the procurement policy:
(a) Set t = 1
(b) zt = ∑st−1
i=t di
(c) Set t = st and go to Step 4(b)
Let us now illustrate the workings of the above algorithm using the data from the
example in Section 4.1.2.

Wagelmans–Hoesel–Kolen (WHK) Algorithm
103
Iteration 1:
Step 0: S = {5,6}, t = 5, s5 = 6, Z6 = 0, and Z5 = 100+(1)(110) = 210.
Step 1: t = 4. Since t > 0, go to Step 2.
Step 2: s4 must be either 5 or 6. (If it were 5, then a procurement order for d4 units
would be placed in period 4; otherwise, d4 +d5 units would be ordered.) Begin with
k = 5. Since Z5−Z6
d5
= 210
110 = 1.91 < 2 = (5 −4 + 1)(1), s4 = 5. Z4 = K + (T −t +
1)hd4 +Z5 = 100+300+210 = 610.
Step 3: Because s4 = 5, no elements of S will be dropped. S = {4}∪{5,6} = {4,5,6}.
Return to Step 1.
Iteration 2:
Step 1: t = 3 > 0, so go to Step 2.
Step 2: Since s4 = 5, we need only consider efﬁcient periods 4 and 5 when computing
s3. With k = 4, Z4−Z5
d4
= 2.67 < 3 and therefore s3 = 4. Furthermore, Z3 = K +(T −
t +1)hd3 +Z4 = 755.
Step 3: Since s3 = 4, S = {3}∪{4,5,6} = {3,4,5,6}. Return to Step 1.
Iteration 3:
Step 1: t = 2 > 0, and thus go to Step 2.
Step 2: Because s3 = 4, we only consider efﬁcient periods 3 and 4 when ﬁnding s2.
We begin with k = 3. Since Z3−Z4
d3
= 9.67 > 4, s2 ̸= 3 and hence s2 = 4, the only
alternative. Z2 = K +(T −t +1)h(d2 +d3) = 1010.
Step 3: Since s2 = 4, we need only consider tr = 3 for elimination from S. Because
Z2−Z3
d2
= 4.25 < 9.67 = Z3−Z4
d3
, period 3 is removed from S. After adding period 2 to
S, S = {2,4,5,6}. Return to Step 1.
Iteration 4:
Step 1: t = 1 > 0, and hence go to Step 2.
Step 2: Because s2 = 4, we must consider only efﬁcient periods 2 and 4 when ﬁnding
s1. But when k = 2, Z2−Z4
d2+d3 = 5.33 > 5 and therefore s1 ̸= 2. Consequently s1 = 4 and
Z1 = K +(T −t +1)h(d1 +d2 +d3)+Z4 = 1135.
Step 3: Period 2 is eliminated from S and {1} is added to S. Hence, S = {1,4,5,6}.
Return to Step 1.
Iteration 5:
Step 1: Since t = 0, go to Step 4.

104

Dynamic Lot Sizing with Deterministic Demand
Step 4: Set t = 1. Since s1 = 4, z1 = d1 +d2 +d3 = 85. Next, set t = s1 = 4. Because
s4 = 5, z4 = 150 = d4. Lastly z5 = 110.
The example demonstrates why the algorithm in this case is a linear time algorithm.
4.3 Heuristic Methods
As we noted earlier, the execution of the Wagner–Whitin algorithm may require com-
putation of cost terms for all production periods. Hence the algorithm may require a
number of calculations proportional to T 2. Thus, algorithms and heuristics that require
fewer potential computations are desirable. The Wagelmans–Hoesel–Kolen is one such
algorithm. In this section, we present two such heuristics: the Silver–Meal heuristic and
the least unit cost heuristic.
The heuristics imitate the algorithms we have discussed to this point in that they do
not allow an order to include only part of the demand of a period. Speciﬁcally, they seek
to determine the number of consecutive periods whose demands should be included
in an order that is placed. However, they use the average cost criterion to identify the
order quantity. They do not identify an optimal policy to minimize the total cost over the
planning horizon; they merely employ the average cost criterion to identify a reasonable
policy. In doing so, the heuristics use a rule to establish lot sizes that are consistent with
the rule used to obtain an optimal lot sizing decision in the basic EOQ model.
4.3.1 Silver–Meal Heuristic
The ﬁrst heuristic we will describe is the Silver–Meal heuristic. Deﬁne C(s,t) as the
average cost over periods s,s + 1,...,t such that an order is placed in period s to sat-
isfy the demands of periods s,s + 1,...,t. We obtained an expression for the total cost
incurred over periods s,s+1,...,t in (4.2). The average cost C(s,t) is equal to the total
cost divided by the number of periods t −s+1. Thus,
C(s,t) = K +h(ds+1 +ds+2 +···+dt)+h(ds+2 +ds+3 +···+dt)+···+h(dt)
t −s+1
.
The basic idea on which the heuristic is constructed is as follows. Suppose the order
placed in period s includes demands of periods s,s+1,...,t −1 and we are considering
whether to add period t’s demand to the order as well. This decision depends on whether
the average cost decreases or increases after the inclusion of period t’s demand in the

4.3
Heuristic Methods
105
order. If the average cost decreases, that is, C(s,t −1) > C(s,t), then the order is ex-
panded to include period t’s demand. Otherwise, if the average cost increases, the order
quantity is equal to ds +ds+1 +···+dt−1 and a fresh order is placed in period t. There-
fore, the heuristic seeks to ﬁnd an order quantity such that a local minimum is attained
according to the average cost criterion. For this heuristic to ﬁnd the optimal solution,
the average cost calculations would have to possess the following property. Suppose for
period s we ﬁnd that t, t > s, is the ﬁrst period for which C(s,t −1) < C(s,t). This is
the period that would be found using the Silver–Meal heuristic. Then for this period to
be optimal, C(s,t −1) would have to satisfy C(s,t −1) ≤C(s, j), j > t. This relation
would have to hold for all s. This does not have to happen, however.
The steps of the heuristic are outlined below.
Silver–Meal Heuristic
Step 1: Set s = 1 and t = 2. Set Q(s) = Q(1) = d1 as the current order quantity and
compute C(1,1) = K.
Step 2: If C(s,t) < C(s,t −1), increase Q(s) by dt and go to Step 3.
Otherwise, Q(s) = ds +ds+1 +···+dt−1. Set s = t, Q(t) = dt, C(t,t) = K and go to
Step 3.
Step 3: Set t ←t +1. Stop if t = T +1.
Otherwise, go to Step 2.
We demonstrate the heuristic using the data given in the example in Section 4.1.2.
Iteration 1:
Step 1: Set s = 1, t = 2, Q(1) = d1 = 10, and C(1,1) = 100.
Step 2: We compute
C(1,2) = K +hd2
2
= 100+1(60)
2
= 80,
which is less than C(1,1) = K
1 = 100. Hence, Q(1) is increased by d2 to 70.
Step 3: Set t = 3. Since t < T +1 = 6, we proceed to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
Step 2: We compute
C(1,3) = K +h(d2 +d3)+hd3
3
= 100+1(60+15)+1(15)
3
= 63.33,
which is less than C(1,2) = 80 as computed in Iteration 1. Hence, Q(1) is increased
by d3 to 85.

106
4
Dynamic Lot Sizing with Deterministic Demand
Step 3: Increase t by 1 to 4. Since t < T +1, we proceed to the next iteration.
Iteration 3:
Step 2: We compute
C(1,4) = K +h(d2 +d3 +d4)+h(d3 +d4)+hd4
4
= 100+1(60+15+150)+1(15+150)+1(150)
4
= 160,
which is greater than C(1,3) = 63.33 computed in Iteration 2. As a result, period 4’s
demand will not be satisﬁed by the order placed in period 1. The size of period one’s
order is 85 units.
Another order is placed in period 4. We set s = 4, Q(4) = d4 = 150, and C(4,4) =
K = 100.
Step 3: Increase t by 1 to 5. Since t < T +1, we proceed to the next iteration.
Iteration 4:
Step 2: We compute
C(4,5) = K +hd5
2
= 100+1(110)
2
= 105
which is greater than C(4,4) = 100. As a result, the order placed in period 4 will not
satisfy period 5’s demand. The quantity ordered in period 4 is equal to its demand,
150 units.
Another order is placed in period 5. We set s = 5 and Q(5) = d5 = 110.
Step 3: Increase t by 1 to 6. Since t = T +1, we stop.
Thus, the policy proposed by the heuristic is to place orders for 85 units, 150 units,
and 110 units in periods 1, 4, and 5, respectively. Observe that the same policy was
prescribed by the Wagner–Whitin algorithm and hence it is optimal.
4.3.2 Least Unit Cost Heuristic
The least unit cost heuristic is almost identical to the Silver–Meal heuristic. The two
heuristics differ in only one aspect: the criterion for placing a new order. Whereas in the
Silver–Meal heuristic we use the average cost per unit time C(s,t) to determine when

4.3
Heuristic Methods
107
to place another order, in the least unit cost heuristic we use a slightly different measure
to determine when to place the next order. The new one, which we denote by C1(s,t),
measures the average cost per unit demanded during an order cycle. That is,
C1(s,t) = K +h(ds+1 +ds+2 +···+dt)+h(ds+2 +ds+3 +···+dt)+···+h(dt)
ds +ds+1 +···+dt
.
(Note that the numerators of C(s,t) and C1(s,t) are identical.) The application of this
measure to determine when to place the next order is identical to the Silver–Meal heu-
ristic. To see this, suppose that the order placed in period s includes demands of periods
s,s+1,...,t −1 and we are considering whether to add period t’s demand to the order
as well. No order is placed in period t if the cost per unit demand decreases, that is,
C1(s,t −1) < C1(s,t); the order in period s is expanded to include period t’s demand.
Otherwise, if the cost per unit demand increases, a new order is placed in period t. The
steps of the algorithm can be obtained by replacing C by C1, and we omit the details.
We next illustrate the heuristic using the data given in the example in Section 4.1.2.
Iteration 1:
Step 1: Set s = 1, t = 2, and Q(1) = d1 = 10.
Step 2: We compute
C1(1,2) = K +hd2
d1 +d2
= 100+1(60)
10+60
= 2.29,
which is less than C1(1,1) = K
10 = 10. Hence, Q(1) is increased by d2 to 70.
Step 3: Set t = 3. Since t < T +1 = 6, we proceed to the next iteration.
Iteration 2:
Step 2: We compute
C1(1,3) = K +h(d2 +d3)+hd3
d1 +d2 +d3
= 100+1(60+15)+1(15)
10+60+15
= 2.24,
which is less than C1(1,2) = 2.29 computed in Iteration 1. Hence, Q(1) is increased by
d3 to 85.
Step 3: Increase t by 1 to 4. Since t < T +1, we proceed to the next iteration.
Iteration 3:
Step 2: We compute
C(1,4) = K +h(d2 +d3 +d4)+h(d3 +d4)+hd4
d1 +d2 +d3 +d4
= 100+1(60+15+150)+1(15+150)+1(150)
235
= 2.72,

108

Dynamic Lot Sizing with Deterministic Demand
which is greater than C(1,3) = 2.24. As a result, period 4’s demand will not be satisﬁed
by the order placed in period 1. The quantity of this order is equal to 85.
Another order is placed in period 4. We set s = 4, Q(4) = d4 = 150, and C(4,4) =
K
d4 = 100
150 = 0.67.
Step 3: Increase t by 1 to 5. Since t < T +1, we proceed to the next iteration.
Iteration 4:
Step 2: We compute
C(4,5) = K +hd5
d4 +d5
= 100+1(110)
260
= 0.81
which is greater than C(4,4). As a result, the order placed in period 4 will not satisfy
period 5’s demand. The quantity ordered in period 4 is equal to its demand, 150 units.
Another order is placed in period 5. Thus, the policy proposed by the heuristic is
to place orders for 85 units, 150 units, and 110 units in periods 1, 4, and 5, respec-
tively. Observe that the same policy was prescribed by the Wagner–Whitin algorithm
and Silver–Meal heuristic.
4.4 A Comment on the Planning Horizon
After studying the theorems and propositions in the preceding sections of this chapter,
it would be easy to conclude that there will always be a horizon length such that period
one’s production plan will always be ﬁxed at some amount no matter how many more
periods are added to the planning horizon. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.
Let us consider the following example. Suppose K = 150, h = 1, and d1 = d2 = 110
and dn = 100 for n ≥3. It would appear that the best strategy would be to produce every
other period.
Suppose the planning horizon consists of three periods. Then the optimal solution is
to produce 110, 210, and 0 units in periods one, two and three, respectively. Suppose
the planning horizon consists of four periods. Then the optimal solution is to produce
220, 0, 200, 0 in periods one through four, respectively. Note that increasing the length
of the planning horizon alters the production quantity in period one. In fact, in general,
the optimal policy when the planning horizon consists of an odd number of periods
is to produce 110,210,0,200,0,... units in periods one, two, and beyond. When the
planning horizon consists of an even number of periods, the optimal policy is to produce
220,0,200,0,200,... units in periods one, two, and beyond, respectively. Hence there

4.5

109
does not exist a planning horizon length for which period one’s production quantity is
unaltered as the horizon length is extended by one period.
4.5 Exercises
4.1. The cost model that we developed charged holding costs based on the period end-
ing on-hand inventory level. Suppose we consider charging holding costs continually
through time. Thus if the inventory level is x at time t in period j, we would charge
holding costs at that instant proportional to the quantity x. If hj is the holding cost rate
for period j and Tj is the length of period j, hj/Tj is the instantaneous rate at which
the holding cost is incurred. Prove that the optimal ordering policy is unaffected by the
inclusion of these holding costs in an optimization model.
4.2. When developing the Wagner–Whitin model and establishing properties affecting
the computational procedure for ﬁnding the optimal procurement policy, we assumed
that costs were stationary through time. Suppose purchasing and holding costs are time-
dependent. Develop a forward dynamic programming model and an algorithm for ﬁnd-
ing the optimal procurement policy in this case.
4.3. A manufacturer produces a variety of integrated circuits. The cost of setting up to
produce a lot of one particular type of integrated circuit is $4,000. The variable produc-
tion cost is estimated to be $8. By collaborating with its customers, the manufacturer
estimates that the demand during the next 8 months will be as follows: 15,000; 24,000;
20,000; 10,000; 5,000; 5,000; 20,000; and 4,000 units. The holding cost rate is .24 on
an annual basis. Assume production times are small compared to the length of a month.
Determine the optimal periods in which lots should be produced and the size of the cor-
responding production batches. Suppose that there are 5000 circuits on hand initially
and that it is desired to have at least 4,000 units on hand at the end of the eighth month.
Solve the problem using the Wagner–Whitin algorithm, the Wagelmans–Hoesel–Kolen
algorithm, the Silver–Meal heuristic, and the least unit cost heuristic.

4.6. Consider the deterministic lot sizing problem.
(a) Show that in any optimal policy xt(yt −xt) = 0 for all t.
(b) Prove that either the order quantity in period t is zero or it is equal to dt + dt+1 +
···+dk for some k ≥t.
4.7. Prove the following statements in the context of a deterministic lot sizing problem.
(a) In the optimal policy, if dt is satisﬁed by an order placed in period j, j < t, then
dj+1,dj+2,...,dt−1 are also satisﬁed by the same order.
(b) Suppose the optimal policy is unique (this is just to keep the statement simple). If
xt = 0 in the optimal policy, then the optimal values of yj, j = 1,2,...,t −1 in the T-
period model are same as the corresponding optimal values in a t −1-period model.
In a t −1-period model, the goal is to satisfy only the demands of periods 1 through
t −1.
(c) The planning horizon theorem.
(d) In the dynamic lot sizing problem, suppose period t’s demand is such that hdt > K.
Then an order is placed in period t in any optimal policy.
4.8. Consider the Wagner–Whitin algorithm. Recall that we used j∗(t) to denote the
period in which an order is placed to satisfy period t’s demand. We know that j∗(t +
1) ≥j∗(t). That is, the order for period t + 1 in the t + 1-period problem is placed in
period j∗(t) or later.
In the implementation of the algorithm, we consider j∗(t), j∗(t) + 1,...,t + 1 as
possible periods in which an order could be placed to satisfy period t + 1’s demand.
Let k be one such period, that is, k ∈{j∗(t), j∗(t)+1,...,t +1}. Suppose k is such that
the cost of holding dt+1 from period k to t +1, (t +1−k)hdt+1, is greater than the ﬁxed
cost K. Show that in the optimal policy, an order cannot be placed in period k to satisfy
period t +1’s demand.
Speciﬁcally, you have to show that it is better to place an order in period t +1 itself
than to place it in period k.

Single-Period Models
The models and environments discussed in the preceeding chapters have all been based
on the premise that the demand process is deterministic. In most real situations, this
assumption is violated. Our goal in this, and in subsequent chapters, is to consider
uncertainty directly in the decision models. In this chapter we will study the most basic
models in which demand is described by a random variable. These models pertain to
situations in which only a single procurement decision is made, and the effect of that
decision is felt over a single period of ﬁnite duration. These models are often called
one-shot or newsvendor models.
The newsvendor name for this type of model arises for the following reason. Sup-
pose a newsvendor operates a corner newstand. Each day the newsvendor places an
order for newspapers which will be delivered to the newstand the following morning.
Only one order can be placed for the papers. Suppose there is a cost to purchase each
newspaper and that there is a selling price as well. Demand for the newspapers occurs
throughout the day. If this demand exceeds the quantity ordered, there are lost sales.
There may be long-term consequences of lost sales since unsatisﬁed customers may
look elsewhere for papers in the future. On the other hand, if the demand is less than
the supply of papers, the newsvendor will incur the cost of disposing of the unsold pa-
pers. Day old papers have no value. The decision faced by the newsvendor is therefore
how many papers should be purchased.
There are many situations to which single-period models may apply. For example,
oftentimes stores will buy clothing to meet demand in a subsequent season. A single
season. In the military, spare parts are placed on submarines prior to the beginning of
a lengthy patrol. The types and quantities of each part type to stock on the submarines

Single-Period Models
In this chapter we will develop a basic philosophy for structuring models for envi-
ronments in which uncertainty is present. We will demonstrate how to formulate models
and will establish methods for obtaining optimal stock levels. We will start by exam-
ining a situation in which there is only a single item and then show how to extend the
ideas to cases where there are many items present.
5.1 Making Decisions in the Presence of Uncertainty
Making inventory procurement decisions when uncertainty is present requires a per-
spective that differs from the ones we have discussed to this point. The factors and
structural relationships that are the basis for the deterministic problems discussed in
earlier chapters must be extended when uncertainty exists. Our modeling framework
must now identify the sources and nature of uncertainty. We must determine how un-
certainty can be modeled, and how the decision problem should be structured. While
we may still want to determine when and how much to purchase, we need to state the
objective that is desired in mathematical terms. Thus we must be able to ascertain the
consequences of the decisions being made in operational and economic terms. As in
earlier analyses, we must not only construct appropriate decision models, but we must
establish approaches for ﬁnding the answers to these problems. Let us now examine
a very simpliﬁed problem that captures some concepts that underlie the building of
models in the presence of uncertainty.
5.2 An Example
Our goal is to determine a best stock level for a part that is integral to the operations
of an offshore oil rig. Each week, this rig is resupplied from stocks on shore. Further-
more, any units of this part that remain unused on the rig at the time of replenishment
of the part’s stock are taken back to the onshore location where they are refurbished.
Hence, there is no carryover of stock from one week to the next. Given this situation,
a planner each week determines how much stock to place on the oil rig. When making
this decision, the planner is cognisant of the fact that if this part fails during the week
and there is no stock on hand on the rig, production ceases until a replacement unit is
airlifted from the onshore facility to the rig. Unfortunately, the number of failures of
this part during a week is unknown in advance, which makes the selection of the proper
stocking level a difﬁcult task.

In order to make a stocking decision, we must construct a model. But what objective
should be chosen? What data are required to build the model? How will the conse-
quences of the decision be measured?
Clearly, there are two types of data that must be considered. First, we must have
an idea of how much demand could occur. Consequently, we will need to examine
failure data from past history. Second, we must have economic data, that is, the cost of
refurbishing unused units at the end of a week and the impact of not having stock on
hand on the rig when a failure occurs.
5.2.1 The Data
Fortunately, we have data pertaining to failures that have occurred during the past 100
weeks. These data are displayed in Figure 5.1. Before proceeding, we must ascertain
whether or not the demand process is stationary and if there is any correlation in the
demands from week to week.

Fig. 5.2. Demand data.
Figure 5.2 contains a plot of the cumulative demand over the 100 weeks. A quick
inspection of that graph indicates that demand is likely accumulating at a constant rate.
Subsequent statistical tests suggest that there is no reason to assume otherwise.
Similarly, a statistical test for independence indicates that there is no justiﬁcation for
rejecting the hypothesis that demand is independent from week to week. Next, we use
the demand data to construct a histogram of the weekly demand. This histogram will
be used to hypothesize a model of the uncertain nature of the demand process. (Note
in general we would use the distribution of forecast errors as the basis for modeling
uncertainty rather than this histogram.) This histogram is displayed in Figure 5.3, along
with a graph of the cumulative demand.
At this point we must understand how to interpret the data displayed in this his-
togram. Although the sample size (100 observations) is reasonably large, these data do
not represent the future of the demand process perfectly. For example, will we never ex-
perience a week in which there are 39 failures? Is it really the case that it is six times as
likely to observe 29 failures than it is to observe 30 failures in a week? In other words,
are we willing to use these historical data as the sole predictor of future events? Rather
than using these data in this way, we act as if these data are just random observations.
We construct the cumulative frequency of these observations and see in Figure 5.3 that
the resulting graph resembles one that corresponds to a normally distributed random

variable. A statistical test indicates that we cannot reject this hypothesis. Hence we will
use this representation of the demand process in our decision model.
We next turn to the cost data. Upon examining records, we estimate that it costs,
on average, $1000 to refurbish an unused unit that is brought back to the onshore fa-
cility at the end of a week. Furthermore, on average, the cost incurred when there is
insufﬁcient stock on hand (a backorder occurs) is $9000. This cost includes the value
of lost production and the cost of bringing a unit from shore to the oil rig using a con-
tractor’s helicopter. We assume in the following that sufﬁcient quantities of the part are
owned by the company and hence we are interested only in the incremental cost effect
of stocking or not stocking the units on the oil rig.
5.2.2 The Decision Model
Each week’s operation of the oil rig is identical to that of other weeks given our analysis
of the demand (failure) and cost data. Hence it is reasonable to assume that the desired
quantity to stock of our part is the same each week. Much more will be said about this

topic in the next chapter. Suppose we had chosen to stock either 30, 40, or 100 units at
the beginning of each week. Figures 5.4 through 5.6 contain graphs and data pertaining
to the consequences of operating with these different stocking levels.
Each ﬁgure contains time series graphs of weekly demand and the corresponding
weekly operating costs that would have resulted from using the particular stock level.
Additionally, there are data indicating the total accumulated operating costs (in thou-
sands of dollars), holding costs (in thousands of dollars), and backorder costs (in thou-
sands of dollars) that would have been incurred over the 100-week horizon. Finally,
there are data indicating the probability that all demand occurring during a week could
be met from on-hand stock and the fraction of total demand met from on-hand stock
over the 100-day horizon. We call the latter quantity the ﬁll rate.
Let us compare the information displayed in these three ﬁgures. The average demand
per week is about 30 units. Hence the data found in Figure 5.4 indicates how costs
would be incurred if no safety stock were held. By adding 10 units of safety stock (a
stock level of 40 units), we see that the operating costs would have been about $1.7
million lower. Note that holding costs increase and shortage costs decrease as safety
stock is added. We also observe that the probability of having no stockout in a period is
lower than the ﬁll rate. The probability of no stockout measures the fraction of weeks
during which no stockout occurred. When the stock level is 40, during 85 of the 100

weeks we see that demand was less than or equal to 40 units. In week 46 demand was
41 units and hence was one of the 15 weeks in which demand exceeded supply. But 40
of the 41 units of demand were satisﬁed from on-hand stock. While in general it is not
true that the probability of no stockout in a period is less than the ﬁll rate, it is the case
for situations of the type we see in this example.
Note further that as the stock level increases, the average cost per week changes as
well as the variance of the operating costs incurred per week. Observe that the variance
reduces as the stock level increases.
The question remains as to how we should select the best stock level. What should be
our objective when choosing this “best” level? Decisions of the sort we are making—
that is, inventory decisions—are normally made so as to keep the average cost as low as
possible. However, other measures could be used, and are in different contexts. Suppose
we choose the stock level that results in the lowest average cost per week. This solution
might result in a high variance in the weekly costs, which in some situations would
not be tolerable by management. Observe in Figures 5.4 through 5.6 how the variance
in the weekly operating costs changes as the stock level increases. We assume that
our decision maker’s utility function is such that the goal is to minimize the expected
weekly operating costs.

Fig. 5.6. Cost and demand time series when the stock level is 100 units.
Let us now construct a mathematical model that represents the environment we have
discussed. We begin by deﬁning nomenclature that we will use in the model. Let
D represent the demand random variable in each period,
s represent the target stock level,
h represent the holding (refurbishment) cost per unit per period,
for unused units at the end of a week, and
b represent the economic cost per unit short.
Suppose we somehow know the amount of demand, D, in the coming week and suppose
we stocked s units on the oil rig at the beginning of a week. Then the cost function for
the week is given by
c(s,D) ≡hmax (0,s−D)+bmax (0,D−s)
= h[s−D]+ +b[D−s]+,
which is displayed in Figure 5.7.
For the time being, suppose D is a discrete-valued random variable, and let P(D) be
the probability that demand in a week is equal to D.
Recall that our goal is to choose s so as to minimize the expected cost per week. We
denote the expected cost per week given s by the function G(s). Hence

where f(x) is the density function describing demand (D = x) in a week and a and b are

When demand is normally distributed, as we have assumed in our oil rig problem,
we can construct the function G(s) as follows. In general,

In our oil rig example, D has a normal distribution with µ = 30 and σ = 10. The

As can be seen from Figure 5.8, G(s) is a convex function, and therefore the value of

compute s∗and demonstrate that in general G(s) is a strictly convex function when
f(x) > 0 over the range [a,b].

where ¯F(·) is the complementary cumulative distribution function for the demand ran-
dom variable. The expected cost function G(s) is commonly called the newsvendor cost
function and (5.4) is commonly called the newsvendor solution.
Observe that this newsvendor solution states that s∗is chosen so that the probability
that demand exceeds supply is h/(h+b). G(s) is in general strictly convex when f(x) >

In our example problem, h/(h+b) = .1, which implies that (s−µ)/σ = 1.28. Thus
s = 30 + (1.28)(10) = 42.8, as indicated in Figure 5.8. The economic safety stock is
s−µ = s−30 = 12.8 or about 13 units.

Fig. 5.9. Expected cost functions for various CV values.
Figure 5.9 contains graphs of G(S) for three values of the per-week standard devi-
ation of demand. Several observations can be made. The coefﬁcient of variation (CV)
is deﬁned as follows: CV = σ/µ. As the CV increases, that is, as the uncertainty in
the weekly demand increases relative to the average weekly demand, we see that the
optimal target inventory level and the expected weekly operating costs increase sub-
stantially. Note how ﬂat G(s) becomes in the region around s∗as the CV increases. This
fact is clearly comforting since as the CV increases the accuracy of the parameter esti-
mation decreases. For example, when the CV = 1, if we used a stock level of 60 rather
than 70, our expected weekly operating costs would not differ substantially from the
lowest possible value. Nonetheless, the greater the uncertainty, the higher the expected
weekly costs.
5.3 Another Example
Let us examine another example environment. Suppose a buyer must choose how much
of a high priced women’s leather handbag to procure for the holiday season. The sup-
plier of the handbag is in Italy. Since these handbags are custom made, the buyer must
place a purchase order several months in advance of the holiday season. The buyer may
place only one order with the supplier each season. The purchase cost per unit is c
dollars and the selling price is q dollars per unit. Assume that demand is described by

5.3
Another Example
125
a discrete random variable. Let p(x) represent the probability that the store will sell x
units through the holiday season. If demand exceeds supply, the buyer believes there is
a goodwill cost as well, which we denote by b dollars per unit. This cost is in addition to
the lost revenue. The buyer believes that there is a goodwill cost since the handbag will
be advertised, and, hence, arriving customers experiencing a stockout will be annoyed.
On the other hand, if handbags remain on hand at the season’s end, they will be sold at
a price of ℓdollars per unit, where ℓ< c. The buyer wishes to establish the best quantity
to purchase so as to maximize expected proﬁt.
As in our earlier example, let s be the purchase quantity and s∗be the optimal quan-
tity. Furthermore, let G(s) now represent the expected proﬁt for the season when s
handbags are procured.
Then

where µ represents the expected sales for the season.
First, we will show that G(s) is a discretely concave function of s. We will accom-
plish this by demonstrating that the second difference is negative. The ﬁrst difference,
∆G(s), is deﬁned as follows:

p(x).
The second difference is
∆2G(s) = ∆G(s+1)−∆(G)
= −(q+b−ℓ)p(s+1) < 0 since q > ℓ, b > 0, and q > 0.
An optimal value of s is the smallest value for which ∆G(s) ≤0. Thus s∗is the
smallest value for which
∑

p(x) ≥1−(c−ℓ)
q+b−ℓ= q+b−c
q+b−ℓ=
(q−c)+b
(q−c)+b+(c−ℓ).
(5.7)
Observe that there may be more than one optimal solution. If ∆G(s∗) = 0, then both s∗
and s∗+1 are optimal.
Observe that c −ℓmeasures the loss incurred for any units remaining at the end
of the season, q−c represents the per-unit proﬁt on units sold during the season, and
(q −c) + b is the cost that arises due to a stockout, the lost margin plus the goodwill
cost.
Let us see how the solution is obtained for the following set of data. Suppose the
purchase cost per handbag is $250 and the selling price during the season is $700. Any
handbags left at the end of the season will be marked down to $100 and are certain
to sell at that price. The buyer estimates that the sales during the season are likely to
be at least 100 but not more than 250. The buyer feels that it is equally likely that
demand will assume values of 100 through 250 units. That is, demand is assumed to
be uniformly distributed for sales during the season. In addition, the buyer feels that
there is a goodwill cost of $50 associated with stockouts. Hence q = $700, c = $250,
ℓ= $100, b = $50, and p(x) =
1
151 for x = 100,...,250, and 0 otherwise.
The goal is to ﬁnd the amount to stock that maximizes expected proﬁt. This objective
can be achieved by ﬁnding the smallest value of s for which
∑
x≤s
p(x) ≥500
650 = .7692.

5.4
Multiple Items
127
This yields a value of s∗= 217 units.
An intern working with the buyer has looked at sales data for similar products sold
in previous seasons that have been promoted in a manner similar to the one planned for
the handbag. The intern found that the forecast errors were Poisson distributed for these
products. In this case, the buyer estimates demand to be 175 units. The intern suggests
to the buyer that this information be used to calculate the desired purchase quantity. The
stock level computed by the intern is 185 units using the Poisson demand model rather
than 217 units using the uniform demand model. We leave ﬁnding the incremental
expected proﬁt that is anticipated by using the intern’s solution as an exercise.
5.4 Multiple Items
The single-period problems we have described to this point have focused on the man-
agement of one item type. However, in most cases there are many item types. The
decisions made for each item type may not be independent because of constraints that
link the items together, and therefore we must establish a new way to compute stock
levels.
To illustrate how multiple item problems can be formulated and solved, let us return
to the oil rig example. Suppose we have two types of parts that must be stocked on the
oil rig. The storage space on the oil rig is limited for these two part types and hence
setting stock levels for the parts independently may result in a space requirement that
exceeds the available storage capacity. To simplify our analysis, let us assume that the
parts are the same size. Thus the storage constraint limits the total number of units
of the two part types that can be stocked. Suppose the distribution of weekly demand
for each part follows a Poisson distribution. The probability mass functions for these
parts are displayed in Figure 5.10 and Figure 5.11. The expected weekly demand differs
between the parts. The mean weekly demand is 10 units for part type 1 and 20 units for
part type 2.
Table 5.1 contains the individual probabilities and cumulative probabilities corre-
sponding to weekly demands for the two part types.
Suppose the average refurbishing cost for the unused units is $1,000 for both part
types. Additionally, assume the costs incurred when a stockout arises is $10,000 for
either part type.
The goal is to select the stock levels for the two part types that minimize the expected
weekly operating costs while satisfying the space constraint. Let Gi(si) represent the
expected weekly operating costs for part type i if the stock level for part type i is si
units, i = 1,2. Thus the problem is to

The graphs of the expected weekly costs for both part types are given in Figure 5.12.
The expected weekly cost is lowest when s1 = 14 and s2 = 26. To achieve the lowest
possible cost requires V ≥40 units of storage space. Whenever V < 40, the stock levels
must be adjusted to account for the lack of available storage capacity.
We will ﬁnd the optimal stocking levels for a given value of V using a marginal
analysis algorithm.
The expected weekly operating cost functions can be expressed as

To ﬁnd the solution to the example problem, we employ the following algorithm
when the capacity constraint is binding.
Marginal Analysis Algorithm
Step 0: Set A = 0, s1 = s2 = 0.
Step 1: Compute ∆Gi(si), i = 1,2.
Step 2: While A ≤V.
(a) Select i∗such that ∆Gi∗is smallest (most negative).
(b) Set s∗
i = s∗
i +1, A = A+1.
(c) Compute ∆Gi∗(s∗

In each iteration of Step 2 we select the part that reduces the expected weekly cost by
the largest amount.

Earlier we stated that when V ≥40, s∗
1 = 14 and s∗
2 = 26. Again refer to Table 5.2.
Observe that ∆G1(14) > 0 and ∆G2(26) > 0, which indicates that the expected weekly
cost would increase if s1 > s∗
1 or s2 > s∗
2.
Another way to solve this problem is to start with the unconstrained solution (s∗
1 +
s∗
2 = 40). Suppose V = 30 units. Then we could use the following marginal analysis
algorithm to obtain the solution.
An Alternative Marginal Analysis Algorithm
Step 0: Set A = (s∗
1 + s∗
2) −V (s∗
1,s∗
2 being the solutions to the unconstrained single
item part problems) and s1 = s∗
1, s2 = s∗
2.
Step 1: Compute ∆G1(s1 −1), ∆G2(s2 −1).
Step 2: While A > 0.
(a) Select i∗such that ∆Gi∗(si −1) is the smallest increase in the expected cost.
(b) Set si∗= si∗−1, A = A−1.
(c) Recompute ∆Gi∗(si∗−1).
(d) Repeat.
The implementation of this algorithm is illustrated in Table 5.2. The numbers in the
circles indicate the iteration of Step 2 that resulted in lowering the stock level of that
part by one unit.

Note that in many real problems the value of V is not always known. Hence, a graph
is constructed that measures the total expected weekly operating cost as a function of
V. The data in Table 5.2 can be used to construct such a graph.
5.4.1 A General Model
The example discussed in the previous section illustrates how multiple-item, single-
period problems can be formulated and solved. Let us now turn to a more general prob-
lem.
Suppose there are I part types, and the goal is to ﬁnd the stock levels, s∗

type of part so as to minimize the sum of the expected single-period cost functions,
Gi(si), while satisfying a constraint. Suppose each unit of part type i consumes vi units
of a resource, and suppose in total there are V units of the resource available. Then the

This problem is a knapsack problem and hence can be solved using a dynamic-
programming-based algorithm. Another way to obtain the stock levels is to employ a
Lagrangian-relaxation-based approach. Let us describe how this approach can be used
since we will be using it in subsequent chapters.
Let us assume that the constraint is active. Otherwise, the problem can be solved one
part at a time.
Let us assume that the decision variables are continuous. (We will later assume that
each si must assume an integer value.) Let us construct a Lagrangian relaxation of (5.8)
as

where θ is the Lagrangian multiplier. Assuming the Gi(si) are convex and differentiable
(as they are in realistic problems), the solution for part i occurs where
dGi(si)
dsi
+θvi = 0.
Suppose si(θ) is the value of si obtained when solving (5.9). Recall that θ measures the
rate of change of the objective function as the amount of available resource, V, changes.
Now compute ∑I
i=1 visi(θ). If this quantity exceeds V, then the value of θ is too small;
if ∑I
i=1 visi(θ) < V, then θ is too large. In the former case, θ must be increased and in
the latter it must be decreased. Once adjustments have been made to θ, problem (5.9) is
re-solved. In practice, a bisection method is often employed to generate the sequence of
the values of θ. We note that this approach may converge only after an inﬁnite number
of steps and therefore is normally stopped when |∑si(θ)·vi −V| < ε for some tolerance
ε > 0.
Oftentimes, decision makers want to know how the total expected cost
 ∑I
i=1 Gi(si)

depends on V. For example, suppose Gi(si) measures the expected number of shortages
that might be incurred over the time period for part i given si, vi is the unit cost for
part i, and V is the budget for all the parts. The decision maker would want to know

134

Single-Period Models
what the tradeoff is between investment and expected total shortages. In this case, such
a tradeoff relationship could be constructed by solving (5.9) for a wide range of values
of θ.
Now suppose that the values of s∗
i will be relatively small and integer-valued. Let
us also assume that there are many part types and that the maximum value of vi/V
is small (say .05 or less). This is the case in almost all spare parts problems found in
construction, automotive, and military applications. In these cases we would employ
a marginal analysis algorithm to ﬁnd a solution. As earlier, let ∆Gi(si) = Gi(si + 1)−
Gi(si). We could then use the following algorithm to ﬁnd a solution.
A Marginal Analysis Algorithm
Step 0: Set A = 0, si = 0 for all i.
Step 1: Compute ∆Gi(si) for all i.
Step 2: While A ≤V.
(a) Select i∗such that

yields the largest decrease in the value of the objective
function per unit of resource invested.
(b) Set si∗= si∗+1, A = A+vi.
(c) Recompute ∆Gi∗(si∗).
(d) Repeat.
The solution generated by the above algorithm will likely not be feasible, since the
last iteration will likely increment the resource requirement above the available quan-
tity. Several alternatives exist to adjust the solution. We could revert to the solution
found in the previous iteration, which is feasible, and accept that as the solution. We
could modify the algorithm so that Step 2(a) considers only parts for which A + vi re-
mains feasible. Or we could ignore the fact that the solution generated by the algorithm
is infeasible. This can safely be done in many economic applications when V is large
and the incremental value of resource usage (vi) is insigniﬁcant compared with V. If
V is an investment budget that is in tens of millions of dollars and the values of the vi
do not exceed, say, $100,000 or so, then the signiﬁcance of the infeasibility is minimal.
In automotive applications, investments are in the billions of dollars and the maximum
value of parts is on the order of $10,000, of which there are few in number out of the
hundreds of thousands of parts managed in such systems.
Marginal-analysis-based algorithms are quite useful since solutions can be computed
very quickly. The application of marginal analysis algorithms will be discussed further
in later chapters.

5.4.2 Multiple Constraints
In the previous section we demonstrated how certain single-period, multi-item stocking
problems can be represented and solved when there is a single constraint that links the
items together. Let us now extend that discussion to certain cases in which multiple
constraints exist that link the procurement decisions.
Suppose our buyer will purchase not only handbags but many other high fashion
items for the holiday season. Let I represent the number of items that may be purchased.
Let si, qi, ℓi, µi, ci, and bi represent the quantity purchased, selling price per unit during
the season, markdown price at the end of the season, the expected season’s demand, the
unit cost, and the lost goodwill cost for item i, i = 1,...,I. As shown in Section 5.3, the
expected proﬁt for item i is given by
Gi(si) = (qi −ℓi)µi −(ci −ℓi)si −(qi +bi −ℓi) ∑
x>si
(x−si)pi(x),
(5.10)
where pi(x) measures the probability that x units will be demanded for item i during
the holiday season.
Let us assume that several constraints exist that will force a tradeoff to be made when
purchasing the inventory. For example, there may be a budget limit for all the items that
constrains the total amount purchased. There may be storage constraints, too. Let us
assume that there are m linear resource constraints that limit purchases, and that aij
represents the amount of resource j consumed per unit purchased of item i. Then we
have m constraints of the form
∑
i
aijsi ≤vj, j = 1,...,m,
(5.11)
where vj is the amount of resource j that is available.
Observe that (5.10) is a non-linear function of si. We will now illustrate how this
non-linear function can be replaced by a linear one. The non-linearity arises from the
expected shortage function ∑
x>si
(x −si)pi(x) = Bi(si). When si = 0,Bi(0) = µi. Deﬁne
∆Bi(si) = Bi(si + 1) −Bi(si). As we saw earlier, ∆Bi(si) = −
∑
x≥si+1
pi(x). Let δik =
∆Bi(k), and
yik =
 1, when si ≥k,
0, otherwise .
Then
si =∑
k
yik and Bi(si) = µi +∑
k
δikyik.
(5.12)

Suppose we remove si from both the constraints and the objective function using
(5.12). Then we can write the procurement problem as follows:
maximize

yik ≤vj, j = 1,...,m,
yik = 0 or 1.
(5.13)
Note that since δik < δi,k−1, yik cannot equal one unless yi,k−1 is equal to one. Because
this is the case, we would likely replace the constraints yik = 0 or 1 with 0 ≤yik ≤1,
which would make the problem a linear program. There would be a maximum of one
fractional value for a yik for each item. A feasible solution could be found by setting
each variable that assumes a fractional value in the solution to the linear program to 0.
This assumes that aij ≥0 for all i and j. Other rules could be employed to obtain a solu-
tion, too. If the constraints are “soft,” that is the values of the vi can be altered slightly,
then the fractional values can be rounded upwards so that all the yik variables assume a
value of 0 or 1. When the aij are small relative to the value of vj, such adjustments are
very often possible in inventory planning problems.
We have illustrated how a particular multi-item, single-period procurement problem
can be formulated as a linear program. Many single-stage, probabilistic, production and
inventory planning problems can be expressed as linear programs by replacing variables
with others in the manner we have shown.

5.1. A distributor of seasonal items wants to establish the best stock level to purchase.
The distributor estimates that the demand for an item during the season will be normally
distributed with a mean of 100 units and a standard deviation of 10 units. The items will
sell for $25.00 and will cost the distributor $10.00. Units unsold at the end of the season
will be sold to a third party for $5.00 a unit. How many units should be purchased to
maximize expected proﬁt?

5.2. Re-solve Problem 5.1 under the assumption that demand is Poisson distributed with
a mean of 100 units. Now assume demand is uniformly distributed with the mean and
standard deviation as stated in Problem 5.1. Again, re-solve the problem.
5.3. A manufacturer of a part, purchased by Llenroc Electronics (LE) for its airline
customers, has just informed LE that it is going to terminate production of the part
type. The manufacturer has informed LE that it has one last opportunity to obtain the
part at the normal production rate price. The manufacturer is willing to sell units to LE
for $2,000 at this point in time. However, if LE wishes to procure the part type at a later
point in time the unit price will likely increase to $25,000. Another factor that LE faces
is the remaining length of time the airlines might use the part. Suppose the remaining
life is gamma distributed with a mean of 5 years and a standard deviation of 1.25 years.
The demand for the part is Poisson distributed with a rate of 2 units per year. There is
no residual value for these parts if they are not used. What quantity of this part would
you recommend LE to purchase from the manufacturer? Assume LE has no stock on
hand or on order.
5.4. In Problem 5.3 we assumed that the demand rate per year for the part is a constant.
Suppose that this is not the case. Let Λ(t) represent the expected remaining cumulative
demand for the part given the remaining useful life of the part is t. Then the prob-
ability that n remaining units are demanded, given Λ(t), is e−Λ(t) Λ(t)n
n! . Assume that
the remaining lifetime is t years with probability p(t). Suppose p(3) = .1, p(4) = .2,
p(5) = .4, p(6) = .2, p(7) = .1, and Λ(t) = 2√t. Using the other data from Exercise
5.3, what quantity of the part should LE procure?
5.5. In Exercises 5.3 and 5.4 we assumed that the subsequent purchase cost of the part
is $25,000, independent of the year in which such an order might be placed. Suppose
the per-unit subsequent costs are estimated to be $25,000, $26,000, $28,000, $30,000,
$33,000, $35,000, and $40,000 for years 1 through 7, respectively. These costs repre-
sent their discounted values. Thus, if a shortage for a unit occurs in year 5, the unit
procurement cost would be $33,000. Additionally, there is a holding cost charged per
unit per year. The holding cost of a particular unit is charged at a rate of .15 of the
purchase cost of that unit. Using the demand and lifetime data given in Problem 5.4 and
an initial procurement cost of $2,000 per unit, ﬁnd LEs optimal procurement quantity.
5.6. Suppose the unit procurement cost is a function of the quantity purchased. In par-
ticular, suppose that there is a set of values 0 = a0 < a1 < ··· < an such that the
purchase price per unit is ci if the quantity ordered q satisﬁes ai−1 < q ≤ai, with
c1 > c2 > ··· > cn. Assuming the selling price remains constant, extend the analysis
developed in Section 5.2.2 to represent this situation.

5.7. Use the method developed in Problem 5.6 to solve Problem 5.1 when the unit price

are purchased.
5.8. Each week Brian visits the ﬁsh market in Boston and procures quantities of a va-
riety of ﬁsh that he will take to sell in Ithaca, NY. He has capacity to store only 1000
pounds of ﬁsh in his truck. Suppose he concentrates on four types of ﬁsh that appear to
be best choices today. Suppose demand is normally distributed for these ﬁsh with ex-
pected sales of 100, 300, 400, and 100 pounds, respectively. The standard deviations for
these demands are correspondingly 20, 30, 90, and 25 pounds. Unsold ﬁsh are worth-
less. The proﬁts per pound are $1, $1.5, $1.7, and $1.8 respectively. How much of each
type of ﬁsh should be procured? Solve this problem using a Lagrangian method.
5.9. A submarine is being stocked for a lengthy mission. Certain parts are carried on
the vessel in case repairs are required while at sea. Three such critical parts are stored
in a compartment that has limited space. The three part types all have very similar ge-
ometries. The capacity of the compartment is 10 units. The demand for these parts is
negative binomially distributed on the basis of past history. They have expected de-
mands of 2.5, 3, and 2 for the duration of the mission. The variances of demand are 3,
5, and 6, respectively. What quantity of each item should be stocked so as to maximize
the probability that there will be no shortages? Demands are independent among the
three part types. Suppose the objective is to minimize the expected number of short-
ages. What is the optimal solution in this case? Use marginal analysis to compute the
answer.
5.10. Llenroc Electronics repairs equipment at customer locations. Customers call and
report a failure of a system (e.g., copy machine) along with information about the na-
ture of the failure. On the basis of this information, Llenroc dispatches a repair techni-
cian to the customer location along with a collection of parts. The type of repair, and
hence the set of parts required to complete the repair, is not known with certainty at
the time the technician is dispatched. Associate with each repair type i a collection of
part quantities Ri = {aij : j = 1,...,P}, where P represents the number of part types,
and aij ∈{0,1,...} represents the quantity of part type j required to complete a repair
of type i. Suppose pi represents the probability that a repair of type i will be required.
Suppose vj represents the physical volume of part type j. Develop a model and a solu-
tion methodology for ﬁnding the mix of parts that should be carried by the technician
if the goal is to minimize the chance that the technician does not have the set of parts
needed to complete the repair, subject to a constraint on the total physical volume of
parts that the technician can carry to the job site. Let V be the available volume. Assume
∑j aij ≪V for all i but ∑i ∑j aij > V. Develop an exact model and solution approach.

Also, construct a heuristic that can be used to determine the contents of the technician’s
repair parts kit.
5.11. Each day technicians at Llenroc Electronics repair equipment located at customer
sites. Since these repair actions are often accomplished by removing and replacing de-
fective parts, the technicians are required to take parts with them to complete the repairs
in a timely manner. In Exercise 5.10 we assumed that there was an unlimited supply of
parts available that could be selected by the technician and that there was only one tech-
nician. Suppose now that there are N technicians. Suppose also that there are bj units
of part type j on hand that are available to distribute to the N technicians. Technician
n cannot carry a volume of parts greater than Vn. Assume each technician’s demand for
parts occurs in the manner described in Exercise 5.10. Construct an appropriate model
and solution procedure that can be employed so that the expected number of customer
repairs that can be completed using the allocation of parts to technicians is maximized
considering part availability and volume constraints.
5.12. A buyer for a wine shop visits Italy every year and places an order with produc-
ers for a wide range of wines. Some are quite expensive while others are moderately
expensive. However, the buyer has only this one chance to buy these wines since other
buyers will likely purchase the remaining available supply. Suppose there are N types
of wines the buyer is considering to purchase. Let ci be the per-bottle cost for wine of
type i and qi the average selling price for a bottle of wine of type i, i = 1,...,M. Wine of
type i not sold after a year will be discounted and sold for ℓi dollars per bottle. Demand
for wines of type i is normally distributed with mean µi and standard deviation σi. The
buyer also has a constraint on the dollar amount he can purchase. The buyer also wants
to have a mix of wines. The buyer wants to purchase at least ai but no more than bi
bottles of type i wines, i = 1,...,M. Construct a model that can be used to maximize
the buyers expected proﬁt subject to the constraints that limit the procurement deci-
sions. Construct a Lagrangian type of solution method that can be used to calculate the
best mix of wines to purchase. Next, show how a marginal analysis type of algorithm
could be used to ﬁnd the optimal purchase plan, assuming the demand distribution for
each wine type is negative binomially distributed. Finally, show how to represent this
decision problem as a linear program.
5.13. In Exercise 5.12, suppose ai and bi are measured in cases, where a case contains
12 bottles. Suppose further that purchases are made in case quantities. Assuming de-
mand for each wine type is negative binomially distributed, construct a marginal anal-
ysis type of procedure that can be employed to ﬁnd the optimal procurement strategy.

Purchases of the item can occur at only this time. Suppose the purchase price is c dollars

per unit and the in-season selling price is q dollars per unit. Suppose s represents the
procurement quantity and x the number of units sold during the season. When supply
exceeds the in-season demand, that is, when s −x > 0, the remaining units are sold
at a discounted price. The discount depends on the magnitude of s−x. Suppose when
s−x > 0, the total revenue for these units is
q(s−x)−a(s−x)2, where a > 0.
Suppose the distribution of demand has a symmetric triangular distribution with lower
and upper limits α and β, respectively, with α ≥0. Construct an algorithm for ﬁnding
the optimal procurement quantity.
5.15. A buyer of clothing items must purchase these items well in advance of the sell-
ing season. The store’s manager recognizes that sales volume depends on the advertised
selling price. If the manager sets the advertised selling price to be qi, then the proba-
bility distribution of the sales has density fi(x), with mean µi and standard deviation
σi. Suppose I possible sales prices are considered. The store manager has noted that
as qi increases µi decreases and furthermore σi/µi increases as qi increases. Suppose
the buyer informs the manager that the unit procurement cost is c dollars. All clothing
remaining at the season’s end is sold for ℓdollars per unit, where ℓ< c. Additionally,
the manager believes there is a goodwill cost incurred when there is insufﬁcient stock
on hand to meet customer demand. The goodwill cost depends on the selling price. The
higher the selling price, the higher the goodwill cost per unit short. Construct a model
and solution methodologies that the manager and buyer can use to ﬁnd the optimal
procurement quantity.
5.16. In Section 5.3 we discussed an example in which a buyer had to determine how
many handbags to purchase for a holiday season. Using the data in that example, ﬁnd
the optimal order quantity assuming demand is Poisson distributed with mean of 175
units rather uniformly distributed over the range 100 to 250 units. What is the expected
incremental proﬁt that would be obtained if this solution were used rather than the one
obtained assuming demand was uniformly distributed?

Inventory Planning over Multiple Time Periods:
Linear-Cost Case
The discussion in the previous chapter focused on decision making when the planning
horizon consisted of a single period. The assumption was made that decisions in one
period would not affect those made in other periods. But what happens when a decision
at one point in time does affect decisions in subsequent time periods? Hence, when is it
necessary to consider other time periods when making these inventory decisions? Ad-
ditionally, what policies are best for managing inventories in a dynamic environment?
The focus of this chapter is on answering these and other related questions. Speciﬁcally,
we will again restrict ourselves to the case where the ﬁxed cost of placing an order is
negligible. We will begin by showing that a base-stock or order-up-to policy is optimal
in a number of different environments. Next we will develop a dynamic programming
model that can be employed to ﬁnd optimal stocking decisions. On the basis of this
model, we will then establish properties that optimal solutions possess. The discussion
of how capacities on production affect stocking decisions follows. The chapter con-
cludes with a discussion of multi-echelon systems, and how the role of each location
within a supply chain differs.
6.1 Optimal Policies
To begin, we will concentrate on establishing the form of an optimal policy for man-
aging a single item. We will assume that time is divided into periods. Initially, we
will assume the planning horizon is ﬁnite in length and that lead times are determinis-
tic. Costs incurred in each period are (i) linear purchasing and shipping costs between
stages in the more general case, (ii) linear holding and backorder costs at the demand
location, and (iii) linear holding costs for all other locations in a supply chain. We will

then show how the analysis can be extended to consider random lead times, multiple
stages, a more general demand model, limited production capacities in each period in
serial systems, and how to consider an inﬁnite planning horizon.
6.1.1 The Single-Unit, Single-Customer Approach: Single-Location Case
We will ﬁrst examine a single-location system in detail. This system operates as follows.
At the beginning of each period, an order is placed on an outside supplier and arrives
exactly m−1 periods in the future. Subsequent to the time the order is placed, the order
due in that period is received from the supplier; customer demands are then observed.
Demands in each period are assumed to be independent from period to period. All
excess demand is backordered. At the end of each period, both holding and backorder
costs are incurred. The approach we will use to establish the form of an optimal policy
is called the “single-item, single-customer” approach that was recently developed by
Muharremoglu and Tsitsiklis [250].
6.1.1.1
Notation and Deﬁnitions
We begin our analysis by presenting the notation and key deﬁnitions. As stated, we
initially assume the planning horizon of the system consists of N periods, numbered
n = 1,2,...,N, in that order. We assume that the probability distribution of Dn, the
demand in period n, is known and is independent among periods.
We consider each unit of demand as an individual customer. Suppose at the begin-
ning of period 1 there are v0 customers waiting to have their demand satisﬁed. We index
these customers 1, 2, ..., v0 in any order. All subsequent customers are indexed v0 +1,
v0 + 2, ... in the order of the period of their arrivals, arbitrarily breaking ties among
customers that arrive in the same period.
Next, we deﬁne the concept of the distance of a customer at the beginning of any
period. See Figure 6.1. Every customer who has been served is at distance 0; every cus-
tomer who has arrived, placed an actual order, but who has not yet received inventory, is
at distance 1; all customers arriving in subsequent periods are said to be at distances 2,
3, ... corresponding to the sequence in which they will arrive. Distances are assigned to
customers that arrive in the same period in the same order as their indices. This ensures
that customers with higher indices are always at “higher” distances.
Next, we deﬁne the concept of a location for a unit. Again see Figure 6.1. There are
m+2 possible locations at which a unit can exist. If the unit has been used to satisfy a

6.1
Optimal Policies
143
customer’s order, the location of this unit is 0. If it is part of the inventory on hand, it is
in location 1. If the unit has not been ordered from the supplier, it is in location m+1.
At the beginning of period 1, we assign an index to all units in a serial manner,
starting with units at location 1, then location 2, ..., location m + 1, and arbitrarily
assign an order to units present at the same location. We assume a countably inﬁnite
number of units is available at the supplier, that is, location m+1, at all times.
We will use indices j and k to denote the indices of units as well as customers. We
deﬁne yjn to be the distance of customer j at the beginning of period n and zjn to be the
location of unit j at the beginning of period n.
Fig. 6.1. Locations of units and distances of customers.
We deﬁne the state of the system at the beginning of period n to be the vector xn =
((z1n,y1n),(z2n,y2n),...).
Next, we explain the sequence of events in period n in detail.
1. (zjn,yjn) is known for all j, j = 0, 1, 2, ....

144

Inventory Planning
2. An order is placed, which we denote by qn, where qn is a non-negative integer. All
units in locations j = 2, 3, ..., m move to the next location prior to placing the order,
that is, location j −1. The qn units move from location m+1 to location m. If a unit
was ordered from the supplier ℓperiods ago (1 ≤ℓ< m), it is in location m−ℓ.
3. Demand Dn is realized and these new customers arrive and are at distance 1. That
is, customers at distances 2, 3, ..., 2+ Dn −1 all arrive and are, by deﬁnition, now
at distance 1. All customers at distances 2+ Dn, 3+ Dn, ... at the beginning of the
period move Dn steps towards distance 1.
4. Units on hand and waiting customers are matched to the extent possible. That is,
as many waiting customers are satisﬁed as possible and as many units on hand are
consumed as possible.
5. h dollars are charged per unit of inventory remaining on hand (at location 1) and b
dollars are charged per waiting customer (at distance 1). Clearly, only one of these
costs will be incurred in any period. We assume b > h. This ensures that if the
inventory position is negative in some period, then the optimal policy will be to
increase the inventory position to some non-negative level.
The performance measure under consideration in our initial discussion is the ex-
pected sum (discounted or undiscounted) of costs over the N period planning horizon.
Next, we deﬁne a policy. Let ujn ∈{Release,Hold} denote the decision made in
period n for unit j. By Release, we mean that an order is placed for a unit and that it
enters the supplier’s production/distribution system. However, note that the only units
over which we have control are the units at the supplier, that is, at location m+1. The
movement of all other units is governed by the lead time and demand processes as
deﬁned previously. A policy is a function that maps every possible realization of xn to
a vector of Release/Hold actions for each unit at location m+1.
Observe, however, that when a decision is made to release q units from location
m + 1, it does not matter which q units are released. Consequently, we can consider a
class of policies that always releases the units with the smallest indices from m + 1.
We call such a policy a monotone policy. A class of policies is said to be optimal if it
contains at least one optimal policy. The class of monotone policies is clearly optimal.
A monotone policy releases unit j before or at the same time as unit j + 1 but never
in any period following the one in which unit j + 1 is released. Similarly, we deﬁne a
monotone state to be one where lower-indexed units are in the same or lower-indexed
locations. That is, zkn ≤zjn if k ≤j. Since lead times are the same for all units and we
started period 1 in a monotone state, the system is always in a monotone state when a
monotone policy is followed. Furthermore, by deﬁnition, the customers also arrive in
the order of their indices. We deﬁne a policy as a committed policy if it ensures that the
only customer that the jth unit can satisfy is customer j’s demand and that the only unit
that customer j can receive is the jth unit. Assume that the units at location 1 that are

6.1
Optimal Policies
145
picked to satisfy customers at distance 1, as well as the customers at distance 1 picked to
consume units at location 1, are those with the lowest indices. Hence, every monotone
policy is also a committed policy. Consequently, the class of committed policies is also
optimal. Since this is an important fact, we state this as a lemma.
Lemma 6.1. The class of monotone policies is optimal. Furthermore, every monotone
policy is a committed policy and hence the class of committed policies is also optimal.
In the next section, we develop a proof of the optimality of base-stock policies for
periodic review, single-stage uncapacitated systems of the type we have described.
6.1.1.2
Optimality of Base-Stock Policies
In this section, we ﬁrst show that the system can be decomposed into a collection of
countably inﬁnite subsystems, each having a single unit and a single customer. Subse-
quently, we prove that each subsystem can be managed optimally by using a policy we
call a “critical distance” policy. We prove that when the same “critical distance” policy
is used to manage each subsystem, the system follows a base-stock policy.
6.1.1.2.1
Decomposition of the System into Subsystems
Let us ﬁrst outline the proof technique. First, we observe that the cost of the system
is the sum of the costs incurred for each unit–customer pair. Second, we show that
each of these pairs can be controlled independently and optimally and that the resulting
policy is optimal for the entire system. Third, we examine the individual unit–customer
problem and show that the optimal policy is a “critical distance” policy: Release a
unit if and only if the corresponding customer is closer than a critical distance. Last, we
observe that operating each unit–customer pair using a critical distance policy produces
an echelon base-stock policy in the original system.
Let us now precisely deﬁne the concepts of the system, the subsystems, and the sets
of constraints that govern these systems and subsystems.
Deﬁnition 6.1. Let S refer to the entire system with all the units and all the customers.
Subsystem w, represented by Sw, 1 ≤w, refers to the unit–customer pair with index w.
Deﬁnition 6.2. Constraints on Monotone and Committed Policies in S:
Monotonicity: Unit j ( j = 1, 2, ...) cannot be released before unit j −1.
Commitment: Unit j ( j = 1, 2, ...) serves customer j.
Deﬁnition 6.3. Constraint on Committed Policies in Sw:
Commitment: Unit w serves customer w.

We will now show that the optimal cost for the system S is equal to the sum of the
optimal costs for the subsystems Sw. We will prove this fact by demonstrating that every
monotone and committed policy for system S corresponds to a set of monotone and
committed policies for the subsystems, Sw, and that any set of monotone and committed
policies for the subsystems yields a feasible policy for the system S. We will also show
that when the individual subsystems are managed “independently and optimally,” the
resulting policy for the system S is optimal.
From now on, we will use ˜S to denote the group of all subsystems, that is, ˜S =
(S1,S2,...). When only monotone and committed policies are considered, the con-
straints in Deﬁnition 6.2 apply to S while the constraint in Deﬁnition 6.3 applies to ˜S.
When we say “the (optimal) expected cost for ˜S,” we mean the sum of the (optimal)
expected subsystem costs.
We have assumed so far that xn is the state information available to us while man-
aging the entire system S or any subsystem Sw. However, observe that the subsystems
are “operationally independent” in the sense that each subsystem can be managed inde-
pendently without being affected by the policies used to manage the other subsystems.
Consequently, we can ﬁnd an optimal policy for managing Sw that uses only those parts
of the state vector xn that pertain to unit w and customer w. We deﬁne xw
n
def
= (zwn,ywn).
Thus, xw
n is a sufﬁcient state descriptor for Sw. This means that an optimal policy for
˜S can be found by managing the subsystems independently. A subtle point to be noted
here is that the subsystems, though operationally independent, are stochastically depen-
dent through the demand process.
We are now ready to state and prove the results relating the optimal costs and policies
for the system S and the subsystems Sw, w = 1, 2, ....
Theorem 6.1. For any starting state x1 in period 1, the optimal expected discounted
(undiscounted) cost in periods 1, 2, ..., N for system S equals the optimal expected dis-
counted (undiscounted) cost in periods 1, 2, ..., N for the group of subsystems ˜S. Fur-
thermore, when each subsystem w is managed independently and optimally using the
state vector xw
n in every period n, the resulting policy is optimal for the entire system S.
Proof. First, observe that the cost incurred by S is the sum of the costs incurred by
every unit and every customer, since the holding and backorder costs are linear.
Second, observe that every monotone and committed policy for S produces a set of
committed policies, one for each subsystem Sw. Consequently, the optimal expected
cost for ˜S is a lower bound on the optimal expected cost for S over any number of
periods, since a monotone and committed policy is optimal for S.
Third, observe that operating each subsystem independently using any committed
policy is a feasible policy for S. Consequently, the optimal expected cost for S is a
lower bound on the optimal expected cost for ˜S.

6.1
Optimal Policies
147
Combining the two lower-bound arguments above proves that the optimal expected
costs for S and ˜S are equal. The earlier discussion about the “operational independence”
of the subsystems and this equality result show that when each subsystem w is managed
independently and optimally using the state vector xw
n , the resulting policy for the entire
system, S, is optimal.
⊓⊔
Next, we show the existence of an optimal policy with a very special structure for
every subsystem.
6.1.1.2.2
Optimal Policy Structure for a Subsystem
Before examining an individual subsystem, we ﬁrst observe that all subsystems are
identical in the sense that (i) they have identical cost structures and (ii) given a state (xw
n )
and a ﬁxed operating policy for a subsystem, the stochastic evolution of the subsystem
is independent of the index w. Consequently, the optimal policies are identical across
all subsystems.
We deﬁne R∗
n(y) ⊆{Release,Hold} to be the set of optimal decisions for subsystem
w at time n if ywn is y and if zwn is m+1.
Next, we show that there is a “critical distance” policy that is optimal for a sub-
system. We need the following lemma to prove this fact. The lemma states that if it is
uniquely optimal for subsystem w to release unit w (if it is at location m+1) in period
n when customer w is at a distance y + 1, then it would be optimal to release it if the
customer were any closer and the unit were at location m+1.
Lemma 6.2. R∗
n(y+1) = {Release} implies that R∗
n(y) ⊇{Release}.
Proof. The proof is by contradiction. Assume the statement is not true. That is, there
exist n and y such that R∗
n(y + 1) = {Release} and R∗
n(y) = {Hold}. Another way of
saying this is as follows: it is suboptimal for a subsystem to hold unit w if customer w
is at a distance y+1 while it is suboptimal for a subsystem to release unit w if customer
w were at a distance y.
Consider some monotone and committed policy for S. Assume in period n that we
can ﬁnd subsystems w and w + 1 such that ywn is y and y(w+1)n is y+ 1. Monotonicity
implies that this policy would choose one of the following three pairs of actions for
units w and w + 1: (a) release both w and w + 1, (b) hold both w and w + 1, and (c)
release w and hold w+1.
Cases (a) and (c) are suboptimal for subsystem w, while cases (b) and (c) are sub-
optimal for subsystem w + 1 owing to our initial assumption. This implies that any
monotone and committed policy for S is suboptimal for at least one of subsystems w
and w + 1. So, any monotone and committed policy for S has a higher expected cost
than the optimal cost for ˜S from period n onwards, which is the same as the optimal cost

148
6
Inventory Planning
for S. This implies that no monotone and committed policy can be optimal for S, which
contradicts our earlier assertion about the optimality of some such policy. Therefore,
our assumption about R∗
n(y) and R∗
n(y+1) is invalid.
⊓⊔
We use this lemma to develop the notion of a “critical distance” policy. Let us deﬁne
y∗(n) def
= max{ y : R∗
n(y) ⊇{Release} }.
y∗(n) is deﬁned in such a way that it is optimal to release unit w if and only if customer
w in period n is at a distance of y∗(n) or closer. This distance y∗(n) is the “critical
distance” in period n for every subsystem.
Consider the policy
Rn(y) = {Release} if and only if y ≤y∗(n).
Policy Rn is an optimal policy for every subsystem. The next observation we make is
that when policy Rn is used in period n for every subsystem, the resulting policy for the
original system S is an order-up-to policy. This can be shown either using an algebraic
proof or using a more intuitive argument, which we now provide.
Theorem 6.2. The optimal policy for S is to release as many units as necessary to raise
the inventory position to y∗(n)−1 in period n when the planning horizon consists of N
periods. That is, a state-dependent order-up-to or base-stock policy is optimal for the
entire system when the planning horizon is ﬁnite.
Proof. We know that policy Rn is optimal for every subsystem. It can be seen that if R1,
..., Rn−1 are the policies used on each of the subsystems in periods 1, ..., n−1, we will
start period n in a state where the units that are in location m+1 bear consecutive labels.
Consequently, the corresponding customers who have not arrived are in consecutive
distances. Among these customers, those in locations 2, 3, ..., y∗(n) are all within the
critical distance y∗(n). All backordered customers are also within the critical distance.
The policy Rn dictated that we should release the waiting unit in just the right number of
subsystems in period n so that all waiting customers and all future customers within the
critical distance can be satisﬁed with the units on hand or on order. That is equivalent
to saying we would raise the inventory position to y∗(n)−1.
⊓⊔
This concludes the proof of the ﬁnite-horizon optimality result for uncapacitated
single-stage systems with constant lead times. In the next two sections, we will discuss
how this approach can be extended to more general situations.

6.1
Optimal Policies
149
6.1.1.3
Stochastic Lead Times
So far, we have assumed that the lead time is exactly m−1 periods. Let us now relax this
assumption by allowing stochastic lead times subject to the restriction that orders cannot
cross, that is, the sequence in which orders are received from the supplier corresponds
to the sequence in which orders were placed on the supplier. We permit the lead time
distribution to be governed by the lead time model described below.
The lead time process evolves as follows. There is a random variable ρn, whose
distribution speciﬁes the least “age” of orders that will be delivered in period n to
location 1. This means all outstanding orders placed in period n −ρn or earlier are
delivered in period n. We assume that the sample space of the random variable ρn is
{0,1,2,... ,m−1} and consequently, the maximum lead time of an order is m−1 peri-
ods.
The sequence of events in a period as described in Section 6.1 is now modiﬁed
slightly. Because of the possibility of more than one period’s orders arriving at location
1 in a period, we include the following event just prior to observing the demand in
period n. Then ρn is realized; if ρn ≤m −2, all units in locations 2 through m −ρn
arrive from the supplier and are at location 1. If ρn = m −1, then no units arrive at
location 1.
It is easy to verify that all the analysis and results that we presented for the “de-
terministic lead time model” hold for the stochastic lead time model described above.
Therefore, echelon base-stock policies are optimal for the single-stage system even
when lead times are stochastic and non-crossing.
6.1.1.4
The Serial Systems Case
The next extension to our analysis is the case of serial systems. In the single-echelon
case, the only location from which a unit could be released using a control policy was
location m + 1. In the multiple echelon case, there are more “physical locations” from
which a unit can be released using the control policy. These physical locations corre-
spond to stages in the production/distribution system. In addition, there may be many
“artiﬁcial locations” between successive stages. The number of these artiﬁcial locations
corresponds to the maximum possible lead time between these stages. We still assume
that orders do not cross. The cost model is the same as discussed in the beginning
of Section 6.1. The optimality of state-dependent echelon base-stock policies can be
veriﬁed by repeating the following arguments, which we used in the analysis of the
single-stage system.
First, the cost for system S is still the sum of the costs for the subsystems because
of the linear cost structure. Second, monotone and committed policies are still optimal.

150
6
Inventory Planning
Third, each subsystem can be operated independently and optimally, which results in
an optimal policy for system S. Fourth, the optimal policy for a subsystem should be
such that if it is optimal to release a unit from a stage or physical location when the
corresponding customer is at a distance y, then it would also be optimal to release the
unit from that stage if the customer were any closer. Consequently, an appropriately
deﬁned critical distance policy is optimal for every subsystem. Now there is a critical
distance corresponding to each stage. When this policy is used for every subsystem, the
resulting policy is a state-dependent echelon base-stock policy for the system S. The
proofs of all these results are identical to the proofs for the corresponding results for
the single-stage system. Consequently, it is clear that echelon base-stock policies are
optimal for serial systems having non-crossing lead times.
In the next section, we discuss how the single-unit, single-customer approach can be
extended to consider a more general demand model and state description.
6.1.1.5
Generalized Demand Model
In the preceding discussion, we assumed that demand was governed by a process in
which demands were independent from period to period. A careful analysis of the ar-
guments indicate that this assumption is unnecessarily restrictive, but was made only to
simplify notation and exposition.
Now suppose that demands are governed by a Markov modulated process. That is,
demand in each period is governed by an exogenous, stationary ergodic Markov chain,
sn. This state of the system is observed at the beginning of each period n. The transition
probabilities for the Markov chain are assumed known. Once sn is given, the probability
distribution of the period n demand random variable, Dn is known. The state of the
system at the beginning of period n is now the vector xn = (sn,(z1n,y1n),(z2n,y2n),...).
The vectors xw
n are deﬁned similarly.
The optimal release strategy is now redeﬁned to include sn. That is R∗
n(sn,y)
⊆{Release, Hold} is the set of optimal decisions for subsystem w at time n when
the state of the exogenous Markov chain is sn and ywn is y and zwn is m+1. The “critical
distance” is also a function of sn. Let
y∗(n,sn) = max{y : R∗
n(sn,y) ⊇{Release}}.
Then y∗(n,sn) is deﬁned so that it is optimal to release unit w if and only if customer
w is at a distance of y∗(n,sn) or closer. Hence the optimal policy is an order-up-to
policy, where in each period we would raise the inventory position to y∗(n,sn)−1. Net
inventory is on-hand minus backorders and the inventory position is the net inventory
plus on-order inventory.

6.1.1.6
Capacity Limitations
Janakiraman and Muckstadt [188] extended the ideas developed earlier to consider ca-
pacity constraints on the order quantities in each period and echelon.
For serial systems consisting of an external supplier, a distribution center and a re-
tailer in which the supplier and distribution center can ship only a maximum of C units
in each period, they show the following results.
First, the optimization problem can be decomposed into C problems, each of which
represents a subsystem consisting of the serial system with a single unit of capacity
at each stage. Second, when the supplier-to-distribution-center and distribution-center-
to-retailer lead times are one period, then the optimal policy is a modiﬁed base-stock
policy at the distribution center and retail levels. That is, order up to the target inventory
position if there is sufﬁcient capacity. Otherwise, order C units. Third, when the two
lead times are now two periods in length, then the optimal policy is called a “two-tier
base-stock policy” at the distribution center and retailer.
This type of policy requires knowing more about the contents and the locations of
the units in the pipeline. The ordering decision then depends on these values. A detailed
description of these results can be found in Janakiraman and Muckstadt [188].
Finally, the same decomposition technique used for the two-echelon system we have
described can be employed to control an M-echelon serial system in which lead times
are of arbitrary length and capacities are identical at all locations. As is the case for the
two-echelon problem, more parameters are required to describe the optimal policy.
Thus complicated extensions to the simple order-up-to policies are required to man-
age capacitated systems optimally.
6.2 Finding Optimal Stock Levels
Now that we have identiﬁed the form of an optimal policy when there are no ﬁxed
ordering costs, let us turn our attention to ﬁnding optimal stock levels. The method we
will discuss in some detail is based on creating a dynamic programming representation
of the decision problem.
6.2.1 Finite Planning Horizon Analysis
Let us assume that our goal is to ﬁnd an optimal order-up-to level for a single item
managed at a single location over a ﬁnite planning horizon consisting of N periods. We

152
6
Inventory Planning
denote the order-up-to level by sn. To begin, we will assume that the order lead time,
τ, is zero. This implies that an order placed in a period is available for use in the same
period. We choose to let τ = 0 only to simplify the discussion. We will show how to
extend the analysis to the more general case where τ is positive. We will see that the
analysis is virtually the same as in the zero lead time case.
Suppose period n events evolve in the following manner. First, we observe the net
inventory (which equals the inventory position since the lead time is zero). Next, we
place an order on an external supplier, which raises the inventory position to sn. Then
the inventory arrives, which raises the net inventory level to sn. Following the arrival of
the inventory we observe the demand that arises for the item. If this demand is less than
the supply, a holding cost of h dollars is charged per unsold unit; if demand exceeds
supply, a shortage or backorder cost of b dollars is assessed per unit short.
Let c represent the unit cost. If the planning horizon is lengthy, we would likely
want to set the values of sn so as to minimize the expected total discounted cost over
the planning horizon. Let α represent the discount factor.
Let Dn be the random variable representing the demand quantity in period n. We
assume that these random variables are independent. We could consider more compli-
cated demand models in our analysis. For example, we could have the process evolve
over time as a Markov modulated process. This would make the values of the order-
up-to levels depend on the state of the demand process as well as the net inventory. We
choose to simplify the discussion by concentrating on this special case. Extentions to
more complicated demand models will become obvious.
The solution procedure begins by considering the decision made in period N. This
is now a single-period problem. The value of s∗
N, an optimal value for sN, is selected to
minimize the holding and backorder costs for the period plus purchase costs. We also
assume that inventory remaining on hand at the end of the horizon is returned to the
supplier, and a credit of c dollars per unit is given. If shortages exist at the end of period
N, we assume we satisfy the excess demand through purchases from the supplier at a
cost of c dollars per unit.
Let gN(y) = total expected discounted cost in period N when
the inventory position (net inventory) is y units before
placing the order in period N.
= purchase cost + expected holding and backorder costs
+ expected discounted purchase or return costs.
Furthermore, let

6.2
Finding Optimal Stock Levels
153
gN+1(y) = −cy.
(6.1)
Hence, if backorders exist at the end of period N (y < 0), we purchase −y units at a cost
of c dollars per unit; if y > 0 we return these units and receive a credit of c per returned
unit.
Then
gN(y) = min
s≥y {c(s−y)+CN(s)+αE[gN+1(s−DN)]},
(6.2)
where
CN(s) = hE[(s−DN)+]+bE[(DN −s)+].
(6.3)
In general let
gn(y) = total expected discounted cost from period n through the end
of the planning horizon when the inventory position (net
inventory in this τ = 0 case) is y units before an order is placed
in period n.
= min
s≥y {c(s−y)+Cn(s)+αE[gn+1(s−Dn)]}
(6.4)
where
Cn(s) = hE[(s−Dn)+]+bE[(Dn −s)+].
(6.5)
We showed in the last chapter that Cn(s) is a convex function of s, and hence CN(s)
is convex. Clearly E[gN+1(s−DN)] is also a convex function of s, as is c(s−y).
Let
Gn(sn) = csn +Cn(sn)+αE[gn+1(sn −Dn)].
(6.6)
Suppose n = N. We can easily see that GN(sN) is a convex function of sN. Let s∗
N be
the smallest optimal solution to minsN GN(sN), which exists and is non-negative for
problems of practical interest.
Returning to the function gN(y), observe that it satisﬁes
gN(y) =
 −cy+GN(s∗
N) if s∗
N ≥y,
−cy+GN(y)
if y > s∗
N.
(6.7)
It is easy to see that gN(y) is a convex function, as illustrated in Figure 6.2.
Furthermore, by induction on n, we conclude that for
gn(y) = min
sn≥y{c(sn −y)+Cn(sn)+αE[gn+1(sn −Dn)]}

n = 1,...,N is also convex in y. This follows immediately since the expectation of a
convex function is convex as well.
Thus this set of relations represented by (6.1) and (6.8) establish a recursive method
that can be used to ﬁnd the optimal order-up-to values. These are called functional
equations since Gn(·) and gn(·) are unknown functions. The solution model we have
described is called a dynamic programming representation of the decision problem.
Let us now return to the oil rig problem that we discussed in the previous chapter.
Recall that in each period a decision must be made as to what amount of inventory to
place on the rig. Let us now assume that all inventory that is unused at the end of a
period remains on the rig, and is refurbished there rather than on shore. This represents
a slight change in the system’s operation from the one discussed in the previous chapter.
Assuming all other data are the same as presented in the previous chapter, we want to
know if the order-up-to policy, with s = 43, is optimal in every period.
When we posed the problem previously, we ignored the potential interaction of de-
cisions among periods. The approach we took led to what is called a myopic policy. By
implementing myopic policies, we focus only on the base-stock policy that minimizes
the current period’s cost while ignoring the impact of the current decision on future de-
cisions and costs. An interesting question is under what conditions are myopic policies
optimal.
Suppose we let ¯sn represent the myopic policy solution for period n and, as before,
let s∗
n represent the optimal solution for period n. Let us ﬁrst assume that the discount
factor, α, is equal to 1. Recall ¯sn is obtained by ﬁnding the smallest value for which
P{Dn ≤sn} ≥b/(b+h). Since we have assumed that the demand distribution is sta-
tionary, as well as that the costs are unchanging over time, we have ¯s1 = ¯s2 = ··· = ¯sN.
By assumption, all demands over the N periods are ultimately satisﬁed, and no extra
inventory is in the system after the end of the horizon, owing to our ability to return
unused inventory. Hence the unit order costs do not come into play when making the

6.2
Finding Optimal Stock Levels
155
inventory decision, and hence these unit costs can be assumed to be 0. This is a con-
sequence of our assuming α = 1. Thus ∑nCn(¯sn) is a lower bound on g1(0), where we
assume there is no inventory on hand initially and c = 0. But this solution provided by
this myopic approach will also yield a feasible solution to the multi-period problem and
hence is optimal.
But suppose α < 1. In this case deﬁne a new, but related set of functions. Let
¯gn(y) = cy+gn(y),
(6.9)
¯c = c(1−α), and
(6.10)
¯Cn(s) = αcµn + ¯cs+Cn(s), where µn = E[Dn].
(6.11)
Then
¯gN+1(y) = 0 and
(6.12)
¯gn(y) = min
s≥y {Gn(s)}, where
(6.13)
Gn(s) = ¯Cn(s)+αE[ ¯gn+1(s−Dn)].
(6.14)
Observe that (6.13) can be written as
¯gn(y) = Gn(max(s∗
n,y)).
Let us now turn our attention to the function ¯Cn(s), the single-period cost function in
our revised model. Now let ¯sn represent the solution to this revised one-period problem.
Then ¯sn is the smallest value of s for which
P{Dn ≤sn} ≥b−¯c
b+h.
An important question remains: how closely related are ¯sn and s∗
n? Let us now answer
this question.
First, how does s∗
N compare with ¯sN? As we will see, s∗
N = ¯sN. Furthermore, in
general s∗
n ≤¯sn. Let us see why this is the case. Let us assume that Dn is a contin-
uous random variable so that s∗
n, ¯sn ∈(−∞,∞). Observe that ¯gn(y) = min
s≥y {Gn(s)} is
non-decreasing in y and therefore E[ ¯gn+1(y −Dn)] is also non-decreasing in y. Re-
call that ¯sn satisﬁes ¯C′
n(¯sn) = 0. Thus G′
n(¯sn) = αE[ ¯g′
n+1(¯sn −Dn)] ≥0, and, in gen-
eral, G′
n(s) ≥¯C′
n(s). Consequently, s∗
n ≤¯sn. Now suppose n = N. Since ¯gN+1(y) = 0,
E[ ¯gN+1(s−DN)] = 0, too, and G′
N(s) = ¯C′
N(s). But ¯C′
N(¯sN) = 0 and therefore G′
N(¯sN) =
0 as well. Thus ¯sN = s∗
N.
This result implies that if we consider the effect of the current decision on future
decisions, we should never select a stock level that exceeds the level found by solving

156
6
Inventory Planning
the corresponding one-period problem. Thus the myopic solutions are always upper
bounds on the optimal solutions.
Second, suppose ¯sn ≤s∗
n+1. Roughly speaking, this implies that the upper tail of the
demand density in period n+ 1 falls to the right of that tail in period n (¯sn ≤¯sn+1). In
this case, s∗
n = ¯sn. But if ¯sn ≥¯sn+1, s∗
n ≥s∗
n+1. To demonstrate that these relationships
are true, recall that ¯gn+1(y) = Gn+1(max(s∗
n+1,y)), which is constant for all values of
y ≤s∗
n+1. Thus for y ≤s∗
n+1, E[ ¯gn+1(y−Dn)] is also a constant (assuming Dn ≥0 with
probability 1). Therefore G′
n(y) = ¯C′
n(y), y ≤s∗
n+1. But ¯C′
n(¯sn) = 0 and hence G′
n(¯sn) = 0,
too, which implies that s∗
n = ¯sn.
When ¯sn ≥¯sn+1, then ¯sn ≥s∗
n+1, too. Thus G′
n(y) = ¯C′
n(y) < 0 when y < s∗
n+1 which
implies s∗
n ≥s∗
n+1.
These observations demonstrate how the myopic and optimal order-up-to values tend
to move together. The optimal value takes into account the risk of having too much
inventory on hand when entering future time periods and hence s∗
n is bounded above
by ¯sn.
Third, s∗
n ≥minm≥n{¯sm}. Thus the period-n optimal stock level is also bounded be-
low. Let us prove this result inductively. When n = N, the result is obvious. Suppose
the result is true for all m > n. When ¯sn ≤minm≥n+1 ¯sm ≤s∗
n+1, then, as shown above,
s∗
n = ¯sn = minm≥n ¯sm. If ¯sn > minm≥n+1 ¯sm, s∗
n ≥s∗
n+1 ≥minm≥n+1 ¯sm = minm≥n ¯sm.
One important observation that is implied by these results is that if ¯s1 ≤¯s2 ≤··· ≤
¯sN, ¯sn = s∗
n for all n = 1,...,N. Thus in this situation the myopic policy solution is
an optimal solution. In fact, myopic policies are often very close, in an expected-cost
sense, to the results obtained when employing the optimal solutions. The variation in
the demand distributions between periods has to be substantial for the values of ¯sn and
s∗
n to deviate dramatically.
Let us now illustrate the results of applying the methodology that we have discussed.
To do this we will consider several examples. In each case the planning horizon will be
5 periods in length. Furthermore, we will assume that the unit cost is the same in all
periods and hence we will ignore the variable procurement costs in our examples.
To begin, let us assume that demand in each period follows a uniform distribution.
Assume that the backorder to holding cost ratio in each period is equal to 10.
In our ﬁrst example, suppose demands are uniformly distributed as given in Table
6.1. Note that the expected demand is increasing over time.
Observe that the myopic order-up-to levels are increasing and therefore, as we have
shown analytically, these levels are optimal.
Suppose the probability distribution for demands in each period are reversed, as
indicated in Table 6.2.
In this case, the myopic order-up-to levels are strictly decreasing. Nonetheless, the
optimal order-up-to levels are still equal to the myopic levels. Even changing the back-

order to holding cost ratio does not alter this result. Thus the myopic solution remains
optimal. Of course, this is not always the case.
Now suppose the demand distribution per period remains uniform but with ranges
indicated in Table 6.3. The optimal solution now differs slightly from the myopic solu-
tion; however, the expected cost of implementing the myopic solution is very close to
that of implementing the optimal solution.

Suppose now that the probability distribution of demand per period is Poisson dis-
tributed. Does this change the results dramatically? Suppose the expected demand per
period is given in Table 6.4. Even though the demand drops substantially between peri-
ods 3 and 4, we see that the myopic policy does not differ dramatically from the optimal
policy. The difference in the cost of using the myopic rather than the optimal policy is
2.892%. This observation holds over a broad range of backorder to holding cost ratios.
But, is this always the case?

Suppose now that the demand per period follows a geometric distribution. Geometric
distributions have heavier upper tails than possessed by Poisson distributions having
the same mean. Hence there is greater risk in stocking inventory when the demand
distribution is a geometric distribution rather than a Poisson distribution.
First, observe in Table 6.5 that the myopic policy yields much larger stock levels
when demand is geometrically distributed in each period. As mentioned, this is the case
since the geometric has a heavier tail than the Poisson distribution having the same
mean. Second, note that the optimal order-up-to levels differ substantially from the
myopic order-up-to levels in periods 2 and 3. The expected cost of following a myopic
policy rather than an optimal policy increases cost by 8.205%. Hence, in this case, we
see that myopic policies are not as effective as in the other situations. Nonetheless, the
cost difference is not too great.

6.2.2 Constant, Positive Lead Time Case
To this point we have assumed that τ = 0. Suppose that τ is now some positive inte-
gral number of periods in length. In this case, there can be both on-order and on-hand
inventory. Hence purchasing decisions must be based on the inventory position at the
beginning of a period rather than on the amount of net inventory. Inventory purchased
in period n arrives at the beginning of period n+ τ. Hence the inventory order placed
in period n has no impact on costs incurred for holding and backorders in periods n

160
6
Inventory Planning
through n + τ −1. The optimal order-up-to level in a period must reﬂect the need for
stock over periods n through n+ τ plus any impact on periods following period n+ τ.
The myopic policy approach would consider only demand over periods n through n+τ,
that is, over the subsequent τ + 1 periods. The probability distributions used to calcu-
late ¯sn and s∗
n are the distributions for the cumulative demand over the subsequent τ +1
periods. To be speciﬁc when τ = 0 we saw that only period n’s demand was needed
to compute ¯Cn(·). When τ > 0, we need to consider the total demand over the τ + 1
periods, n through n+ τ, when determining ¯Cn(·). Thus the random variable Dn must
capture total demand in periods n through n + τ. With this change, the analysis we
presented for the τ = 0 case extends exactly to the τ > 0 case.
We note that the planning horizon of length N corresponds to the periods in which
procurement orders are placed for an item. The periods in which the effect of these
decisions is observed are periods τ + 1 through τ + N in the future, again a horizon
of length N. Costs incurred from periods 1 through τ are not affected by the ordering
decisions and hence can be ignored in the analysis. Of course, the inventory position at
the beginning of period 1 must be taken into account when placing orders.
6.2.3 End-of-Horizon Effects
An important question that always arises is how large must N be. In our model we as-
sumed that gN+1(y) = −cy. Any assumption made about the functional form of gN+1(y)
may affect the value of s∗
1, the value that tells us what to do now. In practice, procure-
ment decisions do not terminate at the end of a ﬁnite horizon. N is chosen to be small
because estimating demand (and costs) accurately over time is difﬁcult to do. Compu-
tational requirements increase with N, too. Thus the dynamic program is not solved
once and the values of the s∗
n implemented throughout the planning horizon. Rather the
model is solved each period as time evolves. This so-called rolling planning horizon
approach is employed to ensure future changes in the estimates of demand and costs
are reﬂected in current decisions. While it is desirable to choose the planning horizon
length so that current decisions are not sensitive to the end-of-horizon cost assumptions,
the length is often dictated by the availability of accurate estimates of future costs and
demands. More will be said about dealing with end-of-horizon effects at the end of the
following section.

6.2.4 Inﬁnite-Horizon Analysis
Now that we have examined the ﬁnite-horizon case, let us turn our attention to an
inﬁnite-horizon planning problem. Although we shall not prove it, an order-up-to policy
is optimal in the inﬁnite-horizon case, too. Assume, as we did in our study of determin-
istic models, that demand and cost parameters are stationary over an inﬁnite horizon. In
this case we assume that the demand random variables are independent and identically
distributed across periods.
Let D represent the random variable for demand over τ + 1 periods. Let us present
some useful nomenclature. Let
¯c = (1−α)c, where c is the unit cost, α is the discount factor and
¯C(y) = αcµ + ¯cy+C(y),
where µ is the expected demand over τ +1 periods, and
C(y) = h·E([y−D]+)+b·E([D−y]+).
The parameter s represents the order-up-to level, or stock level, which is the inventory
position achieved upon ordering in a period. The optimal value of s, which we denote
by s∗, is the smallest value of s that minimizes ¯C(y), that is,
P[D ≤s∗] = −¯c+b
b+h ,
when D is a continuous random variable measuring demand over τ +1 periods, or s∗is
the smallest value of s for which
P[D ≤s∗] ≥−¯c+b
b+h
when D is a discrete random variable measuring demand over τ + 1 periods. As dis-
cussed in the ﬁnite-horizon case, s∗is the myopic order-up-to or base stock level. The
question then is how s∗compares with the optimal order-up-to level. We state the fol-
lowing theorem without proof.
Theorem 6.3. When the costs and demand processes are stationary, s∗is also the opti-
mal order-up-to level.
Thus it is easy to calculate the optimal solution for this case. Furthermore, the opti-
mal order quantity in a period is simply the demand in the previous period! Note that

162
6
Inventory Planning
this is not the case when the planning horizon is ﬁnite and the demand process is not
stationary.
Suppose α = 1. This is called the average cost case. Then ¯c = 0 and ¯C(y) = cµ +
C(y), and, in the continuous demand case, s∗is the smallest value of s for which
P[D ≤s] =
b
b+h.
The value ¯C(s∗) is the optimal average cost per period. In the case where α < 1, the
optimal expected discounted cost over the inﬁnite planning horizon is ¯C(s∗)/(1−α),
assuming the starting inventory level is less than or equal to s∗.
Suppose the demands and costs are not stationary over time. Again an order-up-to
policy remains optimal.
In our discussion at the beginning of this section we noted that D represents demand
over τ + 1 periods. Suppose τ is three weeks in length and a period is one week in
length. Then D represents the demand over the four-week horizon. Suppose that each
week of this four-week horizon has a different distribution, although independent of the
others. Let us assume, for simplicity, that a month consists of four weeks and that D1,
D2, D3, and D4 are the random variables corresponding to the demand in each of the
four weeks. Then D = ∑4
i=1 Di.
Although the distribution of demand for each week individually may be different,
the distribution of D is stationary. Hence the order-up-to values are also stationary.
In the preceding section we observed that the end-of-horizon cost function gN+1(y)
can affect the choice of s∗
1 as well as other values of s∗
n. One way to deal with this
problem is as follows.
Suppose α < 1. For periods 1 through N, solve the problem as discussed earlier
with one exception. Estimate a distribution of lead time demand that is expected to
occur in future periods. Use this distribution to compute the expected inﬁnite-horizon
discounted cost as a function of the ending inventory position. This provides us with a
way to compute gN+1(y) that will not ignore the future beyond period N.
6.2.5 Lost Sales
Our analysis in this chapter has been based on the assumption that all demand in excess
of supply is backordered. Clearly, in many, if not most, situations experienced in life this
assumption is not satisﬁed. So why make this assumption? The answer to this question
is simple. First, the form of the optimal operating policy is not trivial. It is not a simple
order-up-to policy even when ﬁxed ordering costs are negligible. Second, even if an

6.3
Capacity Limited Systems
163
approximate order-up-to policy is followed, computing these values is time-consuming
except when lead time demand is low and lead times are relatively short.
In the complete backordering case, the inventory position in a period determines the
order quantity. This occurs because the net inventory at the end of a period a lead time in
the future is equal to sn −Dn, where sn is the inventory position following the placement
of an order in period n and Dn is the total demand for periods n through n+τ. But this
need not be the case, and in the lost sales case is not likely to be the case, when the
variance in the demand per period is substantial and demand in excess of supply is lost.
As a consequence, the construction of the dynamic program employed in the lost
sales case to ﬁnd the optimal order-up-to values (not the optimal order quantities) must
take into account a more elaborate description of the state space than required in the
backorder situation. In the backorder case only the inventory position must be known.
In the lost sales case we must know how much is on hand, what inventory will arrive
in this period and throughout the remaining periods within the lead time. If all the
inventory comprising the inventory position at the beginning of period n, call it y, is on
hand, then the expected holding and lost sales cost incurred at the end of period n+ τ
is h · E[(y −Dn)+] + b · E[(Dn −y)+]. Here b measures the lost sales cost per unit of
demand that is not satisﬁed and includes lost revenue margin as well as any other costs
associated with losing the sale. On the other hand, if all y units are ordered in period n
and there is nothing on hand or that will be received over the subsequent τ −1 periods,
then the expected cost is quite different. All demands in the next τ −1 periods are lost.
The net inventory at the end of period n + τ would equal y minus only the demand
occuring in period n+τ.
When lead times are lengthy and the amount ordered in each period can vary sub-
stantially the size of the state space (the current net inventory and the amounts due
to arrive in each subsequent period) becomes enormous. Thus solving the resulting
dynamic program is computationally intractable since the size of the state space deter-
mines the amount of required computation. The explosion of the size of the state space
and its impact on the computational requirements is called the curse of dimensionality.
We leave the construction of a dynamic programming model for lost sales environ-
ments as an exercise.
6.3 Capacity Limited Systems
The analyses presented earlier in this chapter were based on the premise that the resup-
ply systems had a reliable source of material (constant lead times).
We will now study a situation in which resupply is limited by a capacitated resource.
The presence of capacity alters the method of analysis substantially.

Inventory Planning
6.3.1 The Shortfall Distribution
Let us introduce several important ideas by examining a simple capacity limited pro-
duction facility. Production decisions are made in each period of an inﬁnite planning
horizon. There is only one item being produced and demands for this item are indepen-
dent and identically distributed from period to period.
Assume that the system operates in the following manner. At the start of a period
we observe the demand for the single item. On the basis of that period’s demand and
the item’s current net inventory level, a production quantity is determined. Production
then takes place. The production quantity is limited to a maximum of C units, the facil-
ity’s per period production capacity. Whenever the demand exceeds C plus the on-hand
stock, we assume the unsatisﬁed demand is backordered. On the other hand, if the de-
mand is less than C plus the on-hand stock, then all customers are satisﬁed. After this
production occurs, shipments are made to customers. The ﬁnal act in a period is to
charge holding and backorder costs of h and b dollars per unit held or backordered,
respectively.
The optimal policy for managing this system is a modiﬁed version of the order-
up-to policy or base-stock policy, as discussed earlier in this chapter. Suppose s is our
target inventory level. The modiﬁed base-stock policy states that we should produce to
have s units on hand after satisfying demand if capacity permits; otherwise, produce
C units, the system’s production capacity. As long as there is a positive probability
that demand in a period can exceed C units, there is a positive probability that the
production capacity in a period is not sufﬁcient to raise the period ending inventory to
s. The amount by which s exceeds the actual period ending inventory level is called the
shortfall. The shortfall is a random variable. Our ﬁrst goal is to show how to compute
its distribution.
Then we will show how this distribution is used to develop a model for making pro-
duction decisions. We will ﬁrst show some general properties of this shortfall random
variable and then focus on the case where demand is described by a discrete demand
distribution. Note that if C = ∞, then there is never any shortfall. In this case, given the
timing of events, s = 0 would be optimal.
6.3.1.1
General Properties
Let Vn represent the random variable for the shortfall in period n. We assume that the
expected per period demand is strictly less than C. If this is not the case, then the
backorder quantity will grow without bound as n →∞with probability 1. Suppose now
that Dn measures the demand in period n. Since E[Dn] < C for all n, and the random

6.3
Capacity Limited Systems
165
variables Dn are independent and identically distributed, a stationary distribution exists
for the shortfall process. Let V represent this random variable. Thus, in steady state,
V = s−I, where I is the period ending net inventory level.
Fig. 6.3. System evolution of net inventory.
Recall the sequence of events that occur in period n. The initial net inventory In is
equal to s−Vn−1. Demand is observed, that is, Dn is observed. A production quantity is
then determined which equals min{C,Vn−1 +Dn}. Note that if Vn−1 > s, then (Vn−1 −s)
backorders exist at the beginning of period n. At the end of period n, the net inventory
is s−Vn. If this quantity is positive, then there is stock on hand and is charged a holding
cost of h dollars per unit; if negative, then there are backorders which are charged at
a cost of b dollars per unit backordered. Figure 6.3 illustrates the evolution of the net
inventory random variable.
Observe that
Vn = [Vn−1 +Dn −C]+ .
(6.15)
That is, if the capacity is large enough to satisfy both the entering shortfall plus the
current period’s demand, then Vn = 0; otherwise, Vn equals the difference between the
total requirement (Vn−1 +Dn) and the production capacity (C).

166

Inventory Planning
We observe that Vn is independent of the target stock level s. Equation (6.15) de-
scribes the period-to-period dynamic behavior of the shortfall random variable. This
behavior of Vn is illustrated in Figure 6.4.
Fig. 6.4. Inventory shortfall.
6.3.2 Discrete Demand Case
Assume V0 = 0. Observe from (6.15) that Vn depends only on Vn−1 and Dn. That is, it
does not depend on V0,...,Vn−2. Hence we can model the transitions of the shortfall
process as a Markov chain. Speciﬁcally the transition probabilities for this chain are as
follows:
pij ≡P{Vn = j|Vn−1 = i} =



P{D ≤C −i},
j = 0 and i ≤C,
P{D = C +(j −i)}, j > 0,i ≤C + j,
0,
otherwise.

6.3
Capacity Limited Systems
167
Let P = [pij] be the matrix of transition probabilities. Since we assume that E[D] <
C, a steady state distribution exists for the random variable, V, since the chain is ergodic.
Let the stationary distribution that V = i be denoted by πi, and π the vector whose ith
component is πi. Then π solves
πP = π,
∑πi = 1,
πi ≥0.
For practical situations, the matrix P and the corresponding vector π can be truncated to
yield a ﬁnite system of equations. Some testing needs to be done to insure that accuracy
is not sacriﬁced. The truncation process will depend on the difference between C and
E(D) and the variance of the demand process.

Table 6.6. Expected shortfall and standard deviation of shortfall for various combinations of capacity
utilization and demand variation.
Suppose C varies from period to period. Speciﬁcally, suppose C is a random variable
that is independent and identically distributed from period to period. We assume that
E[D] < E[C]. In this case, we can again represent the transitions of the shortfall process
as a Markov chain. The process remains ergodic so that a stationary distribution will
exist. In this case, the transition probabilities are given by

(6.16)
In many cases the capacity is a random variable. If capacity can vary signiﬁcantly from
period to period, then the target stock level can increase substantially.
Let us now illustrate how the steady state shortfall distribution of V behaves for
different levels of demand variation and available capacity. We assume that the expected
demand per period is 100 units in all cases. We further assume the capacity C does
not vary from period to period. Table 6.6 shows how both the expected value of V
and standard deviation of V change for 20 combinations of the per period variance of
demand and the amount of available per period capacity.
These data show how sensitive the mean and standard deviations of V are to changes
in these values, and hence how inventory requirements will also depend on these values.
Additionally, Figures 6.5–6.10 provide the probability distributions for V for certain
cases. Figures 6.5–6.7 contain plots of the distribution of V when the variance of the de-
mand is set to 101 and when the capacity utilization rate assumes three different values:

.833, .952, and .99. Similarly, Figures 6.8–6.10 show the probability distributions for
V when the variance of demand per period is 2000, again for the same three different
amounts of available capacity. Note how the shapes of the distributions are affected by
the variance of the demand process and the utilization rate. Furthermore, note how the
tails of the distributions behave.
6.3.3 An Example
Let us return to our oil rig example. Let us assume that regular replenishment of the
item to the oil rig is limited to C units. In addition, assume that each unused unit held
in inventory at the end of a period is maintained on the oil rig and the cost of doing so
plus other holding costs are estimated to be h dollars per unit. Each unit short incurs a
shortage cost estimated to be b dollars. Now there is no emergency resupply available
so the only replenishment of stock is the regular replenishment that occurs each period.
The system operates as follows. At the beginning of a period we request a shipment
from the on shore stock. The goal is to raise the on rig stock to s units. If there is not

172
6
Inventory Planning
sufﬁcient space to send all the desired units, then only C units are placed on the vessel
used to resupply the oil rig.
Note that this system differs from the one discussed in the preceding section since
the sequence of events is not the same. Here we must make a decision on how much to
order prior to knowing the amount of the demand in the period.
Assuming C > E[D], where D is the random variable describing demand in each
period, then a stationary distribution exists for the shortfall random variable. In this
case, the shortfall in period n satisﬁes
Vn = [Vn−1 +Dn−1 −C]+,
where Vn is the shortfall prior to the demand occuring in period n. Since the distribution
of demand in periods n−1 and n are identical, the stationary distribution is identical to
the one developed in the last section.
Our goal is to ﬁnd s∗, the optimal base stock level, given the capacity limitations of C
units. Suppose y units are on hand on the oil rig after the resupply delivery is received.
Then the expected cost will be
hE[(y−D)+]+bE[(D−y)+].
But the value of y depends on s and the shortfall. Suppose the shortfall is i units. Then
y = s−i. Since the shortfall random variable assumes the value of i with probability πi,
the expected cost per period is given by
F(s) = ∑
i
{hE[(s−i−D)+]+bE[(D−(s−i))+]}πi.
To ﬁnd the optimal value of s we ﬁrst note that F(s) is a convex function in s, whose
proof we leave as an exercise. Then, when we have a discrete random variable describ-
ing demand, s∗is the smallest value of s for which
∆F(s) = F(s+1)−F(s) ≥0.
In this case
F(s) = ∑

6.4 A Serial System
Again let us consider the oil rig problem. But this time we will consider the interaction
between the onshore stocking facility and the oil rig. The problem scenario is as follows.
Each period both the oil rig and onshore facility will place orders. The oil rig re-
quests inventory from the onshore facility and the onshore facility from an external
supplier. The external supplier is assumed to have an inﬁnite amount of stock available.
The replenishment lead time to the oil rig from the onshore facility is assumed to be
negligible, that is, this lead time is zero. The lead time to resupply from the external
supplier is assumed to be τ periods in length.
We will study two scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario, we assume that the demand pro-
cess on the oil rig is non-stationary, but independent from period to period. We will also
assume that τ = 0. In the second scenario we assume demand on the oil rig is indepen-
dent and identically distributed from period to period. Furthermore, we will assume τ
is positive.
Our goals are to demonstrate the difference between stocking inventory at the two
facilities on system cost and service, to show how to construct appropriate cost models
in each case, and to present algorithms for calculating optimal ordering policies. Earlier
in this chapter we discussed the optimality of order-up-to or base-stock policies for this
type of system when there are no ﬁxed ordering costs. Hence we assume such policies
are followed at each location.
For ease of exposition, let us denote the onshore facility as facility 2 and the oil
rig as facility 1. Subscripts on costs and performance measures will be either 1 or 2,
corresponding to the appropriate location.
Let us begin by discussing the costs. Carrying costs are incurred on the basis of on-
hand inventory at locations 1 and 2. We have assumed that the delivery time from the
onshore facility to the oil rig is very short. In general, if the delivery time were lengthy,
we would also charge holding costs to the in-transit stock between these locations.

174
6
Inventory Planning
Let h1 and h2 measure the holding cost per unit incurred at the end of a period at the
two locations.
Note that shortages at each location play different roles in the system. Shortages on
the oil rig imply that there is a true economic penalty incurred, which we assume is
proportional to the number of non-functioning units (backorders).
On the other hand, a shortage at the onshore facility incurs no direct shortage cost. A
shortage there implies that the order placed by the oil rig is not satisﬁed in its entirety.
Hence if the number of backorders at facility 2 is x units, then these x units were ordered
by 1 but not shipped or received on time. The implication of 2’s not fulﬁlling 1’s order
is that facility 1 will incur expected shortage costs incremental to those that would have
been anticipated if the order had been satisﬁed completely on time. Let b represent the
shortage cost incurred per unit at facility 1, which is charged at the end of a period.
We will conduct our analysis of this system using echelon stock concepts, which
were ﬁrst introduced in Chapter 3. There are two possible and related views of system
control mechanisms. In the ﬁrst view, we consider stock levels and costs at each loca-
tion as if the system operates in a decentralized manner. In the second, we consider a
centralized view based on echelon stocks. In our case, the oil rig echelon inventory posi-
tion measures its on-hand plus on-order less backorder position. The echelon inventory
position for facility 2 considers this stock plus what it has on hand plus on order.
The echelon holding costs are related to installation-based costs. The cost h′
2, the
echelon holding cost for facility 2, is charged on all units in the entire system, as it was
in Chapter 3. Note that h′
2 = h2. But h′
1, the echelon holding cost at facility 1, measures
the incremental holding cost due to the placement of the unit on the oil rig rather than
on shore. Note that h′
1 = h1 −h′2 = h1 −h2.
We will proceed as follows. After some introductory comments, we will construct
a cost model along with a computational procedure that can be employed to ﬁnd the
optimal stocking policy.
6.4.1 An Echelon-Based Approach for Managing Inventories in Serial
Systems
The system we will examine ﬁrst consists of two facilities, the onshore facility and the
oil rig. Our goal is to ﬁnd the echelon order-up-to or echelon base stock levels for these
locations in each of N time periods so that the total expected cost over the planning
horizon is minimized.
To simplify our notation and to make the discussion easier to understand, we will
assume that the lead time from the external supplier to the onshore facility is negligible.
That is, we assume that τ = 0.

6.4
A Serial System
175
As stated, the planning horizon is ﬁnite in length. We assume that at the end of the
planning horizon any on-hand inventory can be returned to the external supplier and
that the inventory can be returned to the external supplier and that the supplier will
refund the original purchase price for each returned unit. If backorders exist at the end
of the planning horizon, the external supplier will immediately provide inventory to ﬁll
the previously unsatisﬁed demand. Furthermore, these units will be purchased at the
normal cost per unit. We will also not discount cost over time. On the basis of these
assumptions, we can assume that the unit purchase cost is zero.
The costs considered when making the procurement and allocation decisions are
holding and backorder costs. Thus, the goal is to minimize the total expected holding
and backorder costs for the two facilities over the planning horizon.
As mentioned, demand on the oil rig will be non-stationary over time. We let Dn
represent the random variable for oil rig demand in period n, n = 1,...,N.
We will assume events in period n occur in the following sequence. First, each fa-
cility places an order on its supplier. The onshore facility orders a quantity q2n from
the external supplier. The oil rig orders q1n units from the onshore facility. Next, each
facility receives the stock it ordered from its supplier. None of these q2n units received
at the onshore facility is available for shipment to the oil rig in period n, however.
Finally demand occurs during period n at the oil rig. Holding and/or backorder costs
are incurred, depending on the amount of net inventory at each facility at the end of
period n.
6.4.1.1
A Decision Model
Let us introduce some additional notation. Let Iin measure the echelon inventory po-
sition at facility i, i = 1,2, at the beginning of period n. Since the lead times are zero
in length, Iin also measures the echelon net inventory at facility i at the beginning of
period n. Since we are measuring echelon inventory position,
I1n = on-hand inventory on the oil rig−backorders on the oil rig
and
I2n = on-hand inventory at the onshore facility +I1n.
Note that if lead times are positive, then in-transit inventories to each facility would be
added to these echelon inventory positions.
Also, observe that the net on-hand inventory at the onshore facility at the beginning
of period n is I2n −I1n, which is a non-negative quantity. The dynamics of the echelon
inventory are as follows:

176
6
Inventory Planning
I1,n+1 = I1n +q1n −Dn
and
I2,n+1 = I2n +q2n −Dn.
Hence, Iin is a random variable, and the costs incurred over time are not known with
certainty. As mentioned earlier, our goal is to establish a policy that minimizes the
total expected costs of holding inventory and responding to shortages over the N period
planning horizon.
These expected costs incurred in period n are expressed as follows:
h1E[(I1n +q1n −Dn)+]+bE[(Dn −I1n −q1n)+]+h2(I2n +q2n −I1n −q1n).
Let us deﬁne two cost expressions. The reason for deﬁning them as we do will
become clearer as we proceed.
First, let
C2n(y) = h2y
and
C1n(y) = h1E[(y−Dn)+]+bE[(Dn −y)+]−h2y.
Next, let
yin = Iin +qin,
i = 1,2.
Then the period n expected cost expression can be written as
C1n(y1n)+h2y1n +h2(y2n −y1n) = C1n(y1n)+C2n(y2n).
We will now show that this representation of the expected one-period costs provides the
basis for ﬁnding the optimal ordering policy.
6.4.1.2
A Dynamic Programming Formulation of the Decision Problem
To obtain the optimal ordering policy, we will formulate the decision problem as a
dynamic programming problem. Using this formulation, we will establish a key result
that was ﬁrst proven by Clark and Scarf [70].

6.4
A Serial System
177
Let Vn(I1n,I2n) represent the minimum expected cost incurred from period n through
the end of the planning horizon, given that I1n and I2n are the echelon inventory positions
at the beginning of period n for the onshore and oil rig facilities, respectively. Then
Vn(I1n,I2n) = minC1n(y1n)+C2n(y2n)+E[Vn+1(y1n −Dn,y2n −Dn)]
subject to
I2n ≤y2n
I1n ≤y1n ≤I2n.
(6.17)
What we will now show is that there exist functions f1n and f2n such that
Vn(I1n,I2n) = f1n(I1n)+ f2n(I2n).
(6.18)
As a consequence, we will show that it is possible to independently ﬁnd the optimal
ordering policy for each facility. That is, we can ﬁnd the best policy for the oil rig and
onshore facilities by solving two independent problems, one for each facility.
Let
f2n(I2n) = min
y2n≥I2nC2n(y2n)+E[ f2,n+1(y2n −Dn)]+∆2n(I2n),
(6.19)
for n = 1,...,N. If I2n is too small, then y1n may be smaller than the oil rig would desire
it to be, and hence additional expected costs may be incurred. The function ∆2n(I2n)
measures the expected incremental costs induced on the oil rig as a consequence of the
value of I2n.
Let
f1n(I1n) = min
y1n≥I1nC1n(y1n)+E[ f1,n+1(y1n −Dn)],
(6.20)
for n = 1,...,N. Observe that problem (6.20) is exactly the type studied in Section 6.2.
Suppose y∗
1n is the optimal value for y1n. Furthermore, let ˆy1n = argminy1n

C1n(y1n)+
E[ f1,n+1(y1n −Dn)]
	
. Given ˆy1n, we can compute the value of ∆2n(I2n). If I2n ≥ˆy1n, then
the oil rig is able to raise its on-hand inventory to the level that minimizes its expected
current and future costs. However, when ˆy1n > I2n, the oil rig’s inventory will be equal
to I2n because f1n(·) is convex. When ˆy1n > I2n, the expected incremental cost is equal
to the difference between the expected cost incurred at the oil rig when y1n = I2n and
the expected cost when y1n = ˆy1n, that is,
{C1n(I2n)+E[ f1,n+1(I2n −Dn)]}−{C1n(ˆy1n)+E[ f1,n+1(ˆy1n −Dn)]}.
In summary, the expected incremental cost function is

if ˆy1n ≤I2n,
C1n(I2n)+E[ f1,n+1(I2n −Dn)]
−C1n(ˆy1n)−E[ f1,n+1(ˆy1n −Dn)] otherwise.
(6.21)
We will now use an induction argument to prove that
Vn(I1n,I2n) = f1n(I1n)+ f2n(I2n),
where f1n(I1n) and f2n(I2n) are deﬁned in (6.19) and (6.20).
Recall that we assumed that all excess inventory at the end of the planning hori-
zon would be returned to an external supplier and that the supplier will reimburse the
company at the original purchase price per unit for units returned to it. Similarly, any
shortages existing at the end of period N will be satisﬁed with purchases made at the
normal price per backordered unit. As a consequence,
VN+1(·,·) = 0.
Thus,
VN(I1N,I2N) = min{C1N(y1N)+C2N(y2N) : I2N ≤y2N,I1N ≤y1N ≤I2N}
= min
y2N≥I2NC2N(y2N)+∆2n(I2n)+ min
y1N≥I1NC1N(y1N),
where we assume that we have computed ˆy1n separately so that ∆2n(I2n) is well-deﬁned.
But
f2N(I2N) = min
y2N≥I2NC2N(y2N)+∆2n(I2n)
and
f1N(I1N) = min
y1N≥I1NC1N(y1N)
so we have
VN(I1N,I2N) = f1N(I1N)+ f2N(I2N)
and the decomposition exists for period N.
Assume, now, that Vn+1(I1,n+1,I2,n+1) = f1,n+1(I1,n+1)+ f2,n+1(I2,n+1). We want to
show that we can express Vn(I1n,I2n) similarly. For period n, we have

Let us consider two cases. In case one, we suppose that ˆy1n ≤I2n. Clearly, we have
∆2n(I2n) = 0. The expected cost incurred on the oil rig is not affected by the constraint
y1n ≤I2n. However, for case two, ˆy1n > I2n, and so ∆2n(I2n) ̸= 0. We have
Vn(I1n,I2n) = min
y2n≥I2nC2n(y2n)+E[ f2,n+1(y2n −Dn)]+∆2n(I2n)
+ min
y1n≥I1nC1n(y1n)+E[ f1,n+1(y1n −Dn)]

Thus, in both cases we have
Vn(I1n,I2n) = f1n(I1n)+ f2n(I2n) .
(6.22)
This proof can be extended to serial systems containing more than two facilities.
When there are M facilities, then Vn(¯In) can be written as the sum of M functions,
f1(I1n),..., fM(IMn), where ¯In is a vector of M echelon stock levels at the beginning of
period N, Ijn, j = 1,...,M. Each function corresponds to a facility upstream of the ﬁnal
facility, that is, the one that serves customers. Each function f jn(Ijm), for j = 2,...,M
has the form of (6.19), in which the ∆jn(Ijn) are computed as in (6.21).

6.4.1.3
An Algorithm for Computing Optimal Echelon Stock Levels
We have demonstrated that Vn(I1n,I2n) can be expressed as the sum of two functions,
each of which is a function of a single variable. When showing that this is possible, we
also established the basis for an algorithm that can be used to ﬁnd the optimal operating
policy for each facility in the system. Let us now formally state this algorithm.
Algorithm for Finding the Optimal Operating Policy
Step 1: Begin with the oil rig (customer serving location). For all n, n = 1,...,N, ﬁnd
ˆy1n. Begin with period N and work backwards to ﬁnd ˆy11. When I1n > ˆy1n, y∗
1n = I1n;
otherwise, y∗
1n = ˆy1n.
Step 2: Given the values of ˆy1n, calculate ∆2n(I2n), n = 1,...,N, for all I2n ≤ˆy1n.
(We do not need to consider I2n ≥ˆy1n since ∆2n(I2n) = 0 in these cases.) Again, be-
gin with period N and work backwards until ∆21(I21) is determined.
Step 3: Solve problem (6.19), n = 1,...,N, given the values of ∆2n(I2n) computed
in Step 2. Begin with period N and work backward until the solution is obtained for
period 1.
This algorithm could be extended for any serial system problem. We leave the de-
velopment of this extension as an exercise.
6.4.1.4
Solving the Oil Rig Problem: The Stationary Demand Case
Finding an optimal echelon stocking policy for the onshore facility and oil rig is some-
what easier than we have described when the demand process at the oil rig is stationary.
Here the goal is to ﬁnd y∗
1 and y∗
2, which are the optimal echelon stock levels for the oil
rig and onshore facility, respectively, for all N periods.
Recall that the lead time for the onshore facility is τ periods in length. In the previous
sections, we assumed τ = 0; we must modify the analysis we presented slightly to
account for τ being positive. Also, since the demand process is stationary, a myopic
policy is also the optimal policy. This observation greatly simpliﬁes our analysis.
Let C2(y) = h2E(y −¯D), where ¯D is the random variable corresponding to the
demand over τ periods. Notice that this deﬁnition is different from the previous
formulation of the problem; the reasons for the difference will become clear shortly.
Let C1(y) = h1E[(y−D)+] + bE[(D −y)+] −h2y, where D is the random variable for
demand occurring in one period. Then

6.5
Exercises
181
{C1(y1)+h2y1}+{h2E(y2 −¯D)−h2y1} = C1(y1)+C2(y2)
is the expected cost incurred per period.
Suppose the onshore facility echelon stock is y2. Then after τ + 1 periods, the ech-
elon inventory position random variable, I2, which measures the inventory available to
supply the oil rig, is equal to y2 −D1, where D1 is the demand over the lead time plus
one period. This is the case because we have assumed that inventory arriving to the
onshore facility in a period is not available to send to the oil rig in that period.
The value of y∗
1 is found by determining the argminC1(y). Once this value is com-
puted, we can ﬁnd the value of ∆2(I2) = ∆2(y2 −d), where d = y2 −I2 is the re-
alized demand over τ + 1 periods. If I2 ≥y∗
1, then ∆2(I2) = 0; otherwise, ∆2(I2) =
C1(I2)−C1(y∗
1).
To ﬁnd y∗
2, we solve the following problem:
minC2(y)+E[∆(y−D1)].
This formulation accounts for the incremental expected cost incurred by the oil rig as a
consequence of the echelon stock policy followed at the onshore facility. In summary,
the algorithm for ﬁnding the optimal echelon stock levels is as follows:
Algorithm for Determining Optimal Oil Rig and Onshore Echelon Stock Levels
Step 1: Find y∗
1, the smallest optimal solution to
minC1(y).
Step 2: For all I2 < y∗
1, calculate
∆2(I2) = C1(I2)−C1(y∗
1).
Step 3: Find y∗
2, the smallest optimal solution to
minC2(y)+E[∆2(y−D1)].

programming model and corresponding recursions.
6.4. Llenroc Electronics repairs components found in radar sets for the Air Force. One
particular component in the radar set is costly and fails frequently. When Llenroc re-
ceives failed parts it is not capable of repairing all of them. Units awaiting repair are
called reparables. By policy, Llenroc attempts to maintain a stock of serviceable units
that can be sent to the Air Force when a defective part arrives to be repaired or scrapped.
In each period, Llenroc can purchase new components from the manufacturer. To sim-
plify the situation, assume both the lead time from the manufacturer and the repair lead
times are negligible. In each period, Llenroc must decide how many units to purchase
from the supplier, how many of the available reparables to repair, and how many ser-
viceable and reparables to scrap. Assume demand for replacement components placed
in each period follows a Poisson distribution whose mean can ﬂuctuate over time. Fur-
ther assume that the cost data imply that it is best to repair before purchasing and to
scrap reparables before serviceable units. Let sn be the on-hand serviceable stock level
after the repair, procurement and scrapping decisions are made in period n of an N pe-
riod planning horizon. In each period the beginning state of the system indicates the
number of serviceables and reparables on hand. Demand arises at the beginning of each
period followed by the repair, purchasing or scrapping decision. If demand exceeds
supply, a backorder cost is incurred at the rate of b dollars per unit. Supply in excess of
demand incurs holding costs of h1 and h2 for serviceables and reparables, respectively.

6.5. Let us consider the oil rig example discussed in Section 6.4. In that example, there
are two stages, the onshore and oil rig facilities. Let us assume that an order placed
by the material clerk on the oil rig at the beginning of a period nominally arrives at
the beginning of the next period at the oil rig. We say nominally, because the quantity
ordered can only be shipped if there is enough stock on hand at the onshore warehouse
to satisfy the order. Orders placed by the onshore facility in the beginning of a period
arrive there two periods later.
The cost to hold a unit at the end of a period at the onshore facility is $1. The
installation holding cost for a unit held at the end of a period on the oil rig is $2. The
backorder cost on the oil rig is $20 per unit per period.
The demand per period is either 0,1, or 2 units with probabilities .3, .5, .2 respec-
tively. Demands are independent from period to period.
Determine the optimal stocking levels (echelon inventory position) for each facility.
6.6. In Section 6.3 we developed an expression for the expected cost per period, F(s).
Prove that F(s) is a convex function.
6.7. In Section 6.2 we discussed the difference between the lost sales and the backorder
cases. Suppose the lead time is two periods. Construct a dynamic programming model
that can be used to ﬁnd the optimal solution to the lost sales problem in this case. Use
the notation found in Section 6.2 when developing your answer.
6.8. Suppose demands over an inﬁnite planning horizon are independent and identically
distributed from period to period. Assume the production and inventory system operates
in the manner described in Section 6.3.1. Assume production capacity in each period is
2 units. The demand is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 units per period with probabilities .2, .3, .3,
and .2, respectively. Construct the shortfall probability distribution.
6.9. Suppose in the previous problem that capacity is one unit with probability .1, two
units with probability .8, and three units with probability .1. Construct the shortfall
probability distribution.
6.10. Find the optimal stock level for the situation described in Problem 6.8, assuming
a shortage cost of $1,000 and a holding cost of $100 per unit per period.

Background Concepts: An Introduction to the
(s−1,s) Policy under Poisson Demand
In the previous chapter we studied order-up-to policies when time was divided into
periods. We will now discuss the implications of following a similar policy, called an
(s−1,s) inventory policy. In this chapter we assume inventories are reviewed continu-
ously in time. Recall that the stock level, s, measures the amount of inventory on hand
plus on order minus backorders, that is, the stock level represents the inventory position
for a particular location. In certain situations, we will refer to the on-order quantity as
the “in resupply” quantity. This “in resupply” terminology is often used in military and
aviation applications in which items fail and are repaired or are procured from an ex-
ternal source. When an (s−1,s) policy is followed in continuous review environments,
an order is placed immediately whenever a demand occurs for one or more units of an
item. The order quantity matches the size of the demand exactly. Hence, the inventory
position is constant in the case where the demand process and costs are stationary over
an inﬁnite planning horizon, which is the one we will examine in some detail in this
chapter.
A major objective in this chapter is to show how to compute the stationary probabil-
ity distribution of the quantity of units in resupply. The amount in resupply at a random
point in time is a key random variable in the study of the behavior of systems man-
aged using an (s−1,s) policy. Once its stationary distribution is known, we can easily
determine the stationary distribution for on-hand and backordered inventory. We will
focus primarily on the case where backorders are allowed, since the analysis is simpler.
As a special case, however, we will also analyze a situation where excess demand over
supply is lost.
We ﬁrst show how to compute the distribution for the quantity in resupply in the
backorder case when the replenishment lead times or equivalently the resupply times
are independent and identically distributed. We will focus on the case where the demand

process is a Poisson process. We will generalize these results to the case where the
demand process is a compound Poisson process.
After we show how to calculate the stationary distributions, we show how to deter-
mine key statistical measures of supply system performance. Lastly, we present opti-
mization models and algorithms for computing stock levels when items are managed
using an (s−1,s) policy.
7.1 Steady State Distribution of the Number of Units in Resupply
The construction of the steady state distribution of the number of units in resupply
follows from the properties of the underlying Poisson process generating the orders.
Let us begin by reviewing some of these properties.
Let λ represent the demand rate of the customer order process. Suppose exactly
one order occurs during the time interval [0,t]. Given that this order has occurred, let
us establish the distribution of the time at which the order was placed. Intuitively, this
distribution should be uniform since a Poisson process has stationary and independent
increments. Let T be the time at which this event occurs, and let N(t) represent the
number of customer orders received in [0,t]. Then, for s < t,
P[T < s|N(t) = 1] = P[T < s;N(t) = 1]
P[N(t) = 1]
= P[N(s) = 1;N(t −s) = 0]
P[N(t) = 1]
= P[N(s) = 1]·P[N(t −s) = 0]
P[N(t) = 1]
= λse−λse−λ(t−s)
λte−λt
= s
t .
Hence the time at which the customer arrival occurs is uniformly distributed over the
interval [0,t].
This result can be generalized as follows. Suppose X1,...,Xn are n independent and
identically distributed random variables. The random variables X(1),...,X(n) are order
statistics corresponding to X1,...,Xn if X(k) corresponds to the kth smallest value among
the random variables, X1,...,Xn. Let f(xi) represent the common density function for
the Xi. Then the joint density function for the X(i) is

fX(1),...,X(n)(x1,...,xn) = n!
n
∏
i=1
f(xi), x1 < ··· < xn.
(7.1)
The term n! appears because there are that many permutations of X1,...,Xn that lead to
the same order statistic.
Now suppose that N(t) = n and suppose X1,...,Xn are the arrival times of the 1st,
2nd, ..., nth customer orders, respectively. Then X1,...,Xn have the same distribution
as do the order statistics corresponding to n independent random variables that have
uniform distributions over the interval [0,t]. We can prove this fact in the following
manner.
Suppose we have times t1,...,tn, where 0 < t1 < t2 < ··· < tn < t, and ∆i is small
enough so that
ti +∆i < ti+1 and tn +∆n < t.
(7.2)
Then
P[t1 ≤X1 ≤t1 +∆1,...,tn ≤Xn ≤tn +∆n|N(t) = n]
= P[1 cust order is placed in [ti,ti+∆i],i=1,...,n, and no customer orders are placed elsewhere in [0,t]]

and therefore

Taking the limit of the left-hand side as ∆i →0 for all i, we obtain
fX1,...,Xn(t1,...,tn) = n!
tn , 0 < t1 < t2 < ··· < tn < t,
(7.3)
which is the desired result. Thus, we may conclude that if n customer orders are placed
in [0,t], then the times at which these orders are placed, considered as unordered times,
are independent and uniformly distributed over the interval [0,t].

Background Concepts
7.1.1 Backorder Case
We are now ready to establish a remarkable result, which is a restatement of a theorem
attributed to Palm [263].
Theorem 7.1. Suppose s is the stock level for an item whose demands are generated by
a Poisson process with rate λ. Suppose further that the resupply time random variables
have density functions g(τ) with mean τ, and have distribution functions G(τ). Sup-
pose further that the resupply times are independent and identically distributed from
customer order to customer order. Then the steady state probability that x units are in
resupply is given by
e−λτ (λτ)x
x!
.
(7.4)
Proof. Suppose N(t) = n customer orders have been placed in [0,t]. We know that
P[N(t) = n] = e−λt (λt)n
n! .
(7.5)
Since an (s−1,s) policy is employed to manage the inventory, each customer order
generates a corresponding request on the resupply system. Next, let
qt(x|n) = P[x units are in resupply at time t|N(t) = n].

Consider any one of the n orders. As we just demonstrated, the time of its placement is
uniformly distributed over the interval [0,t]. Suppose this order was placed at time s ∈
[0,t]. Then the probability that the corresponding unit remains in the resupply system
at time t is 1−G(t −s).
Let p be the common probability that any unit that arrives during [0,t] remains in
the resupply system at time t. Since 1−G(t −s) measures the conditional probability
that the unit entering the resupply system at time s remains unsatisﬁed at time t, the
unconditional probability is given by
p =

Since each arriving order in [0,t] has a probability p that its corresponding resupply

Thus the probability that there are n units in the resupply system is Poisson dis-
tributed with mean λτ; i.e., we do not need to know the density function for the resup-
ply time, but only the mean of the resupply time distribution, τ.
⊓⊔
This remarkable result has an important generalization. Suppose at each demand
event the quantity required is not always of size one, but rather is a random variable.
Assume the size of each order is independent from order to order. When the order
event process is a Poisson process and the order size random variables are independent
and identically distributed, the resulting demand process is called a compound Poisson
process.
Let us now state, without proof, the generalization of Palm’s theorem for the case of
a compound Poisson process for the backorder case.
Theorem 7.2. Suppose demands occur according to a compound Poisson process
where λ is the customer order arrival rate. Suppose also that the resupply times are
independent and identically distributed with density g(τ) with mean τ. Assume when a
customer order is received, the resupply time for all units in the order is the same and
is drawn from the resupply time distribution. The steady state probability of x units in
resupply is given by the compound Poisson distribution with mean λτ u, where u is the
average customer order size.
7.1.2 Lost Sales Case
To this point we have assumed that all customer orders in excess of the supply s are
backordered. Let us now assume that this is not the case; that is, when a customer order
is placed and there is no on-hand inventory, then the order is lost. We will prove a
version of Palm’s theorem for a special case of the lost order situation. A general and
complicated proof of the lost sales case when demand is compound Poisson distributed
is given by Feeney and Sherbrooke [120]. We will focus on a relatively simple situation
where the order lead times are exponentially distributed. Speciﬁcally, the theorem that
we will prove is as follows.
Theorem 7.3. Suppose customer orders arrive according to a Poisson process with ar-
rival rate λ. Furthermore, suppose the stock level is s. Assume resupply times for ac-
cepted customer orders are independent and identically distributed with common den-
sity g(τ) = βe−βτ, with mean τ = 1/β. Then the steady state probability that x units
are in resupply in the lost order case is given by

Proof. When g(τ) = βe−βτ, we can derive the desired result by an argument used
when analyzing queuing systems. Let Pj(t) represent the probability that j units are in
resupply at time t. Note that if j < 0 or j > s, then Pj(t) = 0.
Since the order arrival process is a Poisson process and the resupply time distribution
is exponential, for 0 ≤j ≤s,
Pj(t +∆t) = [1−(λ + jβ)∆t]Pj(t)+λ∆t ·Pj−1(t)+(j +1)β∆t ·Pj+1(t)+o(∆t).

j(t) →0.
Let π j represent the steady state probability that j units are in the resupply system.
Then

In the general case, that is, where g(τ) is an arbitrary density with mean value τ, the
steady state probability that j units are in the resupply system is also given by the above

Performance Measures

7.2 Performance Measures
To this point, we have developed the steady state probabilities for the number of units
that are in the resupply system at a random point in time when the demand process is
either a Poisson or compound Poisson process. On the basis of these probabilities, we
can calculate different measures of system performance. These measures relate to per-
formance at a single location. Subsequently, we will see how steady state probabilities
and performance measures are computed in multi-echelon situations.
We will begin by considering several measures that are single-item measures, con-
ﬁning our discussion to the backorder case. The ﬁrst performance measure we consider,
the ﬁll rate, is the most commonly used measure in practice, and is deﬁned as follows.
Given a stock level of s, the ﬁll rate, F(s), is the expected fraction of demands that can
be satisﬁed immediately from on-hand stock. As is intuitively clear, as s increases the
ﬁll rate will increase. We will develop an explicit expression for F(s) in this section and
will discuss its properties in the next section of this chapter.
A second performance measure is called the ready rate corresponding to stock level
s. The ready rate measures the probability that an item observed at a random point in
time has no backorders, that is, its net inventory is non-negative. We denote the ready
rate by R(s). This is an all or nothing measure. Either there are backorders or there are
no backorders at a random point in time.
Observe that when computing either a ﬁll rate or ready rate we are not concerned
with the duration of backorders when they occur. Thus, for example, a ﬁll rate of say
95% implies that, on average, 95 of every 100 units that are ordered have that request
satisﬁed immediately. But we are not measuring how long it takes to satisfy the other
5% of the units requested. Thus it is not always clear that a ﬁrm that maintains a high
ﬁll rate is truly satisfying its customers needs. This is particularly true when ﬁll rates
are calculated for a large number of item types. In this case, the ﬁll rate would measure
the fraction of demands satisﬁed immediately over all items. Thus some items could
have nearly 100% of the demands satisﬁed immediately while others could have a 0%
ﬁll rate.
Note also that the ready rate is always at least as high as the ﬁll rate. For example,
when s = 0,F(s) = 0. But R(s) could approach 1 if the demand rate is low and the lead
time is very short. It is not unusual that the measures F(s) and R(s) are confused in
practice.
A third single-item performance criterion measures the expected number of back-
orders outstanding at a random point in time, and is denoted by B(s). This measure
accounts for the length of time backorders exist. Hence, it is a response-time focused
measure. Observe that B(s) is equal to the demand rate times the average “waiting time”
of a demand. This is a consequence of Little’s law, L = λW, where B(s) is L,λ the de-

194
7
Background Concepts
mand rate, and W the average waiting time. We could also compute the conditional
value of W, given that backorders exist.
Let us now see how these performance measures can be computed. Recall that, in
the backorder case when the demand is a compound Poisson process, the steady state
probability that x units are in resupply is given by
P{X = x} = p(x|λτ) =
∞
∑
j=1
e−λτ (λτ)j
j!
u( j)
x ,x ≥1,
P{X = 0} = e−λτ,
where λ is the demand rate, τ the average resupply time, and u( j)
x
the probability that j
customer orders generate a total demand of x units.
The ready rate is the probability that there are no backorders existing at a random
point in time. This is the probability that the number of units in resupply is s or less.
That is,
R(s) =
s
∑
x=0
p(x|λτ).
The computation of the ﬁll rate is more difﬁcult, but it is obtained from the steady
state probabilities p(x|λτ). Suppose a customer order is received. There will be one
unit of the order satisﬁed if there are s −1 or fewer units in resupply. A second unit
will be sent to the customer if the order is for two or more units and there are s −2
or fewer units in resupply. Remember that the timing and size of a customer order are
independent of all past orders and resupply times. Hence, the expected number of units
ﬁlled per customer order is given by
F1(s) = ∑
x≤s−1
p(x|λτ)+(1−u1) ∑
x≤s−2
p(x|λτ)
+ (1−u1 −u2) ∑
x≤s−3
p(x|λτ)+
···+
 
1−∑
j≤s−1
uj
!
p(0|λτ),
(7.23)
where, as before, uj measures the probability that a customer order is for exactly j units.
In the case of a simple Poisson demand process (that is, when u1=1),
F(s) = F1(s) = ∑
x≤s−1
p(x|λτ).
Hence, in this case,
F1(s) = F(s) = R(s)−p(s|λτ) and F(s) < R(s).

7.2
Performance Measures
195
When the demand process is a compound Poisson process, λF1(s) measures the
expected number of units that can be shipped on time per day, when λ is the expected
daily rate at which customers place orders. Furthermore, λu measures the expected
number of units demanded per day, where u is the expected number of units demanded
per order. Thus
λF1(s)
λu
= F1(s)
u
measures the fraction of the units ordered that are sent to customers on time. We let this
quantity be deﬁned as the ﬁll rate, or
F(s) = F1(s)
u
.
Next, we see that the expected number of units in a backorder status in steady state
is
B(s) = ∑
x>s
(x−s)p(x|λτ).
That is, there are x −s units backordered if and only if there are x units in resupply,
x > s.
Suppose there are n item types in a system rather than just a single item. Then
performance measures are computed somewhat differently.
First, the system ﬁll rate is calculated by computing the conditional ﬁll rate for the
item type, multiplying by the probability that a demand was for a speciﬁc item type, and
summing over item types. Let F(s) measure the system ﬁll rate, where s = (s1,...,sn)
is a vector of item stock levels. If Fi(si) measures the ﬁll rate for item type i, then
F(s) =
n
∑
i=1
λi
∑n
j=1 λ j
·Fi(si)
because λi/∑n
j=1 λ j is the probability that a customer demand is for item type i when the
customer order process is a Poisson process. This calculation is based on the assumption
that an order is for a single item type.
The expected number of backorders at a random point in time for n items is simply
n
∑
i=1
Bi(si) =
n
∑
i=1 ∑

(x−si)p(x|λiτi).
When there is more than one item, the ready rate measure must be modiﬁed. The
new measure is called the operational rate. We assume a system is operational if and
only if all item types are operational. A particular item type will not be available, and
hence the system will not be operational, if the number of units in resupply for that

item exceeds its stock level. Assuming demand and resupply times are independent
from item type to item type, the operational rate is given by
OR(s) =
n
∏
i=1
Ri(si).
Suppose there are many operating systems, say a ﬂeet of aircraft. Furthermore, sup-
pose part shortages can be consolidated into as few aircraft as possible. This process is
often called “cannibalization” of the aircraft. Suppose there may be more than one unit
of a particular type on an aircraft, say qi units of type i. Then, assuming independence
and cannibalization,

and

∏

Ri(si +kqi) = probability that k or

Let Y be a random variable that measures the number of non-operational aircraft.

P{Y ≤1} =

Consequently, the expected number of non-operational aircraft at a random point in
time given cannibalization and independence is

Hence, if there are N aircraft, an approximation to the expected number of opera-
tional aircraft is
N −E[Y].
Since the demand process assumes an inﬁnite population, this is a conservative esti-
mate.
Another approximation for the expected number of operational aircraft can be de-
veloped as follows. Let us consider item type i. Recall that Bi(si) measures the expected
number of backorders for item type i at a random point in time. Suppose there is one
unit of this item type per aircraft and there are N aircraft in the system. The proba-
bility that a random aircraft at a random point in time is missing a unit of item type i
is Bi(si)/N, or 1−Bi(si)/N is the probability that the aircraft is not missing a unit of
type i. Assuming independence, the probability that a random aircraft is operational at
a random point in time is
p =
n
∏
i=1
(1−Bi(si)/N).
The expected number of operational aircraft at a random point in time is given by

Thus there is a simple approximate correspondence between the expected number
of backorders outstanding at a random point in time and the expected number of op-
erational aircraft. The latter approximation of the expected number of operational air-
craft is particularly useful from a computational viewpoint because of the mathematical
properties of the functions Bi(si), as we will now see.

7.3 Properties of the Performance Measures
Now that we have deﬁned several key performance measures and have shown how to
compute them, let us examine them more closely. We begin by studying the ﬁll rate
measure.
Let us assume, for simplicity, that the demand process is a simple Poisson process
with rate λ. Furthermore, assume that resupply times for each order are independent
and identically distributed with mean τ. As we have shown, the probability that x units
are in the resupply system in steady state is given by
p(x|λτ) = e−λτ (λτ)x
x!
.
Since the demand process is a simple Poisson process, the ﬁll rate, given a stock
level of s, is given by
F(s) = 1−∑
x≥s
p(x|λτ) = ∑
x<s
p(x|λτ).
Perhaps our goal might be to choose stock levels for many items so that the average
ﬁll rate across items is maximized given some target investment level in inventory. This
type of optimization problem would be easy to solve if F(s) were a discretely concave
function. Unfortunately, as we will now observe, it is not.
We know that if F(s) were a discretely concave function in s, then its second dif-
ference must be non-positive for all s ≥0. Let us now deﬁne both the ﬁrst and second
differences of F(s). The ﬁrst difference, ∆F(s), is given by
∆F(s) = F(s+1)−F(s),
and the second difference, ∆2F(s), is given by
∆2F(s) = ∆F(s+1)−∆F(s).
Hence
∆F(s) = ∑
x≤s
p(x|λτ)−∑
x≤s−1
p(x|λτ)
= e−λτ (λτ)s
s!
and

(s+1)! −e−λτ (λτ)s
s!

 λτ


.
When λτ > s+1, then ∆2F(s) > 0 and F(s) is not concave in that region. In fact, when
s < λτ −1, F(s) is discretely convex. Hence F(s) is discretely concave only when
s ≥⌊λτ⌋, when λτ is non-integer, and s ≥λτ −1, when λτ is an integer.
Graphs of F(s) for two cases are given in Figures 7.1 and 7.2. In the ﬁrst case
Fig. 7.1. Graph of ﬁll rate vs. inventory (case 1).
λτ = 3.2 and in the sec-
ond
case
λτ = 3.
The

and 7.2 contain values for
F(s), ∆F(s) and ∆2F(s)
for the two cases. The ta-
ble values show that the
concavity
property
holds
when ⌊λτ⌋≤s. Note that
when ⌊λτ⌋= λτ, that is,
when
λτ
is
an
integer,
∆F(λτ) = ∆F(λτ −1).
Next, we observe imme-
diately that the ready rate
function, R(s), is also not a
concave function of s for all
values of s.
Thus, neither F(s) nor
R(s) possesses the mathe-
matical property of concav-
ity that is desirable when
formulating and solving an
optimization problem when-
ever we consider all values
of s ≥0. Hence, in prac-
tical cases, s is constrained
to assume values that are
greater than or equal to ⌊λτ⌋
to ensure that the ﬁll rate
or ready rate functions are

tion for the expected number of operational systems are stated in terms of the ready rate.
Hence, these performance measures are not easy to work with in optimization models
unless s ≥⌊λτ⌋.
The backorder function B(s) does have very desirable mathematical properties, how-
ever. Recall that
B(s) = ∑
x>s
(x−s)p(x|λτ).
For B(s) to be strictly discretely convex and strictly decreasing requires that
∆B(s) = B(s+1)−B(s) < 0
and
∆2B(s) = ∆B(s+1)−∆B(s) > 0.

7.4 Finding Stock Levels in (s−1,s) Policy Managed Systems:
Optimization Problem Formulations and Solution Algorithms
Setting stock levels for items managed using an (s −1,s) policy will depend on the
objectives and constraints that are stipulated. For example, we could choose to minimize
the average number of outstanding backorders across n item types subject to a constraint
on investment in inventory. We could also select stock levels that minimize investment
cost subject to an average ﬁll rate constraint across items. Other optimization models
could be formulated as well for complex resupply networks. We will study several such
problems in the next chapter. In this chapter we will examine solution methods that will
be employed subsequently for more general problems. The problem that we will study
now is concerned with setting stock levels for many items at a single location.
One solution approach that we could use is to construct a Lagrangian relaxation of a
particular optimization problem. We begin by solving the resulting relaxed problem for
a given set of Lagrange multiplier values. We then adjust these multiplier values, and
re-solve the relaxed problem. We continue in this manner until a stopping criterion of
some sort is satisﬁed.
7.4.1 First Example: Minimize Expected Backorders Subject to an
Inventory Investment Constraint
Suppose Llenroc Electronics manages a group of item types at a single location. The
inventory policy followed for all items is an (s −1,s) policy. Thus a replenishment
order is placed on an external supplier whenever a unit is withdrawn from Llenroc’s
stock to satisfy a customer demand. The goal is to select the stock levels so that the
average number of outstanding backorders is minimized subject to a constraint on the
average investment in inventory. The demand process is assumed to be a stationary
compound Poisson process for each of the n item types being managed. Order lead
times for replenishment stock are assumed to be independent, identically distributed
random variables for each item type and across item types.
Let
b
represent the budget limit on the average value of on-hand
inventory,
ci
be the unit cost for item type i,
si
be the stock level for item type i,
λiτiui be the expected demand over a lead time for item type i, and
Bi(si) be the expected number of backorders outstanding at a random
point in time for item type i.

7.4
Finding Stock Levels
203
From Palm’s theorem, we know that the steady state probability distribution for the
number of units on order with the supplier has a compound Poisson distribution for
each item type. Let us denote the probability that x units of item type i are on order
with the supplier by p(x|λiτiui).
The inventory position when following an (s−1,s) policy is a constant, s. In general,
the inventory position is deﬁned as
inventory position = on hand+on order−backorders.
In this case
s = E[inventory position] = E[on hand]+E[on order]−B(s).
The expected number of units on order for item type i is λiτiui from Little’s law. Hence,
for item type i,
E[on hand] = si −λiτiui +Bi(si).
Let µi = λiτiui. Then the average investment in on-hand inventory for item i is ci[si −
µi +Bi(si)].
We are now in a position to state the optimization problem as

To solve this problem, we will use a Lagrangian relaxation method. Let θ repre-
sent the multiplier associated with the budget constraint that links the item stock level
decisions.
The relaxation is

Thus, given a value of θ, the resulting relaxed optimization problem is separable by
item type. The problem that must be solved for each item is of the same form, so we
will temporarily drop the item subscript.
Let f(s) = (1+ θc)B(s) + θcs. Since B(s) is discretely strictly convex in s, f(s) is
convex, too. Deﬁne
∆f(s) = f(s+1)−f(s)
= (1+θc){B(s+1)−B(s)}+θc.
Since we previously showed that
B(s+1)−B(s) = −

∆f(s) = −(1+θc)

Because of the convexity of f(s), the optimal stock level, given θ, is the smallest non-

that is, the smallest value for which

C(θ) =

It
is clear
that C(θ)
is
also non-increasing as θ in-
creases and non-decreasing
as θ decreases. A graph of
this relationship is shown
in Figure 7.3. The goal is
to ﬁnd a value of θ such
that C(θ) is approximately
equal to b. It is generally
not possible to ﬁnd a value
of θ that yields C(θ) = b,
as illustrated in Figure 7.3.
Hence, the goal is to con-
struct the graph of the min-
imum expected backorders
as a function of the aver-
age investment in on-hand
inventory. Each value of θ
yields a set of stock levels, a
corresponding inventory in-
vestment, and a minimum
number of average outstand-
ing backorders. Thus it is
obvious that by solving the
relaxation corresponding to
a set of multiplier values,
θ1 > θ2 > ··· > θM, we can
construct a graph of mini-
mum expected backorders as
a function of θ, as illustrated

Thus to ﬁnd s∗(θi) we know that

reduced signiﬁcantly.

Some of the ideas discussed in this section were described ﬁrst in Fox and Landi
[123] and later reviewed in Muckstadt [243].
7.4.2 Second Example: Maximize Expected System Average Fill Rate
Subject to an Inventory Investment Constraint
As in our ﬁrst example, suppose Llenroc Electronics manages n item types at a single
location. We assume an (s −1,s) policy is used for each of these items. We assume
requests for these items are placed by customers on the ﬁrm. Each request that is made
corresponds to a failure of a single unit of a particular part type. The failed parts are re-
paired at a repair facility. Repair times for an item type are independent and identically

7.4
Finding Stock Levels
207
distributed; repair times across item types are also independent. We assume requests for
serviceable parts for each item type i occur according to a Poisson process with rate λi.
In this case our goal is to ﬁnd the stock levels that maximize the average expected
system ﬁll rate subject to an investment constraint. Here units do not leave the system,
so that the investment corresponding to stock levels si is ∑n
i=1 cisi.
We use the same notation as in the preceding example where appropriate. The func-
tion Fi(si) measures the ﬁll rate for item i given a stock level si.
In this situation, the probability that x units are in the repair process is given by
p(x|λiτi) = e−λiτi (λiτi)x
x!
,
from Palm’s theorem.
The optimization problem can be stated as
maximize

Recall from our earlier discussion that
Fi(si) = ∑

e−λiτi (λiτi)x
x!
.
Recall also that Fi(si) is concave in the region si ≥⌊λiτi⌋, and hence we have placed
this constraint on si in our formulation of the inventory stocking problem.
We could obtain an answer to the problem using the Lagrangian relaxation method
described earlier. However, we will use a simpler approach, marginal analysis. This
greedy approach will produce an optimal solution for certain values of b and an ap-
proximately optimal solution for all other values of b, as we will see.

which measures the increase in the expected system ﬁll rate per incremental dollar
invested in item i given the current stock level is si.
Suppose we have stock levels si ≥⌊λiτi⌋and want to determine which item’s stock
level should be increased from si to si +1. Since ∆i(si) measures the change in perfor-

mance per incremental dollar invested, we would choose to increment the stock level
of item i∗if
i∗= argmax

∆i(si).
Initially set si = ⌊λiτi⌋, and compute ∑n
i=1(λi/∑n
j=1 λ j)·Fi(⌊λiτi⌋) and ∑n
i=1 ci⌊λiτi⌋.
Next, compute ∆i(⌊λiτi⌋) for all i and increment the stock level for the item having the
maximum value of ∆i(si), say i∗. The solution
si = ⌊λiτi⌋,
i ̸= i∗,
si∗= ⌊λi∗τi∗⌋+1
is the optimal solution to (7.25) when
b = ∑
i̸=i∗
ci⌊λiτi⌋+ci∗{⌊λi∗τi∗⌋+1}.
Continuing in this manner, it is clear how we would construct a graph of the max-
imum average expected ﬁll rate as a function of system investment in inventory. Thus
the proposed greedy algorithm will ﬁnd the optimal solution for values of b that would
be generated sequentially as a consequence of constructing the solution as outlined.
7.5 Exercises
7.1. Suppose that time is divided into periods of equal length. Demand in each period
is Poisson distributed with a mean of λ units. An order-up-to policy is followed for
managing inventories. Replenishment lead times are assumed to be independent and
identically distributed with a mean of D periods. Prove that the number of units on
order (in resupply) in steady state has a Poisson distribution with mean λD. That is,
prove the discrete-time analogue of Palm’s theorem.
7.2. Plot the probabilities for a random variable that has a negative binomial distribution
where its mean assumes values 1, 5, 25. For each mean, construct these plots when the

corresponding probabilities for a Poisson distributed random variable with the same
means?

7.4. Plot the backorder, ready rate, and ﬁll rate functions (B(s),R(s),F(s)) for a single-
stage inventory system managed using a continuous review (s−1,s) policy. Suppose the
lead time demand is either Poisson distributed or negative binomially distributed with
expected lead time demand being either 1, 5, or 10 units. In the case where lead time
demand follows a negative binomial distribution, construct the plots for the variance-to-
mean ratios of 1.01, 2, and 5. What do you observe? In particular, suppose the desired
ﬁll rate goal is .95. Find the required stock level in each case.
7.5. Suppose there are ten critical items on an aircraft. Compute the expected number
of non-operational aircraft for several combinations of stock levels for these items as-
suming the demand process is Poisson. Expected demands over the lead time for these
ten items are 10, 7, 2, 1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1, 0.04, and 0.01.
7.6. Llenroc Industries owns a ﬂeet of aircraft and wants to determine how many spares
of each of N components to buy. Aircraft failures occur according to a Poisson process.
Each failure is due to the failure of a single component and the probability that it is due
to component i is λi/∑j λ j, where λi is the failure rate for component i. The average re-
pair time for component i is ti. The owner wants to set the spare parts’ stock levels such
that the average delay in completing the repair of an aircraft due to parts availability is
minimized. There is a constraint on total investment in spare parts of C dollars. Assume
each component of type i costs ci dollars. An (s −1,s) policy is used to manage the
system.

λ2 = 7.
Plot the total investment in spare parts as a function of the Lagrange multiplier, and
use this plot to obtain a solution for the problem.
7.7. Suppose a ﬁrm manages n item types at a single location. Assume an (s−1,s) pol-
icy is used for each of these items. Requests for these items are placed by customers
on the ﬁrm. Each request corresponds to a failure of a single unit of a particular part
type. The failed parts are repaired at a repair facility. Repair times for an item type are
independent and identically distributed; repair times across item types are also inde-
pendent. Assume requests for serviceable parts for each item type i occur according to
a Poisson process with rate λi. Construct a marginal analysis algorithm that determines

stock levels that maximize the average expected system ﬁll rate subject to an investment
constraint. Use this algorithm to determine the optimal stock levels for the data given
in the previous problem.
7.8. Suppose the demand process is a compound Poisson process where the order arrival
rate is λ and where the order size is represented by a random variable, N, having a
logarithmic distribution. That is, P(N = n) = −(1−p)n

Furthermore, suppose λ = −ln p.
Show that the distribution of demand is described by a negative binomial distribution
in this case. Do this by ﬁrst constructing the generating function for the order size
distribution and then by constructing the generating function for the compound Poisson
distribution.
Using the generating function for the order size distribution, show how to compute
the expectation and variance of the order size distribution, that is E[N] and Var(N).

A Tactical Planning Model for Managing
Recoverable Items in Multi-Echelon Systems
There are different potential uses for inventory models. One of the uses is to create
budgets that can then be employed to guide purchases of items. Another application is
the setting of target stock levels (order-up-to levels) that are the basis for purchasing
items that have long procurement lead times. Models that are used for these purposes
are called tactical planning models. These models are extensively used in military envi-
ronments. Our goals are to study one such tactical planning model and to demonstrate
how echelons interact when continuous review (s−1,s) policies are instituted.
In 1968, Sherbrooke [314]published a landmark paper in which he described a tacti-
cal planning model for the management of recoverable or repairable items called MET-
RIC (Multi-Echelon Technique for Recoverable Item Control). The goal of the model
was to provide a computationally tractable framework for planning budgets and procur-
ing items for the U.S. Air Force. As we have discussed, the key to building models is the
ability to calculate the distribution of the number of units in the resupply system. Un-
fortunately, establishing the exact probability distributions for these random variables
in even two-echelon systems is not tractable for large numbers of items. Since these
calculations are too computationally burdensome to be of practical use, Sherbrooke de-
veloped an approximation to this distribution that is easy to compute, and hence has
been widely used in many applications.
We now summarize the key elements of Sherbrooke’s ideas and important contribu-
tions and improvements to METRIC due to Graves [138], Sherbrooke [317] Muckstadt
[239] and O’Malley [259].

A Tactical Planning Model
8.1 The METRIC System
As stated, the system modelled by Sherbrooke [314] corresponds to one operated by
the US Air Force, which consists of a set of bases, at which ﬂying activity occurs, and
a depot. Both the depot and bases stock inventory and repair defective parts. The parts
removed from the aircraft requiring repair are called LRUs, or Line Replaceable Units.
The system is assumed to operate as follows.
When an LRU fails at a base (removed from an aircraft), the following events occur.
First, an LRU is withdrawn from base stock and placed on the aircraft, thereby returning
the aircraft to an operational status. If serviceable stock is not available in base supply,
then a backorder occurs. The failed unit is either repaired at the base or the depot.
The decision as to where the repair occurs depends only on the nature of the failure.
Some types of LRU failures can only be diagnosed and repaired at the depot. Others
can be diagnosed and repaired at the base level. We assume that whenever a failed unit
can be repaired at a base, from a technical viewpoint, then it will be repaired there.
Thus the choice of the repair location does not depend on the current on-hand stock at
the base or the current workload in the base repair shop.
When the unit is shipped to the depot for repair, a request is made to have an LRU
of the same type shipped to that base. If such a unit is on hand, it will be shipped im-
mediately; otherwise, a backorder will occur at the depot. We assume two things. First,
the depot meets demands on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-serve basis. That is, no prioritization
among bases occurs when making shipping decisions even though such prioritization
may often be desirable. Thus the tactical planning model is conservative in that base
level performance will be enhanced if proper prioritization practices are put into oper-
ation. Second, bases are not resupplied by other bases, that is, lateral resupply is not
permitted in the model. Again this is a conservative assumption since lateral resupply
will enhance base performance if executed appropriately.
Because the cost of each unit of an LRU is normally high and demand rates are
usually low, the (s −1,s) inventory policy is followed in practice at both the bases
and the depot. We assume that all failed units can be repaired; however, if there are
condemnations, then orders will be placed on an external supplier. In this case the orders
may be for more than a single unit. In these cases, the (s−1,s) policy is not followed
and our subsequent discussion must be modiﬁed.
We will assume that failures of each LRU type occur according to a Poisson process.
This assumption is necessary for some analytic reasons, as will become apparent as we
proceed. However, we will indicate subsequently how this assumption is relaxed in
practice.

8.1
The METRIC System
213
8.1.1 System Operation and Deﬁnitions
As we discussed, the system operates as follows. Removals of LRU i at base j occur ac-
cording to a Poisson process with rate λij. With probability rij the unit will be repaired
at the base, and with probability (1−rij) will be repaired at the depot. Hence the arrival
process to base maintenance for LRU i is a Poisson process with rate rijλij. The arrival
process to the depot maintenance activity for LRU type i is also a Poisson process with
rate λi0 = ∑j(1−rij)λij. That this process is a Poisson process is a consequence of the
fact that failures occur at bases according to Poisson processes for LRU type i and that
each such failure has a probability of rij of being repaired at the base and 1−rij of being
repaired at the depot. Furthermore, the superposition of the independent Poisson arrival
processes from the bases corresponding to failures requiring depot repair for LRU type
i is also a Poisson process.
We assume the depot repair cycle time for LRU i is denoted by Di and is not de-
pendent on the base from which the LRU is sent. The repair cycle time includes the
packing, transportation, and actual repair times.
We let Bij be the base repair cycle time for LRU i at base j and Aij be the order,
shipping and receiving time of LRU i at base j for shipments of LRU i received from
the depot.
Let Tij represent the average number of days that it takes to resupply base j’s stock
for LRU i once a unit enters the resupply system, that is, either depot or base repair
cycles.
We assume λij is measured in units per day and Di, Bij, and Aij are measured in
days. The ﬂows of LRUs in this system are shown in Figure 8.1.
8.1.2 The Optimization Problem
Our goal is to develop a model that can be used to determine stock levels sij for LRU
i at location j and to show how to compute these stock levels. The objective of the
model is to minimize the total average number of outstanding backorders at the bases
at a random point in time for a given level of investment. But why choose the backorder
criterion as the performance measure of interest? The goal should be to maximize the
expected number of operational aircraft at the bases. Recall that in the previous chap-
ter, we showed, to a ﬁrst-order approximation, that minimizing backorders at bases is
equivalent to maximizing the expected number of operational aircraft at the base level.
Thus maximizing the average number of available aircraft is approximately equal to
minimizing the average number of outstanding base level LRU backorders at a random
point in time.

214

A Tactical Planning Model
Fig. 8.1. The METRIC system.
Let
sij = LRU i stock level at base j (or depot if j = 0).
Before we state the optimization problem, we ﬁrst develop some additional relation-
ships.
The key equation that links the base and depot stock levels is the average resupply
time equation for LRU i at base j. Let
Tij = average LRU i resupply time at base j
= rijBij +(1−rij)(Aij + depot delay (si0)).
Thus the average resupply time is Bij when the repair occurs at base j for LRU i and Aij
plus an expected waiting time (depot delay) due to the depot stock level when resupply
comes from the depot. These average times are weighted by the probability that resup-
ply occurs either from base maintenance or from depot stock. But how do we measure
this expected waiting time?
Let

8.1
The METRIC System
215
δ(si0) = expected depot delay, or waiting time, given the depot
stock level is si0 for LRU type i.
From Little’s law,
δ(si0) = Average outstanding depot backorders (si0)
Depot demand rate (λi0)
.
Let BD(si0) = expected outstanding depot backorders for LRU i given si0. Hence
δ(si0) = BD(si0)
λi0
.
Let us explore how δ(si0) behaves. First, we note that δ(si0) →0 quite rapidly as si0
exceeds λi0Di. To illustrate this observation, consider the cases where λi0Di is equal to
1, 5, 10, 50 and 100. We display the values of δ(si0) for these cases in Table 8.1 through
Table 8.5, where we assume Di = 1.
As can be seen from the data in these tables, the expected depot delay becomes small
quite quickly when Di = 1. When Aij is several days in length, the depot delay becomes
a relatively inconsequential portion of the expected resupply time as si0 exceeds λi0Di.
As an example, suppose rij = 0,Aij = 5, λij = 5 and λi0 = 50, with Di = 1. Then
the expected number of units in resupply for the base is 5×5+5×δ(si0). If si0 = 50,
then δ(si0) = .0563 and the expected number of units in the base’s resupply system is
25.2815 units of which only .2815 are attributable to the depot delay in resupply of the
base. In this example, we see that this minimal contribution to the expected number of
units in the base resupply system occurred when the depot carried no safety stock. Thus
as the depot demand rate increases and Aij increases while rij decreases, there is little
to be gained by having much depot safety stock.

Now let us consider another example. Suppose rij = 0, Aij = 5, λij = .5, λi0 = 5 but
Di = 10. Thus λi0Di = 50, as was the case in the previous example. To ﬁnd δ(si0) in this
case we can again use the data in Table 8.4. The data in that table must be multiplied
by the value of Di to obtain the new values of δ(si0), which are given in Table 8.6. As
was the case in the ﬁrst example, the average resupply time is dominated by the value
of Aij. Hence if a small amount of safety stock is carried at the depot, say 5 units so that
si0 = 55, then the average resupply time is 5.206 days. The expected number of units
in resupply at the base is now 2.6030 units of which .103 units are attributable to depot
delay.
Observe that as λi0Di remains constant but Di increases, then δ(si0) increases pro-
portionately to the increase in Di. For example, as Di increased from 1 to 10, δ(si0)
increased by a factor of 10. If λij = .25, λi0 = 2.5, and Di = 20, then δ(50) = 1.126
days and δ(55) = .412 days. Thus as Di increases, while λi0Di remains constant, we see
that δ(si0) increases and can become a more signiﬁcant portion of the average resupply

8.1

217
time. Hence safety stock at the depot will become more important as Di becomes larger
while λi0Di remains constant.
In any case, the range of values that need to be evaluated explicitly in an optimization
procedure is limited since δ(si0) approaches small values quite quickly as si0 > ⌊λiDi⌋.
The range can usually be limited to two standard deviations of depot demand over
the depot’s resupply time. That is, the optimal value that si0 assumes almost always
is in the interval

⌊λiDi⌋,⌈2·(λiDi)1/2⌉+⌊λiDi⌋

, assuming ⌊λiDi⌋is the minimum
depot stock level that is considered. Furthermore, when solving practical problems, the
search for the optimal value of si0 is limited to a subset of these values. Consider the
values in Table 8.5. Observe that successive values do not differ by substantial amounts.
Hence searches are limited to perhaps every second value in the interval given earlier.
Thus when λiDi = 100, the search for the optimal value of si0 might be restricted to
100,102,... ,120. As a consequence of these observations, a maximum of 10 to 15
possible values for si0 are often explicitly considered in practice when employing the
optimization methodology we will be discussing in subsequent sections.
8.1.2.1
Approximating the Stationary Probability Distribution for the Number
of LRUs in Resupply
To calculate the expected number of base j backorders for LRU i, we must determine
the stationary probability distribution for the number of units in resupply for LRU i at
base j.
Let Xij = random variable for the number of units in resupply for LRU i at base j in
steady state. Clearly,
E[Xij] = λijTij
= rijλijBij +(1−rij)λijAij +(1−rij)λij
λi0
BD(si0).
To compute the variance of Xij requires some additional analysis. We drop the LRU
subscript in this analysis for ease of exposition.
Suppose there are ND backorders at the depot for some LRU. Let Nj be the number
of base j units backordered at the depot. The probability that Nj = nj when ND = nD,
where nj ≤nD, is given by
P{Nj = nj|ND = nD} =
 nD

Thus the expected number of LRUs in backorder status corresponding to demands at
base j is the fraction of total depot demand due to base j, on average, times the expected
number of depot backorders given s0.
The variance of Nj also depends on the depot stock level. We know that
Var(Nj|s0) = E[N2
j |s0]−E[Nj|s0]2.
We also know that E[Nj|s0] =

The Var(ND|s0) can be computed as follows. Since
Var(ND|s0) = E[N2
D|s0]−(BD(s0))2 ,
we need to determine a method for calculating E[N2
D|s0]. Recall that ND measures the
number of depot backorders at a random point in time. Hence if ND = nD, then the
number of units of the LRU in depot resupply must exceed the depot stock level by nD.
Thus if x measures the number of units of the LRU in depot resupply, there are nD depot

8.1

219
backorders for the LRU if and only if x−s0 = nD. Hence
E[N2
D|s0] = ∑
x≥s0
(x−s0)2p(x|λ0D),
where p(x|λ0D) is the probability that x units are in depot resupply. From Palm’s theo-
rem, p(x|λ0D) = e−λ0D (λ0D)x
x!
. Then
E[N2
D|s0] = ∑
x≥s0
(x−(s0 −1)−1)2 p(x|λ0D)
= ∑
x≥s0
(x−(s0 −1))2 p(x|λ0D)

(x−(s0 −1)) p(x|λ0D)
= E[N2
D|s0 −1]−BD(s0)−BD(s0 −1).
We thus can determine E[N2
D|s0] recursively, and therefore can determine Var(ND|s0)
recursively. Observe that
E[N2
D|0] = ∑
x≥0
x2p(x|λ0D)
= Var[Number of units in Depot resupply]
+[Expected number of units in depot resupply]2
= λ0D+(λ0D)2
when base demand is described by a Poisson process.
Now that we have computed the mean and variance of ND we are able to compute
the variance of Yj, where Yj is the random variable that represents the demand over the
order and ship time (A j) plus the backordered demand due to the depot stock level s0
at a random point in time at base j. Since the demands that cause depot backorders
and those occurring during the transportation lead time to base j take place in non-
overlapping intervals, and are therefore independent,

where as before ˆλ j = (1−rj)λ j.
But to compute the expected number of backorders at base j for LRU i we must
know the probability distribution of the number of units in resupply, Xij. Rather than
computing this distribution exactly, which is too computationally intensive to do, we
approximate it, as Sherbrooke [317] did, with a negative binomial distribution with
parameters
µij = rijλijBij + (1−rij)λijAij +(1−rij)λij

The appropriateness of the negative binomial approximation is discussed in Muck-
stadt [239]. We note that this approximation is quite accurate and hence is widely used
in practice.
The negative binomial distribution has two parameters, call them p and r. These
parameters must satisfy the two equations
µij = r(1−p)
p
and σ 2
ij = r(1−p)
p2
.
Thus
1 > µij
σ 2
ij
= p and r = pµij
1−p.
The probabilities can be computed recursively with
P{Xij = 0} = pr and P{Xij = x} = P{Xij = x−1}(r +x−1)
x
q,
where q = 1−p.
The choice of the negative binomial distribution as an approximation to the prob-
ability distribution of Xij was made for two key reasons. First, it is easily computed,

8.1
The METRIC System
221
which is essential in large scale applications. Second, it is an accurate approximation.
A substantial amount of testing has been conducted to verify the validity of the approx-
imations (Muckstadt [239]).
Additionally, in the Air Force and other implementations of the model we have just
described, a negative binomial model was used for reasons other than those that have
been discussed. A negative binomial model was used to represent the demand process as
well in these approximations. That is, the negative binomial probability model replaces
the Poisson model in all the demand probability model expressions found throughout
this chapter. The negative binomial model was chosen in these applications to accom-
modate the high variance-to-mean ratios of the demand processes found in practice. A
complete discussion of the variance-to-mean ratio of the demand process can be found
in Crawford [78].
8.1.2.2
Finding Depot and Base LRU Stock Levels
We now turn to ﬁnding the best depot and base stock levels for each LRU, which are the
stock levels that minimize the expected number of “holes” in aircraft, that is, that min-
imize the expected number of base LRU backorders at a random point in time subject
to a constraint on investment in inventory:

sij) ≤b,
(8.1)
sij = 0,1,...,
where ci is the cost of one unit of LRU type i, b is the available budget to invest in the
LRUs, and m is the number of bases.
Unfortunately Problem (8.1) is neither separable nor convex. It is not separable
because the variables sij and si0 interact when computing Bij(sij|si0) = ∑x≥sij(x −
sij)p(x|λijTij(si0)), where p(x|λijTij(si0)) is approximated by a negative binomial dis-
tribution with mean µij and variance σ 2
ij, as deﬁned previously. Both µij and σ 2
ij are
functions of si0. We will discuss the convexity issue shortly.
There are many different ways to solve (8.1). One way is to use a marginal analysis
approach and another is to employ a Lagrange multiplier method.

222

A Tactical Planning Model
8.1.2.2.1
A Marginal Analysis Algorithm
We will ﬁrst discuss the marginal analysis approach. Since the objective function is
separable by LRU type, we ﬁrst focus on a single LRU type. As before, we temporarily
drop the LRU subscript to reduce the notation.
To determine a solution to (8.1) we analyze the relationships between total system
LRU inventory and the expected number of total base backorders. We will construct
this function ﬁrst and will observe that this function need not be convex. Hence, we
will construct its convex minorant and use this convex minorant as a basis for making
budget allocations among different types of LRUs.
Next, deﬁne
α(s,s0) = minimum total expected base backorders for
an LRU given that there are s units of the
LRU in the system and the depot stock is s0.
Let S represent the set of values of s0 that will be explicitly considered in the optimiza-
tion process.
Let s0 ∈S. Then, given s0, we can compute µj and σ 2
j as well as P{Xj = x|s0} ≡
pj(x|s0). Recall that
Bj(sj|s0) = ∑
x>sj
(x−sj)pj(x|s0).
Also recall that Bj(sj|s0) is a convex function, given s0, and satisﬁes
Bj(sj|s0) = Bj(sj −1|s0)−
 
1−∑
x<sj
pj(x|s0)
!
.
Thus the reduction in backorders by adding one unit to the inventory at base j is

1−∑x<sj pj(x|s0)

. Note also that Bj(0|s0) = µj.
Now suppose that s = s0 +1. The question we must answer is to which base should
this (s0 + 1)st unit of stock be allocated. To begin the process, set sj = 0 for all j.
We want to place the unit at the base that has the largest reduction in expected base
backorders resulting from the allocation; that is, assign the unit to the base having the
largest value of (1−pj(0|s0)). Since the functions Bj(sj|s0) are convex given s0 and are
strictly decreasing as sj increases, we can use a marginal analysis method to compute
the best allocation of a stock of s−s0 = a units knowing the best allocation of s−s0 =
a−1 units.
If ˜sj(a−1) represents the optimal stock level for base j given a−1 units are available
for allocation to the bases (given the value of s0), then the base that is allocated the next

8.1
The METRIC System
223
unit of stock is the one that has the maximum value of
 
1−
∑
x<˜sj(a−1)+1
pj(x|s0)
!
.
Observe that to calculate the marginal reduction in backorders for base j by adding an
additional unit of stock to that base we need to determine
∑
x<˜sj(a−1)+1
pj(x|s0) =
∑
x<˜sj(a−1)
pj(x|s0)+ pj(˜sj(a−1)+1).
But ∑x<˜sj(a−1) pj(x|s0) is known so that only pj(˜sj(a −1) + 1|s0) must be computed.
As observed earlier,
pj(˜sj(a−1)+1|s0) = p(˜sj(a−1)|s0)(r +(˜sj(a−1)+1)−1)
˜sj(a−1)+1
q.
Hence the function α(s,s0) can be computed very quickly for a large range of s values.
For example, we could choose to limit s by setting a minimum value for α(s,s0). That
is, when α(s,s0) < ε, then terminate the calculations.
The functions α(s,s0) must be calculated for all s0 ∈S.
Next, deﬁne
ˆα(s) = min
s0 α(s,s0).
The function ˆα(s) is a strictly decreasing function of s; however, it need not be con-
vex. As a consequence, we construct ˆαc(s), where ˆαc(s) is a piecewise linear convex
minorant to the function ˆα(s). Let ˆSc be the values of s at which the slope of ˆαc(s)
changes.
For example, suppose m = 10 bases, each of which has a daily expected demand rate
of .195 units. Further, assume the depot resupply time is 10 days and the depot-to-base
transit time is 1 day for all bases. Figure 8.2 contains the graph of ˆα(s). Table 8.7 shows
the values of ˆα(s) and s∗
0, the latter being the optimal depot stock levels corresponding
to the various values of total system stock s. Note that the optimal depot stock level
is not monotone non-decreasing as the total system stock increases. This illustrates
why this type of optimization problem is not easily solved. Note also that ˆα(s) is not
convex. Thus we construct its convex minorant, which is shown in Figure 8.3. In this
case, ˆSc = {35,36,41,42,43,44,45,46,48,54,55}.
Suppose we construct functions ˆαc
i (si) for all LRU types i, where si is the total
system stock for item type i. Rather than solving (8.1) for a speciﬁc target budget value
b, we will construct a tradeoff curve of total base backorders over all LRU types as a

marginal analysis algorithm.
Let s1

ered for LRU type i based on the construction of the convex piecewise linear function
ˆαc

i are the stock levels at which the slope of the total base

Increment ki∗= ki∗+1 and ℓ= ℓ+1, and recompute the value of ∆i∗(ski∗

values remain the same for all other values of i.
Repeat this process until there are no remaining values of ki to consider, that is,
ki = Ki for all i.
The process we have outlined can be used to compute the total expected base back-
order function for a ﬁnite set of the investment levels in LRU system inventory, as
depicted in Figure 8.4.

8.1.2.2.2
A Lagrangian Method for Computing Depot and Base Stock Levels
Let us now describe an alternative method for computing the depot and base stock
levels, that is, another method for solving (8.1). Roughly the algorithm works as fol-
lows. First construct a Lagrangian relaxation to (8.1) and then decompose it into a
collection of single-item problems, which are solved one at a time. The constraint that
is relaxed is the investment constraint. Thus there is only one Lagrangian multiplier in
the relaxed formulation of our problem. For each item, given the multiplier value, de-
termine the best depot and base stock levels using an enumeration method. This process
is repeated over various multiplier values to determine the solution to (8.1).

8.1
The METRIC System
227
This Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is based on an observation that the optimal
solution to a relaxed problem yields an optimal solution to (8.1) for a certain value of
b. By investigating an appropriate range of values for the Lagrangian multiplier we can
provide good, if not necessarily optimal, solutions for (8.1).
Let us begin by constructing the Lagrangian relaxation:

the previous section. The parameter θ represents the multiplier corresponding to the
constraint

For this formulation, θ > 0.
The Lagrangian relaxation may also be expressed as

for each item i independently of all other items.
In Chapter 7 we showed the expected backorder functions Bij(sij,si0) are convex
functions of sij for a given value of si0. However, the function is not necessarily jointly
convex in sij and si0, as we observed earlier. Thus to ﬁnd an optimal solution to (8.1),
given θ, we use an exhaustive search on the candidate depot stock levels.
Suppose θ assumes some value, say θℓ, and si0 is equal to ρ. Then we want to ﬁnd
the base stock levels that solve

that is, the relaxed optimization problem is also separable by base for each item, given
θℓand ρ.
The solution to
minBij(sij,ρ)+θℓcisij,
(8.6)
sij = 0,1,...,
can be found quite easily. The objective function to Problem (8.6) is discretely convex
in sij. Hence we can easily show, using a ﬁrst difference argument, that the optimal
value for sij is the smallest non-negative integer for which
∑
x≥sij+1
p(x|ρ) ≤θℓci or ∑
x≤sij
p(x|ρ) ≥1−θℓci,
where p(x|ρ) is the probability that there are x units in resupply at base j for item i
given si0 = ρ. These probabilities are computed as described in Section 8.1.2.1.
Observe that whenever θℓ≥1/ci, the optimal value for sij is 0. Thus a necessary
condition for sij > 0, for all i, is θℓ< mini 1/ci = 1/maxi ci.
We have shown how to ﬁnd the optimal values of the base stock levels given θℓand
ρ. To ﬁnd an optimal set of depot and base stock levels for a given value of θℓ, ﬁnd the
value of si0 = ρ for which
si0 = argmin

and the corresponding base stock level values, sij. As we have discussed earlier, the
range of depot stock levels that needs to be examined explicitly is limited because
Bi0(si0)/λi0 →0 rapidly as si0 exceeds λi0D, the expected depot demand over the depot
resupply time. In practical applications ⌊λi0D⌋is often a ﬂoor on si0.
Knowing the stock levels for the depot and bases, we also have the corresponding

Hence for every choice of θ there corresponds a required investment level in system
stock.
For practical problems there are bounds on the value of θ, too. Recall that for sij to
be positive, θ must be less than 1/ci. Hence a search for the optimal value is normally
conﬁned to the range 0 < θ < 1/maxci.
There are two very different ways that a Lagrangian-based algorithm can be em-
ployed in practice. In one approach a bisection method is used to ﬁnd the optimal value
of θ. Since a range of budget versus expected base level backorder values is often de-
sired, a second approach is sometimes implemented. In this second approach, a set of
M values for θ are prespeciﬁed, 0 < θ1 < ··· < θM < 1/maxci. These values are set on
the basis of experience in solving past problems. We now describe both approaches.
Algorithm 1
Step 1: Determine θmin and θmax, the minimum and maximum values considered for
θ. Set θ1 = (θmin +θmax)/2 and ℓ= 1
Step 2: Set θ = θℓ. For each item i, ﬁnd the depot and base stock levels that yield
minρ{W i
ρℓ}.
Step 3: Calculate C(θ) = ∑n
i=1 ci ∑m
j=0 sij(θ). If |C(θ) −b| < ε, stop; otherwise, if
C(θ) > b, set θmin = θℓ; otherwise set θmax = θℓ. Set θℓ= (θmax +θmin)/2, ℓ= ℓ+1,
and return to Step 2.
The number of iterations required to ﬁnd a good solution clearly depends on the
initial choices for θmin and θmax and ε. In real problems, when there is experience
in choosing the initial range of θ values and ε is set to be 1/2% of the budget, the
number of iterations required normally does not exceed 10. Nonetheless, a very large
number of calculations must be made repeatedly. The second algorithm requires fewer
calculations, as we will see. The second algorithm is as follows.

Step 1: Select a set of M multiplier values
0 < θ1 < θ2 < ··· < θM <

Step 2: For each item i, for each θℓ, solve

and obtain stock levels sij(θℓ) and ∑m
j=1 Bij(sij(θℓ),si0(θℓ)).
Step 3: Compute C(θℓ). Select the solution that has a budget closest to b.

230

A Tactical Planning Model
As mentioned, it may appear that the two approaches require the same computational
effort since the same calculations are performed in Step 2 in both cases. They are not
as similar as one might initially believe, because of the manner in which the second
algorithm is implemented.
For the second algorithm, let us examine how we compute W i
ρℓ. Recall that for a
given value of depot stock for item i, si0 = ρ, we ﬁnd the optimal base stock levels by
determining the smallest values of sij for which
∑
x≤sij
p(x|ρ) ≥1−θℓc.
Observe that when ℓ1 > ℓ2,
sij(θℓ1) ≤sij(θℓ2).
Thus, when we implement Algorithm 2, for a given ρ = si0, we make a single pass
through the base calculations and determine the optimal base stock levels for each value
of θ. Observe that we do not need to repeat the calculations made when ﬁnding sij(θM)
when we are ﬁnding sij(θM−1), since sij(θM) ≤sij(θM−1), given that ρ = si0. In prac-
tice, fewer calculations are required to implement the second algorithm. The second
algorithm is particularly useful when the goal is to understand the tradeoffs between
investment in system stock versus expected base level backorders.
8.2 Waiting Time Analysis
The optimization problem we have formulated has as its objective the minimization
of the total average number of outstanding LRU backorders at base level at a random
point in time. While the average number may be low for a particular LRU at a base and
the average waiting time may be low as well, there is a need to know how long a delay
could be experienced in responding to a request for resupply. In other words, what is the
probability distribution for the LRU resupply waiting time at either a base or the depot?
At base level, this time corresponds to the time until an aircraft is again operational; at
the depot, this time measures the time a resupply request is delayed prior to shipping a
unit to the requesting base.
We will now derive the distribution of waiting times assuming demands for resupply
occur according to a simple Poisson process and assuming resupply times are indepen-
dent and identically distributed random variables with density ψ(·) with mean T. Our
goal is to compute the probability that a failed LRU will wait longer than a time u given

8.2
Waiting Time Analysis
231
that a demand for resupply occurred at time t. We also assume a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-serve
queue discipline is followed.
Let us begin by deﬁning some notation. Let
W(t) be the waiting time random variable for satisfying an LRU demand occurring
at time t,
I(t) be the net inventory random variable of the LRU just before time t,
X(t) be the random variable for the number of LRU units in the resupply process just
before time t, which does not include the demand occurring at time t,
V1(t,u) be a random variable measuring the number of LRUs completing repair in
the interval (t,t + u] that were in the resupply system at time t (i.e., failed during
(0,t) but were not repaired by time t),
V2(t,u) be a random variable measuring the number of LRUs completing repair in
(t,t +u] that entered the repair cycle during (t,t +u],
V(t,u) = V1(t,u)+V2(t,u), and
F(x) =
R x
0 ψ(y)dy, which is the probability that an LRU repair is completed in x or
fewer time units.
The LRU resupply request at time t will remain unﬁlled for a period of time greater
than u if and only if the number of units in resupply at the point in time t at which
the resupply request is made is s units or greater (s is the stock level) and the number
of units completing repair during (t,t +u] is insufﬁcient to satisfy that request by time
t +u. Thus
W(t) > u if and only if I(t)+V(t,u)+r(u) ≤0,
where r(u) = 1 if the repair cycle time of the unit that failed at time t is less than or
equal to u and is 0, otherwise.
Since s = I(t)+X(t) for all t,
I(t)+V(t,u)+r(u) ≤0 implies s−X(t)+V(t,u)+r(u) ≤0,
or s ≤X(t) −V(t,u) −r(u) = X1(t + u) −V2(t,u) −r(u), where X1(t + u) = X(t) −
V1(t,u), that is, the number of LRUs in the resupply system at time t + u that failed
during (0,t). Therefore
P{W(t) > u} = P{X1(t +u)−V2(t,u)−r(u) ≥s}.
Observe that the random variables X1(t +u), V2(t,u), and r(u) are independent since
LRUs requiring repair that arrive prior to t in no way inﬂuence arrivals requiring repair
subsequent to time t in terms of timing, quantity, or repair times. The repair time of the

232
8

failed LRU occurring at time t is also unaffected by those arrival times and the repair
times of LRUs failing both prior to and subsequent to time t.
Let p1(t) be the probability that an arrival in (0,t) remains in the resupply system at
time t +u, that is,
p1(t) = 1
t
Z t

and p0 be the probability that an LRU that failed during the interval (t,t +u] completes
its repair by time t +u, that is,
p0 = 1
u
Z u
0 F(u−v)dv.
Then, following the reasoning presented in Chapter 7,
P{X1(t +u) = k} = e−λtp1(t) (λtp1(t))k

.
To determine the probability that W(t) > u we consider two cases. In the ﬁrst case,
X1(t +u) = s+k, k ≥1, and V2(t,u) < k. That is, the number of LRU units remaining
in the resupply system at time t +u that correspond to LRU failures that occurred prior
to time t is s+k, and additionally, less than k LRUs complete repair in (t,t +u] of the
units that failed in (t,t + u]. Since we assume demands are satisﬁed on a ﬁrst-come,
ﬁrst-served basis, the LRU demand that occurred at time t cannot be satisﬁed by time
t +u.
In the second case, s+k, k ≥0, LRUs are in resupply at time t +u that correspond
to resupply requests that were placed prior to t. Furthermore, exactly k units completed
repair during (t,t +u] that correspond to LRUs entering the repair cycle during (t,t +u].
Thus, in this second case, the resupply request made at time t will remain unﬁlled if and
only if the repair cycle time of the requesting unit exceeds u.

which represents the steady state probability that k LRUs that were in the resupply
system at the time an LRU fails remain in the resupply system u time units later. Let W

This waiting time distribution could be used to establish minimum depot LRU stock
levels. If there is a desire to ensure that replenishment of base inventories is not delayed
by more than u days due to the lack of depot stock with probability α, then the minimum
depot stock level can be set accordingly. Note that P{W(t) > u} requires an explicit
statement of the repair cycle time distribution F(·). Thus F(·) will have to be estimated
to make the required calculations.

8.3 Exercises
8.1. Suppose we have a two-echelon base-depot system as discussed in Section 8.1.1.
The demand process at each of 10 bases is a Poisson process, where each base has a
demand rate of .5 units per day. Suppose the average depot-to-base order and ship time
is either 1, 5, or 10 days. Further assume the average depot resupply time is either 15
or 30 days. All failed parts at the bases are repaired at the depot.
(a) Plot δ(si0) for each base.
(b) Compute the average base resupply time as a function of si0 for each depot-to-
base order and ship time and each average depot resupply time combination. How
important a factor is the depot stock level in each case?
(c) Suppose the demand at each base is described by a negative binomial distribution
with an average of .5 units per day at each base. Suppose that the variance-to-mean
ratio is identical at all bases, and is equal to either 1.01, 2, 5, or 10. Assuming de-
mands are independent among the bases, what is the distribution of depot demand?
Repeat the tasks indicated in (a) and (b) for these cases. How do the values compare
with those computed initially?
8.2. Suppose we are managing the two-echelon system discussed in Section 8.1.1. De-
mands at each of 10 bases for an item occur according to a Poisson process with a rate
of .5 units per day. The average depot-to-base resupply time, Aij, for the item is 5 days
for all 10 bases, and the average depot resupply time, D, is 30 days. Suppose the frac-
tion of the failures that arise at each of the bases that are repaired at the bases is either
.25, .5, or .75. Further assume the average base repair time for the item is 2 days.
Compute the mean and variance of the number of units in resupply for a base for
each case for a range of values of the depot stock level. How does the variance-to-mean
ratio change as the fraction of units repaired at the depot increases when the depot stock
is equal to ⌊λ0D⌋, where λ0 is the average depot daily demand rate?
8.3. In Section 8.1.2.1 we derived expressions for the mean and variance for the number
of units in resupply for an LRU at a base. The analysis was based on the assumption that
the demand process is a Poisson process. Suppose that the demand process is negative
binomially distributed rather than Poisson distributed. Construct new equations for the
mean and variance of the number of units in resupply for LRU at a base. Carefully state
your assumptions as you develop these expressions.
8.4. Assume there are three items whose stock levels need to be determined in a two-
echelon system.
Removals of item i at base j occur according to a Poisson process at rate λij units
per day. When a removal occurs at a base, three events take place simultaneously and

instantaneously. First, a unit of stock is withdrawn from base stock (if a unit is avail-
able); second, the failed unit is sent to the depot where it will be repaired; and third, the
depot resupplies the base (if a unit is on hand). When units of stock are not available,
backorders occur. If there is a backorder at a base, then an aircraft is grounded. If a
backorder occurs at the depot, then there is a delay in resupplying the requesting base.
The depot repair cycle time for all bases for part type i is denoted by Di, measured
in days. The order and shipping time from the depot to each base is Ai days for item i.
There are 10 bases in the system, numbered 1 through 10. The ﬂying activity at bases
1 through 5 is the same and hence λi1 = ··· = λi5 for all i. Bases 6 through 8 have
identical removal rates for all items, that is, λi6 = λi7 = λi8. Finally, bases 9 and 10
have identical removal rates for each of the three items, λi9 = λi10. The data in the
following table indicate the removal rates, depot repair cycle times, and unit costs for
the three items. The value of Ai is two days for all three items for all bases.

Reorder Point, Lot Size Models: The Continuous
Review Case
When there is a signiﬁcant ﬁxed cost incurred when placing an order with a supplier, it
is no longer beneﬁcial to order each time a demand occurs. In Chapter 2 we examined
the impact of ﬁxed costs on ordering quantities when the demand processes were known
with certainty. Now we will study situations in which signiﬁcant ﬁxed ordering costs
are incurred and the demand process is assumed to be a stationary stochastic process.
Furthermore, we will assume a transaction reporting system exists. That is, we assume
that we monitor the inventory levels continuously through time, and place an order for
a quantity of stock, called the lot size, at a point in time so as to minimize the average
annual cost of operations.
We will conﬁne our attention to developing models for controlling inventories at
a single location. To begin, we will also limit attention to managing a single item.
Later, we will examine models in which we consider the interactions of many items on
stocking decisions.
The type of model that we will discuss in greatest depth in this chapter is called a
reorder point, lot size model. When employing this model, we assume a constant lot
size of Q units is ordered whenever an order is placed. The timing of the placement of
orders depends on the underlying demand process. In general, the best time to place
an order can depend on two factors. First, we should know the amount of inventory on
hand, on order, and, when appropriate, the number of outstanding backorders. Second,
we may also have to know when the last demand occurred. In our analysis, we will
ignore the second factor. We will only consider the inventory levels (on-hand, net in-
ventory, or inventory position) when making a procurement decision. Thus when the
appropriate inventory level reaches a particular value, called the reorder point, an order
is placed. This reorder point is denoted by r. Implicitly, by ignoring the second factor,
we are assuming that the demand process possesses the memory-less property. In fact,
our analysis is largely based on the assumption that the demand process is a station-

Reorder Point, Lot Size Models: The Continuous Review Case
ary Poisson process or some related process, such as a compound Poisson process. We
will also construct approximations of the probability distribution for key random vari-
ables and of the objective function. These approximations are made only to simplify
calculations; but, as we will discuss in detail, the results are just approximations.
The lot size–reorder point models are often denoted as (Q,r) models. Note that by
their construction, such models are also based on the assumption that the reorder point
is reached every time an order is to be placed. That is, there is no overshoot of the
reorder point. When the demand process is a Poisson process, for example, demands
occur for a single unit at a time. Hence if the reorder point is an integer, the reorder
point will be reached each time an order is to be placed.
When the number of units demanded in a customer order is described by a second
random variable, then there is no assurance that this reorder point will be hit in each
order cycle. In these cases, policies other than a (Q,r) policy must be employed.
Most inventory control systems found in practice are not strictly continuous review
or transaction reporting systems. While customer orders are often captured as they arise,
orders are very frequently placed periodically, such as daily. For example, a car dealer
records the removal of parts used to repair cars on a continuing basis, but normally
places orders to replenish inventories only daily. Thus the (Q,r) models that we will
construct are usually approximations. Nonetheless, these models are widely used in
practice, and they most often provide nearly optimal values for the operating policy
parameters.
Our primary goals in this chapter are to develop models based on the (Q,r) operat-
ing policy that can be used to ﬁnd the policy parameter values that minimize average
annual operating costs. We will also discuss how the optimal parameter values can be
computed. The ﬁrst model, which is an approximation, is widely discussed in texts and
often used in practice. We will follow this discussion with the development of an exact
model, and we will use it to demonstrate the effects of using the simple approximation
model. The exact model is based on the assumption that the demand process is a Poisson
process. We will also show how approximations to key performance measures can be
constructed when a normal distribution is used to represent demand over a lead time.
All of the aforementioned models and accompanying algorithms and heuristics used
to compute values for Q and r are designed to optimize the performance for a single
item managed at a single location. After completing these analyses, we will examine
an approximation that was developed by the U.S. Air Force and currently deployed
throughout the Department of Defense and elsewhere for managing large numbers of
item types at a single location. These models consider system performance constraints
(ﬁll rates, backorder constraints, etc.) that capture the system effects of the reorder
points and reorder quantities selected for each item. We will also brieﬂy discuss models
for cases in which demands are not always for single units. In these cases, an overshoot
of the reorder point is possible and hence an alternative policy must be employed.

9.1
An Approximate Model When Backordering Is Permitted
239
9.1 An Approximate Model When Backordering Is Permitted
The (Q,r) model we are about to discuss is an approximation, which is based on many
assumptions. As we will see, this model is easy to understand and use; however, as is
the case with all models, one must be aware of the impact that assumptions play on the
resulting values of the policy parameters.
As we have mentioned, our goal is to construct a model, based on following a (Q,r)
policy, for managing a single item at a single location. We will show how to ﬁnd the
optimal policy parameters, Q∗and r∗, derived from this model. These values will be
found by minimizing the average annual costs that vary with the values of these policy
parameters.
9.1.1 Assumptions
Let us begin by stating some of our assumptions. First, the costs considered in the
model are (1) ﬁxed order costs, denoted by K and measured in dollars per order; (2)
backorder costs, denoted by π, which are charged for each unit that is backordered; and
(3) carrying costs or holding costs, which are denoted by h, and are the cost of carrying
a unit of stock on hand for a year.
Perhaps the key assumption in the development of the model is that there is never
more than a single order outstanding at any point in time. This implies that whenever
we reach the reorder point, there is no order outstanding. We will also assume that
the reorder point is non-negative. While this is normally the case in practice, there
are instances in which this assumption is not appropriate. As you read through this
material, try to think of such cases. On the basis of our assumptions, the reorder point
will be reached when the on-hand stock is non-negative. As we will see, normally the
reorder point will be based on the system’s inventory position. However, since in this
case when the reorder point is reached there are no orders outstanding and there are
also no backorders, then the inventory position equals the on-hand inventory at the time
a procurement order is placed. The assumptions also imply that the demand over a lead
time never exceeds Q. Otherwise another order would need to be placed and thus more
than one order would be outstanding. Therefore, in practice, Q must be much larger
than the expected demand over a lead time. For example, suppose a lead time is a week
and the expected demand over a week is 100 units with a standard deviation of 10 units.
Suppose further that Q is 400 units. Then it is very unlikely that demand over a lead
time would exceed 400 units.
Another assumption is that backorders are not desirable. Let us deﬁne a cycle to be
the time between the receipt of two successive orders. If backorders are incurred in a

240
9
Reorder Point, Lot Size Models: The Continuous Review Case
cycle, then they occur only at the end of a cycle. That is, the average number of out-
standing backorders at a random point in time during a cycle is very small compared
to the average amount of stock on hand. This assumption is illustrated in the following
ﬁgure, in which we plot the dynamics of net inventory (on-hand minus backorders) and
inventory position, where τ is the procurement lead time. Note that in the four cycles,
backorders occurred in two of them. However, the magnitude of the cumulative back-
orders over these four cycles is small so that the average number of units backordered
at a random point in time in these cycles is quite small. Observe also that the length
of a cycle varies from one cycle to the next owing to the random nature of the demand
process.
Fig. 9.1. Inventory dynamics.
Next, we assume that the demand process is a stationary continuous process, as
illustrated in Figure 9.1. We let f(·) represent the density function for the demand over
a lead time. We assume that the lead time can be a random variable; however,
µ =
Z ∞
0 xf(x) dx,
the expected lead time demand, is assumed to be much smaller than Q.
9.1.2 Constructing the Model
Let us now construct the objective function. Since all demand is met, that is, there
are no lost sales, the expected variable procurement cost Cλ does not depend on the

9.1
An Approximate Model When Backordering Is Permitted
241
policy parameters and hence need not be included in the objective function. However,
the ﬁxed procurement cost does depend on the value of Q. Suppose λ is the average
annual demand rate. Then the average number of orders placed per year is λ
Q. Since the
ﬁxed cost of placing an order is K, the average annual ﬁxed ordering cost is λ
QK.
To calculate the expected shortage cost per year, we determine the expected number
of backorders per cycle, multiply this quantity by the expected number of cycles per
year, λ
Q, and multiply the resultant amount by π.
Once the reorder point is reached in a cycle, the amount of demand that occurs from
that point in time until the order arrives determines the number of backorders, if any,
that will occur in that cycle. Let x represent the demand over the lead time. A backorder
will occur if and only if x > r. If x > r, then x−r measures the number of backordered
units. Hence
Z ∞
r (x−r) f(x) dx
measures the expected number of backorders per cycle. Consequently,
π λ
Q
Z ∞
r (x−r)f(x) dx
measures the expected annual backorder costs that will be incurred.
Finally, let us calculate the average annual cost of carrying inventory. Recall that
net inventory = on-hand inventory−backorders.
The time average of net inventory is
E[net inventory] = E[on hand] −E[backorders].
Recall from our earlier comments that we assume the costs are such that backorders
are incurred in relatively small quantities and then only at the end of a cycle. As we
discussed, this implies that the average number of outstanding backorders existing at a
random point in time is negligible compared with the total inventory carried on hand
over a cycle. That is,
E[backorders] ≈0.
As a consequence,
E[net inventory] ≈E[on hand].
We will therefore approximate E[on hand] by E[net inventory].
Let s measure the safety stock. Recall that the safety stock measures the expected net
inventory just before the arrival of an order and s+Q is the expected on-hand inventory
just after the arrival of an order. We assume that, in expectation, the demand is occurring

at rate λ. Hence the average net inventory during a cycle is 1

But
s =

Q∗=

(9.5)
and
¯F(r∗) = Q∗h
πλ .
(9.6)
Observe that we now have two non-linear equations to solve to obtain Q∗and r∗. Thus
a numerical procedure is required to ﬁnd these values. Let us now present such an
algorithm.
Observe from (9.5) that Q∗is always at least as large as the economic order quantity,
p
2λK/h, which we denote by QE. In practice Q∗is normally greater than QE. This is
an interesting observation. To avoid incurring backorders, and the corresponding back-
order costs, purchase more each time an order is placed than you would if demand
occurred at a known constant and continuous rate. Do this even though the expected
carrying costs are higher than in the corresponding deterministic demand case.
Observe also from (9.6) that Q∗h
πλ must be less than or equal to 1 for the relationship
to make sense. This result occurs because we assumed that the expected number of
backorders outstanding at a random point in time is negligible when constructing the
approximate expression for the average on-hand inventory. That is, this model is based
on the assumption that the expected number of backorders incurred per cycle, g(r), is
small relative to the average number of demands per cycle, Q.
The following procedure can be employed to ﬁnd Q∗and r∗.
Algorithm for Finding Q∗and r∗.
Step 1: Set Q1 = QE,n = 1.
Step 2: Find rn that satisﬁes ¯F(rn) = Qnh
πλ .
Step 3: Using rn, compute Qn+1 =
r
2λ(K +πg(rn))
h
.

244

Reorder Point, Lot Size Models: The Continuous Review Case
Step 4: If Qn+1 −Qn ≤ε, stop; otherwise, set n = n + 1 and return to Step 2. The
desired tolerance, ε, satisﬁes ε > 0 and is assumed to be small relative to QE.
Observe from (9.5) and (9.6) that as Q increases, r decreases, or as r increases, Q
decreases, which is intuitive, but also follows from the fact that
dQ
dr = −πλ
h · f(r) and dr
dQ = −h

f(r) < 0.
The algorithm is initiated with a known lower bound on Q∗, QE, which, in turn, yields
an upper bound on r∗, r1.
Convergence of this procedure depends on two critical factors. First, a solution to
(9.5) and (9.6) must exist. This depends on the assumption that the average number
of backorders outstanding at a random point in time is negligible and that the other
assumptions on which the model was developed hold. Second, convergence of the pro-
posed iterative procedure to an optimal solution can be guaranteed only if the objective
function is convex. Unfortunately, the latter condition need not be true, although, as we
are about to see, the objective function is convex in the region containing an optimal
solution for commonly used density functions for demand over a lead time.
9.1.4 Convexity of the Objective Function
For C(Q,r) to be convex, each term must be jointly convex in Q and r. Clearly, we see
from (9.1) that the terms λK
Q , hQ
2 , and h[r −µ] are each convex functions of a single
variable. The third term λ
Qg(r) would need to be jointly convex in Q and r for C(Q,r)
to be convex. But λ
Qg(r) need not be convex, even though for a given value of Q, it is
convex in r and for a given value of r it is convex in Q. Let E(Q,r) = λ
Qg(r). But for
E(Q,r) to be convex in any direction from any point in Q > 0 and r ≥0, the Hessian
matrix

must be positive semi-deﬁnite. This implies that the diagonal elements of this matrix
are non-negative and that its determinant is also non-negative. The following theorem
establishes when E(Q,r) is convex.
Theorem 9.1. Suppose there exists a real number a such that f(x) is differentiable and
non-increasing for x ≥a. Then E(Q,r) is convex in the region Q > 0, a ≤r < ∞.
Proof. Suppose f(x) is the density for lead time demand and

⊓⊔
Observe that if f(x) has an exponential distribution, then a = 0; if f(x) has a normal
distribution, then a equals the expected demand over a lead time, µ. If backorders are
to be avoided, then it is likely that the optimal safety stock will be non-negative, and
therefore r∗≥µ. Because the algorithm begins with r1 ≥r∗and r decreases at each
iteration of the procedure, the search will be conﬁned to the region in which the objec-
tive function is convex. This is a particularly useful observation since, in practice, lead

246

time demand is very often approximated by a normal distribution. Let us now examine
this special case more closely.
9.1.5 Lead Time Demand Is Normally Distributed
As mentioned, a special case arises when f(x) is a normal density used to approximate
the lead time demand with expected lead time demand denoted by µ and standard de-
viation denoted by σ. Recall from (9.6) that r is chosen to satisfy ¯F(r) = Qh
πλ . Thus it
is imperative to note that the only portion of the distribution function used to represent
demand over a lead time that is of importance is its upper tail. Since
f(x) =
1
√
2πσ e−1
2 ( x−µ
σ )2
is the normal density, this upper tail is relatively “light.” That is, the exponent increases
as the square of x, which means that the area in the tail becomes small quickly.
Compare this with the case when we approximate the lead time density with an
exponential distribution with mean µ. Then ¯F(x) = e−x/µ, which has a heavier upper
tail since the exponent is proportional to x rather than x2. Selecting a model to repre-
sent lead time demand requires only selecting the probability model whose upper tail
matches the data pertaining to forecast errors in an accurate manner. By choosing a
normal distribution as this model, we are implicitly saying that the upper tail behaves
in a way that is represented by that type of density function.
Let us now see how to compute g(r) when f(x) is a normal density. Recall that
g(r) =
Z ∞
r (x−r)f(x) dx =
Z ∞
r xf(x) dx−r ¯F(r).
But

Let us now illustrate the mechanics of the algorithm on a few example problems.
In the ﬁrst example, suppose λ = 100, K = 200, h = 4, and π = 30, and that lead time
demand is normally distributed with µ = 10 and σ = 3. To ﬁnd Q∗and r∗, we will make
use of some tables to compute g(r). Let k = r−µ
σ , or r = µ +kσ, and
G(k) = φ(k)−k ¯Φ(k).
Then, using (9.8), we see that g(r) = σG(k). The function G(k), the standard normal
loss function, is available in Microsoft’s Excel library or in tabular form in some texts.
Note that g(r) is a linear function of σ. Double σ for a given value of r (or k) and
g(r) doubles as well. This is an important property and is one reason why the normal
distribution is used in commercial applications.
Returning to the example problem, we see that the algorithm proceeds as follows.
Iteration 1
Step 1: QE =

Step 2: ¯Φ(r1) = Q1h

r1 = 10+(1.11×3) = 13.33
(k = 1.11),
g(r1) = 3·(.06727) = .20181.

Step 3: Q2 =

10000+ 200·(.20181)·30

= 101.5.
Step 4: If ε = .1,Q2 −Q1 > ε. Set n = 2 and return to Step 2 to initiate the second
iteration.
Iteration 2
Step 2:
¯Φ(r2) = .1353 and
r2 = (1.10)·(3)+10 = 13.3,
(k = 1.10)
g(r2) = 3·(.06862) = .20586.
Step 3:
Q3 =
p
10000+1500·(.20586)
= 101.5.
Step 4: Since Q3 −Q2 < ε, stop. Q∗∼= 101.5 and r∗= 13.3 (k = 1.10).
Now suppose that again λ = 100, K = 200, and h = 4. But now suppose µ = 50 and
σ = 25. Table 9.1 shows how Q∗and r∗vary as a function of π. As expected, the desire

to avoid stockouts during a
cycle increases as the stock-
out cost increases. The value
of r∗increases substantially
as π increases, and r∗is a
concave increasing function
of π. In contrast, Q∗is rela-
tively insensitive to the value
of π. Once ¯Φ(r1), as a func-
tion of π, assumes a value
less than .15, Q∗is almost constant. Note that Q∗is a decreasing convex function of π.
9.1.6 Alternative Heuristics for Computing Lot Sizes and Reorder Points
There are many approaches to computing lot sizes and reorder points in practice. A
common method for computing safety stock is to set its value at some number of weeks

9.1
An Approximate Model When Backordering Is Permitted
249
of supply. Some companies choose to set safety stock equal to a given number of es-
timated standard deviations of lead time demand. Such practices can lead to very poor
and costly results.
Other simple rules are employed to compute Q and r, too. Since stockout costs are
inherently difﬁcult to determine exactly, companies sometimes choose to set perfor-
mance targets rather than to establish the value of π.
Two performance constraints are commonly employed. In fact, we have observed
that practitioners often do not know the difference between the two. The ﬁrst perfor-
mance constraint stipulates the maximum probability of running out of stock during a
cycle. The second is a ﬁll rate target, that is, the fraction of customers whose demands
are satisﬁed on time. The latter is often expressed as
1−expected shortages per year
expected demand per year .
Furthermore, the expected number of shortages per year is stated as the expected
number of cycles per year times the expected number of shortages per cycle, where
the expected number of shortages per cycle is calculated as g(r). Thus the ﬁll rate is
approximated as
1−
λ
Qg(r)
λ
= 1−g(r)
Q .
But remember, g(r)
Q is just an approximation. It is accurate only when there is only a
maximum of one order outstanding at a point in time. As we will see in the following
section, 1
Q{g(r) −g(r + Q)} provides an exact method for measuring the fraction of
customer demands that are not satisﬁed immediately. The term g(r + Q) measures the
expected demand in excess of r +Q over a lead time. If we assume demand over a lead
time cannot exceed Q, then g(r +Q) = 0.
Suppose, rather than providing a value for π, we assume that Q and r are determined
as follows. Let a be the maximum probability of a stockout during a lead time. Then
¯F(r) ≤a. To ﬁnd the values for Q and r, solve the following optimization problem:
min
Q,r≥0

(9.9)
subject to
¯F(r) ≤a.
(9.10)
Notice that Q and r can be determined separately. The optimizing value of Q is QE.
Since h · r is minimized by making r as small as possible, ¯F(r) = a in the optimal
solution, and hence r = ¯F−1(a). But is this a formulation that is reasonable? We ask
you to discuss this model as an exercise.

250

Reorder Point, Lot Size Models: The Continuous Review Case
Although the model described in (9.9) and (9.10) is usually not stated formally, the
solution derived from this model is often found in commercial software.
Another possible approach, which avoids some of the pitfalls present in (9.9) and
(9.10) is as follows. Suppose we solve the problem
min
Q,r≥0C(Q,r)
(9.11)
subject to
¯F(r) = a,
(9.12)
while avoiding specifying the value of π. Since (9.12) holds, we know that r = ¯F−1(a).
Recall also from our earlier model (Equation (9.6)) that
¯F(r) = Qh
πλ or π =
Qh
¯F(r)·λ .
(9.13)
One of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions for Problem (9.11) and (9.12) implies that
Q =

(9.14)
which is the same expression as (9.5). Suppose we use (9.13) to estimate the value of π
and substitute this value for π in (9.14). Then we have the approximate value
Q = g(r)

(9.15)
Observe that this proposed approximation avoids a major problem that arises when
employing the ﬁrst approximation.
To illustrate this approach, suppose λ = 100, K = 200, h = 4, and demand is nor-
mally distributed with µ = 50 and σ = 25. Suppose a = .15.
First, r = ¯F−1(.15) = 75.75 or k = 1.03, approximately. Then from (9.15)
Q = 1.967

Note that if π = (113.96)·4
(.15)(100) = 30.38 ≈30, we obtain approximately the same answer as
presented in Table 9.1.
Let us analyze one additional approximate model in which a ﬁll rate constraint is
imposed, where

is used as an approximation to the ﬁll rate. Suppose the ﬁll rate target is set so that

Reorder Point, Lot Size Models: The Continuous Review Case
We now illustrate how (9.19) through (9.22) can be used to construct a heuristic for
solving Problem (9.17) and (9.18).
Heuristic for Solving Problem (9.17), (9.18)
Step 1: Set Q1 = QE and n = 1.
Step 2: Find rn such that g(rn) = aQn.
Step 3: Using (9.22), calculate Qn+1.
Step 4: If Qn+1 −Qn < ε, stop; otherwise, set n = n+1 and return to Step 2.
Let us show how this heuristic applies to ﬁnding Q∗and r∗for the following parameter
settings. Suppose λ = 100,K = 200,h = 4, demand is normally distributed with mean
demand over a lead time of 10 and a standard deviation of 3 units. Suppose a = .002.
Let ε = .1.
Then the heuristic proceeds as follows.
Iteration 1
Step 1: Q1 = QEOQ = 100.
Step 2: g(r1) = (.002)(100) = .2 = 3·G(k1) or k1 = 1.12 and r1 = 13.36.

or k2 = 1.11 and r2 = 13.33.
Step 3: Q3 = 101.53.
Step 4: Since |Q3 −Q2| < ε, stop, with r = 13.33 and Q = 101.53.
Observe that this solution closely matches the one found in the ﬁrst example in

9.1.7 Final Comments on the Approximate Model
The models discussed in Section 9.1 are all based on the key assumption that no more
than one order should be outstanding at any point in time. Furthermore, the models all
employed an approximation of the average quantity of on-hand inventory. This approx-
imation is based on the assumption that the average number of outstanding backorders
at a random point in time is negligible. These assumptions hold only when Q is so
much greater than µ so that the likelihood of more than one order will be outstanding at
any point in time is negligible, and when the backorder cost is sufﬁciently large so that
the average number of outstanding backorders at a random point in time is very small
compared with the average amount of on-hand inventory.
In Section 9.2 we will develop exact models that are based on different, and, in
many ways, less restrictive assumptions. In particular, these models will not require us
to make either of the key assumptions discussed in the previous paragraph.
9.2 An Exact Model
Let us now develop a model that is based on an exact representation of the station-
ary probability distribution of net inventory. Using this distribution, we will be able to
compute the exact values of the expectations found in the model’s objective function.
This exact representation will be developed on the basis of the assumption that the un-
derlying demand process is a stationary Poisson process. This implies that units are
demanded one by one and that the time between arriving demands is exponentially dis-
tributed. We let λ represent the annual demand rate. We further assume that the order
lead time is a constant, which we denote by τ and is measured in years. Finally, since
the demand process is described by a discrete random variable, both Q and r will be
integer-valued.
Let us make an important observation. Since we assume the demand process is a
Poisson process, it is possible for demand over a lead time to be large enough so that
more than one order can be outstanding at a point in time. Hence we will no longer
assume that the maximum number of outstanding orders at any point in time is one.
Furthermore, this implies that we cannot use the on-hand inventory level as a basis for
placing orders. The reorder point will now be based on the system’s inventory position.
Recall that the inventory position random variable measures the amount of on-hand
plus on-order minus backorders at any point in time. Note that if demand over a lead
time is large and Q is small, then several orders may be outstanding at a point in time.
Once Q units are demanded following the placement of the preceding order, a new
procurement order is placed. Thus in this system, when a demand arises that reduces the

254
9
Reorder Point, Lot Size Models: The Continuous Review Case
inventory position to r units, an order is placed immediately for Q units, which raises the
inventory position to r+Q units. Consequently, the inventory position random variable
assumes only one of the values r + 1,...,r + Q. Since a customer demand occurring
when the inventory position random variable equals r + 1 automatically triggers an
order to be placed, the inventory position random variable does not assume the value of
r for a positive amount of time.
Our analysis will proceed as follows. We will ﬁrst derive the stationary probability
distribution of the inventory position random variable. Using this distribution, we will
determine the stationary probability distribution for net inventory, which, in turn, will
permit us to compute a variety of performance measures.
9.2.1 Determining the Stationary Distribution of the Inventory Position
Random Variable
Recall that the inventory position random variable assumes only values in the set
{r + 1,...,r + Q} for a positive amount of time. Let I represent the inventory position
random variable.
The graph in Figure 9.2 indicates the transitions the random variable I makes through
time. The length of time in any state r+ j, j = 1,...,Q, is exponentially distributed with

that is, the value of r + j. A

r + Q, the initiation of a cycle, and the termination of a cycle, which occurs when the
Qth subsequent demand occurs in the cycle. The expected cycle length is just Q/λ.
Note that the process we have described is a renewal process. As a consequence,
P[I = r + j] = E[time the system is in state r + j during a cycle]

Thus the inventory position random variable possesses a uniform distribution. Note that
as long as the arrival process is a renewal process, I will have a uniform distribution.
9.2.2 Determining the Stationary Distribution of the Net Inventory Random
Variable
Now that we have determined that I has a uniform distribution, we can use this result to
establish the stationary probability distribution for the net inventory random variable,
which we denote by N.
Suppose we step into the system’s operation at a random point in time t. At time
t −τ, I must assume one of the values r+1,...,r+Q. Suppose at time t −τ, I = r+ j.
Then, at time t, N can assume only one of the values r + j,r + j −1,r + j −2,....
N cannot exceed r + j since any unit ordered subsequent to time t −τ will not arrive
prior to time t. Furthermore, every unit ordered by time t −τ will have arrived by time
t. Hence r+ j units are available by time t to meet the demands that arise in the interval
of time (t −τ,t]. Thus the net inventory will be n units at time t if and only if exactly
r + j −n units were demanded in the period of length τ preceding t.
Let
p(y;λτ) = e−λτ (λτ)y
y!
,
(9.24)
P[N = n] be the probability that the net inventory random variable equals n, and
P(y;λτ) =

∑
u=y
p(u;λτ).
(9.25)
Suppose ﬁrst that n ≤r. The inventory position at time t −τ can assume any value in
{r +1,...,r +Q} and have N = n at time t. The probability that N = n at time t given
that I = r + j at time t −τ is p(r + j −n;λτ), which is independent of t. Furthermore,
P(I = r + j] = 1

P[N = n] =

when n ≤r.
Suppose next that n > r. Then the inventory position cannot be less than n at time
t −τ. In fact, the inventory position at time t −τ must be an element of the set {n,n+
1,...,r +Q}. Consequently,
P[N = n] = 1

Now that we have shown how to compute P[N = n], let us compute several perfor-
mance measures of interest.
9.2.3 Computing Performance Measures
There are several performance measures that are of importance, the probability that an
arriving customer will not ﬁnd stock on the shelf (which is the probability that net in-
ventory is not positive), the average number of backorder incidents per year, the average
number of backorders outstanding at a random point in time, and the average amount
of on-hand inventory.
Let the probability that the system is out of stock at a random point in time be
denoted by Pout. By the PASTA (Poisson arrivals see time averages) principle, this is
also the probability that an arriving customer will ﬁnd no stock on the shelf. When
N = −n, n = 0,1,..., there is no stock on the shelf and therefore
Pout =
∞
∑
n=0
P[N = −n].

Q{g(r)−g(r +Q)},
(9.29)
where g( j) = ∑∞
u= j+1 P(u;λτ). Hence g(r) measures the expected demand in excess of
r over a period of length τ. Likewise, g(r + Q) equals the expected demand in excess
of r + Q over a period of length τ. Recall that in our approximate model we assumed
that g(r +Q) = 0.
The ﬁll rate is given by 1−Pout. Note that by ignoring the term g(r+Q), we overstate
the ﬁll rate. The extent of this overstatement depends of course on the magnitude of
g(r +Q).
The expected number of backorder incidents per year equals the expected number
of demands per year, λ, times the probability that an arriving order will not be satisﬁed
immediately. Let E(Q,r) denote this quantity. Then
E(Q,r) = λPout.
(9.30)
In the approximate model developed in Section 9.1, we assumed
E(Q,r) = λ
Qg(r),
which overstates the true expected number of backorders per year.
Next, let us compute the average number of backorders outstanding at a random
point in time, which we denote by B(Q,r). Since backorders exist when N is negative,
B(Q,r) =
∞
∑
n=1
nP[N = −n].
From (9.26),

P(j +1;λτ),
which we leave as an exercise to establish. Also note that G(j) measures the expected
time-weighted demand in excess of j over a period of length τ, that is, the time-
weighted backorders.
The ﬁnal performance measure we will compute is the expected on-hand inventory
at a random point in time. Let OH(Q,r) denote this quantity.
Recall that
E[I] = OH(Q,r)+E[on order]−B(Q,r).
Since, from Little’s law, E[on order] = λτ = µ and E[I] = Q+1
2
+r, we have
OH(Q,r) = Q+1
2
+r −µ +B(Q,r).
(9.32)
9.2.4 Average Annual Cost Expression
Now that we have shown how the various performance measures can be calculated
exactly, we are in a position to state the corresponding exact expression for the average
annual variable costs. We will use the nomenclature introduced in Section 9.1, with one
addition. Let ¯π represent the cost incurred per unit backordered for a year. Then
C(Q,r) = λK
Q +h
Q+1
2
+r −µ

+πE(Q,r)+(h+ ¯π)B(Q,r).
(9.33)
9.2.5 Waiting Time Analysis
Let us now explore how the probability distribution for the number of backorders out-
standing at a random point in time can be used to ascertain the expectation and variance
of the length of time customers will wait for service.
Suppose we let ¯N be a random variable for the number of outstanding backorders in
equilibrium, and W be the random variable for the length of time an arriving customer
waits to be served in equilibrium. Clearly these two random variables are related. Again,
suppose r ≥0. Then, intuitively, the number of backorders observed at a random point
in time matches the demand that arises while customers wait to receive their goods.

9.2
An Exact Model
259
That is, P[ ¯N = n] = P[demand over the random waiting time = n]. This result can be
proven rigorously, although we will not do so. As a consequence,
E[ ¯N] = λE[W],
which also follows from Little’s law and from the following analysis.
Suppose we know that a waiting time is of length W = w. Then P[ ¯N = n|W = w] =
e−λw(λw)n/n!. Suppose h(w) is the density function for the length of a waiting time.
We do not know what functional form h(w) takes, but, as we will see, we do not need to
know. The unconditional probability for the number of units backordered at a random
point in time is
P[ ¯N = n] =
Z ∞
0 P[ ¯N = n|W = w]h(w) dw
=
Z ∞
0 (e−λw(λw)n/n!)h(w) dw.
(9.34)
The probability generating function for the random variable ¯N is
E[z ¯N] =
∞
∑
n=0
znP[ ¯N = n].
(9.35)
Recall that we can ﬁnd the mean and variance, as well as other moments, of ¯N as
follows. Compute
dE[z ¯N]
dz
=
∞
∑
n=0
nzn−1P[ ¯N = n],
(9.36)
d2E[z ¯N]
dz2
=
∞
∑
n=0
n(n−1)zn−2P[ ¯N = n]
(9.37)
and evaluate (9.36) and (9.37) when z = 1. Equation (9.36) evaluated at z = 1 provides
E[ ¯N] and (9.37) evaluated at z = 1 yields E[ ¯N( ¯N −1)] = E[ ¯N2] −E[ ¯N]. Hence the
variance of ¯N,
Var ¯N = E[ ¯N2]−E[ ¯N]2,
can be found as well using (9.36) and (9.37).
Observe that

(9.38)
Thus E(z ¯N) is equal to the Laplace transform of the waiting time random variable
with the parameter of the transform taking on the value (1−z)λ. Taking the derivative
of the right-hand side of (9.38), and evaluating at z = 1, again establishes
E[ ¯N] = λE[W].
(9.39)
By taking the second derivative of (9.38) with respect to z and evaluating at z = 1, we
are able ultimately to show that
Var ¯N = λE[W]+λ 2VarW.
(9.40)
From (9.31) we showed that
E[ ¯N] = B(Q,r) = 1
Q{G(r)−G(r +Q)}.
Furthermore, we can also compute E[ ¯N2] using the probability distribution for the
net inventory random variable, N. Hence we can establish the variance of the random
variable W as
VarW = 1
λ 2 [Var ¯N −B(Q,r)].
(9.41)
Knowing the mean and variance of W can provide valuable information pertaining to
the level of service that will be provided to customers. In practice, the backorder costs
are often adjusted in the cost model so that waiting times meet marketing objectives.
9.2.6 Continuous Approximations: The General Case
The exact analysis presented in the previous subsections is often used as the basis for
other approximations. Rather than assuming the demand process is a Poisson process,
let us assume that demand is represented by a continuous random variable with f(x)
and ¯F(x) representing the density and complementary cumulative distribution functions

9.2
An Exact Model
261
for lead time demand, respectively. Let µ and σ 2 be the mean and variance of the lead
time demand random variable.
As was the case in the development of the exact model, we will ﬁrst establish how the
probability distribution for the inventory position random variable is estimated. Then
we will use this distribution to ﬁnd the distribution of net inventory. Next we will state
the various performance measures that are used in our cost model.
Recall that the inventory position random variable is uniformly distributed over the
integers r +1,...,r +Q when the demand process is a Poisson process. In general, the
probability distribution for I is not uniform, as we will illustrate subsequently. However,
in our approximation, we will assume that I has a continuous distribution and that I
is uniformly distributed over the interval [r,r + Q]. A somewhat better approximation
results when the interval [r + 1/2,r + 1/2 + Q] is used as the range of the random
variable I. To apply this more accurate approximation, substitute r +1/2 for r in what
follows. We have chosen the range [r,r +Q] solely to simplify the notation.
Next, let us develop an approximation for our net inventory random variable, N. As
in the exact case, we will consider two situations. In the ﬁrst, let x ≤r.
Letting n(x) represent the density function for net inventory, we see that
n(x) = 1
Q
Z r+Q
r
f(y−x) dy
= 1
Q{ ¯F(r −x)−¯F(r +Q−x)}, x ≤r,
(9.42)
where, as before, we assume r ≥0.
In the second case, r < x ≤r +Q. Then
n(x) = 1
Q
Z r+Q
x
f(y−x) dy
= 1
Q{1−¯F(r +Q−x)}.
(9.43)
The probability that the system is out of stock at a random point in time, Pout, is
approximated by
Pout =
Z ∞
0 n(−x) dx = 1
Q
Z ∞
0 [ ¯F(r +x)−¯F(r +Q+x)] dx
(9.44)
and the expected number of stockouts is approximated by
E(Q,r) = λPout = λ
Q
Z ∞
0 [ ¯F(r +x)−¯F(r +Q+x)] dx.
(9.45)

262
9
Reorder Point, Lot Size Models: The Continuous Review Case
The expected number of backorders outstanding at a random point in time is given
by
B(Q,r) =
Z ∞
0 xn(−x) dx = 1
Q
Z ∞
0 x[ ¯F(r +x)−¯F(r +Q+x)] dx.
(9.46)
As before, let ¯N be the random variable measuring the number of backorders out-
standing at a random point in time and W be the random variable for customer waiting
time. Then
B(Q,r) = E[ ¯N] = λE[W]
holds exactly. An approximation between the variances of ¯N and W is as follows
Var ¯N = aE[ ¯N]+λ 2VarW,
(9.47)
where a is the variance-to-mean ratio of the demand process. In the Poisson case, a = 1.
Interestingly, the function B(Q,r) is jointly convex in Q and r. This result can be
proven by constructing the corresponding Hessian matrix and observing that its diag-
onal elements are positive and its determinant is non-negative. We leave the proof of
this result as an exercise. Unfortunately, E(Q,r) is not a convex function of Q and r in
general.
The ﬁnal performance measure is the average on-hand inventory at a random point
in time, which we denote by OH(Q,r). This expectation is
OH(Q,r) = Q
2 +r −µ +B(Q,r),
(9.48)
which is almost identical to the expression in the exact case.
Let us now examine two special cases.
9.2.7 A Continuous Approximation: Normal Distribution
An important special case occurs when the demand over a lead time is approximated
by a normal distribution. That is,
f(x) =
1
√

The density function for net inventory, n(x), is expressed in this case as

OH(Q,r) = Q

(9.58)
9.2.8 Another Continuous Approximation: Laplace Distribution
Earlier we pointed out that only the upper tail portion of the lead time demand dis-
tribution is of importance in determining Q and r, that the normal distribution has a

9.2
An Exact Model
265
relatively light tail, and that an exponential distribution has an upper tail that is heavier
than the normal distribution’s upper tail.
An alternative model for the lead time demand distribution is the Laplace distri-
bution, which has an exponential upper tail. In particular, the density function for the
Laplace distribution is
f(x) =
√
2
2σ e−
√
2| x−µ
σ |,
−∞< x < ∞.
(9.59)
Note that this is a two-parameter distribution and possesses a symmetric density about
its mean, µ, as does the normal distribution. But, unlike the normal distribution, it is an
exponential function in both directions from the mean. By symmetric we imply that
¯F(µ +kσ) = 1−¯F(µ −kσ) = 1
2e−
√
2k,
where k ≥0 represents the number of standard deviations of demand. Thus the Laplace
distribution has a standard distribution form as does the normal distribution. Because it
does have a standard distribution form, it has desirable mathematical properties which
make the model particularly attractive to use in practical applications. We will subse-
quently discuss how this distribution has been deployed to manage millions of items in
the Department of Defense.
Let us now see how the form of this distribution affects the probability distribution
for net inventory and subsequently the mathematical representation of the performance
measures of interest.
Recall that we can express the reorder point in terms of the expected lead time de-
mand, µ, and the safety stock, kσ, that is, r = µ + kσ. In what follows we will think
of k as the decision variable rather than r. Furthermore, for practical reasons and for
simplicity of presentation, let us assume that k ≥0. Thus we assume that safety stock
will not be negative. By making this assumption, we will act as if the density function
for lead time demand can be expressed as
f(x) =
√
2
2σ e−
√
2( x−µ
σ ).
(9.60)
We have removed the absolute value requirement in the exponent. This will not have
any impact on the model as long as k ≥0.
The basis for our analysis is the assumption made earlier that the inventory position
random variable is uniformly distributed over the range [r,r + Q]. As a consequence,
the density function for net inventory can be stated as

Observe that all the performance measures are trivial to compute. This is one reason
that this model is useful in practice. However, the main reason it has found use in prac-
tice is that the Laplace distribution represents forecast errors more accurately than does
the normal distribution in many applications. We will return to this model in Section
9.2.9.2 .
9.2.9 Optimization
Using the expressions that we have developed, let us ﬁnd Q∗and r∗that minimize the

addition, let us assume the ﬁxed ordering costs are large and that Q ≥µ +2σ. Suppose
Q = µ + 2σ. Furthermore, as a conservative estimate, assume that there is no safety
stock, that is, r = µ. Also, assume that the lead time demand distribution has a rela-
tively high coefﬁcient of variation, where σ
µ is the coefﬁcient of variation. The normal
distribution model is useful in practical settings when σ
µ < 1
2. When σ
µ assumes larger
values, the tails of the normal distribution may not represent the data well in practice.
Under the normality assumptions let us evaluate g(r +Q) and G(r +Q). Now

Hence, unless µ substantially exceeds 105 these quantities are negligible.

K = 200, h = 4, π = 30, and µ = 10 with σ = 3. Then
h
πλ = .00133 and, even if the
safety stock is zero, 2·G(r) = 4.5. But 2λK

of Q would be minimal if the term involving G(r) is ignored in (9.66).
Similarly, the effect of ﬁnding r using (9.67) rather than (9.68) would be very small
in this and in similar situations.

While this algorithm is simple, ﬁnding the value of rn that satisﬁes (9.72) for a given
value of Q requires a numerical search. Although this search is simple to accomplish,
it is more computationally intensive than the heuristic developed in Section 9.1.5.
9.2.9.2
Laplace Demand Model
Suppose that the probability distribution of demand over a lead time is a Laplace dis-
tribution. As mentioned earlier, one reason the Laplace distribution is used in practice
is because of the mathematical simplicity of the resulting cost function and the rela-
tive ease of ﬁnding the values of Q∗and r∗. Let us compare the results of using the
Laplace model rather than the normal model to describe lead time demand. To make
the comparison, assume that π = 0. Then our average annual variable cost function is
C(Q,r) = λK
Q +h

(9.82)
Thus, no search is required to ﬁnd Q∗and k∗. Simply solve for Q∗using (9.82) and
substitute the result into (9.80) to ﬁnd k∗and r∗= µ +k∗σ. Thus Q is only a function of
σ and not of k in this case. When σ →0,Q becomes QE. As mentioned, the simplicity
of this result has great appeal. Thus when the distribution of forecast errors can be
accurately approximated by a Laplace distribution, there is a compelling reason to use
the Laplace distribution to represent lead time demand and to establish Q∗and r∗.
We also note that the value of Q obtained using (9.82) provides an upper bound
on Q when e−

Similar results can be obtained if we assume ¯π = 0 and π > 0. We leave this as an
exercise.
9.2.9.3
Exact Poisson Model
Let us return to the exact model that we developed in Section 9.2.1–9.2.4 and discuss
how we can ﬁnd optimal values for Q and r. Recall that the demand is a discrete process,
a Poisson process. We will develop our optimization approach for the case where π = 0.
In this case, our objective function can be written as
C(Q,r) = λK
Q +h


+[ ¯π +h]B(Q,r).

Recall that

where

To ﬁnd the optimal values for Q and r we construct the ﬁrst difference functions
∆CQ(Q,r) = C(Q+1,r)−C(Q,r)
(9.85)
and
∆Cr(Q,r) = C(Q,r +1)−C(Q,r).
(9.86)
We seek the pair Q∗and r∗for which Q∗is the smallest value of Q,Q ≥1 and integer
for which
∆CQ(Q∗,r∗) ≥0
and for which r∗is the smallest integer value of r,r ≥−1, for which
∆Cr(Q∗,r∗) ≥0.

(9.88)
Then (9.87) and (9.88), along with (9.84), can be used to calculate Q∗and r∗. Begin
with Q1 = max[1,⌊QE⌋], where ⌊x⌋is the integer portion of x, and use (9.88) to ﬁnd
the smallest r for which ∆Cr(Q,r) ≥0. Then use the resulting value of r in (9.87) to
ﬁnd the smallest value of Q for ∆CQ(Q,r) ≥0. Repeat this process until convergence
occurs.

9.2

273
For example, suppose λτ = 2, K = 1, λ = 8, h = 4 and ¯π = 36. Then Q1 = 2. Using
(9.88), with Q1 = 2, r1 = 2. Then from (9.87), with r1 = 2, we ﬁnd Q2 = 3. With Q2 = 3,
r2 = 2, again. Thus Q∗= 3 and r∗= 2.
When Q is large relative to λτ, G(r+Q) ≈0. In these cases, which occur frequently,
we can ignore the terms G(r + Q) and G(r + 1+ Q) in expressions (9.87) and (9.88).
Then, in these cases, condition (9.87) reduces to ﬁnding the smallest Q for which
Q(Q+1) ≥2λ

¯π +h.
(9.90)
Again assume that λτ = 2, λ = 8, h = 4 and ¯π = 36; however, now let K = 16. Let us
ﬁnd Q∗and r∗for this case.
Clearly Q∗must satisfy
Q(Q+1) ≥2λK
h
.
(9.91)
Hence let Q1 = 8, which is the smallest integer satisfying expression (9.91). Then r1 = 1
from (9.90). When r1 = 1, G(1) = .86465. Then we ﬁnd the smallest value of Q for
which Q(Q+1) ≥81.293, or Q2 = 9. Next ﬁnd r2, where the right-hand side of (9.90)
is now .9. The result is r2 = 1, and the process terminates with Q∗= 9 and r∗= 1.
9.2.10 Additional Observations: Compound Poisson Demand Process,
Uncertain Lead Times
We have developed models in this chapter based on the assumption that customers al-
ways order one unit. But this is not always the case. For example, bookstores order
various quantities of a particular book title when they place orders on publishers. Cus-
tomer orders may arise according a Poisson process; however, the amount required per
customer order is uncertain and is assumed to be described by another random variable.
The timing of orders and order quantities are assumed to be independent of each other.
When the customer order process is a Poisson process and the order quantity is also a
random variable, then the lead time demand process is a compound Poisson demand
process. Note that if the distribution of customer order quantities has a high variance-
to-mean ratio, then the demand process can be very lumpy, which implies lead time
demand can be highly variable.

274
9
Reorder Point, Lot Size Models: The Continuous Review Case
Let us assume for simplicity that the order size random variable is integer-valued.
We will also assume that the probability that an arriving customer orders a single unit
is positive. This latter assumption will guarantee that we can have an ergodic Markov
chain describe the transitions of the inventory position random variable.
Suppose a customer arrives and asks for a quantity y of the item but only n < y units
are on the shelf. We assume the customer takes the n units and backorders the remaining
y −n units. Thus backorders will be counted in units and not in customer orders that
remain to be ﬁlled.
There are two types of policies that we will examine for managing inventories when
lead time demand is a compound Poisson process. The ﬁrst is called an (nQ,r) policy.
This type of policy operates as follows. Suppose a customer places an order at time t
for an amount that lowers the inventory position to r or lower. Let m be this value. At
that instant, a procurement order is placed that is an integer n multiple of the basic lot
size Q. Then n multiples of Q are immediately ordered so that r < m + nQ ≤r + Q.
Note that the result of placing the procurement order does not necessarily increase the
inventory position to its maximum possible value, r + Q. When Q = 1 the inventory
position will always be raised to its maximum level. This type of policy is, in general,
not optimal.
The second type of policy is normally called an (s,S) policy in the inventory litera-
ture. When a customer order arrives at time t that lowers the inventory position below s
(= r +1), an order is immediately placed that raises the inventory position to S. Thus if
after a customer order arrives the inventory position drops to m < s = r +1, a procure-
ment order is placed for an amount of S−m. This type of policy is optimal for the cost
model that we will consider. A proof of the optimality of this type of policy is presented
in the following chapter.
Let us study each of these two policy types in greater detail. Speciﬁcally, we will
show how the distribution for the random variable I, the inventory position, can be
computed in each case. Because the random variables for the arrival of customer or-
ders and the order quantities are independent, the probability distribution for the net
inventory random variable N can be computed as
P[N = n] =
S
∑
i=r+1
P[demand over the lead time = i−n]·P[I = i],n ≤s,
and
P[N = n] =
S
∑
i=n
P[demand over the lead time = i−n]·P[I = i],n > s,
where P[demand over a lead time = y] has a compound Poisson distribution. Again we
assume the lead time is a known constant τ. Also, let Z be a random variable describing

9.2
An Exact Model
275
the customer order size. Since the lead time demand distribution is compound Poisson,
the lead time demand has mean λτE(Z) and variance (λτ)2E[Z2]. Then we can easily
compute the performance measures of interest and can construct the average annual
cost functions using the concepts developed in Section 9.2.2 through 9.2.4.
9.2.10.1
Finding the Stationary Distribution of the Inventory Position Random
Variable When an (nQ,r) Policy Is Followed
Recall that when following an (nQ,r) policy, a procurement order is placed at a time
when a customer order is received that reduces the inventory position, call it m, to less
than or equal to r. Then an order is placed for nQ units, where n satisﬁes r < m+nQ ≤
r +Q. Thus after the procurement order is placed, the inventory position will be in one
of the Q possible states r +1,...,r +Q.
Let I represent the inventory position random variable. Our goal is to ﬁnd P[I = r+i],
i = 1,...,Q. Note that transitions that I experiences occur when a customer order is re-
ceived. Suppose I = r + i just prior to the order’s arrival, and I = r + j just after the
order’s receipt. The transitions can be represented by a Markov chain. Let vij represent
the transition probabilities corresponding to this chain, that is, vij represents the proba-
bility the inventory position moves from r+i to r+ j as a result of the customer’s order.
We now show how the values of vij can be computed and how they can be used to ﬁnd
P[I = r +i].
First, suppose j ≤i. Then I = r + j after a customer order is received when I =
r + i prior to its receipt if and only if z, the size of the customer demand, satisﬁes
z ∈{i−j,i−j +Q,i−j +2Q,...,i−j +nQ,...}. Let P[Z = i−j +nQ] represent the
probability that the demand placed by an arriving customer is equal to i−j +nQ. Then
vij =
∞
∑
n=0
P[Z = i−j +nQ], when j ≤i.
(9.92)
Second, suppose j > i. In this case the inventory position cannot be in state r + j
unless the customer’s demand was at least i−j +Q. Therefore
vij =
∞
∑
n=1
P[Z = i−j +nQ], when j > i.
(9.93)
Since the transitions of I are governed by a Markov chain,
P[I = r + j] =
Q
∑
i=1
P[I = r +i]vij, where j = 1,...,Q.

that is, ∑Q
i=1 vij = 1. Hence P[I = r + i] = P[I = r + j] for all i, j = 1,...,Q satisﬁes
(9.94). Since ∑Q
i=1 P[I = r +i] = 1 as well,
P[I = r +i] = 1
Q, i = 1,...,Q.
(9.96)
Remember we assumed that P[Z = 1] > 0. To see why this is necessary, consider
the following example. Suppose Q = 2 and P[Z = 2] = 1. Then it is impossible for the
inventory position to equal r + 1 assuming the inventory position begins in the state
r + 2 = r + Q. That is, P[I = r + Q] = 1 and not 1
2, which it would be if the inventory
position random variable were uniformly distributed.
9.2.10.2
Establishing the Probability Distribution of the Inventory Position
Random Variable When an (s,S) Policy Is Employed
When an (s,S) policy is followed, the inventory position random variable is usually not
uniformly distributed. Every time a procurement order is placed, the inventory position
assumes the value of S. If P[Z = 1] < 1, then the inventory position need not be in the
state S−1 in each cycle. Therefore, P[I = S] ̸= P[I = S−1]. Hence the distribution of
I is more complicated to calculate.
We will now show two ways to ﬁnd the steady state probability distribution of I. Re-
member that every time a customer demand occurs, the value of the inventory position
changes. This change process can be represented by a transition matrix for given values
of s and S. The ﬁrst method that we will present is based on constructing this transition
matrix.

9.2
An Exact Model
277
Recall that when following an (s,S) policy, an order is placed whenever a customer
would lower the inventory position below s. When this occurs, an order is placed that
immediately raises the inventory position to S units. Let Q = S−(s−1). For example,
suppose S = 7 and s = 5, so that Q = 3. In this case, the inventory position random
variable can only assume any of the values 5, 6, or 7. The transition matrix, which we
call P, for changes to the inventory position in this example is as follows:
P ≡


s
s−1
s−2
s
p(Z ≥3)
p(Z = 1)
p(Z = 2)
s−1
p(Z ≥2)
0
p(Z = 1)
,
s−2
p(Z ≥1)
0
0


where Z is the random variable associated with the customer’s order size and p(·) is
the probability of the indicated event. Observe that P depends only on Q, not on the
particular values of S and s. As long as S −(s −1) remains constant, P represents the
transition matrix.
Suppose p(Z = 1) = .2, p(Z = 2) = .4, and p(Z ≥3) = .4. Then
P ≡


s
s−1
s−2

0.4
0.2
0.4
s−1
0.8
0
0.2
s−2


.
The steady state probability distribution for I can be found by solving the equations
πP = π,
∑πi = 1,
where π = (πS,πS−1,πS−2) is the row vector of respective probabilities. We can ignore
one of the equations since there are four equations and three unknowns. Then we have
πS · p(Z = 1) = πS−1,
πS · p(Z = 2)+πS−1 · p(Z = 1) = πS−2,
πS +πS−1 +πS−2 = 1.
Thus
πS−2 = πS · p(Z = 2)+πS ·(p(Z = 1))2
and
πS +πS · p(Z = 2)+πS ·(p(Z = 2)+(p(Z = 1))2) = 1,

278
9
Reorder Point, Lot Size Models: The Continuous Review Case
so then
πS =
1
1+ p(Z = 1)+ p(Z = 2)+(p(Z = 1))2 .
For our example, πS =
1
1.64 = 0.610, πS−1 = 0.2
1.64 = 0.122, and πS−2 = 0.44
1.64 = 0.268.
As this example illustrates, computing the values of the stationary distribution is
easily accomplished owing to the structure of the transition matrix P. Intuitively,
the value of πi indicates the long-run fraction of time that the inventory position is
in state i.
An alternative way to compute this probability distribution is to construct a renewal
equation. Let us ﬁrst show how to construct this equation and then illustrate how to
compute the probabilities using it.
The renewal equation is expressed as
Mj = 1+
j
∑
i=1
p(Z = i)·Mj−i,
1 ≤j ≤Q,
(9.97)
where M0 = 0. For 0 ≤j ≤Q,
πS−j = p(I = S−j) = Mj+1 −Mj
MQ
.
(9.98)
Let us return to our example. Using (9.97) we see that
M1 = 1,
M2 = 1+ p(Z = 1)·M1,
M3 = 1+P(Z = 1)·M2 + p(Z = 2)·M1,
and therefore M1 = 1, M2 = 1.2, and M3 = 1.64. From (9.98) we again see that πS =
0.610, πS−1 = 0.122, and πS−2 = 0.268. The number M3 measures the expected number
of customer orders that are received between replenishment orders.
9.2.10.3
Constructing an Objective Function
As in Section 9.2.2, we can now compute the distribution function for the net inventory
random variable N. As we stated earlier, since the demand process is a compound Pois-
son process, the inventory position random variable and the demand during the lead
time random variable are independent. Therefore we can easily calculate

(9.100)
where Y is the random variable for lead time demand, which has a compound Poisson
distribution.
Then we can calculate the performance measures as follows. For the (nQ,r) policy
we can use (9.29), (9.30), (9.31), and (9.32). Functions g(·) and G(·) are calculated
using the compound Poisson lead time demand model rather than the Poisson model.
Also, replace λτ with λ ·E[Z]·τ which is the expected lead time demand.

The ﬁxed ordering cost term in the objective function can be computed as follows
when an (nQ,r) policy is used to control inventory. Let us assume that the ﬁxed cost K
is incurred independently of the size of the procurement order.
A procurement order is placed when a customer order arrives with probability

9.2.11 Stochastic Lead Times
Suppose we return to the situation where demands are of unit size and the demand
process is a Poisson process. But now let us assume that the lead time is no longer
a constant but is a random variable with a gamma distribution. In practice, a gamma
distribution is often used to model lead times. Let us compute the distribution function
for lead time demand in this case.
The gamma density function for the lead time is given by
f(τ) = e−τ/bτa−1
baΓ (a) ,
(9.106)
where E[τ] = ab and Varτ = ab2. Then

or Y has a negative binomial distribution with p =

E[Y] = a(1−p)
p
and VarY = a(1−p)

.
(9.108)
Suppose, in a more general way, that the demand process is a compound Poisson
process. Let X represent the number of customer orders over a lead time. Then
E[X] = λE[τ]
(9.109)
and
VarX = λE[τ]+λ 2Varτ.
(9.110)
As earlier, let Y and Z represent the random variables for lead time demand and order
size, respectively. Then
E[Y] = E[X]·E[Z]
(9.111)
and
VarY = E[X]·VarZ +VarX ·[E(Z)]2.
(9.112)
Thus
E[Y] = λ ·E[τ]·E[Z]
(9.113)
and
VarY = λ ·E[Z2]·E[τ]+(λE[Z])2Varτ.
(9.114)
In practice these expressions for E[Y] and VarY are often used to estimate parameters
of a negative binomial distribution when a discrete distribution is desired. When a con-
tinuous two-parameter distribution, such as a normal or gamma distribution, is used to
approximate the distribution of lead time demand, expressions (9.113) and (9.114) are
used to estimate the distribution’s mean and variance.
In yet more general cases, where the demand process is neither a Poisson nor a
compound Poisson process, the following expressions are used to estimate the mean
and variance of lead time demand:
E[Y] = λE[Z]·E[τ]
(9.115)
and
VarY = λ ·[VarZ +a·[E[Z]]2]·E[τ]
+[λ ·E[Z]]2 ·Varτ,
(9.116)
where a is the variance-to-mean ratio of the underlying demand process.

9.3 A Multi-Item Model
Inventory systems contain many item types. Hence it is important to develop inventory
plans that consider the interactions among the items. In some cases, the interactions
occur because of space limitations in warehouses. In others, there may be a maximum
investment in inventory that is desired. In yet other situations, there may be customer
service performance targets that are to be achieved across items rather than for individ-
ual items. In the exercises, we will ask you to consider some of these problem types.
In this section we will brieﬂy discuss one multi-item model that has been success-
fully used by the Department of Defense for over three decades. The model is used to
establish stock levels for consumable items, that is, those that are not subject to repair.
Jet engines are repairable when they fail, but transistors are not repairable. Jet engines
are expensive, while transistors are not. The model is thus used to manage the less
expensive and non-repairable items.
The model, which is used to manage hundreds of thousands of items each stocked
at a single location, is a continuous review model. It is called the Presutti–Trepp model
[271], and named after its creators who worked at the Headquarters, Air Force Logistics
Command. The goal is to set reorder quantities and reorder points for each item so as to
minimize ﬁxed ordering costs and inventory carrying costs while insuring that a supply
service goal is achieved.
Obviously, demand for items in this environment is highly uncertain. After consid-
erable experimentation and analysis conducted jointly by the Air Force and the Army,
the Laplace distribution was selected to model the demand process over a lead time.
This distribution, which we discussed in Section 9.2.9.2, is used in the Presutti–Trepp
model to ﬁnd Q and r for each item type.
Presutti and Trepp developed four possible optimization models that could be used to
determine the best reorder points and quantities. These differed in the manner in which
holding costs were charged and the type of performance constraint employed. Inventory
holding costs were charged on the basis of either the average amount of inventory held
or the average inventory position. Recall that the inventory position is calculated to
include the amount of on-order inventory. The argument for using the inventory position
to charge holding costs was based on two factors. First, the money was allocated for
purchased goods and sometimes items were paid for when the order is placed. Since
the inventory carrying cost factor used by the Department of Defense is largely based
on the cost of capital, it made sense to use the inventory position. Second, as we will
see, computing stock levels is much easier when using the average inventory position
rather than average on-hand inventory as the basis for calculating holding costs.
The performance constraints are also of two possible types. The ﬁrst limits the to-
tal number of expected backordered units per year. The second measure constrains the

9.3
A Multi-Item Model
283
total average number of outstanding backorders at a random point in time. The ﬁrst per-
formance measure is an incident-oriented measure, while the second is a time-weighted
backorder measure.
Let
λi = demand rate for item i,
Ki = ﬁxed order cost for item i,
hi = holding cost rate for item i,
σi = standard deviation of lead time demand for item i,
Qi,ri be the reorder quantity and reorder point for item i, and
zi be an essentiality factor for item i.
This essentiality factor is used to reﬂect the relative importance of stockouts. Some
items are more essential than others in the conduct of military operations, and hence it
is less desirable to have backorders for these item types.
Recall that, on the basis of the assumptions and the analysis presented in Section
9.2.9.2,
E[I] = E[inventory position] = Q
2 +r,
(9.117)
the average on-hand inventory is
OH(Q,r) = Q

We will postpone our discussion of how we ﬁnd the value of Qi.
Observe that we need to know this value of Qi and also θ to ﬁnd ki. But θ must
satisfy condition (9.125). Observe that as θ increases the left-hand side of expression
(9.125) decreases, and vice versa. Hence a simple line search method can be used to
ﬁnd a good approximation to θ relatively quickly.

Furthermore, computing ∂L2

Note that in this case we can evaluate θ directly without a search, which makes this
model desirable to use in practice.

9.3.4 Model 4
In our ﬁnal model, we charge holding costs proportional to the average inventory posi-
tion. The performance constraint again limits the total average number of essentiality-

Further, assume that π > 0 and ¯π = 0. Develop a method for ﬁnding Q∗and r∗in this
case. Review the discussion in Section 9.2.9.2 as a guide for developing your procedure.
9.6. Verify expressions (9.87) and (9.88).
9.7. Assume that n items are stocked at a particular warehouse. The warehouse manager
is concerned about the number of shipments from suppliers received each year and
wants the inventory policy to limit the expected number of such receipts. Suppose λi,
hi, τi, ¯πi, and σi represent, respectively, the demand rate for item i per year, the holding
cost incurred by holding a unit of item i for a year, τi the lead time length for item i,
the cost of carrying a backorder for a year for item i, and the standard deviation of lead
time demand for item i.
Suppose the goal is to minimize the average annual costs of carrying inventory and
time-weighted backorders while limiting the expected number of orders placed per year.
First, suppose the demand process for each item type is a Poisson process. Develop
the corresponding optimization model and an algorithm for computing the reorder point
and reorder quantities for each item.
Second, suppose the demand over a lead time is represented by a Laplace distribution
for each item. Again develop the corresponding optimization model and construct an
algorithm for ﬁnding the values for Qi and ri.
9.8. In Section 9.1 we developed an approximation model based on the assumption that
demand in excess of supply is backordered. Suppose now that demand is lost when
inventory is not available to meet demand. The goal now is to ﬁnd the values of Q
and r that minimize the average annual ﬁxed ordering costs, holding costs and lost
sales costs. Using the notation found in Section 9.1, develop a model and a solution
procedure for ﬁnding Q∗and r∗. In the model π now represents the cost of a lost sale.
As you develop the model you will have to determine the expected cycle length and
the expected number of orders placed per year. Observe that this latter quantity is no
longer λ
Q, since some demand is lost. Thus during a cycle, demand equals Q units plus
possibly some lost sales. Hence the expected demand during a cycle is equal to Q plus

9.4

the expected lost sales. You will have to make some assumption as to how to deal with
this observation as you construct your model and solution methodology. Remember, as
you develop your solution methodology that you are assuming that lost sales will be
a small fraction of total sales and that Q is sufﬁciently large so that no more than one
order is outstanding at any point in time.

t. Show how to ﬁnd the mean and variance of this distribution by constructing and us-

called a “stuttering” Poisson process. Illustrate your results assuming λ = 2, t = 1, and

9.12. Llenroc Electronics (LE) stocks circuit boards found in radar sets used by com-
mercial airlines. The inventory of these boards and many other electronic items used
by airlines are held in LE’s national warehouse. One such board has a normal purchase

290
9
Reorder Point, Lot Size Models: The Continuous Review Case
price of $100. Since this board is widely used, the airlines purchase an average of 2000
units per year from LE. LE in turn purchases these boards from a manufacturer. The
estimated ﬁxed cost to place an order by LE is $800. LE uses a holding cost rate of
.20 on an annual basis. Airlines do not carry much inventory and hence rely on their
suppliers to respond immediately to requests for parts. Since demand varies over time,
occasionally LE is out of stock for this board when an airline places an order. When
this occurs, LE places an emergency order on the manufacturer. The cost of acquiring
and shipping the unit to the airline in these emergency situations is $2000. After some
analysis, LE planners have decided to approximate the distribution of demand over a
lead time using a normal distribution with a mean of 200 units and a standard deviation
of 20 units. Determine the order quantity and reorder point that minimize the expected
average annual variable cost.
9.13. Suppose demands on a system occur according to a Poisson process. Furthermore,
suppose the procurement lead time is a known constant, τ. When demands arise and the
system is out of stock they are lost. Let us assume that a (Q,r) policy is used to manage
the system’s stock. As in the backorder case, the inventory position random variable
assumes values in the set {r + 1,...,r + Q}. Is the inventory position random variable
uniformly distributed over these values? Why? In the backorder case, it is possible to
have any non-negative integer number of outstanding orders. But in the lost sales case,
there can never be more than ⌊(Q + r)/Q⌋orders outstanding. Hence when r/Q < 1,
no more than one order will ever be outstanding. Let us suppose that this is the case.
Derive the exact cost model when there is never more than a single order outstand-
ing. Do this by constructing an expression for the expected cost per cycle and multiply-
ing the result by the expected number of cycles per year.
Show that the expected amount of time the system is out of stock per cycle is given
by
T =
Z τ
0 λ ·(τ −t)·e−λt (λt)r−1
(r −1)! dt,
where λ is the rate at which demands occur. Using this result, show that the expected
number of cycles per year is λ/(Q+λT).
Then compute the expected number of lost sales per cycle. The lost sales cost per cy-
cle is π times the expected number of lost sales per cycle. Lastly, compute the expected
number of unit years of inventory held per cycle. To do this, ﬁrst calculate the expected
number of unit years of stock held until an order is placed, and then the expected amount
held over the lead time. To make these calculations, compute the probability distribu-
tion of the on-hand stock just after the arrival of a procurement order. Note that the
on-hand stock at this time ranges from Q to Q+r.

results compare with those found in Section 9.1.5?
9.15. Suppose the demand over a lead time follows an exponential distribution. Develop
equations to ﬁnd Q∗and r∗for the model presented in Section 9.1.3.
9.16. Solve the ﬁrst example problem in Section 9.1.5 assuming lead time demand is
exponentially distributed. Let the mean of this distribution equal the mean of the normal
distribution in that example. All other parameter values remain the same.
9.17. Assume demand arrives according to a Poisson process. Further assume that lead
times are gamma distributed and that orders do not cross. That is, procurement orders
arrive in the sequence in which they are placed. Develop the cost model for this case.
9.18. Llenroc Electronics stocks parts used by airlines. One such part has a demand
rate of 12 units per year, and demands arrive according to a Poisson process. For every
order that is placed, Llenroc incurs a ﬁxed order cost of $40. The cost to carry one unit
of stock of this item for a year is $100, that is, h =$100. Demands that occur when
the system is out of stock are backordered. The cost of a shortage lasting one year is
estimated to be $5000, that is, ¯π =$5000. The lead time is one month. Find Q∗and r∗.
9.19. In Problem 9.18, suppose there is no backorder cost, but there is a constraint on
the ﬁll rate. Suppose the goal is to minimize the average annual cost of ordering and
holding inventory subject to the constraint that the ﬁll rate must be at least .99, that is,
Pout ≤.01. Find Q∗and r∗in this case.
9.20. Suppose demand over a lead time for a part is normally distributed with an ex-
pected demand of 20 units and a standard deviation of 5 units. The ﬁxed ordering cost
is $100, the annual demand rate is 500 units, the cost to hold a unit in stock for a
year is $10, and the cost per backorder incident is $100. Assuming excess demand is
backordered, ﬁnd Q∗and r∗using the algorithm presented in Section 9.1.3.
9.21. Suppose demand over a lead time is Laplace distributed. Using the data in Prob-
lem 9.20, ﬁnd Q∗and r∗. Compare the results with those obtained from Problem 9.20.
9.22. The Llenroc hospital orders a certain pharmaceutical. The supplier of this phar-
maceutical sells them to the Llenroc hospital in cartons containing 12 doses. Demand
for this pharmaceutical occurs according to a Poisson process at a rate of 4 doses per

day. Assume the clinic in which it is used operates for 250 days per year. The procure-
ment lead time from the supplier is one day. The cost of a carton of the pharmaceutical
is $480. The ﬁxed ordering cost is $5. The backorder cost ¯π is $500, and the annual
holding cost factor is such that h = 16. The hospital manages its inventories using an
(nQ,r) policy. In this case Q = 12. Find n∗and r∗so as to minimize the average annual
ﬁxed ordering, holding, and backorder costs.
9.23. In Section 9.2 we developed an exact model for the (Q,r) policy when demand
was a stationary Poisson process and when backorders are allowed. But suppose all
demand occurring when the system is out of stock is lost. Further suppose τ = 0.
In this case, modify the results obtained in Section 9.2. In particular, ﬁnd the proba-
bility distribution of the inventory position and net inventory random variables. What do
you observe? Next, develop a cost model and procedure for ﬁnding the optimal values
for Q and r. Can r > 0? Is it optimal for r to be negative?

Lot Sizing Models: The Periodic Review Case
We now turn our attention to managing inventory in a periodic review setting in which
there are ﬁxed costs incurred when placing orders. Thus we are examining the same
type of problem presented in the previous chapter, but doing so now in a periodic review
rather than a continuous review operational environment. As was the case in our study
of continuous review systems, owing to the presence of these ﬁxed ordering costs, it
may no longer be economical to place an order in each period of the planning horizon.
The ﬁxed cost requires that the order be large enough to justify incurring this cost. This
leads to a policy in which there are two critical numbers: the reorder point and the
order-up-to level. This is the (s,S) policy introduced in the preceding chapter. When
this policy is followed, an order is placed if and only if the inventory position at the
beginning of a period is less than or equal to the reorder point. If an order is placed,
then the size of the order will be such that the inventory position after placing the order
will be equal to the order-up-to level. This means that the size of the order has to be at
least the difference between the order-up-to level and the reorder point.
This problem can have several variations. The major variations are due to lead time,
length of the horizon, type of solution, and restrictions on the order quantity. The lead
time could be zero, positive but a known integer number of periods, or random. The
length of the horizon could be ﬁnite or inﬁnite. We will discuss many of these cases
in this chapter. The type of solution derived could be optimal or just approximate. The
allure of an approximate solution comes from the computational requirements associ-
ated with computing an optimal solution. We will discuss an algorithm to compute an
approximate solution for the ﬁnite-horizon case, an algorithm to compute the optimal
circumstances.

Lot Sizing Models: The Periodic Review Case
10.1 Notation
To begin, suppose we want to manage our system over a ﬁnite horizon in which there
are T periods. To simplify our discussion, let us assume that the order lead time is zero.
As a consequence, the inventory position and net inventory random variables are the
same. Let us now describe the manner in which the system operates. At the beginning
of period t, the net inventory, which we denote by xt, is observed, and a decision is
made as to whether or not to place an order. If an order is placed, then a ﬁxed cost
K and a cost proportional to the quantity purchased are incurred. By assumption, the
order is delivered instantaneously. The inventory after the order placement decision is
denoted by yt. Consequently, yt > xt if an order is placed; otherwise yt = xt. Thus, the
total ordering cost is equal to
Kδt +c(yt −xt),
where δt = 1 if yt > xt, that is, when an order is placed, but δt = 0 when no order is
placed, and c is the per-unit purchase cost.
Through the rest of the period, demand is realized. If demand is less than yt, then
there is inventory left over at the end of the period, and a holding cost is charged in
proportion to this amount at the rate of h dollars per unit. Let Dt be the random vari-
able for demand in period t. The total expected holding cost at the end of period t is
hE[max(yt −Dt,0)]. On the other hand, if the demand is more than the net inventory
yt, then the full demand cannot be satisﬁed on time, and the excess demand is assumed
to be backordered. Let each unit of backordered demand incur a penalty at the rate of
b dollars per unit. Once again, if we take the expectation over demand, the expected
backorder cost is bE[max(Dt −yt,0)] at the end of period t. Let us denote the total cost
of order placement and inventory management for one period by V 1
t (xt,yt).
Since (yt −Dt)+ = max(yt −Dt,0) and (Dt −yt)+ = max(Dt −yt,0), the expression
for one period’s expected cost is equal to
V 1
t (xt,yt) = Kδt +c(yt −xt)+hE[(yt −Dt)+]+bE[(Dt −yt)+].
But this is not the end of it. The decisions made in period t will have an impact
on period t + 1 through the inventory or backorders that exist at the end of period t.
For example, if we order too much in period t, it may take several periods before this
inventory can be used, and we will have to pay holding costs on this inventory in the
future. Similarly, if we order too little, then we may have to place a bigger order next
period which will increase the cost for that period. Consequently, we add one more term
which indicates the future impact of today’s decisions. This term is a recursive term
and is equal to the optimal cost from the next period through the end of the planning

horizon given that the net inventory at the beginning of the next period before the order
placement decision will be yt −Dt. We denote this term as E[vt+1(yt −Dt)]. We will
deﬁne vt(·) shortly. The cost from period t through the end of the horizon if an order of
size yt −xt is placed in period t is
Vt(xt,yt) = Kδt +c(yt −xt)+hE[(yt −Dt)+]
+ bE[(Dt −yt)+]+E[vt+1(yt −Dt)].
Suppose we now minimize the right-hand side over yt, our decision variable. Then we
will get the optimal cost from period t through the end of the horizon as a function of
xt. Since we denoted the optimal cost in period t +1 onwards by vt+1(·), we will denote
the optimal cost for period t onwards by vt(xt). Therefore,
vt(xt) = min
yt≥xt Kδt +c(yt −xt)+hE[(yt −Dt)+]
+ bE[(Dt −yt)+]+E[vt+1(yt −Dt)].
(10.1)
The above equation is valid for any period t = 1,2,...,T. Since the planning horizon
terminates at the end of period T, what is the meaning of vT+1? Traditionally, it is
assumed that any leftover inventory at the end of the horizon is salvaged at some value
which we denote by w per unit. The salvage value is assumed to be less than or equal
to the cost of the item c. On the other hand, if there is a backlog at the end of period
T, this backlog is fulﬁlled by purchasing the requisite quantity at the rate of c per unit.
Therefore,
vT+1(x) = −wx,
x ≥0,
= −cx,
x < 0.
Theorem 10.1. For the formulation in (10.1), there exists an optimal policy involving
two critical numbers st and St such that if xt ≤st, an order is placed to raise the inven-
tory level to St. Otherwise, if xt > st, then no order is placed.
The form of the policy as characterized in the above theorem is not surprising. It
is the same as the one discussed in the previous chapter. Because of the ﬁxed cost of
placing an order, it makes sense to wait until the inventory has been depleted sufﬁciently
and the requirement has become large enough to justify placing the order. We will prove
the above theorem in Section 10.4 for a special case in which the salvage value is equal
to the purchasing cost. That proof assumes that the procurement lead times are zero in
length. However, the proof also holds for the cases where lead times are positive and
non-crossing. In such situations, the expected cost functions are computed on the basis

296
10
Lot Sizing Models: The Periodic Review Case
of demand over a lead time in addition to the demand in a period. The proof also holds
when the discounting of future costs is included in the model.
10.2 An Approximation Algorithm
We now present an approximation algorithm for the system studied in the previous
section. An approximation algorithm provides approximate solutions to problems for
which an exact solution is difﬁcult to compute. It is different from a heuristic in the
sense that we can establish a bound analytically on the worst-case performance for
an approximation algorithm. Recall that we have stated that the optimal policy is of the
(st,St) type. Thus, our goal is to develop a procedure for computing approximate values
of st and St.
Let us alter our description of the operating environment slightly so that we can
obtain a bound on the cost relative to the optimal cost. Now we will assume that the
demand in period t is known at the beginning of period t. The demands for periods
t +1,t +2,...,T remain unknown. When the ordering decision is made for period t, all
the past information is assumed to be known, including demands and orders placed, if
any, in periods 1,2,...,t.
We assume that any units carried to the end of the horizon become worthless. That
is, w = 0. This assumption is not necessary as such, but imposing it makes the analysis
somewhat simpler. We provide steps of the algorithm in the following subsection.
In presenting the algorithm, we use Dt or dt to indicate whether demand is unknown
or known. As before, Dt is a random variable, whereas dt is the value assumed by
random variable Dt.
10.2.1 Algorithm
The algorithm has the following steps:
Step 1: Set t∗= 0 and t = 1. t∗is the last period in which an order was placed and t
is the current period. S0 = 0.
Step 2: If t = T, place an order equal to dT plus any backlog carried over from period
T −1 if the entering inventory is insufﬁcient to meet these requirements. Otherwise,
if t < T, compute the total backordering cost in periods {t∗+ 1,t∗+ 2,...,t}. The
backordering cost is computed easily since demand for periods t∗+ 1,t∗+ 2,...,t
and the order-up-to level in period t∗, St∗, are all known. The net inventory at the

10.2
An Approximation Algorithm
297
beginning of period t∗+ 1 is St∗−dt∗. We know, by assumption, that no order is
placed in period t∗+ 1. After a demand equal to dt∗+1 is realized, the net inventory
at the end of period t∗+1 is St∗−dt∗−dt∗+1. A backordering cost is incurred only if
this quantity is negative and is equal to
bmax(dt∗+dt∗+1 −St∗,0) = b(dt∗+dt∗+1 −St∗)+.
Note that we do not have to compute the expectation of the backordered quantity
because we know it completely. In a similar way, the net inventory at the end of
period t∗+ 2 is St∗−dt∗−dt∗+1 −dt∗+2 since no order was placed in period t∗+ 2
either. Once again, a backordering cost is incurred only if this quantity is negative
which is equal to
bmax(dt∗+dt∗+1 +dt∗+2 −St∗,0) = b(dt∗+dt∗+1 +dt∗+2 −St∗)+.
We can write similar expressions for each of the periods {t∗+1,t∗+2,...,t}. With
these terms combined, the total backordering cost for periods {t∗+1,t∗+2,...,t} is
b(dt∗+dt∗+1 −St∗)+ + b(dt∗+dt∗+1 +dt∗+2 −St∗)+
+···+b(dt∗+dt∗+1 +dt∗+2 +···+dt −St∗)+.
Step 3: If the cost in Step 2 is more than K, place an order in period t and set t∗=
t; otherwise, go to Step 4. If an order is placed, the order quantity is equal to the
maximum possible quantity such that the projected holding cost over future periods
in the planning horizon is less than or equal to K.
Unlike the backordering cost computation in Step 2, we now have to compute an ex-
pectation because future demands are unknown. Our goal is to ﬁnd the order quantity
Q, which has to be at least the demand in period t plus any backlog carried into pe-
riod t. To see this, suppose Q is less than dt plus the incoming backlog to period t.
Then there will be backlog at the end of period t and the holding cost will be zero.
Since the net inventory at the beginning of period t +1 is negative, the holding cost
through the rest of the planning horizon is zero. But we assumed that we picked an
order quantity such that the expected holding cost from period t through the end of
the planning horizon was equal to K > 0. Clearly, there is a contradiction and so our
assertion that Q could be less than the sum of dt and any backlog carried into period
t from period t −1 is not true.
Note that we would place an order only when on-hand inventory (if any) at the begin-
ning of period t is not sufﬁcient to satisfy the demand in period t. The quantity that
is on hand at the end of period t is the same as the net inventory at the beginning of
period t +1, xt+1. If demand in period t +1 is less than xt+1, then on-hand inventory

298
10
Lot Sizing Models: The Periodic Review Case
at the end of period t +1 is equal to xt+1 −Dt+1; otherwise, the on-hand inventory is
0. Therefore, the expected holding cost is equal to
hE max(xt+1 −Dt+1,0) = hE(xt+1 −Dt+1)+.
For period t + 2, the net inventory at the beginning of the period is xt+1 −Dt+1.
The holding cost is incurred only if the net inventory at the end of period t + 2,
xt+1 −Dt+1 −Dt+2, is positive. Thus, the expected holding cost in period t + 2 is
equal to
hE max(xt+1 −Dt+1 −Dt+2,0) = hE(xt+1 −Dt+1 −Dt+2)+.
In a similar way, we can compute the expected holding costs for periods t +3,...,T.
For example, for period T, the expected holding cost is equal to
hE max(xt+1 −Dt+1 −Dt+2 −···−DT,0) = hE(xt+1 −Dt+1 −Dt+2 −···−DT)+.
Thus, the total expected holding cost from period t through the end of the horizon
due to the order placed in period t is equal to
Ht(Q) = hE(xt+1 −Dt+1)+ +hE(xt+1 −Dt+1 −Dt+2)+
+···+hE(xt+1 −Dt+1 −Dt+2 −···−DT)+,
where xt+1 = xt +Q−dt.
Note that the above expression is equal to the marginal holding cost only due to the
order placed in period t. Does it matter when the next order after period t is placed?
The answer is no. The holding cost in a future period t′ after t is incurred only if the
on-hand inventory at the end of period t′ is positive. If that happens to be the case,
then no order could have been placed in period t′, as we have noted. Thus, incurring
holding costs in a future period is equivalent to not placing an order in that period
for these units.
The order quantity is the maximum possible value of Q such that Ht(Q) ≤K. Set
t = t +1 and go back to Step 2.
Step 4: If the cost in step 2 is less than K, do not place an order in period t. Set
t = t +1 and go to Step 2.
The expected cost of following this algorithm is at most 3 times the expected cost
of following the optimal algorithm. Note that this bound is only for costs in expecta-
tion; this does not mean that in every possible scenario the cost of this algorithm is at
most three times the optimal cost. The proof, which can be found in Levi [217], uses

10.2
An Approximation Algorithm

cost balancing among the three types of costs: the holding cost, the backorder cost,
and the ﬁxed ordering cost. Consequently, this algorithm is called the triple balancing
algorithm (TBA).
Observe that the above algorithm is implemented on a concurrent basis. At the be-
ginning of each period, we assess the past information and make a decision accordingly.
Therefore, the selected policy in a given period is a function of what has transpired until
then. The following examples illustrate Steps 2, 3, and 4 in the above algorithm.
Suppose the current period is 3 and a decision has to be made on whether or not
to place an order in this period, and, if so, what the order quantity should be. Suppose
the following information is known at this point. The last order was placed in period
1. The inventory after the delivery of the order, but before satisfying demand in period
1, was 26. The demands in periods 1 and 2 were 10 and 20, respectively. The demand
in period 3 is going to be 10. Further, demands in periods 4 and 5 can equal either 10
or 20 units with probabilities 1/3 and 2/3, respectively, and independently. In addition,
assume K = 50, h = 1, and b = 10.
The algorithm in this case works as follows. In accordance with Step 2, we ﬁrst
determine whether or not to place an order in period 3. This requires computing the
backorder costs for periods 1, 2, and 3. The net inventory at the end of period 1 is
26−10 = 16 and so the backorder cost is zero. The net inventory at the end of period 2
(and so at the beginning of period 3) is 26−10−20 = −4, leading to a backlog cost of
(10)(4) = 40. If no order is placed in period 3, then the backorder quantity at the end
of period 3 equals the backorder quantity at the end of period 2 plus demand in period
3, or 4+10 = 14 units. Thus, the backorder cost would be (10)(14) = 140. Therefore,
the total backorder cost over periods 1 through 3 is 140 + 40 = 180, which is greater
than the ﬁxed ordering cost. Consequently, an order must be placed.
We move to Step 3 to determine the order quantity (Q). The order quantity will
be at least as large as the demand in period 3 plus the backlog from period 2. Thus,
Q ≥14. Now, we set the order quantity so that the expected holding cost due to the
order quantity until the end of the horizon balances with the ﬁxed cost. The holding
cost in period 3 is equal to (1)(Q−14). The net inventory at the beginning of period 4
is x4 = Q−14. The expected holding cost in period 4 is equal to
(1)
1

max(x4 −10,0)+(1)

max(x4 −20,0).
To compute the expected holding cost for period 5, we have to know the distribution
of the sum of demands for periods 4 and 5. The net inventory at the end of period
5 will be positive only if this sum is less than the net inventory at the beginning of
period 4, x4. By assumption, the sum of demands of periods 4 and 5 is equal to 20 with
probability 1/9, 30 with probability 4/9, and 40 with probability 4/9. Therefore, the

expected holding cost for period 5 is equal to

max(x4 −40,0).
Therefore, the total holding cost from period 3 until the end of the planning horizon is

9 max(Q−14−30,0)+ 4
9 max(Q−14−40,0),
where we obtain the second equation by substituting x4 = Q−14 in the ﬁrst equation.
To ﬁnd the value of Q = Q∗such that H3(Q∗) = K, ﬁrst let us hypothesize that
Q∗≥54. Then, H3(Q) = 3Q −92. Setting it equal to K = 50, we get Q∗= 47.33,
which violates the hypothesis that the order quantity is greater than or equal to 54.
Next, hypothesize that Q∗lies between 44 and 54. Then H3(Q) = (23/9)Q−68, which
when set equal to K = 50 yields Q∗= 46.17, which satisﬁes our hypothesis that Q∗lies
between 44 and 54. Hence, the optimal order quantity is 46.17.
Let us now look at a related example. Suppose the demand is normally distributed in
periods 4 and 5 with a mean of 15 and a variance of 100. Assume the other data remain
unchanged. Let us now determine the order quantity in period 3.
Clearly, the analysis for making the ordering decision in period 3 remains the same
as in the last example. To compute the order quantity, we want to compute the expected
holding cost for period 4 and period 5; for period 3 the holding cost remains equal to
(1)(Q−14). The net inventory at the beginning of period 4, x4, is equal to Q−14. For
period 4, the expected holding cost is equal to

where we assume µ4 = 15 and σ4 = 10. As before, to compute the expected holding cost
for period 5, we have to know the distribution of the sum of demands for periods 4 and
5. Assuming independence of demand from period to period, the cumulative demand
for periods 4 and 5 is normally distributed as N(30,200). The expected holding cost for
period 5 is equal to

where the second equation is obtained by substituting x4 = Q−14. To obtain the optimal

Q. Doing so, we ﬁnd that Q∗= 44.83.
Note that the holding cost for periods 3, 4 and 5 in the example are all increasing in
Q, which implies that H3(Q) is increasing in Q. An increasing function takes any value
only once, which means that there is only one value of Q for which H3(Q) = K.
10.3 Algorithm for Computing a Stationary Policy
In this section, we will present an algorithm for computing the optimal (s,S) policy for
an inﬁnite-horizon problem. The optimal policy minimizes the long-run average cost of
managing the inventory. Note that the same criterion was used for the EOQ model in
Chapter 2 as well. All the model parameters, that is, the ﬁxed cost K, the holding cost
rate h, the backorder cost rate b, and the distribution of demand remain unchanged over
time. As a consequence, the optimal policy is stationary, too; i.e., the optimal values of
s and S remain unchanged over time.
We will begin with a short review of dynamic programming when an average cost
criterion is used to establish an optimal policy. Following this review, we will formulate
the inventory management problem and present an algorithm which can be used to
compute the optimal policy.

302
10
Lot Sizing Models: The Periodic Review Case
10.3.1 A Primer on Dynamic Programming with an Average Cost Criterion
Let us begin by establishing the meaning of the long-run average cost as an objective
function. Recall the dynamic programming formulation stated for the ﬁnite-horizon
problem (10.1). Suppose we are given a state x at the beginning of the horizon, and
suppose we divide the optimal cost v1(x1) by the length of the horizon T, and then
increase the length of the horizon. The long-run average cost va(x1) is equal to this
optimal average cost as the length of the horizon approaches inﬁnity.
10.3.2 Formulation and Background Results
Let xt and yt be the levels of net inventory at the beginning of period t before and after
the order placement decisions. If an order is placed, yt = S; otherwise, yt = xt. Since we
work in an inﬁnite-horizon setting, exactly which period we are in is inconsequential. In
a ﬁnite-horizon setting, the end-of-horizon cost structure is different from that of other
periods, and this difference inﬂuences periods that are closer to the end of the horizon
more than periods that are farther away. As a result, even if all the cost parameters are
time-independent, the optimal policy (st,St) is time-dependent. On the other hand, the
end-of-horizon effect is not present in an inﬁnite-horizon setting. Thus, when the cost
structure and the demand process are stationary, any two periods are indistinguishable.
Therefore, we will not use the subscript t in xt and yt henceforth.
Recall that an order is placed at the beginning of a period if x ≤s. We assume that the
demand takes only integer values in a period. Let pj be the probability that the demand
equals j in a period, where j lies in the set of non-negative integers, {0,1,2,... ,}. Let
V 1(y) be the one-period expected cost of holding inventory and backordering when the
net inventory after order placement is y. Therefore, V 1(y) is equal to

Note that V 1(y) depends on the choice of the values for s and S since these values
inﬂuence the value of y for a given x. If x ≤s, then y = S; otherwise, y = x.
Let va∗be the minimal average cost over all the possible choices of s and S. Let va
R
be the average cost when a policy R is followed. A policy R is characterized by a pair
of numbers sR and SR such that SR > sR. The dynamic programming formulation is

The evolution of net inventory over time can be understood in terms of a stochastic
process, which in this case is a renewal process. Whenever the net inventory hits s or
below, an order is placed to raise it to the level S. Thus, the state S is reached over and
over again. Whenever the state S is achieved, a renewal takes place.
Next, we want to obtain two intermediate quantities that will be used to compute
the average cost va
R and g(x). Let y be the net inventory after the ordering decision is
made in the current period. Then y > s. The two intermediate quantities are the expected
time until the placement of the next order and the cost incurred until this happens. The
expected time until the placement of next order is denoted by t(y) and is equal to the
expected time it will take for the net inventory to become less than or equal to s as a
consequence of demand. The next order will be placed, at the earliest, in the next period.
Further, suppose demand in the current period is equal to j and suppose y−j > s. Then
no order will be placed in the next period and the expected time from the next period
until the order placement will be equal to t(y−j). The probability of this scenario is pj.
For each value of j, different scenarios may be created as listed in the following table:
Demand

Thus, the total expected time until the next order is equal to

t(y) = 1+

∑

pjt(y−j).
(10.4)
Observe that t(y) is independent of s; it just depends on y −s. For example, when
s = 5 we can compute t(9) and when s = 8 we can compute t(12). Since 9−5 = 12−8,
t(9) = t(12). This observation will be useful in the implementation of the algorithm
later.

Lot Sizing Models: The Periodic Review Case
Before we compute the expected cost until the placement of the next order, let us dis-
cuss the computation of t(y). Given the recursive nature of the above equation, which
is called a renewal equation, calculating t(y) is straightforward. We illustrate the com-
putation in the following example.
Suppose s = 5 and demand is discretely uniformly distributed over 0 through 5. Let
us compute the expected time until the placement of the next order when y = 10.
The probability of demand in a period being equal to 0,1,2,3,4, and 5 is equal to
1/6. Since s+1 = 6, using (10.4),
t(10) = 1+ p0t(10)+ p1t(9)+ p2t(8)+ p3t(7)+ p4t(6).
(10.5)
But we do not know the values of t(6), t(7), t(8), and t(9). Suppose we had to ﬁnd the
expected time until the next order placement for y = 6, t(6). Then (10.4) would be
t(6) = 1+ p0t6 = 1+ 1
6t(6),
which is easily solvable and we get t(6) = 6/5. Next, we use (10.4) to ﬁnd t(7)
t(7) = 1+ p0t(7)+ p1t(6) = 1+ 1
6t(7)+ 1
6
6


,
which can be solved to get t(7) = 36/25 = 1.44. In a similar way, we can ﬁnd t(8) as
t(8) = 1+ 1
6t(8)+ 1
6t(7)+ 1
6t(6) = 1+ 1
6t(8)+ 11
25,
which leads to t(8) = 1.73. Finally, we ﬁnd
t(9) = 1+ 1
6t(9)+ 1
6t(8)+ 1
6t(7)+ 1
6t(6) = 1+ 1
6t(9)+ 91
125,
which leads to t(9) = 2.07. Substituting for t(6), t(7), t(8), and t(9) in (10.5), we get
t(10) = 1+ 1
6(t(10)+2.07+1.73+1.44+1.2),
and so t(10) = 2.49. To summarize, for any value of y, ﬁrst compute t(s+1). Use it to
compute t(s + 2) and use that along with t(s+ 1) to compute t(s+ 3). Continue these
recursive computations until you obtain t(y).
Let the expected cost until the next placement of orders be denoted by Cs(y). The
procedure for obtaining an expression for Cs(y) is similar to that for t(y). The cost
incurred in the current period is V 1(y). Suppose demand in the following period is for
j units where y−j > s. Then the next order will not be placed in the following period.

10.3
Algorithm for Computing a Stationary Policy
305
The expected cost from the next period until the placement of the next order is Cs(y−j),
and the probability of this scenario is pj. Once again, a table can be constructed. The
total expected cost until the next order placement is thus equal to
Cs(y) = V 1(y)+ p0Cs(y)+ p1Cs(y−1)+···+ py−s−1Cs(s+1)
= V 1(y)+
y−s−1
∑
j=0
pjCs(y−j).
(10.6)
Once again, the recursive nature of the above expression makes the computation of
Cs(y) easier. We illustrate the computation in the following example.
Suppose the holding cost is h = 1, the backorder cost is b = 10, and the purchasing
cost per unit is c = 3. When s = 4 and demand is uniformly distributed from 0 through
7, let us compute the expected cost until the next order is placed if the current inventory
level y is 8.
Note that demand takes integer values 0,1,...,7, each with probability 1/8. Using
(10.6),
Cs(8) = V 1(8)+ p0Cs(8)+ p1Cs(7)+ p2Cs(6)+ p3Cs(5);
(10.7)
but we do not know the values of Cs(7), Cs(6), and Cs(5). We will ﬁrst compute these
values recursively. Using (10.6),
Cs(5) = V 1(5)+ p0Cs(5).
HereV 1(5) = hE [(5−D)+]+bE [(D−5)+]. If demand equals 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, there will
be a positive amount of inventory remaining at the end of the period. If demand equals
6 or 7, there will be a backlog. Therefore, the expected end-of-the-period holding cost
is equal to
hE[(5−D)+] = 1
1
8(5−4)+ 1
8(5−3)+ 1
8(5−2)+ 1
8(5−1)+ 1
8(5−0)

= 1.875.
Similarly, the expected end-of-period backorder cost is equal to
bE[(D−5)+] = 10
1
8(6−5)+ 1
8(7−5)

= 3.75,
and so V 1(5) = 5.625. Therefore, Cs(5) = 5.625/(7
8) = 6.43. Next, we use (10.6) to
ﬁnd
Cs(6) = V 1(6)+ p0Cs(6)+ p1Cs(5).
As before, V 1(6) can be computed as

306

Thus
Cs(6) = 3.875+ 1
8Cs(6)+ 1
8(6.43),
which can be solved to get Cs(6) = 5.35. Next,
Cs(7) = V 1(7)+ p0Cs(7)+ p1Cs(6)+ p2Cs(5).
V 1(7) can be computed as
V 1(7) = hE[(7−D)+]+bE[(D−7)+] = 3.5,
and so
Cs(7) = 3.5+ 1
8Cs(7)+ 1
8(5.35)+ 1
8(6.43),
which can be solved to get Cs(7) = 5.68. Finally,
V 1(8) = hE[(8−D)+]+bE[(D−8)+] = 4.5,
and Cs(8) = 7.64.
Computing the values of t(y) and Cs(y) for y > s allows us to write down an expres-
sion for g(x) and va

Let us now turn our attention to stating an algorithm for ﬁnding optimal values for s
and S that is based on these observations.

10.3
Algorithm for Computing a Stationary Policy
307
10.3.3 Algorithm
Step 1: First, compute the lower and upper bounds for the optimal values for s and
S. These bounds are denoted by LB, MB, and UB and are such that s is in {LB,LB+
1,...,MB−1} and S is in {MB,MB+1,...,UB}. We compute these bounds in the
following manner:
1. MB is the smallest integer minimizing V 1(y).
2. UB is the smallest integer greater than or equal to MB such that V 1(UB + 1) ≥
V 1(MB)+K.
3. LB is the smallest integer such that V 1(LB+1) ≤V 1(MB)+K.
Choose any values s and S such that s is in {LB,LB + 1,...,MB −1} and S is in
{MB,MB+1,...,UB}.
Step 2: Compute the function t(y) for y = s+1,s+2,...,s+UB−LB using (10.4).
Step 3: Compute Cs(y) for y = s+1,s+2,...,UB using (10.6).
Step 4: Compute va
R using (10.8) and gR(x) using (10.9) and (10.10).
Step 5: Find S1 in {MB,MB+1,...,UB−1,UB} and use it to compute
gR(S1) =
min
MB≤y≤UBgR(y).
Step 6: Now, ﬁnd all y in {s+1,s+2,...,MB−1} satisfying the inequality
K +gR(S1) < gR(y).
If more than one value of y satisﬁes the above inequality, set s1 to be largest such y
and go to Step 7. Otherwise, search for all the values of y in {LB,LB+1,...,s−1}
that satisfy V 1(y) < va
R. If there is more than one such value of y, set s1 to be the
smallest of them, and go to Step 7. If we cannot ﬁnd a suitable value of y, then set
s1 = s and go to Step 7.
Step 7: If s1 = s and S1 = S, (s,S) is optimal. Otherwise, go to Step 2.
Clearly this is not as simple an algorithm to execute and understand as the ones
we developed earlier. The reason this algorithm is more complicated is due to the
non-convexity of the objective function. We will now illustrate the execution of the
algorithm. As you work through this example, observe how various expressions lack
monotonicity as well as convexity.
Suppose K = 7,h = 1,b = 10 and demand in each period is uniformly distributed
over 0,1,...,7. Let us ﬁnd the optimal policy.

Step 1: To obtain the minimum of V 1(y) = hE(y−D)+ +bE(D−y)+, we compute
the values of V 1(y) for y = 2,3,4,...,15,16, which are given in the table below.

Clearly, the minimum occurs at y = 7. Hence, MB = 7. To compute UB, we know
that UB is the smallest integer greater than or equal to MB such that V 1(UB+1) ≥
V 1(MB)+K = 10.5. Thus, UB+1 = 14 and UB = 13. Similarly, LB is the smallest
integer such that V 1(LB + 1) ≤V 1(MB) + K, or LB = 3. Thus, s lies in {3,4,5,6}
and S lies in {7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14}. We (arbitrarily) take s = 5 and S = 12. Note
that S −s = 7 and that
q

= QE = 7. Hence we use the EOQ lot size to
initialize the search.
Step 2: The values for t(y) for y = s + 1 = 6,7,...,s +UB −LB = 15 are given in
the following table:

Step 5: The minimum of gR(y) over the range MB through UB occurs at y = MB = 7.
Thus S1 = 7.
Step 6: Only one value of y lies strictly between s and MB, y = 6. The sum K +
gR(S1) = 6.5129, which is greater than gR(6) = .82. Hence, no y exists such that
K +gR(S1) < gR(y). On the other hand, there exist values of y such that V 1(y) < va
R
for y ≤s; these values are y = 4 and 5. We take s1 to be the smaller of the two, that
is, s1 = 4.
Step 7: Since the pair (s1,S1) is not equal to the pair (s,S), we proceed to the next
iteration. Set s = 4 and S = 7.
Iteration 2
We do not have to perform Steps 1 and 2 here. Step 1 is the same for every iteration.
In Step 2, we compute t(y). The value of t(y) is independent of the value of s; it just
depends on y−s. As a result, t(s + 1) = t(6) in the previous iteration is equal to t(s+
1) = t(5) in the current iteration. Therefore, the new table for t(y) is as follows:

Step 5: The minimum of gR(y) over the range MB through UB again occurs at y = 7,
and so S1 = 7.
Step 6: The values of y that are between s and S are y = 5 and y = 6. But K+gR(S1) =
7, which is greater than gR(5) and gR(6). Thus, when y = 5 or y = 6, K + gR(S1) >
gR(y). Also, there is no value of y for which V 1(y) < va
R, y ≤s. Let s1 = s = 4.
Step 7: Since s1 = s and S1 = S, we have reached optimality. The optimal solution is
s∗= 4 and S∗= 7.
10.4 Proof of Theorem 10.1
In our proof we assume that the salvage value is equal to the purchasing cost, that is,
w = c. Recall that in Section 10.1 we deﬁned the functions V 1
t (xt,yt) and vt(xt). We use
these functions to deﬁne gt(xt) and Gt(yt) as follows. Let
gt(xt) = cxt +vt(xt)
and
Gt(yt) = cyt +hE[(yt −Dt)+]+bE[(Dt −yt)+]+E[vt+1(yt −Dt)].
Since E[vt+1(yt −Dt)] = E[gt+1(yt −Dt)]−E[c(yt −Dt)],
Gt(yt) = cyt +hE[(yt −Dt)+]+bE[(Dt −yt)+]+E[gt+1(yt −Dt)]−E[c(yt −Dt)]
=
 cE(Dt)+hE[(yt −Dt)+]+bE[(Dt −yt)+]+E[gt+1(yt −Dt)],
t < T,
cE(Dt)+hE[(yt −Dt)+]+bE[(Dt −yt)+],
t = T.
Also let
G1(yt) = hE[(yt −Dt)+]+bE[(Dt −yt)+].
Let y∗
t be the minimizer of Gt(yt), that is, y∗
t = argminGt(yt) and y0
t be the mini-
mizer of G1(yt). The proof we present closely follows the approach taken by Huh and

10.4
Proof of Theorem 10.1
311
Janakiraman [177]. This type of analysis was ﬁrst considered by Veinott [355]. The
proof has four major parts.
Part 1: For any y2
t < y1
t ≤y0
t or y0
t ≤y1
t < y2
t , we have Gt(y1
t )−Gt(y2
t ) ≤K.
In this step, we show that if an inventory system in period t (characterized by y1
t ) is
operating closer to the one-period cost’s minimizer compared to, say, another inventory
system which is characterized by y2
t , that is, either y2
t < y1
t ≤y0
t or y0
t ≤y1
t ≤y2
t , then
the second system’s cost advantage is no more than K.
First, let t = T. Note that GT(yT) is convex in yt, and since GT(yT) and G1(yT) differ
by just a constant, both have the same minimizer and y0
t = y∗
T. Therefore, GT(y1
T ) ≤
GT(y2
T) if y1
T is closer to y∗
T.
Now, suppose t < T. Owing to the convexity of G1(yt), and since y1
t is closer to y0
t
compared to y2
t , G1(y1
t ) ≤G1(y2
t ). Now, demand Dt occurs. Suppose we know about
the ordering information of system 2 in period t +1 but do not know about the ordering
information of system 1 in that period. In other words, suppose we know the inventory
level of system 2 after order delivery y2
t+1 but do not know the inventory level of system
1 after order delivery, y1
t+1.
If y0
t ≤y1
t < y2
t , then x1
t+1 = y1
t −Dt < y2
t −Dt = x2
t+1 ≤y2
t+1 since both systems see
the same demand. In short, x1
t+1 < y2
t+1. On the other hand, if y2
t < y1
t ≤y0
t , then x1
t+1 ≤
y0
t . Regardless of whether y2
t < y1
t ≤y0
t or y0
t ≤y1
t < y2
t , there are only two possible
relationships between x1
t+1 and y2
t+1: x1
t+1 < y2
t+1 or y2
t+1 < x1
t+1 ≤y0
t . We analyze each
of these cases in turn.
Suppose x1
t+1 < y2
t+1. In this case, if system 1 places an order equal to y2
t+1 −x1
t+1 in
period t +1, then the inventory level of system 1 after placing the order is x1
t+1 +(y2
t+1 −
x1
t+1) = y2
t+1. Further, suppose system 1 imitates system 2’s ordering policy after period
t +1. Clearly, after period t +1, the costs are equal. In period t +1, we do not know if
system 2 places an order. But system 1 does place an order and incurs a cost equal to K.
Also, the holding and backordering costs in period t +1 are equal for both the systems
since y1
t+1 = y2
t+1. So the maximum possible difference in the costs of the two systems
over periods t + 1,t + 2,...,T is K. In monetary terms in period t, this difference is
equal to K. In other words, Gt(y1
t )−Gt(y2
t ) ≤K.
Suppose y2
t+1 < x1
t+1 ≤y0
t . In this case, suppose that system 1 does not place an
order until period t′ > t + 1, where period t′ is the ﬁrst period in which the beginning
net inventory of system 1 falls below the post-ordering net inventory of system 2. That
is, x1
t′ < y2
t′. In period t′, system 1 places an order to raise the inventory equal to y2
t′.
Thus, system 1 places an order quantity equal to y2
t′ −x1
t′ and incurs a ﬁxed ordering
cost equal to K. After period t′, system 1 mimics system 2 and thus has the same cost.
The cost differs between system 1 and 2 in periods t + 1,t + 2,...,t′. In periods t +
1,t +2,...,t′ −1, system 1 has a post-order inventory closer to y0
t compared to system
2. Thus, in each of these periods considered individually, the expected holding and
backorder costs of system 1 are lower than the expected costs for system 2. In period

312
10
Lot Sizing Models: The Periodic Review Case
t′, system 1 places an order and system 2 may or may not have placed an order. Thus,
system 1’s cost is at most K higher than system 2’s cost in period t′. Combining the
costs of systems 1 and 2, we see that in the worst case, system 1 incurs the same cost as
does system 2 in periods t + 1,t + 2,...,t′ −1 but K more in period t′. In terms of the
dollar value in period t, this is equal to K. Consequently, Gt(y1
t )−Gt(y2
t ) ≤K.
Next, we show that if the starting net inventory in period t, xt, is higher than either
y∗
t or y0
t , placing an order is more costly than not placing an order.
Part 2: If xt ≥min{y∗
t ,y0
t }, then it is optimal not to order in period t, that is, yt = xt.
Suppose an order is placed that increases the inventory to some level yt. We will
show that the cost will be higher than if no order were placed. We use the result from
Part 1. To apply this result, we have to know exactly where xt is relative to y0
t ; we know
only that it is more than min{y∗
t ,y0
t }. This creates two cases.
Suppose xt ≥y0
t . Since yt is strictly greater than xt, yt is strictly greater than y0
t as
well. In Part 1, we substitute y1
t = xt and y2
t = yt, and we get
Gt(xt)−Gt(yt) ≤K.
This means that the savings Gt(xt)−Gt(yt) due to having a higher inventory level of yt
are less than the ﬁxed cost of order placement, and placing an order is not justiﬁed.
Now suppose y∗
t < xt ≤y0
t . Once again, we use Part 1. Substitute y1
t = xt and y2
t = y∗
t .
We get
Gt(xt)−Gt(y∗
t ) ≤K.
Since y∗
t is the global minimum, Gt(y∗
t ) ≤Gt(yt). This implies that
Gt(xt)−Gt(yt) ≤Gt(xt)−Gt(y∗
t ) ≤K.
Once again, this shows that placing an order is not justiﬁed since the savings due to a
higher inventory level are not sufﬁcient to justify incurring the ordering cost.
Part 3: Gt(yt) is non-increasing in the interval (−∞,min{y∗
t ,y0
t }).
The proof for this step is similar to the proof for Part 1. Once again, we consider two
systems that have post-order inventory levels in period t equal to y1
t and y2
t , respectively,
such that y2
t ≤y1
t ≤y0
t . We want to show that Gt(y1
t ) ≤Gt(y2
t ).
In period t, since y1
t is closer to y0
t compared to y2
t , G1(y1
t ) ≤G1(y2
t ). After period
t, we want system 1 to mimic system 2’s operation. That is, if system 2 places an
order, then system 1 will also do so. If system 2 does not place an order, neither does
system 1. Suppose t′ is used to denote the ﬁrst period after period t in which system 2
places an order. Both systems see identical demands in periods {t +1,t +2,...,t′ −1}.
Consequently,

Proof of Theorem 10.1

t ≥y1
t+1 = x1
t+1 = y1
t −Dt ≥y2
t −Dt = x2
t+1 = y2

t′−1 = x1
t′−1 = y1
t′−2 −Dt′−2 ≥y2
t′−2 −Dt′−2 = x2
t′−1 = y2
t′−1.
Thus, in periods t +1,t +2,...,t′ −1, the post-order inventory in system 1 is always
closer to y0
t compared to the post-order inventory in system 2. As a result, system 1
has lower expected holding and backorder costs than does system 2 for periods t +
1,t +2,...,t′ −1. In period t′, both system 1 and system 2 place an order and incur the
ordering cost of K. Now, suppose system 2’s post-order inventory level is y2
t′. System
1 places an order such that its post order inventory y1
t′ is also equal to y2
t′. After period
t′, system 1 just imitates system 2. Since the expected costs in any period depend only
on the post-order inventory levels, systems 1 and 2 have the same cost in periods t′,t′ +
1,...,T (that is, Gt(y1
t′) = Gt(y2
t′)). Therefore,
Gt(y1
t )−Gt(y2
t ) =

≤0.
If system 2 does not place any order after period t, then system 1’s expected costs will
be lower than system 2’s expected costs in every period through the end of the horizon.
Part 4: There exist st and St for any t such that it is optimal to order if and only if
xt ≤st and the order-up-to level is St.
If an order is placed, the order-up-to level St has to be equal to y∗
t because that has
the least cost. Now, when should we place an order? From Part 2, we know that an order
is placed only if xt ≤min{y∗
t ,y0
t }. For an order to be placed, the savings due to having a
higher inventory level have to be at least K. That is, Gt(xt)−Gt(y∗
t ) ≥K. Since Gt(yt)
is non-increasing in yt, if we can ﬁnd one value of xt (let that be x1
t ) for which an order
must be placed, then for every xt < x1
t there will be sufﬁcient cost savings to justify
placing an order. Indeed, st is the largest value of xt for which an order is placed.
Suppose demand is described by a continuous random variable. Then st is the largest
point where st < St such that
Gt(st)−Gt(St) = K.
In the discrete demand random variable case, st is the largest integer satisfying Gt(st) ≥
Gt(St)+K and st < St.

Lot Sizing Models: The Periodic Review Case
10.5 A Heuristic Method for Calculating s and S
The algorithm presented in Section 10.3 is relatively complex. Hence, in many prac-
tical situations heuristics are employed to obtain solutions. We will discuss one such
heuristic, which is attributed to Wagner [358].
Suppose that demand is independent and identically distributed from period to pe-
riod. Assume the planning horizon is inﬁnite in length and that the cost structure is un-
changing over time. The costs considered in the model are ﬁxed ordering costs, denoted
by K; holding costs, denoted by h ($ per period per unit held in stock at the period’s
end); and backorder costs, denoted by b ($ per unit short at the end of a period). Posi-
tive procurement lead times are permitted, where τ represents the known, constant lead
time, measured in periods. Finally, we assume demand over a lead time is normally dis-
tributed. Let µ and σ represent the per-period expected demand and standard deviation
of demand, respectively.
The dynamics of the system are illustrated in the following ﬁgure. The lead time is
assumed to be one period in length in the example. At the beginning of a period we
check the value of the inventory position. If it is less than or equal to s, we place an
order, thereby increasing its value to S. If it exceeds s, then no order is placed. In the
ﬁgure we place orders only in periods 0, 4 and 7.
Fig. 10.1. Dynamics of the system.
The value of s must be chosen to account for demand over τ + 1 periods and not
just τ periods. For example, in period 2, in the ﬁgure, we do not place an order. The
on-hand stock at that time must be adequate to cost-effectively meet demand not only
in period 2 but also in period 3. This is the case because the next opportunity to place
an order occurs at the beginning of period 3. If an order were placed at that time, those
units of inventory would not be available for sale until the beginning of period 4. Thus,

10.5
A Heuristic Method for Calculating s and S
315
in general, we must consider demand over τ +1 periods when establishing the value of
s.
As a consequence, we can write
s = (τ +1)µ +u
√
τ +1σ,
where u is the number of standard deviations of demand over τ +1 time periods selected
to provide safety stock. Note that u
√
τ +1σ is not equal to the safety stock. For it to be
so, the inventory position would have to equal s every time an order is placed, which, in
general, is not the case. Furthermore, u√τ +1σ is an upper bound on the safety stock.
Let
Φ(u) =

The heuristic we are about to state has close ties to ideas presented in earlier chap-
ters. First, we will see that the EOQ plays a prominent role. Second, we will see that
the newsvendor model solution is also present.
Heuristic
Step 1: Compute QE =

Step 2: Find u such that G(u) =
hQE
b√τ+1σ .
Step 3: If QE > 1.5µ, let
s = (τ +1)µ +u
√
τ +1σ and
S = s+QE; otherwise, go to Step 4.
Step 4: Find v such that
Φ(v) =

b+h.
Furthermore, let
w = min(u,v).
Set s = (τ +1)µ +w

.
Observe that in Step 4, v is chosen to satisfy the newsvendor optimality condition.
In Step 2,
√
τ +1σG(u) is equal to the expected number of backorders per cycle. Note
also that if the value of QE is large so that no more than a single order is outstanding

at the end of a period and the extent of the overshoot of s is usually small just prior
to placing an order, then 1−
√τ+1σG(u)
QE
is approximately equal to the ﬁll rate. Finally,
observe that when w = v, then an order will be placed in every period experiencing
positive demand.
Let us now see how this heuristic operates. In our ﬁrst example, suppose h = 1,b =
20,K = 32,τ = 0,µ = 9 and σ 2 = 9.
Step 1: QE =
q
2·9·32
1
= 24.
Step 2: Find u such that G(u) = 2
5. Hence u = 0.
Step 3: Since QE > 1.5µ = 13.5,
s = 9+0.0 = 9
and
S = s+QE = 33.
Next, suppose µ = σ 2 = 36. All the other parameter values in the preceding example
remain unaltered. Then
Step 1: QE =
q
2·36·32
1
= 48.
Step 2: Find u such that G(u) = 2
5, or u = 0.
Step 3: Since QE = 48 < 36·1.5 = 54, go to Step 4.
Step 4: Find v such that Φ(v) = .95. Then v = 1.645.
w = min(0,1.645) = 0 so s = 36+0.0 = 36
and
S = 36+min{48,9.87} ≈46.
10.6 Exercises
10.1. In Step 3 of the approximation algorithm in Section 10.2.1, show that an order is
placed in period t only if the net inventory at the beginning of period t,xt, is less than
the demand in period t,dt.
10.2. Consider the inventory management at a retailer of an electronic product whose
product-life is estimated to be two years. For simplicity we divide this horizon into four
decision-making epochs. The lead time is zero period in length. We are now in period 2
and the demand in this period is going to be 100 units. An order was placed in period 1
after which the inventory level became 250. The demand in period 1 was 200. Demands
in periods 3 and 4 are independent and have the following distributions, respectively:

10.6
Exercises
317
D3 = 150 with probability 0.75
= 50 with probability 0.25
D4 = 100 with probability 0.75
= 50 with probability 0.25.
Further, let the holding cost h be $2 per unit per period and the backordering cost b be
$15 per unit per period. Should an order be placed if the order placement cost is $400?
If so, determine the order quantity.
10.3. In the previous problem, will your decision change if the order placement cost
were $200? Once again, determine the order quantity if necessary.
10.4. Solve Problems 10.2 and 10.3 by taking the demand to be normally distributed
where the mean and standard deviation for periods 3 and 4 are the same as in Problem
10.2. That is, the mean for period 3 is µ3 = 125, and the standard deviation for period
3 is σ3 = 43.30. The mean for period 4 is µ4 = 87.5, and the standard deviation for
period 4 is σ4 = 21.65.
10.5. Suppose a ﬁrm manages its inventory using a periodic review system. The ﬁxed
cost of placing an order is $12 and the holding cost is $1 per unit per period. Further-
more, the shortage cost per unit per period is $5. The procurement lead time is zero.
(a) The demand in each period is 2 units with certainty. Use the algorithm described in
Section 10.3 to compute the optimal policy
(b) Now suppose that the demand in each period is either one or two units with proba-
bility .2 and .8, respectively. Find the optimal values for s and S.
10.6. When determining whether or not to place an order in a periodic review manage-
ment environment, a manager checks the inventory position at the beginning of each
period. If it is a value of s or lower, an order is placed to increase its value to S. Thus,
the inventory position random variable can assume only values s + 1,s + 2,...,S fol-
lowing the point in time after an ordering decision is made.
First, show how to represent the transitions of the inventory position random variable
from period to period as a Markov chain. Assume that the demand process and costs
are stationary. Lead times can be positive. Note the structure of the transition matrix.
Second, using the ideas presented in Section 10.2 for computing the function t(y),
show how the stationary probability distribution for the inventory position random vari-
able just following the placing of an order can be calculated.
Third, using this distribution, ﬁnd the probability distribution of the net inventory
random variable at the end of a period.
Finally, ﬁnd the probability distribution of the “overshoot” of s. That is, when an
order is placed, what is the size of the order when following a given (s,S) policy?

10.7. Llenroc Electronics consumes a certain type of component at an average of 100
units per week. Usage varies from week to week. Data indicate that weekly demand is
normally distributed with a standard deviation of 30 units. Usage is independent from
week to week. Llenroc manages the component using an (s,S) policy. Each week the
company reviews its inventory position and places an order if the inventory position is
s or lower. The lead time for replenishment of stock from its supplier is three weeks.
There is a ﬁxed ordering cost of $900. The cost to carry a unit of the component is
estimated to be $2 per week. Additionally, there is a shortage cost of $50 per unit per
week due to the incremental shipping cost when units are not available when desired.
Use the method described in Section 10.5 to ﬁnd s and S.
