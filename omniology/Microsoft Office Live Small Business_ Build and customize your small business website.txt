Leader, for overseeing the creation of this book.
Thanks to Tarun Singh, Technical Editor, for accommodating several last-minute changes to

Rohan and my daughter Ruhi for promising to buy it nevertheless. And thanks to my wife 
Minal for putting up with me and managing our family in spite of me while I wrote this book.
All these folks deserve as much credit for this book as I do.

David M. Wenning is a hospital pharmacist. His interest in computer technology 
dates back to graduate school in the 1970s. He became interested in applying computer 
technology to pharmacy practice, and took elective courses in programming languages and 
business computing.  In the early 1980s, the IBM PC was released and he purchased one of 
the first ones available. The computer became an indispensable tool in both, his professional 
and personal lives.
Next came the Internet. Already a weather hobbyist, he had a yen to publish his weather 
station data to the Web. He became aware of the Microsoft Office Live Small Business 
platform and took them up on their offer for a free website under their beta testing program. 
It quite turned out to be the right choice for him. He had a good understanding of computer 
technology, but no familiarity with web design or construction. Office Live made the process 
easy and he has been using the service for nearly three years now.
David is an active participant in the OLSB Community forum and a member of the 
Community Council, which he considers as an opportunity to provide feedback and input 
into the development of the platform.

Preface
You're probably reading this either because you have a small business, a hobby, a cause you 
care about deeply, a special interest, or a charitable organization that you want the whole 
world to know about. And what better way to publicize it than by building a website for it? 
But let's face it: building and maintaining a good website is expensive. Professional web 
designers cost you a fortune. So, what's the way out?
One option is to build a website yourself. To build a website, you must know HTML—the 
language of web pages. And mind you, that's just the beginning. If you want a slick, modern 
website, you'll need at least a passing acquaintance with CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, and 
other such technologies.
Can you learn these technologies? Sure, you can. Visit your local Barnes and Noble, and 
you'll find several shelves filled with books that teach these technologies to everyone 
imaginable—novices, professionals, experts, smart people, geeks, nerds, dummies, idiots, 
teenagers, women, seniors, busy people, lazy people, you name it. You have an option of 
learning these technologies within time frames ranging from a mere five minutes to as long 
as a month. Once you select your gender, age, IQ, and the time that you want to spend on 
your endeavour, you can find the exact book for your requirements.
However, the question is: Do you really want to immerse yourself in these technologies? 
If you'd rather concentrate on doing more of whatever it is that you do for a living, than 
keeping abreast of differences in document object models of Firefox and Internet Explorer 
(whatever that means), this book is for you. It shows you how to build your own website 
without learning HTML or any other technology with those three and four-letter acronyms.
If you're wondering how you'd build a website without HTML, relax. This book is not about 
witchcraft. Your website will, of course, be built with HTML. But you won't be the one writing 
the HTML. Office Live Small Business will do it for you.

Preface

About Office Live Small Business
Office Live Small Business is Microsoft's web-presence service for small businesses. It's part 
software and part service. In fact, Microsoft calls this strategy Software + Services.
The software component consists of several useful online business programs and tools. 
Among them is a set of templating tools for building and managing websites. The tools ask 
you to fill in some information about your business, choose a few options for deciding the 
look and feel of your website, and ask you to write the text of the pitch that you wish to 
make to your visitors. Based on the information you provide, the tools generate a website 
for you.
The services component provides domain name management, web hosting, storage, and 
other infrastructural facilities required to maintain a website. Office Live Small Business 
bundles all these services in a single convenient package. Together, the two components 
help you build a website quickly and easily.
Sounds improbable? Let me give you an example that you'll easily relate to. There's a good 
chance that you use accounting software, such as QuickBooks, to balance your books. Did 
you have to take a crash course in accounting before you began using it? No. All you probably 
did was fill out a questionnaire about your business, set up a list of people who pay you 
money, and a list of people you pay money to, entered your bank account numbers, and then 
began recording daily transactions. That's it! Now your accounting software figures out the 
debits and credits. It decides whether an entry goes to your balance sheet or your income 
statement, and also generates balancing entries when you cancel a transaction. In fact, it 
performs all the accounting summersaults that are necessary to produce the pretty reports 
that help you prove your honesty to the IRS at the end of the year.
If you think about it, the goal of the entire exercise was to produce those pretty reports. You 
had the option of hiring an accountant, learning accounting yourself, or buying accounting 
software to achieve that goal. You chose the latter, in all likelihood, because it didn't cost as 
much as an accountant and didn't take up as much time as learning to balance the books 
yourself. That left you more time to do what you do best: run your business.
What QuickBooks does for your accounting, Office Live Small Business does for your website. 
Using its site-building tools, you can build an attractive website for yourself without learning 
any new technology. You can have your proverbial cake and eat it too. Moreover, the icing on 
the cake is that your site won't cost you a red cent; all you pay for is your domain name.

Preface
[ 3 ]
Is Office Live Small Business right for you?
That depends on many factors. Let me be brutally honest at the very outset. Just as your 
accounting software can't handle every imaginable accounting trick, Office Live Small 
Business doesn't have the tools to support every conceivable website feature.
If your goal is to build an informative yet great-looking website on a shoestring, if promoting 
your business means more to you than animations on your web pages, and if you want 
to build a website on which visitors can find the desired information quickly, easily, and 
intuitively; then Office Live Small Business is just what the doctor prescribed.
If, on the other hand, your goal is to build a website that's a collection of the coolest, slickest, 
flashiest, and most glamorous features from 73 of your most favourite websites; if the 
animations and special effects on your web pages mean more to you than the message they 
convey; if you'd rather use your site as a social networking vehicle rather than as a business 
promotion tool; then Office Live Small Business is not for you. Your only options are to hire a 
professional or learn all the necessary technologies yourself.
The bottom line is that you can't build the next Google, Facebook, or Amazon.com with Office 
Live Small Business. But as long as you keep your expectations in perspective, you can definitely 
build a website that will be the object of envy for your friends and competitors alike.
About this book
If it's so darn simple to build a website with Office Live Small Business, you might want to 
know why you need to buy this book. Allow me to tell you.
This book doesn't teach you how to hammer the proverbial nail; it tells you why the nail is 
required at all and where it should go.
You'll find tips, tricks, warnings, and bits of advice at every step. They'll help you avoid 
potential pitfalls and help you build a robust, consistent website that works well across 
browsers and operating systems.
The advice in this book is not random advice about web design; it's specific to designing 
websites with Office Live Small Business. It helps you optimize Office Live Small Business's 
settings to make full use of its potential.
If you're more adventurous, this book shows you how you can work around some of 
Office Live Small Business's limitations. I'm afraid you'll have to learn bits and pieces of 
those dreadful three and four-letter technologies, but I'll introduce them strictly on a 
need-to-know basis.

Preface
[ 4 ]
How to use this book
This book is not for bedside reading; it's a hands-on instruction manual. It's meant to be read 
sequentially. You'll get the most out of it if you build your website step-by-step as you read 
it from end-to-end. If this is your first attempt with building a website with Office Live Small 
Business, that would be the natural progression for you.
If you already have an Office Live Small Business website, you might be tempted to read 
random sections of this book to tweak your website. Random tweaking is a surefire recipe for 
making a complete mess of your website. Therefore, I strongly recommend against doing so. 
Of course, you don't have to throw away what you already have, but I recommend that you 
start your tweaking process with Chapter 1. As someone who's already familiar with Office 
Live Small Business, you'll be able to zip through the book at a faster clip than first-timers.
What this book covers
In Chapter 1: Getting Started, you'll learn the ABCs of Office Live Small Business and then go 
on a whirlwind tour of its site-building tools. Before calling it a day, you'll preview the starter 
site that Office Live Small Business creates for you to give you a head start on your project.
In Chapter 2: Customizing Headers and Footers, you'll start using the design tools you 
previewed in Chapter 1 to personalize your site's headers and footers. You'll customize 
its name and slogan, and in the bargain put your distinctive stamp on your website.
Chapter 3: Setting Design Options will help you decide the look and feel of your site. Which 
font should you use? What color scheme should you use? How should you lay out the site's 
navigation? It's quite easy to implement such important decisions with Office Live Small 
Business's design tools. This chapter will show you how.
Chapter 4: Setting Page Display Options will help you in deciding the structure of individual 
pages on your site. How wide will your web pages be? What kind of background will they 
have? How do you tweak design elements on your web pages? This chapter deals with 
these and other such questions.
By the time you're done with Chapter 5: Building Your Website's Skeleton, you'll have 
mastered Office Live Small Business's design tools. Have you ever seen a website that doesn't 
have a home page? I don't think so. No matter what business you are in, your website will 
need a few simple pages such as a Home page and a Contact Us page. These pages form the 
core around which you build the rest of the site. In this chapter, you'll build such a core. By 
the time you work your way through it, you'll have a four-page website—content and all.

Preface
[ 5 ]
In Chapter 6: Building the Information Page, you'll build upon the core you built in Chapter 5, 
and add pages that inform and educate the visitor about your products and services. You'll 
also learn how to work with text and images in formatting web pages.
Chapter 7: Improving the Presentation will show you how presentational aids such as tables, 
maps, slide shows, and hyperlinks help you present information in a more presentable and 
digestible format. Web pages that merely contain text and pictures are rather monotonous. 
Thankfully, several of these presentational aids are built right into Office Live Small Business's 
design tools. This chapter shows you how to leverage them.
In Chapter 8: Fine-tuning the Design, you'll continue to refine your website. You'll learn 
how to make your site friendlier to visitors by fine-tuning its navigation. You'll learn how to 
add your logo to your website in order to emphasize your brand. Finally, you'll learn how to 
tweak some of the settings you've chosen so far by customizing your website's stylesheet.
Chapter 9: Venturing Beyond the Basics will help you try your hand at writing your own 
HTML mark up to tweak your site. Office Live Small Business's built-in design tools make 
site-building point-and-click easy. But if you know HTML, the language of web pages, you 
can go where no Office Live Design Tool has gone before. Office Live Small Business is 
an extensible platform: it is possible to install off-the-shelf components to enhance your 
website. How to go about is the next skill you'll learn in this chapter. You'll install a custom 
FAQ component because the built-in FAQ page doesn't work as advertised.
In Chapter 10: Optimizing for Search Engines, you'll learn how to get your website noticed 
on Google and other search engines. You'll also get some straight talk on Search Engine 
Optimization that will help you understand how this much (ab)used term relates to the 
success of your website.
Appendix A: Signing Up: Opening a New Office Live Small Business Account covers the 
process of opening a new Office Live Small Business account.
Appendix B: Setting Up E-mail Accounts will teach you about setting up e-mail accounts.
Appendix C: Submitting Your Site to Search Engines teaches you about how to submit your 
site to search engines.
Appendix D: Backup and Restore: Recovering from Disasters elaborates on backing up and

What you need for this book
It doesn't take much to get started with Office Live Small Business. You'll find Microsoft's 
official system requirements for Office Live Small Business at http://smallbusiness.
officelive.com/Support/SystemRequirements. But here's a simplified checklist 
of what you'll need:
1.	 A computer: You'll need a computer, of course. It can be either be a PC or an 
Apple Macintosh.
2.	 If it's a PC it should be running some edition of Windows XP, Windows Vista, or 
Windows 7. Windows 2003 Server or later will be fine too.
3.	 If it's a Mac, it should be running Mac OSX.
Your computer doesn't have to be absolutely the latest and greatest model in the 
market. As long as you're happy with its speed and performance, you'll do just fine. 
The only stated hardware requirement Office Live Small Business has is a Super VGA 
(800 X 600), or higher-resolution display. Unless your monitor is an eighties-era relic, 
it should easily meet this requirement.
4.	 A browser: Office Live Small Business's tools are browser-based. So you'll need a 
browser too. If you have a PC, you have a choice of browsers: Internet Explorer 
6 or later, or Mozilla Firefox 1.5 or later. If you have a Mac, you're limited to 
using only Mozilla Firefox. And no, Safari won't do.
5.	 Although Mozilla Firefox appears in Office Live Small Business's list of 
compatible browsers, I recommend using Internet Explorer if you have a PC. 
Some web design tools, such as the Image Uploader, work much better with 
Internet Explorer than they do with Mozilla Firefox. With a Mac, you have no 
choice but to use Mozilla Firefox.
6.	 An Internet Connection: It goes without saying that you'll need an Internet 
connection. When you build your website, you'll send large volumes of data 
to Office Live Small Business's web servers. So a broadband connection, such 
as a DSL or a cable connection, is recommended. You might be able to make 
do with a dial-up connection if that's the only option you have, but there are 
no guarantees.
7.	 An Office Live Small Business Account: Finally, you'll need an Office Live Small 
Business account. If you already have one, well and good. If you don't, turn to 
Appendix A (page 201), where you'll find step-by-step instructions on signing up 
for the service.

Who this book is for
This book is for small-business owners who want to build and customize their business 
websites on Microsoft's free-to-use platform. No technical knowledge is required.
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different 
kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their 
meaning.
New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in 
menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "clicking the Next button 
moves you to the next screen".
Code words in text are shown as follows: "The <strong> and </strong> in the markup you 
just tried out is tag pair."
A block of code will be set as follows:
<strong>Welcome to my web site.</strong>
Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.
Tips and tricks appear like this.
Practical, hands-on actions and instructions are introduced with a Time for action heading, 
and use numbered steps to make the text easier to read:
Time for action – uploading a document
1. Action 1
2. Action 2
3. Action 3
When instructions need some extra explanation so that they make sense, they are 
followed with...

Getting Started
Office Live Small Business is quite a feature-rich product. Website-building tools 
make up only a small part of its overall feature set. Not only that, those tools 
are scattered over several web pages. Therefore, it's a good idea to get oriented 
so that you can find your bearings quickly once we start building your website 
in earnest.
In this chapter, you will:
Learn how to sign in and sign out of your Office Live Small Business account
Preview a four-page starter website that Office Live Small Business automatically 
creates for you
Explore the site-building tools at your disposal and learn to navigate between them
Important preliminary points
Have you already signed up for Office Live Small Business? If not, now's the time. 
You don't need to have a domain name to sign up and start creating your website. In fact, 
Office Live Small Business's sign-up process doesn't even ask you for one. It assigns a 
third-level domain alias to your website instead. After you build your site, and if you like it, 
you can register a domain name of your choice with a registrar of your choice and associate 
it with your website.
For example, when I opened an Office Live Small Business account for this book's companion 
website, I hadn't decided on a domain name. I just opened a new Office Live Small Business 
account and was assigned officeliveguide.web.officelive.com as the third-level 
domain name for my website. After I built the website, I registered the domain name 
officeliveguide.com and associated it with my website.

[ 12 ]
I recommend that you do the same. That way, you won't have to go through the hassle of 
changing registrars if you don't like your Office Live Small Business website.
Instructions for registering a new domain name for your website as well as instructions 
for pointing an existing domain name at your website are on the companion website at 
www.officeliveguide.com/domain.aspx.
Signing in
Let's start with signing in to your Office Live Small Business account.
Time for action – sign in to your Office Live 
Small Business account
1.	 Browse to www.officelive.com. The Microsoft Office Live web page appears:

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
2.	 Click the Sign in button in the top right-hand corner. You'll arrive at Office Live Small 
Business's Sign In page, as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 If you prefer a secured sign-in, as I do, click the Use enhanced security link under 
the Sign in button and Office Live Small Business will display a secured sign-in page. 
The secured page looks just like the unsecured page. But if you look carefully, the 
link under the Sign in button now reads Use standard security.
When you use the secured sign-in, your Windows Live ID and password are 
encrypted when they're sent over the wire for authentication. This prevents the 
bad guys from stealing them. That's why online stores, bank websites, or any other 
websites that require you to provide sensitive information use secured channels. 
Unlike your banking session, however, Office Live only uses the secured connection 
for signing you in. Once you're in, it reverts to the standard connection.

Getting Started
[ 14 ]
4.	 Enter your Windows Live ID and password.
5.	 If you want Office Live Small Business to remember your Windows Live ID, select the 
Remember me on this computer checkbox.
6.	 If you want Office Live Small Business to remember your password as well, select 
the Remember my password checkbox below it.
Remember me on this computer and Remember my password checkboxes 
make signing in easier in the future. But once you select them both, anybody 
who has access to your computer account can access your Office Live Small 
Business account as well. In fact, that person will have access to all of your 
Microsoft accounts; such as Windows Live, Windows Live Spaces, and Office Live 
Mail, which are secured by your Windows Live ID. Personally, I prefer to enter my 
credentials every time I visit a website.
7.	 Click the Sign in button. You'll arrive at the Microsoft Office Live Home page:

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
What just happened?
You signed in to your Office Live Small Business account and arrived at the Microsoft 
Office Live Home page. That's too long a name to repeat throughout the remainder of this 
book. So, I'll simply call it the Home page. But don't confuse it with the home page of the 
website you'll soon build. We'll call that page the Default page for reasons that I'll explain 
in Chapter 5.
The Home page is your dashboard for managing your Office Live Small Business account. It 
sports one-click access to several common tasks that you're likely to perform after signing-in 
to your account.
But the page is a bit confusing for three reasons:
It has too many links.
Many of the links are redundant. For example, there are three links on the page that 
lead to the website section.
Although the page is clearly for the benefit of first-time visitors, you see it every 
time you sign in to your Office Live Small Business account.
But with time, you’ll learn to use this page to work more efficiently. The links we’ll focus on 
for now are in the site navigation bar at the top centre of the page: Home, Workspaces, Web 
Site, E-mail, Support, and More. You'll see these links on almost every page. They represent 
Office Live Small Business's top-level functions. Each link leads you to a section of the site—a 
sub-site of sorts, which focuses on that particular function.
Although we'll spend most of our time in the website section, which deals with building and 
maintaining your website, we'll briefly touch upon other sections, such as the E-mail section 
and a few sub-sections under More, when necessary.
Signing out
Now that you know how to sign in, the next logical step is to learn how to sign out.
Time for action – sign out of your Office Live 
Small Business account
1.	 Click the Sign Out link in the top right-hand corner of the Home page. You'll find this 
link on almost all pages under your account. Office Live Small Business will inform 
you that you've signed out.
2.	 Close your browser.




Getting Started
[ 16 ]
What just happened?
You signed out of your Office Live Small Business account. You could simply have closed the 
browser window, but that's not really prudent.
Whenever you sign in, the Windows Live ID authentication system stores some information 
in browser cookies so that you don't have to sign in repeatedly. Closing the browser window 
doesn't get rid of the cookies. So, anyone who uses your computer after you, has full access 
to all your accounts attached to your Windows Live ID. When you sign out explicitly, as you 
just did, the cookies are deleted and others can't access your account accidentally.
Another benefit of logging off, and thereby deleting the cookies, is that your computer 
doesn't "remember" anything from your previous session.
Exploring the website section
The website section of your account contains the tools you'll use to build your website. Let's 
visit the section and get familiar with them.
Time for action – exploring the website section of your account
1.	 Sign in to your account.
2.	 On the Home page, click the Web Site link in the site navigation bar. The Page 
Manager page appears.

Chapter 1
[ 17 ]
Page Manager: the site-management tool
The Page Manager page you're looking at, is your website's management console. It's your 
dashboard for building and managing your website. As it's the first page you see when you 
come to the Web Site section, it's the logical place to initiate actions. You'll spend a great 
deal of time on it. Therefore, let's explore it in detail.
When the page first loads, the element that really catches your attention is the upside-down 
tab titled Get started with your own Web site. It's also the least relevant element. You'll find 
this tab on several Office Live Small Business pages. It mostly sports links to help topics. You 
can collapse it and maximize your work area by clicking the Hide Getting Started link. Go 
ahead, try it.
The starter website
"Well, that's really nice", you're probably thinking, "but where do I make a web page"? That's 
what the little toolbar in the middle of the page and the links underneath it are for. We'll get 
to them in just a few minutes, trust me! But first, let's take a quick look at a little surprise 
that Office Live Small Business has in store for you: a starter website.
Time for action –  viewing the starter website
1.	 Click the View Site link (or the icon next to it) on the blue toolbar that spans 
the middle of the page. A new window opens displaying a skeletal, but fully 
functional website:
www.allitebooks.com

Getting Started
[ 18 ]
Your starter site may look slightly different if you scrutinize it minutely. But for 
practical purposes, it will have all of the design elements that you see in the 
image above.
2.	 Click the links in the navigation bar to view different pages on the website.
3.	 Close the preview window.
What just happened?
Office Live Small Business automatically creates a skeleton site with four sample pages when 
you sign up for the service. You just previewed that site.
We'll use this site to dig deeper into Office Live Small Business's features and tools. Then 
we'll use some of the pages to practice the common tasks that you'll perform while building 
and maintaining your website.
Notice that you don't see any advertisements when you view your website. Office Live Small 
Business is an ad-supported service but it displays advertisements only on your account 
management console. Therefore, you only see them when you're building your site. Visitors 
to your finished website will not see them. This feature alone sets Microsoft Office Live 
Small Business apart from other site-building tools. A free website is exactly that—no 
strings attached.
More about Page Manager
Let's now get back to exploring the Page Manager.

Chapter 1
[ 19 ]
It's made up of the following components, as you can see in the partial screenshot above:
The table of pages at the bottom displays a row for every page on your website, 
along with a few options to manipulate it. It also displays the size of the page and 
the date when you changed it last.
The Page Manager toolbar that spans the page, just above the page list, houses links 
for performing common site-maintenance tasks. In fact, you just clicked on the View 
Site link to preview the starter website.
The Site actions tile, in the top right-hand corner, which is a pull-down menu with 
options for performing site-maintenance tasks that you don't need to perform all 
that often.
Time for action –  viewing page properties
1.	 Click the Properties link for the About Us page; it's the third link in the options 
column of the page list. The Choose page properties window opens:
2.	 Take a minute to explore the two tabs and read the information on them.




Getting Started
[ 20 ]
What just happened?
You just explored the properties of a web page. 
One of the most important properties of a page is its title. It appears in the browser's title 
bar when the page opens in a visitor's browser. When a visitor bookmarks the page or 
creates a shortcut for it on his desktop, its name is set to the title of the web page. That 
way, people can find a given page among their bookmarks or shortcuts quite easily.
Look at the following web page, for example:
The title of the page above is Home. That's not very helpful. If you change the title to 
something like The Office Live Guide—Home Page, people can find the page easily among 
their bookmarks or shortcuts.
Search engines attach a good deal of importance to a page's title. It appears as the primary 
link for that page in search results. More significantly, the title plays a big role in how search 
engines determine how to index the page. If the title is simply Home, it could end up in some 
category related to home ownership, homes for the elderly, or even funeral homes. But The 
Office Live Guide—Home Page tells the spiders that the page has something to do with 
Office Live and they can index it accordingly.
What's a spider?
A spider is a little program that a search engine uses to traverse websites and 
index their content. Each search engine has its own spider. It follows links from 
page to page as it finds them. This process of following links is called crawling.
Spiders are also called crawlers or bots. The celebrity among bots, of course, is 
Googlebot—Google's spider.

Chapter 1
[ 21 ]
Of course, the title is not the sole criterion spiders use to index your pages but it plays a 
significant enough role in their decisions for you to take the trouble of giving meaningful 
titles to your web pages.  
The information on the Search Engine Optimization tab describes meta tags which help 
search engines index your web site. We’ll explore search engines and meta tags in Chapter 
10. In the mean time, can you think of three words or phrases that best describe your small 
business? Write them down in the space below. 
1.	 __________________________________
2.	 __________________________________
3.	 __________________________________
If nothing comes to your mind right away, that’s okay. But put the task on your to-do list. 
Remember, you’re going to need them in Chapter 10.
Have a go hero – explore page properties
At this stage, you don't have to understand what each piece of information or each setting 
means. I just want you to get accustomed to the lingo of web pages and browse around, so 
that you get an overview of a web page's properties from 30,000 feet. We'll get back to the 
details as we progress with building your website.
Try clicking the Edit navigation position button. A new Navigation window opens. Read the 
instructions in the window and then close it.
When you're done exploring the page properties, click Cancel to return to the 
Page Manager.
Site Designer and Page Editor: the design tools
Some design elements of a website apply to the site as a whole; others apply only to a 
specific web page. For example, the title of your website, usually the name of your business, 
appears on every web page of your site. The text on the Home page, on the other hand, is 
specific only to that page; it's not relevant anywhere else. Office Live Small Business has two 
distinct tools to manipulate each category of settings. The tool for manipulating site-wide 
settings is called the Site Designer and the tool for manipulating settings on individual pages 
is called the Page Editor.

Getting Started
[ 22 ]
Time for action –  exploring Site Designer
1.	 Pull down the Design Site menu from the Page Manager toolbar and select the first 
option, Design site, as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 A new window opens, displaying the Microsoft Office Live Small Business Web Design 
Tool web page. It has two tabs: Site Designer and Page Editor. The Site Designer tab is 
active when the window opens, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
[ 23 ]
3.	 You've seen this page before; it's the homepage of your starter website. But notice 
that this time around, there's Microsoft Office 2007-style ribbon at the top. The 
buttons on the ribbon that have small black triangles at the bottom are pull-down 
selection menus. The buttons that don't have the triangles open property windows 
like the one you saw while viewing page properties earlier in this chapter. Let's try 
changing a setting to get an idea of how the Site Designer settings work.
4.	 Click on the Header button on the ribbon. The Customize Header window, as shown 
in the next screenshot, opens.
5.	 Change the text Welcome in the gray box in the Site Title section to Welcome to my 
site. Click OK. The window closes.
6.	 Notice that the Site Title on the web page displayed in Site Designer is now 
Welcome to my site. Click the View link just above the Site Designer tab. A dialog 
box opens to ask you whether you want to save your changes. Click OK.

Getting Started
[ 24 ]
7.	 The dialog box goes away and a new browser window opens with a preview of your 
starter website. Notice that the title of the website is now Welcome to my site:
8.	 Click on the navigation links on the left-hand side to view other pages on the 
website. You'll see that the new title appears on all the pages.
9.	 Close the preview window and return to Site Designer.
10.	Close the Site Designer window and return to Page Manager.
Have a go hero – explore Site Designer's ribbon
Go back to Site Designer and try clicking on the various buttons on its ribbon. Every time you 
click a button, a pull-down menu or a small window will appear. The menus and window will 
give you a sense of the kind of site-wide settings available in Office Live Small Business.
Don't worry if you don't understand what they are for. Right now, your goal is to get an 
overview of the tools at your disposal from 30,000 feet.
When you're done, return to the Page Manager.

Chapter 1
[ 25 ]
Time for action –  exploring Page Editor
1.	 Pull down the Design Site menu from the Page Manager toolbar and select the 
second option, Edit pages.
2.	 The Microsoft Office Live Small Business Web Design Tool opens, once again, in a 
new window. But this time, the Page Editor tab is the active tab when the window 
opens, as shown in the following screenshot:

Getting Started
[ 26 ]
3.	 The Page Editor, too, has a Microsoft Office 2007-style ribbon. The buttons and links 
on the ribbon, however, will remind you of a word processor. And for good reason, 
Page Editor is primarily a tool for editing a web page's content. The content on web 
pages resides in zones that are marked by red dotted lines around them.
4.	 Let us try doing something simple in the Page Editor. Select the first line in Zone 1, 
one that reads Put your home page content here., the same way that you'd select 
text in a word processor.
5.	 Click the B button on the ribbon, the first button in the bottom row of the ribbon's 
Font section, to make the text bold.
6.	 Click the Save button in the top left-hand corner of the window; it is just above the 
Page Editor tab.
7.	 Click the View button next to it to preview the site. Notice that the text now appears 
in bold typeface.
8.	 Click on the navigation links on the left-hand side to view other pages on the 
website. You'll see that the text on other pages hasn't changed. That's because 
making the text bold is an action specific to the Home page. It has no bearing 
on the content of the other pages.
9.	 Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.
10.	Close the Site Designer window and return to Page Manager.

Chapter 1
[ 27 ]
What just happened?
The two primary tools for designing your website with Office Live Small Business are Site 
Designer and Page Editor. You just got a bird's eye view of each. To recap:
1.	 Site Designer is the tool for setting design options that affect the entire website.
2.	 Page Editor is the tool for designing and editing content on individual web pages.
Although you're not quite ready to be a professional web designer just yet, you should 
now have a pretty good idea of what's involved in building a website using Office Live 
Small Business. 
Have a go hero – explore Page Editor's ribbon
Open up Page Editor and try the options available on its ribbon. That should give you a 
general idea of the range of page-design options available to you.
Some of them will be Greek to you. Fear not. We'll figure them out as we progress.
When you're done, return to the Page Manager.
Pop quiz 1.1
1.	 To open the Home page in Page Editor, you chose the Edit pages option on the 
Design Site pull-down menu on Page Manager's toolbar. Can you think of another 
way to do the same thing? 
Hint: Look carefully at the Page Manager's page list.
Remember: answers to Pop quizzes are in Appendix A to discourage 
you from cheating!
2.	 Open the Home page in the Page Editor in any way that you want to. Now, how 
would you bring up the About Us page in the Page Editor without going back to 
the Page Manager? 
Hint: Look for a link or a button in the top half of the Page Editor window.

[ 28 ]
The rest of the tools: the galleries
In addition to the Page Manager, the Site Designer, and the Page Editor, Office Live Small 
Business has three additional tools: Image Gallery, Document Gallery, and Template Gallery. 
You can access them by clicking on the links in the navigation pane on Page Manager's 
left-hand side, as shown in the following screenshot:
The Image Gallery contains a set of tools for editing and uploading pictures to your website. 
We'll see the precise mechanics of doing so in Chapter 7. For now, just remember that any 
picture that appears on your website will reside here.
The Document Gallery contains tools to upload downloadable documents and other special 
purpose files to your website. Again, we'll see how to do this in Chapter 7. At this point, 
it's sufficient to remember that downloadable documents such as brochures and price 
lists belong in the Document Gallery.
The Template Gallery is a tool to manage web page templates. Templates are boilerplate 
designs for web pages. Office Live Small Business provides a selection of professionally-
designed templates right out of the box. But you can also build custom templates of your 
own design. We'll see how to build them and store them in the Template gallery in Chapter 5.
The fourth link, Reports, leads you to a set of web analytics tools. Web analytics tools 
analyze the traffic to your website. They help you understand who's visiting your site 
and why. But they don't play a role in the building of the website, per se.

Chapter 1
[ 29 ]
Have a go hero – explore  the galleries
Go back to the Page Manager and click on each of the links in the left navigation pane, in 
turn, to briefly visit the sections that they lead to. Notice that the first three sections are 
empty and have the same links in their left navigation panes as the Page Manager. The 
Reports section, on the other hand, displays some content and has a different set of links.
To return to the Page Manager from the Image Gallery, for example, you can simply click 
the Web Site link at the top of the left navigation pane, but to return to Page Manager 
from Reports, you'll have to click the Web Site link in the site navigation bar.
Summary
In this chapter, I gave you a whirlwind tour of Office Live Small Business's site-building tools. 
Of course, we didn't dig deeply into any of them. But that wasn't the idea anyway. The goal 
of this chapter was to give you an overall sense of what you're getting into!
Here's a recap of the chapter:
Office Live Small Business has a set of tools for building a website. You can access 
them by signing in to your Office Live Small Business account.
When you sign up, Office Live Small Business automatically creates a four-page 
starter website for you.
Page Manager is the dashboard for managing your website.
The primary site-building tools are the Site Designer and the Page Editor.
Site Designer is used for setting site-wide design elements.
Page Editor is used for editing the content of individual web pages.
A set of three ancillary tools: Image Gallery, Document Gallery, and Template 
Gallery is useful in storing and manipulating pictures, downloadable documents, 
and page templates, respectively.
That's just about everything you'll need to know to get started. In the next chapter, we'll 
jump right in and start building your very own website!

Customizing Headers and Footers
Although a website is just a collection of web pages, the collection is not 
random. A central theme ties the web pages together with common elements 
such as branding, logo, layout, and formatting. On really large websites, 
the interweaving of these elements can be quite complex. Each of Google's 
websites, for example, has its distinct identity and yet you can identify it as a 
"Google website". It takes a small army of designers and illustrators to achieve 
such a "Similar But Distinct" identity.
But it's fairly easy to establish a unifying theme for the web pages of a small 
website, such as yours. And you can do it all by yourself; a common header and 
footer is all that's usually necessary. Naturally, it would make immense sense 
if you could design a template for headers and footers once and use it on all 
of your web pages.
A template isn't all that revolutionary a concept. You've probably built a 
template in your word processor for your letterhead or for a boilerplate, for 
example. Many widely-used applications save you the trouble of repetitive 
formatting by allowing you to make templates. Therefore, it shouldn't come 
as a great surprise to you that you can build page templates in Office Live 
Small Business as well.
A web page template in Office Live Small Business has two components: 
information and design. The information component consists of the text and 
images that are specific to your website, such as your company name, logo, 
slogan, copyright notice, and so on. The design component deals with choosing 
the right font, colors, background pictures, and other such visual elements. 
Once you configure the necessary settings, you'll have a shell, so to say, which 
will appear around the content on your web pages.

Customizing Headers and Footers
[ 32 ]
You'll start building the shell in this chapter and shape it to perfection over the course of the 
next two chapters. In this chapter, you will:
Decide what your website's title should be, and set it in your template
Decide what your website's slogan should be, and set it in your template
Decide what information should go into your website's footer, and set it
We'll deal with the design and page layout elements of the shell in the next two chapters.
Choosing a title for your website
A website's title is usually the name of the business it represents. My little company is 
called Acxede, for example. Therefore, it's logical that my site's title mimics my company's 
name. Now, there's only so much real estate available on a web page for the title. Because 
Acxede happens to be a short name, it can fit into most page layouts. But if your business 
is incorporated as Anthony Donaldson's Vacuum Cleaner Sales, Service, and Rentals 
Incorporated, this scheme of things breaks down. What do you do then? A good rule of 
thumb is to echo whatever name is on your business card. Unless your business card is the 
size of a postcard, you'd have shortened the name to something like Anthony Donaldson Inc. 
Use that as your site's title.
People often want to set their domain name as their site's title. Because my company is called 
Acxede, it would, of course, be terrific to have acxede.com as my domain name. And I do. 
Unfortunately, not everyone is that lucky. More likely than not, the domain name you want 
is already taken. Let's say that you're Sam and you own a deli called, naturally, Sam's Deli. 
Everyone just calls it "Sam's". It wouldn't be unreasonable for you to want the domain name 
sams.com. The trouble is that Sam's Publishing has already snapped it up. Okay, so how about 
samsdeli.com? Nope. Another Sam owns it. So you're forced to settle for a domain name 
that doesn't echo the name of your business; something like samsfreshfood.com, perhaps. 
Nevertheless, your website's title should still say "Sam's Deli" because that's the name of 
your business, no matter what domain name you ultimately settle on.
Now that you know more about setting a website's title than you ever wanted to, let's get 
around to doing the honors.
Time for action – setting the site title
1.	 Pull down the Design Site menu from the Page Manager toolbar and select Design 
site. A new window opens, displaying the Microsoft Office Live Small Business Web 
Design Tool web page with Site Designer as the active tab.
2.	 Click on the Header button on the ribbon. The Customize Header dialog opens.



Chapter 2
[ 33 ]
3.	 Replace the text Welcome to my site in the gray box in the Site Title section with 
your site's title. I'm going to set it as The Office Live Guide for the site that I'm 
building—this book's companion site.
4.	 Pull down the select options for the font face just above the title. You'll see a choice 
of seven fonts: Arial, Courier New, Georgia, Tahoma, Times New Roman, Trebuchet 
MS, and Verdana.
Why only seven? After all, Microsoft Word seems to have a hundred. The reason is 
that in the Web's architecture, the task of displaying a given font is delegated to your 
browser. Not every browser can display every font. If a browser can't display a font 
that you've specified, it displays one that it thinks is right. Such a substitution might 
distort your web page. But these seven fonts are, more or less, the least common 
denominator; most browsers support them. Therefore, the chances of your web 
pages being distorted are quite slim if you choose one of these seven.
So which of these seven should you choose? Follow this two step process:
If one of the fonts in the list looks like the font on your letterhead 
or the sign above your office, choose that one.
Not even close? Choose either Georgia or Verdana.
Most fonts, such as Arial or Times New Roman, came to computer displays from 
the world of print. They were designed to look good on paper. Making a font 
look good on paper is relatively easy because text is printed on paper in very 
high resolution. On a monitor, however, pixels of resolution are at a premium. 
Besides, the resolution can vary from monitor to monitor. Therefore, text will 
look better onscreen if you use fonts that are designed specifically for monitors 
rather than using fonts that are grandfathered from the print world. Georgia 
and Verdana are designed specifically for monitors and so they're the ideal 
candidates for the text on your web pages.
Set the font you've chosen. I've set it to Georgia.
5.	 Next, pull down the adjacent select options for the font size. You'll see a choice of 
seven font sizes. They're conveniently numbered from 1 to 7. Size 1 is the smallest 
and size 7 is the largest. For some inexplicable reason, people often choose a size 
that's either too big or too small. I recommend size 5 for the title. That's just about 
right for most websites built with Office Live Small Business.



Customizing Headers and Footers
[ 34 ]
One thing you've got to remember, though, is that: Thou shalt use Georgia or 
Verdana in size 5 for your site's title is not the eleventh commandment. I've 
suggested these settings because, in my experience, they are just about right for 
most websites built with Office Live Small Business. They make the header appear 
proportionate to the text on the web pages. But, they may not be right for your site 
if its title or slogan is either too long or too short. Come back and experiment with 
the font face or size of the header elements if your pages look out-of-whack after 
you finish building your website.
Set the font size you've chosen. I've set it to 5.
6.	 Although you can choose a color for the title, let's skip it for now. The choice of color 
depends on other layout options as well. Therefore, we'll address it when we set the 
design and layout options in Chapter 3.
Although you can make the title bold, italicize it, or underline it, you'd do 
well by avoiding the temptation. Depending on a combination of factors such 
as the font face, font size, and resolution of a visitor's monitor, these special 
effects can make the text quite difficult to read. The last thing you want to do 
is to inadvertently make the title of your site unreadable.
7.	 Your Customize Header dialog should now look something like this:
8.	 Keep the window open; you might as well set a slogan for your website while 
you're there.

What just happened?
You just took the first baby steps towards building your website! Agreed, all you did was 
set the site title—not exactly the kind of stuff that you'd write home about, but it's a fine 
start nevertheless.
Your site's title and slogan, which you'll set in the following section, play an important role 
in helping people find your site from search engines.
Choosing a slogan for your website
An Office Live Small Business website's slogan is really just its tagline; so I'll use the terms 
interchangeably. Successful businesses use catchy taglines to reinforce their brands. What 
comes to mind when you hear "Just do it!"? Nike. How about "Don't Leave Home Without 
It"? American Express. And "Eat Fresh"? Subway, of course.
See? People subconsciously associate taglines with brands or products. Come to think of it, 
the whole point of building your website is to reinforce your brand. Naturally, a good tagline 
will go a long way towards achieving your goal.
While a tagline sounds like a no-brainer, not every business has one. If you don't, you're 
not alone. After all, you can't spend a few million dollars to come up with one the way Nike, 
American Express, and Subway probably did. But if you happen to have one, it's a good idea 
to immortalize it on your website. And if you don't, now's the time to scratch the creative 
side of your brain and think of one.
But don't despair if you can't. You may be able to substitute a description of your business for 
the tagline with good effect. If you've shortened Anthony Donaldson's Vacuum Cleaner Sales, 
Service, and Rentals Incorporated, to Anthony Donaldson Inc., your tagline can be Vacuum 
Cleaner Sales, Service, and Rentals, or something to that effect. It may not be as potent as 
Nike's tagline, but at least it tells people what Anthony Donaldson does for a living.
Time for action – setting the site slogan
1.	 Replace the text Add your site slogan here! in the gray box in the Site Slogan section 
with your site slogan. I'm going to set it to Build your own website in a day!
2.	 Pull down the select options for the font face just above the title and set it to the 
font you've chosen. I'm setting it to Georgia again.
3.	 Next, pull down the adjacent select options for the font size and set it to 4.
Why 4? I didn't pull the number 4 out of a hat. I chose it because size 4 is a size 
smaller than size 5, the size of my site's title. If your Site Title is set to a size other 
than five, choose one size smaller than the size of your site's title.

[ 36 ]
4.	 As with the Site Title, don't select a color for your Site Slogan. We'll come back to it 
in Chapter 3, as promised. And stay away from the B, I, and U buttons as well. Your 
Customize Header dialog should now look something like this:
5.	 Click the OK button at the bottom of the Customize Header dialog. It closes and you 
arrive back at the Site Designer.
6.	 Click the View button in Site Designer.

You'll be using the View button, and the Save button next to it, quite 
often. When I want you to click the Save button, I'll simply tell you to save 
your work. If I want you to click the View button, I'll tell you to preview 
your website. Whenever I refer to these buttons, directly or indirectly, you 
now know where to find them.
7.	 A pop-up message asks you whether you want to save your changes. Click OK.
8.	 A preview of your site comes up in a new browser window. Notice that the site now 
displays the new title and slogan, as shown in the following screenshot:
9.	 After you've admired your handiwork long enough, close the preview window and 
return to Site Designer.
What just happened?
You added a slogan to go along with your site's title. Why so much fuss about simply setting 
the title and slogan? In a word: findability.
Findability? I didn't make that word up, by the way. Honest! Well-known web 
usability expert Jakob Nielsen did. A site is findable if it's easy to find; that is, 
it appears near the top of search engine results when a person searches for 
relevant terms. You can find great advice about building usable websites on 
Mr. Nielsen's website at http://www.useit.com.

Customizing Headers and Footers
[ 38 ]
Search engines attach considerable importance to the title of a web page. It tells them 
what the page is all about. But that's not the only thing they look at. They also try to 
determine whether the text on the web page has anything to do with its title. Because 
the slogan appears on every page with the title, a strong correlation between the two and 
their correlation with the text on your web pages will determine your web page's ranking 
in search results. To put it mildly, if your site's title and slogan stink, so will its ranking in the 
search results!
Therefore, don't take these settings lightly. If you don't put enough thought behind them, 
you risk relegating your web pages to obscurity.
Have a go hero – experiment with the site title and site slogan
Although I handed down the edicts on setting the font face and the font size for the Site Title 
and the Site Slogan, by no means are my recommendations cast in stone. Although following 
my recommendations will save you a good deal of time and heartache, you'll do a disservice 
to yourself if you don't experiment on your own. Depending on how long your Site Title 
or Site Slogan is, you might find a better combination of these settings if you try out a few 
variations. Here are a few suggestions:
If you've set your font to Georgia, you might want to try Verdana.
How about Georgia for the Site Title and Verdana for the Site Slogan? 
Or vice-versa?
Although I've recommended that you set the font size for your Site Slogan a size 
smaller than the font size for your Site Title, you might want to try a font size two 
sizes smaller than the size for your Site Title, especially if you've set different fonts 
for the title and the slogan.
Verdana is a wide font. If your site title or slogan has several wide letters like W 
and M, Verdana may not be the right choice. You might want to try a similar but 
narrower font, such as Arial.
Try out a few variations and settle on one that you like the best. You might want to get 
an opinion from a friend or a co-worker. And remember, you can come back and play 
with these settings any time.
Pop quiz 2.1

Setting the footer
Okay, so you now have your website's header under control. Let's jump to the other end of 
the page and deal with the footer. The usual suspects you'll find in the footers are:
Navigation links that mimic at least some of a website's main navigation
Contact information or a link to a page that displays contact information
Copyright notice
Links to privacy policy, disclaimers, and other fine print
Why are these elements commonly found in the footer? Because people 
expect to find them in the footer. A basic principle in designing websites is to 
place information where people can find it easily. It's not against the law to put 
the copyright notice in the header. But if you do, people are not likely to find it.
It's a good idea to stick to conventional wisdom and include the following elements in your 
website's footer:
A link to the Contact Us page because most people expect to find contact 
information in the footer
A copyright notice to placate your lawyers
A link to the privacy policy of your website because people often don't part with 
their e-mail addresses and are reluctant to contact you if your website doesn't 
have a privacy policy
So, your footer will look something like this:

And what about site navigation links? We won't consider them. Here's why:
As you'll see shortly, you can't build elaborate footers with Office Live Small 
Business, like the ones you see on blogs these days. Site navigation links tend 
to clutter the available real estate.
Their purpose in footers is to save people the trouble of having to scroll long web 
pages vertically simply to find a navigation link. Since you're building a small website 
with compact informational pages and not an online magazine with long articles, 
you don't really need them.
Some websites use images or scripting languages to build site navigation. People 
who turn off images or scripting support in their browsers can't see such navigation 
links. Ten years ago, during the Web's Stone Age, some designers started placing 
text navigation links in the footers to accommodate those people. Like most modern 
site-building tools, Office Live Small Business generates text-only site navigation. So, 
you don't have to repeat the links in the footer.
But that said, you may feel that the navigation links do belong in your website's footer. In the 
coming sections of this chapter, I'll show you how to add the Contact Us and Privacy Policy 
links to the footer. Once you know the process, you'll be able to add any other links you wish.
Time for action – customizing the footer
1.	 Pull down the Design Site menu from the Page Manager toolbar and select Design 
site. The Microsoft Office Live Small Business Web Design Tool web page opens 
with Site Designer as the active tab.
2.	 Click on the Footer button on the ribbon. The Customize your footer window opens:

Your window may not look this squeaky clean; you might already have a few links 
in the List of Links and some text in the Footer Text box. If so, get rid of them. To 
remove a link, select a link in the List of Links and then click the Remove button. 
To banish the footer text, simply erase it as you would in a word processor.
3.	 Let's start by adding the Contact Us link. Click the Add Link button. The Link 
Properties dialog opens:
4.	 Type Contact Us in the Link Name text box. That's what the link will say on your 
web pages.

Customizing Headers and Footers
[ 42 ]
5.	 Type /contactus.aspx in the Link Address textbox. That's the address of the Contact 
Us page. Note that the link begins with a forward slash (/). It tells Office Live Small 
Business that the web page is on your website and not on some random website 
on the Web. If you forget the forward slash, the link won't work.
Wait a minute! Where did the address come from? Recall from Chapter 1 that every 
web page has Properties. You can view them by clicking the Properties link against 
the page in Page Manager. I just looked it up before I wrote the instructions for the 
previous step. Another way to find the address is to preview the web page. The text 
in the preview window's address bar, after the last forward slash (/), is the address. 
It's contactus.aspx in this case.
6.	 Click OK. The Link Properties dialog closes and you return to the Customize your 
footer dialog. You should now see the Contact Us entry in the List of Links.
7.	 That's all there is to adding a link in the footer. Let's now add the Privacy Policy link. 
Can you handle it yourself? Sure, you can! Until it's time to enter the Link Address, 
that is. That's when you realize that you don't have a Privacy Policy page. So what 
gives? Don't worry. Simply enter /privacypolicy.aspx and create the link.
Now where did THIS address come from? I simply made it up. As you know, every 
web page has an address. The address is just a unique name you give to a web 
page so that your web server can send it down the wire when a viewer requests 
it. I just chose the first logical name that came to my mind. I could have called it 
privacy.aspx, ljashdflkjhasdf.aspx, or anything else I fancy as long as 
my website doesn't have another page with the same name.
The page doesn't have to exist when you create the link. But whenever you create 
the page (in Chapter 5, actually!), you'll have to call it privacypolicy.aspx, 
otherwise, the link won't work.
8.	 Go down to the Footer Text box and type your copyright notice. I'll type © 2009, 
Acxede Corporation for my website. You can enter whatever makes your 
lawyer happy.

Chapter 2
[ 43 ]
Where's the © key? Nowhere. But you can type symbols such as ©, ® , and 
™ with the help of the ALT key on your keyboard. To type the © symbol, hold 
down the ALT key and then type 0169 on the numeric key pad. Release the 
ALT key only after you've typed all four digits of 0169. As soon as you do, the 
© symbol appears. Note that this trick works only if use the numeric key pad; 
it won't work with the horizontal row of numeric keys above the first row of 
letters on your keyboard. The combination for the ® symbol is 0174 while the ™ 
requires 0153. Notebook computers don't have numeric keypads. If that's your 
predicament, the solution is to type the symbol in a word processor document 
or the Windows Character Map utility, cut it, and paste it in the Footer Text 
box. Visit this book's companion site at http://officeliveguide.com/
HowtoTypeCommonSymbols.aspx if you need help on using 
either alternative.
9.	 Just as you did with the Site Title and Site Slogan, choose a font face and font size. 
And remember to stay away from the B, I, and U buttons.
10.	At the very bottom of the Customize your footer dialog, there are three alignment 
options: Left, Center, and Right. Select Center.
11.	Your Customize your footer dialog should now look like this:

Customizing Headers and Footers
[ 44 ]
12.	Save your work and preview the website.
13.	Click the Contact Us link in the footer. The Contact Us page should come up 
in your browser.
If you get a Page Not Found error, it could be because of two reasons:
You probably forgot to enter the forward slash in the link address. 
Go back to the Customize your footer dialog, select the Contact 
Us link under list of links, and click the Update button. The Link 
Properties dialog opens. Add the forward slash at the beginning 
of the link address, save your work, and preview the site again.
Your web server is configured a bit differently. If that's the case, 
you'll see http:///contactus.aspx in your browser's address 
bar instead of http://yourdomainname/contactus.aspx. 
To fix the problem, go back to the Link Properties dialog and 
specify the complete web address of the page in the link address. 
My link address will look like http://officeliveguide.com/
contactus.aspx, for example.
14.	Note that the Contact Us page has the same header and footer as the Home page. 
Click the Privacy Policy link in the footer. Your browser should complain that it can't 
find the page. That's expected because you haven't created the page yet.
15.	Close the preview window and return to Site Designer.
What just happened?
You set up the contents of your website's footer. I'll admit that it's not exactly pretty; there's 
ample scope to improve its look and feel. But Office Live Small Business doesn't have the 
necessary tools built in. So, we'll resort to some trickery, but not until Chapter 8.
Have a go hero – experiment with the footers
As was the case with the Site Title and the Site Slogan, try your hand at various options for 
customizing the footer until you're happy with the way the footer looks. Make sure that the 
links and the copyright notice don't look too big or too small. You might want to try adjusting 
the font size or changing the font face.
If your browser is Internet Explorer, try viewing your site in another browser such as Firefox 
or Opera. Font faces and font sizes that look absolutely fabulous in your favorite browser 
often look ugly in others. Therefore, it's a good idea to check your work in other browsers 
or even on other operating systems before you proceed.

Chapter 2
[ 45 ]
Try changing the order of the links in the footer. I won't tell you explicitly how to go about it 
but here's a hint: open the Customize your footer dialog and look at the buttons on it.
Summary
In this chapter, you started building a template for the pages on your website. You decided 
upon a title for your site and, hopefully, a slogan as well. Then, you added a copyright 
message and a couple of links to the footer.
To recap:
Your website's title should ideally reflect your business name or brand name.
It's a good idea to come up with a slogan for your website. If you can't, then try 
substituting it with a short description of your business.
A good title and a good slogan make your site 'findable'.
Contact information and copyright notice are good candidates for the footer, so is a 
link to your privacy policy.
You should test your site in multiple browsers and on multiple computers. You'll 
be amazed to see that what looks good on one, looks absolutely horrible in 
another. While that's hardly your fault, you're still responsible for choosing the 
right combination of font faces and font sizes that always look good.
In the next chapter, you'll build upon the work you've already done and add design elements 
that will make your site prettier.

Setting Design Options
Coming up with an attractive design for a website is not easy! If you want 
the individual design elements to blend into a harmonious whole, you must 
choose colors, fonts, and images that complement each other. The trouble, 
though, is that not everyone has the artistic eye necessary to achieve that 
harmony. Thankfully, Office Live Small Business comes with pre-built color 
palettes, design layouts, styles, and design options that are preconfigured by 
professional graphic designers. You can use these design configurations to 
build a professional-looking website with just a few mouse clicks.
In this chapter, you'll:
Choose a theme for your website
Choose a layout for the design elements in page headers
Decide where the navigation links will appear on your web pages
Choose a color scheme for your website
Choose a font for the text on all your web pages
Choosing a theme for your website
A website's theme sets its tone. It gives you some sense of what the site is about, even if you 
haven't read the text. When you see pictures of people in dark suits sitting before computer 
monitors, for example, you associate the website with some kind of a professional outfit. 
But if you see pictures of butterflies, playhouses, and bright color schemes, a children's 
organization of some sort comes to mind.

Office Live Small Business sets the tone of your website by displaying a picture in the site's 
header. The picture and its physical setting constitute a Theme. The Site Designer offers 
a large selection of themes that are good for projecting just about any kind of organization. 
Offer plumbing services? You're covered. Own a garage? No problem! No matter what 
kind of business you own, you're likely to find a theme that will set the right ambience 
for your website.
Now that you understand what a theme is, let's go and choose one for your website.
Time for action – choosing a theme
1.	 Sign in to your Office Live Small Business account, if you haven't done so already, 
and go to Page Manager.
2.	 Pull down the Design Site menu from the Page Manager toolbar and select Design 
site. Site Designer opens.
3.	 Click on the Theme button on the ribbon. A pull-down menu displays the choice of 
themes for several categories of businesses.
4.	 Click on the category that's closest to your business. A selection of pictures appears 
to the right. I've selected Education because my website is about my book, and 
Education is the closest category I can find in the list. A selection of pictures 
appears to the right, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
[ 49 ]
If you have little or no design experience, you'll find Office Live Small 
Business's themes a Godsend. But if you are Photoshop-savvy, you might find 
the built-in themes quite pedestrian. If that's the case, don't fret! You can build 
a theme of your own. If you look carefully, Custom Theme Image is the first 
option in the Themes menu. But I am not going to discuss that option until 
Chapter 8. For now, just follow along by selecting a theme that best suits your 
website. Doing so will help you get a clear perspective of how themes work, 
which in turn, will enable you to obtain the right kind of image if you choose to 
go with a custom theme.
Click on the picture that catches your fancy. The Themes menu closes and the 
picture that you selected appears in the header of the page in the Site Designer, 
as shown:
Well, that's nice! But where did the Site Title and Site Slogan go? Don't worry, they 
haven't vanished. What happened is that my theme has a light background. Because 
the title and slogan are white, you can't see them against the light background. 
Depending on which theme you choose, this may or may not happen to your 
headers. But if it does, rest assured, we'll fix it at the end of this chapter.
5.	 Save your work and preview the website.
6.	 Close the preview window and return to Site Designer.

What just happened?
You selected a theme for your site. A theme, in Office Live Small Business parlance, is just 
a picture that is displayed in the header area of your site. There's a wide variety of pictures 
and themes to choose from. And if you don't like any of them, you can upload one of your 
own. For now though, you have just selected one of the available ones.
Have a go hero – experiment with different themes
I recommend trying out all the available pictures in all the available categories before 
settling on a theme. Why? Because you might find the most suitable theme in a completely 
unrelated category. The Automotive category, for example, has a picture of wrenches. While 
it's quite appropriate for that category, it's also ideal for your website if you're a plumber. So 
go ahead, try every image available.
Choosing a style for your website
When you chose a theme, Office Live Small Business displayed the image of your choice 
in the page header. What if you don't like its location and want to move it around? You 
can do so by selecting a style. For example, here's my "bookshelves" theme laid out in a 
different style:

Chapter 3
[ 51 ]
For every theme, Office Live Small Business gives you several styles to choose from. You 
don't have the option of positioning each element in the header individually, but the 
available styles move the image around, change its size, add special effects to it, and change 
the position of other header elements. There's a good chance that you'll like one of the 
available styles.
But what if you don't? In that case, you can always design a custom header. Designing 
custom headers is somewhat beyond the scope of this book. It needs a deeper knowledge 
of HTML, CSS, XML, and XSLT. But if you want to have a go at it anyway, you'll find the 
necessary instructions on this book's companion site at http://www.officeliveguide.
com/customheader.aspx.
You don't have to go about it right now. It's a good idea to follow the rest of this book and 
build your website first. Once you're happy with the site in general, you can add bells and 
whistles such as a custom header. As a matter of fact, I'll give you several more suggestions 
as you work your way through this book.
Time for action – choosing a style
1.	 Click on the Style button on Site Designer's ribbon. A pull-down menu displays the 
choice of styles.
2.	 Select the layout that you like. The Themes menu closes and you return to Site 
Designer. The page visible in Site Designer has the style that you just chose.
3.	 Save your work and preview the website.
4.	 Close the preview window and return to Site Designer.
What just happened?
You selected a style to go with your theme. As you can see, a style is just a layout for the 
header of your website. Each style positions the three header elements—Theme image, 
Site Title, and Site Slogan—differently. And some styles also alter the background of the 
header. The style that I just chose has a dark background. So, my Site Title and Site Slogan 
are visible again.
Have a go hero –  experiment with different styles
As you did with the theme, it's a good idea to try out each of the available styles too. Who 
knows? You might find one that will bowl you over completely. Go ahead, give it a shot!

Choosing a navigation layout
The navigation layout determines where your website's navigation links appear. Office Live 
Small Business supports two kinds of navigation links: primary links and secondary links. 
Primary links lead to top-level pages or the main pages of your website's sections. Secondary 
links are subordinate to primary links. They lead to pages within a section.
The starter website you're working with is rather simple. You can think of it as having four 
sections: Home, About Us, Contact Us, and Site Map. Each section has only one page—its 
main page. Therefore, all the navigation links that you see on the left-hand side of your web 
pages are primary links, as shown:
Now, let's say that you just can't stop talking about your little outfit—you like to boast about 
your philosophy and your people. Naturally, you won't be able to fit everything that you've 
got to say on the About Us page that's already there. So, you decide to have a couple of 
subordinate pages: Our Philosophy and Our People. If you now bring up the About Us 
page in your browser, your site navigation will now look like this:

Chapter 3
[ 53 ]
The new links, Our Philosophy and Our People, are secondary links.
Office Live Small Business offers three options for laying out the primary and secondary links:
Left, which lays out both the primary and secondary links on the left-hand side of 
the page, just as in the previous screenshot.
Top & Left, which lays out the primary links at the top of the page and secondary 
links on the left, like this:

Setting Design Options
[ 54 ]
Top, which lays out both the primary and secondary navigation links at the top of 
the page, like this:
So, let's choose the navigation layout for your site.
Time for action – choosing a style 
1.	 Click on the Navigation button on the Site Designer's ribbon. A pull-down menu 
displays the three possible navigation layouts.
2.	 Select Top. The Navigation menu closes and you return to Site Designer.
3.	 Save your work and preview the site.
4.	 Close the preview window and return to Site Designer.
What just happened?
You chose to display all the navigation links on your website at the top. When you preview 
the site, you can see that the four primary navigation links have moved to the top. You can't 
see any secondary navigation links yet, because your fledging website has only four web 
pages, all of which represent primary navigation links. But when you add subordinate 
pages later on, you know where they'll appear in your website's navigation scheme.
Why did I decide, on your behalf, to display the navigation links at the top? Why not on the 
left? Or a combination of top and left? The reason will become clear when we set the site 
width in the next chapter. For now, just set it to Top.

Choosing a color scheme for your website
If you've ever visited the paint store with the intention of choosing a color for a single room 
in your house, you'll know how impossibly hard the task is! The task of choosing colors for a 
website is even harder by several orders of magnitude because you have to choose an entire 
color palette. Office Live Small Business spares you the pain and suffering by providing you 
with several built-in color schemes.
Time for action – choosing a color scheme
1.	 Click on the Color button on Site Designer's ribbon. A pull-down menu displays the 
available built-in color schemes.
At the bottom, you'll also see an option for creating a custom color scheme. 
But as usual, we'll leave that option for a later time.
2.	 Select the scheme that you like. The Color menu closes and you return to Site 
Designer. The page visible in Site Designer now displays the color scheme that 
you just chose.
3.	 Save your work and preview the website.
4.	 Close the preview window and return to Site Designer.
What just happened?
You selected a color scheme for your site. As a side-note, many people end up choosing 
counter-intuitive color schemes. Don't make that mistake with your site. Own a landscaping 
business? Choose a green-based color scheme. Run a daycare? A bright color scheme is more 
appropriate than a pastel one. While these choices sound like no-brainers, you'll be surprised 
how many people don't think of them.
Have a go hero –  experiment with different color schemes
By now, you know the drill. Try out each of the available color schemes. Choosing color 
schemes is hard, even when experts build them for you. You'll often find that you like a color 
scheme except for one tiny application of it, to the navigation links, for example, which looks 
simply too gaudy. So, you might have to apply and reapply color schemes until you can make 
up your mind.
Remember, you can always customize any of the color schemes later. So, if you can't settle on 
the perfect scheme, choose one that comes closest to the scheme of your dreams. I'll show 
you how to customize it in Chapter 8.

Choosing a site font for your website
Site Font is the font that Office Live Small Business applies to all text on all of your web 
pages for which you don't explicitly specify a font. It's just like selecting a font for your word 
processing document. But keep in mind that elements such as the Site Title and the Site 
Slogan, which have their own font settings, as you saw in Chapter 2, are not affected by 
the site font; they retain their own font settings.
Pop quiz 3.1
1.	 Georgia and Verdana are the preferred fonts for websites because:
A.	 They are narrow fonts. Therefore, you can squeeze in more text on a web page.
B.	 They were designed especially for monitors. Therefore, they're easier to read 
on screen.
C.	 They are the only two standards-compliant fonts.
Time for action – choosing the site font 
1.	 Click on the Font button on the Site Designer's ribbon. A pull-down menu displays 
seven font choices. These are the same seven fonts that you encountered in 
Chapter 2.
2.	 Select Georgia or Verdana. The Font menu closes and you return to Site Designer.
3.	 Save your work and preview the site. Notice that all pages now display the text in 
your chosen font.
4.	 Close the preview window and return to Site Designer.
What just happened?
You chose a font for all of the text on your website. When you add text to your web pages or 
edit what's already there, Office Live Small Business will display it in the site font.
Now, you might think that displaying all text on your website in a single font is a bit 
ham-handed. And you might be right. It's a good idea to choose a different font for 
headings and subheadings. So, what gives?
The site Font is really just the base font or the default font. If you want the headings and 
subheadings in a different font, you can select the text of the heading or subheading and 
change its font just as you would with a word processor.

Chapter 3
[ 57 ]
Have a go hero –  choose another font if you wish
I recommend Georgia or Verdana (see the answer to Pop quiz 3.1 if you can't remember 
why). But that doesn't mean that its the eleventh commandment. If you want to choose 
another font, for whatever reason, feel free to do so.
As a matter of fact, why not try out all the fonts to see which one you like the best?
Summary
In this chapter, you continued building your site template. You chose a Theme, a Style, a 
Navigation layout, a Color scheme, and the site Font. All these settings apply to your website 
as a whole, not only to individual pages. Therefore, all your pages look consistent.
Office Live Small Business offers built-in choices for most of these options. But if you're 
not really happy with the available choices, you can customize some of the options. You 
can customize a color scheme, for example, and build a custom theme.
At this stage though, I advise you to stick to the built-in options with a promise that I'll 
introduce you to the advanced options later on in the book. The reason is simple: at this 
stage, I just want you to get comfortable with Site Designer and take small steps towards 
building your site. You'll have ample opportunity later to tweak individual settings without 
losing any of the work that you've already done.
To recap:
Your website's Theme is simply a picture that sets the tone for your site. Office Live 
Small Business has a large choice of themes built-in.
A Style determines how the picture on the theme is laid out in your website's 
header. You can choose one of several available styles. You can't layout every 
element with pin-point precision individually, but the available styles cover 
a good number of possibilities.
Your website can have two levels of navigation: primary and secondary. The 
Navigation layout determines where the primary and secondary navigation links 
will appear on your web pages. I advised you to choose the Top layout, which 
places both the primary and secondary links at the top of your web pages.
A Color scheme determines the colors of individual elements on your web pages 
such as the page background and the color of navigation links. Office Live Small 
Business has a wide range of professionally designed color schemes built in.
The site Font is the base font for the text on your web pages. But you can change 
the font of any block of text on any page, just as you would with a word processor.
In the next chapter, you'll give the finishing touches to your site template.

Setting Page Display Options
In the last couple of chapters, you customized the design settings such as site 
name, slogan, and footers that relate to your website's content. In this chapter, 
you'll customize settings that affect the look and feel of the pages on your site.
To begin this chapter, you'll:
Choose a page width setting
Choose a page alignment setting
Choose a page background setting
Get rid of the Office Live Small Business logo
Get rid of the Windows Live Search box
At this stage, you'll have set all the site-level design options that you can possibly set 
using Office Live Small Business interactive dialogs. If you wish to customize your site even 
further, you certainly can, but you'll have to go beyond the ease of interactive dialogs and 
venture into writing custom instructions. If you're cringing at the thought of writing custom 
instructions, relax! It's easier than it sounds. Besides, I'll tell you what instructions to write 
and where to write them later in this chapter. All you'll need to do is type them.
Now, Office Live Small Business caters to the needs of everybody—from a complete novice 
to a seasoned pro. But to keep the program simple and accessible to novices, Site Designer 
hides some of the Advanced design features right out of the box. You'll have to activate 
them explicitly if you want to use them.

So, let's get cracking!
Setting site options
In Chapter 3, I showed you how a theme can alter the look and feel of your website. Let me 
now introduce a few additional options for fine-tuning the look and feel.
Time for action – opening the Site options dialog
1. Sign in to your Office Live Small Business account, if you haven't done so already, 
and go to Page Manager.
2. Pull down the Design Site menu from the Page Manager toolbar and select, 
Design site. The Site Designer opens.
From now on, I'll spare you the repetition of these two steps. By now, you should 
know how to open Site Designer. So, I'll simply tell you to go to Site Designer.
Click on the Options button on the ribbon. The Site options dialog opens:


Chapter 4
[ 61 ]
3. In the Page width dropdown box, select 780px. This sets your web pages to be 
780 pixels wide. The other width option is 100%, but I don't recommend it.
Why 780 pixels? Why not 100%?
Web pages that have a width of 100% adjust automatically to the resolution of a 
visitor's monitor. They allow you, the designer, to make the best possible use of 
available screen real estate. If you're designing an information portal, for example, 
you'll want to squeeze out every square inch of space that you can find, and then 
some; so, setting the page width to 100% is a no-brainer.
But small-business websites tend to be rather light on content. If you don't have 
much content and still set the page width to 100%, your web pages end up having 
just a couple of lines of text at the top and vast empty regions underneath. When 
that happens, you're tempted to fill those empty regions with irrelevant images, 
advertisements, animations, and other equally useless 'eye candy'. When you set 
the page width to 780 pixels, those empty areas don't appear as overpowering, 
and your site looks more balanced.
But there's also a disadvantage in choosing the 780px setting. It became popular 
when 800 X 600 was the most common monitor resolution. A 780 pixels wide 
web page filled the entire screen, after leaving 20 pixels for the browser's vertical 
scrollbar. But with advancing technology, people are gravitating towards bigger, 
wider, and higher resolution monitors. So, some people find the page width of 
780 pixels too narrow.
And, I agree. I prefer a width of 980 pixels for small websites because it's neither 
too wide not too narrow. But as you can see, Office Live Small Business only gives 
you two choices: 100% or 780px.
Fortunately, there's a way to override the setting and make your web pages 
980 pixels (or any number of pixels, for that matter) wide. I'll show you how 
to do that in the final section of this chapter. For now, just set it to 780px.
That said, if you're a budding writer, artist, or photographer, and have plenty of 
content for your web pages, you might find even 980 pixels to be too narrow. If 
that's the case, by all means set the page width to 100%.
4. In the Page alignment dropdown box, select Center. Note that you can choose this 
setting only if your page width is set to 780px.
Why not align the page to the left (or the right) margin?
Let's say your web page is 780 pixels wide and a visitor's monitor resolution is 
1024 X 768 pixels. Even after you account for the 20 pixels that the browser's 
vertical scrollbar takes up, you're left with a band of blank space 224 pixels wide.

Setting Page Display Options
[ 62 ]
If you align your page to the left margin of the browser window, your pages will have 
the entire band of blank space on the right side of the page. When you center your 
page with respect to the browser window, you get a band 112 pixels wide on either 
side of your page. That gives a more balanced look to your page.
5. In the Display site background as dropdown, select either Flat color or Gradient.
Why not white?
When you set a fixed width, such as 780 pixels, for your website, it's a good idea 
to choose a colored background because it acts like a picture frame and focuses 
a vistor's attention on the content inside it.
Depending on the Theme and Style you choose, the background color may be light 
or dark. If the background is too dark for your liking, choose the Gradient option, 
which softens the bold background. If the background is light, Flat color is often 
the better choice.
However, I recommend that you try both the options and choose the one that you 
like the best.
6. Uncheck the Display "Powered by Microsoft Office Live" logo checkbox.
Why?
The logo that shows up at the bottom of your pages is an advertisement for Office 
Live Small Business. Just as you don't put up other people's advertisements in 
your office, there's no need to display them on your website. Besides, if you hover 
your mouse over the logo, you see a tooltip that invites you to Get a free website 
and more as shown:
You may not be paying a dime for your website, but you don't have to tell the 
whole world.

Chapter 4
[ 63 ]
7. Deselect the Display Windows Live Search box checkbox.
Why hide the search box?
Office Live Small Business's search box is for searching the entire Web, not the 
contents of your website.
Although you'll often see such boxes on amateur websites, they aren't really 
appropriate for a business website, such as yours. After all, the reason that you're 
building your website is that you want to tell visitors about your business, not 
because you want to encourage them to search the Web.
Browse through any corporate website, including Microsoft's own, and you'll be 
hard-pressed to find a Windows Live or a Google search box. The reason is obvious: 
these boxes make sense only on search portals.
8. Save your work and preview the website. Confirm that the search box at the top and 
the Office Live Small Business logo at the bottom are now hidden.
9. Close the preview window and return to the Site Designer.
What just happened?
You just set the page and display options for your web pages. We're almost done with the 
site design part. Starting with the next chapter, we'll start building individual web pages. 
Then, we'll come back and tweak the site design setting in Chapter 8. But, let's lay down 
the groundwork for those tweaks in the next section.
Have a go hero – experiment with different page options
Although I handed down the edicts on the settings that you should choose, I recommend 
trying out alternate settings as well—as always. For example, you could try setting the 
background to Blank. Depending on your style and theme, a white background might 
look better, who knows!
Introducing Advanced design features
You've now set, or at least seen, every design option that you can set interactively. But what 
if you wanted to tweak some of the settings a little more? Make the font size of the footer 
links smaller, perhaps? Or change the width of the site to 980 pixels as we discussed?

Setting Page Display Options
[ 64 ]
Office Live Small Business does allow you to poke under its hood to change these and other 
settings. However, you must know some of those three and four-letter technologies to boldly 
go where no casual Office Live Small Business user has gone before! Because most casual 
users don't want to be bothered with HTML, CSS, XML, and XSLT (whatever they might 
mean), Office Live Small Business doesn't expose the features for overriding its settings 
right out of the box. You must explicitly enable Office Live Small Business's Advanced design 
features, which allow you to peek under the hood.
Time for action – activating Advanced design features
1. Sign in to your Office Live Small Business account, if you haven't done so already, 
and go to Page Manager.
2. Click on the Site actions tile to pull down the Site actions menu and then choose 
Activate advanced design features as shown.
3. A confirmation dialog pops up as shown in the next screenshot:

[ 65 ]
4. Click OK. The dialog disappears and Page Manager refreshes. The Advanced 
design features are now enabled. Notice the first signs of change in the Page 
Manager—you should now see a new Save as template link against the entry for 
each page. Although you won't be doing anything with that link as yet, you'll soon 
see that it's a handy tool that will enable you to bring the same look and feel to all 
the web pages on your site. Notice the Save as template links in the next image:
What just happened?
You just enabled the Advanced design features that enable you to manipulate the inner 
workings of your website manually. Once you activate these features, Office Live Small 
Business adds several links and buttons to your site management dashboard. To see a 
complete list of changes to your dashboard, visit http://www.officeliveguide.com/
advanceddesignfeatures.aspx.
By the way, you can deactivate these features by pulling down the Site actions menu again 
and selecting Deactivate advanced design features. But then you'll lose all the tweaks 
you made using the features. As you now are an advanced user anyway, we'll always 
leave them on.
Have a go hero – preview your site's stylesheet
Go to Site Designer. Can you spot an obvious change to its ribbon? It now sports a brand 
new button, Style sheet. Click it. The Style sheet dialog opens. At the top of the dialog is 
a blue link that says View default CSS. CSS stands for Cascading StyleSheet. A CSS defines 
how colors, fonts, positioning, and other layout elements apply to your web pages.

Setting Page Display Options
[ 66 ]
Click on the link. You'll see some code in the window that pops up. The code is, in fact, the 
CSS for your site. It determines how your site looks, trust me! But don't worry; you don't 
have to understand it. Just be aware of its function and that you can now manipulate it to 
your heart's content, thanks to the Advanced design features.
When you're done, close the window and then click the Cancel button in the Style sheet 
dialog to return to Page Manager.
Pop quiz 4.1 
1.	 Your website's Advanced Design Features enable you to:
A.	 Set your website's title
B.	 Tweak design features not exposed in the Site Designer or the Page Editor
C.	 Search the web using Windows Live Search
D.	 Secure your website against unauthorized access
Using Advanced design features
Let me now give you a glimpse of the power that Advanced Design Features give you in 
styling your site. Let's change the width of your site from 780 pixels to 980 pixels.
Time for action – overriding the site width setting
1. Go to Site Designer and click on the Style sheet button on its ribbon. The 
Style sheet dialog opens as shown:

Chapter 4
[ 67 ]
2. Select the Apply custom CSS code to my Website checkbox. Then, click inside the 
textbox that says Add your custom CSS code here….
3. Delete the text in the box and type 
.MS_MasterFrame { width:980px; } 
as shown in the following screenshot:
Always type the CSS code EXACTLY as shown in the last screenshot. If you miss a 
semi-colon here or a colon there, the code won't do what it's supposed to do.
4. Click OK. The stylesheet dialog goes away and you return to Page Manager. Notice 
that the page in Site Designer is now wider.
5. Save your work and preview the website. Confirm that the page now appears wider.
If the page doesn't appear any wider, go back and check whether you 
typed the CSS code EXACTLY as shown, including the semi-colon, the 
colon, the curly braces, and the blank space between words.
6. Close the preview window.
What just happened?
You just added a style to your stylesheet that caused it to make your web pages wider. 
The stylesheet is just one of the features that you can access by activating the Advanced 
design features, but we'll use it extensively to alter the look and feel of your web pages 
in Chapter 8.

Summary
In this chapter, you gave finishing touches to your site template. You set the width and 
alignment for your web pages. Then, you chose a page background. Finally, you got rid 
of the Microsoft Office Small Business logo and the Windows Live Search box from your 
site template.
This completed the interactive design options available to you. Then, I showed you how 
to activate Advanced design features so that you can tweak some of the settings that you 
made interactively. As an example, I showed you how to override the site width setting 
with custom CSS.
To recap:
You can let your web pages stretch to the width of the entire browser window or 
limit their width to 780 pixels. If your website is a typical small-business website, 
you are not likely to have lots of text content on your web pages. Therefore, web 
pages 780 pixels wide are likely to look better on your site than pages that take 
up the entire width of the browser.
Pages that don't take up the entire width of the browser look better when they're 
centered in the window.
You can choose a white or a colored background for your web pages. Colored 
backgrounds can be flat or they can have a gradient. You should choose a colored 
background, flat or with a gradient, because the backgrounds help.
You can embed the Office Live Small Business logo in the footers of your web pages. 
I recommend that you hide it.
You can also display a Windows Live Search box on your web pages. I recommend 
hiding it for two reasons. First, small websites—the kind you build with Office Live 
Small Business—tend to have only a few pages and therefore, don't really need a 
search box. Second, your site is not a search engine. Few people, if any at all, will 
come to your site to submit a search query to the Windows Live search engine.
If your design requirements go beyond the options that you can set interactively, 
you can write custom instructions. To do so, you must enable Office Live Small 
Business's Advanced Design Features.
You have not finished yet, but the basic framework of your website is now in place. We'll 
come back and tweak a few more settings in Chapter 8.
In the next chapter, you'll finally start building and editing web pages.

Building Your Website's Skeleton
In Chapter 1, I introduced Office Live Small Business's two main design tools, 
Site Designer and Page Editor. Then, in Chapters 2, 3, and 4, I showed you how 
to use Site Designer to customize your website's design options. In this chapter, 
I'll show you how to use Page Editor to create, edit, and delete web pages.
The goal is to create a skeleton for your website by building four skeletal web pages 
that will serve as your website's foundation. In the theory of web design, there's no such 
thing as a skeletal web page. For the purpose of this discussion, I just made the term up 
to refer to web pages that every small-business website, including yours, should have at 
the bare minimum:
A Home page that acts as the gateway to your site
An About Us page that tells a visitor about you and your business
A Contact Us page that enables visitors to contact you
A Privacy Policy page that tells visitors how you use their personal information, such 
as their names and e-mail addresses
Come to think of it, the starter website that Office Live Small Business built for you already 
has the first three pages in this list. And for good reason, even the professional designers at 
Microsoft, who built the starter website, think that pages along these lines are pretty much 
essential for most small-business websites.

Building Your Website’s Skeleton
[ 70 ]
So, here's the plan:
You'll begin by customizing the layout of the homepage. Once you're happy with 
the layout, you'll save it as a template that you can use to build new web pages. 
You'll then use this template to re-create the About Us and Contact Us pages. Why? 
Because you want all the pages on your website to look similar. The only way to do 
that reliably is to use the same template for all of them.
Web pages need content. As I don't know much about your business, I can't provide 
you with readymade content for your web pages. But I'll give you tips on where to 
find good copy and pictures. I'll also give a few pointers on how to write good copy, 
if necessary. Using your new credentials as a copy writer, you'll write a copy for the 
two web pages that you've already built.
You'll then add a new page, the Privacy Policy page, to your website. It goes without 
saying that you'll write a copy for that as well.
Finally, you'll learn how to delete a web page by getting rid of the Site Map page.
By the time you're done with this chapter, you'll have a fully functional four-page 
mini-website—content and all. In the rest of this book, you'll build on this foundation 
by improving the content of these pages and adding supplementary pages that describe 
your products, services, or whatever it is that you sell or hype.
Editing the home page
The Page Editor is the tool for editing web pages in Office Live Small Business. Because 
I introduced the tool way back in Chapter 1, let's recap its features by opening the 
Home page.
Time for action – opening the Home page in Page Editor
1. Sign in to your Office Live Small Business account, if you haven't done so already, 
and go to Page Manager.
2. Click the Edit link under the Options column for the Home page. The page opens in 
Office Live Small Business Page Editor, as shown in the next screenshot:

From now on, I won't repeat these instructions; when I want you to open a page 
for editing, I'll simply say, Open such-and-such page in the Page Editor.
What just happened?
You opened the Home page in the Page Editor.
Just like the Site Designer, the Page Editor too, has a Microsoft Office 2007-style ribbon at 
the top. The first two groups on the ribbon, Font and Paragraph, display familiar text editing 
commands. You can use these commands to format the text on the page just as you would 
on a word processor. If you want to underline a chunk of text, for example, select the text 
with your mouse and click the U button in the Font group on the ribbon, as shown:

If you want to right-justify a paragraph of text, place the cursor anywhere in the paragraph 
and click the Align Right button in the Paragraph group, as shown:
See? Just like a word processor, as I said.
The next group on the ribbon; Insert, displays commands that allow you to insert objects 
such as images, tables, and hyperlinks on the web page. Place the cursor anywhere in a 
zone—one of the regions on the page that's enclosed by red dotted lines, and click the 
Horizontal line button in the Insert group. Recall from Chapter 1 that a zone is an editable 
area on the page. All content on a page must reside within a zone. The Horizontal line 
button is shown in the next screenshot:
A horizontal line appears just below the cursor.
CTRL+Z works not only with text, but also with any other object that 
you insert on a page.
The last group on the ribbon, Advanced, displays commands for manipulating some of the 
page's properties. Click on the Page Properties button, for example, and the Page properties 
dialog that you saw in Chapter 1 pops up.

Chapter 5
[ 73 ]
It's quite convenient to be able to access the Page properties dialog from the Page Editor, as 
you just did, and also from the Page Manager, as you did in Chapter 1. You'll see that Office 
Live Small Business duplicates many such links to make your life easier.
Some buttons, such as the Layout button in the Advanced group, have a little 
downward-pointing arrow at the bottom. Clicking them will open a drop-down 
selection menu. Go ahead, try it!
Some other buttons, such as the Navigation button in the Advanced group, pop up dialog 
boxes where you can set properties.
The rest, such as the Horizontal line button, work on the web page's text as you just saw.
Don't worry if you don't understand what every command does at this stage; you'll go over 
them as you work along.
Have a go hero – experiment with Page Editor commands
Have a go at Page Editor's commands. It wouldn't harm to click a few of them and get an 
idea of Page Editor's features and capabilities. Add a table. Change the color of the text. 
Make the font bigger. Do whatever you please. And don't hesitate to experiment for fear 
of destroying the page. You can undo any change by pressing CTRL+Z.
How many changes can you undo?
I haven't really counted, so I can't give you an exact figure such as 23 or 
127. But just as on a word processor, you can undo a series of changes with 
successive CTRL+Zs.
I've noticed, however, that on some pages, CTRL+Z works only once for no 
apparent reason. In any case, you can effectively cancel all unsaved changes 
to a web page by not saving the page.
How? Read on.
Just as in Site Designer, you can preview your website after modifying a page in Page Editor. 
Click the View button at the top of the ribbon. A dialog pops up enquiring whether you wish 
to save the changes. If you do, you'd click OK. But because you were just playing around with 
the page, you can click Cancel this time. As you'd expect, you'd click the Save button, right 
next to the View button, if you wanted to save your changes.
Close the preview window if it's still open, and return to Page Editor.

Choosing a page layout
Presently, the Home page is laid out with three content zones: Zone 1 at the top, spanning 
the entire width of the page, and Zone 2 and Zone 3 below it, side-by-side. This is not the 
only layout available; Page Editor has several more. Some have three zones, others have two, 
and the rest only have a single zone. You can change the layout of a page at any time; even 
after you've built the page. Let's change the layout of the Home page.
Time for action – changing the Layout
1. Open the Home page in Page Editor.
2. Click the Layout button in the Advanced group of the ribbon. A menu drops down 
to reveal the available layouts as shown:
Notice that each option has a little thumbnail schematic of the layout that it 
represents. The option that corresponds to the present layout of your Home 
page, Three, span top, is highlighted.

Chapter 5
[ 75 ]
3. Choose the Three, side by side option. The drop-down goes away and your 
Home page rearranges itself to conform to the new layout as shown:
4. Notice that although the Page Editor has rearranged the zones, it has preserved the 
content inside each.
But what if the layout I choose has fewer than three or more than three zones?
Aha! That gets the Page Editor into a fix. While transferring the content of three 
zones to three new zones is quite straightforward, there's no logical way of 
transferring the content of three zones to two or four zones. So the Page Editor 
takes its best guess in rearranging the content. If you don't like it, you can always 
cut some content from one zone and paste it into another.
5. Save the page and preview the website.
6. Close the preview window and return to the Page Editor.

What just happened?
You learnt how to change the layout of a page in Page Editor. So what's the big deal? Well, 
it's a good idea to use the same layout on most of the pages on your website, if not all. 
A common layout makes life easier for you as well as the people who visit your site—you 
can build your site faster, and visitors can find things on your pages in predictable places. 
Therefore, choosing a single good layout for your website often plays a prominent role in 
its success.
But then, you might ask, how come the good folks at Microsoft applied a different layout 
to every page on the starter site? The answer is that a single layout makes sense for small 
websites, such as yours, but sites with thousands of pages are often arranged into several 
logical sections and it's not unreasonable for pages in different sections to have different 
layouts. The starter site simply shows you an assortment of layouts, to give you an idea 
of how they look.
You'll use the Three, side by side layout you just chose. But you won't be adding content 
to each of the zones; you'll use the middle zone for content and the zones on either side 
for padding.
If multiple zones are available, why not use them?
In Chapter 4, I recommended that you set your site's width to 780 pixels because 
small websites often don't have much content when they start out. The same 
reasoning applies to the number of zones on your pages. More often than not, 
your content will fit comfortably in a single zone. If you choose a multiple-zone 
layout, you'll be hard pressed to find content to put into each of them.
And remember, even if you're using a single zone, two more are available, if 
need be, in the layout that you just chose. In fact, I'll show you how to use 
another zone without compromising the look and feel of your website when 
we get around to enhancing the Contact Us page in Chapter 7.
Customizing the page layout
That's better. Your page now has precisely the number of zones that you wanted it to have. 
But what if you don't like how wide a specific zone is? Fear not! You can change the width 
of any zone on your page quite easily.

Chapter 5
[ 77 ]
Time for action – customizing a layout
1. Select the content in Zone 1 and delete it.
Unless you've played with the page layout and somehow managed to 
change the original order of the zones, the zones should be numbered 
1, 2, and 3 from left to right. That's what I assume in the instructions. 
If your arrangement is different, read the instructions accordingly.
2. Select the content in Zone 3 and delete it.
3. Just above the top corners of each zone, you'll see a pair of drag handles as shown:
You can use them to adjust the width of the zone, just as you can use the drag 
handles on a word processor to adjust the width of the editable area of a document.
4. Click on the right drag handle of Zone 1 and drag it towards the left. That should 
make Zone 1 narrower.
5. Click the left drag handle of Zone 3 and drag it towards the right. That should 
make Zone 3 narrower.

Building Your Website’s Skeleton
[ 78 ]
6. Then use the drag handles of Zone 2, the middle zone, to stretch it on both sides. 
The end result should look something like this:
7. Select the content in Zone 2 and delete it.
8. At this stage, the cursor should be positioned in Zone 2. If it isn't, click in Zone 2 
to place the cursor in it.
9. Type Page Header.
Notice that the text appears in the font that you set to be the site font in 
Chapter 3. The font also appears as selected in the font selector on the ribbon. 
Anything you type in any of the zones will inherit this font by default, unless 
you change it explicitly. In the following images , you'll see the text in Georgia 
because that's the font I set for my site. You'll see it in the font that you selected.
10. Select the text and increase its font size to 5 (18 pt) using the font size selector 
on the ribbon.

Chapter 5
[ 79 ]
11. Place the cursor just after the text that you just typed and click on the Horizontal 
line button on the ribbon. A horizontal line appears below the header text. 
Your page should now look something like this:
12. Save your work and preview the site.
13. Close the preview window and return to the Page Editor.
What just happened?
You learnt how to customize the layout that you've chosen for your web pages. From now 
on, you'll use this customized layout for all of your web pages.
Creating a template for future use
But how do you copy the layout to other pages? Simple. You create a template from this web 
page that you can use as the starting point for new web pages.

Building Your Website’s Skeleton
[ 80 ]
Time for action – creating and saving a page template
1. Go to Page Manager.
2. Click the Save as template link under the Options column for the Home page. 
The Save as template dialog pops up, as shown:
3. Change the Template title to Base Template.
4. Change the File name to base.
5. Type this Description: This is the site's base template. It has three columns 
side-by-side.
6. Click OK. The dialog goes away and you return to Page Manager.
7. Click the Template Gallery link in Page Manager's left navigation pane to go 
to the Template Gallery.
8. The template that you just created appears in the list of templates in the gallery as 
shown in the following screenshot:
www.allitebooks.com

Chapter 5
[ 81 ]
What just happened?
You created a template from your customized page layout. Office Live Small Business stored 
this template in a special area called the Template Gallery. You'll use this template as a 
starting point for all of the pages on your site. In fact, you'll build your first few pages using 
this template later in this chapter.
Have a go hero – view template properties
Just as the Page Manager helps you to manage web pages on your site, the Template Gallery 
helps you to manage your page templates.
Notice the familiar Options column with action links. Go ahead and view the properties of 
your only template. If you're up to it, you can delete the template and create it again.
What happens if I delete a template AFTER I use it to create a web page?
Don't worry, nothing bad happens. When you create a web page from a 
template, as you'll do very soon, Office Live Small Business copies the design 
elements from the template to the new page. So, even if you delete the 
template after creating a web page from it, that web page will remain hale 
and hearty.

Building Your Website’s Skeleton
[ 82 ]
At this stage, most people want to view their spanking new template. Unfortunately, there's 
no way to do so. You can only create templates and delete them. You can't edit them. The 
only way to "edit" a template is to create a page using that template, make the necessary 
edits, and save it as a new template.
If you end up doing something like this, and want to save the edited template 
with the same name as the original, just select the Overwrite existing template 
checkbox in the Save as template dialog.
Creating content for the home page
The home page is important to you because you perceive it as a way to introduce your 
business to a visitor. But to be brutally honest, a visitor isn't interested in reading a long 
mission statement or how your grandfather founded the business during the Great 
Depression. He wants to find something quickly.
What are the dimensions of that bookcase that you sell? How long does it take to get 
the delivery? How does the 'thingamajig' that you make compare to the equivalent 
'whatchamacallit' your competitor makes? How can he get in touch with you? Do you have 
a toll-free number? That's the kind of information that a visitor seeks when he arrives at 
your homepage.
Content is still king!
Okay, repeat after me: the purpose of a website is to provide the information 
that a visitor seeks quickly, efficiently, and intuitively.
Although good looks don't hurt, how a site looks doesn't really matter. What matters is the 
content that it provides and how easily a visitor can find it. No matter what anyone tells you, 
content is still king.
And yet, many site owners frustrate visitors by providing gobbledygook such as this, instead:
Our mission is to quickly engineer technologically superior products utilizing our unique 
high-quality intellectual capital while promoting personal employee growth and continuing 
to continually facilitate progressive allocation of capital to cutting-edge research which 
enables us to cut the time-to-market (TTM) of our groundbreaking new products by 
approximately half that of the industry average.
If they can't think of such profound nonsense, they resort to adorning their homepages with 
pictures of pretty women seated before a computer and talking on the phone, or of guys in 
pin-striped suits carrying briefcases against a backdrop of tall glass buildings. Such pictures 
only make sense on your homepage if you sell computers, phones, suits, briefcases, or, even 
tall glass buildings.

Chapter 5
[ 83 ]
The moral of the story is that, contrary to your first instincts, a web page shouldn't be a place 
for stuffing pompous text or meaningless eye-candy. It should be a place that helps a visitor 
find what he's looking for, quickly and intuitively.
So, what should you include on your homepage? Here's an example: the site I'm building 
with you is about this book. This is what I'll have on the home page:
Welcome small-business owners!
This website is the companion site to my book, Microsoft Office Live Small Business: 
Build and Customize your Business Website, published by Packt Publishing. The 
book will help you to build a website for your small business with Microsoft Office 
Live Small Business.
No, it won't morph you into a web-designer overnight, but it will show you how to 
squeeze the most out of Office Live Small Business to build an attractive, intuitive, 
and easy-to-use website without spending a penny.

on the text.

information, which the two primary groups of visitors; prospective buyers and owners,

Have a go hero – write copy for your home page
Okay, it's time to try your hand at writing copy.
Write a short paragraph about your business. Remember, no long history or 
bombastic mission statements; just a simple statement of what you do.
Group the potential visitors to your site into two or three major groups, just as I 
did for my site. Then, list out bullet points that describe the information that they're 
likely to look for.
Do you have marketing materials for your business?
Do you use brochures, advertisement copy, one-page write-ups, or other similar 
marketing aids to promote your business offline? If so, you can use them as the 
starting point for your copy.
The copy doesn't have to be perfect; you'll have plenty of opportunities later to improve it. 
Like Rome, websites aren't built in a day either.
Use Notepad or a plain text editor for writing your copy. After you write the 
copy, you'll cut and paste it onto your Home page in the Page Editor. Recall that 
Page Editor acts as a word processor of sorts. Its styles may not necessarily be 
compatible with the styles of another word processor, such as Microsoft Word. 
Therefore, if you cut text from Microsoft Word and paste it on to Page Editor, its 
styles will overwrite the styles that you've set in Page Editor.
So, you should write your copy in a plain text editor, such as Notepad, which 
doesn't apply styles to text.
Building the Home page
Now that you have some copy for your Home page, let's go ahead and build it.
Time for action – add copy to the Home page
1. Open the document that contains the text that you've just written. Select the entire 
copy and copy it to the clipboard.
2. Open your Home page in the Page Editor.
3. Select the text Page Header along with the horizontal line below it and delete it; 
you don't really need a page header on the Home page.
4. Position the cursor in Zone 2 and paste the text from your clipboard.

5. Format the text using Page Editor's editing features. When you have finished, your 
page should look something like this:
6. Save your work and preview the site.
What just happened?
You took the first stab at your Home page. Nothing exotic yet, but hopefully, you now have 
some meaningful content in place on the Home page. In the next chapter, we'll turn those 
bullet points into hyperlinks.

Building Your Website’s Skeleton
[ 86 ]
Re-creating the About Us page
Okay, your Home page is now all set. Let's move on to the About Us page. Yes, I know: 
Office Live Small Business has already created an About Us page for your starter website. 
The trouble is, it doesn't use the same template as your Home page.
Now that's a big no-no. Remember, we agreed that all web pages on your site will use your 
template. So, we'll have to find a way to apply your template to the About Us page.
Unfortunately, none exists. Once you create a web page, it's married to its template; in the 
present version of Office Live Small Business, at least. Your only option is to create it again 
using a new template.
Time for action – creating a new page from a template
1. Go to Page Manager.
2. Click the New Page link or icon on the toolbar. The Create web page dialog pops up 
as shown.

Chapter 5
[ 87 ]
3. The first step in creating a web page is to choose a template for it. The Create web 
page dialog lists Standard Templates, which come bundled with Office Live Small 
Business, and Custom Templates, which you build yourself. Notice that the template 
that you built on earlier, Base Template, appears as a custom template in the 
selection box on the left. Select Base Template and click Next. The dialog asks 
you to Choose page properties.
4. Enter About Us as the Page title. This title appears in the title bar of the browser 
when you view it.
The title About Us is appropriate when referring to companies, groups, 
organizations, or businesses that involve several people. If you're a 
magician, for example, and your website touts your services for children's 
birthday parties, then you may want to change the title to About Me, or 
About Steve, the Magician (assuming you're Steve, of course). It sounds a 
little less pretentious.
For my website, I'm going to change the title to About the Author, which is 
more appropriate for a website that's dedicated to a book.
5. Type aboutus in the web address text box.
The web address of the page will now be aboutus.aspx.
It's a good idea to match a page's title and its web address. Because my page title 
is About the Author, I'll enter abouttheauthor in this text box. If your page title is 
About Steve the Magician, you should enter aboutstevethemagician here.
6. Select the Overwrite existing page checkbox.
You're creating a new About Us page. But a page by that name already exists. By 
selecting this checkbox, you're telling Office Live Small Business to go ahead and 
overwrite it.
7. Select the Show this page in the navigation bar checkbox.
8. Notice that Office Live Small Business automatically enters About Us (or About Steve 
the Magician, or whatever you entered as the page's title) in the Navigation title 
text box.
9. Click Finish.

Building Your Website’s Skeleton
[ 88 ]
10. The Create web page dialog goes away and the About Us page you just created 
appears in the Page Editor as shown:
Hey! How come this picture shows both About Us and About the Author?
Elementary, my dear Watson! Because I didn't call my page aboutus.aspx. Had I 
done so, Office Live Small Business would have replaced the original aboutus.
aspx with my new aboutus.aspx.
Because I called it abouttheauthor.aspx, the original aboutus.aspx is still 
intact. If you're in the same boat as I am in, you'll have to delete the About Us 
page. I'll show you how to do that later in this chapter.
11. Select the text Page Header in Zone 2, and overwrite it with About Us (or About 
Steve the Magician, or whatever).
12. Save your work and preview the page.
13. Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.

Chapter 5
[ 89 ]
What just happened?
You replaced the About Us page that Office live Small Business automatically created for you 
with a new page that uses your custom page template. As we discussed earlier, it's a good 
idea to use a common template for all of the pages on your website. Hence this exercise.
Have a go hero – write copy for your about us page
The About Us page is for introducing your business to visitors. Do it concisely; nobody really 
has the time to read a five page profile. Here's the copy that I'm using for my website:
About the Author:
Rahul Pitre has been writing software of one sort or another for twenty-five years, the last 
dozen or so of which he has spent developing mostly websites and web applications. He 
runs Acxede, a software consulting and training firm in New York, where he oversees web 
application and content development for a variety of clients. He holds a Masters degree in 
Business Administration and Computer Information Systems.
Okay, it's your turn. Here's a rule of thumb that'll serve you well as you write some copy 
for this page:
Write about what people will want to know about you; not what you want to tell people 
about yourself.
Don't know where to start? Here are some points you might want to consider:
What you do.
How long you've been in business.
The area that you serve.
I highly recommend including your area and ZIP code in the copy. People often Google 
for phrases like Magicians in NY 10701. If you mention your general area and ZIP code 
in your text, there's a better chance of people finding you through search engines.
Are you an authorized dealer for some big company?
Again, people often search for phrases such as authorized Sony service center 
NY 10701.
Have you received awards or citations for excellence?
Are you a member of the Better Business Bureau or the local 
merchants' association?
If your services are professional in nature, do you have the necessary qualifications? 
Licenses? Registrations? Insurance requirements?

If you prefer writing conversational text, write it in short paragraphs. Alternatively, you can 
use a combination of text and bullet points. But, keep it short. And for heaven's sake, don't 
write a mission statement.
Remember to write the text in a plain text editor such as Notepad; 
not in a word processor.
Re-creating the Contact Us page
Now let us now create the Contact Us page again using your site's template.
Time for action – re-creating the Contact Us page
1. Go to Page Manager.
2. Click the New Page link or icon on the toolbar. The Create web page dialog pops up.
3. Select Base Template and click Next. The dialog asks you to Choose page properties.
4. Enter Contact Us as the Page title. This title appears in the title bar of the browser 
when you view it.
5. Type contactus in the web address textbox.
6. Select the Overwrite existing page checkbox.
7. Select the Show this page in the navigation bar checkbox.
8. Click Finish.
9. The Create web page dialog goes away and the Contact Us page you just created 
appears in the Page Editor.
10. Select the text Page Header in Zone 2, and overwrite it with Contact Us.
11. Save your work and preview the page.
What just happened?
You replaced the Contact Us page that Office live Small Business automatically created for 
you with a new page that uses your custom page template.

Chapter 5
[ 91 ]
The Contact Us page is kind of unique. You might have noticed that the page you just 
replaced had a form for visitors to contact you. Normally, you'd have to write a little program 
to process the information they provide. The program would extract the information from 
the form and e-mail it to you. Thankfully, Office Live Small Business has a built-in component 
that does the job admirably. All that you need to do is to set the e-mail address at which you 
wish to receive the e-mails.
Because you re-created the page, that form is now gone. But don't worry; you'll add it 
in Chapter 7. The reason why I'm deferring it for now is that you haven't worked your way 
through a few prerequisites yet.
Creating the Privacy Policy page
When you created your website's footer back in Chapter 2, you created a link to your 
website's "as yet non existent" privacy policy as shown:
Let's now create a page that states your privacy policy and activate the link to it in the footer.
Time for action – creating a new page from a template
1. Go to Page Manager.
2. Click the New Page link or icon on the toolbar. The Create web page dialog pops up.
3. Select Base Template under Custom Templates and click Next. The dialog asks 
you to Choose page properties.
4. Enter Privacy Policy as the Page title. This title appears in the title bar of the 
browser when you view it.
5. Recall that in Chapter 2, you configured the Privacy Policy link in the footer to point 
to a page named privacypolicy.aspx. For that link to work, you must call this 
page privacypolicy.aspx. Every web page built with Office Live Small Business 
automatically gets the extension .aspx. So, just enter privacypolicy in the 
Web address textbox.
I've seen .htm or .html extensions. What's .aspx?
Office Live Small Business runs on a web development platform called 
ASP.Net, which uses the .aspx extension by default.

Building Your Website’s Skeleton
[ 92 ]
6. Because this page will only be accessible from the link in the footer, you don't 
need to include it in the page navigation. So, uncheck the Show this page in the 
Navigation bar checkbox.
7. Click Finish.
8. The Create web page dialog goes away and the Privacy Policy page that you just 
created appears in the Page Editor, as shown in the next screenshot:
What just happened?
You created a brand new page for your website's privacy policy. You used the template that 
you built earlier in the chapter to create this page. Let's go ahead and write some copy for it.
Have a go hero – write copy for your Privacy Policy page
Your website will have a Contact Us page on which a visitor can provide his e-mail address 
and write you a short note as to what he wants. An e-mail address is considered personal 
information. So, it's a good idea to let people know what you plan to do with their e-mail 
addresses. You can declare your intentions in a Privacy Policy statement.

Chapter 5
[ 93 ]
When you think of a Privacy Policy, a long document in verbose, understandable legalese with 
lots of hereinunders and thereinafters comes to mind. It doesn't have to be so. It's perfectly 
legal to make a legal document understandable. Here's the text that I'll use for my site:
OfficeLiveGuide.com's Privacy Policy:
The contact form on this website, should you choose to use it, sends the information 
that you enter, including your e-mail address, to me via e-mail.
I use the information solely for responding to your message. I treat it with the 
strictest confidence and do not share or sell it.
Okay, it's your turn again. But before you start banging away at your keyboard, understand 
that your Privacy Policy is legally binding upon you. You must abide by what you say in it. If, 
like me, you declare that you won't use the e-mail address for anything other than replying 
to the person, then you can't use it to send a mass-mailing to him every month, for example.
A good way to generate the privacy policy is to use the Direct Marketing Association's Privacy 
Policy Generator at http://www.dmaresponsibility.org/PPG. You simply fill in an 
online questionnaire and the generator generates a custom Privacy Policy for you. You can 
then edit it to make it simpler and easier to understand.
A Privacy Policy is a legal document. I'm not a lawyer and therefore not 
qualified to give you legal advice. Although DMA's Privacy Policy Generator 
is used widely, you should consult your lawyer in ascertaining the validity 
of the document that it generates.
As always, remember to write the text in a plain text editor such as Notepad; not in a 
word processor.
Building the Privacy Policy page
Once you are (and/or your lawyer is) happy with your copy, you can build the page.
Time for action – add copy to the Privacy Policy page
1. Open the document that contains the text of your Privacy Policy. Select all the 
text and copy it to the clipboard.
2. Open the Privacy Policy page in the Page Editor.
3. Select the text Page Header and replace it with Privacy Policy.
4. Position the cursor below the horizontal line under the header and paste the text 
from your clipboard.

Building Your Website’s Skeleton
[ 94 ]
5. Format the text using Page Editor's editing features. When you have finished, your 
page should look something like this:
Feel free to format the text to your liking. For example, I added my domain name 
OfficeLiveGuide.com to the header and made the words "do not" red to draw 
attention to them. Just don't go berserk and make every word a different color.
6. Save your work and preview your site.
7. Click Home on the navigation bar to go to the Home page.
8. Click the Privacy Policy link in the footer. If you've done everything right, you 
should be looking at your Privacy Policy page.

Deleting a page
You've come a long way! You now know how to edit existing web pages and create new ones. 
At some point, you'll invariably want to delete a web page, either because it's no longer 
necessary or because you messed it up so thoroughly that the only sensible option is to 
delete it! Let's prepare for that eventuality. To do so, you'll need a web page on your site 
that acts as a guinea pig. Let's volunteer the Site Map page.
What?!!! Don't we need a site map?
In a word: NO. Site maps exist for only one reason: to help visitors find a specific 
web page quickly. Although site maps are ubiquitous, they only make sense on 
large websites that house thousands upon thousands of pages. On such massive 
sites, just the site navigation can often not be detailed enough for a visitor to 
drill down to all major sections of the site.
Your little website is likely to have just a few pages, each of which is accessible 
from the site navigation. So, the site map is merely a copy of your site navigation, 
and perhaps, an additional link or two such as the Privacy Policy link. In my 
opinion, it doesn't add any value to your website. I think it gives your site an 
aura of false grandiose. So, I recommend that 
you delete it.
But you might beg to differ, with all due respect, in which case you can simply 
read the instructions below, instead of executing them, and then come back to 
this section when you eventually need to delete some other web page.
Time for action – deleting a web page 
1. Sign in to your Office Live Small Business account, if you haven't done so already, 
and go to Page Manager.
2. Click the Delete link under the Options column for the Site Map page.
3. The Message form webpage dialog pops up to confirm that you're within your 
senses to delete the page. Click OK to affirm that you are. Office Live Small Business 
deletes the page and the Page Manager refreshes to show the updated list of web 
pages on your site. Notice that the Site Map page no longer shows up in the list.

Building Your Website’s Skeleton
[ 96 ]
What just happened?
We decided that the Site Map page is somewhat redundant and deleted it. Into the bargain, 
you learnt how to delete web pages from your site.
How to delete a page—but only temporarily
From t﻿ime to time, you'll want to get rid of web pages from your website, but only 
temporarily. Let's say, every year you run a promotion for Christmas and another for 
Valentine's Day. So, you build a "Promotions" page and put it up on your website in 
December. Come January, the page would have served its purpose and you would not 
want it on your site until February, that is, when your Valentine's Day promotion begins.
You can make a page go away from your site in two ways:
Delete the page from your website
Take it off the site navigation so that visitors can't access it
When you delete a page, you send it into oblivion; there's no way to get it back. When you 
take a page off the site navigation, on the other hand, you don't obliterate it; you just hide it 
from visitors. You can reinstate it if need be, simply by adding it back to the site navigation.
Naturally, taking the page off the site navigation appears to be the better option. But as it 
turns out, there's a catch—visitors may still be able to go to the page if they've bookmarked 
it. Besides, it may appear in search engine results for a few days even after you've removed 
it from site navigation.
The second option of deleting the page comes with its own obvious baggage: you can't 
quickly alter the Christmas promotion page and turn it into a Valentine's Day promotion 
page. You've got to start from scratch to build a new one.
You might think that you're caught between a rock and a hard place. But don't worry;
 there's an easy way out. If you need to get rid of a web page temporarily, you can save it 
as a template and then delete it. When you want to resurrect it in a new incarnation, you 
can use the template that you saved to build a new page quickly.

Summary
Congratulations! You have covered a lot of ground in this chapter. You transformed the 
cookie-cutter starter website into your own distinctive website. Lots more remains to 
be done, of course, but you have got off to a good start.
To recap:
Your site's Home page is the gateway to your site. You should avoid the temptation 
to fill it up with nonsensical text and pictures.
Good websites use a common template for their pages so that visitors can find what 
they're looking for in expected locations. Office Live Small Business makes it easy to 
build templates by giving you the ability to save any web page as a template.
The success or failure of your site depends, to a great extent, on how easily and 
intuitively visitors can find what they're looking for. Therefore, you should write 
short, but meaningful copy. Remember, content is still king.
Every website that collects personal information from visitors should have a privacy 
policy. Remember, a privacy policy statement is a legal document; so do what you 
say you'll do in the document. Also, you may want to consult your lawyer before 
you finalize your privacy policy.
Although it's easy to delete web pages from your site permanently, there's no way 
to get rid of them temporarily. But you can work around the problem by saving the 
page as a template before deleting it and then recreating it from the template when 
you want it back.
In the next chapter, you'll build your site's information pages; pages that describe your 
products and services. If you're getting a bit restless about the pedestrian appearance of 
your site, have some patience. You'll embark upon a beautification drive of your site in 
the rest of the book, after you build the information pages in the next chapter.

Building the Information Pages
In Chapter 5, you built the skeleton of your website. The skeletal pages help a 
visitor get an overall sense of your business and help to create a positive image 
of the business in a visitor's mind.
But that's not the real reason that you're building a website. You're building 
it because you want people to know what you do, the products you sell, the 
services you provide, or simply your opinion, if you don't really sell anything.
The skeletal pages you've built so far don't seem to do any of that. Now, don't 
get me wrong! I'm not saying that those pages don't matter. They do. However, 
they're more like condiments: they just add flavor to the information that you 
really want to convey on your site.
In this chapter, you'll build the pages that display the information that your 
visitors are really looking for: pages that describe your products or services. I'll 
call them information pages to distinguish them from the utilitarian skeletal 
pages that you built in ����������
Chapter 5.
So, here's the plan:
Decide the information that should go on the information pages
Divide the information into logical sections
Sub-divide the information in each section into logical topics
Decide how to organize the sections and topics on the website
Create web pages to fit the organizational scheme






Building the Information Pages
[ 100 ]
By the time you're done with this chapter, your website will almost be complete information-
wise. In the next couple of chapters, you'll learn how to improve the presentation and utility 
of the information using images, links, tables, and even some eye-candy.
Selecting and organizing information for your site's 
information pages
Information pages provide answers to questions that a visitor may have about the products 
and/or services your business offers. Naturally, they should contain information about 
your products and/or services.
This book's companion site: a case study
Because I don't know what kind of business you're in, I can't provide the exact information 
for the ���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������
pages on your site and suggest how to organize them. But, I'll do the next best thing: 
I'll show you how I'd select and organize information for the information pages of this book's 
companion site—the site I'm building as you're building yours. By using my site as a case 
study, you'll easily be able to select and organize information for the information pages on 
your website.
Step 1: Decide the purpose of the website
The first step is to be clear about why I'm building this website. If I state the purpose of my 
site in clear terms, I'll be able to decide who my target audience is likely to be and what 
information they would want to seek on my site. Here's my site's statement of purpose:
I'm building my website because:
I want to promote my book and make people aware of it.
I want to provide information about my book to those who might be interested 
in building their own small-business websites with Office Live Small Business. The 
information I provide should help a visitor to decide whether the book is right for 
him/her.
I want to provide additional information and support to the smart people who've 
already bought my book.
Step 2: Specify potential visitors and classify them into groups
For my site, the likely visitors are small-business owners who want to build their own website 
on a shoe-string. I can divide them into two major categories:
Those who haven't bought my book yet
Those who have bought my book






Chapter 6
[ 101 ]
This classification is obviously based on the assumption that people who visit my site are 
either evaluating my book for a possible purchase, or have already bought it and are looking 
for additional information.
Surely, there are many other ways to classify the potential visitors to my site. But this 
classification makes the most sense because they align most closely with the purpose of my 
website. Although rival authors, friends and family, and random visitors are also potential 
categories of visitors, I won't consider them because their interests don't align with the 
website's purpose.
Step 3: Wear the visitors' hats and think of questions they'd ask
Visitors from each of the two groups will ask a different set of questions. The best way to 
speculate on what they'd want to know is to put myself in their shoes and make a list of 
questions they would ask. Here's my list:
Questions that people who haven't bought my book yet might ask:
Hmm! This appears to be the website for a book. What's this book about?
What the heck is Office Live Small Business?
Can I build a personal website with Office Live Small Business?
What exactly is in the book?
Can I download sample chapters?
I'm a beginner (or an advanced user). Is this book written for my level? Can it really 
help me to build my own website?
Do I need any fancy computer equipment?
Is building a website really this easy?
What do other people have to say about this book?
Where can I buy this book?
Questions that people who have already bought my book might ask:
Are there links to the online references mentioned in the book, so that I don't have 
to type in long web addresses?
Are errata available online?
Can I download the e-book if I've already bought a copy?
I found a typo or an error in the book. Can I submit an erratum?
Is there any bonus content or supplementary material?
I have a question for the author. Is there an easy way to contact him?
Office Live Small Business is not for me. Can I get my money back?

Building the Information Pages
[ 102 ]
Of course, this list is not exhaustive. I don't have to think of every possible question anyone 
might ever ask. As long as I cover the most common questions, I'll do just fine. Besides, 
building a website is an ongoing process. I can always add or delete content later, based 
on how visitors use the site.
Also, keep in mind that I haven't included every question that came to my mind in the list 
above, so as to keep this case study easy to follow. But if you visit the companion website at 
http://www.officeliveguide.com, you'll find the end result of this exercise remarkably 
similar to what I've presented here. So, I've followed what I've preached.
Step 4: Select questions that are worth answering
Just because someone might ask a question doesn't necessarily mean that I'd want to 
answer it. For example, someone who has bought the book might want to know whether 
he can get his money back.
Naturally, I'd like to think that not many would ask that question. But I wouldn't necessarily 
want to answer it even if someone actually did. That question is really not for me to answer; 
it should be addressed to the bookseller from whom the visitor bought the book. So, it 
doesn't exactly relate to the purpose of my website.
Some other questions in the list may not have answers. For example, it would take a while 
after the book is published for people to write reviews or express their opinions about it. So, 
I don't have an immediate answer to the question: What do other people have to say about 
this book?
So, the next step is to narrow down the list of questions and select only those questions that 
relate to your website's goals. Here's my shortened list:
Questions that people who haven't bought my book yet would ask:
Hmm! This appears to be the website for a book. What's this book about?
What the heck is Office Live Small Business?
What exactly is in the book?
I'm a beginner (or an advanced user). Is this book written for my level? Can it really 
help me build my own website?
Do I need any fancy computer equipment?
Where can I buy this book?
Questions that people who have already bought my book would ask:
Are there links to the online references mentioned in the book, so that I don't have 
to type in long web addresses?
Are errata available online?









Chapter 6
[ 103 ]
I found a typo or an error in the book. Can I submit an erratum?
Is there any bonus content or supplementary material?
I have a question for the author. Is there an easy way to contact him?
Step 5: Classify questions into topics
Answers to these questions will constitute the content of my site's information pages. But 
some of the questions might be related. Consider these two questions:
Are online errata available?
I found a typo or an error in the book. Can I submit an erratum?
They are both about the broader topic, Errata. Therefore, I can lump them together. In other 
words, I can translate the questions that I've selected into broad information topics. Here's 
my translated list:
Information for people who haven't bought my book yet:
Hmm! This appears to be the website for a book. What's this book about?
I'm a beginner (or an advanced user). Is this book written for my level?
Can it really help me to build my own website?
Do I need any fancy computer equipment?
Translation: Book Description
What the heck is Office Live Small Business?
Translation: About Office Live Small Business
What exactly is in the book?
Translation: Book contents
Where can I buy this book?
Translation: How to purchase
Information for people who have already bought my book:
Are there links to the online references mentioned in the book, so that I don't have 
to type in long web addresses?
Translation: References
Are errata available online?
I found a typo or an error in the book. Can I submit an erratum?
Translation: Errata

Building the Information Pages
[ 104 ]
Is there any bonus content or supplementary material?
Translation: Online content
I have a question for the author. Is there an easy way to contact him?
Translation: Contact information
Each of the two groups of visitors; prospective buyers and current owners, will have 
a dedicated section on the website. Each section will then have a web page for every 
topic about which the visitors might ask questions.
Each section page on the website will be a top-level page. That means a link to it will appear 
on the site's primary navigation right next to the Home, About Us, and Contact Us links.
Each topic page in a section will be a second-level page on the website and a link to it will 
appear on the second-level navigation bar.
Step 6: Reword the section and topic names with phrases suitable 
for the website
The section and topic names that I've come up with are rather pedestrian. I had better replace 
them with something that sounds a little more professional. So, I'll reword them as follows:
About the Book
Book description
What's Office Live?
Sample content
Buy it
Owner's Section
References
Errata
Online content
Contact information
Step 7: Eliminate redundant information and finalize the page hierarchy
That's better! But before I finalize this information hierarchy, there's one more thing that 
I can do: eliminate redundant pages and arrange the topics logically.
The page for About the Book section and the page for Book description topic seem to have 
overlapping content. Why not consolidate it on the About the book section page? That way, 
I can eliminate an unnecessary topic page.











Chapter 6
[ 105 ]
And the Contact information topic under the Owner's Section is also somewhat redundant 
because my website already has a Contact Us page. So, I'll get rid of that too.
Now, my streamlined information hierarchy looks like this:
About the Book
What's Office Live?
Sample content
Buy it
Owner's Section
Online content
References
Errata
A few more examples
You might ask: What good is this example to me? I'm not building a companion website for 
your book.
Well, even if your website is not about a book, the process of selecting and organizing the 
information for your site's information pages remains essentially the same. Let's hustle 
through a couple more examples in the following sections to prove the point.
A website for children's art classes
Let's say you run art classes for children. A fast track to your website's information page 
hierarchy might run something like this:
Purpose:
I'm building a website because:
I want to inform parents of children (ages 5-12) about the drawing, painting, and 
pottery classes that I run
I want to publish a list of classes currently in session
I want to publish my registration policies and procedures
Types of visitors:
People looking for after-school activities for their children; particularly, art classes
People ready to register their children for classes

[ 106 ]
Questions:
Following are the questions that people who want to know more about the coaching classes 
would ask:
What programs do you run?
Who teaches the classes?
Are the programs taught at different levels or do all children attend the same class?
What will my child learn in the drawing (or painting, or pottery) class?
How many weeks does a class run for?
How much does it cost?
Would you return my money if my child doesn't like the class?
People who are ready to register would ask the following questions:
When does the next drawing (or painting, or pottery) class start?
Is a spot available in the next drawing (or painting, or pottery) class?
Do you have a schedule of upcoming classes?
How can I register?
When do I need to pay?
Do you accept credit cards?
Final page hierarchy:
Our Programs
Drawing
Painting
Pottery
Register
Class schedule
Registration
Payment

There's no single right way of arriving at the final page hierarchy. You may 
come up with a hierarchy different from mine. And a third person may think 
of yet another variation. But as long as the three of us start with the same 
statement of purpose, we will arrive at similar topics. We just may arrange 
them a bit differently.
A website for an appliance repair service
Let's take another example. Let's say, you run an appliance repair service. A fast track to your 
website's information page hierarchy might look something like this:
Purpose:
I'm building a website because:
I want to inform people about my services
I want to inform people about the kinds and brands of appliance I service
I want to give people an idea of the rates I charge
Types of visitors:
People who want to get their appliances serviced or repaired
Questions:
Following are the questions that people who want to get their appliances serviced 
would ask:
Do you repair refrigerators (or stoves, or washers, or dryers, or whatever)?
Do you perform routine preventive maintenance?
Do you repair Maytag washers (or Kenmore fridges, or Bosch stoves, or whatever)?
How much do you charge for a service call?
Do you carry the necessary spare parts?
Is your work guaranteed? For how long?
Do you accept credit cards?
Do you work in the evenings? On weekends?













Building the Information Pages
[ 108 ]
Final page hierarchy:
Services
Preventative maintenance
Repairs
Types and brands serviced
Working hours
Rates
Payment methods
Warranty
Here's an example of how two people may arrange the same information differently:
I came up with a page hierarchy for the appliance service site with the idea of keeping the 
site simple. But if you're a bit more adventurous, you might decide that the topics in my list 
actually belong to two broad categories: services and information about services. You might 
then come up with a page hierarchy as follows:
Services
Preventative Maintenance
Repairs
About Our Services
Types and brands serviced
Working hours
Rates
Payment methods
Warranty
In fact, this is a better page hierarchy. But that said, there's nothing drastically wrong with 
my original page hierarchy.
As I've stressed often, developing a website is an ongoing process. Some people will build 
their site my way. Some others will build it their way. And still others will initially build it my 
way so as to get up-and-running quickly and then change it gradually to their own hierarchy.

Have a go hero – selecting and organizing information for 
your website's information pages
By now, you should have a good handle on the process of selecting and organizing 
information. It's time to put your knowledge to good use.
Go ahead and do this exercise for your own website. Remember, I kept the questions simple 
for illustrative purposes. You don't have to. So, let the creative juices flow!
But here's a word of caution: don't be too ambitious and create a hierarchy of twenty 
sections and a hundred and fifty-seven topics. After all, you're building a website for 
your small business, not for General Electric.
Although I've grown hoarse saying it, I'll say it again: building a website is an iterative 
process. Start small and cover broad details in the first pass. Once you build a small 
but complete site, you can always expand it in the next iteration.
Creating section pages
Now that you're ready with your site's information hierarchy, let's go ahead and build the 
information pages. You'll create the section pages in this section and the topic pages in 
the next.
But I have the same problem in presenting a walk-through of creating a section page as I 
had with telling you how to select and organize information: I don't know anything about 
your website.
So, here's what I'll do. I'll present the walk-through using my website as an example. All 
you'll do is substitute my section name (About the Book) with yours. If you're building the 
appliance repair site we just talked about, for example, you'll substitute About the Book, 
with that site's section name, Services.
Time for action – creating a section page
1. Go to Page Manager and click the New Page button on its toolbar. The Create Web 
page wizard opens asking you to select a template.
2. Select Base Template under Custom Templates—that's the template that you 
created in Chapter 5 for your website. Click Next. The wizard asks you to choose 
page properties.
3. Type the name of the section you're creating this page for in the Page title text box. 
I'm creating this page for the About the Book section. So, I'll enter About the Book.

Building the Information Pages
[ 110 ]
4. Type the web address for this page in the Web address textbox. Recall that the web 
address is a unique address for a web page that appears in a browser's address bar. 
I'll type aboutthebook.
5. Select the Show this page in the Navigation bar checkbox. Office Live Small Business 
automatically fills in About the Book in the Navigation title textbox. That's fine 
with me.
6. I want this page to be at the top level of navigation, which is where Office Live 
Small Business has automatically put it in the Select parent drop-down box. 
That's fine with me too. The Choose page properties page is shown as follows:

Chapter 6
[ 111 ]
7. Click Finish.
8. Office Live Small Business creates the new page and opens it in Page Editor in a 
new window.
9. Save your work and preview the website. It should look something like this:
10. Notice that About the Book is now a new link on the site's main navigation bar. But 
there's a small problem. The new link is right at the end. I'd rather have it between 
Home and About Us. Let's fix that right away.
11. Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.
12. Click the Page properties button in the Advanced group of Page Editor's ribbon. The 
Choose page properties dialog opens.

[ 112 ]
13. Click the Edit navigation position button in the dialog window. The page's 
Navigation dialog opens, as shown:
14. Click the About the Book entry in the Select the page you want to move selection 
box on the left. The About the Book entry in the Page order selection box on the 
right automatically gets highlighted.
15. Click the Move up button twice until the link is between Home and About Us. 
Click OK. The Navigation dialog closes.
16. Click OK. The Choose page properties dialog closes and you return to Page Editor.
17. Notice that the About the Book link in the navigation bar has moved to its 
intended location.
18. While you're there, select the words Page Header in Zone 2 and overwrite them 
with About the Book.

21. Close the Page Editor and return to Page Manager.
What just happened?
You just created your first information section page. As you can see, you didn't have to do 
anything different to create the page. You followed, essentially, the same steps you followed 
in creating the pages in Chapter 5.
The only thing that you did differently here was to move the page to a different location on 
the site's main navigation. In fact, you can change the location of absolutely any page that's 
on the navigation bar by following these exact steps.
Have a go hero – creating the rest of the section pages
If your information hierarchy has more than one section, you'll have to create a page for each 
of them. Go ahead and do so now. And remember to position the new pages appropriately 
on your site's main navigation bar.

Creating topic pages
All right, your section pages are now ready. But you're not done yet. You still need to add the 
topic pages. That's what you'll do in this section.
Just as I did with creating the section pages, I'll present the walk-through using my website 
as an example. I'll create the first topic page (What's Office Live?) under About the Book 
section. All you'll have to do to follow along is substitute What's Office Live? with the name 
of your topic.
Time for action – creating a topic page
1.	 Go to Page Manager and click the New Page button on its toolbar. The Create Web 
page wizard opens asking you to select a template.
2.	 Select Base Template under Custom Templates. That's the template you 
created in Chapter 5 for your website. Click Next. The wizard asks you to 
choose page properties.
3.	 Type the name of the section you're creating this page for in the Page title 
textbox. I'm creating this page for the What's Office Live? topic. So, I'll enter 
What's Office Live?
4.	 Type the web address for this page in the Web address textbox. I'll 
type whatsofficelive.
5.	 Select the Show this page in the Navigation bar checkbox. Office Live Small Business 
automatically fills in What's Office Live? in the Navigation title textbox. That's fine 
with me.
6.	 Office Live Small Business automatically places it at the top level in the Select parent 
selection box. That's not where I want it. I want it to go under the About the Book 
section. In other words, I want the About the Book page to be this page's parent. 
To make that happen, pull down the options in the Select parent selection box and 
select About the Book. (You'll select your section name, of course.)
7.	 Click Finish.
Creating a new page is getting to be fairly routine. The process is the 
same, no matter what kind of page you're creating. So, from now 
on, I'll simply tell you to create a new page instead of repeating the 
steps above and save a few trees in the bargain.

You created your first topic page. So, what's different about it? Well, it's not a top-level 
page. Notice that it's not on the site's main navigation bar. It's on a second navigation bar 
that has just appeared. Also, notice that the About the Book link on the main navigation 
bar is highlighted.
The net effect is that the topic page appears to be a subordinate to the section page, which is 
exactly what the intention was.
Click on the About Us link. The second-level navigation bar goes away. That's to be expected 
because it made sense only in the context of the About the Book section. It only appears 
when you click on the About the Book link on the main navigation bar.
Have a go hero – creating the rest of the topic pages
Go ahead! Create a page for each of the topics under each of your sections now.
Creating content for the section pages
People come to websites, including yours, to find information quickly. The role of the section 
pages is to lead them to the desired information quickly and intuitively.

Building the Information Pages
[ 116 ]
Therefore, treat a section page like a table of contents for that section; it should basically 
contain a very brief description of the content of each of the topic pages, and underneath 
it, a link leading to that topic page.
Don't fill up section pages with long essays or marketing materials. The important 
information on your site is really going to be on the topic pages. Use the section pages 
to lead a visitor to the right topic page quickly.
Here's an example—possible content for the About the Book section page on my site:
Microsoft Office Live Small Business: Beginner's Guide is a practical beginner's guide 
to planning and building a small-business website with Office Live Small Business in 
next to no time.
Never heard of Office Live Small Business? Learn more.
What's in the book? See the table of contents and read a sample chapter.
Sold on the idea? Buy the book and build a website for your small business.
The underlined phrases are actually links that lead to the What's Office Live?, Sample 
content, and Buy it topic pages, respectively.
This text tells the visitors what the book is about, without wasting their time and leads them 
to the related topic pages. With such section pages, visitors can find the desired content 
quickly. Of course, you can write the same content in many different but equally effective 
ways. I've proposed a rule of thumb above, which won't let you down.
Have a go hero – writing content for section pages
Try your hand at writing content for each of your section pages. Don't worry; it doesn't 
have to be perfect. But make a serious attempt at writing something that's short and to 
the point. When your draft is ready, transfer the text to the corresponding section page 
on your website.
Don't remember how to?
Refer to page 84 in Chapter 5.
Creating content for the topic pages
The meat of your website's content will reside on the topic pages. But that doesn't mean you 
should write verbose essays on these pages. Provide detailed but to-the-point information.
Where do you start? Go back to the list of questions that prompted you to create this topic. 
Arrange those questions in a logical order. Then, write short answers for each of them.

Chapter 6
[ 117 ]
Tips for writing content for topic pages:
Write simple and short sentences. But don't overdo it. You don't want your text to 
read like a Dr. Seuss book.
Prefer short paragraphs.
Use bullet points instead of sentences wherever possible.
Write in active voice.
Use words that your audience would commonly use. Driving a car is the same thing 
as operating a vehicle but a lot easier to understand.
Write grammatically correct sentences.
Spell check your text.
Have a go hero – writing content for topic pages
Write content for each of your topic pages. Again, it doesn't have to be perfect. You'll have 
plenty of opportunities to revise the text later.
When your draft is ready, transfer the text to the appropriate topic page on your website.
Summary
In this chapter, you added information pages to your website. Your website is now 
structurally complete. You have all the necessary web pages in place. To recap:
Information pages on your website provide answers to questions that visitors may 
have about your products and services.
There is no standard way of arranging information pages on a website. Their 
structure and hierarchy depends on the specifics of your business. However, there's 
a more-or-less standard methodology that you can follow to come up with the 
structure and hierarchy of information pages for any website.
Creating information pages with Office Live Small Business's tools is easy. You create 
them in the same way that you'd create any other web page: from a template.
Office Live Small Business has a two-level navigation hierarchy. The section pages 
go at the top level and the topic pages go at the second level. The topic pages hold 
the meat of your site's content. The section pages help a visitor to arrive at the right 
topic page.
Your website now has all the text it needs. In the next chapter, you'll make your pages 
friendlier, prettier, and more useful by adding elements such as links, pictures, and tables.

Improving the Presentation 
Web pages that merely display text are rather monotonous. Presentational 
aids such as pictures, tables, maps, slide shows, and hyperlinks help you 
present information in a more digestible format. But using these elements on 
web pages is somewhat of a mixed bag. Manipulating pictures or hyperlinks 
is relatively straightforward, but working with live maps or slideshows is not. 
Thankfully, Office Live Small Business includes tools that make working with 
these elements a snap.
In this chapter, you'll learn how to use these tools. Specifically, you'll learn how to:
Use Page Editor's modules, which really are drop-in components of sorts, to add 
features that normally require some programming
Create hyperlinks
Upload pictures and place them on your web pages
Present data in a tabular format
By the time you work your way through this chapter, your web pages will stop looking like 
word processor documents and start looking like real web pages.
Introducing Page Editor's modules
In the early days of the Web, websites consisted mostly of static documents that displayed 
text and an occasional picture. But as the Web evolved, such static websites slowly gave 
way to dynamic web applications.
Web applications are like computer programs. They process data or information stored in 
databases of some sort and produce an output that you and I see as web pages.

Office Live Small Business is a web application too. It stores your 
information—site name, theme, color settings, text, images, and practically 
everything you create or set using Page Manager, Site Designer, and Page 
Editor, into a database. When a visitor requests a page on your site, Office 
Live Small Business does its magic and assembles all of these pieces of 
information into a web page and sends it to the visitor's browser.
But if a computer program is generating your web page, why not have it add a few advanced 
elements to the page? That's exactly what Office Live Small Business does. It includes little 
self-contained programs, called modules, which you can simply drop on your web pages to 
do fancy stuff that, otherwise, would require you to hire a programmer.
Setting up a contact form with the Contact Us module
Remember your Contact Us page had an e-mail form that disappeared when you re-created 
the page using your custom template? Let's roll up our sleeves and add it back using one of 
Page Editor's modules.
Time for action – creating a contact form
1. Go to Page Manager and open the Contact Us page in Page Editor.
2. Place the cursor at the bottom of Zone 2 and pull down the Module menu as shown:
[ 120 ]

Chapter 7
[ 121 ]
3. Click the Contact Us option. The Change the Contact Us settings dialog opens 
as shown in the next image:
If this is the first time that you're looking at this dialog, you might 
see a yellow band asking you to activate the Contact Manager. It is a 
rudimentary Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application. 
Just click the link in the yellow band to activate it.
4. Enter your e-mail address in the E-mail address textbox, and deselect the two 
checkboxes underneath it.
Office Live Small Business's Contact Manager application is fairly decent. 
It allows you to capture e-mail addresses of people who contact you 
through your website's Contact Us page. But some people are interested 
in collecting e-mail addresses from Contact Us forms; others are not. For 
simplicity's sake, I'll assume that you fall into the latter group. But if you 
do want to collect e-mail addresses, feel free to select these checkboxes.
5. Click Save. The dialog goes away and an e-mail form appears on your 
Contact Us page.
6. Save and preview the page.
7. Fill in the form on the page and click Submit.
8. If all goes well, you should see a "thank you" page informing you that the message 
was sent.
[ 121 ]

Improving the Presentation
[ 122 ]
9. Office Live Small Business packages the information that you entered into an e-mail 
message and sends it to the address that you just set. Go ahead, check your mailbox.
If you don't see the message in your mailbox, you probably mistyped your 
e-mail address in the module's settings. Go back to the Page Editor, right-
click on the module, and choose Properties…. The Change the Contact Us 
settings dialog opens, where you can correct your e-mail address.
10. Close the preview window and return to the Contact us page in Page Editor.
What just happened?
You used one of Office Live Small Business's built-in modules to create a contact form for 
your website.
As I mentioned earlier, you'd normally need program code, or script, to send out an e-mail 
message from a web page. Office Live Small Business has packaged the code within the Contact 
Us module. All you had to do was to drop the module on your page and choose a few relevant 
settings. In fact, the module does more than just send a message, it also validates the form 
and ensures that all of the required information, as indicated by the red stars on the form, is 
present on it before sending it out to you. If any of the required information is missing, Office 
Live Small Business displays a pop-up error message. Go ahead, try it!
By the way, you can change a module's settings and properties by right-clicking on it 
and choosing Properties… on the pop-up menu, which opens the properties dialog 
for the module.
Adding contact information
All right, people can now contact you through e-mail. But that's not the only contact 
information that people usually look for. Some might want to know your mailing address or 
the location of your office. Some others may simply want to call you or fax a document to 
you. Therefore, it's a good idea to include this information on your Contact Us page.

Chapter 7
[ 123 ]
I run my business from home. What if I don't want to display my address 
on my website?
That's a fair question. You don't really have to display your address on your 
website if you work from home.
Perhaps, you don't need to display the contact information. Take the site I'm 
building, for example. While I certainly intend to answer questions that readers 
like you may have, I don't want people calling me at an inconvenient time just to 
ask a question about Office Live Small Business. Therefore, the contact form is, 
without question, the appropriate contact vehicle for my website.
If your situation is like mine, it's perfectly all right to have just the contact 
form on your Contact Us page. But for most businesses, a phone number, a fax 
number, a P.O Box, or anything besides just a contact form will help to convince 
people that you run a legitimate business and not some shady operation.
Time for action – adding contact information
1. Go to Page Manager and open the Contact Us page in Page Editor, if it's not 
already open.
2. Make Zone 2 narrower by dragging its right drag-handle towards the left as 
shown in the next image:

Improving the Presentation
[ 124 ]
3. The page should now look like this in Page Editor:
4. Now make Zone 3 wider by dragging its left drag-handle towards the left. The page 
should look like this in Page Editor:

5. Now, type your address information in Zone 3.
6. Save your work and preview the page. It should look something like this:
7. Depending on how wide your address lines are, your page might look a bit 
off-center, like the picture above. Let's fix that.
8. Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.
9. Drag the right drag-handle of Zone 2 and the left drag-handle of Zone 3 to the right 
until the page appears centered.

Improving the Presentation
[ 126 ]
10. Save your work and preview the page. It should now look something like this:
11. That's much better! There's roughly equal white space on either side of the content.
12. Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.
What just happened?
You added your contact information to the Contact Us page, so that people can contact you 
by phone, fax, or snail-mail as well.
In the bargain, you also learned how to adjust your page template to accommodate contents 
of different widths.
Displaying a map and driving directions
Now that people can get your address from your website, why not make their life easier by 
providing a map and driving directions? Sure, not a problem! Page Editor has a Map and 
directions module just for that purpose. Here's how it works:

Chapter 7
[ 127 ]
You drop it on a page and fill in the address that you want a map of. The module gets the 
map from Microsoft's MapPoint service and displays it on your web page along with a 
hyperlink for directions. When you click on the hyperlink, MSN's Driving Directions page 
appears in a new window.
Time for action – creating a map and driving directions page
1. Go to Page Manager and click the New Page button on its toolbar. The Create Web 
page wizard opens, asking you to select a template.
2. Select Base Template under Custom Templates and click Next. The wizard asks you 
to Choose page properties.
3. Type Map in the Page title text box.
4. Type map in the Web address text box.
5. Leave the Show this page in the Navigation bar checkbox deselected.
6. Click Finish.
7. Office Live Small Business creates the new page and opens it in Page Editor in 
a new window.
8. Edit the text of the page title in Zone 2 to read Map.
9. Save your work and preview the website. It should look something like this:
10. Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.
11. Place the cursor below the horizontal rule and pull down the Module menu from 
the ribbon.

Improving the Presentation
[ 128 ]
12. Click on Map & directions. The Map & Directions dialog pops up. It has two tabs 
at the top: Location and Display Options. You're presently on the Location tab.
13. Select your country in the Country or region drop-down. Then type in the 
Address textbox.
14. Click on the Display Options tab.
15. Select the Use an interactive map checkbox.
16. Choose the Large radio button for the Size option.
17. Select the Show driving directions checkbox.
18. Select the Show address checkbox.
19. Click OK. The Map & Directions dialog closes. The page now displays a map 
of your neighborhood in Page Editor.
20. Save your work and preview the page. It should look something like this:

Chapter 7
[ 129 ]
21. Notice that the map module displays your address and a hyperlink for 
driving directions.
22. Click the Driving Directions hyperlink. The Microsoft Live Search website's driving 
directions page pops up in a new window with your address as the End address. A 
visitor can now enter her address as the Start address and get driving directions 
to your office.
23. Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.
What just happened?
You used Office Live Small Business's Map & directions module to display a map of your 
neighborhood on your website. And you didn't have to write a single line of program code 
to do it. Now that you've worked with a few modules, you'll begin to appreciate their power.
Have a go hero: customize the Map & directions display
You can customize the look and feel of the map to an extent. Right-click on the Map & 
directions module on your page and select Properties…. The Map & directions dialog that 
you just saw pops up again. Click on the Display Options tab. Now, try choosing a different 
combination of options. The module will customize the map display depending on the 
options you choose. Choose a combination that you like the best.
Trying out a couple of other modules
All of the modules that you see on the Module pull-down menu work more or less in the 
same fashion, only the settings differ from module to module. So, why not try out a couple 
of other modules? Let's give the Weather and the Stock list modules a try. Once you 
understand how modules work, you'll be able to use any of them with ease.
Time for action – trying out Weather and Stock modules
1. Go to Page Manager and create a new page. Call it the Test page.
You'll use this page as a guinea pig to experiment with new features. 
Of course, it goes without saying that you'll delete it before taking 
your site live.

Improving the Presentation
[ 130 ]
2. Add a Weather module to the Test page. The properties are quite straightforward:
Enter a ZIP code and click Search to see a list of cities in that 
ZIP code
Choose whether you want to show a four-day forecast; the default 
is one-day
Choose a unit for displaying the temperature
3. Save your work and preview the page.
4. Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.
5. Add a horizontal line below the Weather module.
Don't remember how to? See page 72.
6. Now, add a Stock list module to the Test page. It displays current prices for 
the stock symbols of your choice. Can you work with it by yourself? Good.
7. Save your work and preview the page.
8. When you have finished, close Page Editor and return to Page Manager.
Didn't I tell you that working with modules is a piece of cake? As we go about building your 
site, we'll use other modules as well. So, don't worry at this stage if you don't understand 
what some of them do.
What just happened?
You tried out two more modules: the Weather module and the Stock list module on the 
Test web page. The takeaway from this trial is that you work with all of Office Live Business's 
modules in essentially the same way. First, you drag-and-drop the module on your web page. 
Then, you right-click on it to bring up its properties dialog. Finally, you set the properties in 
the dialog.
Then, bam! Office Live Small Business does its magic behind-the-scenes and your page gets a 
slick new feature.

[ 131 ]
One of the advanced modules, the List Publisher module, gives you the ability 
to create a simple database and display the information in it on your web pages. 
A practical case that illustrates its use is beyond the scope of this book. But if 
you're interested, you can read a tutorial on it on this book's companion site at 
www.officeliveguide.com/listpublishermodule.aspx.
Creating hyperlinks
Earlier in the chapter, you created a page to display a map of your neighborhood on your 
site. The page looks quite nice. But the trouble is that there's no way to get to it unless you 
know its web address because it doesn't appear on either of the navigation menus. That's 
not really a desirable scheme of things. Wouldn't it be great if you could hyperlink to the 
Map page from the Contact Us page? That's precisely what you'll do next.
Time for action – creating a hyperlink to the Map page
1. Bring up the Contact Us page in Page Editor.
2. Add the words Map and directions just below your address in Zone 3 as shown:

Improving the Presentation
[ 132 ]
3. Select the words Map and directions with your mouse and then click the Hyperlink 
button in the Insert group on Page Editor's ribbon. The Insert a link dialog pops up 
as shown:
4. You want to link to another page on your own website. So, choose the Page on my 
site radio button in the box on the left. A list of all the pages on your site appears 
in the box on the right.
5. Click on Map in the list of pages. The entry gets highlighted.
6. Click OK. The Insert a link dialog closes and you return to Page Editor. Your new 
hyperlink now looks like this:

Chapter 7
[ 133 ]
7. Save your work and preview the page. When it comes up in the preview window, 
click on the hyperlink. It should take you to the Map page.
8. Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.
What just happened?
With this simple step, you just learned how to create a website out of stand-alone 
web pages.
Although your hyperlink linked to a page right on your site, it's just as easy to link to just 
about any web page anywhere on the Internet. To connect to a page on another website, 
simply select the Website radio button in the Insert a link dialog. A textbox for entering the 
address of the page you wish to link to, will appear in the box on the right. Enter the address 
and click OK.
Have a go hero – working with hyperlinks
Bring up the Test page that you created earlier while working with modules. Create the 
following hyperlinks:
A hyperlink that reads Go to Google and links to http://www.google.com
A hyperlink that reads E-mail me and links to your e-mail address 
Hint: select the E-mail address radio button in the Insert a link dialog.
Don't hyperlink to e-mail addresses
Although you now know how to hyperlink to e-mail addresses, I don't 
recommend doing so on your website unless you want to receive tons of spam. 
Use the Contact Us module instead, when you want to provide a way for visitors 
to contact you.
Displaying pictures
Okay, you now know how to use modules and create hyperlinks. Let's now move 
on to pictures.
Although pictures appear on a web page, they don't really reside there; they're stored in 
a folder on your web server. A reference to the location of the picture resides on the web 
page. When your browser receives a web page from a web server, it looks up the reference 
to a picture on the page and asks the web server to send the picture over. When it receives 
the picture, the browser positions it at the right place on the web page and then shows the 
web page to you.


Improving the Presentation
[ 134 ]
Pictures take up more space than text. Naturally, they take up more bandwidth. As a result, 
a page takes longer to display in a browser as you add more pictures to it. Pictures certainly 
make a web page more attractive, but use them judiciously. Don't add unnecessary or 
meaningless pictures to your pages.
The larger the dimensions of a picture, the larger its file size is likely to be. You can reduce 
the file size by cropping unnecessary details from a picture. Reducing the file size of a 
picture without sacrificing picture quality appreciably is called optimization. Office Live 
Small Business's picture uploader has an optimization tool built in (as you'll see shortly). 
All you have to do is select a checkbox while uploading a picture. Make use of the feature 
whenever you can.
Pictures from digital cameras, especially high-resolution ones, are really huge. If you use 
them on web pages without cropping or optimizing them, your pages will take a long time 
to load in a browser. Therefore, the rule of thumb is to crop and optimize pictures in a tool, 
such as Photoshop, before using it on your web pages.
Although the Web is virtually an endless repository of pictures, they are protected by 
copyright law. Therefore, it's not okay to download random pictures and use them on your 
website. In the same vein, linking to pictures on other websites without the permission of 
their owners is also not an honest practice. Doing so amounts to stealing bandwidth.
Office Live Small Business stores all pictures that appear on your website in a special folder 
called Image Gallery. The tools you'll require to:
upload pictures to the Image Gallery
add references to those pictures from your web pages
position the pictures where you want them on your web pages
are to be found, as you'd expect, in Page Editor.
Although this uploading-referencing-positioning business sounds really complicated, it's not. 
Let me show you how to do all of these tasks in a single stretch. Let's add a picture to my 
website. Presently, my Home page looks like this:

So, let's get cracking!

[ 136 ]
Time for action – displaying a picture
Because I don't know where you plan to add pictures to your website, I'll show you how to 
add one to mine. You can follow the same steps to add one to yours. Just use the appropriate 
page on your website as you work along with me.
1. Bring up the Home page in Page Editor.
2. Position the cursor where you want the picture to appear and click the Image 
button in the Insert group on Page Editor's ribbon. The Insert Image dialog opens, 
as shown:
3. Choose the My computer radio button in the Choose images from radio button 
group in the left-hand side box.
4. Click the Browse for an image…button in the right-hand side box. The Choose File 
to Upload dialog opens, as shown:

Chapter 7
[ 137 ]
5. Navigate to the folder on your computer that contains the picture you want to 
upload by selecting it in the Look in dropdown. All the pictures in the folder 
will appear in the dialog.
6. Click the picture you want to upload. Its name appears in the File name textbox.
7. Click Open.
8. Then Choose File to Upload dialog closes. And a new checkbox, Optimize my image, 
appears in the Insert Image dialog. Check it if it's not already selected. When you do 
so, Office Live Small Business automatically reduces its file size as best as possible 
so that it downloads faster.
9. Click Insert Image. The Insert Image dialog goes away and the picture appears 
where your cursor was, as shown:

[ 138 ]
10. The problem, however, is that it sticks out like a sore thumb on the web page. It 
would look much better with the text wrapped around it. To make that happen, 
right-click on the image. A little action menu pops up, as shown:
 
11. Click Float Left. The action menu goes away and the text now wraps around 
the picture, as shown:

Chapter 7

If you want to display the picture to the right of the paragraph, just click Float Right 
on the action menu.
12. Save your work and preview the page.
13. Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.
How do you delete a picture?
Elementary, my dear Watson! Just click on it and hit the delete key 
on your keyboard.
What just happened?
You just learned how to make your web pages more attractive by displaying pictures to 
complement the text on them. Judicious use of pictures can enhance the appeal of your 
site tremendously.
But don't overdo it. Too many pictures not only clutter web pages, they also make the 
pages sluggish.
And here's a word of caution about working with pictures: when you select a picture in 
the Page Editor, square handles appear around it. These handles can be used to resize the 
picture. Don't use them. Pictures resized in this manner can end up looking kind of fuzzy or 
distorted. Instead, create the pictures with the right dimensions before uploading them to 
your web pages.
Have a go hero – working with pictures
Were you worried that your site looked awful without any pictures on it? Now that you know 
how to manipulate pictures, go ahead and add them in appropriate spots.
And here's a challenge for you. I'm sure that you've seen pictures that work like hyperlinks. 
When you click on them, they lead you to another web page. Can you make a picture on 
your web page behave the same way?
Hint: Right-click on the picture. You should see a Create/edit hyperlink option on the menu 
that pops up.
Presenting data in tabular format
So far, you've learnt how to add text to web pages, how to create hyperlinks, how to display 
images, and how to use modules with pre-programmed features. I'll now show you how to 
present data in a tabular format.

Improving the Presentation
[ 140 ]
Time for action – creating a table
Just as with pictures, I don't know if or where you plan to present data using a table. So, 
we'll use the Test page that you created earlier. Once you know how to work with tables, 
you'll easily be able to add them to any of your pages.
1. Bring up the test page in Page Editor.
2. Position the cursor where you want to display the table and click the Table button in 
the Insert group on Page Editor's ribbon. The Create Table dialog opens, as shown 
in the next screenshot:
3. Select Generic style in the Select a table type box. Then, enter the number 
or columns and rows your table will have in the columns and rows textboxes, 
respectively. Don't worry if you don't know the exact number of rows or columns. 
You can always add or delete rows, as well as columns, from a table, even after you 
add it to a page, just as you would in a word processor.
Why should you use Generic style when the other styles look more colorful?

Chapter 7
[ 141 ]
There's a good reason. The colorful styles have colored backgrounds for alternate 
rows. That makes distinguishing between adjacent rows easier, as shown in the 
next image:
Service
1
Service
2
Service
3
Area
1
Area
2
Area
3
The problem, however, is that this color scheme breaks down if you add or delete 
rows from the table later on. That's because Office Live Small Business is not smart 
enough to adjust the backgrounds for alternate rows after you randomly hack at 
rows in the table. So, you might end up with tables like this:
Service
1
Service
2
Service
3
Area
1
Area
2
Area
2
Therefore, it's better to stick to the Generic style, which has white background 
for all rows.

4. Click OK. The Create Table dialog closes. A table now appears on the page where 
your cursor was, as shown:
5. Right-click on the table. An action menu appears, as shown:
www.allitebooks.com

Chapter 7
[ 143 ]
6. As you can see, it has commands to add rows, delete rows, merge rows and columns 
to create tables of virtually any internal shape. For example, the one below has 
three merged columns in Row 1 and two merged rows in Column 1, as shown:
This is an example of a table:
Column 1
Column 2
Column 3
Column 4

What just happened?
You learned how to present data in a tabular format on your web pages. You learned how to 
add a table to your web page and how to manipulate and format its rows and columns.
If you're used to working with tables on a word processor or a spread sheet, you'll find Office 
Live Small Business's tables to be quite straightforward. The only thing that you should keep 
in mind is that they are not as sophisticated as their counterparts in word processors and 
spreadsheets. So, displaying complex tables with subtotals or subheadings might prove 
somewhat tricky.

Improving the Presentation
[ 144 ]
Have a go hero – working with tables
Is the tabular format appropriate for presenting data on any of your web pages? A schedule 
of some sort, perhaps? Or a list of products and services or a thumbnail photo gallery? If so, 
now's the time to add those tables to your web pages.
Pop quiz 7.1
1.	 In Office Live Small Business's lingo, a module is:
A.	 A way to connect two web pages through a hyperlink
B.	 A pre-packaged mini-program that you can drop on a web page and configure it 
to perform a pre-determined task
C.	 A structure to represent tabular data on a web page
2.	 Although it is possible to optimize pictures in Image Uploader, it's not a very good 
idea because optimized pictures make web pages sluggish. True or false?
3.	 Downloading pictures from other people's websites and using them on yours 
amounts to stealing. Therefore, you should hyperlink to those pictures instead. 
Right or wrong?
Summary
In this chapter, you made your website a bit more presentable. You learned how to use some 
of Office Live Small Business's modules, how to connect pages with hyperlinks, and how to 
add images and tables to make your pages more attractive and easy to read. To recap:
Page Editor has several built-in mini-programs called modules. Modules allow you to 
add advanced features to your web pages without writing program code. You simply 
drop them on to a web page, set a few properties, and Office Live Small Business 
does the rest.
Hyperlinks are just as easy to create. You select the text that you want to turn into a 
hyperlink and specify the web address of the resource that you want to link to.
If you want to display pictures on your web pages, you must upload them to the 
Image Gallery. Once there, you can add them to any page and position them using 
the tools in Page Editor.
You can present data in a tabular format using tables that work more or less like the 
tables in a word processor.
By now, you should have a complete website, more or less. In the next three chapters, you'll 
tweak some settings, add some custom code, improve the quality of the text on your pages, 
and do all those little things that will make your site look more polished.

Fine-tuning the Design
Let's face it: although you've built a great website with Office Live Small 
Business, you've only had a limited amount of control over your site's design 
elements so far. You chose a theme, a style, and a color scheme back in 
Chapter 2. That's pretty much it!
In this chapter, you'll learn how to go beyond those basic settings and make your site prettier. 
Specifically, you'll learn how to:
Customize your site's header with a custom picture or your logo
Customize your site's color scheme
Use a custom stylesheet to fine-tune design elements
By the time you work your way through this chapter, your web pages will have a more 
professional look.
Customizing the header
Four design elements determine the look and feel of your site's header: logo, theme, style, 
and color scheme. When you set your site's design options back in Chapter 2, I advised you 
to tackle the logo later. But you did choose one of the available themes. You also chose a 
style that determines the layout of the header and a color scheme.
The extent to which you can control each of these four elements varies. At one end of the 
spectrum is the style. All you can do with it, is pick one of the available ones. The color 
scheme lies at the other end of the spectrum; you can customize it to your heart's content. 
The logo and the theme picture lie somewhere in the middle.




Fine-tuning the Design
[ 146 ]
Recall from Chapter 2 that your site's theme is simply the picture that appears in its header. 
You just chose one of the many available pictures when you set the theme in Site Designer. 
You'll be happy to know that you're not limited to the pictures that Office Live Small Business 
supplies; you can supply your own pictures.
But there's a catch. Office Live Small Business automatically resizes your picture to fit in 
its style-and-theme structure. It may even apply special effects to it. Therefore, not every 
picture is suitable for a custom theme.
Office Live Small Business can accommodate a logo in the header as well. But there's a catch 
with it as well; you can control the size and location of the logo to an extent, but you can't 
position it in the header precisely where you want it; Office Live Small Business does it for 
you and the result is not always pretty.
One option, of course, is to use your logo as the picture for your custom theme but that's not 
really such a good idea. Photographs or abstract pictures generally tolerate Office Live Small 
Business's adjustments pretty well, but most logos don't. That's because logos tend to have 
letters or proportionate figures that promptly get distorted with the resizing and application 
of special effects.
Fortunately, that's not the end of the road. You have several options for customizing your 
website's header despite these limitations. It's a good idea, therefore, to know what those 
options are and how to choose one that's right for your website.
Here are the options then:
A header with one of the pictures in a built-in theme
A plain header without a logo or a picture
A header with a picture of your choice
A header with both your logo and a picture
A header with only your logo in the header and no picture
Let's check these options one by one, so that you can choose the one that's most 
appropriate for your website.
While describing each of the options in detail below, I've provided general 
guidelines as to which option may be right for you, depending on your 
circumstances. But I suggest that you try out all the options possible 
before picking one.

A header with one of the built-in theme pictures
This option is appropriate for you if:
You don't have a logo for your business
You don't have a picture of your own to use in the header
You can live with one of the built-in theme pictures
If you've followed along with me so far in this book, this is the option that your site 
is presently using. But even if you're happy with it, I suggest you read through the 
remaining options. Who knows? You may like another one better.
A plain header without a logo or a picture
This option is appropriate for you if:
You don't have a logo for your business
You don't like the way that Office Live Small Business displays pictures in the header
You don't mind a relatively plain-looking header

What just happened?
You tried out a header without a logo for your website. As you can see, no logo doesn't mean 
no images; Office Live Small Business automatically displays abstract motifs in the header 
anyway. If you don't have a logo, this is one of the options that you should consider; Office 
Live Small Business often surprises you with attractive motifs.
A header with a picture of your choice
This option is appropriate for you if:
You don't like any of the built-in pictures
You have a picture that would go well in the header
You're willing to experiment with the modifications that Office Live Small Business 
automatically makes to the picture

You learnt how to build a custom theme for your site. Although "custom theme" is just a 
grand name for uploading a picture of your choice, it is the option that you should consider 
for your site's header if you don't have a logo. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't 
consider it even if you do have a logo. In the next section, you'll try out a header with 
both a logo and a picture.
A header with a logo and a picture
This option is appropriate for you if:
You already have a logo
You can find a picture that will go well alongside your logo in the header, either 
among those built-in, or in your own collection
Considering that you don't have much control over their positioning, you're willing 
to manipulate them with Adobe Photoshop, or another similar program, in order 
to fit them into the header

What just happened?
You cycled through the various ways of styling your website's header. As you've just 
experienced first-hand, styling the header is not an exact science. You may not be able to 
achieve the exact look that you had in mind but after some trial and error, there's a good 
chance that you'll hit upon a design you'll like.
Have a go hero – experiment with the header
If you're still not happy with the way the header looks, try this:
Gather all pictures that you don't mind seeing in the header and your logo and 
upload them to your custom theme.
If you have a logo, create several versions and sizes of it using Adobe Photoshop or 
your favorite graphics program, and upload them to your website.
Now, try out the various options again. When you encounter a design that would be 
acceptable to you except for some small detail, try using a different sized picture or logo. 
You can also try changing the face or the size of the font that you've set for the Site Name 
and Site Slogan.
Again, you may not achieve the exact look that you have in mind. But hey, there's 
much more to a website than just the header. So, get over it and choose one of those 
but-not-exactly-right designs that you like the best.



Fine-tuning the Design
[ 154 ]
Although I have discussed several ways of designing your website's header using the built-in 
design tools, there are a couple more that require a more sophisticated approach:
The first is to upload a picture that contains your site's name and slogan. I'll have to 
agree that the header can look much better than any that you can build using the 
built-in design tools.
However, there's a big downside to it. When you use such a picture, you have to get 
rid of the site name and site slogan in Site Designer. When you do so, search engines 
can't do a very good job of indexing your site and people are likely to have a harder 
time finding it using search engines. So, I don't recommend using it.
The second option is to build a custom header using some of Office Live Small 
Business's Advanced design features. You can see an example at www.acxede.com. 
In a way, this is really the best option for your site's header. Unfortunately, it's meant 
for professional designers who, Microsoft hopes, will build for-sale designs that 
you can buy off-the-shelf. It requires you to know a few technologies that are more 
appropriate for programs rather than small-business owners. Still, if you know 
XML and XSLT, I have a brief tutorial on building custom headers on the book's 
companion website.
To cut a long story short, I recommend that you forget about these two options and choose 
one of the options that you've tried out in this chapter.
Pop quiz 8.1

Customizing the color scheme
In Chapter 3, you chose a color scheme for your website by selecting one of Office Live Small 
Business's many built-in color schemes in the Site Designer as shown:
As we discussed then, these color schemes are designed by Microsoft's artists and they save 
you the trouble of coming up with your own. But, there are times when you're happy with a 
color scheme in general, although you'd be much happier if you could change a color or two. 
You'll be happy to know that Office Live Small Business gives you that ability.

Fine-tuning the Design
[ 156 ]
Time for action – customizing the color scheme
1. Go to Site Designer and pull down the Site color schemes menu by clicking on the 
Color button on the ribbon.
2. Click the Create custom color scheme option at the very bottom. The Edit custom 
color scheme dialog opens as shown:
3. The colors in the scheme are grouped by their function and appear on the left-hand 
side of the dialog. You can see all the colors in a group by clicking on the little 
+ and – signs before the group. The colors in the Header, for example, are Primary 
color and Secondary color. Select the color you want to change by expanding the 
appropriate group. An orange border appears around it to indicate the selection. 
I've selected Primary color for this example.
4. The color matrix on the right shows the colors that you have at your disposal. If 
none of these appeals to you, click the More colors button to reveal more colors.
5. Click on the color of your choice. It appears inside the orange border of the 
selected theme.
6. Click OK. The Edit custom color scheme dialog closes and you return to 
Site Designer.
7. Save your work and preview your website.

Chapter 8
[ 157 ]
What just happened?
You learnt how to customize individual colors in the color scheme that you've chosen for 
your site. Although many of the built-in color schemes are very well co-ordinated, many 
people I've talked to, often don't like some particular color in a scheme. In earlier versions 
of Office Live Small Business, you couldn't customize individual colors. So, you had to resort 
to trickery.
Now that the option is available, I recommend taking advantage of it to build just the right 
color palette for your website.
Using a custom stylesheet
A stylesheet is a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display the design 
elements on a web page. Normally, you'd have to create a stylesheet by hand when you 
build a website, but Office Live Small Business creates one for you automatically. As a 
matter of fact, almost every setting that you set in the Site Designer gets translated into 
the instructions that go in your site's stylesheet. When you set your site's default font to be 
Georgia, for example, Office Live Small Business created an instruction in your stylesheet.
Each such instruction is called a style. The good news is that you can tweak, or even 
over-ride, the styles that Office Live Small Business generates automatically for a more 
fine-grained control over your site's look and feel.
A complete course on stylesheets is way beyond the scope of this book, but I'll give you a 
taste of what you can do with custom styles.
Tweaking the navigation links
Building a website's navigation links manually is hard. Maintaining them over a period 
of time is even harder. Fortunately, Office Live Small Business builds and maintains the 
navigation links automatically for you behind-the-scenes, whenever you edit your web pages. 
But this convenience comes at a cost—you have very little control over how the links are 
displayed. Let me give you an example. 

Fine-tuning the Design
[ 158 ]
Look at the site's navigation in the following image when you have second-level web pages:
There are two problems with the navigation display I've highlighted:
The second-level navigation link, What's Office Live, is displayed in a bigger font 
than the first-level navigation link, About the Book. While there's nothing wrong 
with this arrangement per-se, the second-level links can be mistaken for page or 
paragraph headers depending on the font, theme, and style that you choose.
The second-level link's background is of the same color as the page background, not 
the same color as the rest of the second-level navigation bar. So, the link appears to 
be suspended in space and its purpose is not clear at first glance.
That's not all. There are a couple of other minor irritants that aren't obvious. Take a look at 
the behavior of a link in the following image when you hover your pointer over it:



Chapter 8
[ 159 ]
As you can see, an underline appears under the link. The trouble is that this behavior is not 
consistent. The underline appears only when a visitor has not visited the page. Once he 
does, the underline stops appearing during a hover. Therefore, some links on the navigation 
bar show the underline at any given time and others do not.
You may think  that I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill, but one of 
the main reasons that a professionally-developed website looks, well… 
professional, is that someone charging big bucks has paid close attention to 
such trivialities throughout the site.
While these are not show-stoppers, you're better off doing something about them if you 
want your site to look professional. So, here's the plan of action. You'll:
Use the font size for the first and second-level navigation links
Make the links behave consistently on hover; always underline only on hover
Make the background color of a selected second-level navigation link the same as 
the rest of the second-level navigation bar
The question, however, is: how do you do this? There are no settings for it in the Site 
Designer for sure. That's when your old friend, the stylesheet, comes to your rescue.
Recall that you used the stylesheet to set your site's width to 980 pixels back 
in Chapter 3. As you can see, your site's stylesheet gives you tremendous 
control over its look and feel.
Everything that you need to do here can be done with the stylesheet. But there's a small 
hitch! To remove the white background from the selected second-level navigation link, you 
must know the hexadecimal code for the background color of the second-level navigation 
bar. But, what exactly is a hexadecimal color code?
Every possible color has a unique numeric code. Although hexadecimal sounds like a really 
mean insult, it's not! It's just a number that uniquely identifies a specific color. It's written 
a bit differently though. In general, a hexadecimal color code begins with the pound sign(#) 
and has six more characters, each of which can range from 0-9 or a-f.
As a matter of fact, you don't have to know what a hexadecimal color code is. It's enough, 
for your purpose, to know what it looks like. The code for white is #ffffff, for example, and 
the code for black is #000000.
Hexadecimal color codes are not case-sensitive. So, #ffffff is the same thing as #FFFFFF, 
or #fFfFFf, for that matter. It's a good idea, however, to stick to all lowercase letters as I've 
done with the color codes in this chapter.




Fine-tuning the Design
[ 160 ]
Although six characters follow the # in hexadecimal color codes, there's a shorthand notation 
that allows you to specify only three characters instead of six under certain conditions. 
So, don't be alarmed if you see a color code such as #fff. But to avoid confusion, at least 
initially, I recommend using all six characters.
There are many graphics tools that can help you to find the color of a given pixel on your 
screen. If you're familiar with one, use it to find the color code for the background color 
of the secondary navigation bar.
If you're not familiar with a graphics tool, you may want to try one of these:
Internet Explorer 8 has a built-in color picker tool that appears as a little floating dialog. 
It has a pointer that looks like an ink dropper. The color of the pixel at the pointer and its 
color code appear in the floating window. It looks something like this:
Complete instructions for using the color picker to find the code for a color are at 
http://www.officeliveguide.com/colorpicker.aspx. If you use a Windows 
computer, there's a great little freeware utility called Pixie. Like Internet Explorer 8's color 
picker, it too appears as a floating window, that contains the same information as shown 
in the following screenshot:

Chapter 8

Complete instructions for getting Pixie and using it to find the code for a color 
are at http://www.officeliveguide.com/colorpicker.aspx.
You'll use the graphics tool of your choice in the following activity.

just revisited the Style Sheet dialog after first encountering it in Chapter 3,

say open the Style Sheet dialog and type such and such code, instead of 
repeating the instructions for opening it every time.

[ 164 ]
What just happened?
You just addressed all of the little issues about your website's navigation and polished it up.
But what if you want to do only a part of what I suggested? No problem. I've arranged the 
code in three visual chunks. Let's see what each chunk does:
The first chunk makes the font size for all navigation links the same:
.MSC_SecondaryNavLink, .MSC_SecondaryNavLink:hover, 
.MSC_SecondaryNavLink:visited, .MSC_SecondaryNavLink-On, 
.MSC_SecondaryNavLink-On:hover, .MSC_SecondaryNavLink-On:visited 
{ font-size:12px;}
If you don't want to do this on your website, bring up the Style Sheet dialog and 
delete this chunk.
The second chunk makes the underlining on hover for the primary 
navigation consistent:
.MSC_PrimaryNavLink:visited:hover, .MSC_SecondaryNavLink:visited:
hover { font-size:12px; text-decoration:underline; }
If you don't want to do this on your website, bring up the Style Sheet dialog and 
delete this chunk.
The third chunk makes the underlining on hover for the secondary navigation 
consistent:
.MSC_SecondaryNavLink-On, .MSC_SecondaryNavLink-On:visited, 
.MSC_SecondaryNavLinkFrame-On 
{background: #XXXXXX}
If you don't want to do this on your website, bring up the Style Sheet dialog and 
delete this chunk.
I've arranged the code above in a way that a chunk of code achieves a single 
objective. With this arrangement, you can simply ignore a chunk of code if you 
choose not to implement something on your website.
Just to let you know, this is not the most efficient way of working with a 
stylesheet. It 
results in some unnecessary duplication of code and increases the size of 
the stylesheet, which is not really a good thing. But in some circumstances, 
understandable code is preferable to efficient, or even clever code. When you're 
not a stylesheet guru, you're 
in one of those circumstances.
But if, by any chance, you know your way around styles, feel free to use the class 
and instance identifiers in the code to rearrange it in anyway that you want to. 
And if you don't really know what that means, stick to my version of the code.

3. Save your work and preview your website. Every picture on your site should 
now have a border.
4. Close the preview window and return to Site Designer.
What just happened?
You styled the pictures on your website to display a pretty border around them. Mind you, 
the style adds a border to all pictures on the site, not just one.
What if I want a border around only some of the pictures?
With this technique, it's all-or-nothing. To display or remove a border around 
a single picture, you'll need to ability to manipulate styles on that picture. 
Unfortunately, Office Live Small Business doesn't offer you the ability to do so.
There certainly are ways to achieve that effect if push comes to shove, but 
none of them are fool-proof. There're either too complex for beginners or 
have unintended side effects.
Have a go hero – play with styles
Does the code that I've presented so far look esoteric to you? It just might. But come to think 
of it, it's not all that complex. Of course, there are rules that you must abide by, but you can 
take a chance and tweak it a bit. Take the code that you just used, for example:
#IWS_WH_Elem_Content img {border: 4px solid #cccccc; padding: 5px;}
When working with styles in Office Live Small Business, you're better off not touching 
anything outside the braces. So, let's concentrate on the stuff inside them:
border: 4px solid #cccccc; padding: 5px;
Translated into English, it says:
Draw a solid border, 4 pixels thick, in the color represented by the code #cccccc. And while 
you're at it, also pad the picture with 5 pixels of empty space on all sides so that the border 
is separated from the picture.
It should now be easy enough for you to customize the properties of the border. Want 
to make it thicker or thinner? Change 4 to whatever number of pixels you want. Want to 
change the color? Change #cccccc to your favourite color. The padding too much or too little 
for your liking? Change 5 to whatever number of pixels you want it to be.
By the way, I've chosen #cccccc as the border's color because it's a shade of grey that goes 
with most pictures. But that's my opinion. If you don't like it, try making it the same as the 
background of your site's header.

Fine-tuning the Design
[ 168 ]
Styling horizontal rules
When you created your site template, you added a horizontal line under the page header. 
These lines are called horizontal rules in HTML. The way browsers display horizontal rules, 
hr in short, is not always pretty. Internet Explorer, for example, displays it as a three-
dimensional grey line. You can make it look prettier by assigning a color to it.
There's no hard and fast rule as to what the color should be, but it's often a good idea to 
choose one of the colors in your site's color scheme. You can get the code for that color by 
using your favorite color picker.
Time for action – styling the horizontal rules
1. Open the Style Sheet dialog.
2. Type the following code below what's already there:
hr { color: #XXXXXX; }
I've posted the code at http://www.officeliveguide.com/
customstyles.aspx if you want to just copy and paste it.
3. Carefully replace #XXXXXX with the color code of your choice. For my 
website, it is #333399, which is what you see on the companion website.
4. Save your work and preview your website. Every horizontal rule on your site 
should now have the color that you assigned rather than the default grey.
5. Close the preview window and return to Site Designer.
You can do quite a few little things with styles. You can change the 
color of navigation links, for example, or change the way that bullets 
in a bulleted list look. I've posted a list at http://www.officeliveguide.
com/customstyles.aspx. I'll be updating it from time to time. So, I 
encourage you to look it up once in a while.
What just happened?
You styled the horizontal rules on your website. They will now appear as pretty solid lines of 
the color of your choice, instead of their default grey. As with the pictures, the style changes 
the color of all horizontal rules on the site; not just one.

Summary
In this chapter, you learnt how to fine-tune several of your site's design elements. After 
working through it, you should find Office Live Small Business's design options a lot less 
restrictive than they initially appear. To recap:
Every Office Live Small Business theme has a set of pictures. One of them appears 
in your site's header. If you don't like any of them, you can supply your own.
Displaying a logo in your website's header is a bit tricky. Office Live Small Business 
has limited options for positioning it. Therefore, placing it at precisely a certain 
location in the header is hard. But even if none of the available styles displays it 
to your liking, you can control its display, somewhat, by adjusting its size.
You may not be able to get your site's header to look exactly as you want it to. But 
with sufficient trial and error, you should be able to make it look acceptably pretty.
You can customize the color scheme that Office Live Small Business applies to your 
site using a built-in color picker tool.
Although Office Live Small Business automatically generates a stylesheet for your 
website, you can over-ride styles for some of the elements. I showed you how to 
use styles to tweak your site's navigation links, decorate pictures on your site with 
borders, and style horizontal rules. But that's not all; you can do much more. I've 
created a more comprehensive list on this book's companion site that you can use 
to tweak your site's stylesheet even more.
Although you focused on your site's design elements in this chapter, its content is as 
important to its ultimate success as its design, if not more. In the next chapter, you'll 
focus on fine-tuning the content—for search engines as well as people.

Venturing Beyond the Basics
Office Live Small Business is the perfect site-building tool for you if you don't 
know (or don't want to learn) HTML, the language of web pages. And I'm sure 
that you'll agree that it does a pretty decent job of it. But after your site is 
functionally complete, it's only natural that you'd want to tweak little things 
here and there; move the text on some page a wee bit to the left, for example, 
or move a picture up by a pixel or two, so as to align it with the neighboring 
text. The trouble, though, is that Office Live Small Business doesn't allow such 
tweaks. You can't touch the HTML that it generates.
But what if you're not very happy with this state of affairs? Don't worry! Office Live Small 
Business has it covered. It has two advanced features that give you a fine-grained control 
over the look and feel of your web pages as follows:
Page Editor's HTML modules in which you can write your own HTML markup
Off-the-shelf Solutions, which render customized web pages within Office Live 
Small Business's framework
In this chapter, you'll explore both these advanced options. Here's what you'll do:
Add an HTML module to your page.
Write HTML in the HTML module. Chances are that you don't know a lot about 
HTML. So, you'll take a crash course on a small subset of HTML that will help you 
to get started with writing your own markup, if you so desire.
Perform some common page-building tasks such as embedding flash movies, PayPal 
buttons, and other such external content in your web pages using the HTML module.
Download and install an FAQ solution that renders a customized FAQ page.
Let's get started then.

About HTML modules
An HTML module is a little editor that you can plop on to your page in the Page Editor, just 
like any other module. It holds HTML markup. With an HTML module, you can construct a 
web page with raw HTML markup just as the pros do.
If you're conversant with HTML, the idea of having a fine-grained control over your HTML is 
likely to pump you up. And yet, I don't recommend using HTML modules.
You read that right: I don't recommend using HTML modules. Why? Because Office Live 
Small Business stores the markup in HTML modules separate from the page. When a 
person requests your page from his/her browser, Office Live Small Business fetches the 
separately-stored markup and embeds it into the rest of the page dynamically. The problem 
is that it does the embedding using something called frames, which happen to be little 
windows on a web page that display content that doesn't actually reside on that page.
Why is this problematic? Because search engines can't index the content that doesn't 
physically reside on your web page. Therefore, people can't find it using search engines. 
Frankly, I don't see a point in building a site that people can't find. So, I strongly discourage 
you to build your entire site with HTML modules.
Another reason to avoid HTML modules is that they load the content dynamically using 
JavaScript. This can be an excruciatingly slow process that can delay the loading of a page 
in a user's browser. In fact, such dynamically loaded pages often tend to time out.
Having said that, there are situations where they can come in handy. You may not care, for 
example, whether search engines index a certain page on your site, but you'd like to have 
great control over how that page looks. Or you may want to embed a YouTube video on your 
page, which search engines don't index any way. It's a good idea, therefore, to learn how to 
use the HTML module and that's what you'll do in this section.
The first step, of course, is to add an HTML module to one of your pages. Let's use the Test 
page that you created in Chapter 7.
Time for action – adding an HTML module to your page
1. Bring up the Test page in Page Editor.
2. Place the cursor where you want to add the module.

Chapter 9
[ 173 ]
3. Click the Module button in the Insert group on the Page Editor's ribbon. Select 
HTML from the Modules menu that drops down. The HTML dialog pops up, 
as shown: 


The dialog contains a mini-editor where you can type your HTML markup. The 
Images and Hyperlink buttons just above the editor box help you add markup for 
embedding pictures and hyperlinks. As this is just a Test page, I'll type some simple 
HTML to show you how the module really works. I suggest that you do the same.
4. Type the following markup in the mini-editor:
<strong>Welcome to my web site.</strong>
5. Click OK. The HTML dialog closes and you return to Page Editor, which renders 
the HTML you just typed as any browser would.

[ 174 ]
6. Preview your website. The page should now look like this:
7. Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.
8. Editing your markup is equally easy. Right-click on the HTML module in Page Editor. 
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in the next image:
9. Choose Properties…. the HTML dialog opens again with your markup in it. 
Change the markup to:
<strong>Welcome</strong> to my web site.

Chapter 9
[ 175 ]
You'll be working with the HTML module a few more times in this chapter. From 
now on, I'll just say "Open the HTML module's HTML dialog" when I want you to 
edit a module's markup.
10. Click OK. The HTML dialog closes and you return to Page Editor.
11. Preview your website. The page should now display only the word Welcome in 
bold letters.
12. Close the preview window and return to Page Editor.
What just happened?
You added an HTML module to a web page and typed some basic HTML in it.
Before this exercise, you simply typed text on to your web pages as you would in a word 
processor, and Office Live Small Business took care of converting it to HTML. With an HTML 
module, you're writing your own HTML. Naturally, you'll have a more fine-grained control 
over how you want it to appear. But to make use of this newfound power, you must know 
HTML. So, let me give you a brief tutorial on it.
There are several hundred excellent HTML tutorials on the Web (not to mention several 
thousand lousy ones). If you take into account the hundreds of books on the subject, you'd 
think that everything that needs to be said about HTML has, perhaps, already been said. 
Many times over, at that.
Yet, I have good reason to write this brief tutorial: writing HTML for Office Live Small 
Business web pages is an entirely different beast.
Why? Because:
You don't write an entire HTML document with Office Live Small Business's design 
tools. All you do is write little chunks of HTML in HTML modules placed strategically 
on your web pages. Office Live Small Business's Page Editor combines the basic 
framework of your web page with these chunks of HTML and presents a finished 
web page to your browser.
An HTML module doesn't store the HTML you type verbatim. It encodes what you 
type and lets the browser handle the decoding. Therefore, the page may not look 
exactly as you intend it to, after the browser renders it.
The page on which you drop an HTML module already has a Cascaded Style Sheet 
(CSS) associated with it. You may be able to take advantage of the fact and minimize 
manual formatting.

Therefore, you don't have to be an HTML guru to use Office Live Small Business's HTML 
module. All you need to know is a small subset of HTML that leverages the web page's 
features. This tutorial introduces that subset. It won't make you a fully-fledged web designer, 
but it will arm you with enough knowledge to impress unsuspecting folks at cocktail parties.
HTML 101
Contrary to what many people believe, HTML is not a programming language. It's a markup 
language. Unlike programming languages, it doesn't contain step-by-step instructions that 
tell a computer what to do. Instead, it contains instructions that tell a browser how to format 
and decorate web page content.
The instructions are written as Tags. Tags are keywords that reside within a pair of angular 
brackets (< and >). Typically, you enclose some content between a pair of tags.
For example, the <strong> and </strong> in the markup you just tried out is tag pair. The 
pair consists of an opening tag and a closing tag. The difference between an opening tag and 
the corresponding closing tag is usually a forward slash (/). So, <strong> is the opening tag 
and </strong > is the corresponding closing tag. If you want to make some text bold, you 
enclose it between <strong> and </strong> tags like this:
This is some text. <strong>This sentence is bold.</strong> This one 
isn't.
And the browser displays it like this:

Chapter 9
[ 177 ]
Most HTML tags are paired like the <strong> tag. But some are not. An example is the 
<br /> tag. It adds a line break to your text like this:
This is some text. <br /> This is some more text but it's on the next 
line.
And the browser displays it like this:
The character < opens the tag and the character sequence /> closes it. Such tags that close 
themselves without corresponding closing tags are called self-closing tags. It's not mandatory 
to close the self-closing tags. So, if you write <br> instead of <br />, your page will work 
just fine. But I recommend closing all tags. I'll do so in this tutorial and so will you.
Notice, by the way, that simply typing the second line of text on a new line in the editor 
doesn't make the text appear on the next line (go ahead, try it!). It's the <br /> tag that 
actually does the trick and displays the subsequent text on the next line, although you typed 
it as a single line in the editor. In other words, the tags determine the appearance of your 
web page, not how you type the text in the editor.
HTML is not case sensitive. So, you can write a <br /> tag as <BR />, <Br />, or even 
<bR />, if you insist, and your page won't look any different. But, I strongly advise against 
it. As a matter of convention, I recommend sticking to lowercase letters, as I've done 
throughout this tutorial.
That's just about all the dirt that you really need to know on HTML. There's more, 
of course, but as this is not a complete HTML tutorial, we'll look into the finer details 
on a need-to-know basis. So, let's proceed to some useful HTML tags.

Venturing Beyond the Basics
[ 178 ]
Working with paragraphs
Most writing is structured as a collection of paragraphs. While writing HTML, you must 
enclose the text in a paragraph between the <p> and </p> tag pair like this:
<p>This is the first paragraph. It has this filler text to make it 
rather long so that it looks like a real paragraph.</p><p>Here is the 
second paragraph.</p>
And the browser renders it like this:
As you can see, there's no space between the paragraphs in the markup. But the <p></p> 
tag pair automatically introduces breaks that makes the text look like paragraphs in 
the browser.
Because of a bug in the HTML module, it doesn't seem to treat <p> and 
</p> tags correctly. As a result, you don't see intended paragraph breaks in 
the browser. In the picture above, I sneaked in our old friend, the <br /> tag, 
between the two paragraphs as in <p>...</p> <br /> <p>...</p>.
You may have to resort to this workaround as well. But remember that if 
Microsoft fixes the bug, you'll get an extra line-break on your page.
Also, remember that you can add text to an HTML module without the 
paragraph tag pair; you can use <br /> tags instead, for example, where you 
want a break in text. However, I recommend that you enclose all of your text in 
paragraph tags. If you don't, Office Live Small Business's stylesheets may hijack 
the formatting of your text. Not enclosing text in paragraphs is one of the main 
reasons why text on so many web pages is misaligned and displayed in the 
wrong font.

Chapter 9
[ 179 ]
Working with horizontal rules
Back in Chapter 5, I introduced the horizontal line, which you can draw across your web page 
simply by clicking the Horizontal line button on Page Editor's ribbon. To draw a similar line 
while working with the HTML module, you'll need—you guessed it—a tag! Web designers 
call a horizontal line a horizontal rule and so the corresponding tag is the <hr /> tag, like 
the <br /> tag, the <hr /> tag. Simply type <hr /> wherever you want a horizontal line 
to appear. If you want it to appear between the two paragraphs in the previous example, 
your markup will look like this:
<p>This is the first paragraph. It has this filler text to make it 
rather long so that it looks like a real paragraph.</p><hr /><p>Here 
is the second paragraph.</p>
And your page will appear in the browser like this:
Working with headings
Headings are an important part of the text. Books, for example, use headings with varying 
importance. The more important a heading, the bigger its font size is. This scheme makes 
it easy for readers to quickly grasp the scope of topics and sub-topics within the text.
HTML uses a similar scheme. There are six levels of heading tag pairs in HTML that you can 
put around heading text like this:
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

Venturing Beyond the Basics
[ 180 ]
Text included between beginning and ending tags at each level looks like this:
As you can see, <h1> has the largest font size. Naturally, it's used for the most important 
heading on a web page. As the number inside the tag increases, its font size decreases. 
So, among headings, <h6> has the smallest font size.
What if you need more than six levels of headings? Well, you shouldn't; a six 
level deep topic hierarchy is deep enough for most people to keep track of. If you 
have seven or more levels, you should seriously consider rewriting your text.
Generally, it's a good idea to start a page with the <h1> tag. It identifies the most important 
heading on the page, and it is used by search engines to take an educated guess at what 
the page is all about. So, a good convention to follow is to have only one <h1> tag on every 
web page.
But, you're better off flouting this convention when working with Office Live Small Business. 
Why? Because you don't write entire web pages in HTML modules; you just write individual 
chunks of HTML. Office Live Small Business automatically adds a <h1></h1> tag pair 
to your web pages and places the title of your site between them. Similarly, it uses the 
<h2></h2> tag pair for your site's tag line. So, you're better off starting with a <h3> tag 
in every HTML module on a web page. That way, you won't drive Google's spider nuts by 
forcing it to wrestle with 23 <h1> tags on a single web page.

Chapter 9
[ 181 ]
When you need a sub-heading on the page, you should use the next tag down 
in the hierarchy; in our example, <h4>. Avoid the temptation to skip levels. 
Don't jump from <h3> to <h6>, for example. And it's a good idea to use 
these heading tags. Don't just write plain text with large fonts instead.
Working with hyperlinks
The HTML tags that you've seen so far merely alter the appearance of the text that they 
enclose. They're quite easy to work with. Just enclose some text between them and they 
alter its appearance. But all HTML is not that straightforward. You need more complex 
markup to perform more complex tasks.
Creating a hyperlink, for example, requires slightly more involved markup. It's not rocket 
science, but even a small mistake in the markup can leave your hyperlink broken. To prevent 
you from inadvertently creating broken hyperlinks, the HTML module's mini-editor lends 
you a helping hand. It lets you create the markup precisely in the same manner as you did 
outside of it.
Let's say you want to build a web page using an HTML module, which looks like this:
The quest﻿ion is, how do you write the markup for the Contact Us link? Well, I could easily tell 
you that the markup should look like this:
<a href="/contactus.aspx">contact us</a>

Venturing Beyond the Basics
[ 182 ]
But as you can see, I'd have to give you a good amount of explanation as to what href means 
and why it's enclosed within a pair of double quotes. Then, some of you may want to know 
what happens if you omit the double quotes. So, one thing would lead to another and you 
would find yourself spending all of your time learning the nuances of HTML, rather than 
doing whatever it is that you do for a living.
So, the HTML module has a feature that writes the markup for you. Let me walk you 
through it.
Time for action – generating the markup for a hyperlink
1. Bring up the Test page in Page Editor. It should have the HTML module that you 
added just a short while ago. (Add another one if it isn't there any more.)
2. Open its HTML dialog. Clear any markup that might already be there and type:
<p>Questions? Please contact us.</p>
3. Select the text contact us and click the Hyperlink button just above the mini-editor.
4. The Insert a link dialog opens. You've seen this dialog before. It pops up every time 
you insert a hyperlink outside of the HTML module using the Hyperlink button on 
Page Editor's ribbon.
5. Choose the Page on my site radio button in its left pane. A list of all the pages 
on your site appears in the right pane, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 9
[ 183 ]
6. Select your contact page and click OK. The Insert a link 
dialog closes and you return to the HTML dialog.
7. Notice that the text in the editor now looks like this:
Questions? Please <a href="/contactus.aspx" >contact us</a>.
As you can see, Office Live Small Business added the necessary markup for you.
8. Click OK to close the HTML dialog and return to Page Editor.
9. Preview your site and confirm that the hyperlink works as intended.
What just happened?
The HTML module generated HTML markup for you at the click of a button! Come to think of 
it, this is exactly how Office Live Small Business works behind-the-scenes. When you create 
a hyperlink, add a horizontal line, or format pretty much any text in Page Editor, it generates 
the necessary HTML markup so that you don't have to learn HTML. The only difference here 
is that you actually get to see the markup.
Working with pictures
You might have noticed that in the HTML dialog, there's an Images button right next to 
the Hyperlink button that you just used to magically generate the hyperlink markup. Any 
guesses what that's for? Yes, it generates the markup necessary to display a picture on 
your web page.
As is the case with the Hyperlink button, the Images button works exactly the same way 
within the HTML module as it does outside of it.
Have a go hero – experiment with a picture's HTML markup
You've used the Images button in Chapter 7 to insert images on to your web pages. Can you 
now generate the markup in the HTML module to display a picture?
Working with external content
Some of the most common elements on many websites don't actually reside on those 
websites. Take a YouTube video, for example, a blog hosted at Blogger, or even an Amazon 
aStore. People commonly display such elements from external services on their web pages. 
How do you do that?

Venturing Beyond the Basics
[ 184 ]
Well, all of these services provide you with HTML markup that is specific to that content 
and ask you to paste it on to your web page. On your Office Live Small Business website, 
you must paste it into an HTML module.
Why can't I paste it on the page itself?
Because what you're pasting is markup, not text. If you paste a YouTube video's 
markup in Page Editor, the web page will display the markup, not the video.
To give you an example, I created a small video clip and uploaded it to YouTube. To display it 
on my web page, YouTube informs me that I must use the following markup:
<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" 
value="http://www.youtube.com/v/j5HoGG767MQ&hl=en&fs=1&"></
param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param 
name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://
www.youtube.com/v/j5HoGG767MQ&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-
shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" 
width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
To display this clip on my web page, all I have to do is to paste this markup in an HTML 
module on my page. I did so, and here's what my page looks like:

Chapter 9
[ 185 ]
And while we're on the subject, you can also embed JavaScript into an HTML module. Some 
services, such as Google's AdSense advertising service, require you to embed JavaScript code, 
as opposed to HTML markup, into your web pages. HTML modules let you do that seamlessly.
Although AdSense has a cult following, advertisements make sense only on news 
portals, online magazines, and such. They don't have a place on small-business 
websites. Displaying AdSense advertisements on your small-business websites is 
like displaying your competitor's billboard in your office. Don't do it!
Have a go hero – experiment with a picture's HTML markup
Do you have something hosted at a service such as YouTube, Amazon, or Blogger that you'd 
like to display on your web page? If so, give it a shot. Simply plop an HTML module on the 
page on which you want the content to appear, copy the markup from the service's website, 
and paste it into the HTML module.
Don't have any such hosted content? You can try it out using my YouTube video clip. You can 
copy the code from YouTube's site.
1.	 Point your browser at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5HoGG767MQ 
as shown:
2.	 Copy the code in the little Embed box on the right and paste it in your 
HTML module.

Most services will provide you the markup in a similar fashion.
As I mentioned before, you can embed all sorts of external content 
using HTML modules. Go to this book's companion website at

to see more examples.

Further customization with solutions
Now that you've seen the power of HTML modules, let me introduce you to yet another way 
of taking control of your web pages: solutions.
The common denominator of everything that you've done so far in Site Designer and Page 
Editor is that you created every page on your site using Office Live Small Business's page 
templates. Then, you just manipulated the content on the page.
But is it possible to build entire web pages outside of your website and then simply stick 
them in to your website? It certainly is. Such a web page, or a set of web pages packaged 
together as a unit, is called a solution in Office Live Small Business's parlance.
You can't, however, take any random web page and make it a part of your website. You must 
build one from scratch and you must follow a complex list of rules while building it, so that it 
can function within Office Live Small Business's framework. That, obviously, is not an item on 
the to-do list of small-business owners. You'd need hard-core programmers for the job.

Chapter 9
[ 187 ]
Microsoft developed the Office Live Small Business platform as an extensible platform for 
independent software vendors to build solutions that would help small-business owners 
take all the aspects of their businesses online. One vendor may build a payroll system on 
the platform, for example, and another may build an inventory control system. Although 
there aren't all that many solutions out there as yet, you can expect to see more of them in 
the future. Microsoft hopes that vendors will create such solutions for various aspects of a 
business that you'll buy off-the-shelf and drop on to your web pages.
To give you a taste of the punch that solutions can pack, I've created a simple FAQ system. 
Office Live Small Business's FAQ page template leaves much to be desired. You can't 
have more than ten questions, for example, and it's very easy to mess up its formatting 
irreversibly. My FAQ system, called AcxedeFAQ, fixes these problems. You can create as 
many questions and answers as you want, and they always retain their formatting. All 
you have to do to use it, is download it and install it on your website. You'll find the 
downloadable package and complete instructions on installing and using AcxedeFAQ 
at http://www.officeliveguide.com/AcxedeFAQ.aspx.
Summary
In this chapter, you learnt that Office Live Small Business lets you go beyond its point-and-
click tools and lets you customize the HTML markup of your web pages. It also allows you 
to install compatible web pages developed by third-party vendors. To recap:
The HTML module is just another module in Page Editor, but it's unique in that it 
lets you actually write HTML markup like the pros do.
You can write just about any valid HTML markup in an HTML module.
I gave you a brief tutorial on HTML that's very specific to what you can expect to 
do with an HTML module. Of course, it's just a start. If you're an advanced HTML 
author, you can write as complex a markup as you want.
HTML modules can also take scripts that let you embed external content such as 
blogs, videos, and even advertisements on your web pages.
Although HTML modules appear to be the solution to all your site customization 
problems, you should use them only occasionally because search engines can't 
index content within them.
Solutions are ready-made add-ons that you can install on your website. There aren't 
all that many of them out there as yet, but you can expect more in the future.
If you've followed along with me so far, congratulations! By now, you should have an 
almost-finished website and a good many ideas about how to finish it. I suggest that you 
implement all of your ideas and finish building your website before going on to the next 
chapter, in which I'll show you how you can help search engines index your site better 
so that people can find it easily.

Optimizing for Search Engines
All right, you've built this terrific website. But what good is it if nobody can find 
it? Not much, you'll agree. So, the question that arises next is: how do you make 
your site "findable"?
And the answer is: by making your website friendlier to search engines.
The process of making your website friendlier to search engines is called Search 
Engine Optimization, or SEO in short.
As it happens, there are more myths in the world of SEO than there are facts. In this chapter, 
I'll separate the wheat from the chaff. You'll learn:
What SEO really is
What it isn't
What you can do to optimize your web pages for search engines
What is SEO?
Search engines use automated little programs, called bots or spiders, to scan the content of 
web pages and break it down into relevant words and phrases. Then, they add those words 
and phrases to an index. This process is called indexing. Bots routinely index millions of web 
pages and build massive indexes.
When a person uses a search engine to find a word or a phrase, the search engine looks up 
its index and generates a list of web pages on which the word or the phrase resides. The 
entries in this list are called search results. If the person searches for a word or a phrase, 
which is present on one of your web pages, it could appear in his search results.


Optimizing for Search Engines
[ 190 ]
However, the same words and phrases on your web pages are likely to be present on 
hundreds of thousands of pages on other websites as well. A search engine has to take an 
educated guess at which of those pages match the context of a user's query better than 
others and list them in the search results, in the order of their relevance. The position of 
your web page in relation to those of others among a set of search results is called your 
page's search engine position. Naturally, you'd want your web pages to be positioned among 
the first few results of a search. After all, nobody really has the patience to scroll down to 
entry number 21,497.
The problem, however, is that all those thousands of other pages are also vying for the 
same prime spots among the first few results of a user's query. So, how can you influence 
a search engine to list your web pages at the top of its search results at the expense of 
thousands of others?
A search engine determines the position of a web page in its results using a complex, and 
usually proprietary, formula called a search algorithm. The search algorithm is based on a 
diverse set of variables. Some of these variables are either published or easily guessed. 
Others are proprietary and esoteric. If you structure your web pages to conform to the 
way in which a search engine uses these variables, they are likely to achieve a better 
search engine position.
That, in essence, is the subject matter of SEO.
What SEO is not
With all this talk of influencing search engines, you might think that SEO is all about 
manipulating search engines into giving your web pages a bit more importance than 
they really deserve.
That's just not true!
You read that right. There's absolutely no sure-fire way of tricking search engines into 
favoring �������������������������������������������������������������������������������
 your web pages over those of others. Therefore, SEO is not some clever scheme 
to trick search engines or an insidious exploit of their deeply guarded secrets to your 
advantage. There are no magic tricks, no secrets, and no silver bullets.

Chapter 10
[ 191 ]
There's no dearth of shady outfits which lead you into believing that they can 
do something special to make your site appear at the top of all search results 
in exchange for a small fortune, usually. In fact, there's a budding cottage 
industry built around SEO that's rivalled only by the mature cottage industry 
for preparing your kid to get into an Ivy League college. Unfortunately, they 
are both founded on myths, old wives' tales, and urban legends. And just 
for the record, getting your kid in to an Ivy League college might actually 
be easier.
Before you let a SEO service separate you from your money, consider this 
question: if every website-owner in your line of business pays a few bucks to 
monitor and improve his/her site's search-result positioning, whose site will 
actually show up at the top? You be the judge.
Optimizing your web pages
What exactly is SEO then? Simply put, SEO is the process of streamlining your web pages 
so that search engines can index them accurately and make informed decisions about their 
positioning. Optimizing your site is as easy as following a list of guidelines, a list of DOs and 
DON'Ts if you will, for building your web pages. When everybody follows these guidelines, 
search engines can do a better job of indexing web pages and presenting more meaningful 
results to users.
To that end, here's a list of specific DOs and DON'Ts:
Do comply with web standards
In a nutshell, web standards are sets of guidelines or specifications for developing web pages 
that will display correctly and provide all the intended functionality regardless of a user's 
location, hardware, operating system, browser, or disability.
Standards exist for almost every aspect of web development. HTML standards, for example, 
specify how to write correct HTML. Similarly, JavaScript standards specify how to write 
browser-independent scripts and accessibility guidelines specify how to make content 
available to people with varying preferences or physical abilities.
If you were to build a website without the help of Office Live Small Business's tools, you'd 
have to learn about all these standards. But because the tools do all of the heavy lifting for 
you, you don't have to. Now, that's both good and bad; good because you don't have to 
wrestle with all of those excruciating details and bad because you're forced to accept the 
markup that the tools generate, whether it complies with the standards or not.

Optimizing for Search Engines
[ 192 ]
You're not going to like what I'm about to say: the markup that Office Live Small Business 
generates for you isn't quite standards-compliant. But you can minimize the impact of 
non-standard markup if you use Office Live Small Business's tools wisely, as outlined in 
the guidelines below.
Do avoid HTML modules
The HTML module that you met in Chapter 9 is the main culprit that exacerbates non-standard 
markup on your web pages. True, you can customize the look and feel of your pages to 
your heart's content with HTML modules, but Office Live Small Business has to jump hoops 
to accommodate all of your customizations and make them compatible with the various 
browsers, computers, and operating systems out there. It also has to protect the content in 
your HTML modules to prevent the bad guys from defacing your site. The result is bloated, 
non-standard markup.
But don't panic! Just because you have a few HTML modules on your site doesn't mean that 
search engines will banish it to obscurity. So, don't get rid of them all. So long as you use 
them wisely, you'll do just fine. How do you use them wisely? Here are the simple rules:
Do use them for showing external content such as clips hosted on MSN Video, 
product lists from Amazon Associates Program, or an Adobe Flash clip
Don't use them for showing simple text; type it directly in a zone instead
The point is this: although I recommend avoiding HTML modules, there are situations where 
the only way to do what you wish to do is to use an HTML module, including a clip hosted 
on MSN Video, for example. When you find yourself in one of those situations, go ahead 
and use it. Remember, you shouldn't exclude relevant content from your site just because 
it would require you to use an HTML module.
HTML modules have another flaw. Office Live Small Business loads their content 
dynamically using JavaScript. This means that a search engine's spiders can't 
see the content. That's another reason why you should avoid HTML modules. I 
built an entire site using HTML modules a couple of years ago only to find that it 
couldn't be indexed!
Do avoid Adobe Flash movies when HTML would do just fine
Search engines have a hard time indexing Adobe Flash content. Agreed, pages built with 
Flash are slicker than plain old HTML pages but they impede findability. It's okay to include 
a Flash movie on a page, but make sure that that's not the only content on the page. 
Supplement it with plain text in zones.

Do follow best practices
Once you've done all you can to comply with web standards, the next step is to follow a 
few basic conventions, or best practices, while building your web pages. Professional site 
developers often follow a long and stringent list of best practices. But because Office Live 
Small Business generates most of the markup on your website, your list is going to be 
rather small.
Specify a meaningful title for every page
By now, you're used to the drill—whenever you create a new web page, you provide a 
title for it. If you don't provide a title, Office Live Small Business puts one in for you. As it 
happens, the title plays a big role in how a search engine indexes a web page. So, you should 
make it a point to supply a meaningful title for every page that you create. I've insisted that 
you do so, but if you've ignored my advice, now's the time to make amends.
As you saw in Chapter 2, the title appears in a user's browser's title bar. My site's home page 
has the title Home, for example, and its contact page has the title Contact the Author, which 
appears in the browser like this:
While this titles makes sense to a visitor in the context of my site, it doesn't do much to 
help a search engine categorize and index my site correctly. By convention, designers include 
the title of their websites in their page titles. The assumption is, that doing so helps search 
engines in indexing the site's web pages.
Some designers like to prefix the page title with the site title, others like to suffix it. The 
jury is still out on whether The Office Live Guide—Contact the Author or Contact the 
Author—The Office Live Guide is the better option. I suggest that you look at your 
favourite websites and decide which convention you'd like to follow.

Time for action – specifying meaningful page titles
1. Go to Page Manager and click on the Properties link for your site's Contact Us 
page. The Choose page properties dialog opens.
2. Change the Page title to include your site's title. For example, my page's title now 
reads: The Office Live Guide – Contact the Author, as shown in the next image:
3. Click OK. The Choose page properties dialog closes.

Chapter 10
[ 195 ]
4. Save your work and preview your site. Your Contact Us page should now be 
displaying your site's title as well. My page looks like this:
5. Now, follow this procedure for every page on your site.
What just happened?
You changed the title of one of your web pages to a more meaningful one. The change helps 
search engines index the page better. Although seemingly quite minor, this change alone 
impacts on the position of your web pages in search results more than anything else.
Specify keyword and description metatags wherever possible
Metatags are HTML tags that contain information about the page that contains them. 
The information resides on the page but it's not visible to a visitor viewing the page. Some 
metatags are a part of the official HTML specification but it's quite easy to create your 
own if that's what you want to do.
Each metatag has a name and also a value, which basically is the information that it contains. 
Metatags are used in web applications for a variety of purposes. Search engines use a couple 
of prominent metatags, the Keyword metatag and the Description metatag, for indexing 
pages appropriately.
The Keyword metatag tells a search engine which terms or keywords it should associate 
with your website. The Description metatag provides a brief description of what your site is 
about. If you provide pertinent information in these metatags, search engines can index your 
site more efficiently and, therefore, can include your site in the most relevant search results.

Optimizing for Search Engines
[ 196 ]
Time for action – specifying metatags
1. Go to Page Manager and click on the Properties link for your site's Home page. 
The Choose page properties dialog opens.
2. Click on the Search Engine Optimization tab.
3. Enter roughly ten words that come to your mind when you think of your business 
in the Keyword metatags box. (You can begin with the three words or phrases 
you wrote down in Pop Quiz 1.1 in Chapter 1.) Here's what I'll enter for my site:
microsoft office live small business book rahul pitre small-business websites
Notice that I haven't entered a sentence. I entered three phrases:
microsoft office live small business book, rahul pitre, and small-business websites
By doing so, I'm telling a search engine that if a person searches for any of these 
phrases, please include my site in the search results because that's what my site 
is about.
Also, notice that all the words consist entirely of lower case letters; even my name. 
That's by convention.
Wouldn't my site appear in more search results if I included a thousand 
keywords?
That's what every logical person would think. Unfortunately, that's not the case. 
When you include a thousand keywords, you might end up confusing the search 
engine as to what exactly your site is about, and it may decide not to include 
your site in search results at all.
Nobody, except for the people who develop them, knows how search engines 
work. So, it's prudent to err on the side of caution and include few but precise 
keywords. That's the prevalent wisdom.
4. Enter a brief description of your site in roughly 30-50 words in the Description 
metatag box. Here's what I'll enter for my site:
The Office Live Guide is a companion website to the book Microsoft Office Live Small 
Business: Beginner's Guide that teaches you how to build an attractive and effective 
website for your small business with Microsoft Office Live Small Business
Again, notice that my description is brief. Keep yours brief too; don't write an 
essay. Remember that a computer program, and not a human, will be using it 
in its decision making process.

Chapter 10
[ 197 ]
5. Your Choose page properties dialog should now look something like this:
6. Click OK. The Choose page properties dialog closes.
7. Save your work.
What just happened?
You specified metatags for your site's Home page. As I mentioned before, the information 
in these tags doesn't actually show up on your website. So, if you preview your site, you 
won't notice any difference. But, hopefully, your efforts will pay off when your site appears 
in someone's search results.
Do you need these metatags on every page?
Not really. As a matter of fact, there's a trend of thought that modern search 
engines (read Google) don't use metatags at all any more. The trouble is that 
search engines don't confirm or deny the rumor. So, many designers like to 
include them on their web pages, just in case. Office Live Small Business has a 
provision for specifying both the metatags. Therefore, it's a good idea to add 
them to the most important pages on your site. I'd add them to the Home page 
and any product/service page on a website at the very least.

Optimizing for Search Engines
[ 198 ]
Fix broken links
A search engine's spiders traverse your site by following every link that they can find on your 
web pages. Therefore, it goes without saying that every link should lead to a valid web page. 
Broken links flummox the spiders and they may decide to abandon further traversal of 
your site.
There are several automated link validators for finding broken links. But their learning curve 
is somewhat steep for beginners. Because most small business websites are of manageable 
size, the easiest way of finding broken links is to click on every link on every page and make 
sure it goes to the page that it's supposed to go to. Many people find such manual checking 
too low-tech. They're not wrong but given the small size of your site, I heartily recommend it, 
especially, if you're a beginner.
By the way, you don't have to test navigation links on the primary and secondary navigation 
bars on your site; Office Live Small Business ensures that they're never broken. And you need 
to test links in your site's footer only from one page—any page you like. If they work from 
one page, they're guaranteed to work from all pages.
With the navigation and footer links out of the way, you should only have a handful of links 
to check manually.
Write good copy
Along with the page title and metatags, search engines use the text on your web pages 
to determine how to index them. Naturally, if they can make sense of the text on a page, 
they can index it correctly. You can help them make sense of the text by writing concise, 
to-the-point copy.
Check your spelling
When you take the trouble of writing good copy, it would be a shame if search engines can't 
make sense of your copy because you didn't spell-check the text. In this day and age, typos 
and spelling mistakes on web pages are unpardonable. So, CHECK YOUR SPELLING!
Here's a word of caution: don't depend on your word processor's auto-correct or 
grammar-check options. Double-check your text manually.
Pop quiz 10.1
Are the following statements true or false?
1.	
It's a good idea to add many keyword metatags to your page. More metatags 
increase the chances of search engines including your page in more search results.

Chapter 10
[ 199 ]
2.	 A meaningful page title plays a big role in determining the search engine positioning 
of your web pages.
3.	 SEO is all about tricking search engines into giving better positions to your web 
pages in their search results.
4.	 SEO services know secrets that can propel your web pages to the top of search 
engine results.
Don't abuse metatags
Use keyword metatags wisely. Add only a few relevant keywords to your pages, don't stuff 
them with hundreds of keyword metatags. Search engines can easily spot pages that have too 
many keywords and scant content. Moreover, don't add the same keyword metatag several 
times in an attempt to increase its importance. Although first-generation search engines were 
easily fooled by this trick, modern search engines have wisened-up to this shenanigan!
In the same vein, don't stuff the description metatag with every imaginable sentence that 
you think applies to your website. Just like fake keywords, search engines can identify fake 
descriptions too.
Don't add hidden text
A very common so-called trick is to add a lot of repetitive phrases to web pages as hidden 
text (or white text, as it is often called), that is, text that's displayed in the same font-color 
as the background color. Don't do it. Rest assured, you won't fool search engines with such 
simplistic tricks.
Don't link your pages to irrelevant pages
Don't pepper your web pages with spurious links to irrelevant destinations. You might have 
heard that search engines decide how popular your website is, based on the number of links 
on it. That's not true. They determine your site's popularity by looking at how many other 
websites link to yours; not how many you link yours to.
Don't fall prey to dubious SEO advice
This is the most important SEO advice that you can get: don't try to outsmart search engines. 
Dubious SEO advice abounds on the Web, a good bit of which is provided by people who 
don't quite understand how search engines work. As a rule of thumb, avoid anything that 
purports to outsmart search engines. Why? Because you just can't! The bright folks who 
build search engines are always a step ahead of the tricksters.

Optimizing for Search Engines
[ 200 ]
If search engines suspect you're cheating, they may "blacklist" your site and exclude it from 
their indexes altogether. Therefore, the best way to harness their power is to deal with them 
honestly. For your Office Live Small Business website, simply follow the advice in this chapter 
and leave the rest to the search engines.
Have a go hero – optimize your web pages
The set of SEO guidelines outlined in this chapter is, perhaps, the most important set of steps 
that you can take to optimize your web pages for search engines. Why not check how you've 
done so far in this department?
I recommend that you revisit each of your pages and check every little detail.
Summary
In this chapter, you learnt how to fine-tune your site so that search engines can index it 
efficiently and show it prominently in relevant searches. After working through it, you 
should find SEO to be less of a mystery. To recap:
There's no magic trick to improving the position or rank of your website in search 
results; even if you're willing to pay!
The best approach to SEO is to build web pages in such a way that helps search 
engines in classifying and indexing your pages appropriately so that they show up 
in the most relevant searches. You do so by conforming to standards, following 
best practices, and writing good content.
Web standards are guidelines for building web pages the right way. You don't have 
much control over the standards your web pages follow because you don't write 
the HTML for your pages yourself; Office Live Small Business does this for you. Still, 
you ��������������������������������������������������������������������������
can �����������������������������������������������������������������������
 do something: avoid using HTML modules whenever possible because they 
don't produce standards-compliant markup.
Although you don't have much control over standards compliance, you can certainly 
follow a few simple best practices to make your site friendlier to search engines.
Specify meaningful page titles and metatags on your web pages, and write good 
meaningful copy. Above all, don't attempt to outsmart search engines. Follow 
these simple rules and you'll have done everything you can to make your site 
search engine-friendly.
That's all, folks! I hope you've enjoyed building your website along with me. Please check this 
book's companion website, www.officeliveguide.com, regularly for updates.

Signing up 
To sign up for an account, follow these steps:
1.	 Point your browser at Office Live Small Business's home page, www.officelive.
com. Here's what it looks like to someone in the United States at the time of 
writing this:
Office Live Small Business is available in eight countries: Canada, France, 
Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 
The home page will take a guess at your country based on your IP address and 
display it above the green Sign in button in the top-right corner of the home 
page. If the guess is not on the money, click on the (change) link above the Sign 
in button. You'll arrive at the page that displays a list of countries where Office 
Live Small Business is available. Click on your country in the list and you'll arrive 
at the Office Live Small Business home page for your country.
2.	 Click on the CREATE A FREE WEBSITE button. The first page of the sign-up wizard

3.	 Enter your e-mail address. This e-mail address will be your login ID for your Office 
Live Small Business account. Click Next. Office Live Small Business asks you to enter 
the password you'll use for your account as shown:

Signing Up: Opening a New Office Live Small Business Account
[ 204 ]
Choose a strong password! A strong password is one that's hard to guess and hard 
to crack with automated password-cracking tools. Your password should contain:
A minimum of eight characters
Both uppercase and lowercase letters
At least one digit
At least one special character, such as an underscore or the 
ampersand (&) symbol
The best way to come up with such a password is to choose the first character 
of each word in a phrase or a sentence because it's easy to remember. Think 
of a sentence, sometimes called a passphrase, such as We visited Labrador & 
Newfoundland in October 2009. Your password, then, could be WvL&NiO2.
By the way, don't use the name of a person or a place, personal information such 
as Social Security Number or date of birth, or a word in the dictionary as your 
password; hackers could guess or crack it easily.
And please, please, please don't use the word password itself as your password.
4.	 Enter your password and click Save and continue. Office Live Small Business asks 
you to enter some information about your business and yourself as shown:

Setting Up E-mail Accounts
As you'd expect, Office Live Small Business provides you with e-mail accounts for your 
domain. Let me show you how to create and manage them.
Creating an e-mail account
To create an e-mail account, follow these steps:
1.	 Sign in to your Office Live Small Business account.
2.	 Pull down the More menu from the top navigation bar and then choose Account 
Management. The Account Management page appears.
3.	 Click E-mail Accounts in the left navigation pane. The E-mail Accounts page appears 
as shown:

Setting Up E-mail Accounts

4.	 Click on the Create new E-Mail account icon on the actions bar. The Create new 
E-Mail account dialog appears. Type all the information requested. Note that you 
can only type the portion of the e-mail address before the @ symbol. Office Live 
Small Business sets the domain name automatically as shown:
5.	 Click Next. After a brief delay, the Summary dialog informs you that the account has 
been created. 
6.	 Click Finish. You'll return to the E-mail page, which now lists the e-mail address that 
you just created.
Resetting the password of an e-mail account
You may want to reset the password for an e-mail account in two situations:
If a user forgets his password and asks you for help
If you want to prevent the owner of an account from accessing his e-mail for some 
reason; for example, he stopped working for you
To reset the password for an e-mail account, follow these steps:
1.	 Sign in to your Office Live Small Business account.
2.	 Pull down the More menu from the top navigation bar and then choose Account 
Management. The Account Management page appears.

3.	 Click E-mail Accounts in the left navigation pane. The E-mail Accounts page appears. 
It displays a list of all of the e-mail accounts in your domain.
4.	 Click the Reset password link in the Options column of the e-mail account for which 
you want to reset the password. The Reset account password dialog appears. Enter 
a new password, and then retype it in the Confirm password box as shown:
5.	 Click OK. You should see the Account password reset confirmation dialog 
confirming the change as shown:
Although you see a Security warning in the Reset account password dialog, you 
haven't done anything wrong. The dialog draws your attention to the fact that 
although you've changed the password on the e-mail account, the owner of the 
account can still use other identifying information on the account, such as the 
secret question and the alternate e-mail address, to retrieve the password.

Setting Up E-mail Accounts
[ 210 ]
You don't have to worry about this if you've changed the password simply because 
the account owner forgot it. But if you changed it because you wish to prevent the 
account owner from accessing mail at this address, you must change the identifying 
information as well.
The Windows Live ID authentication system (called Passport Account Services in its 
previous incarnation) maintains the identifying information. To change it:
Click the Go to Passport Account Services link at the bottom of the 
Account password reset confirmation dialog.
Log in to the e-mail account with the new password that you just 
created, and change the identifying information.
Deleting an e-mail account
You may delete any e-mail account from your domain. To delete one, follow these steps:
1.	 Sign in to your Office Live Small Business Account.
2.	 Pull down the More menu from the top navigation bar and then choose Account 
Management. The Account Management page appears.
3.	 Click E-mail Accounts in the left navigation pane. The E-mail Accounts page appears.

Change password
Change passwords of e-mail accounts instead of deleting them.
When you delete an e-mail account, all the mail in the associated mailbox is 
deleted as well. If all you want to do is to stop the owner of an e-mail account 
from accessing it, reset its password and identifying information.
Let's say your Marketing Manager resigns. You'll naturally want to prevent him 
from accessing his mailbox any longer. But deleting his e-mail account will get 
rid of all the mail in his mailbox as well. When you change the password on the 
e-mail account, you will still be able to read and send mail from it, but your 
ex-Marketing Manager won't be able to access it any longer.

Submitting Your Site to 
Search Engines
If you've earnestly followed the SEO guidelines in the book (Chapter 10 in particular), your 
site is already optimized for search engines. All you need to do now is to submit it to the 
top three search engines by visiting their respective submission pages:
Google: www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl
Yahoo!: http://search.yahoo.com/info/submit.html
Bing: http://www.bing.com/docs/submit.aspx
It takes a few days for the search engines to index your site, but there are no guarantees 
as to when it will start showing up in their search results. Of two sites submitted 
simultaneously, one may get indexed overnight, and the other may languish mysteriously 
for a couple of months.
Typically, your site will appear fairly quickly in Bing's and Yahoo!'s search results. It often 
takes agonizingly long, however, to appear in Google's.
To check whether the search engines have indexed your site, you can query them like this:
Google: Type site:yourdomain.com in Google's search box at http://www.
google.com and press Enter. If your site is indexed, you'll see one or more of your 
web pages in the results. If not, you'll see a message that says: Your search - site:
yourdomain.com - did not match any documents.
Yahoo!: Go to http://search.yahoo.com/search/options. The page has 
several search options. The one you need is Site/Domain. Choose the last radio 
button, next to the option that says only search in this domain/site:. Then, type the 
name of your domain (yourdomain.com), in the textbox next to it and press Enter. 
If your site has already been indexed, you'll see a link to your home page in the 
results. If not, you'll see a message that says: We were unable to find any results 
for the given URL in our index: http://yourdomain.com.






Submitting Your Site to Search Engines
[ 214 ]
Bing�: Type your domain name, yourdomain.com, in the Bing search box at 
http://www.bing.com and press Enter. If your site has been indexed, a link to 
your home page will appear in the results. If not, you'll see a message that says: 
We did not find any results for yourdomain.com.
In the discussion above, yourdomain.com is the name of your domain. To check 
on my website, I'll have to type officeliveguide.com. Note that there's no
 http:// or www. in the domain name.
You may have heard that there are hundreds of search engines and that there are paid 
search engine services that submit your site to many of them. So, why am I content in 
advising you to submit your site to only the top three? Because over 99% of the Web's 
search engine traffic flows through the big three; the rest of them aren't going to buy 
you much.
Finally, I'll reiterate the advice that I offered in Chapter 10: don't try to manipulate 
search engines using paid search services. If you've done your job of building a search 
engine-friendly website, the search engines will do theirs automatically.

Backup and Restore: Recovering 
From Disasters
There are many ways of losing files that you've stored on a computer. The hard disk that 
stores the file could crash, for example, or some inexplicable event could corrupt it to the 
point of being unusable. You might even push the wrong button accidentally and end up 
saying sayonara to an important file.
Because your web pages, and pictures on them, are ultimately stored as files, they too are 
prone to such mishaps. The only way to safeguard your files is to back them up periodically.
Office Live Small Business lets you make back up copies of everything on your website and 
provides facilities to restore it from the back a copy, if need be. 
Backing Up 
To back up your website, follow these steps:
1.	 Sign in to your Office Live Small Business account, if you haven't done so already, 
and go to Page Manager.

Backup and Restore: Recovering From Disasters
[ 216 ]
2.	 Click on the Site actions tile to pull down the Site actions menu and then choose 
Back up or restore as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 The Back up or restore Website page appears as shown:

Appendix D
[ 217 ]
4.	 The page has three sections: Back Up Site, Restore Site, and Reset Site. Each of 
them helps you to do exactly what it says.
Caution
Be very careful with the Reset Site option. As its on-screen description informs 
you, it wipes your site clean and replaces it with the starter website that you first 
saw in Chapter 1.
5.	 You have an option of backing up either a few selected pages or the entire website. 
If you wish to back up only a few files, you can select those files by clicking on the 
Choose what to back up link. But, I recommend backing up the entire website. To 
that end, click the Back up now button. Office Live Small Business tells you that it's 
working on your request as shown:

Backup and Restore: Recovering From Disasters
[ 218 ]
Site Backup
All too frequently, Office Live Small Business will tell you that it couldn't 
back your site up:
That's usually because the servers are busy. Try again after some time and the 
process should succeed.
6.	 Office Live Small Business saves the backup in a file with a .olp extension. When the 
back up is done, you'll see a prompt to save the .olp file.

Appendix D
[ 219 ]
7.	 Save the file to a location on your computer.
Office Live Small Business saves the backed up files in a proprietary format; you 
can't see or access individual files in a .olp file.
Restoring
To restore your site, follow these steps:
1.	 Before you restore your site from a backup, it's a good idea to make another backup 
of it in its present state. Otherwise, if the restore operation fails, for whatever 
reason, you'll be left with no website at all!
2.	 To restore your site from a backup, go to Page Manager and click on the Site actions 
tile to pull down the Site actions menu and then choose Backup or restore.
3.	 The Back up or restore Web site page appears as shown:
4.	 Click the Browse button under Restore site and choose the .olp file that contains 
the backup you want to restore from.

Backup and Restore: Recovering From Disasters
[ 220 ]
5.	 Click Restore now. Office Live Small Business informs you that it will wipe parts of 
your site clean while restoring it and will remind you to take another backup in its 
present state. As you've already done so in step 1, click OK.
6.	 After a brief pause, Office Live Small Business informs you that the restore was 
successful as shown:

Reports: Analyzing Visitor Statistics
Okay, you've built a terrific website. You're convinced that it's attractive, informative, and 
user-friendly. The question, however, is whether other people think so too.
And how do find that out? Elementary, my dear Watson! All you need to do is snoop around 
for information such as the following:
How many people visited your website in a given period?
Which search engines or directories did they use to arrive there?
Which keywords did they type into search engines to find your website?
How long did people stay on your website once they got there?
Which pages did they visit the most?
Which pages appeared to drive visitors away?
What kind of computers and browsers did your visitors use?
Did your online advertising campaigns generate enough traffic to justify 
the expense?
Once you find answers to these questions, you can put two and two together and take an 
educated guess at the ultimate question: Does my website fulfill its objectives?
To help you find answers to these questions easily, Office Live Small Business automatically 
embeds a little chunk of JavaScript on each of your web pages. The script sends back the 
dirt on every page request that your website gets, such as the IP address of the visitor's 
computer, the name of the page that they requested, and the brand and version of their 
browser. Office Live Small Business stores all of these details in a database.
A set of reports, called Reports, then extracts this information from the database on 
Office Live Small Business's servers on demand, compiles it logically, and presents it as 
easy-to-understand charts and tables that you can make sense of easily.

Reports: Analyzing Visitor Statistics
[ 222 ]
Tools, such as Reports, which gather and analyze a website's visitor statistics are 
called web analytics packages. The most well-known web analytics package, 
perhaps, is Google Analytics.
Accessing Reports
To access Reports, sign in to your Office Live Small Business account, if you haven't done so 
already, and go to Page Manager. Click on the Reports link in the left navigation bar. The 
Reports dashboard page appears. It displays a few metrics graphically. You'll see several 
links in the left navigation bar of the dashboard. Each of them will lead you to a report.
What exactly do these Reports tell you?
A website's visitor statistics is not a single, monolithic number; several related attributes 
make up these statistics. To make sense of the numbers as you view the various reports, 
you must know what those attributes are and what they mean. So, here's the vernacular:
Keep in mind that these definitions are specific to Reports; other web analytics 
packages may have different meanings for these terms.
Visitors: A visitor is a person who requests a page from a website.
Page views: A page view represents a visitor accessing a page on a website.
Visits: Everything that a visitor does on a website before leaving it constitutes a visit. 
A visit results in one or more page views. If a visitor doesn't do anything for a while, 
usually 30 minutes, the visit ends.
New and returning visitors: A person paying his first visit to a website is a new 
visitor. His second visit onward, he becomes a returning visitor. Websites distinguish 
between new and returning visitors based on their IP addresses, by giving them 
cookies, or some combination thereof. Let's say the same person arrives at a website 
at two different times. If you view Reports between his first and second visits, it will 
show one visit and one new visitor. If you view Reports after the second visit, it will 
show two visits and one returning visitor.
Unique visitors: The term unique visitors refers to the number of distinct people 
who visit a website. If a person visits a website three times, the web server records 
three visits, but only one unique visitor. From the Report's point of view:
Unique Visitors = New Visitors + Returning Visitors






Appendix E
[ 223 ]
Entry pages: An entry page is the first page on a website that a visitor views during 
a given visit. Say a website has three pages: Home, Products, and Contact Us. If a 
visitor clicks on a link in the search-engine results that brings him to the Products 
page, then it is the entry page for that visit.
Exit pages: An exit page is the last page on a website that a visitor views during a 
given visit. Continuing with the example in the previous entry, if the visitor views the 
Contact Us page after entering the site at the Products page and then surfs away to 
another site, the Contact Us page is the exit page for that visit.
Sources: A visitor arrives at a website either by clicking on a link on another website 
or by typing the website's address in his browser's address bar. If he arrives from 
another website, that website is the source or the referrer for his visit. If, on the 
other hand, he types the website's address in his browser's address bar, a direct 
link is the source for his visit.
Referrer pages: The specific page, on the source website, on which a visitor clicks 
a link to arrive at a website, is the referrer page. A referrer page is of interest only 
if it's not a search results page of a search engine. If it is, the keyword(s) that the 
visitor entered for the search are more relevant.
Keywords: Keywords are the words, terms, or phrases that people search for using 
search engines. If you search for the words Office Live, those are the keywords.
Conversions and Conversion points: The main reason that people build websites is to 
lure visitors into taking an action, whether that's to buy an item, ask for a quote, or 
give feedback. When a visitor takes such a desired action, he makes a conversion and 
reaches a conversion point. Let's say a website's primary purpose is to sell some items 
and to that end, the website has a shopping cart. Let's also assume that after a visitor 
places an order by checking out from the shopping cart, the website displays an order 
confirmation page. Now, everytime someone reaches the order confirmation page, 
he takes an action that the site's owners want him to take. Therefore, he makes a 
conversion and the order confirmation page is conversion point.
Conversion rate: The conversion rate tells you how often visitors to a website 
reach a conversion point. If five out of every hundred visits result in a conversion, 
the conversion rate is 5%.
What Reports don't tell you
Let me squash a myth before we go any further: contrary to common belief, Reports, or 
any other web analytics package for that matter, doesn't offer a prescription to propel your 
website to the very top of all search results, nor does it prescribe the magic pill that would 
compel people all over the world to ditch their favorite websites and flock to yours.

Reports: Analyzing Visitor Statistics
[ 224 ]
I'm sure you'd be overjoyed to receive a bulleted list from Reports every morning that goes 
something like this:
Add five more pages to your site with such-and-such content; that's what people are 
looking for.
Change the background color of your web pages to light blue and change the font 
from Verdana to Georgia. That should attract 63 additional visitors every day!
The third word on the 24th line of the Services page is spelt promtp. It should be 
prompt. By the way, the copy on the Services page is just pitiful. Replace it with this: 
[new copy here]. Not only will this increase traffic by 11%, your visitors will start 
clicking on the AdSense ads on the web page as well.
Unfortunately, Reports can't generate such a list. They merely present site statistics in an 
easy-to-understand format. What you do with those numbers is entirely up to you.
The right way to use Reports
Details of a single visit can't give you a peek into your visitors' minds, but when you 
consolidate details from hundreds or thousands of visits, you begin to notice trends in their 
behavior. These trends tell you whether your web site's visitors are using your website the 
way that you want them to. If they aren't, corrective measures are in order.
Trends are difficult to identify from only the raw data. They're far easier to notice when you 
review scientifically grouped data over a long period of time. Therefore, interpreting Reports 
is not a one-time activity; it's an ongoing 3-step process:
1.	 Review reports periodically. For small websites, once a month is usually enough.
2.	 Analyze the trends and individual metrics in them to see if anything appears amiss 
and take an educated guess as to why. Are fewer people visiting your site over a 
period of time? Are they visiting only a page or two instead of browsing around 
the entire site? Does a specific page appear frequently among exit pages, and if so, 
could it be so because the page is not displaying (or working) correctly? These are 
the kind of questions that you should be looking to answer with Reports.
3.	 Make changes to your website to address the likely problem areas and go back to 
step 1 to evaluate how effective your changes were (and to find new problem areas).
The second step is the key step in this process. If you're able to pinpoint the problem areas 
effectively, you'll have a better shot at attaining the goals that you've set for your website.

The wrong way to use Reports
As a new site owner, you might be tempted to pore over your site statistics several times 
a day and tweak a few things on your website here and there. Rest assured, it won't serve 
any purpose; heck, it may even lead you to the wrong conclusions.
It's very easy to twist statistics and draw nonsensical conclusions from them. There's the 
story of a man, for example, who was found dead with his head in the oven and his feet in 
the refrigerator. The coroner put down exposure to extreme temperatures as the cause of 
death. The statisticians were puzzled, however, because according to their calculations, he 
was at room temperature, on average, at the time of his death.
To avoid such traps, keep in mind that:
Statistics are relevant only when there's enough data. If you look at the statistics 
of a popular website that several thousand people visit every day, you may be able 
to notice trends every day or even every hour, perhaps. But that may not be true of 
a small website, such as yours, which far fewer people visit every day. Therefore, 
you might have to wait a long time before you have enough data to make sense 
of the numbers.
Raw numbers tell you very little. Let's say, for example, that 956 people visited 
my website yesterday and they viewed 4539 pages. Is that good or bad? You can't 
really tell because you don't have a meaningful frame of reference. But if I tell you 
that 352 people viewed 1127 pages the day before, you can then put yesterday's 
numbers in perspective.
Are Reports accurate?
Gathering visitor statistics isn't an exact science. Like all statistics, visitor statistics too 
have an inherent margin of error. The numbers can get distorted, as the following 
examples illustrate:
If two people who visit a website are behind the same proxy server, the web server 
may not recognize them as distinct visitors because both expose the same IP 
address to the web server.
If a single person uses an Internet service that doesn't necessarily route separate 
page requests to the same website through the same proxy server—AOL, 
for example, the web server may record each page request as coming from 
a distinct visitor.

Reports: Analyzing Visitor Statistics
[ 226 ]
The term visit doesn't have a universally-accepted definition. What constitutes a 
single visit to a person may appear to be two different visits to a web server. For 
example, you may get a call from a friend soon after you visit a website. You may 
chat with your friend for an hour and then go back to your computer and continue 
from where you left off. From your perspective, you visited the website only once. 
The site's web server, however, may have stopped keeping track of you after, say, 
30 minutes. When you resume your interrupted visit, the server then may record 
it as a distinct visit.
Sometimes, web servers record visitors based on a unique cookie that they issue to 
each visitor. This approach has two advantages: visits by robots are ignored because 
they don't accept cookies, and multiple visits by the same person can be tracked to 
get a more accurate count of unique visitors. But this system is not foolproof either. 
If you visit a site from your work computer as well as from your home computer, the 
web server may count you as two distinct visitors.
Such distortions tend to even out as the volume of the data increases. It's difficult or even 
pointless to analyze data that consists of all of five visits, but as the volume grows, you can 
consider Reports accurate enough for all practical purposes.
What about Google Analytics?
Google Analytics is perhaps the best hosted web analytics tool. It has a comprehensive 
feature-set. Its slick, interactive reports illuminate every imaginable web-traffic statistic. 
And to top it all, it has an unbeatable price tag: free!
The main reason for its universal adoption, however, is that it's integrated with AdWords, 
Google's advertisement-placement service. If you advertise with AdWords, you can easily 
track the effectiveness of each ad campaign with Google Analytics. For anyone who spends 
advertising dollars on AdWords, Google Analytics is an indispensable tool.
But Google Analytics has a lot to offer even if you don't use AdWords. The statistical 
reports it produces are comprehensive. They help you to tailor your site's content to 
a visitor's requirements.
Besides, you can customize Google Analytics' reports to suit your specific requirements. 
Here's an example: if you monitor web statistics faithfully, it makes sense to filter out visits 
from you and your employees. The Reports package doesn't have settings to filter out 
such internal traffic. If you expect your website to have a significant amount of internally 
generated traffic, you may be at a serious disadvantage using Reports.



Appendix E
[ 227 ]
Google Analytics' reports are state-of-the-art. Many web analytics pros consider entry pages 
and exit pages to be 'so 20th century'. Reports, unfortunately, don't support newer metrics 
like click density, which identifies the hot spots on your web pages where visitors tend to 
click the most.
Despite all its limitations, however, don't dismiss Reports summarily. Remember 
the following:
Reports suffice for the needs of small websites and novice webmasters. If you're just 
starting out with web analytics, Google Analytics can be somewhat overwhelming.
Like Google Analytics, Reports are free too. And if you use adManager, Microsoft's 
AdWords-like service, you're better off with Site Reports, which have built-in support 
for tracking adManager campaigns.
Reports are integrated with Office Live Small Business, which automatically adds 
the little chunk of JavaScript tracking code. Therefore, you don't have to open yet 
another account with Google Analytics and add its JavaScript code manually to 
your web pages.
You must be familiar with HTML and JavaScript in order to integrate Google Analytics 
with your Office Live Small Business website. The straightforward instructions on 
Google Analytics' website won't work with Office Live Small Business because of 
the way that Page Editor builds web pages.
My advice, therefore, is to start off with Reports if you're new to web analytics. Use 
the package for a while and get a feel for web analytics. After using Reports for a few 
months, if you feel that the package's simplicity is holding you back, by all means switch 
to Google Analytics.
