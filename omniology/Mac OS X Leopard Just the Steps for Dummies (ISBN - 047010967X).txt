Author’s Acknowledgments
First and foremost, I wish to thank my family for their
patience as I introduced Macs into our home for the
first time. I have been using Macintosh computers in
my work for over a decade, but having them at home
was new and there was some initial skepticism.
Fortunately, it didn’t take long for everyone to realize
that these Macs actually do work pretty well!
I want to thank Bob Woerner and Wiley for bringing
me on for this book, and the Wiley publishing team
who helped put it all together. Nicole Sholly and
Jennifer Riggs turned my cocktail napkin scribblings
into something readable, and Dennis Cohen made
sure that it was all technically accurate.
I also received assistance from Andy Marken and Bob
“Dr. Mac” LeVitus. Thanks folks!

M
ac users have always been a loyal group, and for good reasons. Since
Apple first started producing Macintosh computers in the 1980s,
they’ve placed an emphasis on quality, ease-of-use, and stability. Modern
Macs running the latest OS X operating system are among the most powerful
and dependable personal computers you can buy, and they’re versatile
enough to meet virtually any personal or professional need you may have.
About This Book
Macs are user friendly, but they’re still computers, so you must follow cer-
tain steps to complete tasks, like setting up an e-mail account, accessing a
Wi-Fi hotspot, transferring music to an iPod, customizing the OS X interface,
creating a network, and almost any other computer task you can imagine.
This book provides the steps you need to get running quickly, without
having to pour through extra narratives or examples that you probably
don’t need anyway. And because a picture is worth a thousand words, all
the steps in this book are accompanied by figures that walk you visually
through each task.
Why You Need This Book
Whether you’re new to Macs or you just want a handy quick reference to
OS X Leopard, this book helps you get to work quickly and efficiently.
Each task covers a specific subject, and most steps take only a minute or
two to follow. This book also provides crucial tips that you won’t find in
your Mac’s built-in help system.
Conventions used
in this book
➟When you have to access a menu command,
I use the ➪symbol. For example, if you have
to open the File menu and then choose Open,
I say File➪Open.
➟Internet addresses are presented like
www.dummies.com. I leave off the
http:// part of Web addresses because you
usually don’t have to type it anyway.
When you see this icon, the text includes
helpful tips or extra information relating
to the task.
➟
Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
I organized the chapters of this book into several basic parts:
Part I: Using OS X
The Mac OS X operating system is accessible and easy to use
right out of the box. But if you want to customize the way OS
X looks and behaves, the chapters in this part show you how.
Chapters also show you how to manage system preferences
and work with files and folders, which is especially helpful if
you’re new to Macs.
Part II: Getting to Work in OS X
Macs aren’t all about iPods and movies. This part shows you
how to use some of the handy programs that are included
with OS X, as well as how to use productivity programs, such
as word processors and presentation programs. I show you
how to use and customize the OS X Dashboard, an innovative
tool that gives you instant access to notepads, calculators,
weather updates, sports scores, and more. And I show you
how to clean up desktop clutter with Spaces, a new feature
in OS X Leopard.
Part III: Going Online with Your Mac
If you’re like most people, the Internet is one of the main rea-
sons you use a computer in the first place. In this part, I show
you how to browse the Web, exchange e-mail, chat, and even
create your own blogs and Web pages.
Part IV: Using Multimedia
A modern Mac running OS X Leopard is one of the most
powerful multimedia devices you can buy. With iLife pro-
grams that come free with most new Macs, you can watch
DVDs, manage and play your music library, send music
to iPods and other MP3 players, organize and improve
digital photos, and make your own movies.
Part V: Networking Your Mac
If you have more than one computer, you’ll probably
want to connect those computers together at some point
so that they can share files, printers, Internet connections,
and other resources. This part shows you how to set up
networks between all your computers, even if some of
those computers are Windows PCs.
Part VI: Extending Your Mac’s Capabilities
As powerful and versatile as most Macs are, they can be
even more. In this part, I show you how to use Bluetooth
peripherals with your Mac, how to network with comput-
ers running older versions of the Macintosh operating
system, and how to upgrade your Mac. One chapter even
shows you how to install the Microsoft Windows operat-
ing system on your Mac, a new capability with Intel-
chipped Macs running OS X Leopard.
Get Ready To
If you’re ready to fire up your first Mac, or you’re a long-
time user and need quick steps to access advanced features,
there’s a task in this book that’s ready to help you.

Customizing OS X
A
pple is rightfully proud of the user interface design incorporated into
the Macintosh OS X family of operating systems. The interface is easy
to use, and it’s also easy to customize so that your Mac looks and behaves
the way you want.
This chapter shows you how to customize various parts of the OS X inter-
face, including
➟
Desktop: You can change the color scheme of your desktop or use
a picture as your background.
➟
Display: You can also change the size of the desktop display, use
a custom screen saver, and adjust the way the clock appears.
➟
Dock: The OS X Dock normally resides at the bottom of the screen
and gives quick access to your most commonly used programs. You
can move the Dock, add or remove items, and change the way the
Dock appears.
➟
Keyboard and Accessibility: Mac OS X can accommodate most
accessibility needs, and common keyboard shortcuts can be
changed, too.
➟
Exposé: Switch quickly between programs with this OS X tool.
➟
Spaces: If you’re tired of constantly re-arranging your desktop,
create and easily move between multiple virtual workspaces using
Leopard’s new Spaces feature.

Add and Remove Dock Items
1.
Open the icon for your hard drive and then click
Applications in the sidebar on the left side of the Finder
window to open the Applications folder, as shown in
Figure 1-9.
2.
Locate the icon for the program that you want to add to
the Dock.
In some cases — such as Apple iWork or Microsoft Office applica-
tions — you may need to open a subfolder to find a program’s
icon. Look closely at the icon; if the icon looks like a folder, it is a
folder.
3.
Click and drag the program’s icon to the Dock, as
shown in Figure 1-9. The place where you drop the icon
on the Dock will be that icon’s location, so choose a
location carefully.
4.
To launch an application from the Dock, simply click
the appropriate icon. The application launches.
5.
To remove an item from the Dock, click-and-hold the
mouse pointer on the item until a pop-up menu
appears, as shown in Figure 1-10.
If you’re using a two-button mouse, simply right-click the Dock
icon you want to remove instead of clicking-and-holding.
6.
While still holding down the mouse button, move the
pointer over Remove from Dock and then release the
mouse button. The item disappears from the Dock.

Move and Hide the Dock
1.
Open System Preferences and then click the Dock icon.
2.
In the Dock settings screen, as shown in Figure 1-11,
move the Dock Size slider to change the Dock size.
You can also change the Dock size at any time by clicking and drag-
ging up or down on the thin vertical line near the right side of the
Dock.
3.
If you want to use Dock magnification — useful if
you have the Dock size set to small and it holds many
icons — place a check mark next to Magnification and
adjust the slider as desired.
4.
Choose a Dock position by clicking the Left, Bottom, or
Right radio buttons. Figure 1-12 shows the Dock on the
left side of the screen.
If you have a widescreen monitor, you may find that putting the
Dock on the left or right side of the screen makes more efficient use
of screen real estate.
5.
If you don’t like the bouncy feedback provided by Dock
icons when you launch a program, remove the check
mark next to Animate Opening Applications. An arrow
still shows you when the program is launching.
6.
To automatically hide the Dock when it isn’t in use,
place a check mark next to Automatically Hide and
Show the Dock. To reveal the hidden Dock, simply
move the mouse pointer to the bottom (or left or right,
as appropriate) of the screen.

Open System Preferences and then click the Universal
Access icon.
2.
To adjust settings for visual impairments, click the
Seeing tab to reveal the Seeing settings, as shown in
Figure 1-13.
3.
To enable VoiceOver — a basic screen reader program
built-in to OS X — select the On radio button below
VoiceOver.
If you aren’t happy with how VoiceOver sounds, click the Open
VoiceOver Utility button. There you can change the voice, pitch,
speed, and other characteristics of VoiceOver.
4.
To enable screen zooming, select the On radio button
below Zoom. Press Option+Ô+= to zoom in on an area
of the screen, and press Option+Ô+- to zoom back out.
5.
Use the settings below Display to change the appearance
and use of color onscreen.
6.
Click the Hearing button to reveal audio options, as
shown in Figure 1-14.
7.
If you can’t hear alert sounds from the computer, place
a check mark next to Flash the Screen When an Alert
Sound Occurs.
Click the Flash Screen button to test the screen flash.

8.
Click the Keyboard button to adjust keyboard options,
as shown in Figure 1-15.
9.
To enable Sticky Keys, select the On radio button next to
Sticky Keys. Sticky Keys allows you to use modifier keys,
such as Shift, Function, Control, Option, and Ô, with-
out simultaneously pressing multiple keys.
If you need Sticky Keys only occasionally, place a check mark next
to Press the Shift Key Five Times to Turn Sticky Keys On or Off. This
option gives you an easy way to quickly enable or disable Sticky
Keys.
10.
To create a delay between when a key is first pressed and
when it’s accepted by the computer, click On next to
Slow Keys. Use the Acceptance Delay slider to change
the length of the delay.
11.
Click Mouse & Trackpad to open pointer device settings,
as shown in Figure 1-16.
12.
If you wish to use a numeric keypad in place of a
mouse, click On next to Mouse Keys.
If your keyboard doesn’t include a dedicated keypad — this is usu-
ally the case with laptops — you can purchase a USB (Universal
Series Bus) keypad at most computer and office supply stores.
13.
Use the Initial Delay and Maximum Speed sliders to
fine-tune the behavior of Mouse Keys.
14.
If the mouse cursor is too small, use the Cursor Size
slider to change the size of the cursor. The Cursor Size
slider works with Mouse Keys as well as a conventional
mouse or trackpad.
If you’re giving a presentation with your Mac and a digital projector,
you may want to increase the size of the mouse cursor so that the
cursor can be used as an onscreen pointer during the presentation.

screen saver appears. If you choose 15, for example, the
screen saver appears only after the computer is inactive
for 15 minutes.
5.

saver, click the Hot Corners button.
6.
Decide which corner you want as the hot corner and
then choose Start Screen Saver in that corner’s menu, as
shown in Figure 1-18.
7.
Click OK to close the hot corner options. To test the hot
corner, move the mouse pointer all the way to the cor-
ner you selected. The screen saver begins.

Creating and
Managing User
Accounts
A
fter you get a new computer, one of the first things you will probably
do is customize it to fit your needs and personality. You may customize
the desktop appearance, add your favorite programs to the Dock, and set up
e-mail and chat programs for your personal accounts. But what if your new
computer is shared by other people? They may want to do customizations
of their own, and you probably don’t want other people using your e-mail
account.
The Macintosh operating system allows you to easily set up multiple user
accounts on your computer. Personal user accounts have several advantages:
➟
Each user can customize the way the operating system looks and
behaves without affecting other users.
➟
Users can set up and use their own e-mail and Internet accounts.
➟
Private files and communications stay private.
➟
User accounts can help prevent unauthorized persons from using the
computer.
➟
Parents can control how their children spend their time on the
computer.
This chapter shows you how to set up and manage user accounts on your
computer.

Managing Files
and Folders
C
onsider all the things for which you use your computer. You compose
e-mail, browse the Internet, edit photos, play music, type memos, and
more. Many of these tasks involve files that are stored on your hard drive.
The Macintosh operating system makes managing your files easy. The Mac
OS X component that helps you browse and manage files is the Finder. The
Finder runs at all times in the background, and you can open Finder win-
dows from the Dock or any time you double-click the icon for a hard drive
or folder. The Finder lets you quickly perform basic tasks, like creating fold-
ers and moving or deleting files. The Finder also lets you perform more
advanced tasks, such as customizing a file’s icon or changing the default pro-
gram you use to open a file.
This chapter shows you how to manage files with the Finder. It also shows
you how to use other OS X file management tools, including
➟
Spotlight: This is a powerful tool for searching files, programs, and
even system settings.
➟
Trash: Deleted files are sent to the Trash. If you accidentally delete a
needed file, you can usually recover it from the Trash.
➟
Burn Folders: Back up important files to recordable CDs or DVDs by
using Burn folders.
➟
Time Machine: New in Leopard, Time Machine makes it easy to back
up your entire computer on a regular basis.

ing glass.
2.
Type a query. When you type, top results appear in a
menu below Spotlight. Choose a result in the menu to
open it.
3.
To view a more detailed list of results, click Show All in
the Spotlight menu to open the Spotlight window, as
shown in Figure 3-1.
To search a specific location (such as an external hard drive or your
Pictures folder), select the location in the sidebar on the left side of

4.
If Spotlight searches resources that you prefer not to
search, open System Preferences and click the Spotlight
icon.
You can also open Spotlight Preferences by choosing Spotlight
Preferences in the Spotlight menu.

file.
Make sure you select a program that is appropriate for opening the
file. For example, if the file is a picture, you probably want to asso-
ciate it with a graphics program like iPhoto or Adobe Photoshop. A
word processing program, like Apple Pages, isn’t the best program
to open and edit photos in.

Ideally, the icon image should have some relevance to the docu-
ment. For example, if the document is a PDF file containing infor-
mation about your company, you may want to change the file’s icon
so that it uses your company logo.

folders in the Finder include Documents, Movies, Music, and
Pictures. Each folder is represented by a link in the Finder Sidebar,
so they’re easy to find.
Rename Groups of Files
1.
Make sure all the files you want to rename are together
in a single folder. The folder should contain only the
files you want to rename.
2.
Open the Finder and then open the Applications folder.
3.
In the Applications folder, open the AppleScript folder,
open the Example Scripts folder, and then open the
Finder Scripts folder. A list of Finder scripts appears, as
shown in Figure 3-10.
4.
To trim text from file names, double-click Trim File
Names.scpt. The Script Editor launches.

T
he Macintosh computer is known for its ease of use, but “easy” doesn’t
mean simplistic. Beneath the friendly exterior of OS X is a powerful
operating system, which can be configured for almost any task by using a
wide selection of hardware.
This chapter shows you how to configure the system software for your spe-
cific needs and hardware. Tasks show you how to take command of both the
internal hardware in your Mac and the peripherals attached to it. Specific
tasks include
➟
Internal components: Operating system tools help you make the
most efficient use of your laptop’s batteries, decide which disk is used
to boot the system, and update the OS X software.
➟
Peripherals: Your Mac can work with a variety of different printers,
monitors, keyboards, and audio devices. Configuring peripherals in
OS X is easy.
The tasks in this chapter show you how to control your computer’s hardware
with OS X software tools. The final task also shows you more about the
specifications and performance of your computer, which is important if you
decide to make some upgrades. If you want to upgrade the actual hardware
of your Mac, see Chapter 23.

Utilizing OS X

P
ersonal computers first became popular in the 1980s, well before iPods
and the Internet became integral parts of our lives. Why did people
spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on computers like the Apple
II, TRS-80, IBM PC, and early Macintosh? Even before digital multimedia
and the online world, computers served as powerful tools for organizing
lives, typing reports and memos, and storing information.
Today we take it for granted that our computers will help us compose letters,
track schedules, and manage contacts. And with a Mac, you really can take
these things for granted because new Macintosh computers come with an
array of free programs to help you accomplish many common tasks. These
programs live in the OS X Applications folder, and this chapter shows you
how to use some of them. This chapter shows you how to
➟

Macs, or available as part of iLife).

Each program that is left running uses up some memory and other
system resources. Unlike Windows programs, most Macintosh appli-
cations don’t quit when you simply click a window’s red Close button.

Chapter 5: Utilizing OS X Applications

Using Productivity
Software
Y
ou may have heard some of your Windows-using friends say things like,
“I’d use a Mac, but the programs I need aren’t available for OS X.”
Given this perception, it comes as a surprise to many people that, in fact, a
lot of applications are available for OS X, including ubiquitous Microsoft
Office applications like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. If you have work to
get done, your Macintosh is up to the task.
Applications, such as word processors, spreadsheet programs, and presenta-
tion programs, are often called productivity programs. Apple offers its own
suite of productivity programs — iWork. iWork is more affordable than
Microsoft Office and includes Pages (a word processor) and Keynote (a pres-
entation program).
This chapter focuses primarily on iWork applications although many of the
basic techniques apply to Microsoft Office as well. To order iWork, visit your
local Apple retailer or see www.apple.com/iwork. Tasks show how to
create and edit new presentations and word processing documents with
iWork applications.
Free trials of Apple iWork and Microsoft Office are pre-installed in the Applications fold-
ers of most new Macs. For more on using Microsoft Office applications for OS X, check
out Microsoft Office v.10 for Macs For Dummies by Tom Negrino (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

Using Dashboard
C
omputers are said to be labor saving devices, yet it seems to take an
awful lot of mouse clicks, menu commands, and keyboard inputs to get
anything done. This is what makes computers less intuitive than, say, a car,
where every important control is immediately at hand and critical informa-
tion is within your peripheral view.
The engineers at Apple must have been thinking about computer usability
problems, too. When they released OS X version 10.4 Tiger, they included a
new tool — Dashboard. Like the instrument panel in your car, the OS X
Dashboard puts key information and tools within easy reach. Dashboard
isn’t quite in peripheral view — if it was it would be in the way — but it is
just a single mouse click away, and Dashboard doesn’t affect your other
applications.
This chapter shows you how to open Dashboard and how to add and
remove Dashboard items, which are also called widgets. Dashboard widgets
covered in this chapter include
➟
Weather
➟
Sticky Notes
➟
Web Clips
➟
Flight Tracker
➟
Translation
➟
Unit Converter
➟
Movies
New in OS X Leopard is the ability to easily create your own widgets. The
Photocast widget described in this chapter is one such build-your-own
Dashboard widget.

Open Dashboard
1.
To open Dashboard, simply click the Dashboard button
on the Dock. The screen dims slightly, and Dashboard
widgets zoom into view, as shown in Figure 7-1.
Dashboard can also be opened by two additional
methods:
• Double-click the Dashboard icon in the Applications
folder.
• Press F12 on your keyboard.
2.
To change the way Dashboard opens, open System
Preferences and then click the Exposé & Spaces icon.
3.
To create a hot corner for Dashboard, select Dashboard
in one of the Active Screen Corner menus. In Figure 7-2,
the lower-right corner has been set to Dashboard. To
open Dashboard, simply move the mouse pointer to the
corresponding corner of the screen.
4.
To change the keyboard shortcut used for opening
Dashboard, make a different selection in the Dashboard
menu.
If you want to use a modifier key, such as Ô or Control, simply
hold down that key (or keys) while making a selection in the
Dashboard menu.
Dashboard can’t be quit like other OS X applications. To close
Dashboard, simply click a blank area of the screen. Although a
black arrow remains under the Dashboard icon on the Dock, very
little of your computer’s resources are dedicated to Dashboard.

Dashboard screen. A list of widgets appears along the
bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 7-3.
3.
Click the arrow buttons on the far right or left of the list
of widgets to scroll through the list.
4.
To add a widget, simply click the widget in the list. The

Sending E-Mail and
Browsing the Internet
P
ersonal computers have been available since the 1970s, but in the
early years they were mainly used by businesses, gamers, and hardcore
computer geeks. With the advent of the World Wide Web in the 1990s,
more people came to see personal computers as necessities. Today the
computer is an indispensable tool for communication, information, and
entertainment.
Your Macintosh is ready to communicate, entertain, and retrieve informa-
tion as soon as you take it out of the box. It comes with all the software
applications you need to send and receive e-mail, browse the Web, or down-
load multimedia. Your Mac probably even comes with the hardware needed
to connect to the Internet in the form of a network adapter and AirPort
(AirPort is optional on some models). If you need a modem for dial-up
Internet, Apple sells one that plugs into your Mac’s USB port.
This chapter shows you how to get started with e-mail and Web browsing.
In addition to the applications that come with OS X, this chapter also
shows you how to download and use Firefox, a popular third-party Web
browser application.
Before you can use e-mail and the Internet, you must have an Internet service account.
These accounts are provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), of which many are
probably in your area. If you don’t already have Internet service, check with your tele-
phone or cable company to see what services they offer or look in the phone book under
Internet Service. Your ISP may provide specific instructions for connecting its service.

Go Online with Safari
1.
Launch the Safari Web browser by clicking the Safari
icon on the Dock or by double-clicking its icon in the
Applications folder.

the Forward button to return forward.
• Reload: Use this button to reload a page. The Reload
button is especially helpful if a wireless connection
drops momentarily and the page fails to completely
load.
• Bookmark: Click this to bookmark a Web page. You
can easily return to the page again by selecting it
from the Bookmarks menu on the menu bar.
4.
To add a bookmark to the Bookmark bar (located just

Using a .Mac Account
O
ne of the coolest things about the Internet is that anyone can publish
photos, blogs, and other stuff for the whole world to see. If you’d like
your own online home page, you’re going to need some online real estate
on which to build it. Many different companies offer online server space,
but such servers are often costly or difficult to use.
Apple offers online server space, too, and it’s much easier to use than many
other online services. The Apple online service is .Mac, and you can use .Mac
for both public and private purposes. On the public side, you can use .Mac
to publish photos, videos, calendars, and Web pages, and on the private
side, you can use .Mac to archive important files and data so that it can be
easily retrieved from anywhere in the world. .Mac also helps you create your
own blogs and podcasts, set up personalized e-mail accounts, and more.
A .Mac account costs about $100 per year. This is close to what other online
server space companies charge, but with .Mac you get user friendliness for
no extra charge. You can also try .Mac for free for 60 days. This chapter
shows you how to get started with a .Mac account and how to start using
some of the most popular .Mac features.

Blogging and Web
Designing with iWeb
N
ot so long ago, keeping in touch with distant friends and family meant
writing letters, stuffing envelopes, and licking stamps. And if you
wanted to share some favorite photos, you had to get expensive film dupli-
cates made by a photo processor.
The Internet has revolutionized the way we keep in touch. E-mail is one
great way to communicate with distant relations, and you can also create
your own Web site. When you create a Web page and put it online, anyone
with Internet access can read your story and see your pictures. And you don’t
have to be a trained Web developer to produce your own online presence
because Apple produces a good Web design program called iWeb. iWeb is
bundled with many new Macs, or you can purchase it as part of the iLife
suite from your favorite Apple retailer.
This chapter shows you how to create a Web page with iWeb and how to
upload your Web page to the Internet so that anyone can see it. Steps also
show you how to create and share
➟
Blogs: Short for Weblogs, blogs are daily or weekly narratives that you
post online for others to read. Blogs may focus on your travels, politics,
hobbies, your life in general, or any other subject that you can imagine.
➟
Podcasts: — A Podcast is like a mix between a blog and a radio or TV
show. You can record your own Podcasts, which can then be shared
with others through iTunes.
Your Web pages must be uploaded to a Web server before others can view them. This
chapter assumes that you use .Mac as your Web server. For more on creating and using
a .Mac account, see Chapter 9.

Chatting on Your Mac
A
lthough the Internet has only been in widespread use for a little over a
decade, its roots go all the way back to the late 1960s. One of the earli-
est uses for the Internet was live chat — distant parties typed messages to
each other in real time. This chat tradition continues today and is made easy
by instant messaging programs, such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), MSN
Messenger, ICQ, and Apple’s iChat. Not only does iChat give you access to
the .Mac network of chat users, but it can be configured to work with some
other popular instant messaging networks as well.
In addition to typed text messages, some chat programs now offer voice chat
as well. Real time voice chat may not seem revolutionary to anyone who has
ever used a telephone, but the free or nearly-free cost of Internet-based voice
chat appeals to anyone who has ever paid a long distance phone bill. iChat
can be configured to work with popular voice networks, including Skype
and Google Talk.
This chapter shows you how to chat via iChat. It also shows you how to
configure iChat for use with the Skype and Google Talk voice networks.
Finally, this chapter also shows you how to use a third-party chat program —
Adium — which is available for Mac. Adium can be used with many of the
most popular instant messaging networks, including AOL Instant Messenger,
MSN, ICQ, Yahoo, and more.

Using iTunes
and iPods
M
ore than almost any other company, Apple has become associated
with digital music in the last few years. The iPod has become the
world’s most popular and identifiable MP3 player, and the iTunes program
revolutionized online music sales at a time when downloadable songs
looked like they might be litigated out of existence.
iPods and iTunes get along just fine with Windows PCs, but because you
have a Macintosh, the integration couldn’t be more simple. No matter what
iPod you have — ranging from a tiny iPod Nano to a full size (yet still com-
pact) iPod — it is recognized instantly when you connect the iPod to your
Mac. And because iTunes is the program for synchronizing music to an iPod,
it goes without saying that your Mac already has the necessary software to
copy songs and videos to your iPod. This chapter shows you how to quickly
and easily use an iPod with your Mac.
Of course, you don’t need an iPod to use iTunes. Even if you have no MP3
player at all, iTunes is a great program for storing, organizing, and playing
songs, videos, audio books, and other multimedia files. This chapter shows
you how to manage and play your multimedia library with iTunes.
To ensure you have the latest version of iTunes, run Software Update, as described in
Chapter 4, or visit www.apple.com/itunes.

Import Music from CDs
1.
Insert a music CD into the disc drive on your computer.
2.
When iTunes opens, wait several seconds for iTunes to
obtain data — the data may include song titles, artist
names, and album titles — about the music CD.
If iTunes doesn’t obtain song data automatically, choose
Advanced➪Get CD Track Names. Your computer must be connected
to the Internet to obtain song data.
3.
Remove the check mark next to the songs you don’t
want to import. In Figure 12-1, the last song on the CD
was deselected.
4.
If you wish to manually modify a data field (such as
the song name or genre), click the field once to select
it, wait about two seconds, and then click it again.
Type a new entry.
5.
Click Import CD to import songs. In Figure 12-2,
the first song has been completely imported, and the
second song is in the process of being imported.
6.
After all the songs are imported, click the Eject Disc
button in the lower-right corner of the iTunes window.
When you start to import music, iTunes begins playing the imported
songs. The import occurs slightly faster if you stop playback.

4.
When you find a favorite radio station that you’ll want
to hear again later, click and drag the station to the
Radio Stations playlist in the Source Pane, as shown

Radio stations can be added to any playlist. If you don’t see a Radio
Stations playlist in your iTunes window, you can create one or cre-
ate new radio station playlists.
Most playback features — such as Next Track and Pause — don’t
work while listening to streaming Internet radio. Like broadcast radio,
you can only turn Internet radio on or off or adjust the volume.

Working with Third
Party MP3 Players
W
hen it comes to MP3 players, Macs and iPods seem to go hand-in-
hand. But lots of MP3 players are made by companies other than
Apple, and if you’re reading this chapter, you probably have one of these
third-party players.
Because you have one of these players, you may be wondering if it’s compat-
ible with your Mac, especially if the player’s instructions only tell you how
to use it with a Windows PC. Fortunately, most MP3 players can be used
with a Mac, although you probably can’t use iTunes for copying media files
and playlists directly to the player. Instead, you’ll have to use the Finder.
This chapter shows you how to
➟
Connect a third-party MP3 player to your Mac.
➟
Copy music files to the MP3 player.
➟
Create folders on the MP3 player in which to organize media.
➟
Delete music from the MP3 player.
The steps in this chapter apply to most third-party MP3 players, but it’s possible that your
particular player is uniquely incompatible with your Mac. Some players require propri-
etary software in order to access directories and copy files to the player. If you can’t seem
to follow the steps in this chapter with your MP3 player, check the manufacturer’s Web
site for special instructions or information regarding Mac compatibility. A few third-party
players actually support iTunes. If you connect the player to your computer and it
appears in the Devices list in iTunes, you should be able to use iTunes (see Chapter 12)
to manage media on the player.

Chapter

Connect the MP3 Player to Your Mac
1.
Connect the MP3 player to your Mac’s Universal Serial
Bus (USB) port.
2.
Look for the player’s icon to appear on your Desktop as
an Untitled disk volume, as shown in Figure 13-1.
If the MP3 player doesn’t appear, make sure the unit’s power is
turned on.
3.
Before disconnecting the MP3 player from your USB
port, drag its icon to the Trash icon on the Dock to
unmount the volume. When the MP3 player’s icon no
longer appears on the Desktop, the MP3 player can be
safely disconnected from the USB port.
Check for iTunes Compatibility
1.
To see if your MP3 player is compatible with iTunes,
first check the player’s documentation.
2.
If the documentation is unclear, visit the Web site:
docs.info.apple.com/article.html?
artnum=93548
This site lists some iTunes compatible players, as shown
in Figure 13-2.
3.
Visit the manufacturer’s Web site for OS X downloads
for your MP3 player.
Although some third-party MP3 players may work with iTunes, keep
in mind that unlike iPods — most other MP3 players — can’t play
AAC files. This means that songs purchased from the iTunes store
won’t work in most third-party MP3 players. For other music, con-
vert it to MP3 format before copying it to a third-party MP3 player.
Figure 13-1: Third-party MP3 players 
should appear as Untitled volumes.

Chapter 13: Working with Third Party MP3 Players

Copy Music Files to the Player
1.
Connect the MP3 player to your USB port.
2.
Launch iTunes and arrange the windows so that you can
see iTunes and the MP3 player icon at the same time, as
shown in Figure 13-3.
3.
Select the song or songs that you want to copy to the
player.
If you’re not sure whether a song’s format is compatible with your
MP3 player, select the song in iTunes and press Ô+I. An Info win-
dow opens, showing you information about the song, including the
file format. MP3 files should be compatible with any MP3 player,
but AAC files are usually compatible only with iPods. 
4.
Click and drag the songs to the MP3 player’s icon, as
shown in Figure 13-3. A progress window displays the
file copying progress.
5.
If you don’t use iTunes to organize your music, use the
Finder to copy files instead. Open a Finder window,
browse to the file you want to copy to the MP3 player,
and then click and drag the file to the MP3 player, as
shown in Figure 13-4.
You can also copy files from your MP3 player to your hard drive
with the Finder; simply drag and drop files from the player to a
hard drive folder to copy them. If some of the files are in WMA for-
mat, you must download and install Windows Media Player or
Flip4Mac, as described in Chapter 14.

Copy Music Files to the Player

Create Folders on the Player
1.
Connect the MP3 player to your USB port and then
double-click the player’s icon to begin browsing it in
the Finder.
2.
If the files are disorganized and scattered all over the
window — especially likely if the MP3 player has been
used on a Windows PC — choose View➪Clean Up, as
shown in Figure 13-5.
3.
To create a new folder, press Ô+Shift+N or choose File➪
New Folder.
4.
Type a new name for the folder, as shown in Figure 13-6.
5.
Use the Finder to copy files into the new folder, as
described in the preceding section.
6.
Unmount the MP3 player and disconnect it from the
USB port.
7.
Test the MP3 player to make sure that audio files placed
in subfolders are recognized and play properly. Some
MP3 players may not be able to play files that are placed
in subfolders.
Many MP3 players can be used as Thumb drives in a pinch. That is,
if you have some files, such as PowerPoint presentations or Pages
documents, and you need to quickly copy those files to another
computer, you can copy the files to the storage area on an MP3
player and then connect the MP3 player to the other computer to
retrieve the files.

Watching Videos
and DVDs
A
stroll around your local electronics store reveals a lot of cool digital
gadgets, including TVs, stereo systems, and DVD players. Thankfully,
you don’t need any of those things because you have a Mac. Every new
Macintosh comes with built-in DVD player hardware and software, and if
you have a laptop, your Mac even doubles as a really nice portable DVD
player.
Of course, DVDs aren’t the only kinds of videos that you’ll want to watch on
your Mac. You may also download videos from the Internet or you may
want to watch videos recorded by a digital camera or camera phone.
This chapter shows you how to watch DVDs on your Mac as well as how to
watch other types of video. This chapter focuses on three specific programs:
➟
DVD Player: As the name implies, this is the program that allows
your Mac to play movie DVDs.
➟
QuickTime: QuickTime is a popular program from Apple that
allows you to watch videos in various formats, including MPEG
and QuickTime video.
➟
Flip4Mac: This free program works as a plug-in for QuickTime
and allows you to watch most Windows Media Video (WMV) on
your Mac.

Viewing, Organizing,
and Improving
Pictures
I
t’s hard to imagine now how anyone ever got by without digital cameras.
Back in the days of film cameras, photo processing was expensive and
slow, and if you wanted to improve the quality of your photos, you had to
just shoot a lot of (expensive) pictures and become a better photographer.
A digital camera won’t make you a great photographer, but it will definitely
make your life easier. Not only can you snap many photos without worrying
about processing fees, but you can quickly copy your digital images to your
computer where they can be easily reshaped, retouched, and shared with
others via e-mail or the Internet.
This chapter shows you how to organize your photos with iPhoto, a pro-
gram included free with your Mac. In addition to organizing photos, iPhoto
can also make basic edits and improvements to photos. This chapter also
introduces you to Adobe Photoshop Elements, a slightly more advanced
photo editing program available for less than $100 for your Mac at most
Apple and computer retailers.
If you need an online home for sharing your digital photos with others over the Internet,
check out Chapter 9.

Making Movies
A
pple has been a pioneer in digital video for over a decade. In the
1990s, Apple helped develop the IEEE-1394 FireWire interface, a high-
speed data bus that allows high-quality digital video to be transferred
quickly between digital camcorders and computers. Apple also pioneered
software that helps you turn your raw video footage into a great movie with
titles, music, and special effects.
Every new Macintosh computer comes with a FireWire port and iMovie pre-
installed. The iMovie application allows you to import video from a digital
camcorder, assemble a movie with only the scenes you want, add sound and
video effects to your movie clips, and export your finished movie for viewing
over the Internet or back to videotape. And if your Mac has a SuperDrive,
you can also burn your movie straight to DVD.
This chapter shows you how to make movies with your digital camcorder
and iMovie. Tasks show you how to create a new movie project, capture
video from your camcorder, and turn your footage into a great movie. Tasks
also show you how to export your finished movie in a Web-friendly format
or burn it to DVD.
When buying a new camcorder, avoid cameras that use DVDs or mini DVDs as their
recording medium. DVD-based camcorders often lack FireWire ports and usually aren’t
Mac-compatible. Digital camcorders that use MiniDV tapes and have FireWire ports are
always Mac-compatible, and they offer the best balance of quality and value. For more
on making movies and working with iMovie, check out Digital Video For Dummies, 4th
Edition, by Keith Underdahl (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

Launch iMovie
1.
Click the iMovie HD icon on the Dock or double-click
the iMovie HD icon in the Applications folder.
You can also open iMovie by double-clicking an iMovie project file.
2.
Choose an option in the window, as shown in Figure
16-1. The options include
• Create a New Project: Choose this to create a new
movie from scratch. When you create a new project,
provide a name for the new project, as shown in
Figure 16-2. You can also choose a different format
by clicking the arrow next to Video Format and
choosing a different format, as shown in Figure 16-2.
The selection in the Video Format menu should match the format
recorded by your camera. Most consumer MiniDV cameras use the
DV format. If you’re importing video, the Video Format menu
should match the format of the file you wish to import.
• Open an Existing Project: Choose this to open a
movie that you worked on and saved. A dialog box
opens allowing you to browse to your movie project
file.
• Make a Magic iMovie: Choose this to let iMovie
automatically create a movie for you. Make sure your
camcorder is connected to your computer’s FireWire
port and turned on to Player or VTR mode before
choosing the Magic iMovie option.

Capture Video from a Camcorder
1.
Launch iMovie and create a new project, as described in
the preceding section.
2.
Connect your camcorder to your computer’s FireWire
port and make sure that the camcorder is turned on to
Player or VTR mode.
Some camcorders may use a different name for the FireWire port,
such as DV, IEEE-1394, or i.Link.
3.
In iMovie, move the control switch from Edit to Import.
The control switch is located below the main Preview window, and
has a camera icon on one side and a scissors icon on the other. Move
this switch to the camera icon to capture video, or to the scissor icon
to edit your movie.
4.
When the Preview screen turns blue and says Camera
Connected, as shown in Figure 16-3, click the Play but-
ton to start playing the tape in the camcorder.
5.
Use the playback controls to play, pause, fast forward,
and rewind the video to find scenes that you want to
capture.
6.
Rewind to slightly before the second of video that you
want to capture and then click the Import button on the
Preview screen. Captured video clips appear in the Clips
pane, as shown in Figure 16-4.
7.
Click Stop when you’re done capturing.

Assemble Clips into a Movie
1.
Open a movie project with captured video, as described
earlier in this chapter.
2.
If iMovie isn’t already in Editing mode, move the
Control slider to Edit (it looks like scissors).
3.
Click a clip in the Clips pane and then click Play below

If you want to split a clip in half, pause playback at
the point where you want to split the clip and then
choose Edit➪Split Video Clip at Playhead, as shown
in Figure 16-5.
5.
Click and drag video clips from the Clips pane to the
Clip Viewer at the bottom of the screen, as shown in
Figure 16-6.
If the bottom of your iMovie screen doesn’t look like the examples
shown here, you probably have the Timeline shown instead of the
Clip Viewer. Choose View➪Switch to Clip Viewer to switch to the Clip
Viewer. The Clip Viewer is the same thing as a storyboard, which is
the term used by many other video editing programs.
6.
To change the order of clips in the Clip Viewer, simply
click and drag the clips back and forth to new positions.
7.
To remove a clip from the movie, click and drag it back
to the Clips Pane.
If you drag clips to the Trash bin located in the lower-right corner of
the iMovie window, those clips are deleted from your hard drive the
next time the Trash is emptied. The iMovie Trash is emptied every
time you quit iMovie. If you want to use deleted clips in the future,
they must be re-captured from the video tape.

Networking
Wirelessly
with AirPort
N
ext to the World Wide Web, few technologies have revolutionized per-
sonal computing in recent years as much as wireless networking. With
Apple’s emphasis on ease-of-use, it comes as no surprise that Macs were
among the first computers to take advantage of networking with no strings
attached.
AirPort is Apple’s name for its wireless networking products. AirPort gear is
fully compatible with most other 802.11 (also sometimes called Wi-Fi) wire-
less networking technologies. Thus, your AirPort-equipped MacBook can
access the Internet through public hotspots, and Wi-Fi-equipped Windows
PCs can connect to your Apple AirPort access point.
This chapter shows you how to configure an AirPort access point to create your
own wireless network. It also shows you how to connect your computers —
both Windows PCs and Macs — to a wireless access point. This chapter also
shows you how to create a wireless ad hoc computer-to-computer network.
The steps for connecting a computer (whether a Mac or Windows PC) to a wireless access
point are the same regardless of whether the access point is an Apple AirPort unit or
another type of Wi-Fi access point. See Chapter 20 for more on setting up wireless net-
work security. For even more on wireless networking, check out Michael E. Cohen’s
AirPort and Mac Wireless Networks For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

Configure an AirPort Base Station
1.
Connect an Ethernet cable between your broadband
modem and the AirPort Base Station, if needed.
See the owner’s manual that comes with your Base Station for more
information on cable connections. Whatever cables you connect, the
power cord should be the last cable you connect.
2.
Plug in the power cable for the Base Station and wait
until the status light turns solid green.
3.
Open the Applications folder on your Mac and then
open the Utilities subfolder.
4.
Double-click the AirPort Utility icon, as shown in
Figure 17-1.
5.
If your AirPort Base Station appears on the left, select it
and then click Continue. Otherwise, choose Set Up a
New AirPort Base Station, and click Continue.
6.
When the Base Station is detected, click Continue.
If the Base Station isn’t detected, make sure that AirPort is enabled
on your Mac and make sure that the status light on the Base Station
is shining solid green. If the light is amber or is flashing, wait a few
more seconds. If after a minute it still doesn’t shine solid green,
unplug the Base Station for a few seconds and then plug it back in.
When the light shines solid green, click Try Again in the AirPort
Setup Assistant.
7.
Choose whether you want to create a new wireless net-
work, as shown in Figure 17-2, or connect the Base
Station to your existing wireless network.

8.
Click Continue and then enter names for Wireless
Network and the Base Station, as shown in Figure 17-3.
If you’re adding the Base Station to an existing network, the
Wireless Network Name should be the same as the rest of your net-
work. If you’re creating a new network, enter a unique, personal-
ized name for the network. Make sure that the Base Station’s name
is also descriptive, especially if you have more than one Base
Station. This name makes it easier to identify and manage the
device later.
9.
Click Continue and choose a security format, as shown
in Figure 17-4.
WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is the best type of security, but older
computers and devices (such as game consoles) may support only
WEP (Wired Equivalency Protocol). Use the highest level of security
that’s supported by the equipment you own. See Chapter 20 for
more on wireless network security.
10.
Click Continue and choose whether the AirPort Base
Station connects to a router or modem.
11.
Click Continue and choose how you connect to the
Internet. In most cases, you want to choose the first
option, which utilizes Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP).
12.
Enter a password for the Base Station. Keep this pass-
word safe because you’ll need it to make changes to the
Base Station later.
13.
Click Continue, verify the setup details, and click Update.
14.
After the Base Station restarts and the Congratulations
screen appears, click Quit. Setup is complete.
The steps described here are the same whether you have an AirPort
Express or AirPort Extreme Base Station.

Sharing Resources
T
he number one reason to set up a network is to share stuff among your
various computers. This “stuff” usually includes files, Internet connec-
tions, and printers. Sharing these resources is pretty easy, as is accessing
shared resources on other network computers.
Before you can share anything, your Mac must be properly connected to
the network. Chapter 17 shows you how to connect your Mac to a wireless
network, and this chapter shows you how to connect to a wired Ethernet
network. Ethernet networks aren’t quite as convenient as wireless networks,
but they offer greater reliability, security, and speed. All modern Macs
include adapters for connecting to Ethernet networks.
After you’re connected to a network, this chapter shows you how to share
printers, files, and Internet connections with the network. Steps also show
you how to access shared resources on other networked computers. This
chapter shows you how to network mainly with other Macintosh computers,
although many of the principles apply to Microsoft Windows computers as
well. See Chapter 19 for more on networking with Windows PCs.
Sharing Internet connections, as I describe in this chapter, is usually necessary only if you
have dialup Internet access. For example, if you access a dialup Internet service with the
modem in your Mac, you can share that connection with the rest of your network if you
wish. If you connect to the Internet with a cable modem or digital subscriber line (DSL),
the external modem for that service should be connected to the WAN (Wide Area
Network) port on your network’s router.

Chapter

Connect to an Ethernet Network
1.
Connect an Ethernet cable between the Ethernet port on
your Mac and a local area network (LAN) port on your
Ethernet switch, hub, or router.
If you need to buy new networking hardware, a router is the easi-
est to configure and provides the greatest flexibility.
2.
Restart your Mac and then open System Preferences
from the Apple menu.
3.
In System Preferences, click the Network icon.
4.
Select Built-in Ethernet, as shown in Figure 18-1, and
then click Advanced.
5.
On the TCP/IP screen, as shown in Figure 18-2, choose
Using DHCP in the Configure IPv4 menu.
6.
If a numeric IP address isn’t listed next to IP Address (as
shown in Figure 18-2), click Renew DHCP Lease.
7.
Click OK and then Apply to apply your changes.
To connect two computers together directly without using a hub or
router, use a special Ethernet cable — a crossover cable. Crossover
cables are available at most computer retailers. Keep crossover
cables clearly marked because they don’t work for connecting a
computer to a hub or router. Many newer Macs can connect directly
to each other with a regular network cable; check your Mac’s docu-
mentation to see if it has self-configuring ports.
If you want to access an Internet connection that’s shared by
another computer (see the section, “Share an Internet Connection,”
later in this chapter), follow the steps here to configure your net-
work connection. The Internet sharing server behaves like a
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server.
Figure 18-1: Choose Built-in Ethernet and click Advanced.

Chapter 18: Sharing Resources

Set an IP Address Manually
1.
Open System Preferences from the Apple menu and
then click the Network icon.
2.
Select Built-in Ethernet and click Advanced.
3.
On the TCP/IP screen, choose Manually in the
Configure IPv4 menu, as shown in Figure 18-3.
If your network uses a router or other DHCP server, but you still
need to assign an Internet Protocol (IP) address manually, choose
Using DHCP with Manual Address in the Configure IPv4 menu
instead.
4.
Type an IP address for your computer in the IPv4
Address field, as shown in Figure 18-4.
On a typical home network, the IP address starts with
192.168.0. The final segment can be any number between
0 and 255. Each computer on the network must have a unique
IP address. Check the documentation for your router or server soft-
ware to see if the IP address should be in a specific range. 
5.
Enter a Subnet Mask, which in almost all cases is
255.255.255.0.
6.
Enter the IP address for the router or server computer
on the network. If you don’t have a router, enter the IP
address for the computer that connects to the Internet.
7.
Click Apply Now and then close System Preferences.
These steps can also apply to AirPort connections and other types of
network connections, although usually those connections are con-
figured automatically.

I
t’s no secret that most PCs in the world run Windows. You may even have
some Windows PCs of your own. If so, there’s no reason why your Macs
and PCs can’t live together. Setting up a network between Windows PCs and
Macs takes only minutes; and after configured, you can easily share files,
printers, Internet connections, and other resources between the two.
This chapter shows you how to network between Macs and Windows PCs
with network hardware that’s already in place. The steps here assume that
you have
➟
Mac OS 10.2 or later. Computers running earlier versions of the Mac
OS can connect to Windows networks, but third-party software is nec-
essary. The steps here are based on OS 10.5 or later, but the proce-
dures for OS 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4 are similar. For information on
networking between newer and older Macs, see Chapter 22.
➟
Windows XP or better. If you have an older version of Windows, you
can follow the steps in this chapter to some extent, although some
procedures might vary slightly. Windows XP or later provides easier,
more secure networking.
➟
An Ethernet router or wireless network. For more on setting up
Macintosh networking hardware and software, see Chapters 17 and 18.

When you access a Windows hard drive from a Mac, the Mac OS
leaves system file fragments called resource forks on the Windows
hard drive. These files are unnecessary for the Windows operating
system and can be deleted safely after the Mac has disconnected
from the Windows PC. See the section on cleaning up resource forks
later in this chapter for steps to get rid of resource forks.

Networking Safely
C
onnecting your computer to a network brings added convenience to
your electronic life. Networks let you share files and printers, and
connect easily to the Internet. The Internet is the world’s largest network,
so every time you connect to it you’re networking.
But with the added convenience of networking comes some danger as well.
With networks, unsavory persons can steal your identity, violate your privacy,
access your sensitive files, and infect your computer with viruses. You can
avoid these dangers by taking some simple precautions, and this chapter
shows you how. This chapter shows you how to
➟
Create and use network locations. Network locations allow you to
quickly switch to a higher level of security when needed, such as when
you connect to a public Wi-Fi hotspot.
➟
Guard against intrusion with a firewall. Firewalls block unwanted
network and Internet intrusion into your computer.
➟
Keep unauthorized users off your wireless network. By changing
and hiding your SSID (Service Set Identifier), setting up WEP (good)
or WPA (better) encryption, and fine-tuning your wireless transmitter
power you can prevent neighbors and passers-by from accessing your
network and using your Internet connection.
➟
Encrypt files. OS X includes tools to help you encrypt your most
sensitive files for added protection.

Connecting to
Bluetooth Devices
I
f you’ve been using computers for a while, you’re probably familiar with
the rat’s nest of wires that results when computers and peripherals are
connected together. These wires are messy, inconvenient, and prone to loss
or breakage. Bluetooth is a technology designed to reduce the clutter and
inconvenience of wiring by connecting electronic devices wirelessly. Wireless
cell phone headsets are the most common Bluetooth devices, but other
Bluetooth peripherals include keyboards, mice, handheld computers, GPS
antennas, and more. You can even create wireless networks between comput-
ers using Bluetooth, although the short range of Bluetooth (usually less than
ten meters) makes Bluetooth best suited for peripherals.
Most modern Macs come with Bluetooth technology built-in. This chapter
shows you how to
➟
Make your computer discoverable, an important step in connecting to
Bluetooth peripherals.
➟
Enable Bluetooth networking so that you can create a temporary
Bluetooth network with another computer.
➟
Create connections — called partnerships — between your computer
and Bluetooth devices.

A
pple is always trying to convince Windows users to switch over to Mac,
but a lot of us have already been using Macs for a while. Just because
you upgrade to a new Macintosh running OS X Leopard, you don’t have to
abandon your older Macs to the bone yard. Leopard gets along just fine with
computers running older versions of the Macintosh operating system.
This chapter shows you how to network with your older Macs, whether they’re
running an older version of Macintosh OS X or even a Classic version, such
as OS 9 or earlier. Tasks show you how to connect to your older Macs from
Leopard as well as how to connect to a computer running Leopard from your
older Macs. Steps also show you how to set up the network hardware for older

Chapter 22: Networking with Older Macs

Upgrading Your Mac
You’ve probably heard people scoff at the seemingly high price of new
Macintosh computers. But Apple packs almost every new Macintosh with
a lot of standard features that would be costly options on most Windows PCs.
These features include built-in wireless networking, Bluetooth, IEEE-1394
FireWire, and enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to ensure good computer
performance. If you check the price of a Windows PC that contains all these
features, you might find that the Macintosh is actually the better bargain.
Of course, if your Mac is a year or two old, it might lack features like Bluetooth.
And no matter how new your Mac is, you might find that you want a little
more storage space, screen real estate, or extra RAM to improve the performance
and utility of your computer. This chapter shows you how to
➟
Add an external Bluetooth adapter to a Mac not equipped inter-
nally with Bluetooth. (See Chapter 21 for more on using Bluetooth.)
➟
Connect to a second monitor. The second monitor may simply be
another monitor to give you more onscreen Desktop space, or it may
be a multimedia projector.
➟
Add external storage space. If you work with video or need lots of
storage space, you can easily attach an external USB or FireWire hard
drive to your computer.
➟
Upgrade your computer’s memory. The easiest way to improve the
performance of your computer is to install more RAM.

➟
Chapter

Add an External Bluetooth Adapter
1.
Purchase a Bluetooth adapter that is Macintosh-
compatible.
Choose an external Bluetooth adapter that connects to a USB port.
Internal PCI-card Bluetooth adapters aren’t compatible with most
Macs.
2.
Start the computer and then connect the Bluetooth
adapter to any open USB port, as shown in Figure 23-1.
Mac OS 10.2 or better is required for Bluetooth compatibility. With
OS 10.2 or better, Bluetooth software is built-in. See Chapter 21 for
more on configuring Bluetooth devices.
Connect to a Second Monitor
1.
Connect the appropriate display adapter to your com-
puter, if necessary, and connect all displays to the com-
puter. Make sure each display is powered on.
New MacBooks, MacBook Pros, and iMacs come with DVI-to-VGA
adapters for installing a second monitor. Mac Pros include two DVI
display connectors.
2.
Open System Preferences and then click the Displays
icon.
3.
If a separate window for each display doesn’t appear,
as shown in Figure 23-2, click Detect Displays.
Figure 23-1: Connect the adapter to any spare USB port.
Figure 23-2: You should see a separate Preferences window for each display.
➟
218
Chapter 23: Upgrading Your Mac

Add External Storage
1.
Select an external hard drive that is compatible with your
computer.
2.
Connect the external drive to your computer’s FireWire or
USB port, as appropriate.
USB hard drives are more common, but FireWire (IEEE-1394) hard
drives usually offer better performance. If you plan to use the exter-
nal drive for video editing, choose a FireWire drive.
3.
If the drive is formatted using the FAT32 file system (check
the drive’s documentation), but you don’t plan to use the
drive with any Windows PCs, open the Applications folder
and then open the Utilities folder. Double-click the Disk
Utility icon, select the external hard drive in the list of
drives, and click Partition. Choose Mac OS Extended in
the Format menu, as shown in Figure 23-3, and click
Partition in the lower-right corner. Follow the instructions
onscreen to complete the partitioning.
Partitioning erases all data on the drive. Re-partitioning the drive
using the Mac OS Extended file system makes the drive perform more
efficiently in OS X, but after you do this, you can’t connect the drive
directly to a Windows PC. Stick with the FAT32 file system if you plan
to routinely switch the drive back and forth between your Mac and
Windows PC.
4.
When partitioning is complete, the drive’s icon appears
on your desktop, as shown in Figure 23-4. Double-click
the icon to browse the drive.
Before you disconnect an external hard drive from your Mac, drag
the drive’s icon to the Trash to properly unmount the drive from your
computer.

Add External Storage

Install More RAM
1.
Shut down your computer. If you have a laptop, remove
the battery.
2.
Purchase the correct type of RAM for your computer.
The owner’s manual for your Mac should tell you the exact format,
capacity, and type of RAM that should be used in your computer.
Only use RAM that’s positively identified as being compatible with
your specific Mac.
3.
Locate the RAM slot on your computer:
• Pre-Intel laptops: Remove the keyboard and
then remove the RAM access panel, as shown in
Figure 23-5. 
• Intel-based laptops: Remove the access panel and L-
bracket inside the battery compartment. 
• iMacs and eMacs: Open the RAM access panel on the
bottom or back of the chassis, depending on the
exact model you have.
• PowerMacs and Mac Pros: Remove the side cover for
the computer case and locate the RAM slots on the
motherboard.
If you have a Mac mini, RAM is less easy to install. You must care-
fully pry off the top cover with a putty knife and then remove the
upper portion of the chassis to access the memory slot. This isn’t a
simple task and is best left to an Apple repair specialist.
4.
Carefully insert the RAM card, as shown in Figure 23-6,
making sure that the connector pins and plastic guides
line up perfectly.
5.
Secure the retention clips and reassemble your computer.
Figure 23-5: The RAM slot on some Apple laptops is under 
the keyboard.

Installing and Using
Windows Programs
N
ot so long ago, writing about Microsoft Windows in a book about
Macs would’ve been like school on Saturday: No class. But OS X
Leopard introduces a powerful new feature called Boot Camp, which allows
you to install and run Microsoft Windows on any Macintosh computer that
has an Intel processor chip.
“Why would I want to install Windows on a perfectly good Mac?” might be
your first question. In most cases, installing Windows will be a matter of
need rather than want. Many software companies still develop products only
for Windows, and you may need to run some of those programs for your
work or personal needs. To install Windows on your Mac you need
➟
A Macintosh computer running OS 10.5 Leopard and an Intel
processor chip.
➟
10 GB of free hard drive space for the Windows installation. More
space may be needed (I recommend at least 20 GB), depending on the
requirements of the Windows programs that you want to install.
➟
A Microsoft Windows installation disc. It must be a single disc full
version (upgrade discs won’t work) of Windows XP (with SP2). As of
this writing, Windows Media Center Edition and Windows Vista aren’t
supported by Boot Camp.
This chapter shows you how to install and run Windows on your Mac.
Remember, even though you’ll be running Windows on stable Macintosh
hardware, the Windows installation will still be susceptible to Windows
viruses and bugs.

CD and keep it in a safe place. You’ll need it later. If you have sev-
eral different Intel-based Macintosh computers, create a separate
driver disc for each one and mark each disc to identify the computer
with which it should be used.
3.
When the Create a Second Partition screen appears, as
shown in Figure 24-1, click and drag the slider left or
right to give the Windows partition more space.
4.
Click Partition to start partitioning the hard disk.
