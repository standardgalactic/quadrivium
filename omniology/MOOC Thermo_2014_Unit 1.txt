What is thermodynamics all about??? 
 
This course will provide you with an introduction to the most 
powerful engineering principles you will ever learn: 
thermodynamics! Or the science of transferring energy from one 
place or form to another place or form.  We will introduce the tools 
you need to analyze energy systems from solar panels, to engines, 
to insulated coffee mugs. 
  
More specifically, we will cover the topics of mass and energy 
conservation principles; first law analysis of control mass and 
control volume systems; properties and behavior of pure 
substances; and applications to thermodynamic systems operating 
at steady state conditions.  
 

Course objectives: 
To make familiarize you with the basic concepts, 
devices, and properties used in thermal science 
To teach the behavior of a simple pure substances 
including solid, liquid, and gas phases 
To teach how to evaluate energy, work and heat 
transfers processes 
To teach the conservation laws for mass and energy for 
various physical systems 
To teach application of process knowledge to the 
analysis of complete systems 
  

Course Outcomes: 
Identify different subsystems, indicate where there is work, heat transfer 
and the importance of temperature, pressure and density  
Given a set of properties, identify the correct phase and remaining 
properties for a substance  
Given a physical setup, determine the associated work and heat transfers 
that are the most reasonable approximations  
Given a physical device and process, compute the work and heat transfer 
Given a physical setup, formulate the ideal approximation to the 
behavior and compute the corresponding work and heat transfer  
Given an actual device, analyze the corresponding ideal device  
Understanding how energy processes affect the environment

Frequently asked questions: 
 
What are the prerequisites for taking this course? An introductory background (high 
school or first year college level) in chemistry, physics, and calculus will help you be 
successful in this class.    
 
What will this class prepare me for in the academic world? Thermodynamics is required 
for many follow-on courses, like heat transfer, internal combustion engines, propulsion, 
and gas dynamics to name a few. 
 
What will this class prepare me for in the real world? Energy is one of the top 
challenges we face as a global society.  Energy demands are deeply tied to the other 
major challenges of clean water, health, and poverty.  Understanding how energy 
systems work is key to understanding how to meet all these needs around the world.  
Because energy demands are only increasing, this course also provides the foundation 
for many rewarding professional careers.

Small improvements in 
combustion of fossil fuels can 
have huge impact on carbon 
reduction; compare to doubling 
the contributions of renewable 
resources in the global energy 
portfolio, yet renewables are 
vital to long term energy

Energy use by sector 
Different energy sectors 
have dramatically different 
needs: transient propulsion 
systems, high heating rates 
for manufacturing, etc. 
 
There is no silver bullet, no 
one-fuel, no one method 
solution.   

What energy sector has the most demanding requirements for 
transient energy, i.e. energy demands that change as a 
function of time? 

Unit 1 Segment 4 

What energy sector has the most demanding requirements for 
transient energy, i.e. energy demands that change as a 
function of time? 
You might think of seasonal changes for heating or cooling or 
even daily cycles, like changes in manufacturing production 
during the day and evening shifts.  Now consider the power 
demands from a passenger vehicle! 

Thermodynamics is the study of energy and the 
interaction of energy with matter. 

Heat transfer is how energy is transferred when 
there is a temperature difference.  

Fluid mechanics is the motion of fluids (which 
includes gases and liquids) and the 
transformation of energy between mechanical 
and thermal forms. 

Terminology and definitions: 
System -  the object(s) under consideration 
A closed systems is also called a control mass. 
  Mass can not cross the system boundary. 
 There is a fixed quantity of matter in the 
system. 
 
An open systems is also called a control volume. 
 Mass can cross the system boundary. 
 The amount of matter within the control 
volume can change.  

Is the coffee in your thermos or mug best described as a control 
mass or control volume? 
 
Is the CPU in your computer best described as a  control mass or 
control volume? 

Unit 1 Segment 5 

Is the coffee in your thermos or mug best 
described as a control mass or control 
volume? 
That depends.  Is the system the coffee or the 
cup?  Is the coffee being poured into the cup?   
Is the CPU in your computer best described as a  
control mass or control volume? 
That depends.  Is the system the CPU or the air 
used to cool the CPU?    
Sometimes the system is obvious.  Other times 
it can be more challenging to define. 
 

Properties – describe the characteristics of the 
system 
Thermodynamic properties – describe the 
thermal properties of the system 
State – the condition of the system as described 
by the system thermodynamic properties 
Steady state means the system properties are 
not changing as a function of time 
 

Extensive properties – depend on the extent (or 
amount) of material in the system; these are 
properties that are additive, like mass 
Intensive properties – do NOT depend on the 
extent (or amount) of material in the system; 
these are properties which are NOT additive, 
like temperature 
Equilibrium – when the system is unchanging 
in terms of thermal, mechanical, phase and 
chemical characteristics 
Process – a path between two states 
 

Introduction to some properties 
Density = mass per unit volume = ρ = 1/v 
Specific volume = volume per unit mass = v = 1/ρ 
Pressure (absolute and relative)  
Temperature  

You should have seen some of these properties before.  What are 
the units of density, specific volume, pressure and 
temperature? 
 
What category of properties are density, specific volume, 
pressure and temperature?  Intensive or extensive? 
 

Unit 1 Segment 6 

You should have seen some of these properties before. 
What are the units of density, specific volume, 
pressure and temperature? 
The answers will vary based on which system of units 
you choose, SI or British.  Here are some examples: 
density [kg/m3], specific volume [m3/kg], pressure 
[kPa] or [atm], temperature [oC ] or [K] 
What category of properties are density, specific 
volume, pressure and temperature?  Intensive or 
extensive? 
Every one of these properties are intensive properties. 

Units are critical to thermodynamics analysis and they 
are a HUGE asset.

Energy in closed systems: 
 
kinetic energy = K.E.  
 
 
 
potential energy = P.E. 
 
 

Work – energy transfer across the system 
boundary  
Work transfer is not a system property. 
Work transfer depends on the process path. 
There are many types or forms of work tranfser.

process look like on a pressure-volume 
diagram?
