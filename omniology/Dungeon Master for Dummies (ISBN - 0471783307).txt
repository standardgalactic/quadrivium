About the Authors
Bill Slavicsek began playing the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS roleplaying game with
his friends during his formative teenage years in New York City. This was in
1977, the same year that Star Wars and Sword of Shannara debuted. This tril-
ogy of epic fantasy combined with comic books and horror novels were to
forever influence Bill’s outlook on life and entertainment. In 1986, Bill’s hobby
became his career when he joined the staff of West End Games. There, as an
editor and game designer, Bill worked on a number of board games and role-
playing games, including Ghostbusters, Paranoia, Star Wars: The Roleplaying
Game, and Torg: Roleplaying the Possibility Wars. Later, Bill went on to use his
vast knowledge of the Star Wars films and associated extensions to write two
editions of A Guide to the Star Wars Universe for Lucasfilm, Ltd., and pub-
lished by Del Rey Books. 
In 1993, Bill joined the staff of TSR, Inc., then publishers of the DUNGEON &
DRAGONS game lines, as a game designer and editor. His design credits for the
company include the ALTERNITY Science Fiction Game (which he co-designed
with Richard Baker), the d20 Modern Roleplaying Game, the d20 Star Wars
Roleplaying Game, the Star Wars Miniatures Game, Urban Arcana, Council of
Wyrms, and the EBERRON Campaign Setting. 
Since 1997, Bill has been the Director of Roleplaying Games Research and
Development for Wizards of the Coast, Inc., the company that now publishes
all DUNGEONS & DRAGONS novels and game products. He oversaw the creation of
the d20 Roleplaying Game System and the newest edition of the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game. Bill leads a talented staff of game designers, developers, and
editors who produce award-winning game products for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
and other d20 System game lines, including roleplaying game supplements
and accessories, adventures and campaign books, and prepainted plastic
miniatures. He lives with his wife Michele, two cats, and more comics, toys,
and books than he knows what to do with — and that’s okay by him. 
Richard Baker is an award-winning game designer and a best-selling author.
He’s worked on the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game lines since 1991. Rich traces his
D&D experience back to 1979, when he began playing the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game as a 7th-grader. He spent a significant amount of his high school and
college years playing D&D at every opportunity, and after serving as a sur-
face warfare officer in the United States Navy, Rich decided to take a shot at
working on the game he grew up playing — and so he joined the staff of TSR,
Inc., and became a game designer. 
Rich’s list of D&D design credits numbers over 50 game products, including
the Origins Award-winning BIRTHRIGHT Campaign Setting, the ALTERNITY Science
Fiction Roleplaying Game (which he co-designed with Bill Slavicsek), and the
newest edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. He has also served as cre-
ative director for the ALTERNITY and FORGOTTEN REALMS game lines. As an author,

Rich has published eight fantasy and science fiction novels, including City of
Ravens, Forsaken House, and the New York Times bestseller Condemnation.
Rich is currently employed as a senior game designer at Wizards of the Coast,
Inc., and works every day on new products for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game.
He married his college sweetheart, Kim, in 1991; they have two daughters,
Alex and Hannah. When he isn’t writing (a rare occurrence), Rich likes to hike
in the Cascades, play wargames, and root for the Philadelphia Phillies — who
just don’t seem to be getting any better, darn it.  
Dedication
Bill Slavicsek: To DMs everywhere, past, current, and future. The world
needs you, now more than ever. Dream it up, play it, and have fun!
Richard Baker: To Kim, Alex, and Hannah for putting up with a lot of work in
evenings and on weekends for many months now. “Understanding” is an
understatement.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Many exceptional people have contributed to the D&D game. We’d like to say
a word of thanks to the game designers and editors who helped us to get
started in this business, including Jim Ward, Kim Mohan, Zeb Cook, Jeff
Grubb, Steve Winter, Bruce Nesmith, Tim Brown, Troy Denning, Roger Moore,
Ed Greenwood, Harold Johnson, Andrea Hayday, Jon Pickens, Skip Williams,
Bill Connors, and especially Dave Sutherland. Dave passed away a few
months before this book published, but millions of D&D fans know and love
his monster illustrations and dungeon maps from the earliest days of the
game, most of all the 1st Edition Monster Manual. We both worked with Dave
on many D&D projects in our early days at TSR. We’re going to miss him.
We owe a special thank you to the folks at Wizards of the Coast who worked
so hard to breathe fresh life into the D&D game, including Peter Adkison,
Ryan Dancey, Skaff Elias, Lisa Stevens, and many others. 
We’ve had the pleasure of playing in many D&D games over the years, so it
seems especially appropriate to thank the folks who have been our own
Dungeon Masters over the years. Rich would like to thank Bud Stiles, Greg
Wingo, Thomas Reid, John Rateliff, Ed Stark, Warren Wyman, and Dave
Noonan. Bill wants to say hi to his Thursday Night Game Group, past and pre-
sent, which has included such players as Michele Carter, Jeff Grubb, John
Rateliff, Chris Perkins, Ed Stark, Thomas Reid, Larry Weiner, Stephen Schend,
Dale Donovan, Cindy Rick, David Wise, Lester Smith, and others who played
an adventure or two or stuck around for entire campaigns. Thanks!

Bill Slavicsek: The current edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game owes its
existence to a lot of talented people. The work that Rich and I have done on
this For Dummies book would not have been possible if not for the original
effort of a formidable team of creatives and business people. Peter Adkison,
for purchasing TSR, Inc., merging its products and staff with Wizards of the
Coast, Inc., and providing the vision for what the new edition of the game
would be. My creative team on the massive re-design project, which included
Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, Skip Williams, Richard Baker, Kim Mohan, Julia
Martin, John Rateliff, Ed Stark, Dawn Murin, Todd Lockwood, and Sam Wood.
The business team, past and present, who help bring D&D products to
market, which includes Ryan Dancey, Keith Strohm, Cindy Rice, Mary
Kirchoff, Anthony Valterra, Chris Toepker, Liz Schuh, Mary Elizabeth Allen,
Charles Ryan, Kevin Wilson, Linae Foster, and Scott Rouse.
I have to acknowledge the efforts of my current staff. This amazing collection
of designers, developers, and editors work everyday to push the envelope
and expand the horizons of our products, and as much as I lead them, they
influence the way I think about and approach game design and D&D. Every
part of this For Dummies book owes at least a little to the ideas and work of
Richard Baker, Michele Carter, Andy Collins, Bruce Cordell, Jesse Decker,
Michael Donais, Rob Heinsoo, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, Stacy Longstreet, Mike
Mearls, Kim Mohan, David Noonan, Christopher Perkins, John Rateliff,
Stephen Schubert, Matthew Sernett, Ed Stark, Chris Thomasson, Rob
Watkins, Jennifer Clarke Wilkes, and James Wyatt.
Finally, thanks to everyone at Wiley Publishing who worked with us on this,
including Melody Layne, Jean Rogers, and Virginia Sanders, and to everyone at
Wizards of the Coast, Inc., who help us make great games on a regular basis.
Richard Baker: Many people of exceptional creativity have worked on the
D&D game over the years. Without the work of game designers, editors, and
artists such as Gary Gygax, Dave Arneson, Jim Ward, Kim Mohan, Zeb Cook,
Jeff Grubb, Steve Winter, Bruce Nesmith, Tim Brown, Troy Denning, Roger
Moore, Ed Greenwood, Mike Carr, Harold Johnson, Andrea Hayday, Jon
Pickens, Lawrence Schick, Skip Williams, Dave Sutherland, Jeff Easley, Larry
Elmore, and countless others, D&D would not have grown into the beloved
hobby of millions of fans across the world. Countless other authors, artists,
developers, and editors have contributed over the years; we’re sorry that we
can’t thank them all. 
A special thank you to good friends and colleagues who have shared in the
authors’ own D&D games over the years. Rich would like to thank Ed Stark,
John Rateliff, David Eckelberry, Shaun and Miranda Horner, David Wise,
Thomas Reid, David Noonan, James Wyatt, Warren Wyman, Duane Maxwell,
Andy Weedon, Dale Donovan, Bud Stiles, Thomas Chatburn, Tom Herrington,
Doug McNichol, Gary Canter, and Clayton Ball. My games have been the
better thanks to your participation.

Foreword
W
elcome to the next level.
Bill Slavicsek and Richard Baker put together the original Dungeons &
Dragons For Dummies book with an eye toward making D&D, an intriguing
and complex system, more accessible and friendly to both first-time players
and long-term fans. Now they’re back, ready to take on an even greater 
challenge.
The art of Dungeon Mastery.
Being a DM is a quantum leap up from merely playing the game. You aren’t
keeping track of a single character but rather coordinating a full-fledged
world. You’re not worrying just about what is behind the next door but about
how the epic adventure will ultimately resolve. You have to be ready for any-
thing that a group of creative, inventive, and downright devious players will
throw at you over the course of a game session. You are host, team leader,
narrator, head bad guy, playwright, supporting cast, ringleader, and ringmas-
ter, all at the same time.
It is a very tall order, and Bill and Rich put it all together in one package 
for you.
I can personally vouch for Bill’s DM credentials. For the past few years, a
group of us creative types, present and former members of Wizards of the
Coast, have gathered at his house every Thursday night for our weekly game.
Bill has used us as a test-bed for new projects he has worked on, including the
Star Wars RPG, d20 Modern, and most recently the newest D&D campaign set-
ting, EBERRON. Yes, we get to play the first drafts (and take the initial lumps) of
the new systems. It’s a tough job, and Bill makes it a heckuva lot of fun.
Rich is no slouch in the DM department either, as an author and game
designer with world-building credentials from way back, including most
recently managing Wizard of the Coast’s sprawling, chaotic, eternal cam-
paign, the FORGOTTEN REALMS. Oh, and in one of his first projects, for a D&D-in-
space campaign called SPELLJAMMER, he put battleship guns on an asteroid and
took it out for a spin. So he thinks outside the box as well as any devious
player.

Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies gives you a box of tools. Dungeon Master
For Dummies shows you what you can build with those tools. Dungeons &
Dragons For Dummies gives you a rainbow of paints. Dungeon Master For
Dummies shows you what you can portray with those paints. Dungeons &
Dragons For Dummies opens the door to a new world. Dungeon Master For
Dummies goes through that door, and shows you how to create your own
worlds and delight and entertain your players. It is the next level of play.
Enjoy.
Jeff Grubb
Co-founder of the DRAGONLANCE campaign setting and co-creator of the
FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting, Jeff is the author of over a dozen novels,
two dozen short stories, and more game products than is either polite or
proper to mention. His most recent characters in Bill’s Thursday Night
Games have been Gomez the gnome artificer, Moondog Greenberg the kabal-
istic biker, and Whappamanga the Wookiee.
Dungeon Master For Dummies

Introduction
T
he DUNGEONS & DRAGONS roleplaying game has been exciting and expanding
the imaginations of players around the world for more than 30 years. The
key components to a good (or better yet, great) game of D&D include enthusi-
astic players, a fun adventure, and a good (or better yet, great) Dungeon
Master. The Dungeon Master (also known as the DM) applies imagination,
game rules, and creative flair to make every game session fun and memorable
for the entire game group. Indeed, DMs firmly believe that the role they take
on in the D&D game provides the most rewarding, creative, and fun experi-
ence available.
It’s good to be the DM!
We’ve carefully crafted this book to make the role of Dungeon Master more
accessible to D&D players. Not everyone has the temperament and mindset —
or the desire — to be the DM for a gaming group. But if the idea of creating
scenarios or even entire worlds of adventure for your friends appeals to you,
you owe it to yourself to explore the role of the DM.
And, if you’re already DMing for your gaming group, the hints and tips layered
throughout this book will help you become a better DM . . . perhaps even a
great DM. Goodness knows that the D&D game — and the world, really —
needs more great DMs.
About This Book
We wrote this book because the nice folks at Wiley Publishing, Inc., liked our
previous one (Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies) and they asked us to write
another. But we also wrote it because we have a passion for the D&D game,
and we want to share that love with as many people as possible. We wrote in
our previous For Dummies book that the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game speaks to
and feeds the human condition. As a game of the imagination, D&D builds on
the myths and fantasies that shape our culture. In an age when so many activ-
ities involve isolated people, D&D is a social experience. Nothing else — no
computer game, no board game, no movie — comes close to delivering the
interactive and unlimited adventure of the D&D experience.
It’s the Dungeon Master who makes much of that creative, social, and interac-
tive experience possible. Simply put, you can’t play the D&D roleplaying game
without a Dungeon Master. The DM is essential, and a good DM is worth his
or her weight in gold pieces!

2
Dungeon Master For Dummies 
Even if you’ve run a hundred games, this book provides the advice you need
to expand your gaming techniques. Experienced Dungeon Masters will find
hints, tips, and advice designed to elevate your game to new levels: From
improving your game sessions to creating adventures and crafting cam-
paigns, we cover it all. If you’ve never run a game as the DM, this book is a
great place to start. We explain the ins and outs of Dungeon Mastering and
offer plenty of advice on how to become the best DM you can be.
Why You Need This Book
New Dungeon Masters need this book because it’s written by D&D experts to
serve as a comprehensive guide for DMing. Before this book, great Dungeon
Masters had to be born with an innate knack for the role. Sure, books like the
D&D Dungeon Master’s Guide provide some level of advice, but none of them
have been written as training manuals, and none of them have been written
in a straightforward, direct manner (the For Dummies style).
With this book, you’ll discover facts about running the D&D game that many
seasoned DMs have never realized. Do you know how to build balanced
encounters to best challenge your party? Do you know the tricks to keeping
a game session moving? Do you know how to wing it when your players try
something really unexpected? How do you make a ruling when they try some-
thing that goes beyond the boundaries of the game? Thanks to our years of
experience and our unprecedented access to the Wizards of the Coast’s
Research and Development department, we’ve filled this book with insider
knowledge and examples that can’t help but make you the best DM you can be.
Seasoned Dungeon Masters can always be made better, and we try to share
our knowledge and experience in every chapter of this book. The D&D game
is as unlimited as the imaginations of its players, and something fresh and
new is always waiting to be discovered. We shine a light in all the myriad cor-
ners of the game to help you find details you never knew were there, or at
least remind you of something you haven’t used in a while. We want to make
you a better DM because better DMs make for better games.
How to Use This Book
You can use this book in many ways. You can read it cover to cover, in chapter
order, and follow along with our loose narrative that explains the concepts of
Dungeon Mastering from the basics to the most advanced applications of the
role. Alternatively, you can glance at the Table of Contents and jump around to
the chapters that most interest you. That works fine, too.

If you’re new to the idea of being the Dungeon Master, we suggest starting
with Part I. It helps explain the DM’s role more fully and provides the founda-
tion for the chapters and parts that follow. If you’ve run a few game sessions,
explore the information in Part I to see whether you’re fully utilizing the
tricks and tools available to you. Then move on to Part II to take your DM
style to the next level. If you’re an old pro, jump to whatever section of the
book strikes your interest. Even in chapters that seem below your level of
experience, we bet you’ll find something new and fresh to try at the gaming
table. And we’re sure that everyone will find something exciting and fun in
the Part of Tens.
This book assumes you have at least some experience with the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game. If this isn’t the case, we suggest you start with this book’s
companion volume, Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies. You might also want
to buy the D&D Basic Game from Wizards of the Coast.
We wrote this book assuming that, as a somewhat experienced D&D player 
or DM, you have the core D&D game books — Player’s Handbook, Dungeon
Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. We refer to these volumes often through-
out these pages. This book isn’t a replacement for any of your D&D game
books; it’s a companion piece designed to make the information in those vol-
umes clearer and easier to understand, while adding new information specifi-
cally designed to make you a better Dungeon Master.
This book’s Cheat Sheet contains cardstock cutouts that feature tools to help
your D&D game run more smoothly and efficiently. The Character Cards can
be used to keep track of player characters in the game. The Monster Cards,
likewise, can be used to record monster statistics. Together, they make a
great resource for setting the initiative order and tracking any changes by
simply re-ordering the cards as combats unfold.
D&D Terminology
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, like other intensive activities, has a lot of
jargon that can sometimes make comprehension a bit tricky. We wrote this
book using as much plain language as possible, but you’re still going to need
to know some of the terms that long-time players take for granted.
Here’s a quick recap of a few common terms that we use over and over:
 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: The original roleplaying game of medieval fantasy
and adventure. In the game, players take on the role of imaginary charac-
ters defined by a series of statistics, cool powers, and magical abilities.
The game is played around a table or other comfortable location where
players can spread out books and papers and roll dice. D&D (the short
form of the name) is a game of the imagination, part group storytelling
3
Introduction

game and part wargame. There are no winners or losers in this game; the
point is to build an exciting fantasy story through the actions of the char-
acters and the challenges set forth by the Dungeon Master.
 Dungeon Master: One player is the Dungeon Master (the DM). Although
other players control single characters, the DM controls all the mon-
sters and enemies, narrates the action, referees the game, sets up the
adventures, and develops the campaign. Every D&D game needs a DM.
 Player character: The character controlled by a player is called a player
character (PC). A player character might be a powerful fighter, a sneaky
rogue, a crafty sorcerer, or a charismatic cleric, for example.
 Nonplayer character: A character controlled by the Dungeon Master is
called a nonplayer character (NPC). An NPC might be a friend, a hireling,
a merchant, or a villain, for example, that the player characters interact
with in some way.
 Adventure: The player’s character is an adventurer in a fantastic world
of magic and monsters. Other characters (controlled by other players)
join the adventuring party to explore dungeons and battle amazing crea-
tures such as dragons and trolls. Each quest (or mission, or story) is
called an adventure. An adventure might last for a single session of play
or stretch over the course of several game sessions.
 Campaign: The D&D game doesn’t have to end with a single adventure.
When the same characters continue from one adventure to another in an
ongoing storyline, the overall story is called a campaign.
 Dice: The D&D game uses dice to resolve actions and determine other
factors where the outcome isn’t certain. The twenty-sided die is the most
important, as all major actions in the game are resolved using it. The
game also uses a four-sided die, a six-sided die, an eight-sided die, a ten-
sided die, and a twelve-sided die. You often see abbreviations used for
dice where d is followed by the number of sides for that particular die,
such as d20, d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12. Sometimes you need to roll multiple
dice of a specific shape, such as four six-sided dice, which is abbreviated
as 4d6. Sometimes you need to roll multiple dice and add a modifier, such
as two four-sided dice plus two, which is abbreviated as 2d4+2.
 Player’s Handbook: The first of the three books that make up the rules
of the D&D game. This volume contains the basic rules of play and char-
acter creation. No D&D player should be caught without one.
 Dungeon Master’s Guide: The second of the three books that make up
the rules of the D&D game. This volume contains the information the
Dungeon Master needs to run the game, set up adventures, build cam-
paigns, and award treasure and experience to the player characters.
 Monster Manual: The third of the three books that make up the rules of
the D&D game. This volume is packed with monsters to challenge even
the toughest D&D heroes, and contains information that every player
and DM needs to know.

How This Book Is Organized
Dungeon Master For Dummies consists of five parts. The chapters within each
part cover specific topics in detail. In each chapter, we start with the basics of
the topic and build from there. Whenever a point needs further clarification,
we reference the appropriate chapter so you can immediately find any addi-
tional information you need. Whenever it comes up, we also refer you to the
appropriate place in one of the core D&D game books, or even in Dungeons &
Dragons For Dummies if we think something in that volume will help.
Part I: Running a Great Game
Dungeon Master, meet your game. Game, meet your Dungeon Master.
The chapters in this part assume you’re a new to moderately experienced
DM and provide all kinds of tips and methods for running and improving
your D&D game. This part also includes a sample dungeon you can use to
practice what we preach.
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering
The chapters in this part are designed to take your Dungeon Mastering skills
to the next level, with advanced discussion topics, techniques, and options.
Even experienced DMs can find something new and exciting in this part.
Part III: Creating Adventures
Ultimately, every DM wants to try his or her hand at creating an original
adventure. In this part, we provide advice and guidance on how to craft mem-
orable adventures, and we wrap up this part with another sample dungeon
that shows the techniques in action.
Part IV: Building a Campaign
This part explores methods for stringing individual adventures together to
create an ongoing campaign. Discussing themes, villains, and plots, we get to
the heart of what turns a series of adventures into a memorable and exciting
campaign.

Introduction

Part V: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without this section of top-ten lists. We
take this concept to a new level by presenting not only classic lists of the
best D&D adventures of all time, but by including encounters, maps, and
traps that you can use in your own D&D games.
Icons Used in This Book
To guide you along the way and to point out information you really need to
know, this book uses the following icons:
This icon points to tips and tricks that simplify or speed up some aspect of
DMing the D&D game.
Remember these important nuggets and you’ll be a better DM.
If you see this icon, read and follow the accompanying directions. This infor-
mation can prevent you from having a bad game session.
Whenever you see this icon, you know we’re directing you to more detailed
information in one of the D&D core rulebooks — the Player’s Handbook,
Dungeon Master’s Guide, or Monster Manual.
Where to Go from Here
We recommend starting with Part I, but feel free to turn to whatever chapters
interest you. Just remember to have fun! Approach this book in the spirit of
the D&D game, trust us and the wisdom we try to impart, and you’ll be well
on your way to becoming a DM or to improving the DMing skills you already
possess.

In this part . . .
T
his part of Dungeon Master For Dummies speaks to all
D&D Dungeon Masters. Whether you’re thinking about
running a game of D&D, have recently joined the ranks of
DM, or have a bit of DMing experience under your belt,
the chapters in this part provide all kinds of tips and tech-
niques for improving your D&D game. The final chapter in

practice tool to hone your DMing skills. (Plus, it’s a fun
adventure!)

Chapter 1
The Role of the Dungeon Master
In This Chapter
 Discovering the role of the Dungeon Master
 Finding what you need to play D&D
 Exploring the many expressions of Dungeon Mastering
 Understanding the goals of Dungeon Mastering
You know what DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is. It’s the original roleplaying game,
the game that inspired not only a host of other roleplaying games, 
but most computer roleplaying games as well. A roleplaying game allows 
players to take on the roles of characters in a story of their own creation.
Part improvisation, part wargame, the D&D game provides a wholly unique and
unequalled experience. For a game such as D&D to work, one of the players 
in a group must take on a fun, exciting, creative, and extremely rewarding 
role — the role of Dungeon Master.
Thanks to the presence of a Dungeon Master (DM), a D&D game can be more
interactive than any computer game, more open-ended than any novel or
movie. Using a fantastic world of medieval technology, magic, and monsters
as a backdrop, the DM has the power of the game mechanics and the imagi-
nation of all the players to work with. Whatever anyone can imagine can
come to life in the game, thanks to the robust set of rules that are the heart 
of the D&D game. The rules and imagination can take your game only so far,
however. The heights your game can reach and the fun you can have with it
depend on the creativity and involvement of the Dungeon Master.
Do you have a burning desire to create adventures or even entire D&D worlds?
Do you enjoy being at the center of the action, helping your friends have a rol-
licking good time? Then maybe the role of Dungeon Master is right for you.
In this chapter, we look at the role of the Dungeon Master and see how a good
DM makes for a good game of D&D. 

What Is a DM?
A Dungeon Master is one of the players in a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game group.
The other players each create a single character and use that character to
interact with the imaginary world depicted in the game, but the DM plays a
pivotal role that goes beyond that of the other players. In short, the Dungeon
Master runs the game. You can get along without a fighter or a rogue or a
cleric character, at least for a game session or two, but you can’t play a game
of D&D without a DM.
Because the D&D game is as wide open as the imaginations of the players, the
presence of a DM to act as a moderator, story designer, and narrator is essen-
tial. The players interact with each other and the imaginary environment
through the actions of their characters, and the DM describes each scene,
directs the action, and plays the roles of the monsters, villains, and all the
other people (the butcher, the baker, and the innkeeper, for example) that the
characters meet on every adventure.
As the DM, you aren’t competing against the players. You set up interesting,
exciting, even challenging situations, and then use the game rules to fairly
and impartially allow events to play out. You don’t know how things are going
to turn out, and neither do the players. That’s one of the elements that makes
the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game so much fun. When you and the players get
together to play out a compelling group story, everybody wins!
So You Want to Be the Dungeon Master?
The Dungeon Master (or DM) plays a special role in the D&D game. The DM
controls the pace of the story and referees the action as it unfolds. The
power of creating worlds and controlling dragons resides in the hands of the
DM. As DM, you are the master of the game. The rules, the setting, the action,
and ultimately the fun all radiate from you. Sounds like something you just
have to do? Well, being the DM involves having a great deal of power. We
show you how to use that power wisely and with great responsibility so that
you and the other players have a fun experience.
We also show you that the role of DM doesn’t have to mean a lot of work and
hardship. The fun, excitement, creativity, and decision making of running a
game session are in your hands. We provide plenty of tips and shortcuts to
help you along the way. Although Dungeon Mastering can sometimes be as
easy as showing up to the game (just like the other players), more often than
not the DM has to do a little bit of upfront preparation so that the game ses-
sion unfolds smoothly. With our hints and techniques, it can look as though
you spent hours working on your adventure. Granted, some DMs do spend
hours on their craft, creating the adventure before the game session, and
that’s a big part of the fun for them. But for those of you like us, who don’t

Part I: Running a Great Game 

have a lot of free time to devote to our roles as DMs, we think you’ll appreci-
ate the time-saving suggestions we provide in this book.
So you want to be the Dungeon Master? From the moment we saw the origi-
nal Dungeon Master’s Guide lo those many years ago, so did we. So come
along. You’re in good company!
What Do You Need for Playing?
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game has few requirements but lots of options. In
addition to players, a Dungeon Master, and an adventure, you need (to a
greater or lesser extent) the following items to play the game:
 The game itself: D&D is a unique type of game, a roleplaying game,
that’s presented in three core books — Player’s Handbook, Dungeon
Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. There’s also a Basic Game that
comes in a box for people new to the hobby.
 Dice: The D&D game uses a unique collection of dice, each with a differ-
ent number of sides. Dice add a random element to the game, and in
fact, turn D&D into a game (as opposed to merely an improvisational
activity). A set of D&D dice includes the following:
Number of Dice
Type of Dice
Abbreviation
1
Four-sided dice
d4
4
Six-sided dice
d6
1
Eight-sided dice
d8
2
Ten-sided dice
d10
1
Twelve-sided dice
d12
1
Twenty-sided dice
d20
In addition to the basic set of dice, it pays to have extras of certain types
of dice. For example, you might find it handy to have several extra d4s
or d8s when rolling damage for spells such as magic missile or searing
light. The players ought to have several sets of dice (one set per player
is best), so that they don’t have to waste time collecting the dice they
need from all over the table.
 Character sheets: Every player needs a character sheet that details the
character he or she is playing. You can photocopy a character sheet out
of the Player’s Handbook or purchase a pack of deluxe character sheets.
Players should use a pencil to fill out their character sheets because the
game stats change as the character gains experience and picks up loot.
Some Web sites also provide PDF versions of the character sheet that
you can download and print for personal use.
11
Chapter 1: The Role of the Dungeon Master

 DM screen: As DM, you need a DM screen. It provides useful charts and
tables you need in the game and helps you hide your maps and notes and
other accouterments so that the players can’t peek at what’s to come. 
 Miniatures and a battle grid: The Dungeon Master’s Guide provides a
ready-to-use battle grid, a play surface where your miniatures can repre-
sent tactical situations (such as combat encounters). Other play sur-
faces are available wherever fine hobby games are sold. DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS Miniatures booster packs contain a variety of cool monsters and
hero figures that you can use to represent characters in tactical situa-
tions. Although miniatures and a battle grid aren’t technically necessary,
they do speed up play and help players better visualize the fantastic sit-
uations you put their characters in. (They’re also pretty cool and fun to
collect, and you can play a more competitive version of the game with
them, if you’re into that.)
 Pencils and paper: D&D players need a way to keep notes, track their
progress through a dungeon, write down what kind of treasure they find,
and otherwise record important game information. For this reason, it
pays to have a lot of pencils (with good erasers), paper, and graph paper
handy during a game session.
The Expressions of Dungeon Mastering
In many ways, the Dungeon Master is the focus of a D&D game. When you
decide to become a DM, you decide to take on a special role that sets you
apart from casual and dedicated players alike. You moderate the game rules.
You set the pace of the story and action. You determine the challenges that
the player characters must face, and you give depth and reality to the game
world you create. 
It boils down to this fact: The Dungeon Master takes on a lot of functions in
the game. To help you better understand this fact, we’ve divided the role into
its many expressions. This division is kind of artificial, set up so we can dis-
cuss the role of the DM in a logical and clear manner. In reality, many of these
expressions blend into each other or might not even come into play in a typi-
cal game session. Still, exploring the role of DM is easier when you look at it
in this fashion. We discuss each of these expressions of DMing in the sections
that follow, and we delve deeper into each expression in later chapters.
DM as rules moderator
When the players gather around the table for a game of D&D, as the DM,
you’re in charge. This means that you make the call when the game rules
aren’t crystal clear or when the written rules can be interpreted in different
ways. Like an umpire at a baseball game or a referee moderating a basketball
12
Part I: Running a Great Game 

game, you have to use the rules as you understand them and apply them to
the situations that present themselves. 
The DM also makes the call when players attempt to do something that isn’t
exactly covered by the rules. Sure, the rules clearly spell out how to make
attacks, cast spells, and use physical skills such as Climb or Jump. The fun 
of a roleplaying game such as D&D, however, is that players can — and often
do — try to have their characters accomplish amazing things that sometimes
go beyond the limits of the rules. 
Just remember to be fair and consistent. If you treat every player in the same
way and follow the logic of your past rulings, everything should work out
fine. If you come up with a way to handle a specific type of action, apply that
same ruling the next time that action or something similar occurs. 
The best moderator DM has a solid understanding of the rules of the game.
You can’t interpret the rules if you don’t know them. Make sure that the play-
ers know about any changes (or house rules) you’re incorporating into the
game. When a situation comes up that isn’t covered by the rules, make a deci-
sion. Don’t be afraid to ask the players for suggestions, but remember that
your decision is final. The adventure must go on, so decide on a ruling and
get back to the action of play as quickly as possible.
The DM has the ultimate authority over the game, even over something that
is clearly covered in a rulebook. Use this power wisely. If you decide to over-
turn a rule for the game, clearly explain to the players why you are doing it
and then make a note of the change so that you can fairly and consistently
apply the rule change in the future. The same goes for house rules and new
rules you create to cover situations unique to your campaign. The players
must trust you in this role, or the game will come crashing down around you.
Nothing earns that trust better than when you make fair and consistent rul-
ings on a regular basis.
So, the best moderator DM is fair and consistent and has a solid grasp on 
the rules.
DM as narrator
Your campaign exists in your imagination and the imaginations of the players.
For everyone to get the most out of the game, it falls to the DM to serve as a
narrator for the action.
This doesn’t mean that you tell the players what their characters do. The
decisions regarding player character actions should always rest in the hands
of the players. Instead, you should serve as the portal into the imaginary
world, the eyes and ears (and other senses) of the characters. If you do this
well, the game really comes alive.
13
Chapter 1: The Role of the Dungeon Master

As the narrator, you describe what happens as the player characters interact
with the world. You tell them what they see, what they hear, what they smell.
(But never what they do!) In a roleplaying game, the action scrolls across the
imagination of the players, and anything you can do to paint a vivid and accu-
rate picture of the scene makes the action more immediate and immersive.
You describe the monster that just leaped out of the clinging shadows. You
describe the stench of evil that wafts out of the dark, gaping chasm. Don’t
just give the players the facts. Make sure to tell them what their characters
see, hear, smell, and even what they feel and taste when appropriate. Make
sure to describe everything from the player characters’ point of view. Don’t
reveal anything they shouldn’t have immediate access to, such as what’s
beyond the closed door or what’s inside the locked chest. Be descriptive,
using words that show the players what’s around their characters — what
they can see and otherwise sense about the immediate environment.
Don’t give everything away in your description of a scene, though. Provide
enough information to give the players a sense of where their characters are
and what they can gather with a brief examination of the area. Hold back enough
information to make the players curious and get them thinking about questions
they should ask. You can even decide to leave some clues for the game to
handle, for when the player characters make Spot, Listen, or Search checks in
the area. By only describing the most obvious details, you get the players to
draw their own conclusions and decide on their next course of action.
As narrator, you also get to be the special effects technician for the movie
that plays out in the imaginations of the players. When it comes time to
describe fantastic environments and otherworldly vistas, you get to create
whatever special effects you can imagine and describe. When the action
really takes off, you get to determine how the magic spell the wizard casts
appears, how hot the fire playing along the edge of the fighter’s flaming sword
feels, and how terrible the monster charging toward the player characters
looks and sounds. 
A good narrator DM shows players the results of their characters’ actions by
using evocative, exciting, and vibrant words and descriptions.
DM as a cast of thousands
Each player controls one character in the game. You, as the DM, control the
entire supporting cast, called nonplayer characters (NPCs). Everyone from the
bit characters to the prominent allies and adversaries that inhabit your cam-
paign are yours to use as you see fit. These are the people (and creatures)
that the player characters interact with, and they’re all yours to breathe life
into. Most of your NPC cast of thousands will require only a key descriptor or
a single detail that helps you play a role, as well as a single skill or other key
statistic that might come into play. Some NPCs can even be improvised on
14
Part I: Running a Great Game 

the spot as the need arises. You need to create full-on game statistics for an
NPC only if that character is an opponent or a major ally. Otherwise, just like
in the movies, you need to put together only as much as you think you’re
going to use in the game.
Whether an NPC serves as a walk-on or has a minor or major role in the story,
play each one as an individual. Roleplay! Nothing makes an NPC come alive
like roleplaying a key feature to give him or her personality and pizzazz. For
major NPCs, such as the dastardly villain or the regal king who hires the
adventurers, roleplay to the hilt. Ham it up, act it out, and make each charac-
ter memorable in the scene.
As a cast of thousands, a good DM needs to separate his or her role as DM
from his or her role as the controller of the supporting characters. Your NPCs
shouldn’t know everything that you know about the story and the previous
actions of the player characters. Also, your NPCs shouldn’t become the
heroes of the story, outshining the player characters and stealing the spot-
light from them. Be fair (there’s that phrase again) and play each NPC within
the confines of the specific role you imagined for him or her. Sure, you want
to sometimes get the drop on the player characters, but most of the time, if
the players make smart choices or the dice fall in their favor, don’t use your
power to get the upper hand. If the player characters have set a perfect
ambush for your goblin raiders, let the goblin raiders stumble into it. 
Remember to apply the same standards you use as game moderator to your
nonplayer characters as well as to the player characters. Provide good chal-
lenges so that a good story can develop, but don’t view yourself as the play-
ers’ opponent. And don’t alter the rules to make your supporting NPCs more
powerful or important. Let that develop naturally or leave it alone and keep
the action moving.
The best DM as a cast of thousands uses a variety of voices, mannerisms,
attitudes, and accents to make each NPC interesting and unique.
15
Chapter 1: The Role of the Dungeon Master
Relax and have fun!
D&D is a game. We aren’t going to come to your
house and give you a test on all this stuff, and
we certainly won’t hold it against you if you
make a mistake or two along the way. Learn the
rules in stages, adding elements as you and the
other players need them. For example, if you’re
starting a 1st-level adventure, don’t worry about
trying to learn all the ins and outs of higher-level
spells that won’t come into play. 
Be entertaining and allow the players to enter-
tain you. Ham it up, play it straight, go for the
dramatic, or do whatever is appropriate for the
scene and the adventure you’ve set up. 
You and your fellow players are playing a game.
Use the rules as you see fit, be fair and consis-
tent, and have fun. That’s the key to a good D&D
experience.

DM as player
The DM as player covers some of the same ground as the DM as a cast of
thousands. However, whereas the DM as a cast of thousands really speaks 
to the roleplaying aspects of D&D, the DM as player speaks to the parts of
D&D that are all game. The DM gets to play too, and much of a DM’s enjoy-
ment comes from rolling dice and seeing what happens — just like any of the
other players.
So, when the monster needs to decide what to do during an encounter, or
when the villainous lich lord ponders which of its many necromantic powers
16
Part I: Running a Great Game 

to use, or when the hired scout weighs her options when deciding whether to
help the adventurers or flee to a safer place, that’s when the DM gets into
character, decides on a course of action, and rolls some dice.
The DM must keep a solid separation between his or her functions as a
player and the near-omniscient abilities he or she possesses as moderator,
narrator, and creator. In most cases, the DM should try to have a preset plan
for how monsters and other nonplayer characters will behave. This plan
doesn’t need to be elaborate; it just needs to provide a guideline or two on
how to run the character or monster in an encounter. If you use a published
adventure, those cues are built into the text. If you make up your own adven-
ture, you need to set the cues.
Cues should be simple and straightforward. Monsters usually fight to the
death, though some might attempt to flee or surrender when reduced to half
or one-quarter hit points. Some monster cues might include tactics such as
“attack the strongest fighter first” or “pile on the spellcasters as soon as you
see them.” Other cues might provide guidelines on how and when to use the
monster’s special abilities. Just jot down enough information so that you
have an idea about how you want the encounter to play out. You can always
make changes on the fly, in the heat of the battle. But always stay fair to the
role of the monster, its purpose in the adventure, and what it should reason-
ably be able to figure out from its own perspective (not the near-omniscient
perspective you have as DM).
When it comes to rolling dice, it pays to decide on the conventions you want
to use when you put on your metaphorical DM’s hat. Here are your options:
 Make all rolls secretly: Some DMs make all their rolls behind the DM
screen. This gives them the option to change the results on occasion to
make for a better game. (We call this DM fiat or DM cheating, and you
should use it only sparingly. We discuss this important DM tool in more
detail in Chapter 10.) 
 Make all rolls openly: Some DMs make all their rolls in the open, allow-
ing the dice to fall as they will, regardless of the circumstances. This can
make for an exciting and sometimes deadly game session where PCs and
NPCs alike are left to the whims of fate.
 Make some rolls secretly, some openly: Some DMs might roll openly 
or behind the screen, depending on who they’re rolling for and what’s
currently going on (minor encounters rolled in the open, major encoun-
ters rolled in secret, or vice versa). For example, rolls whose results the
characters can’t observe, such as a villain’s Spot or Sense Motive check,
are best done secretly, behind your DM screen, to keep the players in
suspense. Rolls with clear and immediate results in the game world, such
as a monster’s attack rolls, are best done openly, so the players can 
see the results of the rolls and can’t contest when the dice don’t fall in
their favor.
17
Chapter 1: The Role of the Dungeon Master

The same mantra for all good DMing applies to being a good player DM. Be
fair and be consistent. Don’t favor your nonplayer characters over the player
characters. Don’t try to force the story in any particular direction. Set up the
situations, play your NPCs and monsters, and let the adventure develop as it
will. After all, surprises and unexpected results make for memorable and fun
D&D moments.
DM as social director
We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again. D&D is a social experience. As
such, the role of social director more often than not falls to the Dungeon
Master. The DM usually hosts the game group, invites the players, sets the
schedule, and provides a portion of the entertainment by running the game.
Now, all these functions can be spread out among the gaming group, but we
discuss the role of social director as an expression of the DM for purposes of
explanation.
First, you must form your gaming group. This can happen naturally among
friends with a common interest, or you can go out and actively recruit play-
ers from a gaming club, in a gaming store, at school, or at work. Because you
can’t play D&D without a DM, it is the DM who usually goes about forming the
gaming group.
Then, you have to set up the particulars of when and where your gaming
group will meet. This isn’t all that dissimilar to planning a party or other
social get-together. You need a when that works for the majority of the group,
a regular time when the group will get together for the express purpose of
playing D&D. This could be every week (for example, every Thursday evening
from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.); or every other week (the second and fourth Sunday
of every month, from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m.); or once a month (the first Saturday of
every month, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.); or whatever other consistent schedule
works for you and the group. The where can be the DM’s house, or you can
rotate playing locations among the group, or you can meet in a conference
room at work or school, or wherever everyone can get to and be comfortable
while playing the game.
It isn’t the DM’s responsibility to provide a place to play the game, but many
DMs do. If you can’t provide a place to play, work it out with the rest of the
group. Chances are good that someone in the group can accommodate the
game and the schedule that everyone agrees to. You just need a place where
the group can gather, spread out the books, character sheets, and battle grid
(if you use one), and roll dice. It should be a comfortable location because
a game session might last for four hours or more, depending on the needs
and desires of the group. As a social experience, the group should work out
how snacks and drinks will be provided. Will everyone bring their own? Will
everyone bring something to share? Will one member be charged with catering
18
Part I: Running a Great Game 

the event while everyone else chips in? Anything can work, and it usually
falls to the DM to get the group talking and making plans in advance of 
game day.
As a social experience, it falls to the DM as social director to make sure that
everyone has the opportunity to have a fun experience. That means allowing
time at the beginning and end of the game session for general conversation.
Don’t rush to start the game. Let everyone catch up and ease into the mood
at their own paces. When a suitable amount of time has passed, announce
that the game is going to start and request that non-game-related conversa-
tions come to an end. But don’t be an ogre about this. Someone will inevitably
break character or make a pop culture reference sometime during the game,
and that’s okay. 
Sometimes the good social director DM must also play mediator when the
players themselves have a disagreement. Disagreements are inevitable. Just
strive to keep everyone civil and respectful of each other, and do your best to
help them reach an equitable solution. Sometimes this can be as simple as
having them roll dice if the disagreement involves dispute over an in-game
item, such as a piece of treasure or a newly discovered magic item. Sometimes
more work needs to be done, and it’s okay for you to ask them to table the
argument for now and get back to it after the game session ends so that the
rest of the group can get back to the game. (We discuss this and other poten-
tial game group problems in Chapter 9.)
A good way to keep in contact and make sure everyone knows when and
where the next game session will be held is e-mail. Sending out reminders is a
great way for the DM to stay on top of the social director role. And if you
handle the e-mails with a little bit of flair and creativity, you can even treat
them as an extension of your game world. Perhaps the reminder for the next
game session is sent out by the villain the group has been tracking for the last
couple of sessions, degrading them (in the villain’s voice, of course) for being
unable to catch him. That should get everyone to the gaming table on time!
The best DM as social directors makes sure that every player gets his or her
time in the spotlight during the game.
DM as creator
You might be the type of Dungeon Master who only uses published adven-
tures and campaign setting books. Or you might be the type of DM who looks
to such purchased items for inspiration but tends to create adventures from
scratch. Either way, you have a role as a creator when you’re the DM.
Every decision, every rules call, every utterance by a monster or a villain,
every descriptive flair you add to your narration of a scene — all of these
19
Chapter 1: The Role of the Dungeon Master

things and more reveal the creator inside you. The DM creates whole worlds
one encounter at a time. That’s a big part of the fun of being the DM: You get
to lay the foundation for the story, the adventure, and the world that will
unfold with every game session you play. Sure, the players add to the story
and the world through the actions of their characters, but it all begins with
the DM.
Even if you decide to use published adventures, you still get to express your
creativity by making subtle changes to better fit what has happened earlier in
your campaign or to react to something unexpected that the player charac-
ters do. We dive into this expression of Dungeon Mastering in more detail
later in the book, especially in Parts III and IV.
The best DM as creator rewards the players who make the effort to immerse
themselves in the game world by providing an experience that’s every bit as
engaging as a well-written book or great movie.
The Goal of Dungeon Mastering
The earlier sections in this chapter cover, in broad strokes, the many hats
worn by the Dungeon Master. But what’s the goal of being the DM? Why do
you do it? A number of goals exist, but it boils down to this: to have fun. The
DM gets to have fun by running the game, crafting the adventures, and narrat-
ing the story of the player characters. When the DM and the players both
have a fun and satisfying experience, the game of D&D really shines as a
social experience.
Whether you like moderating the rules, narrating the story, or creating the
adventure — or taking on any of the other expressions of DMing we discuss
in this chapter — the reason to be the DM, the only reason, is because you
enjoy it. When you have fun, the whole group has fun, and that’s what games
such as D&D are all about.

B
efore swords are drawn and deadly spells are whispered in the dark, 
someone has to arrange a game session. Usually, that someone is the
Dungeon Master. You’ll need to find some players, pick a time and place to
play, and figure out what sort of adventure you can throw at them. Without
players, the adventure you create or pick out doesn’t get played. Without an
adventure, you’ve got nothing for the players to do.
Gathering a Game Group
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game requires a group of people to play. The group
can be as small as two (a Dungeon Master and a single player) or as large as
eight or more. The best size depends on what you’re comfortable running,
but we’ve found that groups of five to seven people work out best (one DM
and four to six players). You want a number of people that provides a good
group of adventurers, but not so many that players have to wait a long time
for their turns to come around again. 
Here’s an interesting fact: All of the current D&D products are written with
the assumption that your game group contains four player characters. That’s
how the writers and game developers of D&D products balance the encoun-
ters and determine the level of difficultly of a challenge — what would be
challenging for a party of four characters of a specific level? If your group has
fewer than four player characters, you might want to tone down encounters
that you find in published material. On the other hand, if your group has
more than four player characters, you might want to increase the number of
opponents or otherwise compensate to increase the challenge for the party.

(Part II of this book provides tips and advice on how to do this and other
advanced DMing techniques.)
You want to recruit players from among those people who like to play games,
have an interest in fantasy, and enjoy stories about action and adventure.
People who love fantasy films such as The Lord of the Rings movies, enjoy
reading books by authors such as Terry Brooks or George R. R. Martin, or
engage in computer games such as Neverwinter Nights or World of Warcraft all
possess at least the tendency to enjoy the D&D game.
Finding players
Some people are lucky enough to have a group of friends ready and willing to
play the D&D game. Everyone else has to go out and find players to partici-
pate in an adventure. You can accomplish this in a number of ways; we dis-
cuss a few of the ways you can find players for your D&D game in the following
subsections.
Friends and relatives
Existing friends and relatives (ideally, siblings and cousins) make good
sources to draw D&D players from. Of course, you want to ask only the
people you feel might have at least some interest in this kind of activity. It
doesn’t pay to try to turn someone who hates games or who despises fantasy
into a D&D player. Such attempts often just result in a bad experience for
everyone involved. 
Some of the best groups we’ve ever run contained siblings, significant others,
and parents and children. However, not all couples or relatives should play
together, and you should be on the look out for behavior that can destroy
your gaming group. Sometimes siblings or couples (or even close friends, for
that matter) bring real-world problems to the gaming table. Or sometimes
one half of a couple tries to tell the other half how to play his or her charac-
ter. The game table is not the place to work out relationship issues or to
rehash old arguments. If you see this kind of behavior, take the players aside
and ask them to each play their own characters. If the behavior persists, you
might have to ask one or both of the offending parties to leave the group. See
Chapters 5 and 9 for help in this area.
School
Many high schools and colleges have game clubs of one kind or another.
These extracurricular activities provide a good source of players and might
22
Part I: Running a Great Game 

even provide you with access to existing D&D game groups. If you’re of school
age, check to see whether your school has an active game club — and if not,
look into starting one!
Work
If school is behind you, your place of business might contain folks with an
interest in D&D who might join your regular game group. Or, depending on
your work environment and how strict management is, you might even be
able to play D&D at your workplace during lunch or after work hours. You
can use lunchtime or after-hours games to kick off a workplace campaign. If
you’re lucky enough to have a workplace with conference rooms and inter-
ested players, you have almost everything you need right there to get a
gaming group started. (We use conference rooms at the Wizards of the Coast
building to run D&D games at lunch and in the evenings for fun, and we often
play as part of work at other times during the day!)
Game store
Your local game or hobby store might have space dedicated to in-store play
where you can meet players from your area. If not, most such businesses pro-
vide a message board where players can post “gaming wanted” ads and make
connections. Through your gaming store, you should be able to hook up with
players who are interested in getting into a D&D game.
Conventions
Conventions devoted to D&D and other roleplaying games take place all over
the world throughout the year. Huge conventions such as GenCon (www.
gencon.com) and Origins (www.originsgames.com), as well as smaller
regional game conventions, provide weekends full of more gaming than you
can imagine. The local cons are better for finding gamers to play with on a
regular basis, but nothing beats the larger cons for nonstop D&D action at a
scale that could leave you breathless. In addition, many genre conventions
(such as the San Diego ComicCon, www.comic-con.org) run gaming tracks
where you can get in some D&D in between panels, special presentations,
and wandering the exhibit halls.
RPGA
The ROLEPLAYING GAMERS ASSOCIATION (or RPGA) is devoted to making it easier 
to enjoy face-to-face DUNGEONS & DRAGONS experiences. Run by Wizards of the
Coast’s Organized Play department, the RPGA is a global gaming group that
runs sanctioned roleplaying events all over the world. Joining the RPGA is
easy, and your free membership lasts a lifetime. Because finding a gaming
group can be challenging and because creating new adventures can be 
23
Chapter 2: Preparing for Play

time-consuming, the RPGA provides free DM material and makes an event cal-
endar available to members so they can find games happening in their com-
munity. Check out the RPGA online at www.wizards.com/rpga.
Wizards of the Coast Web site
Another good source of helpful DM information (and D&D information in gen-
eral, such as news about upcoming products) is the Wizards of the Coast Web
site (www.wizards.com/dnd). A robust online community hangs out at the
Web site, engaging in message board discussions and debates, participating
in online conventions, and attending online seminars. Between the D&D pages
and the RPGA pages, you can find gaming stores in your area, upcoming D&D
events and conventions, and other information that can help you build your
gaming group.
Inviting players to the game
When you go about inviting potential players to play the game, you might not
want to initially start out looking for an ongoing commitment. You want to
make sure the people you invite to play enjoy the experience, and you want
to make sure that each person is a good fit for the group. Start out slowly,
with a single event. In some ways, think about this first session as you would
any gathering with friends. There isn’t a lot of difference between planning
for an evening of D&D and planning for an evening of playing poker or watch-
ing DVDs.
In fact, when you establish it, your weekly (or monthly, or whatever) D&D
game resembles a weekly poker game. You and your gaming buddies get
together at regular intervals, either in the same place or at alternating loca-
tions. You play at a table with game pieces (in the case of the D&D game, dice
and miniatures and books instead of cards and chips). And the table usually
overflows with snacks and cool, refreshing beverages of one sort or another.
Before you invite the players to the first game session, decide on the following:
 When should the players create characters? Decide if you want the
players to create characters before they arrive or at the table.
If you’re playing with people who are totally unfamiliar with the game,
you might want to use pregenerated characters for this initial game ses-
sion. You can find ready-to-use player characters in Dungeons & Dragons
For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.) and in the D&D Basic Game. After
you and the group get a session or two of the game behind you, you can
start over and let everyone create exactly the characters they want to
play. After seeing the game in action, everyone will be able to make
better informed decisions concerning class, race, and how to apply abil-
ity scores and skill points to best effect.

 When and where are you playing? For the first session, you need to pick
a location to play and a time that’s convenient for you and the players. 
 How long do you and the players feel comfortable playing the first
time? We find that two to four hours makes a good beginning session
length.
 Who’s in charge of snacks and beverages? Do you want to suggest that
everyone bring snacks and drinks to share, or do you want to make it a
bring-your-own-snacks kind of event? Either way is fine, just so long as
you let everyone know what’s expected of them.
Make sure that you ask the players to let you know whether they plan on
attending the game. Inevitably, someone is going to get sick, become busy, or
otherwise be unable to attend, so you want to have prior warning. If you invite
six people into the game and only four can make it, you still have enough play-
ers for the game to go on. If the number falls too low, you want to have time
enough to reschedule or to let those players who are attending know that you
might have to change your plans for the evening. (Some rousing battles using
the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Miniatures Game, or a favorite board game, can fill the
space when you don’t have enough players for the adventure.)
Using a Published Adventure
As the Dungeon Master, you have to determine what adventure you want to
run for your game session. If this is going to be your first adventure (for you
or your group or the players’ newest characters), we recommend starting with
something official. The D&D Basic Game, Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies, and
this book (see Chapters 7 and 20) all have ready-to-use adventures designed for
1st-level characters. If you’re looking for an adventure for an established group
of higher-level characters, you can turn to a number of sources.
25
Chapter 2: Preparing for Play
Online gaming
If you can’t establish your own group of local
players or if you can’t find a local gaming group
to join, you can always look for RPGA events
and conventions in your area. Of course, most
people want to play D&D more often than that.
Another method is to hook up with people online
(through the D&D message boards, for exam-
ple) and play a game over the Internet. We’ve
seen D&D games take place in chat rooms, as
play-by-e-mail posts, and with instant messag-
ing. Some of the immediacy and face-to-face
social aspect of the D&D experience is lost, but
you still get to play the game. If you have a hard
time finding players who live close by, playing
D&D online might be a good alternative for you.

Wizards of the Coast products
As the publishers of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, Wizards of the Coast
makes a number of adventures, and new adventures are being published all
the time. Current in-print adventures include Shadows of the Last War (2nd to
3rd level), Sons of Gruumsh (4th to 5th level), and Red Hand of Doom (6th to
11th level). 
D&D adventures provide solid plots, exciting encounters, and great villains to
throw at the player characters. The great thing about published adventures,
whether they’re designed for generic D&D or one of D&D’s campaign worlds
(such as FORGOTTEN REALMS or EBERRON), is that they provide a good basis for
your work. You can run them exactly as they’re written, or you can make
subtle to sweeping changes to make the adventure uniquely your own. 
Here’s a secret that so few DMs seem to be aware of: You don’t have to be
running an EBERRON (or whatever) campaign to use an EBERRON (or whatever)
adventure. Take any published adventure that catches your eye, change
names and locations to suit your campaign, and you have a ready-to-play
adventure where most of the hard work of crafting encounters and creating
monster stats has already been done for you.
Another resource to look for is the Fantastic Locations series of D&D prod-
ucts. Each title in this series features two double-sided, fully illustrated battle
maps of key encounter locations, as well as an encounter booklet. You can
develop your own adventure around the suggested encounters, or you can
create something brand new that uses the cool locations depicted on the
maps. Fantastic Locations: Fane of the Drow, for example, features miniature-
scaled battle maps of a drow enclave, and others in the series depict monster
lairs, dungeons, and ruins of all sorts — just the kinds of places that player
characters love to explore.
Dungeon Magazine
Paizo Publishing works with Wizards of the Coast to produce the official
Dungeon Magazine. This monthly periodical contains all kinds of tips and
advice for DMs, as well as providing encounters, lairs, and three or four full-
length adventures for characters of varying levels in every issue. It makes a
great resource for DMs looking for something to run on a moment’s notice or
for exciting encounters to drop into any campaign. Find out more about
Dungeon Magazine and Paizo at www.paizo.com.

RPGA
Members of the RPGA gain access to tournament-style adventures for all
levels of play. You can use these adventures to run sanctioned events or to
play D&D games with your friends. Check out www.wizards.com/rpga for
more information.
Other d20 publishers
Because the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is produced under an open license,
other companies can produce material — including adventures — for use
with D&D. Look for the d20 SYSTEM logo, shown in Figure 2-1, for products that
are compatible with D&D.
Creating Your Own Adventures
If you really want to get into it, you can create your own adventures for your
campaign. Most DMs (ourselves included) use a mix of published adventures
and their own creations to generate their ongoing campaigns. Creating a D&D
adventure from scratch can be a lot of fun, but it can also be a lot of work. We
recommend that new DMs start out by using published adventures to get a
feel for how adventures come together, and then start altering published
adventures to suit the purposes of their campaigns. After you’ve had some
experience, go ahead and make your own. Part III of this book is devoted to
helping you in this endeavor.
Even when you get to the point where you’re creating your own adventures
on a regular basis, you still want to utilize published adventures in your cam-
paign. Running a published adventure every so often gives you a break from
adventure creation. Plus, we’re confident that you’ll find something in every
published adventure that you can lift out and use in your adventures. Use
every available resource to your best advantage, we always say.

Chapter 2: Preparing for Play

Making Preparations before the Game
Before the big night (or afternoon, or whatever) of your game session, in
addition to informing the players about the particulars of character creation,
time, location, and snack expectations (as we describe earlier in this chap-
ter), you have a few more things to do to get ready. As Dungeon Master, you
need to have a working knowledge of the rules of the game. More often than
not, the players will turn to you to explain how a particular portion of the
game works or to ask how to accomplish something in the game. You need to
be ready. This doesn’t mean that you need to memorize the Player’s
Handbook and Dungeon Master’s Guide from cover to cover. But you do need
to know and understand the basics of play — combat, task resolution, move-
ment. For everything else, you just need to have a sense of where to go in the
rulebooks to look something up. 
If you’re using the D&D Basic Game as the foundation of your first game ses-
sion, you have less material to know and deal with. If you’re diving right in with
the full version of the game, you have a bit more material to peruse before
game night. There are no tests; this isn’t school. D&D is a game and it’s fun, so
don’t sweat the details. Just be ready for the big picture, and you’ll do fine.
When in doubt about where to find a rule, use the rules you do know and
make something up. The goal is to keep the adventure moving, not to neces-
sarily make sure that a player character’s grapple attempt against the owl-
bear goes exactly according to the rules. You can always research the rule in
question after the game. If it turns out that your ruling was way off and had
an adverse effect on the player characters, you can decide to make it up to
the players in some way at the next game session. Part II of this book deals
with these kind of advanced DMing issues and techniques in greater detail.
The other thing you want to do before the game session is prepare your
adventure. If you’re using a published adventure, read through it and make
notes on things you want to change or add or on rules you might need to
refer to for particular encounters. If you’re using an adventure of your own
creation, make sure you finish creating it — or at least as much of it as you
plan to run at the session — before the time of the event. You can’t play D&D
without an adventure, and the DM must be prepared.
Establishing the Ground Rules: 
Gaming Etiquette
As in any social experience, a D&D game benefits from common courtesies
and ground rules that are followed by players and DMs alike. The following
sections provide some of the unwritten ground rules of a game session, now
written down for everyone to use.
28
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Being ready to run the game
The DM needs to be prepared to run the game session. If you aren’t ready, the
game session isn’t going to turn out well. Review the rules, particularly any
special rules that might come up in the adventure. Know your adventure. If
you’re familiar with the plot and pacing of the adventure, it will run that
much more smoothly. Plus, your knowledge of the adventure allows you to
deal with the unexpected actions of the player characters — and the players
will do things that you don’t expect. That’s part of the fun of the game. 
Being ready also means being organized. Have your adventure materials and
notes set up before the game session begins. Gather the miniatures you want
to use ahead of time. Use sticky notes or bookmarks so you can easily find
the sections of the rulebooks you know you’ll need to refer to, especially the
pages in the Monster Manual you might need to turn to for likely encounters.
The players expect you to be ready, so it’s only a common courtesy that you
don’t disappoint them.
If you’re ready, that’s one thing that can take care of itself and you can focus
on running a great game session.
Hosting chores
You need a place to play. Providing a place to play isn’t the responsibility of
the DM, though you might host the game session. Discuss this with the entire
gaming group. Determine who has the space and the desire to host the game.
Find out which of the possible locations are most convenient for the majority
of the gaming group. You might decide to rotate your regular game among a
number of locations, sharing the responsibilities. You might discover that one
location is going to work out best all the time and the host is fine with that.
A lot of what goes into this decision involves where you want to play. You
have two options:
 You can play in a public place, such as a library or game store or coffee
shop. This assumes that the staff and management of the place is okay
with you playing there, you follow any rules the place sets up, and you
keep the noise down so as not to disturb others using the public place. 
 You can play in a private place, such as the home of one of the mem-
bers of the gaming group. Certain rules and common courtesies do go
along with playing in a friend’s house. Follow them, and the host will
continue to make space available. Break the rules or show disrespect for
the location, and you’ll probably need to find a new location for future
game sessions.
29
Chapter 2: Preparing for Play

Prior to the game, the host should make sure the play space is clean and that
distractions are kept to a minimum. (Keeping pets and young children away
from the gaming area is probably a good idea.) After the game, the entire
gaming group should pitch in to clean up by throwing trash away, putting
away dice and other gaming accouterments, storing any remaining snacks,
and so on.
Setting a time limit
Set a time limit for the game session. This allows the other players to plan
accordingly and gives you an idea of how much material you need to have
prepared for the game. Bear in mind that the time limit is only a guideline. If
you and the other players want to keep playing, you can adjust the time limit
to everyone’s satisfaction. 
Bringing or chipping in for refreshments
The gaming group should reach a consensus before the game about how to
handle food and drink. Will people eat lunch or dinner before coming to the
game, or will a meal be part of the event? If the meal is part of the event, will
everyone chip in for take-out or will everyone bring a dish to share? D&D is a
group activity, so it shouldn’t be the responsibility of a single group member
(including the host or the DM) to take on the entire burden of feeding the group.
Everyone chips in and one person buys for the group, everyone brings some-
thing to share, or everyone is expected to fend for themselves. Any choice is
fine as long as the group knows what to expect at the game. 
Bill’s original gaming group used to meet in a friend’s basement, even though
Bill almost always served as the DM. The host set up expectations that every-
one in the group adhered to. The host provided the play space and drinks, and
the other players each brought a snack to share. Bill’s current group, where he
also serves as DM, meets at his house every week. Bill provides drinks, and the
entire group chips in for a take-out dinner before every session. 
Make sure that the group agrees to food choices that work for everyone, 
or at least have options for all of the players. Some people don’t like certain
things, and others have special dietary needs or allergies. Try to take all of
that into account as the group comes up with a refreshment plan. And for long
game sessions, the DM should plan breaks for food and drink so as not to 
disrupt the adventure.
Come up with a system that works best for your group and spreads the respon-
sibility around. Then be courteous and live up to your end of the bargain.
30
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Eliminating outside distractions
At the start of the game session, the DM needs to provide time for the players
to socialize. Players like to catch up, discuss the news of the day, talk about
favorite TV shows and movies, and generally shoot the breeze. D&D is as
much about social interaction as slaying monsters, so this kind of activity is
encouraged — as long as it’s kept in its place. Fifteen minutes to a half hour
of this, before the game starts, is fine, or perhaps over a meal (if one is part of
your game session). When the DM calls for the game to begin, however, cour-
tesy demands that all players turn their attention to the game.
The host can help by making sure that other distractions aren’t easily acces-
sible. The TV shouldn’t be on when you’re playing D&D. If the majority of the
players want to watch the big game of the sport of their choice, maybe you
should reschedule the game session. Likewise, keep the computer and con-
sole games out of sight, put the pets away, and send the younger children to
their rooms to play their own games. (Better yet, hire a babysitter.)
Sometimes, a player just isn’t in the mood for D&D. He or she might have
had a rough day at the office, might not be feeling well, might have a ton
of homework, or maybe there’s something else he or she would rather be
doing. Don’t try to strong-arm a player into showing up and playing. If a
player doesn’t think he or she will have fun, encourage the player to take the
night off from the game. The player can always jump back into things for your
next game session.
Distractions are going to occur. Someone is going to tell a joke, relate a story,
or otherwise disrupt the flow of the adventure. A little of that is okay and
even fun. But stifle any distractions that derail the adventure and make it
hard for the other players to enjoy the game. Etiquette and courtesy demand
that players and DMs get their heads in the game for the game session so that
everyone can have a good time.
Making sure everyone understands 
the in-game rules of conduct
These rules of conduct aren’t revolutionary, but it’s good to review them with
your gaming group so that everyone knows what’s expected of them when
they come to play D&D: 
 It’s the DM’s show. Players need to be kind to the DM and accept the
DM’s authority over the game. Likewise, when the DM makes a mistake
(and it will happen), he or she should be willing to change a decision if
that decision had negative repercussions for a player character.
31
Chapter 2: Preparing for Play

 Play fair. Players shouldn’t cheat, even to save their characters’ lives.
There are ways to deal with bad rolls (even ones that will result in a
character’s death) that don’t force a player to stoop so low as to cheat.
 Accentuate the positive. Players should compliment the DM on a good
game. Likewise, DMs should praise players when they have their charac-
ters do something especially clever or heroic or just plain fun.
 Let the players play. The DM needs to be kind to the players, treating
them fairly and letting them make their own decisions. The DM shouldn’t
force the player characters to follow a specific path through the adven-
ture, shouldn’t punish them for being clever, and shouldn’t intentionally
and maliciously try to kill them.
 It’s the players’ game too. The DM needs to treat players with respect
and should ask them for their opinions on difficult rules interpretations.
 Eliminate the negative. The DM and the players should leave the real
world behind when they play D&D, including any disagreements or lin-
gering bad feelings that might otherwise color the way they play for a
particular session. The DM and players should avoid distractions that
make it hard for everyone to enjoy the game.
 And most importantly, have fun!

In This Chapter
 Understanding the DM’s role
 Exploring the parts of a game session
 Discovering ways to end a game session
 Examining out-of-session activities
 Planning future game sessions
You’ve gathered a group of players. You’ve invited them to a game. You’ve
made all your preparations, planing a number of interesting encounters
and even a few surprises. Now comes the moment of truth. Now comes the
game session.
There really aren’t any hidden secrets to making the game session come off well
so that everyone has fun. Still, it might be good to review with you what a typi-
cal game session might look like. Sure, your particular experience might vary,
but forearmed is forewarned, or something like that. In this chapter, we explore
the game session by breaking it down into its component parts. Then we pro-
vide tips and advice on how you can make the most out of each of those parts.
This chapter covers the basics of running a game session. In Part II of this
book, we expand upon many of the topics we discuss in this chapter.
Taking Charge as Dungeon Master 
and Running the Game
As we point out time and again in this book, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game
features a unique element that makes it different from all other games — the
role of the Dungeon Master. The DM is a movie director, storyteller, and com-
puter processor all in one. The DM tells the players what their characters see
and hear, determines the outcomes of their actions (with the help of the rules
and the dice), and keeps the adventure moving. Because of the presence of
the DM, players can have their characters try anything, go anywhere, or risk

everything. The only limits are the imagination of the gaming group and the
dice rolls the players make.
During a game session, the DM narrates the adventure, runs all the charac-
ters and monsters not controlled by the other players, and determines the
course of the story by evaluating the actions of the player characters and the
results of the dice rolls. 
DM laws
The DM is the final authority when it comes to a rules question or dispute. In
the following list, we give some pointers for being a good arbiter in your role
as the DM:
 Make it up when you’re in doubt! It’s better to keep the game moving
and the story progressing than to get bogged down looking up rules or
arguing about a result.
 Have fun! It’s better to make a generous interpretation that rewards the
players for doing something creative and interesting than to look for a
reason why something fun won’t work.
 Use ability checks to determine success if the players try to do some-
thing that isn’t otherwise covered by any other rules.
 Remember that you as the DM aren’t competing against the players.
Instead, you’re like a referee who helps advance the story and challenge
the players.
 Don’t think of the adventure as your story. Don’t think of the adventure
as the players’ story. It’s the group’s story. Let everyone participate in
advancing the story.
 Be fair above all else. If you determine that a rule should work in a spe-
cific way, make sure it works that way in the future. Don’t play favorites.
Be consistent.
Do these things and everyone will have a good time.
DM basics
The DM runs the game, so even if you’re using a published adventure and not
creating your own, you need to read the adventure before the game session
and think about possible outcomes and twists and turns. Then the DM brings
the adventure to life as the players make their contributions to the tale
through the actions of their characters. Why read a published adventure
beforehand? Because the game session will go more smoothly if you as the
34
Part I: Running a Great Game 

DM have a feel for the pace of the story and know how to adjust the plot based
on the actions of the player characters. 
After setting the scene for any particular encounter, pose a question to the play-
ers, such as “What is your character going to do?” Asking a question gets the
players thinking and makes them imagine the scene so they can decide what to
do. The answer to the question leads to all kinds of action, excitement, and sur-
prises for everyone involved. Use your own imagination, the game rules, and the
results of the dice to determine what happens as the action unfolds.
Narrating
When you narrate an adventure, you bring the imaginary adventure to life.
Narration takes a number of forms. First, you present a scene to the players,
which usually ends with the question, “What is your character going to do?”
If you use a published adventure, this material is often provided to you in the
form of read aloud text (portions of the adventure meant to be read aloud or
paraphrased for the players). If you’re using your own adventure or if the
players ask a question that isn’t covered by the read aloud text, you get to
make something up. Be careful, though. Don’t reveal more details than the
characters would be able to acquire with a casual glance. If the players want
their characters to spend more time studying or examining something, let
them know that time passes. You might even want to call for a Search check
or other appropriate skill use check.
The second form of narration occurs after a player answers your question
about what his or her character is going to do and you call for the appropri-
ate die roll. You interpret the results and feed it back to the players in as
engaging and imaginative a method as you can muster. Don’t just say, “Okay,
you got an attack result of 18. That’s a hit. Roll damage.” Liven it up with
more descriptive words and phrases. For example, “Redgar takes a mighty
swing with his greatsword and hits the orc squarely in the chest. The orc
appears to be staggered by the blow, but it doesn’t fall down!”
Running NPCs and monsters
When the player characters meet nonplayer characters, monsters, and vil-
lains in the course of an adventure, the DM gets to run them. Play these non-
player characters according to their Intelligence and Wisdom scores, any
notes you have concerning their goals and motivations, and in response to
the actions of the player characters (PCs). Even a friendly character or crea-
ture can be driven to violence if treated poorly by the PCs. Remember to play
the monsters fairly and to keep your knowledge as DM separate from what
the monsters can be expected to know according to the story and what has
happened previously in the adventure.
35
Chapter 3: Running the Game

Winging it
At some point, the players are going to step off the anticipated path of the
adventure or try to do something strange and unexpected. That’s okay. In
fact, it’s encouraged! That’s what makes the D&D game a unique and won-
drous experience. More to the point, the DM is there for just such an occa-
sion. When a situation comes up that you haven’t planned for, make something
up! When the player characters leave the map, wing it! Be fair, be consistent,
have fun, and everything will work out. See Chapter 10 for more on this impor-
tant DM technique. 
Playing through the Game Session
The game session provides the means for you to play the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game. It’s the time that you and the other players have set aside for the
express purpose of playing D&D, of exploring imaginary dungeons and bat-
tling mythical monsters of all descriptions. In the following sections, we
examine the game session from two perspectives: the first game session and
a typical game session in an ongoing campaign.
Setting ground rules
After you’ve formed a game group and picked an evening or weekend after-
noon or other convenient time when everybody can spend a few hours play-
ing D&D, set up the ground rules as outlined in Chapter 2. Make sure everyone
knows and agrees to the ground rules and understands the basics of how 
the game is played. (We discuss how you can best teach D&D in Chapter 6.)
Remember your time limit; you’re going to want to wrap up about 15 minutes
early so that you and the players can deal with after-game notes, cleanup,
and other post-game activities.
If a meal (or two) makes up part of your game session, make sure that every-
one knows when you plan to break for eating and what contribution everyone
is expected to make to the meal. 
Settling in as everyone arrives
When the players arrive, give everyone a chance to get settled and socialize.
This is a time-honored ritual for the beginning of D&D games everywhere,
and you shouldn’t try to fight it. D&D is as much a social event as it is a game,
so let the players talk and joke and catch up before the game swings into high
gear.
36
Part I: Running a Great Game 

If this is your first game, have the host show everyone where to put coats
and jackets, as well as point out where the bathroom and other necessities
can be found. If the host has any ground rules concerning his or her home,
make sure that the players know them and follow them. Remember that cour-
tesy to the host means you’ll be invited back to play there again. If the host
asks players to remove their shoes before walking across the carpet, to use
coasters to keep refreshing beverages from leaving a ring on the table, or
whatever, the players should abide by these requests. Don’t forget the intro-
ductions if some of the players don’t know each other!
If this is an ongoing game, everyone knows the rules and all of the accessible
and important locations associated with the play area. They each have a
favorite place to store their outer garments and they know where to find the
glasses and bowls and silverware. The thing to watch with an existing group
(and this really isn’t too much of a problem) is that the opening socializing
can go on and on. Allow this settling in period to continue for a little while,
but eventually you’ll want to ask everyone to wrap up their conversations
and move to the gaming table so you can get started.
Gathering around the game table
The game table is the term we use for where you play a game of D&D. In real-
ity, it might be a table surrounded by comfortable chairs, such as found in a
kitchen or dining room. It might be a coffee table surrounded by couches and
chairs, such as found in a living or family room. As long as you have places to
sit, flat surfaces to roll dice on and spread out battle grids and miniatures,
and space to put snacks and drinks and books, you have a D&D game table.
The play area should be situated in such a way that the DM can spread out
his or her material while still being seen and heard by all the players. The DM
needs room for a DM screen, notes, game books, miniatures, and whatever
other accouterments he or she needs for the game session. Much of this
material needs to remain hidden from the players to maintain the mystery
and surprises associated with the adventure.
As game groups play from session to session, you’ll see some interesting
habits begin to develop. Players will inevitably take the same seats from ses-
sion to session. Indeed, sometimes a player will complain to no end if another
player takes his or her seat. Watch for these habits. Be amused by them. Let
them develop. They give your game group personality and color that you’ll
remember for years.
When everyone has found a place and gotten ready, you can begin the game.
37
Chapter 3: Running the Game

Creating and updating characters
If this is your first game session, you should have set up in the ground rules
concerning whether the players would create characters before coming to
the game, whether they would create characters at the game, or whether you
would provide pregenerated characters (see Chapter 2 for details).
Characters that the players create before the game
If you want the players to create their characters before the first game ses-
sion, make sure to tell them what method of character creation you want
them to use. Chapter 6 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide describes various meth-
ods for character generation. Use the method that feels best to you, but when
in doubt, just have the players use the method described in Chapter 1 of the
Player’s Handbook. In addition, let the players know whether you’re using any
additional rules in your campaign that they might want to incorporate when
creating their characters. These additional rules might include those found in
Expanded Psionics Handbook, Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, Eberron
Campaign Setting, Magic of Incarnum, or some other D&D rules supplement.
You’ll want to spend a few minutes at the start of the first session reviewing the
characters that the players have created, answering any questions they may
have concerning their characters, asking them to make adjustments (if neces-
sary), and allowing any stragglers to finish up the creation process. (There will
always be a player or two who didn’t quite finish — or start, even! — before
the game session.)
Characters that the players create at the game
If you’d rather spend a portion of your first game session for character cre-
ation, you can help the players through the process and check what they’re
doing as they do it. Also, creating characters at the game table allows the
players to discuss options and form a more compatible party of adventurers.
(“We need a cleric! Who wants to be the cleric?”)
You still need to lay the ground rules for generating ability scores and which
sources other than the Player’s Handbook (if any) you want to allow in the
game. If this is everyone’s first game, we recommend limiting players to mate-
rial in the Player’s Handbook the first time out. You can add supplemental
material that interests you and the other players in a future game.
Pregenerated characters
The last option for player characters is to allow players to select a pregener-
ated character. The D&D Basic Game and Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies
(Wiley Publishing, Inc.) both include ready-to-play characters that you can
38
Part I: Running a Great Game 

allow players to choose from. This is by far the easiest and fastest method
available, and it allows you to get into the game relatively quickly. Of course,
this method takes the fun and creativity out of the hands of the players as far
as characters are concerned, but it provides a great way to get started play-
ing quickly for those people new to the game.
If two or more players want the same character, the DM needs to decide how
to adjudicate the issue. When all else fails, have the players roll the d20. High
roll selects first, and so on, in die result order.
To add a bit of creativity to this method, ask the players to name their char-
acters. They don’t have to use the names provided with the pregenerated
characters, and indeed will feel a slightly closer connection to the characters
they chose if they provide unique and meaningful (to them) character names.
Later, after everyone has gotten a feel for the game, we recommend abandon-
ing the pregenerated characters and starting over. Allow the players to make
their own 1st-level characters and run them through a new 1st-level adven-
ture. Consider the adventure that used the pregenerated characters to be
practice for everyone involved.
Characters that the players advance to the next level
Existing campaigns eventually reach the point when the player characters
have earned enough experience points (XP) to advance to the next level. You
need to decide whether you want to allow the players to update their charac-
ters on their own time or whether you want to set aside a portion of the game
session for this activity to take place. Again, if you have them level up at the
table, you can participate in the process, answer questions, and make sure
they’re following the rules correctly.
If you decide to make character updating part of the game session, it proba-
bly should be done at the beginning of the session. If you have the players do
the updating away from the table, use a portion of the beginning of a session
to review what the players did to their characters. As DM, you aren’t just
checking to see whether the characters are legal; you need to know what
direction the players have taken their characters and what abilities are in the
group so you can better plan future adventures.
Opening with the prologue
You’ve had the out-of-game-socializing portion of the game session. You’ve
had the character creation/review/update portion of the game session. Now
it’s time to get to the adventure!
39
Chapter 3: Running the Game

If this is your first game session with this group (or with this group of charac-
ters), start out with what we like to call the prologue. Like the prologue of a
novel or the part of a TV show or movie before the main title and credits roll,
the prologue for a D&D game sets up what is to come. Use it to set the scene
of your campaign world or at least to establish where the player characters
are as the adventure opens. Don’t make your opening too elaborate or too
long. You want to get to the action as soon as you can, not have the players
sit around and listen to you wax poetic about your world’s dozen moons or
the ruling members of the kingdom or whatever. Just provide enough infor-
mation to set the scene and get things off and running. You can work in other
details naturally as the adventure unfolds.
Another good thing to do at the beginning of your first game session is to let
the players introduce their characters. Let them briefly describe their charac-
ters’ names and classes, what they look like, and what others might notice
upon seeing them for the first time.
Don’t worry about it for the first time you play, but when you start a new
adventure or campaign in the future, you might want to get information (such
as character background, old enemies, most feared monsters, or long-term
character goals) on the player characters beforehand so that you can work
that information into the plot or background you want to establish for the
campaign. Nothing roots the players and their characters in your world more
than having a place for their characters to immediately fit into. If the player
characters have a bit of history in the world, the world feels a bit more real.
See Chapter 12 for explicit ideas in this area.
We have one last consideration for you before the adventure gets going. Do
the player characters have a history with each other? Do they know each
other? Or are they meeting for the first time when the adventure begins?
There’s no correct way to do this, but you should be aware of what each
direction might mean to the game:
 If the player characters start the adventure already knowing each
other, you can establish that they have a rapport and a desire to help
each other right from the beginning. This can be a little artificial, but
without this connection, you can run into some bad player character
interaction for no reason. Possible starting connections include that the
player characters grew up together in the same village or town, that
they have been working together for a short time prior to the start of the
adventure, that they all serve the same master or patron who has pro-
vided their training to date, or that they all got together to face a
menace in the past and continue to work together as they seek to find it
and destroy it. These are just examples. You can and should include the
players in a discussion to set up party connections if this is something
you want to establish right off the bat.
40
Part I: Running a Great Game 

 If the player characters meet for the first time at the start of the
adventure, you run the risk of one player character’s goals going against
the goals of another player character or the entire party. This can still
work out, and it’s often fun to see the players develop connections natu-
rally as the adventure plays out, but it can be risky. At the very least,
you should have the players come up with compatible goals and choose
compatible alignments so that party cohesion doesn’t suffer. (See the
sidebar in this chapter, “Player character alignment.”)
Recapping the previous session
If you’re running an ongoing campaign, then at the beginning of most game
sessions, the prologue is replaced by the recap. (At the start of a new adven-
ture or at other key story moments in a campaign, it might be appropriate to
have another prologue moment.) The recap helps get players back into the
story and gets them thinking about what happened last time and what they
might be expecting (or dreading!) in the upcoming session.
Now, you as the DM might give the recap of the previous session, but what’s
the fun or advantage in that? You know what happened, and you also know
the behind-the-scenes stuff that you don’t want to inadvertently give away if
you tell everyone what happened last time. Better to have the players give
the recap. This accomplishes three main things for you:
 It lets you see what the players remember and think they’ve figured out
about the events and situations that they’ve previously encountered. 
 It lets you get a feel for the story from the players’ points of view (which
are always going to be at least slightly different from your own). 
 It allows the players to make conclusions and throw out ideas that you
can use to best advantage later in the adventure.
Start a game session by asking the players for a recap of the previous ses-
sion. Bill starts his game sessions by asking his players “What happened last
time?” or “Where were we?” (Of course, his players often respond “You were
about to give us experience points!” What started long ago as a way to see
whether their DM was paying attention has since become a running gag
around the game table.) Let each player add something to the telling. You get
to see what they remember, what they think is important, and sometimes
what they think is going on behind the scenes. You know what? Sometimes
what they come up with is better than what you have planned. Here’s a
secret: They’ll never know whether you decide to take one of their ideas and
use it in place of yours. You wind up looking good and they feel clever —
everybody wins!
41
Chapter 3: Running the Game

Taking on encounters and challenges
The heart of every adventure, the unit in which adventures and game ses-
sions are built, is the encounter. Most encounters in a game of D&D include a
battle with one or more monsters. The following list describes the types of
encounters you’re likely to have in a typical game session:
 The combat encounter: Combat encounters are structured in rounds,
where most of the rules of the game come into play. Most of the encoun-
ters in your adventure are, or will evolve into, combat encounters. 
 The roleplaying encounter: Roleplaying encounters present players
with situations in which they can roleplay their characters and interact
with the other player’s characters and with characters controlled by the
DM (known as nonplayer characters or NPCs). Sometimes the players
use skill rolls, but often the dice never come out for these types of
encounters. Trading, talking to locals, or asking for help from a nearby
baron all fall into this encounter category. Depending on how the role-
playing goes, this kind of encounter can quickly develop into a combat
encounter or into the last type of encounter, the challenge encounter.
 The challenge encounter: Challenge encounters often require skill or
ability checks, or even saving throws, to navigate as the player charac-
ters attempt to defeat a natural hazard, a deadly trap, or a locked door.
During a game session, you might run a single encounter with a complex
battle scene and multiple monsters or a number of short encounters. It all
depends on not only the encounter you’ve developed but the actions of the
player characters. Even an encounter you thought would take the whole ses-
sion can be cut short by clever play, the use of a powerful spell, unexpected
diplomacy, or simply by the player characters turning south in the dungeon
instead of going north. Let this kind of thing play out naturally. Never force a
battle or a specific kind of encounter. The fun of the game is seeing what the
players do with the situations you set up — let them play out with the player
characters’ actions.
You don’t have to lose that exciting encounter you were planning with the
dracolich just because the player characters didn’t open the right door in the
dungeon. Save it for another time or move it to another place in the dungeon
as you see fit.
When you run roleplaying encounters, you don’t have to keep track of whose
turn it is or exactly where every character is standing on the battle grid. 
Just make sure that all the players get a chance to participate and don’t let
any single player (including yourself!) hog the spotlight. Challenge encoun-
ters might need the battle grid and initiative checks to run, depending on 
the challenge in question. Certainly, however, combat encounters work best
when run in strict initiative order and with the use of a battle grid and 
miniatures.
42
Part I: Running a Great Game 

For combat encounters, think about what will make for visually interesting
and dynamic battles. (We cover this in more detail in Chapter 14.) Consider
not only the monsters or other opponents to throw at the party, but think
about the terrain in which the fight will occur. Fighting in a plain dungeon
room of stone is fine, but battling it out in a cavern filled with a lake of molten
fire is really exciting and turns the terrain into a participant in the battle.
Ending a game session
Time management comes into play during a D&D game session. Remember
that you and the group agreed to a specific end time for the session, and you
want to wrap up play about 15 minutes prior to that so you can cover record-
keeping and other post-game activities (see the following section). Make sure
that you don’t let the PCs start a long battle just before you’re ready to wrap
up the session.
How do you end a game session? If the adventure reaches a natural conclu-
sion, you’re set. But many adventures require multiple sessions to play
through. In this case, you might consider the cliffhanger approach. Let the
player characters get to the start of the next encounter. Let them see what’s
waiting for them. Then leave them hanging and wanting more by saying, “To
be continued next game session!” This leaves everyone ready and eager to
get back to the game at the next available opportunity. Just be careful not to
actually start the encounter. It’s tough to keep track of a combat or challenge
encounter in the middle of the action. Better to start the battle fresh at the
next game session.
43
Chapter 3: Running the Game
Player character alignment
The D&D game allows for players to choose any
alignment for their characters. Alignment is a
tool for developing a character, not a carved-in-
stone proclamation about how a character must
behave. It’s a guideline, not a decree.
That said, we’ve found that, at the very least,
characters in a party need to have compatible
alignments. Nothing can destroy a campaign
faster than good-aligned characters and evil-
aligned characters in the same party deciding
to work against each other. Frankly, we’ve found
that evil alignments are better left to the mon-
sters and villains; player character parties work
out better when the characters take on good or
neutral alignments. Motivations for adventures
come together easier, character interaction
goes more smoothly, and the heroic aspects of
D&D shine through in ways that just don’t
happen when players play evil characters.

Closing with an epilogue
Save about 15 minutes or so at the end of the game session to handle the epi-
logue. Here’s where you let the players have a brief post-game discussion,
where they can make a few preliminary plans within your hearing (to help
you plan for the next session better) and where you can provide information
that needs to be jotted down in notes or on character sheets. 
Review the encounters for the session and calculate experience points for 
the party. 
You can find the XP tables and the rules for calculating experience points on
page 38 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
Allow the players to review with you any treasure and magic items they
found so that you can tell them what they found or remind them that they
might have to use research or magic in a future session to discover just what
that strange glowing wand actually does. You might also want to set up some
post-game activities for the players to deal with between sessions. Have them
decide what they want to do next (if you haven’t left them at an obvious next
step in the adventure) and let you know before the next session. If the break
occurred at a place where this is possible, let them go shopping for their
characters, upgrade their characters, or look for a new rules supplement to
add to the game for the next session — all pending your approval, of course.
44
Part I: Running a Great Game 
The best combat encounters
Although it might be easiest to design, pitting a
single monster (no matter what its Challenge
Rating) against a party of adventurers rarely
makes for a fun or exciting encounter. The party
gets to act four or more times in a round
(depending on how many player characters are
in the group), but even the fiercest, most pow-
erful monster gets to act only once. Those odds
are just too much in favor of the PCs. For more
interesting (albeit harder to run) encounters, we
suggest designing encounters that pit the
adventuring party against two to five opponents.
Those opponents might be of the same type
(four skeletons) or a mixed band (an evil sor-
cerer and four skeletons). Multiple opponents
give the PCs more to think about, give the mon-
sters more chances to do things in a round, and
make the battlefield more exciting and dynamic
as PCs and opponents move around to gain tac-
tical advantages.

A
t its best, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is more than a just a series of
extended combat encounters. It’s the ultimate interactive story, where
players and Dungeon Master alike help determine what happens next. To
make sure that the story gets as much of your attention as moderating the
rules, we use this chapter to get you into the basics of the DM’s role as narra-
tor and a cast of thousands. With a better understanding of how to approach
those two related roles, a DM can improve the story-related aspects of the
D&D experience.
Understanding D&D as a 
Storytelling Experience
Without even trying, the D&D game tells a story. That story revolves around
the player characters, and it grows with every action the player characters
perform, every monster they defeat, and every challenge they overcome.
Imagine what happens if you do a little planning and preparation! With fore-
shadowing, plotting, memorable villains, and spectacular locales, the story
aspects of the game can shine through in exciting, tense, and fun ways.

The group story concept
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game provides a fun, interactive method for telling
group stories in a fantasy setting. What’s a group story? A group story is a
story told cooperatively by a group of people. A D&D group story uses the
setting and game mechanics to provide a framework for how a group story
unfolds. It isn’t a story in the traditional sense; the scenes that make up the
story come together as the players play the game.
The DM contributes to the group story by providing the world in which the
game takes place, establishing the setup and background for every adven-
ture, and by playing the monsters, villains, and other nonplayer characters
that inhabit the world.
Speaking of the world, the DM can simply let the implied world of D&D shine
through or use an existing campaign world, such as FORGOTTEN REALMS or
EBERRON (both of which require relatively little work), or the DM can create
his or her own campaign setting for the adventures. (See Chapter 23 for
advice and suggestions for creating your own campaign world.)
The players contribute to the story by creating the characters they’re going
to play. These are the heroes of the story, the protagonists that eventually
become the true movers and shakers of the campaign — if you play long
enough for them to reach the highest levels of the game. Remember that the
player characters provide the interface for interacting with the imaginary
world of D&D. But they can be so much more than that. As players imagine
the backgrounds and personalities of their characters, their quirks and man-
nerisms, their goals and desires, they use these tools to contribute to the
group story.
When the player characters encounter monsters or some other form of
danger, and when the dice hit the table, that’s when the actions of players
and Dungeon Master alike contribute to and influence the ongoing group
story. Because everyone contributes to the story and because of the random-
izing element of dice, no one knows what’s really going to happen next. And
therein lies the power and fun of the D&D game.
An ongoing epic
Other games have a set beginning, middle, and end. Each session of D&D that
you play, however, is just one tale in a continuing epic set in a medieval world
where magic and monsters fill the land. This epic stars the characters that
the players create, characters that improve and develop from one adventure
46
Part I: Running a Great Game 

to the next. Events have consequences. Treasure, equipment, and magical
items that the player characters find can be saved and used in subsequent
adventures, and monsters and villains can escape to trouble them again in a
future game session. So, your adventures — your group stories — operate
just like the episodes of a weekly television series or like individual novels in
a trilogy or series.
The DM’s role
So, to bring it all back to you, the Dungeon Master, here’s an overview of your
role in all this: 
1. You select the adventures to run for the players (either creating them
yourself or using published adventures).
2. You create the campaign in which these adventures take place (either
overtly, with lots of planning, or just by letting the world develop natu-
rally with each adventure you run).
3. You narrate the adventure by setting each scene and describing the
results of the player characters’ actions.
4. You portray the cast of thousands that inhabit the world, playing all the
characters that aren’t the player characters — the extras, the friends
and foes, the monsters. (It really never adds up to thousands, by the
way. That just sounds more impressive than “a cast of dozens.”)
Telling Interesting and Exciting Stories
Rule number one: Don’t get too attached to your story idea. Sure, the DM 
sets up the particulars of a story, but the group determines how it plays out.
Really, your task as the DM is to set up the story idea (or premise), a back-
ground, a cast of monsters and any nonplayer characters you think you need,
and the opening event that kicks off the adventure. After that, you have to let
the player characters lead the way. If you try to push them in a direction they
don’t want to go, the story will feel forced and the game might break down.
Let the player characters do what they want and go where they will, and the
story will come together naturally and in surprising ways.
You have plenty of tools to help you with this, not the least of which are the
encounters you’ve prepared (either on your own or by using a published
adventure). Encounters make up the scenes of the story, but they usually
aren’t constructed to happen in any particular order. Sure, in the sample
47
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

adventure presented in Chapter 7, we number the encounters and present
them in a particular order. How the player characters navigate the dungeon,
which doors they open or pass by, which corridors they decide to explore
and in what order, determines when and how the encounters are . . . well . . .
encountered.
Here’s the big secret to running a great adventure and telling a fantastic
group story: The action and the drama take place in the encounters. As good
as the premise you create might be, as intricate as the plot you decide to
weave becomes, the story happens in the encounters. That’s where the play-
ers and DM come together to perform actions, make decisions, and ultimately
advance the story with good roleplaying, good tactics, and a lot of dice rolling.
So, as the DM, you have to let the encounters and what happens in them
override whatever plot you imagined for the story. Again, it isn’t your story.
It’s the group’s story. And the group needs the freedom to tell it. 
Does this mean that your perfectly crafted plot (whether you made it up
yourself or purchased an adventure) is subject to the whims of the player
characters? For the most part, yes. You can use advanced techniques to steer
the plot or get the story back on track if it strays too far from your outline (as
we describe in Chapter 11), but for now just go with the flow and see where
the group’s imagination takes the story. 
Making a story a D&D story
D&D adventures are all set in world that’s roughly equivalent to medieval
Europe. The rules of D&D become the physics of the world — magic works,
monsters are real, and heroic adventurers journey across the land. Every typ-
ical D&D setting needs to follow certain conventions:
 D&D worlds are medieval. Medieval in this context means that no
modern technology is available in the world. Characters wear armor and
wield melee weapons such as longswords and battle axes. The best mun-
dane ranged weapon is the longbow because gunpowder doesn’t exist in
the worlds of D&D. The world has progressed to something akin to the
medieval period of European history, but the knob has been turned up
as far as the fantasy is concerned. Castles and temples dot the land-
scape. People walk or ride horses (or more exotic mounts) to get around.
Farms are plentiful in the settled lands, but vast reaches of unexplored
wilderness spread out around these pockets of civilization, and when
the maps say “Here be dragons,” you should really heed those words.
Note that this isn’t historical medieval, but instead is the medieval world
of fairy tales, novels, fantasy movies, and, well, of D&D. It’s all Camelot
and knights and Robin Hood, as seen in movies and novels.
48
Part I: Running a Great Game 

 D&D worlds are permeated with magic. From magic-using classes
(such as wizards, sorcerers, druids, and clerics) to magic items of all
descriptions, the wonders of spells and arcane knowledge make for
exciting and mysterious trappings for stories and encounters. Because
of the presence of magic, the medieval setting becomes wondrous and
frightening. With magic, heroes can accomplish miracles, villains can
launch plots to take over or destroy the world, and a sense of wonder
(both dark and light) fills the land.
 D&D worlds are filled with monsters. The monsters come in all shapes
and sizes. Some are relentlessly evil, others overtly friendly, and many
can show up to help or hinder adventurers as their own whims and the
needs of the story dictate. In many ways, monsters are the ultimate man-
ifestation of magic in the land, for most D&D creatures depend on magic
to exist, if not to survive. Undead monsters, misshapen creatures, giants,
and constructs of all descriptions — the monsters of D&D fill volumes
and provide you with a huge toolbox of opponents to challenge the
player characters.
Some DMs break these conventions when they create their own campaign
worlds, but we don’t recommend that until you have some experience and
rules knowledge under your belt. Indeed, some believe that if you change
these fundamental concepts too much, you are no longer playing the D&D
game. We say that as long as you start with these concepts and use the game
system, feel free to take your game in the direction that best suits you and
the players and leads to a fun and rewarding experience for everyone
involved.
Choosing an adventure premise
As a new DM, you should start with simple adventure premises. You can
always go for bigger and more complex story ideas later, when both you and
the other players have a better feel for the game. Adventure premises can
come from anywhere, just as long as you couch the premise in the conven-
tions of D&D. Pull a plot from a movie or novel and think about how it would
work set in a D&D world. You can draw inspiration from all kinds of sources.
The following list describes some simple adventure premises:
 Capture: The adventurers take a job to capture the leader of a 
marauding band of goblins that have been raiding the village and the
surrounding area.
 Discover: The adventurers seek to discover the hidden tomb of the
Knight of the Flaming Sword.
49
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

 Escape: The adventurers have been captured by the evil cleric of Hextor
and must find a way to escape the dungeon beneath the vile temple.
 Protect: The adventurers have been hired to protect the baron’s envoy
and get her safely to the meeting in Wellford, a village that lies on the
other side of the Forsaken Forest.
 Rescue: The adventurers must rescue the dwarf prince from the troll
Nurgo before the monster feasts on its captive’s royal flesh.
 Search: The adventurers come across an ancient dungeon just waiting
to be explored.
Mastering the Adventure Narration
You could make the comparison that a D&D game creates a movie that the
game group watches in its collective imagination. It’s the most interactive
and immersive movie ever created (at least until your next game session) 
but it kind of plays out as a movie nonetheless. Of course, you don’t film or
record this movie, and you can replay it only as a memory.
Still, just like a movie, your D&D game needs a few things. It needs stars, the
roles filled by the player characters. It needs a director, cool special effects,
and a cast of thousands, roles filled by the Dungeon Master. By manipulating
these roles, the DM narrates the adventure and brings together the elements
of the group story.
Directing the adventure
The Dungeon Master directs the action by establishing scenes and providing a
portion of the motivation that the player characters need to open the dungeon
door, leap down the dark hole, or otherwise head to where the action is. When
you use a published adventure, this material is provided for you. You get a
ready-to-use scene with background and setup material, as well as some hooks
and motivations to get the player characters (PCs) to interact with the scene. 
When you set the scene, make sure to play up the drama and tension of the
moment. Be descriptive. Show, don’t tell, the players what their characters
see and hear with strong adjectives and evocative language. Look to the
sample adventure in Chapter 7 for examples of this in action.
Your enticements need to be subtle enough not to hit the PCs like a brick, but
overt enough for them to notice. For example, in your description of the scene
before them, you can slip in that they see a glint of gold among the blanket of
50
Part I: Running a Great Game 

bones that cover the floor, or spot an ancient book lying open in a corner, or
notice an arcane glow from among the pile of weapons and armor, or hear the
muffled cry of a prisoner in distress. Not every scene or encounter needs this
kind of enticement, depending on the overall story and motivation of the player
characters, but once in a while it helps to move the PCs in a particular direction.
When the player characters take the bait, the encounter takes place in all its
glory. Keep these do’s and don’ts in mind:
 DM as Director Do’s:
• Do set the scene, describing what the PCs see, hear, and smell.
• Do exude drama and tension and excitement in your scene 
descriptions.
• Do show the players what their characters see, hear, and smell
with evocative language.
• Do entice the PCs to interact with the scene by subtly overt means.
 DM as Director Don’ts:
• Don’t tell the players what their characters are doing; that’s up to
them to decide.
• Don’t give away all the secrets of the encounter in your descrip-
tion; allow the players to experience the fun of working some of it
out for themselves.
• Don’t be boring; use evocative language when setting up encounters.
Adding special effects
Good fantasy movies need good special effects, and your D&D game is no
exception. The world where the player characters adventure is an imaginary
one, but the game works best when you and the players suspend your disbe-
lief and act as though it is real. The more real the characters and the world
feel, the better the roleplaying experience will be. That’s where the Dungeon
Master comes in.
By thinking in terms of a movie, the DM tries to make the imaginary action of
the D&D game as visual and as real as possible. The DM describes what the
player characters see and otherwise sense — make those descriptions as
vibrant and colorful as possible. Published adventures, such as the sample
adventure in Chapter 7, help by providing the basics of such descriptions for
you, but you need to breathe life into those descriptions by the way you pre-
sent them.
51
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

When you describe a monster, imagine that creature as it would look in your
favorite fantasy/science-fiction movie. When you narrate the effects of an
arcane spell, imagine it as a cool special effect exploding across the screen.
Remember that you have an unlimited budget for your special effects
because most of the action takes place in your group’s imagination, so spare
no expense in the telling of the story.
Use all five senses when you narrate. Don’t just tell the players what their
characters see; tell them what they hear, smell, taste, and feel, when appro-
priate. A depth of sensory descriptions promotes believability in the world
and a connection to the story.
Be consistent. No world, not even an imaginary one, should be arbitrary. If
you describe a door in the north wall of the chamber, it should be there later
when the player characters ask about it. And if it isn’t there from one
moment to the next, you need to have a good reason why not. A mysterious
door that fades in and out of existence is cool — as long as that’s what you
meant to do with it.
You need to get used to improvising. No adventure — not a published one,
not one you create from scratch — can account for every minute detail or
every possibility. As the DM, you need to provide the little extras that make a
scene believable, and you need to be ready to wing it when the player charac-
ters decide to do something that the adventure writer didn’t think of. Be
inventive, be creative, and have fun when these moments occur. In general,
they lead to the scenes that everyone will remember most strongly.
Finally, you need to be responsive to the players. When the players need
more information about what’s around them, provide more detail. Let them
ask questions, and provide the answers in ways that build the story, provide
drama, and still make them work for the hidden details and the secrets of the
encounter. On the other hand, when the players get bored with your exposi-
tion and want to get to the action, stop talking and start fighting!
Although most of the special effects at your command involve evocative
descriptions, exciting delivery, and abundant imagination, remember that
cool play surfaces and miniatures can help you and the players better visual-
ize the action of the story. Illustrated battle maps, such as those available in
many published adventures and Fantastic Locations accessory products,
describe the area where an encounter takes place. Even dry erase or wet
erase battle grids, where you make a rough sketch of the encounter area,
help players get a better idea about the tactical situation their characters
find themselves in. And miniatures or other tokens that represent the PCs
and the monsters they face provide all the foundation you need to help
everyone’s imagination kick into high gear. See Chapter 11 for more on using
visual and tactical aids in the game.

 DM as Special Effects Wizard Do’s:
• Do treat the game as a cinematic event.
• Do describe what characters can discern with all five senses when
providing narration.
• Do pull out all stops when describing your special effects — you
do have an unlimited budget, after all.
• Do be consistent in your descriptions of people, places, and things.
• Do be willing to improvise when players try unexpected things.
• Do be responsive to the needs of the players; expand descriptions
when they need more information and cut your narration short
when they’re ready to get to the action.
• Do use battle maps, miniatures, and other visual aids to help the
players better imagine the scene.
 DM as Special Effects Wizard Don’ts:
• Don’t use bland language and technical terms when narrating the
action.
• Don’t use gamespeak (rules, terms, and jargon) when narrating 
the story.
• Don’t be arbitrary in your descriptions of people, places, and things.
• Don’t refuse to improvise when the players take the unexpected
path.
• Don’t stick to your script when the players want more or fewer nar-
rative elements from you.
Playing the nonplayer characters
The players control the heroes of your D&D game, the player characters. You
control all the other characters that inhabit the world — the monsters, the
villains, the patrons, the villagers, and so on. We collectively call this cast of
thousands the nonplayer characters (NPCs). Just like the players, you strive to
give your characters unique personalities and memorable traits. When the
details come together, your NPCs come alive.
You get to portray everyone in the world who isn’t one of the player charac-
ters. These are your characters, and they run the gamut from the shopkeeper
and innkeeper who provide goods and services for the player characters to
the foul vampire lord raising undead monsters in the catacombs beneath the
53
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

ruined temple. Although your world might have thousands or even millions
of people in it, you need to deal with only the dozen or so that the player
characters might actually decide to interact with in a given adventure. The
following subsections provide some tips for creating and controlling interest-
ing nonplayer characters.
Villains and other opponents
As DM, you get to do something unique in the D&D game — you get to play
the bad guys! Running the characters that challenge and oppose the adven-
turers is one of your primary roles, and it provides you with a lot of fun, too.
For the monsters and opponents that are meant to face the adventurers in a
single encounter, you don’t need to worry about details beyond what you
need to run the encounter. For major villains and recurring opponents, give
some thought to fleshing out their personalities and motivations. Consider
why they’re doing what they’re doing, why they’re in the location where the
player characters encounter them, and how they interact with the things
around them. (This is important when building dungeon environments espe-
cially.) Vary the intelligence of your opponents. Villains don’t have to be
stupid. Make some of your bad guys as dumb as rocks, others as smart as
rocket scientists (or at least the medieval equivalent of rocket scientists),
and let the rest fill the gamut between.
Don’t be afraid to make your villains totally evil. The worse they are, the
more satisfying it will be for the player characters to defeat them. That said,
not every opponent that sets out to challenge your adventurers needs to be
evil. Well-intentioned do-gooders, good NPCs with an agenda that conflicts
with the player characters, or other adventurers who just want to get to the
treasure first, can make for interesting encounters or even whole adventures
every now and then.
Sometimes you’ll plan for a villain to have a major role in your campaign.
Other times, an opponent winds up proving just too evil and fun to use up in
a single encounter. That’s when you turn him (or her, or it) into a recurring
character. A recurring villain can be a constant thorn in the side of the adven-
turers or could show up infrequently, when they least expect it, to cause no
end of trouble. 
Allies, innocent bystanders, and everybody else
Although playing villains and monsters certainly takes up a lot of your non-
player character time, you also have to be ready to portray the rest of the
world’s population — at least those that come into contact with the player
characters. These types of NPCs provide information, resources, resting
places, expert assistance, background, obstacles, aid, motivation, amuse-
ment, and more for the player characters. They add color to the story. In
many cases, these kind of NPCs require only a name, a brief description, and
54
Part I: Running a Great Game 

a relevant skill or two. Since most if not all of the nonplayer characters that
fill this role are never meant to get into combat, you don’t have to worry
about giving them a full set of game statistics (or “statting them out”). 
Although some techniques work well in movies or novels, they don’t make for a
satisfying and fun game of D&D. Remember that it’s the player characters’ story
and that they should always get to be the heroes. For this reason, don’t create
NPCs that you use to constantly show them up, pull their fat out of the fire, or
otherwise leave the player characters with nothing heroic to do. For example,
never craft an adventure where the player characters need to be inactive to win
the day. It might have worked as the climax to Raiders of the Lost Ark, but you
never want the player characters to close their eyes and do nothing while some-
one or something else earns their victory for them. That just isn’t good D&D.
 DM as Nonplayer Character Do’s:
• Do give your nonplayer characters personality by creating quirks,
mannerisms, and oft-repeated phrases.
• Do ham it up and use different voices for different types of charac-
ters. (One DM we know imagines particular actors in the roles
of his NPCs, and he imitates those actors when playing his NPCs.
His imitations are terrible, but they add to the fun and make every
NPC feel unique.)
• Do talk in character and encourage the players to do the same.
• Do be consistent, remember the names and mannerisms of the
NPCs you introduce, and take notes so you can pick them up again
when they appear in a future encounter or adventure.
 DM as Nonplayer Character Don’ts:
• Don’t waste time by overstating your nonplayer characters; give
them only the stats and skills they’ll need for the role you want
them to play in the adventure.
• Don’t use nonplayer characters to overshadow or outshine the
player characters.
• Don’t take the side of the monsters or players when running NPCs;
instead, play NPCs to the fullest without actively making things
easy or difficult for the player characters.
Bringing the Adventure to Life
You’ve figured out how to narrate your adventure. You have a handle on run-
ning the monsters and nonplayer characters. Now all you need to do is make
sure the rest of your adventure is as exciting and dramatic as you can make
55
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

it. The following sections provide a couple ideas to keep in mind, whether
you’re creating your own adventure or using a published one, such as the
adventure we present in Chapter 7.
Creating fantastic locations
Every DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure requires an amazing and imaginative
location to help drive home the fantastic elements of the game. Sometimes
the entire adventure takes place in a single area; other times the adventurers
travel from one fantastic location to another to accomplish their goals.
Because the only limit to the worlds you create is your own imagination, try
to think big, think amazing, think strange and exotic, and think fantastic. Why
set an encounter in just any old woods when you can send the player charac-
ters into the heart of the Everdark Forest? In a world where magic exists, you
don’t even have to be limited by mundane, real-world physics. Let the player
characters scale a mile-high castle tower, or explore a coral maze deep
beneath the Blood Sea, or invade the lava-filled mines deep below the
Forbidden Mountains. 
No matter what type of encounter you plan to run (combat, challenge, or
roleplaying), you can make the encounter that much more memorable and
fantastic by setting it in an extraordinary location. Imagine running a battle
along a crystal bridge that spans a jagged chasm or challenging the player
characters to cross a ruined expanse as fountains of flame erupt from the
ground without apparent rhyme or reason. What about presenting a roleplay-
ing encounter in an exotic marketplace filled with fantastic beings of all
descriptions?
The adventures we present in Chapters 7 and 20, as well as the advice strewn
throughout Part III, should provide you with plenty of examples of fantastic
locations and advice on how to use them to get your own imagination flowing.
Describing intense battles
At its heart, the D&D game revolves around combat. Heroic adventurers must
often battle foul villains and vile monsters in order to save the day. When you
get to a combat encounter, make sure that you narrate the action in such a
way as to generate drama and excitement for everyone involved. The selec-
tion of opponents, both how tough they are and how many of them are
involved, takes care of a lot of this, but you still need to bring the intensity
and danger home with your narration of the action.
56
Part I: Running a Great Game 

For example, don’t just relay information in dry gamespeak. Liven it up with
evocative imagery and powerful language. Paint a picture with your words.
The following list shows a boring and a more interesting way of narrating
combat:
57
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

 Weak narration: “The hobgoblin attacks.” [DM makes the attack roll.]
“18 — that hits your character.” [DM rolls for damage.] “The hobgoblin
does 6 points of damage. Then it takes a 5 foot step away from your
character. Your turn.”
 Stronger narration: “The huge hobgoblin roars a challenge, and the 
terrible smell of its breath crashes against you like a wave. It swings its
jagged longsword,” [DM makes the hobgoblin’s attack roll, sees that it
succeeds, and rolls for damage] “connecting with a bone-rattling strike
that deals 6 points of damage. With a wicked grin, the hobgoblin leaps
back 5 feet and barks a guttural laugh as it prepares to strike again.”
Combat encounters demand opponents, a location, complications, and a goal
to make things interesting. The following list briefly examines these concepts:
 Opponents: Although simple to run, a party of player characters against
a single opponent makes for a weak encounter. You want to pit the
player characters against multiple opponents, usually with a mix of dif-
ferent types of monsters. Why? Because if you throw a single monster at
the party of adventurers, it gets to act once for every four (or more)
times the player characters act in a round. That isn’t fun for you, it isn’t
a particularly interesting challenge for the players, and it just doesn’t
make for an exciting encounter. (Some powerful and complex monsters
can work by themselves, but even they can benefit from having a little
help in the form of weaker and simpler minions.) You’d do better to
throw multiple monsters of the same type (six orcs, for example) at the
player characters, or for a real challenge, make it a mixed encounter
(say, two orcs and a worg).
 Location: Just like in a movie, your scene or encounter will become
more exciting and memorable if it takes place in an exciting and memo-
rable location. Why set up a fight in a plain old dungeon chamber when
you can set it in a dungeon chamber with walls of glistening stone and a
floor of black obsidian that makes for slippery footing? Or what if the floor
is covered in the bones of the monster’s earlier victims? Remember that
anything you can imagine you can throw into your encounter locations.
Not every location needs to be fantastic and complex, so save the really
cool stuff for your major encounters, but don’t be afraid to put a few
twists and some detail into every location you present.
 Complications: Now, don’t overuse this technique, but you can make a
standard combat encounter more exciting and dangerous by throwing in
a complication or two. What do we mean? Well, the slippery floor in the
preceding bullet shows one kind of complication. Suddenly, in addition
to battling whatever opponents are in the encounter, the player charac-
ters must also worry about slipping and falling. Or what if the pile of
bones they have to walk over shifts and slides and sometimes gives way
58
Part I: Running a Great Game 

to plunge a character into bony darkness? Complications can also take
the form of traps, hazards, innocents in distress, or anything else that
forces the player characters to split their attention between their oppo-
nents and something else.
 Goal: The goal of most combat encounters is to defeat the opponents
and move on. For example, the player characters might need to fight
their way past the ogres guarding the gate of the evil sorcerer’s keep,
survive the sudden attack of a hungry umber hulk, or slay the foul
bebilith who guards the holy relic they seek. How the player characters
achieve that goal makes up the action of the encounter.
Giving the players exciting challenges
Another type of encounter the player characters might face is the challenge
encounter. A challenge encounter requires many of the same foundation
items as seen in the combat encounter. However, the opponent in a challenge
is the challenge itself.
What’s a challenge? It’s anything that requires the player characters to think,
make skill checks or ability checks, or use spells or tools in clever ways to
overcome the challenge and move on. Traps, natural hazards, locked doors,
gaping chasms, and other environmental or constructed obstacles constitute
challenges.
Perhaps more so than in the combat encounter, the DM’s narration of a chal-
lenge encounter can make or break a scene. Because many challenges can be
overcome or failed with a single die roll, you need to find other ways to build
tension and heighten the drama. Some techniques include combining a chal-
lenge with a combat encounter (where the challenge becomes a complication
of the battle), providing multiple challenges that must be overcome to
advance, and creating a complex challenge that requires a series of skill or
ability checks to defeat. See Chapter 14 for more on crafting good challenge
encounters.
Setting up evocative roleplaying 
encounters
All encounters should provide opportunities for roleplaying. In combat
encounters, the player characters might exchange insults and taunts with the
bad guys. In challenge encounters, the player characters might discuss, in
character, the best methods for overcoming the challenge as time ticks by.
59
Chapter 4: Narrating the Adventure

But you do have an encounter format to use to build adventures that requires
roleplaying as the primary activity: the roleplaying encounter.
In roleplaying encounters, the player characters must talk to, convince, bluff,
bribe, negotiate, intimidate, or otherwise interact with nonplayer characters
to advance the plot. In addition to roleplaying their characters, players might
be called upon to make skill checks — but only sparingly — to augment the
roleplaying and help you determine the reactions of the NPCs. Roleplaying
encounters can often lead to combat or challenge encounters, depending on
where the interaction takes you. Use all the same tricks and narration tech-
niques you would for other types of encounters, and roleplaying encounters
will come together — often in ways that are more fun and memorable than
combat or challenge encounters!

In This Chapter
 Examining D&D as a social event
 Understanding the game group concept
 Exploring the relationship between players and DMs
 Dealing with mistakes
 Exploring the idea of sharing the DM role
T
he Dungeon Master has a unique relationship with the other players. In
this chapter, we focus on the interaction between DM and players and
how to use that interaction to make for a more memorable and enjoyable
gaming experience. 
D&D: A Social Experience
Some people go bowling every Saturday night. Some people get together
every other Thursday for a few hands of poker. Some people meet up once a
week to have dinner parties, to watch DVDs, or to play board games. Some
people do all these things and more and still find time to have a weekly or
monthly DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game session. Just like any other social experi-
ence, a D&D game requires a time, a place, and a group of friends. The best way
to keep your game group together and ensure that everyone wants to return for
each session (and in most cases, can’t wait for the next session) is to remember
that a D&D session is a social experience and to treat it accordingly.
D&D is a game. A game session needs to be fun. D&D is a social experience.
Social experiences need to be fun. (See a pattern developing here?) The best
way to maximize your fun potential is to make sure that everything you need
to feed both the game and the social experience are ready and available for
the game session. Make sure that everyone in the game group shares in this
aspect of the session — no one player (not even the DM) should be responsi-
ble for bringing all these things together. Social experiences require locations

and participants. In the case of D&D, you need a place to play and you need
players. Social experiences need refreshments. For a D&D game, this could
include a full meal (lunch or dinner) at most, snacks and drinks at least. Make
sure that whatever plan you choose is agreed upon by the rest of the group
and that everyone shares in the expense. Finally, you need the game itself,
and that’s mostly in the hands of the Dungeon Master to provide.
If you skipped Chapter 2, take a look at that chapter before pulling together a
game session. It shows you how to prepare to run a game session, and the rest
of this chapter discusses the relationship between the DM and the players.
Looking at the Game Group
A D&D game group consists of at least one Dungeon Master (though some-
times multiple players share this role) and a number of players that regularly
get together for the express purpose of socializing and playing the DUNGEONS
& DRAGONS game. Some game groups have just enough players, but others
have a bigger membership with the idea that not everyone can make it to
every game session. A few groups have such a small membership that play-
ers routinely control multiple characters in an adventure.
None of these group models is inherently better than the others. You work
with what you have or what you feel comfortable with to get to the ultimate
goal — to have fun playing D&D.
Comparing DMs and Players
The Dungeon Master’s primary role, especially from the players’ perspective
(though most players might not consciously realize this), is to help the play-
ers find the fun in the game. This happens in subtle ways, as the DM sets up
situations, encounters, and adventure hooks. It happens in overt ways, when
the DM controls the pacing of a scene to get the player characters to where
the action is — even if the DM has to bring the action to them. Sometimes
players fumble around following a false lead or going after an incidental
occurrence that has caught their imagination but has nothing to do with
the adventure the DM is running. In such a case, you might steer them back
on track by inserting an encounter that gets them back into your plot, or
you might wing it and see where the players’ interest takes you. Winging it
is a little harder, though, and we discuss the fine art of making stuff up in
Chapter 10.
62
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Being the DM
The first rule to remember when you’re the Dungeon Master is that neither
you nor the players can learn everything at once. As you learn the rules, dis-
cuss them with the players so that they learn them, too. Take it slowly and
have fun, and everything will work out fine.
Your role as the DM is to make the game fun for the players and for yourself.
Nothing else should take priority over this DM responsibility. Whatever con-
stitutes a fun experience for you and the players is the right way to go, even if
that style of play goes against everything we say in these pages. That said,
use this advice and tailor it so that it applies to you and your game group.
Your best skill, one that we can’t teach you in the game or in this book, is
communication. That’s the key to excelling at all of the many roles that the
DM must fill in the game. Become not only a good speaker but a good listener,
and you will transform from a good DM into a great one.
Interacting with players
The following list provides pointers to help you interact and communicate
with the players in the best possible way:
 Be fair. You need to earn the trust of the players. When they trust you to
treat their characters fairly, they’ll cheerfully ignore rules mistakes and
hesitations in the action as long as they believe you’re playing fair and
that you aren’t picking on them. 
 Be consistent. If a rule works a specific way on one encounter, it should
work that way all the time. If a nonplayer character has a limp and talks
with a strange accent, that character should behave the same way the
next time the player characters meet him or her.
 Be impartial. You may play the monsters and villains as smart and pow-
erful or dumb and weak, depending on their role in the adventure, but
you still need to impartially interpret the rules when it comes to resolv-
ing actions between PCs and NPCs. If you don’t deal impartially in this
area, you will lose the trust of the players. And that’s bad for you and for
the game group.
As DM, you sometimes have to mediate disagreements between players,
and in these situations you need to be impartial as well. Whether the
players can’t agree over the best way to divide treasure, or if one player’s
action harms another player’s character, or whatever the issue winds up
63
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

being, you need to help them reach a fair and equitable resolution so
that everyone can get back to the game. The game is fun; arguments
aren’t fun. Mediate the conflict with calm words, logic, and good humor.
And, when all else fails, let the dice decide. Who gets the +2 flaming
longsword? Either the character who can use it or would benefit most
from it, or the character whose player rolls the highest result on a d20. 
 Be entertaining. You are the narrator and the cast of thousands that
inhabit the world. You are the window through which the players experi-
ence the fun and adventure, so strive to be as entertaining as possible.
Play your villains and monsters with gusto. Make the players really
despise or hate or feel sorry for the bad guy, as appropriate to the story.
Use evocative and exciting language to describe environments, scenes,
and the action of the adventure. Make every moment action-packed, sus-
pense-filled, scary, funny, or tense, as appropriate for the scene and the
situation. When the whole group gets caught up in the fun of the story,
that’s entertainment!
 Be prepared. You don’t do yourself or the players any favors if you
aren’t ready to run the game session. Better to engage in a different
activity than to try to run a D&D adventure when you haven’t made all
the necessary preparations. You can alleviate some of the work by
selecting a ready-to-run adventure, such as the ones presented in this
book, but even then you need to read and review that material before
sitting down to run the game. When you use published adventures,
study the way they are designed so you can use some of the same tricks
when you get around to crafting your own adventures. Be organized, be
ready, and be prepared, and the game session will run that much more
smoothly.
64
Part I: Running a Great Game 
It isn’t a competition
You aren’t competing against the players. The
D&D roleplaying game is a cooperative game,
not a competitive one. The victory conditions
consist of having fun and telling an exciting
group story. The player characters work
together to accomplish their team goals; they
don’t seek to beat, defeat, or otherwise achieve
individual wins.
Likewise, it isn’t you against them. Even though
the DM runs the monsters and villains, the DM
doesn’t win the game by defeating the player
characters. Sure, that result might happen
occasionally, as long as it happens fairly and
still leads to a satisfying story. Many players’
D&D memories include great tales of sorrow
and tragedy as the heroes went down in a blaze
of glory against a powerful and hated foe. But
this should be the natural outcome of good and
fair play. Never use your powers as DM to go
out of your way to destroy the player charac-
ters. That isn’t fair. It’s just mean and will lead to
the disintegration of your game group. It all goes
back to that trust thing.

What do you want out of the game?
Here’s a great discussion topic for you and the game group to bat around before
you get too far into your D&D play: What does everyone want out of the game?
As DM, you should honestly tell the players why you want to run D&D, what
you hope to get out of it, and how you imagine the campaign developing if
everyone sticks with it. Initially, this might be as simple as saying “I want to
try this roleplaying game thing because it looks interesting and I think it will
be fun.” Later, you might develop deeper goals related to creativity, story-
telling, world-building, and so on. Or, you might still just want to run D&D
games because it’s a fun thing to do.
Players might have all kinds of reasons for wanting to play, but initially they
might not have any expectations. Some players like the creativity of building
a character and playing a role, immersing themselves in the story and the
fantasy of D&D. Others like the action and combat aspects of the game, and
the highlights for them occur every time a new monster arrives on the scene
to challenge them. Others get into the game mechanics, looking to maximize
their characters through smart play and statistical optimization. 
This eventually leads to deciding on the style of D&D game you want to run
to best meet these expectations. Chapter 9 goes into this topic in more depth
because it isn’t something you should try to figure out as a new Dungeon
Master. That said, here’s a brief rundown on some typical game styles so you
can get a sense about the different styles of the D&D game:
 Hack’n’slash: A straightforward, action-oriented style of play that
focuses on fighting monsters and getting treasure. Little time is spent
developing the roleplaying side of player characters, you provide few
encounters that don’t involve combat, and the story never strays very
far from the dungeon. This style is also called kick in the door adventur-
ing. We usually refer to players who prefer this style of play to be power
gamers. Power gamers usually work to maximize their statistics and abil-
ities to take full advantage of the game mechanics.
 Deep-immersion storytelling: Talking, roleplaying, and developing com-
plex personas for every player character take center stage in this style
of play. Entire game sessions might pass without a single die being
rolled. The story is the thing here, as well as character development and
character interaction. Combat encounters are few and far between as
adventures deal with intrigue, negotiations, and political maneuvering.
We usually refer to players who prefer this style of play to be roleplayers.
 Something in between: More than likely, your campaign and play style will
eventually develop into something that falls somewhere between the hack-
’n’slash and deep-immersion storytelling extremes. The best adventures
have a good mix of action, story, and interaction to keep all players happy. 
65
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

In the end, there is no right or wrong way to play D&D. Just match the style
to the overall personality and desires of the group so that everyone can have
fun playing the game.
66
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Increasing the fun quotient
The DM can increase the game group’s fun quotient by following a few simple
principles, as we describe in the following list:
 Understand the players. Although discussing what they might want out
of the game is a good start, a DM also has to observe indirect cues and
play patterns to fully understand the players.
 Provide something for everyone. When you figure out what the players
want (through discussion, observation, or both), you can adjust the
adventures to cater to each of them. Depending on the group, you can
deal with this collectively (by adjusting the play style) or individually
(by providing encounters that speak to each player in turn).
 Maintain a high level of energy. Players take their cues from the DM, so
you need to keep your enthusiasm up, your level of energy high, and
your sense of excitement focused and on track. The players will respond
and perform likewise.
 Move it, move it, move it. Pacing is everything. Never take away the play-
ers’ sense of control over the actions of their characters, but develop the
skills to nudge them along or reshape the adventure to minimize slow
periods, keep the action going, and help bring the players back to the fun.
Periodically look around the gaming table and ask yourself this question: Are
we having fun? If the answer is “yes,” don’t worry too much about pacing and
action. If your group is enjoying a long negotiation with a swaggering bug-
bear, let the scene play out. If you look around and see players fiddling with
their dice, looking bored, or starting to get distracted, the answer must be a
resounding “no.” That’s when you need to make an adjustment, move the
adventure along, and help the players find the fun. When all else fails, have a
wandering monster show up, or have a villain kick in the door, or have some
other event occur to get the group back to the action.
Setting Ground Rules and Expectations
To help you get along with the players, we suggest that you work together to
establish some ground rules that have nothing to do with the game itself but
can help everyone know what to expect from the interactions around the
table. The following sections describe some of the issues that might eventu-
ally crop up around the gaming table. It helps if you discuss these things with
the players and decide on answers before you get too far into your campaign.
67
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

Staying serious or hungering for humor?
Do you envision your D&D campaign as a serious story (in the tradition of
The Lord of the Rings) or a humorous romp through the dungeon (in the spirit
of Monty Python and the Holy Grail)? Either can work and be used to create a
fun experience, but it’s better if you and the players agree on how you want
to approach your fantasy before getting too far into an adventure. Nothing
can destroy a game group faster than a DM intent on running a serious game
when the players want to crack jokes and turn everything into a comedy.
Bear in mind that even the most serious stories benefit from moments of
humor, especially in the form of a wise-cracking hero or a funny villain. 
We recommend that you approach your campaign and the adventures that
comprise it in a serious manner. Let the humor come naturally, around the
table, with you playing it straight so that the tone remains heroic and fantas-
tic. Keep the in-game action tense and suspenseful, though it can be fun to
throw in the occasional light-hearted encounter or adventure. 
Naming characters
The names you give to nonplayer characters say a lot about the world you’re
building. Strive for consistency so that your world feels real. Strive for reality,
for the same reason. The same is true of place names, where just a little
thought and care can help paint a fantastic picture of your D&D world.
Encourage the players to approach the naming game with the same care and
creativity. Player character names should be of a similar style and consis-
tency to help set the tone of the adventuring team. For example, a group that
includes Elfy the elf, Joen of Arc, Regdar, Brightwand the wizard, and Barney
the barbarian winds up coming off silly and comical. This can be bad if the
DM is running a serious and tense campaign world.
Managing multiple characters
The number of player characters per player might ultimately be decided by
how many players are in the game group, but you and the players should
come to an agreement. This is a two-fold question: How many characters can
each player create, and how many can they play at the table?
In general, we recommend that a player creates and runs a single character at
a time. If the players want to try their hands at different character concepts,
you might try running short campaigns that start over on a regular basis, or
68
Part I: Running a Great Game 

using multiple DMs in the group (as we discuss in the “Sharing DM Duties”
section, later in this chapter). 
On the other hand, if your game group doesn’t have enough players for each
to bring one character to the table and field an adventuring party of at least
four characters, you might want to allow one or more of the players to create
and play a second character. Always encourage the better or more experi-
enced players to run the extra characters, and constantly remind them that
they have to play the characters as individuals — not as a single character
that gets to do twice as much in a round.
Handling no-shows
It’s going to happen. Someone is going to miss a game session. You need to
decide how many people can miss a game and still have enough players for
you to run the adventure. Then you have to determine what to do with the
characters of the no-show players if you do decide that the game must go on.
There’s no single answer to the question of how many players constitute a
quorum for your game group. If you have a large group, you might decide
that the game goes on as long as three players show up for the game. You
might even be comfortable running a game for one or two players, though the
rest of the group might prefer that the game wait for them. Talk this through
with the group, come to a solution that works for the majority, and then stick
to that solution.
If a player or two is missing and the game is going forward anyway, you also
need to determine what to do with the characters whose players aren’t at the
table. Here are some methods for dealing with the characters of missing players:
 Have another player run the missing player’s character. That means
that for this game session, one player controls two characters. This is
easiest on the DM but could be problematic if the fill-in player resents
the extra work or if the missing player doesn’t like what happened to his
or her character during the session.
 The DM runs the missing player’s character as if the character were
an NPC. This approach can often be the best solution, but you should
avoid this option if you think it will be too much work for you and might
harm the rest of the session. Often when we do this, we keep the missing
player’s character away from the front lines, try to use the character’s
abilities in the same manner as the missing player, and usually have one
of the other players roll dice for the character.
 The character, like the player, misses the game session. Depending on
where you are in the adventure, this isn’t always the most practical or
69
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

logical solution, but it does keep the character safe while the player is
away. In this scenario, the character stays back to guard the camp, goes
to town on personal business, travels ahead to secure lodging in the
next village you plan to visit, or whatever other reason you can come up
with to allow for the character to disappear for a session. Hopefully, the
next session picks up at a point in the adventure in which the character
can jump back in with a minimum of fuss and bother.
 The character fades into the background for the session, following
along but doing nothing. Because this strains the credibility of the 
character and the world, it is the least desirable solution, but you can
use it if that’s what you and the players believe will work out best for
your group.
Adding new players
Players come and players go. It happens. People move. People get busy.
People decide that they want to do something else with their time. Hopefully,
you’ll also have new players waiting in the wings to join the group when this
happens. First, discuss a potential new player with the group to make sure
everyone is comfortable with this person joining them. Then bring the new
player up to speed on the campaign and the various house rules that you and
the group use. Finally, you have to integrate the new character into the cam-
paign in a logical and fun way. The group can meet the new character on the
road, rescue him or her from the dungeon, find him or her at a guild hall, or
any number of other ways you and the players can imagine. 
You also need to decide what level to start the new character at. We recom-
mend that the new player create a character that is the same level as the rest
of the game group. So, if the players have 5th-level characters in the game,
have the new player create a 5th-level character to join them.
Dealing with dice
Encourage everyone to eventually get their own set of dice. Personal dice
become associated with a favorite character, and all kinds of rituals concern-
ing dice, luck, and the skill of the player will become wrapped up in a player’s
favorite set of dice.
You and the group need to decide how you want to treat dice in the game.
Any answer is the right answer to these questions, just so long as everyone
knows what to expect and you stay consistent.
70
Part I: Running a Great Game 

 What constitutes a cocked die that needs to be rerolled? When it lands
askew against a book, on a pencil, or atop a miniature?
 If a die falls off the table during a roll, do you use it as it lands or roll it
again so it stays on the table?
 Do you as the DM roll your dice in secret or in front of the players? What
about the players? Do you want to see their die rolls?
 Do you roll all the dice or do you let the players roll for their characters?
 Do you roll attack and damage dice at the same time, or do you roll them
separately?
Bringing books
What books do you want the players to have at the table, and do you want to
allow them to reference them during the game? In general, the only thing you
probably don’t want players looking up during an adventure are the statistics
in the Monster Manual of the monsters you just surprised them with, but
that’s up to you.
New D&D game supplements come out all the time. You need to decide how
you want to introduce new rules or content from these supplements into the
game. We recommend that when you find a new supplement or rule that you
want to add to the game, inform the players of this during one of your after-
session discussions. This way, they can explore the book and come back to
you if they find something in it they want to try with their characters (new
spells, feats, classes, prestige classes, or whatever). For new monsters or
magic items, no discussion is needed. Just drop the new feature into the next
logical location in your adventure.
On the other hand, players will also pick up D&D supplements that interest
them, and you should encourage them to discuss with you any content they
would like to try out in the game. If it looks okay to you, work with the player
to make the new content available in your campaign.
However you decide to handle this, we encourage you to use a BYOB policy.
It just makes good sense for everyone to “Bring Your Own Books” to the
game. A player, for example, should have his or her own copy of the Player’s
Handbook instead of constantly borrowing someone else’s during or after
the game. 
71
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

Debating rules
We recommend that you establish that rules discussions should occur
before the game starts or at the end of the session. That way, players won’t
question or challenge your rulings during the game itself, and the adventure
can proceed without incident. Afterward, discuss any issues the players have
with the way the game worked out. Minor mistakes on your part should be
admitted, but allow the progress of the adventure to stand as is. If, on the
other hand, you made a bad call that resulted in something terrible happen-
ing to the player characters, such as a character death, you should talk it
through and determine whether the scene should be played over. See the 
section, “Making Mistakes and Deciding What to Do with Them,” later in
this chapter.
Managing off-topic discussions
Insist that the players get all their off-topic discussions concerning work,
school, new movies, the latest episodes of favorite TV shows, or whatever
out of the way during the pre-game socializing period. During the game,
everyone needs to stay focused on their characters and the adventure. 
Still, people talk, and D&D is a social experience. Play it by ear and try to
keep everything fun, but you don’t want the entire game session to devolve
into jokes and chatter. You are there to play D&D, after all.
Considering computers
It’s increasingly common for players to bring laptops to the table so that they
can keep spreadsheets of their characters, notes on the campaign, and
resources to reference. This is usually okay, unless you have players who
spend so much time typing and looking at the screen that they aren’t paying
attention to the game. 
The computer can also be a powerful tool for you to use as the DM, but not 
if it draws your attention away from the table and takes up too much time.
Decide what you want the game table to look like and discuss it with the play-
ers so that you can set the right expectations for everyone.
72
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Setting the table with miniatures 
and a battle grid
The D&D game cries out for some kind of play surface and tokens to repre-
sent player characters and monsters. The game’s tactical elements work so
much better when the players can properly visualize the action. We suggest
using prepainted plastic D&D Miniatures, but any kind of tokens or markers
can suffice. Paper battle grids, such as the one in the Dungeon Master’s Guide
or the beautifully illustrated maps found in the Fantastic Locations products,
make great play surfaces. You can also find vinyl mats and plastic boards cov-
ered in one-inch squares that can be drawn upon with either wet- or dry-erase
markers. Use what works best for you and your game group, or try a variety of
play surfaces, depending on the encounter or adventure you’re running.
At the very least, we recommend having each player find a miniature to rep-
resent his or her character. This can be a metal miniature painstakingly
painted with tender, loving care, or a ready-to-use D&D Miniature that the
player found in your collection or in a booster pack. Let players make the
choice so that they feel a connection between the figures and their characters,
and so they can readily identify them on the battle grid when the action gets
hectic and chaotic — as battles are wont to do.
Making Mistakes and Deciding 
What to Do with Them
It’s inevitable. All DMs are human, and humans make mistakes. So, eventually,
you’re going to make a bad call while adjudicating a D&D game rule. That’s
okay. Sometimes, the players won’t even notice, especially if they’re caught
up in the excitement of the story or the drama of the encounter in question.
In general, as long as you followed some kind of logical approach to deciding
on a resolution, things should work out fine even if you didn’t follow the
letter of the law.
However, sometimes you’ll make a mistake and the players will call you on it.
Ask them to hold the discussion for after the session, and then review the
rule and the situation with them. Again, even if you got it wrong, most of the
time the solution you came up with probably works just fine and the adven-
ture can proceed without any need to redo a scene. When you get a rule
wrong and the player characters pay dearly for that, consider redoing the
scene in question. 
73
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

74
Part I: Running a Great Game 
Who rolls the dice?
As a general rule, we recommend that you roll
the dice for all monsters and NPCs, and that the
players roll the dice for their characters.
However, sometimes a die roll can reveal more
than you want the players to know. For exam-
ple, if a player rolls to search for a trap in a dun-
geon corridor, any result will color how that
player treats that corridor moving forward. A
poor roll tells the player that her character
should proceed cautiously, because a trap
could be somewhere ahead. A good roll, on the
other hand, reveals a hidden trap or sounds the
all-clear, allowing the characters to proceed
without a care in the world. The adventure pro-
ceeds more satisfyingly if the player doesn’t
know for sure whether his or her character suc-
ceeded at the Search check, or the Move
Silently check, or the Hide check, for example. 
In cases where players shouldn’t know the
result of a die roll, the DM should make the roll
in secret. Consider making the following skill
checks for the players, rolling the dice in secret: 
 Bluff
 Diplomacy
 Hide
 Listen
 Move Silently
 Search
 Spot
It won’t destroy the game to let the players
make these rolls, but you keep some of the 
suspense and tension up if you make the rolls
for them.
What about DM rolls? Should you roll your dice
in the open or behind your DM screen? If you
want to use the die results as they fall without
making adjustments to help the story, make all
of your rolls in the open. If you want the option
to sometimes fudge the results to help the story
along, make your rolls in secret. See Chapter 10
for a discussion on DM fiat or DM cheating and
how to use it successfully and fairly to enhance
the game.
How do you narrate these types of situations?
Well, if you roll the dice for the player charac-
ters’ Listen checks, for example, you tell them
what they hear. Failed rolls indicate that you
should narrate the scene without revealing any
unusual sounds in the forest ahead, but suc-
cessful rolls tell you to find a way to slip hints
into your narration. Of course, a failed check
and a check when there is nothing unusual to
hear sound a lot the same when you narrate
them. Here’s what we mean:
 Failed Listen checks or checks made when
there’s nothing to hear: “You strain to hear
any unusual sounds in the forest ahead. You
hear the sounds of chirping birds, the gentle
rustle of leaves as a calm wind whistles
through the trees, and the distant rush of
water from a nearby river.”
 Successful Listen checks when there’s
something unusual to hear: “You listen
intently. Birds chirp, leaves rustle in the
wind, and the sound of rushing water from
a nearby river can be heard in the forest
around you. You also catch a few whis-
pered words that you can’t make out and
the distinct sound that armor makes when
someone wearing it is trying to be quiet.
Someone must be hiding up ahead, trying
not to be seen or heard.”

In any event, everyone should learn from their mistakes. Look at what you
did as compared to what the actual rule is. Sometimes, you might decide that
your approach is better for your game group than the official rule. Discuss it
with the players, make it a house rule, and remember to stay consistent.
Everything works out in the end.
Sharing DM Duties
Being the Dungeon Master is fun! Why should you get to have all that fun by
yourself? And why shouldn’t you get to be a player every now and then? We
don’t recommend starting off this way, but after a while, your game group
might decide to spread its wings and try a few other approaches instead of
just sticking to the tried and true method of one DM and one campaign.
One campaign, multiple DMs
As time goes along, someone else in your game group might want to try his
or her hand at DMing the game. You can continue with the campaign that you
have already established, allowing the other players to continue playing the
characters they have created and advanced, while you step into the role of
player for an adventure or two and another player takes over the DMing
duties for a while. This gives you a chance to just play a single character and
experience the fun of seeing the adventure unfold from the other side of the
table. It gives the other player a chance to be the DM, and the game can
never have too many DMs.
If you have a really energized and creative group, you might have a number of
players who would love to get a crack at being the DM. Let them each run an
adventure over the course of a few sessions, with you picking up the cam-
paign either between their adventures or after a few months of guest DMs.
This can be a one-shot experience, or if everyone wants you can establish
regular schedules for each DM to run an adventure for the group. The story
retains continuity as long as everyone uses the same campaign and player
characters, but the game group also gets to experience the variety and cre-
ativity of different styles of DMing.
Multiple campaigns, multiple DMs
A variation on the theme of multiple DMs is to let each DM run his or her own
campaign. So, in this way of sharing the DM duties, your game group not only
75
Chapter 5: Dealing with Players

experiences different DMing styles, it also plays in a variety of different cam-
paign worlds. Each player makes a new character for use in each new campaign.
This means that the group switches playing styles and characters a lot, but
that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. For example, our game group consists of
Bill, Rich, Michele, Kim, James, and Chris. Bill, Rich, and Michele all take
turns as the DM. Bill runs a D&D EBERRON game when he DMs, and the other
players all create characters that fit into that setting. Rich runs a D&D
FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign, with a more classic and high-fantasy feel than
Bill’s game. Michele runs something different, using the d20 MODERN game
rules (which are based on the D&D rules but formatted for running adven-
tures in the modern world) to create a campaign where all the players run
characters that work for a top-secret agency of super spies. With each DM in
the group running a game in a different campaign setting, the group experi-
ences a whole lot of variety, which keeps this particular game group fresh
and exciting.

Teaching the Game

 Discovering the DM’s role as game teacher

 Reviewing the key elements of the game with new players
D
epending on the makeup of your game group and the frequency with
which players join or leave the group, eventually the task will fall to you
to teach someone how to play the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. Consider this a
wonderful opportunity to help spread the word about the game you love to
play. By teaching the game, you not only create new players for your game
group (ensuring that you always have people to play D&D with), but you can
make certain that you explain the rules in a way that best compliments the
game you like to run. 
Share your hobby with others, and it will grow and prosper. As we’ve said
time and again: Play more D&D, it’s good for you! For DMs, we amend that
and say: Teach more D&D, it’s good for everyone!
In this chapter, we suggest using the key elements of D&D (which we describe
in more detail in the “Teaching Key Elements to New Players” section, later in
this chapter) as the model for how you teach the game to new players. Using
the key elements approach, you introduce new players to D&D in the follow-
ing stages:
1. Provide new players with a brief overview about what D&D is and the
campaign world you run.
2. Give new players a lesson on using the core mechanic and what their
characters can do in the game.
3. Walk them through the character sheet. This is necessary whether
you’re preparing the new person to create new characters or to start out
by using ready-to-play characters that you provide.
4. Run through the key house rules and expectations that your game group
uses, including many of the nongame aspects, such as when you play,
where, and what responsibilities the group shares.

5. Take new players through a game session. The best way to learn the
game is to see it in action in a game session. 
Make sure you keep the new player’s first game session moving at a pace
that encourages question asking and answering, and take the time to
explain game concepts to the new players as they come up.
Dungeon Master as Teacher
No matter how many Basic Game packages we create, or how many For
Dummies books we write, or how many online game demos we build, the fact
of the matter is that a game like DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is easier to learn if some-
one teaches a new player how to play. The concepts and activities are just
novel enough to make some people scratch their heads when they try to
wrap their minds around it without actually seeing the game in action. The
reality is that the game, at its core, isn’t really that hard or that complex.
Getting to that core, however, can sometimes be tricky.
When you introduce new players to the game, remember that players who
are taught by a good teacher in a fun game are more likely to have positive
experiences with D&D. Fun experiences provide them with a foundation that
can be built upon, and they’re more likely to become D&D players for life.
Consider it an honor and a privilege to be able to introduce new players to
your favorite game. Be patient with new players. Make them feel welcome
and try to make the learning as fun and as simple as possible. Don’t get frus-
trated because a new player doesn’t understand all the rules right out of the
gate. Use this opportunity to encourage the new player to become the sort of
gamer you want to play games with. Answer all questions in simple terms,
trying not to use too much jargon. You should stick to the basics of the game,
though, and let some of their answers come as you play.
For you as the DM to be a good teacher, you need to keep a few things in
mind, as we discuss in the following sections. 
Teaching the basic rules
To teach the game, you need to have a clear understanding of the basic rules
of D&D. These key elements usually figure into the first things you teach a
new player when explaining the game. We discuss these key elements in more
detail later in this chapter (in “Teaching Key Elements to New Players”). The
big thing to remember is that you shouldn’t try to teach all the rules of the
78
Part I: Running a Great Game 

game at once. That’s too much for you to do, too much for the new player to
absorb, and frankly, nobody needs to know all those rules right off the bat.
When you teach the game, we recommend giving a rundown of the basics and
then getting the new player right into the action. Seeing the rules in play and
having fun playing are the best ways to learn D&D.
Showing how to create a character
You need to understand how to create D&D characters so that you can help a
new player make a new player character. Ask the new player what kind of
character he or she wants to play. Then point the new player to the right
class and race to help him or her get going. If the new player doesn’t know or
have an idea for a character, briefly explain the race and class options and
see whether anything interests the player. 
Sometimes providing a new player with a ready-to-play character (such as
the ones in Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies) works best for the purposes of
teaching the game. After the new player gets a feel for things, he or she will
have a better sense of the kind of character he or she wants to create and
play for the long haul. 
When in doubt, have a new player create a human fighter. It’s one of the easi-
est characters to create and play, so it makes a good first choice for a new
player just starting out with the game.
You also need to give the new player a quick rundown on the character sheet,
so he or she knows how to read it. Just hit the highlights (as detailed later in
this chapter in the section “Explaining the most important parts of the char-
acter sheet”); the rest of the sheet will make sense when the player needs to
refer to it.
Relaxing and having fun playing the game
D&D is a game. It’s fun! When you teach a new player, you need to relax and
have fun so that the new player relaxes and has fun, too.
Most of the rules of D&D are situational (that is, they apply only when specific
situations come up). Just deal with the basics of the game and the characters
(see “Teaching Key Elements to New Players,” later in this chapter) before you
start the first game session. Leave the explanation of the more intricate and
detailed rules as they come up in game play, and everything will work out fine.
79
Chapter 6: Teaching the Game

Making Use of Helpful Aids
A number of aids are available to help you teach new players how to play the
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. We review these aids and how to best use them for
this purpose in the following sections.
D&D Basic Game
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Basic Game is designed specifically to serve as a
first D&D roleplaying experience. It comes with a configurable dungeon play
surface, ready-to-play characters, ready-to-play adventure scenarios, basic
rules, dice, and miniatures. You can use it to discover how to DM, to bring a
new game group up to speed, or to teach new players the game. Or, you can
use parts of it for any of those purposes.
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies
The companion volume to this book, Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies,
explains the D&D game in simple, clear language. You can refer to it for advice
on how to present the game’s concepts to new players, or to brush up on your
own understanding of the game. It makes a great recommended reading for new
players, and we suggest that you let the new players know that it can help them
get up to speed very quickly. It also contains ready-to-play characters that new
players can use, and it features an adventure that you can run, either as an
introduction to the game or just as part of your ongoing campaign.
Fantastic Locations
The Fantastic Locations series of products (including Fantastic Locations: Fane
of the Drow and Fantastic Locations: Hellspike Prison) provide wonderfully
illustrated battle maps of, well, fantastic locations that you can use to set key
encounters in if you use miniatures (such as official D&D Miniatures). They
make great gaming aids and are especially useful when showing new players
how to play D&D.
Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures
The D&D Basic Game comes with a selection of D&D Miniatures, and you can
increase your collection with DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Miniatures booster packs.
Accessories such as battle maps and miniatures are especially helpful for
new players because they give the game a more traditional look (board and
80
Part I: Running a Great Game 

pieces) and help players better visualize the situations you throw at them.
The tactical elements of the D&D game are best served with some kind of
visual representations, so you might as well use the coolest and best-looking
visual representations you can find. Plus, players love to associate their char-
acters with a special and specific miniature figure.
Teaching Key Elements to New Players
The following sections present one method for teaching the D&D game to
new players. It isn’t the only way, and after a while you’ll develop your own
method and style. But here’s some advice and examples to help you out the
first few times you get to bring new players into the fold.
Explaining the premise of D&D
Start out by giving the new player a little background. What is the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game? It’s a roleplaying game. It’s kind of like a live version of a com-
puter game, or a grown-up and sophisticated version of make-believe. It lets
players participate in exciting adventures in an imaginary world of magic and
monsters, where the only limit to what the player characters can do is the
players’ own imaginations.
D&D is different from other games in the following ways:
 The player creates and plays a character. In a D&D game, the player
plays a character that he or she creates. This character improves over
time, becoming more powerful and more famous in the imaginary world
where your adventures take place. A character is defined by race
(human, dwarf, or elf, for example), class (fighter, cleric, or wizard, for
example), game statistics, and the personality the player develops for
the character as he or she plays the game.
 Play continues. When the player creates a character for a D&D game, he
or she plays that character from one game session to the next. The adven-
tures are kind of like an ongoing television series, and the player charac-
ters are the stars. With each adventure the player participates in, his or
her character grows and develops, becomes more powerful, and generally
takes on greater and greater challenges as the campaign unfolds.
 Nothing limits the action. Unlike board games or computer games, there
are no limits to what a player character can do in a D&D game. Not only
can the character attempt to do anything imaginable within the confines
of the character’s powers and abilities, the game also offers endless
adventure possibilities and a multitude of choices for developing a char-
acter over time.
81
Chapter 6: Teaching the Game

 Everyone wins. The D&D game is a cooperative game. The players
work together to overcome the challenges the Dungeon Master pre-
sents. The DM presents adventures and narrates the action. In this way,
players and DM play the game and tell a group story. If the characters
survive and overcome the challenges (or die spectacularly and memo-
rably while trying) and everyone has a fun and exciting time, then every-
one wins.
Describing the world of D&D
No matter what setting you play in, the world of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game consists of a number of constant factors that remain true across every
campaign. Some of these are defined by the background story of the game,
and some by the rules of the game. These constant factors include:
 A medieval world: A D&D world is modeled after a fantastic version of
the medieval period of European history. It’s an imaginary, magical ver-
sion that comes out of story books and legends more than out of any
actual history text. The technology of the world matches what you prob-
ably think of when you think of the world of King Arthur or Robin Hood
or fairy tales. People travel on foot or on horseback, gunpowder doesn’t
exist, and most battles occur using melee weapons such as clubs and
maces and swords. The world contains castles and dark forests and
knights and monsters, among other things.
 A magical world: Everything of fantasy exists in a D&D world, from fan-
tastical creatures to magic spells to powerful arcane items. A forest
might be an enchanted forest or a cursed forest. Good wizards and evil
sorcerers abound. And player characters might find all kinds of magic
items and artifacts — often as a result of a long and harrowing adventure
or quest of some sort.
 A world of monsters: In addition to all kinds of magic, a D&D world is
inhabited by monsters of every description and disposition. Monster is
kind of a generic term, because monsters can be good or evil, helpful or
harmful, depending on the situation and the adventure. From great drag-
ons to small goblins, monsters come in all shapes and sizes.
Showing how to use the core mechanic
The core mechanic of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is that you roll a d20 and
hope to roll high. Everything else is just details.
82
Part I: Running a Great Game 

You resolve any action in the game that has a possibility of failure associated
with it (and a subsequent meaningful consequence) by using the core
mechanic. These actions include making an attack, using a skill, or using an
ability. To determine whether an action succeeds, follow these steps:
1. Roll a d20.
2. Add any relevant modifiers. You can explain to a new player that a modi-
fier is a bonus or penalty that is added to the d20 die roll. Modifiers
come from a variety of game statistics, such as ability scores and skills.
3. Compare the result to a target number.
The DM sets the target number either by using numbers that are predetermined
(such as in an adventure or a monster’s Armor Class) or by determining a target
number using the rulebooks and the relative difficulty of the task as a guide. If
the result is equal to or greater than the target number, the action succeeds. If
the resulting number is less than the target number, the action fails.
Explaining what a character can do
The D&D game is played fairly loose until a tactical situation (such as a combat
encounter or some challenge encounters) comes up. Then everyone plays the
game in rounds. In a round, a character can try to do anything the player can
imagine, but it usually boils down to something within the following parame-
ters. On a player’s turn in combat, the character can do any one of the follow-
ing actions:
 Move and attack
 Attack and move
 Just move
 Just attack
 Do something else (cast a spell, use a potion, draw a weapon, take cover,
or anything else you can imagine)
Explaining the most important 
parts of the character sheet
You need to walk a new player through the parts of the character sheet that
come into play most often during the game. The sheet has a lot of stuff on it.
83
Chapter 6: Teaching the Game

Tell the player that the following bits are the most important parts and that
you’ll explain everything else when it comes up in the game:
 Character class and level: This gives an idea about what role the char-
acter plays in the group, and how relatively powerful the character is. 
 HP: This lists the character’s hit points. When a monster or other opponent
successfully attacks the character, the player subtracts the amount of
damage from the character’s current hit point total. When the character’s
hit points are reduced to 0 or less, he or she is defeated and out of the
fight.
You can save the big discussion on the specifics of character death and
dying for later in the game.
 AC: The character’s Armor Class. This class represents how tough it is to
hit the character in combat and serves as the target number that oppo-
nents need to achieve to damage the character with an attack.
 Speed: This is the distance the character can move when performing a
move-and-attack action. If the character just moves, he or she can move
up to twice the listed number in the round.
 Initiative: To decide who goes first in a combat round, each player
makes an Initiative check. The player rolls a d20 and adds his or her
character’s initiative modifier. That determines when the character can
act in the round.
 Attack: This area of the character sheet lists the character’s weapons
and attack modifiers. Whenever the player makes an attack roll, he or
she rolls a d20 and adds the attack bonus. If the result equals or exceeds
the target’s AC, the attack hits. If the attack roll succeeds, the player
rolls damage, which is also listed in this section on the character sheet.
For example, Regdar the fighter (one of the sample characters we pro-
vide in Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies) attacks with a greatsword 
(+4 bonus) that deals 2d6+3 damage when it hits.
 Everything else: Show the player where to look on the sheet when those
sections become pertinent during the game.

The Rat Lord’s Lair
In This Chapter
 Preparing for the sample adventure 
 Running the sample dungeon
W
e’re taking all the advice we provide earlier in the book and using it to
show you how to run your very first DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure. In
addition to all the components that regularly go into a D&D adventure, for
this one we provide plenty of advice and behind-the-scenes information to
make your first experience as Dungeon Master run as smoothly as possible.
This is the good stuff — go ahead and dig in!
Dungeon Master Preparation
Whenever you prepare to run an adventure for a D&D game session, you
should consider the items discussed in the following sections. You might come
to develop other preparation habits as you become more comfortable in your
role as Dungeon Master and as you become more comfortable with the game,
but the following sections provide a solid approach to DM preparation.
Knowing the players
As we discuss in Chapters 5 and 9, you need to have a sense of the kind of
game the players want to play in. This includes getting a sense of the kind of
characters they like to play, the way they approach the game, the kind of
adventures they prefer, and the style of play they try to emulate. 

Now, for your first adventure, you don’t need to know the players’ wants and
needs for the game inside and out. In fact, you might not have much of an
idea about their views on that at all when you start out. When you do figure
that all out (through candid conversations, observation of play patterns, or
both), it gives you a powerful tool for adventure planning and preparation.
For your first session, you basically just need to know how many players are
coming to the game. The adventure presented in this chapter is designed to
challenge a group of four 1st-level player characters. If you have fewer than four
players, you will want to allow some players to control more than one player
character (PC) so that you have a full party of four for the adventure. If you
have more than four players, refer to the sections in the adventure that show
you how to scale the encounters to match the number of player characters in
the group. You probably don’t want to try to run a game with more than six
players, though. More players mean more complexity, more things for you to
keep track of, and less time for each player to have a moment in the spotlight.
Knowing your adventure
Never approach your game session cold. That’s just trouble waiting to
happen. It all comes back to being prepared. Whether you’re preparing to run
the adventure presented in this chapter, a published adventure, or one
you’ve created, make sure you’ve prepared before the game session starts by
following these steps:
1. Read through the adventure so you have a sense of the story and the
pacing, as well as an understanding of the main villain and the encoun-
ters that the player characters will have to deal with. For your first ses-
sion, preparation is easy — just review this chapter.
2. Review any game rules that you feel you need to brush up on before
play, and look up any special rules mentioned in the adventure. If you
think you might need to look up those rules during the game, bookmark
those pages in the rulebook(s). That way, you won’t need to delay the
action for too long when those parts of the adventure come up. 
86
Part I: Running a Great Game 
It’s just a game
Remember to relax and have fun. We can’t
stress this enough — DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is a
game. It’s a fun game. You might not get every-
thing right, but you can’t get it wrong, either. 
Play to the best of your ability and the players’
abilities, and don’t worry if you don’t get all the
game rules quite right the first time out. You have
our permission to make mistakes. (As if you
even need it!) So what are you waiting for? Get
your game group together and start having fun!

3. Gather any other materials you’ll need for the adventure, including your
battle grid, miniatures (or other markers to represent the monsters),
and dice. If you use a dry- or wet-erase battle grid, you might want to
sketch out the first encounter area or two so that you can get right to
the action when you start the game session.
The Rat Lord’s Lair
This adventure is designed to kick off your DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. It
serves as an introduction to the game, as well as to the D&D world. It
assumes that you’re running a party of four 1st-level player characters. If you
have more than four PCs or if the PCs are of a slightly higher level, see the
“Making the Adventure Tougher” section at the end of this chapter for advice
on adjustments you can make to compensate.
Throughout the adventure, material is divided into two distinct sections:
material specifically for the Dungeon Master and material to share with the
players. In general, DM material is behind-the-scenes advice and information
that should be kept secret from the players until their characters do some-
thing to discover it. This could be opening a door, solving a puzzle, or other-
wise doing something that brings the secret into the open. The adventure
text will guide you through these secrets as you go along.
87
Chapter 7: Sample Dungeon: The Rat Lord’s Lair

Adventure premise
This section discusses the story-behind-the-story, the background of the
adventure. This material is for the DM only. Don’t share this information with
the players. Their characters will learn about the story background as they
play the game.
The adventure takes place in the tiny village of Castle Hill, a settlement with
more wealth and activity than would otherwise be the case thanks to the
presence of the busy trade road that passes through it. The inn, The Weary
Wanderer, provides lodging, food, and entertainment for the merchants,
traders, and other travelers that use the road to get to larger towns and cities
to the north and south. The innkeeper, Malto Krass, makes a lucrative profit
off a service he provides on the side: Krass uses a secure room in the inn’s
basement as a vault-for-rent. Traders carrying especially valuable goods or
merchants looking to store items until a caravan arrives often take advantage
of Krass’s protected storage facility.
Unfortunately, the secure basement room isn’t as safe as Innkeeper Krass
once believed. The trade lord Silos Vant placed a small metal box in Krass’s
care. “I must complete some business up north in Griffonford,” Vant
explained, “and I don’t want to carry this precious item with me. I shall leave
it with you, innkeeper, safe in your secure room until I return. I should be back
in about six days.” So, Krass locked the small metal box in the basement room.
When he went down to the basement room the next day to place another item
into storage for a visiting metalworker, he unlocked the heavy door and entered
the secure space. To the innkeeper’s horror, the small metal box was gone! Not
only that, but other items that he had locked away were missing as well. How
had someone managed to get past the locked door? Malto Krass was baffled and
extremely worried about his business and his reputation.
The adventure begins when Innkeeper Malto Krass approaches the player
characters and asks them to undertake the mission to discover how the
items were stolen, find the thief, and return the missing items before the
whole village finds out what has happened.
DM Secret: Here’s what’s happening in the village of Castle Hill. A thief by the
name of Shadowfang has set up shop in the secret tunnels beneath the hill
upon which the village was constructed. Not just a simple thief, Shadowfang
is a wererat who fancies himself to be the Lord of Rats. Using his ability to
change into a rat and his affinity with the rats of the village, Shadowfang
found a small crack in the basement room’s floor. Moving from his tunnels up
to the basement room when he was in rat form was easy, and he stole the
small metal box and a few other items that were small enough to fit through
the crack in the floor.
88
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Starting the adventure
You’ve gotten all the pre-game socialization out of the way, and now it’s time
to get to the main event — this game session’s adventure. Start with the pro-
logue: Have each player introduce his or her character by saying the charac-
ter’s name, race, and class, and giving a brief description of what the other
characters see when they look at the character. Then, you should read this
section out loud to the players:
Read Aloud: You and your companions have been traveling along the trade
road in search of adventure when you reach the small village of Castle Hill.
The Weary Wanderer Inn looks comfortable and inviting, so you decide to stop
for the night. The main room of the inn isn’t too crowded this evening, and as
you order drinks and food from the serving girl, you can’t help but notice the
innkeeper staring at you from his place behind the bar. He seems to hesitate
for a second, but then he grabs a pitcher and walks toward your table.
DM Notes: This first encounter is a roleplaying encounter. There is no map of
the inn’s common room or of the village because all the action takes place in
the basement room and the secret tunnels beneath the village. The whole
purpose of this encounter is to introduce the player characters and set the
scene for the rest of the adventure to follow.
After letting the players introduce their characters and after you’ve read the
preceding Read Aloud text, ask the players what they want their characters
to do. Give them each a moment to decide on a course of action. Some play-
ers might decide that their characters will take a good look at the innkeeper.
Others might watch the room for any strange activity. Still others might get
on their guard and prepare for the worst. Let the player characters each
make a single preparation, and then read the following out loud as the
innkeeper reaches their table.
Read Aloud: The innkeeper gives you a nervous smile. “May I join you?” he
asks, setting a large pitcher of ale on the table.
The innkeeper appears as a rotund, balding man of about 50 years. He wears
an apron over clean and well-kept clothes. He carries no weapons or armor.
Any player who asks to examine the innkeeper should make a Spot check. If
the result is 10 or better, that character notices that the innkeeper seems ner-
vous, perhaps even a bit fearful.
Read Aloud: “My name is Malto Krass, and this is my place,” the innkeeper
says. “Am I right to assume that you are adventurers? If so, I’d like to hire you to
solve a problem for me.”
89
Chapter 7: Sample Dungeon: The Rat Lord’s Lair

Let the players answer for their characters. Encourage them, as you’re play-
ing the part of the innkeeper, to hear him out. The innkeeper will make it
worth their while to help him and the entire village of Castle Hill. Any player
character that makes a Sense Motive check of 10 or better realizes that the
innkeeper is sincere in his appeal for help and truly means to reward anyone
who provides that help. When the player characters ask what the problem is,
read the following out loud.
Read Aloud: The innkeeper says, “I have a secure room in the basement where
I store items for a price. The room is always locked, but this morning I discov-
ered that some very precious items were no longer inside the room. I have no
idea how the thefts were accomplished, for the door was as secure as always. I
need someone such as yourselves to investigate this matter — quietly — and
retrieve the missing items before my reputation and the reputation of the whole
village is ruined. Will you help me?”
The innkeeper wants the whole business to be dealt with as quickly and as
quietly as possible. He offers the player characters free room and board for
the duration of the crisis, as well as 125 gold pieces each to investigate the
mysterious robbery. If they actually catch the culprit responsible and return
the missing items, he promises to double the reward (to 250 gold pieces each).
If the player characters want to ask questions, here are some possible
answers that the innkeeper is willing to provide:
 What items were taken? A small metal box is missing; it bears the seal
of Silos Vant and is about six inches long, three inches wide, and three
inches deep. Also missing are a jeweled dagger with a ruby hilt, a gold
pendant, and a silver ring encrusted with sapphires.
 Who else has access to the room? No one. The innkeeper has the only
set of keys, and the key ring never leaves his side.
 When did the thefts take place? A small metal box was placed in the
room yesterday. The innkeeper noticed that it and the other items were
missing earlier today. The other missing items were placed within the
room over a series of days, starting about a week ago.
When the player characters and the innkeeper reach an agreement, he takes
them to the basement room.
Encounter Area 1: The Basement Room
This encounter area appears on the map shown in Figure 7-1. It is labeled as “1”
on the map. 
90
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Encounter Level (EL) 1: The player characters explore the basement room
and discover a mystery that leads them deeper into the adventure.
The innkeeper leads the player characters downstairs to a pair of solid
wooden doors. He hands a lantern to one of the player characters.
Read Aloud: The double doors at the bottom of the stairs appear solid and
strong. Three heavy padlocks, spaced evenly along the seam where the doors
meet, are securely sealed. What do you want to do?
Here are a few of the most obvious actions the player characters might make.
Use the notes to help narrate the action. If a player wants his or her charac-
ter to try something different, go for it! Listen to what the character wants to
do, and then decide how best to adjudicate the action.

Chapter 7: Sample Dungeon: The Rat Lord’s Lair

Examine the Doors and Locks: Any characters that want to examine the
double doors or the locks should make a Search check.
Failed Search Check (result is less than 15): The doors and locks appear solid
and secure. Nothing out of the ordinary suggests itself.
Successful Search Check (result is 15 or better): The doors and locks appear
solid and secure. They have not been tampered with in any way. A character
with this result does notice one odd thing about the doors. At the bottom of
the right door, the wood has been gnawed away by some kind of animal,
probably a rat, leaving a small hole about the size of a human fist at the base
of the door. If the Search result is 20 or better, a character can tell that the
hole is relatively new.
Ask the Innkeeper to Open the Doors: Innkeeper Krass says “Of course,” and
produces a ring of keys from one of his many pockets. A different key unlocks
each padlock. When he finishes, he steps back so that the player characters
can open the doors. When the characters open the doors, skip ahead to the
“Inside the Basement Room” description.
Try to Break Open the Doors: If the player characters want to bust open the
doors, Innkeeper Krass objects strongly. (“See hear,” the innkeeper says, “why
would you want to smash my doors when I can simply unlock them for you?”) If
the PCs insist on destruction, the innkeeper throws up his hands and heads
upstairs, mumbling about crazy adventurers and how he will deduct the cost
of repairing the door out of their reward. (Reduce the reward by 25 gold
pieces each if the player characters break open the doors.)
To break open the doors, one player character acts as the primary door
breaker. That character makes a Strength check (roll a d20 and add the PC’s
Strength modifier) and seeks to get a result of 18 or better. Up to two other
characters can help the primary breaker. This is called aiding the character.
The aiding characters also make Strength checks, but they need a result of
only 10 or better. If an aiding character succeeds, the character provides a +2
bonus to the primary door breaker’s check. If both aiding characters suc-
ceed, the primary door breaker gets a +4 bonus. 
If the Strength check fails, the characters bounce off the solid door. They can
try again if they want, but they do notice that the attempt made a lot of noise,
which the innkeeper didn’t want. 
If the Strength check succeeds, the locks pull away from the wood and the
double doors swing open. When the characters open the doors, go to the
“Inside the Basement Room” description.
92
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Try to Open the Locks: If for some reason the rogue in the party wants to
test the mettle of the locks that secure the basement room doors, Innkeeper
Krass looks uncomfortable but says, “Well, if that will tell you something about
the robberies, I guess it’s okay.” There are two Good locks (Open Lock DC 30)
and one Average lock (Open Lock DC 25). It takes a full round action to try to
open each lock. This is a tough challenge for a 1st-level rogue, so the charac-
ter shouldn’t be surprised if he or she can’t open all the locks. Indeed, such a
test should show the player characters that the thief probably didn’t get
through these doors in any normal manner.
Inside the Basement Room: The large basement room is full of crates and
barrels and other supplies for the inn. Shelves along two of the walls hold
more precious items, including things given over to Innkeeper Krass for safe-
keeping. When the player characters enter the basement room, read the fol-
lowing description out loud:
Read Aloud: The large basement room reeks of stale air and dust. The lantern
provided by the innkeeper casts shadows in each direction, revealing crates,
barrels, and sacks stocked in the center of the space, and shelves line some of
the walls. Sitting on a barrel, smiling at you as the lantern light washes over
him, is a short, wiry human male with a thin mustache and oily brown hair, a
loaded light crossbow across his knees. “You’ve caught me red-handed, it would
seem,” the man says in a high, whiny voice. “But holding the Lord of Rats is an
entirely different matter! Attack, my children!” Before you can react, you see
three enormous rats emerge from the shadows behind the man to charge toward
you. Everyone roll an Initiative check.

Have each player make an Initiative check for his or her character. You make
one Initiative check for the Lord of Rats and one for the dire rats. Jot down
the order of play for this encounter (high initiative result to low initiative
result) and let each player tell you what his or her character is doing when
you come to that point in the initiative order. 
For the Lord of Rats, his only goal in this encounter is to see who has come to
the basement, take their measure, taunt them a little, and escape. Use the
wererat (human form) statistics for him in this encounter. The dire rats, on
the other hand, want to protect their master by killing the player characters.
That’s the situation. Time to see how it plays out.
Look at the Map: Area 1 on the map shown in Figure 7-1 is the basement
room. When you describe or sketch the map for the players, don’t reveal any
of the secrets. So, describe the shelves, the tools, the barrels, the crates, and
the strange human claiming to be the Lord of Rats, but don’t reveal anything
about the hole in the floor until the player characters move close enough to
see it.
Here are the key features of Encounter Area 1 on the map:

beyond these doors lead up to the inn.

Shovels, Picks, Hammers, and Rope: To the right of the double doors, beside
some barrels, Innkeeper Krass stores some tools, including a couple shovels,
two picks, three small hammers, and a coil of rope. None of these make good
weapons, but they can be used to widen the hole in the floor (marked “C” on
the map in Figure 7-1, earlier in this chapter).
Crates and Barrels: These are scattered throughout the room and marked on
the map. Although none of the crates or barrels are large enough to block
movement, they do slow movement. If a character or monster moves through
a square containing crates or barrels, movement through that square costs
double (count as 2 squares for movement instead of 1).
If the player characters decide to check, the crates contain various staples
and trade goods that have little value for adventurers. The barrels contain
ale, wine, water, or staples, and the crates contain trade goods. 
The crate-filled square marked “A” on the map is where the Lord of Rats, in
human form, starts this encounter.
Shelves: Floor-to-ceiling shelves line two walls of this large room. If the player
characters spend time searching the shelves (a full-round Search check for
every 10 feet of shelf), they have a chance to find something of value. If a
character makes a Search check of 20 or better, roll a d% (two ten-sided dice
used to roll between 01 and 100) and look up the result in Table 7-1 to see
what is discovered. Of course, taking any of these items is stealing, but
because the innkeeper doesn’t know what is or isn’t missing, you can leave
the morality of it to the player characters.

Dire Rats: These vile creatures start the encounter on the squares marked
with “B” on the map.
Hole in the Ground: The hole that the wererat has been using to move between
the basement room and the secret tunnels under the village is marked “C” on
the map. The hole is hidden behind crates. It is 5 feet long but only 11⁄2 feet
wide, which is barely enough room for a dire rat to squeeze through.
On the Dire Rats’ Turn: When you reach the initiative order for the dire rats,
here are the basic tactics that these creatures use. Two rats rush to attack
the closest player character, teaming up to try to defeat the character as
quickly as possible. The third rushes to attack a spellcasting character (a
wizard or sorcerer as first choice, a cleric as second choice) that isn’t the
same character the other two dire rats attack. The dire rats fight opponents
to the death.
On the Lord of Rats’ Turn: When you reach the initiative order for
Shadowfang, the Lord of Rats, he hops over the barrels and races to get over
to the hole in the floor (“C”). It takes Shadowfang two move actions (a full
round) to get over the crates and into the square beside the hole. The second
time Shadowfang’s initiative comes up, he uses a standard action to trans-
form into dire rat form and a move action to leap down into the hole. He does
this in secret, hiding behind the crates near the hole, if at all possible.
Shadowfang has one goal in this encounter — to turn into a dire rat and
escape down the hole and into the secret tunnels that run under the village.
96
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Troubleshooting: If the PCs get lucky and stop Shadowfang’s escape or kill
him, the DM needs to do a little work to keep the adventure going. In this
case, two wererats are at work — Shadowfang and his mate, Silentclaw.
If Shadowfang is defeated, she continues to run the crime operations from
the lair below (Encounter Area 3).
After the Battle: After the player characters have defeated the dire rats
(which they should be able to do), they can search the basement room. The
hole in the floor is easy to spot when the player characters move past the
crates and barrels that hide it. A quick search of the area behind the crates
shows the player characters that the only possible exit from the basement
room is through the hole in the floor. It is also evident that the human they
saw could not have fit through the hole — at least not as he was when he was
sitting on the crates.
The player characters can use the shovels, picks, and hammers lying near the
double doors to widen the hole in the floor. No rolls or checks are necessary;
it just takes a little bit of muscle and time to make a space wide enough for the
player characters to squeeze through. The coil of rope found near the double
doors is 25 feet long, more than enough to reach to the tunnel floor below.
Experience Points Award: Give the party 300 XP for defeating the dire rats.
Add another 100 XP for the group to split for figuring out how to widen the
hole in the floor so they can follow the Lord of Rats to his lair. In a party of
four, each character receives 100 XP for this encounter.
Next: When the player characters have widened the hole and are ready to
enter the tunnels, go on to the following section.

This encounter area appears on the map shown in Figure 7-1. It is labeled as “2”
on the map.
Encounter Level (EL) 2: The player characters enter the secret tunnels below
the basement room in search of the missing items and the strange man who
called himself the Lord of Rats.
The player character drop down from the hole in the basement room floor to
the square marked “D” on the map. When the player characters gather in the
area around “D,” read the following description out loud:
Read Aloud: The tunnels feel cool and ancient, and all of the sounds and smells
of the inn fade away far above you. A few unidentifiable sounds echo from the
darkness ahead of you, as well as the constant drip of water that obscures the
other sounds.
A short corridor leads to a large, natural cavern that surrounds a deep, dark
pool. Water drips from stalactites above, constantly raining large drops onto
the otherwise still surface of the pool. This cavern is the home to a gang of
kobold miners, led by a tough kobold named Nep. The kobold leader has
made a deal with Shadowfang, agreeing to let the wererat move through the
cavern unmolested for a share of whatever loot is acquired. Shadowfang just
gave the kobold leader an extra share to keep the player characters from chas-
ing him. To this end, Nep and his gang have set an ambush for the player char-
acters. If the player characters try to hear more, have them make Listen checks.
Failed Listen Check (result is less than 15): The player characters hear only
what is described in the read aloud section about the tunnels.

Successful Listen Check (result is 15 or better): A player character that makes a
successful Listen check hears the whispers of the two kobolds on the right
side of the cavern. No words are discernable, but the character can tell that
someone is talking but trying not to be heard.
The Ambush: Here’s what’s going on in the large cavern (area 2 on the map).
Four kobold warriors (shown as “E” on the map) are set up in pairs to each side
of the entry corridor. The kobold leader, Nep, starts out in the square labeled
“F” on the map. The pool of water in the center of the cavern is cold and deep.
Characters must make Swim checks (DC 15) if they want to cross through each
square of the pool. The corridor marked “G” leads to a dead end where the
kobolds were mining. The corridor marked “H” leads deeper into the tunnels
beneath the village and can be used as an entry point to future adventures of
your own creation. The corridor marked “I” leads to the lair of the Rat Lord.
The kobolds attack in pairs, first with ranged weapons and then closing to
melee and trying their best to set up flanks against the player characters. Nep
moves to keep the pool between himself and the player characters, using
ranged attacks for as long as possible before engaging in melee combat himself.
First Round of the Ambush: The first round of action in the cavern is a surprise
round. That means that only the kobolds and any player characters that
made successful Listen checks get to act in the round.
During the surprise round, the kobolds and the kobold leader, as well as the
PCs that made successful Listen checks, act in initiative order. They can each
make a single move or standard action. Roll an Initiative check for the kobold
warriors and one for the kobold leader. (Have all of the players make Initiative
checks for their characters, even though only the ones that succeeded at the
Listen checks get to act in the surprise round. In subsequent rounds, every-
one — monsters and PCs — act in their initiative order.)
The kobold warriors each make a ranged attack with their slings, targeting
the nearest player character. Nep makes a ranged attack with his light cross-
bow, aiming for any obvious spellcaster in the group. He also yells, “Die, die,
die, invaders! You won’t get past us! The Lord of Rats is safe in his lair to the
south!” in his yapping voice. (He’s smarter than his gang, but not by much.)
Subsequent Rounds of Combat: The kobold warriors try to stay out of melee
combat for as long as possible, moving and attacking with their slings each
round. Nep moves around the edge of the pool each round, trying to stay out
of melee range and making crossbow attacks when he can. Note that he
needs to use a move action to reload the light crossbow after every attack.
The kobold warriors fight until only one of them is still standing or until Nep
falls, and then the remaining kobold(s) surrenders. If the warriors all go
down, Nep apologizes for the misunderstanding and tries to make a deal. 
See the “After the Battle” description.

Chapter 7: Sample Dungeon: The Rat Lord’s Lair

After the Battle: After the kobolds have been defeated or surrender, the
player characters can move deeper into the tunnels. 
If a kobold warrior surrendered, the player characters can easily intimidate it
into telling them details. It explains that the Lord of Rats has been good to
the kobolds. He lives in a chamber to the south. He has given some treasure
to Nep, the kobold leader, but none of the kobold warriors have ever actually
seen Nep’s treasure.
If Nep surrenders, he offers the same information as the kobold warrior(s). In
addition, he offers to return the treasure that the Lord of Rats gave him if the
player characters agree to let him leave (he plans to flee into tunnel “H” at
the first opportunity). If the PCs agree, Nep retrieves the following items from
a hiding place behind a loose rock in the cavern wall: the gold pendant and
the silver ring encrusted with sapphires. If the PCs don’t agree, Nep resumes
fighting and battles to the death. Without the cooperation of Nep, it requires
an hour of searching (time they don’t have if they want to catch up with the
Lord of Rats) and a successful Search check (DC 20) to find the hidden items.
Experience Points Award: Give the party 600 XP for defeating or driving
away the kobold warriors and the kobold leader. If they also recover the two
missing items, increase the award by 100 XP.

ters to discover the secret door that leads to the Rat Lord’s lair. When the

The tunnel isn’t actually a dead end. There’s a secret door waiting to be dis-
covered. When the player characters decide to search the area at the end of
the tunnel, have them make Search checks (DC 20). When someone makes a
successful Search check, read the following out loud:
Read Aloud: You search the wall and you find an indentation in the rough
stone. Pressing it causes the middle of the wall to swing inward, revealing a
chamber beyond.
The Rat Lord’s lair is a large chamber lit by torches on wall sconces. Two pil-
lars of stone hold up the ceiling and divide the chamber, and an alcove to the
east contains a ladder (marked “L” on the map) that leads up into the village.
When the player characters enter, Shadowfang starts out hidden in the shad-
ows behind one of the pillars (in the square containing the “J”). Shadowfang’s
strongest guards, a pair of fiendish dire rats, wait in the shadows in the
squares containing “K”. When the player characters examine the chamber or
step into it, read the following out loud:
Read Aloud: The floor of the chamber seems to be covered in a thick carpet of
gray fur, but then the carpet moves! Rats cover every inch of the chamber floor,
moving back and forth with apparent purpose. From somewhere deeper in the
chamber, you hear the high, whiny voice of the Rat Lord call out, “You invade
my domain like thieves and murderers in the night? For this insult, you will die!”
And the rats throughout the chamber screech in unison.
The rat-covered floor makes moving through the chamber difficult. It costs
double for every square of movement that the player characters make while
in the chamber. (So if a character could normally move 6 squares in a round,
he or she can move only 3 squares in this chamber.) In addition, making a
melee attack while standing on rats can be problematic; player characters
that make a melee attack while in the chamber must make a successful
Balance check (DC 5) or slip and fall prone. Standing up requires a move
action and provokes an attack of opportunity. The fiendish dire rats and
Shadowfang don’t have any trouble moving through the chamber normally.
The normal rats don’t attack in any meaningful way.
Fiendish Dire Rat Tactics: The fiendish dire rats move from the shadows 
and through the sea of normal rats in near-silent perfection. Allow the player
characters to make Spot checks to oppose the Move Silently checks you
make for the monsters. If a player character beats the dire rat’s Move Silently
check, he or she notices it sneaking around and combat occurs in normal ini-
tiative order. If the fiendish dire rat’s Move Silently check is higher, it makes
a surprise attack against a player character. The dire rats dart in and out of
the sea of normal rats, attacking the player characters with fiendish delight.
They fight to the death at the wererat’s behest.
102
Part I: Running a Great Game 

Wererat Tactics: Shadowfang the wererat remains in hiding until the fiendish
dire rats engage the player characters. Then he fires his crossbow from the
shadows and begins to move toward the ladder (“L” on the map). He hopes
to kill a player character or two and escape, but will fight to the death if cor-
nered. He switches to his rapier and bite attack when he has to engage in
melee combat.
When the player characters catch a glimpse of the wererat’s hybrid form,
read the following out loud.
Read Aloud: You see an enormous rat-man, standing on two legs and wielding 
a light crossbow, emerge from the shadows to attack you. “I am Shadowfang,”
the rat-man screeches, “I am the Lord of Rats. Attack them, my children! Destroy
the intruders!” And the rats chatter and screech in response to their master’s
command.
After the Battle: After the player characters have defeated Shadowfang and
his fiendish dire rats, the remaining normal rats scurry out of the chamber
through small cracks in the walls. Shadowfang reverts to human form, and
the two remaining items (the small metal box and the jeweled dagger with the
ruby hilt) can be found in the pouch slung over his shoulder. Upon returning
the items to Innkeeper Krass, the player characters will receive their reward.
If Shadowfang and his fiendish dire rats defeat the player characters, the
adventure ends. Hopefully, the defeat was dramatic and intense and resulted
in a fun and exciting story. You can have the players create new characters to
mount another attack on the evil Rat Lord while you add new details to make
the adventure different from the first run-in with Shadowfang.
If Shadowfang reaches the ladder and escapes, the player characters don’t
retrieve the items they were sent to recover. They can go after Shadowfang in
a new adventure of your own creation, or the wererat can return to trouble
them later as a recurring villain.
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat Shadowfang and
the fiendish dire rats, give the party 900 XP. If they return the stolen items to
Innkeeper Krass, don’t forget to give them the monetary reward he promised
them.
Next: What comes next is up to you! We present another adventure in
Chapter 20.
103
Chapter 7: Sample Dungeon: The Rat Lord’s Lair

Making the Adventure Tougher
The Rat Lord’s Lair should be reasonably challenging for a party of four 1st-
level or 2nd-level characters. Some encounters will be easy, and others
should be a little harder. However, if you have more than five player charac-
ters in the party or if the average level of the party is 3rd level or higher, you
might want to increase the difficulty of the adventure by making the fights
tougher. Here are a few suggestions:
 The Basement Room: Add three more dire rats (increasing the EL to 2)
or change the three dire rats into four fiendish dire rats (EL 2).
 The Unfriendly Gang: Add four more kobolds (EL 3), or add a second
kobold leader (EL 3), or change the kobolds to orcs (EL 3).
 Lair of the Rat Lord: Add two more fiendish dire rats (EL 4), or change
the mastermind behind the robberies from a wererat to a werewolf
(EL 4), or both (EL 5). (If you go with the werewolf, keep the wererat
around as a minion and as the actual thief, because he can change into
a form small enough to pass through the crack in the basement floor.)

W
hether you’ve just run your first successful D&D game or you’ve been
DMing for awhile, it’s time to start thinking about doing this DMing
thing on a regular basis. Just as millions of people enjoy a regular Friday
night poker game, bowling league, or movie night, most D&D players partici-
pate in an ongoing D&D game. Maintaining a game group that meets on a reg-
ular basis (once a week, once every two weeks, once a month, or whatever
works for you) is the next natural step for a Dungeon Master.
Setting up a regularly recurring game has a lot of advantages:
 The game has a chance to grow. Most importantly, a recurring game
gives you the opportunity to evolve the D&D game into a more reward-
ing experience than you can achieve with a single game session. You can
tackle extended adventures that require multiple game sessions to finish
and add broad storylines to the game, and the players can keep their
characters and grow them over time by gaining experience points,
acquiring magic items, and building their characters’ personalities and
back-stories.
 You’ve got players right where you want ’em. You don’t have to go
searching for players every time you want to play D&D — you can stick
with the players you’ve already got. 
 Everyone knows the niceties. You can easily establish some basic game
etiquette and table manners for the game because the players are all reg-
ulars and they know how things are supposed to go. 

Choosing the Right Format
There are a lot of different approaches to running a regular D&D game.
Although most experienced D&D players will tell you that the “best” game is
a long-running campaign where they’ve kept the same characters for years
and the DM hand-builds a meticulously detailed world to explore, the truth is
that sort of complicated commitment isn’t the right game for everybody. You
might expect to play with the same group only for a couple months (over a
summer break, for example), so what would be the point of trying to build a
game world that would take years to explore? Sometimes the best game is
one you run only for a session or two or three.
When you’re deciding how to build an ongoing D&D game, ask yourself these
questions: Do you want the characters to continue from session to session?
Do you want the adventure to continue from session to session? Do you want
the game to continue from adventure to adventure? Take a look at Table 8-1.
The answers to these questions can help you settle on a good model or
format for your game: the standalone session, the dungeon-of-the-week, the
one-shot campaign, or the continuing campaign.

The standalone session
At the most basic level, an ongoing D&D game consists of bringing back the
same players for a game on some sort of regular basis. Nothing else must con-
tinue from session to session — and with the standalone session, each time
the group plays, it’s a new adventure featuring new characters.
108
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

The standalone session has some important advantages:
 It’s simple. Because nothing continues to the next session, you have no
record-keeping to speak of. 
 It gives you the opportunity to try very different styles or scenarios
each time you play. One week the players can be barbarians and out-
casts hunting monsters in the arctic wastes, and the next week they can
be urbane swashbucklers and nobles solving a murder mystery in a
great medieval city. You can explore a tremendous variety of D&D adven-
tures this way.
 It’s a great format for giving players the chance to try their hands at
being the Dungeon Master. It’s only one game session, after all.
The standalone session has three disadvantages. You have to make up or find
new adventure material each time you play. You can’t try out very long or
involved adventures unless you have a lot of time available for the game ses-
sion. The players don’t have an opportunity to become familiar with their
characters or develop them over time.
Making up a new character takes time, and you want to maximize the playing
time you get out of every game session. It’s a good idea to tell the players a
day or two ahead of time what kind of characters they’ll need to bring for the
next game, and ask them to show up ready to play. At a minimum, the players
need to know what level to give to their characters.
Run your D&D game as a series of standalone sessions if . . .
 Your D&D game sessions are infrequent or hard to schedule.
 The players don’t invest in their characters and like making up new
characters more than continuing to play old ones.
 The membership of your game group changes frequently.
The dungeon-of-the-week adventure
The dungeon-of-the-week adventure format resembles the standalone session,
except that the players keep the same characters from session to session. As
with the standalone session, you save yourself the trouble of coming up with
broad storylines or campaign details, and the record-keeping is minimal, so
this is a fairly easy game format for the Dungeon Master to run. However, the
players have the chance to become familiar with their characters and advance
them over time. It’s also easy to move from this model into a “real” campaign
if the group wants to do so later on.
109
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

Run your D&D game as a dungeon-of-the-week adventure if . . .
 Your D&D game sessions are infrequent or hard to schedule.
 The players like advancing existing characters more than trying out 
new ones.
 The players view continuing story elements as a distraction and like to
play a style of game that’s fast and light.
The one-shot campaign
The one-shot campaign is one long adventure that spans many game sessions,
because exploring a deep dungeon isn’t the work of just one evening. A D&D
group can tackle about four or five encounters in the course of a three- or
four-hour game session, so any adventure that features more than a half-
dozen distinct encounters might require multiple sessions to complete. Most
Dungeon Masters routinely run extended adventures that stretch across
months of real time, tackling a few rooms in a big dungeon every week until
the player characters have explored the whole thing. 
Your group might need to play once or twice a week for months to get
through an epic adventure, but when the adventure is finished, it’s done. You
put away the dungeon, the players retire the characters, and the next time
you begin a D&D game you can start with a party of brand-new characters
tackling a brand-new dungeon. 
The big advantage of the one-shot campaign is that you tailor the scope of
your ongoing game to the adventure material and play time you have avail-
able. If you pick up Dungeon Magazine or buy a ready-to-play D&D adventure
from your game store, you’ve got everything you need to run a game lasting
weeks or months — you don’t need to scramble each week to come up with
something to throw in front of the players. The players have lots of time to
become familiar with their characters and usually get to advance them at
least a few levels over the course of the game.
Run your D&D game as a one-shot campaign if . . .
 You’ve got one good adventure to run, and you expect it will take at least
a few game sessions to play it out.
 You’ve got a real-world time constraint to consider, such as a school
year, a summer break, or a military deployment.
 You want to present some story elements and character advancement,
but don’t want to track an evolving storyline and campaign history over
multiple adventures.
110
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

The continuing campaign
Many D&D players feel that the game is at its very best when they get to keep
their same characters week after week. Over time the players get to know their
characters and watch them grow in power, experience, and heroic reputation.
111
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

The adventuring party moves from one dungeon or adventure to the next,
which often presents an entirely new threat unrelated to the challenge of the
previous adventure. When you string two (or more) adventures together for
the same group of characters, it’s a continuing campaign. The players keep
their characters, and you slowly build up a history of dungeons plundered
and monsters defeated by the heroes.
Campaigns invest the players in your D&D world and allow for the rewarding
experience of growing a character over time. This format is the best for enter-
taining players who like to roleplay their characters, and it gives you your
best opportunity to engage in the rewarding job of world-building — making
up your own world to serve as the setting for your D&D games. However, it
requires a modest amount of record-keeping and work on your part to keep a
campaign running smoothly for adventure after adventure.
Run your D&D game as a continuing campaign if . . .
 You have several adventures you’d like to run for your gaming group.
 You enjoy the process of world-building and want to show off your 
creativity.
 The players enjoy roleplaying and exploring their characters in depth.
 The membership of your game group tends to remain stable over time.
Keeping Records
Over the course of an extended adventure or campaign, the player characters
most likely slay many monsters, discover a number of powerful and useful
magic items, encounter memorable NPCs, and travel vast distances across
your campaign world. Many Dungeon Masters like to actively keep track of
how much experience the characters earn, how much wealth they accumu-
late, what they do, and who they meet. Recording the major events and finds
of your campaign helps you to keep an eye on how fast the player characters
are progressing through levels, whether they possess an appropriate amount
of gear for their levels, and how much information you’ve actually put in front
of the players. 
You can get along just fine with virtually no record-keeping at all. But we’re all
human, and if the game runs for months and months, sooner or later a player
is going to remember something you’ve since forgotten. If a player notices
your lapse, he or she might not realize you’d simply forgotten a detail, and
might come to a mistaken conclusion. For example, say a player catches you
changing an NPC’s description because you’d forgotten exactly how you
112
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

described that NPC earlier. The player might easily jump to the wrong conclu-
sion, like this: “Hey, last time we met this Lord Thrinn guy, you said he was
old, coughed a lot, and seemed like he was on his deathbed. Now you’re
saying he’s in robust good health and seems vigorous and hearty. I bet he’s
been turned into a vampire! Quick, let’s get him before he sets us up!” All of a
sudden, you’ve thrown the players on the wrong track because you forgot a
minor detail about an NPC that they remembered.
On the mechanical side of the game, record-keeping helps you to keep a close
eye on what the characters are and aren’t capable of. If you’re thinking about
creating a dungeon encounter that can’t be defeated unless at least one of the
characters can fly, it’s very useful to check your copies of the character sheets
or your treasure log and see whether anyone in the party has a potion of fly or
winged boots.
The no-records game
We won’t beat around the bush: Record-keeping can be a little tedious. A D&D
game should be about fun and adventure, not documentation. If you’re running
a D&D game built around standalone sessions or dungeon-of-the-week adven-
tures, you don’t really need to keep any records at all. Other than awarding
experience points for defeating monsters and telling the players what trea-
sure their characters find, you can leave the rest of the record-keeping to the
players. They’ll tell you when their characters amass enough XP to advance a
level. Just point players to Table 3-2 on page 22 of the Player’s Handbook to
figure out the XP target for their next character level, or check their progress
at the end of each game session.
The DM binder
If you decide you want to keep records of the game, get a good-sized binder
with a couple pockets to serve as your DM binder. In addition to the game
records, you can use it for collecting information about your campaign world
in one spot, as well as the current adventure you’re running. Some of the
things you’ll want in your DM binder include
 Adventure log: Keep a running journal of major events, encounters, and
happenings in the game. Organize it by game session and start off by
noting the date, which players show up, and which characters they run. 
 PCs’ character sheets: Keep a current copy of the character sheet for
each player’s character. This will help you to keep an eye on what spells,
items, and capabilities the characters have, which is very useful when
113
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

you go about designing or modifying adventures. You can collect the
players’ character sheets at the end of the game session and hold them
until the next game, or you might prefer to make copies.
 NPC logs/character sheets: Build a roster of NPCs you’ve introduced
into the game, along with some notes about where and when the player
characters met them. You don’t have to record each word that every
NPC speaks to the party, but you might want to note a couple salient
points from an important conversation, such as a negotiation. Jot down
NPC names, characteristics, and personality quirks so that you can stay
consistent if and when the NPCs return in the future. Also keep charac-
ter sheets for any NPCs you think the heroes might fight, or at least note
any pertinent skills the NPCs might possess.
 Treasure logs: Keep track of how much treasure the player characters
find, which player characters claim which magic items, and how the
player characters divide out the coins, gems, and other things as cold
hard cash. Don’t forget to note which magic items the player characters
sell or trade and which they buy. The magic items a player character
carries are an important part of his or her overall power, so you need to
know just how loaded each of the player characters is (or isn’t).
Building a Basic Campaign
Although you can run standalone sessions or present dungeon-of-the-week
adventures indefinitely, most Dungeon Masters eventually graduate to pre-
senting an ongoing campaign. A campaign is simply a string of adventures in
which the same cast of player characters takes part. At the most basic level,
the campaign is nothing more than the sequence in which you throw unre-
lated adventures at the same group of player characters. At the deep end, a
campaign is a sprawling world populated with memorable NPCs, deadly vil-
lains, and riveting storylines that keep the players coming back for years.
Don’t let this intimidate you; we’re starting at the shallow end.
Linking adventures together
A vital step in creating an ongoing campaign is to provide a link from one
adventure to the next. For example, the players defeat the hill giant warchief
of Desolate Mountain and drive away the orc raiders lairing there. For your
next adventure, you’ve got a vampire-hunting expedition in the crypts
beneath the noble district of the city of Westgate. How do you tie these
adventures together into a continuing story?

The short answer is that you don’t have to. You can just start the next game
by telling the players where their characters are now and what it is they think
they’re trying to do. In the preceding example, you could say something 
like this:
After defeating the warchief of Desolate Mountain, you went back to the
town of Griffonford. You received a summons from Lord Thrinn of the city of
Westgate, who heard of your success and requested you to come to his
palace on urgent business. You rode three days to the city of Westgate, and
now you’re waiting in the library of Lord Thrinn’s palace. The door opens,
and Lord Thrinn comes in . . .
Do you see what happened there? You didn’t ask the players what they
wanted to do next — you picked up their characters and dropped them at the
starting point of the next adventure. This technique might seem a little heavy
handed, but most D&D players understand that you’re just trying to get their
characters to the adventure, and they’ll forgive you for decreeing that their
characters went to Westgate, went to Lord Thrinn’s palace, and waited for the
old fellow to show up to tell them what’s going on with the vampires.

Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game
Getting the players to help
Keeping track of all this stuff can get compli-
cated. Ask the players to help you with the
details, so that you can focus on presenting the
adventure instead of note-keeping. Here are
some jobs you can divvy out to the players:
 Treasure recorder: This player writes down
every bit of loot the player characters
recover, where they got it from, which char-
acter is carrying it, and what the party ulti-
mately does with it. 
 Journal keeper: This player records the 
significant events and encounters of the
evening’s game session, including which
NPCs the player characters meet, which
monsters they fight, and any potential clues
they discover. 
 Initiative organizer: This player maintains
the initiative order in combat. (This isn’t
really record-keeping, but having a player
take over this job frees up the DM to con-
centrate on creating an exciting battle.)
Giving out these sorts of jobs to the players
helps take some of the burden off your shoul-
ders, and also gives the players something else
to help them stay focused on the game and
invested in what’s going on. At the end of the
game session, ask the players helping you to
give you a copy of their notes or to write them
up at greater length and send them to you in the
next day or so. By reviewing the party’s journal,
you might spot mistakes you made in present-
ing the adventure or vital clues the player char-
acters missed, or you might find opportunities
to improve the adventure by throwing the play-
ers a twist they don’t expect.

When you’ve gotten the hang of starting the next adventure after the current
one ends, you can start working on some more elegant transitions. Sometimes
you should allow the players to choose between adventures — in the preced-
ing example, the player characters might receive a summons from Lord Thrinn
at the same time that they’re studying an old treasure map they found in the
warchief’s loot. Which adventure hook they follow is up to the players. Giving
the players some choice over what their characters do next helps to build the
illusion of a three-dimensional, living world that is waiting for the characters to
make up their minds. Of course, you will need to have at least two adventures
ready to run when you offer the players the choice of which to play next.
You’ll find that it’s useful to sow the seeds of future adventures by working
foreshadowing elements into the current adventure. In the earlier example,
you should make a point of telling the players about the treasure map among
the warchief’s possessions when they find it so that you don’t have to go
back later and say, “Oh, and you found a treasure map, and followed it, and
here you are.” If you want to try your hand at creating encounters or modify-
ing an adventure, you could add an encounter in the hill giant warchief
adventure that foreshadows the vampire adventure coming next. For exam-
ple, you could create an encounter with a traveling bard who turns out to be
a vampire during the course of the adventure against the warchief and his
minions. When the player characters defeat the bard and examine her pos-
sessions, they find gold coins stamped with the seal of the city of Westgate.
Later on, when the heroes receive the message from Lord Thrinn, the players
already expect that the adventure in Westgate might involve vampires.

Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 
Taking a cue from your TV
An ongoing D&D campaign has a lot in common
with TV series such as Star Trek or Buffy the
Vampire Slayer. You’ve got a continuous cast of
player characters who are like the stars of the
show, and each adventure is like an episode of
the series. You might have a recurring villain or
threat who appears every now and then. And
your D&D game should be about the player
characters in the same way that a TV series is
about the main characters.
In an episodic series like Star Trek, each week’s
show (or adventure) presents a problem or
challenge, which the heroes then tackle. At the
end of the show, the problem’s been solved. For
the next show, the Enterprise goes to a new
planet, encounters a new problem, and the
characters have a new adventure. You don’t
have to spend a lot of time explaining how the
Enterprise got to the new planet or why it was
sent there; all that’s really important is the fact
that it’s there now. Substitute dungeon for
planet and swap a long ride or march for warp
speed, and you’ve got the makings of a D&D
campaign. 
Sometimes events or characters from earlier
adventures resurface in later adventures —
which means that the players must be con-
scious of the fact that their characters’ suc-
cesses and failures might come back to haunt
them at some future date.

Pacing character advancement
Another important characteristic of a campaign is that the player characters
advance and evolve over time. Players expect their characters to gradually
advance, especially in a continuing campaign. The experience system
described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide assumes that it takes about 13
encounters for the characters in the party to gain a level — assuming that the
party contains four characters and that the encounters have ELs (Encounter
Levels) that are equal to the average party level. For example, if the party
consists of three 3rd-level characters and a 4th-level character, the average
party level is 3, so 13 EL 3 encounters should get most of the characters up a
level. Most groups of D&D players can tackle about four encounters per game
session, so if you play once a week, you can expect the characters to gain a
level about once a month in real time.
You can find a discussion on awarding XP on page 38 of the Dungeon Master’s
Guide. Encounter levels are discussed under “Encounters,” on page 48 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide. Basically, if the party fights a single monster, the
monster’s Challenge Rating is the encounter’s Encounter Level. A displacer
beast is a CR 4 monster, so fighting one displacer beast is an EL 4 encounter.
Experience point awards vary from 200 to 40,000 or more, depending on the
CR of the monster and the level of the party. High-CR creatures have higher
rewards, and characters who fight monsters whose CR is higher than the
average party level earn more XP than characters fighting monsters whose
CR is lower than their level. It’s all spelled out on Table 2-6 in the Dungeon
Master’s Guide.
Not all characters will advance to the next level at the same time. If one of 
the players misses a game session or two, his character misses out on the
experience points and might fall behind the rest of the party. That’s okay —
the players who come to your game most often are rewarded for consistent
attendance.
You might find that the players advance their characters faster or slower
than this. If you play more than once a week, the player characters will
advance faster. If fewer players are in your group, the characters will also
advance faster because the XP (experience points) will be divided between
fewer characters. And if you throw encounters that are above the party’s
level at the group (and the player characters survive), the characters will
advance faster. Similarly, less frequent games or more players mean slower
level advancement. 
Finding the right balance between slow and rapid advancement is a bit of a
challenge. If players don’t level up often enough, they’re missing out on one
of the most rewarding parts of the game — seeing a character become more
powerful. If they level up too quickly, they don’t have time to learn all of their
117
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

characters’ new capabilities before they’re trying to master a new set of infor-
mation. It also dulls the excitement of making a level. So, you need to pay
attention to how much experience you’re awarding to the player characters
at the end of each game session.
Creating the home base
The third component of a basic campaign is some sort of home base — a set-
ting and collection of familiar characters to serve as the framing device for
your D&D game. The home base gives the player characters roots in your
game world. It’s a place for the player characters to care about, a place they
want to protect. When the PCs need to trade loot for useful gear, the home
base is where they go. When the PCs need to get advice or guidance about
how to solve a problem, some NPC at the home base is the person they’ll ask.
And when the PCs begin to explore the world outside the dungeon, the home
base is where they start.
Over time, you can use the home base as a springboard for designing your
own D&D world. But for starters, a good home base needs only NPCs, com-
merce, and story.
Home base NPCs
Unless the players like to roleplay complete misfits, every character in the
party implies a network of NPC patrons, advisers, friends, and rivals. For
example, if one of the player characters is a cleric of St. Cuthbert, it’s natural
to ask where other clerics of St. Cuthbert might be found. If another player
character is a rogue, it’s good to know whether the home base has any kind of
organized thieves’ guild, and if so, how does it get along with the adventurer?
When you populate the home base, think about including NPCs who fill the
following roles:
 An authority figure, such as a mayor or lord, who can ask the PCs to
help out the town by solving problems (and thus providing adventure
opportunities)
 A sage, a counselor, or an adviser who can answer questions for the PCs
 A merchant who can buy and sell things the PCs are interested in
 A cleric, druid, or other healer who can fix injuries or curses that the
PCs can’t handle with their own spells
 Innkeepers, barmaids, and other common folk as needed to make the
home base feel like, well, home
118
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Commerce
The player characters need access to people who will give them gold in
exchange for valuables they recover from monster lairs, including magic
items the players don’t want to keep. If everyone in the party already has a +2
magic weapon, the players will want to sell any +1 weapons they find, and the
home base is the place to do that. The PCs also need a place to commission
spellcasting they can’t do themselves and buy useful magic items such as
potions, scrolls, and wands.
The home base should have most (if not all) of the following services and
goods available:
 A temple, druid’s grove, or similar place where the PCs can obtain heal-
ing spells (especially important for low-level characters who don’t yet
have access to the spells needed to fix problems such as poison, paraly-
sis, or disease)
 A wizard’s tower, scribe’s workshop, or library where the PCs can have
magic items identified by means of an identify spell
 An armorer’s and weaponmaker’s shop, selling both normal and master-
work versions of most common weapons and armor
 A dealer in unusual mundane items (sunrods, lock picks, and other dun-
geoneering supplies) and minor magical items, such as potions or scrolls
 A place to meet potential NPC contacts, hirelings, or allies
Story
The home base should be a distinct locale with its own memorable features,
setting, and history. You don’t need a lot of this at first; these elements can
grow over time. Just add a detail or two each time the player characters
return to their home base. As the players discover more about what’s going
on in and around the home base, you’ll be surprised at how they begin to
identify with the place their characters view as home. Important story ques-
tions to address include
 Where are the nearest dungeons, ruins, or monster lairs? How do the
locals view these places?
 What does the place look like? Is it a mining town in the hills? A half-
forgotten seaport on a fog-shrouded coast? A frontier outpost surrounded
by vast forests?
 What do the people do to feed themselves? To make money?
 Who’s in charge?
119
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

 Who keeps order in the town?
 Are there any potential villains or opponents for the PCs to deal with?
A Sample Base: Griffonford
To help you get started, this section provides an example of a typical home
base — a human settlement called Griffonford that’s located near a couple of
good dungeons for the PCs to explore. Griffonford is a small village that can
serve as the home base for a group of beginning player characters.
You can introduce Griffonford before the player characters ever set out on
their first adventure. Some characters might be natives of the area; others
might be travelers who happen to find themselves in the town when adven-
ture comes to call. 
We think it’s best to avoid starting the heroes in their home base before their
first adventure. It’s a stronger beginning for the game to start off with the
heroes already at the door of the dungeon. Give the players a good taste of
heroic deeds and dark dangers before you show them a place where their
characters do ordinary things like bartering for goods or talking to people
who don’t want to kill them. Griffonford is the answer to the question, “So
where do we go when we leave this dungeon?”
The first time the player characters walk or ride into town, you should give
them a brief description of what the place is like. The following read aloud
text is designed to do just that:
The old dwarven trade road descends into a wooded valley and crosses a
swift, cold river at a shallow ford. A village huddles close to the road, sur-
rounded by apple orchards and small square fields of grain. A fortified
manor-house crowns a low hill at one end of the town, and at the far end of
the village a small, ramshackle tower sits atop a steep knoll. You can make
out an inn a little ways ahead, with a green griffon painted on its signboard. 
The story of Griffonford
Long ago, a dwarf kingdom in the mountains far to the north built a trade
road leading to the human cities farther south. Caravans using this road
needed a place to stop along the way, and the fords of the Dholin River were
a natural campsite. However, the Dholin Vale and the rugged hills around the
area were wild and unsettled, so monsters often troubled travelers and mer-
chants in this vicinity. In particular, a pride of fierce griffons often carried off
luckless travelers here.
120
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Sixty years ago, a human knight named Kale Averoth obtained a writ from the
lord of a nearby city to clear the Dholin Vale of monsters and establish a
watchtower at the ford in order to protect travelers using the dwarven road.
Averoth and his fellows slew several griffons and drove off the rest. Settlers
soon came to the Dholin ford (now known as the Griffon Ford) to carve out
homesteads under the protection of the watchtower Averoth raised. Soon a
small town grew here and became known as Griffonford.
Griffonford and the wild lands of the Dholin Vale are now the demesne of the
Averoth family, and the grandson of Kale Averoth governs the town. Most of
the townsfolk and homesteaders are humans, but a family of dwarves known
as the Durekkins runs a small ironworks on the banks of the Dholin, and a
caravan of 50 halflings from the Thistlefoot clan has taken up residence in the
meadows south of the town. The Thistlefoots have stayed in Griffonford for
more than a year now, and it’s only a matter of time before they decide to
move on to settle in for a season or two somewhere else.
121
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

Although Griffonford is a reasonably safe spot, adventurers don’t have to go
far from the road to find trouble. Dangerous monsters roam in the rugged
hills and thick woods that ring the Dholin Vale. Marauding orcs and ogres
sometimes waylay travelers on the road or raid an outlying homestead, and
lately there have been reports of sinister hooded strangers gathering near
the old ruined monastery a couple miles from town. Lord Averoth could
really use a brave band of troubleshooters (the party of player characters, in
other words) to help keep the monsters at a safe distance, the roads clear,
and the abandoned ruins empty as they ought to be.
Notable NPCs
Griffonford is home to about 400 people, including those who live in the out-
lying farms. Most of the townspeople make their living as farmers, or cater 
to the caravans and travelers who pass through the town along the North
Way. The townsfolk are a little suspicious of strangers, but won’t take long to
warm up to heroes who seem willing to take on monsters and bandits on
their behalf. 
We describe the town’s notable citizens  in the following subsections.
Lord Tardin Averoth
The ruler of the Dholin Vale is Lord Tardin Averoth, an aging human noble-
man who generally lets the town look after its own affairs. He is a friendly but
dignified fellow who likes to discuss the weather and his apple orchards. 
Tardin Averoth has a dark secret: His younger brother Vesgin is a vile necro-
mancer who was driven out of Griffonford some years ago. Vesgin swore
vengeance against his own family, and has wandered the rest of the kingdom
for years, practicing his evil art and preparing for the day when he can make
his triumphant return. 
Role: Tardin is a potential patron. When the PCs need to hear about the next
adventure opportunity, you can use him as a mouthpiece for getting the play-
ers to the adventure. 
Piersera Thistlefoot
A halfing merchant who has turned her family’s wagons into a temporary trad-
ing post for as long as the Thistlefoots remain in town, Piersera is a canny
businesswoman who relies on a vast network of kinfolk in other towns and
realms to buy and sell almost anything. She is affable, but not very sincere —
she thinks of humans (and other Big Folk) as more than a little thick-witted. 
122
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Role: Piersera is a merchant who can buy or sell almost any mundane com-
modity. When the PCs need to go shopping or sell off loot they would prefer
to turn into cash, they can go see Piersera. 
Kelldan Hoffter
Proprietor of the Green Griffon Inn, Kelldan is a tall, balding human of about
60. He is a loud, boisterous man who shouts a constant stream of orders at
the army of nephews, nieces, children, and grandchildren who do most of the
work at the inn. He has a broad streak of common sense and hears all kinds
of stories from travelers passing through. 
Role: When the heroes look for a place to rest while in town, they’ll find that
a room at the Green Griffon is the best way to go. If they cultivate Kelldan’s
friendship, they might even be rewarded with important rumors from time 
to time.
Hammerfist Durekkin
Head of the Durekkin clan, Hammerfist is a skilled armorer and weaponsmith.
He is a dwarf who keeps his own counsel, and rarely speaks except to utter
dwarven aphorisms such as, “The sharp axe takes off a goblin’s head with
one good stroke,” or “Five goblins and a fire spell trouble, mark my words.” 
Role: Hammerfist can buy or sell weapons and armor, and sometimes even
has magical weapons or armor to sell.
Regir Runecloak
Griffonford’s resident wizard is the half-elf Regir Runecloak, who lives in the
small tower overlooking the town. A semi-retired adventurer, Regir spends
much of his time puttering around with alchemical experiments in his base-
ment. He dislikes interruptions and can’t abide a fool, but he has a keen mind
and can’t resist an arcane mystery. 
Role: Regir can buy or sell arcane potions, scrolls, or wands. He can also be
paid for spellcasting services if needed. He is a 6th-level wizard.
Initiate Morsennil Druth
A human cleric of Pelor (a good-aligned deity of the sun), Initiate Morsennil is
a thoughtful woman of about 40 who has tended the shrine of the sun god in
Griffonford for five years now. She is very worried about the rumors of evil gath-
erings in the ruined monastery, and wants the place cleared of an evil influence. 
Role: Morsennil can buy or sell divine potions and scrolls, or be paid to cast
spells on the heroes’ behalf. She is a 7th-level cleric. She has two scrolls of
123
Chapter 8: Running an Ongoing Game

raise dead that she can sell or use on the PCs behalf, but each costs over
6,000 gp. Morsennil won’t use one of these precious scrolls unless the PCs
can afford to pay her for it.
Adventures near Griffonford
Only two miles from Griffonford lie the ruins of an ancient evil monastery,
crouching atop a small hill overlooking the river. Farther to the west, the
Dholin Vale becomes very wild and rugged; Griffonford’s shepherds and
goatherds keep their flocks well away from the western woods. On the south
side of the valley, in the middle of the rugged hills, adventurers have discov-
ered an old dwarf-made mine. From the evil monastery to the wild woods to
the dwarven mine, adventurers will find plenty of things to do in Griffonford’s
immediate vicinity.
You could easily use any of these three ideas — the ruined monastery, dwar-
ven mine, or the monster-filled woods — as a springboard for designing your
own dungeon or outdoors adventure set near Griffonford. See Part III for
more information on designing your own adventures.

I
f a D&D adventure is a movie or an episode of a TV series, the Dungeon
Master is the scriptwriter, director, and supporting cast all rolled into one.
Like any good moviemaker, you need to think about the audience you’re
trying to reach with your game — the players. If the players are interested in
a fast-paced shoot-’em-up sort of game, they aren’t going to be entertained by
exploring their emotional range with hours of free-form roleplaying. Similarly,
if the players like to invest their characters with personalities and manner-
isms that no one ever notices because they do nothing but fight, fight, fight,
they aren’t going to be as satisfied with the game you’re running as they
could be. To present a game that the players will want to come back to week
after week, you need to figure out what it is they’re looking for in a game and
give it to them on a regular basis.
This chapter discusses the various player styles and gives advice on how to
run a game that involves and interests the different types of gamers.
Figuring Out Player Styles
The first step in delivering the type of game the players will enjoy is figuring
out what they want. Different people look for different experiences in their
D&D games. Some players want to see how many monsters their characters
can beat, some players like the challenge of trying to act out their characters’
parts, and some players show up just because they like to socialize and don’t
really care much about the game at all. If your D&D group includes players
from opposing extremes, you’ll need to present a variety of different play
experiences in your games to keep everyone happy and entertained.

Note that the players might never identify themselves as one type of player
or another. You might have to figure that out after observing them at play for
a while, and then adjust the adventures accordingly.
The basic divide in player preferences is between people who play the game
to roleplay and people who play to beat up monsters and gain power. Most
people in the hobby think of themselves as either roleplayers or power
gamers, although it’s a little more complicated than that because the vast
majority of players like at least some mix of both approaches in their games.
Roleplayers
Roleplayers are the players who like to pretend to be someone else and
immerse themselves in the imaginary setting. They’re interested in their
characters’ likes and dislikes, quirks and mannerisms, and history and rela-
tionships with other characters in the game setting. Roleplayers don’t like to
see the rules get in the way of the story. For them, the mechanics of the D&D
game exist to serve as a vehicle for roleplaying and storytelling.
Roleplayers often . . .
 Choose a distinctive voice for their character.
 Prefer encounters where they can talk and roleplay instead of just fight.
 Create detailed histories about their characters.
 Choose interesting or flavorful options instead of pure combat options
when they advance their characters.
Power gamers
Power gamers are the players who like to gain levels and crush monsters
every week. They’re interested in their characters’ powers and abilities —
personality or mannerisms are an afterthought. Power gamers don’t like it
when story elements interfere with the action. For them, story serves as
window-dressing for the challenge of beating the next monster and growing
more powerful. 
Power gamers often . . .
 Carefully optimize their character’s race, class, feat, and spell choices.
 Prefer fights to roleplaying encounters.
 Create minimal personalities or histories for their characters.
 Study various game sourcebooks, looking for powerful new abilities
when advancing their characters.
126
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Introducing the Player Types
Within the two basic gaming styles of roleplayer and power gamer are several
different subgroups. For example, some players are natural rebels — regard-
less of whether they favor roleplaying or power gaming, they like to test
limits and indulge themselves by using D&D to do and say things they never
would in real life. Other players are students of the game. They like to
increase their mastery over the game by learning more about how it works,
whether that’s by figuring out the best way to run their characters in a fight
or by learning as much as possible about the game world their characters
adventure in.
127
Chapter 9: Knowing the Players

Taken together, these tendencies and traits provide seven basic player types:
the hack’n’slasher, the wargamer, the thinker, the impulsive adventurer, the
explorer, the character actor, and the watcher. Most players don’t fall into
any one camp, but instead have traits that fall across a couple of categories.
Hack’n’slasher
A hack’n’slasher player is a power gamer. He or she just likes to beat the
stuffing out of monsters, and resists efforts to complicate the game beyond
this basic exercise. The point of D&D is to kill monsters, get their cool stuff,
get stronger, and kill more powerful monsters and get their cool stuff, too.
Combat is what the hack’n’slasher wants, and the more combat, the better. 
A hack’n’slasher often . . .
 Plays a barbarian, fighter, or other class that’s good at melee combat.
 Gets bored with anything that isn’t a fight.
 Plays very impulsively and doesn’t follow plans.
 Keeps the game moving with his or her demand for action.
128
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 
Which is better?
If you spend any amount of time around long-
time D&D players, sooner or later you’ll run
across the contention that one style of play is
better than the other. 
One school says that roleplayers are better than
power gamers. Because the power gamers
don’t immerse themselves in their characters or
their settings, the roleplaying advocates believe
that the power gamers are playing a diminished
game. The best players know that skillfully por-
traying an imaginary character is the whole
point of a roleplaying game — or so the role-
players say.
The other side says that power gamers are
better than roleplayers because power gamers
know the rules of the game inside and out and
use that knowledge to their best advantage.
Power gamers believe that all that “talky stuff”
is boring and misses the point of the game,
which is to gain power and defeat monsters.
To our way of thinking, any game is a good game
if the players are having fun. Don’t let gaming
snobs from either side of the aisle tell you that
your game isn’t as good as theirs or that you
aren’t playing the game right. The right way to
play, the best way to play, is to use the style and
method that leads to the most fun for you and
your game group.

Wargamer
The wargamer is a competitive power gamer. These players live to amass
power and defeat the game, and they aren’t really picky about how that’s
done. Unlike hack’n’slashers, wargamers are perfectly willing to consider
solutions that don’t involve fighting the bad guys; they are the ultimate 
pragmatists. Wargamers enjoy high-level play because it gives them the
opportunity to exercise an ever-greater impact on the game world, and they
live for the opportunity to level up.
A wargamer often . . .
 Plays a cleric, wizard, or other class with access to high-powered magic.
 Chooses character options (such as skills, feats, and spells) strictly
based on power.
 Knows the game rules very well.
 Enjoys pondering the tactics of every situation.
 Discerns the most efficient way to complete an adventure and drives the
rest of the players toward that goal.
Thinker
The thinker player views the game as a puzzle to be solved. Tricky tactical
situations such as dealing with flying monsters or enemy archers on the
other side of a lava moat are puzzles, too, so the thinker is often an excellent
tactician. Unlike the wargamer, the thinker doesn’t mind playing a weak char-
acter because the challenge is there to see just how well he or she can do
with limited options. 
A thinker often . . .
 Plays a variety of character classes over time.
 Enjoys logic puzzles, defeating traps, and other challenges that don’t
necessarily involve combat or interaction.
 Knows the game rules better than anyone else at the table.
 Takes a long time to figure out the exact right action in each round of
combat.
129
Chapter 9: Knowing the Players

Impulsive adventurer
Think of an impulsive adventurer player as the rebellious roleplayer. This
player doesn’t like letting his or her character sit still, and when the adventure
begins to lag for whatever reason, this player finds a way to get it moving
again. A D&D game is set in an imaginary world populated with imaginary
characters, so why not have fun by trying out the most outrageous things you
can think of? The impulsive adventurer is the player who can’t resist testing
the implicit and explicit rules of the game world. Usually, this isn’t a deliberate
effort to annoy you or the other players — it’s just another form of escapism,
and D&D is all about letting your imagination run free for a couple hours.
An impulsive adventurer often . . .
 Plays a signature class (often a barbarian, bard, or rogue) in game 
after game.
 Has his or her PC pick fights with NPCs, even if they aren’t people the
PCs are really supposed to fight in the adventure.
 Acts impulsively and pushes the borders of what the game allows.
 Can’t resist making the PC open doors, pull levers, push buttons, or
peek around the corner to see what’s waiting there.
 Makes things happen when the adventure stalls by doing something
completely unexpected.

The explorer is a roleplayer too, but more introverted than the character
actor and much less rebellious than the impulsive adventurer. This player is
fascinated with the imaginary world revealed in the game, and wants to know
everything about it. If you’re playing in a published campaign setting such as
the FORGOTTEN REALMS or EBERRON, the explorer has copies of all the source-
books for the setting and reads the novels set in the world.
An explorer often . . .
 Carefully builds characters to fit the world and chooses roleplaying man-
nerisms and character abilities appropriately.
 Asks lots of questions about the back story of the adventure and the his-
tory of the setting.
 Makes maps of each dungeon or other adventure setting.
 Approaches adventures with the intent to fit his or her character into
the story, instead of making the story fit his or her character.

Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Character actor
The character actor plays D&D because it gives this player the chance to pre-
tend to be someone else — to think, talk, and act like the character he or she
has created. The character actor is happiest when given plenty of chances to be
the character. This player is also happy to do nothing all game session long
except talk to other players in character, using the character’s voice, so hashing
out democratic decisions within the party (for example, “What do we do next?”
or “Can we really trust this drow wizard?”) are just as fun as encounters the
DM puts in front of the party.
A character actor often . . .
 Plays a signature class (often a bard, rogue, or swashbuckler) who relies
on personality more than brute power.
 Adopts distinctive voice or mannerisms for his or her character and
tries to talk to almost anybody or anything the party encounters.
 Gets bored with too many fights.
 Serves as the party spokesperson.
 Engages in the story more than any other player.
Watcher
Finally, there’s the player type that’s no type at all — the watcher. The
watcher is just not inclined to jump into the game with both feet. He or she
might be unusually shy or reserved, or might be truly apathetic. A player
who is easily distracted because your game isn’t holding his or her attention
is a watcher, but so is the new player who could turn out to be an enthusiastic
D&D fan after getting over his or her initial hesitation about trying a game he
or she doesn’t know how to play yet.
A watcher often . . .
 Plays a class that’s easy to run, such as a barbarian or fighter (although
many groups often make watchers run clerics, because every party
needs a cleric and the watcher doesn’t have a character preference).
 Says little or nothing at all during the course of the game.
 Doesn’t follow the game closely and needs prompting.

Chapter 9: Knowing the Players

Analyzing the Players
When you know something about what makes the typical D&D player tick
(which we explain in the earlier sections of this chapter), you can put that
knowledge to good use. Get a piece of paper and jot down the names of the
players, and then think of things each player seemed to especially like or dis-
like about your game. What sort of character does each player play? Does the
player try to speak in character, or is he or she more hands-off when it comes
to roleplaying? What bores the player?
You don’t have to do this in secret, by the way. Don’t worry about skewing
the results of the experiment by letting the subjects know that they’re being
observed. In fact, you’ll probably get better and more accurate information if
you simply ask the players what they like best about D&D and what they
hope to get out of the game. Here’s a sample player survey you can use to
figure out what the players like:
1. What was your favorite part of the game tonight?
Players who liked “talky” roleplaying encounters best might be explorers
or character actors; players who preferred a combat encounter are more
likely hack’n’slashers or wargamers; and players who enjoyed a puzzle
or tricky challenge might be thinkers.
2. What was the part you liked the least?
Players who liked the combat encounters least are probably character
actors. Players who didn’t like encounters with lots of talking or diplo-
macy are probably hack’n’slashers or thinkers.
3. What do you think is coming next? How do you expect the story to con-
tinue next week?
A player who is closely following the story of the adventure and thinking
hard about what comes next is probably an explorer or character actor.
A player focused on the next big obstacle to defeat may be a wargamer
or thinker, but a player who doesn’t care what comes next might be an
impulsive adventurer or hack’n’slasher.
4. How would you improve the game?
Pay attention to what your players are asking for — that’s the easiest
way to figure out what sort of game style they prefer. You don’t always
have to give the players exactly what they want (in fact, it’s better DMing
to always keep your audience wanting a little more), but you might want
to rethink your current adventure if it looks like it isn’t going to be the
adventure that any of your players are most interested in playing.
132
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Balancing Play Styles
Players naturally like D&D games that cater to their personal style. Players
who are method actors at heart naturally think that the best game is one that
lets them spend the whole evening speaking in voice and demonstrating their
skills at roleplaying. To entertain those players, you can’t present a whole
session full of nothing but combat.
In general terms, you should adjust your own game style to reflect the tastes
of the players. For example, say you have five players at the table. Two are
dyed-in-the-wool character actors, one’s an explorer, one is a hack’n’slasher,
and one is a thinker. For this group, most of the adventures should include an
even split between combat encounters and opportunities for interaction and
exploration away from the dungeon. On the other hand, if the party is com-
posed exclusively of power gamers (wargamers, thinkers, and hack’n’slash-
ers), the vast majority of your game should be spent in dungeons and battle
scenes. The only reason to throw a noncombat encounter at this sort of
group is for the sake of pacing and variety.
We discuss game style in greater depth in Chapter 10.
Getting Along with Difficult Players
It’s sad but true — players sometimes develop habits that make it hard for
everyone else at the table to have fun playing the game. In the following sec-
tions, we take a look at some of the more common types of problem players
and offer some pointers on how to get along with them.
Ultimately, D&D is a social activity. Who you spend your leisure time with and
how much grief you put up with in order to enjoy your hobby are completely
up to you. 
Handling a problem character
One of the cool things about the D&D game is that you can try to create
almost any kind of character. Fortunately, the game can handle all kinds of
strange characters, from half-dragon ogre paladins to medusa sorcerers.
However, sometimes a character becomes a problem in the game. 
133
Chapter 9: Knowing the Players

When a character is broken or disruptive, you might have to take steps to
keep your game fair and fun for all the other players in the game group. 
 A broken character is one who is simply too good. Enough character
options are floating around out there in various game sourcebooks or
magazine articles that any competitively-minded player can usually
build a character who is exceedingly good at something. It’s great when
a player becomes interested enough in the game to seek out really good
combinations of race, class, feat choices, and magic items, but when his
or her character is way better than anyone else at the table, it can lead
to trouble. For example, a character whose Armor Class is 10 points
higher than any other character in the party poses a nasty challenge for
the DM. If you throw a monster at the party who can actually score hits
on the high-AC character, the monster won’t ever miss if it attacks any-
body else. And if you use a monster that’s appropriate for everybody
else, the high-AC character is never going to be threatened. Neither is
good for your game.
 A disruptive character is one that causes trouble within the adventur-
ing party. The classic example is an evil character in an otherwise good
party. It isn’t impossible for a player to pull this off, but if the player
decides that his character ignores, bullies, steals from, or betrays the
other characters in the party, it won’t be long before the game grinds 
to a halt.
To counter these sorts of problems with characters, you might want to lay
down ground rules for character creation in the game. It’s better to spell out
these things ahead of time than to allow a player to advance a problem char-
acter and then ban that character later on. Character guidelines such as “No
evil characters,” or “No feats or spells that aren’t from an official D&D source-
book,” are fairly commonplace. Most players will go along with broad guide-
lines such as these.
Some DMs approach this sort of problem by instituting a sort of “deific
vengeance” against the offending character. All of a sudden, exceptionally
dangerous monsters begin to appear in the game, and they attack only the
single obnoxious character. An evil character finds that his record of mis-
deeds means that powerful good characters and monsters are hunting for
him. This sort of tactic is heavy-handed and “old school,” so we don’t really
recommend it. It’s far too easy to make a player feel like you’re picking on
him or her, and that can lead to bad feelings in a hurry. On the other hand,
many experienced players will quickly realize that you’re applying not-so-
subtle pressure to get the player to give up on the troublesome character and
create a new character who fits the game a little better.
134
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Dealing with a rules lawyer
In the parlance of D&D, a rules lawyer is a player who argues against a DM’s
verdict or adjudication by making reference to the rules. Helping a Dungeon
Master to get the rules right from time to time is okay, but constant argument
stops the game in its tracks and prevents all the other players at the table
from having fun until the question gets resolved.
Rules lawyers come in two stripes: over-helpful and over-competitive. Over-
helpful rules lawyers aren’t really all that bad; they want to make sure the
game runs right, so they are inclined to jump in and “help you get it right”
when they think you’ve made a mistake. If your over-helpful rules lawyer is
usually right, well, that isn’t so bad — Dungeon Masters are human, after all,
and there’s no reason to let a mistake stand because you’re too stubborn to
go back and correct it. On the other hand, if helpful rules lawyers correct you
continuously in the game session, or if they’re wrong more often than not, it
can get old. At least their hearts are in the right place.
The over-competitive rules lawyers are a little harder to deal with. They just
can’t stand negative results. If something bad happens to their characters, or
something good happens for an opponent, the over-competitive rules
lawyers are inclined to look for a loophole or interpretation that favors their
characters and sets the universe back to right (in their eyes, at least). In the
worst cases, this amounts to verbal blackmail or bullying. It isn’t fun for any-
body, except maybe the rules lawyers.
When rules lawyering becomes a problem in the game, consider some or all
of the following steps:
 Hold the questions until the end of the game. Explain to the players
that you’ll be happy to entertain rules debates after the game session,
but during the game you don’t want to break the flow of the action or
your narration by looking up obscure rules.
 Specify conditions for debate. It isn’t unreasonable to ask players to save
rules debates for absolute life-or-death matters. If your ruling doesn’t
spell a character’s actual death, it isn’t worth arguing about. 
 Make the rules lawyer your ally. When you argue against a player,
you’re helping him or her to make it into a power struggle where some-
one winds up winning and someone winds up losing. Take the wind out
of an argumentative player’s sails by asking the player to help determine
the correct answer. Get him or her to help you look up the answer.
 Reward the other players for staying in the game. Tell the rules lawyer
to take as long as he or she wants to look something up, and that you’ll
135
Chapter 9: Knowing the Players

just skip him or her for a while. The monsters will leave the rules lawyer’s
character alone while you continue the adventure with everyone else.
The other players get to play more D&D, and aren’t held ransom to the
rules lawyer’s demands on your time.
 Reason with the player. If nothing else is getting through, draw the
problem player aside, state the problem, and ask how the two of you can
fix it. For example: “Bob, I know I’m not the best DM, but I don’t feel like I
can get anything going for the other players if you’re arguing every call I
make. How can we keep the rules debates from stopping the game for
everybody?”
Speeding up a slow player
Many players can take a long time to decide what they want their characters
to do. Some players simply don’t have a good handle on their characters’
capabilities and honestly don’t know what to do. Other players feel that they
need to figure out the very best course of action every time their turn comes
up, and they get frozen in a sort of analysis-paralysis as they carefully weigh
every choice that’s available. And a few players will want to look up multiple
rules such as spell or feat descriptions before they really start making up
their minds. 
Every player deserves the courtesy of a moment or two to make a good deci-
sion, but watch out for players who bring the game to a screeching halt while
they try to work out what it is their characters will do next. It isn’t fair to
everyone else at the table to stop the game for one slow player, especially if
you’re in the middle of a fast-paced, high-action scene such as a battle against
a dangerous monster. The combat round is supposed to be only 6 seconds of
in-game time, after all — just how long can a wizard ponder the question of
which spell to cast before those seconds are used up?
The easiest way to keep the game moving is to skip a player who’s just taking
too long. Give the player a warning before you skip his character’s turn — it’s
a pretty big penalty to miss out on a round of action. The generous way to skip
the character is to tell the player that you’ve decided his or her character is
delaying his or her initiative (see page 160 of the Player’s Handbook). Whenever
the player finally figures out what it is he or she wants to do, he or she can tell
you that he or she wants to jump back into the initiative order. The harsher
way to skip a slow player is to rule that the character does nothing and leave
the initiative order. The player will have to wait until next round to act.
The decision to pressure a player to play faster and threaten him or her with
delayed or skipped turns is up to you. Many players won’t like being prodded,
136
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

so use this tactic with care. If you have a player who usually plays pretty
quickly or a new player who honestly doesn’t know any better, you might
want to cut him or her some slack. Don’t skip that player unless he or she
has really managed to drag the action to a halt. On the other hand, you might
need to set some ground rules for the game table (how long you’ll let players
think, whether they get delayed or get skipped, and so on) if you have a
habitual show-stopper playing in the game.
Involving the apathetic player
Sometimes, people join D&D games and just aren’t all that interested in play-
ing. Maybe the apathetic player is there only because his or her significant
other is playing. Maybe the apathetic player is part of your circle of friends
but just doesn’t want to learn the game or finds the game boring. Whatever
the reason, the player just doesn’t really want to play D&D — hence the term
apathetic.
Sometimes, an apathetic player is someone who could become an enthusias-
tic and involved contributor at the game. In other cases, the apathetic player
is the guy who tries to convince everyone else to go catch a movie or play
video games instead of playing D&D. You’d really like to cultivate and encour-
age the former while preventing the latter from wrecking the game on a regu-
lar basis. It simply comes down to this: Does the player want to play D&D?
If the player really isn’t at the game table to play, we frankly advise you to avoid
trying to make him or her play. Do you know what they say about trying to
teach a pig to sing? It makes you look foolish, and it annoys the pig. It’s pretty
much the same thing here. As long as the player isn’t actively disruptive, let
him or her come and go as he or she likes. If the player is a real distraction,
well, don’t go out of your way to invite the player to your gaming nights. If the
apathetic player’s presence is important to keeping a good player in the game
(for example, he or she is somebody else’s ride or a significant other), you
might not be able to do this. It would be a shame to exclude a player who likes
your game and has fun because an apathetic player is part of the package, so
we advise erring on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion.
If the player wants to play D&D but isn’t tuning in, either your game is boring
(we certainly hope not, but later chapters can help you work on that) or the
player might be intimidated by the game. D&D can be pretty complex for a
newcomer (which is why we wrote Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies), and
some people are honestly self-conscious about messing up by speaking out
of turn, saying something that reveals a depth of ignorance, or making a
dumb move. 
137
Chapter 9: Knowing the Players

The best cure for this player is time, patience, and encouragement. You might
ask one of the better players to take the new player under his or her wing and
to help the new player stay involved and make good decisions. You could try
to arrange training sessions where you give the shy player an opportunity to
get more familiar with his or her character when other players aren’t around.
(For example, you could arrange a couple one-on-one game sessions in which
the player gets to run a character through very simple adventure or even try
his or her luck in a non-lethal “sparring ground” or arena combat.) Finally,
you can (and should) make a special effort to call on the player frequently
during the course of a game session. If you ask the player questions such as,
“Bob, what does Jozan think about this plan?” or “Say, Bob, what is Jozan
doing while everyone else is searching the room?” you can keep all but the
most timid or remote players involved in the game to some degree.

Choosing Your Game Style
In This Chapter
 Figuring out your style as DM
 Establishing your own style and setting the tone
 Using DM tips and tricks to keep the game moving
 Deciding whether to let a player character die
Just like players, Dungeon Masters have their own preferred styles of game
play. Some DMs are most comfortable running combat-heavy games that
shy away from involved storylines or extended roleplaying. Other DMs view
combat as a means to an end and don’t go out of their way to make sure that
every game session includes a fight of some kind. You might decide that you
want to run your game strictly by the book, or you might prefer to run the
game with snap answers and off-the-cuff rulings so that you don’t have to
slow down and check the rules in the middle of the action.
If you’re wondering which DM style is best, the answer is simply whichever
style makes your game work best. If you’re a natural storyteller, it would be a
shame to ignore your strengths by running a game where you never get to use
that skill. At the same time, you should also consider the sort of game the other
players are hungry for. If they love beating monsters in fights, you’ll have a hard
time keeping them interested and involved if you run a game where they never
get to do what they like best. So, the best game is the game that lets you do
what you do best and gives the players what they want at the same time.
DM Styles: Running the 
Game You Run Best
When you’re thinking about DMing a game session or adventure, the first
thing you should ask yourself is what sort of game you want to run. Do you
want a game with plenty of fighting? A roleplaying-heavy game with lots of
NPC interactions? A low-level game or a high-level game? Before you give any
real thought to what the players might like best in the game, you need to

decide what you would like best. If you try to run a game that you aren’t
really interested in running, it’s going to show.
Are you more comfortable handling action-oriented games that emphasize
getting to the fight or challenge fast, or games that are more about roleplay-
ing and storytelling? Do you like to stay narrowly on task, or do you prefer a
more spontaneous approach to the game?
How you answer these questions can help you determine what type of DM
you are. Most Dungeon Masters fall into one of five basic types: the action
movie director, the storyteller, the puzzlemaker, the worldbuilder, and the
connector. Just as many players like a mix of power gaming and roleplaying,
you’ll find that most DMs like to run games that include some elements from
several of these styles. 
Take a look at the descriptions that follow and see whether you can recognize
yourself. The player descriptions we use in the following sections refer to the
player types (hack’n’slasher, character actor, impulsive adventurer, explorer,
wargamer, thinker, and watcher) that we discuss in Chapter 9.
Action movie director
If you’re an action movie director, you enjoy the game most when the player
characters are locked in mortal combat against some horrible monster.
Everything else in your game exists for the purpose of describing how and
why the heroes move from one fight to the next. Some of the fight scenes
might be important to the overall story of the adventure or the campaign (for
example, a climactic battle against the boss monster of the adventure), while
other fight scenes don’t have any real purpose in advancing the story of your
game, but instead exist solely for the purpose of testing the player characters’
abilities to survive them (for example, a fight against a wandering monster).
You might be an action movie director at heart if . . .
 The game gets easier to handle when you tell the players to roll 
initiative.
 You like to create straightforward adventures with plenty of fighting,
such as the typical dungeon crawl.
 You find it difficult to create unique mannerisms or voices for the NPCs,
and often don’t bother to try.
 You’re most comfortable dealing with players who are hack’n’slashers or
wargamers, and you don’t know how to react to the things character
actors say or do in the game.
140
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Storyteller
If you’re a storyteller DM, you’re out to tell a riveting tale, stocked with great
villains, memorable allies, and supporting characters. It has a great twist at
the end that leaves the players emotionally drained. Fights in your game serve
the story, not the other way around — you’re inclined to view a fight with a
monster that the player characters don’t strictly have to fight (such as a wan-
dering monster) as a distraction from the real business of the game session. 
You might be a storyteller if . . .
 The game is easiest for you when you’re roleplaying an NPC with a spe-
cific part to play (ally or villain) in the adventure.
 You like to create sophisticated adventures that include significant
events and encounters that don’t take place in a dungeon.
 You take pride in crafting memorable mannerisms and voices for the
NPCs the player characters to deal with.
 You’re most comfortable dealing with players who are character actors
or explorers, and you find it hard to keep hack’n’slashers or wargamers
immersed in the story.
Worldbuilder
You’re a worldbuilder DM and you’ve built a fascinating and deeply textured
game world, and you want to share it with your friends. The best way for
them to explore this imaginary world is through the eyes and experiences of
their player characters in your D&D game. Adventures you run reveal specific
features of your campaign world. Sometimes this might be a battle against
some evil faction or monstrous race that poses a grave threat to your world,
but in other cases your adventure might be designed to reveal something
about the ancient history, politics, or magical secrets of your world.
You might be a worldbuilder if . . .
 Your favorite part of the game is the creative exercise of inventing towns,
kingdoms, and nonplayer characters before the game session even starts.
 You rarely use adventures you don’t create yourself.
 You provide the players with extra information or options for character
creation that help them to ground their characters in your world.
 You’re most comfortable dealing with players who are explorers or
thinkers, and you find your game easily derailed by impulsive adventur-
ers or over-enthusiastic character actors.
141
Chapter 10: Choosing Your Game Style

Puzzlemaker
Your goal as puzzlemaker is to test the players’ wits, not their characters’
capabilities. You like to present puzzles, riddles, mysteries, and exotic obsta-
cles that don’t have an answer in the game — instead, the players have to
figure out what’s going on based on the clues you’ve given them. A tricky
combat encounter (for example, fighting against invisible, flying archers) can
be a puzzle of sorts, but your favorite challenges and obstacles don’t require
any sort of attack rolls or skill checks. If the players figure out what’s going
on, they beat the encounter. If not, they don’t, and it doesn’t matter how
much magic or power their characters wield. 
You might be a puzzlemaker if . . .
 Your favorite part of the game is when the players try to figure out how
to beat a tricky problem.
 You design encounters that can’t be defeated by the use of any skill, feat,
spell, or magic item.
 You like to use a lot of props and handouts in your game.
 You’re comfortable with thinkers and explorers, but wargamers are
unhappy because your adventures don’t let them use their character
abilities.
Connector
If you’re a connector DM, you see your game as a set of evolving relationships
between the player characters, their NPC allies, and the signature villains or
monsters in your game. Like the storyteller, you’re mostly interested in
telling a great story — but you see the story as something that spans multi-
ple adventures. The Big Story in your game is the story of the characters the
players create, and that story spans adventure after adventure. If the story-
teller’s dream is to build an adventure that is as riveting and moving as J.R.R.
Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, you want to build something as character-
driven and engaging as George R.R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones. Discovering
the destiny of each character in your group is the ultimate goal.
You might be a connector if . . .
 Your favorite part of the game is when the players talk to each other in
character.
 You design factions and foes that the player characters must deal with, and
then you create adventures that serve to present them to the players.
142
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

 You allow the players to determine what adventure comes next by
choosing for themselves the things their characters are interested in.
 Character actors and explorers immerse themselves in your games, but
wargamers and hack’n’slashers wish you’d give them more combat.
Establishing Your Own Style
If you’re like most Dungeon Masters, you probably recognize characteristics
of your D&D game in several of the DM styles we discuss in the preceding
sections. The best games involve a little bit of everything, so your own per-
sonal style should revolve around the parts of the game you enjoy the best.
Although you should naturally try to play to your strengths, you also need to
keep your audience in mind. Each encounter, challenge, NPC interaction, or
bit of narration you present to the players in the course of an adventure
serves a purpose. Whether you intend it or not, these adventure elements
make some types of players happy while boring other types. If the table is full
of bloodthirsty hack’n’slashers, don’t try to run a game that emphasizes con-
nectivity. If the players are character actors, don’t feed them a game of fight,
after fight, after fight. Most players have the courtesy and patience to wait
through the game elements they don’t like very much in order to get to the
game elements they like the best, but you need to be aware of your audience.
Even if the players are hardcore power gamers or roleplayers, it isn’t a bad idea
to include an occasional “wrong” sort of encounter simply to change the pacing
of your game. The players will appreciate the opportunity to use some different
brain cells and try new things, as long as they get to come back to the parts of
the game they like best. Unless you’re pretty sure that all the players are one
specific type of player and your game style caters directly to them, you’ll find it
best to mix elements of several DM styles into your own unique style.
Setting the Tone
If your DM style describes the elements you like in your D&D game, tone
describes how you like to run your game. Do you try to keep the game
moving fast, or do you let the players roam along at their own pace? Do you
run by the book, or do you prefer a more spontaneous style? Are you striving
to be the affable narrator of the player characters’ tale, or do you gleefully
seek to destroy any player characters that fall into your clutches?
The tone of your game is a pretty subjective standard. It combines your own
particular mannerisms, philosophy, and game goals into a distinct flavor that
143
Chapter 10: Choosing Your Game Style

is different for every DM. The best we can do here is present a handful of slid-
ing scales for you to consider; set each pointer where you’re comfortable.
Arbiter or narrator?
Ask yourself whether you prefer to simply adjudicate the actions the players
take or actively narrate the adventure at hand. 
An arbiter is content to let the players succeed or fail on their own, offering
few (if any) hints to help them overcome difficult challenges or solve tricky
puzzles. Running a game based on strict adjudication is easier in some ways
because you don’t have to figure out how you’re going to help the players
through the tough spots. DMing as an arbiter is good for concentrating on the
basics of the game (controlling monsters and evaluating player actions)
instead of trying to juggle storyline elements at the same time you’re trying
to adjudicate the game. On the down side, it’s hard to run a high-energy game
if you maintain such a passive role.
A narrator actively narrates the game and is interested in telling the player
characters’ stories. You want to see conflict and resolution, the development of
characters, and the advance of your campaign’s various plots and storylines. If
the players stall out on a tough puzzle, you look for ways to move the story
along rather than allow the players to dump the adventure and go do some-
thing else — you’re invested in their success. Active narration requires you to
be more interactive and creative in your DMing. You might have to construct
“patches” for your adventure on the fly so that the story continues. (For
instance, if the villain manages to escape when the heroes assault his lair, a
narrator might spontaneously add a chase scene to the adventure or have the
villain “leave behind” clues about his plans so that the players can still acquire
the key plot point information they were expected to get by defeating their
foe.) Active narration is good for keeping the players engaged and interested,
but requires more spontaneity and ability to make things up on the fly.
On-task or player-paced?
Some Dungeon Masters try to keep their games moving and keep the players
engaged in advancing the adventure, but other DMs allow the players to pace
themselves. 
If you’re an on-task DM, you can definitely tackle more encounters and
resolve more of the adventure, and you have a tighter control over the dra-
matic pacing of the game. The down side is you, as the DM, are always “on.”
You don’t get many chances to organize your thoughts or re-energize yourself
because you’re trying to get as much of the game into the available time as
you can.

Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

The player-paced DM allows the players to set the pace for the adventure.
Allowing the players to pace themselves is easier on you in many ways, but
you’ll find that you don’t get as much of the D&D game under your belt in a
game session. The players might feel like they’re at loose ends if you don’t
provide at least some pressure to make decisions, take actions, and actively
advance the plot. On the other hand, this style of game works very well for
players who enjoy roleplaying and exploration out of combat. As long as the
players are having fun, why worry about getting to the next fight or finishing
the adventure in a timely manner? 
145
Chapter 10: Choosing Your Game Style

By the book or fast and loose?
You should decide whether it’s more important to you to keep the game
moving without interruption or to make sure you get every implementation of
the rules just right. 
Running by the book means that you’ll often have to stop to look up the
answer to a tricky game interaction, which throws everyone at the table out
of character and shifts the focus of the game session from your adventure to
the rules of the game. That can be tedious, but when you look something up
and learn it, you might not need to look it up the next time the situation
arises. And many players place a high value on getting the rules right
because that means they know what to count on in your game.
Playing fast and loose with the game might mean missing some subtle rules
interactions, but on the other hand, you don’t drop out of the adventure to
hit the books and study like it’s finals week. The drawback to this style of
DMing is that the players might find that things they expect to be true in your
game (how a spell works, whether a particular action provokes an attack of
opportunity) might not be true because you aren’t going to stop and double-
check. If you decide to play fast and loose with the rules, make an effort to
run the same thing the same way each time it comes up. (There’s that consis-
tency thing again.) Even if a rule isn’t book-legal, at least the players will have
an opportunity to observe how your game works and adjust their own play
styles and expectations to match.
Building Your DM Toolbox
Every good Dungeon Master has a set of techniques, tricks, and mannerisms
that help keep the game in motion and help to keep it interesting. Your DM
toolbox is a part of your DMing style. When you don’t know what exactly to
do next, a quick trip to your DM toolbox might provide the answer.
Letting the dice decide
The player characters are in the middle of a fierce battle against a bone devil,
and the bone devil’s turn comes up. Does it attack with one of its spell-like
abilities? Does it try a melee attack against a character? Which character
does it attack? You’ve got to make a decision, and while you’re pondering the
question, the game is frozen for the players.
A bone devil is a pretty intelligent monster, so you would be within your rights
to try to analyze the combat from the monster’s point of view and make the
best decision for it. Or, you could instead roll a die and decide things that way.
146
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

For example, you could pick up a d6 and say to yourself, “On a 1-3, the devil
uses a spell-like ability. On a 4-6, he makes a melee attack.” Then you could roll
again to pick a target: “Okay, 1-3 he attacks Jozan, 4-6 he goes after Mialee.” A
couple quick die rolls help you pick the monster’s action for the round.
One of the virtues of letting the dice decide is that it gets you off the hook for
making a tough decision. If you know that Jozan is down to 4 hit points and
the bone devil’s next attack will probably kill him outright, you don’t have to
put yourself in the position of deliberately avoiding Jozan just to be a nice
guy. If the dice say that the bone devil goes after Jozan, well, adventuring is a
dangerous business. It also adds an element of unpredictability to the fights
because the players can’t be sure that the monsters they’re fighting will
always take the obvious best actions.
You can also let the dice decide the answers to questions you just haven’t pre-
pared for. If the players surprise you by offering a pair of orc guards a bribe to
let them pass deeper into the dungeon, and you honestly have no idea whether
the orcs might be amenable to such an arrangement, you could toss a die to see
how likely they are to let greed overcome bloodthirstiness. For example, you
could say to yourself, “On a scale of 1 to 10, just how bribable are these orcs?”
and throw a d10 to see what you get. If you roll a 1 or a 2, take it as an indication
that the orcs are offended that the heroes think they can just buy their way
through the dungeon. If you roll something like a 9 or 10, well, clearly those orcs
aren’t happy with the pittance the dark overlord pays them and are more than
willing to line their pockets any way they can. If you know the orcs are hostile,
ask the players to make a Diplomacy check instead of making a random roll.
There are two important caveats for letting the dice decide: 
 If an intelligent monster clearly has a best choice for its action, the
monster should probably take it. A mind flayer confronting several
player characters at the same time will almost certainly use its mind
blast attack. That’s the smartest thing it could do, and mind flayers are
cunning, intelligent monsters.
 If there is an option or decision that clearly makes for a more interest-
ing or exciting adventure, don’t let the dice screw it up. You might
have had no plans at all for allowing the heroes to bribe the orc guards,
but it would be a shame to stomp on the players’ creativity by refusing
to allow the ploy a chance to work.
Ruling by common sense
Sometimes, you simply need to take a look at what’s going on at the table and
make a decision based on your own common sense. You are allowed (and
expected) to resort to ruling through DM fiat (just making a decision and
telling the players that’s how it is) to keep the game running on an even keel.
147
Chapter 10: Choosing Your Game Style

For example, say that the heroes are being chased by a pack of wolf-riding
goblins and decide to hide by climbing a big tree. One of the heroes’ cohorts
(allies) is a unicorn. According to the strict mechanics of the game, a unicorn
ought to be a good climber because Climb is a Strength-based skill. But it’s
patently silly for any creature that’s got a body like a horse to scramble up
into a tree. By applying the rule of common sense, you can just tell the play-
ers, “Hey, climbing the tree is only a DC 10, but there’s no way your unicorn
friend can do it. Unicorns just aren’t built to climb trees.” 
No rule in the game explicitly states that unicorns can’t climb trees, but you
just made one, and it makes plenty of sense. On the same score, NPCs won’t
go jump off a cliff just because a charismatic hero asks them to do it and rolls
a good Diplomacy check. A rogue can’t blow out a candle that’s on the other
side of a closed window. A fighter can’t use the Improved Trip feat to knock a
snake prone, because snakes are pretty much always prone. You get the idea.
Keep in mind that the world of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is magical, and
some things that just aren’t possible in the real world can happen in a fantasy
world. A human might be able to jump a 50-foot chasm . . . if he’s a high-level
monk with a useful magic item and the dice fall just right. Don’t use DM fiat to
shoot down an action that’s clearly within the spirit of the rules. 
Winging it
If common sense can override nonsensical rules, creativity and excitement
should win out over boring or pointless play. You are completely within your
rights to discard elements of an adventure that just aren’t working for you
and follow any inspiration that strikes. You’re also free to introduce any com-
plication, obstacle, or monster that seems appropriate in order to keep the
adventure buzzing along at the height of dramatic tension.
Some Dungeon Masters prefer to run a game with minimal preparation, and
they count on inspiration to strike at the appropriate moment. If the player
characters decide to explore a ruined keep that you figured they would pass
by, why not give them a dungeon one room at a time? It’s not like the players
can call you on it — they don’t know what might or might not have been in
the basement of a keep you just imagined a few minutes ago. All you have to
do is figure out what makes for a satisfying and exciting game session.
The key to successfully winging it is to give yourself a head start by building
up a reserve of Interesting Things — monsters you’d like to try out, map
sketches of rooms with interesting features or dangerous traps, villains that
can make a sudden appearance to liven up a boring game, or quirky NPCs for
the player characters to meet and interact with. You don’t have to arrange
148
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

these things in any particular order, but the technique of winging it works
best when you don’t have to stop and scrape together character stats or try
to draw dungeons on the fly. You might find it useful to check out D&D Web
sites, magazines such as Dragon or Dungeon, or even unused bits of source-
books you have on your shelf to build up your reserve of bits you might
improvise with later. If you stock up a folder in your DM binder with emer-
gency adventure material, you’ll never have to worry about the player char-
acters taking a wrong turn again.
Just as you can improvise on the course of an adventure, you can also impro-
vise within the context of an encounter or challenge. For example, your
adventure might note that the chuul in room 5 has 92 hit points (hp), but if
the chuul is clobbering the heck out of the player characters and you really
don’t want the chuul to wind up killing everybody, maybe it’s okay to have
the chuul suddenly keel over if one of the PCs gets it down to its last few hit
points. The players don’t know if the chuul had 92, or 91, or 83 hp. Just don’t
make it obvious when you have a monster take a dive to keep the adventure
moving.
DM cheating
Dice are fun, but terrible things can happen to the game if the dice fall badly
too many times in a row. Should you change the hit points or Armor Class of
a monster? Should you fudge a die roll now and again? In short, should you
cheat? 
Well, the DM really can’t cheat. In one sense, you’re in charge and what you
say goes. It’s certainly in your rights to sway the results one way or another
to keep the game moving or to keep players happy. Still, many DMs like to
follow the same rules that the players must abide by. That’s perfectly accept-
able, but it takes away some of the control you otherwise can exercise to
make a fun and exciting game.
You might be tempted to cheat to spare a player character from a grisly and
untimely death. We go into more detail about character death in the nearby
sidebar, “Should you let a character die?”
Whatever way you decide to come down on this issue, never let the players
know when you’re bending the rules. The players need to be able to trust your
die rolls so they know you’re not playing favorites. It’s important for them to
believe their characters are always in danger, and they’ll change their behav-
ior if they suspect that you always fudge the action in their favor. With no ele-
ment of risk, the reward will be less sweet. So, our advice is to play it straight,
fudge when appropriate, and keep the players guessing.
149
Chapter 10: Choosing Your Game Style

150
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 
Should you let a character die?
Sooner or later, it’s going to happen: One of your
monsters scores a critical hit, or a player fails a
crucial saving throw, and before you know it, a
player character meets an untimely end. Should
you really go ahead and tell the player that the
character is no more?
Killing off a character is a big deal. You’re
knocking one of the players out of the game for
a time, likely for the rest of the session. Either
he’s waiting around for the other PCs to take his
character back to someplace where a raise
dead or resurrection spell can bring the hapless
hero back, or he’s sitting at the table busily
making up a new character. Worse yet, a lot of
players just hate to get a character killed.
Nobody likes to lose, after all, and getting killed
is definitely a form of losing.
On the other hand, not killing a character also
poses problems. The risk of losing (getting a
character killed) makes the game exciting. If the
players come to realize that their characters
aren’t in any real danger because you won’t
allow a game result that results in character
death, what’s the point of playing out the adven-
ture? Success is assured, after all. There’s no
dramatic tension.
Our considered opinion is that the best games
include the risk of character death but that
characters should rarely if ever be killed in arbi-
trary, malicious, or meaningless ways. Although
a ferocious orc warpriest might be inclined 
to murder a helpless character with a coup 
de grace in “real life,” in your game you can
choose for the orc warpriest to stay focused on
the characters who are still fighting back.
Instead of wasting a round to finish off a
downed character, the monster keeps flailing
away at the other characters. If a character
fails a Balance check while crossing a chasm
on a narrow log, you might think about having
the character hit a ledge 20 or 30 feet down and
taking some damage instead of falling 1,000 feet
to certain death. You might even fudge a combat
result by announcing a missed attack, a failed
critical confirmation roll, or deliberately under-
stating damage dealt to a character, as long as
the players can’t see what your dice happen to
say. Just try not to make it obvious.
So when should you go ahead and let a char-
acter die in the game? We think there are only
three good answers:
 When the party is facing a dramatically
important battle
 When a character tries something that is
obviously highly risky and exceedingly stupid
 When the players have developed a sense
that their characters have nothing to fear in
your game
Even then, don’t be malicious about it. When the
characters are in one of those situations, you
can simply decide that you aren’t going to work
very hard to avoid killing a character if that’s
what the players’ actions and the dice decide.

T
he best DUNGEONS & DRAGONS games engage the players on several levels. 
A great game involves the players in a story that’s dramatic, compelling,
and masterfully paced. It creates a backdrop that includes fantastic land-
scapes, magical vistas, shadowy perils, and terrible monsters. A great game
presents challenges that encourage players to use their characters’ resources
wisely, make good decisions, and work together so that everybody wins.
The point of including a compelling story, inspiring setting, and challenging
gameplay in your D&D game is to make the game exciting. Exciting games
entertain the players, and it’s a lot easier to Dungeon Master for players who
are having fun than players who are bored or disinterested.
Maximizing Imagination
One of the unique characteristics of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is that a
lot of the game — most of it, really — takes place within the imagination of
the participants. Much like reading a good book, someone playing the D&D
game (or any roleplaying game, really) creates a continuous mental picture or
visualization of the action. You can literally play a D&D game with your eyes
closed, just opening them long enough every so often to roll some dice or jot
down a note or two. 

Narrating for all five senses
In most D&D games, you hit stretches where the Dungeon Master is narrating
events, creating scenery, or describing creatures or obstacles for the players.
Some people think of this sort of description as boxed text. That’s because
many published adventures set aside descriptive passages in boxes, italics,
or some other typographic method. The idea is that the DM can read these
passages to the players when the adventuring party reaches that point of the
adventure.
When you’re telling the players what’s going on around their characters,
don’t limit yourself to just what they see. Tell them what their characters are
perceiving with all their senses. Consider these two examples:
Example 1: You hiked up into the mountains to the abandoned dwarven
citadel. You stand in front of the old gates, which lie in ruin. Yellowed skulls
stuck on poles stand on either side of the path leading to the gate. They’re
marked with Orc runes of some kind.
Example 2: You hiked up into the mountains to the abandoned dwarven
citadel. You’re standing in front of the old gates, which lie in ruin. The air 
is cold and damp, and you’re chilled to the bone. Yellowed skulls stuck on
poles stand on either side of the path leading to the gate, each marked with
a rune in Orc. A thin haze of acrid smoke drifts out of the dark doorway, and
from deep in the mountain comes the distant ringing of hammers on steel.
The first example isn’t bad, but the second provides a lot more sensory infor-
mation. The characters hear hammers striking anvils. They smell smoke.
They feel cold and wet. Although the players may or may not be able to read-
ily imagine what the scene looks like, everybody knows what hammer strokes
sound like, everybody knows what a whiff of smoke smells like, and every-
body knows what it feels like to have cold water soaking their clothes. The
listeners naturally supply these details for themselves, making your descrip-
tion of the scene far more real and engaging than one that appeals only to the
players’ ability to visualize the scene. 
More evocative descriptions are great, but as a general rule of thumb, a DM
monologue of any sort — adventure background, boxed text, villainous
speeches, anything — shouldn’t be more than about a minute long. That
means keeping things you read to the players to 100 words or fewer. Give a
good description, and then get on to the action before the players get bored. 
Mixing the mundane and fantastic
One of the reasons that the imaginary world portrayed in the D&D game is
compelling is because players actively try to imagine what things look like,
152
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

sound like, and feel like around their characters. It’s part of the escapism of
the game, and it allows everyone to have fun roleplaying. Forming a clear
mental picture of what’s going on also helps players to figure out ways to
overcome challenges and defeat monsters. The easier you make it for the
players to immerse their imaginations in the game, the more compelling and
interesting the game becomes. 
Imagination is fabrication, and like any good fabrication, it should be
grounded in truth. The more that things from the normal, mundane, everyday
world are true in your game world, the easier it is for the players to imagine
themselves in the middle of the action. Consider this example:
Example 1: Your trail leads into the Gresgil Forest. Anda, the great blue sun,
is high in the sky. Ryth, the lesser red sun, hovers over the horizon, while
Gel, the yellow sun, will not rise for some hours yet. The giant purple tree-
ferns tower over your heads, weaving and sighing in the wind. The mewling
cries of flerrbits drift hauntingly through the air. Suddenly, goblin warriors
leap out of the shadows at you. It’s an ambush!
Chances are pretty good that the players are straining mental muscles just
trying to picture what the heck this place really looks like to their characters.
Is this normal to people presumably born in this world? Or are the characters
supposed to feel as weirded out as the players likely do? Are the giant purple
ferns dangerous? What in the world is a flerrbit, and does it eat people? When
the goblins jump out, the actual encounter is anticlimactic. “At last!” the play-
ers cry, “Something normal!”
Compare that with this example:
Example 2: Your trail leads into the Gresgil Forest. It’s early afternoon, but
underneath the trees the day seems gloomy, warm, and still. There isn’t
much undergrowth, but green curtains of moss hang from the branches of
the knurled oak trees. Distant birdsong drifts down from the canopy far
above. Suddenly, goblin warriors leap out of the shadows at you, filling the
air with war-cries! It’s an ambush!
Now you’ve given the players a setting that is accessible and believable. The
players might not envision exactly what you had in mind when you prepared
this encounter, but you can guess they’re going to get pretty close.
In general, if you assume that a lot of things in the game are the way they are
in the real world (or at least, the real world of an imagined Middle Ages), you
can spend more of your “imagination capital” on the exceptions. Save your
most fantastic touches for things you want the players to pay the most atten-
tion to. Add interesting details if you like (rain, sunshine, cold weather, hot
weather, and so on), and then get on to the part of the game you really want
the players to pay attention to — the goblin ambush.
153
Chapter 11: Creating Excitement at the Game Table

Suspending disbelief
The whole point of a roleplaying game is to pretend for a bit. Everybody
knows that people can’t just mumble a few words and whisk themselves a
hundred miles away in the blink of an eye, but for the purposes of the game,
we’re all willing to pretend that some people are powerful wizards. Wizards
can employ magic, and magic includes spells, such as teleport, which lets
them do exactly that. In other words, players choose not to apply their nat-
ural skepticism or disbelief to the game.
The key to maintaining the players’ suspension of disbelief is to meet their
expectations about their characters, the world, and the game. Anything that
doesn’t fit expectations and forces the players to reevaluate what they know
about the game — or the setting where the game takes place — drags the
players out of active visualization and lets their natural disbelief come rush-
ing back in. It’s like a giant Pause button on the game.
Failed expectations come in three basic flavors, as we describe in the follow-
ing subsections.
This world is a joke!
If you show the players that they’re supposed to treat your game like a joke,
that’s what they’re going to do. Sometimes that can be fun, but most D&D
games work better if you play the world seriously, and let the players find the
humor for themselves. One of the most common tip-offs that your game isn’t
serious is a bad name. Names like Lord Binky, Tim the Wizard, or Castle
Stupenderous tell the players “don’t take this world seriously, and don’t try
to get invested in the game — it won’t be worth your effort.”
Capricious rules
The rules of the D&D game set a lot of boundaries on what exactly characters
can and can’t do. Arbitrarily changing the rules on the players is a sure way
to jar them out of their suspension of disbelief, especially if doing so creates
a negative result in the game. 
For example, the fly spell lets a character fly — and a strong character can
carry anything aloft he normally could carry while walking, so he can pick up
a buddy and fly him across a chasm. If you suddenly inform the players,
“Sorry, but the fly spell just doesn’t work if you try to carry somebody else,”
you’re asking for trouble. Despite the fact that you’d like to preserve that
chasm as an obstacle in your game, nothing in the spell description implies
that you can’t carry your buddies if you’re strong enough. In fact, you’re
inviting the players to go look at the description of the spell and the rules for
carrying loads. Whatever you were trying to accomplish in the game grinds
to a halt as the players try to figure out what works and what doesn’t work in
your particular version of D&D. 
154
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Illogical consequences
Players expect that their actions in the world result in logical consequences.
If the characters defend an elven village against a dragon’s attack, the players
expect gratitude from the elves. If a villain gets pushed off a cliff, the players
expect that the bad guy falls and gets hurt or killed. If the characters pur-
chase a scroll with the passwall spell to break into a vault where they know
treasure is hidden, they expect to find the treasure when they finally get in —
or at least find a reason as to why the treasure isn’t there anymore.
DMs sometimes fall into the illogical consequences trap by sticking too
closely to the script. If the person who designed the adventure had no idea
that the characters might figure out a way to get into the vault right at the
beginning, it’s tempting to just say “you can’t get in,” or “the treasure isn’t
here.” But a better answer is reward the players’ ingenuity and resourceful-
ness with the success they earned, even if that “breaks” the adventure and
causes you to do some fast thinking. 
Setting the mood
What do you do if you’re going to watch a scary movie? You turn down the
lights. Similarly, you might find that you can help the players get in the right
frame of mind for the game by using lighting, backdrops, and background
music to create the right atmosphere.
Lighting
If you want to convey an atmosphere of mystery, fear, and suspense, consider
keeping the lights low around the gaming table. Don’t make it so dark that the
players can’t see what’s written on their character sheets or read the results
of their die rolls, but other than that, darker is usually better. 
Music
Music is a pretty powerful tool for imagination, especially if it’s appropriate
for the current tempo of your game. Music is naturally a matter of taste, but
whatever you and your friends prefer, you want to make sure it isn’t too loud —
you don’t need to spend the whole game session trying to shout over your
own background music.
The following genres of music make good background or mood music for
D&D games:
 Movie soundtracks: Most soundtracks don’t have much singing that
might distract your listeners with lyrics, and they’re created specifically
for the purpose of evoking emotion from the listener at dramatically
155
Chapter 11: Creating Excitement at the Game Table

appropriate moments. Horror, fantasy, and science fiction movie sound-
tracks usually fit the mood and work best for D&D adventures.
 Game soundtracks: A small number of game soundtracks are available.
They have the virtue of being created specifically for the purpose of pro-
viding background music for D&D games or other roleplaying games, but
your mileage may vary.
 Classical music, classic rock, or heavy metal: These types of music can
work for the game if you find the right piece or the right artist and
album. But watch out for music that contains lyrics.
Don’t be afraid to save background music for specific game events, especially
combat encounters. If you’ve got a pounding, heroic battle-theme playing
when you’d really rather have an atmosphere of lurking dread, your music is
getting in the way of imagination. Above all, don’t get so caught up in fiddling
with the music that your attention is on the stereo instead of the players. If
you’re going to use background music, cue it up on the stereo before the
players arrive so that all you have to do is push a button to get the selection
you’re after.
Showing, not telling
One of the most powerful tools in the Dungeon Master’s arsenal is the ability
to show the players what’s going on, instead of just telling them how the action
unfolds. You could take 10 minutes to describe a dungeon chamber in exacting
detail . . . or you could simply draw a map that shows the players exactly how
the room is laid out and where the monsters are standing. Gimmicks such as
maps, miniatures, illustrations, and handouts give you the ability to show the
players exactly what you’re talking about. They make the task of visualizing
what’s going on a snap for even the most unimaginative players.
Maps
Say that one of the rooms in a dungeon you’ve created is an evil shrine. If the
player characters approach the altar in the center of the shrine, mummies
lurking in sarcophagi along the walls will burst out and attack. To describe
the room in careful detail, you might have to say something like this:
The room beyond the door seems to be a shrine of some sort. A big altar of
black stone stands at the far end of the room, about 40 feet from the door.
You can see two other exits: a passage that leads off into darkness in the
middle of the wall on your left, and an iron-plated door just to the right of
the doorway you’re standing in. The shrine is about 30 feet wide, and the
ceiling is quite high, almost 20 feet tall. Four big stone sarcophagi line the
walls; two to the north, two to the south. They’re carved in the image of
ancient warriors in armor. Above the altar hangs a twisted skeleton of
bronzed bones — the bones of a dragon, it seems. Purple tiles cover the
156
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

floor in a semicircle extending about 10 feet from the altar, and three rows
of low stone benches run the width of the room, with narrow walkways on
the outer edges.
Hopefully not every room in your dungeon gets this kind of over-precise
boxed text. However, there is not much here that the players won’t need to
know sooner or later. They need to know what features in the room might
pose a threat (the skeleton, sarcophagi, and odd purple-tiled floor), and they
need to know what in the room might invite a closer look (the altar). But how
many people could sort out a good mental image of the room and its contents
based solely on that verbal description? Which details would some listeners
just miss entirely? Which details would they visualize incorrectly?
Now, imagine that instead of reading that boxed text to the players, you draw
a map for them. Figure 11-1 shows what the room looks like.
If you show the players the map while describing the room, you might say
something like this instead:
The room beyond the door seems to be a shrine of some sort. A big altar of
black stone stands at the far end of the room. You can see two other exits: a
passage that leads off into darkness here (point to your map), and an iron-
plated door here (point again). The ceiling is quite high, almost 20 feet
above you. Four big stone sarcophagi line the walls, each carved in the
Figure 11-1:
A map of the
shrine room.
157
Chapter 11: Creating Excitement at the Game Table

image of an ancient warrior in armor. Above the altar hangs a twisted skele-
ton of bronzed bones — the bones of a dragon, it seems. Purple tiles cover
the floor in a semicircle in front of the altar, and three rows of low stone
benches run the width of the room.
As you can see, the second description is much like the first — but with a
visual diagram of the room’s layout in front of the players, most of the room’s
details are crystal clear. You have to explain this room only one time, instead
of answering question after question about what’s where.
Maps you create for the players fall into two categories: map sketches and
tactical maps.
Map sketches
When all you want to do is clarify the description of a room by providing a
diagram of what you’re describing, a map sketch is all you need. A map
sketch is simply a way to convey information to the players in an efficient
format. Figure 11-1 at the beginning of this section is an example of a map
sketch. You can’t set it on the table and use it as a board for your miniatures,
because your miniatures are too big. But the map sketch shows players
exactly where each feature in the room is located, and the map can certainly
serve as a template or guide you can follow for drawing a tactical map of the
same room.
Graph paper is the easiest way to present a map sketch to the players.
However, it is a sketch — you don’t need to be perfect. Any information you
provide will be an improvement over verbal description alone.
Tactical maps
A tactical map is a very large map you create that serves as a board for
everyone to play out a combat encounter on. A tactical map uses a scale of 1
inch = 5 feet. Each square on the map is therefore a 5-foot square. Miniatures
(if you use them in the game) are in the same scale as your map, so you can
actually set your miniatures on the tactical map to show exactly where each
character or monster is during each round of the fight.
Several handy game products are available for use in creating tactical maps.
Many people use a battle map — a vinyl mat covered in a 1-inch square grid. 
You can draw rooms on the battle map by using wet-erase markers, like those
you would use with an overhead projector. A grease pencil and a thin sheet of
Plexiglas over a paper map with 1-inch squares works just as well. An interesting
medium for tactical maps that’s out there right now is the puzzle-piece Tactile —
a hard plastic map section of 1-inch squares. You can use dry-erase markers on
these, and you can arrange them in different configurations if you need to scroll
the battlefield (that is, shift the map to cover more area) during a running fight.
Ready-to-use battle maps complete with fully rendered locations are available in
D&D Fantastic Locations products, as well as in some D&D Miniatures Game
products. You can find these items at your local game store or online.

Mapping Tips
Maps drawn for the D&D game often make use
of common scales, symbols, and conventions.
The following figures show a set of symbols you
are likely to see on maps in published adven-
tures. You might as well use symbols like these
when you draw your own maps for the players.
(continued)

160
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 
(continued)
Most game maps drawn on graph paper use a
scale of 1 square = 5 feet or 1 square = 10 feet.
You can quickly create tactical maps (each 1-
inch square is 5 feet across) based on these
dungeon map sketches if you use one of these
standard scales. Maps of bigger areas, such as
towns or kingdoms, use much larger scales, as
you might expect, such as 1 square or 1 inch = 5
miles or more.

Miniatures
If you find it useful to create tactical maps for the players, you should
strongly consider using miniatures in the game. Although you can mark the
locations of monsters and characters by drawing on the map or using stand-
in tokens (glass beads, unused dice, or candies), a good selection of minia-
tures makes your combat representation into something concrete and
tangible instead of an abstraction.
Miniatures used to be a rather expensive and time-consuming adjunct to the
roleplaying hobby, but in recent years, several companies have started to
produce prepainted, plastic miniatures that really aren’t that expensive and
eliminate the work of building and painting them. Official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
miniatures are the best of these for a D&D game because they feature all the
official D&D monsters and character classes, but you might find that pieces
from your favorite board game or other miniatures work just as well in the game.
Illustrations
A picture is worth a thousand words, or so they say. Instead of trying to
describe a big, complicated room with lots of important details through sev-
eral paragraphs of boxed text, seek out a picture that might do the job.
A few published adventures are designed with illustration booklets that are
keyed to the adventure. Even if the adventure doesn’t have any illustrations
161
Chapter 11: Creating Excitement at the Game Table
In addition to using symbols that the players can
easily understand and a convenient scale, you
should also try to create maps that are logical
and aesthetically pleasing. When you’re draw-
ing a map for the players, ask yourself the fol-
lowing questions:
 Is this the right size? If your dungeon is
inhabited by big creatures such as ogres or
giants, you should make most of your hall-
ways 10 feet or 15 feet wide, and rooms
should be big. If you’re setting up an
encounter with a highly mobile monster
(something that flies, for example), give it a
room big enough to move around in. Don’t
forget high ceilings, if appropriate.
 Does the room have interesting contents? A
room with four walls, a door, and nothing
else is boring. Every room should have
accoutrements and furnishings appropriate
to its function. Libraries should have book-
shelves. Alchemists’ laboratories should
have worktables and kilns. Prisons have
shackles attached to the walls, and barracks
have bunks, weapon racks, and footlockers.
Shrines should have altars and statues. 
 Is the room too symmetrical? A dungeon full
of nothing but square rooms is boring.
Include corners, alcoves, or L-shapes.
Include columns or pillars. Add details to the
flooring, such as raised or sunken areas
with steps. 
Feel free to pillage maps from any published
adventures you can find. A number of gaming-
related Web sites also include maps that you
can download and print out for use in your own
game.

that are specifically designed to be shown to the players, most published
adventures include a small number of illustrations. These pictures can often
show what’s going on far better than you could ever explain it through verbal
description alone. Don’t be afraid to show the players any illustration in a
published adventure. (You might want to cover up the rest of the page with a
blank piece of paper if you don’t want the players to read whatever else is on
the same page.)
If you prefer to create your own adventures, keep an eye out for interesting
illustrations or artwork that you can show the players during the game. Good
places to look for D&D-themed artwork include the following:
 Check the Wizards of the Coast Web site (www.wizards.com). Art from
current D&D products is frequently posted in preview galleries.
 If you’re handy with a sketchbook, try creating your own illustrations. It
doesn’t have to be that good. Even a very rough and simple sketch of
what the characters see when they look into a room can be a tremen-
dous help for visualizing what’s where. 
 Calendars or book covers from fantasy artists are often appropriate,
even if they aren’t from D&D game products.
 Capture screen shots from your favorite computer game and print them
out to show to the players. 
 The real world includes plenty of striking scenery; photographs snipped
or copied from encyclopedias, travel magazines, or old issues of
National Geographic can stand in for many fantasy landscapes.
Mountains, forests, jungles, deserts, waterfalls, weird rock formations,
old castles, or quaint European towns are all fair game.
Handouts
Any time the player characters find something written down — a secret mes-
sage from an evil spy, an old wizard’s riddle, a treasure map, or a mysterious
code — think about presenting that information as a handout. Instead of
telling the players what the secret message says, you can write the letter
exactly as your villain would have done and simply give it to the players to
read for themselves. Let the players determine for themselves what’s impor-
tant or unimportant in the message.
Like a good illustration, a handout is an excellent DM tool because it gives
you the chance to show the players exactly what their characters are seeing.
There’s no possibility for misunderstanding.
If you want to give your handouts the appearance of authenticity, try this:
Lightly blot some paper with tea or coffee, and then let it dry. The coffee or
tea will stain the paper yellowish and make it a little crinkly, so it will look a
little like old parchment. Or you can get some parchment paper and use that
for even more of an authentic feel.
162
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Here’s an example of a handout. The setup for this handout is that the char-
acters have defeated a party of hobgoblin slavers that was hired by the
leader of an evil cult to abduct the local lord’s son. The goal of this handout
(shown in Figure 11-2) is to give the players information they can use to find
the secret temple of the evil cultists after they save the young noble from his
hobgoblin captors.
By giving this handout to the players after their characters defeat the hob-
goblins of Xardagas’s band, you provide the players with an obvious next
step in their adventure — the watchtower in Wyvernfang Pass. Instead of
telling the players what they ought to do, you’ve shown them.
Pacing the Game
Whether you’re engaged in a scene that the players are visualizing entirely in
their minds or one that they’re experiencing in a more tactile, concrete pre-
sentation, we recommend actively managing the game’s dramatic tension. In
short, you don’t want things to get boring. 
The rules of dramatic tension are simple: 
 Start small and work up to a climax.
 Don’t waste time on challenges or scenes that don’t threaten the charac-
ters or advance the plot in some way.
 Always leave ’em wanting more.
Xardagas:
As we discussed in our previous correspondence, I agree to pay you 500 pieces of 
gold for the capture of Reddan Oreskil, son of Lord Tereth Oreskil of 
Griffonford. I want him alive and unharmed, but do as you will with any others 
you find in his house. When you succeed in capturing him, bring him to the ruined 
watchtower in Wyvernfang Pass. My agents will meet you there. You will know 
them by the sign of the Black Gauntlet. Here is the first 100 gold pieces for 
your services; my agents will pay you the rest when you bring Reddan Oreskil to 
Wyvernfang Pass.

Chapter 11: Creating Excitement at the Game Table

Cliffhangers
The oldest technique for dramatic tension in the book is the cliffhanger.
Instead of playing out each game session to its absolute conclusion, look for
an opportunity to stop a little short. If you do it right, the players will be posi-
tively chomping at the bit to find out what happens next. Instead of reaching
a convenient stopping place and staying there, take the player characters
right up into the beginning of the next big danger — and then call it a night.
Let the players spend the rest of the week wondering how in the heck their
characters are going to get out of whatever fix you dropped them in when
you ended the last D&D session.
The cut-away scene
Imagine that your D&D game is a movie, and you’re the director. You’re shoot-
ing a scene where Lidda the Rogue is exploring a secret passage in an evil
shrine, while her friends are waiting behind her. Suddenly, fiendish dire rats
set on Lidda in the dark passageway, while fanatical temple guards find her
friends and attack. How would you shoot the scene? You could just run the
combat one round at a time, letting the characters take their turns in order
regardless of whether they’re in the same fight. Alternatively, you might use
the cut-away scene technique: You could play through several rounds of one
fight scene, and then cut away to the other scene and catch up by playing
several rounds of that one. Your “camera” follows Lidda for a time as she
explores the passage and encounters the dire rats, and then it jumps back to
the rest of the characters when the temple guards burst into the room, and
then jumps back to Lidda after the first round or two of the temple guard
fight, just in time to see how she’s doing against the dire rats.
The cut-away scene works best when the player characters are divided. They
might be only a few feet away in another room, or they might be engaged in
completely different adventures that are only loosely linked to each other.
Spend 5 to 10 minutes dealing with one discrete storyline in your adventure,
then put that action on hold (usually at a dramatically appropriate moment,
using the cliffhanger technique) while you switch over to DM one of the other
players through whatever his or her character is doing, and then switch away
again when you’re ready.
Cut-away scenes are incredibly effective in both books and movies — just as
soon as something reaches a breaking point, the action jumps away to
another character and follows him or her for a time. At the gaming table,
keep your cut-away scenes short. Remember, while you’re giving attention to
one character or group of characters, other players at the table are sitting
around doing nothing except watching and listening. Try to give each player
at the table about the same amount of your time and energy.
164
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Varying your delivery
Just as you control when game sessions and encounters start and stop, you
also control the pace and style of the narration, because you’re the narrator.
It’s useful to create contrast between scenes that are intended to provide
action and scenes that are intended to provide anticipation leading to 
the action.
Action scenes
Action scenes include any fight in the game, as well as encounters with
deadly traps, formidable obstacles, or verbal confrontations with NPCs who
are trying to obstruct the player characters in some way. 
Pick up the pace and allow yourself to show more animation and excitement
when you’re presenting a combat scene or deadly challenge. After all, this
should be an exciting moment in the game. What do people do when they’re
trying to say something they’re excited about? They talk faster. They talk
louder. They gesture more, they might even get up and move around or liter-
ally bounce in agitation. They pour physical and emotional energy into what
they’re saying. If you inject this excitement into your narration of the game,
the players will pick up on it, and they’ll be riveted to everything you say or
do. Don’t be afraid to jump to your feet, gesture expansively, and talk loudly
and fast when you want to ramp up the energy level at the table.
Anticipation scenes
If the player characters aren’t in an action scene, they should be in a scene
that is building anticipation toward the next action scene to come. Exploring
a fearsome dungeon, piecing together a riddle or puzzle with troubling impli-
cations, or planning the defeat of a dangerous foe are all encounters or
scenes designed to build anticipation. To create an atmosphere of brooding
menace, use a lower tone of voice and avoid excitable movement such as
pacing or pronounced gestures. Take your time with your narration, indulge
in a little extra description, and see whether you can’t get the players leaning
forward in their chairs to see what happens next. That makes it all the more
startling when you jump up and announce the sudden attack of some horri-
ble monster.
Getting to the fun fast
Many D&D adventures contain a serious flaw: In one way or another, they
make the players search for the fun. If the players can’t figure out what their
characters are supposed to be doing or just hit what seems to be a dead end,
they get frustrated.
165
Chapter 11: Creating Excitement at the Game Table

Obstacles that sometimes get in the way of finding the fun include:
 They didn’t find the secret room: If the characters have to find a well-
hidden secret door in your dungeon in order to keep playing, you might
be just hiding the fun. Make sure that plenty of clues exist elsewhere in
the dungeon to suggest how secret places might be found.
 They didn’t talk to the right guy: If the characters have a whole town
full of people to interview in order to locate the one NPC who can tell
them what they need to do next, you’re hiding the fun for everybody
except the character actors. When you design your adventure, make
sure that multiple NPCs possess clues that can point the characters in
the right direction. Some clues might be better than others, but at least
the odds of figuring out some place to go next are pretty good.
 They didn’t solve the puzzle: Sometimes you might stump the charac-
ters with a riddle or physical puzzle. If they need to solve the puzzle of
aligning the levers in the room the right way to open the otherwise
impassable door and just can’t do it, you stop the adventure dead. Make
sure that clues are available if the players need the help.
 They didn’t bring the right magic: Maybe the characters needed to
have access to a specific spell, scroll, or potion (say, water breathing or
fly) to get past an obstacle. Provide clues ahead of time that suggest to
the players what preparations they’ll need to succeed, or make sure that
a detour route is available. The detour can be difficult and dangerous, but
that will just reward those characters who prepared for the challenge.
Making the players use their brains is perfectly okay. Every now and then, the
players should hit challenges or obstacles that make them think hard about
what to do next. You just want to make sure that they will be able to come up
with an answer when they have to stop and figure things out.

Growing Your Game
In This Chapter
 Building a world for your D&D game
 Increasing character creation options in your game
 Creating your own rules
 Involving the players in the campaign
M
ore than any other hobby you can name, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game
inspires creativity. Power gamers seek out innovative ways to develop
their characters through the clever use of new magic items, spells, and tac-
tics. Roleplayers gradually accumulate a library of stories about their charac-
ters’ backgrounds, personalities, and accomplishments. Dungeon Masters
constantly search for new adventure material to throw in front of the players,
and many also take the time to create highly detailed settings for their games,
complete with iconic villains, political maneuvering, living history, and ever-
growing storylines for the players to interact with. There’s really nothing else
like it.
In this chapter, we take a look at ways to expand the scope and creativity of
your regular D&D game. Growing your game keeps it fresh, interesting, and
vital for the players. 
Setting Your Game in a World
The first big questions to ask when you’re thinking about trying to expand
the scope of your game are, “Is there a world outside the adventure my play-
ers are currently involved in? Can they explore it? What will I tell them if they
do?” In other words, does anything important happen to the player charac-
ters when they aren’t in a dungeon?
Setting your D&D game in a living, changing game world is an excellent way
to grow your game. All of a sudden, you’ve got room for virtually endless cre-
ativity. If you’re creative, energetic, and willing to pour a lot of time into your

hobby, there is virtually no limit to the amount of world-building you can do.
We’ve seen Dungeon Masters who have built worlds of astounding scope and
detail, with dozens of pages of maps, hundreds of NPCs, and thousands of
words of history, culture, and arcane lore. 
If you don’t feel you have the time, energy, or native creativity to build your
own game world, consider using a world somebody else has built for you. You
can adapt the setting of almost any fantasy fiction to your D&D game with a
little work. Or you can pick up an official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game setting such
as FORGOTTEN REALMS or EBERRON. If the players are already fans of the fantasy
story or setting you select to build the campaign around, you’ve got a great
head start in getting them involved and interested in your game.
You can always settle on an approach that combines both of these elements.
For example, you might use an established setting like the FORGOTTEN REALMS,
but drop in any dungeons, towns, characters, or monsters you create into the
game setting whenever it’s convenient for you. It’s your game, after all. 
If you find it a little daunting to wrestle with a whole planet when you begin
your D&D game, think about starting with a microcosm instead of a macro-
cosm. Begin your campaign with the dungeon and a simple base town, and
grow your game outward only when the player characters need to venture
into some new domain or locate some new resource. Why bother to fill pages
and pages with notes about the interesting folk of the Isles Beneath the Dawn
when the player characters haven’t ever gone more than 10 miles from the
town they started in? Draw maps of far places and write descriptions of
exotic towns and people whenever you like, but you don’t have to do either
until the player characters are ready to venture into that particular corner of
your game world. 
We take a longer look at building your own campaign in Part IV of this book.
Adding New Rules Elements
Most DUNGEONS & DRAGONS games begin with about 1,000 pages of rules: the
Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. Although you
can create a bewildering variety of characters and adventures with the mater-
ial in these three core rulebooks, you will find that an immense amount of
additional game material is available if you want more choices. For example,
there are 11 base character classes in the Player’s Handbook — but other D&D
sourcebooks provide dozens more, including classes such as the favored soul,
hexblade, marshal, ninja, psion, psychic warrior, samurai, scout, soulknife,
swashbuckler, warlock, and warmage, just to name a few. Some veteran play-
ers feel like they’ve “been there and done that” with the 11 character classes
from the Player’s Handbook, but trying out one of these new base classes gives
jaded players a chance to do something in the game they haven’t done before.
168
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Other players find that additional character-building options allow them to
get far more specific with a particular character concept. For example, a
player who’s a big Alexandre Dumas fan might want to build a Musketeer-
like character — dashing, debonair, quick and deadly with a blade. You can
build a character like this from the rogue and fighter classes in the Player’s
Handbook, but the swashbuckler class (from the Complete Warrior sourcebook)
is an even better starting point for the would-be Musketeer. The more options
you allow into your game, the more likely it is that the players can find the exact
rules implementation necessary to create the characters they’ve got in mind.
Adding rules options to please the players is fine, but you will find that most
DMs introduce new rules elements for their own benefits on a very regular
basis. Naturally, you might want to create unique and memorable villains who
make use of the same sort of extra options that are available to player char-
acters. You will also find that the game benefits from a regular infusion of new
monsters and new magic items.
Making new options available
When you decide to make new character options and choices available, you
immediately face the choice of whether to allow the players to make use of
these options retroactively, or instead require the players to wait until their
characters have the opportunity to acquire these abilities in the normal
course of advancement.
For example, say you buy a sourcebook that has a number of new feats in it.
The player characters in your game are all 7th level. If you require the players
to wait until their characters can normally choose new feats, most of the
169
Chapter 12: Growing Your Game
Where can I find all this stuff?
If you like a game with a broader selection of
character options, monsters, magic treasure,
and everything else, you’re in luck — so do a
lot of other DMs. You can find all sorts of addi-
tional D&D material in a number of places.
Wizards of the Coast, Inc., publishes a variety
of official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS sourcebooks
and supplements, many of which include all
sorts of new material you might want to incor-
porate in your game. A number of other game
publishers publish D&D material through an
open source agreement with Wizards of the
Coast. Dragon Magazine, from Paizo Publishing,
is an excellent source of new material. You can
find a tremendous amount of material on vari-
ous Web sites, from the Wizards of the Coast
site (www.wizards.com) to any number of
fan-created Web sites. Finally, you can create
brand new monsters, classes, or spells for
yourself.
We take a longer look at sources for D&D mate-
rial in Chapter 13.

characters in your game must wait two levels before they can explore the
new options you’ve introduced, because most character classes gain feats at
6th level and 9th level.
If you choose to allow your characters to respec (redo their character statis-
tics, changing selections they made at lower levels) to take advantage of the
new options, the feats become available immediately. By allowing the player
characters to revisit the feat choices they made at 6th level, 3rd level, or even
earlier in their careers, you let them make better decisions in light of the new
options that are available — but, of course, you’re retconning your game.
Retcon stands for retroactive continuity, which is a fancy way of saying that
you’re telling the players to pretend that something about their characters or
your game was always the way it is now, instead of sweating the details of how
and why things changed.
Examining new rules elements
Not all rules elements are born equal. Some are very easy to implement in your
game and have a relatively limited effect. Others might require you to really
bone up on a complex new aspect of the game and will change everything you
do at the game table. The following subsections provide a quick look at the
types of rules elements you might choose to include in your game, in ascend-
ing order of difficulty. 
Monsters and magic items
Veteran D&D players have a pretty good idea of what’s in the Monster Manual.
They might not remember off the top of their heads how many Hit Dice a troll
has, but they do know that they have to deal out fire or acid damage to finish
off the regenerating monster. Using a monster that no player in the party has
ever fought before makes jaded players sit up and take note because they
realize that they don’t know how much danger their characters are in. All of
a sudden, it’s like they’re neophytes again, and they have to figure out the
best way to beat the monster with no out-of-character game mastery to help
them along.
Adding a new monster to the game is about the easiest new thing you could
possibly add. It’s entirely in your control whether the players ever encounter
the creature. If the monster proves troublesome (it isn’t clear how its special
abilities work, it seems too weak, or it seems too deadly), you never have to
include it again — just make a point of not using it in any more encounters.
An easy way to add a new monster to an adventure is to pick up a DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS Miniatures Game booster pack. Chances are that you’ll find a new
monster (or a monster that you’ve rarely used before), along with its game
statistics, that you can use on the spot in your adventure. This way, it’s a sur-
prise for you and the players.
170
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

New magic items are similar to monsters in that most players expect the DM
to control when or whether they appear in the game. Players don’t have a
sense of entitlement toward a magic item their characters haven’t found yet.
However, a magic item is harder to take out of your game if it proves to be a
problem. Magic items that have charges eventually run out, of course, but
permanent magic items hang around forever — particularly if players have
discovered that they’re useful. 
Feats and prestige classes
Making new feats or prestige classes available in your game doesn’t provide
you with many new DMing possibilities, but it does provide players with the
ability to explore new character abilities and archetypes. In general, these
options help players to specialize their characters and develop signature
combat tactics, combos, spells, or strategies for besting the monsters. There
are a lot of dwarf fighters out there in the D&D world, but how many of them
have levels in the dwarven defender prestige class and can use the Whirlwind
Attack feat with the two-bladed sword?
When you introduce these new options into your game, the players can’t
instantly take advantage of them. They have to wait until their characters
reach a new experience level to consider adding a prestige class, and they
might actually require a couple levels to meet the requirements for getting
into the prestige class. Similarly, players can’t take advantage of any new
feats you add to the game until their characters have the opportunity to
select new feats, which might require a wait of a level or two. 
Unlike monsters or magic items, you don’t control these rules elements after
you introduce them into your game — it’s up to the players to decide whether
they want to take advantage of them when they advance their characters over
time. Conversely, there is no elegant way to remove these elements from your
game after you make them available. If you find that a certain prestige class or
feat is causing trouble in your game, you can’t just stop including it, because
it’s now in the players’ hands. You have to retcon their characters to get rid of
the problem, and that usually isn’t very much fun.
Spells
When you make a new spell available in your game, spellcasting characters
gain access to that spell almost instantly. A new cleric or druid spell is avail-
able the very next time the character prepares spells. A new wizard spell can
probably be bought and added to the character’s spellbook the next time the
adventurers happen to pass through a big town. In other words, the players
can put new spells into play more quickly than almost any other rules ele-
ment you add to your game.
171
Chapter 12: Growing Your Game

The biggest challenge of introducing a new spell is that each new spell you add
to your game adds to the number of options that must be considered when a
player running a spellcasting character chooses spells. This isn’t so bad for the
sorcerer, who makes decisions about which spells to learn only when he or she
gains a level, but for the cleric or wizard it’s adding to a significant preparation
burden. Choosing from a list of 50 1st-level spells requires more player commit-
ment and discernment than choosing from a list half that size. 
That said, new spells are definitely cool. Players who have become familiar
with the Player’s Handbook will almost always find a spell slot or two for
interesting new spells. And, should a new spell prove to be detrimental to
your game, it’s easier to remove something from a character’s spell list than
it is to take back a prestige class level or rework a set of feat choices.
Character classes and races
Just like feats, prestige classes, and spells, new character classes and races
are primarily player options. These options tend to sit at the slow end of the
“speed of introduction” scale. You aren’t likely to see much use of new char-
acter races unless a new player joins your group or an old player gets his or
her character killed and decides to try something else. By far the best oppor-
tunity to introduce a new character race is when the players are first making
up their characters for a brand-new game.
172
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

New classes are theoretically easier to introduce during a continuing cam-
paign because any character might choose to add a new class the next time
he or she gains a level (called multiclassing), but in practice few classes are
instantly attractive to characters who are already well along the road of their
original class. This is especially true of spellcasters — a wizard is not likely to
give up the next level of spellcasting progression in order to become a 1st-
level anything.
Additional character classes and races do provide a staggering wealth of new
options for adventuresome players to try out. Consider this example: Say you
decide to add the scout character class from Complete Adventurer to your
game. You haven’t added just one new character type — you’ve added
dozens, because the existence of the scout invites an experienced player to
try building a human scout, a half-orc scout, an elf scout, a dwarf scout, a
scout who maximizes stealth skills, a scout who uses the Spring Attack feat
tree, and so on.
Cap systems
The term cap system refers to a whole rules set that adds a new dimension to
the game, such as a new system of magic or style of play. Most cap systems
include new character-building options, such as races, classes, or feats; new
spells or powers; and monsters and adventure material that make use of the
new rules. Official cap systems for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game include 
 Psionics (mental powers), as described in Expanded Psionics Handbook
and Complete Psionics
 Incarnum (soul energy), as described in Magic of Incarnum
 New magic systems, such as shadow magic and pact magic, as described
in Tome of Magic
 Super-high-level play, as described in Epic Level Handbook
Introducing a cap system to your game gives the players a ton of new options
to explore. However, not every player at the table needs to make use of each
subsystem of the new rules. For example, if you’re using the psionic rules
from Expanded Psionics Handbook, one player at your table might want to
choose the maenad character race, another player might decide to create a
character with the psion character class, and another player might be happy
to choose one or two of the psionic feats, but otherwise stick with the dwarf
fighter he always likes to play.
A cap system can be challenging to incorporate in your game because it
imposes a significant learning curve on you as the DM. When you add a
discrete component such as a character race or class that operates by the
normal rules of the D&D game, you have to evaluate only the specific compo-
nent you’re adding. Adding a cap system means that you need to do some
homework and familiarize yourself with the way the system works.
173
Chapter 12: Growing Your Game

The challenge increases significantly with each cap system you allow into
your game. Each new system increases character options exponentially,
because players can build characters by using core rules and other cap sys-
tems and then cherry-pick specific abilities from the new book. 
If you’re just beginning as a DM, it’s probably best to limit yourself to learning
one cap system at a time.
Creating House Rules
The rules set for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is very large. It’s almost
inevitable that sooner or later you will find something in the game that you
don’t like. Some DMs grit their teeth but stick to the book anyway, but other
DMs decide to take matters into their own hands and create a house rule — a
modification to the core rules for their own games. Do you think rangers and
bards aren’t very tough characters? Create a house rule to rework their spell
progression charts and give them more spells at earlier levels. Don’t like the
fact that clerics can prepare only one domain spell per spell level? Create a
house rule that says clerics can prepare as many castings of their domain
spells as they like.
When you find yourself wishing the rules worked a different way and thinking
about how you’d fix them if it were up to you, keep these general guidelines
in mind:
 Don’t create a house rule that applies to only one character at the table.
If you find yourself legislating general game rules to solve problems that
one character causes, you might be dealing with a broken character, not
a game state in need of correction. (We discuss broken characters in
Chapter 9.)
 Before creating a house rule, take some time to review what’s in the rule-
book pertaining to the situation you want to fix. It’s always possible that
you haven’t been playing the rules right.
 Solicit player feedback about your proposed house rule. Find out
whether the players can drive oxcarts through the gaping holes in the
rule before you actually try to enforce it in play.
 Keep a good record of your house rules and make sure the players
know what they are and why you have them in play. Remember to be
consistent!
One of the outstanding features of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is that
you’re free to make it into the game you want to play. Don’t be afraid to dis-
card elements that cut into your fun and add elements that make you hap-
pier, as long as you’re confident that the players feel the same way about the
rules you want to change.

Getting Players Involved in the Game
New places to explore and new character options are all very good, but the
single best way to grow your D&D game is to increase the players’ investment
in the continuing success of the game. If you can succeed in getting the players
to care about your game, they’ll drive your campaign’s storyline, seek out new
rules options, and build better, more interesting characters for the game — and
that in turn will push you to present adventures and challenges that they’re
interested in tackling. You motivate the players; the players motivate you.
Everybody wins!
Players are most likely to become deeply invested in games where their char-
acters continue from week to week, so if you want to get them involved and
keep them involved, you need to create a campaign (see Chapter 8). The fol-
lowing sections share tricks and techniques for getting players wrapped up in
a campaign — and keeping them that way.
Crafting good backgrounds
The first step in encouraging players to care about your game is to encourage
them to care about their characters. Challenge the players to create interesting
175
Chapter 12: Growing Your Game
Common house rules
If you’re wondering what sort of rules other
Dungeon Masters choose to adjust for their
games, here are a couple of the more common
ones:
 Reduced experience: Some DMs feel that
the XP table advances characters faster
than they’d like. To slow down character
advancement, a DM might institute a house
rule that states that all encounters are now
worth 50 percent of the experience points
the rules say to award.
 No level loss for the raise dead spell:
Losing a level when a character comes
back from the dead really hurts. Some DMs
choose not to apply this penalty.
 Action points: The EBERRON world intro-
duces the idea of action points, a special
resource that players can use to help out
die rolls when things look bad. Some DMs
who aren’t running EBERRON games like the
idea enough to incorporate it in their own
D&D games.
 Gestalt characters: This optional rule was
introduced in the sourcebook Unearthed
Arcana. It essentially allows a single char-
acter to combine the class abilities of two
character classes at every level. DMs who
have only a couple players for their games
find it useful for making sure the adventur-
ing party can still do everything they need
to do, even though only two or three char-
acters are present.

and appropriate backgrounds for their characters. Even a few scribbled notes
to record a player’s creative thinking about who his or her character is and
where he or she comes from is better than nothing.
When the players create new characters, ask them to think up answers to
some or all of the following questions:
 Where was your character born? Where was he or she raised?
 Does he or she have a family? Why did your character leave them to
take up a life of adventuring?
 How did your character learn to do whatever it is his or her character
class does? How did your fighter learn to fight? How did your wizard
learn to use magic?
 Who are your character’s enemies? Are there any monsters that he or
she particularly hates or fears?
 Does your character have any interesting mannerisms or characteris-
tics? How did he or she come by them?
You might need to offer a concrete reward to the players for taking the time
and trouble to craft a good back story for their characters. For example, you
might award newly created characters bonus experience for a good back-
ground — say, 50 percent of what they need to hit their next level goal (or
about 500 XP for 1st-level characters). Sure, the power gamers in your group
will create character backgrounds solely for the purpose of speeding their
progress to their next level, but at least you got them to think about who
their characters are and how they fit into the world. 
Using character goals
Just like real people, well-crafted characters change over time. They learn
new things, they develop history with allies who aid them and with villains
who oppose them, and they strive to make progress toward goals they deem
desirable. Players naturally want to see their characters grow and change.
Power gamers want to see their characters gain impressive new abilities and
garner respect in the game world, and roleplayers want to see their charac-
ters make progress toward personal story goals — quite possibly goals they
imagined when they first created their characters, however many levels ago
that might be now.
So how do you figure out what the characters in your game want? You ask the
players. It’s that simple. You don’t even need to spend time at the gaming
table doing it — an e-mail, a hallway conversation, or a phone call between
game sessions will do just fine.
176
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Keep in mind that character goals can change over time. Things that seem
important to a player starting a 1st-level character might become passé when
that same character hits 9th or 10th level. You should periodically check
back with the players to find out whether their goals have evolved since the
last time you asked.
Character build goals
Gaining levels is a lot of fun, and each time a character gains a level, the
player gets a chance to select new and exciting rules options — new spells,
new feats, even new character classes. Many players begin low-level charac-
ters with their eyes already set on a signature move, tactics, or capability
they can’t wait to get their hands on. For example, a player with a fighter
character might look forward to the day he masters the Whirlwind Attack
feat; a rogue might anticipate the level at which he can enter a prestige class
that gives him the ability to hide in plain sight; or a paladin might dream of
the day he finds a holy avenger sword.
When you find out what the players’ character-building goals are, make a list of
things you’ll need to plan for future adventures. Some prestige classes have
special requirements that can be met only through specific adventures or
quests; some magic items won’t be suitable for a character until he gains a
number of levels.
Character build goals are easy on the DM because usually you don’t have to
do much more than provide the normal amount of character advancement in
the game for the player to make progress toward the goal. Some build goals
might require a little work — for example, if a player wants to see his or her
character gain a particular magic item (that holy avenger sword, say), you
will eventually need to place that item as treasure in an adventure or even
design an adventure in which the prize is the desired item. 
Story goals
Character goals that don’t involve gaining specific abilities or options are story
goals. Story goals might be seeded all the way back in a character’s background
(“my father was murdered; I want to find his killer someday and avenge his
death”) or be acquired during the course of a character’s adventuring career
(“the vampire Erissyl killed our brave comrade Jozan during our assault on the
Ebon Tower; someday we will hunt her down and avenge Jozan’s death”).
Story goals are significantly more work for you because each story goal
demands an adventure to resolve it. To help players achieve their story
goals, you have to provide adventure content that refers to these hopes and
aspirations. In the examples from the preceding paragraph, you’ll eventually
need to figure out how the player character can learn the identity of his or
her father’s killer, where that person or creature is now, and what he, she, or
it will do when confronted by a vengeful hero. On the bright side, the story
goals that the players share with you ought to provide a wealth of ideas for
creating adventures the players will care about. 
177
Chapter 12: Growing Your Game

Using 21st century technology 
to enhance your game
Lots of Web-savvy Dungeon Masters use 21st century technology to record
details of their regular D&D games. For example:
 Web site: You can create a Web site devoted to your game that your
players can access anytime they want to read up on what’s going on in
the game world. Nobody has to carry around a big, disorganized note-
book or misplace handouts you provided if an ongoing journal of your
game is a persistent, ever-growing section of your Web page.
A Web site is also a great place to keep information that’s generally
useful for your game. For example, if you have a set of rules or notes
about which game sourcebooks you allow in your game and which ones
you don’t, you can build a Character Creation tab or page for your site. If
you have extensive notes about the people or places in your game world
that you think the player characters ought to be familiar with, write
them up and post them on a World Atlas or Campaign Gazetteer page.
 Blog: Blogs (short for Web logs, which are online journals for those of
you who haven’t joined the 21st century yet) are excellent formats for
maintaining a lasting journal of your game. Like with a Web site, you can
use a blog to keep an online journal of your game that the players can
access anytime they please.
Most blog hosts allow users to leave comments on blog entries, so your
players can easily add their own comments to an entry journaling the
latest adventure.
You might also want to collect and maintain electronic versions of the play-
ers’ character sheets and keep the updated files on your Web site. That way,
if a player doesn’t show up, you can always hop on any Internet-connected
computer and download the latest version of a character should you need it.
Similarly, you can ask the players to contribute interesting content about
their characters to your site.
One of the more interesting techniques DMs use to keep player interest in their
campaigns bubbling is to use a Web site or blog to publish an in-world newslet-
ter — articles, missives, correspondence, or similar documents written “in
character” that show what’s going on in the game world. Imagine what sort of
flier or pamphlet a town crier might read from in a town where the player char-
acters are involved in dangerous dealings, heroic rescues, and deadly monster
hunts, and post that on your Web site or blog. Are the writers of the pamphlet
friends of the heroes, who celebrate their successes? Or are they suspicious,
narrow-minded gossips who delight in passing along every petty rumor they
can find? Creating the Web page or blog entries for the game world’s newsletter
takes a little work, but it’s a great payoff for the players.

O
ne of the biggest challenges you face as a Dungeon Master is simply
coming up with new material for each game session. Although there’s
no limit to the amount of adventures and encounters you can create with
nothing more than a bit of graph paper and some scribbled notes to yourself,
many DMs feel they can’t afford the time to generate everything in their
games from scratch. Learning how to acquire a steady stream of adventures,
encounters, maps, storylines, and villains for use in your game without
spending an inordinate amount of time doing so is just part of the fine art of
DMing a regular game. So, if you’re interested in presenting the best game
you can with the least preparation possible, read on!
Buying Published Game Material
The most obvious way to get good gaming material without doing all the
work yourself is to pay someone else for it. For this hobby, that means going
down to the bookstore or game store and buying professionally published
material for your game. If you’ve poked around the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS shelf
at your bookstore or visited your Friendly Local Gaming Store, you’ve proba-
bly noticed that literally hundreds of game accessories, sourcebooks, adven-
tures, and resources are all sitting on the shelves alongside the Player’s
Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual. 
Most of these game books are designed, illustrated, and edited by profession-
als, so you might find that that they’re as good as or better than adventure
material you can create yourself. However, this is not always true — quality
can vary widely from publisher to publisher and sourcebook to sourcebook.
Before you drop money on a new game sourcebook, take a few minutes to
thumb through the book and see whether you like what’s in there.

Understanding what’s out there
Three principal sources of published material exist for the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game: 
 Wizards of the Coast, Inc., the company that publishes D&D
 Paizo Publishing, the company that produces Dragon and Dungeon mag-
azines under license from Wizards of the Coast
 A number of other publishers that produce d20 material. d20 source-
books make use of Wizards of the Coast’s open source license agreement
to publish game material that is compatible with the D&D game
Adventures
One type of game product you can find are published adventures (sometimes
referred to as modules) for the D&D game. A well-designed adventure includes
an interesting storyline, challenging encounters and puzzles, cool maps, and a
memorable collection of monsters and villains. More importantly, it saves you
a lot of time and work. All you need to do is spend a couple hours reading
through the adventure so you know what’s going on and how to get the player
characters involved in it. In a pinch, you can probably do without even that
much preparation and just drop the PCs right in.
Official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventures include the original 3rd Edition
“Adventure Path,” beginning with Sunless Citadel and Forge of Fury. They’re a
few years old now, so you might not be able to find them easily. Recently,
Wizards of the Coast has started a new series of miniature-friendly adventure
products within the Fantastic Locations series. These include Fane of the Drow
and Hellspike Prison. Wizards of the Coast also publishes longer adventures,
such as Red Hand of Doom and The Shattered Gates of Slaughtergarde as well
as adventures for the FORGOTTEN REALMS and EBERRON settings. Finally, several
other d20 companies publish some excellent D&D-compatible adventures
under the d20 license agreement.
The best deal on published adventures is Dungeon Magazine, by Paizo
Publishing. Dungeon is licensed by Wizards of the Coast, Inc., the folks who
publish the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. A typical issue of Dungeon includes
two to four big adventures, plus a couple encounters, villains, or side treks.
Most adventures typically include
 A fully detailed dungeon, castle, temple, or similar site to explore
 Custom-built monsters or villains to fight
 A background and storyline that makes the adventure more three-
dimensional than a simple dungeon crawl
 A couple new spells, monsters, or magic items, as necessary
180
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Using a published adventure requires less creativity and preparation than
creating your own adventure. Whether that’s worth paying for depends on
your own personal preferences and circumstances. Even if you don’t use the
whole adventure, however, you can usually use parts of it, such as maps,
NPCs, or monsters, for your own campaign.
Player resource books
Sourcebooks that are devoted to exploring specific types of characters and
introducing new character options fall into the player resource book category.
Usually, sourcebooks with names such as Player’s Guide to . . . or Complete . . .
are player resource books. Official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS player resource books
include race books such as Races of Stone, Races of the Wild, and Races of the
Dragon, and class books such as Complete Warrior and Complete Arcane.
Player resource books might include some or all of the following:
 New character races
 New character classes
 New feats
 New prestige classes
 New spells
 Organizations or sites relevant to the new material
In general, player resource books don’t have much material you can use for
generating adventures and encounters for the players. However, the players
will find a lot of interesting new options for their characters.
DM resource books
Sourcebooks aimed at the Dungeon Master usually provide new threats,
rewards, or storylines for use in the game. Official D&D sourcebooks of this
sort include monster collections such as Monster Manual III or Fiend Folio;
terrain books such as Frostburn or Stormwrack; and in-depth monster studies
such as Draconomicon, Lords of Madness, or Fiendish Codex. 
DM resource books typically include
 New monsters
 New prestige classes
 New spells and magic items
 Storylines, themes, or adventure suggestions
 Ready-to-play encounter sites, monster lairs, or short adventures,
including maps and monster or villain statistics
 Organizations, villains, and sites relevant to the new material
181
Chapter 13: Using Every Available Resource

DM resource books naturally have more pages devoted to material you can
use for creating adventures and encounters for the players, and fewer pages
for new character options. Many also include chapters that have ready-to-
play adventures, encounters you can drop into your game with no additional
preparation, or keyed locales or sites you can easily borrow for use in your
own game.
Don’t overlook sourcebooks that are tied to particular game worlds. For
example, Wizards of the Coast publishes two sub-lines of D&D products, each
set in its own game world: the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, and the
Eberron Campaign Setting. Official D&D game products specific to a particular
world include sourcebooks such as City of Splendors: Waterdeep, Underdark,
and Mysteries of the Moonsea in the FORGOTTEN REALMS; and Sharn: City of
Towers and Secrets of Xen’drik in EBERRON. A number of other companies pro-
duce their own game settings that are compatible with D&D. Even if you don’t
play in one of these game worlds, you might find that you can drop products
such as these (or great portions of them) into your own game setting with a
minimum of work. Of course, your mileage may vary.
Miniatures and game play accessories
Not every D&D accessory involves something you read. Most DMs discover
that they need physical tools for their games as much as they need new
adventures and additional source material. If you use miniatures at the
gaming table, you’ll find that you really can’t ever have too many.
182
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

Figuring out what you need
It isn’t unusual to find that you can’t make use of everything in a particular
sourcebook in your game. Maybe the players don’t have the “right” mix of
character races or classes, or maybe you find that some of the material just
isn’t appropriate for the setting of your campaign. Fortunately, most well-
designed sourcebooks have plenty of material that you can pillage for almost
any game.
The single most important guiding principle in evaluating published source-
books and adventures is simply this: Does it strike you as cool? If the subject
matter is interesting to you, you’ll find a way to make it fit into your game,
and your game will be the better for it. Conversely, if you think it just isn’t
that interesting, it doesn’t matter how appropriate the sourcebook is for your
game or the players — you won’t have fun trying to build your game around
your new purchase. Save your gaming dollars for things that really inspire
you, and you’ll be happier in the long run.
Assuming that you’re going to stick to the cardinal rule and focus on things
that strike you as interesting, what else should you look for in a sourcebook
or adventure? The following subsections pose questions that you should ask
yourself when you’re deciding whether to buy a particular new sourcebook.
Does it require a restart?
You might find that you really can’t use a new sourcebook or adventure
unless you’re willing to restart your game with brand-new characters appro-
priate for the material you’ve just purchased. For example, if you buy the
Expanded Psionics Handbook and decide to fully incorporate psionics into
your game, the players really should have the opportunity to create psionic
characters if they want. If more than one or two players do so, you are effec-
tively restarting the game with a new assemblage of player characters, facing
new varieties of monsters and employing new powers.
Is it applicable to the player characters in this game?
Say you’re running a game in which most of the player characters are 3rd or
4th level, and you’re trying to decide whether to buy a copy of Epic Level
Handbook. Well, Epic Level Handbook is designed for characters of 20th level
or higher, so very little in the book is relevant to your current campaign.
Similarly, a book all about elves is great, but if none of the players in the game
has an elf character, it’s hard to see why you would really need it. 
Remember, if the topic of the adventure or sourcebook really catches your
eye, you can always choose to make it a central theme in your game. 
183
Chapter 13: Using Every Available Resource

What can I pillage?
Even if you encounter difficulties when trying to incorporate all the new
ideas or material from a sourcebook into your game, you can usually find
something that you can use with little work. Most sourcebooks include a
couple of maps, some interesting NPCs, a few good adventure suggestions, or
even just a monster or two you can drop into your game with no preparation.
You can usually pillage some or all of the following from almost any
sourcebook: 
 Monsters: Most D&D sourcebooks or adventures include at least one or
two new monsters. Even if there aren’t any new monsters, chances are
good that they offer new combinations of monsters, templates, and
classes you might find useful. Check to see whether the sourcebook
includes unique monsters you can use somewhere else in your game.
 Characters: Most prestige classes presented in a sourcebook include a
sample character. You can use these ready-to-play NPCs as villains,
allies, or just people the characters meet. See whether the sourcebook
you’re looking at includes characters that are fully described, including
game statistics.
 Adventure hooks: Many sourcebooks offer a number of adventure sug-
gestions. For example, a prestige class entry often includes several dif-
ferent scenarios in which the player characters might encounter a
member of that class. Good ideas for adventures are invaluable.
 Maps: If you’re cartographically challenged, you’ll often find that the
best way to map out your next dungeon is to simply use a map from
one of your sourcebooks and create your own keyed encounters and
challenges based on that map. Check out the sourcebook’s maps and
see whether they’re interesting, well-rendered, and easily adaptable to
multiple purposes.
184
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 
Which edition?
Most of the time, you’re better off spending your
gaming dollars on material designed for the cur-
rent edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game:
3rd Edition Revised, or v.3.5 as it’s known.
However, your hobby store might stock older
2nd Edition ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS sup-
plements. Although they aren’t compatible with
the current edition, you might find these out-of-
date sourcebooks to have enough maps, adven-
ture hooks, or story ideas to make them worth a
second look, though you’ll need to do some
work to make them current with your game. As
always, your mileage may vary.

Finding Story Inspiration
Many Dungeon Masters choose to create their own adventures and cam-
paigns out of nothing more than their imaginations. If you’re one of those
DMs, good for you! Devising exciting adventures and crafting a fantastic
world for your D&D game are some of the most rewarding parts of being a
Dungeon Master.
However, even the most creative DM can use a helping hand every now and
then. For some people, it’s a matter of time; depending on the amount of
detail and contingency planning you deem necessary in preparing adventures
for the players, designing a big dungeon might take up your hobby time for
weeks and weeks. Other DMs have the time but find it hard to come up with
original ideas on demand. When your creation well runs dry, try some of the
options in the following sections.
The real world
The first place you can look for ideas is right in front of you. Between the
Earth’s astonishing variety of terrain and climate and the similarly broad
canvas of human societies in different places and times, you can find zillions
of ideas for interesting adventures. If you need a floor plan for a castle, why
not base your map sketch on the plan of a real castle? You can find plenty of
books about castles at your local library or bookstore, or you might do well
to hop online and use your favorite search engine to see whether anybody’s
ever posted that sort of information to the Web.
Naturally, books on medieval life, history, or castles in general are useful to
many D&D games. Encyclopedias often have interesting articles on a variety
of these topics. In addition to references on medieval Europe, keep your eyes
open for books or articles pertaining to other times — the Dark Ages or the
Renaissance, for instance — and other cultures, such as the medieval Arabic,
Byzantine, Malinese, or even Chinese or Japanese Empires. Even modern-day
examples of exotic places and cultures might prove inspirational. National
Geographic is a treasure trove of ideas for a D&D game. By checking out the
interesting locales, maps, and portraits of societies and customs from all over
the world, you’ll find something in every issue.
Fantasy fiction
Over the years, thousands of authors have created tens of thousands of fan-
tasy stories. There’s no reason you can’t quietly borrow elements of a couple
from your own favorites for use in your D&D game. As long as you don’t create
185
Chapter 13: Using Every Available Resource

an adventure that’s all about taking the Sole Ring of Ultimate Might to Mount
Woe in order to destroy it in the volcanic fires where it was forged, the players
might not even notice that your adventure was inspired by a book you read.
186
Part II: Advanced Dungeon Mastering 

If you want to use your favorite fantasy story as inspiration for your game,
here are a few guidelines to keep in mind:
 Short stories are better than novels; a short story can easily inspire a
single adventure.
 Stories with lots of action make for better games than stories that are
driven by the relationships of the characters. 
 The more obscure, the better; try to avoid stories the players are inti-
mately familiar with.
 Fantastic it up — most fantasy fiction is less fantastic than D&D, so con-
sider changing human kingdoms or characters into creatures of a more
fantastic nature.
 File off the serial numbers. Make sure you change names of places and
characters enough so that the players won’t recognize them.
Robert E. Howard’s Conan stories or Fritz Leiber’s Fafhrd and the Gray
Mouser tales are good examples of the sort of fiction that lends itself to con-
version into D&D adventures. You could do worse than to model an adven-
ture after Howard’s The Devil in Iron or Leiber’s Swords of Lankhmar. 
Movies and TV
Imagine this scenario: An honest lawman is hired to clean up a rough-and-
tumble mining town, but when he does his job too well, the corrupt mayor
calls in the hired guns to kill the lawman and stop him from setting things
right. It’s a plot from a Western, right? Not exactly — this is from the Sean
Connery movie Outland, which was really just a Western story with a science
fiction setting. If the formula works for Hollywood, it can work for you, too.
There’s no reason you can’t borrow the basic plot structure of almost any
action movie, replace some of the thugs and villains with monsters, and pre-
sent it as a D&D adventure for the players.
TV shows also have some lessons for a DM in search of creativity. Unlike a
movie, which usually ends with the biggest and most satisfying resolution
possible for the hero, a TV show is a serial. A single episode can’t resolve
every problem the hero faces, because if it does, the viewers have no reason
to tune in next week. Your D&D game is more like a TV show than a movie; at
the end of the adventure, you need plenty of reasons for the players to come
back and see what happens next.
A well-written TV show commonly introduces an immediate problem that can
be resolved with reasonable satisfaction in the single episode you’re watch-
ing, but also throws in elements of long-term plots and developments that
might never be resolved. Think of The X-Files: In every episode, Mulder and
187
Chapter 13: Using Every Available Resource

Scully discover, investigate, and then deal with (or just survive) some imme-
diate threat, but in the background several important storylines and recur-
ring figures keep the series-spanning meta-plot moving forward with
appearances by characters such as Cancer Man and Deep Throat.
It’s hard to imagine a better example of a serial adventure format for a D&D
game. Replace Mulder and Scully with the player characters, the immediate
problem of the episode with the dungeon they’re currently exploring, and the
meta-plot characters with long-term patrons or master villains appropriate to
your campaign, and you’ve got the ingredients of a great campaign.
The collision of ideas
Want to know one of the big secrets of the creative process? Here it is:
Anybody can think up something new by taking two different things and
mashing them together. When you’re really stuck, try pairing up a couple
ideas or notions that don’t seem to have anything to do with each other,
and see where it takes you. 
For example, take pirates and a wizard’s tower. How could you build an
adventure around those components? Maybe the player characters want to
explore the wizard’s tower, but first they have to find the pirates who know
where it is and infiltrate their operation. Maybe the player characters can
find and explore the tower easily enough, but just when they think the adven-
ture’s over and they’re about to leave with the loot, a band of pirates shows
up to take the treasure away from them. Or maybe the wizard who dwells in
the tower has hired a pirate band to comb the seas in search of a magic gem
he needs for some special rite, and the player characters have to beat the
pirates to the prize — and then survive the wizard’s wrath. There are a dozen
more where those came from, all based on the collision of two simple ideas.
Talking with Other Gamers
One final resource deserves mention in this chapter: the community of
gamers that exists across the world. You aren’t the only Dungeon Master out
there looking for an adventure for your Friday night game. Kicking around the
idea for an adventure with just one other DM can help you spot plot holes,
work out refinements to your basic premise, and come up with a hundred
other things you might not have thought of before. Other DMs might have
advice on how to handle characters that seem to be causing trouble in your
game, suggestions for challenges and traps the players would never expect
from you, or even old adventures and encounters they’d be willing to swap in
exchange for some of your own old game material.

Joining a game club
Depending on where you live and what you do, you might be closer to a net-
work of other D&D fans than you think. Many high schools and colleges have
gaming clubs for their students, which provide you with a supply of potential
players as well as a chance to network with other DMs. Local gaming clubs
often have arrangements with schools, libraries, or hobby stores for regular
game nights, providing a safe and convenient place to play D&D.
If you don’t have a gaming club close at hand (or if your school days are, alas,
behind you), some of the better hobby stores around often sponsor their
own game nights. Check with your Friendly Local Game Store to see whether
it sponsors any D&D nights.
Finally, there’s a worldwide network of D&D fans known as the RPGA
(ROLEPLAYING GAMERS ASSOCIATION). You can find RPGA chapters all over the
country. The RPGA sponsors several special programs that reward you
for joining and DMing for other members. You can find out more at www.
rpga.com.
Corresponding on the Web
If you don’t happen to have a local gaming club available, the Internet offers
the opportunity to communicate with countless other gamers. Message
boards at several popular gaming-related sites offer you an excellent forum
for seeking help with particular plot problems, difficult characters, purchas-
ing decisions, or adventure design.
Wizards of the Coast Web site
www.wizards.com
The official Web site of Wizards of the Coast, Inc. provides support for all the
games the company publishes, including the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. You
can find previews of new and upcoming products, various articles and game
content, message boards, and pointers to mailing lists.
EN World
www.enworld.org
The EN World Web site is about the busiest D&D and RPG site out there other
than Wizards of the Coast itself. It’s a great place to find out about d20 prod-
ucts not published by Wizards of the Coast, so if you want to hear what
people are saying about other d20 companies this is probably the place to
start looking.

The Paizo Publishing Web site is the official site for Dragon and Dungeon mag-
azines. It also has plenty of chatter on all things D&D. You can also order
back issues of these magazines through the Web site, which might be handy if
you find that there’s a particular article or adventure you would really like to
get your hands on.
Candlekeep 
www.candlekeep.com
The Candlekeep Web site is devoted to the FORGOTTEN REALMS world. The dis-
cussion here tends to run more toward the details of the world (some might
even say minutiae). A number of FORGOTTEN REALMS authors and designers
keep half an eye on this site, as do many fellow fans who are real masters of
Realmslore.
We’re sure you’ve heard it before, but be careful about who you talk to online.
If you’re a minor, you should ask your parent or guardian before you visit any
online forum, chat room, or bulletin board. And never, ever provide any per-

dventures. You can’t play the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game without them.
Eventually, you’re going to want to (or need to) create your own adven-
ture. You’ll need something for the next game session, and nothing you’ve
found will quite fit the needs of your campaign. Or, the gaming group is get-
ting together in a few hours, and you haven’t had time to get over to your
favorite game store to find an adventure. Or, you just want to expand your
creative muscles and create your own adventure. 
That’s where this chapter comes in. We show you how to craft a solid adven-
ture, even if you don’t think you’re up to the challenge. In this chapter, we
examine the tools of adventure design and set the foundation for the rest of
the chapters in Part III. 
Breaking Down the Parts 
of a D&D Adventure
For the Dungeon Master, creating adventures can be a wonderful outlet for
creative expression and imagination. Although not everyone can be a Tolkien
or a Salvatore, every DM can craft solid, fun D&D adventures.

Adventure design doesn’t strive to craft a complete story. The DM provides
only part of the story — the rest comes out through the game and the actions
of the player characters. The DM sets up the basic plot and a rough structure
for an adventure, leaving the conclusions to come when the game is played.
This means that how things turn out will be a surprise to everyone, including
the DM. That’s part of the fun of the D&D game.
Like everything in life, adventure design becomes a lot easier when you break
it down into parts. Deal with each part, and soon you have a complete and
vibrant adventure. An adventure (also called a quest, a mission, or a module)
is a collection of related encounters that create a cogent storyline. An adven-
ture promises a story, offers obstacles, provides opportunities for each
player character to shine, and delivers a threat. 
As you build your adventure, think in terms of setting scenes. You provide
the beginning for each scene in the story, providing a place for the player
characters to make a decision or select a course of action. Don’t think about
endings, because you want the adventure to play out through the actions and
ideas of the players and their characters. 
Always ask the players “What do you want to do?” or “What do you do now?”
End each part of your setup with one of these or a similar question, showing
that it’s always up to the players to decide the next course of action for their
characters.
Adventures consist of the following parts:
 The premise: The hook you use to catch the players’ interests and pro-
vide motivation for their characters.
 Encounters: The space for action and drama. This is where the game is
played. Encounters come in three basic forms: 
• Challenge encounters
• Roleplaying (or interaction) encounters
• Combat encounters
 The end: The adventure usually winds up with a climactic encounter
and provides a variety of options for moving on to the next adventure.
The rest of this chapter examines these parts, as well as the other tools you
use to craft D&D adventures.
194
Part III: Creating Adventures 

The premise
A premise sets up the promise of your adventure. It’s an initial situation that
gets the player characters involved. Some of the premise is background, the
things that happened before the adventure begins. Some of the premise is the
opening hook, the scene you use to start the adventure and get the player
characters interested. 
195
Chapter 14: Tools of the Trade

The background is what has gone before, the lead up to the start of the
adventure. It could be long and complex — the war between the dwarves and
the giants has been going on for decades when one dwarf and one giant
approach the player characters with a plan for ending the conflict. It could be
brief and to the point — something has been killing town folk every night for
the past month and now the town elders need help.
Examples of adventure premises include
 Lights have been seen in the abandoned Tower of the Mad Wizard, and
strange creatures have been spotted roaming just outside the village of
Welton.
196
Part III: Creating Adventures 
Where to start?
Sometimes you’ll want to start an adventure
right at the beginning. However, this means that
a lot of the game is spent dealing with setup and
motivations. Every once in awhile, for variety, try
starting an adventure in the middle of the action.
Come up with an opening scene that is reminis-
cent of action movies, something exciting and
intriguing, with plenty of flair and style so that
the players get caught up in the game. Start out
with a call for action, and let the players decide
how and why their characters get involved.
There’s always a risk that the players will decide
to turn the other way, but in the end, everyone is
here to play D&D. Most of the time, if you dangle
the action in front of them, the players will jump
to get their characters involved. After all, that’s
where the fun is.
Using the example premises given in “The
premise” section, here’s how to start in the
middle of the action:
 The player characters are on the road to the
village of Welton when they come around a
bend and spot an ancient and partially col-
lapsed tower. The place looks abandoned
and very gloomy in the twilight darkness of
the forest. Suddenly, an eerie light flares in
one of the tower windows, and the player
characters notice something move in the
shadows around them. Unearthly growls fill
the woods, and the things in the shadows
leap toward them. What do the player char-
acters do?
 On the road to the City of Far Spires, the
player characters come upon a richly
appointed elven caravan. The caravan is
being attacked by marauding bugbears, and
already many of the elf guards have fallen.
What do the player characters want to do?
 The player characters have been hired to
guard the vaults of the dwarf lords. There
are seven connected vaults, each contain-
ing something more valuable than the last.
Over the past three weeks, the first three
vaults have been robbed. Now the fourth
vault is under the protection of the player
characters. Suddenly, the vault falls into
complete darkness, and the PCs hear a
strange, twisted laugh. “So you think you
can stop me?” the laughing voice calls from
the darkness. “Then let the contest begin!”
What do the player characters want to do?

 An elf cleric needs someone to guard her and the ancient Elrooven Cask
that she seeks to transport to the City of Far Spires.
 A thief has been robbing the vaults of the dwarf lords, getting around
every trap and ward the dwarves have put in place. The thief must be
stopped before the next vault is plundered.
Encounters
Every DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure consists of encounters. Encounters are
where the action takes place. Three types of encounters exist: challenge, role-
playing, and combat. With these basic building blocks, you can construct
adventures.
Every encounter is kind of like a miniature, concentrated version of the entire
adventure. An encounter has a premise and a setup. It has a location. It has a
goal. And it has a connection to the next step in the adventure.
Encounter goals can be summed up by the verb that best describes the
action required to complete the encounter — capture, defeat, discover,
destroy, escape, find, negotiate, obtain, protect, rescue, and survive are a few
examples. In an encounter, the player characters might have to defeat the gar-
goyle guarding the magic fountain, destroy the evil ring in the pool of molten
lava, find the hidden tomb of Baranka the Vile, or survive the dangers of the
Chamber of One Hundred Deaths. 
The following subsections take a closer look at the types of encounters you
can use to build your adventure.
Challenge encounters
Challenge encounters feature a hazard, a trap, or an obstacle that the player
characters must overcome to attain the goal of the encounter. Skills, spells,
and ability checks, as well as ingenuity and quick thinking, provide the player
characters with the things they need to complete challenge encounters.
These are the encounters where the less combat-oriented characters can
shine. Rogues and bards have a variety of skills that can be useful in chal-
lenge encounters, and spellcasting types often have options available to them
to help navigate a path through the most deadly of obstacles.
Roleplaying (or interaction) encounters
Because the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is a roleplaying game, it could be said
that all encounters are roleplaying encounters. But when we talk about role-
playing encounters, we mean encounters in which player characters (PCs)
197
Chapter 14: Tools of the Trade

must interact with each other or with DM-controlled nonplayer characters
(NPCs) to attain the goal of the encounter. These are the scenes where PCs
must talk to, convince, bluff, bribe, insult, seduce, negotiate, interrogate, 
beg, or otherwise interact with an NPC to advance the adventure. Roleplaying
encounters often lead to challenges or combats, depending on how the scene
plays out. These encounters rely on roleplaying and conversation, using skill
checks sparingly to augment roleplaying and to determine the reactions of
NPCs.
When a roleplaying encounter calls for skill checks, the skills that usually
come into play include Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and
Sense Motive.
Combat encounters
In most D&D adventures, the majority of encounters are combat encounters.
When you think of the D&D game, combat encounters are the scenes you usu-
ally imagine. 
In combat encounters, the player characters must face and defeat monsters
or other DM-controlled opponents. Combat skills and spells see the most use
in these encounters.
In addition to the monsters or opponents the player characters must face, a
combat encounter works best when set in an interesting location where
movement and tactics can come into play. Try to imagine what each of the
player characters can do, and plan challenges accordingly. Try to include
something for everyone to do in most combat encounters.
The end
Every adventure has an ending. Create a climactic encounter to end your
adventure. It should involve elements that have been hinted at throughout
earlier scenes, and it should provide the pay off that the player characters
have been waiting for — they get to deal with the main villain or at least dis-
rupt the main villain’s plans and save the day, for the time being.
The climax is where all the answers wait to be discovered — the true plan,
the true villain, the true evil behind it all. The climax is also where the main
battle usually occurs — where the player characters face the boss monster
and everything is on the line.
Not every adventure needs to be earth-shattering or deal with huge stakes,
but the end should still entail a payoff.
198
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Sometimes your adventure is just one in a series that will take the player char-
acters up in level and unveil greater and greater threats along the way. In these
cases, you don’t want to have your villain defeated at the end of the first adven-
ture in the series. Instead, you should provide assistants and minions — some
that are powerful in their own right — to give the player characters someone
to defeat and some insidious plan to foil with each adventure, even if another
plan is revealed right at the end.
199
Chapter 14: Tools of the Trade
What makes an adventure exciting?
Remember that the players (or their characters)
can’t see the behind-the-scenes machinations
of your villains or the clever plot twists that you
have liberally sprinkled throughout the adven-
ture. You want your adventures to have the feel
of a great fantasy novel or movie, but you can’t
rely on the same tricks that those mediums use.
Don’t just imagine your adventure as a series of
fights occasionally interrupted by periods of
talking. When you do, you shortchange one of
the most compelling parts of the game — play-
ing a role. Give some thought to the personali-
ties, motivations, and goals of your nonplayer
characters, especially the key villains and
anyone you expect the player characters to
deal with in roleplaying encounters. In this way,
even scenes where combat never breaks out
can be memorable and exciting.
In addition to the ranks of goblins and orcs you
use to provide the player characters with rows
of bad guys to take down, you want to be sure to
include competent adversaries for them to
encounter. From common enemies to arch vil-
lains, make sure that these spotlight opponents
can stack up against the player characters. This
doesn’t mean that all your villains must be
super-powerful, but they shouldn’t be too weak,
either. Set up and play an intelligent villain, 
and that NPC can seem more powerful in the
game than it does on paper. And when you
create that villain NPC for the climactic
encounter, make sure the NPC can stand against
the player characters for a few rounds, or that
the NPC is supported by minions who can add
weight to the scene.
Consider that the best fights take place in amaz-
ing places. Any combat encounter can be excit-
ing, but a combat that involves deadly monsters
and a dangerous or challenging location can be
memorable. Imagine a fight in a huge chamber
full of pits, chasms, and ledges, where the ter-
rain becomes both an ally and an enemy as the
battle rages on. What if a fight takes place in
dense fog that gives concealment to creatures
1 square away (adding a 20 percent miss
chance) and makes it impossible to see any-
thing beyond that? What about a chamber com-
prised of raising and lowering platforms that
move at random and keep the opponents apart? 
Remember: The players take their cues from
you. Your descriptions of each action that
occurs, the location of each important object and
participant, and the general environment are
crucial to letting players imagine the scene and
make intelligent decisions for their characters.
How you pass on information can help set the
tone of a scene, as well. Speak quickly and
intently to add intensity to the action. Be slow
and deliberate when you want to build atmos-
phere or suspense. In this way, the players will
(perhaps even unconsciously) pick up on your
verbal cues and will become better at visualizing
the scene and will make better decisions for their
characters’ actions with each game you play.

Creating Dungeon Maps
Site-based adventures, which are usually dungeon crawls, are the easiest
adventures to design and run. Site-based adventures use encounters keyed to
a map, and the map provides a natural flow for the adventure.
Use graph paper when drawing your dungeon map. Each square equals 5 feet.
Mark encounter areas with some kind of key (numbers or letters work best),
and note any special features, such as doors, curtains, furniture, and traps.
Later, when the player characters have moved through an area, make notes
right on your map to remind you which doors they unlocked, which traps
they set off, and which monsters they defeated.
Keep the key to your map on a separate sheet of paper from the map itself. If
you marked an encounter area as 1 or A, use that same notation on your key
page. On the key, make notes about each area on the map, including mon-
sters, traps, and treasure. These notes should be as long or as short as you’re
comfortable with so that you can easily run your adventure from them.
You can stay as simple or get as complex as you want with the details of your
dungeon. A simple dungeon is often static, meaning that you set the monsters
in place and that’s where they stay until the player characters encounter
them. A dynamic (and therefore more complex) dungeon features notes on
contingency plans the monsters have in place and often sets conditional
statements such as “if the PCs do this, then that occurs.” 
Use the various examples of maps shown throughout this book, such as 
the dungeon maps in Chapters 7 and 20, as guidelines when creating your
own maps.
Populating a Dungeon
In general, you populate a dungeon (or any kind of adventure) with oppo-
nents to challenge the player characters. Some of these opponents take the
form of traps or natural hazards (challenge encounters), but the majority of
opponents appear in the form of monsters or villains.
You can take monsters right out of any one of a number of ready-to-use
sources, including the D&D Monster Manual, Monster Manual II, Monster
Manual III, Monster Manual IV, and Fiend Folio. 
Villains are a little tougher, requiring a little bit of work on your part. Villains
usually have character classes (such as an evil human cleric or a half-dragon
sorcerer). A master villain is usually an NPC 2 to 4 levels higher than the aver-
age level of the player characters, whatever that may be. A persistent nemesis
who gives the heroes trouble when they are low-level characters might be
200
Part III: Creating Adventures 

quickly surpassed as the player characters rise in level . . . or you might
decide to advance the heroes’ nemesis too, so that the master villain remains
a signature foe throughout the player characters’ career. 
What kind of monsters and villains are right for your dungeon adventure?
That depends on the story you want to tell and the level and party size of the
player characters. The game uses Challenge Ratings (CRs) and Encounter
Levels (ELs) to help you determine whether a particular opponent or group
of opponents will be easy, tough, or darn near impossible for the player char-
acters to deal with.
Challenge Ratings
A Challenge Rating is assigned to every monster in the game. A monster’s CR
tells you the level of a party of player characters for which the monster will
provide a good challenge, meaning that the monster isn’t likely to kill any of
the PCs, but it will take about a quarter of the PCs’ resources (including hit
points) to defeat. For example, a party of four 2nd-level adventurers should
see a good challenge from a CR 2 monster. 
The CR of a monster also helps you determine the experience point (XP)
award for that monster. Taking on a monster with a lower CR than the party
results in less XP, but taking on a higher-CR monster results in higher XP. You
divide the XP by the number of player characters in the party, so a party with
more than four PCs earns less XP per character, and a party with fewer than
four PCs earns more XP per character.
Encounter Level
A single monster’s CR is the same as its Encounter Level (EL).
Because it is more interesting to throw multiple monsters into a fight than to
have a party of player characters beat up on a single monster, we use the EL
system to determine the appropriate challenge for a party.
When you craft each encounter in your adventure, assign monsters to hit the
Encounter Level you want associated with the encounter.
You’re going to want to review the information on pages 48–50 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide. It tells you how to use CRs and ELs to build encounters. 
You want the level of the party to match the level of the encounter. Some
encounters should be easier than average; some should be harder. Table 14-1
describes the optimal mix of encounters to throw at the PCs over the course
of an adventure. (This table is adapted from Table 3-4 on page 49 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide.)

Some types of encounters will be easier if the player characters have found
the appropriate item or done the appropriate thing, as noted in the second
row of Table 14-1. If  the PCs don’t have the item or haven’t done the appro-
priate action, the encounter becomes challenging or very difficult. For exam-
ple, not finding the right weapon that can bypass a monster’s Damage
Reduction turns an easy encounter into a challenging one.
The percentages relate to the overall dungeon you design. For example, if you
design a dungeon with ten combat or challenge encounters, one should be
easy, two should be easy if handled properly, five should be challenging, one
or two should be very difficult, and one or none should be overpowering.
Rewards
The last piece of the adventure design puzzle revolves around rewards.
Rewards include experience points and treasure, as well as the pure player
satisfaction of solving a mystery or completing a goal. Rewards are the
benchmark a DM uses to show the players how well they’ve played and how
good their characters are, based on the challenges they overcome. 
202
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Experience points
Most players are as eager to find out how many experience points their char-
acters earned for the adventure as they are to see what kind of treasure their
characters found. After all, the experience point total a character has earned
determines his or her level. Updating characters who have gone up a level is
great fun for most players, and many will pore over the Player’s Handbook,
carefully reading the descriptions of feats, skills, and spells before choosing
which ones are the coolest or most optimized for their characters.
Calculating how many experience points the PCs earned for the adventure is
easy. Monsters and other challenges have CRs and ELs that correspond to XP
awards. Page 38 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide has a comprehensive table for
determining XP awards by CR. You can also assign a CR to challenges or role-
playing encounters so that you can award XP for the successful completion
of those kinds of encounters. In general, you never want to assign a CR higher
than the party level for challenge and roleplaying encounters. Save the big
rewards for the combat encounters.
Treasure
Treasure comes in a number of forms. Monetary treasure includes gold, as
well as gems, jewels, and other things that the party can easily convert to
203
Chapter 14: Tools of the Trade
Structure your adventure for the players
You want to make sure that you create an
adventure of the right length and complexity for
your game group. A group that meets sporadi-
cally probably wants to play shorter, less com-
plex adventures, and it would be difficult to build
a continuous storyline from adventure to adven-
ture. On the other hand, a group that meets fre-
quently can handle the complexity of longer
plots that continue on from adventure to adven-
ture. Keep in mind that good adventures are
adventures that include things the players like
to do — things they find fun. 
Whether the adventure you’re creating is a
simple dungeon crawl or it’s a part of a larger
campaign, always include situations where
players can make choices. Try to avoid leading
the player characters or railroading them just to
get to what you’ve designed; players need to
feel like they have a say in the direction of the
adventure. Always vary the types of encounters
you build into the adventure so at least one
encounter will interest each player; avoid 
creating encounters where the player charac-
ters are simply spectators — the PCs need to
be in the thick of the action. Always think of
encounters where each player character has a
moment to shine; avoid creating encounters
that continually nullify player character powers
and abilities.

cash. Then there’re magic items, weapons and armor, and other items found
in dungeons or on defeated monsters and other opponents.
Tables on pages 51–56 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide provide guidelines for
assigning treasure to the encounters in your dungeon. Try to include a mix of
treasure types throughout your adventure. If a table calls for a 900 gp reward,
for example, you can make that reward just gold, or a magic item worth 900 gp,
or a gem, or jewels, or any combination that adds up to 900 gp.

The Dungeon Adventure
In This Chapter
 Designing dungeons
 Reviewing dungeon adventure structure
 Adding a dynamic element to dungeon crawls
T
he original adventure structure for roleplaying games is the dungeon
crawl. When you want to get started creating your own adventures, we
recommend using the basic form. Dungeons, after all, are half of what the
D&D game is all about!
There are places of legend in the D&D game, such as Castle Ravenloft, the
Tomb of Horrors, and the Temple of Elemental Evil. For anyone who has
played the game in the past, one or more of these legendary names will con-
jure images of danger, excitement, and thrilling fun. By using the advice and
tips we provide in this chapter, your dungeons can accomplish the same
thing for your fellow players.
Check out Chapter 18 for suggestions on how to build a dungeon adventure
by using random elements. It’s a fun and fast method for creating an adven-
ture quickly or on the fly. At the very least, Chapter 18 should give you some
ideas on what to put into the dungeon crawl that you design with the meth-
ods we describe in this chapter.
Designing Your First Dungeon
When you’re creating a dungeon crawl (also called a site-based adventure),
you need to prepare several elements to make a complete adventure:
 A story idea
 A map of the dungeon
 A key to the locations on the map

The key to the locations on the map describes encounter areas that are trig-
gered when the player characters arrive there. You want to use all the tools
and building blocks presented in Chapter 14, applying them to the map of the
site that you create.
Plotting the dungeon’s story
Dungeon crawls tend to be linear adventures where the encounter locations
provide the impetus to move the plot forward. In other words, the dungeon
map provides the structure and flow of the story. Depending on the complex-
ity of the dungeon map that you create, the player characters can have a
single path to follow or multiple ways to get to the goal of the adventure.
Here’s that dragon and the egg conundrum: Which comes first, the dungeon
map or the story idea? Our answer is that it doesn’t matter because the creative
process is different for everyone, so we don’t stifle and muck with your creativ-
ity by telling you The One True Way to design a dungeon crawl adventure. 
If you start out with a story idea, you draw a map to fit that story and fill it
with encounters that help you develop the storyline. On the other hand, you
might prefer to start out by drawing a cool map, and then crafting a story to
take advantage of its pattern. There’s no right way to approach this, and over
the years we’ve used both approaches in our personal games as well as in
professional projects.
However you approach the creation of your dungeon crawl adventure,
remember that the main action and most of the story takes place in the dun-
geon itself. This doesn’t mean that a dungeon crawl will limit your creativity,
however, because dungeons can take a wide variety of forms. They can be
carved corridors of stone or natural passages through caverns. Really, any
confined place can be used as a dungeon, whether it’s a cave complex, a
wizard’s stronghold, or a king’s castle. 
Drawing the map
You need graph paper to draw your map. You don’t need to be an artist to
make a useful map. Just make it as clear as you can, and make notes about
the encounter areas. If you can’t draw a sarcophagus, for example, don’t
sweat it. Make a rectangle and write sarcophagus next to it (or just “S”) so
that you can remember what that rectangle represents. 
Why use graph paper? There are a number of reasons. Everything in the game
is expressed either in feet or in 5-foot squares. Those nice little squares on
graph paper simplify your job of translating encounter areas into either feet
or 5-foot squares. Plus, the grid pattern makes it easier to draw straight (or
nearly straight) lines as you draw your map. 
206
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Here are some suggestions to make your dungeon map drawings better: 
 Larger areas are better than smaller areas when it comes to creating
encounter zones. Why? Because you want to have room for the player
characters and monsters to move around. A dynamic battle that
involves tactical movement is better than a static battle where everyone
lines up and stands still until the fight ends.
On the other hand, don’t make encounter areas so big that they won’t
work on the gaming table. Especially if you use miniatures and minia-
ture-scale maps at the table, you want your encounter areas to fit within
the space you can depict for play. A room more than 100 feet (or 20
squares) across is difficult to transfer to a tabletop battle grid.
 Wider corridors are better than narrow corridors. In general, you
should make the corridors in your dungeon two squares (10 feet) wide.
This allows player characters to walk side-by-side as they explore the
dungeon, and it provides room for Large-sized creatures to move around
freely. If you plan an encounter with multiple Large-sized creatures, you
want to give them room to move and position themselves easily. If they
have to line up, one behind the other, the PCs aren’t dealing with multi-
ple monsters — they’re fighting them one at a time. Neither the monsters
nor the PCs can move around much, and that makes for a boring fight.
If you plan to use Huge-sized creatures for encounters, you want to con-
sider making your corridors at least three squares (15 feet) wide to
accommodate these monsters. Encounter areas should be sized accord-
ingly, as well.
Marking the encounter areas
Corridors connect to rooms and chambers in your dungeon, but you can
craft encounter areas so that encounters take place either in the corridors or
in the rooms. You don’t want the players to come to expect that combat or
challenges will occur only in rooms, and to expect that nothing much will
happen in the hallways of the dungeon. The best dungeons mix it up so that
some encounters occur in corridors and some rooms are empty. If you mix it
up, the players will always be guessing about when the next encounter is
going to spring out at them.
Mark your encounter areas on your dungeon map with numbers or letters.
You’ll use these same numbers or letters when you fill in your map key (see
the “Making a key” section, later in this chapter). Feel free to make short
notes on the map itself, next to encounter areas, if you want to jot down
details such as what the symbols you’ve created are or other notes to aid
your memory. For example, you might want to note such things as fountains,
statues, pillars, pits, gates, steps, and other dungeon contents. 
207
Chapter 15: The Dungeon Adventure

Consider which encounter areas will work best for the different encounter
types we describe in Chapter 14. You want to make sure to include a mix of
encounter types as you design your dungeon. Note that dungeons don’t have
to be huge, with dozens of encounters, to be satisfying and fun. For your first
couple dungeon designs especially, keep it short and to the point, with about
ten or so encounters of various types.
Also consider the placement of encounter areas and how that might affect
the flow of the adventure. Encounter areas that are few and far between make
for lulls in the action. Encounter areas that are close to each other might
escalate into large running battles due to proximity and monster mix. And
you want to decide whether to include alternative routes through the dun-
geon, or whether to create a single path for the adventure.
Making a key
You’ve marked the encounter areas on your map with a number or a letter
code. Maybe you even used both to better represent the expected flow of the
208
Part III: Creating Adventures 

adventure. You might have made some notes on the map, but you need to
make a full-fledged key to best run your dungeon crawl as an adventure. What
goes on the key?
Set up your key in sequential order so that you can find things quickly. If your
map is labeled 1, 2, 3, and so on, then make the key in the same fashion:
Describe encounter area 1, then 2, then 3, and so on. 
Each keyed encounter should get some attention. You can make these
encounter notes as detailed or as brief as you want, as long as you can work
with them in the heat of the game session. Nothing is more embarrassing
than finding yourself trying to interpret your own obscure notes in the
middle of a dramatic encounter. So, our advice is to be as clear and as com-
plete as you need to be for your own use.
Each entry in your key should include the setup for the encounter, a descrip-
tion of the encounter area, the scene, monsters, tactics, and rewards.
Setup
The setup portion of each encounter entry in your key includes what’s in the
encounter area, what’s going on before the player characters arrive, and what
the goal of the encounter is. The setup is also where you can note what kind
of encounter you expect this to be, whether a challenge, roleplaying, or
combat encounter.
Description
The description part of a key entry takes three forms:
 What the player characters can see and otherwise notice as they arrive
 What player characters can see and otherwise notice with skill checks
(such as Listen and Spot)
 What’s behind the scenes that only the DM knows
209
Chapter 15: The Dungeon Adventure
Look to the book!
We include good examples of maps and dun-
geon adventures in various places in this book.
Refer to them for inspiration and to see how 
to design them as you read through this chap-
ter. Chapters 7 and 20, for example, feature 
full-length dungeon crawls (though Chapter 20
provides a more complex adventure format than
Chapter 7). Chapter 28 features encounters and
maps that you can use to round out your dun-
geon design. Use the examples we’ve provided
to make your own dungeon designs better.
That’s why we included them in this book!

In a published adventure, the first part is covered by a “read aloud” section.
You don’t need to write read aloud text, but you do have to improvise a descrip-
tion when the PCs enter the area. Whether you improvise or write out a read
aloud paragraph or two ahead of time, make sure that your description of the
encounter area provides enough information and clues so the players can visu-
alize the scene and determine whether they need to have their characters per-
form some action (such as making a Search check to find a secret door).
Scene
The scene portion of a key entry describes the action you expect to happen
in the encounter. Now, player characters have a way of doing the unexpected
and making the scene play out completely different from what you had imag-
ined, but that’s okay. You still want to have a general idea of what you think is
going to happen in the encounter.
Monsters or NPCs
You need to make a list of the monsters or NPCs involved in the encounter.
(This mostly applies to combat encounters, but it could apply to roleplaying
encounters, as well.) This can be as simple as recording a name and noting a
page number in the Monster Manual for you to refer to during the game ses-
sion, or as complex as creating an NPC or unique monster with levels in a
character class. You can jot down any stats on your key that you think you’ll
need to reference quickly (such as AC, hp, attack bonus, damage), but it’s
usually okay to go to the Monster Manual or other source when the encounter
starts. (Try to have the correct page flagged for easy access if you can.)
Tactics
Tactics can apply to either combat or roleplaying encounters, and they detail
the behavior of the monsters or NPCs. If the PCs do this, the monsters or
NPCs do that. You don’t have to come up with every contingency; just plan
out a primary action for the monster and a backup response if the PCs do
something unexpected.
In general, monsters of low intelligence don’t have any tactics more sophisti-
cated than “leap at the nearest character and try to kill or eat him or her.” On
the other hand, a clever villain with a number of options at his disposal (for
example, a high-level evil wizard) should begin a battle with a plan — a short
list of spells he’s likely to cast, an idea of which characters he wants to take
out of the fight first, and a plan for getting away or summoning reinforce-
ments if a fight goes poorly.
Rewards
When the encounter ends, what rewards do you have waiting for the player
characters? In addition to experience for defeating the monsters or accomplish-
ing the goal of the encounter, you might include some kind of treasure. Not
every encounter needs to provide a ton of treasure, though. Such indiscrimi-
nant gifting of loot has been referred to as Monty Hauls in the past, and often
210
Part III: Creating Adventures 

leads to problems that make the game less fun. Follow the guidelines pre-
sented in Chapter 14 (or page 51 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide) for creating
appropriate rewards, and if anything err a little on the side of being a bit
stingy when it comes to handing out gold and magic items.
Adding Depth to Dungeon Crawls
Most dungeon crawls, especially those created by first-time designers, are
designed with static encounters — encounters that don’t affect each other.
This means that Encounter 2 begins when the player characters reach that
spot on the map, with no regard as to what happened in Encounter 1 or what
might happen in Encounter 3. The player characters can arrive at any encounter
location whenever they want, stay for as long as they want, and come back later
to find the site just as they left it. 
Static adventure design is easy and straightforward. You don’t have to put
too much thought into how the occupants of the encounter areas relate to
each other or interact. All you need to figure out is what’s in the encounter
area and what happens when the player characters arrive there.
You can add more depth and realism to your dungeon crawl by designing
dynamic encounters. In a dynamic environment, there is evidence of intelli-
gent organization and cooperation between monsters in different encounter
areas. As the player characters move through the dungeon, the occupants
take actions to respond to the invaders. Perhaps patrols become more fre-
quent if the player characters leave evidence of their arrival behind them or
if they allow a monster to escape from an encounter area. Traps are reset,
areas are restocked with defenders, treasures are moved, and paths are
blocked off as the monsters work to defend the dungeon.
You can start small, just making a few encounters dynamic. Or you can go all
out and develop the whole dungeon as a dynamic environment. Dynamic
encounters are more challenging to create than static encounters, but the
reward in game play is worth it. In addition to a map and a key, you need to
work out a plan for the dynamic portions of the dungeon. In general, consider
these factors in your design for a dynamic dungeon:
 Defensive plans: Whether it’s the plans formulated by monsters in two
adjoining encounter areas, in a section of the dungeon, or across the
entire dungeon, you need to think about how the monsters react to the
threat posed by the player characters after that threat becomes obvi-
ous. Do they increase patrols and create more opportunities for wander-
ing monsters to encounter the PCs? Do they increase defenses by setting
(or resetting) traps, locking doors, and taking other protective mea-
sures? Do they increase the number of guards at particular encounter
sites, leaving less important or valuable areas less defended?
211
Chapter 15: The Dungeon Adventure

 Conditional requirements: Encounter areas need conditional require-
ments, which are events or situations that trigger escalated responses
from the monsters. A monster escaping to warn the rest of the complex,
for example, can be a conditional requirement. Examples of subtler con-
ditions include the PCs moving a statue, taking an item, springing a trap,
or opening a specific door. What do you want the player characters to
have to do to put the dungeon inhabitants on higher alert status? That’s
what goes into this section of your dungeon notes.
 Time frame: Make time a factor for your dynamic dungeon. Time pres-
sure can add tension and suspense to an adventure. And if the dungeon
changes depending on the time, it comes more alive. Are more or fewer
guards on duty at night? Do patrols move around according to a strict
schedule? Is something terrible going to happen at the stroke of mid-
night unless the player characters accomplish something? Use time to
make your dungeon dynamic.
 Long-term plans: To better understand how the inhabitants of the dun-
geon react in a dynamic situation, you need to have a grasp of their long-
term plans. What does your boss monster hope to accomplish? Does the
boss monster or villain NPC plan to send minions to raid the nearby town
three nights from now? Are the monsters cooperating to build a powerful
golem to unleash on the village? Is the villain NPC using the orcs to collect
the components he or she needs to cast a spell to release a demon from
captivity? Whatever the long-term plans, if you know what they are you
can use them to determine dynamic actions in your dungeon adventure.

Chapter 16
The Wilderness Adventure
In This Chapter
 Designing outdoor adventures and encounters
 Taking a look at the wilderness adventure structure
 Understanding how wilderness adventures differ from dungeon crawls
P
layer characters do not live in dungeons alone! Every once in a while,
you have to let them get out of the deep darkness and into the sunshine.
That’s where wilderness adventures come in. However, the entire adventure
doesn’t have to take place in the great outdoors. You can develop specific
encounters that take advantage of the wilderness and what it has to offer,
making them portions of a larger adventure. The sample adventure presented
in Chapter 20 handles wilderness areas in this manner, for example.
As with the dungeon, you can get as complex or keep it as simple as you like
with wilderness adventures. It all depends on your tastes and the need of the
story you want the adventure to tell. In this chapter, we examine the wilder-
ness as a full adventure and as specific encounters. We discuss how this type
of adventure is and isn’t like a dungeon crawl, and we give you some sugges-
tions as to how to get the most out of the wilderness in your D&D campaign.
Designing a Wilderness Adventure
You can make a very satisfying D&D game experience by starting and ending
every adventure you run in the dungeon. But there’s so much more to the
world than the dark and secret places that never see the light of the sun.
Player characters need to get out more. That’s where the wilderness adven-
ture (or encounter) comes in.

Do you want to know what the big secret to designing a wilderness adventure
is? Treat it like a dungeon! Outside areas can be handled just like any other
site-based adventure. Sites for the wilderness include the road (or path, or
trail), clearing, hill, forest, lake, garden, graveyard, and swamp. Map the site,
add monsters, and you have an encounter. String encounters together, and
you have an adventure.
What is the wilderness?
For the purposes of creating a D&D adventure, the wilderness is any outdoor
environment beyond the confines of the dungeon. When player characters
leave the safety and relative comfort of the town, village, or city, they enter
the wilderness. In the wilderness, the wild things roam. The maps are incom-
plete, and they say things like “Here Be Dragons” in the large open spaces to
signify — quite literally — that dragons and other monsters are present.
The trick to designing wilderness site-based encounters and adventures is to
treat them like dungeons. Never try to block out an entire trek through the
wilderness, as you want to map out and play only the exciting parts of the
trip. For long periods of travel, it’s okay to fade from one action scene to the
next with just a little narration to help progress the story and give a sense of
the passage of time. 
To make an ordinary wilderness into a D&D wilderness, you want to add
some elements of fantasy. Obviously, adding D&D monsters provides a fantas-
tic element, but you can go farther. Trees whose leaves sparkle in the night,
waterfalls that are miles high and drop between colossal sculptures of
ancient kings, and forests of ambulant plants are all examples of natural envi-
ronments that have had an infusion of the magical and fantastic.
The specific challenges, conditions, and terrain features of different types of
wilderness are discussed on pages 86–98 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
In the following subsections, we discuss some of the basic types of outdoor
environments that you can use in your wilderness adventures.
Deserts
Deserts are dry wastes. They can be hot and sandy or cold and ice-covered.
They are desolate regions where food and water are hard to find and survival
requires supplies, equipment, magic, skill, and more than a little luck.
Deserts often feature sporadic oases, extreme climates that might require
Survival checks or Fortitude saves, harsh weather, sand (or snow) storms,
sink holes, and other hazards.
214
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Forests
Forests make up much of the wilderness we imagine when we think of the
typical D&D world. Forests usually feature paths or roads, rivers, lakes, thick
clusters of trees and other vegetation, and the occasional clearing. A temper-
ate forest is one example of this type of environment. Others include arctic
conifer forests, rainforests, and jungles.
Finding food and water usually isn’t a problem in a forest, and except for the
occasional storm, the weather and climate generally don’t present a danger to
the player characters. What makes the forest dangerous are the animals and
creatures that roam the dark, dense places covered by the canopy of leaves.
Hills
Hills tend to provide topography more than environment, as forests and
deserts can both be hilly. From gently rolling mounds to craggy piles of rock,
hills provide an interesting environment to travel through or engage in a
deadly ambush. Hills are also good places to put entrances to dungeons and
monster lairs.
Mountains
When you think mountains, think about areas of jagged, barren rock that rise
above the tree line. Travel is difficult, requiring characters to climb or find
irregular paths up and down the rocky surfaces. Water is usually plentiful
(unless the mountains are in a desert), but food might be hard to come by,
especially in winter. Hazards include avalanches (which might be falling rocks
or sliding snow and ice), crumbling surfaces, and various monsters (which
might be dragons and other flying creatures that tend to like to lair high in
the mountains). Mountains are good places to put entrances to dungeons and
monster lairs.
Plains
Plains can be any of a number of flat terrain types, including savannas,
prairies, grasslands, tundra, and farmlands of all descriptions. Rolling hills
and bluffs sometimes break the monotony of these regions. Food and water,
although not as abundant as in the forest, are relatively easy to come by.
Although player characters can see a long way across the flat expanses in the
plains, they can, in turn, be seen from a far distance.
Swamps
Swamps, wetlands, and marshes are wet and teeming with life. Set at low ele-
vations and usually along the edge of a lake or river, there’s almost no way to
cross a swamp and remain dry. The ground might be spongy in places, muddy
in others, and completely under murky water everywhere else. Although water
215
Chapter 16: The Wilderness Adventure

is everywhere, it might not be safe to drink (see “Diseases,” on page 292 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide). Food in the form of fish and game is reasonably plenti-
ful. Deep in the swamp, player characters might encounter the lair of a witch or
a shaman, the hiding place of a dark shrine, or the ruins of some ancient tower.
Oceans
The first requirement of an ocean adventure is a means of transportation. A
number of spells and abilities allow the player characters to venture into or
onto the water for a short time (for example, a water breathing spell or a
carpet of flying), but if they expect to travel more than a couple miles from
shore or remain at sea for more than an hour or two, they need to purchase,
hire, or confiscate a ship for their use (see “Transport,” on page 132 of the
Player’s Handbook). Assuming their vessel is well-provisioned, food and water
aren’t really a problem. Adventurers sometimes find themselves undertaking
epic voyages to visit haunted islands, search out pirate lairs, hunt sea mon-
sters, or descend below the waves to explore the ruins of sunken cities.
216
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Underdark
The vastest and most perilous wilderness in many D&D settings is the
Underdark — a boundless realm of interconnecting caverns, rifts, vaults, and
dungeons far below the surface. Many dungeons at their lowest levels lead
into the Underdark. The Underdark is the domain of terrible monsters such
as aboleths and mind flayers and home to the sinister and cruel drow, or dark
elves. Most of the Underdark consists of natural caverns, some so large that
whole cities lie within, so the landscape is similar to a conventional dungeon
environment in many ways. Water and food can be hard to find, but a more
pressing concern to the traveler is the presence of all sorts of malevolent and
hungry monsters. In the depths of the Underdark, the heroes might visit a
cavern-castle of the drow, venture into the twisted maze of a fell lich, or blun-
der into a watery shrine of the insane kuo-toa. 
How to use the wilderness
Often, you will use wilderness encounters as framing sequences for your
adventures. Do the player characters need to get to the Pyramid of Bala-
Tuum? First, they need to cross the Desert of One Thousand Dangers! Do
they need to find the Cave of the Lost Clan? Then they have to explore the
terrible Storm Mountain to find it. These present travel encounters for you to
use. Sure, you could say, “You travel for 30 days and 30 nights across the burn-
ing desert until you see the ancient pyramid rising out of the sand ahead of you.”
But a better, more exciting option is to have a few encounters in the wilder-
ness as the player characters make the journey.
You can even set an entire adventure in the great outdoors. For example, you
might send the player characters into the Whispering Swamp to discover
what has turned the murky water into blood. Or you might have them hired
on as guards for a caravan intent on crossing the Zarven Plains. 
In all cases, treat each encounter as a site or location, even if the area contin-
ues beyond the scope of your graph paper. Use clusters of trees, rocky forma-
tions, water, and other natural boundaries as the “walls” of your outdoor
dungeon. Then populate each encounter, as we discuss in Chapters 14 and 15.
Wilderness Adventure Outline
The following list provides an example outline for a wilderness adventure.
Use it as a guide when you create your own wilderness encounters and
adventures. In this example, the player characters begin a trip to reach the
city of Paragon on the Jagged Coast.
217
Chapter 16: The Wilderness Adventure

 Encounter 1: The Silver Hills. On the third day into the trip, the PCs are
ambushed by ogres where the road cuts through the Silver Hills. Map:
ambush site, road, hills, and hidden ogre bands.
 Encounter 2: The Forest Shrine. On the fifth day of the trip, the road
enters the Dark Woods, a dangerous forest often avoided by most travel-
ers. Within the forest, in a clearing, the Shrine of the Unicorn has been
corrupted by an annis hag. The hag decides to lure the PCs to the shrine
so that she can sacrifice them to her dark god. Map: forest trail, clearing,
corrupted shrine, and the annis hag’s lair.
 Encounter 3: The Lonely Swamp. On the eighth day of the trip, the road
winds around the Lonely Swamp. The PCs come across the remains of a
merchant caravan that appears to have been attacked on its way from
Paragon to Griffonford. A badly wounded caravan guard tells the PCs
what happened and asks them to enter the swamp to recover the parcel
they were carrying and the sorcerer who was protecting it. “She is the
daughter of the lord of Paragon,” he gasps, “and the item must be recov-
ered at all costs.” Map: swamp, shambling mound encounter areas, and
the mad wizard’s lair.
This is just an example of how to structure a wilderness adventure. Don’t try
to play out every second of travel. Get to the action and run those encoun-
ters, but don’t try to narrate every step along the way.
218
Part III: Creating Adventures 
Putting the wilderness in your dungeon
Another option for using wilderness encoun-
ters is to just put them in your dungeon. For
example, create an ice cavern, a chamber filled 
with a subterranean swamp, or an underground
forest of mushrooms as tall as trees. The world
of D&D is permeated with magic, after all, and
you have every right to put a blazing hot desert
in one dungeon room and a lake as deep as the
ocean in another. That way, even if you and the
other players never want to leave the comfort-
able confines of the dungeon, you can present
different climates and environmental hazards
for the player characters to overcome.

Chapter 17
The Event-Based Adventure
In This Chapter
 Designing event-based adventures
 Using timelines and flowcharts
A
ll adventures have a story. Some stories are implied by the encounters;
others are central to the adventure. In this chapter, we examine the
event-based adventure and talk about how you can set up adventures that
are more complex than simple dungeon crawls. By using events and the
actions of the player characters to drive the plot forward, you can create sur-
prisingly rich stories that play out through your adventures.
Designing Event-Based Adventures
What do we mean by an event-based adventure? Instead of letting encounter
areas on a map drive the adventure (and thus build the story), specific
events drive the progress of these types of adventures. Events can be off
stage (the player characters might have no way to influence them) or on stage
(the events are specifically triggered by the actions of the player characters).
And in all cases, later parts of the story are “unlocked” or “opened” by the
actions the player characters perform.
Examples of events that can serve as the catalysts for adventures include a
spreading plague, the arrival of a merchant caravan, the coronation of a new
king, a series of murders, a string of robberies, and even the phases of the
moon.
The reactions of the player characters change the events that can occur, or the
order in which things happen, or both. This type of adventure focuses on trying
to accomplish a specific quest or mission, and the encounters build upon that
effort. There’s usually more to an event-based adventure than “explore the dun-
geon” or “kill all the monsters.” Event-based adventures are sometimes called
story-based adventures, because the structure is more like a book or movie
than an exploration of a site.

The basic difference between a dungeon crawl and an event-based adventure
is that you build an event-based adventure with encounters keyed to events
instead of to locations. The two best methods for plotting and organizing an
event-based adventure are the flowchart and the timeline. We discuss both of
these methods in the following sections.
The flowchart
When you create an event-based adventure, one way to organize your
encounters is by using a flowchart. You want to create at least a few paths
through the adventure so that the players don’t feel that their characters are
being railroaded through events to the conclusion you want to happen. You
can accomplish this in many ways, but we show you one method that doesn’t
take a lot of work and sets up an adventure that feels wide open from the
players’ point of view.
Imagine the flowchart as if/then statements that lead from one encounter or
event to the next. The branches that flow from each encounter can be as few
as one or two, or as many as you’re comfortable handling. Certainly, you
don’t want to design such a complex flowchart that many portions of the
adventure you’ve prepared will never get used. But you do want to present at
least the illusion of choice for the player characters.
Think of a flowchart as a dungeon. The player characters explore each
encounter in the flowchart, just as they explore each chamber in the dun-
geon. They might take the left-hand path, or they might decide to forge
straight ahead. 
A simple flowchart presents an encounter with two choices that each lead to
another encounter with two choices. Then paths lead to one of two encoun-
ters that lead to the climactic encounter. Figure 17-1 shows this basic
encounter flowchart.

Part III: Creating Adventures 

So, using an example of “murder as event” to build this adventure, here’s how
the key to the first encounter in this flowchart might look.
Encounter 1: The player characters, while walking through the town of Blue
Oaks late at night, hear some kind of commotion coming from a nearby alley.
It sounds like a struggle of some sort is taking place. A terrible scream marks
the end of the struggle, and the PCs and the night watch arrive in the alley
from different directions at almost the same moment. A body is sprawled
across the alley floor, and blood is splattered everywhere. An examination of
the area shows no sign of the murderer, but the body — that of a barkeep
who was well known in town — has been slashed with what appears to have
been vicious claws. The man’s left arm was ripped off and is nowhere to be
seen. 
The watch officer says that this is the fifth such murder in as many nights.
Each victim was missing different body parts: the right leg was taken from the
first victim, the right arm from the second victim, the torso from the third
victim, and the left leg from the fourth victim. Each victim seemed to have
been attacked after leaving the Open Door Inn, the same establishment where
the latest victim worked. He also explains that the watch is at a loss as to
what to do. If the player characters can help, the town would appreciate it.
The town scholar, a wizard named Avolid, examined all the bodies and may
know more. The hour is late, but perhaps some sense of this violence can be
made in the morning.
If the PCs want to investigate the Open Door Inn, then go to Encounter 2.
If the PCs want to talk to the town scholar, then go to Encounter 3.
Fill in each encounter area with a challenge, roleplaying, or combat encounter,
leaving clues that provide paths to the next encounters shown on the flow-
chart. One way this adventure might turn out is that the player characters
keep being led back to Avolid, the town scholar. This unassuming wizard has
turned to necromancy and the dark arts and is using a troll to murder town
folk and collect body parts for his dark project — he’s building a flesh golem!
The climax encounter occurs after the flesh golem is animated — the player
characters must defeat it and its dark master before it rampages through 
the town.
The timeline
Another method for setting up an event-based adventure is the timeline.
When you build an adventure around a timeline, things happen despite the
actions of the player characters, and there is often a sense of tension and
pressure created by the advancing clock. The adventure kicks off with an
event that clearly appears to be the first step in an unfolding plot. Time (or at
221
Chapter 17: The Event-Based Adventure

least, the illusion of time) becomes as much an opponent and obstacle as the
villains and monsters you use to populate the adventure.
What do we mean? Well, there really isn’t a ticking clock counting down to
some terrible explosion, but you certainly want the player characters to feel
that way. The truth is that although you have outlined a timeline for events in
the adventure, you as the Dungeon Master get to decide when to advance the
adventure along the timeline. As long as the players are having fun and
accomplishing things, hold off unveiling the next event in the line. When the
players get bogged down, lose their way, or become bored, that’s the time to
advance to the next event.
The timeline lays out how and when events in the story take place.
Sometimes the player characters can do things to delay or speed up the
occurrence of these events, and sometimes they can alter events or unlock
new paths through the timeline, depending on the adventure you’ve created. 
A typical timeline can be simple and straightforward, describing events that
will happen at specific moments in the adventure. One way to do this is with
simple descriptions:
1. The first night, 2 a.m.: A man is attacked and murdered about two
blocks from the Open Door Inn. His right leg is removed by the murderer
and taken away. 
2. The second night, 1 a.m.: The next murder takes place, near the stables.
The victim is found with the right arm missing.
3. The third, fourth, and fifth nights: Another murder happens on each
subsequent night, and each time, another part of the victim’s body is
removed. The murderer has now collected a right leg, right arm, torso,
left leg, and left arm.
4. The sixth night, 3 a.m.: The last murder will take place in the town
square. This time the murderer needs the victim’s head and the brain
housed inside it.
Another way to set up a timeline adventure is by setting the events for spe-
cific times, but building an open-exploration area where the player characters
can investigate as they see fit until the next event takes place. You might set
up a timeline with open-exploration areas between events as follows:
1. Event 1, 2 a.m.: The PCs hear the struggle and screams as the fifth
murder occurs. The PCs may investigate any or all of the following
before Event 2 occurs:
• The murder site (roleplaying or challenge encounter)
• Avolid’s magic shop (roleplaying encounter)
222
Part III: Creating Adventures 

• The victim’s residence (roleplaying encounter)
• The sewer network (challenge or combat encounter)
• The old warehouse (challenge or combat encounter)
2. Event 2, 2 a.m.: The sixth and last murder takes place.
In this model, you set up the parts of the town that the player characters can
explore and the people they can meet to ask questions of. The player charac-
ters can visit these sites in any order, providing the illusion of a wide-open
story and player control. You need to prepare roleplaying, challenge, and
combat encounters (for explanations of the different kinds of encounters, see
Chapter 3). When they have almost run out of things to do, the next event
occurs. This opens up new parts of the town to explore, new suspects and
witnesses to talk to, and new dangers as the PCs get that much closer to solv-
ing the mystery. 
You can even combine a flowchart and a timeline to make a more integrated
and complex adventure. It all depends on the story you want to set up.
Using Flowcharts and Timelines 
in Dungeons
There’s no reason not to try to design a dungeon crawl adventure that also
uses a flowchart or a timeline. These can add greater depth to the story and
a touch of drama and realism not necessarily available in a typical dungeon
crawl.
When you’re designing a dungeon, you can use a flowchart to determine how
the dungeon denizens react to the actions of the player characters. For exam-
ple, if the player characters defeat Palehorn the Minotaur, then Tusenmaug
the Dragon puts the guards in rooms 7, 8, 9, and 10 on high alert. A flowchart
can also be useful for tracking the main villain. If the player characters
disarm the trap in room 13, then Vlanis the Vile moves to room 16 to unleash
the hell hounds.
A timeline provides the same tension and time pressure in a dungeon envi-
ronment as it does in any adventure setting. Perhaps the dungeon is slowly
filling with water, flooding rooms and corridors at a predefined pace. Or an
earthquake threatens to destroy the entire dungeon complex, with parts col-
lapsing as time passes. The time pressure can also be more subtle, as in
these examples:
223
Chapter 17: The Event-Based Adventure

 The number of guards and patrols increase as time passes.
 More monsters arrive in response to a summons by the dungeon’s arch
villain.
 The arch villain is getting closer and closer to completing the evil cere-
mony with each passing hour the player characters spend lost or explor-
ing the complex.
Try any or all of these options as you create adventures for your game group.
If something doesn’t work, improvise your way through the current adven-
ture and try again the next time. Remember that the players don’t know what
you’ve planned, so if you need to make adjustments behind the screen, go
ahead and do it. Nothing in your adventure notes really happens until it takes
place in the game.
If the PCs get stuck and aren’t sure what to do next, you can keep the adven-
ture from coming to a halt by having a monster or NPC show up, kick in the
proverbial door, and attack the PCs on the spot. The sudden appearance of a
new threat injects some tension into the adventure and gives the players a
chance to refocus. The seemingly random encounter also allows you to plant
a clue on the assailant that will help the PCs get on the right track about what
to do next.

The Randomly Generated
Adventure
In This Chapter

 Creating a dungeon with random rolls
 Generating a random monster
 Determining random treasure
S
ometimes, you just don’t have enough time beforehand to prepare an
adventure for a D&D game. Maybe you and your friends spontaneously
decided to play some D&D, and you need to come up with something fast.
Maybe you found yourself with time to kill, but you need a little help to start
your creative juices flowing. Whatever the reason, you might find that gener-
ating a dungeon full of monsters with random die rolls is the best way to start
playing fast.
In this chapter, we take a brief look at how you can use random-generation
tables to create a random dungeon and stock it with monsters for the player
characters to fight. We also provide you with a random-dungeon-generation
system — all you need is a couple d10s and the tables in this chapter to
quickly and easily create and populate a fun dungeon with no prep time at all.
In fact, you can actually use this chapter to make up the dungeon on the fly,
while you’re playing!
Using the Random-Generation Tables
The tables in this chapter provide you with all you need to randomly gener-
ate a complete dungeon.
Note that random generation can have some strange results. Feel free to modify,
ignore, or roll again if you wind up with results that don’t make sense to you.

To use the tables, follow these steps:
1. Choose the base Encounter Level (EL) and roll a surface setting for the
dungeon on Table 18-1.
2. Choose a first room configuration from the options shown in Figure 18-1.
Copy the room layout to a pad of graph paper.
3. When the players choose to explore a corridor originating in the first
room, roll on Table 18-2. Make a new roll on this table every 30 feet the
corridor travels. Some results on this table will send you to other tables
in this chapter; just follow the directions.
4. When the players choose to open a door in the first room or a door they
find in a corridor, roll on Table 18-5, and then on Table 18-6. Some results
on Table 18-6 will send you to other tables in this chapter; just follow the
directions.
5. If the tables indicate an encounter with a wandering monster or the con-
tents of a chamber turn out to include a monster, use Tables 18-12, 18-13,
or 18-14 (1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level Dungeon Encounters, as appropriate for
the base EL) to determine what sort of creature the player characters
meet. You can find monster statistics in the Monster Manual.
6. If the tables indicate that a room contains treasure, use Tables 18-15,
18-16, or 18-17 to generate a random 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level treasure, as
appropriate. You can find gem, art object, and magic item descriptions
in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. 
Most of the die rolls you need to make to use the tables in this chapter
require you to roll percentile dice. In D&D shorthand, percentile dice are
called d%. Use two ten-sided dice; read one die as the tens place, and the
other die as the ones place. Treat a 00 roll as a roll of 100, not 0.
Keeping Track of a Random Dungeon
Although creating a random dungeon by using the method we describe in the
preceding section doesn’t require much (if any) upfront work, you still need
to create a map and a key to keep track of what’s in the dungeon and what
the player characters have encountered or discovered:
 Map: The map shows where the chambers, corridors, doors, and other
features of the dungeon are; you use a pad of graph paper to draw your
dungeon map as the dice dictate.
Alternatively, you can create a random dungeon by simply sketching out
whatever arrangement of corridors, chambers, and caverns you like, but
leaving the contents of the dungeon’s rooms undetermined. You don’t
226
Part III: Creating Adventures 

even have to draw the map yourself — any map in a published adven-
ture or sourcebook can be stripped of its key and repopulated by the
random monsters and treasure described in this chapter. All you need to
do is record the details of what the player characters find in each room
on your key.
 Key: The key consists of whatever notes you make to describe the exact
contents of each room as the player characters encounter them. Usually,
it works best to keep the key on a pad of simple notebook paper and use
identifying numbers or letters (room A, room 2, whatever) to tie the map
and the key together.
Starting Your Random Dungeon
Creating a random dungeon begins with two DM decisions — the base
Encounter Level and the first room configuration. After these two decisions,
you can sit back and allow die rolls to take over. The random-map-generation
system we describe in the “Generating the Dungeon Map” section, later in
this chapter, helps you to create the physical layout of passages and rooms
that make up the dungeon, and the random-encounter system we describe in
the “Rolling a Random Encounter” section helps you stock those rooms with
monsters and villains for the player characters to fight.
Base Encounter Level
The base Encounter Level is simply the level of most encounters you expect
to generate in the adventure. This should be close to the average level of the
player characters in the party. For example, if the player characters average
6th level, your base Encounter Level (EL) should be 6. When you generate
random encounters to fill the rooms in your dungeon, begin on the 6th-level
Dungeon Encounters table on page 79 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. The
dungeon encounters tables are built so that a chance exists that any particu-
lar 6th-level encounter might shift down to the 5th-level table or bounce up to
the 7th-level table, but 80 percent of the encounters will be EL 6 — a single
CR 6 monster, two CR 4 monsters, or any combination that results in an
encounter suitable for 6th-level characters.
You can find random dungeon encounter tables for levels 1 through 20 on
pages 79–81 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. 
For your convenience, we’ve duplicated the 1st-level through 3rd-level
encounter tables in this book. If you’re creating a random adventure for 1st-
or 2nd-level characters, the tables in this chapter should suffice.
227
Chapter 18: The Randomly Generated Adventure

First room configuration
If you don’t create the whole map ahead of time, you need to pick a starting
point for your randomly generated map. All our random dungeons begin with a
stairway descending from some feature on the surface down into a first room —
the place where the player characters enter the dungeon for the first time. To
determine what lies above the dungeon, roll a d% and look up the resulting
number in Table 18-1 or choose a result that strikes you as interesting.

61–65
Desolate cemetery or forgotten mausoleum
66–95

96–100
None; the dungeon was built as a concealed

When you know what’s above the dungeon, you can choose an appropriate
length for the stairs leading from the surface feature down into the labyrinth
below. In general, the stairs descend from 10 to 40 feet; longer stairways usu-
ally consist of several shorter flights. 
Now choose one of the room designs shown in Figure 18-1 and draw it in the
center of the graph paper you’re going to use for your dungeon map. Each of
these configurations offers several exits leading in different directions, so you
can’t be sure where the randomly generated map might lead. The stairway
marked “start” leads back up to the surface and is the place where the player
characters begin their adventure.
228
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Generating the Dungeon Map
From the first room, the player characters can begin to explore the dungeon
by opening a door or proceeding down one of the open corridors. 
Tables 18-2 through 18-4 describe corridors. Make a check on Table 18-2 when
the player characters reach any point marked “?” in the first room configura-
tion. This check tells you what lies in that direction. Every 6 squares (30 feet)
that the player characters advance along the corridor after that, roll another
check on Table 18-2. Corridors often feature branching passages, turns, side-
passages or side-doors, or just lead into a chamber with no door at all. 
If you begin by checking a door in your first room or when Table 18-2 indicates
a door in a corridor the player characters are exploring, go to Table 18-5 to
determine whether the door is locked, stuck, or trapped. Table 18-6 describes
what lies on the other side of the door. This may be another corridor (in which
case you’ll go back to Table 18-2 to see how far it goes and in what direction) or
a chamber of some kind.

As your randomly generated dungeon map expands, corridors or rooms
might hit the edge of your piece of graph paper. You can address this in one
of two ways:
 Exercise some discretion and alter the random results to produce a dun-
geon that fits on the piece of graph paper. 
 Simply continue your dungeon onto another piece of paper.

Depending on the twists and turns your dice generate, a corridor might
double back and run into a part of the dungeon that’s already been mapped.
You can choose to make your current corridor into a dead end so that it
won’t disrupt what you’ve already mapped. Or you can have your corridor
meet the already-mapped corridor or chamber in a secret door — clearly, 
the player characters missed it when they were exploring the area on the
other side.

At your discretion, streams or chasms may lead to other levels of the dun-
geon. You can treat a stream as a “corridor” of the appropriate dimensions
that eventually emerges in a new starting area for a dungeon. Whether the
stream corridor has any air or is completely filled with water (and thus is
potentially lethal to unprepared characters) is up to you.

may have numerous alcoves or niches.
You can align a chamber with the door or corridor entering it in any way 
you like.
Most dungeon chambers should have walls at least 5 feet thick separating
them from neighboring rooms or corridors. When you draw a chamber on
your map, you can add a 5-foot foyer to act as a spacer between the door and
the room specified in Table 18-7.
All chambers begin with one exit — the door, archway, or stair by which the
player characters enter the room. Chambers may have additional exits, as
shown on Table 18-8.

If you get any of the following results when rolling for Table 18-10, a few extra
notes apply:
 Chasm or crevice: The room is divided by a chasm 2d4 × 10 feet deep.
To determine width, roll d%: 01–40, 5 feet; 41–85, 10 feet; 86–95, 15 feet;
96–100, 20 feet. To determine whether the chasm is bridged, roll d%:
01–50, no bridge; 51–70, log or plank bridge (Balance DC 10); 71–100,
wood or stone footbridge.
237

 Floor: The chamber has a difficult floor. Roll d% to determine floor type:
01–40, uneven flagstone; 41–80, hewn stone; 81–95, light rubble; 96–100,
dense rubble. See Floors, page 60 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
 Pool or lake: The room features a body of water. Roll d%: 01–50, pool;
51–100, lake. A pool takes up about 1 to 4 squares, and is 5 feet deep. A
lake takes up about half of the squares in the room, and is 1d4 × 5 feet
deep. In a small room, there isn’t much difference between a lake and 
a pool.
 Trap: The traps mentioned in the table are located in or around features,
furnishings, or exits. If you don’t know where else to place a trap, roll
1d4: if 1, set the trap in the northwest quadrant of room; 2, northeast
quadrant of room; 3, southeast quadrant of room; 4, southwest quadrant
of room. Any monsters in the chamber know about the trap and avoid it.

begin a new map. Choose another room configuration from Figure 18-1. If the
player characters descend by means of a ladder or vertical shaft, replace the
stairs marked on Figure 18-1 with the appropriate feature.
Rolling a Random Encounter
Player characters exploring a dungeon might encounter wandering monsters as
they explore the various corridors and passages, as well as monsters guarding
treasure in various chambers. To determine what monster(s) the player char-
acters face when they kick in the door in a random dungeon, consult Tables
18-12 through 18-14, as appropriate for your dungeon’s base Encounter Level.
238
Part III: Creating Adventures 

For a random dungeon, you can assume that deeper is more dangerous.
When the player characters descend to a new, unexplored dungeon level,
increase the base Encounter Level by 1. For example, instead of rolling
encounters on the 1st-level monster table (see Table 18-12), roll encounters
on the 2nd-level monster table (see Table 18-13).
When these tables list a die range before a monster’s name, that means you
roll the appropriate die to determine how many monsters are actually present.
For example, if the PCs encounter 1d3+1 goblin warriors, roll 1d3 (generating a
1, 2, or 3), then add 1 — so the PCs might encounter 2, 3, or 4 goblins. We
include the page number where the monster can be found in the Monster
Manual (abbreviated as MM) in the tables.

Not all encounters on Table 18-12 are automatically hostile to the player char-

Player’s Handbook). Perhaps they’re fellow adventurers, engaged in exploring
the same dungeon, or they might be guards whose task it is to make sure that
dangerous monsters do not escape from the dungeon.

Part III: Creating Adventures 

Generating Random Treasure
What’s the point of risking life and limb in some dismal, monster-infested
dungeon if the player characters don’t come home with a king’s ransom in
gold, gems, and wondrous magic items?
To generate a random treasure, roll three times on Table 18-15—once for coins,
once for goods, and once for items. (If the player characters find the treasure
on levels 2 or 3 of the dungeon, use Tables 18-16 or 18-17, as appropriate.) It’s
possible that a treasure might have no coins but still have goods and items or
any combination of the three types of valuables. To determine the exact gems,
art objects, and items found, refer to Tables 18-18 through 18-20.
Tables 18-15 through 18-17 repeat the first three entries found on the treasure
table on page 52 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. We’ve taken a couple shortcuts
with the gems, art objects, and other valuables. You can create higher-level
treasures by using the table on pages 52–53 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

Dungeon Master’s Guide. Many more items appear on the random magic item
charts in the Dungeon Master’s Guide; Table 18-19 offers just a sample of the
items you might find in a randomly determined treasure.
Treasure isn’t always found lying in tidy piles on the dungeon floor. When you
create a random dungeon treasure, you might want to add a little detail by
finding an appropriate container or containers for the treasure, as deter-
mined by Table 18-20.

Even if a monster doesn’t have a chest for its treasure, intelligent monsters
usually look for some way to conceal their hoards, stashing them out of sight.
Player characters who defeat the monsters and traps guarding a room would
be well advised to look around and search in likely places, just in case the
monster has a hoard hidden somewhere nearby.
Finishing a Random Dungeon
The last bit of advice we have for running a random dungeon is simple: At
any time you choose, you can dispense with the dice and simply select the
option from the table that you like best. 
Also, rather than continue to expand your dungeon at random indefinitely,
you may choose to limit the size and expansion of a randomly built dungeon
any time you like — all you need do is decide that passageways come to dead
ends, chambers have no other exits, and stairs no longer lead to lower levels. 
You can even use a dungeon you generate through random rolls as a spring-
board for a purposefully designed adventure.

The High-Level Adventure
In This Chapter
 Understanding the challenges of DMing a high-level game
 Dealing with new player character abilities
 Presenting different types of high-level adventures
G
aining levels is one of the best parts of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game.
Players are rewarded for their time, effort, and cleverness with new,
interesting character abilities; mighty magic items; great honor and responsi-
bility within the game world; and more sheer power to overcome the chal-
lenges they face. Adversaries such as orcs, ogres, and ghouls no longer pose
a significant threat to the player characters — instead, they face more awe-
some and deadly foes such as dragons, demons, or giants.
Over the course of time, the steady acquisition of new, powerful spells and
feats transforms the player characters. Not only do they hit things harder
and stand up to more damage, they gain capabilities that simply have no par-
allel at lower levels. With a little preparation, every character in the party can
fly, turn invisible, or become immune to particular types of damage. The
player characters gain the ability to spy on distant enemies with scrying
magic, leave a dungeon instantly by means of spells such as teleport, or even
bring dead characters back to life. 
Creating adventures that challenge characters that can fly, teleport, and bring
back the dead is a little hard, but it’s still possible. Some tricks and traps you
counted on in lower-level adventures just won’t work anymore; this chapter
helps you design adventures that take the player characters’ fantastic high-
level capabilities into account. 

Understanding Why the Game Changes
The first step in building good high-level adventures is to understand how
and why the D&D game transforms at higher levels. The game begins to shift
from heroic to superheroic somewhere between 9th and 13th level because
characters gain access to game-changing spells:
 At 9th level, clerics and wizards acquire access to 5th-level spells, which
include spells such as dominate person, raise dead, and teleport. 
 At 11th level, clerics and wizards gain 6th-level spells, which include
such choices as antimagic field, heal, and overland flight. 
 At 13th level, these same characters gain the ability to cast 7th-level
spells such as mass invisibility, resurrection, and vision. 
Over the same level range, the expected value of the player characters’
wealth (or magic items) increases from about 36,000 gp to 110,000 gp — for
each character! (See Table 5-1 on page 135 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.)
Although you don’t have to adhere to the character wealth guidelines, the
game generally assumes that you are doing so. That means even the fighters
and rogues in the party are likely to gain powerful and useful magic items
such as boots of speed, wings of flying, or a ring of invisibility.
Generally, the changes that take place over this level range begin to affect
adventure design in five principal ways (mobility magic, the attack gap, save-
or-die spells, divination magic, and character specialization), as we discuss in
the following sections.
Mobility magic
The first characteristic of a high-level adventuring party is its access to
highly useful mobility magic — spells such as fly, dimension door, water
breathing, teleport, and to a lesser extent, polymorph. Magic items that grant
similar abilities, such as winged boots, certainly belong in this category, too.
Mobility magic has two major effects on the game: It means that the player
characters become adept at ignoring obstacles and using tactical mobility to
arrange unfair combat against monsters.
Ignoring obstacles
When all the characters in the party can fly, vertical obstacles such as
chasms, cliffs, or pits no longer matter. Instead of channeling the player char-
acters into exploring in a different direction, a chasm now becomes a road,
offering the player characters the ability to travel throughout its length and
depth. For that matter, many horizontal obstacles — cavern lakes, gardens

full of carnivorous plants, lava rivers, and so on — can be crossed with
impunity. All it takes is a sorcerer who’s willing to use up some of his 3rd-
level spell slots to bestow a fly spell on everyone in the party.
Just as flying means the end of vertical obstacles in your game, teleportation
takes away time and distance as impediments to the player characters. An
arduous desert crossing you planned as part of your adventure is now com-
pletely mitigated by a single spell — the player characters simply teleport to
the other side and carry on with what they were doing. Adventures that
hinge on tight timelines are equally likely to be busted by teleportation
magic; instantaneous travel makes it hard for the player characters to miss
catching up to the bad guys.
The upshot of all this is that mobility magic makes most physical obstacles 
in your game useless. Go ahead and include them if you like, but dizzying
chasms or foreboding mountain ranges are only interesting scenery for high-
level parties.
Tactical mobility
Not only is mobility magic good for bypassing physical obstacles, it’s also good
for making monsters look bad. Any ground-bound creature without a ranged
attack is simply dead meat for a party of flying characters. Why mix it up with
the iron golem or fiendish tyrannosaurus when these melee bashers can be cut
to pieces with archery and magical attacks from the safety of the air? 
To challenge the players, make sure that most creatures the PCs encounter
have ranged attacks, cooperate with flying monsters, can fly themselves, or
guard a room or chamber with a ceiling low enough that airborne PCs can’t
stay completely out of reach.
The widening attack gap
At 1st level, the difference between a fighter’s melee ability and a wizard’s
melee ability is probably about 4 points or so — the fighter has a base attack
bonus of +1 to the wizard’s +0, a Strength score about 4 to 6 points higher
than the wizard, and might or might not have the Weapon Focus feat. A mon-
ster that the fighter hits 50 percent of the time, the wizard hits 30 percent of
the time. A monster that the wizard hits 50 percent of the time, the fighter
hits 70 percent of the time. This is a significant difference, but it isn’t broken.
By the time characters hit 12th level, this gap is much more significant. The
difference in base attack bonus is now 6 points, the difference in Strength
scores has grown to 10 or 12 points, and the fighter definitely has Weapon
Focus and Greater Weapon Focus. The fighter probably has a much better
magic weapon than the wizard, too. Now the fighter’s attack bonus is about
251
Chapter 19: The High-Level Adventure

12 or 13 points higher than the wizard’s attack bonus, and probably as much
as 6 or 7 points better than the cleric’s attack bonus. A monster that the
fighter hits 50 percent of the time, the cleric only hits 20 percent of the time,
and the wizard only hits on a roll of 20. A monster that the wizard hits 50 per-
cent of the time, the fighter never misses. Rogues do almost as well as fight-
ers because they usually rely on Dexterity-based attacks.
Now, it’s true that the wizard shouldn’t be attempting many melee attacks by
the time he or she reaches 12th level (heck, by the time he or she reaches
2nd level, really). But what the widening attack gap means is that you have to
decide whether a monster you include in the adventure is there to threaten
(and be threatened by) the fighter, the cleric, or the wizard. If the circum-
stances of combat develop in such a way that the wrong character is in 
melee with the monster, you have a bad mismatch. The encounter suddenly
becomes too easy or too deadly for the player characters.
The best answer to the widening attack gap is to avoid monolithic encounters
where all the monsters are the same. It’s better to have two or three different
types of monsters in an encounter, some better at dueling with the fighter,
some equipped with other ways (such as spells or supernatural abilities) to
attack the cleric or wizard.
Save-or-die spells
As spellcasters rise in level, the spells they gain access to become more and
more destructive. In particular, spells that kill or completely incapacitate an
opponent with a single failed saving throw begin to appear around the time
characters reach 9th level, and they become more prevalent and more dan-
gerous from that point forward. Because these spells can take a monster out
of a fight in a single round, they’re often referred to as save-or-die spells.
Good examples include disintegrate, dominate person, finger of death, and hold
monster.
The difficulty these spells create in high-level games is that the consequences
of a monster failing a saving throw go from significant (taking 6d6 damage
instead of 3d6 for failing a save against a sorcerer’s fireball, say) to decisive
(instant death for failing a save against destruction). They’re very swingy,
which means that a powerful all-or-nothing spell might wipe out the encounter
you’ve planned for the PCs, or it might not help them at all. Do you balance
the encounter under the expectation that the party’s spellcasters will take out
some of the bad guys right at the start with save-or-die spells? What happens
if the monsters get lucky and succeed on their saving throws? Now you’ve got
an encounter that suddenly looks way too tough for the player characters. To
reduce the impact of save-or-die spells cast by the PCs, include the occasional
monster with an immunity to such spells — some examples are constructs,
dragons, outsiders, and undead.
252
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Many of the monsters the player characters encounter at higher levels
employ save-or-die spells and effects of their own. Again, these can be very
swingy encounters. Even if the player characters all have Fortitude saves of
+12 or higher, a Difficulty Class (or DC) 19 death effect — for example, a lich’s
circle of death spell — probably kills at least one character in the party. We
guarantee you that the unlucky player isn’t having much fun for the rest of
that battle. The PCs can guard themselves against such attacks if they expect
them. Encourage the players to use divination magic, information gathering,
and to listen to your clues in order to be prepared for such a dangerous
opponent’s save-or-die spells.
Divination magic
Just as mobility magic takes all sorts of physical obstacles out of the DM’s
toolbox, divination magic defeats information obstacles — situations where a
lack of some necessary piece of information prevents the player characters
from advancing through the adventure. For example, if the PCs don’t know
where the evil high priest’s hidden shrine is located, they can’t go confront
him. Before they can defeat their enemy and conclude the adventure, they
have to find out where his stronghold is by piecing together clues, interrogat-
ing minions, searching likely spots, or generally going to some effort to figure
it out. But high-level characters have access to spells that can defeat impedi-
ments of this sort just as easily as a fly spell defeats a chasm.
The divination spells most often used to bust through information obstacles
include scrying, greater scrying, commune, and vision. Player characters can
also overcome information shortfalls by capturing one of the monsters or vil-
lains and using magical compulsion to discover what their captive knows
(which is usually more than the PCs do). Spells such as suggestion or domi-
nate person can make the most loyal minion of the Big Bad Evil Guy spill
everything he, she, or it knows.
Fortunately, the game includes several defenses against hostile divination
magic. You should give at least some of the villains of a high-level adventure
defenses against easy scrying. Spells such as detect scrying, mind blank,
Mordenkainen’s private sanctum, and nondetection — or magic items replicating
these effects — are an extremely useful part of any evil mastermind’s arsenal.
Even villains who don’t have access to magic that can prevent divination
spells can limit their exposure with some everyday information discipline.
For example, an evil mastermind doesn’t need to tell every thug, minion, or
monster in his hidden fortress what his ultimate plan is or where he goes
when he isn’t there. Exceedingly clever and subtle villains might actually sow
disinformation in the player characters’ path by telling a minion the wrong
plan, and then sending him out to battle the PCs with the expectation that
the minion will be captured and compelled to tell the PCs everything he
knows — thereby setting a diabolic trap!
253
Chapter 19: The High-Level Adventure

Specialization
As characters rise in level, players gain more opportunities to make choices
about what their characters are good at. By far, the best strategies for 
character-building emphasize offense and maximize strengths. Emphasizing
offense is important because players control when their characters get to use
offensive abilities, whereas defensive abilities can be triggered only by enemy
attack. Maximizing strengths is good for the same reason — players can
expect that their characters will spend most of their time doing what they’re
good at. 
All player characters are specialized to some degree or another, but by the
time characters reach the game-changing levels (9th through 13th), the
cumulative effect of choices the players have made can result in very signifi-
cant differences between characters in the party. Just as the gap between a
fighter’s and a wizard’s base attack bonus widens as they increase in level (as
discussed in the section, “The widening attack gap”), you see similar differ-
ences in character functions such as spell ability, skill checks, Armor Class,
hit points, and so on. The net effect of this natural tendency is that charac-
ters lose the ability to make meaningful rolls in things they’re not good at. A
Balance or Hide check that would be interesting for the rogue is pointless for
anybody else — no other character has a chance of succeeding. If you set the
DC low enough for the cleric or wizard to succeed with a decent roll, the
rogue passes the check automatically. 
Spellcasters become especially dangerous through specialization because the
appearance of save-or-die spells coincides with the availability of options
that increase a character’s spell save DCs (the Difficulty Class of saving
throws that a character’s foes must make against his or her spells). The com-
bination of feat choice, prestige class, and magic items means that a high-
level spellcaster can easily generate a spell save DC that is nearly impossible
for most adversaries to save against. Challenging a maximized spellcaster
without just negating the player’s character build choices requires a lot of
DM ingenuity. 
Refining the Challenges
One answer to a high-level adventuring party is simply more of the same —
bigger monsters with more Hit Dice, more special abilities, and more trea-
sure. If the game simply changed in a quantitative manner, that would be fine;
there’s no end to the number of hit points you can assign a monster, after all.
But as we point out in the preceding sections of this chapter, the game
changes in a qualitative manner too. Players approach encounters in a whole
254
Part III: Creating Adventures 

new way. The challenge becomes a matter of finding the exact right spell that
will nuke the encounter in the most efficient way possible. It might be wind
walk; it might be teleport; it might be mass invisibility. Too much of the game
falls on the shoulders of the players with the spellcaster characters and their
abilities to transfer magical power to the rest of the characters in the party. 
255
Chapter 19: The High-Level Adventure

In general, half of your encounters ought to feature monsters, situations, or
villains that reduce the effectiveness of some characters in the party, but not
all. The question of which PC excels and which one gets thrust into a sup-
porting role should have a different answer in each fight you throw at them.
You have the ability to control which characters are the stars in any given
encounter, and you should design your adventure to shine a spotlight on
each player at the table at some point or another.
The first step in designing adventures that remain interesting and challenging
for high-level characters is to look for ways to counterbalance the spells and
capabilities most commonly used for busting adventures. 
Flight
Flying characters no longer have to worry about crossing any dangerous
ground or difficult terrain you might use in a dungeon. Nor will they be
deterred by vertical obstacles, such as walls, cliffs, or chasms. Flying also
makes it possible to kill opponents on the ground with impunity. 
To limit the effectiveness of flight without taking it away entirely, try these
techniques:
 Wide obstacles: A fly spell cast by a 12th-level character lasts 12 min-
utes, or 120 rounds. A flying character can take two 60-feet moves per
round (40 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor). In other words, this
spell lets a character fly 2 to 3 miles, or half that distance if climbing.
Make the obstacle big, and at least the PCs have to commit higher-level
spells (such as overland flight instead of fly) to bypass it.
 Low ceilings: Dungeon chambers or hallways only 10 feet tall don’t give
a flying character enough space to get out of a Medium-sized enemy’s
reach. Bigger monsters and monsters with reach can threaten charac-
ters in rooms with higher ceilings. 
 Monsters with ranged attacks: If the monsters or villains have the abil-
ity to attack effectively at range, flying becomes much less of an advan-
tage for the player characters.
 Flying monsters: If the monsters can take to the air too, flying is less of a
tactical advantage for the player characters.
Invisibility
Invisibility comes in two flavors: the invisibility spell and the greater invisi-
bility spell. The plain old invisibility spell is pretty good because invisible 
256
Part III: Creating Adventures 

characters can often sneak past encounters, penetrate the defenses of dun-
geons or strongholds without being challenged, or set up viciously effective
ambushes. Even though characters using this spell become visible after
making an attack, it’s still a good deal. Greater invisibility is far more devastat-
ing in combat because the recipient of the spell doesn’t become visible after
attacking. Now it becomes almost impossible for many types of foes to even
guess which square the invisible attacker is standing in, let alone make a suc-
cessful counterattack. This spell is especially effective when the player char-
acters turn the party’s rogue invisible, because now every attack the rogue
makes is a sneak attack.
To stop invisibility from overrunning the game, try some of these techniques: 
 Monsters that see invisible creatures: If some of your encounters
include creatures with blindsight, tremorsense, or the see invisibility
spell, invisible characters will be less effective. A much less heavy-
handed approach is to include weak “spotting” monsters as pets or
allies to the real thumpers in the encounter. For example, fire giants
often have hell hounds as pets. Hell hounds have the scent ability, which
helps to locate invisible creatures.
 Telltale floors: A little sand, snow, mud, or water on the floor should
make it much easier for an intelligent monster to guess the location of
an invisible foe. Even though the monster still has a big miss chance due
to the concealment provided by the spell, at least it’s likely to attack the
right square.
 Monsters immune to sneak attack: Monsters that are resistant or
immune to critical hits and sneak attacks (constructs or undead, for
example) aren’t very worried about a high-level rogue with a greater
invisibility spell.
 Area attacks: If a monster possesses an area attack — a damaging aura
or a big breath weapon, for example — it doesn’t need to know exactly
where the invisible character is standing in order to threaten him or her.
Invulnerability
Various spells and effects might make a character virtually immune to the
attacks of a particular monster in a particular encounter. For example, a char-
acter under a stoneskin spell has little to fear from a manticore. The spell con-
fers 10 points of damage reduction, and a manticore’s best attack deals 2d4+5
damage — not enough to do more than scratch the magically protected char-
acter. Similarly, characters of high level can easily make themselves immune
to energy damage of various types or otherwise “unhittable.”
257
Chapter 19: The High-Level Adventure

Try the following techniques when you’re dealing with (virtually) invulnera-
ble player characters:
 Make it a wrestling match. Monsters that can’t hit a character might do
much better to attempt a grapple instead, especially if the monsters are
bigger than the player characters. This is especially dangerous around
water — even a character with stoneskin needs to breathe.
 Use cooperative tactics. Intelligent monsters can cooperate against a
tough PC by using flanking tactics and the Aid Another action to over-
come very high Armor Class.
 Ignore what you can’t hurt. Intelligent monsters quickly figure out if an
opponent just can’t be hurt by their attacks. If the party’s fighter
appears to be protected by powerful defensive magic, they’ll see
whether they can do better against another character.
 Create combination encounters. Create encounters featuring monsters
that deal damage in very different ways. If you pair up mummies with
evil clerics, the mummies can use their physical attacks while the clerics
attack with spells. It’s hard for player characters to be invulnerable to
more than one sort of attack at a time, no matter what kind of spells or
magic items they employ.
258
Part III: Creating Adventures 
Don’t just say no
When the players are wrecking your dungeon
through the egregious overuse of spells such as
invisibility or fly, you might be tempted to simply
negate these abilities through DM fiat. For exam-
ple, you could design a dungeon with a special
magic effect that says “any creature that flies
gets hit by a 10d6 lightning bolt each round.” In
order to counter invisibility, you might fill your
dungeon with monsters that all have blindsight. If
nothing else, your whole dungeon might be sur-
rounded in an antimagic field. Whatever it is the
players are doing, you can negate it through
monster selection or special conditions.
Although this is certainly one way to counter 
the growing capabilities of the player charac-
ters, it isn’t particularly fun. Instead of feeling 
like they’ve been rewarded for growing more
powerful and playing smart, they feel like you’re
just trying to take away their toys.
A better approach is to design high-level
encounters assuming that the PCs will make the
best use of the capabilities at their disposal. For
example, instead of designing an encounter that
negates flying, design an encounter that rewards
it. If the monsters have ranged attacks that are
somewhat weaker than their melee attacks,
they’ll still be able to do something about flying
characters, but they won’t be as effective as they
would be against ground-bound parties. You’ve
rewarded flying as a tactic for the encounter, but
the monsters at least get to put up some fight.
You can still create the occasional encounter
that “turns off” one of the party’s capabilities;
just don’t make that the encounter the player
characters have every time they play in one of
your high-level adventures.

Making the Experience Match the Level
By the time the player characters reach 13th or 14th level, they’ve saved
plenty of villages. They’ve beaten plenty of marauding monsters. They’ve
rooted out plenty of sinister cults and broken up plenty of slaver gangs.
Moving into high-level play means that the characters should begin to take
on quests and tasks that feel like they’re worthy of a high-level party’s time
and attention.
Raising the stakes
The first thing you can do to make high-level characters feel like they’re
becoming more important in the game world is raise the stakes of whatever
adventure they take on. Instead of adventuring to save a village, the heroes
now deal with threats to great cities or whole kingdoms. A low-level party
dealing with a bloodthirsty cult of Erythnul, god of slaughter, might face a
single cult leader in one isolated shrine. At higher levels, the cult of Erythnul
might be a society of assassins who hold an entire realm in terror. High
nobles and great merchants are secret members of the cult, and they work to
shield the cult from any organized efforts to stamp it out. When the heroes
take on the adventure, they’re facing a secret society with hundreds of mem-
bers. The basic idea of the adventure is the same, but the stakes are a dozen
times higher.
Wowing the players with the setting
Early in their player characters’ careers, players expect to fight in modest,
mundane locales such as caves, crypts, ruined castles, and lonely wilderness
clearings. As the characters transition into high level, make the scenery
around the adventure more and more spectacular. Instead of grubbing
around in a dirty little cave only a few hundred feet from daylight, send the
PCs 20 miles down into the awesome black vault of the Underdark. Locate
your secret strongholds of evil atop awesome mountain peaks, in the fuming
calderas of volcanoes, or in the icebound ruins of a city of giants ringed by
colossal statues hundreds of feet high. The more remote, the better — if the
PCs have to make use of their prodigious magical gifts just to get to the
adventure, the players will understand why this was an adventure no ordi-
nary dungeon-delvers dared take on.
259
Chapter 19: The High-Level Adventure

Providing benchmark encounters
Once every adventure or two, it’s a good idea to remind the players of how
much tougher their characters are now compared to where they were a few
levels ago. Look for opportunities to throw the occasional weak encounter
into a high-level adventure. If you can find a benchmark monster or former
enemy who once seemed tough to the players, so much the better. For exam-
ple, if the player characters almost got wiped out by a troll when they were
4th level, an encounter with four or five trolls when they’re 11th or 12th level
will show off just how far they’ve come since that one hard fight.
260
Part III: Creating Adventures 
Going past 20th level
We feel that D&D transitions fully into high-level
play when characters reach 13th to 14th level.
If you find that you enjoy high-level play and
want more of it, you might want to take the cam-
paign past the 20th level barrier. Characters of
21st level or higher are referred to as epic char-
acters, and the whole expanse of game play
beyond 20th level is known as epic level D&D. If
you want to play at this super-high level, check
out Epic Level Handbook and see whether it’s
for you.
Be warned — the game continues to grow more
complex and unwieldy the farther you go, just
because even the simplest characters continue
to master new feats, new attacks, and new
magic items. Each level the player characters
gain is one more thing the players and the DM
have to study in order to play the best game. With
that said, if your game group wants to slay great
wyrms, demon princes, and evil demigods, epic
level is the place you ought to be playing.

T
he earlier chapters in this book bury you under an avalanche of helpful
advice and suggestions. In this chapter, we give you something concrete
and immediately useful — a second sample dungeon that you can use in your
D&D game. This one is a little longer and more involved than the sample dun-
geon presented in Chapter 7, and it might take you two or three game ses-
sions to complete.
Dungeon Master Preparation
To run your best game, make sure that you know the adventure, the mon-
sters, and the key rules for obstacles, challenges, or special attacks the
player characters are likely to run into during the adventure. You certainly
don’t need to commit everything to memory, but the game will run smoother
if you’re familiar with the adventure and its features before you begin your
game session. 
Before you intend to play, read or review the following:
 The adventure contained in this chapter (naturally).
 The following monster descriptions from the Monster Manual (if you own
it): choker, skeleton, gnoll, monstrous centipede, wight, and worg. You
don’t need the Monster Manual to run the adventure, because we include

all the relevant statistics, but the Monster Manual includes more thor-
ough descriptions of these creatures.
 The following special attack forms: grapple, poison, trip, and energy
drain. See the Player’s Handbook, pages 155 and 158, for more about
grapple and trip attacks, respectively. See the Dungeon Master’s Guide,
pages 296 and 293, for details on poison and energy drain, respectively.
 The following spell descriptions from the Player’s Handbook: blindness/
deafness, ray of enfeeblement, summon swarm, burning hands, and ghoul
touch. They’re likely to come up during the last encounter of the 
adventure.
 The description of Griffonford and its surroundings in Chapter 8. This
adventure is set in Griffonford, but you can easily change the name or
key personalities of the town to suit your own campaign if you would
prefer to use a different setting.
You might want to use sticky notes, paper clips, or some other handy method
to mark the pages in your rulebooks that you intend to refer to later. It will
save you time and page-flipping during your game session.
The Necromancer’s Apprentice
When the folk of Griffonford’s outlying farmsteads report livestock killed, sin-
ister creatures prowling around their homes by night, and evil whispers in
the wild woods, the player characters are called in to investigate and set mat-
ters right. Their investigation leads them into a monster-haunted forest and
the long-abandoned home of a notorious necromancer . . . now occupied by a
new master.
This adventure is designed for four player characters of 2nd level. If your
group includes more than four players or the characters are higher than 2nd
level, you can adjust the adventure to compensate; see the section, “Making
the Adventure Tougher,” at the end of this chapter.
As with the adventure in Chapter 7, the material in this chapter is divided
into two sections: Dungeon Master information, and information to be shared
with the players. The material you can read aloud to the players is marked
“Read Aloud” and set in italics.
Adventure premise
In the Thirsting Wood a few miles west of the small town of Griffonford stands
the lonely house of the infamous necromancer Roburn. Years ago, Roburn
262
Part III: Creating Adventures 

attracted the attention of the young Vesgin Averoth, younger brother of
Tardin Averoth, lord of the town. Vesgin aspired to the magical arts, and
Roburn taught the ambitious young nobleman many secrets of dark magic.
Vesgin grew proud and cruel under Roburn’s tutelage, and began to plot the
murder of his older brother so that he could take his “rightful” place as lord
of Griffonford.
Vesgin’s attempt to assassinate Tardin failed. When the depth of his brother’s
evil came to light, Tardin threw Vesgin out. Then he set out after Roburn, intend-
ing to drive off the necromancer who had poisoned his younger brother with
cruelty and ambition. But Roburn was gone. He apparently left his lonely house
to the birds and the beasts, and has not been seen or heard from since.
It has been a number of years since Roburn and Vesgin studied together in the
sinister house in the woods. Vesgin grew in his knowledge of the necromantic
arts and took an apprentice of his own, Nathar. Finally, Vesgin decided to return
to Griffonford and exact vengeance for all the injustices he suffered — and the
first step was to send Nathar to prepare his way.
At his master’s order, the young necromancer Nathar crept into the Dholin
Vale and took up residence in Roburn’s old house. Nathar intends to thor-
oughly spy out Griffonford and the lands nearby, gather a warband of evil
creatures suitable for Vesgin’s work, and sow what chaos and fear he can in
preparation for Vesgin’s return. Vesgin told Nathar several of the secrets of
Roburn’s old abode, and the younger apprentice is eagerly searching out
every scrap of arcane lore remaining in the various tomes and books Roburn
left behind when he abandoned his home.
Nathar’s servants include a gang of gnoll warriors, a particularly vicious
“Sneak,” and a number of skeletons created by Roburn that now answer to
the new wizard of the house. Roaming the Vale by night, Nathar’s minions
have started killing livestock, terrorizing the outlying farms, and waylaying
travelers in the wild and at lonely spots outside of town. The folk of
Griffonford suspect that some sinister new denizen might now inhabit
Roburn’s house, but the last guardsmen who went to investigate were
attacked by a vicious black wolf in the woods and never made it to the old
necromancer’s home.
Starting the adventure
When you’re ready to start playing, begin by having each player introduce his
or her character — name and race, character class, and a quick description
of what the character looks like. Then read the following text to the players:
263
Chapter 20: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

Read Aloud: Your travels have brought you to the small town of Griffonford.
You’ve spent several days looking around some old ruins nearby, but you
haven’t found much at all. As you are getting ready to set out on a new day of
explorations, a dour-looking old swordsman approaches you on the street. He
wears the silver cloak clasp of the town watch. “I’m Tervith, captain of the
watch,” he rasps. “You’ve been looking around the old ruins out in the Vale.
Well, I think I know of one you ought to visit. Are you interested?”
Give the players a moment to think up appropriate responses. Tervith is here
to point the characters toward the adventure, so the captain takes anything
short of outright hostility as an indication to explain more.
Captain Tervith’s request
This is a roleplaying encounter. Tervith wants the player characters to go out
to Roburn’s old home and see what exactly is going on out there. He’s a little
suspicious of wandering adventurers, but he thinks the player characters are
probably better able to handle any trouble they might run into than his own
guards or any kind of town militia.
Read Aloud: Tervith glances up and down the street — none of the other towns-
folk are nearby. He lowers his voice. “The farmsteaders who live on the out-
skirts of town are worried. Strange things have been happening lately —
livestock missing, sinister faces peering into windows, even sightings of beast-
men in the Thirsting Wood. Early this morning, old Arim sent one of his boys
into town to tell me that someone or something killed half a dozen of his sheep
west of town. There’s an old wizard’s cottage, known as Roburn’s house, not far
from Arim’s place, and I’m worried that some new evil is hiding out there. Do
you think you could look into this?”
Naturally, the players might have some questions. Captain Tervith answers
the PCs questions to the best of his ability:
 Who’s Arim? “A shepherd who lives with his sons a mile or so west of
town, just on this side of the Thirsting Wood. He’s a steady man, and I’ve
never known him to scare easily. Follow the track north from the middle of
town; you can’t miss his place.”
 Who lives in the wizard’s cottage? “No one now, but it used to be
Roburn’s house. He was a brooding, unfriendly sort who lived up in the
Thirsting Wood for many years, keeping to himself. He abandoned the
place about ten years ago, and hasn’t been seen or heard from since. Good
riddance to him.”
 How do we find Roburn’s house? “There’s a trail leading into the forest
near Arim’s pasture. It’s about three miles from the pasture to Roburn’s
house.”
264
Part III: Creating Adventures 

 Why don’t you look into it for yourself? “We did, but the Thirsting Wood
is a dangerous place. A couple of my men were attacked by a vicious black
wolf near Roburn’s house a few days ago. I’m afraid that this might be
more than the town watch can handle.”
 What’s in it for us? “If you can drive off whoever or whatever is skulking
around up there and put an end to these troubles, we’ll pay you 200 gold
pieces.”
Tervith is willing to pay as much as 500 gp, but in order to talk up the fee, a
player character must succeed on a Diplomacy check (DC 15). When the play-
ers are done negotiating and have no more questions for Tervith, the watch
captain points out the track that leads up toward Arim’s house, and wishes
them luck. 
Ask the players whether they’d like their characters to do anything else while
they’re in town. For example, the players might want their characters to
stock up on arrows, buy a potion, or pick up special gear such as sunrods or
thunderstones if they have any money to spend. This is also a good time to
ask players with spellcasting characters to choose which spells their charac-
ters prepare for the day, if they haven’t done so already. When the PCs are
ready to continue, go on to “Arim’s pasture.”
Arim’s pasture
This is the scene of the most recent attack and the setting-out point for the
adventure. Figure 20-1 shows a map of the area. When the players tell you
that their characters are ready to begin, read the following text:
Read Aloud: You follow the track from Griffonford past several outlying farm-
steads and herdsmen’s cottages. The cart track ends near a large cottage of field-
stone and turf, surrounded by broad green pastures. You can see that one of the
farther pastures is a scene of slaughter. The carcasses of half a dozen sheep lie
strewn about, and the smell of blood hangs heavily in the air. None of the dead
animals appear to have been eaten. Just beyond the low stone wall broods the
Thirsting Wood, shadows thick and dark under the gnarled branches. An over-
grown footpath leads into the woods. 
DM Secret: The livestock were killed during the night by the gnolls who serve
Nathar, who were scrounging around Arim’s farm looking for something
worth stealing. They carried off two of the smaller animals and killed the rest
out of spite.
265
Chapter 20: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

Arim and his sons
If the player characters stop at the cottage, they make the acquaintance of
the old shepherd Arim and his two strapping young sons. Arim is a lean, gray-
bearded fellow with a sturdy wooden quarterstaff and a leather sling at his
belt. He walks with a bad limp, the result of an old injury, and he never uses
two words when one will do. If the player characters question him about the
night’s events, he can’t add much more to the story.
 Did you see or hear anything last night? “No. The wind was up all night,
and I didn’t hear much else. I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary
until sunrise, when I got up to check on the flock.”
 Are the woods dangerous? “Never used to be this bad. I’ve taught the
wolves and eagles to stay away from my flock. But there’s some new beast
out in the woods that has no fear of man. I won’t let my lads go in there by
themselves these days.”
 Where does the path lead? “To Roburn’s house. It’s about three miles far-
ther on. I don’t go near the place; it’s got an evil look to it.”

Part III: Creating Adventures 

Examining the scene
The players may have their characters take a closer look at the dead live-
stock. It’s gruesome work, but the player characters might learn something
for their effort. Ask the players which skills their characters are using when
they study the scene. Skills that might be relevant include Knowledge
(nature), Search, or Survival.
 Knowledge (nature): A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Knowledge
(nature) skill check can determine that the dead livestock were killed by
edged weapons, likely axes.
 Search: A character who studies the ground around the dead animals
can attempt a Search check. If the character succeeds on a DC 14 check,
he or she finds tracks around the slaughtered animals. (A ranger whose
favored enemy is humanoid [gnoll] may add his favored enemy bonus to
this check.) To get more information, a character must have the Track
feat. If a character with the Track feat succeeds with a result of 18 or
better, he or she determines that two creatures with wolf-like prints
likely killed the sheep. On a result of 22 or better, the character also
determines that the killers walked on two legs, not four, despite their
wolf-like prints.
 Survival: To follow the tracks, a character with the Track feat must suc-
ceed on a DC 14 Survival check. The tracks lead to the footpath and
follow the path north into the woods. 
DM Secret: The strange tracks of the wolf-like creatures were left by the
gnolls; their feet and legs are more canine than human in appearance.
What next?
When the players tell you that they’re ready to strike off in search of
Roburn’s house or choose to follow the tracks leading into the woods, move
on to “The Thirsting Wood.”
The Thirsting Wood
The footpath winds through the woods toward the necromancer’s old home
(refer to the map shown in Figure 20-1). It’s a few miles from the pasture, so it
takes the characters about an hour of marching to get there. Along the way,
they encounter some trouble. To set the mood for the players, use the follow-
ing to describe the march:
Read Aloud: The forest is dense and dark. Twisted trees with black trunks and
heavy overhanging branches make the footpath seem more like a tunnel than
trail. The air is warm, still, and gloomy, and there doesn’t seem to be a breath of
wind in here. You don’t even hear any birdsong.
267
Chapter 20: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

Worg attack
Encounter Level (EL) 2: About halfway to Roburn’s house, the player charac-
ters run into the creature that attacked the town watch — a vicious, blood-
thirsty worg. The creature has noticed Nathar’s servants making use of the
footpath leading through its territory, and it’s waiting to ambush the next
person who comes up or down the path.
Setting up the Ambush: To set up this encounter, draw a winding path about
1 square wide along your battle grid or play surface, if you have one. All
squares off the path are considered difficult terrain — a creature must pay 
2 squares of movement to enter each square of forest. Ask the players to
arrange their miniatures on the battle grid in the order in which their charac-
ters are marching. You can assume that the player characters are on the path.
Spotting the Ambush: Next, roll a Hide check for the worg. (It’s d20+4 nor-
mally, but the woods offer excellent cover, so the worg gets an extra +4
bonus, for a total of d20+8.) Beginning with the character in the lead, allow
each player to roll a Spot check. Each Spot check takes a –2 penalty because
the worg is 20 feet off the path. 
If a character equals or beats the worg’s Hide check result, he or she sees the
monster. Place the worg about 20 feet from the first character who spots it,
off in the woods. Allow the rest of the characters to make Spot checks too.
Roll initiative, but only the worg and the character or characters who suc-
cessfully spotted it may act in the first round of the fight — everybody else is
surprised. 
If no characters spot the worg, place it 20 feet from the last character in line.
(It picks off whoever’s bringing up the rear.) The worg rolls initiative and acts
on the first round, but in this case all characters are surprised and no one else
gets to act. When you place the worg on the battle grid, read the following:
Read Aloud: Lurking in the shadows of the forest is a big wolf with a black pelt
and wide, slavering jaws. It hurls itself at you with a terrible growl, its eyes
ablaze with bloodlust!
The Worg’s Tactics: The worg is somewhat overconfident and figures that
after it downs a victim, the rest of the party is likely to run off. (That’s how
the fighting went with the town watch, after all.) It bounds straight at the first
character that saw it (or the last character in line, if no one spotted it) and
attacks.
A worg that makes a successful attack can try to trip its victim; see the rules
on Trip, on page 158 of the Player’s Handbook. Given the chance, the worg
attacks any prone characters when its turn comes up; attacks against prone
characters receive a +4 attack bonus. Standing up after getting tripped is a
move action that provokes an attack of opportunity (see page 137 of the
Player’s Handbook).
268
Part III: Creating Adventures 

After the Battle: If the worg is reduced to 10 hit points or less and two char-
acters or more are still on their feet and fighting, it tries to run away — it’s
overconfident, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t know when to call it a day.
This counts as defeating the monster for purposes of awarding experience
points. From the site of the worg’s ambush, it’s about another half-mile or so
to the necromancer’s cottage. Continue the adventure with “House of Roburn.”
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat the worg, the party
earns 600 XP.
House of Roburn
At the end of the footpath lies the house built by the necromancer Roburn. 
A map of the house and the surrounding area is shown in Figure 20-2. The
player characters reach the place about an hour after setting out from Arim’s
farmstead. When you’re ready to move on to this part of the adventure, begin
with the following description:
Read Aloud: The footpath ends in a sizable clearing at the base of a bramble-
covered hillside. A large, rambling house of fieldstone squats under the hill. Moss
grows over the wooden shakes of its roof, and its small round windows are dark
269
Chapter 20: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice
Worg
A worg is a cruel, clever wolf almost as intelligent as a human. It has black fur and yellow eyes
that seem to glow with malice. It’s bigger than any natural wolf, standing 3 feet tall at the shoulder
and weighing almost 300 pounds.

Trip: If the worg hits with its bite attack, it can attempt to trip its opponent (d20+3 Strength check)
as a free action. It must beat its opponent’s Strength or Dexterity check (opponent’s choice) in order
to trip its foe. If the attempt fails, the opponent can’t react to trip the worg.
Scent: The worg notices invisible creatures within 30 feet. It can take a move action to note the
direction of the invisible creature. If it approaches within 5 feet, it knows which square the invisi-
ble creature is in.

and dusty. A thin stream runs out from a crevice in the hillside near the house; the
crevice is loosely covered by an iron gate. Smoke drifts skyward from the ram-
shackle chimney atop the house, and old oxcart leans against one wall. The
house seems to have only one door, which is fashioned in a curious oval shape.
We describe the areas numbered on the map in the following sections.
Encounter Area 1: The Clearing
None of the house’s denizens spend much time outside by daylight, so the
clearing is almost always empty.
Read Aloud: The clearing around the house is covered with tall, dry grass and
bramble-bushes. There is a dusty yard immediately before the front door. The
oxcart leaning against the house is old but sturdy.
The players might fear that their characters will be seen from the house if
they enter the clearing, but in truth the house’s windows are so dark and
dusty that no one inside can really see out at all. As long as the player charac-
ters stay reasonably quiet, the gnolls in the front hall (area 4) won’t know
they’re out here. However, if the player characters make any loud noises —
shouting or smashing things — the gnolls hear them and get ready for a fight.
Figure 20-2:
The clearing
and the
cottage.
270
Part III: Creating Adventures 

If the player characters wait and observe the cottage, no one comes out until
nightfall, when the gnolls in area 4 emerge to begin another evening of maraud-
ing and troublemaking. If the player characters fight them here, use the statis-
tics provided in “Encounter Area 4: The Front Hall” (and remember that gnolls
defeated here won’t be waiting for the player characters in area 4).
Encounter Area 2: The Spring and Gate
A spring rises deep in the crevice and serves as the house’s well.
Read Aloud: The cleft in the hillside goes back a good ways into the gloom. A
small trickle of a stream not more than a foot across spills out and passes under
the thickets nearby. The iron grate across the mouth of the cleft is hinged, and is
secured by a rusty old padlock.
The padlock isn’t a very good one, but it is rusty and difficult to operate (DC
25 Open Locks check). It can also be smashed off the grate by a couple solid
hammer blows, but that makes enough noise to alert the gnolls in area 4. A
character could also force his or her way in by wrenching the grate loose,
which requires a DC 23 Strength check. Remember, characters can Take 20 on
these checks if they want (see page 65 of the Player’s Handbook).
Inside, the cleft goes back about 20 feet, narrowing until it becomes a tight
squeeze for almost anyone. Hidden around a bend in the crevice is an old
wooden trap door that leads down to area 8 in the dungeon level.
Encounter Area 3: The Front Door
The house has only one entrance.
Read Aloud: The cottage door is made of fitted wooden planks, still streaked by
peeling yellow paint. In the center of the door is a keyhole that sits in a plate
worked in the shape of a grinning devil’s face.
The lock looks formidable, but the door is unlocked because the key is long
gone. Nathar’s servants simply use an iron latch on the inside, and they
secure it with a stout wooden peg if they remember to do so. The PCs can lift
the latch with a thin blade or a thief’s pick (Open Lock DC 15) or force the
whole door with a good enough kick (Strength check DC 23). They can use
the oxcart in the clearing as an improvised battering ram (+4 bonus on
Strength checks to open the door) if any player thinks to try it.
If someone tries to open the latch and fails, the gnolls in area 4 don’t notice
anything. However, if someone tries to break down the door and fails the
Strength check, the gnolls definitely take note. They get ready for a fight.
271
Chapter 20: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

If the player characters don’t seem to be able to get through the door,
remember that they can make multiple tries to break down the door with
Strength checks or even Take 20. Also, characters can use the Aid Another
action to add a +2 bonus to another character’s Strength check, so multiple
characters cooperating and Taking 20 should open the door, especially if they
think of using the oxcart to batter it down — but that will certainly give the
gnolls in area 4 plenty of warning that trouble’s about to show up. 
Listening at the Door: If any character decides to listen by the door, allow a
Listen check (DC 7). On a successful check, a character can make out a low,
growling conversation between two or three creatures (the gnolls in area 4).
Unless the character knows the language Gnoll, he or she can’t make out
what they’re saying. A character who speaks Gnoll can quickly make out that
a couple gnolls are arguing about which farmstead to loot tonight. One wants
to go back to the same place they went last night, and the other wants to try
someplace new.
Looking in the Windows: Peering in a window doesn’t do much good —
they’re small, dark, and so dirty inside and out that nothing can be seen in
either direction. A character could easily break a window in order to see into
area 4, but the gnolls inside notice (and likely stab or shoot at any charac-
ter’s face they see peering in at them).
Getting on the Roof: Characters inclined to scramble on or around the house
can scale the walls with a DC 20 Climb check. However, the noise of someone
walking around on the roof certainly alerts the gnolls in area 4 to expect trouble.
Encounter Area 4: The Front Hall
Encounter Level (EL) 3: Two of Nathar’s gnolls use the main room of the old
cottage as their guardpost. When the player characters get the door open,
here’s what they see:
Read Aloud: The front of the house is a dark, cluttered room filled with a thick,
musty odor like wet fur. There are two doors on the other side of the room. Old
furnishings lie heaped up against the walls, and there are two crude bedrolls by
the large hearth, where a small cookfire smolders. A pair of tall hyena-men
wearing ragged leather jerkins lurk here, growling defiantly at you. “Kill the
humans,” one snarls.
The gnolls have no interest in talking with the player characters and do their
best to kill the PCs. One of the doors leads to area 5, the Sneak’s Den, and the
other leads down to the cellar (area 6), shown on the map in Figure 20-2.
Neither door is locked.
Surprise: If the player characters opened the door without making too much
noise (they used Open Lock, or got it open on the first Strength check), the
gnolls are surprised and don’t get to act in the surprise round. If the player
characters don’t know that the gnolls were in here when they opened the
272
Part III: Creating Adventures 

door (no one attempted a Listen check at the door, or the Listen check
failed), the player characters are surprised. It’s possible that both the gnolls
and the player characters are surprised or that neither side is surprised, in
which case you can skip the surprise round and start the battle with a normal
initiative roll.
Gnoll Tactics: If the gnolls had a chance to get ready for the fight, they’re
both at the far side of the room with their javelins ready. They throw their
javelins at the first character they see when the door opens, and then rush
up to attack with their battleaxes.
Defeating the Gnolls: The gnolls fight until one drops. Then the other tries to
make a fighting retreat out of the room, heading for the door that leads down
to area 6. Remember, it takes a move action to open a door. If the surviving
gnoll makes it out, the creature joins Nathar in area 11, and fights the player
characters again when they reach that room.
Treasure: Most of the clutter in the room isn’t very valuable — mildewed old
chairs, well-worn tables, and several barrels and crates of goods such as
flour, molasses, sour ale, and other such staples (which Nathar and his gnolls
brought with them when they moved in). Hidden under a loose stone by the
hearth (Search DC 15) is a leather pouch containing 35 gold pieces and two
agates worth 15 gp each.
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat the gnolls, the
party earns 900 XP.
273
Chapter 20: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice
Gnolls (2)
A gnoll is a savage, hyena-headed creature that often serves a more powerful master as a
marauder or guard. It stands about 71⁄2 feet tall and wears dirty leather armor. These gnolls carry a
shield, battleaxe, and a javelin.

Encounter Area 5: The Sneak’s Den
Encounter Level (EL) 2: This room used to be Roburn’s bedchamber. It has
become the lair of a choker that Nathar and his gnolls call “the Sneak.” The
monster hates its new neighbors, but it fears them too much to strike directly
at them, so it spends a lot of time skulking about spying on Nathar and his
gnolls. Nathar allows it to stay, hoping that he can use the small monster as a
spy and assassin in Griffonford.
Read Aloud: This room looks like it was once a comfortable bedchamber, but it
is dark and dank now — it seems that a badly leaking roof overhead has
allowed years of rain and wind to ruin the furnishings and the plaster. The floor
is littered with the bones of small animals, and the room smells of mildew and
old, rotten meat.
The choker is hiding up in the rotting rafters overhead. Make a Hide check for
the monster (d20+10). The result is the DC for Spot checks made by any char-
acters looking around the room to see the choker before it strikes. If some-
body sees the choker, continue with the following:
Read Aloud: Clinging to the rafters above the door is a hideous little creature
with mottled gray skin and long, spindly limbs. It hisses at you and lashes out
with its spiny hands! 
If nobody sees the choker, it does not attack unless a character actually
enters the old bedchamber and starts poking around. In that case, read this
text instead:
Read Aloud: Something hisses overhead, and then a long, snakelike arm or ten-
tacle reaches down and tries to grab you! 
Choker Ambush: If nobody spots the choker before it strikes, it surprises the
player characters. The monster attempts to grab one character and strangle
him or her. Because it’s above the player characters, it gains a +1 bonus on
its attack rolls due to higher ground. It’s still within sword’s reach for charac-
ters below, but the mess of rotting rafters gives it some cover (+2 bonus to
AC as long as it stays up in its nest). The choker has an exceptionally long
reach and can easily attack characters in the room below.
If the choker is reduced to 5 hit points or less, it flees. It worms its way out of
a small hole in the roof (this takes the creature one full round) and then runs
off into the forest, never to be seen again.
If nobody spots the choker but nobody goes into the room and provokes it,
the monster decides to stealthily follow the player characters. It attacks a
character at the rear of the party when it thinks no one else is looking.
274
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Treasure: A few months ago, the choker killed a bandit who had thought he
would use Roburn’s house as his hideout. The unfortunate outlaw’s goods
and belongings still lie in the mildewed mess on the floor, including two sun-
rods, a potion of cure light wounds, and a masterwork short sword. 
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat the choker, the
party earns 600 XP.
Encounter Area 6: The Cellar
The cellar seems to be a typical cellar — dank, dusty, and lined with wooden
shelves on the brick walls for the storage of food. 
Read Aloud: A flight of narrow wooden stairs descends from the front room of
the cottage to a small cellar below the house. The cellar is floored and walled
with brick, and it’s filled with the usual clutter of dusty wooden shelves and old
275
Chapter 20: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice
Choker
The choker is a small, rubbery creature about 3 feet tall. Its flesh is a mottled gray-green, and it has
long, spindly, boneless arms and legs. It is a vicious, clever ambusher that hides in the shadows,
reaching out to seize unwary characters in its deadly grip.

stores. You can see that part of the wall opposite the foot of the stairs is actually
a concealed door, its surface plastered and painted to match the surrounding
brick. It’s standing ajar, and flickering green light leaks out from around the
edges. Beyond is another set of stairs continuing down.
The gnolls are supposed to shut the concealed door when they come or go,
but they’re lazy and don’t often do so. If the door is actually closed, it requires
a DC 20 Search check for someone who doesn’t know it’s there to locate it.
The stairs lead down to the dungeon level (see “The dungeon below”).
The dungeon below
The biggest secret of Roburn’s house is that the cottage in the clearing was
only a small part of the necromancer’s lair. In the hill behind the house,
Roburn excavated a small dungeon where he kept his valuables and per-
formed his sinister rites and experiments. A map of the dungeon under
Roburn’s house is shown in Figure 20-3.
The floors in the dungeon level are made of smooth, well-worn flagstones,
and the walls are dressed masonry. Torches enchanted with continual flame
illuminate most of the rooms.

Part III: Creating Adventures 

Encounter Area 7: Roburn’s Sleepless Warriors
Encounter Level (EL) 2: The door leading to this room from the stairs is
made of iron, but it isn’t locked. The chamber beyond holds six human war-
rior skeletons under Nathar’s command. 
Read Aloud: Two torches burning with eerie green flames illuminate this large
chamber. The room consists of two intersecting vaults, with four pillars of stone
in its center. Glimmers of light show two passageways leading into the gloom.
Standing in two silent files on each side of the room are six skeletons, each car-
rying a round shield and a curved scimitar. With the clicking and rasping of old
bones, the skeletons turn toward you and advance with scimitars raised!
The undead monsters have been directed to attack any living creature that
enters the room without giving a special pass-sign (a clenched fist, held
across the chest). Nathar has taught the gnolls in his service the pass-sign, so
gnolls coming and going through this room aren’t attacked by the skeletons.
Roll initiative for the player characters and the skeletons when the player
characters enter the room.
If the player characters forced one of the gnolls in area 4 to retreat and
pursue the monster closely, the gnoll gives the pass-sign as it runs through
this room. Characters who are within 30 feet of the gnoll when it does so can
make out the sign with a DC 10 Spot check. Realizing that the fist-to-chest
motion instructs the skeletons not to attack requires a DC 25 Sense Motive
check (or a very good guess on the part of an observant player). 
Skeleton Attack: Skeletons are mindless automatons that attack with relent-
less determination if ordered to do so. The skeletons simply move toward the
nearest character and attack. They continue until destroyed, turned by a
cleric, or until the player characters are all dead or retreat from the room.
DM Secret: Nathar did not animate these skeletons, and he can command the
undead warriors only because long ago Roburn, their original creator,
ordered them to follow the commands of anyone displaying a brooch in the
shape of a silver skull. Vesgin gave this brooch to Nathar when he sent him
back to Griffonford.
Treasure: No treasure is hidden in this room, but Nathar and his minions use
two of the wings of the room to store more supplies, including a couple of
water casks, several sacks of flour, small barrels of dried apples and smoked
meat, and other useful stores.
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat the skeletons, the
party earns 600 XP.

Chapter 20: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

Encounter Area 8: The Cistern Room
Encounter Level (EL) 3: The door to this room is made of wood. It’s damp
and sticks a little (DC 8 Strength check to open), but it isn’t locked. Nathar
and his gnolls don’t come in here, because the room is infested with giant
centipedes.
Read Aloud: A big stone cistern brimming with dark water fills most of this
room. On the far side, an old wooden ladder leads up into a shaft about 3 feet
wide and disappears into the shadows overhead. The whole room is dank and
smells faintly rotten, and the masonry is in bad repair — tree roots pierce the
ceiling and walls, and earth spills through the holes. You can hear a faint
rustling sound somewhere above.
The spring in the hillside beside the cottage lies almost directly over this
chamber and feeds the cistern here through a hidden pipe. With this supply
of water, Roburn could have hidden out beneath his own cottage for weeks
had he needed to. The wooden ladder leads about 15 feet up to the trapdoor
hidden in the back of the spring’s cleft (area 2). Roburn had the shaft built to
provide a secret escape route from the dungeon.
The centipedes lurk in the tree roots and crevices in the walls. When suitable
prey (such as the player characters) enters the room, the crawling monsters
scuttle out and attack. Roll initiative.

tipedes swarm the character on the floor and begin feeding. Characters who
choose to retreat can shut the door on the centipedes, trapping them in the
cistern room; the centipedes can’t get through the door when it’s closed.
When Nathar or his servants need water, the necromancer’s apprentice
orders skeletons from area 7 to fetch water. The centipedes ignore the skele-
tons because animated bones don’t have enough meat on them to be food.
Treasure: Hidden in the bottom of the cistern is a large jar of thick green
glass, well sealed with wax (Search DC 10, if any character actually looks in
the water). It contains a small leather pouch with 30 platinum pieces and a
potion of invisibility. Roburn placed it here long ago in case he ever needed to
flee through the trap door.
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat the monstrous cen-
tipedes, the party earns 900 XP.
Encounter Area 9: The Crypt
Encounter Level (EL) 3: The door leading to this room is a locked door of
iron plate (Open Lock DC 25, or Strength DC 28 to force open). Nathar found
the key during his explorations of the dungeon and carries it on his belt.

Read Aloud: A large crypt lies on the far side of the iron door. A half-dozen
alcoves cut into the walls hold moldering bones, some still dressed in the rotting
remains of their funereal finery. Hunched by the floor, a gaunt, pale figure clad
in the shredded remains of black robes crouches. It looks up when the door
opens, and an evil light flickers in its eyes. “At last,” it rasps in a cold voice. “At
last!” Then it scrambles to its feet and leaps at you!
Vesgin warned Nathar to never open the crypt, and so far the necromancer’s
apprentice has avoided the temptation — even though he strongly suspects
that some desirable treasure must be hidden within. It’s lucky for Nathar that
he hasn’t looked in here yet, because the stout iron door of the crypt impris-
ons a very dangerous monster — a hateful, murderous type of undead known
as a wight. The wight has been trapped in the crypt for many years, and it
furiously attacks any living creature that enters the crypt.
The wight is a dangerous monster. If it successfully attacks a player charac-
ter, it deals one negative level to that character. When a character acquires
negative levels equal to his or her own experience level, the character dies —
so it only takes two hits for the wight to kill a 2nd-level character no matter
how many hit points the character has. See “Energy Drain,” on page 293 of
the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Try to encourage a player whose character has
been hit once by the wight to back out of the fight.
The Wight’s Tactics: The wight has no real tactics other than launching itself
at the closest character and battering him or her to death with its life-draining
slam attacks. It tries to kill off one character rather than injure several because
it knows that if it kills a character, that fallen character will rise as a new wight
under its control. (The rest of the player characters should seriously consider
fleeing for their lives if the wight turns one of their comrades into a second
wight. Running now allows them to live to fight another day, when they can
come back at full power and possibly with help to take on the wights.)
DM Secret: The wight is none other than Roburn himself. His apprentice
Vesgin betrayed the old necromancer before fleeing Griffonford. Vesgin
imprisoned his former master alive in the crypt. Roburn died a few days later,
so consumed with hate for his former apprentice that he awoke into undeath
as a wight — still imprisoned in his own dungeon. Vesgin has no idea that
Roburn “survived” his experience, but he warned Nathar to stay out of the
crypt anyway, simply because Vesgin does not want his own apprentice to
figure out how he repaid his former master.
Treasure: None of the bodies entombed here have any funerary wealth worth
stealing, but Roburn himself carries several valuables that he has long since
forgotten about. Around his neck is a fine silver chain set with moonstones
(worth 400 gp), and on his hands he still wears two rings — one a gold ring with
an emerald and the signet of Roburn’s house (worth 350 gp and identifying him
as the ancient master of the place), and the other a +1 ring of protection.

Part III: Creating Adventures 

Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat the wight, the party

Encounter Area 10: The Back Door
This passageway continues on for more than 200 feet, eventually ending in a
thick wooden door on the other side of the hill. Roburn built this as yet
another secret escape route.
Read Aloud: The ceiling of this narrow passage is only about 5 feet high. The
passage runs straight for a couple hundred feet with very little change, although
you pass several spots where roots have grown through the ceiling. It ends at a
stoutly built wooden door, secured on your side by a thick iron bar. A small glim-
mer of daylight peeks around the edges.
If the player characters open the door (it takes a DC 15 Strength check), they
find that it opens into a dense thicket on the far side of the hill from where

Energy Drain: If the wight successfully hits a living creature with its slam attack, it inflicts 1 nega-
tive level on its victim and gains 5 temporary hit points. (A character suffers a –1 penalty to all attack
rolls, saves, and checks for each negative level he or she currently has, and dies if the number of
negative levels equals or exceeds his or her own character level or Hit Dice.) The save DC to
remove the negative level is 14.
Create Spawn: Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under
the command of the wight that created them.
Undead: The wight is immune to critical hits, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, sleep spells,
sneak attacks, and stunning. It is not subject to fatigue or exhaustion.

Roburn’s cottage stands. The surrounding foliage is so thick that the door
can’t be seen by anyone more than 10 or 15 feet away, and there are no trails
or sites of interest beyond — only more of the rugged hills and tangled trees
of the Thirsting Wood. 
Encounter Area 11: Nathar’s Workroom
Encounter Level (EL) 5: Nathar spends most of his time puttering around in
this spacious workroom, engaged in various experiments and studies. Two
gnolls wait here (three if a gnoll from area 4 escaped), ready to answer any
commands Nathar issues. Begin with this description:
Read Aloud: A piece of parchment is stuck on this door by a nail. It reads “Stay
Out!” in Common.
282
Part III: Creating Adventures 

The door leading to this room is closed, but not locked. If any character tries
to listen at the door, have the player make a Listen check. On a result of 7 or
better, he or she can discern the low rumbling of a furnace at work, sounds of
bubbling, and low growling voices conversing with each other. (The gnolls
are muttering to each other in Gnoll, arguing about what’s for dinner.)
When the characters open the door, read the following aloud:
Read Aloud: This chamber is clearly an alchemist’s workshop. Against one
wall, a small furnace crackles and roars, and a big table in the middle of the
room is cluttered with burners, retorts, alembics, and coils of copper tubing. A
large bookshelf stands against the other wall. A dark-bearded human in black
robes stands by the bookshelf, consulting a thick tome of some kind, while close
by the door a pair of tall, hyena-like creatures watch him at his work. All three
look up as the door opens, and the man in the robes scowls fiercely. “Impudent
fools!” he snarls. “Graad, Thor-Kul — slay them!”
This is a tough fight for a party of four 2nd-level characters. If the player
characters surprise Nathar and his servants, they have a much better
chance, but if the player characters are already beaten up by the time they
get to this room, this encounter might finish them off. If the player characters
have any healing magic available, they might want to use it before they open
the door — which is why there’s a warning sign posted. (Note that they have
no chance of surprising Nathar if one of the gnolls from area 4 escaped.)
Starting the Fight: If the player characters listened at the door and heard the
gnolls talking, the PCs are ready for a fight. They surprise Nathar and his
gnolls and may act in the surprise round. If the player characters just opened
the door or didn’t hear the gnolls, roll initiative normally.
The gnolls are standing in the squares marked “G” when the fight begins, and
Nathar is in the square marked “N.” You might want to sketch the room out
on your battle grid, if you have one, and place miniatures to represent Nathar
and the two (or three) gnolls on the grid.
Tactics: The gnolls stay close to the door and try to keep the player charac-
ters hemmed in this side of the room. They fight with their axes, and unlike
the gnolls up in area 4, both fight to the death — Nathar is watching them,
after all.
Nathar himself hangs back away from the melee and hurls spells at the player
characters. He casts a spell each round if he can, beginning with blindness/
deafness (to blind a PC archer or spellcaster) or ray of enfeeblement (to
weaken a strong-looking character mixing it up with the gnolls). He then uses
summon swarm or summon monster I to conjure a bat swarm or a Small
fiendish monstrous scorpion behind the player characters. After that, he
283
Chapter 20: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

attacks with scorching ray, magic missile, or his wand of burning hands. The
necromancer saves his chill touch and ghoul touch spells for dealing with any
player characters who get past his gnolls and try to close with him. He
attacks with his dagger only as a last resort.
Nathar is currently protected by his mage armor spell, which increases his
AC from 12 to 16. He casts the spell every day just for occasions such as this.
Remember, a spellcaster can avoid an attack of opportunity from a threaten-
ing opponent by taking a 5-foot step away from him before casting, or by
making a successful Concentration skill check (DC 16 for 1st-level spells, or
DC 17 for 2nd-level spells). 
Defeating Nathar: If Nathar is reduced to 5 hit points or less, he tries to
escape. The workroom is something of a trap because there’s only one way
in. If the player characters are between him and the door leading back to area
7, Nathar flees back through the door leading to area 12, and then closes and
locks the door. He drinks his potion of cure light wounds and gets ready to
blast the player characters with whatever spells or wand charges he has left
if they try to come in after him.
Treasure: This gear in Nathar’s workroom constitutes a fully equipped
alchemical laboratory, worth 500 gp. In addition, several of the books on the
bookshelf are rare and valuable; one is worth 250 gp, another 100 gp, and
three more are worth 50 gp each. Most of the books deal with magical theory
and necromantic studies, but they don’t actually hold any spells. Nathar
keeps his spellbook in area 12.

Gnolls (2)
A gnoll is a savage, hyena-headed creature that often serves a more powerful master as a
marauder or guard. It stands about 71⁄2 feet tall and wears dirty leather armor. These gnolls carry a
shield, battleaxe, and a javelin.

of the old furnishings are still useful.

 2nd-level — blindness/deafness (save DC 14), ghoul touch (save DC 14), scorching ray (touch

Nathar’s ability scores are Strength 10, Dexterity 14, Constitution 14, Intelligence 15, Wisdom 8,
Charisma 12.

If Nathar managed to retreat to this room from area 11, the door is locked (Open
Lock DC 25), and partially barricaded (Strength DC 24 to open). Otherwise, it
opens easily. When the player characters enter, read the following.
Read Aloud: A large bed covered in sleeping furs sits in this room, alongside a
small writing desk covered with parchment, a brazier full of warm coals, and a
large trunk. Two tapestries hang from the walls; one depicts a sage in his tower,
and the other shows a starry night.
Nathar’s Last Stand: If Nathar is here, he fights like a cornered rat. Refer to
the sidebar “Nathar, apprentice to Vesgin” for his statistics. If he runs short
on spells, he uses his wand of burning hands to keep his attackers at bay.
Nathar is quite proud and arrogant and won’t consider surrender — he fears
the revenge that his master Vesgin might exact if he gives up too easily.
Treasure: The trunk contains an assortment of traveling clothes and other
elements of a well-to-do wizard’s wardrobe. None are particularly valuable.
However, the trunk has a secret compartment (Search DC 15) that conceals a
pouch with 60 platinum pieces, 4 tourmalines worth 30 gp apiece, and a scroll
of vampiric touch. (Nathar is saving the scroll to scribe into his spellbook,
anticipating that he will soon master more advanced magic.)
Nathar’s spellbook sits in the drawer of the writing desk. It contains all the
spells noted in his statistics, plus the following spells: 
 0-level: disrupt undead, mage hand, mending, resistance
 1st-level: comprehend languages, detect secret doors, feather fall, grease
 2nd-level: resist energy, see invisibility, summon monster II
Naturally, these spells will be of interest to a player character wizard.
Also on the writing desk is a letter from Nathar to Vesgin, which reads:
Master Vesgin:
As you have instructed, I have established myself in the house of your one-
time mentor, Roburn. I discovered several interesting texts in the secret
workshop below the house, and have found them quite elucidating. In the
meantime, I have made a small beginning toward gathering about me such
servants as you may find useful when you make your return to Griffonford.
The gnolls are filthy savages, but they are hungry for the chance to fall on
the town. I think they will do nicely.
I trust you received Roburn’s map to the Shrine of Emerald Skulls? I made a
copy for myself in case some misfortune befell your messenger. I shall for-
ward it at once if you did not receive the original.
286
Part III: Creating Adventures 

Eagerly awaiting your next instructions,
Your obedient servant,
Nathar
Below the letter is a hand-drawn map, which shows the location of a place
marked “Shrine of Emerald Skulls.” The map, and the evil shrine whose loca-
tion it reveals, are not described in this sample adventure. Feel free to use
this as a stepping-stone to an adventure you design yourself, which may or
may not involve more of Vesgin’s minions, or perhaps even the original necro-
mancer’s apprentice himself.
Experience Points Award: If the player characters defeat Nathar a second
and final time in this chamber, the party earns 1,350 XP.
Concluding the adventure
After the player characters defeat Nathar and his gnolls, the mischief around
Griffonford’s western farmsteads comes to an end — for now. Captain Tervith
of the town watch makes good on his promised payment. Moreover, he
assembles a large company of townsfolk and militia to march up to Roburn’s
house, block up the entrance to the cellar dungeon with rubble, and then
burn the house down over the place, just to make sure that no other evil
creature finds a lair there.
If the player characters show Tervith the letter from Nathar to Vesgin, the
watch captain immediately recognizes the name of Lord Averoth’s sinister
younger brother. He arranges an interview for the player characters with
Lord Tardin, who questions them closely about everything they found in and
around Roburn’s house. (This is a great opportunity for the players to have
some fun relating the tales of their own cleverness, bravery, and luck, if
they’re so inclined.) In return, Lord Tardin fills in the players on the story of
Roburn, Vesgin’s fall into evil, and his brother’s flight from justice — so feel
free to sum up the back story outlined in the “Adventure premise” section for
the players.
As for what comes next, that’s up to you. You can use the map that the player
characters find in area 12 to point the players toward a new adventure of
your own devising; feel free to change the Shrine of Emerald Skulls into any-
thing else you need to describe the dungeon you’d like the player characters
to explore. 
287
Chapter 20: Sample Dungeon: The Necromancer’s Apprentice

Making the Adventure Tougher
The Necromancer’s Apprentice adventure should be reasonably challenging
for a party of four 2nd-level or 3rd-level characters. Some encounters will be
easy, and others should be a little harder. However, if you have more than five
player characters in the party or if the average level of the party is 4th level
or higher, you might want to increase the difficulty of the adventure by
making the fights tougher. Here are a few suggestions:
 Worg Attack: Add a second worg or change the worg into a fiendish dire
wolf (both EL 4).
 Encounter Area 4: The Front Hall: Add a third gnoll (EL 4) or fourth
gnoll (EL 5), or change the gnolls to bugbears (EL 4).
 Encounter Area 7: Roburn’s Sleepless Warriors: Change the six human
warrior skeletons to a single chimera skeleton (EL 4) or three owlbear
skeletons (EL 5).
 Encounter Area 8: Cistern Room: Change the monstrous centipedes to
a single centipede swarm (EL 4).
 Encounter Area 9: The Crypt: Replace the wight with a mummy (EL 5).
Roburn’s story remains the same, except that Vesgin killed and
embalmed him before leaving.
 Encounter Area 11: Nathar’s Workroom: Replace the gnolls with bugbears
(EL 6), or make Nathar a 5th-level necromancer (EL 6). This gives him 4
more hit points and two more spells: vampiric touch and lightning bolt.

Building a
Campaign

In this part . . .
O
kay, you’ve made your own adventure. The next step
for the renaissance Dungeon Master is to turn his or
her game into a campaign. In this section, we discuss how
to build a campaign, how to move from unrelated adven-
tures into a campaign format with ease and elegance, and
how to slowly grow the scope of your campaign. After all,
Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither should your cam-
paign be built in one session!

Chapter 21

M
aybe you’ve run a few games of D&D for your game group. Now you
want to start shaping those early sessions into the beginning of an
ongoing campaign. Sure, you could start over and plan the campaign from 
the beginning, but why go to that trouble if you’ve been having fun and the
players have grown fond of their characters? Those early adventures could
have been unrelated to the Big Story you want to start building, or you can
find dangling plot threads (such as an escaped villain) that you can weave
into the Big Story. Suppose a goblin warrior escaped in one of your first
adventures. The player characters probably were bummed by the fact that
one of the monsters got away, but more than likely they didn’t give it a
second thought after the next encounter or adventure began. What if that
goblin warrior makes a deal with an evil wizard or a demon, or what if he just
happened to be the son of the goblin chieftain? When he shows up again,
more powerful, better equipped, and leading a war band of dangerous gobli-
noids, the player characters are going to be shocked, amazed, and sure that
you planned the whole thing from the beginning. In their eyes, you’re the best
Dungeon Master ever! And that’s just the way it should be.
But how do you build a continuous story for your D&D campaign? Really, you
do it by adding recurring elements one adventure at a time. You might have
the exact picture in your head of where you want the campaign to go, or you
might decide to figure it out along the way, but if you take it one step at a
time, before you know it, you’ll have a campaign developing that keeps the
players guessing and coming back each session to see what happens next.

Building a Campaign
The term campaign refers to the ongoing game created by the Dungeon
Master and his or her fellow players. It follows the linked adventures of a
group of player characters. A campaign can have a single ongoing storyline,
such as the quest to overthrow an evil kingdom, to save the peaceful lands
from the ravages of an escalating war, or to destroy a terrible artifact from
another realm. Then again, a campaign might follow several shorter plots, as
long as the setting and player characters remain more or less the same. 
A good campaign requires a bit more than simply stringing adventures
together. The following sections examine some of the details you should con-
sider as you plan out your D&D campaign.
Creating a world
The core rulebooks for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game suggest a world set in
an era of medieval technology, where magic works and monsters are real. 
As you create your own campaign world, you’ll add details to this world.
Whether you create everything yourself, use an existing campaign setting
(such as FORGOTTEN REALMS or EBERRON), or mix and match between the two
extremes, a campaign is more than a backdrop or a series of related adven-
tures. It’s everything in your imaginary D&D world except for the player char-
acters. A well-run campaign seems to unfold around the player characters,
making them feel a part of something real and exciting. 
Consistency is the key to a good campaign. When the player characters
return to a town for supplies and to rest, they should recognize the place and
the people that inhabit it. After you’ve established a level of consistency,
making occasional changes keeps the campaign vibrant and alive. If the
player characters come back to find that their favorite inn is now being run
by the daughter of their old friend the innkeeper, they experience a change
that doesn’t really affect them directly but makes them feel as though their
characters exist in a living world.
Using context
You need to decide the context in which the player characters are placed.
The context doesn’t need to be obvious right from the beginning (and if
you’re approaching this after a few sessions, it probably isn’t), but after you
292
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

figure it out, you can more easily design adventures and set goals for the
campaign. What’s the setting of your campaign? Will your adventures center
around a frontier town surrounded by monster-infested wilderness? Is there
one gigantic dungeon that the player characters will explore for the first five
or ten levels of their adventuring careers? Or do you expect to present the
heroes with a campaign that features mystery, intrigue, and skullduggery in a
great, decadent city oppressed by evil wizards?
Context might relate to the player characters. Are they mercenaries, or do
they work for a patron? Are they freelance adventurers in it for the gold and
excitement, or do they have a larger sense of purpose that sends them into
the dungeon every week? The initial context you create might have to evolve
based on the decisions the players make when roleplaying their characters;
see “Building on What the Players Give You,” later in this chapter.
The best way to maintain the context and build upon it is to be consistent. 
To keep your campaign consistent, you need to take notes. Be consistent on
names, places, and details — both large and small. If the barmaid the PCs
meet at the Open Door Inn is Lani one week and Kati the next, the illusion of 
a consistent and real world is broken. If the bell over the door to the general
store jingles when the PCs enter the first time, it should jingle every time —
unless you have a reason for making a change. 
Another way to build story and campaign is by keeping track of time. Track
the passing of seasons, the change in the weather, the coming and going of
holidays, the schedule of caravans — all this and more helps you build a cal-
endar for your campaign and give it a sense of time and reality.
Along with the passage of time, use change to show that your campaign is
alive. Events occur all the time in the real world, and they should take place
in your campaign world, as well. Prices rise and fall. New characters come
and go. Dry spells lead to drought. Long periods of rain or snow lead to
floods. Leaders change. New shops open. Not every event needs to lead to an
adventure or be campaign-shattering in nature. They just need to happen to
show that the campaign is alive and things happen regardless of the actions
of the player characters.
On the other hand, the actions of the player characters should also have an
effect on the campaign. If the PCs break the law, they become unwelcome in
the town. If they cause trouble for the local crime lord, they run the risk of
becoming a target of the underworld. If they save the town from a terrible
evil, the town reacts in a positive fashion. Your campaign should be a reac-
tive environment, allowing the actions of the PCs to be catalysts for change
as well as magnets for adventures.
293
Chapter 21: Building a Continuous Story

Building on past events
Use past events from previous adventures to provide motivation, drama, and
consistency. If you use what has gone before to prepare for what is still to
come, you create a campaign that is more than just a series of unrelated
adventures. 
Recurring nonplayer characters provide a powerful tool for bringing the past
back into the present. These can be helpful or ambivalent NPCs, such as vari-
ous town folk who trade with the player characters or provide news and
information on a regular basis. They can also be opponents and villains who
keep coming back to challenge the player characters. Don’t overuse this
technique; when you use recurring characters with care and precision, you
create a more realistic campaign that remembers its past and the past of the
player characters.
Allow the player characters to develop relationships that go beyond the
adventures they participate in. Friendships and rivalries, love interests, men-
tors and patrons, helpful informants — all these relationships and more
should be available to the player characters in your campaign. Let them
develop naturally over time, as recurring characters come into and out of the
lives of the PCs.
Allow for change in the campaign. As the player characters get to know the
campaign world and become comfortable, change things. If the leader of the
night watch has become a trusted and too-often-relied-upon friend to the PCs,
have him killed in the line of duty. If the King’s Road was once peaceful and
well protected, make it become increasingly dangerous to travel. Such
changes intrigue players and make them anxious to find out the reasons
behind them.
When the player characters develop relationships, you can use these to moti-
vate them and spin off adventures. A trusted merchant needs the PCs to pro-
tect a shipment, a friend is kidnapped, or a helpful monastery winds up the
target of an evil enemy. Don’t overuse this technique or the player characters
will never make any attachments, but every so often you can hit them where
it hurts and spur the campaign in a new direction.
Always look for ways to foreshadow future events in current adventures, and
look for opportunities to turn previous events into hints of upcoming plots
even when you didn’t originally plan for it that way. 
294
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

Finding inspiration
Depending on who you ask, there are anywhere from one to a dozen or more
basic stories. Certainly, many D&D adventures follow one of several very
common plot structures — plot structures shared by any number of novels,
295
Chapter 21: Building a Continuous Story

comic book storylines, or action movies. For the purposes of having fun in
your D&D game, feel free to borrow from your favorite sources as you work
on building adventures and campaigns. Obviously, you have to watch out
that you don’t use something that the players will recognize and figure out
immediately, but you can alleviate that by changing and adding details.
Where should you look for inspiration? Start with fantasy novels and movies.
A villain, a plot, a monster, a kingdom — something in your favorite fantasy
novel or movie is just itching to get into your D&D campaign. Change a name,
alter an appearance, give a character a different race or class, and soon 
the inspiration begins to morph into something that is almost completely
your own.
Don’t stop at the fantasy section, though. You can do the same thing with
almost any genre and any medium. That new techno-thriller you just read?
That would make a great D&D adventure! You just need to “fantasy” it up so
that it fits into your campaign. Turn a terrorist cell into a demonic cult, make
a main bad guy a vampire, and change a real city’s name to Waterdeep (for
example), and you have the makings of an exciting series of D&D adventures.
Other sources of inspiration include comic books, movies and television
series of all types, computer games, and any other idea-generating activities
you participate in. You can basically take the story you want to borrow and
perform only the changes necessary to make it into a D&D story, or you can
simply use it as inspiration for storylines of your own creation. A few stories,
endless variation. That’s the secret. Now you know.
Choosing themes for adventures 
and campaigns
Themes help you and the players approach the game. You can have an over-
arching theme for the whole campaign, or you can vary the theme from
adventure to adventure. Remember the original Star Trek television series?
The overarching theme of the series was action and adventure with moral
overtones as Captain Kirk and his crew explored the vast reaches of space.
Every so often, however, the theme varied in individual episodes. The usual
serious episodes (“The City on the Edge of Forever,” for example) sometimes
gave way to lighter fare (such as “A Piece of the Action” or “The Trouble with
Tribbles”). Even so, it still remained Star Trek. You can do the same thing in
your campaign.
In the following subsections, we discuss some themes you might want to
base individual adventures on or perhaps use for your entire campaign.
296
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

Action/adventure
Most D&D adventures and campaigns fall under this theme, where characters
have a task to accomplish and obstacles to overcome. Such adventures are
full of . . . well, action and adventure! It’s the stuff that D&D is made of.
Exploring dungeons, visiting fantastic locations, battling terrible monsters —
that’s D&D! 
We suggest that you use this theme as the overall theme of your campaign,
and then vary the themes of individual adventures every so often for a
change of pace and to keep the players guessing.
Comedy
Comedy is hard. It’s hard to do humor well, hard to maintain through an
entire adventure (let alone an entire campaign), and it often causes game
groups to fall apart because no one takes the game seriously when every-
thing is presented as a joke. 
Don’t present every single thing as a joke in a comedic adventure — doing so
makes it very difficult for the players to take the game seriously and could
cause the game group to fall apart. Remember, many great comedies use a
conventional, ostensibly serious storyline as a place for the gags, wisecracks,
and caricatures to shine.
That said, as a change of pace, a good humorous D&D adventure every now
and then can energize a campaign. When it works, it’s memorable. When it
falls flat, it has the potential to cause irreparable harm to your campaign. The
purpose of a comedy-themed adventure is fun for fun’s sake, setting up
humorous situations that have little or no actual danger or tragedy associ-
ated with them. Plans (both villains’ and player characters’) go awry, amus-
ing NPCs are commonplace, and encounters tend to be strange and peculiar.
Imagine using A Fish Called Wanda or Monty Python and the Holy Grail as the
inspiration for a D&D adventure and you begin to see what a comedy-themed
session could look like.
What might work best for your campaign is to limit the comedic element to
one or two NPCs who show up occasionally to provide comic relief.
Interaction with these NPCs is best handled in small doses.
Espionage
Active and grim, the espionage theme involves political intrigue, spying,
assassination, sabotage, and other cloak-and-dagger activities that usually
require intricate planning, stealth, and roleplaying. This theme is hard to
maintain over the course of an entire campaign, but it makes for powerful
adventures when used sparingly.
297
Chapter 21: Building a Continuous Story

Exploration
Similar to action/adventure, the difference here is that the search and discov-
ery of new places tends to be the point of each adventure and perhaps the
entire campaign. An exploration-themed campaign works if you set up a
strange new land for the player characters to explore and that becomes the
driving force of all your adventures. Although this theme is another example
of a theme that’s hard to sustain over an entire campaign, exploration-
themed adventures form the basis of some of the most memorable game ses-
sions that we’ve ever Dungeon Mastered.
Horror
Horror-themed adventures or campaigns require both the players and their
characters to be scared. This is almost impossible to accomplish unless the
players are willing to get into the mindset and treat the situations you pre-
sent as though they were participating in a horror movie. 
That said, when it works, horror and D&D make for a powerful combination.
For horror to work, it has to be intense and potentially overwhelming.
Because the player characters face monsters on a regular basis, you have to
alter your approach to the monsters in a horror-themed adventure. Keep the
monsters out of sight until the attack comes. Alter the powers and appear-
ances of familiar monsters or use new monsters for the first time in a horror
adventure to surprise and terrify the player characters. Make your descrip-
tions dark, creepy, and menacing. (If the Alien movies were a D&D campaign,
Alien would be a horror-themed adventure and Aliens would be an
action/adventure-themed adventure.)
Mystery
This is another theme that’s hard to maintain for an entire campaign but can
be used very effectively in specific adventures. A mystery is something to
solve, whether it’s a murder or a robbery or something else. One way to use
mystery as the theme of a campaign is to set up a Big Mystery that the player
characters must solve over the course of many adventures. Who killed the
player characters’ mentor and set them on the path of adventuring? Where
are the strange draconic monsters coming from? Who really controls the Cult
of the Red Hand? If clues to the Big Mystery are revealed every few adven-
tures, and some adventures relate directly to the Big Mystery, you’re using
mystery as the theme of your campaign. You can see examples of this theme
over the course of a campaign in television series such as Twin Peaks, 24, X-
Files, and Supernatural.
Revenge
Revenge works as the theme of a campaign as long as not every adventure in
the campaign focuses on it. When the player characters must hunt down the
298
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

one-armed mind flayer that murdered their mentor or work to undermine the
evil king who ordered the destruction of their village, revenge is the motivation
for their adventuring and the theme of your campaign. The same holds true
when you use it as the theme for specific adventures. As with any long-term
theme, revenge works best if you provide ways for the player characters to
have small victories along the way. If after a hundred adventures the player
characters are no closer to finding the one-armed mind flayer, the players will
feel frustrated and cheated. (Revenge is best served cold, not frozen solid.)
The payoff has to come sometime, and then maybe it’s time to end the cam-
paign and start something new or to spin off the campaign in a new direction
with a new theme.
The Dungeon-of-the-Week 
Campaign Model
You’re building a campaign. You’ve selected a theme. How do you get it to 
roll out from game session to game session? Use the tried and true television
series model — the dungeon-of-the-week campaign! Your campaign is just like
your favorite ongoing television series. The player characters are just like the
continuing characters in the show. Like the crew of the Enterprise (pick your
favorite model and era), they set off on an exploration mission — but the PCs
explore the depths of the dungeon instead of the depths of space. Like the
title characters from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel and their friends,
they fight monsters every week, often saving the world (literally) through
their efforts.
If you imagine that your campaign is a television series, you can follow the
same rules as used for any ongoing story. You want to establish certain
ground rules. For example, almost anything can happen between the start
and end of any particular episode or game session, just so long as things are
put back mostly as they were by the climax. Sure, you can and should allow
for major changes to occur, but you can control those changes and what they
mean for your campaign. You want to treat each adventure as the next
episode in your ongoing storyline. Some relate directly to the overall theme
of your campaign, and some are side treks that explore a different theme and
show off a different aspect of your world.
The easiest campaign to build uses the dungeon-of-the-week model (even
though some dungeons might take more than one session to complete). Each
time you need a new adventure, you create a new dungeon. Populate it with
encounters worthy of the level of the player characters, and create a memo-
rable villain to serve as the main antagonist or boss monster (see Chapter 22 for
299
Chapter 21: Building a Continuous Story

more on creating villains). Just as the two brothers in the TV show Supernatural
go to a new town each episode to deal with a new monster, so too do the player
characters in your campaign go to a new dungeon each adventure.
Building on What the Players Give You
Our last bit of advice about campaign building is simple: Use what the play-
ers give you. It’s their story, too. Many players like to create interesting back
stories for their characters, or think up long-term story goals and aspirations.
For example, a player might decide that her wizard character hopes to learn
the secrets of a long-forgotten tradition of elven high magic someday, or
maybe another player says that his barbarian character is the last survivor 
of a tribe massacred by undead giants. Look for opportunities to incorporate
these player-invented plots into adventures from time to time. Not only does
it give you grist for your creative mill, you’re guaranteed to provide an adven-
ture that is immediately compelling to at least one of the players at the table.
Keep your ears open when the players are discussing the events of the
adventure — you’ll often hear them make suggestions that you never thought
of but you just have to use. So use them! Later, the players will think they
were clever for having figured it out, and you never have to let them know
that they actually came up with the idea.
That’s why we love to make the players recap the previous game session at
the start of the current one. Let the players tell you what they think hap-
pened. This often leads them to speculate, toss around ideas, and come up
with something you never thought of. Why should you do all the work? If the
players want to give you ideas (even if they don’t realize it), be willing to take
them. It’s that inspiration thing again. Take inspiration for your campaign
from all sources, including the players. If anyone is thinking about the cam-
paign anywhere near as much as you are, it’s them. Let them help you. The
campaign will be stronger because of it.

Creating Memorable Villains

V
illains come in all shapes and sizes. From master villains to minor vil-
lains, evil overlords to minions and lackeys, every heroic player charac-
ter needs a villain to battle and defeat.
In this chapter, we look at villains and how to turn them into memorable
parts of your D&D game.
What Is a Villain?
Player characters can have lots of foes, but they should have only a few vil-
lains. When we talk about villains, we mean the main antagonists, the boss
NPCs or monsters and their chief lieutenants in an adventure, not the many
minions and monsters that populate the bulk of a dungeon. A villain is more
than a random monster or enemy (though every dungeon and adventure
needs those, too). A villain is the evil behind the adventure, the catalyst that
sends the player characters into action (whether they realize the connection
or not). 
For an NPC or monster to be a villain, he or she (or it) must possess most or
all of the following qualities:
 Villains (directly or indirectly) oppose the player characters, forcing
them to take action and make decisions.
 Villains are powerful adversaries, commanding great resources. Villains
might not be able to defeat the player characters in direct melee
combat, but with the resources at their command, they will have many
guards and should be able to give the PCs a run for their money.

 Villains should be, for the most part, unsympathetic. Most villains
should be despised and hated by the player characters.
 Villains want to do the wrong thing. Their motives and goals should be
excessive, selfish, and to the detriment of others. Evil is what villains do.
 Villains need to be hated, but in a good way. You’ve done your job if
you’ve created a villain that engages the emotions of the players and
makes them love to hate the character. 
You might be tempted to create villains with complex and “realistic” motives,
but here’s the deal: You don’t have to work very hard to make a villain make
sense. In the fantastic world of D&D, villains can be starkly, irredeemably evil.
Crazed cultists and bloodthirsty orcs don’t turn to evil because of traumatic
events in their past, social alienation, psychological disorders, or bad
choices. They can just be evil, pure and simple. Keeping things “black and
white” rather than drawn in shades of gray is good because you’re letting the
players know that their characters can concentrate on defeating evil, not
understanding it or redeeming it. Morally ambiguous villains should defi-
nitely be the exception, and not the rule.
Every Hero Needs a Good Villain
Heroes have always been defined by the villains that oppose them. Peter Pan
and Captain Hook. Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. Luke Skywalker and Darth
Vader. Each of these heroes are tied to their villains in ways that go beyond
simple storytelling. The villains are the heroes’ mirror images, potential
selves, and polar opposites all at the same time.
When you consider villains for player characters, remember that the villain
might have a particular hatred for a specific character, but usually serves as
the nemesis for the entire party. Because of the ongoing nature of a D&D cam-
paign, you might want to think of villains in the same way that comic book
superheroes have rogues’ galleries. Batman can’t fight the Joker every issue,
so the writers and artists invented Penguin, Two-Face, and Riddler. In the
same way, the player characters in your campaign shouldn’t have to battle
the same orc leader every adventure. Although not every adventure needs an
arch villain that will hound the heroes across multiple story arcs, you do need
to populate most adventures with a master villain and a few minor villains, in
addition to the various monsters and obstacles that pop up along the way.
Good villains take work
What makes a good villain? You want the villains you create (or at least the
majority of them) to be plausible. Flesh them out. Give some thought as to
302
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

why a villain is doing what it is he or she is doing. How does a villain interact
with the rest of your adventure story? With the other denizens of a dungeon?
If you think that your villains are just bad guys for the player characters to
defeat, so will the players.
Villains don’t have to be stupid. Make your villains, or at least the majority of
them, smart. Some can be evil geniuses, some can just be savvy, and once in
a while a few can be powerful and dumb. Play them as smart as you want
them to be, but no more or less than that. A bugbear chieftain might not be a
brilliant strategist, but he can still be cagey and wily and able to match wits
with the player characters. A mind flayer master villain, on the other hand,
might be so intelligent as to have an amazing number of contingency plans
and multiple schemes within schemes unfolding at any given time.
Don’t be afraid to make some of your villains truly evil. Betrayal, devious lies,
and hideous acts of evil for evil’s sake allow you to paint compelling pictures
of your villains. And when the player characters see them for the evil creatures
they are, the feeling of success for defeating them will be that much sweeter.
On the other hand, not all antagonists need to be evil. Sometimes rivals will
appear to challenge the player characters, and these rivals can be good-
meaning nonplayer characters or even monsters with their own agendas.
Setting up an opponent who the player characters can’t or don’t want to fight
directly can make for an interesting change of pace.
Give villains every chance to succeed
The diabolical dragon lord, the evil royal wizard, the murderous bounty
hunter with a taste for blood — the range of intelligent villains is endless.
Make your villains memorable, and they will become the hated foes of the
player characters without any special effort on your part. Some villains can
be recurring antagonists that appear from time to time to harass the player
characters; others can be designed to serve that purpose for only the span of
a single adventure.
A well-crafted villain must also be a well-played villain. Here are some ways to
play a villain well:
 Don’t let a major villain confront the player characters too early in the
adventure. Use lackeys and other minions to fight for the villain when-
ever possible. Eventually, you want to give the player characters the sat-
isfaction of confronting and defeating the villain, but not until the time is
right. The right time is usually at the climax of the adventure.
 Use every available resource to foil the player characters. Villains
should be sneaky and resourceful. Some villains can hide in plain sight,
and others have vast wealth and power at their command. The villain’s
303
Chapter 22: Creating Memorable Villains

tactics depend on the role you want the villain to play in the adventure
and campaign. Keep in mind that for every ability that the player charac-
ters have, there is usually a way for a villain to counter it.
 Sometimes, give a villain the opportunity to confront the player char-
acters and get away. Use this technique if you want the villain to meet
the PCs early in an adventure or if you want the villain to become a
recurring character. Create escape plans for some of your villains.
Through misdirection, disguises, secret passages, magic, and swarms of
minions, you can give a villain a chance to get away. Don’t force the
issue, though. If the player characters come up with a way to circumvent
the plan, let them. You can always create a new villain as a replacement.
 Don’t let the player characters fight on their terms. A smart villain fights
the player characters from a place of strength and only when he or she is
well and truly prepared. Confronting villains in their strongholds isn’t the
smartest thing for the player characters to do, but it should be the only
place major villains are willing to put their own lives on the line.
Villain Archetypes
Villains come in two basic forms: master villain and minor villain. An adven-
ture or even an entire campaign should have a single master villain, but it can
have as many minor villains as you feel comfortable including. Minor villains
allow the player characters to gain small victories along the way without con-
fronting the master villain too early. 
If you ask seven different creative people to define archetypes for master and
minor villains, you’ll get seven similar but different answers. In the following
sections, we provide our version of the master and minor villain archetypes
most appropriate for use in a D&D game.
Master villains
The master villain stands at the center of the evil plot, working to achieve
some evil goal through the use of evil means. We’re talking evil villains here,
not adversaries who might be good but oppose the player characters as rivals.
The following list describes archetypes that would fit as master villains into
most D&D campaigns:
 Agent provocateur: This is the clever spy who infiltrates an organization
and works to destroy it from the inside. For example, how better to bring
down a church devoted to law and order than to place a hidden agent of
chaos high within its ranks? The identity of this master villain usually
304
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

remains a closely guarded secret until the end of the adventure or series
of adventures that he or she is associated with, and he or she strews
lots of deception and false trails along the way.
 Avenger: This is the villain who seeks to right a real or imagined wrong,
but in the most heinous way possible. He or she seeks to ruin and ulti-
mately destroy the object of the seething anger, perhaps in one-on-one
battle, by destroying wealth and reputation or by using a death trap of
some sort.
 Conqueror: The conqueror wants to seize control. He or she could be a
warlord leading a vast army, or could be after control of an organization,
a place, or a person. This villain wants to be the center of attention, the
leader, and wants to gain this position by the force of his or her own will
and the strengths that make him or her stand out from the common folk.
 Corruptor: The corruptor seeks to change the pure into impure, the
orderly into the chaotic. On a small scale, the corruptor seeks to darkly
influence a single character or group of characters, such as a king,
priest, or town council. On a large scale, the corruptor seeks to alter an
organization, city, or nation, turning it from a thing of law and order to a
thing of chaos and confusion. In D&D campaigns, the corruptor can be
an evil god or a demon prince as often as a human or a monster.
 Destroyer: The destroyer has one goal — to cause destruction. Instead
of conquering or corrupting a nation or an organization, he or she wants
to destroy it. Destroyers might have a reason for wanting to cause death
and destruction, but they might also simply want to cause destruction
for destruction’s sake. (Villains don’t need to be complex!)
 Master thief: The master thief wants the prize and usually has a grand
plan for getting it. Gold, jewels, artifacts, ancient tomes . . . if it has
worth, value, and a hint of power, the master thief can’t wait to lay
hands upon it. No challenge is too great, no vault secure enough to stop
master thieves from plying their trade.
 Organizer: Some villains control vast syndicates, such as the Thieves’
Guild or a slaver ring. Using brains, influence, and an army of underlings,
the organizer sits at the center of a web of intrigue to control criminal
activities of one sort or another. 
 Ravager: Another version of the destroyer, the ravager uses terror as a
means of operation. Why just destroy a village if you can terrorize (and
have fun with) the villagers first? Such is the method used by this vile
villain.
 Zealot: The zealot follows a cause to the detriment of everything else,
seeking to re-create the world (or a portion thereof) in the image of his
or her beliefs. These beliefs can be philosophical, political, or religious
in nature, and the zealot can work alone or as the head of a widespread
organization.
305
Chapter 22: Creating Memorable Villains

Minor villains
Minor villains are the trusted lieutenants of the boss monsters, servants of
the master villains but on a level above the typical minions and lackeys most
often employed to trouble the player characters.
The following archetypes work well as minor villains in most D&D campaigns:
 Advance agent: This is the vanguard for some sort of invasion, whether
of an enemy army or of supernatural forces from another plane of exis-
tence. The advance agent sets the stage and hints of greater threats to
come, all the while accomplishing things that make it easier for the next
part of the invasion to take place.
 Assassin: This is the favorite killing tool of the master villain, a powerful
and deadly enemy in his or her own right who has no regard for life and
is totally loyal to his or her master.
 Corrupted hero: What master villain doesn’t have an ex-hero in his
employ? This character shows the dark side of the player characters
and shows what happens when a hero falls to evil. A corrupted hero usu-
ally has a player character class, such as fighter or ranger or wizard.
 Inquisitor: When master villains needs answers, they turn to the inquisi-
tor. The inquisitor is trained in torture and intimidation, and he or she
enjoys inflicting pain and suffering on others to do the job.
 Soldier: Many lieutenants serving master villains fall into this category.
Trained in battle and tempered by past campaigns, the soldier is experi-
enced, competent, and persistent in the execution of his or her task.
 Thug: A thug has a single job in any master villain’s organization — to
fight as told and without thinking. The thug is more powerful than the
typical minions serving the master villain and is often used to fill key
encounters in an adventure.

In This Chapter
 Starting small and building out
 Dissecting the parts of a world
 Bringing all the elements together
You’re an expert at crafting fun and exciting adventures. You’ve taken a
shot at making memorable master villains to plague the player charac-
ters. You’ve begun to link the adventures together to start building your cam-
paign. Now you have to put everything in context and start fleshing out the
world beyond the dungeons and other specific locations the player charac-
ters have visited. 
When it comes to world building, you can get as complex as you want or keep
it simple. For examples of fully detailed worlds, take a look at published cam-
paign setting books such as Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting and Eberron
Campaign Setting.
We advise you to keep things simple to start out with for your home-brewed
world, but you can take the tips we provide in this chapter and make your
world as simple or as complex and detailed as you like. You can create what-
ever details you want to craft a living, breathing campaign world. 
The World in a Nutshell: 
The DM’s Notebook
When you’re ready to go beyond one-time adventures and start building a
world for your campaign, you need to get organized. Even if you keep your
world relatively simple and small, you have a lot more maps, notes, timelines,
and all other sorts of details to keep track of for a world than you do for a
dungeon or one-time adventure.

A really helpful tool when it comes to developing your campaign world is the
DM’s notebook. All you need for a DM notebook are some folders or a binder in
which you collect the following items, adding pieces as you build your world:
 Maps: You should have maps for your world, from large-scale maps that
depict the entire world, down to maps of regions or countries, to maps
of towns and dungeons. You don’t have to create all of these maps until
you need them, of course, but make sure that your DM’s notebook con-
tains all the maps you’ve drawn for previous and current adventures in
your world.
 Notes: You should keep the notes for your world in your DM notebook.
You might find it helpful to organize your notes into the following cate-
gories and place them in separate folders in your DM notebook:
• Notes about the various places of interest in your world, such as
dungeons, castles, towns, and so on, including any historical or
background information you’ve created for those areas
• A calendar and/or timeline for the campaign’s world
• Character sheets for major and minor villains and other impor-
tant NPCs
• Notes on minor NPCs
• Notes on past adventures, including treasure collected, monsters
defeated, and plot developments you want to remember
• Up-to-date copies of each of the players’ character sheets
• Notes of long-term goals of the player characters
• Notes regarding any house rules you’re using
Building a World from the Inside Out:
Start Small and Add Details
What do you need in order to establish the basis of your campaign? You’ve
already begun if you’ve gathered a team of players and run through a couple
adventures. Now you need to set up a base for the player characters, a place
where they can rest, train, obtain healing, buy equipment, and get missions.
For low-level characters, a village or small town is all you need to set up. Just
make sure the village has an inn, a church or temple, a general store, and
some kind of mentor or group of patrons who can train the player characters
through the first few levels of experience.
Take a look at the map of Griffonford presented in Chapter 8. That’s a good
example of a town map. You can always add detail and new locations as you
308
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

need them. The trick is not to worry about the parts of the world that the
player characters aren’t going to see right away. Leave the kingdom and the
world map for later. Just concentrate on your town or village and the adven-
turing sites that are nearby.
As the player characters gain levels, you can start expanding your world out-
ward in a circle from the starting areas, so that you have ready locations for
whichever direction the PCs decide to follow. Sooner rather than later, your
campaign world — or at least the parts of it that you’re using — starts to take
shape. Keep the details simple until you know where the player characters
want to go next, and then you can develop the next portion of your world map,
complete with environmental notes, adventuring sites, and the next community
where the PCs can get training, equipment, and rumors of adventure.
Don’t do more than you need to. When film makers build movie sets, they
make only the portions that they need for the scene. Walls and rooms are half
built, and doors lead to nowhere. Follow the same approach as you develop
your campaign world: Determine where things are only as you need them. If
the player characters aren’t going to cross the mountains until they reach
10th level, you don’t need to do the work necessary to populate that region
until they get close to that point in their adventuring careers.
Conversely, don’t feel constrained to creating only the areas the PCs are
about to explore. Keep it simple, but if you really enjoy the process of creat-
ing the world, do whatever you feel like. Just don’t spend so much time creat-
ing the unexplored continent that you don’t put enough detail in the secret
valley that the player characters will explore in the next game session.
Putting the World Together
You’re ready to start piecing your campaign world together. We advise you to
start small, detailing and nailing down only what you absolutely have to. 
But what do you really need? You need to fix any locations already encoun-
tered in any adventures you have run to date. Begin by marking down on
your setting map or recording in your notes the sites of dungeons, towns,
ruins, and other such features the PCs have already explored. In addition to
these locales, consider what else might be necessary to sustain the illusion of
reality for your imaginary campaign setting.
Player characters need a base of operations, a place where they can return
after an adventure to rest, purchase supplies, and train. From 1st to 3rd level
or so, a small town works best for this, though a village can suffice in a pinch.
You certainly don’t have to figure out who all the 2,000 people living in the
small town are, but you do need to put some thought into the places the
309
Chapter 23: Bringing the World to Life

player characters are likely to visit. These places include the inn or tavern,
the general store, the magic shop, the weapons shop, the local church or
temple, the local keepers of the peace and other authority figures, and
anyone who can serve as trainers for the characters.

Part IV: Building a Campaign 

You need to decide on the climate and geography for the area around your
starting village or town. A temperate climate probably works best and usually
presents the easiest solution. Geography should be a mix of terrain types,
including forest, hills, and plains to start. Make a simple map that shows the
relative locations and shape of the land, using the map of Griffonford as a
guide (see Chapter 8). Then you need to add other locations of interest,
including encounter sites from previous adventures you have run for this
group of player characters.
Climate and geography
The great thing about a fantasy setting is that you can just make things up.
Still, you want to apply some level of logic to the world you build. Don’t put a
scorched desert next to an arctic plain, for example, unless you come up with
a fantastical reason for such a juxtaposition to exist. Chapter Five of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide covers this and related topics in greater detail, but
we discuss the basics in this section.
You really need to consider only three basic climate types when building a
D&D campaign world:
 Cold climates resemble arctic and subarctic regions on Earth and usu-
ally feature winter conditions throughout most of the year. Portions of
your world can have a cold climate, or you can make the climate persis-
tent throughout much of the land. Bear in mind that adventurers need
special gear or magic to deal with cold.
 Temperate climates enjoy approximately equal periods of warm and
cold seasons throughout the year. 
If you set up a campaign that takes place mostly in a temperate climate,
remember to keep a calendar so that you can make the seasons pass as
the game progresses.
 Warm climates range from subtropical to tropical environments, featur-
ing summer (or hotter) conditions for most of the year. In extremely
warm regions, adventurers might suffer adverse conditions for wearing a
lot of armor and carrying a load of equipment.
Likewise, you can keep it simple for the geography of your world. A fantasy
setting doesn’t need to have complex geology, ecosystems, and environ-
ments. Consider eight basic geographic types as you construct your D&D
campaign world:
 Aquatic geography consists mainly of salt or fresh water, such as lakes,
oceans, rivers, and inland seas.
311
Chapter 23: Bringing the World to Life

 Desert describes any dry area that has little to no vegetation. 
Warm deserts resemble places like Death Valley and the Sahara, and cold
deserts appear much like Antarctica. Player characters need to deal 
with survival issues in this kind of terrain, not the least of which is acquir-
ing food and water (though magic can help in this).
 Forest terrain features large tracts of tree-covered land. Food and water
are usually plentiful, and animal life is abundant.
 Hills describe rugged, raised terrain that doesn’t reach the level of
mountainous. 
 Marsh terrain features low, flat, waterlogged areas, such as what is usu-
ally found in swamps and bogs. Travel through marshes can be difficult
if not treacherous.
 Mountains feature high elevation, little level ground, and decreasing
sources of food and water the higher you ascend. Travel is difficult and
often requires special equipment.
 Plains describe any relatively flat area that isn’t also one of the other
terrain types covered. Food and water are usually plentiful in a plains
region.
 Underground describes subterranean passages and caverns. The D&D
game assumes that there is a vast expanse of underground areas
(whether they’re naturally occurring, made by people or monsters, or
both) where many adventures take place. 
The Dungeon Master’s Guide features a good discussion on demographics,
population centers, and the types of resources that can generally be found
there. Check out Chapter Five: Campaigns, especially the material on pages
136–139.
Sites of interest
By sites of interest, we mean the places you expect the PCs to explore and
adventure in. These sites should be scattered across your world map, and
you can add new ones whenever you see fit. 
You want to create enough sites of interest in the region to sustain the PCs
adventure needs at least through the level to which the PCs home base can
support their needs. When the PCs can no longer get the weapons, armor,
magical supplies, and other equipment appropriate for their levels in the local
settlement or town, they should move on to a larger, more populated area.
The following subsections describe some of the sites of interest that you
should add to your world’s map as places the PCs will eventually explore.
312
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

Castles
Castles and other kinds of keeps and strongholds guard the land, providing
places of protection for the population, barracks for soldiers, and supply cen-
ters for armies. Somewhere in your starting area there should be a few of
these structures, though perhaps not immediately near your starting village
or town. Of course, larger and more important centers of civilization should
get larger castles, but small towns and village might have only a keep to pro-
tect them. Evil warlords and rival kingdoms also maintain castles, and you
can use these as adventure sites for when the player characters are ready to
take on such a challenge.
Ruins
No campaign is complete without a few crumbling towers, abandoned tem-
ples, ruined castles, or forgotten cities hidden in the swamps and forests of
your world. Ruins can reveal historical secrets about your campaign, and
most serve as great adventure sites due to the large concentration of mon-
sters that often make ruins into lairs. Ruins can be obvious and known or
hidden and yet to be discovered. They can exist in the wilderness, away from
settlements, or they can serve as the foundation upon which current settle-
ments have been constructed.
Dungeons
You can place dungeons wherever you need them to be. They take the form
of carefully constructed complexes or natural caverns that snake through
hillsides and underground. Sewer networks, basements, and actual dungeons
fall into the category of man-made (or monster-made) dungeons, and exten-
sive cavern systems can link caves that are dozens or hundreds of miles
apart, forming regions of sunless expanse often referred to as the Underdark.
All these places usually hold terrors and treasures beyond imagining, waiting
for player characters to explore.
Monster lairs
When you consider placing monster lairs, don’t worry about every cave or
crack or crevice that hides a monster. Concentrate on the places where the
unusually tough or intelligent creatures live, or the areas occupied by large
congregations of monsters. The bandits hiding in the old mine, the medusa’s
macabre garden of victims turned to stone, a dragon’s treasure cave, and the
cemetery haunted by wights or wraiths all come to mind as places worthy of
entries on your constantly growing campaign map. Side treks, filler encoun-
ters, and adventures on the fly can all be thrown together quickly if you have
a handful of monster lairs sitting in your notebook.
313
Chapter 23: Bringing the World to Life

Not all monster lairs need to focus on dangerous creatures or threats to the
player characters. A grove of friendly treants, the grazing grounds of a herd of
unicorns, and a druid’s circle are all examples of friendly to neutral monster
lairs that the player characters might have reason to visit from time to time.
You can even set up special arrangements where monsters that are usually
considered to be enemies have worked out a deal with a nearby settlement
that allows each side to exist more or less in peace.
Even though a D&D world is imaginary and fantastic, you want to put just a
little consideration into the ecology of your campaign. For example, when
you place a settlement, you also need to consider how that settlement feeds
itself. Does its citizens hunt and gather from a large forest, fish from a river or
lake, or support itself with vast tracts of farmland? Consider these kinds of
questions when choosing locations for monster lairs. Are there enough prey
animals available in the area for a large, predatory monster? How do nearby
monsters interact with each other? Do they assist each other, ignore each
other, or fight each other at every opportunity? You don’t need to get too
technical, because it’s just a game and it is a fantasy, but some amount of
forethought can help add a touch of realism to your campaign. Check out a
monster’s entry in the Monster Manual for some ecological information, and
then use your own imagination to make it fit into your campaign. 
Unusual phenomena
To accentuate the fantastic nature of your D&D world, be sure to judiciously
include a few places that just couldn’t exist in the real world. Nothing says
you’re in a place of magic more than areas that inspire awe, wonder, and 
even fear.
A waterfall of lava, a forest of wild magic, a lake of glowing liquid that heals
whoever bathes in it, and a blasted patch of badlands where magic doesn’t
work are all example of sites of unusual phenomena. Let your imagination go
wild. How about a village where the fog never dissipates? Or a range of hills
where spectacular and deadly fountains of fire erupt without warning? Or an
ancient cliffside where a deep crack in the rock echoes with the warnings of
tragedies to come? Make these sites strange and spectacular and a little oth-
erworldly, and the player characters will certainly want to investigate them
and find out more about them.
Don’t go overboard with unusual phenomena and create dozens or hundreds
of them throughout your world. If you overuse this element, each one will feel
commonplace and less fantastic.
314
Part IV: Building a Campaign 

Other settlements
As the player characters strike out deeper into your world, they should
encounter other settlements of intelligent beings. Some of these should be
human or elf or dwarf settlements, or even places where the common races
mix and meet. Others can be settlements of monsters, such as places where
goblinoids or orcs gather. Vary the size and wealth of these settlements.
Include more thorps, hamlets, and villages across the landscape than cities
and metropolises. Check out the discussion on generating towns and commu-
nities in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, starting on page 137, for a detailed look
at this topic.
Now, you don’t have do all the work necessary to flesh out something as large
and complex as a city by yourself. Wizards of the Coast publishes two cam-
paign supplements that detail and populate two fantasy cities, Waterdeep and
Sharn. City of Splendors: Waterdeep is a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign supple-
ment that details a grand city on the edge of a busy sea. For something differ-
ent, check out Sharn: City of Towers, an EBERRON campaign supplement that
explores a vertical metropolis on the coast of a mighty river. With detailed city
maps, ready-to-use NPCs, and a wealth of adventure hooks, there’s no reason
we can think of for not using one or both of these products as the basis for a
city in your campaign. You can use the cities exactly as written and drop them
wherever you like in your campaign, or you can make modifications to names
and other details so that the cities better suit your world’s needs.
315
Chapter 23: Bringing the World to Life
Steal this campaign setting!
You can certainly do all the work of world build-
ing yourself, but there are other options. The
D&D game is bolstered by two ongoing cam-
paign settings: FORGOTTEN REALMS and EBERRON.
The Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting book
presents a world that is very much a traditional
D&D setting and is easy to use as is or to
borrow elements from to create your own cam-
paign world. In the Eberron Campaign Setting
book, on the other hand, you’ll find a world that
has more of an attitude and an air of action that
harkens back to pulp adventures. Both of these
settings are fully DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. You can
play them straight up as written, modify them, or
steal from them to make your own world.
However you use them and the supplements
that support them, they make great resources
for content-hungry campaigns like yours.

Chapter 24
Ten Best Classic Adventures
H
ere are our choices for the ten best D&D adventures from the original
1st Edition of the game. We present these for nostalgia, for posterity,
and to show you some of the roots of the game that really influenced us back
when we started playing.
We’ve arranged these adventures in chronological order, beginning with the
oldest. The odd letter and number combinations (“S1,” “S2,” and so on) are
series codes designed to help readers identify which modules belonged with
each other. Sometimes this indicated that the adventures actually formed a
series of sequential adventures (such as the “A” series or “T” series), but
more often, the series code didn’t really mean much.
All of these adventures were published in the 1st Edition Advanced Dungeons
& Dragons game. They’re long out of print, but many long-time D&D players still
talk about favorite traps, monsters, villains, and puzzles from these classics.
S1–Tomb of Horrors
by Gary Gygax; published by TSR, Inc., 1978
This adventure for character levels 8–14 features a trap-filled tomb of a 
dead wizard and a book of illustrations to show to players as the adventure
unfolds. This was the original “deathtrap dungeon,” and many of the traps
killed characters just for making poor choices — not many saving throws
here! Anyone who has played the D&D game since 1st Edition has a story or
two about how their characters died in this early classic. In 1998, designer
Bruce R. Cordell revisited this classic in the outstanding 2nd Edition adven-
ture Return to the Tomb of Horrors, which greatly expanded on the original.

G1–Steading of the Hill Giant Chief
by Gary Gygax; published by TSR, Inc., 1978
The first AD&D adventure module ever published, this adventure for charac-
ter levels 8–12 kicks off the “G” series of modules that pit the player charac-
ters against a variety of giants types, starting with hill giants. Other titles in
this series include The Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl and Hall of the Fire
Giant King.
D1–Descent into the Depths of the Earth
by Gary Gygax; published by TSR, Inc., 1978
This adventure for character levels 9–14 kicked off the “D” series of adventures
that take the player characters into the underground world of the drow — the
wildly popular dark elves of D&D lore. Other titles in the series include Shrine
of the Kuo-Toa and Vault of the Drow. It was designed as a sequel to the “G”
series of modules.
S2–White Plume Mountain
by Lawrence Schick; published by TSR, Inc., 1979
This adventure presents a classic dungeon crawl for character levels 5–10. In
it, the player characters must make their way through a complex dungeon
beneath an active volcano while overcoming the magical traps devised by an
insane wizard. White Plume Mountain introduced three of the most notorious
magic items ever created for the D&D game, including the powerful sword
Blackrazor.
A1–Slave Pits of the Undercity
by David “Zeb” Cook; published by TSR, Inc., 1980
This adventure kicked off a four-part series where the player characters
(levels 4–7) tried to defeat a band of slavers while dealing with a number of
ingenious situations. Other titles in the series include Secret of the Slavers’
Stockade, Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords, and In the Dungeons of the
Slave Lords, which starts with the player characters trapped without any
weapons or armor deep beneath a volcanic island.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

C1–The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan
by Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason; published by TSR, Inc., 1980
Originally a convention tournament scenario, this adventure for character
levels 5–8 sends the player characters into a Mayan-style temple full of sur-
prising traps and devious tricks. It includes an illustration booklet of what
the characters see in specific encounters.
Q1–Queen of the Demonweb Pits
by David C. Sutherland III with Gary Gygax; published by TSR, Inc., 1980
This sequel to the “D” series of modules presents an epic adventure for char-
acter levels 10–14. It sends the player characters to another plane of exis-
tence to defeat the evil demigod of the drow, Lolth. It featured an amazing
map of the maze-like Demonweb Pits.
I3–Pharaoh
by Tracy and Laura Hickman; published by TSR, Inc., 1982
The first in the Desert of Desolation series, this Egyptian-inspired adventure
for character levels 5–7 includes a pyramid map and a trap-filled maze. Other
adventures in this series include Oasis of the White Palm and Lost Tomb of
Martek. Later, Tracy Hickman would go on to help create the DRAGONLANCE
campaign setting.
I6–Ravenloft
by Tracy and Laura Hickman; published by TSR, Inc., 1983
Perhaps our favorite D&D adventure of all time, this scenario for character
levels 5–7 takes the Dracula legend and gives it a D&D spin. With isometric
maps that were ahead of their time, alternate plotlines, and an amazing
amount of storytelling crammed into such a small space, this adventure
inspired game designers and Dungeon Masters to take the art of adventure
creation to the next level. It set the stage for gothic D&D and led to the cre-
ation of the RAVENLOFT campaign setting.
321
Chapter 24: Ten Best Classic Adventures

T1–4–The Temple of Elemental Evil
by Gary Gygax with Frank Mentzer; published by TSR, Inc., 1985
This was the one we were all waiting for in the early days of D&D. In 1979,
T1–The Village of Hommlet was published, hinting at the terrible Temple of
Elemental Evil and promising a sequel to make your hair stand on end. Six
years later, the massive dungeon finally came out as a single book that included
the original Hommlet adventure. With two towns, the temple, and four large
dungeon levels, this was the grandfather of all huge dungeon crawls.

Ten Best Dungeon Magazine
Adventures
O
ne of the best sources of adventure material available is Dungeon
Magazine, the sister publication of Dragon Magazine. Dungeon Magazine
has been around for almost 20 years, and as of the time of this book’s publi-
cation, it’s on its 135th issue. For about $7 a shot, you get three or four pro-
fessionally developed, illustrated, and edited D&D adventures, each of which
provides you with weeks of great gaming. You can’t find a better value in
gaming.
For this chapter, we asked the folks at Paizo Publishing (publishers of both
magazines) to give us their picks for the best ten adventures to appear in
Dungeon Magazine during the current edition of the D&D game. James
Jacobs, Erik Mona, and Jeremy Walker of Paizo Publishing sat down and
hashed out a list based on the feedback they’ve seen from their readers and
their own likes and dislikes. Thousands of D&D players from all around the
world have enjoyed countless hours of gaming in these highly regarded
adventures; we think it’s a pretty good list.
We decided to stick to 3rd Edition adventures for this chapter, just because we
felt that you, the reader, would get more benefit from a list of adventures you
could easily get your hands on if you were so inclined. Dungeon Magazine
boasts a number of outstanding adventures from the previous game editions,
too, but you might have a hard time finding older issues or converting these
adventures to the current edition of the game.
Now, in reverse chronological order (most recent first, older adventures
later), we present the top ten Dungeon Magazine adventures.
The Age Of Worms Adventure Path
Issues #124 through #135; all character levels; by Erik Mona, Mike Mearls,
Sean K. Reynolds, Jason Bulmahn, Tito Leati, Wolfgang Baur, Jesse Decker,
Richard Pett, Nicolas Logue, Greg A. Vaughan, and James Jacobs

This isn’t just one adventure — it’s 12, a whole year of Dungeon goodness.
Age of Worms is a series of sequential adventures by a number of different
authors. Taken together, they comprise a complete D&D campaign that takes
the player characters from 1st to 20th level. Age of Worms pits the adventur-
ers against the cult of the worm-god Kyuss and his armies of undead minions,
including some of the most hideous and terrifying undead monstrosities yet
conceived for the game. Along the way, the heroes have chances to become
gladiators fighting in desperate arena battles, recover powerful magical arti-
facts, and eventually rule a kingdom of their own.
The Shackled City Adventure Path
Various issues beginning in #97 and continuing through #116; all character
levels; by Christopher Perkins, James Jacobs, David Noonan, Tito Leati,
Jesse Decker, and Chris Thomasson
We cheated again; the Shackled City adventure path consists of eight adven-
tures appearing in various issues between #97 and #116. This was the first
complete campaign to appear in a serialized format in Dungeon Magazine. In
the Shackled City adventures, the player characters must investigate, expose,
and defeat a sinister cult that aims to convert a whole city into a prison ter-
rorized by fiends from the lower planes.
The Styes
Issue #121; mid-level characters; by Richard Pett
Okay, so now we actually begin picking single, solitary adventures for this
Top Ten list. The Styes presents the player characters with an unforgettable
setting — a decrepit, diseased port city. Once a major ocean gateway, the
port city known as The Styes is now a perfect haven for sadists, cultists, and
hungry things that flop and writhe. In this atmospheric adventure, the heroes
must solve a string of gruesome murders in which the murderer himself is
the least of the city’s worries.
Mad God’s Key
Issue #114; low-level characters; by Jason Bulmahn
A hunt for a missing key leads the player characters from the streets of one of
the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game’s most beloved cities to a sinister cult hideout
in the nearby hills.
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Maure Castle
Issue #112; high-level characters; by Robert J. Kuntz and Gary Gygax
This award-winning adventure is a re-envisioning of a classic adventure from
the early days of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, Mordenkainen’s Fantastic Adventure. It’s
set in one of the classic dungeons that started it all over 30 years ago. This
adventure is expanded upon yearly in the pages of Dungeon Magazine, so you
can use it as a launching point for a major dungeon-delving campaign.
Tammeraut’s Fate
Issue #106; mid-level characters; by Greg A. Vaughan
The heroes come upon an abandoned hermitage on a remote island . . . but
when night falls, the dead shamble out of the sea. The player characters find
themselves in a desperate fight against the angry undead who lay siege to the
old hermitage.
The Lich-Queen’s Beloved
Issue #100; high-level characters; by Christopher Perkins
The githyanki are a classic race of D&D villains who raid the lands of
humankind from their great fortresses on the Astral Plane. In The Lich-
Queen’s Beloved, the player characters travel to the imperial capital of the
fearsome githyanki and confront the undying lich-queen of the race in a des-
perate attempt to stop her quest for godhood.
Tears for Twilight Hollow
Issue #90; mid-level characters; by Angel Leigh McCoy and Christopher
Perkins
The demise of a beloved paladin brings pain and despair to the village of
Twilight Hollow. As the player characters investigate the circumstances of
the paladin’s death, they might have the chance to solve a mystery, save a
legendary paladin’s soul, and end a dreadful evil.
325
Chapter 25: Ten Best Dungeon Magazine Adventures

Rana Mor
Issue #86; mid-level characters; by Richard Baker
Rich swears he had nothing to do with how the editors at Paizo settled on
this list! James, Erik, and Jeremy picked this one all by themselves. In any
event, Rana Mor sends the player characters on a terrifying journey into the
depths of a fearsome jungle in search of a great prize: the wondrous emerald
known as the Rain Tiger. But before the heroes can claim their prize, they’ll
have to survive the traps and perils of an ancient ruin.
The Harrowing
Issue #84; high-level characters; by Monte Cook
The first high-level 3rd Edition DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure published, The
Harrowing remains one of the best. In this fine adventure by Monte Cook, the
player characters travel to the Abyss itself to stop the machinations of a pow-
erful drow priestess, who has plans to usurp control of the Demonweb Pits
from her mother — Lolth, the Queen of Spiders.

The Sunless Citadel
by Bruce R. Cordell; published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
This 1st-level adventure kicked off the newest edition of the D&D game and
highlights many of the newest innovations in the game system. It’s a site-
based adventure that sends the PCs into a sunken fortress to discover the
secret of a magical tree and the twisted druid that guards it.
Shadows of the Last War
by Keith Baker; published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
This adventure for 2nd-level characters is designed as an introduction to the
world of EBERRON. It sends the PCs on a quest to the Mournland to recover the
secrets of a terrible arcane weapon. With a little work, this adventure can be
tailored for use in any D&D campaign.
Forge of Fury
by Richard Baker; published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.

An abandoned dwarven stronghold sets the stage for this adventure for 
3rd-level characters. This dungeon crawl designed in the classic style pits 
the PCs against a number of terrible opponents, including a grand finale 
with the black dragon Nightscale!
Whispers of the Vampire’s Blade
by David Noonan; published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
An adventure for 4th-level characters set in the EBERRON game world, it puts
the player characters on the trail of a king’s agent who has apparently 
turned traitor — and taken a powerful magic sword with him as he fled! The
continent-spanning chase is on in this adventure that can be reworked for
use in any D&D campaign.
Sons of Gruumsh
by Christopher Perkins; published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
This adventure, set in the FORGOTTEN REALMS game world, sends a group of 
4th-level characters to confront rampaging orcs intent on doing the vile will
of their god, Gruumsh. With a minimum amount of work, this adventure can
be tailored for use in any D&D campaign.
Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil
by Monte Cook; published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
This sequel to the classic adventure (see Chapter 24) takes the form of a mas-
sive super adventure designed to take characters from level 4 to 14. Ancient
evils stir in the village of Hommlet and the nearby temple, and a new genera-
tion of heroes must rise to take on the terrible challenge. With 196 pages plus
a book of maps, this is the largest adventure created for the new edition of
the D&D game and published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.

329
Chapter 26: Ten Best 3rd Edition Adventures

The Speaker in Dreams
by James Wyatt; published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
An adventure for 5th-level characters, this scenario is a city adventure where
the player characters work to overturn the evil forces besieging the town. It
uses a flowchart to help DMs plot a course through the intricate storyline,
depending on the actions of the player characters.
Red Hand of Doom
by Richard Baker and James Jacobs; published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
This adventure is designed to take characters from 6th to 12th level by the
time they’ve plowed through it. A super adventure that includes a miniatures-
friendly poster map, it puts the PCs right in the middle of a war. The PCs
must undertake vital missions to change the course of the war, all the while
trying to discover the secret behind the mysterious Red Hand and its leader.
City of the Spider Queen
by James Wyatt; published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
Another D&D super adventure, this one takes characters from 10th to 18th
level as they plunge into an epic adventure deep in the Underdark to take on
the forces of the drow (dark elves). Although this adventure is set in the
FORGOTTEN REALMS game world, you can tailor it for use in any D&D campaign.
Lord of the Iron Fortress
by Andy Collins; published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
Designed to challenge 15th-level characters, this adventure features planar
travel, powerful dragons, new monsters, and an iron fortress full of secrets
that might destroy the PCs before they unravel all of this adventure’s 
mysteries.

Chapter 27
Ten Challenging Traps
O
ne of the most fiendish implements in the DM’s toolbox is the trap.
Traps come in a bewildering variety of shapes, sizes, and functions,
ranging from the simple pit trap to something as magical and complicated as
a giant chessboard where the player characters are living pieces.
Back in the “old school” days of gaming, traps were more commonplace and
arbitrary than they are in adventures nowadays. The reason traps aren’t fea-
tured as much in adventures as they used to be is that most DMs have real-
ized that including too many traps slows play to a crawl. When the dungeon
itself arbitrarily stabs, slices, dices, or fries characters for just walking down
a hallway, the players respond by playing the game with excessive caution.
Who really wants to play a game where the PCs spend 10 minutes searching
the next 10 feet of hallway before they consent to advance, and start the
process all over for the next 10 feet of hallway?
The current thinking on traps is that they’re best as complicating factors to
creature encounters or physical challenges. A trap by itself isn’t much fun, 
but a trap that might go off while the PCs are fighting a monster or trying to
navigate some difficult path is a lot more interesting. At the very least, a trap
that doesn’t have a monster nearby when the characters encounter it might
summon, conjure, alert, or otherwise introduce a monster to the scene in very
short order. True standalone traps ought to be pretty rare in most adventures,
and pretty obvious to the players. Use standalone traps to discourage charac-
ters from exploring certain paths or chambers in a dungeon in the first place,
as opposed to arbitrarily whacking the characters for no discernible reason at
all. An obvious trap makes players think about ways to get around it, but a
surprise trap is just punishment. Don’t punish the characters unless the play-
ers disregard the warning signs.
With that in mind, we present ten fiendish tricks and traps to challenge the
player characters.
You can find dozens of trap ideas and a discussion of how traps are created
and triggered on page 67 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.

Scything Blade Trap
You step in the wrong spot, and a big sickle-shaped blade shoots out of a well-
hidden slit in the wall and slices right through the spot where you’re standing.
Scything Blade Trap: CR 1; mechanical; location trigger; manual reset; Atk +8
melee (1d8/×3); Search DC 21; Disable Device DC 20.
This is a mechanical trap, triggered by entering a certain location — usually
moving into a square where the character’s weight sets off the trap. The
scything blade strikes only one time, and then someone has to reset it manu-
ally. When it strikes, it makes a single melee attack at an attack bonus of +8
against the character who set it off, dealing 1d8 damage if it hits (or triple
damage if it scores a critical hit). A character can locate it before it strikes
with a successful Search check (DC 21), and disarm it with a DC 20 Disable
Device skill check. It’s considered a CR (or Challenge Rating) 1 encounter, so
this trap is appropriate for 1st-level characters.
The scything blade works well in a room where the player characters might
fight an intelligent monster (or monsters). The denizens of the room know
which squares are trapped, and so they don’t step there — but the PCs find
out the hard way that some places in the room harbor a deadly threat. The
monsters might try to maneuver the PCs into stepping into the wrong square,
or even just shove them into the spot with a bull rush maneuver.
For variations on this trap, try a bigger, more dangerous blade, add poison to
the blade, or have the blade reset one round after striking, so that a charac-
ter who remains in the square is attacked every second round.
Symbol
A terrible, glowing rune is inscribed into the stone above the archway. When
you approach too closely, it gives off a blinding flash of light and blasts you
with a sickening wave of lethargy and weakness, draining the strength from
your limbs.
Symbol of Weakness Trap: CR 7; magical; proximity trigger (characters
within 60 feet who view the symbol are subject to its effects); no reset; weak-
ness (3d6 Strength damage, Fort save DC 20 negates); Search DC 32; Disable
Device DC 32.
The symbol spells create dangerous magical traps. The caster can be extremely
specific in describing what sort of creature or what types of actions will set off
the trap, but most symbols affect any creature who views the symbol or passes
through a doorway or opening guarded by it. The symbol we describe in this
section is a symbol of weakness that affects any creature looking at it — so as
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

soon as any character comes close enough to view the symbol, he or she must
succeed on a Fortitude save or take 3d6 points of Strength damage.
A symbol like this one works best if the player characters are thrown into a
fight after some or all of them have been exposed to it — if the PCs can just
turn around and go home to repair the spell’s effects, all the trap does is
delay the adventure. To create a nasty combo encounter, add this symbol to a
room guarded by sightless monsters, who are immune to its effects because
they literally can’t look at it. Grimlocks, oozes, or destrachans are all good
examples of monsters without eyes.
Symbol spells include symbol of death, symbol of pain, symbol of persuasion,
symbol of sleep, and symbol of stunning.
Burning Hands Trap
The image of a grinning devil is carved into the wall. When you come too
close, a blast of flame shoots out of the image’s mouth!
Burning Hands Trap: CR 3; magic device; proximity trigger (alarm); auto-
matic reset; spell effect (burning hands, 5th-level wizard, 5d4 fire damage, DC
11 Reflex half); Search DC 26; Disable Device DC 26.
Almost any spell can be turned into the basis for a trap. This simple trap uses
the lowly burning hands spell. Any creature that moves within a certain dis-
tance of the trap’s location sets it off. Burning hands affects a 15-foot cone, so
this trap might catch two or three characters at the same time. It automati-
cally resets — you can decide how often it goes off, but we recommend once
every two or three rounds.
This trap works very well when paired up with monsters who are resistant or
immune to fire — for example, hell hounds, salamanders, or fire giants. For
an especially insidious trap, combine the burning hands trap with an iron
golem. Fire damage heals iron golems.
Other spells that work well in a trap like this include fireball, wall of fire, light-
ning bolt, ice storm, or cone of cold. Monsters resistant or immune to cold and
electricity are almost as common as monsters immune to fire. You can also use
spells that don’t cause damage but certainly complicate a fight, such as slow.
Portcullis Trap
When you advance into the room, a loud rattle and clanking begins behind
you. A heavy portcullis of iron bars slams down in the doorway, blocking
your retreat!
333
Chapter 27: Ten Challenging Traps

Portcullis Trap: CR 1; mechanical; location trigger; manual reset; Atk +10
melee (3d6, only to those under the portcullis); Search DC 20; Disable Device
DC 20. The portcullis now blocks the passageway.
This simple mechanical trap drops a heavy grate somewhere nearby when a
character steps on the wrong square. The falling portcullis is dangerous to
any character underneath it when it falls, and it makes a single attack. After
that, the portcullis remains in place as an obstacle. A typical iron portcullis
has hardness 10, 60 hit points, and requires a DC 25 Strength check to lift (or
DC 28 to break through).
A portcullis is an excellent example of a dividing trap — when it falls, some
characters might be on one side, and some on the other. Any monsters who
wander in to see who or what set off the portcullis now face only one or two
of the player characters, instead of the whole party. Depending on whether
the characters are strong enough to lift the portcullis, they might have to
split into two groups and find separate ways through the dungeon in order to
reunite.
The portcullis works well with monsters who have ranged attacks. Archers
standing behind a portcullis can shoot through it at the player characters,
who can’t get at them with melee attacks.
Teleport Trap
A mist-filled doorway waits before you. When you step through, you find
yourself teleported into the fiery depths of a volcano!
Teleport Trap: CR 9; magic device; touch trigger; automatic reset; spell effect
(teleport, no save); Search DC 30; Disable Device DC 30.
There is no end to the mayhem you can create with traps based on the tele-
port spell. This sort of trap normally uses a touch trigger — it doesn’t go off
until a character actually walks through the trapped doorway or touches the
trapped object. Spells using touch attacks rarely allow any kind of saving
throw, so the teleport trap doesn’t either. If a character touches it, he or she
goes wherever the creator of the trap wanted when the trap was built.
Most teleport traps are one-way: The character can’t just turn around and
hop back through the doorway. He or she will have to find a way back from
wherever the teleport trap sent him or her. More insidious teleport traps work
once or twice, and then turn off for a time — a few minutes, an hour or two,
even a day or a week. This can serve to divide the party for quite some time
because some characters might be stuck on one side of the trap while other
characters remain behind.
334
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Although you can certainly design instant-kill teleport traps (for example, a
teleport trap that sends the victim to a random spot a mile or two above the
ground, into the depths of the sea, or just to a small 10-foot cell thousands 
of feet deep in the earth to die a lonely death of asphyxiation), those aren’t
really much fun. It’s far more sporting to have a teleport trap send the player
characters someplace exciting, such as a desert island they have to escape
from, an icebound mountain peak where remorhazes wait to hunt them, an
ancient donjon haunted by the ghosts of previous adventurers who failed to
find a way out, or even just to another part of the dungeon they are currently
exploring.
Poison Gas Trap
When you set foot on the highest step of the dais, there’s a click. You hear a
faint whoosh of something igniting inside the stone altar, and then sickly
brown fumes begin to pour out of the nostrils of the dragon skulls atop the
altar.
Burnt Othur Fumes Trap: CR 7; mechanical; location trigger; repair reset;
gas; multiple targets (all targets in a 5-foot radius); onset delay (3 rounds);
poison (burnt othur fumes, DC 18 Fort save, 1 Con drain/3d6 Con); Search DC
21; Disable Device DC 21. The poison cloud persists 10 rounds.
This trap uses burnt othur fumes (see “Poison,” on page 297 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide). It goes off when a character steps in the wrong spot (the dais
surrounding a dragon-skull altar, in this example), creating a cloud of poison
gas that fills an area 10 feet across. Any characters within this area when the
trap goes off and any characters who move into the cloud of poison gas
remaining afterwards are subject to its effects. Three rounds after initial
exposure, the character must attempt a Fortitude save or lose 1 point of
Constitution. Any player who fails that save must attempt a second Fortitude
save 1 minute later or take 3d6 Constitution damage. To be reset, the hidden
glass spheres that contained the poison must be replaced.
A poison gas trap works well when combined with monsters immune to
poison — for example, constructs or undead. To create a tense time-pressured
encounter, have the poison cloud slowly expand over time. Each round, the
cloud grows to fill squares that it was adjacent to the previous round, making
more and more of the room unsafe. You can add a portcullis in order to trap
the player characters in the affected area. The struggle to get through the
portcullis ahead of the gas while skeletons and wights attack is a great
encounter.
To change up this trap, simply substitute a different poison with a different
effect.
335
Chapter 27: Ten Challenging Traps

Dart Trap
From dozens of hidden launchers shoots a storm of razor-sharp darts, hiss-
ing past you and ricocheting from the opposite wall.
Fusillade of Darts: CR 5; mechanical; location trigger; manual reset; Atk +18
ranged (1d4+1, dart); multiple targets (1d6 darts per target in a 10 × 10-foot
area); Search DC 19; Disable Device DC 25.
Okay, so this trap is here because of Raiders of the Lost Ark. But it’s a great con-
cept for a trap. When the player characters move into the wrong spot of the
dungeon, a whole barrage of darts fires down the hallway or across the room.
Every character in the affected area is attacked by 1d6 darts; each dart makes
an attack roll with an attack bonus of +18, and deals 1d4+1 damage if it hits.
The fusillade of darts doesn’t combine very well with many monsters, but if
you want to give the player characters fits, include a dart fusillade in a fight
against a monster with natural damage reduction of 5 points or more. A mon-
ster such as a gargoyle or stone golem can easily shrug off the darts. For that
matter, even a lowly skeleton has little to fear from piercing damage.
You can easily make this trap more deadly by poisoning the darts. As a CR 7
trap, coat each dart with greenblood oil (see page 297 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide). For each dart hit, the victim must attempt a DC 13 Fortitude
save or take 1 point of Constitution damage.
Glyph of Warding
When you touch the treasure chest, a brilliant green rune suddenly appears,
crackling with divine power. An instant later, it bursts into a cloud of sul-
furous smoke, out of which three huge ruby-red scorpions scuttle.
Glyph of Warding (summon monster III): CR 3; spell; proximity trigger
(characters entering area); no reset; spell effect (casts summon monster III,
5th-level cleric); Search DC 28; Disable Device DC 28. Summons 1d3 fiendish
monstrous scorpions (Medium size) that remain 5 rounds.
Like the symbol of weakness, the glyph of warding is a spell that creates a 
trap all by itself. A glyph can blast trespassers with various sorts of energy
damage, or it can cast a cleric spell on the character setting it off. We espe-
cially like the glyph of warding when coupled with a summon monster spell 
(as shown in the example trap), because it’s a trap that makes its own fight.
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

A glyph of warding (or its big brother, the greater glyph of warding) typically
goes off when a creature touches, opens, or passes through the warded
object or area. The caster can set very precise conditions — for example, an
orc warpriest might create a glyph that doesn’t detonate when orcs pass by,
but goes off if any other sort of creature approaches. A glyph of warding is
nearly invisible, so it does not serve as a visible deterrent in the same way
that a symbol spell does.
You can easily create any number of variations on this trap by changing the
spell the glyph of warding employs or using a simple blast glyph instead. Spells
such as bestow curse, blindness/deafness, or contagion work well. Because
glyphs can discriminate between different types of targets, you could easily
include them in a room or encounter with creatures or guardians that do not
meet their triggering conditions.
Water Trap
The door slams shut behind you, and then cold water begins to flood into the
room through spouts shaped like grinning gargoyles. Stones grate against
each other somewhere beneath the rising water, and something swims in 
to join you in the rapidly filling room.
Water-Filled Room Trap: CR 4; mechanical; touch trigger; automatic reset;
multiple targets (all characters in 20 × 10-foot room); never miss; onset delay
(room requires 10 rounds to fill); Search DC 17; Disable Device DC 23. Three
rounds after activation, a stone block near the floor slides open to allow 2
Medium-size sharks to enter.
This trap isn’t just a feature of a dungeon room — it is the room. It works best
as a 20-foot-long room, with an iron door at the entrance and what seems to
be a matching door on the opposite side. When a character attempts to open
the apparent exit, the iron door by the entrance slams shut and locks, and
water begins to fill the room at the rate of 1 foot per round. The room fills
entirely in 10 rounds, assuming the room is 10 feet high. After that, you’ll
need to refer to the rules on holding breath and drowning, found on page 
304 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
To escape, characters trapped inside must disable the trap or break open the
door that’s locked behind them (an iron door normally has hardness 10, 60
hit points, and a Break DC of 28). The door that set off the trap isn’t a way 
out — it’s a false door. Characters who were outside the room when the door
slammed shut can certainly try to force it open from the outside, too.
Just for fun, we suggest introducing a couple water monsters into the trap. A
concealed door might open when the room fills to a certain point, allowing a
creature such as a shark or kapaocinth (marine gargoyle) to swim in. Undead
or constructs work well, too, because they don’t need to breathe.
337
Chapter 27: Ten Challenging Traps

Pit Trap
The floor suddenly gives way beneath you, revealing the yawning mouth of
a deep stone pit. Rusted iron spikes wait at the bottom.
Spiked Pit Trap: CR 2; mechanical; location trigger; automatic reset; DC 20
Reflex save avoids; 20 feet deep (2d6, fall); multiple targets (first target in
each of two adjacent 5-foot squares); pit spikes (Atk +10 melee, 1d4 spikes
per target for 1d4+2 damage each); Search DC 18, Disable Device DC 15.
The pit trap is the quintessential DUNGEONS & DRAGONS trap. Step on the wrong
spot, and you find that the floor isn’t there anymore. Usually, a character
stepping onto a pit trap is allowed a Reflex save to leap back to the nearest
safe square before plummeting in.
Pits come in a variety of depths, ranging from a 10-footer (really only a nui-
sance to most characters) to true killers that are 50 or 100 feet deep. The
bottom might be hard, bare stone; water in which even a strong swimmer will
eventually tire and drown; rusted metal spikes, possibly covered in poison
(now that’s not fair); a dungeon-dwelling mold or slime; or even an ooze mon-
ster, such as a gelatinous cube or gray ooze. This particular pit is 20 feet deep,
which means 2d6 points of falling damage. (Usually, a fall deals 1d6 damage
per 10 feet the victim falls.) It also has spikes; when a character falls in, he or
she receives 1d4 attacks, each striking at an attack bonus of +10 and dealing
1d4+2 damage per hit.
Pit traps are best used in places where other things might be happening at
the same time — for example, a fight against intelligent monsters who know
where the pits are and avoid them. If you do place a pit out in a dungeon hall-
way, think about putting a monster in the bottom of the pit that the victim
now must fight after being injured. Monstrous spiders or centipedes are good
choices, as are undead (skeletons or zombies) and ooze monsters.

Ten Ready-to-Use Encounters
M
emorable encounters are the building-blocks of great adventures. In
this chapter, we present ten encounters you can drop into your own
adventure, use as the basis to build an entire adventure around, or throw at
the players when you need something in a hurry — like when the player char-
acters go right and all you’ve prepared is the left side of the dungeon!
The encounters presented in this chapter feature a map, monsters, some
details to set the scene, and a recommended Encounter Level (EL). As DM,
you get to decide when, how, and where to use these encounters. You can
easily customize them by changing the monster selection, omitting some of
the special terrain features or traps, or redrawing the maps to fit into your
dungeon.
Umber Hulk Ambush (EL 9)
Set Up: Place this encounter in a part of the dungeon the player characters
have to move through to get to their main objective. See Figure 28-1 for the
map of the umber hulks’ ambush site.
Figure 28-1:
The umber
hulks are
hidden in
the walls,
ready to
ambush
unwary PCs.

Read Aloud: This portion of the dungeon appears old and the walls seem to 
be made of dirt and crumbling rock. The path ahead appears to be clear and
unobstructed.
Scene: When the player characters start to move through this corridor, the
two umber hulks hiding in the walls notice them (thanks to the monsters’
tremorsense ability). The creatures burst out of the walls to each side of the
corridor, surprising the party. The two umber hulks get a surprise round to
act before you call for initiative checks.
Note that the umber hulks have dug a pit farther along the passage. Any PC
that moves over the pit falls 20 feet, taking 2d6 damage upon landing.
Umber Hulk Tactics: The umber hulks use the surprise round to get in
attacks on player characters. Remember to check for the effects of their con-
fusing gaze special ability. As they fight the party, they try to herd the charac-
ters toward the pit trap. If one of the umber hulks falls in battle, the other
tries to escape by burrowing into solid rock. An escaping umber hulk leaves
no tunnel behind it.
Walking the Plank (EL 3)
Set Up: Add this chamber to your dungeon in any place it fits. Make sure you
set it in a spot where the player characters enter from the direction indicated
as “Start” on the map shown in Figure 28-2.

Read Aloud: A jagged crevasse 10 feet wide runs through the middle of this
large hall. A rough-planed log serves as a crude bridge. Statues of grim-faced
warriors stand on low daises in each corner of the room, and four large pillars
support the hall’s ceiling, 20 feet overhead. On the far side of the chamber, piles
of rubble have been heaped up into simple walls. Several odd-looking wooden
crates sit against the wall on your side of the room.

Scene: This chamber is a goblin guardpost. When the player characters
approach the crevasse or the bridge spanning it, two goblin archers lurking
behind the rubble walls open fire. Meanwhile, a third goblin hiding in the
perch on the south wall tugs on cords leading to the wooden crates, releasing
bloodthirsty stirges into the room!
Features: Special features in this room include the following:
 Crevasse: The crevasse is 10 feet wide and 30 feet deep. A character can
leap across with a DC 10 Jump check. A character who falls in takes 3d6
damage. The walls can be scaled up or down with a DC 15 Climb check.
 Log Bridge: The bridge is narrow and uneven. A character crossing the
bridge must succeed on a DC 5 Balance check or fall into the crevasse.
Remember, a character who takes damage while balancing might fall; see
the Balance skill description on page 67 of the Player’s Handbook.
 Rubble Wall: The walls provide the goblins with improved cover against
ranged attacks. The goblins gain a +4 cover bonus to their Armor Class.
 Pillars: A character hiding behind a pillar gains cover against ranged
attacks.
 Statues: The statues show human warriors in ancient armor. A character
in the same square as a statue gains cover.

Attach: If the stirge hits with its touch attack, it latches on and automatically grapples its target. In
subsequent rounds it can drain blood. An attached stirge is AC 12, and its grapple check after
attaching is d20+1.
Blood Drain: The stirge deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage in any round when it begins its turn
already attached to a target. After it drains 4 points of Constitution, it lets go and flies off to digest
its meal.

 Stirge Cages: Each of the crates holds two stirges. The doors are held fast
by simple pins attached to long lanyards, which run across the crevasse
to the stirgekeeper’s post. By yanking on a lanyard, the stirgekeeper can
open a crate and release the stirges inside.
Goblin and Stirge Tactics: Two of the goblins use their shortbows to shoot at
the heroes. They concentrate on any character trying to cross the log bridge
or jump the crevasse; if a character gets across, one goblin shoots at him or
her while the other tries to keep shooting at PCs still on the other side. The
goblin in the stirgekeeper’s perch uses his first round to yank on the lanyard
of one stirge cage, and his second round to open the other. Then he picks up
his bow and begins shooting.
The stirges naturally attack the nearest warm-blooded creature they see. The
goblins have trained their pets to not attack them, of course. The goblins
avoid shooting at characters who have stirges attached unless there are no
other targets.
Corridor of Webs (EL 2)
Set Up: This encounter works best as part of a larger dungeon complex,
either a place controlled by drow or where drow serve as partners in some
greater scheme. Figure 28-3 shows a map of the corridor of webs.
Read Aloud: The pillar-lined corridor ahead appears dark and deserted. Thick
cobwebs hang from the ceiling and between many of the pillars. The floor fea-
tures an intricate pattern carved into the great stone tiles.

Chapter 28: Ten Ready-to-Use Encounters

Scene: A drow warrior and its companion beast, a small monstrous spider, lie
in wait for the intruding player characters. Aware of the characters’ presence,
the drow has been watching their progress and has set an ambush in this
pillar-lined corridor. He has had the small monstrous spider create webs, as
shown on the map in Figure 28-3. Also, he has cast his darkness spell in the
far end of the corridor, where he and the spider hide and wait.
Drow Warrior and Spider Tactics: The drow warrior hopes to slow or other-
wise hinder the player characters by luring them into the webs and attacking
under the cover of the darkness spell. The small monstrous spider has spun
three webs; it can throw its web five more times before it exhausts its web-
bing supply for the day.
Poisoned Weapons: All the drow warrior’s weapons are poisoned. Any PC who
is hit by the drow’s weapons must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall
unconscious.
Webs: See page 288 of the Monster Manual for details on webs.
Darkness: See page 216 of the Player’s Handbook for details on this spell.

Mummy Crypt (EL 7)
Set Up: Add this chamber to your dungeon in any spot where it fits. See
Figure 28-4 for a map of the mummies’ crypt. The room has no egress. The
door at the entrance of the chamber is made of iron plate and secured with a
good lock (Open Lock DC 30, break DC 28).
Read Aloud: This chamber is a resplendent tomb. A great stone sarcophagus
dominates the center of the room. Four braziers of brass in the corners hold
silent, eerie flames of emerald green, and a row of tall stone amphora, each 5
feet tall, lines the back wall. Midway along the side walls are decorative wooden
screens that cover dark alcoves.
Scene: The mortal remains of an evil high priest are interred within the great
sarcophagus, but the long-dead priest is not the threat here — his two faith-
ful guards are. Behind the screens along the east and west walls lurk two
mummies, standing guard over the remains of their one-time master. They
attack any creature that enters the room.
Features: Special features in this room include the following:
 Braziers: The eerie green flames are nothing more than colorful versions
of the continual flame spell. The braziers are about 3 feet tall, 3 feet wide,
and weigh almost 100 pounds apiece.
 Sarcophagus: The 6 squares surrounding the sarcophagus are filled with
the tall pedestals. Each square is considered difficult terrain (characters
pay 2 squares of movement to enter each square). The lid of the sar-
cophagus is carved in the image of the dead high priest, a haughty and
aristocratic visage dressed in regal robes.

since turned to vinegar), sacred oil (still good), grain (mostly mold
now), and the last contains gold (1,200 gp).
 Screens: The wooden screens contain subtly carved vision-slits, allowing
the mummies to watch over their master’s tomb from within the alcoves.
Each screen is quite light and can be pushed over or tossed aside with a
move action.
Mummy Tactics: The two mummies remain hidden within their alcoves until
a player character moves adjacent to the sarcophagus, an amphora, or either
mummy’s hiding place. At that point, they burst out of their alcoves. Roll 
initiative.
Mummies have the special ability to cause despair. As soon as they emerge
from their alcoves, all characters in the party who can see the undead crea-
tures must succeed on a Will save (DC 16) or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4
rounds. The mummies ignore paralyzed characters to attack nonparalyzed
characters. Only when no active characters oppose them do they turn on
paralyzed PCs. Paralyzed characters are helpless, so the mummies hit them
automatically.

Rain of Arrows, Rain of Fire (EL 6)
Set Up: This encounter presents a particularly nasty trap for any adventurers
that dare to push too far into a dungeon complex. Player characters must run
a gauntlet of fire and arrows to reach one of the two exits available to them.
This encounter area is shown on the map in Figure 28-5.

Damage Reduction 5: The mummy subtracts 5 from all damage dealt by melee and ranged weapons.
Despair: At the mere sight of a mummy, the viewer must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or be para-
lyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save succeeds, that viewer cannot be affected
again by the same mummy’s despair ability.
Mummy Rot: Any creature hit by the mummy’s slam attack must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save
or contract mummy rot after 1 minute, taking 1d6 Constitution and 1d6 Charisma damage. A char-
acter casting a Conjuration (healing) spell on a creature suffering from mummy rot must succeed
on a DC 20 caster level check, or else the healing spell fails. See “Disease” on page 292 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide.
Undead: The mummy is immune to critical hits, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, sleep spells
and effects, sneak attacks, and stunning. It is not subject to fatigue or exhaustion.
Vulnerability to Fire: The mummy takes half again as much damage from fire (+50%), regardless of
whether a save is allowed or the save is successful.

Read Aloud: Two bugbears stand in the corridor ahead of you, looking mean
and nervous at the same time. “Thought I smelled something bad,” one bugbear
says. “Yup, nothing worse than sweaty adventurers,” the other agrees.
Scene: This portion of the dungeon is an elaborate trap operated by a trio of
bugbear thugs. The two visible bugbears do their best to insult and draw the
player characters toward them to activate the first part of the trap. The third
bugbear hides in the secret corridor, ready to throw the lever that activates
the second part of the trap.
Bugbear Tactics: The two bugbears try to goad the player characters to rush
toward them. The first character to step onto the area marked “Pit” on the
map causes the floor to fall away. A DC 15 Reflex save allows the character 
to jump back to a safe part of the corridor. Otherwise, the character and the
floor crash to the bottom of the pit, 15 feet down, which causes 2d6 damage.
At the same time that the pit is activated, a great stone block drops out of 
the ceiling to seal off the passage behind the PCs. Any PCs standing in the
squares that the block drops into must make a DC 15 Reflex save to leap into
the corridor and avoid damage. Anyone who fails the save is moved forward
to the first open square and takes 2d6 points of damage from the heavy stone
block.
Now the bugbears on the other side of the pit pull out longbows and make
ranged attacks against any player characters they can see. At the same time,
the third bugbear moves to the lever and activates the second part of the trap.
When activated by the third bugbear, the side corridor becomes a fiery
deathtrap. Every round, roll 1d8. On a roll of 1, nothing happens. On a roll of
2–8, the wall section indicated on the map shown in Figure 28-5 spews forth a
gout of flame 5 feet wide and 20 feet long (the width of the corridor) that
deals 1d6 points of fire damage to anyone standing in that row.
Secret Door: To find the secret door in the fire trap corridor requires a DC 20
Search check.

When the player characters reach the area marked “Start,” read the following
to them:
Read Aloud: A dripping cave-passage leads into the darkness. The floor is quite
rough and uneven, and the walls simply slope inward about 15 feet above, meet-
ing in a jagged fissure. The air is filled with a foul, acrid reek; your eyes water,
and your throat burns. Ahead you can see that the passage opens into a large
chamber. Gold glitters there.
Scene: The cavern beyond the passage is the lair of a young green dragon
named Venomscale. The clever dragon uses its hoard as a lure for bold
adventurers, attacking when the curious (or greedy) venture into its den.
Features: Special features within this cavern include the following:
 Floor: The floor of the passage and most of the cavern (every square
marked with a triangle) is a natural stone floor. It takes 2 squares of
movement to enter each square, and it’s impossible to run or charge
over these squares. Because Venomscale can fly, the dragon isn’t both-
ered by these restrictions.
 Cavern Lake: This large, cold lake is 5 feet deep in any square next to the
edge, and 15 feet deep in all other squares. Creatures in the shallow
water gain cover (+4 bonus to AC). It requires 4 squares of movement to
move from 1 square of shallow water to another. (A character can jump
in the water just by moving into a water square.) Otherwise, a character
in the water has to swim.
 Ledge Roosts: These ledges are 10 feet above the cavern floor. It’s a DC 15
Climb check to scramble up to the ledge. (The dragon just flies, of
course.) A character with a melee weapon can’t reach Venomscale while
it’s up in a ledge roost.
 Escape Passage: A small, winding passage leads from the third ledge
roost to a hidden exit from the dungeon or cavern. Characters can’t see
the escape passage from the floor of the cave.
 Venomscale’s Hoard: The dragon’s hoard is displayed in clear sight in the
middle of the room. It includes 300 gp; 8,000 sp; two red garnets worth
100 gp each; a scroll of web; and a +1 longsword.
Green Dragon Tactics: Venomscale hears the player characters approaching
down the passage unless they’re attempting to move silently or using a silence
spell to not be heard. (Allow Venomscale a Listen check to see whether it can
hear a character who is using the Move Silently skill.) If the dragon doesn’t
hear the PCs, it’s idly playing with its hoard when they first appear.
Presuming the dragon hears the player characters, it moves to the spot
marked D on the map before the PCs see it and hides (Hide check d20+11, +4
for excellent cover). Allow the player characters to make a Spot check; each
350
Part V: The Part of Tens 

character who equals or exceeds Venomscale’s Hide check is not surprised
and can act in the surprise round. Characters who don’t see the dragon
before it attacks are surprised and can do nothing.
Venomscale charges the PCs on its first turn, attacking the first character it
sees with its bite attack. On the next round, it breathes acid on the party,
trying to catch as many characters as it can in the area. (Venomscale will not
breathe acid on its treasure hoard and makes sure that its cone of acid does
not cover the treasure.) In subsequent rounds, Venomscale may make a full
attack, using its bite, claws, and wings all in the same turn, or it may choose
to withdraw, flying up to a ledge roost in order to allow its acid breath to
recharge.
If the dragon feels that it’s in a very good position, it may offer the player
characters the chance to surrender. If the player characters leave their
armor, weapons, and treasure here, the dragon allows them to leave alive.
Otherwise, Venomscale is happy to kill them all.

Breath Weapon: The green dragon breathes a 30-foot cone of acid (4d6 damage, Reflex DC 16 half).
It can breathe acid once every 1d4 rounds.
Immunities: The green dragon is immune to acid, paralysis, and sleep spells and effects.
Blindsense: The dragon pinpoints invisible creatures within 60 feet (but invisible creatures still gain
total concealment against it).

Minotaur Maze (EL 7)
Set Up: You can use this encounter to guard a treasure or other object that
the player characters might want to acquire. Place it in the midst of winding
dungeon corridors to create a maze of passages in which the minotaurs can
track the PCs and employ their powerful charge attacks. Figure 28-7 shows a
map of the minotaurs’ maze.
Read Aloud: The winding maze of corridors takes you deeper into the dungeon
until you reach an area permeated by a powerful animal stench. In the shadows
up ahead, you see a tall, muscular form, with ambient light glinting off great
horns that curve atop the creature’s head. It roars in rage and challenge, raising
sparks from the stone floor as it stomps its hoofed feet.
Scene: A pair of minotaurs patrols this section of the dungeon, guarding the
locked room. The treasure or whatever object the player characters seek is
within the locked room, atop a raised platform in the center of the odd-
shaped chamber.
Minotaur Tactics: The two minotaurs work in tandem, setting up flanks and
charging opportunities for each other whenever possible. They concentrate
on a single target at a time, working to systematically defeat the player char-
acters one at a time. If a minotaur makes a full attack, it strikes with both its
greataxe and its gore attack in the same round.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Treasure Chamber: The doors that protect this chamber are made of iron. Iron
doors have a 10 hardness, 60 hp, and a break DC 28. Good locks seal these
doors (Open Lock DC 30). Inside, a ceiling pendulum trap protects the 5-foot
section in front of each pair of doors. When a character steps on any of the
squares inside the room and adjacent to the doors, a greataxe swings out of
the ceiling. The pendulum trap attacks anyone in a square adjacent to the
doors with a +15 melee attack (1d12+8/×3). To find the trap, a PC must suc-
ceed on a DC 15 Search check. To disarm the trap, a PC must succeed on a DC
27 Disable Device check. Each pendulum resets automatically and can attack
again one round later.
Grimlock Hunters (EL 3)
Set Up: This is an encounter you can run anytime in a dungeon or cavern.
Monsters sometimes roam through cavern complexes and dungeon halls
looking for trouble, so you can simply throw this fight at the player charac-
ters if the action starts to drag. For convenience, the map in Figure 28-8
shows a typical dungeon corridor.
Read Aloud: You turn a corner in the winding passageway and find two gray-
skinned, black-haired humanoids approaching from the other direction. The
creatures wear breechcloths of badly tanned leather and carry crude iron axes.
They are completely eyeless, but they seem to see you just fine — they snarl and
leap forward, axes raised!

Blindsight: Grimlocks sense all creatures within 40 feet as a sighted creature would. Beyond that,
they treat all targets as having total concealment.
Immunities: Grimlocks are immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms
that rely on sight.

Scene: Grimlocks are violent, ill-tempered marauders and savages who haunt
the foul depths of dungeons and caves. While they have no eyes, they “see”
quite well with their uncanny blindsight — a natural ability to perceive the
tiniest sounds, smells, and movements nearby. Their only plan is to hack the
heroes into pieces, and then loot the corpses.
Features: None of note. This is a straight-up fight.
Grimlock Tactics: The grimlocks rely on savagery, not planning. They try to
spread out and catch a player character between them, so that they can flank
their foe and gain the normal +2 attack bonus for attacking from a flank.
Elemental Fundamentals (EL 9)
Set Up: This encounter should separate two portions of a dungeon — where
the player characters are and where the player characters want to be. To get
there, they have to cross the gauntlet of elemental dangers shown on the
map in Figure 28-9.

355
Chapter 28: Ten Ready-to-Use Encounters

Read Aloud: You stand upon a stone platform just inside a pair of double doors.
Straight ahead, high walls frame a deep chasm that cuts through the center of
the chamber. To your right, the ground consists of hot coals, and the air above it
shimmers with heat and the occasional flare of fire. To your left, a pool of still
water blocks the way. On the other side of the chamber, past the gaping chasm,
you see that the ground consists of rocky, broken earth instead of smooth stone.
A pair of double doors beyond the broken earth seem to be the only exit from
this chamber — other than whatever may wait at the bottom of the chasm or
beneath the still water.
Scene: This chamber is divided among the primary elements of earth, air,
fire, and water. Each section is guarded by two elementals of the same type.
The player characters don’t have to defeat all the elementals to exit this
chamber, but they do have to find a way to reach the broken earth and deal
with the two earth elementals that wait there. The Encounter Level is based
on the assumption that the player characters will deal with two of the ele-
mental types (by going through the air, fire, or water elementals’ areas to get
to the earth elementals’ area), but not all four elemental types. If they do try
to enter each area, they must deal with more than the four types of CR 5 crea-
tures that this encounter is based upon, and the challenge becomes increas-
ingly harder.
Elemental Tactics: Each section of the chamber (other than the entry area) is
guarded by a pair of elementals. The matched pairs cooperate with each
other, and once encountered, the elementals follow the PCs throughout the
chamber — even into other elemental areas.
This encounter contains the following features:
 Chasm: The chasm is very deep, dropping 100 feet below the chamber. It
even extends upward, 100 feet toward the surface. Two air elementals
guard this area. If the player characters try to cross the chasm in any
way, the air elementals attack.
 Fire Pit: The fire pit area has a 20-foot-tall ceiling. Two fire elementals
guard this area. In addition, the fire pit deals 1d6 points of fire damage
per 5 feet of movement to any character moving through the area, or 1d6
points of fire damage per round for characters standing or fighting in the
area.
 Pool of Water: The pool of water is 50 feet deep. Two water elementals
guard this area. As soon as a character enters the water, whirlpools kick
up that attempt to pull characters under. (See Drowning rules on page
304 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.) The whirlpools require Swim DC 20
checks to move each 5 feet through the water. If a PC fails a check, the
PC is pulled under and begins to drown.
 Broken Earth: The area of broken earth is guarded by two earth elemen-
tals. Treat this area as difficult terrain; it costs double to move through
this area. The doors at the end of the chamber are made of stone (8
hardness, 60 hp, break DC 28) and are locked (Open Lock DC 30).

Shrine of Evil (EL 10)
Set Up: Add this chamber as a challenging encounter area in a high-level dun-
geon, or use it as the climactic encounter of a mid-level dungeon. The shrine
has only one entrance, so you can place it anywhere it fits. See Figure 28-10
for a map of the shrine of evil.
Read Aloud: This grim chamber seems to be a shrine dedicated to a fearsome
and evil deity. Above the altar stands a 10-foot-tall idol, depicting a six-armed
dark lord in battle armor, three hands raised in a gesture of imperious command.
Before the altar is a great round pit — an ossuary, full of the broken bones of hun-
dreds of creatures. Several skulls hang suspended from chains in the ceiling, burn-
ing with weird blue flame like macabre censers. You sense a cold and hateful
presence in the room, and a dry, rasping voice whispers, “Have you come to honor
Hextor with your blood, foolish mortals?” It seems to come from the empty air.
Scene: This shrine is dedicated to Hextor, the god of war and tyranny. The
shrine is also the domain of a bone devil, a powerful creature of the lower
planes. The devil can turn itself invisible, and so it begins the encounter in
this state. The creature amuses itself by whispering terrible threats against
the player characters and extols the might of Hextor until it gets tired of play-
ing with its prey. Then it attacks.

cask, which holds 5 perfect rubies worth 1,200 gp each.

Damage Reduction 10/good: The bone devil reduces the damage dealt by melee and ranged attacks
by 10 unless the weapon is good-aligned.
Immunities: The bone devil is immune to fire and poison.
Resistances: The bone devil has acid resistance 10 and cold resistance 10.
Spell Resistance: The bone devil has SR 21.
Fear Aura: The bone devil radiates fear in a 5-foot aura. All PCs in this area must succeed on a DC
17 Will save or be affected as though by a fear spell. A PC that saves successfully cannot be
affected again by the same bone devil’s fear aura for 24 hours.
Poison: The bone devil’s sting delivers poison. If the devil hits with its sting, its enemy must succeed
on a Fortitude save (DC 20) or suffer 1d6 points of Strength damage. One minute later, the stung PC
must save again or suffer 2d6 more Strength damage.
Spell-Like Abilities: At will — greater teleport (self only), dimensional anchor, fly, invisibility (self
only), major image (DC 15), wall of ice. Caster level 12th.

 Hanging Skulls: Each of these flaming skulls is a magical trap. Any char-
acter who moves into a square adjacent to a hanging skull is attacked by
a ray of blazing blue fire, which is an empowered scorching ray spell. The
ray makes a touch attack (attack roll d20+10) and deals 6d6 fire damage
if it hits. The bone devil is immune to fire, but it avoids moving next to 
a skull until after a PC sets off the trap. It doesn’t want to give away the
surprise. After firing a ray, a hanging skull must recharge on the follow-
ing round, but it can shoot again on the round after that if somebody
else moves adjacent to it.
 Ossuary: The bone pit makes for very bad footing. Any PC trying to walk
on the bones must pay 4 squares of movement for each square of the
ossuary he or she enters, and he or she must succeed on a DC 15
Balance check or fall prone in the square.
Bone Devil Tactics: The bone devil is armed with a formidable array of spe-
cial powers and abilities. We recommend that you take a moment to review
its stat block before you begin this encounter.
The bone devil begins the encounter invisible, so unless the player charac-
ters have some way to see invisible creatures, it surprises the party when it
finally attacks. It begins by striking from invisibility against any cleric or pal-
adin in the party because it hates the servants of good deities. An invisible
creature gains a +2 bonus on its attack rolls against a creature that can’t see
it, and ignores its target’s Dexterity bonus to AC. Attacking ends the bone
devil’s invisibility, just like normal.
In its next round, the bone devil uses its spell-like abilities to create a wall of
ice that divides the party in half — hopefully, leaving it with only one or two
characters to deal with on its side of the wall. After beating on any clerics or
paladins for a round or two, it begins to spread its attacks around and tries to
sting as many characters as possible, hoping its poison will weaken or crip-
ple multiple opponents. The bone devil can teleport to get around its own ice
walls and may create more walls of ice to keep the party separated.

Ten Things to Avoid When DMing
K
eeping track of all the things you’re supposed to be doing (or not doing)
when you’re behind the DM screen can be hard. You’re supposed to be
the unquestioned master of a 1,000-page game system . . . and a riveting sto-
ryteller, a talented worldbuilder, and a passable amateur thespian, to boot.
You’re going to make a goof at some point, so in this chapter, we list some of
the DMing don’ts you should try hardest to follow. These list items are Big
Picture problems that many DMs struggle with, not details of how the rules
work or what’s actually in the game.
Don’t Get Attached to Your Villains
When you spend hours crafting interesting, powerful, and charismatic villains
for your game, you can easily get attached to your favorite bad guys. It’s
especially easy when you’ve worked all week to come up with a great story-
line featuring that villain as the principal nemesis of the heroes for your next
game. You might be tempted to go to some effort to prevent the player char-
acters from beating your mastermind before they’re “supposed to.”
Here’s our advice: Don’t ever cut your villains a break. The stars of the story
are the player characters, and if the players outwit you or just blunder into
victory through sheer dumb luck, you need to let them win.
Don’t Try to Kill the PCs
Back in the dark old days of gaming, many Dungeon Masters cultivated a 
reputation as “killer DMs.” They’d gloat over how tough their dungeons were,
what sort of mortality rate they achieved, and exactly how they humbled
even the most cocksure and disrespectful players by mincing, mashing, or
flat-out disintegrating their characters.
Here’s the deal: Killing a character is nothing to be proud of, because anyone
can do it. You can do in the heroes any time you like by dropping death traps
or monsters far above their power level into the adventure. Try throwing a

symbol of death or a nightwalker at a party of 1st-level characters if you don’t
believe us. On second thought, don’t do that; just trust us that it’ll mean
game over.
You don’t win anything when one of your monsters or traps kills a player
character. There might be times in your game (possibly even most of the
time) when you’re indifferent to character deaths and let the dice fall where
they may — but don’t ever go gunning for the player characters. Clever,
vicious, or evil monsters may certainly do so within the constraints of a fair
and balanced encounter, but you shouldn’t.
Don’t Let the Players Become 
Too Frustrated
The ultimate measure of a successful D&D game is simply: “Did everybody
have fun?” If the players get stuck on a particular obstacle, opponent, or dead
end and become frustrated, you should intervene.
If you’re crafty enough, the players might not even realize that you’re helping
them because the exact form of your intervention doesn’t even seem to be
helpful. For example, imagine that the party is stuck in a dungeon room, con-
fronting a door that they can’t open until they solve a puzzle. The players
can’t figure it out, and they’re getting bored and frustrated — so you inter-
vene by suddenly throwing a couple of wandering monsters into the room.
You might have had no intention of giving the players a fight at this point in
the adventure, but now you’ve changed the challenge. And, if the player char-
acters discover a clue when they defeat the monsters you threw their way,
the players might not even suspect you’re tossing them a softball to help
them beat the puzzle.
Don’t Compete With Other Entertainment
Wherever and whenever you set up the game session, avoid playing while the
players are distracted by something else. For example, don’t try to run your
game while a couple players are over on the couch playing a video game, or
at the computer instant-messaging other friends, or keeping an eye on the
football game. D&D works best when you have the full use of the players’
imaginations, and you need their undivided attention for that.
If you find yourself trying to run the game with a truly unavoidable distrac-
tion (maybe the Big Game is on the TV in the other room, and several players
are really trying to keep half an eye on it), consider calling a break. Wait until
the players are ready to pay attention to the game before resuming.
364
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Don’t Overcomplicate the Encounter
What’s better than a memorable villain or monster? Two memorable villains
or monsters! Three! Four! With arrow traps, and a lighting storm, and an icy
cliff the player characters are trying to climb!
Well, not really. The best encounters need only about two to three discrete
elements. Anything beyond that becomes hard to keep track of for everyone.
Don’t Play Favorites
You’re only human, so it’s inevitable that you like some of the characters the
players bring to the game more than others. For that matter, you might just
like some players better than others (especially if your significant other is in
your game group). Be careful not to show preferential treatment at the table.
Don’t Give the Players Everything . . .
Players like it when their characters get rewarded. You might be tempted to
make sure the players like your game by giving their characters frequent and
powerful rewards — quick level-ups, powerful NPC allies, or great hauls of
magic items.
In our experience, players enjoy the rewards their characters gain much
more if they have a sense that their characters really earned them. To keep
the players interested in your game, make sure that they stay a little hungry.
If they aren’t anxious to get to the next reward because you’ve already given
it away, they have little motivation to play.
. . . But Don’t Be Stingy, Either
Conversely, the players deserve and expect regular rewards from your game.
Without a sense that their characters are indeed making progress and 
becoming more capable and powerful, the players might begin to wonder
why they’re showing up. If a fighter in your game reaches 6th level and is 
still toting around the scale mail and longsword he started with at 1st level,
you’re keeping that player from enjoying some of the fun the game promises.
365
Chapter 29: Ten Things to Avoid When DMing

Reward success appropriately, and the players can’t help but come back to
your game with just the right balance of hunger for the next big thing and real
satisfaction at the progress they’ve already made. To make sure you’re handing
out treasure at the right rate, refer to Table 5-1 in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
Don’t Sit There Like a Lump
You can easily fall into the habit of parking behind your DM screen, reading
the adventure’s boxed text, and announcing attack results without any partic-
ular inflection. Some people are naturally low-key, and even a high-energy DM
can show up for a game tired or distracted. We don’t expect you to deliver
riveting lines every time you speak, but you need to make yourself the center
of attention to be an effective and engaging DM. That often means standing
up, moving around, and speaking with some animation and excitement.
Deliver your own color commentary when you’re narrating a combat. If the
ogre swings and misses, pantomime a gigantic swing and say something like,
“Wow, Jozan, that would’ve taken your head clean off your shoulders if it had
landed! Good thing you ducked!”
Don’t Center the Game on One Player
Don’t let one player do all the talking. If your gaming group includes a loud,
expressive, or flamboyant roleplayer who wants to engage every NPC he
meets in deeply immersive conversations, keep an eye on how the other play-
ers react. When you go one-on-one with a single player at the table, no one
else is playing D&D — they’re watching their fellow player play. You might
also run into this with a player who’s more of a power gamer than a role-
player; perhaps she insists on doing all of the thinking, planning, and leading
in the party. Go out of your way to keep less assertive or confident players
just as involved as the extrovert.
One of the classic ways a selfish player seizes the spotlight is to insist that his
character is going to go off and do his own thing, regardless of what the rest of
the party decides. Typically, that forces less assertive players to cave in to his
plan or puts you in the awkward spot of trying to DM two separate parties at
the same time. The next time the overly assertive player does this, let him go
off and separate from the group. Then, instead of using cut-aways to give him
equal time with the rest of the group, ignore him as much as possible. Give
him a couple minutes of playing time every 20 or 30 minutes, sticking with the
rest of the group and following their adventure for the rest of the time. When
Mr. Assertive figures out that he’s playing less D&D, he ought to come around.

Chapter 30
Ten Things to Do All the 
Time When DMing
K
eep these ten suggestions in mind whenever you run a D&D game.
They’ll help you keep your eye on the big picture and make you a better
Dungeon Master. You won’t have a chance to use all these suggestions simul-
taneously, but watch for opportunities to put them into play in your game
sessions.
Be Prepared
Review the rules. Know your adventure. Be prepared.
It all boils down to doing a little before-game reading and being organized.
Gather your adventure materials and notes before the game. Collect the
miniatures you want to use ahead of time. Mark the sections of any rulebooks
or Monster Manuals you plan to use in the game session. The players expect
you to be ready to run the adventure when the group meets up, and if you’re
prepared, everything will run that much more smoothly.
Provide Various Challenges
Don’t just present combat encounter after combat encounter in your adven-
tures. Player characters and roleplaying games can’t survive on combat
alone. You need to present encounters to challenge all character types, test-
ing the skills and brains and roleplaying abilities of the players and their
characters, at least every so often. This gives every character a chance to
shine at some point in the adventure, and variety helps make your adven-
tures more dynamic and satisfying.

Start Each Session with Action
As often as possible, kick off each game session with some kind of action.
Whether you drop the player characters into the middle of a fight, start off
with a chase, provide the means for a breathtaking escape, or let them wit-
ness some awe-inspiring or terrible event, starting with action leads to excite-
ment, and excitement leads to a good game session.
Look for Opportunities
Because you never know what the player characters are going to do, you
have to keep an open mind and look for opportunities to translate their
actions back into your plot. For example, the players might decide that some-
thing you never thought of is really behind the whole adventure. If it sounds
good to you, work it in! Look for places to drop hints and seeds that lead to
future adventures. And always try to make it look like you planned it all
along, even if you just thought of it thanks to something the player charac-
ters did.
Exude Drama in Your Descriptions
Be entertaining. When you set the scene and describe the action, use evoca-
tive language, stand up, sit down, point, lean, talk slowly, talk fast, talk loud,
whisper, explain what characters see, hear, feel, and smell. In other words, do
whatever is dramatically appropriate to get the scene across to the players in
a colorful, fun, and informative manner.
Use Visual Aids
Maps, play surfaces, miniatures, music, and handouts of all descriptions help
add context and texture to the imaginations of you and the players. A picture
is worth a thousand words and helps you quickly get across the information
you’re trying to impart. So, use visual (and audial) aids. They’re good for the
game. And they’re fun, too.
368
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Be Responsive
Take cues from the players. If your description is running on and the players
are beginning to get bored or fidgety, cut it short and move on. If they seem
to need more information, provide it. If they really want to get to the action
now, have a wandering monster show up or have the villains kick in the door.
So, be responsive to the needs of the players, and you will be rewarded with
attentive and excited play.
Be Consistent
When you create house rules, write them down. When you make a ruling on
something in a rulebook that you and the players don’t think is clear, make a
note of it. When you describe a nonplayer character (NPC) that the player
characters (PCs) meet, note any pertinent details so that you can play that
NPC the same way the next time they encounter him or her.
In short, be consistent as a rules referee and as a narrator. It makes for a
better game, builds trust, and helps encourage the fun.
369
Chapter 30: Ten Things to Do All the Time When DMing

Be Impartial
Impartially interpret the rules, whether you’re ruling on something for the
player characters or the monsters. The players won’t trust you if you play
fast and loose with the rules, or if you play favorites, or if you cheat to help
out your favorite monster or NPC. And if they don’t trust you, your game
group will collapse. Where’s the fun in that?
Have Fun
Relax! D&D is a game. There are no tests or pop quizzes. There aren’t any
right or wrong ways to play the game, because you can alter things to your
own style and taste. In the end, D&D provides a fun activity that’s part story-
telling and part wargame. Have fun with it, and the players will have fun, too!
