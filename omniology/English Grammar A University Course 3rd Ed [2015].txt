ENGLISH GRAMMAR	
This best-selling comprehensive descriptive grammar forms a complete course, ideal 
for all students studying English Language, whether on a course or for self-study. 
Broadly based on Hallidayan systemic-functional grammar but also drawing on cogni­
tive linguistics and discourse analysis, English Grammar is accessible, avoiding overly 
theoretical or technical explanations.
The book consists of twelve self-contained chapters built around language functions, 
and each chapter is divided into units of class-length material. Key features include:
••
Numerous authentic texts from a wide range of sources, both spoken and written, 
which exemplify the grammatical description;
••
Clear chapter and unit summaries which enable efficient class preparation and 
student revision; 
••
Extensive exercises with a comprehensive answer key.
This new edition has been thoroughly updated with new texts, a more user-friendly 
layout, more American English examples and a companion website, providing extra 
tasks, a glossary and a teachers’ guide.
This is the essential coursebook and reference work for all native and non-native 
students of English grammar on English language and linguistics courses.
Angela Downing is Professor Emeritus at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 
Spain. She was General Editor of Atlantis (Journal of the Spanish Association of English 
and American Studies) from 2006 to 2012 and has published numerous articles on gram­
mar and discourse.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION	
In consonance with the welcome suggestions made by Routledge and reviewers alike, 
this book has been revised again for its third edition with certain aims in mind. The 
first, in this age of cuts, was to slim down the content as regards the length of the text, 
without losing the character and coherence of the whole. This I have proceeded to do, 
reducing the length of each chapter as well as that of other sections.
Offsetting this pruning, there was the need to cover or amplify certain areas of the 
grammar that had been underdeveloped in previous editions, despite their importance. 
Such is the case with conditional sentences. They are complex enough for non-native 
students to be wary of using them, yet at the same time common enough in interper­
sonal interaction, both spoken and written, to warrant careful attention and practice. 
They also have interesting variants which students may be unaware of. The gap is now 
filled in Chapter 7.
A further aim has been to increase the projection of the grammar to an American 
readership. Differences of grammar between Standard American and Standard British 
English, which already appear in the second edition, are now more numerous and 
explicit; wherever possible, they are accompanied by authentic illustrations. It is well-
known that the major differences between these two standard forms of English lie 
in the lexis rather than in the grammar, and that features of American grammar are 
soon taken up and adopted, especially by young British speakers. New illustrations, 
both one-liners and short texts, have been selected so as to provide, at the same time, 
American lexical items that differ from their British English counterparts. Comparisons 
of American with British English as regards grammar in use are made where the gram­
matical point in question is being discussed, and are signalled as AmE vs BrE. A further 
detail is that the term Module is now replaced by Unit, as being more transparent to 
American readers.
I feel confident that Philip Locke, were he still alive, would welcome these further 
changes, together with those already carried out in the second edition of 2006. Without 
his invaluable collaboration in the writing of the first edition, published in 1992, it is 
likely that the whole conception of English Grammar, A University Course might have 
been different. I am particularly indebted to him for his enormous enthusiasm com­
bined with unflappability, which made our joint collaboration so enjoyable.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS	
My debt to my predecessors is, as before, very great. In addition to the grammars 
of Michael Halliday, Randolph Quirk, Sydney Greenbaum, Geoffrey Leech and Jan 
Svartvik, the wealth of information, corpus examples and frequencies provided by 
the Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English, by Douglas Biber and his col­
leagues Stig Johansson, Geoffrey Leech, Susan Conrad and Edward Finegan, have 
been a reliable resource of great value. Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum’s A 
Student’s Introduction to English Grammar, based on their previous Cambridge Grammar 
of Contemporary English, though not specifically a functional grammar, is both informa­
tive and a pleasure to read. Aimed at students who will shortly be seeking employment, 
these texts argue for the advantages of having a knowledge of grammar, an ability 
to express thoughts clearly and the capacity to analyse a sentence or paragraph for 
the meanings they will or will not support, all of which I wholly endorse. I also thank 
C.W.K. Gleerup, Lund, for A Corpus of English Conversation edited by Jan Svartvik and 
Randolph Quirk. Specialised grammars such as those of Geoff Thompson, Thomas and 
Meriel Bloor, Lachlan Mackenzie and Elena Martínez Caro among others have their 
place on my bookshelves. Specialised monographs and articles have had to be kept to 
a minimum in the Select Bibliography. 
I am grateful for access to BYU-BNC (based on the British National Corpus from 
Oxford University Press) (Davies (2004–) and for the use of the Corpus of Contemporary 
American English (COCA) (Davies (2008–). 
I am indebted to the many friends, colleagues and consultants who have made 
helpful comments on the previous editions. Among the consultants I was pleased to 
receive the reports and suggestions made by Joyce Stavick, of the University of North 
Georgia, by Pentii Haddington, of the University of Oulu, Finland and by the anony­
mous reviewer who provided perceptive comments and questions. I have implemented 
as many of their suggestions as has been possible in the time allowed. Also much 
appreciated were the many useful comments made by Mike Hannay (Free University, 
Amsterdam), Andrei Stoevsky (University of Sofia), Chris Butler (University of Wales, 
Swansea), Hilde Hasselgård (University of Oslo) and Bruce Taylor (University of 
Boston). I owe thanks to Geoff Thompson (University of Liverpool) for allowing me 
to use the best real-life spontaneous utterance of multiple left-detachment, and more 
recently, some of his striking examples of adjective-headed generic nouns. Thanks also 
to Thomas Givón and White Cloud Publishing for allowing me to insert an extract from 
his novel Downfall of a Jesuit. I remember with affection Emilio Lorenzo of the Real 
Academia Española, and his words of encouragement when the first edition was at an 
embryonic stage. I would especially like to express my thanks to Chris Butler and to 
Jorge Arús (Universidad Complutense) for their unfailing willingness to come to my

rescue in technological matters; to Paloma Tejada, also of the Complutense for read­
ing through the whole second edition and providing me with abundant comments; to 
Laura Alba (UNED) for first-hand confirmation of unusual items of American English, 
Carmen Santamaría (Universidad de Alcalá) for drawing my attention to certain details 
and Laura Hidalgo (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) for reading through many sec­
tions of the new edition in preparation; my boundless gratitude go to both Enrique and 
Eduardo Hidalgo for their help with the diagrams. 
My thanks go also to Louisa Semlyen for offering me the opportunity of a third edi­
tion, and to Sophie Jaques and Rosemary Baron of Routledge for their patience and 
help. Thanks also to copy editor Jane Olorenshaw and to Tamsin Ballard, Julie Willis 
and the production team at Swales and Willis Ltd. on behalf of Taylor and Francis for 
efficient work prior to and during production. Finally, I thank my long-suffering family 
for their constant support and encouragement.

INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD EDITION	
AIMS OF THE COURSE
This book has been written primarily for undergraduate and graduate students of 
English as a foreign or second language. It is also addressed to teachers and lecturers, 
whether native or non-native speakers of English, and to others interested in applying 
a broadly functional approach to language teaching in higher education. It assumes an 
intermediate standard of knowledge and practical handling of the language and, from 
this point of departure, seeks to fulfil the following aims:
1	
to further students’ knowledge of English through exploration and analysis;
2 	 to help students acquire an integrated vision of English, rather than concentrate on 
unrelated areas;
3 	 to see a grammar as providing a means of understanding the relation of form to 
meaning, and meaning to use, in context;
4	
to provide a basic terminology which, within this framework, will enable students 
to make these relationships explicit;
5	
to stimulate the learners’ capacity to interact with others in English and to express 
themselves appropriately in everyday registers, both spoken and written.
While not pretending to be exhaustive, its wide coverage and functional approach 
have been found appropriate not only in first degree courses but also in postgradu­
ate programmes and as a background resource for courses, publications and work on 
translation, stylistics, reading projects and discourse studies.
A FUNCTIONAL APPROACH TO GRAMMAR
A functional grammar is functional in various ways. In the first place, it does not consist 
of a set of rules governing all forms of grammatical structures and their relation to one 
another, with a concern that they are ‘well-formed’. Rather, a functional approach is 
geared towards meaning and aims to show how meanings are expressed in different 
forms according to speakers’ and writers’ communicative goals. This view is based, 
following Michael Halliday, on the assumption that all languages fulfil two higher-level 
functions (metafunctions) in our lives. One is to express our interpretation of the world 
as we experience it (sometimes called the ‘ideational’ or the ‘representational’ func­
tion); the other is to interact with others in order to bring about changes in the environ­
ment (the ‘interpersonal’ function). How we put together or ‘organise’ what we say or 

I N T R O D U C T I O N  T O  T H E  T H I R D  E D I T I O N  
x v
write in such a way that the ‘message’ is coherent and relevant to the situation repre­
sents a third (the ‘textual’ meta-function), and this, too, is given its place in a functional 
grammar.
Second, the regular patterns of different kinds that can be distinguished in language 
reflect the uses which a language serves. For instance, the clause types known as 
‘declarative’, ‘interrogative’ and ‘imperative’ serve the purposes of expressing a mul­
titude of types of social behaviour, such as making statements, asking questions and 
giving orders. In this area the pragmatic concepts of speech acts, politeness, relevance 
and inference are brought in to explain how speakers use and interpret linguistic forms 
and sequences in English within cultural settings.
In describing the more detailed mechanisms of English, the notion of ‘function’ is 
used to describe syntactic categories such as Subjects and Objects, semantic roles 
such as Agent and informational categories such as Theme and Rheme, Given and 
New. We shall see, for instance that in English the Agent, that is, the semantic role 
indicating the one who instigates or carries out an action, typically conflates with the 
Subject: ‘Tom’ in Tom spent all the money; furthermore, the grammatical Subject in a 
clause tends to occur initially in English, thus occupying the same position as Theme 
as well as Agent. Subject, Agent, Theme is not a rigid choice, however: the elements 
can be moved around, as shown in 1.3.2. A functional approach also will point out the 
formal differences, but the principal aim will be to explain how different variations of 
form affect meanings, and how speakers and writers use meanings and forms to inter­
act in social settings. 
Third, this type of grammar is functional in that each linguistic element is seen not 
in isolation but in relation to others, since it has potential to realise different functions. 
Structural patterns are seen as functional patterns of constituents, whether of participants 
and processes, of modifiers and head of, for instance, a noun, or of Subject, verb and 
Complements, among others. These in turn are realised in a variety of ways according 
to the communicative effect desired. Speakers and writers are free, within the resources 
a particular language displays, to choose those patterns which best carry out their com­
municative purposes at every stage of their interaction with other speakers and readers.
With these considerations in mind, the present book has been designed to place 
meaning firmly within the grammar and, by stressing the meaningful functions of 
grammatical forms and structures, to offer a description of the grammatical phenom­
ena of English in use, both in speech and writing. This book, we hope, may serve as a 
foundation for further study in specific areas or as a resource for the designing of other 
materials for specific purposes.
PRESENTATION OF CONTENT
The grammatical content of the course is presented in three blocks:
••
a first chapter giving a bird’s-eye view of the whole course and defining the basic 
concepts and terms used in it;
••
seven chapters describing clausal and sentence patterns, together with their cor­
responding elements of structure, from syntactic, semantic, textual and communi­
cative-pragmatic points of view; and

x v i  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
••
five chapters dealing similarly with nominal, verbal, adjectival, adverbial and prep­
ositional groups and phrases. 
In each case the aim is that of describing each pattern or structural element in use, 
rather than that of entering in depth into any particular theory. Chapter titles attempt 
to reflect, as far as possible, the communicative viewpoints from which the description 
is made.
The twelve chapters are divided into ‘units’ (fifty-nine in all), each one being con­
ceived as a teaching and learning unit with appropriate exercises and activities grouped 
at the end of each chapter.
Each unit begins with a summary, which presents the main matters of interest. It is 
designed to assist both teacher and students in class preparation and to offer a review 
for study purposes.
Exemplification
Many of the one-line examples which illustrate each grammatical point have been 
drawn or derived from actual observation. Some of these have been shortened or sim­
plified in order to illustrate a grammatical point with maximum clarity. A further selec­
tion of examples is taken from the BYU-BNC corpus, based on the British National 
Corpus, and other acknowledged sources, both American and British, including short 
excerpts of connected speech. These have not been modified. They are intended to 
illustrate the natural use of the features being described.

Each of the units which make up the course is accompanied by a varying number of 
practice exercises and activities. Some involve the observation and identification of 
syntactic elements and their semantic functions, or of the relations between them; oth­
ers call for the manipulation or completion of sentences in various meaningful ways. 
The different areas of grammar lend themselves to a wide variety of practical lin­
guistic activities limited only by the time factor. Those proposed here can be selected, 
adapted, amplified or omitted, according to need.
An answer key is provided at the end of the book for those analytical exercises 
which have a single solution, which are now the vast majority. Activities that have no 
solution of this kind, such as discussions, have been mostly avoided in this edition. 
Where a suggestion seems useful, it has been provided. 
It is the opinion of the author that university study should not attend solely to the 
attainment of certain practical end-results. Its value lies to a great extent in the thinking 
that goes on in the process of ensuring the results, not only in the results themselves. It 
is rather in the performance of a task that the learning takes place. The premature refer­
ence to a key negates the whole purpose of the tasks and should be resisted at all costs. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR USING THE BOOK
The chapters which comprise this book can be used selectively, either singly or in 
blocks. In starting with the clause, the aim has been to provide a global frame, both 

I N T R O D U C T I O N  T O  T H E  T H I R D  E D I T I O N  
x v i i
syntactic and semantic, into which the lower-ranking units of nominal, verbal and other 
groups naturally fit, as can be seen in Chapter 2. Moreover, experience shows that to 
reach a suitably advanced level and coverage for future use of English professionally, 
a knowledge of the clause and the ability to handle such areas as clause combining, 
tense, aspect and modality are essential, and have perhaps not been acquired earlier, 
whereas nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs will have been taught at least on a basic 
level. 
It is perfectly possible, however, to reverse the order of chapters, starting for instance 
with the verbal or nominal groups and using the subsequent chapters as a course on 
grammar ‘below the clause’, if this is found more convenient. The function of each of 
these groups within the clause is described briefly with examples. Morphological infor­
mation is provided in each of these chapters.
The overview which comprises Chapter 1 may be found by instructors to contain 
formal material already known to their students, in which case it will be more profit­
able to start at a more relaxed pace with Chapter 2 and use the overview for checking 
specific constructions. 
Chapters 2 and 3 together provide an introduction to functional syntax, including 
complementation of the verb, while Chapter 4 addresses the grammar of interpersonal 
interaction and 5 that of basic semantic roles. Chapter 6 on the grammatical resources 
used in information packaging, Chapter 7 on clause combining and 9 on tense, aspect 
and modality, respectively, could make up a short specialised course. Related areas 
and topics are ‘signposted’ by cross-references.
Whether the book is studied with or without guidance, access to contents of each 
chapter the grammatical terms and topics treated in it is facilitated in four ways: 
1	
by the initial list of chapter and unit headings;
2	
by the Summary that precedes each unit and specifies the main points dealt with; 
3	
by the section and subsection headings listed at the beginning of each chapter;
4	
by the alphabetical list of items, terms and topics given in the general Index at the 
end of the book.
5	
by the abundant cross-references which facilitate the linking of one area to another.
Reference is made to the number and section of the unit in which an item is explained.

LANGUAGE AND MEANING	
UNIT 1
A functional grammar aims to match forms to function and meaning in context. This 
Unit introduces three strands of meaning that form the basis of a functional interpreta­
tion of grammar: the representational, the interpersonal and the textual.
Each of these strands is encoded in the clause (or simple sentence) as a type of 
structure. The three structures are mapped onto one another, illustrating how the 
three types of meaning combine in one linguistic expression.
1.1  COMMUNICATIVE ACTS 
Let us start from the basic concept that language is for communication. Here is part of 
a recorded conversation taken from a sociological project of the University of Bristol. 
The speakers are Janice, a girl who runs a youth club and disco in an English town, 
and Chris, one of the boys in the club, who is 19 and works in a shop. In the dialogue, 
we can distinguish various types of communicative act, or speech act, by which 
people communicate with each other: making statements, asking questions, giving 
directives with the aim of getting the hearer to carry out some action, making an offer 
or promise, thanking or expressing an exclamation.
Offer
J: If you like, I’ll come into your shop tomorrow and get some
more model aeroplane kits.
Reminder
C: O.K. Don’t forget to bring the bill with you this time.
Promise
J: I won’t.
Question
Do you enjoy working there?
Statements
C: It’s all right, I suppose. Gets a bit boring. It’ll do for a while.
Statement
J: I would have thought you were good at selling things.
Statement
C: I don’t know what to do really. I’ve had other jobs. My Dad 
keeps on at me to go into his business. He keeps offering me 
better wages,
Exclamation
but the last thing to do is to work for him!
Question
J: Why?
Echo question C: Why? You don’t know my old man! I
Exclamations
wouldn’t work for him! He always
Statement
wanted me to, but we don’t get on. . . . 

4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Question
D’you think it’s possible to get me on a part-time Youth 
Leadership Course?
Offer/Promise
J: I’ll ring up tomorrow, Chris, and find out for you.
Thanking
C: Thanks a lot.
In a communicative exchange such as this, between two speakers, the kind of mean­
ing encoded as questions, statements, offers, reminders and thanks is ­interpersonal 
meaning. Asking and stating are basic communicative acts. The thing asked for or 
stated may be something linguistic – such as information or an opinion (Do you enjoy 
working there? It’s all right, I suppose) – or it may be something non-linguistic, some type 
of goods and services, such as handing over the aeroplane kits.
This non-linguistic exchange may be verbalised – by, for instance, Here you are – but 
it need not be. Typically, however, when goods and services are exchanged, verbal 
interaction takes place too; for instance, asking a favour (Do you think it’s possible to get 
me on a part-time Youth Leadership Course?) or giving a promise (I’ll ring up tomorrow, 
Chris, and find out for you) are carried out verbally.
The grammatical forms that encode two basic types of interpersonal communica­
tion – stating and questioning – are illustrated in section 1.3.2. The whole area is 
dealt with more fully in Chapter 4.
1.2  THE CONTENT OF COMMUNICATION
Every speech act, whether spoken or written, takes place in a social context. A
telephone conversation, writing a letter, buying a newspaper, giving or attending a 
lecture, are all contexts within which the different speech acts are carried out. Such 
contexts have to do with our own or someone else’s experience of life and the world at 
large, that is, the doings and happenings in which we are involved or which affect us.
Any happening or state in real life, or in an imaginary world of the mind, can be 
expressed through language as a situation or state of affairs. Used in this way, the 
terms ‘situation’ or ‘state of affairs ‘ do not refer directly to an extra-linguistic reality 
that exists in the real world, but rather to the speaker’s conceptualisation of it. The 
components of this conceptualisation of reality are semantic roles or functions 
and may be described in very general terms as follows:         
1	
processes: that is, actions, events, states, types of behaviour;
2 	 participants: that is, entities of all kinds, not only human, but inanimate, con­
crete and abstract, that are involved in the processes;
3	
attributes: that is, qualities and characteristics of the participants;
4 	 circumstances: that is, any kind of contingent fact or subsidiary situation which 
is associated with the process or the main situation.

B A S I C  C O N C E P T S

The following example from the text shows one possible configuration of certain 
semantic roles:
I
’ll come
into your shop
tomorrow
Participant
Process
Circumstance
Circumstance
Figure 1.1  Participant, process and circumstances.
The kind of meaning expressed by these elements of semantic structure is
representational meaning, or meaning that has to do with the content of the mes­
sage. The various types of process, participants, attributes and circumstances are 
outlined in the following sections and described more fully in Chapter 5.
1.3  THREE WAYS OF INTERPRETING CLAUSE STRUCTURE
The clause or simple sentence is the basic unit that embodies our construal of repre- 
sentational meaning and interpersonal meaning. The clause is also the unit whose 
elements can be reordered in certain ways to facilitate the creation of textual mean­
ing. The textual resources of the clause, such as the active–passive alternative, enable 
the representational strand and the interpersonal strand of meaning to cohere as a 
message, not simply as a sentence in isolation, but in relation to what precedes it in 
the discourse.
Each type of meaning is encoded by its own structures; the three types of structure 
combine to produce one single realisation in words.
To summarise, the three kinds of meaning derive from the consideration of a clause 
as: (a) the linguistic representation of our experience of the world; (b) a communica­
tive exchange between persons; (c) an organised message or text. We now turn to the 
three types of structure that implement these meanings.
1.3.1  The clause as representing situations: transitivity structures
The representational meaning of the clause is encoded through the transitivity struc­
tures, whose elements of structure or functions include: Agent, Recipient, Affected, 
Process, Attribute and Circumstance, as described in Chapter 5. Some of these make 
up the semantic structure of the following example:
Janice
will give
Chris
the bill
tomorrow
Agent
Process
(action)
Recipient
Affected
Circumstance
(time)
Figure 1.2  Semantic roles.
With a process of ‘doing’ such as the action of giving, the Agent is that participant 
which carries out the action referred to by the verb; the Recipient is that participant 
who receives the ‘goods’ or ‘information’ encoded as the Affected. Circumstances 

6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
attending the process are classified as locative, temporal, conditional, concessive, 
causal, resultant, among others.
1.3.2  The clause as interaction: mood structures
The clause is also the major grammatical unit used by speakers to ask questions, make 
statements and issue directives. Unless the conversation is very one-sided, the roles 
of ‘questioner’ and ‘informant’ tend to alternate between the interlocutors engaged in 
a conversation, as can be seen in the exchange of speech roles between Chris and 
Janice.
The exchange of information is typically carried out by the indicative mood or 
clause type, as opposed to directives, which are typically expressed by the impera­
tive mood. Within the indicative, making a statement is associated characteristically 
with the declarative mood, and asking a question with the interrogative. More exactly, 
it is one part of these structures – consisting of the Subject and the Finite element
(→ 3.1.1) – that in English carries the syntactic burden of the exchange. The rest of the 
clause remains unchanged.
In a declarative clause, the Subject precedes the Finite.

Figure 1.4  Order of syntactic elements in the interrogative clause.
In the interrogative structure, the positions of Finite and Subject are reversed, the 
Predicator and the rest of the clause remaining the same. The Finite is that element 
which relates the content of the clause to the speech event. It does this by referring 
to present or past time, through tense, or by expressing an attitude of the speaker, 
through the modal auxiliaries, such as will, among other features (→ 3.1.1 and 14.3 for 
the interrogative). 
1.3.3  The clause as message: thematic structures
Here, the speaker organises the informational content of the clause so as to establish 
whatever point of departure is desired for the message. This is called the Theme, 

B A S I C  C O N C E P T S

which in English coincides with the initial element or elements of the clause. The rest 
of the clause is the Rheme:
Janice
will  give
Chris
the bill
tomorrow
Theme
Rheme
Figure 1. 5  Theme-Rheme order.
The Theme may coincide with one of the participants, as in this example, or it may 
‘set the scene’ by coinciding with an initial expression of time, place, etc. These pos­
sibilities are treated fully in Chapter 6.
1.3.4  Combining the three types of structure
The three types of structure are here mapped simultaneously onto the example clause, 
in order to show the tripartite nature and analysis of English clauses from a functional 
point of view. Predicator, Objects and Adjunct are included as ­syntactic elements 
or functions, which correspond to the semantic roles. We examine the syntactic 
functions more closely in Chapter 2.

Figure 1. 6  Combining the three structures.
In a typical active declarative clause such as this, Agent, Subject and Theme coin­
cide and are realised in one wording, in this case Janice. But in natural language use, 
a situation can be expressed in different ways, in which the order of clause elements 
can vary, since different elements of structure can be moved to initial position. Our 
present example admits at least the following possible variants: 
Chris	
will be given the bill (by Janice) tomorrow.
The bill	
will be given to Chris tomorrow (by Janice).
Tomorrow,	 Chris will be given the bill (by Janice).
The motivation for these and other variants is not to be found in the clause in isola­
tion, but in its relationship to that part of the discourse at which it is located. Speakers 
organise the content of the clause in order to achieve the best effect for their commu­
nicative purpose. This involves establishing the point of departure of the clausal mes­
sage – that is, the Theme – in relation to what has gone before. This choice conditions 
to a large extent the way the clausal message will develop. 
As we shall encounter instances of the passive voice in use in the forthcoming pages, 
it may be useful at this point to provide a brief summary of this important option. 

8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
1.3.5  Active vs passive voice
In an active clause the participant that carries out the action (the Agent) is also the 
grammatical Subject of the verb:
Chris (S) posts (V) the letters (O) every day.
In a corresponding passive clause, the grammatical constituent the letters is moved to 
the front and becomes the subject, while Chris is placed at the end in a by-phrase, which 
is usually optional:
The letters (S) are posted (V) every day (A) (by Chris) (A).
The active verb posts is replaced by the passive verb are posted The passive verbal 
structure typically consists of a form of be and a past participle. Verbs which can take 
the passive are transitive verbs such as post or eat, which take one Object, or those such 
as such as give, which take two Objects. The latter typically have two passive alterna­
tives (→ 4.2.3).
By using the passive instead of the active voice in all three variants listed above, 
the Agent can be omitted altogether, leaving other semantic roles to take its place
(→ 20.1C, 30.3). 
By means of such reorganisations of the clausal message, the content of the clause 
can be made to relate to the rest of the discourse and to the communicative context 
in which it is produced. 
We shall now look at the full range of grammatical units in a hierarchy where the 
clause is central. We shall then look briefly at the unit above the clause, the ‘complex 
sentence’, and the units immediately below the clause, the ‘groups’.

LINGUISTIC FORMS AND	
UNIT 2
SYNTACTIC FUNCTIONS	
2.1  SYNTACTIC CATEGORIES AND RELATIONSHIPS
In this Unit we shall outline the basic syntactic concepts on which our structural analysis
is based. These include the structural units which can be arranged by rank, the 
classes into which these units can be divided, and the elements of which they 
are composed. We shall also consider the ways units of one rank are related to those 
above or below them. 
2.2  TESTING FOR CONSTITUENTS
Before attempting to see how a stretch of language can be broken down into units, it 
is useful to be able to reinforce our intuitions as to where boundaries lie. This can be 
done by applying certain tests in order to identify whether a particular sequence of 
words is functioning as a constituent of a higher unit or not.
For instance, the following sequence, which constitutes a grammatical clause or 
simple sentence, is ambiguous:
Muriel saw the man in the service station
Two interpretations are possible, according to how the units that make up the clause 
are grouped into constituents, expressed graphically as follows: 
1	
|| Muriel | saw | the man in the service station ||
2	
|| Muriel | saw | the man || in the service station ||
In version 1, the prepositional phrase in the service station forms part of the constituent 
whose head-word is man (the man in the service station) and tells us something about the 
man; whereas in version 2 the same prepositional phrase functions separately as a 
constituent of the clause and tells us where Muriel saw the man.
Evidence for this analysis can be sought by such operations as (a) coordination, 
(b) wh-questions, (c) clefting, (d) passivisation and (e) fronting. Tests (b) to (e) involve 
moving the stretch of language around and observing its syntactic behaviour. Testing 

1 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
by coordination involves adding a coordinate that realises the same function; only 
stretches of language that realise the same function can be coordinated: 
(a)	 It can be seen that different types of conjoin are required according to the function 
of in the service station:
 (i)	 Muriel saw the man in the service station and the woman in the shop.
(ii)	 Muriel saw the man in the service station and in the shop.
(b)	 The wh-question form and the appropriate response will be different for the two 
versions:
 (i)	 Who did Muriel see? – The man in the service station.
(ii)	 Where did Muriel see the man? – In the service station.
(c)	 Clefting by means of it + that-clause highlights a clause constituent (→ 30.2) and 
thus yields two different results: 
 (i)	 It was the man in the service station that Muriel saw.
(ii)	 It was in the service station that Muriel saw the man.
Wh-clefting (→ 30.2) gives the same result:
 (i)	 The one Muriel saw was the man in the service station.
(ii)	 Where Muriel saw the man was in the service station. 
The form the one (that . . . ) is used in this construction since English does not admit 
who in this context (*Who Muriel saw was the man in the service station).
(d)	 Passivisation (→ 4.2.3 and 30.3) likewise keeps together those units or bits of lan­
guage that form a constituent. The passive counterpart of an active clause usually 
contains a form of be and a past participle: 
 (i)	 The man in the service station was seen by Muriel.
(ii)	 The man was seen by Muriel in the service station.
It is not always the case that a sequence responds equally well to all five types of test. 
Certain types of unit may resist one or more of these operations: for instance, fre­
quency adverbs such as often and usually, and modal adverbs like probably, resist cleft­
ing (*It’s often/usually/probably that Muriel saw the man in the service station), resulting in 
a sentence that is ungrammatical. Unlike some languages, in English the finite verbal 
element of a clause normally resists fronting (*Saw Muriel the man in the service station). 
Nevertheless, if two or more of the operations can be carried out satisfactorily, we 
can be reasonably sure that the sequence in question is a constituent of a larger unit.
We now turn to the description of units, their classes and the relationship holding 
between them.

2.3  GRAMMATICAL UNITS AND RANK OF UNITS
The moving-around of bits of language, as carried out in 2.2, suggests, in Randolph 
Quirk’s famous simile, that language is not a series of words strung together like beads 
on a string. Language is patterned, that is, certain regularities can be distinguished 
throughout every linguistic manifestation in discourse. A unit will be defined as any 
sequence that constitutes a semantic whole and which has a recognised pattern that is 
repeated regularly in speech and writing. For instance, the previous sentence is a unit 
containing other units such as a recognised pattern and in speech and writing. Sequences 
such as defined as any and repeated regularly in, which also occur in the same sentence, 
do not constitute units since they have no semantic whole and no syntactic pattern. 
The following sequence, which comments on the effects of a nuclear accident, consti­
tutes one syntactic unit which is composed of further units:
The effects of the accident are very serious.
In English, it is useful to recognise four structural units which can be arranged in a 
relationship of componence on what is called a rank-scale:
Unit
Boundary marker
Example
Clause:
||
|| the effects of the accident are very serious ||
Group:
|
| the effects of the accident | are | very serious |
Word:
a space
the effects of the accident are very serious
Morpheme:
+
{EFFECT} + {PLURAL}, realised by the morphs effect and –s
Figure 1.7  Units on the rank scale.
For the initial stages of analysis it may be helpful to mark off the boundaries of 
each unit by a symbol, such as those adopted in the example. The symbol for ‘clause 
boundary’ is a double vertical line ||, that for ‘group boundary’ is a single vertical line |, 
and that for ‘word boundary’ is simply a space, as is conventionally used in the written 
language. The independent clause is the equivalent of the traditional ‘simple sentence’. 
Combinations of clauses, the boundaries symbolised by |||, are illustrated in 2.4.1 and 
treated more fully in Chapter 7.
The relationship between the units is, in principle, as follows. Looking downwards, 
each unit consists of one or more units of the rank below it. Thus, a clause consists of 
one or more groups, a group consists of one or more words and a word consists of one 
or more morphemes. For instance, Wait! consists of one clause, which consists of one 
group, which consists of one word, which consists of one morpheme. More exactly, 
we shall say that the elements of structure of each unit are realised by units of the rank 
below.
Looking upwards, each unit fulfils a function in the unit above it. However, as we 
shall see in 3.6.3 and in later chapters, units may be ‘embedded’ within other units, 
such as the clause who live in the north within the nominal group people who live in the 

1 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
north. Similarly, the prepositional phrase of the accident is embedded in the nominal 
group the effects of the accident.
We shall be concerned in this book mainly with two units: clause and group. The 
structure and constituents of these units will be described in later sections, together 
with their functions and meanings.
2.4  CLASSES OF UNITS
At each rank of grammatical unit mentioned in 2.3, there are various classes of unit.
2.4.1  Classes of clauses
A.  Finite and non-finite clauses
At the rank of ‘clause’, a first distinction to be made is that between finite and non- 
finite clauses. As clauses have as their central element the verbal group, their status as 
finite or non-finite depends on the form of the verb chosen. Finite verbs, and therefore 
also finite clauses, are marked for either tense or modality, but not both. Their function 
is to relate the verb to the speech event. Tensed forms distinguish the present tense 
(lock, locks) from the past tense (locked) in regular verbs and many irregular verbs also, 
as in eat, ate; go, went. This distinction is not made on all irregular verbs, for example 
shut, which has the same form for the present and past tenses. Person and number 
are marked only on the third person singular of the present tense (locks, shuts) – except 
for the verb be, which has further forms (→ 3.1.1).
Tense is carried not only by lexical verbs but also by the finite operators. Modality 
is marked by the modal verbs, which also function as operators (→ 3.1.1). If the speaker 
wishes to express tense or modality, together with person and number, a ‘finite’ form 
of the verb is chosen, therefore, such as is, eats, locked, went, will stay and the clause is 
then called a finite clause (fin.cl). For example, in the following paragraph all the 
verbs – and therefore all the clauses (marked 1, 2 etc.) – are finite:
||I had a farm in Africa, at the foot of the Ngong hills.||1 |||The Equator runs across these highlands a 
hundred miles to the north,||2 and the farm lay at an altitude of over six thousand feet. 3||| In the 
daytime you felt that you had got high up, near to the sun, 4|| but the early mornings and evenings 
were limpid and restful, 5|| and the nights were cold. 6|||
(Karen Blixen, Out of Africa)
If the verb-form does not signal either tense or modality, the verb and the clause are 
classified as non-finite (V-non-fin; non-fin.cl). The non-finite verb forms are: 
••
the infinitive (inf.) (be, eat, lock, go) sometimes called the ‘bare’ infinitive;
••
the to-infinitive (to-inf); to be, to eat, to lock, to go
••
the participial –ing form (-ing) (being, eating, locking, going); and
••
the past participial form, symbolised in this book as -en (been, eaten, locked, gone).

B A S I C  C O N C E P T S  
1 3
These forms are said to be non-tensed. Non-finite clauses are illustrated by the
following examples: 
They want to hire a caravan.
to-infinitive clause
Tim helped her carry her bags upstairs.
bare infinitive clause
We found Ann sitting in the garden.
-ing participial clause
The invitations were sent written by hand.
-en participial clause
The past participial type is illustrated in the following extract from Severin Carrel in 
The Guardian:
Had she been born,1 Tian Tian’s cub would have spent her life denied freedom, besieged 
by a constant onslaught of visitors, separated from her mother, shunted from one zoo to 
another, artificially inseminated and treated as a commodity.2 
1 The structure Had + subject + Past participle is an alternative to the conditional clause 
with ‘if’ (→ 34.3) ‘If she had been born’.
2 The same forms serve for both the finite and non-finite status of many English verbs; 
denied and besieged, and the other verbs here, can all function both as a tensed (past) 
form and as a non-finite -en participle.
B.  Independent and dependent clauses
A further necessary  distinction to be made is that between  independent and 
­dependent clauses. An independent clause (indep.cl) is complete in itself, that is, it 
does not form part of a larger structure, whereas a dependent clause (dep.cl) is typi­
cally related to an independent clause. This is illustrated in the following sentence: 
They locked up the house (indep.cl), before they went on holiday (dep.cl). 
All grammatically independent clauses are finite. Dependent clauses may be finite 
or non-finite. In the previous example, the finite dependent clause before they went on 
holiday can be replaced by a non-finite clause before going on holiday. The dependent 
status of non-finite clauses is signalled by the form itself.
Only independent clauses have the variations in clause structure that make for
the different clause types: declarative, interrogative, imperative and exclamative
(→ Unit 23): 
Jack’s flat is in Hammersmith. 	
(declarative)
Is his address 20 Finchley Road? 	
(interrogative)
Give me Jack’s telephone number.	
(imperative)
What a large apartment he has!	
(exclamative)
Dependent clauses, even when finite, do not have these possibilities.

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
C.  Finite dependent clauses
Seven kinds of finite dependent clause are illustrated in this section, along with three 
important sub-types of the nominal clause.
The subordinate status of a finite dependent clause is normally signalled by means 
of subordinating conjunctions (‘subordinators’) such as when, if, before, as soon as in 
circumstantial clauses, as in 1 below (→ also 35.2), or by ‘relativisers’ such as 
which, that in relative clauses as in 2 (→ 49.3):
1	
As soon as she got home, Ann switched on the television.
2	
Paul took one of the red apples that his wife had bought that morning. 
Nominal clauses fulfil the functions of Subject, Object and Complement in clause 
structure. In a sentence such as He saw that the bottles were empty, the clause [that 
the bottles were empty] is embedded as a constituent (in this case as Object) of the 
superordinate clause he saw x. The part without the embedded clause is some­
times called the matrix clause.
The main types of nominal clause are the that-clause 3, the wh-nominal 
relative clause 4 and the dependent wh-interrogative clause 4 and 5. The 
dependent exclamative 6 is a further type of wh-clause:
3	
He saw that the bottles were empty. (that-clause)
4	
What I don’t understand is why you have come here. (nominal relative clause + 
dependent wh-interrogative)
5	
I’ll ask where the nearest Underground station is. (dependent wh-interrogative)
6	
She said how comfortable it was. (dependent exclamative clause)
Embedded clauses are discussed and illustrated in chapters 2 and 3.
Comparative clauses occur following the comparative forms of adjectives and 
adverbs. The comparative clause, introduced by than, provides the basis of comparison:
7	
The results are much better than we expected.
Supplementive units are not integrated into the main clause, as embedded units 
are, but add supplementary information. They are subordinate but not embedded. 
They are set off from the main clause by commas, or by a dash, and have their own 
intonation contour. Here is an example of a supplementive non-finite -en clause: 
Rescued in 1970 from the path of highway construction, the house was moved to a 
new site and donated to the National Trust.
In spoken discourse, and in written texts that imitate spoken language, such as fictional 
dialogue, we can often come across supplementives that are freestanding, despite 
their subordinate form, as in the following italicised example (→ chapters 5, 7 and 10): 
The large size doesn’t seem to be available. Which is a pity.
Not only clauses, but other units can have the status of ‘supplementives’ (→ 49.2).

B A S I C  C O N C E P T S  
1 5
A subsidiary type of clause is the verbless clause. This is a clause which lacks a 
verb and often a subject also. The omitted verb is typically a form of be and is recover­
able from the situational or linguistic context, as in: 
Book your tickets well in advance, whenever possible. (= whenever it is possible)
 The following extract from Elaine Morgan’s, The Descent of Woman illustrates this type 
very well: 
Man, apes and monkeys can all be observed to cry out when in pain, flush when enraged, 
yawn when tired, glare when defiant, grin when tickled, tremble when afraid, embrace when 
affectionate, bare their teeth when hostile, raise their eyebrows when surprised, and turn their 
heads away when offended.
We shall also classify as verbless clauses many irregular constructions such as the 
following:
Wh-questions without a finite verb: 	
Why not sell your car and get a new one?
Adjuncts with the force of a command,	
Hands off! Into the shelter, everybody!  
  sometimes with a vocative:	
Ellipted interrogative and exclamative 	
Sure? (Are you sure?) Fantastic! 
  clauses: 	
  (That/It is fantastic)
Proverbs of the type:	
Out of sight, out of mind.
Finally, we shall call abbreviated clauses those such as can you? I won’t, has she? 
which consist of the Subject + Finite operator alone, with the rest of the clause ellipted 
because it is known. These clauses typically occur as responses in conversational 
exchanges and as tags (→ 22.4), but can also express such speech acts as reprimand 
(Must you?), given an appropriate social context.
2.4.2  Classes of groups 
Groups are classified according to the class of the word operating as the main or ‘head’ 
element. Headed by a noun, an adjective, an adverb and a verb respectively, we can 
identify the following classes:
Nominal Groups
(NG)
films,
wonderful films by Fellini
Verbal Groups
(VG)
return,
will return
Adjectival Groups
(AdjG)
good,
quite good at languages
Adverbial Groups
(AdvG)
fluently,
very fluently indeed 

1 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Units such as these centre round one main element, which typically cannot be omit­
ted. Furthermore, the main element can replace the whole structure: films, return, good 
and fluently can have the same syntactic functions as the whole group of which each is 
head, or, in the case of return, as lexical verb. By contrast, the unit formed by a preposi­
tion and its complement, such as on the floor, is rather different. The preposition can’t 
function alone as a unit. Both elements are obligatory. This unit will therefore be called 
the ‘Prepositional Phrase’ (PP).
2.4.3  Classes of words
Words are classified grammatically according to the traditional terminology, which 
includes noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, pronoun, article and 
conjunction. These ‘parts of speech’ are divided into two main classes, the open 
and the closed. The open classes are those that freely admit new members into the 
vocabulary. They comprise noun, verb, adjective and adverb. The closed classes 
(preposition, pronoun and article) do not easily admit new members. Prepositions 
have gradually expanded their membership somewhat by admitting participles such as 
including, concerning, but the remaining classes are very resistant to the introduction of 
new items. This has been noticeable in recent years when attempts have been made 
to find gender-neutral pronouns.
2.4.4  Classes of morphemes
Words are made up of morphemes. We shall consider the morpheme to be an abstract 
category that has either a lexical or a grammatical meaning. We have already indicated 
in 2.3 that a word such as effects can be considered as formed from the lexical mor­
pheme {EFFECT} + the {PLURAL} morpheme. These abstract categories are realised 
by morphs such as effect and -s or /ifekt/and /s/, the actual segments of written and 
spoken language, respectively.
Since the study of words and morphemes takes us out of syntax, and into mor­
phology and phonology, the scope of this book does not allow for further treatment 
of these units.
2.5  THE CONCEPT OF UNIT STRUCTURE
The term ‘structure’ refers to the relationships that exist between the small units that 
make up a larger unit
Everything in our lives has structure. A house may be built of bricks, but its struc­
ture consists of rooms having different formal, functional and distributional charac­
teristics. All objects are composed of functionally related ‘formal items’; and the same 
applies to activities such as board meetings, plays, symphonies and football matches. 
It is natural that languages, which are the spoken and written representation of our 
experience of all these things, are also manifested in structured forms. Grammatical 
structures are described in terms of the semantic functions of their various elements 
and the syntactic forms and relationships which express them.

B A S I C  C O N C E P T S  
1 7
We have seen in 1.3.1 a brief preview of the main semantic elements of the clause, 
together with some of the possible configurations produced by the combinations of 
these elements. Groups, whose function it is to express the things, processes, qualities 
and circumstances of our experience, also have semantic elements and structures. 
These are different for each type of group and are treated in the relevant chapter on 
each of these classes of unit. Here we shall briefly present the syntactic elements of all 
ranks of unit.
2.5.1  Syntactic elements of clauses
Clauses have the greatest number of syntactic elements or functions of all classes of 
unit. The criteria for their identification, the syntactic features and the realisations of 
each are discussed in Chapter 2. Here we simply list and exemplify the clause ele­
ments within common clause structures. The type of structure used in order to express 
a ‘situation’ or ‘state of affairs’ depends to a great extent on the verb chosen. Verb 
complementation types are treated in Chapter 3. 
Subject (S)
Jupiter is the largest planet.
SPCs
Predicator (P)
The election campaign has ended.
SP
Direct Object (O)
Ted has bought a new motorbike.
SPO
Indirect Object (O)
They sent their friends postcards.
SPOO
Subject Complement (Cs)
He is powerless to make any changes.
SPCs
Object Complement (Co)
We consider the situation alarming. SPOCo
Locative/Goal Complement (Cloc) We flew to Moscow.
SPCloc
Circumstantial Adjunct (A)
The news reached us on Tuesday.
SPOA
Stance Adjunct (A)
Sadly, we could not reach Ely in time. ASPOA
Connective Adjunct (A)
However, other friends were present. ASPCs
It will be seen that for interrogative and negative clauses we use an additional function, 
the Finite (→ 3.1 and 14.3).
2.5.2  Syntactic elements of groups
Nominal groups, adjectival groups and adverbial groups are composed of three pri­
mary elements or functions: a head (h) preceded by a pre-modifier (m) and followed 
by a post-modifier (m). In the chapters devoted to these groups we also distinguish 
‘complement’ (c) as a special type of post- head element. Complements of nouns 
and adjectives are introduced by a preposition or by a that-clause which is controlled 
by the head-word of the group. For example, the adjective good controls a comple­
ment introduced by at: good at chess. The noun belief controls a that-clause: the belief 
that he is always right. In the case of nominal groups, we also distinguish between 
‘modifiers’, which describe or classify the head, and ‘determiners’ (d), which specify it 

1 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
in terms of definiteness, quantity, possessiveness, etc. Thus, we give the determiner 
and the pre- and post-modifiers equal syntactic status as primary elements of nominal 
groups (→ 45.2). The following are examples of these group structures: 
NG:	
dmhm:	 those | beautiful | paintings | by Goya
AdjG:	
mhc: 	
extremely | difficult | to translate
AdvG:	
mhm:	
very | carefully | indeed
In Verbal Groups, the lexical verb is regarded as the main element (v), which either 
functions alone, whether in finite or non-finite form, as in the example Walking along 
the street, I met a friend of mine, or is preceded by auxiliaries (x), as in will go or has been 
reading. The first auxiliary (or the auxiliary, if there is only one) is called the ‘finite 
operator’ (o). It is the element that contributes information about tense, modality, 
number and person, and so helps to make the VG finite and fully ‘operative’. It is also 
the element that operates in the syntactic structure to make the clause interrogative 
and/or negative (→ 3.1.1), and to make ellipted responses:
Have you been driving for many years? – Yes, I have.
Do you enjoy driving? – Yes, I do.
In the more complex verbal groups, each element is telescoped into the following one 
(→ 38.7):
v:	
plays
ov:	
has | played        [have + -en]
oxv:	
will | be | playing        [will + [be + -ing]]
oxxv: 	 must | have | been | played         [must + [have + -en] [be + -en]]
The lexical verb is sometimes followed by an adverbial particle (symbolised by ‘p’) as 
in ring up, break out, take over. Many such combinations form integrated semantic units
which are idiomatic (→ 6.4). Transitive combinations can be discontinuous as in I’ll 
ring you up, They’ve taken it over.
The syntax of phrasal verbs and other multi-word combinations is discussed in 6.4 
and the semantics (in terms of Source, Path and Goal) in 40.2.
In Prepositional Phrases (PP) there are two obligatory elements: the preposi- 
tional head (h) and the complement (c). There is also an optional modifier (m), which 
is typically realised by an adverb of degree (e.g. right, quite). The structure of PPs is 
illustrated as follows:
mhc:	 right | across | the road
	
quite | out of | practice.
The structure and grammatical functions of the prepositional phrase are treated in 
Chapter 12, together with prepositional meanings, which are described in terms of 
containment, location etc. in literal, metaphorical and abstract uses.

2.5.3  Componence, realisation and function
Any structure can be considered to be composed of elements which form a configura­
tion of elements or ‘functions’, whether semantic such as Agent-Process-Affected or 
syntactic such as the clause configuration Subject-Predicator-Object or the modifier-
head-modifier structure of the nominal group.
Each of these is in turn realised by a unit which is itself, at least potentially, a con­
figuration of elements, and these in turn are realised by others until the final stage is 
reached and abstract categories such as subject, head, modifier, etc., are finally real­
ised by the segments of the spoken or written language. The ‘structural tree’ on page 
19 diagrams this model of analysis at the three unit ranks of clause, group and word, to 
illustrate the clause The bus strike will affect many people tomorrow.
An important property of language is the fact that there is no one-to-one corre- 
spondence between the class of unit and its function. While it is true that certain 
classes of unit typically realise certain functions, Nominal Groups at Subject and Object 
functions, for instance, it is nevertheless also true that many classes of unit can fulfil 
many different functions, and different functions are realised by many different classes 
of unit. For instance, the NG next time can fulfil the following clause functions, among 
others: 
Subject: 	
Next time will be better.
Adjunct: 	
I’ll know better next time.
The nearest to a one-to-one relationship in the grammar is that between the process 
and the verbal group that realises it.
This many-to-many relationship is fundamental for understanding the relationship 
of the grammar of English to discourse. By this it is not implied that discourse (or even 
a text) is a kind of super-sentence, a grammatical unit that is simply ‘larger’ than 
a sentence and with the same kind of relationship holding between its parts as that

which holds between grammatical units. A piece of discourse is quite different in kind 
from a grammatical unit. Rather than grammatical, it is a pragmatic-semantic unit 
of whatever length, spoken or written, and which forms a unified whole, with respect 
both to its internal properties and to the social context in which it is produced. 
To take a minimal instance, a pragmatic act such as ‘leave-taking’ may be real­
ised by a modalised declarative clause (I’ll be seeing you) or by the formulaic expression 
Goodbye, among others. Typically, a discourse is made up of various types of pragmatic 
acts, which in turn are realised semantically and syntactically. In this book, although 
we start from the grammar rather than from the text, the relationship between the two 
is of primary interest.

NEGATION AND EXPANSION	
UNIT 3 
3.1  NEGATIVE AND INTERROGATIVE CLAUSE STRUCTURES
Negating and questioning are basic human needs, which are encoded grammatically by 
negation and by the interrogative, respectively. English is unlike many other languages 
in using a finite operator to form negative and interrogative clause structures.
The verb’s corresponding negative forms normally have n’t added to the positive 
forms. The following are irregular: can’t (from cannot), shan’t (from shall not), won’t (from 
will not). May not is not usually abbreviated to mayn’t. When n’t follows a consonant
– as in didn’t, wouldn’t – it is pronounced as a separate syllable. The inflectional n’t 
forms are used in spoken English and in informal written styles that imitate speech, 
such as fictional dialogue. The full form not is used in formal written styles and for 
emphasis
– as in The play was not a success, rather than The play wasn’t a success.
3.1.1  The finite operator
The operator is a verb, of one of the following types: primary, modal or do, as 
explained below.
primary:	
positive: am, is, are, was, were, have, has, had
	
negative: am not (aren’t in negative-interrogative), isn’t, aren’t, 
wasn’t, weren’t, haven’t, hasn’t, hadn’t
modal:	
positive: can, could, will, would, shall, should, may, might, ought 
negative: can’t, couldn’t, won’t, wouldn’t, shan’t, shouldn’t, may not, 
mightn’t, oughtn’t
the ‘do’ operator:	
positive: does, do, did negative; doesn’t, don’t, didn’t 
Worthy of mention here are the lexical auxiliaries based on the primary verbs be 
(be about to, be sure to, be going to, etc.) and have (have to, have got to), which are discussed 
in 37.3. The primary verb functions as a normal operator in these combinations.
Less commonly in use are the semi-modals dare and need, which as modals are 
used in negative and interrogative clauses, and admit the abbreviated forms daren’t 
and needn’t, respectively. (Dare you tell her? I daren’t tell her. How dare you speak to me 
like that? Need I go? You needn’t go).

2 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Dare can be used with will, should and would, a possibility that is not open to modals 
in general: Nobody will dare vote against the proposal; I wouldn’t dare take a space-trip 
even if I were offered one.
Dare and need also behave like full lexical verbs requiring the do-operator: I didn’t 
dare go. I didn’t need to go. Didn’t you dare go? Didn’t you need to go? Didn’t dare is more 
common now than dared not (He dared not say a word, He didn’t dare say a word).
3.2  CLAUSAL NEGATION
In clauses, negation is usually made with the particle not, by negating the finite opera­
tor (is not, cannot/isn’t, can’t, etc.), or a non-finite verb in a dependent clause (not wish­
ing to disturb them). *Amn’t is not used in Standard English for the first person singular; 
instead, I’m not (declarative) and Aren’t I (interrogative) are used. If no other auxiliary 
is present, a form of do (do, does, did) is brought in as operator. Compare the following 
positive and negative declarative clauses: 
That man is the Secretary.	
That man is not/isn’t the Secretary.
He took the car. 	
He didn’t take the car.
Ed always does the dishes. 	
Ed doesn’t always do the dishes. 
The last example here illustrates the use of does both as a lexical verb and as operator.
Don’t is the regular negative form used in second person imperatives: Don’t be late!
Some operators admit an alternative type of abbreviation with the subject in nega­
tive clauses. This occurs usually only with a pronoun. Both types are used in spoken 
English, the ‘not’ type being preferred in AmE:
They aren’t ready. 	
They’re not ready.
She isn’t coming with us.	 She’s not coming with us.
He hasn’t finished. 	
He’s not finished.
We haven’t got enough. 	
We’ve not got enough.
3.2.1  Interrogative clauses
These invert the operator with the subject of the clause: 
Positive-interrogative	
Negative-interrogative
Is that man the Secretary? 	
Isn’t that man the Secretary?
Did he take the car? 	
Didn’t he take the car?
Does Ed always do the dishes?	 Doesn’t Ed always do the dishes?
There are two types of interrogative clause. One is the yes/no type, illustrated here, 
which simply asks for an answer in terms of yes or no. The other is the wh-type, which 
asks for the information represented by the wh-word what? who? where? and so on. 
The inversion of subject–operator is the same as for the yes/no type, except when 
who functions as subject:

B A S I C  C O N C E P T S  
2 3
Who came to see you?	 When can you come to see us? 
What does Ed do?	
When did you see him last?
3.3  NO-NEGATION VS NOT-NEGATION + ANY
Another way of negating a clause is by using a non-verbal ‘nuclear’ negative word such 
as nobody, nothing, no or never. When we need a negative element as subject, a nuclear 
form is necessary: Nobody came after all, Nothing was said, No money was found (see 
below, and also Chapter 10). Nuclear negative words are also common in existential 
clauses: There’s nothing to worry about.
In many cases a similar idea can be expressed by using either no-negation or not- 
negation + any:
Have you any money? 	
I haven’t any money.
I have no money.
Do you know anyone called Stern?	
I don’t know anyone called Stern.
I know no-one called Stern.
In questions, either alternative is possible even when the negative item is subject, as 
opposed to the single possible structure in negative declarative clauses. Compare:
Declarative negative: 	
Nobody has called this afternoon.
Interrogative negative:	
Has nobody called this afternoon?
Hasn’t anybody called this afternoon?
When both are possible, the no-form tends to be more emphatic or more suited to 
writing or formal spoken English. A very emphatic negative meaning is conveyed in 
spoken English also by, for example, She’s no friend of mine. He’s no actor.
3.4  ANY AND OTHER NON-ASSERTIVE WORDS
Unlike many languages, Standard English does not favour cumulative negation, that 
is a ‘not’ negative together with one or more nuclear negatives in one clause, such as 
*We’re not going nowhere, although this is a feature of certain dialects. Instead the 
first negative item is followed throughout the rest of the clause by one or more non-
assertive items such as any or its compounds, as in:
We’re not going anywhere with any of our friends.
I didn’t say anything about it to anyone.

2 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
It is important to remember that the ‘any’ words in English (any, anyone, anybody, any­
thing, anywhere, AmE anyplace)) are not in themselves negative. In order to be used in a 
negative clause they must be preceded by not or a negative word; they must be within 
the ‘scope of negation’ (→ 3.5). So instead of Nobody came, it is not acceptable to say 
*Anybody came or *Anybody didn’t come. These are ungrammatical and meaningless, 
hence the deliberate oddity of e.e. cummings’ poem ‘Anyone lived in a little how town’.
The any words (together with ever and yet, among others) are what we call ‘non- 
assertive’ items, as opposed to some and its compounds, which are ‘assertive’. Assertive 
forms have factual meanings and typically occur in positive declarative clauses. 
Non-assertive words such as any are associated with non-factual meanings in the 
sense of non-fulfilment or potentiality, which is a feature of negative, interroga­
tive, conditional and comparative clauses, and semi-negative words such as without 
and hardly, among others. It is, in fact, the general non-factual meaning, rather than 
any particular structure which provides the context for non-assertive items to be used:
We have some very good coffee.  (declarative, factual)
This coffee is better than any I have ever tasted. (comparative, non-factual)
If you want any more coffee, you must make it yourself.  (conditional, non-factual) 
Did you say anything? (interrogative, non-factual)
Didn’t you go anywhere interesting?  (interrogative-negative, non-factual) 
Without any delay.
Hardly anyone knew his name.
Stressed any is used in positive declarative clauses, and has a non-factual meaning (= 
it doesn’t matter which/who); (→ 47.1.)
Choose any of the questions in section 1.
Anybody with a bit of sense would have refused to go.
Any house is better than no house.

3.5  THE SCOPE OF NEGATION
By the scope of negation we mean the semantic influence that a negative word has on 
the rest of the clause that follows it. Typically, all that follows the negative form to the 
end of the clause will be non-assertive and within the scope of negation. Thus, in Some 
people don’t have any sense of humour, some is outside the scope of negation, whereas any 
is inside it.
As the non-assertive forms are not in themselves negative, they cannot initiate the 
scope of negation by standing in initial position in the place of a nuclear negative form. 
Assertive forms such as some and its compounds can occur after a negative word, but 
they must necessarily stand outside the scope of negation. Compare the difference in 
meaning between the two following clauses:
1  He didn’t reply to any of my letters. (None of my letters received a reply)
2  He didn’t reply to some of my letters. 
(Some of my letters received a reply, others did not)
The non-assertive form any in example 1 expresses the scope of negation as extend­
ing to the end of the clause. In example 2, on the other hand, some must be interpreted 
as outside the scope of negation.
The scope of negation is closely related to the function of Adjuncts in the clause. 
Compare the difference in meaning between examples 3 and 4 below, in which the 
manner Adjunct clearly is within the scope of negation in 3, while the attitudinal sen­
tence Adjunct clearly in 4 is outside it:
3  She didn’t explain the problem clearly.
4  She clearly didn’t explain the problem.
The scope of negation can also explain the occasional occurrence of two negative 
words in the same clause as in You can’t NOT go. Here each negative item has its own 
scope.
3.6  LOCAL NEGATION
Our discussion so far has centred on clausal negation. Groups, words and non-finite 
clauses can be negated by not, without the entire finite clause being negated: 
She was admitted into hospital not long ago.
Not realising the danger, she walked in the dark towards the edge of the cliff. 
Try not to get too tired playing tennis.
She would prefer not to go on a Mediterranean cruise for a holiday.
Negative declaratives typically express a negative statement, but they can also be 
used to ask tactful questions, as in the following extract from a detective story. The 
person questioned replies mostly with straight negative statements, adding in2 the 
expression of polite regret I’m afraid, but in8 she avoids total commitment:

2 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R

‘You don’t know the actual name of the firm or association that employed her?’1
‘No, I don’t,2 I’m afraid.’
‘Did she ever mention relatives?’
‘No. I gather she was a widow and had lost her husband many years ago. A bit of an invalid 
he’d been, but she never talked much about him.’3
‘She didn’t mention where she came from4 – what part of the country?’
‘I don’t think she was a Londoner.5 Came from somewhere up north, I should say.’
‘You didn’t feel there was anything – well, mysterious about her?6
Lejeune felt a doubt as he spoke. If she was a suggestible woman – but Mrs. Coppins did not take 
advantage of the opportunity offered to her.7
‘Well I can’t really say8 that I did. Certainly not from anything she ever said.9 The only thing that 
perhaps might have made me wonder was her suitcase. Good quality
it was, but not new.’
(Agatha Christie, The Pale Horse)
1question; 2negative statement; 3negative statement; 4question; 5transferred negation; 6question; 
7negative statement; 8hedge; 9negative statement.
Transferred negation consists in displacing the negative element from its logical 
place in the reported clause to negate the verb in the main clause. So in note 5, instead 
of I think she wasn’t a Londoner, we have I don’t think she was a Londoner. This is very 
common in English.
3.7  EXPANDING LINGUISTIC UNITS
Each of the grammatical units outlined in in Unit 2, 2.4.1 to 2.4.3, has been illustrated 
by single occurrences of that unit, for instance, one Nominal Group functioning at 
Subject or Object, one modifier of an adjective or an adverb. Quite frequently our 
everyday communication requires no more. But units can be expanded to enable the 
speaker or writer to add further information which is, nevertheless, contained within 
the chosen structure at any point in the discourse. Here we simply exemplify coordi­
nation, subordination and embedding of various classes of elements, with the 
reminder that most elements of structure can be realised more than once.
3.7.1  Coordination
The following are examples of coordination of various classes of elements:
morphemes in a word:	
pro- and anti- abortionists
heads of nominal groups:	
books, papers and magazines
modifier in a NG:	
a beautiful and astonishing sight
modifier in an AdjG:	
He says he is really and truly sorry for what happened.
adjuncts in a clause:	
You can put in the application now or in a month’s 
  time or else next year.
independent clauses: 	
She got dressed quickly, had breakfast and went out to work

B A S I C  C O N C E P T S  
2 7
dependent clauses: 	
I will take a holiday when the course is over and if I 
  pass the exam and also provided I can afford it.
If the various conjoined clauses share the same subject or the same operator, these ele­
ments are regularly ellipted because they are recoverable (→ 5.1.5B), and are implicit 
in subsequent conjoined clauses. This occurs in the above example of independent 
clauses where ‘she’ is ellipted before the predicates had breakfast and went out to 
work.
3.7.2  Subordination
Similarly, the following are examples of subordination of various classes of ele­
ments (in brackets):
modifier in a NG:	
A very lovable (if rather dirty), small boy.
Cs in a clause:	
He is quite brilliant (though totally unreliable).
adjuncts in a clause:	
We arrived (late (though not too late)) for the wedding.
dependent clauses:	
I’ll let you borrow the CDs (as soon as I’ve finished) [provided 
	
  you bring them back [when I need them]].
In this complex sentence, the fourth clause when I need them is dependent on the third 
clause provided you bring them back; these together form a block which is dependent 
on the block formed by the first (independent) clause I’ll let you borrow the CDs and its 
dependent clause as soon as I’ve finished.
‘Sentence’ is the term traditionally used to denote the highest grammatical unit on 
a scale of rank. While not rejecting this term, we shall prefer, however, to use the 
term‘clause’ to refer to one independent unit. This applies also to a superordinate 
clause with embedded clauses in one or more functions, as illustrated in the next sec­
tion. We keep the traditional term ‘compound sentence’ for units of two or more coor­
dinated clauses, while the equally traditional term ‘complex sentence’ applies to units 
containing dependent clauses or dependent and conjoined clauses, as we have seen 
in some of the examples above. We shall say that in a complex sentence any number 
of clauses can be involved. These questions are further illustrated in Chapter 7 under 
the heading ‘Clause combining’.
3.7.3  Embedding
A third way of expanding the content and the structure of a linguistic unit is by embed­
ding, a kind of subordination by which a clause functions as a constituent of another 
clause or of a group. This is a pervasive phenomenon in both spoken and written 
English and is found in elements such as the following, where the embedded clause is 
enclosed in square brackets:
clause at S:	
[That he left so abruptly] doesn’t surprise me. 
clause at O: 	
I don’t know [why he left so abruptly].
clause at c in a PP:	
I’m pleased about [Jane’s winning a prize]. 
clause at m in NG:	
Thanks for the card [you sent me].

2 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
clause at A:	
[After they had signed the contract] they went off to celebrate. 
group in group:	
[[[Tom’s] sister’s] husband’s] mother
	
the box [on top of the cupboard [in my bedroom]]

SYNTACTIC ELEMENTS AND	
UNIT 4
STRUCTURES OF THE CLAUSE 	
SUMMARY
1 	 The independent clause (or simple sentence) has two basic constituents: 
subject and predicate. The Subject (S) encodes the primary participant in 
the clause.
2 	 The predicate may consist simply of the Predicator (P), realised by a verb, 
or of a Predicator followed by one or more central constituents. These 
central elements, the Object (O) and the Complement (C) are, together 
with the Subject and the Predicator, the major functional categories of the 
clause.
3 	 More specifically, we distinguish two main types of Object: Direct (Od) 
and Indirect (Oi ) and two main types of Complement (Subject Complement 
(Cs) and Object Complement (Co). A subsidiary type of Complement is the 
Prepositional Complement (PC). A further type of Complement is the cir­
cumstantial Complement, the most frequent being the Locative/Goal type 
(Cloc).
4 	 In addition, the clause may contain a number of Adjuncts (A). These are 
usually syntactically able to be omitted. Those of the largest class, the 
circumstantial Adjuncts, are the most integrated in the clause. Somewhat 
separated from clause structure by a pause or a comma, stance Adjuncts 
express a speaker’s or writer’s attitude, while connective Adjuncts link 
clauses or parts of clauses, and paragraphs.
5 	 Objects and Complements are determined by verb type and are limited in 
number in any one clause. Adjuncts are not limited in number.
6 	 On the simplest level, the central functional categories of the independent 
clause are: S, P, O and C, with A usually optional.

4.1  SUBJECT, PREDICATOR, OBJECT, COMPLEMENT, ADJUNCT
4.1.1  Subject and Predicator
The single independent clause (or simple sentence) is divided into two main parts, 
subject and predicate. Semantically and communicatively, the subject encodes 
the main participant (the plane/Tom) in the situation represented by the clause and 
has the highest claim to the status of topic. The predicate can consist entirely of 
the predicator, realised by a verbal group, as in 1 below, or the predicator together 
with one or more other elements, as in 2:
Subject
Predicator
1  The plane
2  Tom
landed
disappeared        suddenly after the concert
Figure 2.1  Subject (S) and Predicator (P).
It is the predicator that determines the number and type of these other ele­
ments. Syntactically, the Subject (S) and the Predicator (P) are the two main 
functional categories. For the purpose of analysing and creating discourse it is help­
ful to see how the predicate is made up, since this tends to be the most informative 
part of the clause. A first distinction can be made between elements that are essential 
and elements that are usually optional. This can be seen by comparing 1 and 2.
The two clause elements in 1, the Subject (the plane) and the Predicator realized 
by the verb landed are essential constituents. In 2 on the other hand, the predicate 
contains, as well as the predicator (disappeared), two elements, suddenly and after the 
concert, which are not essential for the completion of the clause. Although they are to 
a certain extent integrated in the clause, they can be omitted without affecting the 
acceptability of the clause. Such elements will be called Adjuncts (A).
4.1.2  Object and Complement
In other cases the predicate consists of the Predicator followed by one or more 
central constituents that complete the meaning. The two main functional cat­
egories which occur in post-verbal position are the Object (O) as in 3 and the 
Complement (C) as in 4:
    S
P
O
3  The students
carried
backpacks
4  Jo
is
a student
    S
P
C
Figure 2.2  Object (O) and Complement (C).

3 5
Without these, each of the above clauses would be incomplete both ­semantically 
and syntactically: [*The students carried] and [*Jo is], respectively. There are two 
main types of Object, the Direct Object (Od) as in 5, and the Indirect Object (Oi) 
as in 6. If there is only one Object, it will be the Direct Object. 
    S
P
Oi
Od
5  All the men
wore
dark suits
6  Tom
sent
me
an email
Figure 2.3  Direct Object (Od) and Indirect Object (Oi).
Semantically, the objects encode the key participants in the event other than the 
subject: dark suits, an email (Od) and me (Oi) in these examples. Note that partici- 
pants include not only human referents, but inanimate things and abstractions (→ 
Chapter 5).
Complements encode constituents that, semantically, are not participants but are 
nevertheless normally required both syntactically and semantically, such as useful in 
7 and President in 8. 
There are two main types of Complement, the Complement of the Subject 
(Cs) (Subject Complement) as in 7a and 8a, and the Complement of the Object 
(Object Complement) (Co), as in 7b and 8b:
     S
P

7b  We
found
that map

8a  Ken Brown

President
8b  They

Ken Brown
President
Figure 2.4  Complement types.
The Subject Complement and Object Complement do not encode a different kind of 
participant. Rather, they characterise or identify the Subject or the Object, respectively.
The basic clause structures formed by configurations of these functions are as 
follows: 
S-P    S-P-Od    S-P-Oi-O d    S-P-C    S-P-Od-Co
4.1.3  The Adjunct
There are three main classes of Adjunct:
1	
Circumstantial Adjuncts, which provide the setting for the situation expressed 
in the clause, as regards place, time and manner, among others: The new liner
2	
‘Queen Elizabeth 2’ sails tomorrow from Southampton.
3	
Stance Adjuncts, which express the speaker’s attitude to or evaluation of the 
content of the clause: Obviously, he’ll rely on you even more now.

3 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
4	
Connective Adjuncts, which link two clauses, signalling the semantic relation 
holding between them: The hotel was rather noisy. On the other hand, it wasn’t 
expensive (contrast).
4.2  CRITERIA FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF CLAUSE ELEMENTS 
The formal criteria adopted for the classification of clausal elements are four: determi­
nation by the verb, position, ability to become the subject and the structural realisa­
tions of these functions.
4.2.1  Determination by the verb
The number and type of objects and complements that can occur in a clause
are determined by the verb according to its potential – described in Chapters 3 and 
5 as its ‘valency’. We say that a certain verb allows an object or a complement. 
One sense of carry allows an Object that refers to the thing carried (They carried 
backpacks). By contrast, send allows two Objects, the thing sent and the recipient (Send 
me an email) . Disappear, however, does not admit an object (*He disappeared the 
money). Determination is related to verb class.
Transitive verbs usually require one or more objects. They occur in type SPO 
(carry), type S-P-Oi-Od (send), and type S-P-O-C (consider) in one of its uses.
Intransitive verbs such as disappear occur in type S-P. They do not admit an 
object, but certain intransitive verbs predict a complement of space or time, as will 
be explained shortly. → see Chapter 3. Land is transitive in The pilot landed the plane 
safely, but intransitive in The plane landed. Carry is transitive in They carried backpacks, 
but it has an intransitive use in His voice carries well (= ‘projects’).
A locative element is required by a few transitive verbs such as put and place (Put 
the scarf in the drawer; Place the casserole in the microwave). Without this locative ele­
ment, the clause is syntactically and semantically incomplete (*Put the scarf). It there­
fore has the status of a central clause element. A locative element is also predicted 
by many intransitive verbs of motion such as come, go, fly, drive, which can predict 
such meanings as Direction (flying south) and Goal, which marks an end-point (go to 
Rome). Both types will be represented here as Locative/Goal Complements subsumed 
under the abbreviation (Cloc). However, it is also possible to use these verbs without a 
locative, as in for example Are you coming? Don’t go! I’ll drive. (Drive in fact predicts an 
object or a locative or both, as in I’ll drive you to the station.)
From these we can see that prediction is less strong than requirement. An 
expression of manner is required with one sense of treat (they treated the prisoners 
badly) and with the intransitive verb behave (she has been behaving strangely lately). 
The verb last predicts an expression of extent in time (the concert lasted three hours); 
however, sometimes the lack of duration can be inferred as in Their love didn’t last. 
When predicted or required by the verb, elements such as place or time are ana­
lysed as circumstantial Complements, the equivalent of obligatory adverbials in 
some grammars. A cognitive- semantic view in terms of Source, Path and Goal, fol­
lowing verbs of motion, is given in Chapters 8 and 12.

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
3 7
Copular verbs, a type of intransitive, require a Subject Complement. Only 
verbs capable of being used as copulas can be used in this way. So, for instance, be 
and feel as in I am cold, I feel cold can be used as copulas in English but touch cannot 
(*I touch cold).
Besides predicting an attribute, verbs of being such as be, remain, stay predict 
being in a location. Their Complements are then analysed as locative (Cloc).
The following examples illustrate the parallel between attributes as Subject and 
Object Complements and the Locative/Goal types. Evidently there are many other 
verbs which function in only one of these patterns:
Attributive	
Locative/Goal 
He stayed calm	
He stayed in bed
She went pale	
She went to work
He drives me mad	
He drives me to the airport
A bicycle will get you fit	 A bicycle will get you to work
By contrast, adjuncts are not determined by any particular type of verb. Suddenly, 
for instance, can be used with intransitive verbs like disappear and transitive verbs like 
carry. Moreover, adjuncts differ from subjects and objects in that there is no limit to the 
number of adjuncts that can be included in a clause.
4.2.2  Position
Objects occur immediately after the verb, with the indirect object before the direct 
object when both are present (The bomb killed a policeman (Od); He sent me (Oi) an 
email (Od)). Complements also occur after the verb or after an object. Adjuncts 
occupy different positions according to type, and are often moveable within the 
clause.
4.2.3  Ability to become the subject
Objects can normally become the subject in a passive clause, since the system of 
voice allows different semantic roles to be associated with Subject and Object func­
tions (The bomb killed the policeman/The policeman was killed by the bomb; I sent her an 
email/She was sent an email ).
However, passivisation with ‘promotion’ to subject is not a watertight criterion 
for the identification of object functions. It can be too exclusive and too inclusive. 
Passivisation excludes from object status NGs following verbs such as fit, which oth­
erwise fulfil the criteria for objects (6.1.1).
Conversely, passivisation can promote to subject NGs that are not objects. Such 
is the case in the well-known example This bed was slept in by Queen Victoria, derived 
from the active Queen Victoria slept in this bed, in which this bed is part of a prepositional 
phrase (PP) functioning as a locative Complement, not as an object. A prepositional 
phrase has within it a nominal group, however, which increasingly in present-day 
English is able to become subject in a corresponding passive clause. Examples of this 
kind, such as The flowerbeds have been trampled on occur when the subject referent is 

3 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
visibly affected by the action, as is the case of the flowerbeds, or acquires some impor­
tance, as in the case of the bed slept in by Queen Victoria.
4.2.4  Realisations of clausal elements
As participants, Objects, like the Subject, are typically realised by NGs and answer 
questions with who, what or which, as in What did they carry? in response to example 3 
in 4.1.2. 
Complements of the Subject or Object can be realised by adjectives such as useful 
(7a and 7b) or by an NG (a student) (8a and 8b). 
Circumstantial Adjuncts are realised by PPs (drive on the left) or AdvGs (drive 
slowly). They generally answer questions with where, when, how, why? as in Where does 
he work? How did it happen? 
These are the typical options. We must be aware, however, that with the excep­
tion of the Predicator, there is no one-to-one correspondence between class of unit 
and syntactic function in English. While the Predicator is always realised by a ver­
bal group, the other functions display a considerable range of possible realisations. 
The versatility of the language is such that almost any group or clause can realise 
these functions and that each function can be realised by different classes of unit.
In the following pages, the realisations are arranged in order of typicality. The more 
exact word prototypical is sometimes used, for something that shows most of the 
characteristics of its type, and is therefore a good example of the type or function, and 
non-prototypical for something that is a less good example. For instance, a nominal 
group is a prototypical realisation of the Subject function, while a prepositional phrase 
is non-prototypical in subject function.
4.3  BASIC SYNTACTIC STRUCTURES OF THE CLAUSE
Clausal elements or functions enter into varied relationships with each other to express 
different types of proposition concerning different states of affairs. These are exempli­
fied as follows, and are treated further in Chapter 3.

Clause elements such as Subject and Predicator are capitalised when first intro­
duced. Later mentions are usually in lower case, with the exception of Complement 
as a clause element, which is always capitalised, in order to distinguish it from the 
complement of a noun, adjective or preposition.

SUBJECT AND PREDICATOR	
UNIT 5 
SUMMARY
1	
The Subject is the syntactic function identified by the features of position, 
concord, pronominalisation and reflection in question tags. Semantically, 
almost all participant roles can be associated with the subject. Cognitively, 
it is that element which has the highest claim to function as Topic in a spe­
cific clause in context. Syntactically, it is typically realised by a NG, but 
can also be realised by a wide variety of groups and clauses.
2 	 The Predicator is the syntactic function that determines the number and type 
of Objects and Complements in a clause. It is identified syntactically by 
position and concord. It is associated with a number of semantic domains.
5.1.  THE SUBJECT (S)
5.1.1  Semantic, cognitive and syntactic features
A  Semantic and cognitive features
The Subject is that functional category of the clause of which something is predicated. It 
represents the primary participant in the clause and has the highest claim to the cogni­
tive status of Topic that is who or what the clausal message is primarily about (→ 28.4).
With voluntary verbs of action, the subject fulfils the role of Agent, the one that initi­
ates or carries out an action. If there is an Agent in the event expressed by such a verb, 
that element will be the subject.
However, the subject can be associated with almost every other semantic role 
(→ Chapter 5), such as:
Jones kicked the ball into the net. (Agent)
The ball was kicked into the net. (Affected in a passive clause)
Lightning struck the oak tree. (Force)
His secretary has been given too much work. (Recipient in a passive clause.) 

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
4 1
B  Syntactic features
The Subject must be present in declarative and interrogative clauses but is not required 
in the imperative: 
Fasten your seat belts! (Normally no subject in imperative clauses.)
(a)	 It is that element which is picked up in a question-tag (→ 14.8) and referred to 
anaphorically by a pronoun:
Your brother is a journalist, isn’t he?
(b)	 It is in the subjective case if a pronoun is used – I, he, she, we and they in con­
trast to the objective forms for Objects: me, him, her, us and them. You and it are 
invariant: 
We all left early.
(c)	 Possessive pronouns and genitive nouns can function as subject: 
Yours was rather difficult to read.
Jennifer’s got lost in the post/ mail (BrE vs AmE).
(d)	 It is placed before the finite verb in declarative clauses, and in wh-interrogative 
clauses where the wh- element is subject:
Susie is staying with us.
Who was the last to leave? (Who is subject)
(e)	 It is placed after the finite operator (the first element of the VG) in yes/no inter­
rogative clauses, and in wh-interrogative clauses where the wh- element is not 
subject (→ 14.1):
Are you pleased with the result? 
What film did you see last night? (What film is Object) 
When is Silvia coming back? (When is Adjunct)
(f)	 It determines the concord of number (singular or plural) and person (he/she/it). 
Concord is manifested only in those verb forms that show inflectional contrast: 
The librarian /he/she has checked the book. 
The librarians/ you / we / they have checked the book.
Where is my credit card? Where are my credit cards? 
(g)	 It determines the present and past tense of the verb be:
Our next concert is on Thursday, and the last one was in April.

4 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
(h)	 It determines number, person and gender concord with the Complement of the 
Subject and with reflexive pronouns at Cs, Oi and Od: 
Jean and Bill are my friends. (Cs) 
She cut herself (Od) on a piece of broken glass. 
Why don’t you give yourself (Oi) a treat?
(i)	 In discourse, when two or more conjoined clauses have the same subject, all 
but the first are regularly ellipted:
He came in, sat down and opened his lap-top.
(j)	 When the subject is realised by a collective noun, concord depends on how the 
referent is visualised by the speaker:
The committee is sitting late. (sing. seen as a whole. AmE prefers this option)
The committee have decided to award extra grants. (plur. seen as a number of 
members. BrE uses either.)
5.1.2  Realisations of the Subject
There are two main types of unit that can fulfil Subject function: nominal groups and 
clauses. 
A  Nominal Groups – That man is crazy
Nominal groups are the most typical realisation of subject, as they refer basically 
to persons and things. They can range from simple heads (→ 45.3.1) to the full 
complexity of NG structures (50.1):
Cocaine can damage the heart as well as the brain.
The precise number of heart attacks from using cocaine is not known.
It is alarming.
Pronouns (2.4.3; 45.7.1) account for a high percentage of subjects in the spoken 
language, as can be seen in the following recorded dialogue:
B.	 So what’s new, Ann?
C.	 Well I don’t know if anything’s terribly new at all really or is it all much the same?
B.	 You still living with Deb?
C.	 No, she moved out at the end of April.
B.	 Oh.

A Corpus of English Conversation)

4 3
B  Finite and Non-finite clauses (→ 3.6.3)
Clauses can realise every element or function of clause structure except the predicator.
Cognitively, this means that we as speakers encode, as the main elements of clauses, 
not only persons and things but facts, abstractions and situations. 
(a)	 Finite clauses: The main types of embedded finite clause have been outlined 
in 2.4.1 C and in 3.7.3, 31.3. They are that-clauses and wh-clauses; the latter 
include nominal relative clauses. These are illustrated below: 
	
That-clauses at subject represent an attitude, usually that of the writer.
That we’ve gotten to this point is astonishing to me. (AmE)  (The Guardian) 
That he failed his driving test surprised everybody.  (that-clause)
	
Wh- interrogatives encode indirect questions.
Why the library was closed for months was not explained.  (wh-interrogative)
What he said shocked me.  (wh-nominal relative clause)
	
They do not take the inversion characteristic of ordinary interrogatives, however: 
*Why was the library closed for months was not explained is not acceptable. 
(b)	 Non-finite clauses are commonly of the -ing type or the to-inf type. The 
latter can be introduced by a wh-word. A less commonly used type is the bare 
infinitive:
To take such a risk was rather foolish  (to-inf clause) 
Having to go back for the tickets was a nuisance.  (-ing clause)
Sign the petition was what we did.  (bare inf clause)
(c)	 To-infinitive and -ing clause with own subject
	
To-infinitive and –ing clauses at subject can have their own subject; bare inf clauses 
cannot. A to-inf clause with its own subject is introduced by for
For everyone to escape was impossible.  For + S + to-inf.
Sam’s/Sam/His/Him forgetting the tickets was unfortunate.  S + ing-cl.
The pronominal subject of an –ing clause may be in the genitive or the objective 
case, as in the examples above. The objective form is the less formal. With short NGs 
such as proper names the ‘s genitive can be used, and is preferred when it is initial in 
the sentence. Many speakers , however, would prefer to avoid both genitive and objec­
tive forms, if another option is available. This could be anticipatory it + a that-clause: 
It was unfortunate that Sam forgot the tickets.

4 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
C  Anticipatory it + end-placed subject
That- clauses at subject tend to sound formal in English and are reserved for formal 
speech and writing. They are more acceptable if they are preceded by ‘the fact’, which 
makes them complement to an NG (the fact) functioning as subject. Even so, they can 
be awkward and rather top-heavy:
The fact that he failed his driving test surprised everyone.
A ‘lighter’ alternative, anticipatory it, is now generally preferred, particularly in spoken 
English, both BrE and AmE. It is much easier to handle and the pronoun it is the light­
est possible subject filler. The that-clause or to- inf clause are then placed at the end of 
the sentence. This is known as ‘extraposition’ with the that- clause as ‘extraposed 
subject’. It also expresses an attitude.

that he failed his driving test
S	
P	
Cs	
S
It

impossible	
for everyone to escape
Figure 2.5  Anticipatory ‘it’ as stand-in for displaced Subject.
In this way, a long and heavy subject is placed at the end, in accordance with the infor­
mational and stylistic principle of ‘end-weight’ (→ 30.3.2). 
For clauses such as ‘It is (high) time (that) he stopped fooling around’ (→ 30.5). 
Though apparently extraposed, there is no corresponding pattern with the clause in 
initial position (*That he stopped fooling around is high time.) Extraposition is then 
said to be obligatory. 
Likewise, the clause following it + the verbs seem, appear, happen, turn out is obliga­
torily extraposed:
It turns out you were right after all. (* That you were right after all turns out)
It seems the driver lost control. (*That the driver lost control seems)
D  Minor realisations: dummy it; unstressed there
D1  Dummy it – It’s hot
This is a non-referential or semantically empty use of it , which occurs in expressions 
of time, weather etc.
It’s nearly three o’clock. It’s raining. It’s a long way from here to London.
Syntactically, English requires the presence of a subject even in such situations, in 
order to distinguish grammatically between declaratives and interrogatives. Is it rain­
ing? How far is it from here to London? 

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
4 5
D2  Unstressed there – There’s plenty of time
Unstressed there (→ 25.3, 30.4) fulfils several of the syntactic criteria for subject: posi­
tion, inversion with auxiliaries and repetition in tag phrases; but unlike normal subjects, 
it cannot be replaced by a pronoun. Concord, when made, is with the following NG: 
There was only one letter delivered today, wasn’t there?
There were only two letters delivered yesterday, weren’t there?
Concord is made in writing, but not always in informal spoken English with the present 
tense of be, and is never made when the NG is a series of proper names:
How many are coming? Well, there’s Andrew and Silvia, and Jo and Pete. 
*There are Andrew and Silvia, and Jo and Pete.
Because of the lack of concord and pronominalisation, unstressed there can be consid­
ered as a subject ‘place-holder’ or ‘syntactic filler’, rather than a full subject, since the 
unit following is clearly the notional subject. For its function as a presentative device 
(→ 30.4).
D3  Adjectival NG head.
The AdjG as such does not function as subject. However, certain adjectives, preceded 
by the definite article to denote (a) human characteristics or condition such as the brave 
and the beautiful, the fast and the furious, the poor, the rich, the good, the bad, the handi­
capped, the wounded, the computer-savvy, the I-Pad fixated or (b) abstractions such as the 
impossible, the supernatural are quite common:
The handicapped are given special facilities in public places. 
The novel plunges the reader into a universe in which the comic, the tragic, the real 
and the imagined dissolve into one another.
5.2  THE PREDICATOR (P)
The Predicator is the clause element present in all major types of clause, including the 
imperative (in which the subject is not usually present in English).
The predicator is the clause function that largely determines the remaining struc­
ture of the clause, by virtue of being intransitive, transitive or copular.
As seen in 4.1, the predicator may constitute the whole of the predicate, as in The 
plane landed, or part of it, as in The plane landed on the runway. It:
••
is identified by position in relation to the subject.
••
is realised by finite lexical (e.g. waits), primary (was) and non-finite (waiting)verbs.
••
Finiteness is often carried by an auxiliary verb – such as is, was – to specify 
tense (past/present) and voice (be + -en), and is then followed by the predicator 
(is making, was made). For the Finite–Subject relation in interrogative structures 
→ Chapter 5.

4 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Semantically, the predicator encodes the following main types of ‘process’:
••
material processes of ‘doing’ with verbs such as make, catch, go;
••
mental processes of ‘experiencing’, with cognitive verbs of perception (e.g. see), 
cognition (know), affectivity (like) and desideration (hope); 
••
relational processes of ‘being’ with verbs such as be and belong. 
These, and certain subsidiary types, are discussed in Chapter 4. The following text 
illustrates realisations of the Predicator:
It [the Valley of the Kings] lies about six hundred kilometres south of Cairo, the 
present-day capital of Egypt, near the Nile.1 Across the river is the city of Luxor,2 once 
called Thebes and one of the greatest capitals of the ancient world.3 This dusty, dried-
up river valley is the most magnificent burial ground in the world.4 During the second 
millennium B.C., Egyptian workers quarried a series of tombs beneath this valley,5 
decorating them with mysterious predictions of the underworld6 and filling them with 
treasures.7 There, with infinite care and artistry, they laid out the mummified and 
bejewelled bodies of their rulers8 and surrounded them with their belongings,9 making 
the valley one of the greatest sacred sites in history.10

DIRECT, INDIRECT AND	
UNIT 6
PREPOSITIONAL OBJECTS	
SUMMARY
1	
The Direct Object (Od) and Indirect Object (Oi) are central syntactic func­
tions which encode participants in transitive clauses, and are identified 
by the following features:
2 	 Position. In clauses with one Object, The Direct Object follows the verb 
(She wanted to borrow a video). When there are two Objects, the Direct 
Object follows the Indirect Object (So I lent her (Oi) one (Od)).
3 	 Paraphrase. The Oi and Od usually have alternative prepositional para­
phrases, with the status of a Prepositional Complement.
4 	 Pronominalisation. Since objects encode participants, they are realised by 
objective case pronouns (me, him, her, us, them).
5 	 ‘Promotion’ to subject in a passive clause. Both direct and indirect objects 
usually have the potential of being subject in a corresponding passive 
clause (He sent them a fax. The fax (S) was sent. They (S) were sent a fax).
6 	 Semantic roles. The indirect object is associated with the Recipient and 
Beneficiary roles, the direct object with the Affected, among others.
7 	 Realisations. Both Objects are realised typically by Nominal Groups 
expressing entities; less typically by other classes of unit.
6.1  THE DIRECT OBJECT (Od)
6.1.1  Syntactic and semantic features
After the subject and the predicator, the direct object is the most central of all 
clause constituents. It is characterised by the following features:

4 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
1	
It occurs only in transitive clauses with transitive verbs such as hit, buy, send. It is 
placed immediately after the predicator, as in (a), but follows an indirect object, 
if there is one as in (b):
(a)	 I have sent the invitations (Od).
(b)	 I have sent everyone (Oi) an invitation (Od).
2	
It is typically realised by a NG, as in (a) but may also be realised by clauses, as 
in (b):
(a)	 I saw the burglar (NG)
(b)	 I saw what he did (nominal cl.)
3	
It can generally be ‘promoted’ to become subject in a corresponding passive 
clause: 
The invitations (S) have been sent. (corresponding to the Od in I have sent the 
invitations)
4	
Direct objects can be tested for by questions beginning with Who(m)? What? 
Which?: How much/ many? and by wh-clefts.
What did you send?
What I sent were the invitations  (wh-cleft)
5	
Semantically, a prototypical direct object occurs in a high-transitivity situation 
(→ 21.4) – that is, in a process of ‘doing’ in which the referent’s state or location is 
affected in some way, as in the first example below.
6	
However the Od is associated with a wide variety of semantic roles in which 
‘affectedness’ is not a feature, and with many types of verbs (→ Chapter 5), some 
of which are illustrated in the following examples:
He headed the ball into the net. (Affected)
The burglars used an acetylene lamp to break open the safe. (Instrument)
I felt a sudden pain in my arm. (Phenomenon: i.e. that which is experienced)
He gave the door a push. (Range: i.e. the nominalised extension of the verb; → 20.2)
He swam the Channel. (Affected locative)
7	
The highly non-prototypical Range Ods (26.2) include have a rest/smoke/drink; 
take a sip/nap, give a kick/nudge, do a dance, and many others. The NG in these 
cases is a deverbal noun (i.e. derived from a verb) which follows a verb that is 
‘light’ in semantic content such as have. Such combinations are very common.
	
  The Channel in swim the Channel is a direct object, whereas in swim across the 
Channel it is the NG complement of a prepositional phrase functioning as Adjunct. 
The difference is that the Od version is more integrated within the clause, and per­
haps for this reason appears to present the event as more of an achievement. The 
same difference is present in climb Everest and ride a horse vs climb up Everest and 

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
4 9
ride on a horse, respectively. The achievement is clearly completed in the former 
case, but leaves open the possibility of incompletion in the latter.
6.1.2  Realisations of the Direct Object
The Direct Object can be realised by groups and by clauses. There are five main 
possibilities:
A.  Nominal Group – We hired a caravan
The typical realisation of the Direct Object function is the nominal group, ranging 
from a pronoun 1 or proper name to full NGs 2. As new entities are often introduced 
into the discourse in object position, the principle of end-weight (30.3.2) can make 
for the frequent occurrence of longer and more complex NGs at Direct Object in cer­
tain registers as in 3:
1 	
I don’t understand it.
2 	
Have you read that new novel I lent you?
3 	
Forest fires are threatening the world’s remaining population of orang-utangs.
A small number of common verbs take non-typical direct objects. They include 
verbs such as have (They have two cars), cost (it cost ten pounds), lack (She lacks 
confidence), resemble (She resembles her elder sister), fit (Do these shoes fit you?), 
suit (That colour doesn’t suit me), weigh (The suitcase weighs twenty kilos), contain 
(That box contains explosives) and measure (It measures two metres by three.) All 
these answer questions with What? Who? How much/how many?, as is usual with 
Ods. These verbs don’t passivise, but their Ods pass the wh-cleft test: What she lacks 
is confidence.
B.  Anticipatory it – I find it strange that she left
The semantically empty pronoun it is necessary as an ‘anticipatory Direct Object’ in 
SPOdCo structures in which the Od is realised by a finite or non-finite clause:
S
P
(Od)
Co
Od
You
must think
It
strange
that he refuses to come. 
She
might consider
it
insulting
for you to leave now.
He
finds
it
flattering
having so many fans.
Figure 2.6  Anticipatory ‘it’ as Object + clause as Object.
C. Finite clause – You know (that) I’m right
The two types of finite clause found at subject can also function as a less typical 
Direct Object: nominal that-clauses, that often being omitted in informal styles, 
and wh-clauses (→ Chapter 3).

5 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
They fear that there may be no survivors. (nominal that-clause) 
No-one knows where he lives. (wh-clause)
You can eat whatever you like. (wh-nominal clause)
Both that-clauses and wh-clauses at Od can sometimes become subject in a passive 
clause and then extraposed:
It is feared that there may be no survivors. (extraposed that-cl.) 
It is not known where he lives.
However, passivisation is not a unique criterion for assigning object status. A 
more reliable test is the wh-cleft paraphrase, as in 6.1.1. We can apply this to the fol­
lowing example with wonder, which rejects passivisation but fulfils the wh-cleft test: 
I wonder whether they know the truth.
*Whether they know the truth is wondered.
What I wonder is whether they know the truth. 
D.  Non-finite clause – They enjoy travelling by train
Non-finite clauses realising Direct Object function are of two types: infinitive clauses 
with or without to, and -ing clauses.
Many Londoners prefer to travel by train.
Many Londoners prefer travelling by train. 
We analyse such clauses as embedded at Od on the strength of the following criteria:
The non-finite clause can be replaced by a NG (prefer the train) or by it/that 
(prefer it/that).
The non-finite clause can be made the focus of a wh-cleft sentence (What 
many Londoners prefer is to travel/travelling by train).
However, not all non-finites pass these tests. We do not analyse as embedded 
clauses chain-like structures (catenatives) as in He failed to appear, I tried to speak 
(→ 39.2). Although superficially similar, they do not fulfil the above criteria. Taking 
He failed to appear, we can’t say *He failed it, nor make a corresponding cleft *What 
he failed was to appear. As a full lexical verb, as in fail the exam, fail does of course fulfil 
these criteria.
Many embedded clauses at direct object, as with subject → 5.1.2B c, occur with 
an explicit subject of their own; otherwise, the implicit subject is the same as that 
of the main clause: 
(a)	 to-infinitive clause – 
The villagers want to leave immediately.  (implicit subject [they])
The villagers want the soldiers/them to leave immediately.  (explicit subject the 
soldiers)

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
5 1
(b)	 -ing clause subject – (with genitive or objective case)
Do you mind waiting a few minutes?  (with implicit subject)
Do you mind my/me waiting a few minutes?  (with explicit subject in objective or 
possessive case) → 5.1.2 B c 
(c)	 to-infinitive or -ing clause – 
He hates telling lies.  (implicit subject)
He hates people telling lies.  (explicit subject)
He hates for people to tell lies.  (for + explicit subject + to-inf ) (AmE)
Again, non-finite clauses are very non-prototypical direct objects. They represent 
situations, not entities, and do not easily passivise. However, many can become the 
focus in a wh-cleft: What he hates is people telling lies/for people to tell lies.
E.  Prepositional Phrase – The boss prefers before 10 for the meeting
Prepositional phrases of time or place can marginally realise direct object and subject: 
Just before breakfast is not a good time.
6.2  THE INDIRECT OBJECT (Oi)
6.2.1  Syntactic and semantic features
The indirect object occurs only with verbs which can take two objects such as give, 
send. Its position in clause structure is between the verb and the direct object: I 
sent them a fax. It:
••
is typically realised by a NG, but occasionally by a wh-nominal clause. As a 
pronoun, it is in the objective case.
••
is associated with two semantic roles, Recipient (the one who receives the 
goods or information), and the Beneficiary or ‘intended recipient’. The differ­
ences between the two are reflected in the syntax. 
Recipient Oi
Beneficiary Oi
She has lent me a few CDs.
I’ll buy you a drink. 
The doctor gave the injured man oxygen.
He got us the tickets.
Sammy Karanja is teaching the students maths.
She left him a note.
Figure 2.7  Recipient as Indirect Object and Beneficiary as Indirect Object.

5 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
In passive counterparts the Recipient Oi corresponds to the subject. By con­
trast, most Beneficiary Objects do not easily become subject in a passive clause, 
although this restriction is not absolute, at least for some speakers:
Recipient as Subject in passive clause
Beneficiary as Subject
I have been lent a few CDs.
*You’ll be bought a drink.
The injured man was given oxygen.
*We were got the tickets.
The students are being taught maths by Sammy Karanja.
He was left a note.
Figure 2.8  Recipient as Subject and Beneficiary as Subject.
••
Both Recipient and Beneficiary Oi have an optional prepositional paraphrase, 
which functions as a PC or PO (→ 6.3). For the Recipient, the preposition is 
to, for the Beneficiary it is for. The prepositional form is often used to bring the 
Oi into focus, particularly when it is longer than the Od:
The doctor gave oxygen to the injured man. 	
I’ll buy drinks for you all.
She lent a few CDs to her next-door neighbour.	 He got the tickets for us all.
He is teaching maths to the first-year students.	
She left a note for her husband. 
••
The Oi can generally be left unexpressed without affecting the grammaticality 
of the clause:
The doctor gave oxygen.	
I’ll buy the drinks.
He doesn’t like lending his CDs.	
He got the tickets.
Sammy Karanja is teaching maths.	 She left a note.
••
With some verbs (show, tell, teach, etc.) the Od may be unexpressed:
Who told you (the answer)?
Perhaps you could show me (how to do it).
He’s teaching immigrant children (maths).
6.2.2  Realisations of the Indirect Object
Both Recipient and Beneficiary Indirect Objects are typically realised by NGs, and 
less typically by wh-nominal relative clauses, which occur more usually as a prepo­

6.3  PREPOSITIONAL VERBS AND THE PREPOSITIONAL 
COMPLEMENT (PC) or OBJECT(PO)
Many common verbs in English take a specific preposition. They are called preposi­
tional verbs. The preposition + the following NG are often analysed as the Prepositional 
Complement (PC). Alternatively, the verb and preposition are seen as a whole and the 
following NG as the Object mediated by a preposition (PO). Examples are: 
I looked after their cat.
You can rely on Jane in an emergency. 
These examples have in common the following characteristics:
••
The NG following the preposition encodes a participant which may function in the 
clause structure.
••
The preposition is associated with a particular verb, often called a prepositional 
verb. Idiomatic prepositional verbs have separate lexical entries in dictionaries.
••
Without the preposition, the clause would either be ungrammatical (*look their 
cat, *count Jane) or, in some cases, have a different meaning altogether, as in see 
to the baggage (attend to it) as opposed to see the baggage.
••
The preposition can’t be replaced by another preposition without changing the 
meaning (look after the cat, look for the cat, look at the cat).
6.3.1  Types of verb + preposition combinations
There are three main types of prepositional verb, as illustrated by the previous 
examples.
Type A (look + after)
This combination functions as an idiomatic semantic unit in which the verb + the 
preposition together have a different meaning from their separate words. ‘Look after’ 
has nothing to do with looking, nor with the usual meaning of ‘after’ in relation to 
space or time. Other verbs of this type are exemplified here: 
I came across some old photos (find)	
She takes after her mother (resemble)
How did you come by that job (obtain)	 I ran into an old friend (met by chance).
Sandy has come into a fortune (inherit) 	 We can’t do without water (must have)
Type B (rely + on)
This is a less idiomatic combination whose meaning is sometimes, though not always, 
transparent. Verbs in this group – account for (explain), refer to, tamper with (interfere 
with), deal with – are not used without their specific preposition:
How do you account for the lack of interest in the European elections?
Someone has been tampering with the scanner.

5 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Type C (apply + for, approve+ of) 
The verb + preposition represents a special use, usually with a distinctive meaning, 
of a verb which otherwise can function without the preposition (for example, keep 
to the plan). Other verbs include look (at), believe (in), count (on), hear (of), wait (for), hope 
(for), arrange (for), swear (by):
look at the sky	
glance at the clock
laugh at the joke	
bank on winning the race
wait for the bus 	
hope for a rise in salary
6.3.2  Stranding the preposition
When the preposition stays close to the verb as in ‘the food they can’t do without’ we 
say that i is stranded, that is, displaced from its position in a PC. The verb and the 
preposition stay together, with the stress usually on the verb. Stranding of preposi­
tions occurs in several constructions, one of which is the relative clause.
Relative clauses have two alternatives, one in which the preposition is fronted to the 
position before its complement, as in 2a and 2b; the other is stranded, that is, separated 
from its complement which, as in 3a and 3b in the examples below:
1a We listened to some music.	
1b I looked after their cat.
2a The music [to which we listened ]	
2b *The cat [after which I looked] 
3a The music [which we listened to]	
3b The cat [which I looked after]
Comparing the behaviour of listen +to with that of look+after, we can see that listen +to 
admits both fronting, as in 2a and stranding, as in 3a. By contrast, look + after admits 
only stranding, as in 3b. The fronted type, as in 2b, is ungrammatical. 
Many prepositional verbs, in particular those of Types 2 and 3, admit both the 
fronted and the stranded variants. A considerable number of idiomatic prepositional 
verbs, however, admit only stranding. Type 1 verbs, the most idiomatic, are of this 
kind. 
Verbs of both types are illustrated in the following block:
Non-stranded and stranded
Stranded only
The transport on which they rely
The transport they rely on
The matter I looked into *The matter into which I 
looked
The friends for whom we care
The friends we care for
The house they broke into *The house into which 
they broke 
Although, grammatically, stranding is the marked form, it has become the nor­
mal, unmarked form used in conversation. The non-stranded form, when it occurs, is 
reserved for formal contexts and genres such as academic prose. But even in highly for­
mal situations, the stranded form is usually preferred in the spoken language, both BrE 
and AmE, as the following quotation illustrates. The speaker is the then US Secretary 
of State, Colin Powell, addressing the United Nations Council in February 2003: 

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
5 5
What we need is not more inspections. What we need is not more immediate access. 
What we need is immediate full unconditional cooperation by Irak. To this day we have 
not seen the level of cooperation that was expected, looked for, hoped for.
6.3.3  The prepositional passive
The previous quotation also illustrates stranding in the prepositional passive (was 
looked for, hoped for). In many combinations, although not in all, the NG comple­
ment of a PP can become subject in a passive clause. The preposition is obligatorily 
stranded: 
My cat was looked after 	
*After my cat was looked
Jane can be relied on 	
*On Jane can be relied
6.3.4  Realisations of the Prepositional Object
Experientially, the unit following the preposition is in many cases seen as a participant 
in the situation, for reasons of affectiveness among others previously discussed. In 
such cases idiomatic combination such as run over are interpreted as transitive and the 
following NG as an Object mediated by a preposition (PO), as in 1.
1	
He ran over a rabbit on a country road last night. (NG)
2	
I strongly object to what you are insinuating. (nominal clause) 
3	
He believes in getting things done quickly. (-ing cl.)
4	
She certainly likes being waited on, doesn’t she?
Passivisation and what/who? questions are usually reliable probes for Objects:
What (animal) was run over?
NGs are the typical realisations of the P O , but nominal clauses and non-finite -ing 
clauses also occur, and can be probed likewise:
What I strongly object to is what you are insinuating.
What he believes in is getting things done quickly.
Conversely, fronting the whole prepositional phrase is not acceptable in 1:
*Over what did he run?
It is possible though somewhat stilted in 2 and 3:
To what do you object? 
In what does he believe?

5 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
By contrast, 4, meaning ‘serve’, is easily passivised and is in current use.
Some wh- questions admit only the discontinuous structure (stranding):
What’s the weather like?	
[*Like what is the weather?]
What have you come for?	 [*For what have you come?]
Short questions in response to statements are very common in English:
We are leaving tomorrow.	
Where from?
I have to speak to your headmaster?	 What about?
Certain PPs which constitute fixed phrases are very rarely discontinuous:
To what extent do they disagree?	
[*What extent do they disagree to? ] 
In which respect do you think I am wrong?	
[*Which respect do you think I am 
wrong in?]
••
Two-word or three-word prepositions can be discontinuous, though perhaps less 
often than simple prepositions:
His death was due to natural causes.	 What was his death due to?
There are certain regulations which 	 There are certain regulations which these 
are in conflict with these proposals 	
proposals are in conflict with.
It is clear that verbs which control prepositions do not constitute a homogeneous 
class. There are various degrees of integration, ranging from the relatively loosely
integrated such as smile (at) and wait (for), where the verb can function without a prepo­
sition, to those which bond with the preposition to form a new lexical unit (look after, 
take to). The latter are given separate entries in dictionaries and, in those dictionaries 
which provide grammatical information, are given different analyses. The PP following 
Type 3 verbs such as smile and wait is often classified as Prepositional Complement 
(PC). Cognitive factors of attention and salience intervene to allow some of the NGs in 
circumstantial PPs to become subjects, as in this house hasn’t been lived in.
According to use in context, one analysis may be more suitable than another. 
6.4  PHRASAL VERBS: THE VERB + PARTICLE COMBINATION
Phrasal verbs consist of a lexical verb + an adverbial ‘particle’ (p). They can be intran­
sitive (without an Object: get up) or transitive (taking a Direct Object: switch it off ).
Phrasal prepositional verbs consist of a lexical verb + a particle + a preposition (put 
up with). They function like idiomatic prepositional verbs.
6.4.1  Syntactic features
Phrasal verbs are combinations of a lexical verb and an adverbial particle (p) (get 
up, switch on/off, take back, sit down). They may be intransitive, with no object, as in 
1 or transitive (with a direct object) as in 2 and 3:

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
5 7
1 	
What time do you usually get up in the morning?
2a	 She switched off the light.  2b	
She switched the light off.
3 	
She switched it off.
With a noun as Object, the particle in most cases may either precede or follow the 
object as in 2. But if the Object is a pronoun, the particle is placed after it, as in 3.
The motivation for this choice has to do with the distribution of information. We 
focus on the new information by placing it last. So in 2a the new information is the 
light; while in 2b and 3 it is the switching off (see Chapter 6). Pronouns do not usually 
represent new information and are placed before the particle.
This choice of emphasising either the noun or the particle is not possible with a 
synonymous one-word verb. Compare:
They cancelled the wedding.	
(focus on wedding)
They called off the wedding.	
(focus on wedding)
They called the wedding off.	
(focus on off)
Some verb + particle combinations can be used both transitively and intransitively, e.g. blow 
up (= explode), break down (= reduce to pieces). In some cases the transitive and intransi­
tive clauses form an ergative pair (→ 15.1) with a causative meaning in the transitive:
Terrorists have blown up the power station.  (transitive)
The power station has blown up.  (intransitive)
while in others the meaning is related by metaphorical extension:
They broke down the door to rescue the child.  (transitive)
Her health broke down under the strain.  (intransitive)
The car has broken down.  (= stop working) (intransitive)
6.4.2  Differences between phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs
We explain here differences of position, stress and adverb insertion in the clause, 
illustrating them with the phrasal verb break up and the prepositional verb break 
with, as in He broke up the party (phrasal verb) and He broke with his girl-friend (prepo­
sitional verb).
A pronoun follows a preposition but precedes the particle of a phrasal verb (as 
elsewhere, the asterisk indicates an ungrammatical sequence):
He broke with her.	
He broke it up.
*He broke her with.  *He broke up it.
The particle in phrasal verbs is stressed, especially when in final position in the clause, 
whereas a preposition is normally unstressed. In prepositional verbs the stress nor­
mally falls on the verb (→ 29.2) (capitals indicate the stressed syllable):
He broke it UP.	
He has BROken with her.
Which party did he break UP?	 Which girl has he BROken with?

5 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
As seen in 6.3.2. Type B, an adverb can sometimes be placed between a verb and 
its following preposition. Phrasal verbs do not normally admit an adverb between 
the verb and the particle:
*He broke completely up the party.  He broke completely with his girl-friend.
In idiomatic phrasal verbs the particle is usually analysed as part of the verb (peter 
out. There is no separate verb ‘peter’) In ‘free’ combinations in which the adverb 
particle is directional, this is analysed as Complement, as in The rain came down. 
The adverbial particle can be fronted (Down came the rain) for rhetorical purposes, 
and this mobility is a feature of Complements and Adjuncts. With non-directional 
meanings, the adverbial particle is inseparable from the verb, and can’t be fronted 
(The car broke down, *Down broke the car).
The semantics of phrasal verbs is described in Chapter 8.
6.4.3  Phrasal-prepositional verbs
Phrasal-prepositional verbs consist of a lexical verb followed by an adverbial particle 
and a preposition, in that order: run up against, do away with. They are particularly 
characteristic of informal English, and new combinations are constantly being coined. 
Phrasal-prepositional verbs function like prepositional verbs, taking a prepositional 
object or a PC in the clause:
We ran up against difficulties.  (= encounter)
They have done away with free school meals.  (= abolish)
Finally, it is important to realise that many verbs, whether single- or multi-word, can 
be followed by a PP functioning as a circumstantial Locative/Goal Complement in the 
clause, as in They went into the garden. They express meanings of place, direction, time 
or means. They are generally questioned by Where, when or how (Where did they go (to)? 
How did you come? ) as opposed to What? Who? as is usual with Objects.

Furthermore, there is a parallel between intransitive phrasals like walk down and 
single verbs of movement followed by a directional Complement (walk down the stairs). 
In many cases, it is possible to analyse the former as the ellipted version of the 
latter, especially when the situation is known.
These alternatives also allow us to specify direction as Path + Ground or as 
Path alone. (These notions are explained in Unit 40.) Compare: 
He	
walked 	
down the stairs.	
He	
walked

SUBJECT AND OBJECT	
UNIT 7
COMPLEMENTS	
SUMMARY
1	
There are two main types of Complement: that which complements the 
Subject (Cs) and that which complements the Object (Co). The Subject 
Complement completes the predicate after a copular verb by specifying 
an Attribute of the Subject or its identity. No passivisation is possible. The 
Subject Complement can be realised by AdjGs, by definite and indefinite 
NGs, and by clauses.
2	
The Object Complement (Co) completes the predicate with an AdjG or a 
NG following a direct object. The Direct Object, but not the Complement, 
can become subject in a passive clause. The Co is realised by AdjGs, defi­
nite and indefinite NGs and clauses.
3	
When the Cs is a pronoun, use is divided between the subjective and 
the objective case. The Co pronoun is always objective.
7.1  THE COMPLEMENT OF THE SUBJECT (Cs)
7.1.1  Syntactic and semantic features
The Subject Complement is the obligatory constituent which follows a copular verb 
and which cannot be made subject in a passive clause:
Who’s there? It’s me/It’s I.
She became a tennis champion at a very early age.
Feel free to ask questions!
The Subject Complement does not represent a new participant, as an Object does, 
but completes the predicate by adding information about the subject referent. For 
this reason the Subject Complement differs from the Object in that it can be realised 
not only by a nominal group but also by an adjectival group (AdjG), as illustrated 
in the previous examples.

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
6 1
The objective case (me) is now in general use (It’s me) except in the most formal 
registers, in which the subjective form (it’s I) or (I am he/she) are heard, especially 
in AmE.
As well as be and seem, a wide range of verbs can be used to link the subject 
to its Complement; these add meanings of transition (become, get, go, grow, turn) 
and of perception (sound, smell, look) among others, and are discussed in Units 
12 and 17. 
The constituent following such verbs will be considered Subject Complement 
if the verb can be replaced by be and can’t stand alone, without a change of 
meaning: 
I know it sounds stupid, but . . .	 (= is stupid)	 cf. *I know it sounds.
That looks nice.	
(= is nice) 	
cf. *That looks.
More problematic is the constituent following other verbs that could be used intran­
sitively with the same meaning, as in:
Saint Etheldreda was born a Saxon princess. (she was born)
He returned a broken man. (he returned)
He died young. (he died) 
We shall consider such constituents as Complements on the strength of the possible 
paraphrase containing be (When he returned he was a broken man; When he died he was 
young).
There is, typically, number agreement between the subject and its Complement, 
and gender agreement with a reflexive pronoun at complement, as in Janet isn’t herself 
today. There are, however, several common exceptions to number agreement:
Joan and Lionel make a good couple.
My neighbour’s cats are a nuisance/a joy.
Are these socks wool? No, they’re cotton.
The twins are the same height.
Complements of the type a good couple in Joan and Lionel make a good couple are 
explicable on semantic grounds, couple being inherently plural in meaning. Semantic 
criteria may also be invoked to explain the use of a nuisance/a joy in My neighbour’s 
cats are a nuisance/a joy, since abstractions such as these are equally applicable to 
singular or plural subjects.
A third type, exemplified by expressions such as wool, cotton, rather an odd colour, 
the same height/length/shape, etc., can all be paraphrased by a PP with of (of wool, of 
rather an odd colour, of the same height, etc.), which formerly had greater currency. 
They all express qualities of the subject, and in present-day English the NG form 
without a preposition is the more common.
Copular verbs predict meanings of being something, describing or identifying 
the subject referent. The identifying type is typically reversible, the attributive is not: 

6 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
The concert was marvellous.  (attributive)	
*Marvellous was the concert.
The concert was a great success.  (attributive)	
*A great success was the concert. 
The orchestra was the London Philharmonic.	
(The London Philharmonic was
  (identifying)	
  the orchestra.)
When be is followed by an expression of location in space or time (in the garden, 
at 10 o’clock), this Complement is analysed as locative (→ 4.2.1; 9.2). Sometimes a 
circumstantial expression (e.g. out of work) is semantically equivalent to an attributive 
one (e.g. unemployed).
7.1.2  Realisations of the Subject Complement
Attributive subject complements are realised by AdjGs and NGs. Identifying Subject 
Complements can be realised by NGs and by clauses.
(a)  Attributive Complements (S-P-Cs) – She was ambitious
AdjG	
She is twenty-two years old.
NG	
Sam is a very lucky man.
As + NG	 His research was recognised as a great contribution to science.
The Rolling Stones’ concert was acclaimed as the event of the season.
(b)  Identifying Complements (S-P-Cs) – Her name was Bettina
NG	
Sierra Leone is one of the world’s biggest producers of diamonds.
Fin. that-cl.	
Ken’s belief is that things can’t get any worse.
Nominal relative cl.  He has become what he always wanted to be.
Non-fin. bare inf.cl.	
The only thing I did was tell him to go away.
	Non-fin. to-inf. -S	
My advice is to withdraw.
	
+ for + S	
The best plan is for you to go by train.
	Non-fin. -ing cl -S	
What I don’t enjoy is standing in queues.
	
+S 	
What most people prefer is others doing/for others to do 
  the work. 
Note that NGs and AdjGs can occur as attributive or identifying Subject Complements, 
in passive clauses derived from S-P-Od-Co structures: 
You are regarded as a friend of the family.	 (We regard you as a friend of the family) 
The gates were left open all night .	
(Someone left the gates open all night)
Some realisations of Subject Complement are illustrated in the following passage: 
Cyclists are not only healthy1 – they are smart.2 Bike riding is one of 
the most efficient ways of getting about.3 When comparing the energy 
expended with speed and distance covered, even the rustiest two-
wheeler outstrips the hummingbird, the cheetah and the jumbo jet.

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
6 3
There are an estimated 14 million bikes in Britain – with 5 million 
of them gathering dust in garages. A pity, because bicycles are so ver­
satile as transport or for simple pleasure.4
While getting you to work,5 a bicycle also gets you fit.6 For every 
half an hour’s pedalling, a 150lb person burns up 300 calories. The 
heart and back leg muscles are strengthened – all while sitting down. 
Because the bodyweight is supported, cycling is effective exercise.7
7.2  THE COMPLEMENT OF THE OBJECT (Co)
7.2.1  Syntactic and semantic features
The Object Complement is the constituent that completes the predicate when cer­
tain verbs such as find, make and appoint lead us to specify some characteristic of the 
Direct Object. The Co is normally placed immediately after the direct object: 
You (S) are making (P) me (Od) angry (Co).
There is typically number agreement between the Direct Object and the nominal 
group realising the Object Complement, as in: Circumstances (S) have made (P) the 
brothers (Od) enemies (Co). But there are occasional exceptions – expressions of size, 
shape, colour, height, etc. – which are to be explained in the same way as those 
seen in 7.1.1:
You haven’t made the sleeves the same length.
The Object Complement can characterise the direct object by a qualitative attribute 
or by a substantive attribute expressing the name or status of the object referent. 
Police found the suspects unwilling to cooperate.  (qualitative)
They have elected Ken captain of the golf club.  (substantive)
The burglars left the house in a mess.  (circumstantial)
Sometimes a Co realised by a prepositional phrase (The burglars left the house in a 
mess) is similar in meaning to an adjectival complement (The burglars left the house 
untidy). We can distinguish its status as Complement from the superficially similar 
realisation by an optional Adjunct (in five minutes in The burglars left the house in five 
minutes) by the intensive relationship linking the Od and its complement. This can 
be tested by paraphrase with be (The house was in a mess; *The house was in five 
minutes). The two meanings are dependent on the related meanings of leave: ‘leave 
something in a state’ and ‘go away from’, respectively.

6 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
7.2.2  Realisations of the Object Complement
Attributive Object Complements can be realised by:
AdjG	
A sleeping pill will rapidly make you drowsy.
NG	
His friends consider him a genius.
Finite nominal cl.	
Dye your hair whatever colour you like.
Non-finite -en cl.	
The authorities had the demonstrators placed under house arrest.
Nominal Co elements are sometimes introduced by the prepositions as or for, and are 
then analysed as ‘oblique’ Object Complements, though strictly they are PCs. That 
is, the relationship between the NG and the verb is not direct, but mediated by a 
preposition. Some verbs require this; with others such as consider it is optional:
as + NG	
Party members regard him as the best candidate.
for + NG	
Do you take me for a complete idiot?

ADJUNCTS (A)	
UNIT 8
SUMMARY
1 	 Adjuncts (A) are optional elements of a situation expressed by a clause. 
There are three main types according to their function.
2 	 Circumstantial Adjuncts provide information concerning time, place, man­
ner, means etc. These are treated more fully in Unit 20.
3 	 Stance adjuncts provide an attitudinal comment by the speaker on the con­
tent of the clause or sentence. There are three classes of stance adjuncts: 
epistemic, evidential and evaluative.
4 	 Connective adjuncts are not elements of structures, but connectors of struc­
tures. They signal how the speaker intends the semantic connections to 
be made between one part of the discourse and another. In discourse 
studies, many connective adjuncts are analysed as discourse markers.
5 	 Adjuncts are realised by groups and clauses, according to type and 
function.
8.1  SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC FEATURES
In contrast with the more central clausal constituents, which are realised only once 
in a clause it is common to find a number of adjuncts in a single clause. The following 
illustration has five circumstantial adjuncts, which in this clause are all optional: they 
can be omitted without affecting the grammaticality of the clause. The bracketed 
items are adjuncts:
(If at all possible) I’ll see you (tomorrow) (after the show) (outside the main 
entrance.
Adjuncts can be added to any of the basic clause structures:

6 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
SP(A)	
The bells rang all day long.
SPOd (A)	
Tom hired a car at Doncaster.
SPPC(A)	
You must allow for delays in holiday periods.
SPOiOd(A)	
He sends me flowers through Interflora.
SPCs(A)	
The weather is rather unpredictable in these parts.
SPOdCo(A)	
They expected to find themselves up against opposition any day soon. 
Whereas the more central elements of clause structure typically have fixed places 
in the clause, many adjuncts are characterised by their flexibility as regards position: 
Hastily she hid the letter.
She hastily hid the letter.
She hid the letter hastily. 
While the great majority can occur at the end of the clause, they also occur fre­
quently in initial and medial positions, these being determined to a great extent by 
semantic and pragmatic considerations (→ 55.2).
Semantically, adjuncts represent circumstances, specifications and comments of 
many different types which are attendant on the verb or the whole clause. A fur­
ther characteristic of adjuncts is the tendency of different types of meanings to be 
expressed by different adjuncts in a single clause, not as coordinated realisations 
of a single adjunctive element, but as separate, multiple adjuncts:
Surprisingly (stance), she almost (degree) forgot to set the alarm clock last night (time).
8.2  MAIN CLASSES OF ADJUNCTS
Adjuncts (A) are grouped into three main classes according to their function in the 
clause: circumstantial adjuncts (8.2.1), stance adjuncts (8.2.5) and connective 
adjuncts (8.2.7).
A fourth group consists of operator-related adjuncts. Certain single adverbs and 
adverbial groups which can function as adjuncts of usuality (usually), frequency 
(sometimes, never), degree (just), modality (probably) and aspectuality (still, yet, 
already), among others, relate closely to the verb. These tend to be placed near the 
finite operator (We have just finished; she is probably waiting). They are discussed in 
Chapter 11, together with the distribution, position and function of adverbs.
8.2.1  Circumstantial Adjuncts
Circumstantial adjuncts provide experiential details about the action or state 
described by the verb, and answer such questions as where? when? how? why? and 
occasionally what? as in What do you want it for? What did he die of? Of all the types of 
adjunct, the circumstantials are the ones most similar to clause constituents: like sub­
ject and object they may be made the focus of a cleft. So in the example Tom bought 
a new car last month, we may highlight each element except the verb, including the 
adjunct of time. Other types of circumstantial adjunct don’t pass this test, however:

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
6 7
It was last month that Tom bought a new car.  (adjunct)
It was a new car that Tom bought last month.  (object)
It was Tom who bought a new car last month.  (subject)
*It was probably/*usually/*surprisingly/*still that Tom bought a new car 
last month.
8.2.2  Realisations of the Circumstantial Adjunct: summary
Circumstantial adjuncts are realised by a wide variety of units:
1.	 She called me yesterday.	
Adverb
2.	 She called me too late.	
AdvG
3.	 She called me from the office.	
PP
4.	 She called me this morning.	
NG
5.	 She called me while I was out.	
Finite clause
6.	 She called to tell me the news.	
Non-fin. to-inf.cl
7.	 She called me, using her mobile.	
Non-fin.-ing cl.
8.	 She called me, scared out of her wits.	 Non-fin.-en cl.
9.	 Afraid to leave the house, she called me.  Verbless clause
While non-finite -ing, -en and verbless clauses undoubtedly give background informa­
tion, syntactically it is more problematic to analyse them as adjuncts. They are more 
loosely integrated into the clause and can’t be made the focus of a cleft (*It was 
scared out of her wits that she called me) as can other circumstantials, including to-
infinitive clauses (It was to tell me the news that she called me).
Units that are set off from the main clause by a comma or a pause are called 
supplementives (see also Chapter 10 for various types of supplementive). The 
-ing and -en types, as well as verbless clauses such as afraid to leave the house fall 
into this category. Semantically, they may be understood as reduced clauses of 
means or reason with an adjunctive function. Here, Afraid to leave the house not 
only lacks a main verb and a subject but is related to the predicate. (She was afraid 
to leave the house.) Such ‘detached predicatives’ are used in written genres, where 
they economically add information, typically in initial position as part of Theme 
(→ 28.10 and 51.5).
8.2.3  Circumstantials functioning as central clause elements
As explained in 4.1, certain verbs predict a circumstantial element, without which the 
clause is incomplete syntactically and semantically. They then have the status of a 
Complement, and are summarised again here:
••
Location in place or time, after a verb of position such as be, stay, live, lie, etc., 
as in: We live in troubled times, The farm is situated in a valley.
••
Extent in time or place with verbs such as take, as in The journey takes several 
days, or last, as in The performance lasts (for) three hours, in which the preposition 
is optional. In discourse, the time duration may be omitted if it is understood, as in 
Their love didn’t last, meaning ‘didn’t last a long time’.

6 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
••
Direction and Goal after verbs of movement such as go, come or of movement 
+ manner such as fly, as in We flew south (Direction), We flew to New York (Goal).
••
Source in She tiptoed out of the bedroom, We flew from London.
••
Manner with behave, as in, She is behaving rather strangely. Also with one sense of 
the transitive verb treat, as in: They treated the prisoners badly.
8.2.4  Circumstantials and their ordering in discourse
There is a strong tendency to add circumstantial information, even when it is not 
strictly required by syntactic or semantic criteria for a single clause, one reason being 
that it is often crucial to the development of the discourse. So, rather than saying Tom 
disappeared, we might add an optional circumstantial such as among the crowd, into the 
Underground or below the surface of the lake.
Even more clearly, the conditional clause adjunct – as in If you don’t learn, you’re 
not much good as a teacher – is necessary for a full understanding of the speaker’s 
intended meaning. Without it, the message is very different. Conversely, with verbs 
such as leave, arrive and go, Source, Goal and Location adjuncts are omitted if they are 
contextually understood (haven’t they left/arrived/gone yet?). The semantic classifica­
tion of circumstantial elements is described in Unit 20.
When a number of circumstantials cluster at the end of a clause, they tend to be 
placed in certain semantic orderings, such as Source-Extent-Path-Goal. This is partly 
illustrated in this slightly adapted sentence from a report. We can see that ‘Source’ does 
not figure, while ‘Purpose’ does. Manner of movement is realised by the verb.
I slithered
a few yards
down the steep bank
to the stream
for a wash
(Manner)
Extent
direction (Path)
Goal
Purpose
Figure 2.10  Manner of movement – Extent – Path – Goal – Purpose.
8.2.5  Stance Adjuncts
These express the speaker’s evaluation or comment on the content of the message, 
or the viewpoint adopted. Syntactically, they often remain somewhat separate from 
the clause, since their message refers to the whole of the clause or sentence. For this 
reason, they are usually found before the clause or after it, as in the first two exam­
ples below. But they can also be placed parenthetically or between commas, within 
a clause or sentence, as in the last two:
Naturally, he spoke to me when he saw me.
He spoke to me when he saw me, naturally.
He naturally spoke to me when he saw me.
He spoke to me, naturally, when he saw me.

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
6 9
Textually, stance adjuncts are of three main kinds: epistemic, evidential and eval­
uative (→ also 28.12, as Theme).
A.  Epistemic stance adjuncts – Do you believe me? Of course I do
These express the speaker’s opinion regarding the validity of the content, comment­
ing on the certainty, doubt, possibility and obviousness of the proposition:
Undoubtedly, he is the finest pianist alive today.
Obviously, he’ll rely on you even more now.
B.  Evidential adjuncts – Apparently, the picture is a fake
These signal the source of knowledge or information. Sources range from the 
speaker’s own experience or belief (In my view/In my experience) to the beliefs or 
accounts of others (According to . . . In the words of . . . and finally hearsay – suppos­
edly, apparently): 
According to the weather forecast, there’s a hurricane on the way.
C.  Evaluative adjuncts – Amazingly, he won a gold medal
These are attitudinal, reflecting the subjective or objective attitude of the speaker 
towards the content and sometimes also towards the addressee: 
Surely you can make up your own mind!
Broadly speaking, the Health Service is satisfactory.  (objective)
Unfortunately, our team didn’t win.  (subjective)
D.  Style and domain adjuncts
Two further types of stance adjunct are Style and Domain adjuncts. Style adjuncts 
are the speaker’s comment on the way s/he is speaking (honestly, frankly, 
confidentially).
Domain adjuncts signal from what viewpoint the message is orientated (techno­
logically, legally, saleswise, etc.):
Quite frankly, it seems to me a lot of bullshit (AmE).
Medically, the project has little to recommend it.
8.2.6  Realisations of the Stance Adjunct: summary
Stance adjuncts can be realised by adverbs, prepositional phrases, finite and non-finite 
clauses:

7 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Adverbs: 	
surely, obviously, frankly, honestly, confidentially, hopefully, probably
PPs: 	
in fact, in reality, at a rough guess, by any chance, of course
Non-fin cl:	
to be honest, to tell the truth, strictly speaking
Fin. cl:	
if I may be frank with you . . . ; don’t take this personally, but . . . 
8.2.7  Connective Adjuncts
These tell us how the speaker or writer understands the semantic connection 
between two utterances, or parts of an utterance, while indicating the semantic 
relationship holding between them: The hotel was rather noisy. On the other hand, it 
wasn’t expensive (contrast). They are not therefore elements of structure, but con­
nectors of structure:
Between groups: 	
Lord Shaftesbury was a persuasive speaker and 
  furthermore a great pioneer of social reform.
Between clauses: 	
The students are on strike; nevertheless, the examinations 
	
  will not be cancelled.
Between sentences: 	
He has been undergoing treatment for asthma since he 
	
  was a boy. Consequently, he never went in for sports.
Between paragraphs:	
In addition to all this . . .
	
First of all . . . 
	
In conclusion . . .
That is to say, such connectors occur at some boundary established at a significant 
point in the organisation of the text. They have a textual function.
Semantically, many different types of connection can be expressed. Here, we 
shall briefly exemplify four main types (→ Chapters 6 and 7):
additive: 	
besides, in the same way, what’s more, moreover, plus (AmE), as 
	
  well, also
contrast: 	
instead, on the contrary, on the other hand, nevertheless, rather, yet
causal: 	
for, because, so, therefore, then, in that case, consequently, thus 
temporal:	 first, then, next, after that, finally, at once
8.2.8  Realisations of the Connective Adjunct: summary
Adverbs: 	
nevertheless, moreover, first, therefore, next, now namely, 
	
  accordingly, consequently, alternatively
PPs: 	
in other words, by the way, on top of that
AdjGs:	
last of all, better still
AdvGs:	
more accurately
Fin.cl:	
that is to say, what is more
Non-fin.cl:	
to sum up, to cap it all
In daily life, turns in conversation are often initiated by a common institutionalised 
connective adjunct, such as Well . . ., Now . . ., Oh . . ., So . . ., Right . . ., functioning 
as discourse markers. Their role is double: they mark a new speaker’s turn in 

T H E  S K E L E T O N  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
7 1
the conversation, and at the same time they mark the management of information, 
as well as the speaker’s attitude to the message. Well has a variety of meanings, 
signalled by intonation, ranging from decision to deliberation. Oh is a surprisal, indi­
cating that the information received is contrary to expectations, or that the speaker 
is adjusting to the new information or perception. I mean, you see and you know 
regulate shared and unshared knowledge. Look and Hey are attention signals, while 
yes, yeah, no and nope are responses that can occur together with other markers. 
Here are some examples of discourse markers in spoken English:
Oh my coffee’s gone cold!	
[KCU]1
It was dreadful! That shop.	
Oh, that’s supposed to be a good shop! [KST]
I’ve lost my keys!	
Well, what do you expect? You never put them away. 
The semantic and textual functions of circumstantial, stance and connective adjuncts 
are described and illustrated in Chapters 6 and 7, and – as realised by adverbs – in 
Chapter 11.
Several of these markers, as well as stance and connective adjuncts, occur in 
the following extract from Alan Ayckbourn’s play Just Between Ourselves, in which 
Neil comes to Dennis’s house to inspect a car for sale.
Dennis:  It’s the pilot light, you see. It’s in a cross draught. It’s very badly sited, that 
stove. They should never have put it there. I’m planning to move it. Right, now.1 
You’ve come about the car, haven’t you?
Neil:	
That’s right.
Dennis:	 Well,2 there she is. Have a look for yourself. That’s the one. 
Neil:	
Ah.
Dennis:	 Now3 I’ll tell you a little bit about it, shall I? Bit of history. Number one,4 it’s not 
my car. It’s the wife’s. However,5 now 6 before you say ah-ah – woman driver, 
she’s been very careful with it. Never had a single accident in it, touch wood. 
Well,7 I mean8 look,9 you can see hardly a scratch on it. Considering the age.10 
To be perfectly honest,11 just between ourselves,12 she’s a better driver than 
me – when she puts her mind to it. I mean,13 look14 considering it’s what now – 
seven – nearly eight years old.15 Just look for yourself at that body work. 
Neil:	
Yes, Yes.16

INTRODUCTION: MAJOR COMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS 
AND VALENCY 
Complementation of the verb refers to the syntactic patterns made up by configurations 
of the clause elements that we examined individually in the previous chapter. Each 
pattern contains a Subject and a Verb. The number and type of other elements in each 
pattern is determined by the verb, as we saw in Chapter 2. Complementation of the 
verb is a very rich and complex area of English grammar.
The aim here is to outline as simply as possible the main choices open to speakers 
from the standpoint of the verb. Choices are, however, balanced by requirements. 
Certain verbs in English may not admit a pattern, or a realisation of a pattern, that is 
perfectly normal in another language.
There are three main types of complementation: intransitive, copular and transitive. 
The transitive has three sub-types. 
Type of complementation

Complex-transitive

I find the idea crazy
The number of verbs in common use in English is very large, especially in certain 
constructions, such as the monotransitive. In addition, many verbs – especially those 
of general meaning, such as get, turn and make – admit more than one type of comple­
mentation, each of which reflects a different type of situation. Make, for instance, can 
enter into all but intransitive patterns: 
I’ll make some tea.	
SVOd
I’ll make you a pizza.	
SVOiOd
He made the coffee too strong.	
SVOdCo
They make a good couple.	
SVCs
It makes for good relations.	
SVPC 
The potential number of participants, including the subject – that is, the number of 
places’ in the clause that the verb controls – is sometimes referred to as its semantic 
valency. Different classes of verbs have different semantic valencies. The verb eat, for 
example, is a two-place verb: it has a semantic valency of two, because in any event of 
eating there must be an eater and a thing eaten. There are one-place verbs, which have 
a subject only, belonging in principle to the SV pattern. Two-place verbs have a sub­
ject and one other element, as in the SVC and SPO patterns. Three-place verbs have a 
subject and two other elements as in the SVOO and SVOC patterns. Syntactic valency 
refers to the number of nominal elements present in any given clause that have a direct 

8 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
grammatical relation to the verb. In The lions ate away at their prey, there is one nominal 
element, as their prey does not have a direct grammatical relation to the verb. Syntactic 
valency often corresponds to its semantic valency, but not always. Weather verbs such 
as rain and snow, for instance, have no semantic participant and so have a semantic 
valency of zero. As finite clauses in English require a subject, however, dummy it is 
used with such verbs, giving a syntactic valency of 1. Valency is reduced when one or 
more elements are omitted in use. For instance, eat has a semantic valency of 2 as in 
He ate an orange; the valency is reduced to 1 in What time do you eat here?

INTRANSITIVE AND 	
UNIT 9
COPULAR PATTERNS	
SUMMARY
1 	 Where there is no complementation the verb is said to be intransitive. The struc­
ture is S-V. Some verbs are always intransitive (arrive, snow, blink, vanish). Others 
represent intransitive uses of basically transitive verbs (eat, drive, read).
2 	 Some intransitive verbs, particularly those of position (live, lie) or movement (go, 
walk), usually require a Locative or Goal Complement, respectively.
3	
Locative Adjuncts are commonly present but not necessarily required after many 
verbs such as work, arrive, retire and stop. Locative and other circumstantial infor­
mation is often pragmatically inferred in discourse.
4	
The S-V-Cs pattern contains a copular verb that links the subject to a Complement 
encoding what the subject is or becomes. The most typical copula is be. Other 
verbs used as copulas in English provide additional meaning to the mere linking. 
This may be sensory (look, feel, smell, sound, taste) or refer to a process of becom­
ing (become, get, go, grow, turn). The notion of ‘being’ also includes being in a 
place, expressed by a circumstantial locative Complement, as we saw in 8.2.3.
5	
We now use Verb instead of Predicator as it is the verb that controls the type of 
complement. 
9.1  SUBJECT – VERB
The pure intransitive pattern contains a one-place verb such as sneeze, which has a 
subject but no complement. We distinguish the following types of intransitive verb: 
verbs of behaviour which is typically involuntary or semi-voluntary: laugh, smile, 
cry, blink, blush, cough, sneeze, sigh, tremble, yawn; wait, stay; die, collapse, faint, 
fall (They all laughed, someone yawned, one soldier fainted.)
verbs of weather: rain, snow (It’s raining. It’s snowing. The sun rose.)

8 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
verbs of occurrence: appear, disappear, go, come, arrive, depart, vanish, fade, 
happen: What happened?Hopes of avoiding war are now fading. 
idiomatic intransitive phrasal verbs such as crop up as in a problem has 
cropped up, where there is no verb ‘crop’ of the same meaning (→ 6.4.2). By 
contrast, with free combinations of verb + particle used literally as in the bird 
flew away, the particle is analysed as a directional Complement (6.4.2 and 9.2). 
Opinions differ in this respect, however, some preferring Adjunct in the case of 
free combinations.
Note that some of these ‘pure intransitives’ can also function in other structures, as we 
shall see later on.
9.2  SUBJECT – VERB – LOCATIVE COMPLEMENT (Cloc)
Other intransitives of the following types typically require a Complement of place, 
direction or destination to complete their meaning. Location in space is extended to 
include location in time (→ 10.8 for certain transitive verbs with similar requirements):
• 
Location in place or time: be, stand, live, lie, remain
• 
Movement + manner of movement: walk, run, stroll, crawl, fly
The National Theatre stands near the river. 
The amusement park is just over there
She is lying in a hammock. 
We walked home.
The soldier crawled under the wire fence. 
We can compare this verb lie, meaning to be in a prone position, with lie, a 
‘pure’intransitive, meaning to tell lies: He is lying in a hammock vs He is lying.
We can also contrast uses of the same verb, such as run, which can occur either as 
a pure intransitive in the answer to How does Tom keep fit? – He runs, or with a Goal 
Complement in He runs to the bus-stop every morning (→ 8.2.3).
Note that, for brevity, the term Cloc is used to encompass both Locative and Goal 
meanings.
9.2.1  Pragmatic inference of circumstantial meanings
Similarly, other verbs of position, such as wait and stay, and verbs of movement such 
as go, leave, come and walk can either function as pure intransitives or be followed by a 
Locative/Goal Complement. The choice depends to a great extent on whether there is 
sufficient support from the context to sustain the intransitive. For example, if a contrast 
is being made – as in Do you want to leave or would you rather stay? – the intransitive 
verb alone is sufficient, because the location is pragmatically inferred as being the place 
where the addressee is. Similarly, in You can either take the bus or walk, the destination 
is clearly known from the context, and a suitable reply would be ‘I’ll walk’.However, if 
the location or destination are not inferrable, a locative or Goal Complement becomes 

T H E  D E V E L O P M E N T  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
8 3
necessary as in We went home. Without the specification ‘home’, the verb would 
carry insufficient semantic ‘weight’ and informativeness to complete the predicate. 
Complements are more tightly integrated than Adjuncts, the tightest being the Subject 
and Object complements following copular verbs (→ 9.4; 10.7).
9.3  SUBJECT – VERB – ADJUNCT 
With other verbs such as work, arrive, retire, stop a circumstantial Adjunct is commonly 
added, but it is not a requirement because the verb has sufficient weight in itself. 
This may be for cultural reasons, for example, work being interpreted as ‘have a job’ 
(1b below), retire as ‘retire from employment’ (3b), or because of the aspectual mean- 
ings conferred by the perfect (3b, 4b) and progressive (2b) aspects, which lend ‘weight’ 
to the verb (→ 43.3). Compare: 
S-V-A	
S-V
1a 
Tom works in London.	
1b  Does his sister Priscilla work?
2a 
What’s up? 	
2b  What’s happening? 
3a 
He retired last year.	
3b  He has retired.
4a 
We stopped at Wimbledon.	
4b  The clock has stopped.
9.4  SUBJECT – VERB – COMPLEMENT OF THE SUBJECT 
Copular verbs link the subject with a complement which characterises or identifies 
the subject referent:
A couch potato (S) is (V) someone who lies watching television all day (Cs). 
This new game (S) is (V) incredibly simple and endlessly gripping (Cs). 
The most prototypical copular verb is be, which can be followed by a wide range of 
adjectives and NGs. Others, such as remain, keep, taste, smell, sound, fall, feel, come, grow 
and turn, are followed by a more limited range of adjectives which are often specific to 
a particular verb, as specified here: 
9.4.1  Verbs of being and becoming 
Verbs of being are stative and introduce current or existing attributes: 
The reason is simple.
Lloyd George was a man of principle but he was also intensely pragmatic.
We have to remain optimistic about the future.
Will you keep still! 
Verbs of becoming are dynamic and introduce resulting attributes. In addition, grow 
suggests gradual change, while go is used to indicate drastic changes:

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Her latest novel has become a best-seller.
We began to grow uneasy when the skin-diver didn’t appear.
His face went pale.
Current	
Resulting
be careful 	
become dangerous
seem annoyed 	
get stressed
look cheerful 	
turn nasty
sound familiar	
prove unsatisfactory
smell spicy 	
go bald
9.4.2 Other linking verbs 
A small number of verbs that are normally used without a complement (fall, come, run) 
can function as copulas with specific adjectives as Cs: 
The child fell flat on its face.
The soldiers all fell asleep/ fell ill. 
The label has come unstuck. 
As be predicts not only being something but being somewhere, it can also link the 
subject to a circumstance, usually of position, place or time. The Complement is then 
identified as Cloc, as in The Tube station is over there. (→ 4.2 and 9.2).

TRANSITIVE PATTERNS	
UNIT 10 
SUMMARY 
1 	 Monotransitive patterns contain a two place verb (carry, say) and have a Direct 
Object or a Prepositional Complement (PC). Objects, like Subjects, most typically 
represent an entity (a person or thing), less typically a fact or a situation within the 
main situation. Entities are typically realised by group structures, facts and situa­
tions by clauses. We will postpone the discussion of clausal realisations to Unit 11.
2	
Ditransitive patterns contain a three-place verb (give, offer, rob, blame).
Semantically, they express situations in which three participants are involved, 
encoded syntactically as the subject and the two objects. There are two main 
patterns.
3	
One pattern contains a verb such as give, send, owe, which takes two Objects, 
Indirect and Direct, sequenced in that order (give Jo a copy), each of which can 
potentially become subject in a passive clause.
4	
The second pattern, with verbs such as remind and rob, takes a Direct Object fol­
lowed by a PC, whose preposition is controlled by the verb (It reminds me of Italy). 
Only the Direct Object can become subject in a passive clause.
5	
The complex-transitive pattern has one Object and one Complement, after 
verbs such as appoint, name and find.
6	
We here use Verb instead of Predicator as it is the verb that controls the type of 
complement. 
10.1  SUBJECT – VERB – DIRECT OBJECT 
Verbs which take a direct object are very numerous and of different semantic types 
(carry the luggage, know the answer, feel the heat of the flames, enjoy the film, want a 
copy). The semantic types are described in Chapter 4.

kids’ TV programmes.

all this stuff.
10.2  VERBS USED TRANSITIVELY AND INTRANSITIVELY
Many verbs in English are used both transitively and intransitively with the same 
meaning. They include several types: 
1 	 Verbs with an implied Object, such as smoke (cigarettes), drive (a car), park 
(a car), drink (alcohol), save (money), wave (one’s hand), as in Do you smoke? He 
doesn’t drive. Such intransitive uses can be considered as instances of valency 
reduction, that is, the normal valency of two of these verbs is reduced to one. As 
these reductions are based on cultural schemas and tend to have an implication 
of habituality, they are not extended to other object referents such as wave a flag, 
drink milk. With certain verbs such as read, write, eat and teach the deleted direct 
object is not specific, and is perhaps unknown, as in He teaches and she writes.
Drinking and driving don’t match.
It is impossible to park in the city centre.
They are saving to buy a house.
He waved to us from the bridge.
2 	 Causatives with an intransitive counterpart, constituting an ergative pair 
(→ Chapter 4):
He opened the door. (SVOd)	
The door opened. (SV)
She clicked the camera. 	
The camera clicked. 
3 	 Verbs with a reflexive meaning:
He shaved (himself), She dressed (herself).
4 	 Verbs with a reciprocal meaning:
Tom and Jo met at a concert (met each other).
10.3  SUBJECT – VERB – PREPOSITIONAL COMPLEMENT 
Verbs which take a PC are: prepositional verbs such as see + to, deal + with (see to the 
plane tickets, deal with an emergency), phrasal prepositional verbs as in run out of petrol, 
and multi-word combinations that end in a preposition as in get rid of old newspapers. 
The criteria for distinguishing these verbs from phrasal verbs are discussed in Chapter 2.

The Prime Minister (S) can’t account (V) for the loss of votes (PC). 
We’re banking on everyone’s support for the rally.
He would never resort to cheating. What are you hinting at? 
10.4  SUBJECT – VERB – INDIRECT OBJECT – DIRECT OBJECT
There are two main types of ditransitive complementation: the basic type, in which 
an Indirect Object precedes a Direct Object, and another, in which a Direct Object 
is followed by a prepositional Complement. The first is discussed now, the second 
in 10.5.
10.4.1  Verbs of transfer (give, lend) and intended transfer 
(buy, get) 
Types: I gave her a present    I got her a present 
This is the basic ditransitive pattern. Three-place verbs like give have a subject and two 
Objects, representing the transfer of goods or information from one person to another. 
They also include speech act verbs such as ‘offer’ and ‘promise’. Here are some more 
verbs like give:
hand  lend  offer  owe  pass  promise  read  send  show  teach  throw  write
He showed the policeman his driving licence. (He showed his driving licence to the 
policeman.)
We are offering our clients a unique opportunity. ( . . . to our clients)
She owes several people large sums of money. ( . . . to several people) 
As the examples show, the indirect Object has a prepositional counterpart, the give 
type with to, the get type with for (I gave a present to her. I got/bought a present for her). 
The PP functions as a prepositional Complement.

8 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Verbs of intended transfer carry out a service for someone, or even a disservice, as 
in They set him a trap/They set a trap for him. Other verbs like get and buy include the 
following:
book  bring  build  buy  cash  cut  fetch  find  leave  spare  keep  make  pour
save
Book me a sleeper on the night train. ( . . . a sleeper for me)
Will you call me a taxi, please? ( . . . a taxi for me)
Paul got us a very good discount. ( . . . a good discount for us) 
With the ‘give’ type, two passives are usually possible:
Active:	
I gave Jo a copy.
Passive 1:	 Jo was given a copy.	
(Oi in active clause → S in passive clause)
Passive 2:	 A copy was given to Jo.	 (Od in active clause → S in passive clause)
	
?A copy was given Jo.	
(? Indicates divided acceptability)
The ‘first passive’ brings the Recipient participant to subject (Jo). The ‘second passive’ 
brings the thing given to subject, followed by the Recipient as prepositional Complement 
(to Jo). The non-prepositional form A copy was given Jo, is considered ungrammatical 
by many speakers, but is accepted by others. Two orderings whose equivalents are 
acceptable in certain languages but which are ungrammatical in English are the follow­
ing: *To Jo was given a copy and *To Jo it was given a copy.
The difference between the two valid passive forms is a question of information 
packaging (→ 29.1). They are useful alternatives when the active subject is not known 
or is not important in the discourse.
10.4.2  Less prototypical but common three-place verbs 
There is a good deal of variation in ditransitive verbs. Not all verbs display the 
alternative structures of those listed in 10.4.1. Here are a few of the most common 
variants:
Type: explain + Od+ Prepositional Complement – He explained the 
problem to us 
Typical verbs are: announce, confess, deliver, mention, return and say. There is no 
corresponding structure with the Oi in its usual place: *He explained us the problem. 
That is, these verbs take only the prepositional Complement after the Od.
Did she say hello to you?	
* Did she say you hello? 
I never mentioned her name to anyone.	
* Mention no-one her name. 

T H E  D E V E L O P M E N T  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
8 9
Type: deliver + Od + Goal complement – They’ll deliver the pizza to 
your house this evening.
There is no non-prepositional counterpart of a Goal Complement *They’ll deliver 
you/ your house the pizza. 
Type: wish + Oi + Od – We wish you luck 
Other verbs: allow, cost, wish, refuse and ‘light’ uses of give (→ 20.2). 
Conversely, these verbs have no prepositional counterpart with to. Note that the 
starred counter- parts on the right are ungrammatical. Ask something of someone is 
possible, however, as in I must ask a favour of you. 
They allow everyone a ten-minute break.  *They allow a ten-minute break to 
	
  everyone.
He gave the door a push. 	
*He gave a push to the door.
Let’s ask someone the way. 	
*Let’s ask the way to someone. 
Many three-place verbs allow valency reduction from 3 to 2 when there is contextual 
support, as in He called a taxi, he got a discount, they blamed me, let’s ask the way.
10.5  SUBJECT – VERB – DIRECT OBJECT – PREPOSITIONAL 
COMPLEMENT 
Although predicted by the verb, the PC in this ditransitive pattern (e.g. It reminds me of 
you) is further away from the verb and the NG is not a central participant. However, it 
encodes a participant that can be formally questioned (Of whom 1, For what 2) placed 
before the preposition or, informally, stranded (→ 6.3.3). It can also occur in a wh-cleft 3: 
1  Who does it remind you of? (Of whom does it remind you? )
2  What are you thanking me for? (For what are you thanking me?)
3  What it reminds me of is Italy.
In discourse, the PC may be omitted when its referent is understood, as in They blamed 
me (for something already mentioned). The Direct Object is usually a person and the 
PC may be an entity or an event.
Some of the verbs taking this construction are listed here according to preposition. 
Remember that a NG is placed between the verb and the preposition.

on her success.
Only the direct object constituent can become subject in the passive clause:
Your skin will be protected from the sun’s rays.
She was robbed of her watch and jewels.
He was charged with assault.
Janet was congratulated on her success.
Blame, a three-place verb, admits two alternative constructions with different 
prepositions, which reflect the way the event is viewed in each case. The more central 
of the two participants is placed first, as Od. In one version this is Jane; in the other 
the accident.
blame someone (Od) for something (PC)	
He blamed Jane for the accident
blame something (Od) on someone (PC)	
He blamed the accident on Jane.
There are thus two passives – Jane was blamed for the accident, The accident was blamed 
on Jane – which centre respectively on ‘Jane’ and on ‘the accident’.
Likewise, the NG following the preposition can be questioned by who or what (What 
was Jane blamed for? Who was the accident blamed on?).
Other verbs that present a similar variation are supply, load and drain:
We supply the school with paper (PC).  We supply paper(Od) to the school (PC). 
They loaded the cart with hay. (PC). 	
They loaded hay on to the cart. (Cloc). 
They drained the pool of water. (PC).	
They drained water from the pool. (Clo). 
With load and drain the cognitive representation is rather different with each alternative. 
With the receptacle the cart and the pool as object, there is a notion of totality: the cart 
is completely full of hay, the pool completely drained of water. By contrast, with hay 
and water as object, there is an impression of partialness: some hay is loaded, some 
water is drained. If the definite article is used (the hay, the water), the implication is of 
totality.
10.6  FRAME, PERSPECTIVE AND ATTENTION 
The cognitive notion of frame allows us to conceptualise a situation from different 
perspectives. For instance, Fillmore’s ‘commercial event’ frame for [BUY] includes a 
reference to four other variables, namely to a BUYER, a SELLER, GOODS and MONEY. 
A syntactic pattern formulated from the perspective of the BUYER could be as follows:
Tom bought some old CDs from Phil for twenty euros.

T H E  D E V E L O P M E N T  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
9 1
In this sentence all four variables of the BUY frame are encoded linguistically, each 
filling a different syntactic function: the BUYER (Tom) as subject, the GOODS (the 
CDs) as direct object, the SELLER (Phil) as the first adjunct and the MONEY (for twenty 
euros) as the second adjunct. This distribution of syntactic functions is the syntactic 
perspective, which here is largely controlled by the choice of the verb BUY.
Within the same frame, it would be easy to take a different perspective by choosing 
another related verb such as SELL, CHARGE or PAY. The verb sell perspectivises 
SELLER and GOODS as subject and object, charge also perspectivises the SELLER as 
subject but the BUYER as object, and pay perspectivises the BUYER and MONEY, with 
the SELLER as optional indirect object. 
Phil sold some old CDs to Tom for twenty euros.
Phil charged Tom twenty euros for some of his old CDs.
Tom paid Phil twenty euros for some old CDs.
The notion of perspective draws on the cognitive ability to direct one’s attention. To 
a large degree, we conceptualise events in different ways according to what attracts 
our attention. As language users, we use the verb buy when describing a commercial 
event in order to draw attention to the BUYER and the GOODS, functioning as subject 
and object respectively. We use the verb sell to focus attention on the SELLER and the 
GOODS. By means of the frame we can even call up cognitive categories that had no 
prominence and were not expressed (though they were implied) in the frame itself, 
for instance SPEND and COST. These can be externalised in sentences such as the 
following:
Tom spent twenty euros on some old CDs
The old CDs cost Tom twenty euros.
For complementation by clauses → Units 11 and 12.
10.7  SUBJECT – VERB – DIRECT OBJECT – OBJECT 
COMPLEMENT 
SUMMARY 
1 	 Three-place verbs with one Object and one Complement of the Object are called 
complex transitive. The Direct Object typically represents a person or thing, and the 
Object Complement adds information about this referent in the form of an attribute: 
I found the house empty, He got his shoes wet.
2 	 The attribute is either current (as with find) or resulting (as with get).
3 	 The participant encoded as direct object can typically be made subject in a cor­
responding passive clause.

9 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
10.7.1  Current and Resulting Attributes – He got his shoes wet 
This three-place pattern is essentially an S-V-Od pattern with an attributive Object 
Complement added. As attribute the complement specifies the state or status of the 
Od referent in relation to the situation described by the verb. The attribute may be 
‘current’, contemporaneous with the verb (He keeps the garden beautiful), or the result 
of the action denoted by the verb (They elected her Vice-President).
Verbs that take a current attribute after the object are stative, and include: 
••
verbs of causing to remain in a certain state such as hold and keep
••
verbs such as believe, consider, think, find, imagine, presume, hold
••
verbs such as want, like and prefer 
Keep your hands steady!
I imagined him much older.
Verbs that take resulting attributes represent processes of doing, and include bake, 
drive (mad), get, leave, make, paint, turn, wipe as well as verbs of declaring, such as 
appoint, elect, call, name, declare, report and certify, which confer an official status.
With AdjG Complement:
It wipes the windscreen dry.	
That barking dog is driving me mad. 
The heat has turned the milk sour.	
They presumed her dead. 
With NG Complement: 
They appointed him Manager.
The direct object referent in complex transitive structures can be made subject in a 
passive clause, which then has an S-V-Cs structure. In fact, with some verbs the passive 
is more common than the active, particularly when the Agent is unexpressed, as in she 
was presumed dead; he is reported missing; he was certified insane.
With some verbs, the attribute is not essential to make a grammatical clause (It 
wipes the windscreen). This is because many verbs enter into more than one structure: 
wipe can function in a monotransitive structure (wipe the windscreen) or in a complex 
transitive structure (wipe the windscreen dry). Other examples which, without the 
complement, also fit the monotransitive structure include You’ve cut your hair (short); 
we got the books (cheap).
A further type of attribute is that of respect. This is expressed by as + NG when 
introduced by such verbs as regard, refer to, write off, acclaim: 
Churchill referred to him as an outstanding leader.
Fans acclaimed the Rolling Stones’ concert as the event of the season. 

T H E  D E V E L O P M E N T  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
9 3
As a consequence of the multi-functionality of many verbs, examples can be invented 
in which one type of unit such as a NG can realise two different types of constituent: 
He called her an angel. S-V-Od-Co He called her a taxi. S-V -Oi-Od 
10.8  SUBJECT – VERB – DIRECT OBJECT – LOCATIVE 
COMPLEMENT – Hang the picture on the wall
Verbs such as put, place, stand, lead occur with a Locative/Goal Complement: 
Stand the lamp near the desk.
The track led us to a farm.
Many other verbs such as talk, take, bring and show can be used in this way, while keep 
and hold can function with both Attributes and in Locative/Goal patterns.
I didn’t want to go, but she talked me into it. (Cloc)
Hold your head up! (Cloc) We hold you responsible. (Co)

COMPLEMENTATION BY	
UNIT 11
FINITE CLAUSES 	
SUMMARY 
1 	 All clausal complements are determined by the verb. Many verbs admit more than 
one type of complementation.
2 	 That-clauses form the largest group of finite clause complements and are controlled 
by transitive verbs. They are classed according to communicative function and 
meanings, which include facts, perceptions, reports and proposals.
3 	 Wh-clause complements are of three types: a) indirect wh-interrogatives, b) wh- 
nominal clauses and c) indirect exclamatives. They occur after verbs such as a) ask, 
inquire b) advise, show, teach, tell, and c) say, tell, believe respectively.
4 	 Clausal complements can be considered non-prototypical realisations of clause 
constituents. In these sections, however, we concentrate mainly on the patterns.
In Chapter 1, section 2.4.1 C, the concept of embedding was introduced in relation 
to clauses. In a sentence such as The doctor knows that you are waiting, we say that the 
subordinate clause that you are waiting is embedded in the main clause The doctor 
knows. Another term is the matrix. 
The embedded clause, introduced by a complementiser (subordinator), functions as 
a non-prototypical direct object.
The complementiser that has little semantic value and is purely functional. By 
contrast, a wh-word has meaning and functions as a constituent of the embedded 
clause, as in The doctor knows what you need. The structure of this sentence is shown 
in the following diagram. 
The main verb is said to determine or control the dependent clause. 
Here, the clauses will be discussed as realising Object and Complement functions 
(Cs and Co). For clauses fulfilling subject function → 5.1.2.
The four main types of dependent complement clause are: that-clauses, wh-clauses, 
to-infinitive clauses and -ing clauses. They are distinguished by their complementiser 
(subordinator) such as that or a wh-word, and by their own structure. They are shown 
here complementing monotransitive verbs.

Clause as complement with monotransitive verbs 
finite that-clause:
He believes that he’s right.
finite wh-clause:
He asked what I meant.
He believed what I told him.
I said how nice it was.
non-finite to-infinitive clause:
without dep.cl subject
He wants to stay.
with dep.cl. subject
He wants us all to stay.
non-finite -ing clause:
without dep. cl. subject
He doesn’t like driving in fog
with dep. cl. subject
He doesn’t like her driving in fog. 
That-clauses and wh-clauses are finite, having a subject and tense-modality features, 
while to-infinitive and -ing clauses are non-finite, and lack these distinctions. All of 
these types can be used to complement verbs and adjectives. Less versatile are the 
‘bare’ infinitive (He helped me carry the bags) and the -en participle clause, which 
occurs in the complex-transitive structure (I heard two shots fired). Non-finite comple­
mentation is discussed in Unit 12.

11.1  MEANINGS AND PATTERNS OF THAT-CLAUSE 
COMPLEMENTS 
A that-clause complement can be used to express factual or non-factual information 
which is reported, known, believed or perceived; it can be used to make proposals and 
suggestions and to describe situations that produce an emotive effect on the subject. 
The choice of verb combines with the meaning to determine the structural pattern.
11.1.1 Verb + that-clause – I think it’s beautiful 
Facts, beliefs, doubts, perceptions – I believe you are right 
These meanings are expressed by a that-clause containing an indicative. This represents 
an indirect statement and follows verbs of certain types: 
••
Verbs of cognition – knowing, doubting, perceiving – such as think, know, believe, 
imagine, see, doubt; with doubt, don’t know, the subordinator is if or whether. 
We know that you have lived abroad for some time.
He could see that she was not at all happy.
I doubt/I don’t know if/whether we’ll get there before dark.
••
Verbs of expectation – expect, hope, suppose and wish – which refer to potential 
situations rather than facts, frequently take a modal auxiliary in the indicative 
that- clause.
I expect (that) you would like something to drink after your journey.
I suppose (that) he must have lost his way.
For omission of complementiser that → 11.2.
Reports – Jo says she is ill 
Reports encode things that people have said. They are introduced by verbs of 
communicating, such as say, announce, answer, explain, mean, mention, report, and 
performatives such as admit and confess. Reports are treated in Chapter 7 under 
‘indirect speech’.
The Minister answered that he didn’t know.
You never mentioned that you were married. 
Proposals – The party suggests he call/should call an election
Verbs such as propose, suggest, recommend and demand aim at getting someone 
to do something. The meaning in the complement clause is therefore potential, for 
which many European languages require a subjunctive. English has traditionally two 

T H E  D E V E L O P M E N T  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
9 7
possibilities: an uninflected subjunctive (e.g. be), common in AmE, or should + infinitive, 
common in BrE. Both are illustrated in 1 and 2, below. The same choices are open 
before an it + adj construction. Illustrated here is a formal use: 
It is right that this House debate this issue and pass judgement. (PM Tony Blair in the 
House of Commons, 18 March 2003)
A third choice, adopted by some speakers, is the indicative, as illustrated in a news 
report 3:
1	
He demands that she pay/should pay him back.
2	
The chairman proposed that a vote be taken/ should be taken.
3	
They demand that he apologises to the Iraqi people.
(For complementation by to-infinitive clause → 12.2.)
11.1.2  Dropping or retaining the complementiser that 
We can drop or retain the complementiser (or subordinator) that without affecting the 
meaning of the clause. Certain factors appear to favour one choice or the other.
Omission of that is favoured by the following factors:
(a)	 when think or say is the main verb – I think it’s worth doing, Tim says it’s easy
(b)	 when the subject refers to the same entity in the main clause and in the that-clause, 
as in Tim promised he’d do it
(c)	 when there is a pronoun rather than a noun head in the that-clause (I think I’ll have 
a cola, She knew he would do it).
It has also been suggested that I think and I know, for example, are not main clauses at 
all, but are better analysed as epistemic, evidential or evaluative parentheticals, while 
what is traditionally classed as the complement clause in fact carries the main proposi­
tion. This view is based on two pieces of evidence: the verb + its subject can be placed 
parenthetically after the clause – I’ll have a cola, I think; He’ll do it, I know – and the 
tag-question relates to the complement clause, not to the main clause – I think she’ll 
have a cola, won’t she? (not *don’t I?).
Retaining that after a verb is favoured by: 
(d)	 coordinated that-clauses: Many people believe that big is best and that war is right. 
(e)	 passive voice in the main clause: It is believed that peace is in sight.
(f)	 a NG or PP (or clause containing a NG) placed between the main clause and 
the that-clause: Can you prove to the commission that the effects are not 
harmful? 
Overall, that is omitted most in informal spoken registers, which is where the ‘abc’ fac­
tors tend to cluster, while the subordinator is retained most in formal written registers, 
which are characterised by the ‘def’ factors. These are not strict divisions, however, as 

9 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
even formal registers nowadays are often a mix of the formal and the less formal. The 
following short extract from The Peacemakers illustrates the tendencies: 
People have often assumed that, because Lloyd George opposed the Boer War, he was 
not an imperialist. On the contrary, he had always taken great pride in the empire but 
he had never thought it was being run properly. 
That-clauses do not follow prepositions in English and consequently cannot realise 
the PC function. Instead, one of three solutions is adopted: a) the preposition (e.g. on) 
is omitted; b) the preposition is retained and is followed by anticipatory it, or c) the fact 
can be inserted before a that-clause with a factual meaning:
(a)	 He insists that we all go.
(b)	 He insists on it that we all go.
(c)	 You must allow for the fact that they are handicapped.
11.1.3  Verb + NG + that-clause – I told you I’d be late 
Many verbs of communicating (tell, inform), verbs of causing someone to think or 
believe or know something (convince, persuade, remind, teach), and the performative 
verbs promise and warn, can take a that-clause after the direct object: 
He finally convinced the jury that he was telling the truth. 
Experience has taught them that a back-up copy is essential.
11.2  SAY AND TELL
Note that say and tell have different complementation patterns:
••
Say is monotransitive, controlling a direct object (Say that number again; He said 
he was sorry), while tell is ditransitive, with two objects (Tell me your name, tell me 
you love me).
••
Say can take an added prepositional Complement (What did you say to him?), but 
not an indirect object (*What did you say him?).
••
Quoted speech may realise the object of say, but not that of tell (Jill said ‘Hello’, but 
not *Jill told me ‘Hello’). →36.5. 
A series of clauses may be embedded, each within the previous one: I reminded him 
that he’d said (that) he’d find out about the flight schedules. In speech, the second that 
complementiser would most likely be omitted.

11.3  MEANINGS AND PATTERNS OF WH-CLAUSE 
COMPLEMENTS 
There are two main patterns, which are controlled by specific verbs. Pattern 1 has 
simply a wh-complement. Pattern 2 has an intervening NG (a Recipient). Certain 
verbs such as ask can function in both patterns. A third type, with a to-infinitive 
complement, is a variant on types 1 and 2 and is very common, especially in spoken 
English. 
11.3.1  Indirect interrogatives
V + wh-clause – Ask where the station is 
The verbs ask, wonder, doubt, enquire, don’t know control indirect interrogatives. The 
subordinator if is often used as an alternative to whether in indirect questions where the 
answer is either yes or no: 
We asked what we should do/what to do.
The tourist enquired why the museum was closed.
Pat wondered whether/if her friends would recognise her.
As indirect interrogatives contain an embedded question, it is important to 
remember that subject–operator inversion does not normally occur in embedded 
questions, unlike the obligatory inversion found in most independent interrogatives. 
Compare:
independent interrogative	
dependent interrogative
Where is the dining-car?	
Let’s enquire where the dining-car is.
	
Not *Let’s enquire where is the dining-car.
11.3.2  Nominal relatives 
V + NG + wh-clauses – Give them what they want 
These verbs – common ones include advise, give, show, teach and tell – can control 
nominal relative clause complements, which represent factual information and can be 
distinguished by replacing the wh-word by a more general word, such as ‘the thing(s)/ 
person(s) that’, and in some cases by a to-inf. clause: 
He told me what I already knew. (the things which I already knew)
Tom will show you where you can send it/the place where you can send it to/where 
to send it.
The instructor taught the dancers how they should breathe/the way they should 
breathe/how to breathe.

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
11.3.3  Non-finite variants 
V + NG + wh + to-infinitive clause – Ask (him) how to do it 
This combination provides a shorter variant of 11.3.1 and 11.3.2, with verbs such as 
ask, know, show, tell, teach and wonder. The NG recipient is obligatory with tell, show 
and teach, optional with ask, and not used at all with know and wonder.
We didn’t know where to go.	
(indirect interrogative)
Tom told us what to do. 	
(nominal relative)
Ambiguity can sometimes occur with wh-complements, as in He asked me what I knew, 
which can be analysed as an indirect interrogative (compare with the direct form What 
do you know? ) or as a nominal relative (the things I knew) – the latter, for example, in 
the context of reporting on an examination.
11.3.4  Indirect exclamatives 
V + (NG) + what + NG or how + AdjG – I said how nice it was 
The embedded exclamative is introduced by either how (+ adjective) or what (+ NG) 
after two types of verbs: verbs of communicating such as say and tell, and mental verbs 
such as believe and think. Like ordinary exclamatives, it has an emotive quality (→ 24.1):
You’ll never believe what a good time we had. 
I told her how sorry I was. 

COMPLEMENTATION BY	
UNIT 12
NON-FINITE CLAUSES	
SUMMARY
1 	 Non-finite clauses are more loosely integrated into the superordinate clause than 
are finite clauses. Only the to-infinitive complements of certain verbs such as want, 
like and prefer and the -ing complements of like, hate among others, can be treated 
as (non-prototypical) object constituents.
2 	 A series of non-finite clauses can be analysed as a chain-like structure of embedded 
non-finite complements.
3 	 To-infinitive clauses tend to evoke potential situations, whereas -ing clauses are fac­
tual and bare infinitive clauses evoke an event in which the end-point is included.
4 	 Participial -en clauses function as Object Complements after four types of verb.
12.1  CATENATIVE COMPLEMENTS 
A catenative verb is a verb that controls a non-finite complement. ‘Catenative’ 
means ‘chaining’ and reflects the way that the verb can link successively with other 
catenatives to form a chain, as in:
We decided to try to rent a house near the sea.
Here there is a chain of three verbs: decide, try and rent, with to try to rent a house near 
the sea functioning as the catenative complement of decide, and to rent a house near the 
sea functioning as the catenative complement of try.
We can add further catenative verbs to produce an even longer chain of four 
catenatives, two of which, persuade and help, have a NG object. The final verb rent is 
not a catenative: We decided to try to persuade Bill to help us rent a house near the sea.

to try to persuade Bill to help us rent a house near the sea.
 ii	 Try	
to persuade Bill to help us rent a house near the sea.
iii	 Persuade	
Bill to help us rent a house near the sea.
iv	 Help	
us rent a house near the sea.
Further catenatives appear in the following section. A special type of catenative con­
struction – as in He failed to appear – is discussed in 39.4. Not all catenatives behave in 
the same way. Only the complements of a few catenatives such as want, like and prefer 
can be analysed as (untypical) objects. Others cannot (→ also 6.1.2E).
12.2  MEANINGS EXPRESSED BY TO-INFINITIVE CLAUSES 
12.2.1  Type 1: V + to-infinitive – I want to go 
These three groups of verbs take to-infinitive clause complements: 
(a)	 want, wish, intend, arrange
(b)	 like, love, prefer, can’t bear, hate
(c)	 promise, agree, learn, forget, decide 
The to-infinitive clause in Type 1 has no explicit subject, the implied subject being 
that of the main clause. Semantically this is clear. If I want to go, the going is to be 
done by me. For the (c) group of speech-act verbs, there is an equivalent that-clause 
complement with the same meaning, but this alternative is not available to the (a) and 
(b) groups of desiderative and affective verbs: 
1	
The boss wants to see us immediately. (no that-clause counterpart in 1 and 2)
2	
I have arranged to go to London tomorrow.
3	
I promise to ring you later. (compare: I promise that I will ring you later)
4	
They agreed to wait a bit longer. (compare: they agreed that they would wait a bit 
longer) 
To-infinitive clauses tend to evoke a situation that is potential. Cognitively, the infinitive 
reflects an event, with to symbolically reflecting the movement towards the event. For 
this reason the controlling verb typically ‘looks forward’ to the moment when the event 
begins.
12.2.2  Type 2: V + NG + to-infinitive clause with subject –
He wants us to go 
The ‘want’ verbs include: want, like, love, prefer, can’t bear, dislike, hate, wish, arrange. 
The people want the troops to leave.
He did not like her to leave his side for more than a day.	
[EFX] 
I only want us to be together, always.	
[GWH]
I have arranged for the students to go to London tomorrow.

The ‘want’ type verbs in this section take a to-infinitive clause that has an explicit 
subject. Semantically, what the people want, what ‘he’did not like are situations, not 
persons or things. For this reason, the non-finite clause, together with its subject, is 
analysed as a single unit which can be considered an untypical direct object. This can 
be tested by (a) replacement by a pronoun (He did not like that), (b) coordination (and 
she herself did not like it either), and (c) clefting: the non-finite clause and its subject can 
become the focus of a wh-cleft (What he did not like was for her to leave his side for more 
than a day).
Furthermore, although these subjects of to-infinitive clauses are in the objective 
case (us, her) they can’t be analysed as objects of the main verb. The complete clause 
does not entail The people want the troops or He did not like her. Nor can they become 
subject in a passive clause: *The troops were wanted to go, *She was not liked to leave his 
side for more than a day. In this respect, verbs like want contrast with those of Type 3 
(in the next section) such as ask, advise and expect, in which the NG does represent a 
separate clause element.
Note the use of for as a subordinator, introducing the non-finite clause with its 
subject (for the students to go to London tomorrow) after the main verb arrange. In AmE 
this use of for is extended to other verbs such as want and prefer.
Finally, we can test want-type verbs with a What question: What do you want? rather 
than a Who question: Who do you want? The object of my wanting is (for) us to be 
together, always.
12.2.3  Type 3: V + NG + to-infinitive –We asked the taxi-driver 
to stop 
The verbs in this type are speech-act verbs: advise, allow, ask, beg, expect, invite, tell, 
persuade, urge. For this reason the referent of the NG is always human. The NG is both 
the object of the main verb and the implicit subject of the embedded to-infinitive clause. 
This NG behaves as if it were the object of the finite verb and can become subject in 
a passive clause. This divisibility of the NG is an important feature of ditransitive and 
most complex transitive complements. As with other verbs of this type, passives are 
common. 
They persuaded us to stay.	
We were persuaded to stay.
A television campaign is advising	
Teenagers are being advised to keep off
teenagers to keep off drugs.	
drugs.
Semantically, we persuade, advise and invite someone, not a whole situation. Note 
that, when a to-infinitive clause is ellipted (→ 29.5), to remains (They invited us to stay 
and we agreed to).
Factual verbs such as believe, consider, know, report, suppose also take NG + 
to-infinitive as a ‘raised object’ alternative 2 to a that-clause complement 1 (→ 37.4). 
Passive forms are common in formal styles 3: 
1	
People consider that he is a great actor. 
2	
People consider him to be a great actor. 
3	
He is considered (to be) a great actor.

12.3  MEANINGS EXPRESSED BY BARE INFINITIVE CLAUSES 
12.3.1  Type 4: V + NG + bare infinitive – We let them go 
Typical verbs are: let, have, make; see, hear, feel; help.
Bare-infinitive clauses evoke an event in which an end-point is included, as in 
we let them go, we saw them go. Relatively few verbs occur in this pattern. They include 
three verbs of coercion, illustrated below, a few verbs of perception and the verb help.
Don’t let anxiety spoil your life.
They made the prisoners stand for hours.
I’ll have my secretary make you a reservation.
Syntactically, we analyse the non-finite clause of the make type as an object complement, 
complementing the direct object. Notice the parallel between: She made them angry/ 
She made them sit down.
Analysis of the NG + bare-infinitive complement of perceptual verbs illustrated 
below is more problematic. Is the NG the object of the matrix clause or the subject of 
the non-finite clause? Does the NG + bare infinitive refer to a whole situation, as with 
want?
I saw someone enter the shop late at night.
She felt something hard hit her on the head.
While the ‘whole situation’ view appears to be semantically acceptable, ‘I saw someone 
enter the shop’ entails ‘I saw someone’, this entailment not being the case with the 
want type. Syntactically, the NG is the object of the matrix clause and is also the subject 
of the bare-infinitive clause.
Some of the clauses of coercion and perception (but not with causative have, or 
with feel) can be passivised, with the NG as subject and the bare infinitive replaced by 
a to-infinitive, as in: The prisoners were made to stand for hours, Someone was seen to 
enter the shop. Let is usually replaced by allow (They were allowed to go). In this respect 
we find the same divisibility of the NG as occurs with the ‘ask’ type.
It is notoriously difficult to pin down the difference in meaning between help + 
bare infinitive and help + to-infinitive. One analysis sees the bare infinitive as direct or 
active involvement in bringing about the action expressed by the infinitive, as in: I’ll 
help you carry your luggage upstairs. With help + to, by contrast, the event is seen to 
be the consequence of the helping, and often means ‘contribute to’ rather than active 
involvement by the helper, as in Acupuncture can help people to give up smoking.
12.4  MEANINGS EXPRESSED BY - ING CLAUSES 
Non-finite -ing clauses as complements tend to express factual meanings. Syntactically 
they function as non-prototypical direct objects, following the criteria adopted for 
analysing to-infinitive clauses as objects in 12.2, Type 2.

T H E  D E V E L O P M E N T  O F  T H E  M E S S A G E  
1 0 5
12.4.1  Type 5a: V + -ing clause – I like listening to music 
Verbs of affective stance: like, love, dislike, feel, like, hate, enjoy, miss, mind, resent, 
risk, can’t help.
There are two patterns: (a) with no explicit subject in the –ing clause; and (b) with 
an explicit subject in the –ing clause. 
Type 5a has no explicit subject in the –ing clause. The subject of the main clause is 
implicitly the same as that of the –ing clause
They disliked living in a big city.
I don’t feel like travelling on the Tube in the rush hour.
Type 5 b: V + NG + -ing – We deplore his/him risking his life in 
this way
The –ing clause has an explicit subject. The pronominal subject of the –ing clause may 
be in the objective or the genitive case. The genitive is the more formal:
I hope you don’t mind my/me bringing you a T-shirt with no message on it. 
Common and proper nouns can also take both options , but long NGs and titles tend to 
be awkward, particularly with the genitive: 
Students resent the Minister of Education’s cutting back Erasmus grants.
12.4.2  Type 6: V + NG + -ing clause – I saw them waiting 
Pattern I with verbs of perception and discovery such as see, hear, feel, smell, 
find, leave, catch, discover, come across, keep
The subject of the -ing clause is also the object of the superordinate clause. It can 
become subject in a passive clause. 
They caught him stealing from the till.	
He was caught stealing from the till.
She found the child sleeping peacefully.	
The child was found sleeping peacefully.
Note that verbs of starting, stopping and continuing among others, when followed by 
either to-infinitive or -ing clauses, are analysed in this book not as lexical verbs followed 
by a complement, but as concatenated verbal groups that express aspectual meanings 
such as ingressive, egressive and continuative (→ 39.2), as in He started smoking at the 
age of fifteen.
Pattern 2 with verbs of retrospection such as regret, remember and forget (but 
not recall, which takes only -ing) mark a difference of time reference in relation to the 
main verb. With a to-infinitive clause, the action expressed is seen as following the 
mental process of remembering or forgetting, whereas an -ing form marks the action 
as previous to the mental process: 

1 0 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
I remembered to turn off the gas.	
(I remembered that I had to turn off the gas 
	
  and I did.)
I remembered turning off the gas.	
(I remembered that I had turned off the 
gas.) I forgot to turn off the gas.	
(I forgot that I had to turn off the gas and
	
  didn’t turn it off.)
I regret telling/having told you the	
(I am sorry that I told you the bad news.)
  bad news.
I regret to tell you there is some bad	
(I am sorry to have to tell you bad news.)
  news.
Regret + to-infinitive is always followed by a verb of communication – say, tell, announce, 
inform – used with present time reference. Both the regretting and the telling occur at 
the moment of speaking, whereas regret + -ing has no such limitation (She regretted 
going out without an umbrella).
12.4.3  Potential and factual meanings contrasted: to-infinitive 
and -ing clauses 
Because the to-infinitive looks forward to the event, it tends to be used when a specific 
occasion is referred to, often of a future or hypothetical kind, as in I would like to go to 
Paris. An -ing clause, by contrast, expressing factual meanings, as in I like going to Paris, 
entails that I have been to Paris, whereas I would like to go to Paris does not.
Emotive verbs such as like, love, hate and prefer (but not enjoy, detest and dislike, 
which admit only -ing clauses) can establish this distinction clearly.
I like listening to music.	
I’d like to buy a good stereo.
Most people hate standing in queues.	
Most car-owners would hate to be without 
	
  a car.
For many speakers, however, the to-infinitive is a valid alternative in the expression of 
factual meanings, especially with a notion of habit: I like to cook for my friends.
12.5  PAST PARTICIPIAL CLAUSES 
12.5.1  Type 7: V + NG + -en clause – We’ll get it mended 
These are S-V-Od-Co structures with a past participal complement. They are controlled 
by four types of verb:
•	
the causative verbs get and have	
–	
We’ll have some repairs done to the house,
•	
volitional verbs: want, like, prefer	
–	
The boss wants these records updated;
•	
verbs of perception: see, hear, feel	
–	
I felt my arm grasped from behind; and
•	
verbs of finding and leaving	
–	
Airport officials have found an unidenti­
fied bag abandoned in the coffee-shop.

SPEECH ACTS AND	
UNIT 13
CLAUSE TYPES	
SUMMARY
1 	 Speech acts are the acts we perform through words. Certain general types 
of speech act are basic to everyday interaction; these are statements, ques­
tions, exclamations and directives, the latter covering orders, requests and 
instructions among others.
2 	 Each of these basic speech acts is associated in the grammar with a type 
of clause: the declarative is typically used to encode a statement, the inter­
rogative a question, the imperative a directive and the exclamative an 
exclamation. These are the direct correspondences between form and func­
tion that we refer to as direct speech acts.
3 	 Indirect correspondences are also common in English. Thus declaratives, 
as well as encoding statements, can be used to ask questions, utter excla­
mations and issue directives, in addition to other speech acts such as prom­
ising and warning. In such cases the form is used to convey an ‘intended 
meaning’ or ‘illocutionary force’ that is different from its basic one. You’re 
staying here, then? has the form of a declarative – but, with appropriate 
intonation, the force is that of a question, as is indicated by the punctua­
tion. The relationship between clause type and force is therefore not one-
to-one but many-to-many.
4 	 Even more indirectly, the words we use do not always fully express our 
intended speech act. For example, It’s cold in here might be intended, 
and interpreted, as a request to turn up the heating. Hearers use infer­
ence to recover the intended meaning at specific points in a conversation, 
based on assumptions of cooperativeness, truth, relevance and cultural 
knowledge.

13.1  THE BASIC CORRESPONDENCES
When we speak or write to each other, we perform acts through words, such as thank­
ing and promising. These are ‘speech acts’. Certain general types of speech act are 
very basic, in that most, if not all, languages have ways of representing them by means 
of the grammar. These are statements, questions, exclamations and directives.
These basic speech acts are encoded in the grammar in the system of clause types 
or moods, as shown in the diagram below. The indicative is the grammatical category 
typically used for the exchange of information, in contrast to the imperative, which 
grammaticalises our acting on others to get things done by requesting, ordering and so 
on. The exclamative grammaticalises the expression of emotion.
declarative
polar (yes/no)
indicative
imperative
interrogative
independent 
clause
exclamative
non-polar (wh-)
Interrogative clauses can be either polar (yes/no interrogatives) or non-polar (wh- 
interrogatives). These are discussed in Unit 14.
The basic correspondences between clause types and speech acts are summarised 
as follows:
Clause type
Basic speech act
Example
Declarative
Interrogative (yes/no)
Interrogative (wh-)
Exclamative

Figure 4.2  Correspondence between clause types and speech acts.
The traditional term ‘command’ is nowadays applicable only in contexts of great ine­
quality and power such as the military. The term directive is used instead in everyday 
environments, to cover such acts as requests, prohibitions and instructions, as well as 
orders and commands.

13.2  DIRECT AND INDIRECT SPEECH ACTS: WHAT THE 
UTTERANCE ‘COUNTS AS’
It is important to separate the concepts of statement, question and directive, which 
are semantic-pragmatic categories of meaning in use, from the grammatical catego­
ries of declarative, interrogative and imperative, which are typically associated with 
them. When a clause type is used to carry out the speech act typically associated 
with it, it is considered to be a direct speech act. Thus, in a direct speech act the 
declarative is said to have the illocutionary force of a statement, an interroga­
tive has the force of a question, an imperative has the force of a directive, and an 
exclamative has the force of an exclamation. The force is the speaker’s ‘intended 
meaning’ at that particular point in the discourse. The table shows this basic or typi­
cal correspondence between the two sets of categories; and in the following invented 
dialogue based on an advertisement, each clause type in the independent clauses 
realises its typical speech act:
Is that you Dan? Geoff here.
Hi, Geoff.
Has the board reached a conclusion?2
They’ve decided to launch the product,3 if the terms are right.
How do ours compare?4
Very well. But are you sure you can put up the necessary capital?5
We’ve got a huge loan from the Bank of England.6
In that case, let’s go.7
Have we got the deal, then?8
You’ve got it.9
Fantastic. How soon do you expect to be able to sign?10
1interrog./question; 2interrog./question; 3declar./statement; 4interrog./question;
5interrog./question; 6declar./statement; 7imper./directive; 8interrog./question;
9declar./statement; 10interrog./question
In interpersonal interaction, however, the relationship is frequently more
complex – and more flexible. Every clause type can carry out different speech acts. 
When a clause type has any other but its typical force, we consider it an indirect 
speech act. That is, it ‘counts as’ an act different from its typical correspondence.
We can rewrite one of the executives’ utterances so that the correspondence 
between grammatical form and its function is no longer direct: 
So we’ve got the deal, then? 	 (declarative which ‘counts’ as a question)
Looking at it the other way round, our new version of this utterance still ‘counts as’ a 
question, as in the original text, even though it’s expressed by a different clause type. 
Even more indirectly, the words we use do not always express the full meaning of our 
intended act, as we can see in the following familiar situational dialogue:

1 1 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
A.	 The door-bell’s ringing.
B.	 I’m in the bath.
A. 	 Okay, I’ll go.
A’s first utterance is to be interpreted as a directive to B: ‘Answer the door’. B’s utter­
ance counts as a statement explaining why she can’t answer the door (‘I’m in the bath’), 
at the same time implying that A should answer the door. A’s second utterance shows 
that he has inferred the implied request and will comply with it. Notice that neither 
participant has made specific reference to answering the door.
In this chapter we shall be more concerned with the first type of indirect corre- 
spondence, the relationship between grammatical form and pragmatic meaning. In 
interpersonal interaction, however, especially in conversation, the second type – ‘not 
saying exactly what you mean’ and expecting the addressee to infer your meaning – is 
also extremely common in English.
The motivation for using indirect speech acts is often that of tact, politeness or 
simply economy of effort. Assuming that speakers are cooperative and make their 
utterances relevant, hearers use inference in order to recover the intended meaning. 
For instance, a colleague’s question on leaving the office Have you come by car today? 
may lead the addressee to infer that the colleague is politely requesting to be given a 
lift. Inference is also based on cultural knowledge, for example, that people who have 
cars often give lifts to those who don’t.
In inferring the speaker’s meaning, the situational context is all-important, as is the 
relationship between speaker and hearer. In different situations, or at different points in 
a conversation, any one utterance may take on a different pragmatic force. If an explo­
sion has just been heard in the car-park, Have you come by car today? will suggest a very 
different intended meaning, perhaps that of a warning, or a suggestion to go and see 
what has happened. As in other areas of the grammar, a form can fulfil more than one 
function, and a function can be fulfilled by more than one form. There is no one-to-one 
relationship between form and function.
It is not always possible to make a clear-cut distinction between one type of indi­
rect speech act and another. Sit over here by me may be a request or an invitation, or a 
combination of the two. Similarly, Geoff’s response We’ve got a massive loan from the 
Bank of England is at once a statement and an assurance in answer to Dan’s somewhat 
anxious question. This indeterminacy of pragmatic meaning is not, in general, a dis- 
advantage, as it allows the interlocutors in a situation to negotiate the outcome of any 
one utterance as they go along.

THE DECLARATIVE AND	
UNIT 14
INTERROGATIVE CLAUSE TYPES	
SUMMARY
1 	 Syntactically, the five clause types are distinguished in English by the presence 
or absence of Subject and the ordering of Subject (S) and a finite verb (F). The 
rest of the clause remains the same. The Finite is realised by a primary verb (am, 
is, are, was, were, has, had ), a modal verb (can, must, etc.) or a tensed lexical 
verb (sells, sold, etc.), and is the first or only element of the verbal group.
2 	 The declarative is the basic clause type, with Subject-Finite ordering (It is 
ready, I can swim, Ice melts). Interrogative and negative clauses in English 
require a finite operator. The primary verbs be and have, and the modal 
verbs (can, will, etc.) function as finite operators, carrying inversion (Is it 
ready? Can you swim?), polarity (the positive–negative distinction) – as 
in It is ready vs It isn’t ready – and emphasis (I am ready). If there is no 
primary or modal verb in the clause, a form of do is used as operator (Does 
she smoke? She doesn’t smoke).
3 	 Interrogative structures in English are of two main types: yes/no (polar) and 
wh- (non-polar), the latter with a preceding wh-element. Both have Finite-Subject 
ordering except when Who is Subject (Who said that?). A sub-type, the alterna­
tive interrogative, consists of two polar interrogatives joined by or (Do you want 
it or don’t you?). The wh- words ending in – ever act as intensifiers (Whatever 
do you mean?), as do more colloquial items (What the devil . . .).
4 	 Echo questions repeat all or part of a previous speaker’s utterance (We 
leave at 5 a.m. – 5a.m?). Double interrogatives consist of one interrogative 
embedded within another (Do you know what time it is?), the answer being 
pragmatically determined.
5 	 Abbreviated clauses (I can’t, Is it? You did? (AmE) ) are independent ellipted 
clauses based on Subject–operator and operator – Subject patterns. They 
are commonly used as short interactive responses after questions, state­
ments, exclamations and directives.

1 1 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
6 	 Question tags are also abbreviated yes/no interrogatives. They are not 
independent, but appended to a main clause. There are two types in BrE, 
reversed and constant, distinguished by polarity and, in part, intonation. 
A third type, the copy tag, is common in AmE. Invariant tags include right 
and okay. Like other ellipted forms, tags are an important interactive device 
in spoken English.
14.1  CLAUSE TYPES AND THE MOOD ELEMENT:
SUBJECT-FINITE VARIATION
In English, the declarative, interrogative and imperative moods of a clause are dis­
tinguished syntactically by variation in one part of the clause, the Subject (S) and the 
Finite (F), while the rest of the predicate remains unchanged. Variation consists in 
the presence or absence of Subject and the ordering of the two elements, as sum­
marised in the table below. These different syntactic variations are referred to as 
‘clause types’:

Figure 4.3  Clause types and the ordering of the subject and finite. 
14.2 THE DECLARATIVE CLAUSE TYPE
The declarative is the basic clause type, with Subject-Finite ordering, as in:
Subject
Finite
Predicator
1
We
are
meeting
again tomorrow.
[AON]
2
You
might
need
a holiday.
[AYP]
The Finite, specified for tense or modality, is always the first or only element of a ver­
bal group → (chapters 1 and 8). It is realised by either a verbal operator (was, will, 
has, etc.), as in 1 and 2, or a tensed (past or present) form of the lexical verb, as in 4 
and 5. The primary verbs function both as operators 1 and as main verbs 3: 

I N T E R A C T I O N :  S P E E C H  A C T S  
1 1 9
Subject
Finite
Predicator
3
We
are
late again.
4
She
arrives
tomorrow.
5
They
sell
fish and chips here.
More exactly, in positive declarative clauses, Finite and Predicator fuse in the present 
and past tensed forms of lexical verbs and of be and have when used as main verbs. The 
operator is always realised by a verb: primary, modal or do, as explained and illustrated 
in 3.1.
The Finite element relates the proposition to a point of reference: either a time 
reference, by tense, or the speaker’s judgement by means of modality, as discussed in 
Chapters 8 and 9.
14.3  INTERROGATIVE CLAUSES, NEGATION AND THE
DO-OPERATOR
In interrogative clauses, the Finite verb precedes the Subject, the rest remaining the 
same.
Finite
Subject
Predicator
Are
We
meeting
again tomorrow?
Do
you
need
a holiday?
Does
She
expect
us soon?
Did
They
emigrate
to Australia after all?
When no operator is already available in the clause, a form of do (do, does, did) is 
brought in as a dummy operator. That is, it has no semantic value but simply fulfils 
the syntactic requirement of ‘finite operator’ (→ 3.1.1), as illustrated in the last three 
examples. The functions of the operators that interest us here are, first, that they signal 
by position that the clause is interrogative, and second, they carry polarity, that is, 
they are either positive or negative. This positive–negative contrast is an essential 
semantic feature associated with finiteness. In order to be affirmed or denied, a propo­
sition has to be either positive or negative.
Negation, as we saw in 3.2, is usually expressed by the negative particle not, 
which follows the operator or is joined to it as n’t. Note that the negative interrogative 
with 1st person singular ‘I’ is not *amn’t but aren’t in Standard English. Other excep­
tions include can’t, won’t and shan’t. (Operators also function in question tags, both
positive and negative, as illustrated here and discussed with further examples shortly; 
→ Chapter 8.)

[HTR]
Interrogative clauses typically occur in interpersonal situations, and their direct 
speech- act function or force is to ask for information. There are two main types of 
interrogative, the yes/no type and the wh-type. The examples we have seen so far are 
of the yes/no type.
14.4 YES/NO INTERROGATIVES AND THEIR RESPONSES
In the yes/no type it is only the polarity that is in question. The speaker asks for con­
firmation or denial of the clause content, to be expressed by yes or no. Such minimal 
replies often sound rather abrupt, however:
A.	 Do you sell fish fingers?
B.	
No.
A.	 At all? You don’t?	
[KBC] 
	
(B’s first response overlaps with A’s question; B’s reply might be):
B.	
You can get them from the supermarket.
A feature of spoken English is the use of ellipted responses such as Yes, it is, No, we 
don’t, I can’t, has he? based on the Subject-operator (declarative) and operator-Subject 
(interrogative) patterns. These are independent abbreviated clauses. They are used 
in response to questions, statements, exclamations and directives. They show more 
interest and involvement than a mere Yes or No, and even more than mere silence! In 
conversation they keep the talk alive by passing the turn from one speaker to another:
A.	 Always drunk isn’t he?	
	
	
B.	
He’s a sweet old man though. 
A.	 Is he?
B.	
Gets me nice birthday presents.
A.	 Does he?
B.	
Mm.	
[KBL]

I N T E R A C T I O N :  S P E E C H  A C T S  
1 2 1
A common variant in AmE is the ‘copy tag’ with rising intonation, such as He does? 
This replaces A’s Does he? in the previous exchange. It is not common in BrE, although 
it resembles the BrE echo question. This repeats part, or all, of an immediately preced­
ing utterance by another speaker. The motivation for using echoes is that the hearer did 
not comprehend, found difficult to believe, or did not hear properly what had been said:
I’m going to sell my golf clubs. 	
Sell them?
What did you say to him? 	
What did I say to him? 
In interactive situations, in fact, a wide range of responses occurs, as speakers often 
express greater or less certainty about the proposition:
Have you got any stamps?
No, I don’t think I have, in fact I know I haven’t. 	
[KCX]
14.5  ALTERNATIVE INTERROGATIVES 
Alternative interrogatives also start with an operator, like the yes/no type, but yes or 
no is no longer an appropriate answer. Instead, one of the two alternatives presented 
in the question is expected to be chosen, but again, variants are possible, as shown in 
B’s answers: 
A	
Do you study for enjoyment or to advance your career? 	
[BNA] 
B	
– For enjoyment
	
– To advance my career
	
– Both 
14.6  WH-INTERROGATIVES
Wh-interrogatives contain an element of missing information which is embodied in the 
wh-word. What the speaker is seeking in this type of interrogative is the identity of that 
element. The rest is presupposed, that is, taken as given. For instance, What do you 
want? presupposes that you want something. The wh-word can fill a syntactic function 
of the clause or be part of a group or phrase.

[BNA] 

1 2 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
There is one exception to the Finite-Subject order in wh-interrogative clauses. This is 
when the wh-element itself functions as subject or as part of a NG at subject: 
Subject
F/P
Who
Which glass
told
got
you that?
broken?
(determinative in NG) 
The functional motivation for the ordering of interrogatives in English is that whatever is ques­
tioned comes first. If it is the polarity that is questioned, the finite operator comes first. If it is 
the identity of an unknown element, a wh-element comes first, followed by the Finite-Subject 
ordering. If the unknown element is the Subject, that (in the form of a wh-element), comes first.
This means that, basically, the entire interrogative system in English has Finite- 
Subject ordering, except when the Subject’s identity is itself questioned.
Note that, in some languages, interrogative inversion is that of the Subject and the 
whole verbal group, as in Spanish ¿Ha llegado Pedro? We must be aware that this vari­
ation is ungrammatical in English (*Has arrived Peter?), except with primary verbs (be 
and have) in simple tenses. Compare: Has Peter a bicycle? is possible, but *Has had Peter 
lunch? is ungrammatical. Furthermore, certain languages rely on intonation to express 
a question, using only the declarative form. This is also possible in English (→ 26.4) but 
it does not regularly replace the use of the interrogative structures.
The following dialogue between two friends illustrates declarative clauses and the 
two main interrogative types. Finite elements are italicised:
So what did you do at the weekend, Janet?
Well, Jeff and I went off to Whitby to visit our in-laws. We took the dog with us and 
we all ended up having a walk along the beach.
Can you walk right along the cliffs to Robin Hood’s Bay?
I think you probably could do, but it’s quite dangerous. You can get through occa­
sionally when the tide’s out, but it doesn’t stay out for very long and you can get caught.
(authors’ data)
The combination of a wh-interrogative word with -ever acts as an intensifier expressing 
the surprise, perplexity or disbelief of the speaker. Why ever is often spelt as two words, 
the other items as either one or two:
Whoever would believe such a story?
Wherever did you hear that?
Why ever didn’t he let us know he was coming?
Alternatively, wh-interrogative words can be intensified informally by certain lexi­
cal items which include on earth, in the world, and other more marked colloquialisms 
including semi-taboo words, such as the devil, the hell. 
Why on earth didn’t you get in touch?
(→ 3.1 and Unit 16 for negative-interrogatives.)

14.7  DOUBLE INTERROGATIVES: QUESTIONS WITHIN 
QUESTIONS 
We saw in 11.3 that a yes/no question can have a wh-interrogative as object, produc­
ing a question within a question, as in Do you know what time it is?, (not *Do you know 
what time is it?) Pragmatically, there are two possible interpretations involved in this 
case: (a) whether the addressee knows the answer to the wh-question; and (b) the 
content embodied in the wh-element. The intention of the speaker, together with the 
context, will favour one or other in importance. For example, if the addressee is slowly 
packing a suitcase to catch a train (a) ‘knowing the time’ is likely to be more important. 
On the other hand, if the speaker’s watch has stopped, (b) ‘the time is x’ is likely to be of 
greater interest to the speaker. The force is different too. In (a) Do you know what time 
it is? has the force of a polite reminder, while in (b) it will be interpreted as a request.
14.8  QUESTION TAGS
Question tags are not independent clauses, but they do require a response, and are 
highly interactive. Structurally, tags are abbreviated yes/no interrogatives consisting 
of an operator (either positive or negative) and a pronoun, which repeats the subject 
or substitutes for it. Question tags are attached to one of the following clause types:
a declarative clause: 	
It was quiet in there, wasn’t it?
an exclamative clause:	
How quiet it was in there, wasn’t it?
an imperative clause: 	
Be quiet for a moment, will you?
Of these, the declarative is by far the most common. The tag is usually placed at the 
end, 1–5, but sometimes in the middle, 6: 
1 	 Ben is in South Africa, isn’t he?
2 	 He isn’t with Gordon, is he?
3 	 You live in Hammersmith, don’t you?
4 	 You don’t live in Chelsea, do you?
5 	 It doesn’t really matter, does it?
6 	 It’s easy, isn’t it, to get into the habit? 
14.9  FEATURES OF THE MAIN TYPES OF TAG
There are two main types of declarative mood tag, distinguished by polarity sequence. 
Type 1 tag has opposite polarity to that of the main clause. That is, if the main clause 
is positive, the tag is negative, and vice versa, as in the examples so far.
There is either rising or falling intonation on the tag. A rising tone on the tag 
indicates doubt, and so the meaning is ‘Am I right?’ If however the intonation is falling, 
it expresses greater certainty, so that the meaning of the tag is more like ‘I’m asking 
you to confirm this’ and simply seeks agreement.
The Type 2 tag has constant polarity, that is, the same as the main clause. It occurs 
mostly in combinations of positive declarative clauses with positive tags. Type 2 tags 

1 2 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
typically have a rising tone on the tag, and the statement is often preceded by a dis­
coursemarker, such as Oh, So or Well now, which indicates that the speaker is express­
ing a conclusion or inference drawn from the situation or from what has been said 
before. The effect is often emotive and can either express an agreeable surprise or else 
sound pejorative, depending on the implication. 
Oh, so you’re the new assistant, are you?
Oh so that’s what she said, is it?
Well now, this is the Norman chapel, is it?
You found the address, did you?
A third type of tag is the copy tag, introduced in 14.4 as He does? It is declarative in 
form and is used with rising intonation as a response showing interest or involvement, 
mainly in AmE:
	
A	
(driver leans out of his window addressing the driver of another car) 
	
I think I’ve lost my way. 
B	
You do? / You have?
BrE	would prefer Have you? 
James Saunders’ parody of a doctor in Over the Wall contains a number of positive tags: 
Falling hair, loss of weight, gain of weight, tenseness, got a drink problem have you, 
smoking too much, hallucinations, palpitations, eructations, on drugs are you, can you 
read the top line, overdoing it at work perhaps, worrying about the work, about the 
spouse, about where to go for your holiday, about the mortgage, about the value of the 
pound, about the political situation, about your old mother, about the kids, kids playing 
up are they, not doing well at school, got a drink problem have they, smoking, on drugs 
are they, suffering from loss of weight, falling hair, got any worries have you?
Yes!
In both types of question tag, the pronoun in the tag is co-referential with the subject; 
the operator, not the pronoun, carries the tonic stress.
There is a third, very useful, common variant, heard mainly in women’s speech, 
illustrated by the following example: 
Ooh! I love squirrels, don’t you? 	
[KBW] 
Here the pronouns are not co-referential. The sentence subject is invariably I and that 
of the tag, you. It is you, not the operator, that carries the tonic stress, marking a con­
trast with the 1st person, the speaker. The tag invites the addressee to agree or disa­
gree with the speaker’s opinion.
When a clausal fragment such as I think or I suppose introduces an embedded clause 
that encodes the main propositional content of the sentence, the tag refers to the 
embedded clause, not to the clausal fragment (→ 36.2). The stance expression can be 
placed parenthetically: 

I N T E R A C T I O N :  S P E E C H  A C T S  
1 2 5
I think he left before lunch, didn’t he? (not *don’t I?)
(He left, I think, before lunch, didn’t he?)
Indefinite human singular pronouns take they in the tag: 
Everybody seemed to enjoy themselves, didn’t they?
Nobody will agree to that, will they?
Somebody should be told, shouldn’t they?
The discourse function of tags following declaratives is to seek confirmation or
agreement with the previous statement and to keep the conversation going. Tags are 
questions and so require an answer. They enable the speaker to elicit a response from 
the hearer, where a tagless declarative or imperative would not necessarily achieve this 
end. Together with abbreviated clauses and fragments as short responses, tags provide 
the main structural-functional devices for furthering speaker-hearer involvement.
With certain speech act functions, such as good wishes and warnings, a question tag 
is not used. Instead, other forms such as the following are used, in which the adverbs 
do not have their normal ideational value: 
See you later, then!	
Have a good journey, then!
That plate is hot, mind	
Look out, there! 	
Come on, now! 
14.10  INVARIANT QUESTION TAGS
Invariant tags are those such as Right? 1 and okay?, which are not derived from the 
structure of the main clause. Like other tags, Right?seeks confirmation or agreement 
from the addressee. Right and okay, however, also function (like all right) as responses 
indicating agreement or compliance, and also as discourse markers to call attention 
and initiate an action 3: 
1
Getting over a cold, right?
[KBF] 
2
. . . whenever you want to read there, you can do that.
Okay right right.
[KCV] 
3
Right, er, let’s have a look then
 [KB3] 
The form innit, (in n t AmE) originally derived from isn’t it, is used in popular, non-
standard speech as a tag appended to a declarative 4. In the vernacular it is also used 
as a negative interrogative main verb and a question tag, in the same sentence 5. 
Furthermore, in some communities it is becoming a generalised tag 6 . However, it is 
highly stigmatised in all its uses and is avoided by speakers of Standard English.  
4
It’s a nice pattern innit?
[KB8] 
5
Ah innit lovely innit?
[KBE] 
6
You know our life story innit?
[KCS] 

THE EXCLAMATIVE AND	
UNIT 15
IMPERATIVE CLAUSE TYPES	
SUMMARY
1 	 Exclamative clauses open with a wh- element what or how, followed by 
a NG or adjective/adverb, respectively. Like the declarative, they have 
Subject-Finite ordering. Exclamative what is a determinative (What a 
mess!), while how functions as a degree adverb (How strange it was!), 
unlike pronominal what and manner adverb how in wh- interrogatives 
(What is it? How is she?). They are used to make exclamative statements.
2 	 The imperative consists of the base form of the verb alone, without modals, 
tense or aspect (Stop!). This can be preceded by the negative form don’t or 
emphatic do. There is no overt subject, but a 2nd person subject (stressed 
you) can be added, usually for purposes of contrast with another person 
(You sit down and I’ll stand). Somebody, everybody, nobody can also 
be used and, like you, refer to the addressee(s). These, and other forms, 
can also be used as vocatives. A polite clause tag is will you? Let’s is the 
imperative particle used for a 1st person imperative, typically suggesting a 
joint action. It is to be distinguished from the lexical verb let, from which it 
derived. The unmarked function of imperatives is to issue a directive.
3 	 Reduced clauses are extremely common in spoken English and fulfil
an important interactive function. They include abbreviated clauses (basi­
cally S-F or F-S in structure) that function independently, question tags, 
verbless clauses of various degrees of ellipsis, echoes, and freestanding 
subordinate clauses (which it does). In this unit we refer mainly to the typi­
cal speech act associated with each clause type.
4 	 The subjunctive is not a clause type but a verb form. It remains outside the 
system of clause types and has a very limited use in British English, rather 
more in American English. 

I N T E R A C T I O N :  S P E E C H  A C T S  
1 2 7
15.1  THE EXCLAMATIVE
The exclamative clause type starts with a wh- word, either the determinative what, 
followed by a nominal group or the degree adverb how and an adjective, adverb or 
statement:
Wh- element
What a shock	
they’ll have!
What a mess	
we have made.	
[GI6] 
How dark	
it is!
How	
it snowed! 
Exclamatives have the Subject-Finite ordering that is characteristic of the declarative; 
the element following the wh- word is a clause constituent which has been brought 
to the front of the clause. For these reasons exclamative clauses are sometimes
considered as an emotive element superimposed on the declarative rather than as a 
distinct mood.
The declarative clauses corresponding to these examples are as follows: 
They’ll have a shock.
We’ve made a mess.
It is dark.
It snowed. 
How-exclamative clauses can sound somewhat theatrical nowadays, especially when 
followed by an adverb (How well he played!). More commonly heard than clausal 
exclamatives in everyday spoken English are abbreviated noun-headed or adjective- 
headed forms.
Embedded (or indirect) exclamatives occur regularly in both spoken and written 
English. We refer to them in 11.3.4 under wh- complements, and simply illustrate them 
here: 
You wouldn’t believe how badly the prisoners were treated. 
15.2  THE IMPERATIVE
The most striking feature of an imperative clause is that it requires no overt Subject in 
English. In this it differs sharply from the other clause types: 
Be careful!
Come on! Hurry up! 

1 2 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
The subject is pragmatically understood to be the addressee, and this is confirmed 
by the presence of a reflexive pronoun (yourself, yourselves) 1, a question tag (will you)
2 or by a vocative (you, you people, you guys, used to address women as well as men) 
3, 6. Stressed you positioned immediately before the imperative is usually interpreted 
as subject, and is typically used to mark a contrast with the speaker or a 3rd person 4. 
Subject and vocative are less distinct when realised by someone 7, everyone, or a NG 
such as passengers on flight IB580 to Vigo 8 preceding the verb. They could be either 
subject or vocative, or even merge. Both are optional and both refer to the addressees, 
representing either all or a sub-set of those persons present in the speech situation. 
When placed in final position 1, a pronoun or NG would normally be considered a 
vocative.
1
Help yourselves, everyone!
2
Be quiet, will you!
3
Shut up, you two!
4
You stay here and I’ll get the tickets.
5
6
Hey Helena calm down!
Come on, you guys, the movie will be starting soon.
[KCE]
[KCE]
7
Someone call an ambulance!
8
Passengers on flight number IB580 to Vigo please proceed to gate number 17.
Vocatives are able to occupy various positions, typically final 3, but also medial 6 and 
initial, often preceded by an attention-getter 5. Common vocatives are first names, 
Johnny, Pat, kinship names Mum(BrE)/Mom(AmE), Grandad, endearments darling, love, 
honey, pet, pronoun you + noun you guys, surnames and titles, Mr Roberts, and (now 
less common) honorifics madam, sir. Vocatives fulfil important interpersonal functions 
in getting some- one’s attention, singling out one individual among a group and main­
taining relationships, either of a close or friendly nature or, less commonly nowadays, 
marking distance and respect.
As these examples illustrate, imperatives typically encode directives, which range 
from orders 2, 3 to encouragement 6, urgent request 7, invitation 1 and instructions 
8 (→ 27.1).
The following exchange between two women friends was overheard on the London 
Underground when a seat became vacant. Two functions of you occur; as subject of an 
imperative and as vocative after an imperative: 
A1	 Sit down!
B2	 No, you sit down!
A3	 You’re the one with the feet.
B4	 So are you. You sit down!
A5	 Sit down with the feet, you!
You in B2 and B4 subject of imperative. You in A5 vocative after an imperative.

I N T E R A C T I O N :  S P E E C H  A C T S  
1 2 9
15.2.1  The verb in the imperative 
Another important structural feature of the imperative is that it uses the base form of 
the verb, with no modals or tense-aspect forms. This is shown by the use of be in Be 
careful ! (not *are (being) careful, *can be careful). The grammatical status of the base 
form as a non-finite is somewhat problematic, however. It does not share functions 
with other non-finite verb forms; rather, the imperative has more in common, function­
ally, with finites than with the non-finites. Like interrogatives, it relates the speaker to 
the hearer and to the here-and-now, typically in face-to-face interaction.
Because the base form is indistinguishable from some declarative forms, there 
is potentially structural ambiguity between an imperative with a you-subject and 
a declarative. This is disambiguated only in speech, by stress on the imperative 
subject:
A	
How do we get tickets for this show?
B	
You go and stand in the queue/ AmE in line. (unstressed, declarative, use of 
‘generic’ you = ‘one’)
A	
What shall we do, then?
B	
You go and stand in the queue while I park the car. (stressed, imperative)
There is, however, a distinction between declarative and imperative when the verb 
is be, as in role-taking. This is because be has retained different forms for person and 
tense (am, is, are). Compare:
You be the doctor and I’ll be the nurse. (imperative)
You’re the doctor and I’m the nurse. (declarative) 
The declarative 3rd person singular finite form -s avoids ambiguity with a 3rd person 
subject imperative. Note however that please always points to a directive meaning:
Imperative
Declarative
Everybody sit down, please!
No-one say a word!
Everybody sits down.
No-one says a word.
Figure 4.4  Imperative and declarative.
If the Subject is plural, the verb form is the same in both types, but intonation, pause, 
gesture and common sense serve to clarify the meaning in a specific context. 
Ticket-holders (pause) come this 	
Ticket-holders come this way.
way!
Those in agreement (pause) raise 	
Those in agreement raise their hands.
their hands!

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
15.2.2  Negative and emphatic imperatives 
Don’t (placed before a subject) and do are used to negate or emphasise 2nd person 
imperatives, respectively. (To some speakers, do sounds rather old-fashioned now.)
Negative & 
emphasis
Subject
Base/Predicator

Don’t
Don’t
Do
You
you
be
be
speak
keep
careful, now!
silly!
to me like that!
still, Pat!
Figure 4.5  Negative and emphasis.
15.2.3  Let’s and Let us 
Another feature of the imperative in English is the use of let’s to form a 1st person plural 
imperative with the implicit Subject we. Its typical use is to suggest or urge a collabora­
tive action that includes both speaker and addressee(s). It is also used, however, as a 
disguised order by speakers in authority, as in the third example. The tag question used 
with 1st person imperatives is Shall we?
Let’s take a few photos, shall we? 
Let’s go home, shall we?
Let’s have some silence now! 
Let’s is historically derived from let us and in very formal settings, including church 
services, the unabbreviated form is heard:
Let us pray.
Let us consider the possible alternatives. 
It may be that let’s is beginning to function as an unanalysed pragmatic particle, as in 
non-standard let’s you and I do it. The negative form of let’s is let’s not, although don’t 
let’s is also heard: 
Let’s not waste any more time.	
[AMB]
Oh, don’t let’s talk about it, Len.	
[GVT] 
Let’s is not to be confused with the normal imperative of the lexical verb let meaning 
permit, allow, as in: 
Let me do it!      Let me help you. 

I N T E R A C T I O N :  S P E E C H  A C T S  
1 3 1
As an illustration of the differences between the particle let and lexical let (= allow), compare: 
Let’s go and see that new film!	
(particle let)
Please let us go and see that new film.	
(lexical let)
Let’s go! (let as particle)
Let us go! (lexical verb let)
Us = I + you
Pronoun us reduced to ’s
No subject pronoun can be added
The tag is shall we?
The verb is not ellipted
us = me + other(s)
Pronoun us not reduced
2nd person subject you can be added:
You let us go!
The tag is will you?/can’t you?
Phrasal verb is ellipted with verbs of
direction: Let us in/out (= come/go in/out)
Figure 4.6  Let’s and Let us.
Obviously, both uses of let can occur in the same clause, as in Let’s let them in now. The 
pragmatic particle let can also introduce a wish (the optative mood) as in Let there be 
light and is used only in formal registers (for inclusive and exclusive we/us, (→ 45.7.1).
15.3  VERBLESS AND FREESTANDING SUBORDINATE
CLAUSES
Spoken English and genres which imitate it are rich in ellipsis and reduced forms in gen­
eral. We have already seen examples of abbreviated clauses, echo questions and tags.
Verbless clauses 
We use the term ‘verbless clause’ to cover ellipted clauses which lack one or more 
structural elements: Subject and Finite verb 1, 2, 3, 5, Finite verb 4. They therefore 
lack the alternative orderings characteristic of abbreviated clauses. Some can take 
question tags, however, with either rising or falling intonation. Without a tag, intona­
tion indicates the force of a statement, question or exclamation. 
1 	 (He is) in New York, isn’t he? (question)
2 	 What a waste of time, (it was) wasn’t it! (exclamation)
3 	 (This is) Geoff here. (self-identifying statement on the phone)
4 	 (Are) you ready? (question)
5 	 (It’s) fantastic! (exclamation) 
In conversational exchanges in English, certain wh- questions without a finite verb play 
a part as initiators and responses. They can have the force of an invitation (How about 
some lunch?), an encouraging suggestion (Why not give it another try?), an inquiry (How 
come Sheila’s not with you?) 

1 3 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Freestanding subordinate clauses 
These also are characteristic of ongoing conversation. Two very common types are 
the sentential relative clause introduced by which 1 and clauses of reason introduced 
by because or cos 2 (→ 35.3). The interesting feature is that they are not attached to a 
previous clause, but are freestanding, both intonationally and as regards punctuation. 
Functionally, they reinforce or give the reason for making the previous utterance: 
1 	 and, he said, well with the coal fire and all that, he said, it’ll, it’ll get dirty
	
Mm which it will, won’t it? [KE6] 
2	
Did you see King Lear when it was on on the television? Cos I taped that as 
well. [KDM] 
15.4  THE SUBJUNCTIVE IN ENGLISH
In English, mood has to do with clause types rather than verb inflection. It leaves the 
subjunctive somewhat isolated, since this is not a clause type, but a verb form which in 
present-day British English plays a very marginal role, although it is rather more com­
mon in American English.
As regards the expression of non-factual meaning, the subjunctive has also lost 
ground. In independent clauses the subjunctive can express a wish, but only in fossil­
ised stereotyped expressions like Long live the Queen! So be it, Heaven help us! Far be it 
from me to doubt your word. Even in subordinate clauses, a clearly identifiable present 
subjunctive is limited to the uninflected VG occurring with a 3rd person singular sub­
ject in that-clause complements of certain verbs and adjectives, as in: It is right that this 
House debate this issue. In less formal contexts the indicative or should + infinitive are 
now used by many speakers. (We recommend that he gets/should get a visa.)
A past subjunctive can be identified only in the form were in the 1st and 3rd persons 
singular of be (If I were you . . . If he were to return alive . . .) in subordinate clauses of 
condition and concession, where it is still current in the best usage. Most non-factual 
notions, such as the expression of doubt and hypothesis, are conveyed in English by 
other grammatical means, principally any and its compounds and the modal auxilia­
ries, especially should, could, may and might (→ Unit 44).
One area in which an indicative–subjunctive contrast is made is in a certain type of 
if clause, as in: 
If he was here I didn’t see him. 	
(indicative)
If he were here I would surely see him. 	
(subjunctive) 
Only the second if clause is truly conditional. The first, meaning ‘if it is true that he was 
here’, is rhetorical condition in that his being here is not a condition for my seeing him. 
This is also referred to as pragmatic conjunction (→ 35.3).

INDIRECT SPEECH ACTS,	
UNIT 16
CLAUSE TYPES AND DISCOURSE
FUNCTIONS
SUMMARY
1 	 All language performs acts, but there is no one-to-one correspondence 
between clause type and speech-act function. Here we look at some of the 
indirect correspondences, together with other discourse functions.
2 	 Certain verbs such as promise, advise and warn, when used in the declara­
tive, are potentially explicit performatives, that is they can carry out the act 
they name. This is the case with a 1st person subject and the present tense 
(I promise).
3 	 Exclamations can be made, with appropriate intonation, by all clause 
types, as well as by verbless clauses reduced to a nominal group or an 
adjective.
16.1 PERFORMATIVES AND THE DECLARATIVE
All language in use carries out acts, and this is what distinguishes an utterance from a 
sentence. A sentence is a grammatical object, but when it is used in context what we 
have is an utterance. The meaning of an utterance depends on what it is being used to 
do – what kind of speech act is being performed. 
We have seen that making a statement is the basic function of the declarative. A 
statement describes a state of affairs in the world and has a truth value, which can be 
confirmed, questioned or denied (She is at home; Is she at home? She is not at home). 
Stating something is performing the verbal act of stating. The declarative is unique 
among clause types, however, in its ability to carry out certain acts by naming them. 
These are explicit performatives.

1 3 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
With certain verbs – such as promise, advise and warn – a declarative carries out the 
speech act it names. Such declaratives usually address the hearer directly, as in:  
1
I promise I’ll be careful.
[B3J]
[B3J]
2
We advise you to book early to avoid 
disappointment. 
[AMW]
[AMW]
3
If you insist on staying, I warn you, you’ll 
get no help from me.
[H94]
4
And we have a very good selection of Indian 
restaurants: [HDT] 
I recommend the Kashmir.
That is, the speaker carries out the act of promising, advising, warning and recom- 
mending, respectively. Declaratives such as these don’t have truth value. It makes no 
sense to ask if they are true or false. Instead, we can ask if they work as performatives. 
With a 1st person speaker and present tense, as in I promise I’ll be careful, the performa­
tive is explicit and the speaker is fully accountable as the doer of the speech act. 
As long as the underlying Subject is the speaker or the writer, the passive forms 5, 6, 
or an active form with an impersonal NG Subject 7, have the same effect:
5 	 You are advised to book early to avoid disappointment.
6 	 Passengers are requested to have their boarding cards ready.
7 	 John Lennon Airport apologise for any inconvenience caused to the public dur­
ing building works.
Performatives become less explicit when modalised (with can or must), when intro­
duced by let, want, I’m afraid or when nominalised. They still count as performatives, 
however:
  8	 I can offer you beer, whisky, gin, cola . . . 
  9 	 Let me thank you once more for your collaboration.
10 	My apologies for cross-postings. 
11 	I must beg you not to tell anyone about this.
12 	I am afraid I have to request you to move to another seat.
13 	I wanna thank you all. God bless you. (President George W. Bush to the
	
American people in the aftermath of 11 September 2001)
These ‘hedged’, that is, indirect, forms are felt to be still performing the act named by 
the verb. In addition, they are more polite than direct forms because they avoid invok­
ing power and status. Hearers may perceive them to be more sincere, as is also the 
case with the informal use of wanna instead of want to in the President’s thanks.
Other verbs that can be used as explicit performatives include: agree, bet, congratu­
late, declare, guarantee, object, wish and many others.

I N T E R A C T I O N :  S P E E C H  A C T S  
1 3 5
With pronouns other than I/we, or with past tense or perfect aspect, such verbs 
do not carry out the act they name; instead, they are statements which report a 
speech act:
I offered them beer, whisky, gin, cola . . . 
They have requested passengers to have their boarding cards ready.
You might wonder why we don’t use performatives all the time, if they are so efficient. 
One reason is that not all verbs are potentially performative. For instance, we can’t 
threaten someone in English by saying ‘I threaten you’, nor hint by saying ‘I hint that 
you are wrong’. These acts have to be done indirectly.
A second reason is that explicit performatives sometimes appear to invoke authority 
or status. The power factor is most obvious in ‘ritual performatives’ such as:
Then I declare the meeting closed.	
[GUD] 
I name this ship Aurora. (Authorised person at launching of	
[9W7]
the ship) 
Negative declaratives typically express a negative statement, which may have 
the force of a rejection 1. Negating an explicit performative can have the effect of 
greatly attenuating the force, as in 2, though this is not the case with passives 5. 
Negative declaratives can also express a polite question 3, an exclamation 4 or a 
prohibition 5: 
1 	 I don’t need any more calendars, thank you.
2 	 I don’t promise you that I’ll convince him.
3 	 Bill hasn’t said anything about the weekend?
4 	 I never heard such rubbish!
5 	 Smoking is not allowed in here
With some performatives such as advise, what we have is transferred negation. 
The negative particle not is transferred from its logical place in the dependent 
clause to the main clause (→ 3.6 for other verbs, such as think, which behave this 
way):
I don’t advise you to buy those shares (= I advise you not to buy those shares). 
Certain verbs such as promise and bet are sometimes used performatively to carry out 
a different act from the one they name. Basically, promise carries out acts which benefit 
the addressee, while bet is used to lay a wager. But, in the examples that follow, this 
is not the case: promise is being used to threaten the addressee while bet informally 
expresses strong probability: 
And don’t you dare make fun of me!	
[JXV] 
One sound from you and you won’t make another, I promise you. 
I bet they have their problems, like us.	
[H94]

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
16.2  EXCLAMATIONS
Appropriate intonation can be imposed on any type of unit, including a single word, to 
express an exclamation (Splendid! Gotcha!). [AmE]
With appropriate intonation, all the clause types can be used to make exclamations: 
the exclamative structure 1, 2; an interrogative 3, 4; a declarative 5, 6; an imperative 
7; a verbless clause 8, 9; a nominal group 10: 
Using the exclamative structure:
1 What an idiot he is!
2 How tall you’ve grown!
Using an interrogative
3 Isn’t it a lovely day!
4 Would you believe it! (expressing
disbelief)
Using a declarative
5 You must be joking!
6 You can’t be serious!
Using an imperative
7 Fancy meeting you here!
Using a verbless clause
8 What an idiot!
9 Amazing! Rubbish!
Using a nominal group
10 The trouble I’ve had with Jamie!
Interrogative exclamations, unlike basic exclamatives, call for agreement or disagree­
ment from the hearer: A. Isn’t it a lovely day! B. Yes, it is.
Such, so and other intensifying items such as terribly also confer exclamative force 
on a declarative:
He’s such a bore! 	
It’s so tiring!
It’s terribly hot!	
It was extraordinarily beautiful!

QUESTIONS, CLAUSE TYPES	
UNIT 17
AND DISCOURSE FUNCTIONS	
SUMMARY 
Questions typically seek information from the hearer that the speaker does not 
know. Responding to different motivations are questions functioning as pre­
liminaries, rhetorical questions and leading questions of various types. The 
latter include interrogatives that are biased according to the kind of answer 
the speaker expects, towards a neutral, positive or negative assumption. These 
are marked by non- assertive forms (any), assertive forms (some) and negative 
forms (no, not any), respectively. Positive assumptions allow for positive forms, 
with some even in negative questions. Other leading questions consist of tenta­
tive declaratives with conducive markers and appropriate intonation. Ellipted 
verbless clauses rely heavily for interpretation on intonation and their position 
in the exchange.
The most basic intention in asking questions is to get information that we believe the 
addressee knows. It is not the only one, however. We here refer to two others.
17.1  RHETORICAL QUESTIONS 
Do you expect me to wait here all day?
What could I say?
Why bother?
Rhetorical questions are used to make a comment or an exclamation. A response is 
not expected.
17.2 QUESTIONS AS PRELIMINARIES
In interpersonal interaction the yes/no interrogative is sometimes used as a prelimi­
nary to something else. That is, the question is not so much seeking information as 
serving as a preliminary to an expansion of the speaker’s topic 1 or a veiled request 2:

1 3 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
1	
A.  Have you read this book?
	
B.  No, no.
	
A.  It’s about a plane that crashes in the Andes and no-one comes to their 
rescue
	
2	
A.  Are you going to the hospital this morning?
	
B.  No.
	
A.  Well if you do it’ll give us a chance to find out whether he’s coming home 
today or tomorrow	
[KP1] 
This function of yes/no questions would appear to be the basis of advertisements which 
use this type of interrogative in their text in imitation of speech patterns 
Using a problem-solution schema, something like Ashamed of your mobile/cell phone? 
will be followed by the supposed solution. 
17.3  SOME, ANY AND NEGATIVE FORMS IN BIASED 
QUESTIONS
The questions expressed by yes/no interrogatives are often biased according to the 
kind of answer the speaker expects, and are based on neutral, positive or negative 
assumptions.
If the speaker has a neutral assumption about the answer, non-assertive forms 
(any, anybody, ever, yet, etc. (→ 3.3) will be added to a positive interrogative: 
Do you know anyone in Westminster?
Is the bank open yet?
With a positive assumption, assertive forms (→ 3.3) – some, somebody, always, already, 
too, etc. – are added to the positive interrogative:
Do you know someone in Westminster?
Is the bank open already?
Negative-interrogative yes/no questions are based on conflicting attitudes. The speaker 
had originally expected that the answer would be or should be positive, but new evi­
dence suggests that it will be negative. This conflict produces a feeling of surprise, 
disbelief or disappointment. If the addressee is directly involved, the biased question 
can imply a reproach. In this type of question, nuclear negative forms (→ 3.2) – no, 
nobody, no-one, never, etc. – can be added to a positive interrogative:
Is there no butter? 	
(There should be some butter, but it seems 
there isn’t.)
Do you know no-one in Westminster?	 (You ought to know someone, but it seems 
you don’t.)
Alternatively, non-assertive forms can be added to a negative interrogative: 

I N T E R A C T I O N :  S P E E C H  A C T S  
1 3 9
Isn’t there any butter anywhere (BrE)/anyplace (AmE)?
Don’t you know anyone in Westminster?
Assertive forms can be added to a negative interrogative to reflect a positive bias 
despite an originally negative assumption:
Isn’t there some butter somewhere?	
(It seems there isn’t, but I expect
  there is.)
Don’t you know someone in Westminster? 	
(It appears that you don’t, but I think 
  you must know someone.) 
With offers, it seems more polite in English to assume a positive outcome, namely that 
the offer will be accepted. For this reason, the some forms are normal in such cases:
Would you like some more coffee?	
[BYU-BNC: KBK] 
 Do you want something, a soft drink before you go? 	
[BYU-BNC: KCA] 
Negation by nuclear negative elements – as opposed to negation by the negative par­
ticle not – is explained in Chapter 1(→ 3.3), together with assertive and non-assertive 
items (→ 3.4).
17.4  BIASED DECLARATIVES WITH ATTITUDINAL MARKERS
Speakers also use declaratives to seek confirmation of their assumptions in a tactful 
way. Most simply, the declarative is accompanied by appropriate intonation: You are 
seeing her? You don’t mind if I stay? They are, in fact, leading questions. Frequently, 
certain items function as attitudinal markers to ‘draw out’ the desired information 
by reinforcing the speaker’s assumption:
Examples are:
I suppose you’ve heard the news?	
(epistemic verb)
I understand you’re leaving your job?	
(hearsay verb)
I hear you’ve been offered a new post?	
(hearsay verb)
She wasn’t invited to the wedding, then?	
(inferential connective)
So there’s nothing we can do?	
(inferential connective)
She knows all about it, of course?	
(attitudinal adjunct)
But surely you can just defrost it in the	
(attitudinal adjunct)
microwave?
So you took the documents to which	
(displaced wh-element)
Ministerial office? And you left them
where? 
More indirectly still, speakers can hint that information should be provided by You were 
about to say . . .?

1 4 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Conversely, an interviewer in a chat show might press a participant to admit that 
she had left her husband and child, which she denies: 
Interviewer: 	
So you’ve reported, basically, that you walked out?
Young woman: 	
No, I didn’t walk out.
Ellipted yes/no questions (a type of verbless clause) are extremely common in spoken
English. With these, it is even more important than usual to use appropriate 
intonation.
For example, if you are pouring coffee for someone, you might offer sugar and milk 
by saying simply Sugar? Milk? with a rising tone. A falling tone would be inferred as a 
statement, ‘Here is the sugar, here is the milk’, but wouldn’t necessarily be interpreted 
as an offer; quite the opposite – you might be considered unhelpful.

DIRECTIVES: GETTING PEOPLE	
UNIT 18 
TO CARRY OUT ACTIONS	
SUMMARY
1 	 The clearest way of trying to get someone to do something is by an imper­
ative. Strong impositions that invoke power and status are not socially 
acceptable in English in many everyday situations, even when accom­
panied by please. Orders are usually avoided and are preferably made
indirectly as requests by using other clause types. Question tags either 
soften or heighten the force of the directive; with imperatives, tags tend to 
sound familiar.
2 	 Modalisation is another resource for producing directives. With modalised 
declaratives the effect is usually stronger and more formal, while modal­
ised interrogatives tend to sound more polite. In contexts of urgency (Help! 
Stop!) the imperative can be used, as in others in which the hearer’s wel­
fare is referred to (Sleep well! Have fun!).
3 	 Besides directing other people to do things, the speaker can commit him/
herself to carrying out an act. Performative uses of promise and modal will 
with a declarative do precisely this. The particle let’s is used to make sug­
gestions for actions, usually to be carried out jointly with the addressee. It 
can also function, however, as a disguised order or request.
18.1  DIRECTIVES AND THE IMPERATIVE
Although the basic speech act associated with imperative clauses is commonly held 
to be that of expressing a command, the imperative is used more frequently in English 
for less mandatory purposes. It can imply attitudes and intentions that are not actually 
formulated in the clause, and which can only be interpreted through a knowledge of the 
background context and of the relationships that exist between the persons involved.
In fact, the difference between commands and other directives such as requests, 
invitations and advice is, as we have already seen, not clear-cut. It depends on such 
factors as the relative authority of the speaker towards the addressee and whether the 

1 4 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
addressee is given the option of complying or not with the directive: in the case of a 
command there is no option, whereas with a request there is.
Other factors include which of the two interlocutors is judged to benefit from the 
fulfilment of the action: a piece of advice benefits the addressee, whereas a request 
benefits the speaker. Good wishes (Get well soon!) rarely refer to agentive acts (→ 14.1) 
and so aren’t directives.
Politeness is also a major factor. The more the action is likely to benefit the 
addressee, the more socially acceptable an imperative will be. Otherwise, an impera­
tive is likely to sound abrupt or demanding in English.
Consider the following cost–benefit scale on which the imperative is kept constant. 
The utterances at the lower end of the scale sound more polite than those at the top, 
even though there are no specific markers of politeness present:
1	
Peel those potatoes	
more cost to addressee	
less polite
2	
Pick up those papers
3	
Sit down
4	
Listen to this
5	
Enjoy your holiday
6	
Have another sandwich 	
more benefit to addressee	
more polite
(Adapted from Leech 1983)
Other factors override politeness, however, such as emergency (Help!) or attention- 
seeking in conversation (Look, what I meant was . . .); the imperative can also be 
used when the speaker and hearer are carrying out a joint task (Pass me the span­
ner), when the hearer’s interests are put first (Don’t worry! Cheer up! Take care!), 
and even as a discourse initiator or topic introducer (Guess who I saw this morning 
at the bank).
The speech-act force of imperatives has, therefore, to be worked out by the addressee 
from the logical meaning of the sentence combined with the inferences made on the 
basis of context and the speaker–hearer relationship. Isolated examples can simply 
illustrate some typical interpretations: 
Get out of here! 	
command
Keep off the grass. 	
prohibition
Please close the window!	
request
Don’t tell me you’ve passed your driving test! 	
disbelief
Do that again and you’ll be sorry. 	
condition of threat
Pass your exams and we’ll buy you a bike. 	
condition of promise
Don’t forget your umbrella! 	
reminder
Mind the step!/ Be careful with that hot plate! 	
warning
Feel free to take as many leaflets as you like.	
permission
Just listen to this!	
showing interest/involvement
Try one of these! 	
offer
Let’s go jogging!	
suggestion
Come on now, don’t cry!/ Go on, have a go!	
encouragement
Sleep well! Have a safe journey! 	
good wishes

18.2  THE DISCOURSE FUNCTION OF LET’S IMPERATIVES
Imperatives (especially with let’s) can fulfil a textual function in regulating the conver­
sational flow, in many cases to the advantage of the more powerful speaker: 
Let’s get started 	
a call to attention
Let’s start by . . .	
management of the topic
Let’s see/let me see 	
hesitation marker, to avoid silence and
	
  keep the floor
Let’s just stick to the main concern 	
disallowing an interruption/topic
	
  management
More people read magazines than, 	
giving a possible example
let’s say, historical treatises.
18.3 POLITENESS IN DIRECTIVES
After an imperative, a modal tag acts as an intensifier, either softening or heighten­
ing the insistence of the directive. Will you? and could you? convey a high degree of 
optionality while can’t you? questions the hearer’s apparent inability to do something, 
conveying impatience and low optionality. The more optional the act appears to be, 
the more polite is the request.
Intonation and the words used can make even will you less polite, however; Shut up 
and Drop dead don’t become polite by adding will you. Rising intonation is typically 
polite and persuasive, failing intonation more insistent. 
Check this for me, will you? 	
polite, anticipates willingness
Sign this for me, would you? 	
polite, anticipates willingness
Keep this for me, can you? 	
familiar, anticipates willingness
Hold this for me, could you? 	
less familiar, anticipates willingness
Keep quiet, can’t you? 	
insistent, anticipates unwillingness  
These examples are characteristic of contexts of familiarity. With the exception of 
can’t, they question and anticipate the addressee’s willingness to carry out the action, 
and are polite but familiar, expressing solidarity. The negative imperative tag will you? 
is also familiar as in Don’t be late, will you?, while the invariable tag mind is more insist­
ent: Don’t be late, mind!
Where there is no relationship of closeness between the speakers, these forms may 
sound over-familiar. In such cases most modalised interrogatives are safer without 
tags.

1 4 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
18.4  MODALISED INTERROGATIVES AS POLITE DIRECTIVES
The directive force is overlaid onto the interrogative. Such directives are more polite 
precisely because as interrogatives they appear to give the addressee the option of 
refusing, as in the following examples: 
1 	 Can you close the door?
2 	 Will you close the door?
3 	 Could you close the door?
4 	 Would you close the door?
5 	 Won’t you close the door?
6 	 Can’t you close the door?
7 	 Must you leave the door open?
8 	 Do you mind closing the door? 
The modals in 3 and 4 Could you? and Would you? are most polite because by the use 
of oblique (‘past’) forms they create conceptual distance between themselves and the 
speech act. Furthermore, distance correlates with less social involvement. The speaker 
conveys the impression that closing the door is of no great personal benefit; this gives 
the hearer a wider margin for possible refusal. As in the imperative tag, can’t 6 is not 
polite as a request. Won’t 5 is not polite either, as it appears to question the hearer’s 
unwillingness to carry out the rather trivial act of closing the door. Such unwillingness 
to carry out simple actions that obviously need doing also violates cultural conven- 
tions of cooperation. By contrast, won’t you? as an offer or invitation (make yourself at 
home, won’t you) is polite because it expresses warmth and generosity, and presumes 
that the act benefits the addressee. Must 7 is ironical, implying that the hearer has an 
insurmountable urge to leave the door open.
Responding to directives 
Requests are sometimes responded to by a standard phrase: A. Do you mind closing the 
door? B. Not at all/Certainly/Sure. Of these, not at all responds to the sentence meaning 
of Do you mind?, whereas certainly and sure clearly respond to the pragmatic meaning 
of ‘request’ rather than to the sentence meaning, since they are not to be taken as 
certainly/sure I mind closing the door. Offers can be accepted by Yes, please or Thanks, 
and refused by No, thanks. Thank you alone is not interpreted as a refusal in English. 
Suggestions are responded to in many different ways such as okay, I might, it’s an idea.
18.5  DECLARATIVES AS DIRECTIVES
A declarative which contains a modal auxiliary (e.g. can, shall, will, may, might, must, 
ought, should) and refers to an action to be carried out by the addressee can be used 
with the force of a directive. They are usually quite strong, invoking authority: 
You will report to Head Office tomorrow, Bond. 	
(command)
Dogs must be kept on a lead. 	
(strong obligation)

I N T E R A C T I O N :  S P E E C H  A C T S  
1 4 5
You may/can leave now. 	
(permission)
Surely you can take your own decisions! 	
(exclamative-directive) 
A 1st person declarative with a modal can have the effect of committing the speaker 
to a course of action:
I’ll meet you at the entrance at about nine.
I must rush off now to my aerobics class. 
For meanings of prediction (will, shall), logical necessity (must), possibility (may, might) 
and reasonable inference (should, ought) → 44.3. These meanings are almost always 
clearly distinguishable from the directive meanings, as in: 
There will be time for a few questions. 	
(prediction)
It must be almost half-past nine. 	
(logical necessity/deduction) 
18.6  INDIRECTNESS, IMPOLITENESS AND CONFRONTATION
Indirectness is part of everyday interaction in spoken English. It is important to learn 
to handle and interpret the conventional politeness forms and the force each carries, as 
these serve to construct and negotiate meanings and actions which lead to a satisfac­
tory outcome for both or all the participants.
This does not mean that speakers are invariably polite to each other. Far from 
it. Mutual insults among some communities represent a form of solidarity. In many 
other contexts, competitiveness or a desire to score off the adversary lead quickly to
confrontational attitudes and acrimonious exchanges. Indirectness and implicit mean­
ings are common in such cases also, as is illustrated in the following extract from Ian 
Rankin’s novel Set in Darkness. 
Detective Inspector Linford is sitting in his BMW in the only spare bay belonging to a 
large office block in Edinburgh. Another car approaches and stops, its driver sounding 
the horn and gesturing:	
Linford slid his window down. 
‘That’s my space you’re in, so if you wouldn’t mind.......?’.1
Linford looked around. ‘I don’t see any signs.’2
‘This is staff parking.’3 A glance at a wristwatch. ‘And I’m late for a meeting.’4
Linford looked towards where another driver was getting into his car. ‘Space there 
for you.’5
‘You deaf or what?’6 Angry face, jaw jutting and tensed. A man looking for a fight.
Linford was just about ready. ‘So you’d rather argue with me than get to your meet­
ing?’7 He looked towards where another car was leaving. ‘Nice spot over there.’8
‘That’s Harley. He takes his lunch hour at the gym. I’ll be in the meeting when he gets 
back, and that’s his space.9 Which is why you move your junk heap.’10
‘This from a man who drives a Sierra Cosworth.’11

1 4 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
‘Wrong answer.’12 The man yanked Linford’s door open.
‘The assault charge is going to look bloody good on your CV.’13
‘You’ll have fun trying to make a complaint through broken teeth.’14
‘And you’ll be in the cells for assaulting a police officer.’15
The man stopped, his jaw retreating a fraction. His Adam’s apple was prominent 
when he swallowed. Linford took the opportunity to reach into his jacket, showing his 
warrant card.
‘So now you know who I am.’16 Linford said, ‘But I didn’t catch your name . . .?’17
‘Look. I’m sorry.’18 The man had turned from fire to sun, his grin trying for
embarrassed apology. ‘I didn’t mean to . . .19 (see exercise)
You will see that the numbered sentences of the fictional dialogue are either declaratives 
or interrogatives, although some of the clauses are verbless. Notice how the two speakers 
overlay the basic force of question and assertion with other more implicit forces such as 
explanation, reason, warning, threat, apology, challenge, provocation, sugges­
tion, excuse. It is these indirect meanings that are inferred and which interest us here.

18.7.1  Clause combinations 
Combinations of clauses can be used in English to express a polite request. The greater 
the imposition on the hearer, the longer the combination is likely to be, and it may be 
preceded by an apology: 
I’m terribly sorry to bother you. I wonder if you could possibly write me a testimo­
nial. If it’s not too inconvenient, perhaps you could let me have it by tomorrow.

CONCEPTUALISING	
UNIT 19
EXPERIENCES EXPRESSED
AS SITUATION TYPES	
SUMMARY
1	
Semantically, a clause represents a pattern of experience, conceptualised 
as a situation type.
2	
Situation types comprise three main types: material, mental and relational. 
There are also three subsidiary types: behavioural, verbal and existential.
3 	 Each situation type consists of the following:
•	
The process: the central part of the situation, realised by a verb. 
Process types include those of doing, happening, experiencing, being 
and existing.
•	
Participant roles: these symbolically represent the persons, things and 
abstract entities involved in the process.
•	
Attributes: the elements which characterise, identify or locate the 
participant.
•	
Circumstances: those of time, place, manner, condition, etc. attendant 
on the situation.
4 	 The type of process determines the nature and number of the participants. 
Certain inherent participants can remain unactualised when understood in 
the context.
5 	 The valency of the verb specifies the number of inherent participants of any 
process, and by reduction indicates the result of unactualising one or more 
participants. This type of analysis runs parallel to the traditional transitive–
intransitive analysis.
19.1  PROCESSES, PARTICIPANTS, CIRCUMSTANCES
In this chapter we look at the clause as a grammatical means of encoding patterns of 
experience. A fundamental property of language is that it enables us to conceptualise 

1 5 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
and describe our experience, whether of the actions and events, people and things of 
the external world, or of the internal world of our thoughts, feelings and perceptions. 
This is done through transitivity, contemplated in a broad sense, which encompasses 
not only the verb but the semantic configuration of situation types.
The clause is, here too then, the most significant grammatical unit. It is the unit 
that enables us to organise the wealth of our experience, both semantically and syn­
tactically, into a manageable number of representational patterns or schemas. Our 
personal ‘construals’ of each individual situation are then selected from these patterns. 
In describing an event, for instance, we might say that it just happened, or that it was 
caused by someone’s deliberate intervention, or that it is unusual, or that we feel sad 
about it, among other possible construals. In this chapter we will be talking about pat­
terns of ‘doing’, ‘happening’, ‘experiencing’ and ‘being’ as the main types, together with 
a small number of subsidiary types.
As language-users, we are interested in events and especially in the human par­
ticipants involved and the qualities we ascribe to them, what they do, say and 
feel, their possessions and the circumstances in which the event takes place. The 
semantic schema for a situation, therefore, consists potentially of the following 
components:
• 
the process (a technical term for the action (e.g. hit, run), state (e.g. have) or change 
of state (e.g. melt, freeze) involved.
• 
the participant(s) involved in the process (basically, who or what is doing what to 
whom);
• 
the attributes ascribed to participants; and
• 
the circumstances attendant on the process, in terms of time, place, manner, and 
so on.
19.1.1  The process
There is no satisfactory general term to cover that central part of a situation, the part 
which is typically realised by the verb and which can be an action, a state, a meteoro- 
logical phenomenon, a process of sensing, saying or simply existing. Following 
Halliday, we here use the term ‘process’ for all these types. We can also analyse them 
as dynamic processes and stative processes.
Dynamic and stative processes
Dynamic situations and processes involve something that occurs or happens; they 
can be tested for by means of the question ‘What happened?’ Stative situations and 
processes are conceived of as durative over time, and as existing rather than happening, 
so it doesn’t make sense to ask ‘What happened?’ in such cases. Generally, dynamic 
processes easily occur in the progressive (Pete is going away) and the imperative (Go 
away, Pete!), whereas most stative processes don’t usually accept the progressive or 
the imperative (*Pete is seeming kind. *Hear a noise!) (→ 43.5.1).

19.1.2  The participant roles (semantic functions) involved 
in the situation
In classifying situations into schemas, we filter out the wealth of detail that we find in 
our personal experiences, to focus on the salient participant(s) that belong to different 
types of situation. These are usually just one or two, at the most three. When one of the 
participants is human, it is typically assigned the primary role (Agent/Subject) in the 
semantic and syntactic constructions. This is a consequence of our anthropocentric 
orientation in conceptualising events.
While human participants occupy a prime place among the semantic roles, the 
term ‘participant’ does not refer exclusively to persons or animals, but includes 
things and abstractions. A participant can be the one who carries out the action 
or the one who is affected by it; it can be the one who experiences something by 
seeing or feeling; it can be a person or thing that simply exists. The terminology 
used to identify participant roles may be less familiar to you than the corresponding 
syntactic terms. As we go on, you will find that labels are useful in semantics, just 
as in syntax, in order to talk about concepts. We will try to keep them as simple and 
transparent as possible.
The Attributes ascribed to entities either identify or characterise the entity, or 
state its location in space or time. They are realised syntactically by the intensive 
Complements (Complement of the Subject and Complement of the Object).
19.1.3  The circumstantial roles associated with the process
These include the well-known circumstances of time, place, manner and condition, as 
well as a few others. They are typically optional in the semantic structure, just as their 
adjunctive counterparts are in the syntactic structure. Circumstances can, however, be 
inherent to the situation: for instance, location is obligatory with certain senses of ‘be’, 
as in the ice-cream’s over there, and with ‘put’ in its sense of ‘placing’ as in let’s put it in 
the freezer (→ 4.2.1; 10.8).

We have now outlined the framework that will serve to carry the different con- 
figurations of semantic functions that go to make up semantic structures. It is not the 
case, however, that any particular configuration is inherently given in nature. There are 
various ways of conceptualising a situation, according to our needs of the moment and 
what the lexico-grammatical resources of a language permit.

1 5 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
For instance, on the day planned for a river picnic we may look out of the window 
and say it’s cloudy, specifying simply a state (is) and an Attribute (cloudy); alternatively, 
that the sky is cloudy, adding a participant (the sky) for the Attribute. More ominously, 
someone might say the clouds are gathering, in which the situation is represented as a 
dynamic happening rather than as a state, with a participant (clouds) and a dynamic 
process (are gathering), leaving implicit the circumstance of place (in the sky).
There is no one-to-one correlation between semantic structures and syntactic 
structures; rather, the semantic categories cut across the syntactic ones, although with 
some correlation. Semantic structures and syntactic structures do not, therefore, always 
coincide; rather, they overlap. In both cases, however, it is the process, expressed 
by the verb, that determines the choice of participants in the semantic structure and 
of syntactic elements in the syntactic structure. In Chapter 3 the possible syntactic 
combinations are discussed from the point of view of verb complementation and verb 
type. In this chapter we shall start from the semantics; at the same time we shall try to 
relate the choice of semantic roles to their syntactic realisations.
One obvious problem in the identification of participants and processes is the 
vastness and variety of the physical world, and the difficulty involved in reducing this 
variety to a few prototypical semantic roles and processes. All we can attempt to do is 
to specify the paradigm cases, and indicate where more detailed specification would 
be necessary in order to account semantically for the varied shades of our experience.
19.2  TYPES OF PROCESS
There are three main types of process:
(a)	 Material processes are processes of ‘doing’ (e.g. kick, run, eat, give) or ‘happening’ 
(e.g. fall, melt, collapse, slip).
(b)	 Mental processes, or processes of ‘experiencing’ or ‘sensing’ (e.g. see, hear, feel, 
know, like, want, regret).
(c)	 Relational processes, or processes of ‘being’ (e.g. be, seem) or ‘becoming’ (e.g. 
become, turn), in which a participant is characterised, or identified, or situated cir­
cumstantially. A sub-type of relational process is that of ‘having’ or ‘possessing’ 
(e.g. have, own).
There are also three subsidiary processes: behavioural, verbal and existential. We shall 
see, as we go on, that the presence or absence of volition and energy are important 
factors in distinguishing between processes.
19.3  INHERENT PARTICIPANTS AND ACTUALISED 
PARTICIPANTS
Most processes are accompanied by one or more inherent participants; the nature of 
the process determines how many and what kind of participants are involved. The 
material process represented by the verb fall for instance, has only one participant, 
whereas kick typically requires two: one participant is the Agent who carries out the 

C O N C E P T U A L I S I N G  PAT T E R N S  O F  E X P E R I E N C E  
1 5 9
action, and must be ‘animate’ and typically ‘human’; the other is the participant affected 
by the action of kicking, and is not required to be human, or even animate.
In the example Ted kicked the ball both the inherent participants are actualised as 
Ted and the ball. If we say Ted kicked hard, however, only one participant, the Agent, 
is actualised. The second participant, the one affected by the action, is unactualised 
but understood. In everyday uses of English, speakers frequently find it convenient 
not to actualise certain inherent participants. Give, for instance, is typically a three-
participant process as in Mary gave the Red Cross a donation. Only two participants are 
actualised, however, in Mary gave a donation and only one in Mary gave generously.
Certain participants are omitted in this way when they are conventionally understood 
from the context of culture or context of situation, for example:
Do you drive? 	
(a car)	
Shall I pour? 	
(the tea/coffee)
Have you eaten yet?	 (lunch/dinner)	
Our team is winning	
(the match/race)
The participant is not specific in electricity can kill, remarks like that can hurt, elephants 
never forget, Enjoy! and is perhaps not even known to the speaker in he teaches, she 
writes. Processes such as meet and kiss can be understood as having implicit reciprocity 
in, for instance, your sister and I have never met (each other).
Some processes have typically no participants; for example, statements about the 
weather, time and distance such as it’s snowing, it’s half past eleven, it’s a long walk to the 
beach. In these the pronoun it is merely a surface form required to realise the obligatory 
Subject element. It has no corresponding semantic function.
In Chapter 3 the term intransitive has been used to refer to verbs that express one-
participant processes such as fall or no-participant processes such as rain, whose action 
does not extend to any Object. The term transitive has been used to refer to verbs 
and clauses in which the process is extended to one or more Objects. Following this 
convention, give is transitive in Mary gave a donation but intransitive in Give generously!
Similarly, the semantic analysis into actualised and unactualised participants is 
paralleled by the syntactic analysis of verbs such as drive, eat etc. as being either 
transitive (taking an Object) or intransitive (with no Object).
In this book we shall use ‘transitive’ and ‘intransitive’ as syntactic terms, while 
referring semantically to one-, two- or three-participant processes, with ‘actualised’ or 
‘unactualised’ inherent participants.
The number of participants (including the subject) involved in a process can also be 
referred to as its valency. A process with one participant is said to be monovalent – 
as in the ice melted. A process with two participants is bivalent – as in the postman rides 
a motorcycle; a process with three participants is trivalent – as in Mary gave the Red 
Cross a donation. The valency is reduced from three to two, or from two to one when 
participants are not actualised, as in the examples above (→ Chapter 3, Introduction).
To sum up, processes such as eat and drive each have two inherent participants (the 
one who eats or sees, and the one that is eaten or driven). But in our listed examples 
only one is actualised. The items in brackets represent the conventionally understood 
second participant. As regards valency, in each case the normal valency of two is 
reduced to one. As regards transitivity, each of the verbs is potentially transitive, but as 
the second participant is unactualised, the use is intransitive.

MATERIAL PROCESSES OF	
UNIT 20
DOING AND HAPPENING	
SUMMARY
1 	 The first main category of processes, material processes, includes several 
kinds: ‘doing’, ‘happening’, ‘causing’ and ‘transferring’. Typically, the 
action of ‘doing’ is carried out by a volitional, controlling human par­
ticipant: the Agent. A non-controlling inanimate agent is called Force, for 
instance an earthquake.
2 	 In processes of doing, the action either extends no further than the Agent 
itself, as in she resigned, or it extends to another participant, the Affected 
(the ball in Pelé kicked the ball). A special type of ‘doing’ is the process of 
transfer, in which an Agent transfers an Affected participant to a Recipient 
or is intended for a Beneficiary (give someone a present, make someone a 
cake, respectively).
3 	 In involuntary processes of happening, the Affected undergoes the happen­
ing (the roof fell in, the old man collapsed).
4 	 The order of elements in the semantic structures is iconic, that is, the linguis­
tic ordering of the event reflects our conceptualisation of the event.
20.1  AGENT AND AFFECTED IN VOLUNTARY PROCESSES 
OF ‘DOING’
Material processes express an action or activity which is typically carried out by a 
‘doer’ or Agent. By ‘Agent’ we mean an entity having energy, volition and intention 
that is capable of initiating and controlling the action, usually to bring about some 
change of location or properties in itself or others. Agents are typically human.
A.  Agentive Subject of a voluntary process of ‘doing’ – They all left 
A voluntary one-participant process can be carried out by an Agent as Subject operating 
on itself:

One-participant voluntary material processes answer the question What did X do? 
(What did the Prime Minister do? The Prime Minister resigned.) To test for Agent, we 
can ask the question Who resigned? (The Prime Minister did).
B.  Affected participant in a voluntary process of ‘doing’ – Ted hit Bill
With action processes such as resigning and sitting down, the action does not extend 
to another participant. With others, such as hitting and carrying, it does. The second 
participant is someone or something affected by the action denoted by the verb in an 
active clause, as a result of the energy flow. This participant is called the Affected 
(other terms in use for this participant are Patient and Goal).

Figure 5.3  Affected participant in a voluntary process of ‘doing’.
For those material processes that have two participants, an Agent and an Affected, 
it also makes sense to ask the question What did Ted do? (He hit Bill), and to identify 
the Affected by the question ‘Who(m) did Ted hit?’
C.  Affected Subject in a passive clause – Bill was hit by Ted
Consequently, if the process extends to an Affected participant, the representation can 
be made in two forms, either active, in which Agent conflates with Subject, as above, 
or passive, in which Affected conflates with Subject:
Affected
Material process
Agent

Figure 5.4  Affected Subject in a passive clause.
A further kind of material process is illustrated in Fiona made a cake and Dave wrote 
a message. Neither the cake nor the message existed before the process of making or 
writing, so they cannot be classed as ‘Affecteds’. Rather, they are created as a result of 
the process, and can be called ‘Effected participants’. However, no syntactic distinction 
is made between Affected and Effected participants; the distinction is purely semantic.

20.2  FORCE
The notion of agency is a complex one, which includes such features as animacy, 
intention, motivation, responsibility and the use of one’s own energy to initiate or 
control a process. In central instances, all these features will be present. In non-central 
instances, one or more of these features may be absent. If we say, for example, that the 
horse splashed us with mud as it passed we do not imply that the horse did so deliberately. 
We do not attribute intentionality or responsibility or motivation to the horse in this 
situation. We might call it an ‘unwitting Agent’.
The higher animals, and especially pets, are often treated grammatically as if they 
were humans. Nevertheless, rather than devise a different term for every sub-type of 
agency we will make just one further distinction: that between animate and inanimate 
Agents. This is useful in order to account for such natural phenomena as earthquakes, 
lightning, electricity, avalanches, the wind, tides and floods, which may affect humans 
and their possessions. They are inanimate, and their power or energy cannot therefore 
be intentional. They can instigate a process but not control it. This non-controlling 
entity we call Force; it will include such psychological states as anxiety, fear or joy.

In the following description, the subject in italics realises the role of Force and most of 
the verbs encode material processes:
The cold crept in from the corners of the shanty, closer and closer to the stove. Icy-cold 
breezes sucked and fluttered the curtains around the beds. The little shanty quivered in 
the storm. But the steamy smell of boiling beans was good and it seemed to make the 
air warmer.
(Laura Ingalls Wilder, The Long Winter)
20.3  AFFECTED SUBJECT OF INVOLUNTARY PROCESSES 
OF ‘HAPPENING’
Not all material processes involve a voluntary action carried out by an Agent. In 
situations expressed as Jordan slipped on the ice, the roof collapsed, the children have 
grown, the vase fell off the shelf, the participant, even when animate, is neither controlling 
nor initiating the action. This is proved by the inappropriateness of the question ‘What 
did X do?’ and of the wh-cleft test (*What the children did was grow). Rather, we should 

C O N C E P T U A L I S I N G  PAT T E R N S  O F  E X P E R I E N C E  
1 6 3
ask ‘What happened to X?’ The participant on which the action centres in such cases 
is, then, Affected. It is found in involuntary transitional processes such as grow and 
melt, which represent the passage from one state to another, and in involuntary actions 
and events such as fall, slip and collapse, which may have an animate or an inanimate 
participant.

In the following passage almost all the clauses are intransitive: the Subject participant 
varies from Force (the 11-metre-high tidal wave) to Affected (doors, windows, roofs, 
canopies, all inanimate).
The 11-metre-high tidal wave crashed over the beach restaurants and engulfed the peo­
ple walking along the promenade. Doors swung open, windows shattered; roofs caved 
in and canopies tore apart. 

CAUSATIVE PROCESSES	
UNIT 21
SUMMARY
1 	 In causative material processes some external Agent or Force causes some­
thing to happen. In the paradigm case, a responsible, purposeful human 
Agent directly causes an Affected to undergo the action named by the 
verb. The Affected, not the Agent, is the inherent participant that undergoes 
the process, as in I rang the bell.
2 	 When the Affected object of a transitive-causative clause is the same as 
the Affected subject of the corresponding intransitive clause, we have an 
‘ergative pair’.
3 	 A ‘pseudo-intransitive’ expresses the facility of a participant to undergo a 
process: Glass breaks easily.
21.1  CAUSATIVE MATERIAL PROCESSES AND ERGATIVE 
PAIRS
The prototypical pattern of direct causation is quite complex. A controlling, purposeful, 
responsible Agent directs its energy towards something or someone (the Affected), so 
that this undergoes the action named by the verb, with a consequent change of state. 
The following example illustrate this transitive-causative structure.

From this perspective, the action of boiling, ringing, etc. is initiated by a controlling 
Agent or a Force participant: The sun melted the ice.

The Affected is, however, the essential participant, the one primarily involved in the 
action. It is the door that opens, the water that boils and the bell that rings.
If we conceptualise the situation from a different angle, in which no Agent initiator 
is present, we encode the process as ‘happening’ of its own accord. An Agent can’t be 
added. This is the anti-causative structure.

Figure 5.8  Anti-causative structure.
When the Affected object of a transitive clause (e.g. the bell) is the same as the 
Affected subject of an intransitive clause, we have an ergative alternation or 
ergative pair, as in I rang the bell (transitive) and the bell rang (intransitive). This key 
participant in both cases is sometimes called the Medium. Ergative systems in many 
languages are ordinarily characterised by morphological case marking, the subject of 
the intransitive clause and the object of the transitive clause being marked in the same 
way, while the Agentive subject is marked differently. This is not the case with English 
which instead marks both the subject of an intransitive clause and that of a transitive 
clause as nominative, and the object of the transitive as accusative. We can see this in 
the two meanings of leave: he left (went away, intrans.), he left them (abandon, trans.).
Nevertheless, the term ‘ergative’ has been extended to English on the basis of the 
semantic association between S (intrans.) and O (trans.) in alternations illustrated by 
boil, ring, etc. The semantic similarity between these two is one of change of state.
The test for recognising an ergative pair is that the transitive-causative,
two- participant structure must always allow for the corresponding one-participant, 
anti- causative structure. Compare the previous examples (e.g. he opened the door/the 
door opened) with the following, in which the first, although transitive, is not causative. 
There is no intransitive counterpart, and consequently, no ergative pair:
Pelé kicked the ball.  *The ball kicked 
The ergative alternation allows us to express a situation from both perspectives, 1 the 
transitive-causative and 2 the intransitive:
1	
A gust of wind fluttered the papers on the desk and whirled them in a spiral 
on to the floor. 
2	
The papers fluttered in the gust of wind and whirled in a spiral to the floor.
Ergative pairs account for many of the most commonly used verbs in English, some of 
which are listed below, with examples:
burn	
I’ve burnt the toast. The toast has burnt.
break	
The wind broke the branches. The branches broke.
burst	
She burst the balloon. The balloon burst.

1 6 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
close	
He closed his eyes. His eyes closed.
cook	
I’m cooking the rice. The rice is cooking.
fade	
The sun has faded the carpet. The carpet has faded.
freeze	
The low temperature has frozen the milk. The milk has frozen.
melt	
The heat has melted the ice. The ice has melted.
run	
Tim is running the bathwater. The bathwater is running.
stretch	
I stretched the elastic. The elastic stretched.
tighten	
He tightened the rope. The rope tightened.
wave	
Someone waved a flag. A flag waved.
Within this alternation – described here as an ‘ergative pair’ – there is a set of basically 
intransitive volitional activities (walk, jump, march) in which the second participant is 
involved either willingly or unwillingly. The control exerted by the Agent predominates 
in the transitive-causative:
He walked the dogs in the park. 	
The dogs walked.
He jumped the horse over the fence 	 The horse jumped over the fence.
The sergeant marched the soldiers. 	
The soldiers marched.
It is also possible to have an additional agent and an additional causative verb in the 
transitive clauses of ergative pairs; for example, The child got his sister to ring the bell, 
Mary made Peter boil the water.
21.2  ANALYTICAL CAUSATIVES WITH A RESULTING 
ATTRIBUTE
One final type of causative we will consider is the analytical type, based on combinations 
with verbs such as make and turn. In these an Agent brings about a change of state in 
the Affected participant. The resulting state is expressed by an Attribute (Complement 
of the Object in a syntactic analysis).
Agent/Force
Process
Affected
Resulting Attribute
They

wider and safer. 
This machine
will make

simple.
The heat
has turned
the milk
sour.
Pat
had
her hair
cut.
Figure 5.9  Analytical causatives with a resulting attribute.
The resulting change of state in the Affected participant is sometimes part of the 
meaning of a morphologically related causative verb: widen is the equivalent of make 
wide and simplify means make simple. With such verbs there are alternative SPOd 
causative structures: They are widening the road; This machine will simplify your tasks. 
For other adjectives such as safe there is no corresponding causative verb. Certain 
dynamic verbs such as turn can be used in specific causative senses in English. Have 
introduces a passive sense, expressed by a participle (cause to be -en).

Intransitives and transitive-causatives are illustrated in the following text:
Suddenly there was no sunshine. It went out,1 as if someone had blown out the sun like 
a lamp.2 The outdoors was grey, the windowpanes were grey, and at the same moment 
a wind crashed against the schoolhouse,3 rattling windows and doors4 and shaking the 
walls.5 
(Laura Ingalls Wilder, The Long Winter)
1intransitive; 2causing the Affected participant (the sun) to undergo an action (be blown 
out); 3Force (a wind), intransitive (crashed); 4indirectly caused the Affected (windows 
and doors) to rattle; and 5causing the Affected (the walls) to undergo an action (shake). 
21.3  PSEUDO-INTRANSITIVES
A further type of Affected Subject occurs with certain processes (break, read, translate, 
wash, tan, fasten, lock) which are intrinsically transitive, but in this construction are 
construed as intransitive, with an Affected subject.
Glass breaks easily.
This case doesn’t shut/close/lock/fasten properly.
Colloquial language translates badly.
Some synthetic fibres won’t wash. Usually they dry-clean.
Fair skin doesn’t tan quickly, it turns red.
Pseudo-intransitives differ from other intransitives in the following ways: 
• 
They express a general property or propensity of the entity to undergo (or not 
undergo) the process in question. Compare glass breaks easily with the glass broke, 
which refers to a specific event.
• 
Pseudo-intransitives tend to occur in the present tense.
• 
The verb is accompanied by negation, or a modal (often will/won’t), or an adverb 
such as easily, well, any of which specify the propensity or otherwise of the thing 
to undergo the process.
• 
A cause is implied but an Agent can’t be added in a by-phrase.
• 
There is no corresponding transitive construction, either active or passive, that 
exactly expresses the same meaning as these intransitives. To say, for instance, 
colloquial language is translated badly is to make a statement about translators’ 
supposed lack of skill, rather than about a property of colloquial language. The 
difficulty of even paraphrasing this pattern shows how specific and useful it is.
For the similarity of intransitive subjects and transitive objects as conveyors of new 
information (→ Chapter 6). These are the roles in which new information is over- 
whelmingly expressed.

PROCESSES OF TRANSFER	
UNIT 22
SUMMARY
1 	 There are three participants in the processes of transfer: Agent, Affected 
and Recipient or Beneficiary.
2 	 The Recipient is a central participant in three-participant processes such as 
give.It encodes the one who receives the transferred material.
3 	 The Beneficiary is the optional, non-central participant in three-participant 
processes such as fetch. It represents the one for whom some service is 
done.
22.1  RECIPIENT AND BENEFICIARY IN PROCESSES 
OF TRANSFER
With processes that encode transfer – such as give, send, lend, charge, pay, offer and 
owe – the action expressed by the verb extends not only to the Affected but to a third 
inherent participant, the Recipient, as in:
Ed gave the cat a bit of tuna.
Bill’s father has lent us his car.
Have you paid the taxi-driver the right amount?
The Recipient is the one who usually receives the ‘goods’, permission or informa- 
tion. (With owe there is a ‘moral’ Recipient who has not yet received anything.) The 
Beneficiary, by contrast is the optional, not inherent, participant for whom some 
service is done. This often amounts to being the intended recipient. However, it is not 
necessarily the same as receiving the goods. I can bake you a cake, but perhaps you 
don’t want it.
This difference is reflected in English in the syntax of verbs such as fetch, get, make, 
buy, order and many verbs of preparation such as cook, bake and mix, which can be 
replaced by make. These can represent services done for people rather than actions to 
people.

1 7 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Nurse, could you fetch me a glass of water?
Yes, but soon I’ll bring you your orange juice. I’ll get you something to read, too.
Semantically, both Recipient and Beneficiary are typically animate and human,
while syntactically both are realised as indirect object (→ 6.2.1). Occasionally an 
inanimate Recipient occurs as in: ‘We’ll give the unemployment question priority.’ 
An inanimate Beneficiary is possible, but unlikely: ?I’ve bought the computer a new 
mouse. Some become more acceptable with the prepositional alternative as in ‘I’ve 
found a good place for the magnolia.
The two syntactic tests for distinguishing Recipient from Beneficiary, namely 
passivisation and the prepositional counterpart, are discussed in 6.2.1 and 10.4.1.
Recipient and Beneficiary can occur together in the same clause, as in the following 
example, which illustrates the difference between the one who is given the goods (me) 
and the intended recipient (my daughter): She gave me a present for my daughter.
Both Recipient and Beneficiary may be involved in processes of an unbeneficial 
nature such as they sent him a letter-bomb, in which him is Recipient; and they set him a 
trap in which him is Beneficiary.

CONCEPTUALISING WHAT	
UNIT 23
WE THINK, PERCEIVE AND FEEL	
SUMMARY
1 	 Mental processes comprise processes of perception (see, hear, feel), of 
cognition (know, understand, believe) and of affection and desideration 
(like, fear; want, wish).
2 	 There is always a conscious participant, the Experiencer, who perceives, 
knows, likes, etc. There is usually a second participant, the Phenomenon – 
that which is perceived, known, liked or wanted.
23.1  MENTAL PROCESSES
Not all situations that we wish to express linguistically centre on doings and happenings. 
Mental processes are those through which we organise our mental contact with the 
world. There are four main types: cognition, such as know, understand, believe, doubt, 
remember and forget; perception, encoded by verbs such as see, notice, hear, feel and 
taste; affectivity, such as like, love, admire, miss and hate; desideration such as hope, 
want, desire and wish. Some of these are illustrated in the following invented sequence:
Tom saw a ball in the tall grass. He knew it wasn’t his, but he wanted to get it. He 
didn’t realise there were lots of nettles among the grass. He soon felt his hands 
stinging. He wished he had noticed the nettles.
With mental processes it makes no sense, as it does with material processes, to talk 
about who is doing what to whom. In, for example, Jill liked the present, Jill is not doing 
anything, and the gift is not affected in any way. We can’t apply the ‘doing to’ test to 
processes of liking and disliking, asking for instance ‘What did Jill do to the present?’ 
In many cases, a better test is to question the Experiencer’s reaction to something. It 
is therefore inappropriate to call Jill an Agent and the present the Affected. Rather, we 
need two more semantic roles:

1 7 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Jill	
liked	
the present
Experiencer	
Process	
Phenomenon
The Experiencer (or Senser) is the participant who sees, feels, thinks, likes, 
etc., and is typically human, but may also be an animal or even a personified inani­
mate object (The rider heard a noise, the horse sensed danger, your car knows what it 
needs). The use of a non-conscious entity as Experiencer in a mental process is often 
exploited for commercial ends, as in this last example.
The second participant in a mental process, that which is perceived, known, liked, 
etc., is called the Phenomenon. Mental processes are typically stative and non- 
volitional. When they occur in the present tense they typically take the simple, rather 
than the progressive, form. Compare this feature with material process verbs, for 
which the more usual, ‘unmarked’ form for expressing a happening in the present is 
the progressive. Another feature of stative verbs is that they do not easily occur in the 
imperative (Know thyself is a famous exception).
*Jill is liking the present 	
*Like the present, Jill!	
(mental)
Bill is mending the bicycle. 	 Mend the bicycle, Bill!	
(material)
Mental processes can sometimes be expressed with the Phenomenon filling the Subject 
slot and the Experiencer as Object, although not necessarily by means of the same verb. 
This means that we have two possible construals of the mental experience: in the one 
case, the human participant reacts to a phenomenon, as in 1 and 2, while in the other 
the phenomenon activates the attention of the experiencer, as in 3 and 4. Reversibility 
is helped by the fact that the passive is possible with many mental processes:
Experiencer
Process
Phenomenon
1 I
don’t understand
his motives
2 Most people
are horrified
by the increase in violence
Phenomenon
Process
Exeriencer
3 His motives
elude
me
4 The increase in violence
horrifies
most people
Figure 5.11  Examples of mental processes.
Similarly, English has the verb please, which is used occasionally in this way: I don’t 
think her choice pleased her mother [931]. More often ‘pleased’ is used as an adjective, 
as in he was very pleased with himself, which adjusts to the predominant pattern by 
which human subjects are preferred to non-human ones. ‘Pleased’ also tends to be 
equivalent to ‘satisfied’ or polite ‘willing’ as in University officers will be pleased to advise 
anyone . . . [931], which is quite different affectively from ‘like’.
In all the examples so far, the Phenomenon has been a single entity, expressed as a 
nominal group as the Object of the verb. But it can also be a fact, a process or a whole 
situation, realised by a clause (→ 11.1), as in the following examples:

23.2  COGNITIVE PROCESSES: KNOWING, THINKING AND 
BELIEVING
Cognitive processes are encoded by such stative verbs as believe, doubt, guess, know, 
recognise, think, forget, mean, remember, understand. A selection of examples is given 
below. Feel is also regularly used as an equivalent of ‘believe’. Most verbs of cognition 
have as their Phenomenon a wide range of things apprehended, including human, 
inanimate and abstract entities encoded as nominal groups (a) and (b). Facts, beliefs, 
doubts, perceptions and expectations are encoded as finite that-clauses (c) and (f), 
finite wh-clauses (e), or non-finite clauses (d), as discussed in units 11 and 12.

She
has forgotten
to leave us a key (situation)
(d)
Nobody

that it was too late (situation)
(e)

that you were ill (belief)
(f)
Many cognitive processes allow the Phenomenon to be unexpressed when this 
is ‘Given information’, for example I don’t know, Jill doesn’t understand, Nobody will 
remember.
In the following short extract, the author has chosen processes of cognition, percep- 
tion, affection and one behavioural to reflect the mental make-up of a meteorologist 
whose work contributed to chaos theory:
Lorenz enjoyed 1 weather – by no means a prerequisite for a research meteorologist. 
He savored 2 its changeability. He appreciated 3 the patterns that come and go in the 
atmosphere, families of eddies and cyclones, always obeying mathematical rules, yet 
never repeating themselves. When he looked 4 at clouds he thought 5 he saw 6 a kind 
of structure in them. Once he had feared 7 that studying the science of weather would 
be like prying a jack-in-the-box apart with a screwdriver. Now he wondered 8 whether 
science would be able to penetrate the magic at all. Weather had a flavor that could not 
be expressed by talking about averages.

23.3  PERCEPTION PROCESSES: SEEING, HEARING 
AND FEELING
As expressed by the non-volitional senses of see and hear in English, perception is 
an involuntary state, which does not depend upon the agency of the perceiver, who 
in fact receives the visual and auditory sensations non-volitionally. However, as the 
term Recipient has been adopted for the one who receives goods and information in 
three- participant processes, we will keep to the terms Experiencer or Senser. In the 
following illustrations you will notice that can is used when expressing non-volitional 
perception at the moment of speaking. This use replaces the present progressive, 
which is ungrammatical in such cases (*I am smelling gas).
Tom saw a snake. 	
Can you taste the lemon in the sauce?
I can feel a draught.	
I can smell gas.
We heard a noise.
The verbs see and feel are often used in English as conceptual metaphors for the 
cognitive processes of understanding and believing, respectively, as in You do see my 
point, don’t you? – No, I don’t see what you mean. I feel we should talk this over further. In 
addition, see has a number of dynamic uses, such as See for yourself! with the meaning 
of ‘verify’, and see someone off, meaning ‘accompany someone to the station, airport’, 
among many others. The progressive can be used with these (→ 43.5).
Corresponding to non-volitional see and hear, English has the dynamic volitional 
verbs look, watch and listen, among others. These are classed as behavioural processes.
The perception processes of ‘feeling, ‘smelling’ and ‘tasting’ each make use of one 
verb (feel, smell and taste) to encode three different ways of experiencing these sensations: 
one stative and non-volitional (I can smell gas), a second dynamic and volitional (Just 
smell these roses!) and the third as a relational process (This fish smells bad). In languages 
other than English, these differences may be lexicalised as different verbs.
In processes of seeing, hearing and feeling, English allows the Phenomenon to 
represent a situation that is either completed (I saw her cross the road) or not completed 
(I saw her crossing the road) (→ 12.4).
23.4  AFFECTIVE AND DESIDERATIVE PROCESSES: 
LIKING AND WANTING
23.4.1  Affective processes: loving and hating
Under affectivity process we include those positive and negative reactions expressed 
by such verbs as like, love, please, delight, dislike, hate and detest. Common desiderative 
verbs are want and wish.
We both love dancing.
I detest hypocrisy.
The ballet performance delighted the public.
Do you want a cup of coffee?

C O N C E P T U A L I S I N G  PAT T E R N S  O F  E X P E R I E N C E  
1 7 5
The Phenomenon in affectivity processes can be expressed by a nominal group which 
represents an entity, or by a clause representing an event or a situation. The situation 
is represented as actual or habitual by means of an -ing clause, while a to-infinitive 
clause will be interpreted as potential. For this reason, the latter is used in hypothetical 
meanings. Some verbs admit only one or other of the forms. Other verbs such as 
like, love and hate admit either (→ 12.4), and illustrate this semantic distinction in the 
following examples:
-ing clause
to-infinitive clause
They enjoy walking in the woods. 
They love to walk in the woods. 
She likes visiting her friends.
She would like to visit Janet.
I hate having a tooth out.
I would hate to have my teeth out.
Figure 5.12  Examples of cognitive processes.
23.4.2  Desiderative processes: wanting and wishing
These are expressed by such verbs as want, desire and wish. The Phenomenon role of 
want and desire can be expressed as either a thing or a situation, encoded by a nominal 
group or a to-infinitive clause, respectively; with wish only the situation meaning 
is possible. Both desire and wish can be used as very formal variants to want, and 
consequently occur in quite different registers and styles.
Do you want anything else? (thing)
If you want to stay overnight, just say so. (situation)
If you wish to remain in the college, you must comply with the regulations. (situation) 
If you desire to receive any further assistance, please ring the bell (situation)
Wishing, however, can also express in the Phenomenon role a longing for an event or 
state that is counter to reality. This notion of unreality is expressed by a simple Past 
tense (or the Past subjunctive were if the verb is be) or a Past Perfect. These Past tenses 
have the effect of ‘distancing’ the event from speech time. Wish takes modal would + 
infinitive to refer to future time. The complementiser that is normally omitted (→ 11.1):
present-time reference	
I wish Ted were here with us.
past-time reference	
I wish Ted had been here with us.
future-time reference 	
I wish Ted would come soon.

RELATIONAL PROCESSES OF	
UNIT 24
BEING AND BECOMING	
SUMMARY
1 	 The third main category of processes, relational processes, expresses the 
notion of being, in a wide sense. In English there are two main patterns of 
‘being’: the Attributive, as in Tom is a pilot, and the Identifying, as in 
Fred is the doorman.
2 	 The participant in the Attributive structure is the Carrier, the entity to which 
is ascribed an Attribute. The relations are of three kinds: attributive: 
Tom is keen, Tom is a pilot; circumstantial: The bus stop is over there; 
possessive: The baby has blue eyes. That car is mine. In possessive struc­
tures the participants are known as the Possessor and the Possessed.
3 	 The identifying pattern is reversible: it identifies one entity in terms of 
another. These are the Identified and the Identifier as in Fred is the 
doorman/The doorman is Fred. 
4 	 The process itself is encoded by linking verbs (mainly be and have) whose 
function is to carry tense and to relate the Carrier to its Attribute, the 
Identified to its Identifier and the Possessor to the Possessed. Others like 
lack and feel encode additional meanings.
24.1  TYPES OF BEING
Relational processes express the concept of being in a broad sense. They answer the 
questions ‘Who or what, where/when or whose is some entity, or What is some entity 
like?’ In other words, relational processes cover various ways of being: being something, 
being in some place/at some time, or in a relation of possession, as illustrated here:
1	
Mont Blanc	
is	
a (high) mountain. (an instance of a type)
2	
Mont Blanc	
is	
popular with climbers. (attribution)

C O N C E P T U A L I S I N G  PAT T E R N S  O F  E X P E R I E N C E  
1 7 7
3	
Mont Blanc	
is	
the highest mountain in western Europe. (identification)
4	
Mont Blanc	
is	
in the Alps. (circumstance: location)
5	
Those gloves	 are 	 yours. (possession)
There are two main patterns, the attributive as in 1, 2, 4 and 5 and the identifying, 
as in 3. We shall take a look at each in turn.
24.2  THE ATTRIBUTIVE PATTERN
There is one participant, the Carrier, which represents an entity. Ascribed to the Carrier 
is an Attribute, which characterises the entity in some way. Here are some examples:
Carrier
Process
Attribute
Their eldest son
was 
a musician 
The unemployment figures
are
alarming
Sports equipment
is
on the third floor
Figure 5.13  Carrier with its Attribute.
In the examples seen so far, the Attribute characterises the entity in the following 
ways: as an instantiation of a class of entities (a mountain, a musician) or a sub-class 
(that of high mountains, as in (1); by a quality (popular with climbers, alarming); by a 
location (in the Alps, on the third floor); or as a type of possession (yours) (→ 18.4).
There is an intensive relationship between the Carrier and its Attribute. That is to say, 
the Carrier is in some way the Attribute. The Attribute is not a participant in the situation, 
and when realised by a nominal group the NG is non-referential; it can’t become the 
Subject in a clause. Attributive clauses are non-reversible in the sense that they don’t 
allow a Subject–Complement switch. They allow thematic fronting (→ 28.7) as in . . . and 
a fine musician he was too, but a fine musician is still the Attribute, and he the Subject.
The process itself, when encoded by be, carries little meaning apart from that of 
tense (past time as in was; present as in is, are). Its function is to link the Carrier to the 
Attribute. However, the process can be expressed either as a state or as a transition. 
With stative verbs such as be, keep, remain, seem and verbs of sensing, such as look
(= ‘seem’), the Attribute is seen as existing at the same time as the process described 
by the verb and is sometimes called the current Attribute.
With dynamic verbs of transition such as become, get, turn, grow, run, the Attribute 
exists as the result of the process and can be called the resulting Attribute. Compare 
The weather is cold with The weather has turned cold.
Current Attribute
Resulting Attribute
We kept quiet
We fell silent
He remained captain for years
He became captain
Your sister looks tired
She gets tired easily
The public are weary of strikes
The public has grown weary of strikes
Figure 5.14  Current Attribute and resulting Attribute.

1 7 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
There is a wide variety of verbs in English to express both states and transitions 
(→ 9.4). As states, the most common verbs of perception such as look, feel, sound, 
smell and taste keep their experiential meaning in relational clauses. An Experiencer 
participant (e.g. to me) can be optionally added to this semantic structure:
feel	
The surface feels too rough (to me)
feel as if	
My fingers feel as if they were dropping off with the cold
look	
Does this solution look right? (to you)
look like	
[What’s that insect?] It looks like a dragonfly (to me)
sound	
His name sounds familiar (to me)
smell	
That fish smells bad (to me)
taste	
This soup tastes of vinegar (to me)
The verb feel can function in two types of semantic structure: with an Experiencer/
Carrier (I feel hot; she felt ill), or with a neutral Carrier (the surface feels rather rough). In 
expressions referring to the weather, such as it is hot/cold/sunny/windy/frosty/cloudy/
foggy, there is no Carrier and much of the meaning is expressed by the Attribute.
24.3  CIRCUMSTANTIAL RELATIONAL PROCESSES
These are processes of being in which the circumstantial element is essential to the 
situation, not peripheral to it (→ 9.2). The circumstance is encoded as Attribute in the 
following examples and stands in an intensive relationship with the Carrier:
Location in space: 	
The museum is round the corner.
Location in time: 	
Our next meeting will be on June 10.
Means: 	
Entrance to the exhibition is by invitation.
Agent: 	
This symphony is by Mahler.
Beneficiary:	
These flowers are for you.
Metaphorical meanings: 	
He’s off alcohol. Everyone’s into yoga nowadays.
The circumstance is encoded by the verb in The film script concerns (= is about) a 
psychopath who kidnaps a girl, The desert stretches as far as the eye can see, The carpet 
measures three metres by two, The performance lasted three hours.
Examples such as Tomorrow is Monday; Yesterday was July 1st are reversible and can 
be considered as identifying circumstantial processes.
24.4  POSSESSIVE RELATIONAL PROCESSES
The category of possession covers a wide number of sub-types, of which the most 
prototypical are perhaps part-whole (as in your left foot), ownership (as in our house) and 
kinship relations (Jane’s sister). Other less central types include unowned possession 
(the dog’s basket), a mental quality (her sense of humour), a physical quality (his strength), 
occupancy (his office) and an association with another person (my friends and colleagues). 
All these types and others are grammaticalised at the level of the clause in possessive

relational processes. A relatively small number of verbs occur, principally be, have, own 
and possess. The two participants involved are the Possessor and the Possessed. The 
notion of possession is expressed either by the Attribute, as in That computer is mine, or 
by the process itself, as in I have a new computer.
A.  Possession as Attribute
In this, the verb is be and the Attribute/Possessor is encoded by a possessive pronoun 
(mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs) or by an ’s phrase such as John’s in The green Peugeot 
is John’s. The sequence is similar with belong, although it is then the verb that conveys 
the notion of possession:
Possessed/Carrier
Process
Possessor/Attribute
These keys 
are 
my brother’s 
This glove
isn’t
mine
This mansion
belongs
to a millionaire
Figure 5.15  The be/belong possessive structure.
B.  Possession as process
English has several verbs to express possession. With be, have, own, possess and 
the more colloquial have got, the Carrier is the Possessor and the Attribute is the 
Possessed.
Also included in the category of ‘possessing’ are the notions of not possessing (lack, 
need), of being worthy to possess (deserve), and the abstract relations of inclusion, 
exclusion and containment:
Possessor/Carrier
Process
Possessed/Attribute
The baby

You

postage
The price

breakfast
That can
contains

Relational processes are extremely common in all uses of English. The following 
extract is based on an interview with a young farmer who breeds pigs. He describes 
them, not by what they do, but as they are; this view is reflected in the large number 
of Attributes.

Pigs are different. A pig is more of an individual, more human and in many ways a 
strangely likeable character. Pigs have strong personalities and it is easy to get fond of 
them. I am always getting fond of pigs and feel a bit conscience-stricken when I have to 
put them inside for their whole lives. Pigs are very clean animals but, like us, they are all 
different; some will need cleaning out1 after half a day and some will be neat and tidy 
after three days. Some pigs are always in a mess and won’t care. Pigs are very interesting
people and can leave quite a gap when they go off to the bacon factory.
(Ronald Blythe, Akenfield)
24.5  THE IDENTIFYING PATTERN
The participant roles in an identifying relationship are known as Identified and 
Identifier. Identification means that one participant, the Identified, is identified in 
terms of the other (the Identifier), in a relation of symbolic correlates. The Identifier 
is the one that fills the wh- element in a wh-question corresponding to the identifying 
clause:
(a)	 [What/Which is Mont Blanc?]
	
Mont Blanc (Identified) is the highest mountain in western Europe (Identifier).
(b)	 [Which is your father-in-law? Looking at a photograph]
	
My father-in-law (Identified) is the one in the middle (Identifier).
Identifying processes are reversible. The previous illustrations can be turned around, 
with the Identified/Identifying roles now represented by the opposite constituent:
(c)	 [What/Which is the highest mountain in western Europe?]
	
The highest mountain in Europe (Identified) is Mont Blanc (Identifier).
(d)	 [Who/Which is the one in the middle?]
	
The one in the middle (Identified) is my father-in-law (Identifier).
The difference between the two sequences lies in which element we want to identify; 
for instance, do we want to identify Mont Blanc or do we want to identify the highest 
mountain in Europe? In a discourse context this is a matter of presumed knowledge. 
Question (a) presumes that the listener has heard of Mont Blanc but doesn’t know 
its ranking among mountains. The answer could be ‘Mont Blanc (Identified) is the 
highest mountain in Europe (Identifier)’, in which the highlighted part represents tonic 
prominence (29.1) and the new information. Question (c) presumes that our listener 
knows there are high mountains in Europe, but not which one is the highest, receiving 
the answer ‘The highest mountain in Europe (Identified) is Mont Blanc (Identifier)’. 
Alternatively, in answer to the same question Which is the highest mountain in Europe? 
we could say ‘Mont Blanc (Identifier) is the highest mountain in Europe (Identified)’.

In spoken discourse it is the Identifier that typically receives the tonic prominence 
that is associated with new information, whether this is placed at the end (the usual 
position) or at the beginning of the clause. In each sequence, then, one half is typically 
something or someone whose existence is already known (the Identified), whereas the 
Identifier presents information as unknown or new to the listener. (These notions are 
explained more fully in Unit 29 on information packaging.)

The following passage, Colours in Rugs across Cultures, illustrates such correspondences:
The meaning of individual colours varies from culture to culture. In Muslim countries, 
green – the colour of Mohammed’s coat – is sacred and is very rarely used as a pre­
dominant colour, but it forms an important part of the dyer’s palette in non-Muslim
cultures, particularly in China; here, the sacred colour is yellow, in which the Emperor 
traditionally dressed. White represents grief to the Chinese, Indians and Persians. Blue 
symbolises heaven in Persia, and power and authority in Mongolia. Orange is synony­
mous with piety and devotion in Muslim countries, while red, the most universal rug 
colour, is widely accepted as a sign of wealth and rejoicing.
[OX0]
Finally, the difference between the Attributive and the Identifying patterns is reflected 
in the syntax in three ways: Only the identifying type is reversible (cf. *A high mountain 
is Mont Blanc); only the characterising type can be realised by an adjective (The 
unemployment figures are alarming); and nominal groups that realise characterising 
Attributes are usually indefinite (a musician), while NGs that realise identifying 
Attributes are usually definite (the club Secretary).
Certain relational processes of possession can be analysed by the Identifying pattern, 
and are reversible if suitably contextualised as identifying people’s possessions. For 
example, sandwiches: Yours is the ham-and-cheese; Tim’s is the egg-and-lettuce and 
mine is the tomato-and-tuna. Similarly, circumstantial Attributes can be reversed when 
explaining the layout of an area: Across the road, past the fountain is the Prado Museum. 
On your left is the Ritz Hotel. Further back is the Real Academia.

PROCESSES OF SAYING,	
UNIT 25
BEHAVING AND EXISTING	
SUMMARY
1 	 Processes of saying and communicating are verbal processes. The partici­
pant who communicates is the Sayer, and is typically human, while what is 
communicated is the ‘Said’ and may be a reported statement, a reported 
question or a reported directive (order, request, etc.). A Recipient, the 
addressee, is required with tell, and a Target may also be present in some 
verbal processes.
2 	 Behavioural processes are half-way between material and mental
processes, in that they have features of each. They include involuntary pro­
cesses (cough) and volitional processes (watch, stare, listen).
3 	 Existential processes, rather than stating that things simply exist, tend to 
specify the quantification and/or the location of something: There are bits 
of paper everywhere. The single participant is the Existent, which may be 
an entity or an event.
25.1  VERBAL PROCESSES
Verbal processes are processes of ‘saying’ or ‘communicating’ and are encoded by 
such verbs as say, tell, repeat, ask, answer and report. They have one participant which is 
typically human, but not necessarily so (the Sayer) and a second essential participant, 
which is what is said or asked or reported (the Said). A Recipient is required with tell 
and may be present as a PC (e.g. to me) with other verbal processes:

Figure 5.17  Verbal processes.
The Sayer can be anything which puts out a communicative signal (that clock, Jill, 
our correspondent). What is said is realised by a nominal group or a nominal what-
clause (what she knew). As these examples show, verbal processes are intermediate 
between material and mental processes. From one point of view, communicating is a 
form of ‘doing’, and in fact the Sayer is usually agentive or made to appear agentive, 
as in the case of the clock. Like material processes, verbal processes readily admit the 
imperative (Say it again!) and the progressive (What is he saying?).
On the other hand, the action of communicating is close to cognitive processes 
such as thinking. Verbs of saying, telling and others can be followed by a clause that 
represents either the exact words said (direct report) or a reported version of the 
meaning (indirect report). Many speech-act verbs can function in this way, to report 
statements, questions, warnings, advice and other speech acts:
She  said:	 	
‘I won’t be late’ (quoted statement or promise)
She	
said	
	
she wouldn’t be late (reported statement or promise)
She	
said:	 	
‘Don’t go to see that film’ (quoted directive: advice)
She	
told	
us	 not to go to see that film (reported directive: advice)
These alternative encodings are described more fully in Chapter 7. For the syntactic- 
semantic differences between say and tell in English, (→ 11.2).
When however, the message is encapsulated as a speech act by means of a nominal – 
such as ‘apology’, ‘warning’ and many others – it is treated as a participant in the verbal 
process. The verb then may express the manner of saying:
The airport authorities issued an apology
Someone shouted a warning
Retired cop vows revenge (press headline)
Wish in I wish you a merry Christmas is clearly both mental and verbal. Talk and chat 
are verbal processes, which have an implicit reciprocal meaning (They talked/chatted 
[to each other]). Talk has no second participant except in the expressions talk sense/
nonsense. Speak is not implicitly reciprocal and can take a Range participant (→ 20.1). 
(She speaks Spanish. He speaks five languages).

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
25.2  BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES
A borderline area between mental processes and material processes is represented by 
behavioural processes such as cough, sneeze, yawn, blink, laugh and sigh, which are 
usually one-participant. They are considered as typically involuntary; but it may be 
that there is a very slight agency involved. They can be deliberate, too, as in he coughed 
discreetly, he yawned rudely, in which the adjunct of manner implies volition. Acting 
excepted, most volitional adjuncts could not be used with die, collapse and grow, which 
are typically lacking in agency and volition.
We have already seen that mental processes such as see and hear have behavioural 
counterparts (watch and listen, respectively), which are dynamic and volitional, and 
have agentive Subjects, while see, taste and feel have both non-volitional and volitional 
senses. Similarly, think (in the sense of ponder) and enjoy can be used dynamically:
What are you thinking about?
I am enjoying the play enormously.
Enjoy!
25.3  EXISTENTIAL PROCESSES
Existential processes are processes of existing or happening. The basic structure 
consists of unstressed there + be + a NG (There’s a man at the door; there was a loud 
bang). There is not a participant as it has no semantic content, although it fulfils both 
a syntactic function as Subject (5.1.2) and a textual function as ‘presentative’ element 
(30.4). The single participant is the Existent, which may refer to a countable entity 
(There’s a good film on at the Scala), an uncountable entity (There’s roast lamb for 
lunch) or an event (There was an explosion).
Semantically, existential processes state not simply the existence of something, but 
more usually expand the Existent in some way:
••
by adding a quantitative measure and/or the location of the Existent:
I went for a walk in the woods. It was all right, there were lots of people there.
[GUK]
There were all sorts of practical problems.
• 
with quantification and an Attribute characterising the Existent:
There 	 are 	
some pages	
blank.
There	
were	 few people 	 in favour.
••
with quantification and expansion of the Existent by the addition of clauses:
There 	 are	
few people who realise the danger.
There 	 ’s	
nothing to be done about it.

C O N C E P T U A L I S I N G  PAT T E R N S  O F  E X P E R I E N C E  
1 8 5
The process in existential clauses is expressed by the following verbs:
• 
most typically by be;
• 
certain intransitive verbs expressing positional states (stand, lie, stretch, hang and 
remain);
• 
a few intransitive dynamic verbs of ‘occurring’, ‘coming into view’ or ‘arrival on 
the scene’ (occur, follow, appear, emerge, loom) (→ 30.4.3 for discourse functions ).
There remain many problems.
There followed a long interval.
There emerged from the cave a huge brown bear.
Existential there may be omitted when a locative or directional Adjunct is in initial 
position:
Below the castle (there) stretches a vast plain.
Out of the mist (there) loomed a strange shape.
Without ‘there’ such clauses are very close semantically to reversed circumstantial 
clauses. However, the addition of a tag question – with there, not a personal pronoun 
(Close to the beach stands a hotel, doesn’t there? *doesn’t it? ) – suggests that they are in 
fact existentials.

UNIT 26
CIRCUMSTANCES	
SUMMARY
The circumstantial element in English covers a great variety of meanings, of which 
some of the most common are those related to place and time, manner, accom­
paniment, degree, role, matter and evidence. Range is the non-prototypical
participant that specifies the domain or scope of the verb. In certain cases 
Range elements are morphologically related, as in sing a song, sigh a deep 
sigh, smile a mysterious smile, live a quiet life, the frost froze hard, day dawned. 
The Range element today is mostly derived from deverbal nominals as in have 
a chat, a rest , a smoke in combination with a ‘light’ verb such as have or do.
26.1  PLACE, TIME AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
There are many parallel expressions of place and time, in many cases introduced by 
the same preposition (→ Unit 59):

Locative, goal and directional meanings are questioned by where? (the preposition 
to is not used in questions other than the verbless Where to?); source meanings by where
 . . . from? and for time, since when? extent by how far? how long? and distribution by 
how often?
A.  Manner:  The notion of manner (How?) is extended to include the notions of 
means (By what means?, comparison (What like?)and instrumentality (What with?):
Manner	
how?	
Don’t do it that way; do it gently.
Means	
how?	
It’s cheaper by bus.
Comparison	
what . . . like?	
She was sobbing like a child.
Instrumentality	
What . . . with?	
He drew out the nail with a pair of pliers.
B.  Cause, Purpose, Reason, Concession and Condition:
Cause	
what cause?	
The child took the pen out of envy.
	
	
They are dying of hunger.
Purpose	
what . . . for?	
He is studying for a degree.
	
	
The team is training to win.
Reason	
why?	
We stayed in on account of the rain. 
	
	
He stopped because he was tired.
Concession	 despite what conditions?	
In spite of the delay, we reached the
	
	
concert hall in time.
Condition	
under what conditions?	
Book on an earlier flight, if necessary.
C.  Accompaniment  involves either the notion of ‘togetherness’ or that of 
‘additionality’. Each of these can be either positive or negative:
togetherness	
positive	
Tom came with his friend/with a new haircut.
togetherness	
negative	
Tom came without his friend/without the car.
additionality	
positive	
Tom came as well as Paul.
additionality	
negative	
Tom came instead of Paul.

D.  Degree: Circumstantial expressions of degree either emphasise or attenuate the 
process:
emphasis 	
I completely forgot to bring my passport.
attenuation	
You can hardly expect me to believe that.
E.  Role answers the question What as? or In what capacity?
I’m speaking to you as a friend.
As an actor he’s not outstanding, but as a dancer he’s brilliant.
F.  Matter: This element adds the notion of ‘with reference to . . . ’ and is realised 
by a wide variety of simple and complex prepositions, including those bound or 
grammaticised prepositions that follow certain verbs and nouns such as deprive of, 
news of, (→10.3 and 59.1):
We have been talking about the current economic crisis.
Is there any news of the missing seamen?
With regard to your order of July 17 . . . 
As for that, I don’t believe a word of it. 
G.  Evidence relates to the source of information in verbal processes and is expressed 
by as x says, or according to x:
According to the weatherman, there will be heavy snowstorms this weekend.
26.2  RANGE
Range is a non-prototypical participant: the nominal concept that is implied by the 
process as its scope or range: song in sing a song, games in play games, race in run a race. 
Some, such as live a happy life, die a martyr’s death, are derived from a related verb; 
others such as games in play games are not.
Perhaps the most common type of Range element today are the deverbal nominals 
which complement lexically ‘light’ verbs such as have and give:
Have an argument, a chat, a drink, a fight, a rest, a quarrel, a smoke, a taste, an 
experience
Give a push, a kick, a nudge, a shove, a smile, a laugh, a kiss; a presentation, a lecture
Take a sip, a bath, a nap, a photograph, a selfie, a shower, a walk.
Do a dance, a handstand, a sketch, a translation, some work, some cleaning, some 
painting
Ask a question, favour
Make a choice, a comment, a contribution, a mistake, a payment, a reduction, a 
suggestion. American English: a left/right turn.

C O N C E P T U A L I S I N G  PAT T E R N S  O F  E X P E R I E N C E  
1 8 9
Using this type of range participant (a kick, a push, etc.) with a ‘light’ verb entails the 
meaning of the nominal as verb. In other words, if you take a sip of the juice, you sip 
the juice. If we have a chat, we chat. In some cases, such as make an effort, there is no 
corresponding verb. One reason for the popularity of this construction today is the 
potential that the noun has for being modified in various ways. It would be difficult 
to express by a verb, even with the help of adverbs, the meanings of specificness, 
quantification and quality present in she took a long, relaxing hot bath, they played two 
strenuous games of tennis, I had such a strange experience yesterday.
As a result of modification, the nominal is longer and heavier than the verb which 
precedes it. This allows us to have the important information at the end, where it 
receives end-focus (→ 30.3.2). Furthermore, the Range nominal can initiate a wh-cleft 
structure more easily than a verb can (→ 30.2) as in A good rest is what you need.

CONCEPTUALISING	
UNIT 27
EXPERIENCES FROM A
DIFFERENT ANGLE
Nominalisation and grammatical metaphor
SUMMARY
1 	 The semantic structures described so far reflect the basic semantic-syntactic 
correspondences we use when encoding situations. They reflect the typical 
way of saying things. Agents carry out actions that affect other participants, 
Experiencers perceive Phenomena. Furthermore, processes have been real­
ised by verbs, entities by nouns, and Attributes by (for instance) adjectives 
and possessives. These are the basic realisations which are found in the 
language of children and in much everyday spoken English. But any state 
of affairs can be conceptualised and expressed in more than one way. 
A more nominalised version encodes actions and states as nouns, which 
involves a complete restructuring of the clause. This has been called ‘gram­
matical metaphor’. Its most obvious characteristic is nominalisation.
2 	 Thus, a process can be realised as an entity: government spending is one 
example. Similar transferred functions occur with attributes and circum­
stances. These alternative realisations of the semantic roles involve further 
adjustments in the correspondences between semantic roles and syntactic 
functions in the clause.
3 	 Grammatical metaphor is a feature of much written English and of spoken 
English in professional registers.
4 	 The ‘transitivity hypothesis’ offers an alternative view, in which transitivity 
is a matter of gradation from high to low.
27.1  BASIC REALISATIONS AND METAPHORICAL 
REALISATIONS
Situations and events can be conceptualised and expressed linguistically in two major 
ways. More transparent, because they are closer to the speaker’s experience, are the 
basic transitivity patterns that we have examined so far throughout this chapter. In 
these semantic structures the processes, participants and circumstances are encoded 
by their typical clause functions, with agency and chronological sequencing made 
explicit. That is, in active clauses, the inherent participants such as Agent, Affected, 

C O N C E P T U A L I S I N G  PAT T E R N S  O F  E X P E R I E N C E  
1 9 1
Experiencer and Carrier are realised by NGs, processes are realised by VGs and 
circumstantials by PPs and by AdvGs. This correspondence between the semantics 
and the syntax of English structures is indeed the typical one, but it is by no means the 
only one.
We have to beware of assuming that a one-to-one correspondence exists between 
any semantic function and any syntactic function. We have to beware of assuming that 
entities such as people and things are necessarily expressed by nouns, that actions 
are necessarily expressed by verbs and that qualities are necessarily expressed by 
adjectives. Except in the language of children and in very basic English, our linguistic 
representation of reality tends to be more complex. Any situation can be expressed 
in more than one way; the first or typical realisation may be called the ‘iconic’ one, in 
which the form mirrors the meaning; the other is the ‘metaphorical’ or ‘nominalised’. 
The two forms may be illustrated by an example.
Suppose that I wish to tell you that my friends and I walked in the evening along the 
river as far as Henley. In the ‘typical’ or ‘iconic’ version, I first select the process type 
from the options ‘material’, ‘mental’ and ‘relational’ processes. A process of ‘doing’ fits 
the conceptualised situation best, and more specifically, a process of motion which 
includes manner. Among possible types of motion I select a material process walk. To 
accompany a process such as walk used intransitively, I then select an Agent, or ‘doer’ 
of the action, and a number of circumstantial elements, of time, place and direction as a 
setting, to give the following semantic structure and its lexico-grammatical realisation:
Agent
Material 
process
Time circ.
Place circ.
Goal circ.
NG 
We
VG
walked
PP
in the evening
PP
along the river
PP
to Henley
Figure 5.19  Basic realisations of semantic roles.
This is not the only way of expressing this situation. Instead, I could have said Our 
evening walk along the river took us to Henley. In this ‘nominalised’ interpretation the 
semantic functions are ‘transferred’ in relation to the syntactic functions. The material 
process walk has now become Agent, and the circumstances of time (in the evening) 
and place (along the river) have become classifier and post-modifier, respectively, of 
the new Agent realised at subject (evening walk along the river). The original Agent we is 
now divided into two; one part functions as possessor of the Subject entity (our evening 
walk along the river), the other as Affected (us) of a new material process expressed by 
the verb took. Only the Goal circumstance to Henley is realised in the same way in both 
interpretations:
Agent
Material process
Affected
Goal
NG
Our evening walk 
along the river
VG
took
NG
us
PP
to Henley

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
This second interpretation is a very simple instance of ‘grammatical metaphor’ or 
alternative realisations of semantic functions, and is a phenomenon which occurs all 
the time, in different degrees, in adult language, especially in certain written genres.
Even in everyday spoken language it sometimes happens that the metaphorical 
form has become the normal way of expressing a certain meaning. We have seen 
that the Range element (→ 20.1) drink/chat/rest in have a drink/chat/rest is the one 
that expresses the process, while the syntactic function of Predicator is now realised 
by the‘light’ verb have. These are simple types of transferred semantic functions 
which have been incorporated into everyday language. Now compare the ordinary 
correspondences in example a below with the nominalised version of b:
Agent/Subject
a People in all 
countries
Material process

are [now] travelling
Place/Adv

abroad
Comparison/Adv
much more than they 
used to.
Abstract Subject

on the increase.
Figure 5.21  Two cognitive mappings of a situation.
In a we have a process of ‘doing’ (are travelling), with an Agent/Subject and three 
circumstances (now, abroad and much more than they used to). In b, by contrast, the 
process is relational with be, the human Agent has disappeared, and instead we have 
an abstract subject based on the verb ‘travel’ (foreign travel), followed by two circum- 
stances. Apart from these differences, we note that the two meanings are not quite 
equivalent. The notion of ‘all countries’ is replaced by the less explicit ‘everywhere’, 
that of ‘abroad’ is replaced by ‘foreign’, while the notions expressed by ‘now’ and ‘used 
to’ are not encoded at all, but remain implicit.
More importantly, the two versions represent two different cognitive mappings of a 
situation on to different semantic and syntactic structures. The event is ‘perspectivised’ 
differently in each case, with attention centred in the second on the salient abstraction 
‘foreign travel’, rather than on persons.
27.2  NOMINALISATION AS A FEATURE OF GRAMMATICAL 
METAPHOR 
It is clear that a choice of transferred realisations such as these has as one result the 
loss of human agency, which is usually replaced by an abstraction related to the original 
Agent (government spending, foreign travel). A second result is an increase in lexical density: 
Nominal groups become long and heavy. For this reason, nominalisation is the form of 
grammatical metaphor most consistently recognised under different labels. It distances 
us from the event, raising the representation of a situation to a higher level of abstraction. 
Once objectified and depersonalised in this way, the event or abstraction is conceptualised 
as if it had temporal persistence, instead of the transience associated with a verb.
At the same time, nominalisations are more versatile than verbs. The noun 
‘explosion’ from ‘explode’ can carry out all the functions realised by nominals, such 

C O N C E P T U A L I S I N G  PAT T E R N S  O F  E X P E R I E N C E  
1 9 3
as a Subject or Direct Object (The explosion occurred at 6 a.m.; leaking gas caused an 
explosion). With this new status as a referent, a nominalisation can give the impression 
that what it expresses is a recognised piece of information, whose validity is beyond 
dispute. Compare the following a extract from a news item with the non-nominalised 
b version:
a.	 Government spending showed positive growth in the last quarter in contrast to its 
sharp fall in the previous one.
b.	 The government spent much more in the last quarter than was planned, whereas 
it spent considerably less in the previous one.
As soon as we examine samples of more formal English – that used in specialised fields 
such as the natural sciences, the social sciences, politics, administration and business, 
finance and technology – we find a great number of such nominalisations. These tend 
to be abstract nouns derived from verbs and other parts of speech, which can encode 
quite complex meanings.
Lexical metaphor can occur together with grammatical metaphor, as illustrated by 
‘growth’ and ‘fall’, so common in texts on economics. Here, grammar borders on lexis, 
and different languages have different means of visualising one semantic function as if 
it were another. Here we can do no more than briefly outline some of the transfers of 
semantic functions. In the following sections, ‘metaphorical’ forms are given first, with 
a basic corresponding meaning suggested in the right-hand column.
27.2.1  Process realised as entity
This is by far the most common type of grammatical metaphor. Many are institution- 
alised nominalisations, such as the following:
	
Nominalised form	
Basic form
a.	 Without the slightest hesitation.	
Without hesitating at all.
b.	 Take a deep breath.	
Breathe deeply.
c.	 There was a sudden burst of	
X burst out laughing suddenly.
	
laughter.
d.	 The exploration and mapping of	
X continued to explore and map the world.
	
the world went on.
Many others, however, represent a more original view of reality on the part of the 
speaker or writer, as in example e:
e. 	 His conception of the drama has 	
He conceives of the drama in a way that
	
a very modern ring.	
sounds very modern to us.
27.2.2  Attribute realised as entity
An Attribute can be realised as an entity by means of an abstract noun. The forms may 
be morphologically related: bigness–big as in example a and usefulness–useful in b. The 
remaining parts of the sentence may have different correspondences, which are not in 
a one-to-one relationship with the forms of the nominalised version.

1 9 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
a.	 Bigness is paid for, in part, by 	
If firms are very big, they will be fewer and 
	
fewness, and a decline in	
will have less need to compete.
	
competition.
b.	 The usefulness of this machinery 	
This machinery is becoming less useful.
	
is dwindling.
27.2.3  Circumstance as entity
A common shift is to have a temporal circumstance functioning as a locative Subject. 
This involves a new verb, such as ‘find’, ‘witness’ and ‘see’ in these examples:
a.	 August 12 found the travellers in	
The travellers were/arrived in Rome
	
Rome.	
on August 12.
b.	 The last decade has witnessed	
During the last decade agricultural
	
an unprecedented rise in	
technology has increased as never before.
	
agricultural technology.
c.	 The seventeenth century saw the	 In the seventeenth century scientific works
	
development of systematic	
began to be published systematically.
	
scientific publication.
As these new processes are transitive, typically taking an Object, further nominalisa­
tions are to be expected, such as rise (or increase) in agricultural technology, instead of 
increase as a verb. In many cases, such as c it is difficult to ‘unpack’ the metaphorical 
encoding completely into a simpler form. The two forms of expression are the result of 
different cognitive encodings.
27.2.4  Dependent situation as entity
A whole state of affairs, which in its congruent form would be realised as a subordinate 
clause, can be visualised as an entity and expressed by a nominal:
Fears of disruption to oil supplies	
Because people feared that oil would not 
from the Gulf helped push crude oil	
be supplied as usual from the Gulf, the 
prices up dramatically. 	
price of crude oil rose dramatically.
We can observe that, in many cases of nominalisation, normal human Agents and 
Experiencers are absent, replaced by abstractions that are in some way related to them 
(‘fears’, ‘laughter’) and may be more emotionally charged. In other cases, those where 
a temporal entity ‘witnesses’ the event, the human Agent may not be recoverable at 
all, as in b and c above.
These few examples may serve to show that in English grammatical metaphor is 
a powerful option in the presenting of information. It reconceptualises an event as a 
participant, with the consequent restructuring of the rest of the clause, which influences 
the way the information is perceived. It presents a different cognitive mapping from 
that of the ‘congruent’ or iconic correspondence between syntax and semantics that 
is found in basic English. In institutionalised settings, the concept of grammatical 
metaphor goes a long way towards explaining professional jargons such as journalese

1 9 5
and officialese as written forms. Others, such as the language of business management, 
use nominalisation in spoken as well as written English (→ summary of processes, 
participants and circumstances).
27.3  HIGH AND LOW TRANSITIVITY
A different approach to transitivity, which has not been discussed in this chapter for 
reasons of space, is the ‘transitivity hypothesis’. This views transitivity in discourse as 
a matter of gradation, dependent on various factors. A verb such as kick, for example, 
fulfils all the criteria for high transitivity in a clause with an expressed object such as 
Ted kicked the ball. It refers to an action (B) in which two participants (A) are involved, 
Agent and Object; it is telic (having an end-point) (C) and is punctual (D). With a 
human subject it is volitional (E) and agentive, while the object will be totally affected 
(I) and individuated (J). The clause is also affirmative (F) and declarative, realis, not 
hypothetical (irrealis) (G). By contrast, with a verb such as see as in Ted saw the accident, 
most of the criteria point to low transitivity, while the verb wish as in I wish you were here 
includes even irrealis (G) in its complement as a feature of low transitivity. Susan left is 
interpreted as an example of reduced transitivity. Although it has only one participant, 
it rates higher than some two-participant clauses, as it fulfils B, C, D, E, F, G and H.

THEME: THE POINT OF 	
UNIT 28
DEPARTURE OF THE MESSAGE	
SUMMARY
1 	 Theme is an element of the thematic structure of a clause; the other element 
is Rheme. It is therefore a different category from the syntactic Subject 
and from the discourse category of Topic – what the message is about –
although these three often coincide in one wording.
2 	 It is convenient to think of Topics as organised hierarchically according to 
their level of operation: a global topic is what the whole text or discourse 
is about, an episode topic represents what a shorter, but integrated, stretch 
of talk or writing is about. Local topics are the main referents that persist 
throughout a stretch of text by means of anaphora, establishing a partici­
pant frame or referent chain. They are the topics most clearly related to 
grammatical categories. English makes use of certain devices to introduce 
new referents, potential topics, into the discourse and to maintain topic 
continuity.
3 	 Theme is identified as the first clause constituent and communicatively is 
the point of departure of the message. When Theme conflates with Topic 
and Subject it can be called topical Theme. When Theme is realised by 
a temporal or spatial Adjunct it is a circumstantial Theme, which sets up 
a time/space frame within which the participant chain develops. More 
marked Themes such as fronted Complement and Object have a local tex­
tual function, such as initiating a change of direction by means of contrast. 
Relating Theme to grammar, Theme is unmarked when it coincides with 
the expected element, such as Subject in a declarative clause. When some 
other element is brought to initial position it is a marked Theme, and carries 
some additional significance in the discourse. Objects, Complements and 
Adjuncts can be thematised/fronted. Whole clauses can be thematised in 
complex sentences.
4 	 Other items which tend to be placed at the beginning of the clause may 
be considered to be part of the Theme. These include connective Adjuncts 
such as however, stance Adjuncts such as personally, vocatives (Doctor!) 
and discourse markers such as Well. In this way we can talk of ‘multiple 
Themes’. They are not, however, topics. A subordinate clause in initial 
position may be considered as Theme of a clause complex.

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Our attention in the two previous chapters has centred on two kinds of meaning: expe­
riential meaning, which is encoded in the grammar in terms of participants, processes 
and circumstances, and interpersonal meaning, as encoded by the mood structures. 
We now turn to a third type of meaning, which helps us to organise and relate indi­
vidual sentences and utterances within our discourse. This is textual meaning. We will 
be considering three important dimensions of textual meaning which have a place in 
English grammar and contribute to discourse coherence: first, the Theme–Rheme tex­
tual structure and its relation to Topic; second, the order of constituents in the clause 
and how the normal order may be altered to achieve different textual effects; and third, 
the distribution and focus of information, which makes an essential contribution to 
coherence and understandability in spoken and written English.
INTRODUCTION
To start, consider the following versions of the same piece of information about a 
coach tour:
1 	 We’ll reach Lancaster, but not Carlisle, by noon
2 	 By noon we’ll reach Lancaster but not Carlisle.
3 	 Lancaster, but not Carlisle, we’ll reach by noon.
All three utterances have the same experiential meaning: the content is the same. All 
three would normally be used to make a statement, and so they are interpersonally 
equivalent too. The difference between 1, 2 and 3 lies in the textual component of 
meaning: the information is the same, but the message is arranged or ‘packaged’ in 
different ways, and the different forms highlight different aspects of the message. More 
specifically, the element which occupies first position in the clause is different in the 
three examples: in 1 it is we, in 2 it is before noon and in 3 it is Lancaster. This element is 
the Theme of the clause. Since first position is salient, what to put in it is an important 
choice, particularly in connected discourse.
28.1  THEME AND RHEME
Theme and Rheme are the two components which together make up the organisa­
tional construct that is the thematic structure of the clause. The Theme comes first and 
is identified as the first constituent in the clause. What follows is the Rheme.
Looking at the clause as a unit of communication, we can say that Theme is the 
clause constituent which, whatever its syntactic function, is selected to be the point 
of departure of the clause as message. What goes in initial position is important for 
both speaker and hearer. It represents the angle from which the message is projected 
and sets up a frame which holds at least to the end of the clause. For the speaker, 
the communicative choice associated with Theme is ‘What notion shall I take as my 
starting-point in this clause? Shall I start by saying where we are going? Or shall I 
start with the ‘time-frame’ – by noon? Or with the places we’ll visit?’ From whichever 
point of departure we choose, the rest of the clause must proceed. For the hearer 
or reader Theme acts as a signal, creating expectations and laying the foundation

for the hearer’s mental representation of how the message will unfold. Given these 
cognitive and communicative functions, it is not surprising that the element in initial 
position is so important.
While the Theme lays the basis of the message, the Rheme says something in rela­
tion to it. Typically, important new information is presented in the Rheme. Let’s dia­
gram this thematic structure on to our previous examples:
Theme
Rheme
1
We
’ll reach Lancaster, but not Carlisle, by noon. 
2
By noon
we’ll reach Lancaster, but not Carlisle.
3
Lancaster, but not 
Carlisle
we’ll reach b y  noon.
28.2  UNMARKED THEME AND MARKED THEME IN DECLARATIVE 
CLAUSES
In selecting Theme, speakers must choose between a neutral order of clause constitu­
ents or a marked order. The order of clause elements in 1 has the Subject as Theme. 
This is the neutral, unmarked choice in a declarative clause, used when there is no 
good reason to depart from the usual. Any other constituent but the Subject will be 
marked, and signals an additional meaning. In the case of 2 the Theme is a circum- 
stance of time, syntactically an Adjunct, and is marked. However, it does not strike 
us as very unusual. This is because adjuncts of time can occupy several positions in 
the clause. Theme 3 is an Object participant whose normal position is after the verb. 
Objects are not so mobile and sound highly marked in English when brought to initial 
position. Marked constituent orders always signal some additional meaning and have 
to be motivated. Thematised Objects tend to express a contrast with something said 
or expected by the hearer. By specifying Lancaster but not Carlisle as the Object, the 
speaker refers explicitly to a contrary expectation and justifies the thematised element. 
We will return shortly to the most frequent types of marked Theme. For the moment, 
you can ‘feel’ that certain elements sound more striking than others when in initial 
position.
From these considerations, it is clear that the Theme of a clause represents a 
choice, both as the absolute point of departure of a discourse and also that of each 
subsequent clause and of each paragraph. It gives us the choice of taking as point 
of departure one or other participant in the situation described, or something else, 
such as a circumstance. It can serve to link up with what has gone before in the dis­
course and it helps to push the message forward. Because sentences do not normally 
occur in isolation, and previous sentences and utterances condition later ones, not 
all thematic choices will be equally appropriate from the point of view of creating a 
coherent whole.
28.3 THEME IN NON-DECLARATIVE CLAUSES
All the examples seen so far are of declarative clauses. In these the unmarked Theme 
is Subject. Non-declarative clauses, that is, interrogatives and imperatives, have 

2 0 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
unmarked Themes derived from their respective clause type, as illustrated in the exam­
ples below.
In examples, 4 to 7, the starting-point of the clause is the expected one, which 
announces the clause-type. Theme is marked when any other but the expected one is 
placed in initial position, as in examples 8 to 10. Marked Themes in non-declarative 
clauses are relatively uncommon.
Unmarked Themes 
  4	 Are we going to Carlisle? 	
Operator + subject in yes/no interrogative
  5	 When will we get there? 	
Wh-word in wh-interrogative
  6	 Have your tickets ready! 	
Base form of verb in 2nd person (imperative)
  7	 Let’s go for a swim instead. 	
Let’s in 1st person (imperative) 
Marked Themes 
  8	 We are going where? 	
Non wh-subject in a wh-interrogative
  9	 Do hurry up, all of you!	
Emphatic do in an imperative
10	 You keep quiet!	
Subject in an imperative 
In yes/no interrogatives in English, unmarked Theme is the Finite operator (→ 3.1), 
together with the Subject, as in 4. In wh-interrogatives, the Theme is the wh-word as 
in 5. In 2nd person imperative clauses, unmarked Theme is the verb, as in 6, and let’s 
in first person imperatives, as in 7. Any other order is marked. When the wh-element 
is displaced, as in 8, the element that remains as Theme (we) is marked for a wh-
interrogative. Emphatic do, as in 9, and the Subject you, as in 10, are marked Themes 
in the imperative.
28.4  TOPIC, THEME AND SUBJECT
Topic is a discourse category which corresponds to ‘what the text, or part of the text, 
is about’. A whole book, chapter, essay or lecture can have a topic, for instance, ‘car 
maintenance’ or ‘the English novel in the 20th century’. A topic which coherently 
organises a whole piece of language can be called a global topic. (More exactly, of 
course, it is speakers and writers who have topics and do the organising of the text.) On 
an intermediate level, paragraphs or sections in writing and ‘episodes’ in talk each 
have their own topics. In writing, these will typically be organised under the ‘umbrella’ 
of the global topic, but they display an internal coherence of their own. Finally, utter­
ances and sentences have topics which contribute to the episode and help to build up 
the discourse as a whole. We call these local topics.
All three levels of topic are integrated in normal texts and discourses. Local 
topics are usually the only ones that have a direct grammatical realisation. They 
are associated with the main referential entities represented in speakers’ sentences 
and utterances, which to be coherent will have to relate in some way to the higher 
levels of topicality of the discourse as a whole. Sentence and utterance topics are 
the most relevant to the study of grammar, because this is one area in which dis­
course interfaces with a ‘pragmatic grammar’. In a functional grammar of English, 
we are interested in seeing how the category of mainly local topic interacts with 
Subject and with Theme.

28.5 COGNITIVE FEATURES OF THE TOPIC
A number of cognitive features have been associated with major topic entities. First, 
the topic entity is inherent to the event described and it initiates the action.
Second, the topic entity is typically high on what is called the empathy hierarchy. 
This has to do with what attracts our empathy. It starts from the speaker, since we all 
empathise most with ourselves, and continues as follows:
Speaker > hearer > human > animal > physical object > abstract entity
After the speaker, the hearer – as co-participant in a conversation – can be important, 
and is included with the speaker in the inclusive use of ‘we’, as in 1. But in many 
discourses a 3rd person topic is even more common, in that we frequently talk and 
write about people, creatures and things distinct from the speaker and hearer. Abstract 
entities come last in the empathy hierarchy.
A third feature is definiteness. This is a subjective factor since it depends on 
whether speakers and hearers have established empathy with the topic. When contact 
has been established, the topic is easily accessible and is definite.
Fourth, the topic is the most salient participant on the scene of discourse.
From the point of view of cognitive salience, all these features are closely associ­
ated with the Subject function in English. The prototypical Subject referent is inherent 
to the event described in the clause; it fulfils the semantic function of Agent, if there 
is an Agent, and initiates the action. It is typically human and definite and is the main 
participant at any one point on the scene of discourse as represented in a particular 
clause or utterance. Subject and Topic are therefore closely related in English. (It must 
be pointed out that this does not imply that all Subjects have these characteristics.)
These features are not, however, necessarily associated with Theme. Theme and 
Topic are quite different types of category. Topics are what a text, section or clause is 
about, and Topic is always conceptualised as an entity or a nominalisation (→ Unit 21).
Theme, on the other hand, is what the speaker or writer chooses as the point of depar­
ture for the message in any one clause or sentence. It may be an entity, a circumstance 
or an attribute. Only entities initiate referential chains. Let’s look now at the main types 
of themes, starting from the most central.
28.6  TOPIC AND SUBJECT AS THEME
Themes which conflate with Subject are participants in the transitivity structures and 
typically refer to persons, creatures and things. As such, they are the most likely can­
didates to fulfil the discourse role of Topic or ‘topical Theme’ at clause level. They are 
typically presented by the speaker as identifiable or at least accessible to the hearer 
and are usually encoded by full nominal groups or proper names when introduced for 
the first time. Important Theme-Topic-Subject referents set up referent chains which 
can transcend clausal boundaries, maintaining topic continuity as long as the speaker 
or writer wishes. This is an important test for ‘aboutness’. Many referents enter the 
discourse, but only a few are selected to be major topics.
We can track the referent chain, which can also be seen as an identity chain, of a major 
referent as it is repeated across several clauses by an anaphoric pronoun, by an alternative 
NG or by repetition of the name or proper noun. Such is the case in the extract adapted 
from the obituary by Clancy Sigal in The Guardian of the American actress Bette Davis:

2 1 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Bette Davis was the most formidable screen actress of her time. She imposed her will on 
audiences, and on often inferior material, with determination and galvanic force . . . For 
better, and sometimes worse, she personified the ‘new woman’ with all her contradic­
tions and hysterias . . . 
Davis was building a certain kind of woman on the screen, the like of which had often 
been hinted at but never fully revealed. Tortured and self-torturing, she won her fans 
often by playing against their sympathies . . . 
Unlike many actresses of her generation who retired rather than let audiences feast 
voyeuristically on the fading remnants of their beauty, Davis – the ugly duckling –
positively gloried in exposing her wrinkles and bloodshot, staring eyes. In the 1960s 
she played a succession of grotesque old dears, in pictures like Whatever Happened To 
Baby Jane (opposite her one-time rival, Joan Crawford). 
The ‘referent chain’ of this paragraph can be shown graphically as follows: Bette Davis 
(Subject, proper name) – she (Subject pron., three times) –(Subject, surname) – Davis 
(+alternative NG the ugly duckling).
Indefinite, and therefore unidentified, but specific referents as Subject Themes are also 
found in English, however. We might start up a conversation by saying A man I met in Beirut 
once told me a good story. At this point in the discourse we haven’t established contact with 
either the man or the story, and for this reason both are presented as indefinite. Similarly, 
news items often present an indefinite, but specific (→ 46.2), Subject Theme such as the fol­
lowing adapted item in which both the commission and the man are indefinite but specific:
A special commission set up by the Kremlin in an attempt to improve the status of 
Russian women is to be presided over by a man.
28.7  INTRODUCING NEW POTENTIAL TOPICS INTO
THE DISCOURSE
New referents have to be introduced into the discourse in order to be discussed. 
Some languages have specific morphological markers to indicate that something is 
being presented as a potential new topic. English has no such morphological devices, 
but there are still ways of presenting new referents into the discourse. These include 
the following:
1 	 The subject of an intransitive clause (including copular clauses) can present or 
identify a new entity. Such is the case with an urban fox in the sentence An urban 
fox appears in our garden every morning. When spoken, extra pitch and stress (→ 
29.1) help the hearer to make contact with the new referent.
2 	 When the Subject is known, the direct object often introduces a new entity: I 
saw a most extraordinary person in the park this afternoon. It has been esti­
mated that between them the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of 
a transitive verb account for the majority of new entities introduced in spoken 
discourse.

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 1 1
3 	 Unstressed there with be – or a presentative verb such as appear, which has the 
same effect – can introduce a new referent, as in There was a good programme on 
television last night (→ 30.4).
4	
A statement can explicitly inform the hearer what the Topic is going to be, as in 
Today I want to talk to you about genetic engineering.
5 	 Inversion of a copular clause can introduce a new Topic, as in Worst of all was the 
lack of fresh water (→ 28.9).
It must be emphasised that not every entity introduced into the discourse is maintained 
as a major topic with its own identity chain. Many do not survive the first mention, 
such is the volume of incoming detail to be processed mentally. In conversation, estab- 
lishing a discourse topic is eminently collaborative, and some new entities may not be 
considered newsworthy enough to survive.
28.8  CIRCUMSTANTIAL ADJUNCTS AS THEMES
Among the marked Themes, Circumstantial Adjuncts – particularly those of time and 
place – are the least unusual. Comparing the examples below, we can say that the 
circumstantials in London last year have been transferred from their normal position in 
the Rheme in 1 to initial position in 2; that is, they have been thematised or ‘fronted’.
Theme 	
Rheme
1 We 	
did a lot of sightseeing in London last year.
2 In London last year,	
we did a lot of sightseeing.
The function of such circumstantials is to set the necessary temporal and/or spatial 
coordinates of the text world within which the participants move, establishing a time- 
frame or place-frame for the rest of the message. Such frames or settings can hold 
over wide spans of discourse, until a different frame is set up. Such is the case with this 
text by Caroline Law in The Week:
One morning earlier this month, I awoke to the peaceful sound of a babbling 
brook, which was odd, since I live in inner London. Outside my bedroom win­
dow, water was coursing down the gutter. After a couple of days, I realised it 
was possibly my civic duty to report the leaks to Thames Water, which I duly did.
A week later, the water was still pouring down the street. Surely, I reasoned, 
with reservoirs empty and threats of hose pipe bans, they wouldn’t knowingly 
allow thousands of gallons to go to waste. There must have been a misunder­
standing. I rang back. There was no mistake: a contractor was on the case.
By 15 February the babbling of the brook was beginning to get on my 
nerves. I rang again, to be told nothing could be done until the 24th – fully three 
weeks from the date the leak was first reported. I sent off a furious email – and 
immediately received an automatic reply, containing this little homily: ‘Water 
is precious. A running tap can waste up to six litres of water a minute . . . Help 
save water by putting a plug in the sink when you run the tap. It’s the non-rainy 
days we all need to save for.’

2 1 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Initial circumstantials of time constitute a useful device for structuring lengthy 
stretches of text on a chronological basis. Time and place adjuncts do not initiate cohe­
sive chains, however, although they can be referred to anaphorically in subsequent 
clauses by the adverbs there and then, respectively: We went to the theatre in London, and 
it was there that I learned some Cockney slang.
There is competition between subject and adjunct Themes for initial position. If 
chronological sequencing is adopted as a method of development of the text, as in this 
extract, temporal Themes are chosen to mark crucial points, while the topic (a babbling 
brook, water) takes second position, although it is Subject. The topical participant chain 
of the running water is built up within the time-span created by the Theme. While cir­
cumstantial Themes are important in mapping the surface development, it is the topic 
referents, (participant Themes when initial), however, which structure the cognitive 
development of the text as a whole, in terms of its global topic.
28.9 OBJECTS AND COMPLEMENTS AS THEMES
Apart from contrast, another motivation for thematising direct objects is that of retro­
spective linking to something in the previous sentence or context:
Moussaka you ordered, and moussaka you’ve got.
Janet asked me to bring her some tea from London. This I did.
When subject complements are thematised they tend to occur as evaluative com­
ments made spontaneously in context, often in response to another speaker. In each 
case, there is retrospective linking. Identifying clauses, such as The music was the best 
of all, are reversible. When reversed, as in 2, they look both backwards and forwards, 
linking to something just said, but also marking a shift to something new.
1	
[How did the meeting go?] – A complete waste of time it was (Subject Complement.
	
The unmarked order: It was a complete waste of time.)
2	
[Was the festival a success?] Not bad. The best was the music. (reversed identifying 
clause from The music was the best.)
3	
Fantastic I call it! (Object Complement. Unmarked order: I call it fantastic.)
28.10  LESS COMMON THEMATISATIONS IN
THE DECLARATIVE CLAUSE
28.10.1  Negative adverbs
When we place negative adverbs such as never in initial position, we seem to be 
responding to a communicative human need to foreground and emphasise the nega­
tion. But while Never! can be used as a one-word negative response in conversation, 
thematised negative constituents are much less easy to use in English than in some 
other languages. This is because they trigger the inversion of an existing auxiliary (or 
do-operator) with the subject. Furthermore, thematised negatives have an emphatic, 
marked effect, as can be seen from the following famous utterance made by Winston 

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 1 3
Churchill after the Battle of Britain in the Second World War. The second utterance 
was made as a comment on television about the IRA’s apology in 2002 for the loss of 
life of non-combatants over three decades.
Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.
Never before has the IRA acknowledged the loss of life in its 30-year paramilitary 
campaign.
In everyday use such a rhetorical effect may be undesirable, and it is best to reserve 
fronted negative elements for emphatic statements or directives. With the impera­
tive, there is no inversion, as the base form of the verb is used: Never say ‘never 
again’! Certain dependent clauses of condition are likewise fronted: Should you wish 
to change your mind, please let us know. The negative adjuncts never and under no 
circumstances, fronted semi- negatives such as hardly, scarcely and only + an adverb 
of time all have a marked effect when fronted. Their unmarked position before the 
main verb avoids this problem (I have never seen . . . You must under no circumstances 
leave . . . ).
The positive and negative elements most commonly thematised in everyday spoken 
English are so and neither or nor as substitute words (→ 29.6). They behave like initial 
negatives, provoking operator-subject ordering, but they have no rhetorical effect.
All my friends passed the driving-test and so did I.
A. Never have I seen such a mess! B. Nor have I. 
Under no circumstances must medicines be left within reach of children.
Only then did I realise what he really meant.
28.10.2  Negative Objects
These produce the same inversion, but are much less common. Negative subjects do 
not produce inversion. Compare: Not a thing could the patient remember, where not a 
thing is Object, with No-one could remember a thing, where no-one is Subject.
28.10.3  Adverbs followed by verbs of motion
Initial adverbs such as up, down, in and deictics such as here, there and then are com­
monly used with verbs of motion such as come, go, run. In short spoken utterances they 
accompany or signal actions, such as In you get! (helping someone into a car) or There/ 
Here you go! (handing something to someone). There is no inversion when the subject 
is a pronoun. With a full nominal group, however, the verb and the subject invert: Down 
came the rain and up went the umbrellas: There goes my last dollar! Here comes the 
bus. In certain types of written texts such as historical narrative in tourist brochures, 
this structure can be used to mark a new stage in the narrative, and in such cases usu­
ally initiates a new paragraph, as in:
Then came the Norman Conquest.

2 1 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Only simple tenses are used in this structure, that is, not the progressive or perfect 
combinations.
Thematised verbs rarely occur in the declarative clause in English. When they do, it 
is the non-finite part that is thematised:
He told me to run, so run I did. (Unmarked order: He told me to run, so I did run.)
In the media non-finite and finite forms are sometimes fronted, together with the rest 
of the clause:
Coming up to the stage now is this year’s winner of the Oscar . . . Snapped back the 
18-year-old princess: ‘No comment’.
28.10.4  Detached predicatives
These are units headed by a noun, an adjective or a participle. They are closely tied 
to the subject but, instead of occupying a position after the verb, they are fronted, and 
have the status of supplementives, with an adjunctive function:
A Saxon princess, she was born at Exning near Newmarket around AD 630, the 
daughter of Anna, King of the East Angles.
These fronted phrases are common in such genres as fiction, history, advertising and 
tourism, where they provide an economical means of packing information around a 
main topic entity, without holding up the narrative.
N.B. When thematic, they are retrospective, linking up with the immediately preced­
ing text. When they are placed after the subject, they add extra details about the topic 
entity as in the daughter of Anna, King of the East Angles.
28.11  DETACHED THEMES: ABSOLUTE THEME, DISLOCATIONS 
AND DOUBLE THEMES
28.11.1  Absolute Theme
The Themes analysed so far all have a place within the syntax and semantics of the 
clause. This is not the only type, however. Across the world’s languages, a very basic 
way of presenting a ‘newsworthy’ piece of information is by means of a detached lexi­
cal NG standing outside the clause. This ‘Chinese-style topic’ is always a definite NG 
or proper name which does not function as a constituent of the clause which follows 
it. The construction, here called Absolute Theme, is common in the spoken registers 
of many European languages, as illustrated by the following sentence, from Spanish 
(Jiménez Juliá,T ):
Los Beatles, sin Sgt. Pepper no tendríamos ni la mitad de la música pop de ahora. 
(The Beatles) (without Sgt. Pepper) (we wouldn’t have) (even half the pop music [we 
have] now)

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 1 5
The Theme The Beatles is completely detached, with no grammatical relations con- 
necting it to the second part of the message. Nevertheless, it provides a pragmatic 
frame by which the connection is made inferentially, based on contextual knowledge.
Absolute Themes in English occur sometimes in spontaneous talk; they do not 
occur normally in written text. Here are two instances, both from news interviews on 
television. The first is in the context of a public appeal in a police inquiry, the second 
during the anthrax alarm in the aftermath of 11 September 2001. In both, the Absolute 
Theme provides a personal frame to the utterance.
Now Manchester United, their players have been holding up a banner.
The woman who died in New York, that’s obviously affecting her colleagues who 
work in the hospital.
28.11.2  Dislocations
Dislocations are different from Absolute Themes in that the ‘dislocated’ element is a 
constituent of the clause, frequently subject (as in That letter, was it from Bruce?), and 
is repeated by a co-referential pronoun (it in this case) in its normal position within 
the clause. The connection is therefore encoded grammatically, not established infer­
entially. 1 and 2 illustrate what are usually known as left-dislocations, while 3 is a 
right-dislocation:
1	
That letter, was it from Bruce? 	
(compare: Was that letter from Bruce?)
2	
And those flood waters that affected the	
(declarative structure instead of
	
Czech Republic, those are the ones	
interrogative)
that are sweeping towards Germany.	
3	
Is it new, that top – No, I bought it	
(Non-dislocated: Is that top new?)
	
last year.
One explanation sometimes given of left-dislocation is that the speaker presents the 
main person or thing s/he wishes to talk about (that letter, those flood waters that affected 
the Czech Republic) without having worked out the structure to be used. A more positive 
view, cognitively and communicatively, is that by ‘detaching’ the salient referent and 
putting it first, the speaker side-steps grammatical complexity, presenting a ‘topic– 
comment’ structure that is more easily grasped than the normal one. Interrogatives 
and relatives are complex structures in English, and it is in these cases that we can find 
left-dislocation.
Right-dislocations are more problematic to analyse as Themes, as they are not initial, 
but instead are placed after the clause as a full NG, (that top) whose referent had been 
just introduced as a pronoun (it). The traditional view is that the final nominal is an after­
thought, which again, implies a construction failure on the part of the speaker. A cognitive-
functional explanation, however, suggests a motivation for this structure, namely, that of 
making explicit a referent (that top) which was accessible to the speaker in the context, but 
perhaps not so obvious to the hearer, or not in the speaker’s mind at the moment.
Affectivity may provide a different kind of motivation, as in the next two examples. 
In the first the referent was an escaped pig, called McQueen; the second a relative of 
the speaker. In the third, a deictic pronoun this refers to the immediate context:

2 1 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
And he not only flew over the fence, he could swim, that pig.	
(author’s data)
He’s a cool dude, Sam (AmE). 	
(author’s data)
It’s a nice place, this.
28.11.3  Double detached Themes
Two detached Themes may occur together, the first an Absolute, the second a left-
dislocation. The relationship between them must be pragmatically relevant.
1 	 And Ben, his sister, she has disabling osteo-arthritis.
2 	 And this consultant, what I like about him is that he doesn’t pass everyone on to his 
underlings; he attends to you himself.
3 	 The white house opposite, the woman who lives there, her dog, he’s had to be put down.
In 2 there is a wh-cleft, what I like about him (→ 30.2), which is not detached. Both of these 
combinations are heard in spoken English, but rarely find their way into the written lan­
guage. In fact, for many speakers, multiple and even single left-detachments do not occur 
in the best usage. In 3 there are three detached nominal groups, the last of which, her dog, 
is picked up by the pronoun he. The function of multiple detachments is to ‘anchor’ the 
final referent to other related referents, which are presumed to be accessible to the hearer. 
28.12  NON-EXPERIENTIAL THEMES
The Theme of an utterance in English is typically an element in the transitivity struc­
tures. We can allow for a number of non-experiential Themes, which precede the expe­
riential Theme. These can be grouped into two main kinds: interpersonal Themes 
and textual Themes.
Interpersonal Themes
These include three main sub-types. Continuative Themes (or discourse markers), 
such as Now, Oh, well, Ah, please (→ 8.2.8), have various functions as markers of atten­
tion, response, request, state of knowledge, surprise and hesitation, among others. 
Overall, they signal acknowledgements by speakers and transitions from one speaker 
to another or a move to another point in spoken discourse. Examples are:
Now who wants to come to the castle? – Oh, actually I have to do some shopping.
Well, we’ll see you later, then.
Another group of interpersonal Themes, Adjuncts of stance, include three main 
sub- types: epistemic, (certainly), evidential (apparently) and evaluative (surely, 
surprisingly)
1.	 Further sub-types include style adjuncts, such as frankly, honestly, and domain 
adjuncts, such as legally, technologically, consumerwise 2, which limit the domain of 
reference of the rest of the sentence. All are discussed and illustrated in section 8.2.5.

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 1 7
A third type is made up of vocatives, such as Doctor! Mum!, and appellatives – ladies 
and gentlemen – which address people by name or by role or status 3.
1 	 Surely you could find yourself a job somewhere? Honestly, I’ve tried.
2 	 Technologically, though, the new model has not been a success.
3 	 Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. The coach will depart in five 
minutes.
Textual Themes
Textual Themes include a variety of connectors or connective adjuncts such as how­
ever, besides, therefore, now, first, then (non-temporal) next and anyway. These connect 
the clause to the previous part of the text by indicating relations such as addition, con­
cession, reason, consequence, and so on (→ 8.2.7 and 8.2.8).
I don’t feel like playing tennis. Besides, it’s starting to rain.
All these different types of element can be considered as being part of the Theme, 
as long as they are placed before the experiential theme (Subject, Circumstantial, 
Object or Complement). Most of them can function in other positions in the clause, 
and so represent a real choice when used thematically. Coordinators such as and, but 
and or, conjunctions such as when and relative pronouns such as who, which, that are 
inherently thematic and do not have alternative placements. For this reason, they will 
not be taken into account in our analyses.
Non-defining relatives, however, because they are analysed as supplementives
(→ 2.4.1, 49.2), may be considered as having Themes and Rhemes in their own
right. The following sentence may be analysed as two Theme–Rheme units as
follows:
Ladies and gentlemen, this afternoon we are going to visit the cathedral, which 
was built in 1241 not long after the last of the great wars.

By including the many different classes of items within the Theme category, it is pos­
sible to claim that the three macro-functions of language, the experiential, the inter­
personal and the textual, can be represented by items within the Theme. Here is an 
examples of Multiple Themes.

28.13  CLAUSES AS THEMES
Time and place are not the only types of circumstance that can be thematised: other 
types of situational frame can be established.
Coordinated clauses joined by ‘and’ reflect the chronological order of the events 
described. The first clause is therefore the natural temporal and factual starting-point 
of the sequence. For this reason not all coordinate clauses are coherently reversible:
The lone rider got on his horse and rode into the sunset.
*The lone rider rode into the sunset and got on his horse.
Even when the clauses are reversible, the resultant meanings are likely to be different; 
for, as well as chronological sequence, other meanings such as cause and effect are 
implied:
He bought an oil-tanker and made a fortune. (i.e. his fortune resulted from his 
buying the tanker)
He made a fortune and bought an oil-tanker. (i.e.it is implied that he bought the 
tanker after making a fortune)
Subordinate clauses impose no obligation to maintain chronological sequencing. 
However, an initial subordinate clause takes as starting-point the meaning it encodes, 
such as reason 1, simultaneity 2 and condition 3:
1 	 As you weren’t at home, I left a message on your answer-phone.
2 	 As she stepped off the kerb, a cyclist crashed into her.
3 	 If you don’t like it, you can probably change it for something else.
Such initial clauses also set up expectations, which obviously does not happen when 
the subordinate clause is final. For instance, compare examples 4 and 5. Each contains 
a non-finite to-infinitive clause of purpose in either initial or final position, 
respectively:
4 	 To cure stress, try a Jacuzzi whirlpool bath.
5 	 He braked hard to avoid hitting the cyclist.

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 1 9
The initial purpose clause in 4 not only sets up a purpose frame, but also names the 
goal to be achieved. For this reason, the to-infinitive clause here emphasises a sense 
of premeditated purpose, which is much less explicit in 5, where the purpose clause is 
in final position.
The two remaining types of non-finite clause, the participial -ing clause and the-
en clause, are closely tied to the main participant in the discourse (→ Chapter 7). The 
-ing clause 6 is active in meaning and expresses an action or state dependent upon the 
main situation. The -en clause 7 is passive in meaning and is retrospective, summing 
up a previous situation:
6 	 Taking advantage of his present popularity, the Prime Minister called an election.
7 	 Thwarted in the west, Stalin turned east. (H.G. Wells, A Short History of the 
World).
It is useful to remember that speakers adjust their choice of Theme to the context, 
‘attending first to the most urgent task’. When the tourist guide starts with ‘Ladies 
and gentlemen’, for instance, s/he is doing just that: attracting the hearers’ attention 
before giving them the information they need. Context is understood here to include 
potentially:
••
the context of culture and the situational context in which the participants interact, 
including the place, the time and the participants themselves;
••
the textual context, or ‘co-text’, which covers the previous spoken or written dis­
course; and
••
cognitive features such as the participants’ knowledge, beliefs and assumptions, in 
so far as these are relevant at any particular point in the discourse.

THE DISTRIBUTION AND	
UNIT 29
FOCUS OF INFORMATION	
SUMMARY
1 	 In order to be understood, messages are divided into chunks called infor­
mation units, which are represented in speech by tone units. These do 
not correspond to any one grammatical category, since the speaker is free 
to break up the message as desired into units which are smaller or larger 
than a clause.
2 	 Each tone unit contains a tonic syllable, which represents the highest 
point of the focus of information. Information focus extends to the syn­
tactic unit in which the tonic occurs.
3 	 The tone unit in English signals the distribution of information into Given 
and New. Each information unit contains an obligatory New element and, 
optionally, a Given element, the unmarked order being Given–New. The 
Given is the information that the speaker presents as recoverable by the 
hearer; the New is the information that is presented as not recoverable by 
the hearer. 
4 	 The devices of ellipsis and substitution are used to avoid repeating 
information that is recoverable.
5 	 Unmarked focus falls on the last non-anaphoric lexical item of the informa­
tion unit. If the intonation nucleus is made to fall on some other item, it is 
marked and unequivocally represents New information. This is marked 
focus. Its function is to contrast one item with another or to add emotive 
colouring to the utterance. Focus can coincide with marked Theme and is 
a cohesive device in texts.
29.1 THE INFORMATION UNIT
Speakers divide their messages into chunks called information units. In the spo­
ken language these are not represented directly by any one type of grammatical 
unit, although there are certain correlations. Rather, they are signalled prosodically, 

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 2 1
by means of the intonation system of the language. Information units are therefore 
defined in terms of the spoken language and how speakers organise it. Readers of a 
written text, however, interpret what they read by mentally assigning information units 
to the text, helped by punctuation and the grammar.
The prosodic unit that represents a unit of spoken information is the tone unit. 
A tone unit consists potentially of a series of stressed and unstressed syllables, and 
always contains one syllable, the tonic, which is singled out by tonic prominence. 
That is, it carries the main pitch movement (for instance, falling, rising, falling and then 
rising, rising and then falling), a jump, up or down, in pitch and possibly extra stress 
and added duration. Its function is to mark the focus of information. Or rather, it 
signals the nucleus or highest point of the unit which is informationally in focus, as in 
the example below (the capitals represent the tonic syllable):
He’s arriving on THURSday.
This utterance would be likely to have a jump in pitch up to THURS and a pitch fall on 
‘day’. In this example, the tone unit coincides with a clause. But speakers can choose 
to make tone units longer 1 or shorter 2 than a clause, depending on how much of 
the information they want to make prominent. (The symbol // indicates the end of a 
tone unit.) Short answers, questions and commands can consist of a single prominent 
syllable, such as YES! WHY? or DON’T! If a speaker wishes to make the message highly 
informative and emphatic, each lexical word may be treated as an information unit, 
with as many tonics as there are words, as in 2 (where the tonic syllable in immediately 
is ME):
1 	 I think it’s a great pity she didn’t GET the job //
2 	 COME // HERE // IMMEDiately //
Speakers shorten or lengthen tone units in response to their communicative needs. 
This response is emotive rather than deliberate, and is therefore less likely to be con­
trolled than, for instance, the choice of a lexical item. Variation in the length of tone 
units also depends on several factors, some cultural, others personal. According to 
one cognitive view, the intonation unit or tone group represents the limited amount of 
information that our consciousness can focus on at any one time. This has led to the 
‘one chunk per clause principle’ or ‘one new idea constraint’, in conversation at least. 
For spoken English a short independent clause with few content words represents the 
typical information unit.
Other grammatical units which may correspond to tone groups include various 
kinds of adjunct, especially when initial (in the late nineteen thirties, better still, unfortu­
nately); a dependent clause (although it wasn’t your fault); a main clause with an embed­
ded clause (I thought we were leaving), coordinated predicates with the same Subject 
(he’s seen the pictures and likes them) and possibly NG Subjects (all the lonely people). The 
following are examples of utterances consisting of two tone units:
// in the late nineteen THIRties // he went to HOLLywood //
// better STILL // send an E-mail //

2 2 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
The following transcription from Crystal and Davy illustrates how one speaker organises 
an episode into tone units of varying length, with overlapping units (in brackets) 
by speaker B. The dots and dashes (. -) represent progressively longer pauses. The 
speakers have been talking about football grounds in Britain, many of them quite old.
The prosodic features indicated are as follows:

pauses, from brief to long
Capitals are used to indicate the nucleus.
Of course // the CONTINENTALS I suppose // they came in LATE // and they 
. build them – (B: PROPERLY //) you know// this MILAN ground // . there’s a 
famous one THERE . ÍSN’T there? // . (B: erm) you know// they were saying how 
SUPERB they were // . But the one in SPAIN // was the BEST // – (B: of course //) 
I thought it was in MADRID // – was it Real MADRID// they were fan (b: they’re all 
erm . . . ) oh they were FANTASTIC // it showed the PHOTOGRAPHS of them // . 
people sitting there in the hot SUN // you know // smoking CIGARS// and it showed 
the crowds . EMPTYING // – (B: they had a practice – erm) EXIT //// (B: YEAH //) 
and about . thirty seconds LATER // or a minute later they were CLEAR //
29.2 GIVEN AND NEW INFORMATION
The distribution of ‘Given’ and ‘New’ information is to a great extent the motivation for the 
information unit. Each information unit contains an obligatory ‘New’ element, which is asso­
ciated with the tonic of the tone unit, the focus of information. There can also be optional 
‘Given’ elements of information, which are associated with the rest of the tone unit. Rather 
than a clear-cut distinction between ‘Given’ and ‘New’, however, there is a gradation of given­
ness and newness. This is compatible with the notion of communicative dynamism, by which 
the message typically progresses from low to high information value (→ 29.3).
The Given element is concerned with information that the speaker presents as 
recoverable by the hearer, either from the linguistic co-text, that is, what has been 
said before, or because it can be taken as ‘known’ from the context of situation or the 
context of culture. The New element is concerned with whatever information the 
speaker presents as not recoverable by the hearer. The following exchange illustrates 
the possible relationship of Given and New to information focus:
A.	 What’s NEW then?
B.	 Well, Jim’s bought a new CAR, //, Norma’s getting a DIVORCE // and 
Jamie’s got CHICKEN-POX //, but apart from that . . . 
In each tone unit, the tonic syllable, identified here by capitals, represents the culmina­
tion of the New information. The syntactic unit in which the tonic occurs (a new CAR, a 

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 2 3
DIVORCE, CHICKEN-POX) is in each case ‘in focus’. The referents of the proper names 
Jim, Norma and Jamie are treated as identifiable and Given, or at least accessible, in the 
discourse situation (that is the function of proper names) and there is a gradation from 
Given to New, with the verbs bought, getting and got marking the transition:
Jim’s
bought
a new CAR
Norma’s
getting
a DIVORCE
Jamie’s
got
CHICKEN-POX
Given - - - - - - - - - - - - - New 
29.3  UNMARKED FOCUS AND MARKED FOCUS
In normal, unemphatic discourse, it is customary to start our message from what we 
think our hearer knows and progress to what s/he does not know. In other words, the 
unmarked distribution starts with the Given and progresses towards the New. This is 
often called the principle of end-focus.
The neutral position for information focus is therefore towards the end of the infor­
mation unit. In grammatical terms, this usually means that unmarked (end-)focus 
falls on the last non-anaphoric lexical item or name in the clause, as in the above 
exchange. Items which occur after the tonic can be taken as Given and are always 
unstressed, like about it here:
Pete’s just 	 COMPLAINED	 about it.
Given  - - - -  New - - - - - - - - Given
Here, the words after complained are both grammatical rather than lexical words: 
that is, they have a largely grammatical meaning. Pronouns such as it always refer to 
something known, unless they are contrastive and therefore marked (see below). In 
the following example, the second use of WANT is anaphoric (the notion of ‘wanting’ 
occurs in the question), and is therefore not marked. Instead, DON’T is marked:
A. Don’t you WANT it then? 	B. No, I DON’T want it.
When the focus of information is placed on the last non-anaphoric lexical item in the 
clause, almost the whole clause may be New or just one part of it. For example, Jane 
dropped the COFFEE-POT could be intended to mean that it was just the coffee-pot and 
not something else that Jane dropped; or the whole unit could contain new information. 
The amount of New material can be verified by formulating questions. In answer to 
the first, only the coffee-pot would be New and the rest Given (and probably ellipted 
in speech; → 29.3), while in answer to the second, the whole unit would represent new 
information:
What did Jane drop? 	
[Jane dropped] 	the COFFEE-POT
	
	
New - - - - - - - - - - - -
What happened? 	
Jane dropped	 the COFFEE-POT
	
- - - - - - - - - - - - New - - - - - - - - - - - - 

2 2 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Marked focus occurs when the tonic is placed on any other syllable than the tonic syllable 
of the last non-anaphoric lexical item. Marked focus is used for the purpose of contrasting 
one item with another, as in 1 and 2, or to add an emotive overlay, as in 3:
1 	 SHE didn’t make the phone call, ROBERT did.
2 	 The kids didn’t SIT on the sofa, they JUMPED on it.
3 	 I’m SO THIRSTY!
The first would be used in a context in which the speaker assumes that the hearer knows 
they are talking about someone making a phone call (‘make the phone call’ is Given 
information). As contrastive focus treats the focused element as New information, both 
she and Robert are treated as New, even though both must be identifiable in the context.
Focus can fall on other, non-lexical items such as pronouns, prepositions and aux­
iliaries, again with an implied contrast or correction. The following examples illustrate 
some of the possibilities of marked focus. When auxiliaries receive focus it is meanings 
such as those of polarity contrast (i.e. positive/ negative) or tense which are presented 
as New or important information:
MY brother sold his motorbike. 	
[not someone else’s brother]
Put the dog’s bowl UNDER the table.	
[not ON the table]
[Wait for me!] I AM waiting for you. 	
[corrects first speaker’s assumption that
  x is not waiting]
[Don’t forget to return the video!]	
[corrects the assumption that the video has
  I HAVE returned the video. 	
  not been returned.]
[Why didn’t you tell the truth?] 	
[corrects the assumption that x did not tell
  I DID tell the truth. 	
  the truth]
Whether for emotive reasons or for the purpose of emphasising or contrasting, it can 
happen that a single tone group contains more than one nucleus. The fall-plus-rise or 
the rise-plus-fall tones often accompany focusing of this kind.
//It was QUITE exciting REALLY.//
//I DO wish you’d shut UP.//
29.4  EVENT UTTERANCES
Event utterances are usually short and typically intransitive. They provide an inter­
esting exception to the principle of end-focus, in that a NG Subject receives the tonic 
stress. The reason for this is that the whole event is in Focus, and there is no pre­
supposition (assumption) such as ‘something is bleeding’, ‘something has gone out’, 
‘someone is coming’:
My NOSE is bleeding! The LIGHT’s gone out!
[I won’t be able to go away this weekend.] My PARENTS are coming.
Event sentences are extremely common in conversation. They often occur ‘out of the 
blue’, that is, unrelated to what was previously said, as surprisals or interruptions of 

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 2 5
an ongoing discourse topic. This is not always the case however. In the third example, 
the event utterance is incorporated into the dialogue as a reason for not going away 
this weekend. In languages with flexible constituent order, this type of message would 
probably be conveyed by inversion of S–P. In English, inversion is not an option here; 
instead, stress and intonation patterns are used.
29.5  ELLIPSIS
By means of ellipsis we leave out those elements of the clause that are recoverable. 
As a result we highlight the new information and our discourse gains in cohesion and 
coherence. Information can be recovered from the linguistic co-text or from the social 
context. Ellipsis of the first type is textual and of the second situational.
29.5.1  Textual ellipsis
Textual ellipsis occurs when two consecutive clauses have elements in common. The 
two clauses may form part of the same utterance by one speaker 1, or they may be 
distributed between two speakers, as in 2. The words in common are omitted in the 
second clause. In English the remaining part often ends with an auxiliary or a pronoun. 
(In the examples, ellipted material is recovered in italics.)
1 	 I’m sure he would help you, if he could (help you).
2 	 Shall we go for a walk? – Yes, let’s (go for a walk?).
3 	 Why can’t he just send a message? And for that matter, why can’t YOU? (just 
send a message)
Catenative verbs which take to-infinitive clauses such as want, mean (= intend), used to 
and like obligatorily retain the to, with the rest of the clause ellipted, as in 4. Wh- com­
plement clauses and questions can be ellipted, leaving the wh-element as in 5:
4 	 A fine mess you’ve made of things. – I didn’t mean to (make a fine mess of 
things).
5 	 Why can’t he find you a comfortable job? – He will (find me a comfortable job), 
but I don’t know when (he’ll find me a comfortable job.)
These examples illustrate final ellipsis. Medial ellipsis is featured in 6 and 7, while 8 illus­
trates initial ellipsis, where ellipsis of the pronoun is an alternative analysis to zero anaphora.
6 	 What time does this party of Robin’s start? He said [it starts at] six-to-eight.
7 	 Shirley wore jeans and Tina (wore) a miniskirt.
8 	 They got on the bus and (they) sat down in the front seat behind the driver.
29.5.2  Situational ellipsis
In conversation and writing that imitates speech, unstressed pronouns and other 
functional items are frequently ellipted, as they are recoverable from the interactional 
context.

2 2 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Can’t hear a word 	
(Subject I ellipted) 
See you soon 	
(I’ll ellipted)
Like a drink? 	
(Would you ellipted)
Any news? 	
(Is there ellipted)
You staying or leaving? (AmE)	
(Are ellipted)
Situational ellipsis is also the organising factor in ‘block language’, which includes 
newspaper headlines, telegrams and other announcements. We soon reach a point, 
however, both in textual and situational ellipsis at which the exact material ellipted is 
no longer recoverable. In such cases the concept of ellipsis is strictly not applicable. 
Instead, it is through inference that we know to what each of these notices applies:
To let.  For hire.  For sale.  Vacancies.  Bed and Breakfast.  No parking.
29.6 SUBSTITUTION
Substitution likewise avoids the repetition of recoverable information; but while ellipsis 
leaves a structural slot empty, substitution replaces it by a ‘filler’ word. Consequently, 
the exact words which have been ellipted are not recoverable. A commonly used 
clausal substitute is do so, as in 1 below. This is not acceptable, however, where the 
verb is not agentive (for instance, know, like) and in such cases ellipsis is used, as in 2.
1 	 You can hire a self-drive car, but I wouldn’t advise you to do so. (i.e. hire a self- 
drive car)
2 	 Some people like mangoes, others don’t. (*don’t do so).
So substitutes for clause complements after verbs such as say, hope, think, expect, 
be afraid, suppose and believe. Not is the negative substitute with hope, be afraid and 
suppose:
Is it going to rain tomorrow? The weather man says so (i.e. that it is going to rain). 
I hope not. (i.e. that it’s not going to rain).
So can also be used as an alternative to an auxiliary + too to substitute positively, just 
as neither alternates with auxiliary + either to substitute negatively:
This hair-dryer makes an dreadful noise. So does mine./Mine does too./Mine too.
I wouldn’t like to live in this climate. Neither/Nor would we./We wouldn’t either.
Ellipsis and substitution in nominal groups
In nominal ellipsis we replace the head element by pronouns such as these, any, each, 
all, both, either, neither, none (I’ll take these, There aren’t any left); possessives such as 
John’s, and numeratives such as the first, the next three (→ Units 46 and 47). Nominal 
substitution makes use of one/ones (I prefer the dark one(s)) this, that and the pronouns 
(an)other (→ 45.7.4).

THE INTERPLAY OF	
UNIT 30
THEME–RHEME AND GIVEN–NEW	
SUMMARY
1 	 From the point of view of communicative effect, the important positions 
in the clause are the initial position and the final position. We have 
examined separately the two structures involved, which are mapped on to 
each other: the Theme–Rheme thematic structure and the Given–New 
information structure. We now turn to the interplay between the two. We 
start by going beyond the clause to look at thematic progression in a 
paragraph.
2 	 We then turn to a few of the major resources used in English for shifting 
information either to the beginning of the clause or to the end. We have 
already seen thematisation (thematic fronting), which brings an element 
to initial position. We shall next examine the much more common device 
of clefting, which places an element to be focused near the front of the 
clause.
3 	 Equally important are the resources for shifting information towards the 
end of the clause where it receives end-focus without being marked. 
The function of the passive voice, of the existential sentence and of 
extraposition is in part just this. At the same time, a different Theme 
is selected. Speakers and writers of English make great use of all these 
devices to achieve coherence and liveliness in their speech and writing.
4 	 The highlighting of newsworthiness is not the only motivation of information 
flow. Pragmatic motivations of an interpersonal kind, such as politeness, 
may be the influencing factor in the selection and ordering of clausal 
elements, in particular the order of clauses in complex sentences.
30.1 THEMATIC PROGRESSION
The unmarked correlation between Given–New and Theme–Rheme is for Given to 
coincide with the Theme, and New information with some part of the Rheme. Going 
beyond the clause, a consistent progression from Given to New will help the reader’s 
understanding of the text. Three basic types of thematic progression are identified: 
simple linear, continuous and derived.

2 2 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
30.1.1  Simple linear progression
In this type, something introduced as new information in the Rheme of the first clause 
is taken up to be the Theme of the second. The wording need not be identical.
She has a huge team of people working for her.1 Some of them have been with her 
for years.2
In this example Theme 1 is she, while a huge team of people is the focused part of Rheme 
1. A semantic sub-set, some of them, then becomes the Theme of the second clause. We 
can present it graphically as follows:
Clause 1 	
Theme 1 + Rheme 1
Clause 2 	
	
	
Theme 2 + Rheme 2
(Based on Dane˘s 1974)
30.1.2 Continuous progression (constant Theme) 
In this type, the same Theme, Mum, is maintained across a series of coordinated 
clauses, each with its own Rheme:
Mum was always a hard worker1 and (zero) had plenty of drive2 but, in a small way, 
she was also proving to be quite a successful business woman.3
This type of progression can be diagrammed as follows. Note that the same Theme is 
maintained in the second clause by ‘zero anaphora’, which could be replaced by the 
corresponding pronoun she.
Mum (T1) was always a hard worker1 (R1) and (she)(T1) had plenty of drive(R2),2 
but, in a small way, she(T1) was also proving to be quite a successful business 
woman (R3).3
Clause 1 Theme 1 + Rheme 1
Clause 2 Theme 1 + Rheme 2
Clause 3 Theme 1 + Rheme 3
In the illustrations of these two first types of thematic progression, we find that the 
progression is made on the basis of topic referent chains. 
30.1.3 Derived Themes 
In this third type, the different themes of a number of Theme–Rheme structures all 
relate to a ‘hypertheme’ or ‘global topic’. The following text comes from Aldous 
Huxley’s The Doors of Perception, in which he describes research on the drug mescalin. 
The Hypertheme is stated in the first sentence. 

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 2 9
Mescalin research has been going on sporadically ever since the days of Lewin and 
Havelock Ellis. Chemists have not merely isolated the alkaloid; they have learned how to 
synthesize it, so that the supply no longer depends on the sparse and intermittent crop 
of a desert cactus. Alienists have dosed themselves with mescalin in the hope thereby 
of coming to a better, first-hand understanding of their patients’ mental processes. 
Working unfortunately upon too few subjects within too narrow a range of circum­
stances, psychologists have observed and catalogued some of the drug’s more striking 
effects. Neurologists and physiologists have found out something about the mechanisms 
of its action upon the central nervous system. And at least one professional philosopher 
has taken mescalin for the light it may throw on such ancient, unsolved riddles as the 
place of mind in nature and the relationship between the brain and consciousness.
The Hypertheme is mescalin research. From this, the passage develops in terms of the 
classes of researchers (the Themes, derived from the Hypertheme) and what they did 
(the Rhemes). 
Hypertheme: mescalin research
R1: chemists
T1
T2
T3
T4
T5
R2: alienists
R5: at least one
professional
philosopher
R4: neurologists
and physiologist
R3: psychologists
Figure 6.3  Themes derived from a Hypertheme. 
30. 1. 4  Split Rheme 
A fourth type of progression has a split rheme, which is a combination of types 1 and 2. 
This can be illustrated by the following item about some photographs of the Iraqi president: 
I had two particular favourites: in one he sported a green eyeshade and carried a ten­
nis racket; in the other he wore a university gown and had a mortar-board on his head.
Clause 1 I had two particular favourites
Clauses 2–3 In one he sported a green eyeshade and carried a tennis racket
Clauses 4–5 In the other he wore a university gown and had a mortar-board on 
his head.

2 3 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
This can be expressed graphically. 
Clause 1 	
T1 – R1. The Rheme implies two items, A and B:
Clauses 2–3 	
In one (A) –––––––––––––––––––––––(T2___________R2) 
Clauses 4–5 	
In the other (B) –––––––––––––––––– (T2” ––––––––––– R2”) 
30.2  CLEFTING: IT-CLEFTS AND WH-CLEFTS 
In clefting, we re-organise the content of a single clause into two related parts. The 
effect of the resulting structures is to focus on one element, the New, which always fol­
lows a form of the verb be. There are two kinds of cleft: the it-cleft and the wh-cleft. 
Here is an example of each. Compare these with the plain version: They need money.
It’s MONEY (that) they need 	(it-cleft)
What they need is MONEY	
(wh-cleft) 
Both types of cleft have MONEY in strong focus; the it-cleft brings the focus (marked 
by tonic stress) near the front of the first unit; the wh-cleft has the focus at the end of 
the second unit. There is a lesser stress, here underlined, on need, the last word of the 
unit containing Given or presupposed information. Presupposed information is that 
which is assumed by the speaker, without being asserted. Here what is assumed is 
‘they need something’.
If spoken, then, the devices of intonational prominence and syntactic structure rein­
force each other to single out money in these examples. Let’s look first at the it-cleft. 
This consists of the pronoun it, + a form of the verb be, + the strongly focused item + 
a clause starting with a relative pronoun such as who, that or which: 
It was last TUESDAY that I met Richard (compare: I met Richard last TUESDAY) 
It was the WOMEN that did the bartering. It was the WOMEN that actually got 
enough to feed the family. [F71] Who must register for VAT? It’s the PERSON, not 
the BUSINESS, who is registered for VAT. [FAU] 
In such examples, it is a dummy element with no other function but to provide a 
subject for the verb be. The item in focus can be a noun group, a prepositional group, 
a pronoun or a clause.
30.2.1 Discourse functions of the it-cleft 
The main function of the it-cleft is to mark contrastive focus. The contrast is very 
often implicit, as in Tuesday (not another day), the women, not the men; but the contrast 
may be made explicit, as in It’s the person, not the business, who is registered for VAT.
A different, non-contrastive use, is illustrated in the following sentence from 
Huxley’s work:
1 	 It was in 1886 that the German pharmacologist, Louis Lewin, published the 
first systematic study of the cactus, to which his own name was subsequently 
given.

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 3 1
The function here is not to contrast 1886 with a different date. Rather, the function of 
such clefts, which often highlight expressions of time or place, is to signal the beginning 
of an episode in discourse. It may be the very beginning of the text, as in 1, or an oral 
announcement, 2; otherwise, the cleft may signal a shift to a new episode 3:
2 	 It is with great pleasure that I announce the name of this year’s winner . . . 
3 	 It was only years later that I realised what he meant.
30.2.2  Discourse functions of the wh-cleft 
1 	 What we want is WATney’s. 
This was a famous advertising slogan, at one time, for Watney’s beer. It is clearly much 
more emphatic than the plain version 2 and even more than the it-cleft 3.
2 	 We want WATney’s.
3 	 It’s Watney’s (that) we want. 
In both types of cleft there is presupposed information: in this case, that we want 
something. But while the it-cleft 3 suggests contrast (Watney’s, not other beers), the 
wh-cleft 1 suggests exclusiveness. (It’s ONLY Watney’s we want, and no other). The 
wh-cleft consists of a wh-word, of which by far the most common is what, followed by 
a clause containing Given or presupposed information, then a form of be, followed by 
the New information: 
//What we want// (it is presupposed: that we want something) is	
Watney’s//Given 	
New 
This structure is also sometimes called a thematic equative, since it is of the form 
‘X = Y’.
30.2.3  Variants of the wh-cleft 
The one(s) who/that acts as replacement for the now ungrammatical who-cleft:
The one who told me the news was Lizzy herself. (*Who told me the news was Lizzy 
herself) 
All (that) is used instead of *all what. ‘That’ is usually omitted.
All you need is love.
Reversed wh-clefts have the main focus at the beginning of the first unit, not at the 
end after be, as in regular wh-clefts. Some combinations (that’s what/why/how/the way) 
are stereotyped, as are the thing is/the problem is, which can also be included here:
All you need is LOVE. (regular wh-cleft) 
LOVE is all you need. (reversed wh- cleft)

2 3 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
What you should do is THIS. (regular wh-cleft)
THIS is what you should do. (reversed wh-cleft)
That’s what I told you.
That’s why we came.
The effect is to put the new information as end-focus, but to indicate its selectively New 
status very clearly. The exclusiveness inherent in an element focused in this way allows 
the wh-cleft to be used for two important discourse purposes: (a) to introduce a new topic 
(in the New part), as in 1; and (b) to correct a previous statement or assumption, as in 2.
1 	 What I don’t understand is why they don’t have a secretary in that place.
2 	 What he did was take the money and run. 
The Wh-cleft identifies a particular element exclusively. In this it differs from the basic 
clause structure and from the ordinary cleft. Compare:
We all need a holiday. 	
(neutral: no doubt we need other things too) 
It’s a holiday we all need. 	
(implied contrast with something else)
What we all need is a holiday. 	 (the only thing focused on) 
Wh-clefts are always reversible, and this property distinguishes them from wh- 
embedded clauses which are not clefts. Compare the following: 
What he said was that he didn’t like the play. (wh-cleft)
What he said was very interesting. (nominal relative clause) 
The first is a wh-cleft, corresponding to the plain version He said that he didn’t like the play. 
The next is NOT a wh-cleft. There is no equivalent to the form *He said very interesting. 
Another way to test this is to try for reversibility. The first is reversible, the second is not:
That he didn’t like the play was what he said.
*Very interesting was what he said.
Certain stereotyped wh-clefts (which are not all reversible) such as What happened 
was . . . , What I mean is . . . and The thing is . . . are also used for a variety of 
purposes such as pre-signals to certain speech acts, such as giving an excuse or an 
explanation:
What happened was that I missed the last train.
The thing is, we have tickets for a concert that evening.
What I mean is we should all try to convince him. 
30.3  THE ACTIVE–PASSIVE ALTERNATIVE 
In describing situations which involve two participants, it is usually possible to take one 
or other participant as Subject and Theme/Topic. This is done in English by means of 
the active–passive voice alternative:

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 3 3
The President has released the prisoners. (active voice)
The prisoners have been released [by the President]. (passive voice) 
In the active construction, the Agent is mapped on to Subject and Theme/Topic, while 
the Affected is in final position and receives normal, unmarked end-focus:
The President
has released
the prisoners.
Agent
Affected
Subject
Direct Object
Theme/Topic
__________________ Rheme __________________
Unmarked end-focus
In the passive construction these correspondences are reversed. The Affected is now 
promoted to Subject and provides the point of departure, while the Agent is demoted 
from its privileged position as Subject and is usually omitted. If present, it occupies 
final position and receives normal end-focus:
The prisoners
have been released
[by the President] 
Affected
Agent
Subject
Adjunct
Theme/Topic
__________________
Rheme __________________
[optional end-focused element]
We can see that the active–passive alternative allows speakers and writers to 
exploit the two main positions in the clause, the beginning and the end. In each 
case, a single clause can be arranged so that important new information is placed 
in end-position, while already known information is placed at the beginning. What 
is new and important and what is known is of course estimated by the speaker, and 
is dependent on the context and the estimated state of knowledge of the hearer at 
that point in the discourse.
30.3.1  Promoting one participant, demoting another 
From the point of view of the textual organisation of what the speaker wants to say, 
it follows that any of three possibilities may condition the choice between active and 
passive:
1	
An element which is not Agent is desired as Theme/Subject/Topic.
2	
The Agent is New information, so will be placed last.
3	
The Agent is not New and is silenced. Some other element is New and is placed last.
It is not simply a change of position that is involved in the re-structuring of the pas­
sive clause. It is also a question of topic promotion and demotion. In the active clause, 
the Agent–Subject has the discourse role of Topic. That is, it is the most important 

2 3 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
participant of the discourse at the point when the clause is produced. In the pas­
sive clause, the Agent ceases to be Subject/ Topic. Another participant (usually the 
Affected) takes on the roles of both Subject and Topic. The Recipient (→ 6.2.1) can 
also become Subject in a passive clause, as in The boy was given a mountain bike for his 
birthday.
The demotion of one participant and the promotion of another are two sides of the 
same coin. If we demote the Agent (or Experiencer, or Sayer), then a different partici- 
pant (Affected, Recipient) is automatically promoted to Subject. It is clear, therefore, 
that, first, the passive is not a type of fronting or thematisation; second, it does not pro­
duce a marked Theme, but a different unmarked Theme; and third, the type of Theme 
involved is a participant Theme, which in this book we call Topic. Circumstantial 
Themes and textual Themes are optional additions to the core clause and play no part 
in restructuring the clause as passive.
We now turn to the discourse motivations that involve the choice of passive. 
Basically, these are: to cut out unnecessary Given information; to manoeuvre impor­
tant information into end position; to establish smooth connections between clauses, 
making for good information flow. These motivations work together in connected dis­
course. Choices of passive against active are not open, but are conditioned in each 
individual case by the immediate contextual environment.
30.3.2  Choosing to be informative
Using the passive gives us the choice of not stating who carried out the action. 
This is an important factor, because in the active clause this information can’t be 
omitted. What conditions our choice, then, between a passive without an agent and 
one in which we keep the Agent in a by-phrase at the end? The answer is: informa­
tiveness. If the Agent is new important information, keep it. If not, omit it. In this 
extract from Stephen Hawking writing about black holes, there is an example of 
each type: 
Although the concept of what we call a black hole goes back more than two hundred 
years, the name black hole was introduced only in 1967 by the American physicist 
John Wheeler. It was a stroke of genius: the name ensured that black holes entered the 
mythology of science fiction. It also stimulated scientific research by providing a definite 
name for something that previously had not had a satisfactory title. The importance in 
science of a good name should not be underestimated.
In this passage, Hawking gives credit to the originator of the term black hole, with the 
full name of the physicist encoded as an Agent by-phrase. The second passive has no 
Agent because it is generic and implied (by anyone working in science).
An additional motivation for the use of a passive with an Agent by-phrase occurs 
when the Agent is long. By putting it at the end we follow the principle of end-weight 
(‘shortest first, longest last’) as in the following examples, in which the Agent is ‘weight­
ier’ than the passive Subject: 

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 3 5
The front seats were filled by members of the families of the victims.
The goal was scored by Messi, the player with most goals to his credit this 
season.
It is clear that end-focus, end-weight and informativeness are closely linked. New 
participants introduced onto the scene of discourse need to be described and defined 
in more detail than known ones. They are, consequently ‘heavy’ and are better placed 
at the end, whereas the subject in a passive clause tends to be ‘light’ (the front seats, the 
goal), pronouns being the lightest.
Instead of an Agent, an event or a force of nature may occur in final position, as in 
the examples below, while Scotland’s railway network and the house will be considered 
important enough to become subject: 
Scotland’s railway network has been paralysed by the one-day strike. 
The house was struck by lightning.
30.3.3 Passives without an Agent 
We have seen that uninformative Agents are silenced in discourse. More exactly, this 
may happen because the Agent is implied by the nature of the verb, but is unknown 
because 1; anaphorically predictable 2; predictable by general knowledge 3; univer­
sal or general 4; irrelevant at this point in the discourse 5; deliberately silenced in 
order to avoid giving or taking blame or responsibility 6 or to maintain privacy 7; 
finally, recoverable as the author of the text. Authorial ‘I’ is preferably not mentioned 
in formal writing 8:
1	
My car has been stolen.
2	
When he won his gold medal he gave a huge party. Everyone was invited. [by 
him]
3	
The heart transplant was carried out successfully. [by one or more 
surgeons]
4	
It is hoped that war can be avoided. [Everyone has this hope]
5	
Ten thousand soldiers will be needed to operate the emergency service.
6	
The documents have been shredded and the fax hasn’t been sent.
7	
It was given to me as a present. [speaker doesn’t want to reveal the 
sender.]
8	
This point will be dealt with in a later chapter.
When the Agent by-phrase is omitted in a passive clause, some other element 
necessarily receives end-focus. This may be a verb 9, an Adjunct 10, or a Complement 
11. For a verb to be focused, it must contain the main New information and the Agent 
must be dispensable.
  9	 Is this seat taken?
10	 Nothing has been heard of him for months.
11	 The letters had been sent unstamped.

30.3.4  Making smooth transitions 
Look at the following examples. Version A is based on a real occurrence: 
A.	 Ann:	
Where did you get that wallet?
	
Joe: 	
It was given to me by 	
my GIRL-friend.
	
	
Given . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . New 
In this exchange that wallet is introduced at the end of the first clause and is picked up 
as subject pronoun in the second. Here we have again the simple linear Theme–Rheme 
pattern, but in this case it is the choice of the passive that enables the speaker to main­
tain topic continuity, as well as unmarked end-focus. Now look at version B:
B.	 Ann:	
Where did you get that wallet?
	
Joe: 	
My GIRL-friend	 gave it to me.
	
	
New . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Given
In this version, instead of initiating a topic chain headed by that wallet, a new partici­
pant (my GIRL-friend) is introduced, as subject, necessarily with heavy stress (marked 
focus). This compensates for the lack of topic continuity, since in English, stress pat­
terns override the usual Given–New pattern, producing instead a New–Given pattern.
It is not necessarily the passive which serves to maintain topic continuity, however. 
Compare the versions b and c in each of the following sets of clauses. In each case c 
rather than b preserves the continuity better with a, whether by means of the passive
(1 and 2) or the active (3). Moreover, 2b violates the ‘animacy’ and ‘empathy’ hierar­
chies, which give priority to human referents. All are grammatically acceptable, however.
1a The Prime Minister stepped off the plane.
1b Journalists immediately surrounded her.
1c She was immediately surrounded by journalists.
2a The Prime Minister stepped off the plane.
2b The wind immediately buffeted her.
2c She was immediately buffeted by the wind.
3a The Prime Minister stepped off the plane.
3b All the journalists were immediately greeted by her.
3c She immediately greeted all the journalists.
30.3.5 The get-passive 
The get-passive is used much more in speech than in writing and has an informal fla­
vour, the reverse of the be-passive. Here are some examples from conversation: 
Poor fellow, he got knocked down in a road accident.
She got bitten by a new bug of some sort in France.
I got attacked by a fan at a football match.
He got promoted, the lucky devil!

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 3 7
The get-passive grammaticalises affective meaning, and so potentially reflects speakers’ 
involvement, whereas the be-passive is more objective. The use of the get-passive is 
therefore an option. Speakers’ interest centres on the get-passive subject and what 
happens to it, while with the be-passive interest centres on the event. Involvement 
of the subject referent is also implied by the get-passive, in that the subject is partly 
responsible for the significant result, whether this is beneficial or adverse. The 
be-passive, by contrast, is neutral. Compare:
a	 She got (herself) promoted.	
b	 She was promoted.
a	 I got stung by a wasp. 	
b	 I was stung by a wasp.
The action undergone by the subject of the get-passive is more often adverse than 
beneficial. In fact, all the adverse and violent things that can happen to a person or 
thing are expressible by the get-passive: get arrested, abused, fined, fired, beaten up, 
burgled, kidnapped, killed, mugged, raped, sacked, shot, vandalised and many more. The 
subject referent is either unlucky or has made an error of judgement (being at the wrong 
place at the wrong time) when bad events are described. On happier occasions, such as 
getting invited or promoted, there is often an implication that the subject referent has 
contrived to be promoted, invited and so on, or was lucky, being at the right place at 
the right time. Here is another extract from Hawking’s Black Holes and Baby Universes, 
with an example of each type of passive. He is discussing the idea that:
if one could pass through a black hole, one might re-emerge anywhere in the universe. 
Quite how to choose your destination is not clear: you might set out for a holiday in 
Virgo and end up in the Crab Nebula.
I’m sorry to disappoint prospective galactic tourists, but this scenario doesn’t work: 
if you jump into a black hole, you will get torn apart and crushed out of existence. 
However, there is a sense in which the particles that make up your body will carry on 
into another universe. I don’t know if it would be much consolation to someone being 
made into spaghetti in a black hole to know that his particles might survive.
30.4  THE PRESENTATIVE FUNCTION OF EXISTENTIAL CLAUSES
There are several reasons for thinking that existential there has acquired a new role:
••
We saw in 25.3 the structure of the existential clause (unstressed there + a form 
of be + a NG), as in There was a fight. The semantic role of Existent is associated 
with the NG, which occupies the position after the verb and is, experientially, the 
notional subject.
••
Unstressed there, however, fulfils most of the syntactic requirements for subject, as 
seen in 5.1.2.D2, including its use in the tag: There’s a café just round the corner, 
isn’t there?
••
Plural concord is not always maintained in spoken English, as for example: There’s
••
some chocolate chip cookies out there if you want some.
••
Existential there can occur with the stressed adverb of place there in the same 
clause, as in There’s plenty more over there. 

2 3 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
These facts support the view that existential there (and especially there’s) has lost its 
original locative meaning and is on the way to becoming a kind of introductory par­
ticle. An alternative view is that its locative and deictic meaning is not entirely lost: 
rather, there points to the upcoming noun.
Unstressed there is a presentative device in discourse. There points to the New infor­
mation conveyed by the noun group placed at the end of the clause, where it carries 
end-weight and end-focus. In the basic types, the reverse order is not allowed, as we 
can see in the examples below. In these, a verb of very low communicative dyna- 
mism, be, placed in final position and preceded by an indefinite subject, violates the 
Given–New progression. The result is an ungrammatical clause in most cases. The 
corresponding existential clauses in 1–4 here are therefore basic existentials: they 
have no corresponding plain clause. 
1 *Hundreds of millions of stars are.
There are hundreds of millions of stars.
2 *Plenty of time is.
There is plenty of time.
3 *A storm was last night.
There was a storm last night.
4 *Seven of us are in the family.
There are seven of us in the family.
5 A man is at the door.
There’s a man at the door.
30.4.1  Derived existential
These are existentials that have a corresponding plain clause, based on a ‘weight­
ier’ verb than be. In the following examples, the verb of the plain clause (bark, hijack) 
appears in the post-modifier position of the existential NG:
Existential clause	
Plain clause 
There’s a dog barking outside. 	
A dog is barking outside.
There was another plane hijacked 	
Another plane was hijacked yesterday.
  yesterday.
Semantically, the location and/or the quantification of the NG referent are important 
(→ 25.3) because such features may well be the most informative part of the utterance. 
When we say, for instance, there’s no milk, it is not the non-existence of milk that we are 
predicating, but rather the fact that there is no quantity of milk available at the moment 
of speaking. The spatial location is implicit. ‘Existence’, then, has to be understood in 
a very broad sense.
30.4.2  Short existentials 
Short existentials, many containing a negative word specifying no quantity or number 
such as no, none, nobody/ no-one and nothing, are common in everyday English, as in 
the following examples:
1 	 There’s no problem.
2 	 There’s no point staying on then, is there?
3 	 There’s nothing wrong, nothing at all.

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 3 9
4 	 There’s nothing on television.
5 	 There’s no-one around today.
6 	 There’s none left. 
One of the functions of negation is to deny something previously said or implied, and 
this may be the motivation for some utterances in context (3 and 6, for instance). But 
speech acts such as reassurance (1 and 3) may be the motive for the denial. Positive 
declarative existentials may provide factual information (8) or, when they refer to the 
future, may be interpreted as predictions (7) or assurances (9):
7 	 I think this is a long-term battle. There will be battles. (George W. Bush, remarks 
to the employees of the Pentagon, 17 September 2001)
8 	 There have been heavy snowfalls in the north.
9 	 There is bound to be another opportunity.
30.4.3 Extended existentials 
These occur as the result of expansions of the noun group (→ 25.3). Common expan- 
sions include -ing clauses, which present an entity in action 1 or in a state 2. Certain 
postposed adjectives can express a temporary state 3, 4. Passives and compara­
tives are also common, especially with the constructions there’s nothing better/worse 
than . . . in 5 and 6 respectively:
1 	 There are hundreds of people clamouring for food.
2 	 There is a box containing dynamite in the corner.
3 	 There was plenty of food available.
4 	 There are not many shops open at this hour.
5 	 There were several civilians killed in a terrorist attack yesterday.
6 	 There’s nothing worse than being stuck in a traffic jam when you’re late for an 
appointment. (comparative clause) 
The function of these expansions is to establish the relevance and coherence of the 
new referent at the point when it is introduced into the discourse.
In formal English and in fiction, verbs of appearing and emerging lend themselves 
naturally to the presentation of New information (→25.3) as in Fossil records suggest that 
there emerged a fern resistant to this disease. However, existence or appearance should not 
always be taken in a literal sense, but rather in relation to the discourse: it is appearance 
on the scene of discourse, or cognitive awareness, that counts. Because of this, even a 
verb like disappear may, in an appropriate context, function as a presentative, as in the 
first sentence of the novel by H.P. Lovecraft, The Strange Case of Charles Dexter Ward:
From an asylum for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island, there recently disap­
peared an exceedingly singular person.
From this it becomes clear that the notions ‘bringing something into cognitive 
awareness’ or ‘onto the scene of discourse’ are the key to the discourse function of 

2 4 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
there- structures. In this sense we can also apply the traditional term ‘existential’: once 
introduced, the new referent is ‘present’ in the discourse, and can be taken up and 
developed as a topic.
30.4.4  There-structures as states of affairs 
A there-structure is commonly used in English to express events, happenings and states 
of affairs in a schematic way, without the intervention of participants. Frequently, the 
noun is a nominalisation of a verbal process (→ 27.2):
1 	 There was a fight.
2 	 There was an abrupt knock at the door.
3	
There has been unprecedented industrial expansion.
4	
There was a sudden feeling of panic.
5	
There is still bribery, there is still corruption. No doubt there always will be.
There-constructions with nominalisations have the effect of silencing the Agent of the 
action. We don’t know who knocked at the door, who panicked, who bribes whom, 
who fought whom. The occurrence is the only important part of the message.
While the NG is typically indefinite, even definite NGs – which represent referents 
that are already accessible – can be introduced by a there-construction. 
This is how a woman described her new portable sauna bath, introducing each part 
by means of a there-construction:
There’s an oval mat you put down on the floor,1 then there’s the box which holds 
the heating element,2 with a wooden seat on it – I put a towel on top, otherwise it 
gets too hot – then there are the sides which are soft and which you zip up.3 It all 
packs away neatly afterwards.
1indefinite NG; 2definite NG; 3definite NG
30.5  EXTRAPOSITION OF CLAUSES 
We have seen that certain types of long subject clauses are usually avoided in English 
because they violate the end-weight principle, and sound awkward (→5.1.2C). Finite 
that-clauses, wh-nominal clauses and to-infinitive clauses can all be shifted to 
the end of the sentence and replaced by ‘anticipatory it’ in subject position. The result­
ing structure is called extraposition.
Clause as Subject	
Extraposed clause 
That the banks are closed on	
It’s a nuisance that the banks are closed on
  Saturday is a nuisance. 	
  Saturday.
What they are proposing to do is	
It’s horrifying what they are proposing
  horrifying.	
  to do.
To interfere would be unwise.	
It would be unwise to interfere.
Extraposed clauses are much preferred in spoken English to the non-extraposed, as 
they sound much less awkward. The reason for this is that they satisfy the principles of 

O R G A N I S I N G  T H E  M E S S A G E  
2 4 1
end-weight and end-focus, thus ‘packaging’ the information in a way that is easier to 
process. A non-extraposed that-clause, if not too long, may be preferred, however, as 
in ‘That we’ve gotten to this point is astonishing’ (AmE).
Extraposition is often used to express an opinion or to argue one’s case. An evalua­
tive word, such as a nuisance, horrifying, unwise comes in the middle, carrying a certain 
amount of stress. The main focus falls at the end of the sentence, reversing the distribu­
tion of information in the non-extraposed clause.
Normal -ing clauses as subject are not perceived to be awkward, and there is less 
motivation to extrapose them. When they are extraposed, they are usually short and 
do not necessarily carry the main focus. For this reason they give the impression of 
being additions to the main clause, rather than extraposed subjects:
Having you with us has been 	
It’s been a PLEASURE, having you
  a PLEASURE.	
  with us.
Seeing all the family again was NICE.	
It was NICE seeing all the family again.
In formal language, English does not normally allow extraposed NGs as in *It was 
amazing his insolence– though, as a right dislocation (→ 28.11) with appropriate 
intonation, it is possible to have It was amazing, his insolence, where a pause or 
a comma signals the dislocated NG. In spontaneous speech extraposed NGs do 
occur: 
It’s been amazing the support we’ve had. 
It’s unbelievable the lengths some people are prepared to go to. 
Obligatory extraposition after seem, appear, happen, look as if – after the expressions 
it’s high time, it’s a pity, it’s no use, and the passive of say, hope and intend – is illustrated 
in 5.1.2.
N.B. Certain constructions do not admit extraposition. One of these is the wh-cleft 
with a clause as subject, as in What we should do next is the main problem. (*It is the 
main problem what we should do next.) Another case is multiple embedding, as in That 
he failed his driving test the seventh time demonstrates that he lacks confidence. Here the 
first that-clause cannot be extraposed over the second (*It demonstrates that he lacks 
confidence that he failed his driving test for the seventh time).
30.5.1  Raised elements as new Themes 
A person or thing mentioned in the extraposed clause, as direct object or even as part 
of the adjunct, can sometimes be brought forward (‘raised’) to stand as Theme. The 
result is a new subject Theme which is a person or thing (→ 37.4):
To cook rice is easy – It is easy to cook rice – Rice is easy to cook.
To live with Bill is difficult – It is difficult to live with Bill – Bill is difficult to live with.
Only certain adjectives and nouns permit the final raising stage. They express an 
evaluative attitude to the situation, most commonly regarding the ease or difficulty 
involved. Interestingly, the new Subject/Theme appears to be made responsible for 
the situation.

30.6  POSTPONEMENT 
Units can be made discontinuous when we want to avoid the awkwardness of having 
long, heavy units to the left of the main verb, especially when this is ‘light’. Postmodifiers 
in NGs 1, appositive reflexive pronouns 2 and clauses of comparison 3 can all occur:
1 	 [?The time when no-one will write by hand any more will come]
	
	
The time will come when no-one will write by hand any more.
2 	 [You yourself did it] You did it yourself.
3 	 [?More people than used to twenty years ago are buying a second car]
	
	
More people are buying a second car than used to twenty years ago.
30.6.1  Postponement with ditransitive verbs 
We saw in 10.4 that certain ditransitive verbs – such as give, deny, grant, lend, owe, 
show among others – allow two alternative structures:
We’ve given the children bicycles. (SPOiOd) 
We’ve given bicycles to the children. (SPOdPC)
This alternative allows us to place end-focus either on the Recipient (the children) or 
on the other participant, without using the passive. This way of adjusting the clause, to 
get the end-focus where we want it, is especially useful when one of the participants is 
Given information, often realised by a pronoun; this will normally be placed in medial 
position:
We’ve given them bicycles.
We’ve given them to the children. 
N.B. With certain verbs such as deliver which take a Goal Complement only the 
prepositional version is valid: 
They’ll deliver the pizza to your house (→ 10.4.2.) .

CLAUSE COMBINING	
UNIT 31 
The complex sentence
SUMMARY
Grammatically, the sentence is the highest unit. Traditionally, sentences are 
said to be simple, compound or complex. A simple sentence consists of 
one independent clause; a compound sentence of two independent clauses 
in a relationship of coordination. A complex sentence consists minimally of 
one independent and one or more dependent clauses in a relationship of 
dependency. 
1	
In everyday uses of English, clause combinations can be more complex. 
Coordination and dependency typically interrelate in various combinations 
which we refer to as complex sentences or clause complexes. There is no 
grammatical limit to the number of coordinated or subordinated clauses 
that can combine to form a complex unit.
2	
In conversation and certain types of written English such as public notices, 
headlines and plays, units of a lower rank than clause such as words 
and groups can be treated as independent rhetorical units. It is useful to 
distinguish between clausal and non-clausal material when analysing such 
sources. 
31.1  Independent and dependent clauses 
In the preceding chapters we have seen how a clause can be embedded within another 
clause, as a realisation of subject, object or complement in the superordinate clause 
(→ Chapter 2). As such, these clauses occupy well-defined positions and are tightly 
bound to the host clause. An embedded clausal complement is also bound by stringent 
grammatical constraints determined by the verb. 
We now turn to how clauses can be combined to form complex sentences or clause 
complexes. The inter-clause relationships involved are of a looser kind than that of 
embedding. Clauses are either independent or dependent (→ 2.4.1B). An independent 
clause is complete in itself; it does not form part of a larger structure. It can function as 
the main clause in a complex sentence. 

2 5 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
 The independent clause is considered primary in that it comprises minimal 
completeness and unity. 
A dependent clause is syntactically dependent on a main clause or on another 
dependent clause. It cannot function as a main clause, even when finite. 
31.2  The complex sentence 
The highest grammatical unit is traditionally called the sentence. Three possible types 
are usually distinguished: 
••
The simple sentence consists minimally of one independent clause, as in Sam 
bought the tickets. 
••
The compound sentence consists basically of two independent clauses, linked in 
a relationship of coordination, as in Sam bought the tickets and Sue parked the car.
••
The complex sentence consists minimally of one independent clause and one 
dependent clause, linked in a relationship of dependency, as in Sam bought the 
tickets while Sue parked the car. 
In connected discourse, however, the combinations may be more complex and varia­
ble than this simple outline suggests. Coordination and subordination of clauses do not 
occur unrelatedly, each in combination with a main clause. More often they interrelate. 
Numerous combinations are possible. Here are two examples. In these examples the 
+ sign indicates coordination, the x sign subordination. Example 1, based on a news 
item, has one main clause with two dependent clauses successively subordinated as 
adjuncts: 
1 A boy of six saved the lives of his brother and two sisters yesterday (1) when fire 
broke out (2) while they were at home alone (3).
[AHX] 
The three clauses are organised in a hierarchical relationship. The independent 
clause encodes the main content – A boy saved the lives of his brother and two sisters 
yesterday. The two subordinate clauses encode the circumstances of time and place. 
The first functions as adjunct in the main clause, the second as adjunct in the previous 
subordinate clause. This is a case of double, or ‘layered’ subordination:
A boy saved the lives of his brother and two sisters yesterday)
× 
[when fire broke out 
	
Adjunct
 
 
×	
[while they were at home alone]]
	
	
	
Adjunct 
Example 2 warns of the dangers of walking on hills: 
2 (However,) hillwalking is largely safe (1) but there are risks (2) and we have to 
educate people about these risks (3) if we are going to improve safety (4). 

C O M B I N I N G  C L A U S E S  
2 5 1
Leaving aside the connective adjunct however, two coordinated clauses (1 and 2) are 
followed by a unit consisting of a third coordinated clause (3) in which a conditional 
clause is subordinated as adjunct. 
(hillwalking is largely safe) + (but there are risks) + (and we have to educate people 
about these risks) × (if we are going to improve safety)
	
Adjunct 
Adopting a broader application of the term, we will say that a complex sentence can 
consist of any number of clauses of different types and in different combinations. 
31.2.1  The sentence as an orthographic and rhetorical unit 
The structural criteria outlined in the preceding section are not the only criteria that 
have intervened in the traditional and widely accepted concept (or ‘concepts’) of 
‘sentence’. For most native speakers of English, a sentence starts with a capital letter 
and ends with a full stop (AmE ‘period’), a question mark or an exclamation mark. It 
is, then, a category associated primarily with the written language and as such can be 
described as an orthographic and rhetorical unit.
31.2.2  Clausal and non-clausal material 
We have already seen in Chapter 5 how units of a lower rank than an independent 
clause such as nominal and adjectival groups, as well as incomplete clauses, appear in 
plays, stories and advertisements between a capital letter and a full stop, functioning 
independently as responses in dialogues. Such is the case with the italicised expressions 
in the following examples: 
The large size is unavailable. 	
Which is a pity. 
	
(freestanding subordinate clause) 
A: We’ve got the deal 	
B. Fantastic!
	
(adjective-headed exclamation)
You deaf or what?	
(verbless clause)
A. Have you seen the satellites, 	
B. Oh those, no, no
erm, you know, our satellite places?	
(non-clausal)
[KBB] 
The following small text uses full stops and a dash to reflect tone units, which, as seen 
in Chapter 6, need not always coincide with clauses or sentences. Here, lines 2, 3 and 
4 could be combined to form one grammatical sentence. As it stands, punctuation is 
used to reinforce the presentation of each unit as if it were independent, as would be 
done equally clearly if the text were read aloud.
With Fax the possibilities are endless. 
It can send a document anywhere in the States within minutes.
Including drawings, diagrams – even musical notes. 
Exactly as it’s written.
Fax. Worth making a song and dance about.

2 5 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
To summarise, if we take the complex sentence as the highest grammatical unit, 
we can say that structurally, a sentence is composed of clauses. However, both in 
conversation and in written texts that simulate the spoken mode, as well as in news 
headlines, slogans, banners and public notices such as Vacancies or For Hire, we can find 
units that are non-clausal among others that are clausal. In written texts orthographic 
units may be single words or what are known as text fragments, such as Ashamed of 
your mobile? Non-clausal material has two defining features: internally, it cannot be 
analysed in terms of clause structure; nor can it be analysed as part of an adjacent 
clause. 

RELATIONSHIPS OF EQUIVALENCE	
UNIT 32 
BETWEEN CLAUSES 	
SUMMARY 
Clauses are related syntactically in one of two ways: they are either equivalent 
in status or non-equivalent. 
•
•
Coordination is the syntactic relationship between units of equal status 
that conjoin to form a larger unit. Each of the units is called a coordinate 
They are linked by the coordinators and, or and but.
•
•
Correlative coordination of alternation is carried out by either . . . or 
and negatively, by neither . . . nor. Not only . . . but also has an additive 
meaning. 
It is not only clauses that can be coordinated. Various classes of grammatical 
elements can likewise be coordinated (→ 3.7.1) and seen in authentic illustra­
tions. Lower level coordination deals with units below the clause.
Cohesive connectives such as besides, actually, serve to clarify the 
relationships between coordinated clauses.
Intermediate coordination consists of a coordinator + another item such as 
and then, and so, and yet. The result is intermediate between coordination and 
subordination. 
32.1  COORDINATION AND ITS VARIANTS
Clauses are related to each other basically in one of two ways; either the relationship 
is one of equivalence, both or all the clauses having the same syntactic status, or the 
relationship is one of non-equivalence, the clauses having a different status, one clause 
being dependent on another. Coordination displays relationships of equivalence, while 
dependency is based on non-equivalence. 

2 5 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
32.1.1  Coordination and coordinators and, or, but
Two or more units can combine to form a larger unit. Each of the units is called a 
coordinate. Clauses can be conjoined when they share related meanings and fulfil the 
same function. Coordinates are typically syntactically similar. Semantically also, the 
contents of the two clauses have to be seen as relevant to each other in some way: 
I don’t like it and I don’t want it.
You can keep it or you can give it away. 
It’s a fine piece of furniture, but (it is) too large for this room.
The linking relationship is made explicit by the coordinating conjunctions (‘coordinators’ 
for short), and, or and but. 
32.1.2  Listing 
In listing a series of elements, the explicit links may be omitted, although the coordinator 
is typically retained between the last two items, as in 1. Moreover, the repetition of a 
coordinate adds extra emphasis to the relation expressed, as in 2:
1	
We have bought bread, ham, cheese, fruit and beer for the picnic. 
2	
They would walk and talk and bathe and read and joke.
32.1.3  Correlative coordination 
Meanings can be reinforced by using correlative coordinates. Else (or else) and the 
correlative coordinators either . . . or make explicit the meaning of alternation (either 
we stay or (else) we leave now), which excludes one alternative, while the negative 
correlates neither  . . . nor exclude both (He likes neither tea nor coffee). 
You should either accept his offer or (else) never see him again.
Either we give the tickets back or (else) we drop everything and go.
You should neither ask him for money nor accept it if he offers. 
With an additive meaning, the correlates not only  . . . .but also function in a similar way: 
Mary not only runs a kindergarten but also writes books on childcare
If not only is placed in clause initial position, subject-verb inversion is obligatory, in this 
case involving the use of a form of do:
Not only does Mary run a kindergarten but she also writes books on childcare.1
The same applies to neither and nor in clause-initial position, following a previous 
negative statement (→ 29.6). 
I was not satisfied with the result and neither /nor were they. 

C O M B I N I N G  C L A U S E S  
2 5 5
32.1.4  Clarifying connectives
Unlike coordinators, which have fixed positions at the clause boundary, cohesive 
connectives, such as instead or actually, are more moveable. They can be used to 
reinforce the additive, contrastive or replacive meanings of the coordinators.
He doesn’t like bacon and also, he’s better without it. (additive) 
I have no intention of going, nor in fact did I ever promise to. (replacive) 
It’s an extremely simple device, but actually, it’s very effective. (upgrading) 
Additive connectives include also, furthermore, in addition, besides. 
Upgrading connectives include in fact, as a matter of fact, actually, indeed. Actually 
can indicate surprise; it signals that what follows may be contrary to expectations. 
These features make it especially useful with the adversative conjunction but, since 
contrast and surprise are compatible. Yet shares these features of surprise and contrast, 
and can be used as an alternative to but with surprisal and concessive meanings:
A four-year-old child was buried for three days under rubble, yet survived. 
He didn’t stay even an hour, but instead returned to London on the next train. 
(replacive). 
She promised to keep in touch, but in fact, she never wrote or phoned us. (upgrading) 
32.2  UNLINKED COORDINATION 
Linking by means of and, or or but is the most usual pattern, but it is not the only one. 
When no explicit formal link is present, but the relationship is one of equivalence, we 
have unlinked coordination, as long as a relation of relevance can be inferred. We 
interpret the meanings of the conjoins by inferring the semantic connection between 
them, based on our cultural knowledge. For instance, 1 relies on the knowledge that a 
hallmark guarantees authenticity.
1	
It must be genuine; it has the hallmark.
2	
It’s like going out with a child; she stops dead and refuses to go any further. 
3	
He had been drinking very hard – only I knew how hard. 
4	
You must make up a better excuse: no-one will believe that.
In the spoken language, intonation is a helpful guide, while in writing the symmetry 
of this type of clause relationship is reflected in punctuation by the use of the semi-
colon, colon or dash, the latter most common in fictional dialogue. In essays and other 
academic genres the correct use of the semi-colon is approved of as it reflects balance, 
while a dash could seem too informal. 
Instead of relying on implicit semantic connection between the clauses, clarifying 
connectives can also prove useful here in making explicit the type of connection in 
each case. Ultimately, it is the choice of the speaker or writer to present the relationships 
as s/he sees them, relying on the hearer’s ability to make the connection: 

2 5 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
This picture is not the original; in other words, it’s a forgery. (restating) 
We need someone to fix this machine; that is to say, we need a mechanic. (restating) 
You can’t count on trains being punctual here; for instance, the 10.55 left at 11.15 
yesterday. (exemplification) 
I was completely ignorant of women; in fact, I knew none except my own sisters. 
(upgrading)
I didn’t mind their questions – indeed, I was glad to be able to answer them. 
(upgrading) 
32.3  LOWER LEVEL COORDINATION
It is not only finite clauses that can be coordinated. Other levels of conjoined 
grammatical units include the following: 
non-finite subordinate clauses of time: While talking on their cell-phones or 
smoking cigarettes 
 complements of a preposition: fear of heights, crowds, open spaces
a non-clausal unit coordinated with a clausal one: One tidal wave and half a fishing 
village is wiped out.
This latter type of coordination is in fact a type of condition, based on inference. 
This ability of most types of units to admit coordination, from morphemes in a 
word to adjuncts in a clause, is one of the ways of expanding on a topic while staying 
within the chosen structure at any point in the discourse. This aid to creativity is first 
introduced in 3.7.1, in Basic Concepts. 
32.3.1  Free and fixed order of coordinates 
In simple coordination, the coordinates can generally be reversed: 
(a)	 You can have eggs and bacon	
(b)	 You can have bacon and eggs
(a)	 We can go by bus or by train.	
(b)	 We can go by train or by bus.
However, there are a number of expressions in which the order is fixed by convention, 
such as bread and butter, in and out, fast and furious, now or never, over and above, sooner 
or later, time and again, up and down, wait and see, young and old.
There are also many others which, while not rigidly fixed, are conventionally used 
in a preferred order: black or white, bride and groom, common or garden, hope and pray, 
knife and fork, men and women, salt and pepper.
32.3.2  Intermediate coordination-subordination 
There is a kind of clausal coordination, that is intermediate between that of the ‘pure’ 
coordinators – and, but and or – and subordination. The secondary clause is introduced 
by one of the following:

C O M B I N I N G  C L A U S E S  
2 5 7
a conjunctive combination formed by and plus another item: and then, and this, 
and there, and so, and yet, and still, and consequently/as a result.
and plus a connective such as at that time, soon afterwards, till then, in that case. 
He criticises his colleagues and yet relies on them for support.
She turned the corner and there stood Paul waiting for her.
He had not taken the precaution of being vaccinated and as a result he got malaria.

RELATIONSHIPS OF	
UNIT 33 
NON-EQUIVALENCE	
Dependency in clause combinations
SUMMARY
1	
The sentence relative is a free-standing dependent clause which has 
become popular in speech and informal writing. Speakers use it to make a 
neat evaluative comment or response as the talk evolves. Which or Which 
is what are the relative pronouns used, as in Which is what I meant. 
2	
Non-finite –ing and –en clauses such as eating chocolate or enveloped in 
mist are used to add background in formation to a main clause. They can 
be introduced by a preposition as in without realising the danger.
3	
Implicit meanings of –ing forms are not spelt out but are easy to interpret, 
as in wondering what to say.
4	
Meanings of contrast and exception are expressed by whereas, while and 
except for. 
33.1  SENTENCE RELATIVE CLAUSES 
The sentence relative is one type of supplementive clause. It has as its antecedent the 
whole first clause, or its complement. The relative pronoun is which. Which is what /
why /where are also used, particularly in spoken English.
They decided not to go, which turned out to be a mistake.
We promised you the sun would shine, which it did.
He’ll probably forget I ever mentioned it. Which suits me fine.
The sentence relative is characterised by certain features: 
• 
It is only loosely connected to its antecedent clause. Although its subordinate 
status is signalled by the relativiser which, it is a parenthetical supplementive that 
has considerable semantic independence. 
• 
Semantically, the sentence relative makes an independent statement, which is 
an extension of the already complete unit. It adds an evaluative comment or a 
justification to something that is already identified. 

C O M B I N I N G  C L A U S E S  
2 5 9
• 
Intonationally, the supplementive clause constitutes an independent intonation 
unit which is signalled by a comma or, more informally, by a dash. 
• 
The discourse function of such clauses is to assert new information in the form of 
a comment without making it the main point of the utterance. 
Sentence relative clauses have become versatile in English. It is now quite common to 
find them functioning as freestanding subordinate clauses after a pause. They may be 
uttered by the same speaker or added by the addressee as a collaborative response, 
usually of an evaluative nature: 
A.	 Perhaps she thinks it sounds better. 	 B.  Which it does really.

[KD8]
A.	 He goes out playing squash, then 
he’s not eating his main meal until
eleven o’clock at night. 	
	
B.  Which is stupid
[KBC] 
Many such clauses can be paraphrased by a coordinated clause (e.g. and it does; and 
it’s stupid.). The relativiser which in a supplementive clause marks the closeness of the 
comment to the previous discourse. Which is sometimes considered as a one-word 
substitute for the coordinated or the unlinked structure.
33.2  NON-FINITE SUPPLEMENTIVE CLAUSES: SPECIFYING 
AND COMMENTING 
The non-finite participial forms –ing and –en are used as supplementives to elaborate 
on the main clause by making an explanatory comment. The non-finite form may have 
its own explicit subject, as in 3 and 4:
1	
At that moment Ivan appeared in the hall, propelling himself in a wheelchair. 
2	
The mountains were invisible, enveloped in a thick mist.
3	
That was the last time I saw him, his face all covered in bandages. 
4	
The soldiers filled the coaches, the younger ones eating sandwiches and chocolate. 
33.3  Conjunctive prepositions + íng forms 
This combination, through dependency, expresses additive, adversative and replacive 
meanings which correspond to those found with coordination:
Besides /As well as being a professional pianist he is also a keen amateur singer.	 	
(additive) 
With/what with moving house and starting a new job, they are finding it all	
 
a bit too much. (informal)
He has embarked on a huge project without realising what is involved. (adversative) 
Instead of turning left, you should have gone straight ahead. (replacive) 

2 6 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
33.4  IMPLICIT MEANINGS OF –ING SUPPLEMENTIVES 
Without a preposition, the –ing form is indeterminate in meaning. This is not to be 
considered as some sort of deficiency, but rather as an economical means of expressing 
relationships that are not required to be further specified, since hearers and readers 
infer the relevance of the relationship intended by the writer. 
With the –ing form and a main clause with a finite verb, the following implied 
meanings are typical: 
• 
an action and a mental process occurring simultaneously:
They drove on, wondering how long their petrol would last. (additive = and 
wondered)
• 
a mental process, with the -ing clause implying an adversative meaning 
Not realising the danger, she stumbled towards the edge of the cliff. 
• 
two or more actions occurring simultaneously. 
The dog leapt forward, baring its teeth. (additive) 
• 
two consecutive actions: 
Leaving the car unlocked, he walked quickly towards the group of people. 
Unlike coordinated clauses, these combinations tend to be reversible, as for instance: 
‘Baring its teeth, the dog leapt forward’. Considerations of end-weight (→ 30.3.2 ) and 
discourse connectivity (→ 35.5) will determine the choice.
33.5  CONTRASTIVE DEPENDENCY: WHILE, WHEREAS, BUT FOR 
THE FACT THAT
Meanings of contrast and exception similar to those encoded by coordination can 
also be expressed by dependency. The conjunctions whereas and while introduce finite 
subordinate clauses which contrast in some way with the main clause, particularly 
when there is some point of similarity between the two, as in: 
Jamie already speaks two foreign languages, whereas her brother hasn’t yet learned 
any. 
Michelle, 24, works in an electronics factory, while Colette, 15, is still at school.
But for the fact that and except express the meaning of exception:
I would take you to the station, except that the car is being repaired. 
It would have been a disaster, but for the fact that everyone helped to save the situation.

SUBORDINATION AND	
UNIT 34
SUBORDINATORS	
Adverbial clauses of time, condition, 
concession and manner
SUMMARY
1	
Subordinating conjunctions (subordinators, for short) are of three types: 
simple (consisting of one word), conjunctive groups (two words) and 
complex (derived from verbs or phrases).
2	
Clauses of condition are basically introduced by the simple subordinator 
‘if’. Conditional meanings and constructions are also of three types: open 
(or real), hypothetical, and counterfactual. Conditionals represent the most 
important of all circumstantial clauses discussed here. 
34.1  FINITE DEPENDENT CLAUSES AND THEIR 
SUBORDINATORS
Finite clauses are introduced by a subordinator, which serves to indicate the status 
of the clause together with its circumstantial meaning. Formally, subordinating 
conjunctions can be grouped as follows: 
• 
simple conjunctions  when, wherever, where, wherever, because, if, unless, until, 
while, as, although
• 
conjunctive groups  as if, as though, even if, even though, even when, soon after, 
no sooner 
• 
complex conjunctions  there are three sub-classes: 

2 6 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
(i)	 derived from verbs, usually from	
provided (that), granted (that),
 present or past participles, and 	
considering (that), seeing (that),
occasionally  from imperatives 	
­supposing (that), so (that).
(suppose that). All but the adverbial 
types have optional that:	
(ii)	 containing a noun:	
in case, to the event that, to the extent that, 
in spite of the fact that, the day, the way
(iii)	 adverbial: 	
so/as long as, as soon as, so/as far as, 
much as, now (that) 
Some of these conjunctions and their meanings are illustrated in 34.3.
34.2  ADVERBIAL CLAUSES OF TIME, CONCESSION, REASON, 
PURPOSE, RESULT AND MANNER 
Certain circumstantial meanings, such as time, have several sub-types: for instance, 
‘realis’ refers to an event that really occurs or occurred, whereas ‘irrealis’ refers to an 
event that hasn’t yet occurred and perhaps won’t occur. Most conjunctions of time can 
be used to introduce either meaning. 
Time
As (simultaneous) 	
The crowd roared as the ball hit the net. 
After (realis) 	
Soon after the war ended the men returned.
Before (irrealis) 	
He got away before they could stop him.
Since	
(starting-point of duration) We haven’t met since 
we were at school.
When (realis) 	
When he saw me he waved.
When (irrealis) 	
When you reach the station, give me a ring.
Whenever (realis/irrealis)	
He comes round whenever he can. 
	
Come round whenever you like.
While (simultaneous) 	
The burglar broke into the house while they were 
asleep.
Now that (time-reason) 	
Now that the days are longer, it’s worth driving up 
to the Lakes. 
As soon as (realis) 	
As soon as she got into bed, the phone rang. 
As soon as (irrealis) 	
Call me as soon as the plane lands. 
The day (realis) 	
We first met the day we went on a staff excursion. 
The moment (irrealis) 	
The moment you hear the car draw up, give me a 
shout.
Until (duration + end-point)	
Stay in bed until the pain goes away.
Approximations
As far as (to the extent that)	
As far as I know, no date has been fixed for the 
wedding.

C O M B I N I N G  C L A U S E S  
2 6 3
Insofar as (to the degree that)	
Insofar as change has occurred, it has been due 
to outside pressure
Provided that (condition)	
Provided (that) you give us the order, the goods 
will be delivered in ten days’ time.
Before (condition)	
Get out before I call the police!
Although/though (concession)	
He’ll probably say no, though it’s worth trying.
While (concession)	
While I admire his tenacity, I deplore his 
ruthlessness.
For all that (AmE)(concession)	
For all that he’s a star player, his tax dodging has 
caught him out.
As (reason)	
As he’s an only child, he gets a good deal of 
attention.
Since (reason) 	
Since he won’t be at home, we’ll use the mobile 
(cell phone AmE).
So that (purpose) 	
Fasten the sunshade securely, so that it won’t 
blow away. 
Manner
As if/as though	
He talks as if/as though he owned the place.
The way 	
The way things are going, there’ll be more tourists than 
residents here.
Note that, unlike some languages, English does not use a subjunctive nor a future per­
fect tense when referring to irrealis states or events. Instead, a normal present or past 
form, occasionally will or should + infinitive are used; for instance: ‘In order that no mis­
takes should be made, everyone was informed by letter’ (formal). Fasten the sunshade 
securely so that it won’t blow away. 
34.3  CONDITIONAL CLAUSES 
Among the wide range of meanings expressed by subordinate clauses, condition is 
of particular interest to both native and non-native speakers of English. In contrast 
to certain other European languages, which use a wide range of verb forms in both
the conditional clause and the main clause, English uses only one of three tenses in the 
conditional clause: present, past and past perfect tenses. A modal may be used in the 
main clause.
Conditional clauses are typically introduced by the subordinating conjunction if: 
  1	 If it’s not too expensive, we’ll buy it straight away. 
  2	 If you leave right now, you’ll be able to catch the last train.
  3	 If Tom passes his driving test, he will soon be buying a car, for sure.
Conditions are divided into three main types: open, hypothetical and counterfactual. 
The first type is a real condition, while the other two types show varying degrees of 
remoteness (irrealis). 

2 6 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
34.3.1  Open conditional clauses 
An open condition, in real situations, is said to be ‘real’ or ‘neutral’ in that it leaves 
open the possibility of being fulfilled. The speaker does not know whether or not 
Tom will pass his driving-test, for instance. An open condition implies futurity, and a 
future-related outcome is typically marked by a modal verb in the main clause. The 
conditional structure is basically as follows: 
 If + present tense in the conditional clause. Modal verb with future reference or 
some other irrealis operator in the main clause: 
  4	 If he leaves, you can bet your bottom dollar he’ll take a lot of the best customers 
with him. 
  5	 If you decide to come to the concert you should hurry and get tickets before 
they’re sold out. 
Habitual meanings and facts can be expressed by the present tense in both the if-clause 
and the main clause, as in the extract from Alan Ayckbourn’s Just between Ourselves; 
and also as in 6. In open conditions the simple past tense is also possible with reference 
to a past event, as in 9. The main clause generally makes a statement, but a question 7 
or an imperative, as in 1 and 7, respectively, are also common. 
I haven’t got time, mother, to start putting things in tins. If I want a nail, there’s a nail. I 
bang it in and that’s that. If I can’t find a nail I use a screw. And if I can’t find a screw, 
I don’t bother. 
  6	 If you pour oil on water it floats /it will float.
  7	 If she lives next door to you, how is it you never see her? (AmE How come . . . ?)
  8	 If you have just heard it on the late night news, it will be in all the papers 
tomorrow.
  9	 If you insist on staying, kindly take a seat over there. 
In open conditions unless can often be used with the meaning of ‘except if’, with a 
similar meaning to if . . . not: 
10	 Unless Tom passes his driving test, he won’t be buying a car yet. (If Tom 
doesn’t pass . . . )
11	 There’ll be no newspapers tomorrow unless the strike is called off. (If the strike 
is not called off . . . ) 
In questions, if not is used, as in 12a, where unless is ungrammatical. The same applies 
to a statement within a context of surprise, as in 12b:
12a	
Where is she staying, if not with her parents? /*unless with her parents?
12b	
I shall be surprised if the flight is not cancelled /*I shall be surprised unless 
the flight is cancelled. (The asterisk marks ungrammaticality). 

C O M B I N I N G  C L A U S E S  
2 6 5
Note that modal will, shall, would, could are not normally used in the conditional if 
clause to express a condition; for instance we don’t say *If you will have a problem 
or *If Tom will pass his driving test. However, would + if clause is found in three 
conventional situations, namely: (a) expressing willingness; (b) in polite requests, 
showing deference, and in (c) expressing a wish. In the latter case ‘only’ is necessary: 
13a	
I should be grateful if you would reply as soon as possible. (willingness)
13b	
If you would accompany me to Reception . . . . (deference) 
13c	
If only the rain would stop! (wish) 
34.3.2  Hypothetical conditional clauses 
In the second type of conditional clause, the hypothetical conditional, the past 
tense is used to indicate modal remoteness; the event or state coded in the condition 
is seen as less likely to be fulfilled, though not hypothetically impossible. The structure 
is If + past tense remote (i.e. without any relation to past time) + would or another 
‘remote’ modal such as could or might preceding the lexical verb in the main clause. 
14	 If you left now, you would /might catch the last train.
15	 If Tom passed his driving test, he would soon be buying a car. 
If the verb in the conditional clause is be, the subjunctive mood form were is preferred, 
in good usage, to the indicative was, not only with plural subjects but also singular. 
The expression If I were you is conventionally used to give advice: 
16	 If I were you, I wouldn’t agree to carry a package for someone on a flight. 
Were and the modal should are also used to add an element of tentativeness. In 17, if 
is replaced by subject- operator inversion using the subjunctive were + to-infinitive. In 
18 the verb is should with subject-operator inversion, and in 19 should occurs together 
with if. All three forms imply a greater degree of remoteness, whether of unlikelihood, 
politeness or deference. 
17	 Were anyone to ask me to carry a package on a flight, I would certainly refuse. 
18	 Should you decide to come to the concert, we can meet at the concert hall. 
19	 If you should change your mind, just let me know. 
34.3.3  Counterfactual conditional clauses 
The third type of conditional clause is the counterfactual conditional. In this type 
the event or state is presented as counter to reality: it didn’t happen. This is the highest 
degree of remoteness. The structure has If + a past perfect in the conditional clause, and 
a modal perfect (would + have + past participle of the lexical verb) in the main clause. 
If you had given me a ring (BrE) /a buzz (informal) /called me (AmE), we might 
have met somewhere. 
If anyone had asked me to carry a package on the flight I would have refused. 

2 6 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Subject-operator inversion with the auxiliary had is also a rather formal alternative to 
if in a counterfactual conditional clause: 
Had you given me a ring/called me, we might have met somewhere. 
The counterfactual construction is associated not only with conditional clauses; it can 
occur in other discourse contexts such as expressing regret or reproof at something 
that didn’t take place: 
It would have been a pleasure to meet your son. (but we didn’t meet him)
You should have told us he was coming. (but you didn’t)
We would have very much liked to see the Cup Final. (but we didn’t) 
34.3.4  Rhetorical conditional clauses 
It’s a stupid idea, if you ask me.
Let me introduce myself, if I may. (In which the speaker pretends to ask permission 
of the hearer to introduce herself) 
Expressions such as If Jack Jones is the best golfer in Scotland, I’m Tiger Woods, are also 
instances of rhetorical condition. 
34.3.5  Condition-Concession 
Even if combines the meanings of condition and concession: 
Even if you take a taxi you will still miss your train.
If-clauses are sometimes used in which the condition is not contingent on the main 
clause (→ Pragmatic conjunction)

DISCOURSE FUNCTIONS OF 	
UNIT 35
CONJUNCTIONS, 	
CIRCUMSTANTIALS AND	
THEIR MEANINGS 	
35.1  Pragmatic conjunction 
Conjunctions express the semantic relationships between the units they connect, 
reflecting the speaker’s view of the connection between states of affairs in the world. 
Pragmatic conjunction, on the other hand, has more to do with speech acts than with 
experiential organisation. Compare: 
1	
If all goes well, we’ll reach Dover by four. (experiential) 
2	
If you’re looking for Amy, she’s left. (pragmatic) 
In 1 reaching Dover by four is conditional on all going well. In 2, this is not so. The 
fact that Amy has left is not conditioned by the possibility that you are looking for her. 
Rather, 2 specifies a situation in which the main clause she’s left would be relevant. Now 
compare the following: 
3	
Sam arrived late because he missed his train. 
4	
Is there a fire somewhere? ’Cos I can smell smoke. 
In 3 the because-clause states the reason Sam arrived late – he missed his train. In 4 on 
the other hand, my smelling smoke is not the reason for the fire. Rather, the because-
clause, in its abbreviated form ’cos, gives the reason for the speech act of enquiring 
whether there is a fire. 
Pragmatic clauses with ’cos as in 4 have something in common with sentential 
relative supplementive clauses: both are semantically and prosodically independent 
while syntactically marked as dependent (by a conjunction and by a wh-relative, 
respectively). These somewhat conflicting properties lead one to think that both 
pragmatic conjunction and the wh-non-restrictor are taking on functions in discourse 
different from the traditional functions ascribed to them.
Pragmatic conjunctions occur sentence-initially and paragraph-initially, often at 
the beginning of a speaker’s turn in conversation, typically (though not necessarily) in 
direct relation to what the previous speaker has just said.

2 6 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
And is the most difficult to characterise. One possibility is that pragmatic and 
makes an explicit point of departure for a new direction in spoken discourse, as in 
5B. It is common at turn boundaries in conversation and also in radio and television 
presentations, 6. 
5	
A  He stopped me and said ‘Where are you going, love?’ 
	
B  And I said ‘What is it to you? And don’t call me ‘love’. 
6	
And now it’s time for the nine o’clock news. 
So indicates that a conclusion has been drawn 7 while pragmatic or introduces a 
question, 8 Both so and or elicit a response. 
7	
So this is where you live. 
8	
Can you give me a hand with this? Or don’t you want to have it fixed? 
35.2  Non-finite clauses expressing circumstantial meanings 
35.2. 1  Explicit markers of circumstantial meanings 
Not all conjunctions and prepositions are able to function as introducers of non-finite 
clauses. Those that can do form a sub-set of the total class of each. 
Sub-set of conjunctions 
when	
Take extra care when driving at night
while	
(concession) While agreeing basically with your proposal, we would 
nevertheless suggest certain amendments.
although	
Although feeling unwell, she made an effort to appear cheerful.
if	
If travelling abroad, watch out for pickpockets.
Sub-set of conjunctive prepositions

Look both ways before crossing.

on	
On entering the mosque, we were impressed by its spaciousness.
without	
(reason) Without having read the book, I can’t give an opinion. 
35.2.2  Verb forms as circumstantial markers 
Certain circumstantial meanings are frequently expressed by the to-infinitive, the –ing 
and the en-participial forms alone. Of these the to infinitive is the most explicit since it 
usually expresses purpose: 
to-infinitive clauses	 To relieve backache, apply liniment daily.
-ing clauses: 	
Living abroad, he rarely sees his parents (because).
-en clauses:	
Too excited to sleep, he paced up and down the room (because). 

C O M B I N I N G  C L A U S E S  
2 6 9
Conventions of good English require that the implicit subject of a non-finite clause 
should be identical with the explicit subject of the main clause. Compare the acceptable 
(a) with the less acceptable (b), which unintentionally suggests that the jellyfish was 
bathing in the sea. 
(a)	 Bathing in the sea, I got stung by a jellyfish.
(b)	 Bathing in the sea, a jellyfish stung me.
That this norm is not always adhered to is illustrated by the following ‘editor’s comment’ 
from the BBC series Yes, Prime Minister: 
[Working funerals are the best sort of summit meeting. Ostensibly arranged for 
another purpose, statesmen and diplomats can mingle informally at receptions, 
churches and gravesides, and achieve more than ten ‘official’ summits for which 
expectations have been aroused Ed. ]
Evidence from a cognitive study suggests that the cognitive weight of the most promi­
nent discourse referent overrides syntactic constraints. In the circumstances, the 
cognitive weight of the statesmen and diplomats, not to mention the jellyfish, would 
override the finer syntactic requirement in each case (→ Further reading). 
35.3  Discourse connectivity and cohesion: Initial vs 
final circumstantial clauses 
Adverbial clauses are placed either before the main clause, as in 1, or after it, as in 2: 
1	
If you have a problem, call us immediately.
2	
Call us at any time if you need advice. 
Position is related to the degree of integration between the two clauses. 
Semantically a circumstantial in final position tends to have tight connections 
with the main clause, to which it may be linked without a comma in writing or a 
pause in speech. In such cases it is closely integrated into the semantic structure 
of the main clause: 
3	
The problem arises because there is nothing in our day to day life to provide 
us with sufficient exercise.
[AYK] 
From a discourse perspective, an initial circumstantial clause tends to have wider 
textual connections with what preceded it, often reaching back some distance. It 
also provides a frame for what follows and can be paragraph-initial. It is likely to be 
followed by a comma or pause. Consequently, an initial circumstantial is likely to be 
less integrated into the main clause, as in 4:
4	
Because tranquillisers simply mask symptoms rather than provide a cure, you may 
need to seek help to deal with the problem which caused you to need the tab­
lets in the first place.
[AYK] 

2 7 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Example 4 illustrates the greater integration of the to-infinitive clause compared with 
the framing function of the because clause. 
An initial dependent clause, often with progressive aspect (→ 43.4) can provide a

REPORTING SPEECH AND 	
UNIT 36
THOUGHT	
SUMMARY 
1 	 Speakers report the utterances of other speakers, or their own, in one of two 
ways: either directly by ‘direct reported speech’ (also known as ‘quoted 
speech’), or indirectly by ‘indirect reported speech’. Thought processes 
can also be reported. Quoted speech supposedly repeats the exact words 
spoken, whereas indirect speech reporting gives the content or even only 
the gist of what was said.
2 	 Verbs of saying and of thinking are used to introduce direct speech and 
thought, respectively. Idiomatic uses of the verbs go and be like are also 
used by some speakers as alternatives to verbs of saying.
3 	 Indirect reporting of speech (traditionally known as ‘indirect speech’ ) 
reports the content of statements, questions and directives. A number of 
formal adjustments are made, referred to as ‘backshift’, which shift deictic 
elements away from the speech situation to the reported situation.
4 	 In fictional dialogue, and to a lesser extent in conversation, a wide variety 
of reporting verbs occur, many not strictly verbs of speaking, which aim 
to convey such features as speaker’s stance, voice quality and speech-act 
force.
5 	 In addition, and in order to give the reader the illusion of entering a 
character’s mind, writers of fiction combine features of quoted and reported 
speech to produce the varieties known as ‘free direct speech’ and ‘free 
indirect speech’. 
36.1  DIRECT AND INDIRECT REPORTING 
There are two main ways of reporting what someone said or what we ourselves said:
directly 1, and indirectly 2: 

2 7 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
1 	 She said ‘I’ll wait for you’.
2 	 She said she would wait for us. 
Direct (‘quoted’) speech reporting supposedly repeats the exact words that 
someone said or wrote, while indirect speech reporting gives the meaning, 
or the gist of the content. Depending on the verb used, a good deal of further 
information can also be provided – for instance, the type of speech act being 
carried out, such as asking, complaining, responding, or the voice quality of the 
speaker: 
‘I hear you’ve been having a tough time,’ he responded.
‘You haven’t sent me the Sunday supplement,’ she complained. 
Between quoted and indirect reported speech, there is a difference of immediacy. In 
quoting, the quoted clause appears to have independent status; its effect, therefore, is 
more dramatic and life-like. Tenses, pronouns and other deictic elements are orientated 
towards the speech situation, while in reported speech they shift away from it. The 
formal modifications of this shift are explained in section 36.3.
N.B. There is also a difference in referring back to something which has been 
quoted and something which has been reported. To refer to the actual words quoted, 
a reference word such as that is typically used, whereas to refer to an indirect report, a 
substitute form such as so or not is used: 
He said, ‘I’ll pay this time.’	
Did he really say that? 
He said he would pay that time. 	
Did he really say so? 
36.2  DIRECT REPORTING OF SPEECH AND THOUGHT 
Direct (‘quoted’) speech is a common feature of everyday conversation, of 
fictional dialogue and, to a lesser extent, news and other genres. In direct speech, the 
reporting clause contains a verb of saying, while the reported clause contains what 
is said. The reporting clause may be placed initially, finally or medially. If it is placed 
medially, the quoted speech is discontinuous as in c.With a proper name, inversion 
of subject and verb is another option d. However, with a pronoun (said she), inversion 
is archaic. 
(a)	 She said, ‘I’m a telly addict and I always have been’. 
(b)	 ‘I’m a telly addict and I always have been,’ she said. 
(c)	 ‘I’m a telly addict’, she said, ‘and I always have been.’
(d)	 ‘I’m a telly addict’, said Danielle, ‘and I always have been.’
As there is no linking or subordinating element in a between the reporting verb and the 
quoted speech, the structural relationship between them is indeterminate. In b, c and 
d the reporting clause is clearly parenthetical.
In spoken English, the reporting clause receives less prosodic prominence than 
what is reported, in whatever position it occurs. This reflects the fact that what is said 
is more important than the introductory clause of saying.

C O M B I N I N G  C L A U S E S  
2 7 3
These two features – the mobility of the reporting clause and the importance of 
what is said – are sometimes interpreted as evidence that I think, he said, for example, 
in whatever position, are not main clauses at all, but are better analysed as epistemic, 
evidential or evaluative parentheticals, while what is traditionally classed as the 
complement clause is in fact the main proposition.
A further view sees the relationship between the clauses as one of projection: the 
reporting clause ‘projects’ the projected clause as either a locution or an idea.
Quoted speech in conversation and written dialogue 
Verbs used to introduce quoted speech in conversation and writing are summarised in 
the table below. 
Conversation
Written dialogue
say (and, less commonly, tell)
Say is the basic verb
go, be like
Tell, write (the latter quoting written sources is used only to 
characterise a type of user)
not normally used
Verbs quoting statements: announce, explain, observe, 
point out, remark, report
ask is used – the others not 
normally used
Verbs quoting questions: ask, demand, enquire, query, 
and exclamations: exclaim
not normally used
Verbs indicating speech act force: affirm, answer, argue, 
beg, complain, object, protest, urge, warn,
or verbs which refer to the circumstances of the speech act: 
interrupt, reply, respond
normally only shout
Verbs indicating manner of locution: bark, bleat, chirp, 
cry, drawl, grumble, hiss, holler, moan, mumble, 
murmur, mutter, scream, shout, shriek, snap, snarl, 
stutter, whine, whisper, yell
not normally used
Non-utterance emotive verbs accompanying speech:
Laughter: chuckle, grin, giggle, laugh, smile, twinkle
Weeping: moan, sob, wail
Excitement, concern: breathe, pant
Incredulity: gasp
Pain, anger: bellow, choke, flash
For the difference between say and tell → 11.2, ch. 3. Basically, say is a two-place verb 
which does not take a core Recipient, not admitting, for example, *say me your name. 
Tell is a three-place verb with a core Recipient (tell me your name). Pragmatically, say is 
used to report what is said, while tell typically informs.
Go and be like are becoming widely used as quotative alternatives to say, both in 
younger speakers’ conversation and in the popular media. Like says and said, go and be 
like signal that the speaker is moving into direct speech mode. Normal combinations 
of tense and aspect occur with go and be like; however, the present tense appears to 
predominate even for past time reference (I’m like, she’s like): 
 . . . and I was going . . . I’ll have to take my stereo home and he goes yeah your 
stereo’s quite big isn’t it, and I went when have you seen my stereo and he goes oh 

2 7 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
I came up the other day to see if you were in. I went why why, he said I just came 
round to your room and you weren’t there but your music was on.
[KPH]
‘It’s just happened so fast,’ says the former Shanna Jackson. ‘Some days people 
will call me “Paris” and I’m like, “Who?” My mother still refuses to call me Paris.’
[HSJ] 
The range of verbs used as ‘quotatives’ is wider in written dialogue than in spoken 
because writers attempt to heighten interest by conveying not only the words said 
but also something of voice quality, attitude and manner of speaking of the character, 
whether fictional or real. All these are perceived by hearers in a speech situation but 
are absent from basic verbs of saying. 
‘I’ll take the cases,’ he whispered.
‘Trainers,’ I echoed, ‘What trainers?’
‘Come on, lads,’ Tommy yelled.
‘You’re mad at me, aren’t you?’ she wailed.
‘I said come in, Mrs Friar!’ John barked at her. 
Direct reporting of thought
Not only words may be quoted, but also thoughts. The first two examples below are 
often heard in the spoken language, the third would be typical in fiction:
I think I’ll have a beer.
I wonder what he’s doing.
‘I’ll have to get a new bulb for this lamp,’ thought Peter. 
Mental process verbs which occur as quotatives are few in number in English, in 
comparison with the wide variety of verbs used in quoted speech. They include think, 
the basic verb, and other verbs of cognition which express some additional, often 
aspectual meaning: muse, ponder, reflect, wonder.
In representing their characters’ thought, writers of fictional narrative often omit 
the prosodic signals of quoting (inverted commas or dashes), and make the clause 
of thinking parenthetical. The following extract from Virginia Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway 
illustrates this technique: 
He’s very well dressed, thought Clarissa, yet he always criticises me.
Here she is mending her dress; mending her dress as usual, he thought; here she’s 
been sitting all the time I’ve been in India; mending her dress; running to the House and 
back and all that, he thought, growing more and more irritated, more and more agi­
tated, for there’s nothing in the world so bad for some women as marriage, he thought; 
and politics; and having a Conservative husband, like the admirable Richard. So it is, so 
it is, he thought, shutting his knife with a snap.

36.3  BACKSHIFT IN INDIRECT REPORTING 
Indirect speech reporting is characterised by a series of formal features that distinguish 
it from quoted speech reporting. They have the effect of shifting all deictic elements 
(personal pronouns, demonstratives, tense and adverbs of time and place) away from 
direct reference to the speech situation, and instead to the reporting situation, as in 
the following example (we don’t give all the possible personal pronoun shifts, which 
depend on context):
‘I want you to drink this juice.’  I/you/he/she said she wanted him/me to drink 
that juice. 
The shifts involved are as follows: 
••
Personal pronouns in the 1st person, which refer to the speaker, are shifted to 
2nd or 3rd person, unless the speaker is reporting him/herself, as in 1 below. The 
2nd person pronoun, which refers to the listener, is shifted to 1st or 3rd, according 
to the identity of the listener, again as in 1.
••
Demonstratives and deictic adverbs which refer to the here and now (this, 
these, here, now) are replaced by more remote forms (that, those, there, then) 1 and 4.
••
Verb tenses are ‘back-shifted’ – that is, present forms are replaced by past forms 
1, 2, 4, 5. This shift is not obligatory if the described state still holds, as in 3.
••
Clause type is also affected. A quoted interrogative with say is replaced by a 
declarative introduced by ask in reported speech 7. Imperatives and verbless 
clauses have less clear correspondences, and are discussed later in this and other 
sections.
Direct (quoted) speech
Indirect speech
1  ‘I want you to drink this juice.’
I/you/he/she said I/she wanted him/me to 
drink that juice.
2  ‘I won’t be long,’ she said.
She said she wouldn’t be long.
3  He said ‘We are naked apes. They are 
the same as us inside.’
He said that we are/were naked apes and 
that they are the same as us inside.
4  ‘Can you leave this book here?’ he said.
He asked if I/we/she could leave that book 
there.
5  ‘It’s good!’ Magda says.
Magda said that it was good.
6  ‘Do it yourselves!’ I said.
I told them to do it themselves.
7  ‘Must you go so soon?’ she said.
She asked whether we/they had to go as 
soon as that.
Figure 7.1  Direct and indirect speech.
Verbs used in indirect statements and questions are essentially the same as those used 
in quoting. The main exceptions are shown in the table. 

2 7 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Verbs used only in quoting 
Verbs used only in indirect reporting
(a)  verbs which express rhetorical processes: 
claim, deny, hypothesise, imply, 
insinuate, maintain, make out, pretend.
(b)  verbs of cognition, wishing and affection: 
believe, feel, hold (=believe), imagine, 
understand, fear, suspect, think, hope, 
wish, want, like.
(c)  Non-utterance verbs as in 36.2, 
such as laugh, smile, sob, moan, gasp: 
          ‘Thank you,’ she smiled.
          ‘Yes,’ he sighed.
Occasionally, these verbs are used in 
indirect reporting, for instance:
        She smiled her thanks.
        He sighed his consent.
(a)	 Verbs such as claim, deny, insinuate represent an interpretation on the part of 
the reporter of the speech act in the original situation, and can indicate a certain 
stance, for instance of reservation or disbelief: 
She claims her mother was related to a Polish aristocrat.
He denies being involved in the incident.
Are you insinuating that he knows something about it?
(b)	 The combination of mental processes with a reporting clause is the normal way 
of representing what people think, believe, hope, want and like. These typically 
occur as reported states of wishing, wanting, and so on, since such mental states 
are rarely quoted; even the possible form with let as in ‘Let me be the first to speak to 
him’, Janet wished is relatively infrequent. Syntactically, they are no different from 
the complementation patterns described in Chapter 3: 
I hope that no damage has been done
It is feared that many lives have been lost. 
She wishes she had never met him. 
(c)	 Conversely, verbs which are not intrinsically verbs of saying are not normally used 
in indirect reporting. These include verbs of laughing, weeping, and the like, as 
exemplified in section 36.2. A quoted locution such as ‘So what?’, he sneered would 
be difficult to report in a similar form, and even perhaps with a similar meaning. 
A paraphrase such as He asked with a sneer what it mattered might be considered 
acceptable within a certain context. 
36.4  REPORTED OFFERS, SUGGESTIONS AND COMMANDS 
So far we have considered quoted or reported statements and questions. We now 
turn to the reporting of directives – reported offers, suggestions and commands – 
which typically involves summary and paraphrase. Certain verbs are used in quoted 

C O M B I N I N G  C L A U S E S  
2 7 7
directives but are not used for reporting. Conversely, there are many verbs used in 
reported directives that are not used in quoting. There is some 
overlap, however, as may be seen from the table below. 
Quoted directives 
Reported directives
the general verb say
the general verb tell
verbs specific to offers, suggestions and
commands: offer, order, request, tell 
suggest, order, command, request, tell
verbs embodying some circumstantial or 
promise, agree, beg, insist, plead, urge, warn
the same as in quoted directives semantic 
other features: threaten, vow,
verbs with a connotative meaning: bark, 
bleat, sob, gasp
not used
not used
verbs expressing a wide range of complex 
rhetorical processes: encourage, forbid, 
persuade, recommend
36.5  CLAUSE TYPE IN THE REPORTED CLAUSE 
When we quote an offer, order or suggestion directly, there is typically an imperative 
in the quoted clause: 
  1	 ‘Hurry up!’, she said (to us).
  2	 ‘Do eat more slowly’, she begged the child.
  3	 ‘Come in and sit down’, I suggested (to her).
In reported directives, the imperative of the quoted type is replaced by a to-infinitive 
or a that-clause. The examples 1–3 of quoted directives would be reported as follows: 
  4	 She told/urged us to hurry up.
  5	 She begged the child to eat more slowly.
  6	 I suggested that she (should) come in and sit down. 
Say takes a that-clause containing either the semi- auxiliary be to or a modal of obligation 
(should, must, have to); see 11.2 for the complementation patterns of say and tell.
Using say, example 1 could be reported as follows: 
  7	 She said (that) we were to hurry up.
  8	 She said (that) we should/must hurry up. 
Say can also report a to-infinitive clause with no subject (9). In AmE a subject of the 
reported clause is here preceded by for (10). In both cases the use of say rather than 
tell suggests that the message is being relayed by a 3rd person. Compare these with 11: 
  9	 She said to hurry.
10	 She said for us to hurry.
11	 She told us to hurry. 

2 7 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Of the verbs of quoted speech(→36.2) indicating emotion and used in fictional narrative, 
only a few can be used in reporting, and require a prepositional Object. 
(‘Turn off the gas!’, he yelled.) 	
He yelled to me to turn off the gas.
(‘Stay a little longer’, he whispered.) 	 He whispered to her to stay a little longer.
Verbless clauses are quite common in quoted speech, especially in fictional narrative: 
‘Not a word!’, he whispered (to us). He whispered to us not to say/breathe a word. 
The absence of a verb presents a problem in reporting. Frequently a verb can be 
provided, although again this involves an interpretation on the part of the reporter. 
Inevitably, therefore, more than one reported version is possible, some differing 
considerably from the quoted version: 
‘This way, please’, the usher said.	
The usher asked/invited (us?) to accompany 
	
  him.
	
The usher showed (us?) the way. 
The verbless clause itself does not provide this information, such as who the receiver 
is. In effect, the two versions are different messages.
36.6  FREE DIRECT SPEECH AND FREE INDIRECT SPEECH 
In their attempts to portray the stream of thought of their characters, writers have 
modified the paradigm of reporting as outlined in the preceding sections in certain 
ways.
What we call ‘free direct speech or thought’ consists in omitting the inverted 
commas or dashes which conventionally signal quoting, as seen in the extract from 
Mrs Dalloway. More drastically, the reporting clause is omitted altogether. This is 
called ‘free indirect speech’ and also covers cognitive processes. In addition, certain 
structures of direct speech are retained, such as direct questions and exclamations, 
vocatives, utterance-time adverbs such as now and tag questions. Other features may 
belong to indirect speech, however: tense back-shift, and the temporal and spatial 
shifts of deictic words towards remoteness.
Some of these features are present in the following extract from Joyce Carol Oates’ 
story Happy, which describes a girl’s journey home from the airport with her mother 
and her mother’s new husband. 
They stopped for dinner at a Polynesian restaurant ten miles up the Turnpike, her mother 
explaining that there wasn’t anything decent to eat at home,1 also it was getting late, 
wasn’t it, tomorrow she’d be making a big dinner,2 That’s okay honey isn’t it?3 She and 
her new husband quarrelled about getting on the Turnpike then exiting right away, but 
at dinner they were in high spirits again, laughing a good deal, holding hands between 
courses, sipping from each other’s tall frosted bright-colored tropical drinks. Jesus I’m

crazy about that woman,4 her mother’s new husband told the girl when her mother 
was in the powder room, Your mother is a high-class lady, he said.5 He shifted his cane 
chair closer, leaned moist and warm, meaty, against her, an arm across her shoulders. 
There’s nobody in the world precious to me as that lady, I want you to know that, he 
said,6 and the girl said Yes I know it,7 and her mother’s new husband said in a fierce 
voice close to tears, Damn right, sweetheart, you know it.8
1indirect speech; 2free indirect speech; 3free direct speech; 4–8direct speech
36.7  FREE INDIRECT THOUGHT 
In the following passage from Lightning in May, John suspects for the first time that his 
wife may have tuberculosis. His reaction is expressed partly in direct speech introduced 
by verbs of manner (italicised) and partly in free indirect thought (underlined). By means 
of the latter, the writer or oral storyteller aims to represent the thoughts of a character. 
No reporting verb is used; indeed, there is no overt signal that the character’s, rather 
than the author’s, view or thought is being portrayed. What alerts us to the change 
of perspective is some ‘perspective-changing’ detail in the immediately preceding 
narrative – in this case ‘he opened the handkerchief’ and ‘he looked at her’: 
‘Ruth,’ he breathed, ‘how long have you had this cough?’ He stood up and she followed. 
He opened the handkerchief again. There was no mistake. Silently he cursed himself. He 
saw her now in a completely different light. ‘How long?’ he demanded.
He looked at her then held her to him. It became bluntly clear to him now. The pale, 
tired face that was thinner; the droop of her body. All the symptoms that he had put 
down to her mental state had matured into a physical one. And now a cough. How could 
he have been so stupid? Yet he had to make sure.
‘Ruthy,’ he whispered. ‘Let’s get back to the surgery. I want Dr. Jenkins to see you.’
‘What is it, John?’ she queried.
(Gordon Parker, Lightning in May)

Provide as many alternatives as you can to the verb ‘went’ in the following extract from 
All American Girl: 
Then the agent who was going through my pockets went, ‘This one seems to be unarmed.’
‘Of course I’m unarmed,’ I yelled’. I’m only in the tenth grade.’
Which is a totally lame thing to have said, because of course there are tenth graders 
who have guns. They just don’t happen to go to Adams Prep School.

A variant of free indirect speech, is to retain the reporting clause, together with the fea­
tures enumerated above. Here is an instance from Mrs Dalloway. Identify the type of shift 
in each case:

EXPRESSING OUR	
UNIT 37
EXPERIENCE OF EVENTS	
SUMMARY
1 	 Verbal Groups (VG) encode our experience of events. The term ‘event’ is 
used here in representation of all types of process, including events, states 
and activities.
2 	 The VG consists of a lexical verb (v), either alone (takes) or preceded by 
one or more auxiliaries (is taking/has been taken). The first auxiliary, the 
operator, has a special status and is distinguished by certain syntactic 
features.
3 	 The operator is of the utmost importance in English as it carries the four 
‘NICE’ functions of Negation, Inversion, Code (substitution) and Emphasis. 
It is realised by various types of auxiliary: primary, modal and lexical 
auxiliaries, which help to build up the symbolic representation of the event 
and carry a wide range of modal and aspectual meanings.
4 	 Certain of the lexical auxiliaries (e.g. be bound to) have ‘raised’ Subjects. 
37.1  SYNTACTIC ELEMENTS OF STRUCTURE OF 
THE VERBAL GROUP
The Verbal Group is the grammatical unit by means of which we most typically express 
our perception of events. ‘Event’ will be used in this chapter to cover all types of process 
in the transitivity structure, whether events, activities, states or acts of consciousness. 
These are described from the point of view of their place in the semantics of the clause 
in Chapter 5. 
A simple verbal group consists of one lexical verb (e.g. take) or primary verb (a form 
of be, have, do) which indicates tense (past or present), as in takes, is, has, does, danced, 
flew. More complex verbal groups consist of a main verb (v) preceded by one or more 
grammatical elements – the auxiliary verbs (x), as in has been, has taken, is dancing.
The lexical and grammatical elements are all integral parts of an analytical form. The 
first auxiliary has a special status and is usually called the Finite operator, ‘operator’ for 
short (o) (→ 3.1.1), for reasons which are explained in section

2 8 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
The constituent elements of the English verbal group can therefore be represented and 
exemplified as in the diagram.

(o)    (x)    (x)    v

o x v
have been waiting
He has been waiting an hour
o x x v
will have been waiting
He will have been waiting an hour
Figure 8.1  Constituent elements of the English verbal group.
37.2  REALISATIONS OF THE ELEMENTS: LEXICAL VERBS AND 
AUXILIARIES
The elements of the VG are realised by the following classes and forms of verbs:
••
lexical verbs: wait, come, rain, bring, etc.
••
primary verbs: be: am, is, are, was, were, being, been; have: has, had, having; do: 
does, did
••
modal auxiliaries: shall, should, will, would, can, could, may, might, must, ought to
••
semi-modals: need, dare, used to (modals in certain uses)
••
lexical auxiliaries:
(1)	 be able to, be about to, be apt to, be bound to, be due to, be going to, be liable 
to, be likely to, be certain to, be sure to, be to, be unlikely to, be supposed to
(2)	 have to, have got to
(3)	 had better, would rather, would sooner
The primary and modal verbs are limited in number, as this list shows, and form closed 
sets. Lexical verbs, the v or main element, constitute an open set; new ones can be 
coined and added to the lexicon at any time.
The primary verbs carry grammatical meaning (tense, aspect, person, number), 
the modal auxiliaries express modal meanings (obligation, possibility, probability, 
necessity) (→ Unit 44) rather than lexical or grammatical meaning. On the other hand, 
the lexical element of the verbal group expresses both lexical meaning and grammatical 
meaning.
The primary verbs be, have, do can function both as auxiliary and as lexical elements 
of the VG (with the exception of doing and done, which function only as lexical 
elements). The syntactic function determines the type of meaning expressed, whether 
grammatical or lexical, as shown here.

Elections are approaching.
Elections are imminent
We didn’t do anything about it.
We did everything.
He has had nothing to eat..
He had nothing to eat.
Figure 8.2  Be, have and do.
In addition to its function as a main verb, be therefore has three auxiliary functions: 
as an aspect auxiliary in the progressive: is taking; as a passive auxiliary: is taken 
(→ 38.4); and as the basis of the lexical auxiliaries that take be.
37.3  TYPES OF LEXICAL AUXILIARY
Lexical auxiliary is the term used for a set of verbs of modal or aspectual mean- 
ing which form chain-like structures with the main verb of the VG. The majority are 
followed by a V-to-infinitive form, but a few take the infinitive without to. They can 
be divided into three types according to whether their first word is (1) be; (2) have; (3) 
a modal idiom.
As with other to-infinitive uses (→ 12.2), the lexical auxiliaries tend to point to a 
future event, though not invariably so. They express subjective estimations of different 
kinds, as indicated in the brackets. Some of these auxiliaries have undergone semantic 
change, so they are not what they seem at first sight. (→ 41.6 for more on future time.)

be supposed to

(duty, general belief)

(ability, possibility)
Note that a few of the lexical words in this list can also function as adjectives: an able 
mechanic; an apt quotation; a certain/sure winner; the likely winner of the elections.
37.3.2  Have or Have got + to-infinitive
	
Have and have got + V-to-inf 	
meanings
have to 	
I have to finish these letters. 	
(obligation)
	
There has to be a solution. 	
(necessity)
have got to	
I’ve got to go now. Oh, do you have to?	
(obligation)
	
There’s got to be a solution. 	
(necessity)
Like must, these combinations have meanings of both obligation and necessity (→ 44.5). 
With these modal meanings, have got to is more common in spoken BrE , while have 
to is the preferred form in AmE (Do you have to go?) Both gonna (‘going to’) and gotta 
(‘got to’) are informal uses. 
The Subject-Finite operator inversion characteristic of be, have and other auxiliaries 
in interrogative and negative clauses is explained in Unit 23, together with the require- 
ment of a do operator by lexical verbs. As a reminder here, we exemplify have to and 
have got to in interrogative clauses, showing that while have to can function either as a 
primary auxiliary or as a lexical verb, have got to functions only as an auxiliary:
Have to	
Auxiliary	
Lexical verb
Interrogative	
Have you to go?	
Do you have to go? Don’t you  
have to go?
Negative declarative	
	
You don’t have to go
Furthermore, have got + to-infinitive has no non-finite forms and does not combine 
with modals. None of the following starred structures are possible, therefore, all being 
used with have to:
Incorrect 	
Correct
*To have got to live there must be deadful	 To have to live there . . . dreadful
*I don’t like having got to get up early.

You will have to watch out for bugs.

37.4  ‘RAISED’ SUBJECTS
You may have noticed that in clauses such as They are likely to win, the NG at Subject 
does not appear to be the logical Subject of the Complement likely to win. In fact, the 
likelihood refers not to the subject they, but to the situation of winning. Syntactically, 
then, the nominal group (they) is the logical subject of a clause embedded at subject, as 
in (a) below (that they will win), which is then extraposed, as in (b). Finally the subject 
of the sub- ordinate clause is raised to become subject of the main clause, as in (c):
(a)	 That they will win is likely.
	
(b)	 It is likely that they will win.
	
	
(c)	 They are likely to win.
This is known as subject-to-subject raising (→ 30.5.1). Likely is used a great deal 
in this construction, perhaps because its apparent synonym probable does not admit 
raising (*He is probable to win). Other lexical auxiliaries that are the result of raising are 
be certain to, sure to and supposed to.
Object-to-subject raising occurs when a NG Object of a clause embedded at 
subject (them in (a) below) is extraposed as in (b) and then is raised to subject of the 
main clause, as in (c):
(a)	 To find them is hard.
	
(b)	 It is hard to find them.
	
	
(c)	 They are hard to find.
Raised subjects have the advantage of referring to persons or things by names, nouns 
or pronouns in a clause that is shorter and simpler than the corresponding that-clause 
or extraposed structures. They also provide a different Theme and Topic (→ 28.4).
37.5  SYNTACTIC FEATURES OF THE OPERATOR ELEMENT
Any of the primary verbs or the modal auxiliaries can stand in initial position and so 
function as operator in a VG.

2 9 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
The operator element has four major distinctive properties which are not shared 
by lexical verbs. They carry the ‘operations’ in what have been called the NICE 
constructions: Negation, Inversion, Code and Emphasis. Compare:
operation
operator aux.
lexical vb
1
Negation: contraction with 
neg. particle
I don’t eat meat
*I eatn’t . . . 
2 
Inversion with S in 
interrogatives
Will you sign? 
*Sign you?

‘Code’, that is, substitute for 
the Predicator and predicate 
in a clause (→ 29.5)
I’ll go, if Ed will
I want to go if you 
do (if you *want)
4
Emphasis (by tonic stress)
Yes, I will go
I do want to go
Four more features also distinguish the operator from a lexical verb:
operation
operator aux.
lexical vb

†Position of frequency of 
adverb: in BrE follows the 
auxiliary aux, operator aux 
but precedes lex.vb
I can always go
I always want to 
go *I want always 
to go
6
Postposition of quantifiers all 
and both
They have all/ both 
gone
*They went all/ 
both They all/ 
both went
7

8
Independence of subject
Ed will teach the 
Juniors The juniors 
will be taught by Ed
Ed expects to teach 
the Juniors The 
juniors expect to

With verbs which have the active–passive contrast, operators usually show no change 
of meaning, whereas with some finite lexical verbs (e.g. expect) there is a change of 
meaning.
† While in AmE adverbs of frequency (always, often, seldom, never) also follow the 
above position, they tend to appear preferably before the auxiliary or auxiliaries: 
AmE	
You always, often, seldom, never can do it. 
AmE	
I never would have done it.
BrE, AmE 	 I would never have done it.

BASIC STRUCTURES OF	
UNIT 38
THE VERBAL GROUP	
SUMMARY
1 	 The experiential structure of the VG consists of Finite + Event + auxiliaries. 
The Finite expresses tense, person, number and modality (the latter when 
realised by a modal auxiliary). These relate the verbal process to the 
‘speaker-now’ and establish the Verbal Group in relation to the speech 
exchange. The Event expresses lexical meaning, which provides the 
representational content. Finite and Event are fused in e.g. runs, asked 
and was, has (as primary auxiliaries).
2 	 Verbal Groups can be marked for tense or modality but not both.
3 	 Verbal Group structures can be simple, consisting of one element only 
(runs, asked), or extended, consisting of one or more auxiliaries + a 
main verb (may have been running).
4 	 Up to four auxiliaries can occur, or five if a lexical auxiliary is included.
5 	 The meanings expressed by the auxiliaries are: modal, perfect, 
progressive, passive, in this order. The structures which realise these 
meanings are telescoped in the G.
6 	 The longer combinations are more frequent in spoken than in written 
English.
7 	 Non-finite VGs (having been seen) can express perfect, progressive and 
passive meanings, but not tense or modality.
8 	 Verbal Groups are discontinuous in English when the sequence of 
elements is interrupted by other clause elements or by intensifiers.
38.1  EXPERIENTIAL STRUCTURE OF THE VERBAL GROUP
In finite clauses the experiential structure of the Verbal Group is Finite + Event. The 
Finite carries tense, number and, to a limited extent, person. A modal auxiliary provides 
an alternative to a tensed auxiliary, for instance is going/may go. A tensed form and a 
modal auxiliary do not occur together: *is may go. In one-word VGs, such as takes, has 

2 9 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
(she has long hair), the finiteness is realised on the lexical verb. In longer sequences the 
Finite is realised by an operator and may be followed by one or more auxiliaries: It has 
been snowing all day.
38.2  SIMPLE STRUCTURES OF THE VERBAL GROUP
A simple Verbal Group structure consists of a single element, usually the lexical 
element, realised by a finite or non-finite form of a lexical verb, for example drive: 
Finite forms
drive (pres. indic.)	
They drive on the left in the UK.
drives (pres. indic.)	 He drives to work every day.
drove (past indic.)	
He drove out of the garage.
Non-finite forms
(to) drive (inf.)	
It’s important to drive with care.
bare infinitive	
They won’t let you drive without a licence.
driving (pres. part.) 	 Driving to work this morning, I heard the 9 o’clock news.
driven (past part.) 	
Driven away by night, the car was then abandoned.
38.3  EXTENDED STRUCTURES OF THE VERBAL GROUP
The features of grammatical meaning which can be expressed in an extended VG 
comprise the following pairs, of which tense, finiteness, polarity and contrastiveness are 
obligatory:
tense	
past, present
finiteness	
non-finite, finite
anteriority	 perfect, non-perfect
aspect	
progressive, non-progressive
modality	
modal, non-modal
polarity	
negative, positive
emphasis	
contrastive, non-contrastive
These major features of grammatical meaning represent sets of options between which 
speakers choose every time they combine elements to form a Verbal Group. 
The following extract from a story by Raymond Carver in Cathedral uses the options 
of tense (put, went, opened, came, was) all past; perfect + past (had melted, had gotten), 
modality + past + negative (couldn’t believe); finiteness: all finite except to get and the 
participles melted, run, gotten, pooled ( boxed-in is adjectival); all positive polarity except 
for couldn’t; all non-contrastive:
She put her purse on the table and went over to the fridge to get herself some yogurt. But 
when she opened the door, warm, boxed-in air came out at her. She couldn’t believe the 

E V E N T S :  V E R B A L  G R O U P S

mess inside. The ice-cream from the freezer had melted and run down into the leftover 
fish sticks and cole slaw. The ice cream had gotten into the bowl of Spanish rice and 
pooled on the bottom of the fridge. Ice cream was everywhere.
An ‘extended’ Verbal Group structure consists of a lexical verb at the head, preceded 
by up to four auxiliaries – five if we include the lexical auxiliaries. The order in which 
the auxiliaries occur is fixed and depends upon the grammatical meanings they convey.
The auxiliaries serve to build up the meanings expressed by the modal, perfect, 
progressive and passive combinations, operating not in isolation but each telescoping 
with the next, as is explained shortly. In the following examples, we let has and is stand 
for any form of have and be, must for any of the modal auxiliaries and be about to for 
the set of lexical auxiliaries.
38.4  STRUCTURES WITH ONE GRAMMATICAL 
AUXILIARY: O V
In the finite VG with only one auxiliary, this auxiliary is necessarily the operator and, 
according to its type, selects a corresponding form of the lexical verb. The o v structure 
can express the following features of grammatical meaning, in addition to the obligatory 
choices of tense, finiteness, polarity and contrastiveness:
features
realisations
example
A
1
modal
modal aux.+ V-inf
must drive
B
2
perfect
have + V-en
has driven
C
3
progressive
be + V-ing
is driving
D
4
passive
be + V-en
is driven
And with a lexical auxiliary:
5
be + about to + V-inf is about to drive
The four basic combinations also combine with each other to make up more com­
plex Verbal Groups, all of which function as one VG at Finite + Predicator in clause
structure. The features modal, perfect, progressive, passive occur in ordered com­
binations, like the letters of the alphabet ABCD. Thus, for instance, B can follow A, or 
D can follow C, but not vice versa. A certain feature may be omitted, as in ACD, BD. 
Lexical auxiliaries can occur with any combination, as illustrated in the next section.

2 9 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
38.5  STRUCTURES WITH TWO GRAMMATICAL 
AUXILIARIES: O X V
  6	 modal + perfect

  7	 modal + progressive 	
must be driving
  8	 modal + passive 	
must be driven
  9	 perfect + progressive 	
has been driving
10	 perfect + passive 	
has been driven
In combination with a lexical auxiliary:
11	 modal + lexical-aux 	
must be about to drive
12	 perfect + lexical-aux 	
has been about to drive
13	 lexical-aux + progressive 	
is about to be driving
14	 lexical-aux + passive 	
is about to be driven
Structures with two auxiliaries occur widely in both spoken and written English. The 
following extract is adapted from a report about problems facing language-school 
students when they come to the UK to study English:
It must be realised 1 that many students will be going2 abroad for the first time and may 
well be likely to feel 3 anxious about the kind of reception they will be given,4 about the 
kind of work they are about to have to do5 or about the host family to which they happen 
to have been assigned.6 Many of these worries can easily be allayed7 by giving them as 
much information as possible beforehand. In the past, some students have been apt to 
complain8 that they have had to face9 certain difficulties in the first weeks owing to lack 
of sufficient information.

aux + lexical-aux; 6catenative (happen to) + perfect + passive; 7modal +passive; 8perfect

38.6  STRUCTURES WITH THREE GRAMMATICAL 
AUXILIARIES: O X X V
15	 modal + perfect + progressive 	
must have been driving
16	 modal + perfect + passive 	
must have been driven
17	 modal + progressive + passive 	
must be being driven
18	 perfect + progressive + passive 	 has been being driven
Verbal groups of three grammatical auxiliaries are more common in speech than in 
writing. With a modal or a lexical auxiliary, complex forms easily occur in spoken 
English, as in the following examples:

E V E N T S :  V E R B A L  G R O U P S  
2 9 7
 . . . and (they) think the killer could be being protected locally
[KIE]
The matter could and should have been dealt with as set out above
[FD6]
Groups with the two forms been being are uncommon, but they can occur if they are 
needed.
With a lexical auxiliary added there are now four auxiliaries:
19	 modal + perfect + lexical-aux 	
must have been about to drive
20	 modal + lex.-aux + progressive 	
must be about to be driving
21	 modal + lex.-aux + passive 	
must be about to be driven
22	 perfect + lex.-aux + progressive	 has been about to be driving
23	 perfect + lex.-aux + passive 	
has been about to be driven
24	 progressive + lex.-aux + passive	 is about to be being driven
Then his application would have to have been made to the Commission by March. 
[FBK] 
We will go no further with the structure of the finite extended VG, as no examples of 
five auxiliaries have been found in a large corpus. In principle, however, there is no 
grammatical constraint on their composition and the telescoped order of elements 
allows for their use if the context requires them.
38.7  TELESCOPED ORDER OF ELEMENTS OF THE 
VERBAL GROUP
It is important to note that each semantic-syntactic feature of a complex VG (tense and 
modality, perfect, progressive and passive) is expressed, not by one element only, but 
by each element telescoping into the following one: 
modality:	
must + V-inf
perfect:	
have + V-en
progressive:	
been + V-ing
passive:	
being + V-en
main verb:	
 driven
= Verbal Group:	 must	
have	
been	
being	
driven
(four grammatical auxiliaries)
With respect to the other auxiliaries, lexical auxiliaries have a relatively free ordering, 
the basic requirement being that they are followed by an infinitive. This blocks such 
combinations as *is likely to can drive and *is bound to must drive. However the meaning 
of must can be expressed by the lexical auxiliary have + to-infinitive, and of can by be 
able to, giving the acceptable combinations is likely to be able to drive and is bound to 
have to drive, as illustrated in the following spoken example:

2 9 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
If pain and other symptoms were being so badly managed these patients should have 
been referred promptly to other health care professionals who might have been able 
to provide a better quality of analgesia.
[FT2]
38.8  EXTENDED NON-FINITE STRUCTURES
Non-finite VGs do not possess the full set of sequences that we find in finite groups 
because they do not express the grammatical meanings of tense, mood or modality.
The perfect, progressive and passive meanings can, however, be expressed in the 
non-finite VG, giving the following possible combinations (the bracketed form is not 
common):
	
Infinitive structures	
Participle structures
25	 to have driven 	
having driven
26	 to have been driving 	
having been driving
27	 to have been driven 	
having been driven
28	 to be driving 	
(being driving)
29	 to be driven 	
being driven
Lexical auxiliaries can of course also be incorporated into non-finite structures, making 
for even longer combinations, which can be produced spontaneously when they are 
needed, as in the example:
Having been about to be operated on more than once, he was sent home without 
having had the operation.
With an appropriate lexical verb and an appropriate context, such as someone who 
is teaching needing extended time to complete an essay on a course she is following, 
the participial sequence of being + V-ing is acceptable, as in the following well-known 
example from Michael Halliday:
You might get an extension on the grounds of being teaching.
38.9  RELATIVE FREQUENCY OF COMPLEX VERBAL GROUPS
Extended VG structures have developed and become acceptable over time, and this 
process has not yet been completed. Even short progressive + passive combinations 
such as are being killed were avoided by writers before the second half of the nineteenth 
century. (Macaulay is said to have written ‘Good soldiers are killing. . .’ because he was 
reluctant to write ‘are being killed’.) There is still a certain reluctance to use the longer 
forms such as might have been being killed. The language’s resources, nevertheless, 
can generate them so that they are at the user’s disposal when they are needed. The 
reason that longer VGs occur more frequently in spoken English than in written lies 
partly in the on-line nature of spontaneous speech and the kind of meanings conveyed 
by the verbal group. Such meanings are related not simply to an objective point of 

E V E N T S :  V E R B A L  G R O U P S  
2 9 9
time at which an event occurred, but also more subjectively and spontaneously, to 
evaluations, speculations and predictions made by the speaker as to what may happen 
in the future or to what could, should or might have happened in the past.
38.10  DISCONTINUOUS VERBAL GROUPS
The sequence of elements in VGs is often interrupted by other clause elements, such 
as subject, adjunct and intensifiers as in has not yet been completed and were being so 
badly managed.. Such interruptions are seen in the following exchange, in which A asks 
B about her father, who is a wine dealer:
A.  Did he import1 from any particular place in France, or all over?
B.  Well, he used to sort of be2 forever going3 to Bordeaux, so I assumed from that that 
that was his main connection.
(adapted from J. Svartvik and R. Quirk, A Corpus of English Conversation)
1interrupted by Subject; 2interrupted by intensifier; 3interrupted by Adjunct
As well as in interrogative structures, separation of the VG by the subject is produced 
in certain types of thematisation (Only then did he realise the harm he had done; Had 
we known your address, we would have got in touch with you). This is explained 
in 28.10.
Discontinuity of the VG is also produced by negative or semi-negative items (I would 
never have believed that of him; You can hardly expect them to wait all day).

ORGANISING OUR EXPERIENCE	
UNIT 39
OF EVENTS	
SUMMARY
1 	 Verbal groups can be linked by coordination to express sequences of 
related events.
2 	 VGs in a dependency relationship are described by the semantic notion 
of catenation. They form chain-like sequences which symbolise a complex 
event (appear to understand).
3 	 The first VG is a catenative (appear, decline, fail, get, happen, tend, seem) 
and can express such meanings as manner, chance and usuality. The 
second verb is a to -infinitive. 
4 	 These catenatives are mid-way between lexical verbs and auxiliaries. They 
are not able to function as operators, and so require the do-operator.
5 	 These catenatives are not transitive and so do not occur in the passive. 
Voice can be expressed in the second verb: He seems to be widely known 
in the media.
We now begin to examine some of the means used in English to express the internal 
nature or character of the event for which the verb is a linguistic symbol.
39.1  CONJOINING AND CHAINING
39.1.1  Conjoining
Verbal groups can be joined, either by coordination or by dependency to express 
events which occur in sequence, or are ‘catenated’, respectively.
When linked by coordination, VGs are conjoined. They express two events with 
the same subject which occur in sequence and are semantically related (washed and 
dressed). Just as with the conjoining of other types of grammatical unit, the VGs may be 

E V E N T S :  V E R B A L  G R O U P S  
3 0 1
linked in three ways: by the linking words and, or and but; without any linking item; or 
by a combination of both when more than two events are related (→ Unit 32):
She washed and dressed the child.
Our last typist just left, disappeared without saying a word.
He was born, lived and died in Bristol.
39.1.2  Catenative verbs – appear to, happen to, seem to, 
tend to
In section 12.1 we considered verbs which can set up a chain of non-finite complements 
as catenatives, and the non-finite clauses themselves as catenative complements. Here 
we look at a largely different set of verbal groups which include the following: appear 
to, come to, fail to, get to, happen to, manage to, seem to and tend to. 
There are certain features which together distinguish them from other verbs:
1	
Similarity to modals: These verbs express meanings that are similar to certain 
modal or aspectual meanings of chance and usuality, achievement or comple­
tion. They have in common with the lexical auxiliaries the ability to form chained 
sequences of non finites as in Those pears don’t seem to be getting eaten. 
2	
Operators do and have: Syntactically, however, they behave like lexical verbs in 
that they use forms of do and have as operators (Did he come to realise the prob­
lems he would have to face? Have you ever happened to see a volcano in eruption?)
3	
A feature of these verbs is that they can be ‘dispensed with’ or removed without 
substantially affecting the meaning:
The other day, I happened to come across some old photos (or: I came across some 
old photos.) 
Children tend to dress and talk like TV characters they admire. (B. Bettelheim cited 
in the OED.) (or: Children dress and talk like TV characters they admire.)
The sky seemed to be getting darker. (or: The sky was getting darker.)
With those verbs that imply not fulfilling something that is usually or previously done, 
such as fail to, decline to, neglect to, cease to, the catenative can be replaced by a negative 
word or phrase; sometimes by a lexical item:
The alarm failed to go off. (The alarm didn’t go off.)
We neglected to lock up the house last night. (We didn’t lock up / We forgot to lock 
up . . . ) 
The Prime Minister declined to give an explanation. (didn’t give / refused to give . . . )
I have ceased to mind the harsh climate. (I no longer mind the harsh climate.)
Non-catenatives cannot be dispensed with in this way without changing the meaning. 
For instance, wish to in they wished to make lots of money is not equivalent to they 
made lots of money.

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R

Catenative verbs are not related to transitive structures even when there exists 
a corresponding transitive use, as is the case with neglect (the garden has been 
neglected) and decline (her invitation was politely declined). Consequently, cat­
enative verbs are not used with the passive. Passive voice can occur with the verb 
following the catenative, as in:
No-one appeared to realise the implications of the decision (active).
The implications of the decision appeared to be realised by no-one (passive).

The stranger turned out to be a neighbour – after all.
Manner or attitude: The manner in which a person performs an action and an atti­
tude of mind towards performing it are expressed by verbs such as decline to happen 
to; hasten to; hesitate to; regret to; venture to
I happen to like her a lot, so shut up = showing annoyance at something said.
I regret to inform you = inform with regret.
I hesitate to ask you this favour = ask reluctantly. 
They hastened to reassure her = reassure immediately.
No-one ventured to contradict him = dare to. 
May I venture to suggest a different direction? = suggest politely (formal).
Chance and tendency chance to; happen to; tend to
I chanced to overhear part of their conversation = heard by chance.
She happened to notice the number-plate = noticed by chance.
He tends to be nervous, doesn’t he? = often is

THE SEMANTICS OF	
UNIT 40
PHRASAL VERBS	
SUMMARY
1 	 Phrasal verbs consist of a lexical verb + an adverb-like particle (She 
walked out). The syntax of these verbs, as of other multi-word combinations, 
is described in Chapter 2.
2 	 The function of many of the particles is to modify the nature of the activity 
expressed by the verb. The result is an extended meaning which is often 
quite different from the meaning(s) of the verb when it functions alone.
3 	 The more transparent combinations combine the meaning of the verb and 
the particle, and these allow substitution (go out/run out/hurry out: go 
away/run away/hurry away.
4 	 In a Motion Event analysis the lexical verb in such combinations expresses 
Motion, while the particle expresses the Path taken by the moving Figure 
with respect to the Ground.
5 	 The notions of Manner and also Cause are typically incorporated, together 
with Motion, in English verbs.
6 	 Phrasal verb particles can also draw attention to the beginning or end of 
an activity, to its continuation, slow completion, increased or decreased 
intensity and many other meanings.
40.1  PHRASAL VERBS
No student of English can fail to notice that phrasal verbs are one of the most 
distinctive features of present-day informal English, both in their abundance and in 
their productivity. New combinations are constantly being coined. A phrasal verb is a 
combination of a lexical verb and an adverb-like particle such as run in, fly away, get off, 
walk back, drive past, come over. The syntactic behaviour of phrasal verbs is compared 
with that of prepositional verbs in 6.4.2, Chapter 2.

3 0 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
In this section we turn our attention to the combinations of meanings provided 
by the lexical verb together with its particle. The aim is to show how the concept of 
Motion Event offers a cognitive explanation for these combinations in English that 
should help to dispel the opaqueness often ascribed to phrasal verbs. (Only a small part 
can be presented here of what is a far-reaching model, which provides a typology of 
motion events across languages.)
The function of many of the particles is to modify the nature of the activity 
expressed by the verb. The result is an extended meaning which is often different from 
the meaning(s) of the verb when it functions alone.
40.1.1  Semantic cohesiveness and idiomaticity
Phrasal verbs are semantically highly cohesive. The verb and particle function as 
a whole, and the more idiomatic combinations frequently have a unique, idiomatic 
meaning which is not merely the sum of the two parts.
Other verb + particle combinations, however, present varying degrees of cohesive- 
ness and little or no idiomaticity. For practical purposes, the following three degrees 
will be recognised: non-idiomatic, semi-idiomatic and fully idiomatic. Each type 
will be dealt with separately.
40.2  NON-IDIOMATIC PHRASAL VERBS: FREE COMBINATIONS
The lexical verb and the adverbial particle each keep their own meaning, the sum of the 
meanings being one of movement + direction. The particle encodes the direction of 
the movement, while the lexical verb encodes the movement, as in:
The children went down to the beach.
40.2.1  The Motion Event: Figure, Ground, Path and Manner
It is here that the concept of Motion Event is revealing. The components in the Motion 
Event are Figure, Ground, Motion, and optionally, Path and Manner. Figure is the 
salient moving or stationary object in a motion event (we centre here on moving 
objects). In our previous example the children functions as Figure, while the beach 
serves as a point of reference or Ground with respect to which the Figure’s Path is 
conceptualised. Path refers to the one or more paths occupied by the Figure. In the 
example Path is fully expressed by the adverb-like particle down plus the preposition 
to. The lexical verb went expresses Motion.
Figure 	
Motion 	
Path 	
Ground
The children	
went	
down to 	
the beach.
	
ran	
	
	
walked	
	
In English the notion of Manner is easily incorporated together with Motion in the lexi­
cal verb, giving combinations such as ran down and walked down, which encode the 

E V E N T S :  V E R B A L  G R O U P S  
3 0 5
different ways in which the movement is carried out. Talk +down or + through are now 
being used to mean ‘effect an action, giving instructions by radio or internet’, as in the 
following true instance of a passenger taking over and landing the plane after the pilot 
suffered a heart attack:
The passenger flew over the airport a couple of times and was then talked down by 
two flight instructors. (The Guardian)
In this way, the manner of movement is integrated into the verbal group without the 
need to add an adverbial phrase or clause of manner.
Both Path and Manner are important components of phrasal verbs. In many clauses 
which express motion in English, the particle expressing Path can stand alone without 
the preposition, and also without the rest of the Ground, as in The children went down/ 
walked down. When the information in the Ground can be inferred from the context, 
it is conventionally omitted, as is the bracketed part in 1 and 2. In 3 the whole of the 
Ground is retained (back on the shelf):
1	
The bus stopped and we got on/got off (it, the bus).
2	
We turned off (the main road) down a side-road.
3	
Put all the books back on the shelf.
Non-literal uses of Path combinations may not admit this reduction of the Path 
component. Compare the literal use of into as in go into the house with the non-literal 
use as in go into (examine) the matter: They went into the house/They went in. They went 
into the matter/ *They went in.
While many adverb-particles have the same form as prepositions (get on/off the 
bus – get on/ off), the two categories are distinguished by certain features:
••
A preposition is unstressed or lightly stressed; a particle receives heavy stress, 
even when they have the same form: compare come to class vs come TO (= recover 
consciousness).
••
A preposition is followed by a nominal element (noun, pronoun, -ing clause), a 
particle does not need to be followed by anything cf. climb up the cliff vs climb up.
••
The category of particle includes words that don’t function as simple preposi­
tions: apart, together. Conversely, from and at are always prepositions, never 
particles; consequently, apart from and together with are complex prepositions 
(→ Chapter 12).
English admits multiple expressions of Path, which include both particles and a prepo­
sition, as in:
Paul ran back down into the garage.
In this very ordinary English sentence, a great deal of information has been packed in: 
that the manner of motion was by running (ran); that Paul was returning to the place 
where he had been before (back); that his starting-point was higher than the garage, 
so that he had to descend (down), and that he went inside the garage, which was an 

3 0 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
enclosed place (into). Note that, in a semantic roles analysis, the preposition (in)to is a 
marker of Goal, the final location after the movement (→ 59.2).
A further (optional) component of the Motion Event is Cause. This is incorporated 
into English verb roots such as blow and knock, while the particle encodes Path as 
usual:
The paper blew off the table.	
=	
The Figure (the paper) moves from the 
Ground (the table) (due to the air blowing 
on it)
I blew the crumbs off the table.	 =	
The Figure (the crumbs) moves from the 
Ground (the table) (due to my blowing on it)
He knocked the lamp over.	
=	
The Figure (the lamp) moves from a vertical 
position (on an unspecified Ground) to a 
horizontal one (due to his giving it a blow 
with his hand)
The causer is not necessarily expressed, and when it is, the cause may be deliberate 
or accidental.
40.2.2  Translating Motion, Manner and Path combinations
It is characteristic of everyday colloquial English, and of a number of other languages, 
to express Path by particles (+ preposition) and to combine Manner with Motion in 
the verb.
This is not so in the Romance languages, however. Spanish and French, for instance, 
have a different pattern. Let us take the sentence Paul ran back up into the attic. Spanish 
can combine Motion in the lexical verb with just one of the above components, either 
Manner alone (corrió = ran), or just one of the Path notions (subir = go up; entrar 
= go in, volver = go back, followed by a participle expressing Manner). The literal 
equivalents of these are not idiomatic English and should be avoided:
Pablo corrió al ático. 	
(‘Paul ran to the attic’)
Pablo volvió al ático corriendo. 	
(‘Paul went back to the attic running’)
Pablo subió al ático corriendo. 	
(‘Paul went up to the attic running’)
Pablo entró en el ático corriendo. 	
(‘Paul went into the attic running’)
To attempt to put in more would be awkward and stylistically unacceptable; even these 
versions are unnatural. For this reason, translators working from English to Spanish are 
obliged to under-translate, usually omitting Path or Manner meanings. Conversely, in 
translations from Spanish into English over-translation is common through the addition 
of Path or Manner meanings. In both cases the aim is to provide a natural text in the 
target language.
English phrasal and prepositional verbs often require to be translated into other 
languages by transposing the meanings of the verb and particle in the target language. 
For example, row across the lake can be translated into Spanish as cruzar el lago remando 
[literally cross the lake rowing]. The English particle across is translated as the main verb, 
cruzar, while the verb row is translated as a participle, remando. This process has been 

E V E N T S :  V E R B A L  G R O U P S  
3 0 7
called cross transposition. In this case the transposition was complete, since both 
verb and adverb were translated. In other cases, either the verb or the particle is better 
not expressed, being inferred, as in: A bird flew in: Entró un pájaro. The transposition is 
then ‘incomplete’ since the notion of flying has been omitted as not salient.
40.2.3  Substituting Manner and Path elements
The lexical verbs in non-idiomatic combinations are among the most frequently used 
English verbs, denoting basic movement, either with the whole body (go, carry, come, 
walk, etc.) or, more specifically, with part of the body (kick, hand, head, elbow, etc.), 
whereas others have very general or directional meanings (get, put, bring, take).
They combine with a wide variety of adverb-particles. Since they allow substitution, 
we can start from each lexical verb such as those below and make combinations with 
various particles. Obviously, other lexical verbs and other particles can be used. Not 
every lexical verb can combine with every particle. Here is a small selection:
take
up
down
in
out
off
back
away
go
up
down
in
out
off
back
away 
carry
up
down
in
out
off 
back
away
Take it up
Take it down
Take it in
Take it out
Take it off
Take it back
Take it away
Figure 8.3  Verbs and particles (phrasal verbs)
Alternatively, you can replace the basic lexical verb by a more specific verb of 
movement, while retaining the same adverbial particle. Instead of the basic go out, for 
instance, we can specify the manner of movement more exactly: walk out, run out, hurry 
out, rush out. With the notion of Cause added (= make come out), we have bring out, 
print out, squeeze out (You squeeze the toothpaste out like this). Such combinations have 
frequently developed a non-literal meaning, as in the following business news item:
More supermarkets opening in-store chemists could squeeze out High Street 
pharmacies.
40.3  BASIC MEANINGS OF A PARTICLE: BACK
A great deal of the opaqueness that learners find in phrasal verbs can be dispelled by 
acquiring a grasp of the basic meaning of each adverb-particle, together with some of 
the derived meanings. Take back, for instance. Back has two basic Path meanings.
First, back can represent a circular path in which the Figure ends up where it 
started. This is the one expressed by I’ll come back tomorrow, Put the books back on 
the shelves. The person or thing comes to be in the place or position where they were 
before, so that I’ll be back at 4.30 means ‘I’ll be again in this place where I am now’.
Close to the basic meaning is give back and pay back as in I’ll give/ pay you back the 
money tomorrow (that is, I’ll return the money to you tomorrow). By a short extension, 

3 0 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
we have the meaning of reciprocity ‘in return, in reply’ as in I’ll ring you back this evening. 
A metaphorical extension of pay back occurs as a threat in I’ll pay you back for this! 
Second, back can have the meaning ‘in the opposite direction to the one a 
person is facing’ as in:
stand back (intrans.):	
Stand back from the edge of the platform!
keep back (trans.):	
The police kept the crowd back as the royal car drew near.
This meaning is given a figurative extension in His illness has kept him back all this term. 
With this second meaning, the end-point is not the same as the initial point.
40.4  SEMI-IDIOMATIC PHRASAL VERBS
In semi-idiomatic combinations the lexical verb, generally speaking, keeps its literal or 
metaphorical meaning, while the particle is used as an aspectual marker of various 
kinds. By this we refer here to the way a particle with a verb in English can express 
the completion, beginning-point, end-point or high intensity of an event. Continuation, 
a kind of non-completion, can also be expressed. These notions are explained 
and discussed in Chapter 9 under the concepts of perfectivity and imperfectivity, 
respectively.
Aspect is seen here as the pattern of distribution through time of an action or state, 
and relates to such questions as its completion, beginning-point, end-point or high 
intensity, all kinds of perfectivity. Non-completion, which is a type of imperfectivity, 
can alternatively be expressed.
The following connotations of particles have been suggested:
  1	 beginning of an activity: doze off, switch on, start out
He sat in an armchair in front of the television and soon dozed off.
  2	 momentary character of an activity: cry out, sit down, wake up, stand up
Everyone cried out in fear when the boat capsized.
  3	 the bringing of an activity to an end or getting to a certain limit: eat up, 
catch up, drink up, fill up, heat up, mix up, use up, sweep up; count out, 
hear out, knock out, sort out, throw out, wear out; break off, call off, cut 
off, sell off, switch off
Heat up the milk but don’t let it boil over.
He hit the burglar so hard that he knocked him out.
The two countries have broken off diplomatic relations.
  4	 the slow completion of an activity: melt down, wind down, die away, fade 
away, melt away, pine away, waste away; chill out, peter out
The sound of thunder gradually died away/faded away.
We are all stressed out. Let’s go and have a drink to wind down/chill out.

E V E N T S :  V E R B A L  G R O U P S  
3 0 9
In phrasal verbs the notion of completion or bringing to an end is most clear in those 
cases in which there is a contrast with a single verb, as in use vs use up, eat vs eat up, 
drink vs drink up, knock vs knock out and so on. Compare I’ve used this detergent (i.e. 
some of this detergent) with I’ve used up this detergent (= there is none left); He knocked 
the burglar down the stairs with He knocked him out (= left him unconscious).
40.5  FULLY IDIOMATIC PHRASAL VERBS
Fully idiomatic combinations are those in which the meaning of the whole is not easily 
deduced from the parts, although it may well be deduced from the context:
  5	 the completion of an activity from beginning to end: read through, rush 
through, think through
I don’t think they have really thought the problem through.
  6	 reach a different, non-integral or denatured state: break up, burn up, tear up
Their marriage broke up.
She tore up the letter and threw the bits of paper into the fire.
  7	 the continuation or resumption of an activity: carry on, go on, keep on, 
work on, stay on, walk on
George carried on the family business.
The orchestra went on/kept on playing as the Titanic sank.
We stopped for a ten-minute break and then worked on until 7 o’clock.
  8	 the continuation of an activity with dedication or abandon: work away, 
chat away
They’ll sit gossiping away/chatting away happily for hours.
  9	 end of motion: settle down
Isn’t it time he got a job and settled down?
10	distribution: give out, share out
What are those leaflets that are being given out?
11	decreased intensity: slow down, die down
Slow down before you reach the crossing. The clamour finally died down.
12	mass character of an activity in progressive sequence: die off, kill off
All the rabbits have died off in this area. 
When winter arrives the cold kills off all the flies.
13	reciprocity of an activity: hit back
Tom hit Bill and he hit him back.

The illustrations given in these sections show that it is by no means easy to establish 
boundaries between what is idiomatic and what is not. Many verbs, both one-word 
and multi-word, have a number of related meanings according to their collocation with 
different nouns and depending on the contexts in which they are used. Particularly 
characteristic of phrasal verbs are their metaphorical extensions of meaning, from 
concrete to abstract or abstract to concrete; and from one context to another less 
typical one. A simple phrasal verb such as put up offers the following examples, among 
others:
The boys have put up the tent. (erect)
They’re putting up a new block of flats. (build) They’ve put the bus fares up. (raise)
I can put two of you up for a couple of nights. (provide a bed for)
The others will have to put up at a hotel. (lodge)
The project has been approved, but someone will have to put up the necessary 
funds. (provide)
Our neighbours have put their house up for sale. (announce, offer)
An illustration of the occurrence of complex and catenative VGs (together with lexical 
auxiliaries and phrasal verbs) in spoken English is provided by the following short 
extract from a recorded conversation:
Rachel:	
We got locked out1 of the flat yesterday. Harry: How did you get back2 in?
Rachel:	
We had to borrow3 a long ladder and climb up4 to the first floor balcony. 
Harry:	
I thought that with the kind of security lock you’ve got, you’re not supposed to 
be able to lock yourself out.5
Rachel:	
That’s true. But if you happen to bang6 the door a bit too hard, it locks itself. 
Harry:	
It’s better to have to lock7 it from the outside.

EXPRESSING LOCATION IN	
UNIT 41
TIME THROUGH THE VERB	
Tense
SUMMARY
1 	 Tense is the grammatical expression of the location of events in time. It 
anchors an event to the speaker’s experience of the world by relating the 
event time to a point of reference. The universal, unmarked reference point 
is the moment of speaking – speech time. In narrative, a point in past time 
is usually taken as the reference point.
2 	 English has two tenses, the present and the past, the past being the marked 
form, both morphologically and semantically.
3 	 The basic meaning of the present tense is to locate a situation holding at the 
present moment. This may be an instantaneous event (I promise to wait), a 
permanent state, a fact held as true (The law of gravity is universal), or an 
habitual occurrence (He works in an office). Secondary meanings of the 
Present include reference to past and future events, ‘historic present’ (This 
man comes up to me . . . ) and the quotative (and she goes/she’s like ‘I 
don’t believe it’).
4 	 The past tense primarily refers to a definite event or state that is prior to 
utterance time. Its secondary uses refer to a present event or state as hypo­
thetical (If I were you).
5 	 English has no verbal inflection to mark a future tense. Instead, English 
makes use of a number of forms to refer to future events.
6 	 Finite clauses in English can be marked for either tense or modality but not 
both. Verbs marked for tense are said to be ‘tensed’. Non-finite clauses are 
not tensed.

41.1 THE MEANING OF TENSE
Tense is the grammatical expression of the location of events in time. It anchors (or 
‘grounds’) an event to the speaker’s experience of the world by relating the event 
time to a point of reference. The normal, universal point of reference is the moment of 
speaking – speech time, what has been called ‘the inescapable and constantly chang­
ing now in which all verbal interaction takes place’. Past events take place before the 
‘now’, while future events are thought of as taking place after it.
The location of the speaker, the moment of speaking and the speaker her/himself 
make up ‘the I, the here and the now’- the ‘deictic centre’ – which serves as the point 
of reference for definiteness and proximity (→ Chapter 10). The ‘now’ can be dia­
grammed as shown.

41.1.1  Present tense, Past tense and future time
Tense is a grammatical category that is realised in English morphologically on the 
verb. In accordance with this criterion, English has just two tenses: the Present and 
the Past, as in goes/went, respectively. English has no verbal inflection to mark a 
future tense. The forms shall and will are not verbal inflections but modal auxiliaries 
which, when reduced, are attached to pronouns, not to the verb root (I’ll wait out­
side). Also important are the form–meaning relationships. Shall and will belong to 
a set of modal auxiliaries and can express meanings other than reference to future 
time, as we shall see later in this chapter (→ 44.1). Instead of a future tense, English 
makes use of a number of combinations such as be going to to refer to future events
(→ 41.6). Compare:
They do the shopping on Saturdays. (present tense)
They did the shopping on Saturday. (past tense)
They are going to do/will do the shopping on Saturday. (lexical auxiliary/modal)

3 1 9
In English, therefore, the three-term semantic distinction between past, present and 
future time is grammaticalised as a two-term tense distinction between Past tense and 
Present tense.
Besides tensed forms of verbs, adverbs of time such as now, then, tomorrow, PPs 
such as in 1066 and lexico-grammatical expressions such as ten minutes after the plane 
took off can make reference to time. English, in fact, relies to a considerable extent on 
such units to make the temporal reference clear.
The Past tense in English is the marked form. Morphologically, the vast majority of 
verbs in English have a distinctive past form, (played, saw, flew) and, semantically, the 
past tense basically refers to a situation that is prior to the present, as in Yesterday was 
fine. Cognitively, the situations conceptualised by the speaker as past have the status 
of known, but not immediate, reality; they are not currently observed. 
The Present tense is the unmarked tense. Morphologically, it uses mainly the base 
form. It is marked only on the 3rd person singular (with the exception of be, which has 
three forms (am, are and is). Semantically, it covers a wider range of temporal refer­
ences than the Past tense, including reference to future time (Tomorrow is a holiday). 
Cognitively, it expresses situations which have immediate reality, that is, what is cur­
rently observed.
Even in our everyday use, ‘at present’ and ‘at the present time’ have a wider appli­
cation than simply to the present moment of speech time. The present tense refers to 
general or permanent situations, facts and truths, which hold not only at the present 
time but have also held in the past, and will conceivably continue to hold in the future.
41.1.2  Stative and dynamic uses of verbs
The meaning expressed by a verb in present or past tense depends to a great extent on 
whether the verb refers to a single constant state, as in I know Tim’s email address, or to 
a dynamic occurrence, as in He goes to work by train.
More exactly, the meaning depends on whether the verb is being used statively or 
dynamically, since many verbs lend themselves to both interpretations. ‘Have’ usually 
refers to a permanent state, as in cats have sharp claws, but it also has dynamic uses as 
in have breakfast.

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
In general, dynamic but not stative senses can occur with the imperative and pro­
gressive, and after do in wh-cleft sentences:
Have breakfast! 	
We are having breakfast. 	
What we did was have breakfast.
*Have claws!	
*Cats are having claws	
*What cats do is have claws.
In the following sections, we refer to the present tense as the ‘simple Present’, more 
exactly as the ‘non-progressive Present’. The Progressive, consisting of a form of 
be + -ing, combines with tense to encode a single event observed in the process of 
happening. There is a meaningful distinction – and an obligatory choice in English – 
between expressing a situation by means of the Present tense alone and expressing it 
by the Present Progressive. Compare:
The sun doesn’t shine every day in Brussels, (non-Progressive Present)
but it is shining today. (Progressive Present)
41.2  BASIC MEANINGS OF THE PRESENT TENSE
The basic meaning of the Present tense is to locate a situation holding at the present 
moment. The tense itself does not say whether that same situation continues beyond 
the present moment and whether it also held in the past. These are implications which 
we derive from our knowledge of the world and from the type of situation encoded in 
the clause.
In fact it is relatively rare for a situation to coincide exactly with the present moment, 
that is, to occupy a single point in time, literally or conceptually. Situations of this 
nature do occur, however and can be classed together as types of the Instantaneous 
Present.
41.2.1  The Instantaneous Present
These are events which coincide, or are presented as coinciding, with speech time and 
have no duration beyond speech time:
Speech act verbs which perform the act they name: I’ll be careful, I promise.
(→ 25.1)
Exclamations with initial directional adverb: Off they go! (at the start of a race)
In you get! (helping someone to get in a car, etc.)
Commentaries: Jones passes and Beckham kicks the ball into the net.
Demonstrations: I place the fruit in the blender, press gently, and then pour out the 
liquid.
More characteristically, the Present is used to refer to situations which occupy a longer 
period of time than the moment of speaking, but which nonetheless include speech 
time. Traditionally these situations are classed according to the verb as stative uses 
and habitual uses of the Present.

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y  
3 2 1
41.2.2  The State Present
Used with stative verb senses, the Present refers to a single uninterrupted state, which 
began before the moment of speaking and may well continue after it. They include 
facts, general statements and timeless statements, that is, statements which apply 
to all time, including speech time:
The law of gravity is universal
They also include states whose time span is not endless, e.g. know, think, believe, belong, 
stand for. They are nevertheless states in which no change or limitation into the past or 
future is implied. Here too the temporal reference includes speech time.
I think you are right.
MP stands for Member of Parliament.
41.2.3  The Habitual Present
This is used with dynamic verbs to encode situations that occur habitually over time, 
even if the action is not being carried out at the moment of speaking. For instance, 
referring to the following examples, Tim may not actually be working, nor the leaves 
falling at the moment of speaking. Nevertheless, the recurrent situation holds as the 
normal course of things and is appropriately referred to by the simple Present tense.
Tim works in an insurance company.
Many trees lose their leaves in autumn.
Again, the simple Present used for habitual and other meanings contrasts with the 
Present Progressive, which encodes an actual occurrence of a dynamic action observed 
in the process of happening, as in The trees are already losing their leaves (→ 43.4–43.7).
41.3  SECONDARY MEANINGS OF THE PRESENT TENSE: 
REFERENCE TO PAST EVENTS
The Present can be used to refer to past events in certain limited ways.
In newspaper headlines and captions to photographs
Thousands flee persecution.
Demonstrators clash with armed police as violence increases.
In relating incidents in informal, casual speech: the historic present and the quotative
He was only an average athlete, and then suddenly he wins two Olympic medals.
I had just left the bank when this guy comes up to me and asks for money.

3 2 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
The Present tense in headlines and the sudden switch from Past to Present in speech 
have the effect of dramatising the event, bringing it before the reader’s eyes as if it were 
an instance of the instantaneous Present. However, the headline stands apart from the 
text, while the ‘historic present’ switch occurs within the discourse at a key point 
in the narrative, and is frequently paralleled by a switch to a proximal demonstrative 
(this), as in the example: this guy comes up.
Go and be like are used by young speakers talking among themselves, as quotative verbs 
like say, to introduce direct speech as in: ‘and she goes “What’s he like?” and I’m like “Gorgeous”.’ 
They usually occur in the Present tense. These verbs are not used in this way by all speakers.
In reporting information 
With verbs of communicating (say, tell) and of perception (see, hear, understand) the use 
of the Present implies that the reported information is still valid, even though the com­
municative process took place in the past. With a Past tense, the validity is not implied: 
The weather forecast says that rain is on the way.
I understand you would like to move to London. 
In subordinate clauses of time and condition 
The present tense is usual in open conditions and in clauses introduced by when, as 
soon as, the minute etc., with a potential (irrealis) meaning, where certain languages 
require a subjunctive (→ Unit 34.3) as in: Text me when you get here. 
The following short extract illustrates the basic meanings of the Present tense in 
contrast to that of the past tense. This extract is taken from The Corpus of Contemporary 
American English (COCA):450 million words, 1990–present. Available online at http://
corpus.byu.edu/coca (Davies 2008–).
Yes, it’s the journey that counts. But every trip is better with fast, delicious food like this. 
Around day four of any backpacking trip, the thought of another freezedried pasta dish 
sounds as appealing as a few fresh blisters. Which is why, after a ten-mile hike along a 
dusty dirt road in Chile that followed a 5,000-plus-foot descent at the end of our volcano 
trek – we were thrilled to have saved this curry dish for the end. The smell of coconut milk 
and curry alone was enough to give us a lift. Then the texture of the al dente Israeli cous­
cous woke up tired taste buds. And the combination of chicken (not tough and chewy) and 
peas (not mushy) in the coconut-curry sauce caused camp chaos: Was there enough to go 
round? And could we make another batch fast? Thankfully the make lives up to its name. 
[COCA: MAG] 
41.4  BASIC MEANINGS OF THE PAST TENSE 
The basic meaning of the Past tense in English is to locate an event or state in the past. 
It situates the event at a ‘temporal distance’ from the moment of speaking, whether in 

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y  
3 2 3
time, towards the past, or with regard to potential or hypothetical events which have 
not yet occurred in the present or the future.
When used to refer to a definite past event or state, the Past in English contains two 
semantic features: 
••
The speaker conceptualises the event as having occurred at some specific time in 
the past.
••
The event is presented as wholly located in the past, in a time-frame that is sepa­
rated by a gap from the present. 
These features are illustrated in the following examples: 
James Joyce was born in Dublin in 1882.
He lived in Ireland until 1904 and spent the rest of his life abroad. 
The Past tense in English says nothing about whether the event occupied a point in 
time or a longer extent. These additional meanings are understood from the lexical 
verb used and from the whole situation represented by the clause. In the examples 
above referring to one single person, was born is interpreted as referring to a point in 
time, while lived and spent are interpreted as being of longer duration. With a plural 
subject, the Past tense were born is interpreted here as referring not to one single point 
in time but to many: 
Generations of writers were born who were influenced by Joyce.
In using the Past tense, speakers do not need to specify a past occurrence by means 
of an Adjunct, however. As long as the speaker has a specific time in mind and can 
assume that the hearer infers this from the situational context, the Past tense is used, 
as in:
Did you see that flash of lightning?
 [Who said that?] It wasn’t me.
41.5  SECONDARY MEANINGS OF THE PAST TENSE: PRESENT 
AND FUTURE REFERENCE 
The Past tense can refer to time-frames other than the past in the following three ways:
••
In ‘closed conditionals’ (→ 34.3) and other hypothetical subordinate 
clauses which express a counterfactual belief or presupposition on the part of 
the speaker. The reference is to present time. The past in such expressions was 
originally a subjunctive whose only relic remains in the form were for all persons 
of be. 
If we had enough time . . . 	
(presupposes we haven’t enough time) 
He talks as if he owned the place. 	
(he doesn’t own the place)
 I often wish I were somewhere else. 	
(I am not somewhere else) 

3 2 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
••
In reported speech or thought: after a reporting verb in the Past tense, the 
reported verbs in the dependent clauses are also in the Past. This phenomenon is 
known as ‘backshift’ (→ 36.3). Present tense forms are optional, as in She said she 
prefers/preferred vanilla ice cream, as long as the situation is still valid.
••
In polite requests and enquiries, the past form ‘distances’ the proposed action, 
so making the imposition on the hearer less direct: 
Did you want to speak to me now?
I wondered whether you needed anything.
41.6  REFERRING TO FUTURE EVENTS 
We cannot refer to future events as facts, as we can to past and present situations, 
since future events are not open to observation or memory. We can predict with 
more or less confidence what will happen, we can plan for events to take place, 
express our intentions and promises with regard to future events. These are modal­
ised rather than factual statements, and are treated in 44.3. Here we simply outline 
the main syntactic means of referring to future events as seen from the standpoint 
of present time.
41.6.1  ‘Safe’ predictions 
These are predictions which do not involve the subject’s volition, and include cyclical 
events and general truths. Will + infinitive is used, shall by some speakers for ‘I’ and 
‘we’:
Susie will be nineteen tomorrow.
You’ll find petrol more expensive in France.
Will/shall + progressive combine the meaning of futurity with that of focusing on the 
internal process, in this way avoiding the implication of promise associated with will 
when the subject is ‘I’ or ‘we’. Compare: 
I will (I’ll) speak to him about your application tomorrow. We shall (we’ll) be 
studying your application shortly.
41.6.2  Programmed events 
Future events seen as certain because they are unalterable 1 or programmed 2, 3 and 
4 can be expressed by the Present tense + time adjunct, by will or by the lexical auxil­
iaries be due to + infinitive and be to (simple forms only): 
1 	 The sun sets at 20.15 hours tomorrow.
2 	 Next year’s conference will be held in Milan. 
3	
He is due to retire in two months’ time.
4 	 She is to marry the future heir to the throne.

3 2 5
41.6.3  Intended events 
Intended events can be expressed by be + going to + infinitive 1 and by the Progressive 
(be + -ing) 2. These forms can be marked for tense. The past forms refer to an event 
intended at some time in the past to occur in some future time 3. As with all intended 
events, they may or may not actually take place. (→ modal will, 44.6.)
1 	 I am going to get more information about this.
2 	 Pete is thinking of learning Chinese.
3 	 I was going to leave a note but there was no-one at Reception. [BMR] 
41.6.4  Imminent events 
An event seen as occurring in the immediate future is expressed by be + going to or 
by combinations such as: be about to + infinitive, be on the point of/be on the verge of + 
-ing. There is usually some external or internal sign of the imminence of the happening.
In AmE ‘gonna’ is the usual abbreviation of ‘going to’ in spoken English. 
We’re not gonna stand for this. 
This company is about to be/on the verge of being taken over by a multinational.
An expectation orientated to past time is expressed by the corresponding forms in the 
past:
It’s not what I thought it was going to be.
. . . the territory which was later to be part of Lithuania.
41.6.5 Future anterior events 
A future event anterior to another event is expressed by the Future Perfect: 
The programme will have ended long before we get back. By the time he is twenty-
two, he’ll have taken his degree.
Otherwise, the Future Perfect expresses the duration or repetition of an event in the 
future. The addition of the Progressive emphasises the incompletion of the sequence 
(→ 43.4): 
We’ll have lived here for ten years by next July.
We’ll have been living here for ten years by next July.

PAST EVENTS AND PRESENT	
UNIT 42
TIME CONNECTED	
Present Perfect and Past Perfect 
SUMMARY 
1 	 Both tense and aspect have to do with time relations expressed by the verb, 
but from different perspectives. While tense basically situates an event or 
state in present or past time, aspect is concerned with such notions as dura­
tion and completion or incompletion of the process expressed by the verb. 
English has two aspects, the Perfect and the Progressive. We first consider 
the Perfect aspect, noticing how it differs from the simple tenses. In Unit 
43, we go on to consider the Progressive aspect.
2 	 The Present Perfect is a retrospective tense-aspect which views a state 
or event as occurring at some indefinite time within a time-frame that leads 
up to speech time.
3 	 The event is viewed as psychologically relevant to the present. By contrast, 
an event encoded in the Past tense is viewed as disconnected from the 
present.
4 	 Consequently, the Perfect is not normally interchangeable in BrE with the 
Past tense. For the same reason, the time adjuncts accompanying them are 
normally different. In AmE, but not BrE, the Past tense is often used, with the 
adverbs already or just (I just got up) where BrE uses the Perfect. 
5 	 Implications of recency, completion and result, derived from the combina­
tion of Present Perfect and verb type, are all manifestations of current 
relevance.
6 	 The Past Perfect is used to refer to events more remote than, previous or 
relevant to those expressed by a past tense, but is also used in backshift 
and with a counterfactual meaning.
42.1  PRESENT PERFECT ASPECT AND PAST TENSE
COMPARED: ANTERIORITY VS DEFINITE TIME 
The Perfect construction in English relates a state or event to a relevance time. This 
is speech time for the Present Perfect, some point in time prior to speech time for the 
Past Perfect and some point in time after speech time for the Future Perfect.

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y  
3 2 7
The Present Perfect is a subtle retrospective tense-aspect which views states or 
events as occurring in a time-frame leading up to speech time. Expressed by have + 
past participle, the have element is present, the participle is past. The event is psycho­
logically connected to the present as in the following example:
________________________________________speech time
His marriage has broken down and he has gone to live in another part of England
These and other features contrast with those of the Past tense: 
Present Perfect
Past Tense
a.	 Its time-frame is the extended now, a 
period of time which extends up to speech 
time.
Its time-frame is the past, which is viewed 
as a separate time-frame from that of the 
present.
b.	The event occurs at some indefinite and 
unspecified time within the extended 
now. The Perfect is non- deictic – it 
doesn’t ‘point’ to a specific time but 
relates to a relevant time.
The event is located at a specific and 
definite time in the past.
The Past tense is deictic – it points to a 
specific time in the past.
c.	 The event has ‘current relevance’, 
that is, it is viewed as psychologically 
connected to the moment of speaking.
The event is seen as psychologically 
disconnected from the moment of 
speaking.
Figure 9.3  The Present Perfect and the Past tense.
Within the extended now, the Present Perfect is used in English when the speaker 
wishes to refer, not to a definite moment of occurrence of the event, but simply to the 
anteriority of the event. This is in marked contrast with the definite time use of the 
Past tense. Compare:
They have left for New York.
They left for New York an hour ago.
Similarly, the Present Perfect is not normally used in main clauses with interrogative 
adverbs, which imply definite time and require the Past tense.
We can say
Have they started?
Have they finished? (Present Perfect)
Or
When did they start?
At what time did they finish?
(Past tense)
But not
*When have they started?
*At what time have they finished?

3 2 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
When a definite time is not implied by the verb the Present Perfect is possible: 
Where have you most enjoyed working?	
[BNA] 
In subordinate clauses, with future reference, the Present Perfect can follow when, 
since this use refers to an unspecified time: When I have finished, I’ll call you.
Furthermore, the Present Perfect operates in a time-frame that is still open, blocking 
examples such as 1a and 2a. By contrast the b examples are grammatical, as are 3 and 4:
1a	 *James Joyce has been born in Dublin. 	 1b James Joyce was born in Dublin.
2a	 *He has lived in Ireland until 1904. 	
2b He lived in Ireland until 1904.
3 	 Michael has lived in Ireland all his life (implying that he still lives there).
4 	 Generations of writers have been influenced by Joyce (and are still influenced).
In 1a and 2a the Perfect is blocked because Joyce’s life-span is over. In 3 this is not the 
case. In 4 the plural subject ‘generations of writers’ allows for a time-frame that is open.
The perspective of the ‘extended now’ time-frame in contrast with that of the Past 
tense is illustrated in this passage from Penelope Lively’s Moon Tiger:
I’ve grown old with the century; there’s not much left of either of us. The century of war. 
All history, of course, is the history of wars, but this hundred years has excelled itself. 
How many million shot, maimed, burned, frozen, starved, drowned? God only knows. 
I trust He does; He should have kept a record, if only for His own purposes. I’ve been 
on the fringes of two wars; I shan’t see the next. The first preoccupied me not at all; 
this thing called War summoned Father and took him away for ever. I saw it as some 
inevitable climatic effect: thunderstorm or blizzard. The second lapped me up but spat 
me out intact. Technically intact. I have seen war; in that sense I have been present at 
wars, I have heard bombs and guns and observed their effects. 
42.2 TIME ADJUNCTS AND THE PRESENT PERFECT ASPECT 
The Present Perfect aspect is frequently accompanied by time Adjuncts that refer to a 
period of time that is still open at the moment of speaking, e.g. this week, this month, this 
year, etc. Adjuncts which refer to a period of past time that is now over (e.g. last month, 
last year, yesterday, ago) are incompatible with the Perfect. Compare: 
Have you seen any good films this month?	
*Have you seen any good films last 
month 
A period of time expressed by an adjunct such as in July is either open or closed 
depending on the speaker’s vantage-point. If closed, the verb is in the Past tense: 
Temperatures have reached an all-time high in July. (July is not yet over) 
Temperatures reached an all-time high in July. (July is over)

Adjuncts of indefinite or unspecified 
time used with the Perfect, such as:
Adjuncts of definite or specific time 
used with past tense, such as:
sometimes, often, always, ever, at times
twice, three times
in the last ten years
lately, recently, now, to date, so far 
yesterday
last week, last year, last month
an hour ago,
two years ago last June, in 1066
at 4 o’clock, at Christmas, at Easter
Figure 9.4  Adjuncts of indefinite time and adjuncts of definite time.
42.3  CURRENT RELEVANCE 
By ‘current relevance’ we mean that the event referred to by means of the Present 
Perfect is psychologically connected to speech time, and has some (implicit) relevance 
to it.
This meaning is quoted in all accounts of the present perfect and is considered by 
some to be the main one. It is undoubtedly of the utmost importance. Nevertheless, 
current relevance will here be considered as a pragmatic implication deriving from the 
combination of time-frame, perfect aspect and verb type. This will become clear as we 
turn to the interpretations of the perfect in discourse.
At this point the notion of current relevance is essential: They have been out implies 
that they have now come back, whereas They went out has no such implication. It 
would not be normal to say *They have been out a moment ago (since an adjunct such 
as ‘a moment ago’ visualises a definite point of time in the past, whereas the Perfect 
does not).
Occasional occurrences in spoken English of forms which appear to combine the 
two can be explained as mental switches from an indefinite to a definite time-frame 
produced as speakers modify their messages as they go along. Regional variation may 
also be a factor.
42.4  FUNCTIONS AND DISCOURSE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE 
PRESENT PERFECT 
Interpretations of the functions of the Perfect are described under certain well-known 
labels, as follows.
42.4.1  The experiential Perfect 
This refers to the fact that there have been one or more experiences of the event in 
the recent history 1 and 2, or in the life-span 3 of a certain person up to the present 
time, as in:

3 3 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
1 	 I’ve been ill.
2 	 Jim’s been away.
3 	 You’ve lived in Brighton, and you’ve lived in Kingston and now you live in 
Lewes. [KRG] 
Included in this type is the first-time experience use, as in It’s the first time I’ve been 
here, for which certain languages use a Present tense.
Another is the contrast between the one-way have gone to and the cyclic have 
been to, as in:
Jim has gone to England 	
= 	
he’s still there
Jim has been to England 	
= 	
he has returned after a visit to England
This explains the anomalous *I’ve gone to England, and the fact that I’ve been to England 
several times is normal, whereas *I’ve gone to England several times is odd.
42.4.2  The continuous Perfect 
This is a state, duration or repeated occurrence of a process such as walk, lasting up 
to speech time. An adjunct of extent is virtually necessary to complete the meaning.
I have known Bill since we were at school together. (i.e. and I still know him) 
We have walked for hours. (up to the present moment)
For the last ten years he has lived and worked in Brussels. (i.e. He still does)
Over the last three years the pressure group has staged a number of hunger strikes.
For and over + a unit of time (for hours, over the last three years) express the duration of 
the event from the vantage point of speech time, and this form is retrospective. Since + a 
point of time expresses extent viewed from the initiation of the event, and is prospective.
42.4.3  Implied meanings of the Present Perfect 
Deriving from the features and main uses of the present perfect, certain implications are 
associated with it, especially in BrE. These are recency, completion and resulting state.
Recency 
The Present Perfect lends itself to a ‘hot news’ interpretation, which can be reinforced 
by just. In AmE the Past is used.
The Prime Minister has resigned.
He’s done it! (played the winning ball in a golf tournament) (sports commentary) 
We’ve just eaten/had lunch (BrE) We just /already ate. (AmE)
Have you been up long? (BrE) You been up long? (AmE) (ellipsis of have)
No, I’ve just got up (BrE) 	
No, I just got up.(AmE)
What on earth have you done to your hair? (BrE)
What on earth did you do to your hair?( AmE) 

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y  
3 3 1
Completion 
This is the pragmatic implication arising from the combination of the Perfect with pro­
cesses having an end-point (→ 43.2), as in grow up, tape something: 
Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes, which have been 
burnt to rubble. (news)
His brothers have grown up and have left home.
You can listen to what you’ve taped. Oh yeah, you can play it back. [KCL] 
Resulting state 
Such situations with the Perfect are in many cases interpreted as having a visible result 
as in:
Their homes have been burnt to rubble.
You’ve squashed my shoe! (The shoe is in a squashed state)	
[KPO] 
The result may be knowledge or know-how, as implied in He has learned to drive. These 
are all forms of current relevance. 
42.5  THE PAST PERFECT 
The Past Perfect consists of two elements of past time: the auxiliary had and a past 
participle. It is used to refer to a past event or state that is anterior to or parallel with a 
time of orientation in the past: 
In 1962 the world had come to the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban missile 
crisis. (Andrew Marr, A History of Modern Britain) 
The film had already started by the time we reached the cinema. 
He opened the door. The flowers he had bought for Jane were strewn all over the 
floor. 
Parallel to the time-frame of the Present Perfect which leads up to speech time, or ‘time 
now’, the time-frame of the Past Perfect leads up to a point in the past, or ‘time then’ 
(In 1962, the time we reached the cinema, he opened the door. The reader infers ‘he saw’ 
the flowers). 
42.5.1  Discourse interpretations of the Past Perfect 
(a)	 Duration of states 
The continuous Past Perfect expresses the duration of a state up to ‘time then’: 
	
He realised he had left the book he had been reading on his seat in the 
train. 

3 3 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
(b)	 Modal remoteness 
The Past Perfect is similar to the simple past tense in that they can both express modal 
remoteness. This is not past time, but a hypothetical or counter-factual meaning. This 
occurs in the complement of the verb wish: 
(i)	 I wish she had told me the truth (She did not tell me the truth). 
AmE sometimes prefers the form would instead of the Past Perfect: 
I wish she would have told me the truth. This is ungrammatical in BrE. 
The other use is the counterfactual conditional:
(ii)	 If only they had realised a hurricane was imminent, they might have run to 
safety (They did not realise). (→ 34.3, 43.3 and 44) 
In hypothetical conditional sentences such as this, the past perfect can occur only in 
the conditional (if-clause), not in the main clause. A further variant is as follows: 
Had Britain been involved from the start as even the French wanted, the EEC, 
eventually the EC, would have developed differently. (A History of Modern Britain) 
(c) Backshift in reporting 
The third function that the past perfect shares with the past tense is that of backshift 
when the reporting verb is in the past. This may be a verb of perception: 
One could see he had aged considerably. 
Sheila said they had had a puncture and would probably be late. 
d) Stressed had 
The past perfect auxiliary had is often stressed in speech when the speaker is referring 
to a previous situation that no longer holds: 
We had planned to go to the New Delhi conference, but we’ve had to give up the 
idea.
As the Past Perfect refers to a time previous to a time signalled somewhere else in the 
context, it is not always easy to determine its time reference. For this reason, the Past 
Perfect often occurs in subordinate clauses accompanied by time Adjuncts, both of 
which help to establish the temporal links between events. The following extract from 
Raymond Carver illustrates uses of the Past Perfect:

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y  
3 3 3
It was just past six o’clock. Myers hadn’t slept since he’d boarded the train in Milan 
at eleven the night before. When the train had left Milan, he’d considered himself 
lucky to have the compartment to himself. He kept the light on and looked at 
guidebooks. He read things he wished he’d read before he’d been to the place they 
were about. He discovered much that he should have seen and done. In a way, he 
was sorry to be finding out certain things about the country now, just as he was 
leaving Italy behind after his first and, no doubt, last visit.
42.6 NON-FINITE PERFECT FORMS 
The distinction between present and past does not apply to non-finite verb phrases. 
The non-finite Perfect forms to have + participle and having + participle have the gen­
eral meaning of anteriority and serve as secondary tenses of both Present and Past 
Perfect:
Having satisfied himself that everything was in order, he locked the safe.
She was said to have been the foremost opera singer of her time. 

SITUATION TYPES AND THE	
UNIT 43 
PROGRESSIVE ASPECT	
SUMMARY 
1 	 Important aspectual contrasts include perfectivity (viewing the event as a 
whole) vs imperfectivity (viewing the event as incomplete). These distinc­
tions remain indeterminate in English in the simple Past and Present tense 
forms. Perfectivity then must be interpreted from the whole clause.
2 	 The only grammaticalised aspectual contrasts in English are the Progressive 
vs non-progressive and the Perfect vs non-perfect. (The Perfect is not identi­
cal to perfectivity!)
3 	 Progressiveness is a type of imperfectivity which focuses on the continuous­
ness of the internal part of the event. Another type, that of past habituality, 
is expressed by the lexical auxiliary used to + inf.
4 	 Situations (and verbs) can be classed according to their inherent aspectual 
meaning as states (with no internal change: It’s hot), as punctual occur­
rences (the cable snapped), as durative occurrences without an end-point: 
we walked along (activities) and as durative with an end-point: we walked 
home (accomplishments).
5 	 The Progressive and Perfect aspects add their communicative perspectives 
to the inherent aspectual meaning of the verb. Other factors to be taken 
into account, in order to understand the aspectuality of a particular verbal­
ised situation, are the single or multiple nature of the subject and object, 
and the presence of Adjuncts. 
43.1 	 THE MEANING OF ASPECT 
While tense is used to locate events in time, aspect is concerned with the way in which 
the event is viewed with regard to such considerations as duration and completion
when encoded by a verb. This is sometimes defined as the internal temporal con­
tour of the event. Compare, for instance, the following representations of a situation:
1a  He locked the safe.          1b  He was locking the safe.

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y  
3 3 5
As regards tense, both are the same – the Past. They both locate the situation in past time. 
The difference is one of aspect, expressed by the verbal form was locking as opposed to the 
ordinary past locked. What we have is a difference of viewpoint and of focus of attention.
A basic aspectual distinction is that of perfectivity vs imperfectivity:
••
Perfective: the situation is presented as a complete whole, as if viewed externally, 
with sharp boundaries, as in 1a. (Note that perfectivity is not the Perfect aspect!)
••
Imperfective: the situation is viewed as an internal stage, without boundaries and is 
conceptualised as ongoing and incomplete; the beginning and end aren’t included 
in this viewpoint – we see only the internal part, as in 1b. The Progressive is thus 
a kind of imperfectivity. 
In many languages the perfective/imperfective pairs are related morphologically. 
Having fewer aspectual inflections, English has fewer grammaticalised aspectual 
choices than some languages. Take for instance the following examples containing the 
verb speak, together with their Spanish counterparts: 
2a	 He stopped and spoke to me in English.	
(Spanish habló)
2b	 He spoke English with a Welsh accent. 	
(Spanish hablaba) 
The Past tense in English does not distinguish formally between the single event rep­
resented in 2a, whose counterpart in Spanish is marked as perfective (habló), and the 
habitual event represented in 2b, which is marked as imperfective in Spanish (hablaba).
In other words, the Past tense in English is indeterminate between a perfective 
and an imperfective interpretation. This distinction is captured inferentially by speak­
ers according to the relevance of one meaning or other within a context, but is not 
grammaticalised.
43.2  LEXICAL ASPECT OF ENGLISH VERBS 
Before examining the second grammatical aspect available to speakers of English, 
the Progressive, we turn for a moment to lexical aspect. All verbs (and predicates) 
have an inherent lexical aspect. We have touched on this concept in outlining the sta­
tive vs dynamic distinction, verbal groups and the behaviour of particles in phrasal 
verbs.
Lexical aspect proves to be an invaluable tool for understanding the functioning of 
the Progressive and the Perfect aspects. In fact, it is not easy to grasp the contribution 
made by the grammatical aspects without realising how they interact with the lexical 
aspect of the verb. In taking a little further the stative–dynamic distinction, we will now 
be considering whole situations to which the verb brings its own inherent aspectuality, 
in terms of two factors: 
••
temporal boundaries: whether the situation is bounded (i.e. has an end-point) or 
unbounded (has no end-point)
••
duration or non-duration (through time) 
The diagram illustrates the main situation types. 

3 3 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Reading from left to right in the diagram, situations can be classified as follows: 
1 	 States vs Occurrences. States have relatively long duration but do not have 
boundaries: they are unbounded, as with verbs such as be, stand (The house stands 
on a hill). Occurrences are dynamic and more complex. They are subdivided 
according to duration into:
2 	 Processes vs punctual occurrences. Processes are durative, they last through 
time, while punctual occurrences occupy little or no appreciable time and have 
sharp boundaries, e.g. the cable snapped.
	
(Note that ‘process’ is used here differently from its use as a general term for the 
semantic structure of clauses, as discussed in Chapter 5.)
3 	 Durative processes are divided into those that have no end-point (unbounded 
Activities), as in He walked slowly along, and those that have a sharp end-point 
(bounded Accomplishments), as in he walked home. The latter consist of two 
phases, a durative phase, the walking, and a terminative phase, the arrival home. 
The durative phase is usually not in focus unless combined with progressiveness 
(→ 43.5.4). 
Note that although the traditional terms, Activities and Accomplishments, suggest 
human agency, it is not the case that all processes are agentive. It rained heavily, for 
instance, is a non-agentive activity. The key concept here is boundedness, that is, 
whether or not there is an end-point.
The way in which a situation is viewed can be modified in various ways:
••
By adding an adjunct or an adverbial particle such as up, which establishes
an endpoint: In this way an unbounded situation can be made bounded. 
Compare:
unbounded process 	
bounded process
It rained heavily. 	
It rained heavily until six o’clock.

••
By including a multiple subject or object instead of a single element, a situation 
is presented as repeated or ‘serial’. This effect can also be achieved by adjuncts.
He rang his agent last week. They rang their agents every day last week.
••
By grammatical aspect, which we deal with next.
Verbs corresponding to each of the four groups include:
Stative verbs: be, belong, seem, stand, lie, have, want, know, understand, see, 
hear, feel, like, dislike, hate, love.
Punctual or momentary verbs: cough, blink, flash, hit, tap, slam, slap, kick, shoot.
Unbounded-process verbs: bend, dance, drive, read, sleep, write, walk, work.
Bounded-completion verbs: be born, die, fall, drop, arrive, sit down, stand up. 
43.3  GRAMMATICAL ASPECTS IN ENGLISH 
English has two clearly grammaticalised aspectual distinctions: the Progressive, as in 
was locking vs the non-progressive in locked; and the Perfect, as in has locked vs the 
non-perfect locked. We have seen that the Perfect is a subtle tense-aspect which is not 
to be confused with perfectivity. Perfect and Progressive may combine in one VG and 
are marked for present or past tense:
Present + progressive 	
is locking
Past + progressive 	
was locking
Present perfect 	
has locked
Past perfect 	
had locked
Present perfect + progressive 	
has been locking
Past perfect + progressive 	
had been locking
As we saw in Chapter 8, progressive and perfect aspects also combine with modals, 
lexical auxiliaries and the passive.
43.4  THE MEANING OF THE PROGRESSIVE 
The basic function of the English progressive aspect is to indicate a dynamic action 
in the process of happening. Attention is focused on some internal stage of the pro­
cess which, cognitively, is viewed as something directly observed, unfolding before 
our eyes. English makes a grammatical contrast between the progressive and the non-
progressive. That is to say, there is an obligatory choice between viewing the situation 
as in the process of happening and viewing it as a complete whole: 
What was he doing? 	
What did he do?
(Past + progressive) 	
(Past, non-progressive) 

3 3 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
There is more to grammatical aspect than obligatory choice, however. The best way to 
understand grammatical aspect is to see it working in conjunction with the lexical aspect 
of verbs. The Progressive (and, in a different way, the Perfect) add a communicative 
perspective to events and states that is different from their lexical aspect.
43.5  LEXICAL ASPECT AND THE PROGRESSIVE 
As the Progressive is essentially dynamic in character, it lends a dynamic interpreta­
tion to whatever verbal action it is applied to. For this reason, not all types of verbal 
situation admit the Progressive, as in 1a, and those that do admit it are affected in 
different ways.
43.5.1  States and the Progressive
Most stative situations are in general incompatible with the progressive. Permanent 
qualities such as be tall, be red and relations expressed by such verbs as own, belong, seem 
are conceptualised in English as invariable and therefore non-dynamic. When normally 
stative verbs are used with the Progressive the situation is viewed as a temporary state, 
often with the implication of a type of behaviour or stance, as in 1b. Compare:
1a  *You are being tall, George.      1b  You are being far too optimistic, George.
The stative meanings of verbs such as see, hear (involuntary perception), like, love, 
hate (affectivity) and know, believe, understand, wonder (cognition) are in general 
incompatible with the progressive. However, many such verbs have taken on dynamic 
uses and these admit the progressive, as in the following examples:
I’m seeing the doctor tomorrow. (= consulting) (programmed event)
Janet is seeing her friends off. (= taking leave of) 
They were seeing so much of each other, he was almost one of the family.
How are you liking your visit to Disneyland? (= enjoying)
Pat: Oh, I’m just loving it./I’m enjoying it. Ben: Frankly, I’m hating it.
43.5.2  Punctual occurrences and the Progressive 
With punctual verbs such as tap, kick, fire, sneeze, bounce, flash, hit and the progressive, 
the situation is interpreted as iterative, that is, repeated: 
Someone is tapping on the wall next door.
The rain is hitting the windows harder now. 	
[FP6] 
These categories are approximate, rather than absolute. Some processes appear to be 
more punctual than others. Some end-points appear to be more final than others. It 
would, for instance, be unusual to hear He’s slamming the door for it is not possible to 
keep on slamming the same door unless you keep on opening it. He kept slamming the 
door would imply this process, but would nonetheless be unusual. A multiple situation 
in which several doors slammed can be expressed by the Past tense, as in the following:

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y  
3 3 9
Behind the swing door, cupboards opened and slammed shut. Pots cracked against 
work tops. 
Punctual verbs are frequently used metaphorically with the progressive, in which case 
the resulting situation may perhaps be considered durative: 
The recession is hitting the stores hard. (= affecting adversely)	
[ABE] 
43.5.3 Verbs with no end-point and the Progressive 
With those durative verbs that have no end-point (play, sing, work, talk, dance, rain, 
snow, etc.), including verbs of bodily sensation (ache, hurt, itch, feel cold), the Progressive 
has the effect of perspectivising the process as seen in progress by an observer (the 
speaker when the reference point is speech time, the relevant participant when it is in 
the past): 
Something very strange is going on here.
That’s what we were talking about.
There is a noticeable contrast between the temporary, ongoing nature of the 
progressive as seen by an observer and unbounded duration expressed by the simple 
Past or Present: 
Observed ongoing process 	
Unbounded duration Lamps 
were glowing in the dark. 	
Lamps glowed in the dark. 
Snow was falling gently. 	
Snow fell gently.
My back is aching. 	
My back aches.
Similarly, habitual events, when combined with the progressive, have limited dura­
tion. The use of the progressive implies a temporary situation, whereas the ordinary 
Present tense suggests greater permanence. Compare: 
She is running a fringe theatre group (over the summer holidays). She runs a fringe 
theatre group (as her permanent job). 
43.5.4  End-point-completion verbs and the Progressive 
With these bounded processes (e.g. die, heat up, recover) the effect of the progressive 
is to bring into our focus of attention the durative phase of the process before the 
endpoint: 
The atmosphere is heating up and the seas are rising. [CER] 
Last night the 53-year-old father-of-two was recovering in intensive care. [CH2] 
Plurality can lead to an interpretation of multiple accomplishments. Arrive, with a singular 
subject, will be interpreted as a single event, the Progressive stretching the stage previous 
to the endpoint, as in Hurry! The taxi is arriving. With a plural subject and the progressive, 
arrive will be interpreted as a series of arrivals: The guests are arriving.

43.6  THE DISCOURSE FUNCTIONS OF THE PROGRESSIVE 
The Progressive presents an ongoing event as something directly observed in rela­
tion to some point in time. This is either explicitly mentioned, as in 1 and 2 or else 
inferred as coinciding with speech time, 3: 
1 	 By the end of January 1919 the main outlines of the peace settlement were 
emerging. (Paris 1919)
2 	 At half-past five, crowds were pouring into the subways.
3 	 What are you doing? I’m switching on the answer-phone. (coincides with speech 
time) 
Progressive aspect provides a frame within which another event takes place. That is to 
say, the time-frame of the progressive event includes the bounded event: 
We finally reach the supermarket and they are just closing the doors.
When they awoke, the frost was melting on the window and freezing into thin sheets 
of ice over the cold glass. 
The girls were wearing their school uniforms when they came to my house. 
(temporary state framing bounded event in simple past ‘came’) 
Two simple forms, by contrast, are normally interpreted as a sequence: 
We finally reach the supermarket and they close the doors.
Crowds poured into the subways and boarded the trains. 
43.7  PRESENT PERFECT AND PROGRESSIVE ASPECTS
COMBINED 
When these two aspects combine in one VG, the progressive brings into focus the 
continuous nature of the situation, whereas the Perfect leads the situation from an 
indefinite time in the past up to the present, usually to speech time. The possible situ­
ations include:
(a)	 continuous state lasting up to the present 
I have been wanting to meet him for ages.
He has been hearing better since he started using the hearing-aid
(b)	 continuous habitual process 	
The government has been spending beyond its means.	
[416]
Leo, now eight, has been skiing for only two years.
(c)	 iterative occurrence lasting up to the present 
You have been coughing since you got up. 
(d)	 unbounded situations lasting up to the present 
We have been waiting here for some time. 

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y  
3 4 1
(e)	 normally bounded situations become unbounded 
I have been fixing the lamp.
So people have been taping this talk? 
The non-progressive forms would remain bounded: I have fixed the lamp, So people 
have taped this talk? 
The Past Perfect Progressive combines the anteriority of the Past Perfect with the 
features of the Progressive: 
He had been seeing her quite a lot at that time. 
The unbounded result does not necessarily mean that the event was not completed; 
simply that the Perfect Progressive concentrates on the internal phase of the process.
43.8  HABITUALITY: PAST HABIT OR STATE 
Progressiveness is considered here as a type of imperfectivity, or incompletion. Other 
types of imperfectivity include habituality and iterativity. Habituality is, as we have 
seen, expressed by both present and past tenses in English. Present tense uses are 
almost invariably imperfective, the only perfective uses being performatives (e.g. I 
promise not to be late) and the others classed as ‘instantaneous present’. Past habit or 
state is expressed by the lexical auxiliary used to + infinitive as in the following exam­
ples. There is a strong pragmatic implication that the state or event no longer holds: 
He knew he used to speak too fast.
We used to see each other quite often.
There used to be trees all round this square. 
Used to avoids the temporal indeterminacy of the past tense (e.g. visited = on one 
occasion or on many occasions) by making clear the habitual. Compare: 
She visited us. (perfective or imperfective) 
She used to visit us. (imperfective only) 
Furthermore, although a time expression such as not any longer may be added, the implicit 
meaning of discontinued habit is so strong that an additional expression is unnecessary.
‘He’s the top tennis player,’ Westfield said, ‘the grand slammer. He’s played in all the 
big places.’
‘He used to. Doesn’t play anymore.’
Used to + infinitive is not to be confused with be used to + -ing ‘be accustomed to’ + -ing 
as in: He is not used to working late hours.
Iterativity is interpreted from the progressive with punctual verbs, and also from 
keep on/continue+ -ing (kept on shouting) and from the phrasal verb particle away (he 

3 4 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
hammered away). As regards perfectivity, ingressive aspect focuses on the initial point 
of a situation and egressive aspect on the end-point. These are not expressed by inflec­
tions in English, but by combinations such as (start to rain/raining) and phrasal verb 
particles (e.g. She came to, We ended up exhausted).
Summary of certain aspectual distinctions realised in English 
in the lexico-grammar 
Prospective: I am going to write a note
Immediate prospective: I am about to write a note
Ingressive: I started to write a note Progressive: I am/was writing a note Iterative: I 
kept writing notes
Habitual in the past: I used to write notes
Egressive: Finish writing the note
Retrospective, Recent Perfect: I have just written a note
Retrospective, Perfect: I have written a note.

EXPRESSING ATTITUDES	
UNIT 44
TOWARDS THE EVENT	
Modality 
SUMMARY
1 	 Modality is the semantic category by which speakers express two different 
kinds of attitude towards the event.
2 	 One attitude is that of assessing the truth of the proposition or the potential 
occurrence of the event in terms of modal certainty, probability or possibil­
ity. This is epistemic modality as in The key must be here somewhere. It 
may be in your pocket.
3 	 A different kind of attitude is expressed when speakers intervene in the 
speech event, by laying down obligations or giving permission. This is 
deontic modality as in You must go now; the others may stay.
4 	 The modal auxiliaries (except can) in English express both types of modal 
meanings, which have in common the fact that they express the speaker’s 
attitude to a potential event. Closely related to these meanings are those of 
ability and dynamic possibility as in We can take the early train. In addi­
tion, a number of other forms are available for the expression of particular 
modal meanings.
44.1  THE MEANING AND FUNCTIONS OF MODALITY 
Modality deals with speakers’ attitudes towards a state of affairs. It is to be understood 
as a semantic category which covers such notions as possibility, probability, necessity, 
volition, obligation and permission. 
Each of these modal concepts is realised by the core modals in two related clusters 
of meanings: the epistemic, based on the Greek word for knowledge, and the deontic, 
based on the Greek word for obligation. The epistemic meaning is used by a speaker 
to assess the possibility, probability or otherwise of a state of affairs, according to the 
speaker’s limited knowledge or belief. An unmodalised utterance, by contrast states a 
plain fact or assertion. Compare: 

3 4 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
  1	 That man over there is the Queen’s bodyguard. (assertion) 
  2	 That man over there must be the Queen’s bodyguard. (inference)
  3	 That man over there may /might/could be the Queen’s bodyguard. (possibility) 
With the second cluster of meanings, the deontic, the speaker brings about an action, 
using modals to express different degrees of obligation, advisability or permission. 
  4	 The opening ceremony starts in half an hour. (a plain assertion) 
  5	 I must leave now. (presented as a binding, inescapable obligation)
  6	 You should/ought to /had better come, too. (presented as less binding, but desirable)
  7	 The rest of you may stay/can stay. (presented as permission) 
Both epistemic and deontic meanings are linked by the concepts of necessity and 
possibility. Epistemic meanings tend to correlate with stative verbs, as in 2 and 3, and 
can take non-human subjects, including there (there must be some mistake). Deontic 
meanings tend to correlate with human subjects as agents of dynamic verbs, as in 
5 and 6. Essentially, both are subjective: the speaker is involved; and by means of 
modality, speakers are enabled to carry out two important communicative functions: 
•	
to comment on and evaluate interpretations of reality,
•	
to intervene and bring about changes in events.
A third type, dynamic modality, is less central, as it is concerned with ability and natu­
ral tendency, but also overlaps as regards permission (can) with epistemic modal may . 
These meanings are explained and illustrated in 44.6.
44.2  FORMS OF MODAL VERBS 
Modality covers a broad semantic area and can be expressed by many forms.
(a)	 In English, the core forms are the nine modal auxiliaries (→ 37.2) repeated here: 
can, could, may, might, will, shall, would, should, must. These are invariant forms 
which are followed by a bare infinitive; they negate with ‘not’ and invert with the 
subject in yes-no questions.
(b)	 The lexical-modal verbs or auxiliaries listed in 37.3, composed of be or have + usu­
ally another element + infinitive (have to, have got to, be bound to, be supposed 
to, had better, be likely to etc.) 
(c)	 There is also a cluster of semi-modal verbs: dare, need, ought. These verbs behave 
syntactically like modals (daren’t, needn’t, oughtn’t) as in 8 and 9. They are fairly 
rare and are mainly used in BrE. Dare and need are also used as full lexical verbs, as 
in 10 and 11. AmE favours the latter option. Ought is the only modal to be followed 
by a to-infinitive. 
  8 	 I daren’t say anything to her about the broken vase. 
  9	 You needn’t wait. 
10	 Did he dare to ask you if you needed anything? 
11	 How much money do you need? 

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y

Other means of expressing modality are mainly lexical: they comprise modal adverbs, 
adjectives, nouns and verbs, and will not be discussed in this chapter. These other 
modal elements tend to reinforce the core modals, as in ‘I’m sure she couldn’t possibly 
have said that’. This is sometimes called modal harmony and illustrates how modality 
can be expressed not simply at one point in an utterance by a modal auxiliary, but at 
different points right through the clause. 
44.3  REALISATIONS OF MODAL MEANINGS 
We now turn to the actual uses of the core modals, comparing the epistemic uses with 
the deontic and the dynamic. Lexical modal auxiliaries and semi-modals are included 
where relevant.
44.3.1  Modal certainty: will, must, be bound to 
What we call modal certainty is not the hundred per cent certainty of a categorical asser­
tion. If for instance I know for a fact that Pat forgot your birthday, I simply say ‘Pat 
forgot your birthday’. If instead I say ‘Pat must have forgotten your birthday’, or ‘Pat 
may have forgotten’ I am admitting an element of doubt. Modal certainty is therefore 
diminished certainty, chosen because either the speaker’s knowledge does not permit a 
plain assertion or because the speaker does not want to exteriorise commitment at that 
particular moment in an interpersonal interaction. In many cases, reasons of politeness 
or the desire to avoid commitment provide the motivation for modalising an assertion. 
Will and must are the core modals that most strongly express modal certainty.
The concert will be over now.
The concert must be over.
Assumption or prediction: will, shall 
Epistemic will expresses a confident assumption by the speaker as observer, based on 
experience, known facts or what is usually the case. It can be glossed by ‘I assume that . .’: 
Her mother will know her age. 
That’ll be the postman. 
She’ll understand, won’t she? 
Will + have + en expresses a prediction made at speech time (present) with reference 
to an action carried out previously:
The fact is many consumers will have cut back (on fuel) in order to save money in 
the face ofspiralling prices (of energy) (The Guardian) .
Will can also be used to refer to future time, expressing a modal judgement or prediction.: 
There will be time for a few questions after the lecture. 
Scotland will be dry tomorrow with a fair amount of cloud. (weather forecast). 
Any travel agency will arrange it for you. 

3 4 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
When the orientation frame is past time, as in a narrative, the remote form would is used:
A:	 Bill would be about thirty when I first met him. He’ll be about forty-five now. 
B:	 Oh no. He must be at least fifty. 
Predictive shall is much less common than will. It is used by some speakers for the 1st 
person singular and plural (→ 27.5) and, like will, is usually contracted, though not by 
all speakers, to ‘ll (I’ll, we’ll:
I must have an early night, otherwise I shall (I’ll) be worn out tomorrow.
44.3.2  Volition: willingness and intention will, shall, ‘ll 
Willingness 
This can be paraphrased by be willing to. Willingness is expressed in speech time, while 
the action predicated by the main verb either coincides with speech time or refers to a 
future event. Unwillingness is expressed by will not, more usually contracted to won’t: 
Will you give a donation to the Wildlife Society? 
Yes, I will. I’m sorry, I won’t.
Will may also be used with inanimate objects when they apparently respond badly to 
what is expected of them.
The car won’t start.
The meaning of willingness, realised by will, readily lends itself to various pragmatic 
uses. Will would be interpreted as a directive in Will you listen to me and stop interrupting? 
and as a polite offer followed by acceptance in Will you have another whisky? Yes, I will.
Interrogative shall is used in the 1st person to consult the addressee’s wishes or to 
ask for advice. This is the most widespread use of shall in present-day English:
Shall I carry those bags for you? 
Shall we go home now?
Intention 
This can be glossed by intend to. When a speaker expresses an intention, the intention 
naturally coincides with speech time, but the intended action is in the future: 
We’ll pick you up outside your house at 9. 
I shall /I’ll be back in a minute. 
The speaker’s commitment in using these modals is as strong as in the epistemic 
meanings. For this reason, the modals of intention can have the force of either a promise 
or a threat, according to whether the action is beneficial to the addressee or otherwise. 
These interpretations are reinforced by the addition of such verbs as promise and warn.

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y  
3 4 7
They shall be paid tomorrow. (formal) 
I shan’t overcharge you, I assure you. (formal)	
I’ll bring you something back from Paris, I promise.
I warn you that if you keep talking in this way, I’ll hang up. 
The full form shall /negative shan’t used with a 2nd or 3rd person subject counts as the 
speaker’s guarantee. 
44.3.3  Logical necessity: must, be bound to (BrE), have to (AmE) 
The second type of epistemic modal certainty is that of logical necessity, meaning ‘it 
is necessarily the case that the assertion is true’. Must is the modal most used in BrE to 
express strong conviction based on deduction or inference from evidence, which may or 
may not be stated. The concert must be over might be said, for instance if the speaker sees 
that the lights are off or the concert hall is closed. When B contradicts A saying Oh no. 
He must be at least fifty, must indicates that B does not actually know Bill’s age but is con­
vinced that Bill is fifty at least. With will and must, the speaker does not admit any possi­
bility of the assertion not being true. For this reason, adding ‘but it/he may not be’ would 
result in a contradiction: ‘He must be at least fifty,*but he may not be’ is contradictory. 
Must in general is far more frequent in BrE than in AmE, but the logical-predictive 
meaning of must in AmE is more common than its obligation meaning as in I/you must 
leave now. For both meanings AmE prefers the lexical verb have to. This alternative is 
also making headway in spoken BrE, since it is more objective than subjective must with 
the meaning of logical necessity, and also with that of obligation, as we shall see in 44.3.5:
The key must be in your pocket. (BrE and AmE)
The key has to be in your pocket. (AmE and with younger speakers of BrE)
The key is bound to be /is sure to be in your pocket. (BrE)
If Jane is Pat’s sister and Jill is Jane’s daughter, Pat must be Jill’s aunt. (This 
example illustrates a strict interpretation of logical necessity (‘this is the only 
possibility there is’.)
44.3.4  Probability or reasonable inference: should, ought 
A more flexible degree of prediction is expressed by should and the less common ought. 
A driver might say, studying a map, ‘It should be easy to reach York from here’, glossed 
as ‘it is probably easy’. Here we have the notion of probability or what is reasonable to 
expect, based on deduction from facts known to the speaker.
There shouldn’t be any difficulties. 
We should have enough petrol. 
The main semantic feature distinguishing these modals from must and will is that they 
implicitly admit non-fulfilment of the predicated event, whereas must and will do not. 
We can say: 

3 4 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Where’s the map? It should /ought to be here in the glove compartment, but it isn’t,
but not:
	
Where’s the map? *It must be here, but it isn’t. 
	
We should /ought to have reached York by now , but we haven’t,
but not
	
*We must have reached York by now, but we haven’t.
The probability meaning of should and ought is sometimes merged with that of non-
binding obligation (→ 44.5.4), as in For this price, the hotel should be /ought to be much 
better, i.e. one would expect it to be better /it has the obligation to be better. 
Likely and the noun likelihood, with the corresponding negative forms unlikely and 
unlikelihood, unambiguously express probability:
All flights are likely to be delayed.
There’s no likelihood of frost tonight. 
The most likely outcome of Saturday’s match is a draw.
44.3.5 Possibility: may, might, could 
Weaker conviction regarding the truth of an assertion is expressed as the epistemic 
possibility of an event occurring or being true. English speakers make use of the modal 
auxiliaries may, might and could, all glossed as ‘it is possible that . . . ’. 
This may be a dinosaur’s footprint. 
This might be a dinosaur’s footprint.
This could be a dinosaur’s footprint. 
Might and could, though historically past forms, do not in such cases refer to past time, 
but to a present state of affairs. Past time is expressed by have + en.
This may/might/could have been a dinosaur’s footprint.
Can is not used in positive declarative clauses that express epistemic possibility. 
Instead, could has been taken up for this purpose. Can’t replaces must, however, in the 
negation of possibility (= it is not possible that). (The modal adverb possibly is typically 
added for emphasis):
It can’t possibly be a dinosaur’s footprint.
It is not easy to claim with certainty that may, might and could represent points on a 
scale of confidence or, in other words, that one or other expresses either a stronger or 
a remoter possibility. In the positive examples, the three modals are interchangeable, 
with little difference to the message. They may all occur in one utterance, as in the 
following:
I may be a few minutes late; it might be seven o’clock before I can get away; it could 
even be half-past.

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y  
3 4 9
They can all be intensified by (very) well, which heightens the possibility, and by just 
about, which lowers it:
It could very well /just about be a dinosaur’s footprint. 
We must consider where we’ve been before in this House, that our intelligence as 
it stands might just be wrong because it was before and we’ve got to be very very 
hard in testing it . . . (David Davies in the House of Commons).
The use of these modals in the press seems to suggest may and might as tentative, with 
could expressing a stronger possibility, as shown in these extracts from The Guardian:
The change in Britain’s ethnic make-up may already be enough to cost (the 
Government) the next election. 
The ethnic minority vote could be a key factor in the next elections. 
(with regard to fracking) In Texas alone, about 30 communities could run out of 
water by the end of the year.
44.4  MODAL OBLIGATION 
44.4.1  Inescapable obligation and necessity: must, have to, have 
got to, gotta, shall
In English, deontic obligation and necessity can be thought of as an inescapable duty 
or requirement, realised by must, have to, have got to, and in a lesser degree by shall; 
or else simply as an advisable course of action, realised by should and ought. Must can 
have the force of a command. 
Must as a modal of obligation
When realised by must and with the addressee as subject, obligation can have the force 
of a direct command, as in 1, although modal lexical verbs are more explicit. Compare 
You must go with I urge you to go, I order you to go. Order with a 1st person subject is 
too strong for ordinary use.
1	
You must try harder.
2	
We must do better than this. (MP after an election result, sharing the responsi­
bility with others) 
This force derives from the fact that (a) in certain cultural contexts such as school, 
family, the Armed Forces, the speaker has authority over the addressee, who is the 
subject ‘you’; (b) the speaker takes the responsibility for the action being carried out; 
and (c) the verb is agentive and in active voice. 
The force of must is diminished if one of these factors is modified, providing useful 
strategies to mitigate the directness of the obligation, although not its inescapability. 
Such is the case in 3.

3 5 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
3	
Crimes of violence must be punished. (non-human subject, authority doesn’t 
reside in the speaker, passive voice)
4	
Applications must be in by May 1st. (non-agentive verb; passive, 3rd person subject)
When no human control is implied, the meaning is that of deontic necessity. 
5	
Lizards must hibernate if they are to survive the winter. (it is necessarily the 
case that)
Shall, have to, have got to, gotta as modals of obligation 
Of all the modals of obligation, shall is the most imperious, direct and subjective, and 
for this reason is little used in the spoken language. It occurs in legal and other formal 
contexts such as the regulations of the Olympic Games. 
Of the lexical modals, have to is objective (the obligation is external), and have got to 
subjective (the obligation is internal). Compare 2 and 3:
Syntactically, have to, unlike must and have got to, has non-finite forms, having to and 
have to. Both have to and have got to have a past form had (got) to. Only have to can 
combine with the modal auxiliaries (* may have got to /may have to), as in: 
I may have to go to Washington for a few days . 
*I may have got to go to Washington for a few days.
Must has no past form as it is, historically, itself a past form. Forms of have to are 
therefore brought in to express past and future obligation.
1	
All competitors in the Games shall wear a number.
2	
I’ve got to go now. (contracted colloquially to I gotta go now, especially in 
AmE) (obligation internal)
3	
I have to go and see the Dean. (obligation external, both AmE and BrE)
4	
It has to be unacceptable. (Foreign Secretary William Hague referring to 
chemical warfare)
5	
We had to pay in advance. We’ll have to pay in advance. (external) 
44.4.2  Non-binding obligation: should, ought 
Should and ought express a less strong obligation, which is not binding and may be 
unfulfilled. Referring to a past event, with should and ought + have + en, the speaker 
implies that the obligation was not fulfilled, as in 3:
1	
People should drive more carefully.
2	
You really ought to cut down on smoking.
3	
I should have texted my mother.
These modals are used instead of must when the speaker lacks authority to impose 
the obligation. Tact, politeness or a lack of conviction of the absolute necessity of 
the predicated action are further motivations. The following invented advertisement 
clearly distinguishes the necessary from the merely desirable:

3 5 1
Candidates must be university graduates.
Candidates must be between 21 and 35.
Candidates should have knowledge of two foreign languages.
Candidates should have at least three years’ experience.
Functionally, these modal meanings are used to establish and maintain social relations 
and interaction. Through them speakers influence and control others, and commit 
themselves to certain courses of action. They may bring about changes in their 
surroundings by obligations which are met, permissions given, promises kept, and so on.
44.4.3  Negation of the modals must and may 
Negation of the modal verbs must and may is complex because either the modal con­
cept (in the ‘a’ examples) or the lexical concept (in the ‘b’ examples) can be negated.
1.	 Obligation and permission (intrinsic meanings) 	
	
positive
negative
meaning
You must go now
a1
You needn’t go now
= you are not obliged to go
You must go now
a2
You don’t have to go now
= you are not obliged to go
b
You must not (mustn’t) go
= you are obliged not to go
You may go now
a
b
You may not/can’t go
You may/can not go
= you have not permission to go
= you have permission not to go
2.	 Necessity and possibility (extrinsic meanings) 
positive
negative
meaning
It must be true
a
It can’t be true
= It is not possible that it is true
It must be true
b1
b2
It needn’t be true
It doesn’t have to be true
= It is not necessarily true
= It’s not necessarily true
It may be true
(a)
It can’t be true
= It is not possible that it is true
(b)
It may not be true
= It is possible that it is not true
When might and could express possibility, they negate in the same way as may, with 
replacement by can’t for modal negation and not to negate the lexical verb.
Need not (needn’t) is often replaced by the objective form doesn’t/don’t have to in 
both kinds of modal meaning, the epistemic and the deontic. Have to is also used by 
many speakers in the interrogative: Do you have to go now? for Need you go now?, 
especially in the meaning of obligation. Questioning is less common with meanings of 
possibility and necessity, for example: Does it have to be true?
Mustn’t is usually reserved for the obligation meaning of must, for example, We 
mustn’t forget to ask Sue to water the plants (= obligation not to forget).

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
May in its meaning of permission does not have a full set of unambiguous forms: 
you may not go serves for both modal and lexical negation. The meaning ‘you have 
permission not to go’ can be conveyed by stressing the negative particle not – You 
may not go, if you like.
Can and can’t have replaced may/may not in the expression of permission except 
in the most formal contexts.
Can’t, needn’t and don’t have to negate and question the modal concept. When the 
lexical concept is negated, this is achieved by not, which can be attached as n’t to 
must (mayn’t is not normally used).
Can’t is the usual form used to negate must (necessity) and may (possibility).

44.5  DYNAMIC MODALITY: ABILITY, POSSIBILITY,
PERMISSION, PROPENSITY, TENDENCY: CAN,
BE ABLE, COULD, WILL, WOULD, MAY
Dynamic modality expresses properties or dispositions of the subject referent 
44.5.1  Ability, dynamic possibility,
permission, propensity 
Can (negative can’t, cannot) is the modal verb that expresses these three types of 
dynamic modality:
Ability
Can you reach the top shelf? (Are you able to reach . . . ?)
Ability includes mental and acquired accomplishments: 
Can you read Arabic? (Are you able /Do you know how to read Arabic?)
If you can’t swim, stay close to the shore. (If you are not able to swim . . . )
Possibility 
This paint can be applied with a spray. (It is possible to apply this paint . . . /for this 
paint to be applied) (dynamic possibility) 
It is important to distinguish dynamic possibility, which is glossed as ‘It is possible 
to . . . /for’ from epistemic (predictive) possibility, which is glossed as ‘It is possible 
that . . . ’. 
Can is not used for the expression of epistemic possibility ( *It can be true) except 
as the negation of must (It can’t be true (→ 44.4.3). Compare:
I can be there by 10. 	
(= It is possible for me to be there by 10) 
(dynamic possibility) 
I may /might be there by 10.	
 (= It is possible that I may /might be there by 
10) (epistemic possibility)
I could be there by 10.	
(either predictive or dynamic meanings, or both) 
Permission: can, may 
May is a more formal alternative to can in the meanings of permission , and is extended 
to such meanings as polite offer:
May I come in? Yes, you may. (permission to enter requested and granted) 
May I help you with the luggage? (polite offer) 
Permission in a past event is expressed by be allowed to: They were allowed to go.

3 5 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Can is far less formal than may, and has supplanted may except in the most formal registers. 
Can we smoke in here? I’m afraid not. You may not /can’t smoke.
Can I borrow your car? Oh, all right, but be careful.
Might is sometimes used for an indirect request:
You might fetch me a coke and a packet of crisps.
Can is used with verbs of perception such as see, hear, feel and taste, and with 
cognitive verbs such as imagine, guess, grasp and understand: 
I can’t hear anything with all this noise. *I don’t hear
Can you see the time on Big Ben over there? 
I can taste the pepper in this soup. 
Can you smell gas? 
I can feel the spray from the waterfall on my face. 
You can imagine how we felt. 
The students couldn’t follow his train of thought.
Could /was able as the past of can 
Dynamic could is used as the past of can only to express an action or state extended indefi­
nitely, that is, imperfective aspect. Was/were able is used for single, holistic achievements:
You could hear the sound of the rocket in the air.
He was able to escape in time. (not *he could escape)
This distinction is obligatory only in the affirmative and interrogative. In the negative, couldn’t 
and be able are interpreted as having the same result and are therefore interchangeable.
He wasn’t able to escape; he couldn’t escape.
Since can has no infinitive, be able is used whenever an infinitive is required, as in: 
She would like to be able to dive.
I would have helped you if I had been able to.
44.5.2  Propensity, tendency
Propensity/tendency – can, will, would 
This is a dynamic meaning which involves a property or a propensity of the subject 
referent. From our knowledge of people and things we are able to predict not only sin­
gle instances of behaviour but regular occurrences. Would is used in a past time-frame:
It can be very cold in Edinburgh in August.
These tablets can cause drowsiness. 
Ice will melt at room temperature. 
They would sit and gossip for hours.

T E N S E ,  A S P E C T  A N D  M O D A L I T Y  
3 5 5
Heavy stress on will and would is emotive and can suggest that the propensity is not 
welcome to the hearer, as in He WILL ring up late at night, asking silly questions. 
44.6  Hypothetical uses of the modals 
Apart from their other meanings, the past form modals would, might and could can 
be used in a ‘remote’ or hypothetical sense in both main and subordinate clauses. 
Compare:
I will help you if I can	
I would help you if I could. 
She may pass if she works hard.	
She might pass if she worked harder.
To refer to a past event have + en is used. The event is understood to be contrary to 
fact:
I would have helped you if I had been able to.
She would/might have passed if she had worked harder.
Should is also used, especially in BrE, as the replacement of a subjunctive in referring 
to states of affairs that may exist or come to happen:
It is only natural that they should want a holiday.
I am amazed he should think it is worth trying.
For further uses of should in conditional clauses, → 35.2. 
In the following extract from David Lodge’s novel How Far Can You Go?, in which 
members of a family debate possible courses of action, the modal meanings are more 
numerous in the dialogue than in the narrative. What is the reason for this? 
Their Dad would be coming1 home the next day and they would2 have to3 look after him 
until he was too ill to stay out of hospital. The question was, should4 he be told?
‘How long . . . ?’ somebody wondered.5 The doctor hadn’t been specific. A matter of 
months rather than weeks. One could6 never be sure. ‘Who would7 tell him?’ ‘I couldn’t. 
I just couldn’t,’8 said their mother and wept. ‘I would,9 said Angela, ‘if we agreed that 
was the right thing to do.’ ‘Why tell him?’ said the youngest sister. ‘It would10 just be 
cruel.’ ‘But if he asks . . . ’ said another. ‘Are you going to11 lie to your own Dad?’

7willingness; 8incapability; 9willingness; 10hypothetical; 11intention.

Suggest each meaning of can in this extract from The Guardian: 
It is not uncommon for scientists to work with fossil dealers, but it can be a risky business. 
Unless experts can confirm where a fossil came from, it can be impossible to gauge its age.

EXPRESSING OUR EXPERIENCE	
UNIT 45
OF PEOPLE AND THINGS
SUMMARY
1 	 Nouns  refer  to classes of entities: persons, objects, places, institu­
tions, actions, abstract ideas, qualities, phenomena, emotions, etc.
2 	 How we experience entities: experiential features: countability, defi­
niteness, quantity, description, classification, identification.
3 	 Structural elements  that realise  experiential features: the 
head, the determiner, the pre-modifier, the post-modifier.
4 	 Noun  heads
1	 Common  nouns. Countability. The notion of ‘count’ and ‘non-count’ 
(or ‘mass’).
2	 Proper  nouns.
3	 Pronouns.  Personal pronouns: subjective form: I, you, we, he/she 
it, they, one; objective form: me, us, him, her, them. You and it are 
invariant. Demonstrative pronouns: this, that, these, those. Interrogative 
pronouns: who, which, what. Substitute words: one/ones.
45.1  NOUNS AND NOMINAL GROUPS
The main function of nominal groups is to refer to the participants in situations. These 
are not only persons, places, objects, institutions and other collectives, but also activi­
ties (swimming), abstractions (thought), qualities (beauty), emotions (anger) and phe­
nomena (thunder, success).
Structurally, a nominal group can be realised basically by a noun or pronoun acting 
as the head of the NG: gardens, children, winter, food, news, they. On the other hand, 
nominal groups can be long and complex.

One fine morning in October 1969, a celebrated visitor was due to appear at the 
Hilton Hotel on Castellana Avenue. A huge crowd had already gathered before the main 
entrance to the hotel – casually dressed men and women, excited schoolchildren hold­
ing US flags, and a number of interested tourists out for a stroll. A buzz of expectation 
filled the air. Suddenly, the wide glass doors opened and uniformed aides lined either 
side of the drive. Shouts of acclamation greeted the visitor walking down the steps: Neil 
Armstrong, the first human being to set foot on the moon.

Figure 10.1  Pre-head, head and post-head in nominal groups 
When we name an entity, we usually add some information about it which shows 
how we perceive it. In expressing this ‘experiential’ information about an entity, 
some of it is placed before the noun and some after it, as we can see in some of the 
groups contained in the example text:

In this text, we see that the post-head information, given on the right about the head 
nouns in the middle column, also contains nouns with their own pre-head and 
post- head information.
45.2  OVERVIEW: THE STRUCTURE OF THE NOMINAL GROUP
The full nominal group structure has four primary elements: the head, which is the 
central element, the determiner and the pre-modifier in the pre-head posi­
tion, and the post-modifier in post-head position. Of all these elements, the head 
together with the determiner, when present, may realise the NG itself : air, the air. Syn­
tactically, pre- and post-modifiers are usually not essential; for instance, one morning, 
the moon are both complete nominal groups.

Figure 10.2  Basic structure of the nominal group.
The head
The head is typically realised by a noun or pronoun (book, it). Instead of a noun we may 
find a substitute head, realised most commonly by one/ones (a good one/good ones).
The determiner
The determiner particularises the noun referent in different ways:
••
the articles establish its reference as definite (the man) or indefinite (a man).
••
the demonstratives (this, that, these, those) signal that the referent is near the 
speaker (this book) or not near (that occasion) in space or time.
••
the possessives (my, your, his, her, our, their, ‘s) signal to whom the referent belongs, 
(my room, the Minister’s reasons) and are sometimes reinforced by own (my own room).
••
other words which particularise are wh-words (which book? whatever reason) and 
the distributives (each, every, all, either, neither). (Each child, every day, all the time, 
either hand, neither twin).
••
quantifiers may comprise exact numerals (twelve, a hundred, first, second, etc.), or 
may be non-exact (many, a lot, a few, some, any).

3 6 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
All these classes of item that realise the determiner function are called determina­
tives. (→ Units 46 and 47 with a summary table on page 391)
The pre-head modifier, pre-modifier for short
After the determinatives, the pre-modifier describes and classifies the referent. Within 
this function the descriptor attributes qualities to it, realised by adjectives (smartly 
dressed), while the classifier restricts the referent to a sub-class (main entrance, 
Saturday morning), realised by nouns.
The post-head modifier, post-modifier for short
This function helps define the referent still further by means of finite and non-finite 
clauses. Relative clauses are either defining (the man who first set foot on the moon) or 
non-defining (the astronaut Neil Armstrong, who first set foot on the moon).
a street leading to the flower market in Covent Garden (non-finite –ing clause)
Further realisations of the post-modifier are explained and illustrated in Unit 49.
Different from the post-modifier is the complement. Certain abstract nouns such as 
fact, belief, claim, suggestion, news control a complement which is realised by a content 
clause:
the fact that inflation has gone down; his belief that he is always right.
Nouns which control complements are usually derived from verbs and can take a 
complement mediated by a preposition: a lack of knowledge; an expression of delight. (→ 
Unit 50 for complement and content clause)
45.3  THE HEAD ELEMENT 1: NOUNS
Nominal heads fall into two main categories: nouns and pronouns. In English 
the main major grammatical distinction between nouns is whether they are 
countable or uncountable. Count nouns are the largest category and are 
characterised by having number contrast (i.e. having both singular and plural forms).
45.4  REGULAR AND IRREGULAR PLURALS
Regular plurals are formed by the addition of a suffix: /iz/ after a sibilant, as in 
kiss – kisses, church – churches (with the spelling -es); /s/after a voiceless consonant as in 
books, cakes; or /z/after a voiced consonant, as in pole – poles, streams – streams, or 
a vowel eye – eyes, cry – cries (the spelling is -s, with y becoming i after a consonant, 
but not after a vowel: day – days). A number of words of classical origin retain their 
original plurals, for example: phenomenon – phenomena; criterion – criteria.
Most common irregular plurals are formed by a change of vowel (or of two 
vowels): woman – women, man – men, tooth – teeth. Child – children has developed a 

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
3 6 5
‘double’ plural, having both a vowel change and a suffix. Another group marks the 
plural by a consonant change: half – halves; calf – calves; loaf – loaves. A third group 
of nouns have the same form for both singular and plural. This is known as ‘zero 
plural’: trout, salmon, sheep, deer, series, species, aircraft.
45.5  COUNTABILITY: COUNT AND NON-COUNT NOUNS
English obliges us to make a distinction with regard to how a referent is cognitively 
perceived: whether as a discrete, countable entity, such as cow, or as an indivisible, 
non- countable ‘mass’ entity, such as beef.
Other languages make a count–mass distinction, but we must never assume that 
particular items are conceptualised and lexicalised in the same way in different lan­
guages. News, for instance, is a singular mass noun in English (the news is good); *one 
news, *a news, *many news are ungrammatical.
Note that we use the terms ‘non-count’ and ‘mass’ without distinction, as both are 
in common use.
A count noun is basically one whose referent can be counted, as in one cow, two 
cows, but not *one beef, *two beefs. The referents of these nouns are viewed as indi­
viduated things or persons. The following count nouns include both regular plurals 
in -s and invariable or ‘zero’ plurals:
ten cyclists 
two trout 
a dozen eggs 
two radio series
five minutes
five salmon
one grapefruit
four crossroads
two and a half kilos
a hundred sheep
two US aircraft
two spacecraft
A non-count noun is one whose referent is cognitively perceived as not count­
able. We don’t say, for example *three furnitures, *one luggage. Both furniture and 
luggage, as well as news can be individuated by a preceding ‘counter’ – ‘a piece of’ – as 
explained shortly.
45.5.1  Grammatical features of countability
Although individuation by cardinal numerals is a useful guide to countability, to get 
a more accurate description we have to consider the range of determiners that a 
noun admits.
Grammatical features of count nouns
••
the cardinal numerals one, two, three, etc. (four miles)
••
other quantifiers which imply numerals: both, a dozen, etc. (both hands, a dozen 
eggs)
••
the article a(n) taking a singular form:
	
I’m looking for a new job.
••
the determiners each, every, either, neither, which precede singular heads.
	
Each day is different. We go there every year.

3 6 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
••
the plural (including ‘zero’) form of the noun preceded by a plural determiner: 
many, several, few, these, those.
cats and dogs; many choices, few opportunities; these aircraft, those sheep, sev­
eral series.
••
the plural with number contrast marked on the noun: lion/lions; child/children; 
mouse/mice; stimulus/stimuli.
plural number concord with verb or pronoun.
••
People want to be happy, don’t they?
Grammatical features of non-count (mass) nouns
••
the singular form of the noun with zero determiner:
Water is necessary for animal and plant life.
••
the singular form of the noun preceded by all:
I say this in all sincerity. All equipment must be regularly inspected.
••
the singular form of the noun, quantified by much, little, a little:
There isn’t much room in our apartment so we have little furniture.
Nominal Groups that are not marked for countability
The determiners the, this, that, my, your, his, her, its, our, their are neutral to the mass–
count distinction and can be used with both types of reference: this house, this bread; 
our friend, our friendship.
45.5.2  Selected classes of non-count nouns
As non-count nouns are the most problematic for students of English, a selection is 
listed here according to type, starting with singular only or plural only.
1  Non-count singular nouns: The news is good
(a)	 Food, substances, natural phenomena:
bread butter coffee rice spinach fruit spaghetti rain mud snow hail sand soil 
water weather
The notion of substance is useful and may be extended to oxygen, heat, light, electric­
ity, cocaine and so on.
Abstractions:
advice anger fun information love silence peace music knowledge health 
childhood

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
3 6 7
(b)	 Nouns which end in -ics and appear to be plural, but are in fact singular:
Aerobics athletics logistics mathematics ethics linguistics pragmatics phonet­
ics physics politics
(c)	 Nouns which refer to a number of items conceptualised as an aggregate:
baggage luggage cutlery jewellery furniture
(d)	 Activities:
research work homework housework travel
Travel, which has a generic meaning, is not to be confused with journey, which 
is a count noun:
It is best to book through a travel agency these days, especially for long journeys.
2  Non-count plural nouns: pyjamas and jeans, scissors
(a)	 Clothes and artefacts:
	
These nouns have the plural morpheme ‘s’ but do not combine with numerals. 
They have no singular form. In English such items consisting of two equal parts are 
individuated by ‘a pair of’ (trousers, jeans, shorts). AmE and BrE sometimes differ, 
though many American words gradually become current in the UK.
AmE 
BrE 
pants 
trousers
underpants
pants
panties
knickers
pantyhose 
tights 
(Compare: a run in your pantyhose vs a ladder in your tights)
pajamas
pyjamas
leggings
leggings
suspenders 
braces 
sneakers, running-shoes
trainers 
pumps 
high heels, stilettos, court shoes
gym shoes 
pumps (in fashion again) 
	
Artefacts for the eyes and tools of two joined pieces are a second type of plural-
only noun, indivuated by ‘a pair of’:
glasses sunglasses binoculars goggles; scissors shears 
(b)	 Miscellaneous
belongings earnings goods riches savings remains
surroundings outskirts premises (buildings) proceedings

3 6 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
In addition to the collective plural baked goods, AmE, but not BrE, has the individuated 
singular a baked good.
More problematic are people, police and cattle. All three are singular in form but plural 
in meaning. In other ways, however, they differ. People and police can be numerated: 
two or three people, six police. People generally replaces persons with definite reference 
(The people who live in our street).
Police is a collective (the police) and can be individuated by a noun compound 
policeman /policewoman /police officer /police constable, all count nouns.
Cattle is individuated by ‘head’: sixty head of cattle, used in specific registers.
3  Nouns with count and non-count uses: some coffee, two coffees
Many mass nouns can be interpreted as count when they refer to conventional 
instances or quantities of the mass referent:
One baked good vs baked goods (AmE)
One beef and two chickens, please (restaurant or in-flight context)
In other cases, shape matters. Eatable entities visualised as having a definite shape 
are count: a cheese, a cake, a ham, an egg, a potato, while the substance or flesh is 
conceptualised as mass: (some) cheese, (some ham) etc.
You’ve got egg on your tie.
The kitchen smells of fried fish.
The non-count is lexicalised differently in pairs such as cow (count) vs beef (mass). 
The animal itself is count, the flesh is mass: pig-pork, sheep-mutton, calf-veal, deer- 
venison. Shellfish is always non-count.
45.5.3  Countability markers of non-count referents
The ‘counters’ a piece of, a bit of are the most common, applicable to a variety of 
substances:
a piece of paper, cheese, toast, information, advice, news
a bit of paper, ham, information, advice, news
Others are more specific:
A drop of	
whisk(e)y, milk, water, blood
A clove of 	
garlic (vs a head of garlic)
A loaf of 	
bread
A pinch of 	
salt
A ray of 	
sunshine, light, hope
A slice of 	
bread, ham, cheese, beef, turkey	
A scrap of 	
paper, cloth, evidence

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
3 6 9
A speck, a scrap and a shred are used negatively, to stress the absence of the referent:
Not a shred/scrap of evidence
Not a speck of dust/dirt
As well as these, various types of container are used to quantify both mass and count 
referents:
A bottle of 	
wine, beer, whisk(e)y
A pack of 	
cards, yoghurts, tennis balls
A carton of	
milk, fruit juice
A tin of 	
tomatoes, soup, sardines, biscuits	
45.6  THE HEAD ELEMENT 2: PROPER NOUNS
Traditionally, a distinction is made between proper nouns and proper names. 
Proper nouns such as Hilary, Joyce are nouns that have no definable meaning in the 
language. They are arbitrary. That is, we can’t specify characteristics of entities 
called Hilary or Joyce as we can for the entities referred to by the common noun 
horse. Proper names potentially have a more complex structure. They may consist 
of a proper noun such as Coca-Cola or include a proper noun as in Leicester Square, 
the University of Oxford. This is not necessarily the case, however, as can be seen 
from the titles of films and TV series with names such as Mad Men or Neighbours. 
The names of universities, hospitals and other institutions, are – or started out as –
descriptive labels.
All are definite (→ 46.1) and many contain a definite article as part of the name. 
Proper nouns such as Washington, Moscow, Brussels are used metonymically to stand 
for the administrative centre of the state or entity of which they are the capital.
Artefacts such as cars, designer clothes and paintings are commonly referred to 
by their owners by proper nouns functioning as common nouns: a Volvo, an early 
Picasso, your Reeboks.
45.7  THE HEAD ELEMENT 3: PRONOUNS
45.7.1  Personal pronouns and reflexive pronouns
The personal pronouns I, we (1st person), you (2nd singular and plural), he, she, it and 
they (3rd person) derive their functions directly from their relation to the speaker in 
the speech event They are therefore a type of ‘pointing’ element or deictic in that 
some of their meaning is derived from the context. Others include the demonstra­
tive and possessive pronouns and determiners.
I and you refer directly to the participants engaged in the discourse exchange. I is 
the current speaker and you the addressee(s). The 3rd person pronouns he, she, it and 
they refer to persons and things who are not, at the moment of speaking, addressees. 
They may be either physically present or completely outside the discourse event.

3 7 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
One is an impersonal singular pronoun which is sometimes used in formal styles 
to make general statements, often of (the speaker’s own) opinion, or simply to avoid 
using I, as in examples 1 and 2, quoting the actor Edward Fox in The Times.
The pronoun you, as in 3, can refer informally to people in general to describe a 
common kind of happening or experience. These are non-deictic (non-pointing) uses:
1 	
‘One thinks about life a lot more as time goes by.’
2	
’My two years’ there [at RADA, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art] were an 
utter waste of time but I did meet one’s first wife and had one’s first child’.
3 	
It’s embarrassing when you can’t remember someone’s name.
I and we
Whereas I refers to the current speaker, we is not the plural of I, but rather I plus one 
or more other persons. The pronouns we/us either include or exclude the addressee:
inclusive we:	
Shall we sit together over there?
inclusive us:	
Let’s go! Let us pray. (formal)
exclusive we	
We wanted to ask you a favour.
exclusive us:	
Let us go! (→ 24.2.3)
Strong stress (→ marking information focus 29.3) on we can disambiguate a 
potentially ambiguous reference. Otherwise, the addressee has to work out the 
meaning from the context:
A	
How are we going to get there? 	 (ambiguous: speaker’s intended meaning 
was probably inclusive)
B	
Well, WE’re going in Tom’s car. 	 (exclusive)
We/us can refer to ‘everybody in general’:
We don’t seem to be near world peace yet.
The following letter, which appeared as a question in the Dear Doctor section of The 
Guardian, illustrates how context enables us to identify the referents of personal 
pronouns. For instance, who are the referents of the pronoun ‘I’, ‘he/she’ and ‘we’?
I live on the outskirts of London and have noticed a tame fox getting increasingly bold and coming 
near the house. Last week, he (she?) even stuck his nose into the kitchen and we spotted him 
playing on the kids’ swings and eating leftovers on the picnic table.
He, she and they as gender-neutral pronouns
Until fairly recently the pronouns he and his (in both pronominal and determiner 
function) were regularly used, not only to refer to a male referent, but also as a 

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
3 7 1
supposedly gender-neutral pronoun to include a female referent, as in 1 below. Such 
a discriminatory use in favour of males has become unacceptable to many speak­
ers, particularly with reference to occupations, jobs and roles. One alternative, to 
use she as the unmarked form, has not caught on extensively, presumably because it 
discriminates in favour of females, as in 2, so it does not solve the problem, which 
is essentially the fact that English does not have a gender-neutral 3rd person singular 
pronoun.
In writing, the combination s/he is becoming common, but it is not transferable to 
the spoken language. The disjunctive he or she becomes cumbersome if repeated 
too often. A further alternative, the use of they with both singular and plural verb 
forms, is becoming more extensive as in 2:
1 	
Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine 
what shall be done with his own body. [ASK]
2 	 . . . the non-distressed parent may choose to make explicit to the friend 
her own thinking, such as ‘well, the children do usually obey us and every 
parent gets wound up from time to time with their child.’ [ALN]
The pronoun it
The pronoun it, besides referring to specific objects and animals, can refer to a situ­
ation 1 or a fact 2. It is also used to refer to babies and infants, especially if the 
sex is undetermined by the speaker 3 or the reference is generic 4. In addition, it 
is often non- referring as in 5, its presence responding to the need, in English, for an 
overt syntactic subject (except in the imperative) (→ 24.2).
1 	
They were all shouting and fighting; it was terrible.
2 	
She was very scared, but she tried not to show it.
3 	
Olga’s baby is due in October. – Oh, is it a boy or a girl?
4 	
After the child is born, it needs constant care.
5 	
It won’t be easy to pass the driving test first time.
The pronouns he and she are often used to refer to animals, especially when they are 
in contact with humans. Otherwise they are referred to as it.
The reflexive pronouns
These pronouns – myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves – 
have three functions: co-reference with the subject 1; an emphatic use, in which 
the pronoun is either appositive to the subject or postponed 2; and where they are 
required by the verb 3:
1 	
They learned to take care of themselves.
2 	
Susan herself told me so. Susan told me so herself.
3 	 She knows how to fend for herself. One should avail oneself of such 
opportunities.

3 7 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Interrogative and indefinite pronouns
The interrogative pronouns – who, whose, which, what – are described and illus­
trated in their pronominal and determinative functions in Chapter 5.
Rather different are the indefinite pronouns compounded from some, any, no 
and
every:
somebody, someone, something 	
anybody, anyone, anything
everybody, everyone, everything	
nobody, no-one, nothing
These pronouns refer directly to an indefinite person or thing, or a broad class or 
persons or things, not to a referent already present in the discourse. In this respect 
they behave more like nouns than like pronouns, and are often post-modified, as 
in nothing new, someone like you.
45.7.2  The pronouns this and that
The deictics this and that can function as NG heads to refer to a whole proposition or 
situation or something inferred from it, a use classified here as pronominal. (For their 
function as determiners, → 47.2.) These pronominal references may be anaphoric (to 
a previous part of the discourse), cataphoric (to a later part of the discourse) or 
exophoric (to something outside the discourse):
Anaphoric reference: 	 Hilda was making a Dutch Delft cake at the oven. This 
was her speciality and she made it on every occasion. 
[ATE]
Cataphoric reference: 	 This is a security announcement: Would those passengers 
who have left bags on their seats please remove them.
Exophoric reference: 	 I never thought things would come to this. (= to this extreme)
We can see that all the referents in these examples are inanimate and general, and 
some of them refer to pieces of extended discourse.
Reference to persons by the pronouns this and that is limited in English to 
the following uses: 
1a
This is Sally Jones speaking 
(non-face-to-face self-identification, (not 
*I am Sally Jones) for instance, on the 
telephone)
1b
I am Sally Jones (not
*This is
(face-to-face self-identification) Sally 
Jones)
2 
This is my friend June.
(introducing one person to another)
3
Who is that? That’s my 
friend Iona.
(identification of a 3rd person at some 
distance away from the speaker, or 
looking at a photograph)

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
3 7 3
So far we have seen this indicating proximity to the speaker and that distance. However, 
these terms are often interpreted subjectively. For instance, an event distant in 
time may be referred to as this if it has just been mentioned:
Columbus discovered the Bahamas in 1492 and this changed the course of 
history.
Conversely, events near in time may be referred to by that when an effect of 
psychological distancing is required. In many cases, however, the choice is open:
If the Opposition wins the motion of ‘No Confidence’ today, that/this will mean the 
end of the present government.
45.7.3  The discourse function of pronouns
The principal function of personal pronouns is to help establish major referents 
in the discourse by setting up referential (or identity) chains by means of 
anaphora (→ Chapter 6). This is an important part of referential coherence, 
of making important referents continuous and salient enough to be perceived 
and remembered by listeners and readers. In conversation, interlocutors par­
ticipate in the joint construction of referential chains, as can be seen in our next 
illustration.
A new referent is likely to be introduced first by a proper noun such as Vera or 
Mother, when the speaker expects the addressee to be able to identify the referent. 
Otherwise, a full nominal group containing descriptive information is used (a/the girl 
I met this morning at the Post Office). Subsequent mentions can be carried out by 
pronouns, which are ‘lighter’ than nouns and much lighter than extended nominal 
groups. Finally, zero anaphora (She came in and (0) sat down) is even lighter than the 
pronoun. From time to time, especially if ambiguity might arise through two referents 
having the same gender (‘Vera’ and ‘Mother’, she . . . she), the pronoun is replaced 
by the proper noun. Anaphoric reference has also been described as a device of 
cohesion.
In the following extract from Just Between Ourselves, by Alan Ayckbourn, the 
italicised pronouns function in referential chains:
Neil:	
Vera’s looking better.
Dennis:	
Oh, she is. She’s a lot better. She’s getting better every day. Once she and mother 
can bury the hatchet, we’ll be laughing.
Neil:	
Are they still . . .?
Dennis:	
Not talking at all.
Neil:	
Really.
Dennis:	
Well, actually, it’s Vera who’s not talking to mother. Mother comes in one door, Vera 
goes out the other. Ridiculous. Been going on for weeks. I said to them – look, girls, just 
sit down and have a laugh about it. There’s only one life, you know. That’s all you’ve 
got. One life. Laugh and enjoy it while you can. We’ll probably all be dead tomorrow 
so what’s the difference? Do they listen to me? Do they hell!

3 7 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
When two referents share identifying properties, naming may not be sufficient to avoid 
ambiguity in the use of a pronoun. In the following example, inference based on the 
interpretation of concession in ‘though’, and of reason in ‘because’ enables the hearer 
or reader to correctly assign the referent of he in the subordinate clauses:
Tom jumped in the river to save Bill though he couldn’t swim. (he = Tom) Tom 
jumped in the river to save Bill because he couldn’t swim. (he = Bill)
45.7.4  Substitute one/ones
An object that has already been mentioned or is visible in the discourse can be 
referred to by the head-word one, plural ones. These words have no semantic iden­
tity of their own, but only the grammatical function of substituting for a noun or 
NG in order to avoid repetition. When used in this way, these items are classed as 
‘substitute heads’, to distinguish them from the classes of ‘pronominal heads’ of NGs.
It is important to note that one/ones can replace either a whole antecedent NG 
or only part of it. Compare 1 and 2 with 3. In 4, the elliptical plural some, not ones 
is the plural of one:
1 	
I knew Mavis wanted a blue scarf, so I bought her one. (one = whole NG a blue 
scarf)
2 	
I knew Mavis wanted a blue scarf, so I bought her a lovely one. (= blue scarf ).
3 	
I couldn’t find a blue scarf for Mavis, so I bought her a green one. (= scarf )
4 	
I know Mavis likes scarves, so I bought her some lovely ones. (= scarves)
The substitute item one/ones may be accompanied by a determiner, a pre-modifier 
or a post-modifier, thus producing NGs of varying structures:
dh: 	
this one, each one, either one, which ones, any ones
dmh: 	
the only one, that big one, a small red one, a few ripe ones
dhm: 	
that one over there, any one you like
dmhm: 	 some fresh ones from the country
Possessive determinatives are rarely used before one/ones in standard English. In 
informal language – but not in best usage – some speakers might say my one, Peter’s 
one, my friend’s ones, those ones. For other comments on substitution and ellipsis in the 
NG, → 29.6.

GENERIC
SUMMARY
1 	 Definiteness is marked by the definite article the and by the determinatives this, 
that, these, those or by the possessives my, your, etc. + noun.
2 	 Indefiniteness is marked by a(n), some, any and zero. Indefinite nouns are 
specific or non-specific.
3 	 Generic reference is marked by zero (+ singular mass, plural count nouns); 
by a(n) and by the.
46.1  DEFINITE AND INDEFINITE REFERENCE
In English, the grammar obliges us to refer to people and things as definite, indefi­
nite, or generic. This is done syntactically by the use of determinatives, and among 
these, in particular, by the definite, indefinite and zero articles. Definite refer­
ence is made by the or a deictic determinative (this, that, these, those) or a posses­
sive (my, your, etc.). Indefinite reference is made by a(n), unstressed some, any or the 
absence of a marker, which, since its absence is grammatically significant, is called the 
‘zero article’. ‘Zero’ doesn’t mean that an article has been omitted, as may occur in 
a newspaper headline, such as Plane crashes on village, but is a category in its own right.
The three articles are distributed as follows with mass and count nouns:
Mass
Singular count
Plural count
definite
indefinite
the butter
– (zero) butter
(unstressed) some butter
the woman
a woman
–
the women
– (zero) women
(unstressed) some women

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
An entity is considered as ‘indefinite’ if there is nothing in the discourse or the 
situation or our general knowledge of the world that identifies it for us. This is the 
case with an amateur musician, a 70-strong orchestra, a violinist, all introduced for the first 
time by the indefinite article a(n) in the news item from The Week below:
An amateur musician has formed a 70-strong orchestra by approaching strangers on 
the London Underground. Shaun Buswell, 36, came up with the idea after meeting 
a violinist on the Tube in 2011. Having drawn up rules – musicians had to be carry­
ing their instruments when he met them – he approached more than 300 people in 
12 months. His orchestra, which includes students from the Royal Academy of Music, 
played their first gig at the Shepherd’s Bush Empire on Saturday, raising money for a 
children’s charity.
Once the entity has already been mentioned it can be considered as ‘definite’: Shaun 
Buswell, his orchestra. Definiteness is inferred if there is sufficient information to 
identify it, either in the text (the idea) or in the non-linguistic situation (the London 
Underground, their first gig) or in general knowledge (the Tube). Note that the gig had not 
been previously mentioned. We identify it in relation to orchestra and musician through 
general knowledge and inference: gigs are performances, especially by pop musicians. 
This is known as indirect anaphoric reference.
46.2  INDEFINITE REFERENCE: SPECIFIC AND NON-SPECIFIC
Although the term ‘indefinite’ might appear to be synonymous with ‘non-specific’, it 
can in fact be applied to both non-specific and specific entities, whether these are 
count or mass:
singular: I’ve bought a new car.
I need a new car.
(indef. specific)
(indef. non-specific)
plural:
I’ve got some friends in London.
I’ve got friends in London.
(indef. specific)
(indef. non-specific)
mass:
I managed to find some work.
I managed to find work.
(indef. specific)
(indef. non-specific)
The examples show that with singular count nouns (a car), the article a(n) refers to 
both specific and non-specific entities, the different interpretations being deduced 
pragmatically from shared knowledge and also from the different predicates. When 
we need a car, it is obviously not yet specific, but potentially any car. When we have 
bought a car, it is obviously a specific one. The article a(n) can be indeterminate, 
however, between specific and non-specific interpretations:
Ted wants to buy a house in Sussex.	
(= any house, as long as it’s in Sussex) 
Ted wants to buy a house in Sussex.
It’s number 2, Farm Road, Brighton.	 (= a specific house)

As an indefinite determinative, some (unstressed) is used mainly with mass and plural 
count nouns, but the stressed form is sometimes used with mass or count nouns 
with the meaning of indefinite specific as in: There is still some hope of recovery, or 
non-specific as in I’ll need some book or other to read on the beach. Either would be 
meaningful here.
46.3  INDEFINITE PROPER NOUNS
Since proper nouns (Albert Einstein, William Shakespeare) refer to unique entities, 
they are already definite and cannot logically be conceived of as indefinite. On the 
other hand, since it is often possible for several entities to be denoted by the same 
name, such as persons or days of the week, they can be treated sometimes as classes 
composed of individual members. This allows expressions such as the following:
Is there a John Smith in this class? 	
(indef. specific)
It would be better to meet on a Monday. 	 (indef. non-specific)
We had a very hot June last year. 	
(indef. specific)
Indefinite reference can be made to proper nouns used as common nouns: I’d like a 
Martini.
46.4  DEFINITE REFERENCE
The definiteness of a common noun is indicated by the article the. It means that what 
you are talking about is already anchored in your hearer’s knowledge and can be identified 
in one of three ways: (a)within the discourse, by previous mention, with the indefinite 
article a(n)in the case of a common noun; (b) outside the discourse, in the context or 
situation; and (c) from general knowledge (→ 46.1). Within the discourse, the reference 
may be anaphoric (looking backwards) or cataphoric (looking forwards). The anaphor 
often expresses the antecedent in different words, as in the following news item in 
The Week. They refers back to the male members of the Nuseibeh clan; the most revered 
site in Christendom refers forward to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem:
The male members of the Nuseibeh clan have a long and proud tradition. For more than 
a thousand years , they have been the custodians of the most revered site in Christendom: 
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.
The referent of a definite head noun can be identified cataphorically by the information 
contained in the post-modifier, as in: the bus coming now, the journey home, the Ministry of 
Health; or by a determiner or pre-modifier: this bus, the first bus, the red bus.
Reference to shared knowledge immediately identifies the referent of, for example, 
the sun, the sky, the floods, the government, the political situation.
Clearly dependent upon inference for their interpretation, but totally normal in 
certain professional registers of English, are metonymic uses, where the thing stands 
for the person, as in the following examples:

3 7 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
The ham sandwich has left without paying.
The kidney transplant in 104 is asking for a glass of water.
When a personal noun, such as secretary, queen, director, head, functions as Subject 
Complement (Cs) in a clause and refers to a unique social role, definiteness can be 
marked either by the or by zero. As Cs in a verbless clause introduced by when, while, 
if, although, only zero is possible:
He soon became director/the director of the firm.
While Minister of Health, he introduced many reforms.
46.5  DISCOURSE FUNCTIONS OF DEFINITE AND
INDEFINITE NOMINAL GROUPS
The semantic function of the articles is to present the referents of NG heads as defi­
nite, indefinite or generic.
The first two meanings are basically discourse functions, associated with the information 
packaging of the content of a clause, sentence or extended discourse into Given and New 
information; that is, what is taken by the speaker as known to the hearer, and what is taken as 
not known, respectively (→ Unit 29). Such is the case in the following short news item from 
The Times. With the indefinite article, the referent is marked as unknown to the reader and is 
being introduced for the first time. Once introduced, the referent can be referred to by the 
definite article the or by a pronoun (he, in this case) and identified by a proper name.
An amateur yachtsman has spent four days fearing that he was in the middle of the 
North Sea, unaware that he was 100 yards from shore. Allan McKeand, a retired indus­
trial chemist from Skipton, North Yorkshire, ran into fog off the North East coastal town 
of Redcar on Monday.
Quite commonly in fiction a writer introduces a new referent at the beginning of 
a story as if it were already known. This happens in the novel Watership Down, 
where the first sentence is ‘The primroses were over’. The use of the definite article 
here perspectivises the story from a particular viewpoint: that of the rabbits, the 
protagonists of the story, as readers soon discover.
46.6  GENERIC REFERENCE
Each of the articles can also be used when we wish to refer to a whole class of enti­
ties, usually with regard to their typical characteristics or habitual activities:
the + singular count noun:	
They say the elephant never forgets.
a(n) + singular count noun:	
They say an elephant never forgets.
zero + plural count noun:	
They say elephants never forget.
zero + mass noun:	
They say exercise keeps you healthy.

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
3 7 9
In the everyday use of English, the zero form with plural count nouns (elephants) is 
most applicable, while with mass nouns (e.g. love) the zero form is obligatory. The 
three articles express genericity from different points of view, which we will gloss as 
follows:
••
the represents the referent of the noun as a single undifferentiated whole class 
of entities;
••
a(n) represents any individual member of a class of entity as typical of the whole 
class;
••
zero implies that all or most members of the class of entity possess the character­
istic that is predicated of it.
The four structures mentioned above are not freely interchangeable in all generic 
statements. The generic use of a(n) is restricted, in that it can’t be used in attrib­
uting properties which belong to the class as a whole. For example, the but not a is 
acceptable in the following, since an individual kangaroo does not constitute a spe­
cies, whether near extinction or not, whereas the class as a whole, represented by 
the, does:
The kangaroo is far from being extinct.
*A kangaroo is far from being extinct.
Both the and a(n) are acceptable with a characterising predicate, as in our next 
example, since carrying its young in a pouch is characteristic of each and every 
female kangaroo:
The female kangaroo carries its young in its pouch. 
A female kangaroo carries its young in its pouch.
The article the tends to generalise more readily than a(n). The + singular count noun 
may have a generalising value, even when not used in a generic statement:
Do you play the piano?
Some people sit for hours in front of the television.
The definite article is also used:
••
with certain adjectival or participial heads of NGs referring to abstract qualities 
(the unknown);
••
for groups of people named by a nominalised Attribute ( the underprivileged, the 
vulnerable);
••
with nouns derived from PPs (the under-fives, the over-forties);
••
for nationalities (the Dutch, the Swiss).
All but abstract qualities have plural concord with the verb:
Science proceeds from the known to the unknown.
Nursery schools for the under-fives are desperately needed in this area.

3 8 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Not all adjectives and PPs can function in these ways and the non-native speaker 
should be cautious in choosing them.
The loosest and therefore most frequent type of generic statement is that 
expressed by the zero article with plural count nouns or with mass nouns:
Kangaroos are common in Australia.
Wine is one of this country’s major exports.
Zero article with plural count nouns may have generic or indefinite reference 
according to the predication:
Frogs have long hind legs. 	
(generic = all frogs)
He catches frogs.	
(indefinite = an indefinite number of frogs)
A mass noun with zero article can be considered generic even if it is modified: 
Colombian coffee is said to be the best. It is definite, however, if preceded by the. Contrast, 
for example:
generic:	
Nitrogen forms 78% of the earth’s atmosphere.
definite:	
The nitrogen in the earth’s atmosphere is circulated by living 
organisms.

7 	 Summary of determinative elements
47.1 THE DETERMINER FUNCTION
Common nouns in the dictionary refer to classes of things, but when they are used 
in discourse they need to be particularised. This is done by the first element of the 
nominal group, called the determiner. The basic function of this element is to par­
ticularise and so help to identify the NG referent in the context of the speech situation.
As in other areas of the grammar, we distinguish between a function, in this case 
the determiner, and the classes of units, here called determinatives, which 
realise the function.

3 8 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Determiners identify a nominal group referent by telling us which or what or 
whose it is, how much, how many, what part or degree of it we are referring to, how 
big or frequent it is, how it is distributed in space or time. The following short passage 
from The Time-Traveler’s Wife illustrates some American uses:
Henry: The ceremony is at 2:00 p.m. and it will take me about half an hour to dress and 
twenty minutes for us to drive over to St. Basil’s. It is now 7:16 a.m., which leaves five hours 
and forty-four minutes to kill. I throw on jeans and a skanky old flannel shirt and high-tops 
and creep as quietly as possible downstairs seeking coffee. Dad has beat me to it; he’s sit­
ting in the breakfast room with his hands wrapped round a dainty cup of steaming black 
joe. I pour one for myself and sit across from him. Through the lace-curtained windows the 
weak light gives Dad a ghostly look; he’s a colorized version of a black-and- white movie of 
himself this morning. His hair is standing up every which way and without thinking I smooth 
mine down, as though he were a mirror. He does the same, and we smile.
47.2  DEMONSTRATIVE AND POSSESSIVE DETERMINATIVES
Demonstratives: this, that, these, those
These items particularise the NG referent by indicating whether it is near (this, these) 
or not near (that, those) the speaker, in space or time or psychologically, as explained 
in 45.7.2 for demonstrative pronouns. They can refer to both human and non-
human entities in both singular and plural (this century, these girls, that cat, those brakes).
Like the demonstrative pronouns, the determinatives are used with anaphoric, 
cataphoric and situational reference (→ 45.7.2).
The determinatives this and these are also used to introduce a new topic entity 
into the discourse. This use is particularly common in anecdotes, stories and jokes:
I’m walking along the street when this man comes up to me and says . . .
Possessive determinatives
These include not just the possessive determinatives my, your, his, her, its, our, your, 
their, but also the inflected ’s genitive form. The ’s determinative is formally a NG 
plus an inflected genitive morpheme. By convention, the apostrophe is placed 
before the s with a singular noun, but after it with a regular plural noun in s. Com­
pare: the boy’s bicycle, the boys’ bicycles. With a name of three syllables or more ending 
in -s, the apostrophe tends to be placed after the s: Socrates’ wisdom. With a name 
of two syllables, the placement of the s is optional: Dr. Davis’ surgery, Dr. Davis’s surgery, 
the latter case reflecting the additional syllable in speech:/deivisiz/.
The inflection is added not merely to the head noun but to the group as a whole:
My supervisor’s advice; my mother and father’s wishes. I liked those other children’s 
paintings very much.
That young Japanese pianist’s performance was wonderful.

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
3 8 3
47.2.1  Functions of the ’s phrase
The examples seen so far have all illustrated the central function of the ’s phrase: to
specify the nominal group referent, as in that girl’s name.
Some ’s NGs may also function as classifiers, as in girls’ names, children’s clothing, a men’s club. 
With the article a(n) the interpretation is non-specific rather than specific, as in the following:
I need a specialist’s opinion, not a journalist’s.
47.2.2  Possessives as nominal group heads
The possessive pronouns mine, yours, his, hers, (its), ours, theirs function not as 
determinatives but as pronominal heads. (Its is not used to realise this function.)
This suitcase is yours. Where is mine? It’s over there with Tom’s.
The ’s phrase stands alone as an ellipted head of the NG when the noun head is 
recoverable, either because it is known already, or by convention. In the latter case 
the ’s element often refers to people’s homes or establishments such as restaurants 
and shops, as well as to individuals:
Let’s have dinner at Archy’s.	These gloves aren’t mine, they’re Daniel’s.
I have to go to the cleaner’s (dry cleaner’s), the hairdresser’s , the florist’s.
A friend of mine, a friend of my sister’s
The post-modifying possessive phrase of mine, of yours etc. is equivalent to the ‘double 
possessive’ as in a friend of my sister’s. They have the meaning of ‘one among several’ 
as opposed to the more exclusive meaning of ‘my friend’, ‘my sister’s friend’. An exclu- 
sive meaning, which may also express an attitude on the part of the speaker, is found, 
however, when the phrase occurs together with another determinative (this, that, a, 
the, other, etc.), a combination that is not possible otherwise:
That motorcycle of your brother’s
47.3  WH- DETERMINATIVES: WHICH, WHOSE, WHAT
Which, whose express specific selection among a known number; what asks about 
the identity or kind of thing something is. Whatever, whichever express non-specific 
selection, meaning ‘it doesn’t matter what’, ‘it doesn’t matter which’, respectively, 
when the speaker is not able to specify a particular type. What can also be used as 
an equivalent to whatever or stressed any (→ 47.4.1):
Which bus do you take?
Whose car did you come in?
What plans have they made for the summer?
You’ll have to rely on whatever transport is available. 
You’ll find plenty of traffic whichever road you take.
What hopes we had are now fading. (= whatever hopes, any hopes)

3 8 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
47.4  QUANTIFIERS
A speaker may particularise a referent by referring to its quantity, which may be 
exact (three friends), non-exact (many friends), ordinal (the first friend), or partitive (three of 
my friends).
Exact numeratives
These include the cardinal numerals one, two, three . . . twenty-one, twenty-two 
. . . a hundred and five . . . one thousand, two hundred and ten, and so on. These 
function directly as determinatives.
The ordinal numbers – first, second, third, fourth, fifth . . . twenty-first . . . 
hundredth . . . hundred and fifth and so on – specify the noun referent in terms of 
order. They follow a determinative, as in: the first time, a second attempt, every fifth step, 
and in this respect are more like the semi-determinatives, including the next, the last.
Non-exact quantifiers
The two types select referents by referring to:
their indefiniteness: some, any, no, much, many, little, few (a(n) → 46.1).
their distribution: all, both, either, neither, each, every, another, other 
47.4.1  Indefinite quantifiers
Some, any, no, (none)
Some specifies a quantity (with mass nouns) or a number above two (with count 
nouns) as in some money, some time, some friends, some details. Other quantifiers are 
used to express very small or very large amounts. The word some is pronounced in 
two ways, according to its function. It has a weak form when used non-selectively 
as an indefinite determiner (→ 46.1), but it is strong when used as a selective 
quantifier:
non-selective	
/s
e
m/	
We’re spending some days by the sea.
selective	
/s
V
m/	
Some days it’s hot, other days it’s cold.
Stressed some can also be used with various types of evaluative force:
quantifying:	
I haven’t seen you for some time. 	 (= a long time)
appreciative:	 That really was some meal!	
(= a wonderful meal) >
Any has two meanings, as illustrated in the following examples (→ also 3.3):
1 	
Have you any change/any coins? I haven’t any change/any coins.
2 	
Any information would be useful.

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
3 8 5
In 1, any specifies an indeterminate amount or number of something. It occurs in 
non- affirmative clauses, that is, in negative and interrogative clauses mainly (→ 
non- assertion, 3.4). It is typically unstressed.
In 2, any is equivalent to ‘no matter which or what’. It occurs typically in affirmative 
clauses and is stressed. Compare this use of any with anything and either:
You can choose any of the main courses on the menu.	 (it doesn’t matter which)
You can choose anything on the menu.	
(it doesn’t matter what)
You can choose either meat or fish.	
(one or the other, not both)
The negative determinative no has mass, count, singular and plural references: 
no time, no change, no changes.
There is no need to worry. No changes will be made. None (pronoun) will be 
made.
Some and any – but not no – can function as elliptical heads of the NG. Instead of 
no, the pronoun none is used, as in the previous example, and also for the partitive 
(‘none of the men’).
Have you any change?	
Yes, I have some.	
No, I haven’t any.	 I have none.
Did you have any difficulties with your papers? 	 No, none. (= no difficulties)
Note that not is a negative particle, and does not function as a determinative or a 
pronoun. It can precede the quantifiers much and many in ellipted responses.
Isn’t there anything to eat? 	
Not much.
Haven’t you any friends?	
Not many.
Much, little, a little, many, few, a few
These quantifiers are used with both indefinite and definite NGs. With definite refer­
ence they are followed by of and have partitive reference: that is, a part, rather 
than the whole of a previously selected set is being referred to:
Indefinite reference – non-partitive
Definite reference – partitive
much food	
(+ mass n.)
much of the food
little time	
(+mass n.) 
little of the time
many pubs	
(+ count n.)
many of the pubs
few seats	
(+ count n.)
few of the seats
a few people	
(mass plur. n.)
a few of the people (→ 45.5.2b) 
Is there much food? There’s very little. There’s a lot. *There’s much. There’s 
not much. There aren’t (very) many people.
Much and many are used mainly in negative and interrogative clauses, as illustrated 
above. In speech and dialogue much, little and few are replaced by a lot, not very much 

3 8 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
and not many, respectively; but they occur in formal written styles, together with no 
rather than not . . . any, as in the following extracts from T. Givón, Downfall of a Jesuit:
No enemy troops can be seen.
In the narrow confines between the town walls and the church-topped rise, little 
room is left for the mounted Dragoons to manoeuver.
No sound is coming from the high ground on which they are advancing.
‘How are you doing?’ ‘Don’t feel much . . . Better leave me be . . . ’
A lot of, lots of, plenty of, a great deal of, a number of a lot of/lots of
These quantifiers are determinatives with noun heads followed by a PP complement. 
They range from the informal (a lot/lots of ) to the formal (a great deal/a number of). 
Some of them admit both mass and count nouns, others do not: 
Singular mass and 
plural count:
a lot of, plenty of lots of
a lot of/lots of/plenty of money
a lot of/lots of/plenty of friends
a great deal of money
a number of policemen
Singular mass only a great deal of
Plural count only:
a number of
More informal combinations of this type which function like a lot/lots of include loads 
of, heaps of, masses of.
These phrasal quantifiers are not partitives even though they contain the preposition 
of. Partitives have definite reference and represent sub-sets from already selected sets. 
Here is a selection of examples of non-partitive quantifiers, together with their partitive 
counterparts:
Non-partitive quantifiers
Partitive quantifiers
A lot of money was wasted.
A lot of the money was wasted.
No money was wasted.
None of the money was wasted.
They spent a great deal of time in pubs.
They spent a great deal of the time in pubs.
Some books were damaged in the fire.
Some of the books were damaged in the fire.
Three people were injured.
Three of the people were injured.
Their first child was born in Wales.
The first of their children was born in Wales.
47.4.2  Distributors: All, both, either, neither, each, every
Of the distributive determinatives, all refers to a totality; it can be used with mass nouns 
(all power corrupts), plural nouns in a generic sense (all men are mortal) and certain tem­
poral and locative nouns (all day, all night, all America). When the reference is not generic, 
all is optionally followed by of + noun (all the pie/all of the pie; all the pages/all of the pages).
Both refers to two entities together. Either and the negative form neither refer to two 
entities as alternatives. Each and every refer to one of a group or series, but while each 

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
3 8 7
emphasises the separateness of the entity, every makes collective reference to a group 
of three or more (every child, every day). Each can refer to two entities individually(each 
hand, each foot); every can individualise by using the pronoun one, particularised 
optionally by ‘single’ (every single one + of + noun) (partitive). In this way, every is able 
to express partitive reference (every single one of my friends) which otherwise would not 
be possible, since *every of is ungrammatical Both, either, neither and each (but not every) 
can be followed immediately by of before the noun (the partitive use). Here are some 
examples of the distributive determinatives:
All birds have feathers, but not all birds can fly. (generic)
All of the bedrooms have a balcony and telephone, and some take a third and 
fourth bed.  [AMD]
Keep hold of the wheel with both hands.
Both children/both the children/both of the children had measles at the same time.
He can write with either hand/with either of his hands.
Neither twin/neither of the twins is very good at maths.
Each player/Each of the players was given a premium.
This applies to each of us – men as well as women. [AT9]
Two out of every five people catch more than one cold a year.
Every known criminal of New York was there.	 [ATE]
Every single one of their songs was a success. 	
All, both and each following pronouns
These distributors can follow pronouns, whether subjective or objective, for emphasis:
They all/both/each carried backpacks.
We’ve bought them all/both bicycles. We’ve bought them each a bicycle.
All of them have bicycles. Both of them have bicycles. Each of them has a 
bicycle.
All, everything, everyone/everybody
In formal styles all is marginally used as an alternative to everything to refer to a situa­
tion, ideas, objects, actions in general terms.
All went well. Everything went well.
All is ready. Everything is ready.
All is much less common than everything and everyone however. Furthermore, it cannot 
stand alone (as an elliptical head) in Object and Complement functions, where it can 
be used with a pronoun. Compare:
*I liked all. I liked everything. I liked it all. 
All people is more common when modified by a relative clause:
All people who need special medical care must go to a hospital.

3 8 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Everyone and everybody refer to all the people in a particular group. The notion of 
generality can be extended to wider groups and even everyone everywhere:
Everyone enjoyed the show.
He poured drinks for everybody.
Everyone condemned the terrorist attack.
Everyone has their own opinion.
All is not normally used in this way, without a head or modifier. Compare:
*All enjoyed the show. 	
All those present enjoyed the show.
*He poured drinks for all.	
He poured drinks for all present/for us all/for them all
All people is not always an acceptable alternative to everyone/everybody. All the people 
there would refer to definite people on a specific occasion, rather than the more general 
meaning of totality expressed by everyone.
The following horoscope illustrates some of these quantifiers:
Libra (Sept 24– Oct 23)
None of it matters quite as much as we think. All of it is a journey, a dream. Of course, it 
seems real. Dreams always do while we are dreaming them. This does not make life any 
the less precious. To the contrary. We should treasure every moment because we never 
know how many more moments we will have left. Yet sometimes, we cannot properly 
treasure each moment because we are too worried about making the most of our every 
moment. This weekend brings magic. Enjoy it.
47.5  THE SEMI-DETERMINATIVES: SUCH, WHAT, CERTAIN, SAME, 
(AN)OTHER, FORMER, LATTER
These words (except such) are sometimes classed as adjectives. However, they do not 
describe the referent and appear to have a specifying function. They precede either a 
definite or an indefinite determiner.
Such and exclamatory what are among the few elements of this kind which precede 
the indefinite article. They require a(n) before a singular count noun, zero before non- 
count and plural nouns. Such a nuisance! What a mess!
Such classifies an entity by kind or intensifies it by degree. It usually relates to 
something already mentioned in the discourse.
Classifying: (= of that kind)
I’ve never heard of such an animal.
Such cruelty is incomprehensible.
Such people are dangerous.
Intensifying:
Don’t be such a fool!    They are such idiots!    (= of that degree)

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
3 8 9
Certain, by contrast, follows a(n) or is followed by zero. It helps to pick out a specific, 
but as yet not identified, person or thing:
There is a certain opposition to the Government’s proposals. A certain person in 
this room might disagree with you.
Same indicates that the person or thing referred to is exactly like one previously 
mentioned.
He always asks the same two questions.
Another (+ singular count noun) has two meanings: (a) it indicates that the entity 
referred to is different from one already mentioned; and (b) it refers to a subsequent 
entity of the same kind as the one already mentioned in the discourse. The indefinite 
plural other (+ plural count noun) is used mainly in the first sense.
(a) Couldn’t you choose another title? (= a different title)
(b) Would you like another beer? (= of the same, not of a different kind)
I saw him the other day. We talked about other things.
Former and latter refer back to the first and the second respectively of two entities 
already mentioned. They are preceded by the definite article and can occur together 
with the ’s possessive determinative.
Bill and Steve both made proposals. The former’s was rejected, the latter’s approved.
Former is also used adjectivally with the meaning of ‘previous’ when referring to jobs, 
positions or roles. In this function it may be preceded by a possessive determinative 
such as my, your.
A former President of the Royal Society.
His former partner has set up business on his own.
Note that such and the same can function as substitute heads (→ 45.7.4), as in:
Is this a dangerous area? 	
I wouldn’t consider it as such (= a dangerous area) 
Alice had a cola and Sue had the same (= a cola)

DESCRIBING AND CLASSIFYING	
UNIT 48 
THE REFERENT	
The pre-modifier
SUMMARY
1	
The pre-modifier function is realised typically by adjectives and nouns.
2	
Adjectives are used to describe or classify the head noun. Nouns classify 
the noun or cohere with it to form noun compounds.
3	
The descriptor function is realised by adjectives and participles whose ref­
erence may be:
descriptive: a popular disco, a sunny day, a galloping horse, an 
abandoned car
evaluative: a princely meal, a horrendous crime
either of the above: absolute zero, absolute rubbish (= nonsense)
4	
The classifier function limits the entity to a sub-class in relation to:
affiliations: Indian art, French window, a Buddhist monk
quality: a poisonous snake, a non-alcoholic drink
norms: average age, standard size, top ten
process: rising prices , a growing population
society and institutions: metropolitan police, a football club; 
social status
technology: a nuclear power-station, electric light, solar energy
5	
Some words can function as either descriptors or classifiers:
	
civil: a civil manner (descriptor); civil rights (classifier)
6	
The elements of a NG are organised in a relationship of successive depend­
ency and selection, from the head leftwards to the classifier, the descriptor 
and the determiner, and rightwards to the post-modifier, as indicated by 
the arrows in the following example:
d←
des.d

The order of epithets is semantic and partly conventional, rather than grammatical.

48.1  THE PRE-MODIFIER FUNCTIONS: DESCRIPTOR AND CLASSIFIER
The pre-modifier describes or classifies the referent by means of open-class items, 
mainly adjectives and nouns. Unlike the determiner, these are optional. Furthermore, 
and again unlike determinatives, there is no grammatical constraint on the number 
of modifiers placed before a noun. The main types of structural element that either 
describe or classify will now be illustrated.
Descriptor and classifier elements
(a) adjectives
smart clothes, a tall building, good weather 
(descriptor);
rented rooms, digital camera (classifier)
(b) en-participle
broken promises, melted ice-cream (descriptor); 
worn-out machinery, fallen leaves (classifiers)
(c) ing-participle
a disappointing finish (to a match), 
breathtaking speed (descriptor); 
running water, a leading article, upcoming 
events (classifier)
(d) noun
the flower market, a Paris café (classifier)
In addition, the following are also used, though less commonly, as modifiers: 
(e) nominal group
a no-frills airline
(f) adverb
the then President
(g) coordinated clauses
a take-it-or-leave-it attitude
The true -en participial derived from a verb, such as broken in a broken cup, is distin­
guished from ‘pseudo-participials’, which are derived from nouns, as in:
A dark-green, big-leaved, long-stemmed plant with orange flowers
A dark-haired girl
a baseball--capped teenager
Pseudo-participials are often modified, as the modification represents some non- 
essential feature. We don’t say *a leaved plant, *a haired girl, because plants normally 
have leaves and girls have hair. Not all leaves are big and not all girls’ hair is dark, 
however, allowing the formation of big-leaved and dark-haired. In a baseball-capped 
teenager, by contrast, no modifier is needed because wearing a baseball-cap is not an 
essential feature of a teenager.
48.2  ADJECTIVES AS EPITHET: DESCRIPTIVE AND ATTITUDINAL USES
As a descriptor the adjective is used to ascribe a quality (big, old, red, etc.) to the refer­
ent. This may be an objective quality (e.g. a round table, a blue truck, old magazines) 

3 9 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
while others are subjective and represent the speaker’s or writer’s attitude towards the 
referent (good, nice, lovely, bad, stupid, horrible, etc.).
The subjective–objective distinction is not as clear as we might think, however. 
The act of appreciation is bound to be subjective, because the quality is inevitably 
presented through the eyes of the speaker, and yet the appreciation is objectivised 
because it is related to some cultural norm. Some ‘objective’ qualities are culture-
specific. What counts as a tall man or a narrow street in one culture may not appear to 
be so to members of another.
The attitudinal adjective expresses the speaker’s or writer’s subjective evaluation 
of the referent. There are two broad kinds of evaluation:
appreciative: good, wonderful, heavenly (a good film, an intelligent remark)
pejorative: bad, idiotic, monstrous, appalling (a horrible film, a foolish remark)
Certain adjectives can be used both to describe objectively and to express attitude:
Descriptive
Attitudinal
a poor part of the city 
Poor you! Poor little boy!
a huge piece of machinery 
The show was a huge success. 
Attitudinal adjectives are usually placed before descriptive ones: a marvellous sunny 
day; a sickly greenish yellow. They also tend to be preceded or followed by others which 
express similar or related meanings and so reinforce or intensify the attitude or emo­
tion in question:
a lumbering great lorry 	
a whopping big lie
that splendid, delicious meal 	
a sweet little girl
The superlative preceded by the with attitudinal adjectives simply intensifies the effect 
but does not define. Compare:
We saw the sweetest little girl/the most horrible film (attitudinal) with we saw the 
poorest part of the city (objective and defining).
Multiple descriptors
Sequences of two epithets (mainly adjectives and participles) are found in many types 
of speech and writing. Strings of three, four or five adjectives can have a rather marked 
effect. They are common in certain genres, such as advertisements, especially per­
sonal classified ads, as the second and fourth below [square brackets enclose other 
elements]:
Two items: 	
long, winding roads; hard, stale cheese
Three items: 	 exotic, exciting, adventure-loving woman [seeks professional man,
  38+, to live life to the max with]
Four items: 	
[what an] absurd, cruel, strange, mad thing [to do]
Five items: 	
educated, kind, slightly shy, wealthy, good-looking male, [45, seeks
  partner with a view to marriage]

48.3  ORDERING OF MULTIPLE ADJECTIVES
Descriptors are not necessarily ordered in a relation of dependency, as classifiers are 
(→48.5). Nevertheless, their order of occurrence is not totally free, and various sugges­
tions have been offered of preferred orderings. Here is one:
••
attributes of size, age, shape and colour usually occur in that order: a large, rec­
tangular, black box.
••
de-verbal adjectives (i.e. derived from verbs) before denominal ones (derived 
from nouns; (→ 51.2)), as in: an attractive, ambitious woman.
••
short adjectives before long ones, as in: a small, pretty, well-kept garden.
••
well-known words before less common ones: a strange, antediluvian monster.
••
the most forceful or ‘dynamic’ adjective tends to be placed at the end: a sud­
den, loud, ear-splitting crash; such sequences are also felt to be more satisfying 
rhythmically, compared with an ear-splitting, loud, sudden crash.
We shall return to the ordering of pre-modifiers in the following section, since many 
sequences are mixed, consisting of both descriptors and classifiers.
48.4  FUNCTIONS AND PROPERTIES OF THE CLASSIFIER
The function of the classifier is to sub-classify the noun referent; for instance, dental 
treatment is a sub-classification of medical treatment, dental contrasting with other sub-
domains of medicine. Although certain words can function as both descriptors and 
classifiers, these functions can normally be distinguished by the following criteria:
(a)	 Classifiers are not gradable, as descriptive adjectives are; that is, they don’t admit 
degrees of comparison or intensity; we can’t say *more dental treatment’, *very 
dental treatment, as we can with descriptors: more effective treatment, very effective 
treatment.
(b)	 Classifiers tend to be organised into mutually exclusive sets, as in presidential elec­
tion, the presidential airplane (AmE), which contrast with other elections and air­
planes (BrE aircraft) not relative to a president or a presidency. Another set in 
a different domain, that of ways of cooking eggs, includes fried, boiled, poached, 
scrambled [eggs].
(c)	 The classifier function is realised by adjectives, nouns, participles, ordinal numbers 
and, to a lesser extent, adverbs, phrases and clauses. These will be briefly treated 
in turn.
48.5  ADJECTIVES, PARTICIPLES AND NOUNS AS CLASSIFIERS
Adjectives as classifiers are frequently derived from nouns and restrict the noun head 
in relation to another referent. There is a wide variety of relations expressed, including:
(a)	 affiliations to national, political or religious groups, such as: African, American, 
British, Buddhist, Canadian, Chinese, Christian, Conservative, Dutch, Finnish, 

3 9 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Greek, Indian, Liberal, Muslim, Norwegian, Russian, Socialist, Swiss (all written 
with a capital letter);
(b)	 related to norms, sequences, sizes, ratings, scales, for example: average, chief, main, 
standard, regular, top; previous, following, initial, final; personal, particular, exter­
nal, internal;
(c)	 related to areas of study, art, science and institutions, as in the following examples:
affiliations:	
Russian politics, Swedish voters, Danish bacon;
norms, ratings: 	 average age, regular doctor, standard size, top ten, main 
road, personal contribution, particular occasion;
time, place: 	
former boss; old friend; previous page; left leg; right hand; 
periods:	
prehistoric remains, modern times, classical music; 
institutions:	
municipal authorities, industrial unrest, metropolitan police;
professions:	
medical student, social worker, agricultural expert;
devices:	
atomic energy, digital watch, mobile phone (BrE)/cell 
phone (AmE);
processes:	
both -ing and -en participles classify an entity by a process: 
coming events, sun-dried tomatoes 
Here too, a participle + noun may be a compound: guided missile, leading article. The 
-ing classifiers mentioned here are different from de-verbal nouns such as boxing as in 
boxing-gloves, snorkeling gear, reading materials, which belong to the noun class.
When the adjective and noun are written as one word, as in software, hardware, they 
are compounds, referring to a single class referent, not to a sub-type of a class. The 
same may happen with separate or hyphenated words: fancy dress, fast-food, first-aid.
Types of noun classifier
simple (apple blossom)
genitive (a girls’ school)
compound (farmyard animals)
short NGs (Social Security contributions)
Nouns as classifiers are not usually pluralised: trouser belt, car production, rebel forces, 
but certain plural nouns are regularly used, including women drivers; sales campaign. 
Plural forms are also used when the referent of the classifier has come to be regarded 
as a collective noun, as in arms race, sports field, Olympic Games medal, the Arts Council.
When the semantic relation between a classifier and a noun is very cohesive, they 
frequently become fused as a noun compound denoting a single referent, rather than 
a sub-class of a larger class of referents. The dividing line between a noun modifier + 
noun and a noun compound is not entirely clear. Punctuation provides only a rough 
guideline to the degree of integration achieved by the two nouns.
When the combination is written as separate words, it is likely to be a noun with a 
noun modifier (season ticket); if written as a single word it is more likely to be a noun 
compound (blackboard, whiteboard, painkiller). Hyphenation signals those elements 
which form a compound (walkie-talkie) and which otherwise would appear to be 
separate pre-modifiers. This is a useful guide with units occurring within a larger unit 
(high-rise block, high-speed bullet train).

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
3 9 7
Stress-patterning is not always reliable. The preferred stress for compounds is said 
to have the tonic stress on the first item as in safety belt, hearing aid, hunger strike. 
However, many compounds do not follow this pattern (cotton wool, head waiter, zebra 
crossing), while some classifiers do (rose-bush). American English appears to be more 
regular than BrE in this respect: icecream, vs ice-cream (BrE)
The factor that best distinguishes noun classifiers from noun compounds is that 
classifiers can enter into relations of coordination and modification. Compare:
Coordinated classifiers 
Modified classifier
new and second-hand stereos 
brand-new stereos
lunch and dinner menus 
early Chinese pottery
silk and cotton shirt 
pure silk shirt
bus and coach stations 
inter-city coach station
Compound nouns do not admit coordination or modification of their component 
elements:
*soft and hardware 
*extremely software
*pain and insect killers
*persistent painkiller
*silk and earth worms 
*pure silkworm
Classification by other classes of units
Certain institutionalised word, group and clausal expressions are sometimes used:
morpheme:	 pro- and anti-abortionists
adverb: 	
an only child, an away match
PP:	
over-the-counter sales, on-line editing
NG:	
a New Year’s Eve party
VG:	
a stop-and-go policy, a live-and-let-live philosophy
AdjG:	
a bored-with-life attitude
clause:	
a couldn’t-care-less attitude.
48.6  WORDS FUNCTIONING AS BOTH DESCRIPTOR
AND CLASSIFIER
Many words can function as both descriptor and classifiers. Some classifiers can be 
modified and then lose their classifier function: a very British attitude.
Descriptor

fresh bread (= freshly made) 
fresh water (i.e. not salty, not sea-water)

the criminal court 
a provincial attitude 
a provincial town

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
48.7  MULTIPLE CLASSIFIERS
Classifiers are related by coordination or dependency. A lot is left implicit in classifier + 
noun combinations, and with more than two elements the complexity increases.
Related by coordination
The History and Geography Faculty 	
Apple and blackberry tart
The Management and Finance Committee 	
A plane and coach trip
The singular head noun indicates that there is only one Faculty, committee, tart and 
trip, each of a dual kind. Ambiguity may arise if the head noun is plural. For example, 
‘plane and coach trips’ could refer to several trips of a plane + coach type, or to plane 
trips separate from coach trips, analysed as : [[plane and coach] trips] or [[plane] and 
[coach] trips]], respectively.
Related by dependency
Sequences of two classifiers can occur before a noun head, as in the following:
chrome bathroom fittings
Madrid terrorist bombings
In these examples the semantic relations can be inferred directly as increasing 
dependency from the head noun towards the left. That is, chrome modifies bathroom 
fittings, not bathroom, and Madrid, in the actual sense used, modified the terrorist 
bombings. This combination is ambiguous, however, as another reading could be 
‘bombings by Madrid terrorists’.
It is common, then, to find combinations in which either the classifier or the head is 
itself sub-modified, or rather, sub-classified, as in the following examples:
Sub-modified classifier
Sub-modified head
dining-car service 
pocket address book
state school pupils 
two-litre plastic jug
The Observer book reviews 
Italian graduate students
Such combinations reflect cultural realities. In everyday contexts as well as in more 
specialised areas of knowledge and activity, there is a tendency in English to ‘encap- 
sulate’ experiences, devices and phenomena of all kinds into short but complex NGs. 
The ‘telescoped’ effect of such ordered sequences means that, on a first encounter, not 
only non-native speakers but also natives sometimes have to put in some inferencing 
to work out the semantic relations.
In medical, political and other institutionalised contexts, the NG is often represented 
as an acronym, that is, initial letters which themselves are pronounced as a word, or, if 
that is not possible, as initials:

Note that with reference to the AIDS sequence, ‘Acquired’ does not modify ‘Immune’ 
but ‘Immune Deficiency’.
48.8 MIXED PRE-MODIFIERS AND THEIR ORDERING
Between the head of a NG and the other elements, there is one basic logical relation­
ship, that of successive dependency: leftwards from the head to the pre-head elements 
and rightwards in the case of the post-head elements, as indicated by the arrows in the 
following example:
NG
post-headed
d
des
clas
h
those
beautiful
Persian
RUGS
we saw
Figure 10.5  Descriptors and classifiers and their ordering.
Within this logical framework, speakers seem to use semantic criteria, based on 
degrees of permanence and objectivity, to decide the order of pre-modifiers. Those 
properties perceived as permanent, intrinsic and undisputed are placed nearest the 
head of the nominal group. Those that are more variable, subjective or attitudinal are 
placed further from the head.
Immediately to the left of the head is the classifier, since this is the closest relationship, 
as in Persian rugs, radio programme, park entrance, leather suitcases.
Where there is more than one classifier, affiliation precedes substance as in German 
leather suitcases, Indian lamb curry. If there is no affiliation, substance precedes other 
classifiers (steel medical instrument, cotton gardening gloves).
The next place, moving to the left, is occupied by colour adjectives, and before 
them come any participial modifiers (battered brown German leather suitcases, stained 
blue plumbers’ overalls). Preceding these are the most central adjectives, such as 
tall, young, long, hot (for ordering of these, → 48.3). At the start of the list are the 
attitudinal adjectives – such as beautiful, ugly, marvellous, horrible, nice, nasty – after any 
determinatives. This is the unmarked order, which causes us to say:

4 0 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
a large oil tanker 	
and not *an oil large tanker
increased income tax rebates 	
and not *income tax increased rebates
a beautiful blue silk scarf 	
and not *a silk beautiful blue scarf 
a nice hot Indian curry 	
and not *a hot Indian nice curry
Participial modifiers can occupy various positions. Those that are verbal nouns, such 
as gardening in gardening gloves, always stay close to the head noun, whereas those that 
have become gradable adjectives, such as interested, bored, exciting, may occur nearer 
the determinative, if there is one. If the participial seems to have an evaluative tinge, it 
is even more likely to precede other adjectives:
interested foreign spectators
an exciting new adventure story 
a battered old leather suitcase
The following extract from All American Girl shows how a teenager sees herself at a 
particular moment:
I stood on the kerb across from the Founding Church of Scientology, squinting into the 
light drizzle and headlights in the direction Theresa was supposed to come. As I stood 
there, I couldn’t help feeling kind of sorry for myself. I mean, there I was, a fifteen-year-
old, left-handed, red-headed, boyfriendless, misunderstood middle-child reject, broke, 
standing in the rain after skipping her drawing-class because she couldn’t take criticism.

IDENTIFYING AND	
UNIT 49
ELABORATING THE REFERENT	
The post-modifier
SUMMARY
1 	 The function of the post-modifier is essentially that of providing further 
information about the referent of the nominal group in order to identify and 
define it further, or to furnish supplementary information.
2	
For this reason, most of the units (clauses, phrases, groups) which occur in 
post-head position of the NG can be either defining (integrated) or non-
defining (supplementive). Defining post-modifier units are embedded in 
the NG structure, whereas non-defining units are not embedded. The latter 
are classed as supplementives.
3 	 The post-modifier is realised by a wide variety of units, including the 
following, which are here presented as defining:
PPs	
the house on the corner, a new album by a top 
musician
finite relative clauses	
the man who is standing in the corridor
non-finite relative clauses
	
the man standing in the corridor (-ing cl.)
	
the man to consult is Jones (to-inf. cl.)
	
the email I sent this morning (-en cl.)
adj or adjG 	
a room full of furniture; the best hotel available
adverb	
the flat upstairs apposition 
	
NG my friend the doctor
reflexive pronoun	
the doctor himself
4 	 Complements of nouns are a different type of post-head element.

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
49.1  COMMUNICATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE POST-MODIFIER 
ELEMENTS
The post-modifier elements have two basic communicative functions:
(a)	 to supply information enabling the hearer/reader to specify and identify the per­
son or thing referred to by the NG, as in:
1 	 This is the house where the Prime Minister lives.
(b)	 to add supplementary information about the referent when it has already been 
identified, as in:
2 	 This is Number 10 Downing Street, where the Prime Minister lives.
These two roles or functions are encoded as defining (or restrictive) and non-defining 
(or non-restrictive) units, respectively. Both terms are in current use, but ‘non-
defining is preferred here a more transparent. In 1, the defining type, the clause where 
the Prime Minister lives is integrated (embedded) within the nominal group structure. 
Its function is to identify the house where the Prime Minister lives from all other 
possible houses.
When the referent is already identified or assumed to be known, as in 2, the non- 
defining unit is subordinate but not embedded. Its function is to add descriptive, 
supplementary information. Thus the same clause where the Prime Minister lives does not 
identify the house where the Prime Minister lives in 2, because Number 10, Downing 
Street is already identified or assumed to be known. Rather, it makes a linked, but 
separate assertion and has the status of a supplementive.
The difference between the two types of unit is marked both prosodically and in 
writing. Defining units such as 1 are not separated from their antecedent by either pauses 
or punctuation. By contrast, non-defining units are usually written between commas, 
dashes or brackets and pronounced between short pauses as separate information units 
(→ 33.2). Punctuation is not a hundred per cent reliable, however, and it is possible 
that prosodic features such as pauses are not generalised either. We shall see further 
distinguishing characteristics in the section on relative clauses (→ 49.3)
49.2  DEFINING AND NON-DEFINING REALISATIONS OF THE 
POST-MODIFIER
Most of the various units that occur as post-modifiers or as complements of the noun 
(→ Unit 50) can be either defining or non-defining. We shall look at each type in turn, 
starting with the defining.
Defining (embedded) realisations of the post-modifier
The post-modifier is realised by a wide range of units, including clauses, phrases and 
groups.

49.3  FINITE RELATIVE CLAUSES AS POST-MODIFIERS
49.3.1  The relativisers
Finite relative clauses are introduced by a relative pronoun or adverb (called a relativ­
iser). English uses several different relativisers: who, whom, whose, which, that, where, 
when, why and zero (0). The relativiser refers back to the head of the nominal group, 
which is termed the antecedent, for example, ‘people’ in the people who were waiting.
Who (objective whom) is used after an animate, particularly a human, head noun. 
The relativiser who is not omitted when it functions as subject in the relative clause:
Perhaps the people who were waiting are still there. (perhaps *the people were 
waiting are still there)
The only exceptions are introduced by unstressed there or by a cleft. They are on the 
borderline between dialectal and very colloquial speech, and are not standard uses:
There’s a man outside (0) wants to speak to you. It was John (0) told me about you.
Whom is always used when it directly precedes a preposition, as in 1. This is a formal 
use. In less formal speech and writing whom is commonly avoided by ‘stranding’ the 
preposition (→ 6.3.3) and replacing whom by who, that or zero, as in 2. Compare:
1 	 the students with whom I share a flat.
2 	 the students who I share a flat with/that I share a flat with/(0) I share a flat 
with
Which is used with inanimate heads in both subject and object functions in the relative 
clause, and before a preposition. The same alternatives are open for which as for whom:
the matter which concerns us at present (subject)
there is one matter which I must bring up (object)
Their life was one for which she was unprepared. (following a preposition) 
Their life was one that/which/(0) she was unprepared for.
That is used in both subject and object functions and for both animate and inanimate 
heads in integrated relative clauses. It is a useful alternative to who(m) and which when 
the speaker prefers to avoid the animate–inanimate distinction:
The large Alsatian that belongs to the people next door is rather fierce.
However, that is not normally used after a personal proper name, as such a use is 
typically non-defining (see below). Neither is that used following a preposition.
As a relative pronoun, that is more common than which in spoken and in much 
written English, but which is said to be more common than that in academic writing. 
When the antecedent is a demonstrative pronoun, that tends to be avoided (What’s that 
[that] you have there?), zero being preferred over both that and which (What’s that [0] you 
have there?). When the antecedent is an indefinite pronoun, that is more common than 

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
4 0 5
which in subject function (Anything that might happen . . .) whereas zero is common in 
object function (Everything [0] we know . . .).
Zero (that is, the non-use of the relative pronouns whom, which or that) is common 
practice when these pronouns function as object in the relative clause. Compare the 
various options, ranging from most formal to informal, in the following example:
the girl to whom I lent my coat the girl whom I lent my coat to the girl that I lent my 
coat to the girl (0) I lent my coat to
When and where as relativisers introduce circumstantial information, of time and 
place respectively: the place where he was born; the time when he’s sure to be at home.
Why occurs as a relative only after the noun ‘reason’ and the like – cause, 
explanation, excuse: There’s no reason why we shouldn’t be friends. Many speakers 
consider it superfluous after ‘reason’.
Whose is the possessive form and is used not only to refer to animate head nouns 
but also to inanimates, as a shorter alternative to of which + determiner:
children whose parents both go out to work
the houses whose roofs were in need of repair
49.3.2  Features of the defining relative clause
The defining (or restrictive,)relative integrates with the head noun together with its 
pre-modifiers to form a larger unit, syntactically, prosodically and semantically.
••
Syntactically it is embedded in the NG structure.
••
Prosodically, it shares the intonation contour of its antecedent, as the two together 
constitute one information unit:
You had better buy milk that hasn’t passed its sell-by date. (= only the milk that 
hasn’t passed its sell-by date)
••
Semantically, the defining relative is an integral part of the meaning of the whole 
nominal group. It helps to establish what (or whom) the speaker is talking about. 
It picks out the referent(s) from other possible referents by some distinguishing 
property: in this case the freshness of the milk.
49.3.3  Features of the non-defining relative clause
Unlike defining (integrated) relative clauses, non-defining relative clauses are not 
embedded in the nominal group structure. Although they are marked as subordi­
nate by a relativiser, they are parentheticals which have considerable semantic 
independence.
Prosodically, they don’t share the intonation contour of the matrix clause. Instead, 
they have their own intonation contour, which constitutes an independent information 
unit:
You had better buy Celtic, which has not passed its sell-by date.

4 0 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
They don’t identify one referent from other possible referents. The antecedent is 
already restricted and the clause is complete. 
Consequently, unlike integrated relatives, non-defining relatives can have as 
antecedent a proper noun or name, as above, which identifies a particular person 
or persons, object(s) or institution(s). The pronouns used are who, whom, whose and 
which, rarely that:
I’ll give the CD to Ben, who likes music. (*that likes music)
The injured child was taken to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, which is in Wavertree.
Semantically, the supplementive provides additional new information which is not 
essential, but may explain or elaborate on the content of the previous clause.
When placed medially, the non-restrictive relative is enclosed:
Plans for extending the John Lennon airport, which will cope with ten times the 
present air traffic, are now under way.
You would think that my dad, who is an international economist with the World Bank, 
would understand this. 	
(All American Girl)
As it makes an independent statement, which is an extension of the already complete 
unit, non-defining relatives are increasingly found functioning as freestanding 
subordinate clauses, which may initiate a new paragraph in written discourse. (→ 33.2 
for spoken examples of ‘sentential’ relatives, whose antecedent is the whole clause.)
And into the room walked David, the President’s son.
Who also happened to be David from my drawing class with Susan Boone.
(All American Girl)
49.4  NON-FINITE RELATIVE CLAUSES AS POST-MODIFIERS
-ing clauses and -en clauses 
He wrote a book containing his reminiscences of five U.S. Presidents.
The book also described his own life as a press officer serving them in the White
 House.	
 (Libra, journal of Foyle’s Ltd)
The value of these defining -ing clauses is similar to that of a finite relative clause: a 
book that contained ...a press officer who had served them. As we saw in Chapter 7, the -ing 
form is, in many constructions, an economical resource for expressing relationships 
where tense or aspect do not need to be further specified.
This property of the -ing, as also the -en clauses, which are always passive, is 
particularly evident in their non-defining function as supplementives.

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S

-ing clauses 	He was sent several letters, all containing a white, powdery 
substance.
The stained-glass windows, illustrating biblical scenes, are splendid.
-ed clauses 	 The enormous volume, dedicated to his wife, lay on the desk.
to-infinitive clauses – nothing to fear
As post-modifiers, to-infinitive clauses can correspond to full relative clauses in which 
the relative pronoun is S, Od or C:
S 	
The next train to arrive at Platform 5 is the express train to York
	
(= the train which/that will arrive)
Od 	 They have nothing to eat. (= nothing which they can eat)
	
The man to consult is Jones. (= the man whom/that you should consult is
  Jones)
C	
The commonest kind of worker to become nowadays is an unemployed one.
(= The commonest kind of worker that one can become)
49.5  OTHER TYPES OF UNIT AS POST-MODIFIERS
49.5.1  Prepositional phrases
This is by far the commonest class of circumstantial post-modifier used in English NGs. 
It is also the most economical. The listed examples are all defining, except the last, 
which is non-defining (supplementive):
the concert on Monday 	
a clown with a red nose
the plane from Oslo 	
a job for the experts
a ticket to Paris 	
the man in the dark suit
the end of the story 	
the back wheels of the car
The departure time, at 5 o’clock in the morning, was uncomfortably early for most 
passengers. (non-defining)
Multiple PP post-modifiers can be either coordinated or embedded:
The path over the cliffs and down to the beach. (coordinated)
Those books [on the top shelf [of the bookcase [in my bedroom]]]. (embedded)
49.5.2 Adjectival groups
Single adjectives are rarely used as post-modifiers and are limited to the following 
types:
••
a small number of fixed expressions, the relic of a French structure: a court martial, 
the devil incarnate, from time immemorial;
••
after certain pronominal heads: those present, something nice, nobody interesting.

4 0 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Adjectival group post-modifiers usually contain their own modifier elements:
We chose the solution most likely to succeed.
He always wore socks full of holes.
49.5.3  Adverbial groups
Adverbial group heads used to post-modify nouns express notions such as space, 
time and reason. In many cases they may be analysed as ellipted adverbial groups or 
clauses:
place: 	
Is this the way out?
time: 	
He came, and left the week after.
reason:	
She fell out with her sister, but I never knew why.
Relative adverbial clauses as post-modifiers
The relative adverbs where, when and why introduce clauses which post-modify nouns 
denoting places, times or reasons. Where and when have corresponding supplementive 
uses. 
Defining
Supplementive
1a	 She took her degree at the university 
where she was studying.
2a	 The week when the exams take place, I 
intend to be ill.
3a	 The reason why I ask is very simple.
1b	 She took her degree at London 
University, where she was studying.
2b	 The week after, when the exams took 
place, I was ill.
Figure 10.6  Defining and supplementive adverbs.
The relative adverbs when and why, but rarely where, can be replaced by that or zero in 
restrictive clauses:
In the week (that) the exams take place . . . The reason (that) I ask you . . .
The town where I was born but not *The town that I was born.
Zero is also common after the head noun way:
That’s not the way (0) we do it here.
49.5.4  Appositive nominal groups
The closest post-modifying relationship is that between the head of a NG and an 
appositive unit, that is, a nominal unit that has the same referent. The relation between

them and the head noun may be integrated (my friend the doctor . . .) or supplementive 
(my friend, the doctor I told you about . . .).
The following are some of the appositive relationships these may express:
definition: 	
My friend the doctor.
naming: 	
The explorer Marco Polo.
role:

description: 	
Chivalry, the dominant idea of the medieval ruling classes, 
was symbolised by the Round Table, nature’s perfect shape.

the chairman by popular vote.

NOUN COMPLEMENT CLAUSES	
UNIT 50
SUMMARY
1	
A different type of post-head element is the complement clause, which is 
controlled by head nouns.
2	
The two main types of noun complement clause are that-clauses and 
to-infinitive clauses. Less common types are of + -ing clauses and wh- 
complement clauses.
3	
Complements complete the meaning of the head. They precede 
post-modifiers. 
50.1  FEATURES OF THE THAT-COMPLEMENT CLAUSE
Although they look superficially similar to relative clauses, complement clauses are 
in fact quite different. The that-clause which complements the noun is a content 
clause, not a relative clause. That is not normally omitted from complement clauses. 
Compare:
The news that the President had fled the country was expected. (complement 
clause)
The news (that) we received was worse than expected. (relative clause, admits zero)
While relative clauses can modify all types of nouns, complement clauses are dependent 
on a relatively small number of abstract nouns, such as fact, belief, suggestion, hope, 
idea, expectation, wish. They can be used non-definingly following a relative clause that 
post-modifies the same noun:
The rumour that was circulating, that the Chancellor was about to resign, proved to 
be false.
The content clause expresses the whole content of the head noun, as in: the news 
that the President had fled the country, his belief that he was always right.
The nominal groups taking noun complements tend to be definite and singular, 
as illustrated in the present examples.

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
4 1 1
Head nouns that take complement clauses are mainly nominalisations which 
have corresponding verbs or adjectives, though a few are simple. Here is a sample:
With a corresponding verb: 	
knowledge, belief, assumption,
  claim, thought, report, hope, reply,
 
wish, proof, expectation,
 
suggestion, hypothesis
With a corresponding adjective:	
awareness, confidence, probability,
  eagerness, possibility, likelihood
simple:	
fact, story, idea, news, notion, rumour
The notion that the earth is flat was discredited centuries ago.
The fact that inflation is going down is a sign that our economy is improving. 
The possibility that they might be beaten never crossed their minds.
The function of the that-complement clause is to report a proposition (that the earth 
is flat, that they might be beaten) derived from the previous discourse. The head noun 
conveys different types of stance, depending on the type used:
nouns of cognition and reasoning: knowledge, belief, idea, assumption, 
hypothesis, conclusion;
speech-act nouns, such as suggestion, proposal, claim;
personal assessment: possibility, doubt, fact, fear, hope, chance, or
the source of knowledge (evidence, rumour) (→ 8.2.5 for epistemic, evidential 
and evaluative stance).
Stance in complement clauses is much less direct than in that-clauses following a verb, 
such as ‘he believes that . . . etc.’ (→ 11.1). Furthermore, as the head noun often takes 
the form of a nominalization and is typically definite, it presents the following proposition 
as Given information and therefore beyond dispute. These factors make the comple­
ment clause a useful tool in argumentation. (→ Given and New information 29.2)
Noun complement clauses occur mainly in formal written and spoken English. 
They are less common in conversation. They are undoubtedly related to nomi­
nalisation and grammatical metaphor in discourse (→ Chapter 5) and are less 
common in conversation.
50.2  TO-INFINITIVE COMPLEMENT CLAUSES
Head nouns which take to-infinitive complement clauses are likewise often related 
to a verb or an adjective and include the following:
de-verbal: 	
attempt, decision, desire, failure, plan, tendency, permission
de-adjectival: 	 ability, inability, right, capacity
simple: 	
chance, effort, opportunity

4 1 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
The function of to-infinitive complements is to point to human acts or goals, as in:
attempts to trump up facts and
evidence failure to warn the students in advance
The following quotation illustrates the difference between a PP complement and a 
to –infinitive complement:
The global threat to our security was 	
(PP complement = x threatened our
clear. 	
security)
So was our duty to act to eliminate it. (to-infinitive complement)
(Prime Minister Tony Blair’s speech on the threat of international terrorism, 5 
March 2004)
50.3  OF + -ING COMPLEMENT CLAUSES
Head nouns which take of followed by –ing complement clauses include: thought, 
habit, importance, way, effect, danger, risk
There is overlap with the to-infinitive construction in that some nouns (idea, 
way, possibility, thought, hope) can take either of these constructions as complement, 
besides taking a relative clause with that as post-modifier:
The risk of losing your way in the forest/that you might lose your way. (comp.) 
The possibility of not being rescued/that you might not be rescued. (comp.)
The risk/possibility that you told us about was very real. (defining relative clause)
50.4 WH-COMPLEMENT CLAUSES
A further type of post-head complement is the wh-clause. It is most common when 
following the preposition of or about. Both finite clauses and non-finite to-infinitive 
clauses can occur:
The question (of) how much we should spend on our holidays.
He has strong doubts (about) whether he should accept the post.
The question (of) how much to spend on our holidays . . .
He has strong doubts (about) whether to accept the post.
50.5  PREPOSITIONAL COMPLEMENTS OF NOUNS
These are typically controlled by nouns which have corresponding verbs:
A desire for fame 	
x desires fame
Reliance on public transport 	
x relies on public transport
A lack of knowledge 	
x lacks knowledge

TA L K I N G  A B O U T  P E O P L E  A N D  T H I N G S  
4 1 3
The preposition of, however, is controlled by many nouns which are not related to 
verbs: advantage, danger, effect, importance, means, method, problem, purpose, task, way.
50.6  FUNCTIONS OF THE NOMINAL GROUP
In clauses, NGs can realise any structural element except the Predicator. At group 
rank they can be embedded in PPs as complements of the preposition and in NGs as 
pre- or post-modifiers, or as supplementives, of the head element. Here are examples 
of the functions that can be realised by a simple NG such as the best player available.
NGs as clause elements
The best player available was a Welshman.	
S
The committee engaged the best player available.	
Od
They offered the best player available a high salary.	
Oi
Bale seemed to be the best player available.	
Cs
Everybody considered him the best player available.	
Co
He signed the contract last week.	
A
NGs as group elements
They paid a high price for the best player available.	
c
The best player-available topic was not discussed	
pre-modifier
Gareth Bale, the best player available, earns a high salary.	
Appos. sup.
50.7  NOMINALISATION
In many professional registers, above all in written genres, the use of nominali­
sation has become extremely common. Superficially, it consists of the use of a 
nominal form, such as ‘starvation’ in the following text, instead of the corresponding 
verb ‘starve’, from which the nominal is derived. Other examples from the text are:
accuracy	
derived from the adjective ‘accurate’
explanation	 derived from ‘explain’
increase	
has the same form as the verb ‘increase’
speed	
has the same form as the verb ‘speed’
It has been known for nearly a century that starvation for about two weeks1 increases the speed 
and accuracy of mental processes,2 especially mental arithmetic.3 This is probably the explana­
tion of the huge increase in self-starvation among young women doing academic work.4 An 
extreme form of this condition known as ‘anorexia nervosa’5 is now common and our studies6 
have shown that in 75% of cases7 they start crash-dieting8 in the year in which they are working 
for a major examination.

4 1 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
It is clear that nominalisation is no mere substitute for a verb or adjective, however. 
Instead, the use of a nominalised expression requires an entirely different organisa­
tion of the whole sentence, and indeed a completely different semantic conceptualisa­
tion. (This is discussed in Chapter 5.) In this way, a great deal of information, which 
would otherwise be expressed as verbs, adjectives and PPs, is packed into the nominal 
groups. The result is very long, dense NGs, which tend to be abstractions, instead of 
referring to concrete persons who act as Agents. In fact, personal participant subjects 
in heavily nominalised styles tend to be no longer the head of the NG.
A non-nominalised equivalent of the first four NGs in the extract above might look 
something like this:
1 If you/people starve for about two weeks, 2 you/they think faster and more accu­
rately, 3 especially when doing arithmetic; 4 This probably explains why young women 
who are doing academic work starve themselves.
One reason for the use of nominalisation is that it is shorter than the non-nominalised 
form. More important, the nominalised form encapsulates a whole situation in one 
word, such as ‘self-starvation’, ‘crash-dieting’. Because density and brevity prevail over 
clarity, heavy nominalisation can become difficult to understand in unfamiliar contexts. 
For those familiar with the subject-matter, on the other hand, nominalisation provides 
them with a kind of shorthand by which complex concepts and processes are easily 
handled without further explanation. All adult speakers of English handle at least some 
specialised registers such as education, business, sport, etc. and pick up nominalised 
expressions such as ‘infant primary schools’ or ‘mixed comprehensive schools’. Such 
expressions become relatively fixed until new cultural developments give rise to new 
combinations – something which is happening in all areas of life.

ADJECTIVES AND THE	
UNIT 51
ADJECTIVAL GROUP	
SUMMARY
1 	 AdjGs and typical AdvGs have potentially the same structure: head (clear, 
clearly), pre-modifier (very clear, very clearly) and post-modifier (very clear 
indeed, very clearly indeed).
2 	 Both AdjGs and AdvGs are frequently realised by the head element alone 
(a fast train; drive fast).
3 	 Their main functions and uses, however, are different. The AdjG typically 
provides information about people, places and things, while the adverb 
typically characterises the process expressed by the verb. For this reason 
we deal first with adjectives and the adjectival group, and later with 
adverbs and the adverbial group.
4 	 Formally, adjectives may be simple (tall, brilliant), prefixed (un-, im-, dis-, 
ab-), suffixed (-ful, -able, -ous, -ive), participial (-ing, -en) or compound 
(home-made, duty-free, sunburnt).
5 	 Syntactically, AdjGs typically function attributively as pre-modifier (in NG) 
(hot water) and predicatively as Complement of the Subject in clauses (the 
water is hot). In addition they can function as Complement of the Object 
(I like it hot) in clauses and, less commonly, in various other functions in 
groups and clauses.
6 	 Semantically, AdjGs can express a state (lonely), a quality (narrow), a 
sub-class (northern) or a property (creative). They can indicate an attitude 
(lovely, odious) or a judgement (true).
7 	 Many adjectives may take a complement in post-head position which 
completes their meaning (good at chess, glad (that) you came).

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
51.1  STRUCTURE AND CHARACTERISTIC USES OF THE 
ADJECTIVAL GROUP
The adjectival group is composed potentially of three structural elements: a head 
(h), a modifier (m) and a post-head element, which will be either a modifier (m) or a 
complement (c). Post-modifier and complement can occur together in the same AdjG. 
The basic structures are as follows:
	
AdjG
	
	
m 	
h 	
m 	
c
1 	
h 	
	
good
2 	
hc	
	
good	
	
at chess
3 	
mh	
very	
good
4 	
mhm	
very	
good	
indeed
5 	
mhmc	
very	
good	
indeed	
at chess
Figure 11.1  Structure of the adjectival group.
Other examples of full AdjG structures are:
extremely	 hot	
for this time of the year (mhm)
very	
glad	
that you won the match (mhc)
quite	
fond	
of music (mhc)
The difference between a post-modifier and a complement is that the complement is 
controlled by the adjectival head (good at . . . , fond of . . . , glad that . . . , glad to . . . etc.), 
whereas the post-modifier is not.
The head of an AdjG is always realised by an adjective, which may function alone in 
representation of a whole AdjG, as in The food was good.
The following blurb of a novel from The Review contains adjectives of different types. 
Mostly, they characterise NG referents in evaluative and emotive terms. By contrast, 
the classifying use is illustrated in best friends and new friend.
For as long as they can remember Ben and Olly have been best1 friends and close2 
neighbours. Then Carl moves into their street, Carl is bad.4 Carl is very bad.5 His games 
are rough,6 dangerous7 and strangely exciting.8 But soon Ben begins to wonder where 
their new9 friend is leading them.
51.2  SIMPLE, DERIVED AND COMPOUND ADJECTIVES
The most frequently used adjectives in English are monosyllabic, or disyllabic words 
of native origin. They tend to be paired as opposites such as good-bad, big-little, 
large-small, tall-short, black-white, easy-hard, soft-hard, dark-light, alive-dead, 
hot-cold, which have no distinctive form to mark them as adjectives.

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 2 3
Many adjectives, such as sandy, milky, are derived from nouns, other adjectives 
or verbs by the addition of certain characteristic suffixes. Some of these are of native 
origin, as in greenish, hopeful, handsome, handy, foremost, useless, while others are 
formed on Greek or Latin bases, as in central, secondary, apparent, civic, creative, and 
yet others via French such as marvellous and readable.
Suffixes typical of adjectives
-able, -ible 	
advisable, sensible	
-ical	
magical, political
-al, -ial 	
central, financial	
-ish	
feverish, yellowish
-ed	
paved, scared	
-ive	
active, attractive
-ful	
eventful, meaningful	
-less	
useless, meaningless
-ic	
tragic, frantic	
-ious, -ous	
luxurious, famous
	
	
-y 	
watery, risky, sugary 
Most adjectival prefixes are added to words which are already adjectives: unhappy, 
insecure, discourteous, abnormal, irrelevant. Some adjectives were formed by adding the 
prefix a- to an adjective (asleep, awake, ablaze, alive, alone, alike).
Many adjectives have compound forms composed of various classes of words, for 
example: 
noun + adjective	
tax-free (goods)
determinative + noun 	
all-American (girl)
number + noun 	
four-wheel (drive)
adverb + participle	
hard-earned (money, rest)
adverb + adverb 	
well-off (people)
phrase 	
state-of-the-art (stadium)
Adjectives in English are invariable in form. They are not marked for gender or number.
A long-haired dog, long-haired dogs; a tough character, tough characters
51.3  PARTICIPLES AND PARTICIPIAL ADJECTIVES
Participial adjectives commonly used as Verbal Groups
A large number of participial adjectives derived from transitive verbs can be used as 
modifiers in a NG and as Complements in a clause, while also retaining their ability to 
function as part of a VG: A confusing remark (m); That is confusing (Cs); You are confusing 
me (part of VG). Forms which can carry out these functions include the following:
-ing:	
annoying, exciting, frightening, surprising, boring, distressing, satisfying, 
tiring, misleading
-en:	
annoyed, excited, frightened, surprised, bored, distressed, satisfied, tired. 
misled 
Remember that -en symbolise both -ed and -en participle forms.

4 2 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
In both their attributive and predicative functions, these participial adjectives can be 
graded and intensified (→ 52.1 and 52.2):
	
Attributive	
Predicative
-ing:	 very encouraging news 	
the news is most encouraging 
-en:	
rather frightened tourists 	
the tourists seemed quite frightened
Participial adjectives seldom used in VGs
A small set of –ing forms are rarely or never used as part of a Verbal Group, but only as 
attributive or predicative adjectives:
-ing: interesting, amazing, charming, disappointing, pleasing
Pseudo-participial adjectives
An increasing number of adjectives are coined by adding -ing or -ed not to verbs but to 
nouns. These are termed pseudo-participial adjectives, such as:
-ing:	 enterprising, neighbouring, appetising, promising
-en:	
talented, skilled, gifted, bearded, detailed, jet-lagged
Participial modifiers
To distinguish the -ing adjectives from participial modifiers such as rising prices (→ 48.5), 
the following criterion is useful: if the -ing form cannot be graded, or intensified by very, 
as in 1, it will be considered a participial modifier. If it can be graded, or intensified by 
very, it is an adjective. Compare a sleeping child with a horrifying story:
1 	 (participial modifier) 	 *a more/*very sleeping child 	
*the child is more/
  very sleeping
2 	 (adjective) 	
a more/very horrifying story 	
the story is more/very 
  horrifying
Compound forms
Many participial forms are compounded with a noun, an adjective or an adverbial 
prefix:
-ing:	 heart-breaking news; good-looking girl; fast-selling magazines
-en:	
semi-skimmed milk; sun-tanned legs; well-known brands
Compound forms are extremely common in English, where new ones are freely 
coined every day. A variety of the possible forms that adjectives and modifiers take is 
illustrated in the following blurb from The Review:

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 2 5
In a rising Saudi Arabian city, far from weary, recession-scarred America, a struggling 
businessman pursues a last-ditch attempt to stave off foreclosure, pay his daughter’s col­
lege tuition, and finally do something great. Dave Eggers takes us around the world to 
show how one man fights to hold himself and his splintering family together in the face 
of the global economy’s gale-force winds. This taut, richly-layered, and elegiac novel 
is a powerful evocation of our contemporary moment – and a moving story of how we 
got here.
51.4  SEMANTIC CLASSES OF ADJECTIVES
As seen in Unit 48, when discussing modifiers of nouns, adjectives in use fall into two 
broad groups: those that describe the referent (descriptors) and those that sub-classify 
it (classifiers). Here we simply provide some further sub-types and examples of each, 
with the reminder that many adjectives have both uses (→ 48.5).
51.4.1  Descriptors
Such adjectives express the following types of meaning:
size, weight, extent: thick-thin, high-low, wide-narrow, deep-shallow, young-old
colour: blue, brown, grey, yellow, purple
shape: round, square, oval, oblong, triangular 
meanings related to time: new, recent, early, late, weekly, daily
evaluative: awesome (AmE), pretty, beautiful, nice, dreadful, shocking, 
state-of-the-art
an active or passive process: puzzling, surprising, soothing, worrying, broken, 
celebrated, exhausted
general qualities: warm-cool, full-empty, sweet-sour, strong-weak, bright-dull
a temporary state: alight, alone, awake, aghast, ajar (with predicative function 
only)
51.4.2  Classifiers
These are of three types:
restrictive: they restrict the referent of a noun in relation to another referent: 
average, additional, chief, complete, entire, final, following, initial, main, major, 
only, particular, primary, public, single, sole an only child, , the sole reason, the 
entire novel, her current boyfriend
relating to groups such as nationalities, religions, politics:
Brazilian, Christian, Muslim; Iraqi territory, Greek sculpture, the Western powers, 
African music

4 2 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
category-specific meanings associated with culture, technology, science, and so on.
heavy industry, light aircraft, the financial crisis, a nuclear plant, parliamentary 
debates
All these are listed more extensively according to topic in 48.5.
51.4.3  Degree emphasisers
In addition to these two main types, certain adjectives can function as degree empha- 
sisers with a strongly emotive tinge:
sheer nonsense; mere repetition; utter rubbish; a real mess; a true genius; absolute 
folly; a perfect fool; pure ignorance
Of these mere and utter have no other meaning as adjectives and cannot be used 
predicatively; the words real, true, absolute, perfect, sheer, pure can be used as central 
adjectives when they have qualitative, not restrictive, meaning as in a sheer cliff – the 
cliff is sheer; a true story – the story is true; pure water – this water is pure (→ 51.6).
51.5  SYNTACTIC FUNCTIONS OF THE ADJECTIVAL GROUP
AdjGs can realise functions in both group and clause structures, as follows:
AdjGs in groups
•	 (pre-)modifier in a NG:	
a very good actor, heavy rain, an old friend
•	 (post-)modifier in a NG	
something cheap, the person responsible
•	 head of a NG:	
the French, the sick, the most expensive
•	 complement of a preposition:	
at last, for good, in short
•	 modifier in an AdjG:	
bright red, pale blue, red hot
AdjGs in clauses
•	 Subject Complement:	
The acting was brilliant.
•	 Object Complement:	
I consider that offensive.
Peripheral AdjGs
•	 Stance Adjunct:	
Strange, I never suspected him.
•	 Detached predicative supplement:	
Angry and tearful, Susan walked out.
•	 Exclamation:	
Fine! Great! Right! Fantastic!
Among adjectives as modifiers, the type ‘a good actor’ constitutes a special use of 
certain adjectives, as in a slow reader, a hard worker, a big eater. This is sometimes 
called the process-oriented use, as the adjective doesn’t modify the noun directly, 
but rather the manner of performing the action. However, the manner of performing 

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 2 7
the action may become a characteristic feature of the entity: I’m a sound sleeper means, 
in effect, ‘I always sleep soundly’.
Stance Adjuncts make an evaluative comment on the content of the whole clause. 
In common use in this function are: odd, strange (Odd, I never noticed). Others such as 
More important still can also function as connectives between clauses.
Detached predicatives such as angry and tearful are a type of supplementive unit, 
that is, a unit used non-restrictively (→ 49.2) They are common in certain written 
genres and generally absent from conversation.
Adjectives as exclamations as in Great! can be considered as ellipted copula 
clauses: That’s great! That was awesome (AmE) 
51.6  CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL ADJECTIVES
Of these functions the most central are the attributive function, as modifier in the NG, 
and the predicative function, as Subject Complement in the clause. It is normal to 
classify as central those adjectives which fulfil these two functions, and as peripheral 
those which realise other functions, or only one, or neither of these central functions.
Central adjectives are also descriptors. They add information which fills out and 
enlivens the description of people, places and things. Central adjectives also play an 
important role as evaluators, expressing the subjective or objective evaluation of the 
speaker (→ 48.2).
By contrast, the classifiers, degree emphasisers and process-oriented adjectives are 
all peripheral.
Summarising, then, we have:
1	
Central adjectives: descriptors
2	
Predicative adjs only: afraid, asleep, ablaze, adrift, alive, alone, alike, aware, averse
3	
Attributive adjs only: these can be grouped into the following types:
•	
restrictive classifiers: the chief/main reason; sole responsibility; an only child
•	
time/space: the previous page; my old school; a new baby; your left leg
•	
associative classifiers: an agricultural college, foreign affairs, a nuclear weapon
•	
degree emphasisers: sheer nonsense; utter rubbish; an outright lie
•	
process-oriented: a big eater; a hard worker, a light sleeper, a slow reader
The following excerpt from Paris 1919 illustrates the latter and other uses of the adjective:
Although he (Lloyd George) was a wonderful conversationalist, he was also a very good 
listener. From the powerful to the humble, from adults to children, everyone who met 
him was made to feel that he or she had something important to say.
Most peripheral adjectives have a further restriction in that they cannot be graded or 
intensified: *very main, *extremely chief, *more utter. This also applies to adjectives func­
tioning as classifiers: *a very nuclear weapon, *a rather Egyptian mummy, *fairly prehis­
toric remains (→ Unit 52). However, as explained in Chapter 10, a number of classifying 
adjectives can also be used as descriptors and graded, some more easily than others: 
British exports (classifier), a very British attitude (descriptor).

DEGREES OF COMPARISON	
UNIT 52
AND INTENSIFICATION	
SUMMARY
1 	 Comparative and superlative forms in -er, -est and more, most, res­
pecti­vely. Irregular forms: better, best; worse, worst; farther/further, 
farthest/furthest. Comparative constructions with the + adjective. Structures 
of sufficiency (enough) and excess (too).
2	
Intensification: high: very, most, extremely, extra, seriously (stupid); 
medium: quite, rather, pretty, fairly (cool).
3 	 Attenuation: slightly (better), a little (different), a bit (salty); not very 
(good), hardly (likely).
4 	 Quantification: exact: one-mile; a mile (long); 2-foot-thick; 2 feet thick; 
3-year-old; 3 years old; non-exact: not that long; this big.
5 	 Description: by adjs: pale green, dark blue, deep red; by advs: strangely 
silent, cheerfully confident; by nouns: pitch black, paper-thin, world-wide.
6 	 Sub-modification: just as easy, really quite angry, far too expensive, 
quite old enough.
An important feature of central adjectives is that they are gradable, that is, the quality 
they express can be held in differing degrees. We can question and express the degree 
by a degree adverb How important is it? It is extremely important. Many descriptive 
adjectives are gradable, classifiers in general are not.
52.1  COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE DEGREES
When we want to express the notion that a person, thing or situation has more or less 
of a quality, we can mark a gradable adjective for comparative (1) or superlative (2) 
degree.

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 2 9
This is done grammatically in one of two ways: by inflection, adding -er and -est to 
the base form, or analytically by the adverbs more and most:
Base form	
Comparative	
Superlative
big	
bigger	
biggest	
(inflectional)
comfortable	 more comfortable	 most comfortable 	
(analytic)
Inflected forms are used with:
• 
Short adjectives of one syllable, and disyllabic adjectives ending in –y (hot–hotter–
hottest; old–older–oldest; easy–easier–easiest; ugly–uglier–ugliest). Exceptions are 
right, wrong and real.
The ugliest concrete building imaginable.
• 
Disyllabic adjectives in -ow (narrow, shallow, hollow, mellow) can be inflected, as 
can other short adjectives ending in weak syllables such as -le (simple, able, noble). 
Analytic forms are used with:
• 
adjectives of more than two syllables (e.g. encouraging); and
• 
adjectives which are already inflected (e.g. lovable, famous, greenish, pleased).
However, ease of pronunciation and smoothness of sound are important factors, and 
speakers sometimes improvise if the result sounds acceptable. Lewis Carroll, the crea­
tor of Alice in Wonderland, is said to have introduced ‘curiouser and curiouser’, which 
is still used, though jocularly, by some speakers.
Adjectives in -y which commonly take -er and -est include: happy, lazy, cosy, crazy, 
dirty, empty, lucky, nasty, pretty, silly, sexy, tidy, tricky. The letter ‘y’ is replaced by ‘i’ 
before an inflection: happier, luckiest.
The following adjectives have suppletive forms for grades 1 and 2:
good, better, best 	
far, farther, farthest
bad, worse, worst 	
far, further, furthest
The word further can also be used with the sense of ‘other’, ‘later’, ‘additional’:
The theatre is closed until further notice.
Asking and answering questions about degree
How old is he? He’ll be ten next May. He’s nine years eight months old now.
How old is this church? It must be at least four hundred years old.
Who is taller, you or your sister? I am taller, but James, our brother, is the tallest.

4 3 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
The adjectives elder, eldest (alternative to older, oldest) refer only to persons.
my elder son; our eldest daughter; an elder brother or sister
John is the elder of the two. 
I was the second eldest.
[FY1]
The adjective elderly is not comparative, but refers euphemistically to a person 
approaching old age. The comparative degree of certain other adjectives has the value 
of a classifier:
junior rank  (= low)	
inferior quality (= bad)

senior rank (= high)	
superior quality (= good)	 minor error (= small)

There are no inflections of lower and lowest degree corresponding to -er and -est. For 
this meaning less and least are used as modifiers. The following table summarises the 
grading options in English:

Figure 11.2  Grading options in English for comparative and superlative adjectives.
Adjectives and adverbs whose meanings are inherently superlative such as unique 
and perfect are prescriptively banned from comparative and superlative marking. They 
can be intensified by truly, absolutely, utterly, however, to express the highest degree of 
a quality:
The feeling is truly unique. It was a truly unique experience.
52.1.1  Functions of comparatives and superlatives
Adjectives graded for comparative and superlative degree can function both 
attributively and predicatively. Most descriptive adjectives are gradable: 
As modifiers of a noun
Have you got a larger size?
I think you need a more up-to-date stereo.

What’s the funniest joke you’ve heard recently?
It wasn’t the most exciting match of the season. 
The cleverest animals, as well as the better-looking, better-humoured and more classy, 
are not the ones holding the leads. 
(Philip Howard in The Times)
As Cs in clauses
This house is smaller, but it’s nicer, and it’s got a bigger garden.
I think we need something more central.
Inflected forms of the comparative are illustrated in this short extract from H.G. Wells’s 
A Short History of the World:
For a hundred years power has been getting cheaper and labour dearer. If for a genera­
tion or so machinery has had to wait its turn in the mine, it is simply because for a time 
men were cheaper than machinery.
52.1.2  The -er and -er construction
The repeated comparatives joined by and are used to express a gradually increasing 
degree of the quality denoted by the adjective (or adverb; → 56.1). Verbs of becoming 
such as become, get and grow are commonly used with adjectives. More and more occurs 
with adjectives which don’t admit the comparative inflection.
It’s growing darker and darker.
This crossword is getting more and more difficult.
52.1.3  The nice and construction
Nice and is often used in informal speech to intensify a second adjective: nice and hot, 
nice and cold, nice and dry. Good and is sometimes used in the same way.
52.1.4  The degree of sufficiency
This comprises three terms: ‘excess’, ‘sufficiency’, ‘insufficiency’, realised by the 
adverbs too, enough, not enough, respectively. When functioning predicatively, that is 
at Cs, the AdjG structure is as follows:
excess:	
This knife is too sharp.
sufficiency:	
Is this knife sharp enough?
insufficiency:	
This knife is not sharp enough.
When the AdjG modifies a count noun, the NG structures are as follows:

4 3 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
excess:	
This is too sharp a knife.
sufficiency:	
This is a sharp enough knife.
insufficiency:	 This is not a sharp enough knife./These are not sharp enough knives.
If the noun is uncountable or plural (e.g. weather, knives), only the predicative structure 
is used for the expression of ‘excess’:
excess:	
The weather was too wet. 	
*It was too wet weather.
	
These knives are too sharp. 	
*These are too sharp knives.
The degree of excess can be expressed by the lexical item over (AmE overly) used as a 
compound adjective: Don’t be over-anxious about the future.
52.2  INTENSIFYING THE ATTRIBUTE
Intensification is a kind of grading and will be described here in terms of three degrees: 
‘high’, ‘medium’ and ‘attenuated’. They constitute a cline rather than a scale of fixed 
points, since they are realised exclusively by lexical items rather than by varied 
structures. In spoken English, the intended degree of intensification can be reinforced 
by stress and intonation patterns.
52.2.1  High intensification
This is expressed by adverbs, adjectives and, exceptionally, nouns:
very:	
the very latest techniques	
That’s very kind of you
really:	
a really good film	
It was really good
awfully:	
an awfully nice man	
He looked awfully tired
most:	
a most extraordinary performance	
His ideas are most odd
way:	
I am way concerned about the environment (AmE) (Cs only)
Some intensifiers, such as very and extremely, can intensify almost any adjective. Others 
are more limited to specific types of adjectives or to individual ones. The original 
meaning of some high intensifiers has undergone semantic change. For example, 
terrifically indicates approval, awfully, terribly and jolly (informal BrE) can intensify both 
good and bad qualities, while dreadfully and horribly are used only with bad ones. The 
following are common collocations:
dripping wet; boiling hot; freezing cold; blind drunk; stone deaf; wide awake; fast 
asleep; frozen stiff; extra special; fully aware; raving mad; highly controversial; 
radically opposed; eminently suitable; deeply moving; seriously stupid; hugely 
successful; supremely confident; terrifically good-looking; horribly disfigured.
Quite, which normally expresses a medium degree of intensification, can express a 
high degree in the sense of indicating a complete degree or extent to which something 
is the case: I stood quite still. To convey this meaning, quite is spoken with higher 

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 3 3
pitch and emphasis. Quite always takes on a high degree when it modifies an emotive 
adjective as in quite amazing, quite incredible, quite disastrous.
medium intensification: He looks quite different in his everyday clothes.
high intensification: You are quite right.
52.2.2  Medium intensification
A medium degree of intensification is expressed by the four adverbs quite, pretty, 
rather, fairly. Within the medium degree, we can recognise four sub-degrees in order of 
descending intensification:
It’s quite cold here in winter.
It’s rather cold here in winter.
It’s pretty cold here in winter. (informal, spoken style)
It’s fairly cold here in winter.
Quite denotes moderate but unequivocal intensification of the adjective, whether this 
is appreciative as in quite pleased, quite satisfactory, quite nice, unappreciative as in quite 
dangerous, quite pessimistic, quite nasty, or neutral as in quite tall, quite cheap/expensive.
She felt there was something not quite right about the room. 
It’s quite straightforward to Carlisle – just follow the signs.
In informal speech that as intensifier adds the factor of being contrary to expectation:
I didn’t expect it to be that cheap.
Politeness or lack of certainty are often the motivations of the use of quite, as in I’m not 
quite sure. Quite is used to modify not only adjectives but also verbs and adverbs: I don’t 
quite know, I didn’t quite understand.
Rather can lower the force of a statement by indicating a certain limited degree, as 
in it looks rather difficult. It becomes related to indirectness (→ Chapter 4) when used 
in situations which warrant a stronger word such as very or extremely. Politeness is 
sometimes the motivation for the use of rather, for example, to avoid direct criticism 
of others, I’m rather worried about your exam results, or to mitigate the expression of the 
speaker’s own emotions, as in I was rather pleased at winning the lottery. At the same 
time it implies that a larger degree or extent is to be understood, for instance very 
worried, very pleased. This ability to say one thing while implying another makes rather 
a subtle tool in interpersonal interaction. Rather is a word that has contributed greatly 
to the notion of ‘English understatement’, as in:
Buying that second-hand car may turn out to be a rather costly mistake.
Pretty expresses the notion of quite but not completely. It is used with all types of gradable 
adjective, but has an approximative value characteristic of informal speech; e.g. She’s 
pretty good-looking, I feel pretty tired after that long walk, That film was pretty awful, don’t 

4 3 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
you think? Like rather, it can also imply a stronger degree, especially when expressing 
a negative evaluation: That paper of his was a pretty poor effort (= very poor). The 
idiomatic combinations pretty well, pretty much can modify certain adjectives and 
determinatives, for instance, pretty well impossible, pretty much the same.
He’s going to have a pretty bad headache for a while, and the cut is pretty deep, 
so it’s bound to be sore
[JXW]
Fairly as a modifier indicates an almost large or reasonable degree of a quality 
(fairly accurate, fairly well-off). It can be used more easily with favourable and neutral 
adjectives than with strongly unfavourable ones, as with fairly honest, fairly intelligent, 
fairly reasonable, but not ?fairly dishonest, ?fairly foolish, ?fairly unreasonable:
He seems to have a fairly good idea of what he wants to do.
Other adverbs which suggest that something is very close to having the quality named 
are: almost, nearly, roughly, approximately, partly, largely.
The following ironical statement illustrates a normal everyday use of intensified 
adjectives in English:
A remarkable entirely new economic cure-all has just emerged from widely intensive 
tests. The miracle drug, called taxcuts, is the most versatile drug since penicillin. If 
applied in sufficiently liberal doses, it will make people more hard-working and less 
worried about their financial problems.
52.2.3  Attenuation
Attenuation refers to a slight degree of the quality or its entire absence, and is expressed 
as follows:
slightly better 	
a little disappointing 	
a bit salty
kind of weird 	
sort of greyish hair 	
somewhat odd (formal)
Sort of and kind of are used, in very informal English, when the speaker is uncertain 
how to express the exact quality of something.
At all can be used as an attenuator in yes/no interrogative, negative and conditional 
clauses, as a politeness strategy in the case of conditionals. It is placed before or after 
the adjective:
Are you at all worried? Are you worried at all?
We’d like to stay another week, if it’s at all possible.
Slight attenuation or reservation can be expressed by negating a high degree:
not very likely	
not quite sure of her name
not entirely true 	
not particularly fond of insects

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 3 5
The following modifiers express in 1 a minimal degree of attribution and often imply a 
certain degree of the opposite quality; in 2 they express absence or denial of the quality 
named:
1 	 hardly likely, barely necessary, scarcely believable, none too happy
2 	 I’m not at all surprised at the result, or, I’m not surprised at all at the result.
52.3  QUANTIFYING MODIFIERS
Exact quantification
If we ask the questions How old is she? How long was the queue? How high is Everest? 
How bad was the traffic-jam? the depth, length, height and age can be measured or 
quantified by saying:
She is 20 years old.	
The queue was 100 yards long.
Everest is 8,708 metres high.	
The cars were four deep on the motorway.
These AdjGs can be lexicalised as compound adjectives to modify nouns:
a twenty-year-old girl	
a hundred-yard-long queue
an 8,708-metre-high mountain 	
a four-deep traffic-jam on the motorway
Non-exact quantification
With predicative function, non-measurable quantification is expressed by the 
determinatives the, that, this, any, all, little and no, as in:
Things are not getting any better. Well, as long as they’re not getting any worse . . . 
The situation is no worse than it was before. The trip wasn’t that interesting after all.
We need a box this big. (with a suitable gesture) 
She looked all upset.
52.4  DESCRIPTIVE MODIFIERS
If adjectives serve to describe nouns, they themselves can also be described, by 
reference to (a) a quality or (b) a specific context:
(a)	 Qualitative modification of adjectives is realised by the following classes of units:
-ly adverbs:	
strangely attractive; deathly pale; reasonably friendly 
adjectives:	
light brown; deep red; dark blue; vivid green; bright yellow
nouns: 	
pitch black; emerald green; rose pink; paper-thin; feather-light; 
day-long; world-wide

4 3 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Note that an expression like a strangely attractive city does not mean ‘a strange and 
attractive city’ but ‘a city which is attractive in a strange way’; it is the adjective (attractive) 
which is modified, not the noun (city). The structure ‘adj + adj’ (e.g. light brown) is used 
especially with colour adjectives. When it modifies a noun, ambiguity may occur: The 
deep blue sea (a sea of deep blue? or a deep sea which is blue?)
(b)	 Relational modification indicates the sense in which the adjective is to be under­
stood. It is realised by:
-ly adverbs:	 socially 
acceptable; 
economically 
difficult; 
technologically 
impressive; financially independent; physically challenged
nouns: 	
music-mad; foot-weary; duty-free
52.5  SUB-MODIFYING THE ADJECTIVE
Modifiers of degree (e.g. less in less interesting) are often themselves graded or intensified 
by a sub-modifier (sm) placed before them, e.g. rather less interesting. The following are 
examples of this smmh structure which occur in both spoken and written discourse.
Sm 	
m 	
h
sm 	
m 	
h
not	
quite	
right
much	
more	
productive
far 	
too	
expensive
only	
too	
pleased
not	
nearly as	
nice
just	
as	
complicated
This type of AdjG structure reflects two converse types of intensification which are 
characteristic of many English speakers: (a) That of attenuating the negative value 
of an Attribute, as in 1, and (b) that of reinforcing a positive value, as in 2:
1 	 This time the results are not quite so clear-cut.
[KRL]
2 	 We would be only too pleased to provide information on the Association. 

[GX9]
As is usually the case, enough is placed immediately after the adjective:
hardly good enough; not nearly clever enough; quite old enough

COMPLEMENTATION OF	
UNIT 53
THE ADJECTIVE	
SUMMARY
1 	 When an adjective (e.g. happy) functions in a clause as Complement of 
the Subject (e.g. I am happy) or of the Object, it is often followed by a 
complement relating it to a fact (e.g. that you are here), a process (e.g. 
to see you), or a circumstance (e.g. about your success). This information 
indicates the way in which the adjective is to be understood and is 
expressed mainly by finite and non-finite clauses, and by prepositional 
phrases (PPs).
2 	 When the complement is a PP, the preposition is determined by the 
adjective and the context: dependent on, clever at, clever with, fond of 
(→ Chapter 12).
3 	 When the adjective is modified (graded, intensified, etc.), the modifier 
partly determines the type of complement or post-modifier: too cold for us, 
too cold to swim, too cold for us to swim, too cold for swimming in the sea.
4 	 When the adjective modifies a NG, it is separated from its complement: 
too difficult a problem to solve.
53.1  ADJECTIVAL COMPLEMENTS
All adjectives which can take complements indicate the speaker’s or writer’s stance 
with respect to the proposition stated in the complement. They comprise three 
semantic types: epistemic (sure, certain, etc.), affective (glad, sorry, etc.) and evaluative 
(right, wrong, etc.).
53.1.1  Complementation by finite clauses
Adjectives which take embedded that- clauses indicate the speaker’s or writer’s stance 
with respect to what is expressed in the complement. Semantically, they fall into two 
main types:

4 3 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
degrees of certainty, such as: sure, certain, positive, convinced
affective meanings, such as: glad, sorry, happy, sad, afraid, grateful, pleased, 
amazed, annoyed
After some adjectives of emotive or modal meaning, such as anxious, willing, eager, 
insistent, determined, essential, the non-factual auxiliary should (in Br E), or the subjunctive 
(especially in Am E), can be used in the that-clause to suggest a present or future 
action. An indicative is used by some speakers, as in 3 (→ 11.1).
1 	 The public is anxious that the truth should be known (BrE)/be known (AmE).
2 	 We are not willing that justice should be forgotten(BrE)/be forgotten(AmE).
3 	 Bill’s wife is insistent that he give/gives up smoking. 
Certain adjectives such as clear can take a wh- complement clause, as in:
It is not clear what you mean.
53.1.2  Complementation by non-finite clauses
This AdjG structure is used to describe the relation between an Attribute and a situation. 
The Attribute and situation both refer to the same Subject in examples (a–g) below:
(a)	 The adjective evaluates the act performed by the subject:
She must be strong-willed to have survived such an ordeal.
(b)	 The adjective expresses an emotion caused by the situation:
Everyone was sorry to hear about the accident.
(c)	 The adjective expresses an attitude or state concerning the act/situation:
The police are powerless to take action in this matter.
(d)	 The adjective expresses a property of the subject:
Are these pamphlets free to take away?
(e)	 The adjective forms part of a lexical auxiliary (be sure to, be likely to, be bound to) in 
a VG (→ 37.3). It denotes a degree of certainty or the tendency of the process to 
occur. The subject is a ‘raised subject’ (→ 37.4):
He is sure to arrive late.	
It is bound to rain.
(f)	 The adjective evaluates the process realised by an -ing clause or a to-inf:
He must have been crazy driving/to drive as fast as that.

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 3 9
(g)	 The following example refers to a process not performed by the Subject:
Smoking is hard/difficult to give up.
This sentence does not mean that smoking is difficult, but that to give up smoking is 
difficult. Structurally, it is a ‘raised object’ (→ 37.4).
53.1.3  Prepositional phrase complements
Especially in conversation, where speakers can assume a knowledge of what has been 
said, it is frequently unnecessary to add a complement. We can say I was angry, we 
were anxious, everyone was delighted without specifying the reason. In writing, however, 
we often need to make the motivation more specific.
We here offer a small representative selection of everyday examples. These are 
grouped according to the preposition and the types of meaning conveyed by the 
adjective.
  1	 adjective + about is used for emotional reaction to something:
mad about music	
	
concerned about his safety
  2	 adjective + at has two meanings: (a) emotional reaction to something or someone, 
and (b) an ability:
(a) alarmed at the news	
	
indignant at the accusation 
(b) clever at getting what he wants 	
hopeless at remembering names
	
Other adjectives used with at: (a) pleased, annoyed (b) bad, brilliant, terrible, adept, 
skilled, marvellous
  3	 adjective + by (with adjectives derived from past participles and passive in 
meaning):
puzzled by the question	
worried by their failure to return
  4	 adjective + for means the value the adjective has for something or someone:
good for the health 	 responsible for their welfare
  5	 adjective + from has two meanings: (a) separation and distancing; (b) effect–cause:
(a) remote from civilisation 	
different from everyone else
(b) sleepless from anxiety 	
tired from overworking
  6	 adjective + in is used for an existing or resulting state:
dressed in white 	
	
lost in thought

4 4 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
  7	 adjective + of is used for (a) mental state in terms of the antagonist or process; (b) 
mental state in terms of the protagonist; (c) containment:
(a)	 afraid of wild animals 	
capable of great concentration
(b)	 kind of you 	
stupid of him
(c)	 full of enthusiasm 	
sick of it all
	
The (b) sequence occurs in clauses beginning It is + adjective + extraposed subject:
It is kind of you to take such trouble. 	 It was stupid of him to lose the keys.
  8	 adjective + on is used for dedication, dependence or aim:
keen on sport 	
intent on divorce
  9	 adjective + to means (a) mental state or attitude related to a phenomenon; (b) 
equivalence, similarity or comparison:
(a)	 opposed to innovation 	
kind to old people; accustomed to hardship
(b)	 similar to the others 	
equal to half a kilo
10	 adjective + with can be (a) emotional reaction or physical state due to a cause, or 
(b) property or ability:
(a)	 fed up with the weather 	 pale with fear
(b)	 skilful with his hands 	
good with children
	
Note that 2(b) describes ability in relation to the task; 10(b) describes ability in rela­
tion to the tools or raw material.
11	 adjective + beyond means to an extreme degree (with non-count nouns):
cruel beyond endurance	
injured beyond recovery
The following extract from Roald Dahl’s Boy illustrates the use of adjectives and their 
grading:
Fives is possibly the fastest ball-game on earth, far faster than squash, and the little ball 
ricochets around the court at such a speed that sometimes you can hardly see it. You 
need a swift eye, strong wrists and a very quick pair of hands to play fives well . . . 
53.2  DEGREE COMPLEMENTS
When the adjective is graded, the complement is dependent, not on the adjective 
directly, but on the grading element (-er, more, less, as, etc.), and is realised according 

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 4 1
to the type and structure of the grading element. The following examples serve as a 
brief summary of this area of English grammar.
Comparative degree
This takes one of two forms: either adjective + -er + than, or more/less + adjective + 
than, plus a word, phrase or clause:
Adj + -er + than + PP 	
It was cooler than in Russia
Adj + -er + than + clause 	
It was better than we expected
more + adj + than + AdvG	
It was more comfortable than usual
less + adj + than + clause 	
It was less complicated than any of us expected
more + adj. + than + -ing clause 	 It was more enjoyable than travelling by air
Superlative degree
Adj + -est + PP (in)	
It is the longest in the world
most + adj + PP (of)	
It is the most famous of all his plays
least + adj + that-clause 	
It is the least interesting novel (that) I have ever read
Degree of equality
as + adj + as +AdvG 	
It was as lovely as ever
neg + as + adj + as + clause 	
It was not as easy as most of us expected
so + adj + as + to-clause 	
It was so difficult as to be impossible
If the comparison is between two adjectives, the complement of equality is realised by 
a finite clause:
She is as good-looking as she is intelligent.
*She is as good-looking as intelligent.
If the comparison is negative, the modifier not as may be replaced by not so, though so 
suggests intensification besides equality: In winter, London is not as/so cold as New 
York.
Degree of sufficiency (enough) and excess (too)
Heads modified by postposed enough and preposed by too are qualified by similar units 
to the above:
Sufficiency:	
Adj + enough + PP 	
Is the water hot enough for you?
	
Adj + enough + to-cl 	
Is the water hot enough to take a 
  shower?
	
Adj + enough + PP + to-cl 	
Is the water hot enough for you to take a 
  shower?

4 4 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Excess:	
Too + adj + PP	
This coffee is too hot for me.
	
Too + adj + to-cl	
This coffee is too hot to drink. (not 
  *to drink it)
	
Too + adj + PP + to-cl 	
This coffee is too hot for me to drink. 
  (not *for me to drink it)
If the to-infinitive verb is prepositional (e.g. think about), the preposition is stranded 
(see 6.3.3):
To-inf cl + prep. 	
Your project is too expensive to think about. (*about it)
	
This knife is too blunt to cut with. (*with it)
Notice the emotive use of too in expressions such as: The film was too awful for words! 
and its equivalence to very in: I shall be only too pleased to help you (= very pleased).
53.2.1  Discontinuous degree complements
A degree complement is separated from its adjective when the AdjG pre-modifies a 
noun. The AdjG is said to be discontinuous, as in examples 1 and 2 below.
1 	 It was the most comfortable journey (that) we have ever made.
2 	 It’s as nice a country garden as you could ever find.
When an adjective is graded by a modifier, e.g. more convinced, one complement may 
relate to the modifier as in more (convinced) than I was, and a second one to the head, as 
in (more) convinced of the man’s guilt. They may be placed in either order, the emphasis 
normally being on the second one:
The judge seemed more convinced than I was of the man’s guilt.
The judge seemed more convinced of the man’s guilt than I was.
If one complement is notably longer than the other(s), it is usually placed at the end:
The judge seemed more convinced than I was by the evidence that had been given 
by one of the witnesses.
*The judge seemed more convinced of the man’s guilt after listening to the 
evidence given by one of the witnesses than I was.
When complements are coordinated by and, but, or, they are often of the same class 
form:
to-inf cl: 	
The programme was delightful to watch and to listen to.

ADVERBS AND THE	
UNIT 54
ADVERBIAL GROUP	
SUMMARY
1 	 AdvGs have certain general characteristics similar to those of AdjGs:
• 
Potentially three structural forms: a head, a modifier, and a 
post-head
• 
element, which may be a post-modifier or a complement.
• 
They are frequently represented by the head element alone.
• 
Morphologically, the adverbial head may be simple, derived or 
compound.
• 
Semantically, many adverbs express qualities of processes and situa­
tions, just as adjectives express qualities of people and things.
• 
Not all adjectives and adverbs have the potential of heading a group 
structure: e.g. mere, merely; sole, solely.
2 	 In other respects, AdvGs are different from AdjGs:
	
Adverbs are a more heterogeneous word class, and can be roughly 
grouped into three main semantic sets:
• 
circumstantial: place, time, manner
• 
degree or focus
• 
connective: addition, reinforcement, result, concession, and the like 
	
Many adverbs fulfil several functions, however, and their meanings may 
change according to the function.
54.1  STRUCTURE AND GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE 
ADVERBIAL GROUP
The structure of the adverbial group is similar to that of the adjectival group; that is, it is 
composed potentially of three elements: the head h, the modifier m and the post- head 
element, either m (post-modifier) or c (complement). These elements combine to form 
the following four basic structures:

4 4 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
	
AdvG	
	
	
1	
h	
	
yesterday	
2a	 h	
	
early	
2b	 hm	
	
early	
in the morning
3	
mh	
very	
early	
4	
mhm	
very	
early	
in the morning
Other examples of full AdvG structures are:
	
mhc	
more	
slowly	
than necessary
	
mhc	
far	
away	
from civilisation
	
mhc	
so	
fast	
(that) I couldn’t catch him
	
mhc	
quite	
clearly	
Enough
The head element is always realised by an adverb. The modifier (→ 56.1–2) is realised 
typically by grading and intensifying adverbs, as in these examples, and less typically 
by quantifiers (ten miles across). The complement (→ 56.3) expresses the scope or con­
text of the meaning expressed by the head (e.g. luckily for us); alternatively, it can serve 
to define the modifier more explicitly (e.g. more correctly than before).
54.2  FORMS OF ADVERBS
Morphologically, English adverbs are either simple, derived or compound.
Simple forms
These are words of one or two syllables, usually of native origin, that are not com- 
pounded and do not have derivational affixes. Examples:
now,	
 then, 	
here, 	
there, 	 far, 	
near, 	
soon, 	 as, 	
such, 
pretty,	
quite, 	
rather, 	
else, 	
well, 	
even, 	
ever, 	 ago.
Many adverbial forms also function as prepositions However, prepositions are best 
contrasted with adverbial particles: up, down, in, out, on, off, over, away, back, and 
so on, in their directional use of ‘path’, among others: walk down the street – walk down; 
get off the bus – get off (→ 40.2).
Adverbs are also used to form complex prepositions, such as far from, as well as, instead of.
Certain simple adverbs have the same form as the corresponding adjective:
A hard worker – he works hard	
a fast car – she drives fast
An early arrival – we arrived early	
a late performance – we left late 
Derived forms
• 
Those formed from adjectives by the addition of the suffix -ly include:

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 4 5
badly, carefully, happily, fairly, freely, slowly, principally, honestly, cheerfully, sadly, 
suddenly, warmly
• 
Some adjectives already have the -ly suffix (friendly, likely, princely, daily, weekly, 
monthly, annually), and this form is also that of the adverb. That is to say, another 
-ly suffix is not added: we don’t say *monthlily.
• 
Some  adjective–adverb pairs  have quite unrelated meanings:
hard–hardly; bare–barely; scarce–scarcely; present–presently; late–lately; short–
shortly, wide–widely
We had hardly /barely /scarcely opened the door when all the lights went out.
• 
Furthermore, some of these adverbs have different meanings with and without-ly:
All the windows were wide open.	
‘Open wide’, said the dentist to the boy.
He is widely recognised as an expert.	 His books are widely available.
The interview was cut short to issue an emergency flood warning and was resumed 
shortly after.
They started late and finished late. None of the family has heard from Richard lately 
(recently).
• 
A few adverbs in -ly are not derived from adjectives: accordingly, namely, jokingly, 
among others.
• 
Certain very common adjectives expressing very basic meanings don’t lend 
themselves to adverb formation: big, small, young, old, tall, tiny, fat, among others.
• 
Those formed from nouns, by the addition of -wise, -ways, -ward(s), include:
• 
clockwise, moneywise; sideways, lengthways; backward(s), forward(s). (AmE without ‘s’)
• 
A small group of adverbs beginning a- indicate mainly position or direction: 
about, above, across, again, ahead, along, aloud, apart, around, aside, away. Ago, by 
contrast, is used with units of time: a few minutes ago, centuries ago.
• 
Another small set of adverbs has be- as first syllable, also indicating position 
or direction: before, behind, below, beneath, besides, between, beyond. These can 
also function as prepositions: I’ve been here before (adv.); It was before the war 
(prep.).
Compound forms
There are two types:
•	
shortened forms of what were originally PPs: downhill, indoors, inside, outside, 
downstairs, overhead, overall, overnight, and others;
•	
combinations with other classes of word: somewhere (AmE someplace,) 
anywhere, nowhere, everywhere; however, moreover, nevertheless; anyway, 
anyhow.

4 4 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Phrasal adverbs are those which do not form compounds, but consist of more than 
one word: of course; at all; kind of, sort of; in fact; as well.
54.3  TYPES OF MEANINGS EXPRESSED BY ADVERBIAL GROUPS
Adverbs express five broad types of meaning in clauses and groups: circumstantial, 
stance, degree, focusing, connective. As with many adjectives and other word 
classes, however, the meaning of a particular adverb must be seen together with its 
function in context. The literal meaning of many adverbs can become figurative, or 
completely different, when used as an intensifier. So, although far is listed in section 
A (below) as meaning distance, Don’t go too far, it expresses degree in Prices won’t go 
down very far. When it functions as an intensifier it takes on a meaning similar to much: 
far too short, a far nicer place, while so far expresses time, similar to up to now.
A  Circumstantial adverbs: where, when and how things happen
Space
Position: 	
Put the chairs here/outside/upstairs. An away match.
Direction: 	
Push it inwards/down/through/out/away. The trip back.
Distance: 	
Don’t go too far/near/close.
Time
Moment: 	
They will be coming tomorrow/sometime/then/soon/later. 
Frequency: 	
The doctor came once/daily/frequently/now and again.
Duration: 	
We didn’t stay long. We spoke briefly.
Relation: 	
The taxi will arrive soon. It isn’t here yet.
Sequence: 	
first, second, next, then, last, finally.
Manner
Hold it carefully.
Domain
The concert was a success artistically but not financially.
B  Stance: expressing a personal angle
Certainty, doubt: 	
You are certainly right. Perhaps I’m wrong.
Evidential: 	
Apparently, they emigrated to Australia.
Viewpoint: 	
We are in good shape financially, and healthwise, too. 
Emphasis: 	
He is plainly just a creep. Indeed he is.
Judgement:	
The Minister has wisely resigned.
Attitude: 	
Thankfully, it didn’t rain. Hopefully, it will be fine tomorrow.

C  Degree adverbs: comparing, intensifying
Comparison: 	
This is the most/the least efficient scanner we’ve had so far. 
Intensification: 	
He lives all alone but seems quite/fairly/pretty happy. 
Attenuation: 	
It was kind of strange to see her again.
Approximation: 	
There were about/roughly/more or less 20 people there. 
Sufficiency:	
Is the water hot enough?
Excess: 	
Well, actually, it’s too hot.
D  Focusing adverbs: restricting the scope
Restriction: 	
That is merely a detail. He is just interested in money.
	
He hardly ate anything, only a yoghurt.
Reinforcement: 	
The hotel had everything, even a fitness centre.
Even is a scalar adverb which carries an implication that the unit modified by even is 
either high or low on a scale of expectedness, in the context. In the example, a fitness 
centre is higher than expected, as not all hotels have a fitness centre. In he wouldn’t 
stay even for one day, it is implied that one day is a shorter stay than had been expected. 
Both are interpreted as slightly surprising.
E  Connective adverbs: logical connection
Sequence: 	
First, we have no money, and second, we have no time. 
Reinforcement: 	
The house is small and besides/furthermore has no garden. 
Conclusion: 	
It was a tiring trip, but altogether very interesting.
Restating: 	
We’ve got two pets, namely a rabbit and a canary.
Reason: 	
I couldn’t find you, so I left.
Condition: 	
Take an umbrella; otherwise (= if not), you’ll get wet.
Clarification:	
He wants to live abroad, or rather anywhere away from home.
Contrast: 	
They accept his invitations, yet they run him down.
Alternation: 	
There’s no tea. Would you like a cup of coffee instead?
Concession: 	
What you said was true; still it was unkind.
Attention-seeking:	
Now, you listen to me! Now then, what’s all this about?
Technical description often makes use of adverbs of degree and quantity as in the 
following extract from an elementary textbook on Metals by H. Moore.
Some metals are used in a relatively7 pure state, for example aluminium, whose light­
ness and corrosion-resistance make it especially8 useful. But metals are used mostly9 
with other elements to form alloys and so10 in this way their properties can be improved 
and their range of uses widely11 extended.

SYNTACTIC FUNCTIONS OF	
UNIT 55
ADVERBS AND ADVERBIAL GROUPS	
SUMMARY
1	
Just as adverbs express many meanings, they also realise many kinds of 
syntactic functions:
• 
as Adjunct in the clause;
• 
as stance adjuncts associated with whole clauses;
• 
as connectives between clauses.
• 
as modifiers, and complements in AdjGs, AdvGs, NGs, VGs and PPs;
2 	 Some adverbs have fixed position; others are mobile between initial, 
middle and end positions.
3 	 Some adverbs vary their meaning according to their functional role, so just 
may denote an event near to speech time, We’ve just finished, or be used 
to intensify, as in That’s just fine.
55.1  SUMMARY OF THE SYNTACTIC FUNCTIONS OF ADVERBS 
AND ADVERBIAL GROUPS
Adverbs have three main functions:
• 
as Adjunct in clause structures;
• 
as modifier in group structures; and
• 
as connectives between clauses.
In clause structures
I knew her pretty well.	
Adjunct 
Thankfully, no-one was injured.	
Stance adjunct
So you don’t want to come, then.	
Inferential connective
Everyone rushed out.

55.2  POSITIONS OF ADVERBS IN THE CLAUSE: INITIAL, MIDDLE 
AND FINAL
In their function as modifier in group structure, adverbs occupy fixed positions. In their 
function as adjuncts, however, adverbs are mobile, occupying initial, middle or end 
positions, as the following examples show:
1 	 Really, I don’t like driving.
2 	 I really don’t like driving.
3	
I don’t really like driving.
4 	 I don’t like driving, really.
Not all adjunctive adverbs are equally mobile. The choice of position is determined by 
its type (circumstantial, modal, degree, etc.), the scope of its meaning (whole clause 
or part of a clause), the degree of emphasis the speaker wishes to give to it, and the 
general information structure of the clause (→ Chapter 6).
55.2.1  Adverbs in initial position
When an adverb is placed in initial position as adjunct, its scope extends to the whole 
clause. In this position, the meaning may be one of two broad kinds:
• 
It may be ‘fronted’ (→ 28.8), that is transferred from its normal position to function 
as what is traditionally called a ‘sentence adjunct’, having the same status as the 
other clause elements, though referring to them all together, as in:
Slowly, the rising sun appeared over the distant horizon.

4 5 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
• 
It may function as (1) a stance adjunct, expressing the speaker’s attitude to the 
content of the clause or (2) a comment on its truth value 2. Stance adjuncts stand 
outside the clause structure (→ Chapter 2), separated by a comma.
Seriously, though, you ought to devote more time to preparing for your exams.
Honestly, where we live, we couldn’t do without a car.
Honestly and other similar adverbs such as seriously, frankly, may also function as 
adjuncts of manner, within the clause:
He doesn’t seem to take exams seriously, does he?
55.2.2  Scope of reference of adverbs as adjuncts
The different positions an adverb may occupy determine the scope of its reference. 
Compare the examples at the start of section 55.2, all containing the adverb really. In 1 
the scope of the adverb comprises the whole sentence, with the adverb fully focused. 
In 2 the scope of really covers less than the whole, but includes the negative auxiliary 
(don’t). Negation is here focused even more than in 3. In 4, as in 1, the adverb is 
parenthetical, separated from the clause. In such cases really functions as a stance 
adverb whose scope comprises the whole clause, the first strongly, the second weakly, 
as if it were an afterthought.
Other elements are sometimes focused, for example by restrictive adverbs: He 
alone, f or your eyes only.
55.2.3  Adverbs of place, time and manner
Adverbs referring to the place, time and manner of an event are placed most naturally 
in final position. This is equivalent to ‘immediately after the verb’. When there is a 
direct object, however, the adverb must be placed after the object, as in 1 and 2:
1 	 I didn’t expect you so early.
2 	 We caught the bus easily. Not *We caught easily the bus.
This is because in English, unlike some languages, an object is not separated from the 
verb which selects it, even by adjuncts of degree:
I like apples very much.	
Not *I like very much apples.
The only exception to this is when the direct object is exceptionally long and so 
requires end-focus (→ 29.3).
Indefinite time adverbs such as sometimes, eventually, immediately, finally, recently, 
previously, can be placed in final, pre-verbal or initial position. Again separation of 
verb–object is excluded:
(a)	 He stopped the machine immediately.
(b)	 He immediately stopped the machine.

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 5 1
(c)	 Immediately, he stopped the machine.
(d)	 *He stopped immediately the machine.
Of these, (a) is the normal unmarked position, (b) focuses on the process stop, and (c) 
on the whole of the clause. By contrast, (d) is unacceptable.
Certain adverbs of frequency – always, never, seldom, hardly ever, often, rarely, 
sometimes, usually – do not normally occur in initial position; instead they are placed 
between Subject and Predicator or between operator and main verb.
They always spend their holidays abroad. (*Always they spend . . . ) 
We have never been to Africa. (*Never, we have . . . )
Lawyers often love to tell you about how good they are.
[J75] 
The adverbs of negative import – never, seldom, rarely, hardly ever – are occasionally 
fronted and followed by Subject–operator inversion for purposes of emphasis, though 
this structure is formal in style or emphatic (→ 28.10.1):
Rarely does one find such kindness nowadays.
Never in my life have I heard such crazy ideas!
The adverbs still, yet, already express certain time relationships which are described 
briefly and illustrated in the table (→ 55.2.4.) with question-and-answer structures 
which show their contrasting meanings.
The examples given of these three adverbs show that their scope of meaning 
extends to the process or the whole predicate, and for this reason they normally occur 
in mid- or end-position.
Finally we may observe the similarity of meaning of still and yet in a be + to-infinitive 
structure, and as concessive connectives:
He’ll make a champion of you yet/still.
A cure for chronic bronchitis is still/yet to be found. It was a hard climb. Still, it was 
worth it. (concessive)
He’s rather uncommunicative, yet everyone seems to like him. (concessive)
Spatial adverbs such as abroad, across, back, everywhere, downstairs, inside, uphill, 
forwards, sideways, expressing position and direction, are normally placed after the 
Predicator or in end-position: Push it forwards; turn it sideways.
Adverbs of manner
The unmarked position for adverbs of manner is at the end of the clause, as in He speaks 
English fluently, not *He speaks fluently English. If the Object is long, and the adverb is a 
single word, the Od may be placed at the end, as in He speaks fluently several European 
and oriental languages. If the adverb is modified or complemented, it may still occupy 
end-position, according to the principles of end-focus and end-weight (→ 30.3.2) even 
if the Od is also long:

4 5 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
He speaks English fluently.
He speaks several European and oriental languages as well as Arabic very fluently 
indeed.
Adverbs in -ly include many of manner: carefully, easily, correctly, cheaply, politely, 
peacefully, urgently, and also some emotive ones: angrily, gladly, desperately. Both 
can also occur as adjuncts in mid-position, before the lexical verb. Together such 
combinations constitute a useful pattern, as they lend force to what immediately 
follows:
We sincerely hope you enjoyed your stay with us.
I have been seriously thinking of changing my job. I will gladly help you if you 
need me.
55.2.4  Adverbs of modality, evidence and degree
The tendency to occupy mid-position extends also to these semantic types:
They’re probably still partying. (modal)   [JY7]
She is supposedly a rich woman. (hearsay evidential)
I totally disagree with you. (degree)

The adverbs still, yet, already
These three adverbs express, in broad terms, the following time relationships:
Still refers to processes or states which continue to occur or not occur up to the present.
Yet refers to processes or states which may occur in the future or have not occurred up to the present moment.
Already refers to processes or states which occurred before the present moment. 
The following table shows their interrelated uses in questions and answers, as in interpersonal communication. In negative replies, there is 
sometimes an equivalence between the not yet and the still not constructions. When used in monologues or continuous prose, these adverbs may 
be found in other syntactic frames, but mostly in the same basic placements as those shown in the table.
Question
1  Does Tom still visit you?
Affirmative answer

No, he doesn’t visit us any longer.
No, he no longer visits us.

55.2.5  Function and type
Since there is rarely a one-to-one relationship between function and type, many words 
can realise more than one syntactic function, with the position of the adverb varying 
according to its function. This is illustrated by the adverbs ‘altogether’ and ‘later’:
Altogether:	
He owes me a hundred dollars altogether (adjunct)
	
I think you are altogether wrong (modifier of adj.)
	
There were a lot of interesting people there, so altogether we had a 
  very good time. (connective)
Later :	
There will be another performance later. (adjunct)
	
The performance later will be a better one. (post-modifier of noun)
In conversation, adverbs sometimes occur alone, as responses to something said by 
the previous speaker. In such cases the adverb can carry out such discourse functions 
as agreeing  emphatically,  expressing  mild interest,  asserting  strongly or granting 
permission in particular contexts:
Maybe that’s a way to do it.
[F76] 
Absolutely	
(emphatic agreement)
Oh really? 	
(mild interest) 
Now that’s what I call a first-class meal!
Definitely!	
(emphatic agreement)
Did you enjoy the outing?
Tremendously, yes!	
(emphatic assertion)
Can I have a look at the contract?
Certainly.	
(granting permission)
Well, allright. 	
(reluctantly agreeing) 
Frankly, no.	
(refusing permission)

MODIFICATION AND	
UNIT 56
COMPLEMENTATION IN THE	
ADVERBIAL GROUP	
SUMMARY
1 	 Adverbs are graded in the same way as adjectives by more, less, as and 
so on, and the same suppletive forms are used for well and badly as for 
good and bad.
2 	 Similarly, intensification is carried out by very, quite, rather, pretty, fairly, 
among others.
3 	 Adverbs of space or time are frequently modified by other adverbs of 
space or time (out there, back home). Adverbs of manner are not normally 
used to modify other adverbs of manner, except when expressing modal 
attitudes.
4 	 Few adverbs take direct complements with prepositions or clauses (Luckily 
for us, long to wait). Indirect complements of graded forms function in the 
same way as with adjectives.
56.1  COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE USES
Adverbs are graded by the same words as adjectives:
more often, most often, less often, least often, as often, often enough, too often
Although the adverb enough is placed after the head adverb, we shall consider it as 
a modifier as we do with adjectives, since it can itself be sub-modified by an adverb 
placed before the head: not quite often enough (*not quite enough often).
The following suppletive forms are used as comparative and superlative forms of 
the adjectives good, bad and far, and the adverbs well, badly and far:
Good/well: better, best; bad/badly: worse, worst; far: further, furthest 
Tomorrow morning would suit me best, for the meeting. It was the driver who 
came off worst in the accident.

4 5 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
The forms shared by adverbs and adjectives early, late, quick, fast, long, soon take –est 
and -er in grades 1 and 2.
His speech was longer than mine. He spoke longer than I did.
I arrived later than Monica, because I came by a later train.
Please come the earliest you possibly can. Take the earliest train.
Correlative forms
The constructions formed by the more... the more (or -er . . . -er), the less . . . the less, 
the more . . . the less can be used correlatively to indicate a progressive increase, or 
decrease, of the quality or process described. Both adjectives and adverbs can occur 
in this construction:
The bigger they are, the harder they fall, don’t they? (adj–adv)
[KBB]
The sooner you forget the whole incident, the better. (adv–adv)
The more closely I look at the problem, the less clearly I see a solution. (adv–adv)
This construction is illustrated in the following extract from an in-flight magazine:
Don’t eat a large high-fat meal if you want to be mentally sharp afterwards. Too much 
food brings on lethargy. Fat stays in the digestive tract longer, prolonging tiredness. 
The fattier and heavier the meal, the longer it takes you to recover mental alertness and 
energy.
56.2  INTENSIFYING THE ADVERBIAL MEANING
As with adjectives, intensification may be (a) high, or (b) medium.
(a)	 very soon	
quite recently	
right now 	
high up
	
just then	
far back	
soon after 	
close by
(b)	 fairly well	
pretty easily	
rather badly
We saw in 52.1.2 that coordinated comparative adjectives indicate a progressively 
higher degree of the quality expressed: it’s getting colder and colder. Adverbial heads 
also participate in this structure, with the adverb as head or as modifier:
He drove faster and faster along the motorway.
Her paintings are selling more and more successfully every day.
Reduplicative adverbs have an intensifying effect:
very very fast	
much much better	
never ever	
through and through
over and over	
up and up	
again and again	
round and round

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 5 7
Attenuation
a bit harshly	
kind of hesitantly	
almost never
somewhat casually	
sort of sarcastically	
hardly ever
Quantification
As with adjectives, this refers mainly to circumstantial adverbs of space and time and 
may be either exact, or non-measurable:
Exact: 	
Our houses are only two streets apart.
	
I saw her a moment ago.
Non-measurable:	
quantity is expressed by modifiers such as: soon after, 
	
long before, quite near, shortly afterwards.
These circumstantial adverbs can be questioned by how + adj/adv:
How long have you been waiting? 	
Not long.
How far is it to the railway station? 	
Not far.
The focusing modifier: only
Only is a restrictive focusing adverb which can modify different units:
I wanted only one piece of toast.
We go there only once a year.
There is a tendency in spoken English to front the adverb to a position before the verb:
I only wanted one piece of toast.
We only go there once a year.
Describing and reinforcing
Adverbs of space or time are often preceded by other adverbs of space or time which 
reinforce or describe them more explicitly:
straight ahead 	
back home 	
up above 	
early today
out there 	
late yesterday 	
down below	
out here
As with adjectives, we may note the emotive modification of adverbs by swear 
words such as damn(ed), as in You behaved damn foolishly, and other less polite 
ones.

4 5 8  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Though less common in adverbial groups than in adjectival groups, modifiers can be 
found sub-modified, or even sub-sub-modified, especially in spoken English:
rather 	 less	
fluently
very 	
much	
more	
profitably
56.3  COMPLEMENTATION OF ADVERBS
The wh-items when, where, why, how and their compounds (somewhere, anywhere, etc.) 
have nominal as well as circumstantial value, as is shown in their post-modification 
by AdjGs (somewhere more exotic), PPs (everywhere in the world), non-fin cl (nowhere to 
sleep) and the adverb else:
where else?	 = in what other place?
when else?	 = at what other time?
how else? 	 = in what other way?
why else? 	 = for what other reason?
The forms somewhere, anywhere, nowhere are often replaced in informal AmE by 
someplace, anyplace, no place, though not in wh-questions, e.g. someplace else, anyplace 
else, no place else. Circumstantial adverbs are sometimes qualified by others of a similar 
type, so that it is not always clear which is the head and which the modifier:
We’ll be meeting them sometime soon.
I need a drink. There must be a pub somewhere near. 
In informal speech intensification and reinforcement of circumstantial adverbs may be 
expressed by post-modifiers, such as the following:
The train will be arriving now any minute/any minute now.
It always arrives punctually on the dot (= on time).
Stance adverbs are sometimes modified by enough, in the sense of intensification rather 
than sufficiency:
Curiously enough, he doesn’t seem to mind criticism.
The police never found out, oddly enough, who stole the jewels.
56.3.1 Complements of comparison and excess
Complements of adverbs are almost exclusively of one type, namely grading. As with 
adjectives, many adverbial heads admit indirect complements, which depend, not on 
the adverb itself, but on the degree modifier.
more, less . . . than	
Bill speaks Spanish much more fluently than his sister.
	
It rains less often here than in some other countries.
-er . . . than	
Our coach left earlier than it should have done.
as . . . as	
I don’t translate as accurately as a professional. 

D E S C R I B I N G  P E R S O N S ,  T H I N G S  A N D  C I R C U M S TA N C E S  
4 5 9
so . . . as …to-infinitive	
He spoke so fast as to be unintelligible. 
too . . . to-inf	
We reached the castle too late to go inside
not adv enough . . . to-inf	
We didn’t leave early enough to get there in time.
Such structures may be considered (as with AdjGs) as discontinuous complementation, 
though the two parts of the structure, before and after the head, differ in position 
and content.  The modifiers more (-er) and less do not necessarily  require the than- 
complement; on the other hand, complements introduced by than cannot be used 
without a previous modifier which controls this construction.
Adverbs modified quantitatively by so and that are also complemented in the same 
way as adjectives. The sequence of the clauses can be inverted, the second one then 
becoming an explanatory comment on the first:
He explained the problem so clearly (that) everybody understood. Everybody 
understood the problem, he explained it so clearly.
56.3.2  Adverbs taking direct complements
Whereas a good number of adjectives take prepositional and clausal complements, only 
a few adverbs, all ending in -ly, take direct complements in this way. The preposition or 
clausal complement associated with an adjective is in most cases not extended to the 
adverb: Compare mad about music, safe to drink, but not *madly about music or *safely to 
drink. Only a few prepositions complementing adjectives are also found with an adverb. 
These include: similarly to, independently of, separately from and differently from. Apart 
from these, luckily, fortunately, when used as stance adjuncts, can be complemented by for 
+ NG, while the adverbs long (= a long time) and far (= a great distance), take a to-infinitive 
and tend to occur in non-assertive contexts (→ 3.4), e.g. negative, interrogative:
Luckily/fortunately for us another coach came along shortly afterwards.
We didn’t have long to wait.
Do you have far to go?

Describing persons, things and circumstances
1  ADJECTIVES AND THE ADJECTIVAL GROUP
Unit 51
1	
†Express the following sentences differently using a pseudo-participial adjective in -ing or 
-en formed from the noun shown in italics. The first is done for you:
(1)	 Lots of people drink spring water sold in bottles. Lots of people drink bottled spring 
water.

phrases are participial adjectives or participial modifiers. Give a grammatical reason to 
support your analysis:
transitive:	
an alarming inflation rate; disturbing rumours; a relaxing drink. 
intransitive:	 a ticking clock; fading hopes; a growing debt.

deep-frozen, big-headed, sharp-eyed
(3)	 Noun + Adj:	
world-famous, waterproof, self-confident.

moderately intensified by quite, pretty, rather, fairly, reasonably or attenuated by expres­
sions such as: a bit, a little, slightly, not particularly, not very, not really, to some extent, 
in some respects, kind of, sort of, not at all.

2 	 †The following extract comes from the Time discussion transcript archive. The topic was 
the cloning of humans. Read the passage, underlining whole groups containing adjectives 
and adverbs. Use these in sentences of your own on the same topic:
Timehost presents question: I would like for you to clearly define why you think it is mor­
ally wrong to clone a human being. So far that has been totally unclear.
Thomas Murray says: ‘I think the reasons have been made abundantly clear in much 
of the conversation that has taken place since June. The immediate and most compelling 
reason is that cloning, from all the evidence, appears to be an extremely unsafe activity 
right now. The US, and other nations as well, have very strong traditions of protecting 
the human subjects of research. At this time, and for the foreseeable future, trying to 
clone a human being would be clearly unethical experimentation.’
ADVERBS AND THE ADVERBIAL GROUP

PREPOSITIONS AND THE	
UNIT 57
PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE (PP)	
 
SUMMARY 
1	
Prepositions have a relating function: they establish relations between 
nominal units, mainly nouns and nominal groups, and other units in the 
surrounding discourse. 
2	
The prepositional phrase consists of a preposition together with its 
complement, typically a nominal group, as under the bed, in the office.
3	
The preposition may optionally be preceded by a modifier: right through 
the window.
4	
Prepositions may consist of one word (from), two words (because of) three 
(in contact with) and occasionally four words (as a result of). All are single 
prepositions. 
5	
Not only a noun (in town) or full nominal group (on the floor) may function 
as complement of a preposition: an adverb (until now), an adjective (at 
last) or a clause (because of what happened, instead of waiting) may also 
fulfil this function. 
INTRODUCTION 
A notable feature of the English language is the extremely wide use it makes of
prepositions; and where there is a preposition there is a PP, since prepositions can­
not normally stand alone, although they can be separated from their complement by 
‘stranding’ (→ 6.3.2).

E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
57.1  INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE PREPOSITIONAL
PHRASE (PP) 
The structure of the prepositional phrase is different from that of groups. While nouns, 
adjectives and adverbs each function as head of their respective group and can be used 
alone, a preposition cannot normally occur without a nominal unit, and a nominal unit 
is not part of a PP if there is no preposition. Both are equally necessary to form the 
phrase. For this reason we refer to such a unit as a prepositional phrase. 
The internal structure of a PP consists of a preposition and its complement, both of 
which are obligatory, and an optional modifier. It can be represented as follows: 
Prepositional Phrase
m
prep
c
right 
into
the policeman’s arms
completely
out of
control
straight
along 
this road
just 
at
that moment
quite
near
here
only
by
concentrating hard
Figure 12.1   Structure of the prepositional phrase.
Not all PPs contain a modifier but all of them contain a preposition and a complement. 
The modifier typically intensifies the preposition by adding something specific to its 
meaning, such as exactness in the case of straight (straight along this road) or exclusive­
ness with only (only by concentrating hard).
Here is a recorded conversation between three students and a teacher (T), which 
illustrates the abundant use of prepositional phrases in English:
T:	 What’s this about?1
B:	 Oh, animals.
T:	 Oh, yes. People are obsessed in this country2 with being kind3 to animals,4 aren’t 
they?
A: Alison and her cat . . .!
B:	 Don’t talk to us5 about Alison’s cat!6
C: That cat is definitely not popular in our house!7
B:	 That cat moults constantly all over our carpet and sofa!8

R E L AT I O N S H I P S :  T H E  P R E P O S I T I O N A L  P H R A S E

T:	 But is it true, though? See what I mean? She hates cats! A: Just for that silly reason?9
T: 	No, but there seem to be more cases of animal cruelty10 going on here than anywhere 
else.11
A: Yeah. I get the impression from the little I know12 they’re just as crazy about dogs13 in 
Belgium and Holland and France and Italy14 as they are over here.15
T:	 Is it just one of those myths that we perpetuate regarding the British character?16 Is it 
true?
A: I think it probably is a myth.
(recorded conversation)
57.2  FEATURES OF PREPOSITIONS AND PPS 
57.2.1  Free or bound 
The meanings of prepositions are either ‘lexical’ and ‘free’ or ‘grammaticised’ and 
‘bound’. Grammaticised uses of prepositions are those which are controlled by a verb, 
adjective or noun, as happens with talk to them, obsessed with being, kind to animals, 
cases of cruelty (→ 59.5). Their meaning is not independent, whereas lexical propo­
sitional meanings are those freely chosen according to the speaker’s communicative 
intention (in this country, all over our carpet and sofa.) 
57.2.2  Potential for structural ambiguity 
As PPs are frequently embedded in other PPs, structural ambiguity may occur with a 
prep+Ng+prep+Ng sequence: ‘near the bar on the corner’ admits two analyses: 
(a)	 near [the bar on the corner] in which ‘on the corner’ is the post-modifier of ‘the bar’. 
(b)	 near [the bar] + [on the corner] consists of two independent adjuncts which might 
be reversed in order:
	
on [the corner] + [near the bar] 
57.2.3  Stranding of the preposition 
As seen in 6.3 and 10.5, the preposition is often stranded at the end of a clause and 
is thus separated from its nominal complement. The alternative construction called 
‘fronting’ keeps the preposition at the beginning of the clause, next to its complement. 
Stranded preposition 	
Fronted preposition 
Which day are you referring to?	
(To which day are you referring?)
Do you know who this book belongs to?	 (Do you know to who(m) this book 
belongs? ) 
Bill is the kind of guy you’d be 	
the kind of guy with whom
happy to have a drink with	
you’d be happy to have a drink) (formal)
Stranding is typical of spoken and informal written English, while the fronted counter­
parts are formal, and might be found in planned formal discourse. 

4 7 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
When verb and preposition are tightly bound, the fronted alternative with a wh-
interrogative may become so awkward as to be impossible. Not all combinations admit 
both versions (→ 6.3), as for example be about, particularly if the subject (this) is not 
identified: 
What’s this about? (What functions as the complement of about) About what is this? 
(This version sounds awkward and strange, and would be avoided. 
57.3  ONE-WORD, TWO-WORD AND MULTI-WORD PREPOSITIONS 
Prepositions may be ‘simple’ (consisting of a single word) or ‘complex’ (consisting of 
two words or more). 
57.3.1  One-word prepositions 
The short, simple forms are by far the commonest, such as: 
about	
across	
after	
against	
as	
at
behind	
before	
beside	
between	
but 	
down
during	
for 	
from	
in	
like	
near
of 	
off	
on	
over	
past	
round
since	
through	
to 	
towards	
under 	
 until
with 	
without	
 
The preposition but tends to follow a non-assertive word as in ‘Anything but barley-
water, please! ‘Nothing but trouble will come of this’. 
57.3.2 Complex prepositions 
Some complex prepositions function in the same way as single ones, ending in a simple 
preposition. 
Two-word prepositions have as second element one of the simple prepositions as, for, 
from, of, to, with: 
+ such as 
+ for: as for, except for, but for
+ from: apart from, away from, as from 
+ of: ahead of, because of, instead of, regardless of, out of
+ to: according to, close to, contrary to, due to, owing to, thanks to, up to
+ with: along with, together with 
Also included are: as against, as regards, rather than: 
Once outside, I stood blinking against the glare of the sun.
He has his whole life ahead of him.
Rather than risk an unpleasant surprise, keep a lock on your bicycle. 

R E L AT I O N S H I P S :  T H E  P R E P O S I T I O N A L  P H R A S E

Three-word prepositions typically consist of a simple preposition + noun + another 
simple preposition

Four-word prepositions include a definite or indefinite article:

with the exception of 
A few prepositions ending in of have an alternative structure with’s 
for the sake of the children 	
on behalf of the committee
for the children’s sake	
on the committee’s behalf
However, non-personal reference with ’s is limited to exclamative expressions such as 
for heaven’s sake. 
57.4  THE COMPLEMENT ELEMENT 
The complement of a preposition is most typically realised by a noun or common
use. A PP as complement of a preposition is totally regular, as are –ing and wh-clauses: 
noun/NG:	
at home (BrE), home (AmE); after which, on account of his age, on 
Friday, in June 
adj 	
in private	
at last	
for good (= for ever)
adv	
for ever	
since when 	
until quite recently
PP	
except in here	
from out of the forest
Pull it out from under the letters in the drawer
wh-cl	
Have you decided on when you are leaving? 
wh + to-inf cl	
Have you any problem apart from where to stay?
-ing cl	
The miners charge the employers with ignoring their claims
With home, days and months etc . . . as locatives, AmE does not use a preposition. 
I don’t sleep nights for thinking of my daughter. 
‘I’d much rather stay home tonight,’ he said.
Summers, I visit my father in Maryland.
The following restrictions exist on the types of complement possible:

4 7 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Adjectival and adverbial groups are infrequent and are limited to idiomatic expressions 
such as at last, for good, for ever, as in: 
At last I’m free! 	
[GWH]
 . . . the family left Ireland for good and made its future in England	
[EDA]
I could stay here for ever, it’s so beautiful. 
Clauses as complements of prepositions 
English prepositions are not followed by that-clauses (→ 11.1.2).The only type of finite 
clause admissible is the wh-clause, and the only non-finite type the -ing clause. To-inf 
clauses are not admissible after a preposition either, except when introduced by a wh-
item, as in apart from where to stay. Combinations 1b and 2b , therefore, are ungram­
matical. An -ing clause can often provide an acceptable alternative, as in 1a and 2a: 
1a	 I was pleased about our team winning the prize /that our team won the prize.
1b	 *I was pleased about that our team won the prize. 
2a	 We were disappointed at not getting any news from you.
2b	 *We were disappointed at not to get any news from you. 
Use of -ing clauses 
‘To’+ the base form of a verb is a ‘to-infinitive’, and must be distinguished from the 
preposition to, which can take an -ing clause, as in the first example below. Most other 
prepositions likewise take the -ing form, as this is the most nominal among clauses: 
He devoted his career to helping needy and deprived children.
The intruder escaped by climbing over a back fence. 
But and except may be followed by to-infinitives. They typically follow a negative 
element: Jean and Bill will have no choice but to send their children to another school. 
The following continuation of the recorded student–teacher conversation shows 
that the largest number of complements are realised by nouns, pronouns and full NGs, 
with a sprinkling of finite and non-finite clauses:

T:	 I get the impression that it’s a non-vote, just a comfortable way of not having to take 
a decision.6
B: Yeah, a pressure vote, so that you don’t have to vote either for the Conservatives7 or 
for the Labour Party.8 People just can’t be bothered with comparing programmes and 
thinking9 about who to vote for.10

their policies?11
B:	 Yeah, but it’s . . . it’s just waffle, just an excuse for getting votes.12

B:	 Suppose I do, a bit.
T:	 One of the things people say about, well, at least some of the younger generation,14 
not all of them,15 but on the whole16 is, there’s no radicalism among people today17 
who are in their late teens and twenties.18 It’s what the forty-year-olds say about the 
twenty-year-olds.19 They think back to when they were young20 and what they were 
like then21 and say that the younger generation don’t have any radical or controver­
sial views any more.
A:	I don’t think radicalism has disappeared. Maybe it has been channelled into that 
‘green’ area.22
B:	 Yeah. A lot of former ideas have been ditched in favour of moving towards a  posi­
tion much closer to the centre than before.
THE MODIFIER ELEMENT 
Prepositional phrases can be pre-modified by other elements, in particular adverbs, 
and to a lesser extent nouns: 
Adverbs

SYNTACTIC FUNCTIONS OF 	
UNIT 58 
THE PREPOSITONAL PHRASE 	
SUMMARY 
1	
The basic grammatical role of a preposition is to establish a functional rela­
tionship between its complement and another syntactic element in a nearby 
structure, whether a clause or a group. 
2	
In doing this, the whole PP functions as an element of a clause (e.g. as an 
adjunct in: He works at Heathrow Airport) or as a post-modifier in an NG 
(the bridge over the river) or as complement of an adjective (fed up with 
the weather).
3	
Some words can be used not only as prepositions but as conjunctions 
(after, before), adverbs (over, past) or verbs (considering, including). (after 
the rain; after it stopped raining; the horse jumped over the fence; a lot of 
food was left over). 
58.1  THE SYNTACTIC FUNCTION OF PPS 
When a preposition links its complement to another element of a clause or group, the 
whole PP itself becomes a functional element of the clause or group. 
The main syntactic functions of prepositional phrases are as adjuncts in clauses and 
as post-modifiers or complements of nouns. All three types of adjunct, circumstantial, 
stance and connective can be realised by PPs.
58.1.1  PPs as adjuncts in clauses 
As circumstantial adjuncts, PPs typically occur in either final or initial position: 
Final position: The two friends drank their coffee in silence for a few moments.
Initial position: Behind us, we saw that the tail-back of traffic on the motorway 
stretched for miles. 

4 7 6  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
As stance adjuncts, PPs express a comment on, or an attitude to the form or content 
of a whole clause:
In all honesty, I don’t believe a word he said.
By all means, do as you think best. 
From any point of view, the proposal is rubbish
As connective adjuncts, PPs can be used to link clauses or groups and words within 
clauses
I’m leaving now. In that case I’ll go too. 
Are you feeling bored? On the contrary, I’m enjoying it all. 
In addition PPs can realise the functions of Complements in clauses: 
Marcia must be out of her mind to reject such an offer (Subject Complement) 
His illness left him without a job. (Object Complement)
The 4.15 train to London is now standing at Platform 3, and the high-speed train 
from York is drawing into the station. (Locative/Goal Complement) 
58.1.2  As modifiers and complements in groups 
There’s a light in the window. (post-modifier of noun in nominal group) (→ ch. 10, 
49.2, 49.5.1) 
Off-the-record comments should not be printed in a newspaper. (pre-modifier of 
noun in nominal group.) 
The man over there has a request for further information. (complement of noun in 
NG) (→ ch.10, 50.5) 
My son-in-law is brilliant at mathematics. (Complement of adj in AdjG)
They don’t live far from here. (Complement of adv in AdvG)
Turn to the left after the tunnel under the motorway. (Complement in a PP) 
58.2  CLASSES OF WORDS WITH THE SAME FORM AS PREPOSITIONS 
58.2.1  Prepositions and conjunctions 
Some of the one-word prepositions listed in 57.3 can also function as conjunctions. 
The most common include after, as, before, given, since, until. The participial preposi­
tions such as considering can also function as conjunctions. When these words are 
followed by a noun they function as prepositions: when they are followed by a clause 
they function as conjunctions
(prep)	
 After the rain, the sun came out. 
(conj)	
After it stopped raining, we fetched our bicycles and took to the road. 
(prep) 	
Since our meeting last September I haven’t heard from him.

(prep)	
Given the rise in cyberbullying, parents must take precautions to 
address the problem. 
(conj)	
Given that cyberbullying is increasing, parents should set up filters on 
phones and computers. 	
58.2.2  Prepositions and verbs 
Certain participials can function both as prepositions and as non-finite verbs: excepting, 
excluding, following, including, regarding: 
(prep)	
These prices refer to a double room, including breakfast.
(verb)	
We are including two new colleagues in the research group. 
58.2.3  Prepositions and adverbs 
These are sometimes called prepositional adverbs, as they can function as either class. 
Common examples include the following:
Aboard about across above before below beyond down in inside near off out 
outside through throughout under underneath up. 
(prep) Their behaviour is beyond belief. 
(adv) From the top of the hill you can see the manor house and the woods beyond. 
Here are some structural criteria for distinguishing prepositions from adverbs: 
• 
A preposition, but not an adverb, requires a nominal complement, and when this is 
a pronoun, the preposition governs its case (for him, without them).
• 
In paired examples such as We went into the café – we went in, what was a 
preposition in the first version is replaced by an adverb in the second. 
• 
The adverb is heavily stressed, whereas the preposition is normally unstressed, or 
only lightly stressed (lower down the scale vs lower DOWN; we walked past the café; 
we walked PAST (→ 6.4.2). 
In certain positions prepositions are stressed; for instance, when stranded at the end of 
a wh-question: What is it FOR? Where is it FROM? The preposition with is stressed in the 
expression with it (trendy), and also in the adjunctive use I’ll take it WITH me. Without is 
similarly stressed in I can’t do WITHOUT it, WITHOUT you. In combinations with do – 
(do without, go without, meaning ‘must have’), the word without functions as an adverbial 
particle. There’s no milk left, so we’ll just have to do without (meaning ‘not have’). 
With regard to the phrasal verb ‘come to’, meaning ‘regain consciousness’, the par­
ticle to is heavily stressed: The unconscious boy came TO.

SEMANTIC FEATURES OF THE 	
UNIT 59
PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE 	
SUMMARY 
1 	 The choice of preposition in a PP may be (a) governed by the particular 
noun, verb or adjective that precedes it (a threat to, depend on, bored 
with), or (b) chosen freely from a set of prepositions expressing different 
relationships (under, over, between, across, along, etc.), as in Let’s place 
the lamp in the corner/on the desk/by the armchair). The former type is 
said to be ‘grammaticised’ or ‘bound’. The latter type is ‘lexical’ or ‘free’.
2 	 Location in space and change of location are the most basic types of 
prepositional relations. When speakers use in or on or under in English, for 
example, they make use of cognitive patterns or mental image schemas of 
each relationship, in accordance with the way each relation is perceived 
in the culture.
3 	 The concepts of Figure and Ground (or, more specifically, Trajector and 
Landmark) are used to refer to the salient object, whether moving or 
stationary, and the point of reference, respectively, in a spatial event. The 
preposition expresses the relation between the two – such as ‘containment’ 
(in), or ‘support’ (on) – in the most basic use. Further uses can then be 
explained as modifications of the basic image schema, as these mental 
pictures are perceived and derived from our experience of the world.
4 	 Many basic patterns of spatial location are carried over to time relations, 
such as in the house, in November, in 1492, and to ordinary metaphorical 
uses which form part of our daily interaction (in love, in time, in pain).
59.1  TWO TYPES OF PREPOSITIONAL MEANINGS 
Prepositional meanings can be divided into two broad types: 
• 
those in which the choice of preposition is determined by the verb, noun or 
adjective preceding it; and
• 
those in which a preposition is chosen freely in accordance with the speaker’s 
intentions. 

4 8 0  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
We say that the first type has become ‘grammaticised’ or ‘bound’, while the second 
type is more ‘lexical’ and ‘free’: 
grammaticised	
I agree with you; we rely on you; fruit is good for you.
lexical	
We flew/in/into/out of/through/above/below/close to/
  near/a long way from the clouds. 
In previous sections we have discussed those prepositions which are determined by 
nouns (→ 50.5), adjectives (→ 53.1.3) and verbs (→ 6.3.1; 10.5) (e.g. look after, rely on, 
put up with). These are all grammaticised; that is to say, in such cases the preposition 
does not have its full lexical meaning and is not in open choice with other prepositions. 
We noticed that nouns which take prepositional complements are related to cognate 
verbs or adjectives that often take the same prepositional complement, as in the 
following examples:
nouns: 	
compatibility with, reliance on, damage to, a liking for, an attack on, a 
quarrel with
adjs: 	
compatible with, opposed to, free of/from, lacking in
verbs: 	
to rely on, to dispose of, to amount to, to hope for, to quarrel with, 
give it to me (with the Recipient encoded as a prepositional phrase) 
But notice that, when a noun or adjective takes of, the verb (if it exists) 
does not necessarily take the same preposition; for instance, ‘hope(ful) 
of success’ but ‘hope to succeed’.
59.2  LEXICAL PREPOSITIONAL MEANINGS 
59.2.1  Location in space 
The most basic prepositional meanings have to do with location in space. When we 
express spatial relationships we use a mental picture or image schema for each type
of relationship, in which a salient Figure, typically a person or thing, is located – or 
moves – with relation to a reference point or Ground (usually another entity). It is 
the principle of salience or prominence which enables us to explain why it is more 
natural to say ‘the book is on the table’ than ‘the table is under the book’. In Chapter 8, 
we encountered Figure and Ground, together with Path and Manner, when describing 
a Motion Event, with the example: The children went down to the beach, in which the 
Figure is ‘the children’ and the Ground is ‘the beach’.
In 1 (below), the Figure (the boy) is stationary with respect to the Ground (the 
water), while in 2 the Figure (the boy) is moving with respect to the Ground
1   The boy is in the water. 	
2   The boy is going into the water. 
As we examine the different spatial relationships expressed by prepositions, we see 
that the nominal group or clause following the preposition represents the Ground, 
while the Figure is a nearby entity in the clause, like the boy. (Other, more specific 
terms which have been widely adopted in the analysis of prepositions are ‘Trajector’ 
and ‘Landmark’ for Figure and Ground, respectively.)

R E L AT I O N S H I P S :  T H E  P R E P O S I T I O N A L  P H R A S E  
4 8 1
We now turn to the main types of meaning expressed by spatial prepositions in 
English, in terms of Figure and Ground: 
At:	 point in space: 	
Tim is at home, at the football match, at the 
cinema, at the supermarket, at work
On: 	 in contact with a surface: 	 on the floor/wall/ceiling; on the corner of Bond 
Street; on a bicycle; on the train/bus/on board 
ship; on the map; a wasp on my hand
In:	
containment:	
in the universe, in the world, in France, in the 
garden; in the corner, in the car, in a boat, the 
coin in my hand, in the rain, in my imagination
The preposition at is used when the typical function of the premise is implied (e.g. at the 
cinema in order to see a film; at church to attend a religious service, at school attending 
a class), all when the speaker is not at the same location as the Figure. In visualising 
Tim’s location at the cinema, the speaker is deliberately vague about exactly where 
at the cinema Tim is. Tim may in fact be in the queue outside the cinema, or inside, 
seeing the film. If the speaker were already outside the cinema and asks where Tim is, 
the answer would be specific: He’s in the cinema, he’s inside.
On typically has the Figure in contact with and supported by a surface (the Ground), 
whether horizontal (there’s a pen on the floor) or vertical (there’s a fly on the wall). The 
Ground includes vehicles and animals on which one rides (on a bicycle/motorcycle/
horse), and larger vehicles in transit which have a walkway (on the bus/train, plane, on 
board a ship), whereas in is used where no such walkway exists (in a boat, in a car, in a 
helicopter). However, as trains have cafeterias and dining cars, we say in the cafeteria/
the dining-car, in the first-class compartment, which are conceptualised as containers. 
When the vehicle is not in active use, it is conceived as a container and in may be used 
(The children were playing in the abandoned bus).
In implies containment: There are strong security forces in the stadium. Containment 
may be complete (the coins in my purse) or in part (Put the flowers in water, a man in a 
blue shirt and jeans). The difference between in the corner (of a room) and on the corner 
(of the street) is one of perspective, whether the right-angle is perceived as containing 
or projecting.
59.2.2  Change of location
Change of location implies motion. Source (→ 8.2.3) represents the initial location, and 
is typically marked by the preposition from, while Goal represents the final location 
and is most often marked by to, or by to in combination with on for a surface (onto) or 
in for a container (into). ‘Home’ in go home is an exception in not expressing the notion 
of final location (Goal) explicitly. (Note the explicit encoding of location in BrE ‘stay at 
home’ against the inexplicit AmE ‘stay home’). 
From (source) . . .  to (goal)	
From the bus-stop to the stadium.
Off . . . (source) . . . onto (goal)	
The vase fell off the table onto the floor.
Off . . . (source) . . . into (goal)	
The boy fell off the cliff into the sea.
Out of (source) 	
I took the money out of my purse. The wasp flew 
out of the window (BrE),  out the window (AmE). 

4 8 2  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
Across, along (path) 	
We went from the bus-stop, along the street to 
the stadium.
Through (passage) 	
We went through the tunnel. 
Out of is visualised as exit from a container. Note that the adverb out + the preposition 
of provides the converse meaning with respect to into: into the water/out of the water, 
while away + from indicates greater distancing: away from the water. Similarly, off 
is the converse of on and onto (off the table onto the floor, both implying movement).
As we saw in 40.2.2, embeddings of prepositional phrases within adverbial groups 
express complex spatial meanings which are difficult to translate, for example: back 
from the front line, in from the fields, over to the left, up from below.
Across, along express Path. The difference is that along simply follows a horizontal 
axis (We walked along the river bank, Cars were parked along the street), while across 
involves crossing the axis, or an open space, at an angle, from one side to another (She 
walked across the street/the field).
Through typically has the meaning of Passage (motion into a point and then out 
of it (He hurried through the doorway). The Ground can also be two-dimensional (You 
could go through the park, through a maze of streets) or three-dimensional, with volume 
(We drove through the tunnel).
Past is similar to along, but with respect to some fixed point: Go past the stadium and 
you’ll come to a supermarket. 
59.2.3  Other spatial prepositions 
Other basic spatial prepositions include over, under, up and down. Over is used in 
several ways: 
(a)	 A picture hangs over the fireplace. 
(b)	 A helicopter flew over our heads. 
(c)	 They live over a sweet-shop.
(d)	 He wore a raincoat over his suit. 
(e)	 The lake is just over the hill.
(f)	 They sprayed paint all over the wall. 
(g)	  The horse jumped over the fence.
(h)	 I fell over a stone and broke my leg. 
In (a) and (b), one entity is higher than the other, with a space between, the difference 
being that (a) is static location (b) involves motion. The notion of ‘higher’ is still clear 
in (c) but less clear in (d) where, in addition, ‘space’ is reduced to the meaning of ‘on 
top of’. In (e), over implies location at the end of a path. One has to go over the hill to 
reach the lake. In (f) all over is ‘pervasive’ or ‘covering’, whereas (g) signals a movement 
of going up higher than an obstacle and down again on the other side, and (h) moving 
from an upright to a non-upright position. (Compare fall over as an intransitive phrasal 
verb with an adverbial particle: The lamp fell over and broke.)
Under, meaning vertically below, but with some intervening space, is the converse 
of over. It can function with verbs of location and motion, and the distance may be 
greatly reduced: 

R E L AT I O N S H I P S :  T H E  P R E P O S I T I O N A L  P H R A S E  
4 8 3
There’s a rug under the table; a bench under the tree. (i.e. under the branches of the 
tree!)
I pushed the letter under the door.
He’s wearing a T-shirt under his sweater. (conversely, a sweater over his T-shirt) 
Above and below are similar to over and under, but absolute verticality is not a 
requirement: 
The castle stands above the town; below the castle there is a river.
Up and down indicate a higher or lower position respectively, as in (a), or motion 
towards that position, as (b). Like under, they can imply the path taken to the higher or 
lower location, as with (b):
(a)	 There’s a pub just up/down the road.
(b)	 We had to walk up/down three flights of stairs. 
Up and down are, however, more commonly used as adverb particles in phrasal and 
phrasal-prepositional verbs, such as If you take it up, I’ll bring it down (→ 6.4).
Round/around express circular movement along a path in She danced around the 
bonfire, but circular position on a path in The children sat round the teacher (though prob­
ably the circle was not a full one). In the sentence They drove furiously round the race 
track, the track was probably irregularly curved, not circular. Sometimes the meaning 
is indeterminate movement in different directions within an area, as in We walked for 
hours round the streets looking for a cheap hotel. At other times, the movement may be 
neither circular nor along a clear path, but varied and indeterminate in a volume of 
space (e.g. The bees swarmed around us.) These differences may be regarded as different 
senses of the general meaning of ‘circularity’.
By, beside, at my side, next to, in front of, behind (AmE in back of), on the left, 
on the right, facing, opposite (AmE across from) all express degrees of proximity. 
They correspond to the physical orientation of our bodies, and are extended to certain 
objects such as cars and houses which have a front, a back and sides.
By has also the meanings of agency (a novel by Tolstoy) and means (by train, by bus, by air).
Between and among express relative position, referring to two entities, or more 
than two, respectively.
59.2.4  Non-locative meanings 
For has been explained in Chapters 2 and 3 as the Beneficiary meaning, that is, intended 
Recipient. It also expresses purpose and intended destination (I’ve brought it for you; 
an extra-fast machine for copying; they’re making for the coast).
Like expresses similarity of features or character (She looks rather like Lady Macbeth, 
What is she like as a person?) It can also introduce a simile (The lake shone like a mirror) 
and draw on a more vague similarity of situations (Let’s not quarrel over a silly thing 
like this). Like is related to the predicative adjective alike (The brothers look alike) and 
to the adverb alike (The changes in climate affect young and old alike).

4 8 4  
E N G L I S H  G R A M M A R
As is used when referring to roles, jobs or functions (He made his name as a pop 
singer; Have you ever worked as a shop assistant?). As is grammaticised in comparisons 
(as clear as crystal) and is related to the conjunction as (As I was saying, . . .).
With and without can signal (a) accompaniment and lack of it, respectively (I’ll go 
with you; she turned up at the gala dinner without her husband); (b) possession (a girl 
with red hair, a street without a name) or a part–whole relationship (a cup without a 
handle); or (c) instrument (he broke the lock with a hammer; she pushed her hair back 
with her hand).
59.3  TIME RELATIONS
Certain prepositions expressing location in space are also used to express location in 
time. Other prepositions – such as during, until and since – are not used with spatial 
meanings.
At:
examples
at one o’clock; at Christmas;
at midday
usage
point in time: clock time, fixed 
holidays
On:
on Friday, on June 2nd
for specific days and dates 
regarding the occurrence of events
In:

months, years, times of day, 
seasons, centuries and other 
periods of time, all conceptualised 
as containers; note however, in the 
morning/afternoon/evening, but at 
night
Over:

weekend, over Christmas
periods of short duration
During:
during the war, during my stay in 
Rome
experiential periods of time
For:
We read for hours (cf. spatially, 
We walked for miles);
We are camping here for the 
summer; for a long time, for good
(= ‘for ever’)
duration of time
for the third time
frequency
Since:
I’ve been here since 10 a.m.
retrospective, referring to the 
initiation of the duration
Until:
We’ll wait until 4 o’clock;
until the plane takes off;
We didn’t eat until four o’clock;
from morning till night; up till now
typically marks end-point of 
duration, but marks a starting- point 
with negative sentences; till and up 
till are informal variants, but till is 
not used to start a sentence

spatial expression ‘He appeared

By:
(a) Essays must be handed in
(a) a time deadline

(b) By the summer, she was 
feeling stronger
(b) before a certain time
59.4  METAPHORICAL AND ABSTRACT USES 
Many spatial prepositions are used in abstract or metaphorical expressions. For exam­
ple, about in walk about the house expresses ‘indeterminate spatial movement’, whereas 
in talk about the house it expresses the notion of ‘reference’.
Although many abstract and metaphorical uses of prepositions (and adverbs) may at 
first sight appear arbitrary, metaphor and metonymy can provide enlightening expla­
nations. For instance, the expressions in love, in pain, in anger construe these emotions 
as containers, yet this construal is not applicable to happiness and hate (*in happiness, 
*in hate.) For these, full of happiness/joy/hate and also anger are normal uses, with the 
body in this case construed as the container. The field of vision as well as the mind are 
also seen as containers, as in the expressions ‘in full view’, ‘out of sight, out of mind’, in 
your imagination.
Between, meaning relative position, is extended to both temporal and abstract 
meanings: Between six and seven this evening; the discussion between them turned into 
a quarrel.
Into, used metaphorically, indicates active participation in something, as in he’s into 
rugby these days.
Over and under have non-spatial meanings as in: it weighs over a kilo, it cost under 
ten euros, while in the verbs overact, overcharge, under-estimate, undernourished the 
meaning is ‘excess’ and insufficiency’, respectively. A different extension of meaning, 
something like ‘subordination’ or ‘subjection to’ is illustrated in: under the influence of 
drugs; under his leadership; under the threat of expulsion; under control; under the circum­
stances; under contract for a year.
With over, the meaning of ‘surmounting an obstacle’ is extended to that of illness and 
difficulties – get over an operation has the sense of recovering from its effects – while 
control over/power over someone, or something, is an extension of the basic higher-vs- 
lower spatial meaning, as is also the use of over in ‘let’s discuss it over a cup of coffee’. 
Here the mental image is of persons leaning slightly forward, engaged in talk, with the 
coffee on the table between them.
Out of as ‘exit from a container’ is extended to expressions such as out of petrol, 
out of sugar, out of work (= jobless), out of date (= obsolete). Out also responds to the 
‘emergence metaphor’ as in He did it out of despair, out of love for his family, and to the 
‘object comes out of a substance’ metaphor, as in Mammals developed out of reptiles. 
The opposite is the ‘substance goes into the object’ metaphor, as in I made a sheet of 
newspaper into a plane.

Off and on have converse meanings in relation to the notion of support as the 
Ground: the pen fell off the table onto the floor. They are used colloquially as converses 
in expressions such as he’s off alcohol, he’s on drugs.
Up and down are often metaphorically construed as converses, with positive and 
negative connotations respectively, in expressions such as coming up in the world, 
going down in the world, look up to someone and look down on someone. Up north and 
down south reflect geographical orientation, whereas up to London, down to the country 
reflects the status of the capital.
Through can have the meaning of completion and result: He went through a fortune 
in a year; I finally got through that long novel.
With can metaphorically signal the manner of doing something (Say it with a smile = 
smiling; With a wave of his hand, he left) or result, in black with the smoke, together with 
increasing or decreasing value (This wine has improved with age).
 The following extract from Gone Girl illustrates the use of lexical prepositions:
‘Amy’ I began running, bellowing her name. Through the kitchen,1 where a kettle was 
burning, down to the basement.2 where the guest room stood empty, and then out the 
back door.3 I pounded across our yard4 into the slender boat deck5 leading out over the 
river.6 I peeked over the side7 to see if she was in our rowboat,8 where I had found her 
one day, tethered to the dock,9 rocking in the water,10 her face to the sun,11 eyes closed, 
and as I peered down into the dazzling reflections12 of the river, at her beautiful, still 
face,13 she’d suddenly opened her blue eyes and said nothing to me,14 and I‘d said noth­
ing back and gone into the house alone.15 
59.5 GRAMMATICISED PREPOSITIONS 
Outlined next are some of the most common grammaticised prepositions, functioning 
mainly as complements of verbs.
At is the preposition controlled by certain verbs such as laugh, verbs of looking – 
look, glance, gaze, stare – and verbs of aiming: aim, shoot at someone or something. 
The latter implies that the attempt failed, whereas transitive shoot + Od is effective: 
The terrorist shot two policemen dead (i.e. killed them; the addition of the Object 
Complement dead clarifies the difference between a fatal shooting and an injury); he 
shot at the escaping criminal, but missed.
In is used with the verbs believe, confide, trust, engage, interest and succeed (I tried to 
engage her in conversation, to interest them in world affairs, to get them interested in politics).
On is the preposition selected by agree, rely, count, concentrate, depend, and by the 
ditransitive verbs feed and spend (spend a lot on entertainment; feed them on cereals).
By has so many meanings in addition to those already mentioned that it appears not 
to call up one basic mental image. Here are just a few:
Agency: The goal was scored by Evans.
Means: They travelled by bus, by air, by plane.
Extent: The envelopes measure 9cm by 6 cm.
Time during: Travel by day or by night.

By is also used with intransitive or transitive phrasal verbs: stand by, get by, pass by; 
Don’t let the opportunity pass you by.
For is used with the verbs allow (allow for delay), ask (ask for help), exchange 
(exchange one coin for another); (hope) hope for the best, (wait) I’m waiting for you.
From is used with verbs of preventing (keep, discourage, exclude, exempt, prevent, 
restrain someone from doing something), among other meanings.
Of is also highly grammaticised, and occurs after verbs (think, hear, approve, con­
vince someone, die), adjectives (full, tired) and nouns (a bottle of wine, the home of a 
former PM). These and other prepositions are discussed and illustrated in the chapters 
referred to above.

 (1) any (in an interrogative clause); 
(2) ever . . . anything (hardly is a 
semi-negative word) (3) anywhere/ 
anything/ any place (in an embed­
ded clause after negative don’t think); 
(4) anyone/ anybody (in an embed­
ded clause after negative don’t 
remember).
8	
(1) The alternative negative forms 
never in (a) and not . . . ever in (b) 
establish negative clauses and within 
this scope are followed by non-
assertive items such as any. (1c) by 
contrast contains ever, which is not 
a negative word, but a non-assertive 
word. The clause is therefore not 
negative as it would be with never, 
but neither is it correctly positive. 
(2)	 Similarly, no-negation and not-
negation are used correctly in (a) 
and (b) respectively. In (c) as any­
body is non-assertive but not nega­
tive, it can’t make a clause negative.

CHAPTER 2 
Unit 4 
1 	
(1) (since my father’s day); (2) 
(briefly) (to Mrs Blake); (3) (at the 
time); (4) none; (5) none; (6) (in 
the park); (7) (before the fall of the 
Berlin Wall) (practically); (8) (just); 
(9) (insistently) (at six o’clock in the 
morning) (on a cold November day); 
(10) (for the fifth time) (on Monday). 
Note that although 10 is grammati­
cally complete, the use of the past 
tense ‘became’ creates expectations 
of at least an adjunct expressing a 
point in time (see Chapter 7). With 
a present perfect ‘has become’ this 
would not be the case.
Unit 5 
1	
(1) the use of caves for smuggling; 
(2) there (Subject place-holder), half 
a dozen men (notional Subject); (3) 
the light of a torch; (4) what the 
critics failed to understand; (5) the 
list of people who she says helped 
her; (6) it (anticipatory) to meet him 
before he died (extraposed Subject); 
(7) Run like mad; (8) it (anticipa­
tory) to tell the neighbours you are 
going away on holiday (extraposed 
Subject); (9) it (anticipatory) that 
there is no real progress (extraposed 
Subject); (10) reading in a poor light.

(1) It surprised us that Pam is seek­
ing a divorce. (2) It was bad man­
ners, really, to leave without saying 
goodbye. (3) It doesn’t interest 
me who she goes out with. (4) It 
requires a lot of nerve for such a 
man to succeed in the world of poli­
tics. (5) It is obvious that recognis­
ing syntactic categories at first sight 
is not easy.
3	
(1) lies, finite; (2) is, finite; (3) 
called, non-finite; (4) is, finite; (5) 
quarried, finite; (6) and (7) decorat­
ing, filling, non-finite; (8) laid, finite; 
(9) surrounded, finite; (10) making, 
non-finite. Note that dried up, mum­
mified and bejewelled do not realise 
clause constituents but are participial 
modifiers in nominal groups.
Unit 6 
1a	 (1) most of my life (NG); (2) the 
door (NG); (3) that foreign doc­
tors were not allowed to practise 
in that country (finite that clause); 
(4) very little (AdvG as quantifier); 
(5) discretion (NG); (6) what they 
believe to be sunken treasure (nomi­
nal relative cl.); (7) Anticipatory it 
as place-holder; that the money will 
be refunded as extraposed object. 
(8) that many will survive the long 
trek over the mountains (finite that-
clause); (9) what the use of all this 
is (wh-interrogative clause); (10) a 
ton of gravel (NG).
1b	 All the NGs are prototypical, except 
(5) discretion, which is non-proto­
typical. The verb ‘lack’ does not pas­
sivise. However, in other respects, 
‘discretion’ fulfils the criteria for Od. 
(4) ‘very little’ might be considered 
as an ellipted NG, but in this case 
the ellipted part is not as easily 
recoverable as it is in ‘we ate very 
little’ i.e. (food). The that-clauses are 
less prototypical realisations, as are 
the wh-clauses, but are nevertheless 
perfectly normal. Anticipatory it is 
not prototypical, but is a require­
ment in extraposition.

ositional); (7) come up to (phrasal 
prepositional); (8) intrans phrasal 
(ellipted version of prepositional get 
off (the bus/train)).
4a	 (a) Prepositional Object; (b) Adjunct; 
(c) Adjunct; (d) Prepositional Object.
	
Sentences (a) and (d) can be pas­
sivised, and the verb + preposition 
have lexical equivalents (rehearse and 
be wise to, respectively). Sentences 
(b) and (c) don’t have these possi­
bilities. In (b) through the streets can 
be fronted, but (c) through the trees 
can’t.
4b	 In run up large bills, run up is a tran­
sitive phrasal verb, with large bills its 
Od. Run up can be discontinuous, as 
in she ran large bills up. But up large 
bills is not a constituent, and conse­
quently can’t be fronted. Furthermore, 
only directional/locative adverbs in 
phrasal verbs can be fronted. Up in 
Run up bills is not directional/locative, 
whereas in run up the stairs it is.
4c	 In one meaning decided is intran­
sitive  a n d  on the bus is a locative 
Adjunct; in another, on the bus is a 
Prepositional Complement, equiva­
lent to she opted for the bus.
4d	 He rode out; we swam across; they 
jumped over; get in, all of you!

(6) accessible to a wide public Co 
(AdjG); (7) unexpectedly cold (AdjG); 
(8) happy Co (AdjG); (9) utterly

(AdjG).
2a	 (1) healthy; (2) smart; (3) one of 
the most efficient ways of getting 
about; (4) so versatile as trans­
port or for simple pleasure; (5) to 
work; (6) fit; (7) effective exer­
cise. All are Subject Complements 
except (5) Locative/ Goal and (6) 
Object Complement. The particles 
of phrasal verbs in (3) about and in 
sitting down, because predicted by 
the verb, can be considered circum­
stantial Complements.

4a	 Suggested 
preferences for active 
and passive: (1) passive, because 
the first kindergarten in the United 
States announces the main topical 
referent, whereas they refers to peo­
ple in general; (2) either: active 
makes for topic continuity with 1, 
while passive achieves topic con­
tinuity with 3; (3) better active; (4) 
active effectively gets the unthinkable 
in apposition with its explanation, 
while passive would separate these; 
(5) either is possible, but when the 
passive does not fulfil a specific pur­
pose, it is wise to opt for the simpler 
active form; (6) the passive effec­
tively brings the choices in topic conti­
nuity with the dilemma, leaving budget 
in final position, where (7) active 
maintains topic continuity with budget. 
1	
Active and passive combined: The 
first kindergarten in the United States 
was founded 1856 in Watertown, 
Wisconsin (passive). 
2	
Milwaukee residents have traditionally 
benefitted from that legacy (active).
3	
Four-year-old kindergarten has been 
taken as much for granted as summer 
breezes off Lake Michigan (by people 
omitted) (passive).
4	
Now there is a severe budget crunch. 
(no passive).
5	
Milwaukee Public School officials have 
proposed the unthinkable: eliminating 
four-year-old kindergarten (active).
6	
‘Are we to raise property taxes or are 
we to keep four-year-old kindergar­
ten? These are the choices we may 
have to make,’ said a school board 
member (active).
7	
The dilemma has been produced by 
Gov. O’Keefe’s new budget (passive). 
8	
The budget reduces the proportion 
of the state’s share of education costs 
and imposes cost controls on local 
district spending (active).
This version sounds more professional for 
a newspaper. It is said that the pas­
sive is not favoured in AmE. Perhaps 
this explains the fact that in the origi­
nal no passives were used.

The main clause is: ‘Pope Francis used 
his first official trip outside Rome’; the 
second clause ‘to draw attention to 
the thousands who perish during the 
perilous crossing from North Africa to 
Europe’ is a to-infinitive subordinate 
clause of purpose; the third clause ‘con­
demning the “globalisation of indiffer­
ence” shown to the victims’ is an –ing 
supplementive clause which provides 
additional information. The unit at the 
beginning is not a clause but a PP func­
tioning as Adjunct. 
2 	 (1) 
non-equivalence 
(subordinate 
clause of purpose + imperative clause); 
(2) syntactic equivalence (although 
different in type, since the first clause 
is an imperative and the second a 
declarative, the two clauses have a 
semantic relationship of relevance 
and implied cause–effect (3) equiva­
lence (two clauses in a relationship 
of relevance, the second joined with 
pragmatic and); (4) non-equivalence 
(contrastive dependency); (5) equiva­
lence (contrastive coordination).
	
(2) The new law came into force last 
year and, consequently, there are 
now fewer road accidents. (3) We left

tive meaning (→ Chapter 9); (7) One

(COMES); (9) Briefly, the non-progres­
sive forms are used to express a series 
of actions presented as complete and, 
in this text, sudden and for this rea­
son alarming. The sense of imminent 
danger is heightened by the use of 
emphasis (COMES) and by modalising 
the declarative in two cases (can’t and 
it’ll); the sequence of progressives (I’m 
braking, honking, flashing) also contrib­
utes to the sense of urgency.
Unit 39

Clues for the discussion: The itali­
cised verbs in the (a) sentences are 
lexical verbs; in the (b) sentences 
they are catenatives. The subjects 
of 1b and 2b are ‘raised’ from being 
subjects in that-clauses to subjects in 
the sentence: ‘It happened that we 
were away’ to ‘We happened to be 
away’; ‘It appears that he has mis­
understood your explanation’ to ‘He 
appears to have misunderstood your 
explanation.’

of unity and fun. (1) complement, 
(2) complement, (3) complement. 
All take prepositional complements, 
as the nouns celebration, coming and 
expression are derived from verbs.
2 	
A possible analysis contains both. 
The noun criticism is related to the 
verb criticise, and controls the prepo­
sition ‘of’. This preposition ‘of’ can be 
followed by a wh-clause: ‘criticism of 
how the Government reacted to the 
attack’. 
CHAPTER 11

(1a) 
Wonderful 
conversationalist 
and (1b) very good listener are both 
process-orientated. 
	
(2a) the powerful and (2b) the humble 
are adjective–headed generic nomi­
nal groups. 
3 	
The transitive ones are participial 
adjectives; they can be graded 
by more, most and intensified by 
very. They can also function as 
Complements of the Subject and of 
the Object. The intransitive ones do 
not fulfil these criteria. Ticking, fad­
ing and growing are participial modi­
fiers of the head noun. (Notice that, 
in ‘the clock is ticking’, is ticking, are 
fading, etc. are verbs.)

(1) man, jacket; girl, woman; parents; 
shoes, boots; (2) fish; teenager; doorkeeper;

growing; (7) award-winning; (8) 
labour-saving.
Unit 52
1a	 Inflected for grading: risky, blue, 
friendly, small, tight. (Bitterest is nor­
mal but more bitter is probably pre­
ferred to bitterer). The remaining 
adjectives take analytic forms.
1b	 Gradable 
are: shallow (er/more), 
small, probable and fast. The rest are 
not gradable.
2	
(1) Yes, very / quite interesting; (2) 
Fairly hot/ pretty hot; (3) Well, not too

3 	 Possible positions are indicated by #. 
The adverb is given in the unmarked, 
preferred position. (1) #We sometimes 
take long holidays# in mountain­
ous areas#. (2) #Journalists #work­
ing in war zones are often in danger. 
(3) #She gets on well with people 
abroad. (4) #They gave a concert yes­
terday. (5) #The cat gazed longingly 
at the brightly coloured fish in the 
aquarium#. (6) Perhaps you’d better 
take an overcoat with you#. (7) #We 
shall probably leave tomorrow#. (8) 
Hopefully, they have arrived at their 
destination. They have arrived hope­
fully at their destination. Comments: 
Remember that the different positions 
an adverb may occupy determine 
the scope of its reference. When the 
adverb is in initial position, the whole 
clause is in its scope, and may express 
either stance or judgement. Within the 
clause, it focuses mainly on the predi­
cator and so is placed closely before, 
after or within the Predicator: some­
times take, are often, gaze longingly, 
shall probably leave. Other elements 
are sometimes focused, for example 
by restrictive adverbs: He alone, only 
for them. In end-position, the adverb is 
either in focus, or else is almost paren­
thetical, as in: We shall leave tomorrow, 
probably.

However, the whole phrase is an 
invariable idiom, which functions 
as Adjunct NG; (2) fashion: noun;

  Comments: (a) distribution 
of 
these complement forms is as fol­
lows: NG (12), noun (2), pronoun 
(4), -ing cl (4), wh-cl (2); (b) AdjG, 
AdvG, PP (0). (9) consists of two 
coordinated non-finite -ing clauses, 
the second containing a PP whose 
complement is another PP who to 
vote for, with stranded preposition. 
(13) is a NG containing a finite rela­
tive clause post-modifier, people 
say. (14) itself contains a PP, about 
. . ., whose complement is a NG 
containing another PP, of . . . whose 
complement is a NG (14). (17) is a 
NG, people today, whose post-modi­
fier contains a finite relative clause, 
itself containing a PP, in . . . with a NG 
as complement (18). Nos. (20) and 
(21) are coordinated finite clauses, 
functioning together as a complex 
complement 
of the 
preposition 
to. Of in (13), (14) and (15) is a 
grammaticised preposition function­
ing as part of a quantitative modi­
fier (→ 47.4). AdjGs and AdvGs are

downwards from an upright posi­
tion; caused by an obstacle; mak­

texts; e.g. to fall over a cliff; to be over 
an operation; to be over the worst; all 
over the world; conversation over lunch; 
over the telephone; to take a long time 
over something; to have difficulties over 
something.

time (once, times), and engagement in 
an activity(work, war). On: related to 
a state or activity. Out of: related to 
a lack of, or absence of something, 
derived from the basic meaning of 
exit from a container; out of sight, not

view) abstracted from the container 
metaphor. Under: in a disadvantaged 
state, abstracted from the basic 
meaning of ‘in a lower position’ rela­
tive to something else.

phorical use, spanning the period as a 
whole; (3) during refers to points or 
short periods at different times dur­
ing the whole period; (4) through, 
metaphorical use, treating the years 
of problems as having volume, like 
a forest or a tunnel; (5) throughout
