Chapter1
THE WORLD
ALREADY IN
PROGRESS
FRADI
HAD
RECENTLY
DIED,
which made it all the more remark-
able for him to realize that he was
once again awake. That is to say, on
the one hand he was rather surprised,

but on the other hand he was scarcely
surprised at all. He was aware that “re-
cently” was a relative term under the
circumstances, but his attendance at
his own deathbed, surrounded by those
glad to see the last of him, did seem to
have taken place not long before. That,
in any event, was not the point. By any
standard it was a refreshing situation.
He was not in pain. He had been in no
shortage of pain, and had expected (if
anything) to awaken into an environ-
ment where the continuation of mere
physical pain would be the least of his
worries. Renewed life after death was
an article of faith, but the multiplicity
of faiths differed sharply on the nature
of that life, and on the correlation of
one’s circumstances in the next with
one’s behavior in the last. Out of self-
defense Fradi had cleaved to a faith
that stressed accomplishment rather

than slippery value judgments of good
and evil, but he had always harbored
some residuum of doubt. He was quite
happy, though, to be reassured.
One
so rarely gets an article of faith con-
ﬁrmed.
Nevertheless, it was surely a miracle.
“To the gods,” he began ritually, “I offer
thanks -”
“You’re welcome,” said a voice from
behind his head. He opened his eyes.
Above his head was a ceiling of cun-
ningly carved stone inset with patterns
of dancing light.
The vision through
the fovea of his left eye was clear, un-
blurred by the annoying swirl of white
whose curdling presence had signiﬁ-
cantly impaired his accuracy with a
bow. In fact, all his senses seemed to
leap at him with unparalleled clarity,
his deadly hands unhindered by knot-
ted joints, the paths of his thought

undimmed, his natural (or, as one brief
adversary had maintained, unnatural)
vigor fully restored. He was resting on
his back in a long cofﬁn-shaped basin
whose sides he could see through, cov-
ered with a white toga•like garment
fringed in gold. The ﬁgure of a woman,
presumably the one who had spoken,
moved into his ﬁeld of view. She would
not actually be a woman, of course,
since the circumstances were what
they were, but to his newly restored
eyesight no divergence could easily be
found.
He suddenly discovered that
another anatomical feature to whose
activity he had long since bade farewell
had also returned abruptly to consider-
ation.
A squared-off scepter whose face
glowed in mysterious patterns was
in her hand.
The ﬁgure extended it
toward him,
examined its patterns

searchingly, and then moved it slowly
in the Swirl of Sinalla. He raised his
own hand and made the Swirl him-
self, concluding with the extra touch of
ﬁngertips above his heart. The ﬁgure
smiled at him a benign smile. “Behold,”
she said, “for your master approaches.”
The transparent bier pivoted down-
ward, leaving him perched halfway
between the horizontal and the ver-
tical.
The carved wall ahead of him
seemed to dissolve into mist. Beyond
the mist was a vast open place, of dark-
ness above an endless silver plane. In
the middle distance was a pillar of
steam. From the midst of the pillar he
felt the force of a Presence.
The pillar spoke.
“Fradjikan!
You
have been called!”
Fradi felt the words rumble through
his body with an almost-curdling res-
onance as the pillar felt silent.
Al-

though the cloud exhibited no feature
that might be considered an eye, still
he felt it examining him with a deep
and searching gaze. Then, somewhat
to his surprise, he heard a low, vir-
tually subterranean peal of laughter;
no, not laughter really, but more of a
chuckle. A chuckle?
“You have aroused Our mirth,” said
the pillar, “for reasons that are Ours
alone to know. However, this you may
know. In reward for your virtue, your
devotion, and your dedicated develop-
ment of such a useful set of skills, you
have been honored with Our grace.”
He found he had to ﬁght an urge
to babble.
“I am honored beyond all
honors, 0 Preeminent One. I sing your
praises.
There is no way to properly
show my abasement, no way to ade-
quately repay -”
“This is true. However,” the voice of

the Presence said consideringly, “there
is a certain thing you can do. Indeed,
We have granted the benison of our fa-
vor in anticipation of your accomplish-
ment of a speciﬁc task.”
Underscoring the benison, the steam
pillar smiled a beneﬁcent smile. “The
name of this job is Max.”
“Not much to look at, is he?”
Two men stood over a third. The one
who had spoken had hair that cascaded
in curls past his shoulders, and a light
brown mustache to match. He wore a
cloak of severe, high-collared cut but
of expensive weave and fabric. A set
of reading glasses slouched low on his
nose; a wide-brimmed hat wound with
fur trim rested on the table beside him.
He was, in short, a merchant, and not
a struggling one.
“No, Meester Groot,” said his com-
panion. “Companion,” of course, would

by all accepted standards of the day
have been too strong a word, implying
a degree of social equality to which
even
enlightened
merchants
would
rarely lower themselves. The relation-
ship between Haalsen Groot and his
employees, though, was scarcely typi-
cal, since the esteemed Meester Groot
did not restrict his activities - or his
colleagues - to those a scrupulously
proper merchant might assume with-
out reproach. The third member of the
tableau, the recumbent one, provided
ample illustration of this point.
Admittedly, Haalsen Groot was no
colossus.
Nevertheless, for a ﬁgure
half again as tall as Meester Groot,
the mass and bulk of the man on the
cot should have been proportionately
greater as well.
Where one would
have expected only the sleek curves
of corded muscles, though, the sight

of stretched, somewhat mangy skin
and the protruding angles of bones,
sunken cheeks and hollowed eye sock-
ets betrayed a barbarian swordsman
far from home and lost in the strange
convolutions of civilization.
He had
yet to open his eyes. Instead, he was
spending his time and energy on the
occasional fever chill, uncontrollably
chattering his teeth and contorting
his body into strange representations
of the fetal position, as perhaps il-
lustrated by one of the members of
the Nightmare Realism school of mod-
ern painters.
Following this line of
thought, Meester Groot commented,
“Life may be life, but aesthetics are
certainly aesthetics,” to which his clerk
replied, as was his habit, “Indeed so,
sir.” The barbarian interrupted with a
deep liquid cough, a ﬁne froth of pink
bubbles appearing on his lips.

“You are sure you found the right
man,” Meester Groot said suddenly.
“He was booked under the name of
Svin,” said the clerk methodically. “The
arrest record listed his last job as cara-
van guard, so the circumstances would
seem appropriate.
Once fed, cleaned,
and healed, he’ll most likely match the
description as well; he is fairly distinc-
tive for this far south. Should I make
further inquiries?”
“No, Julio, I take no exception with
your effort. I suppose you’d best send
for the doctor. Sounding a bit tubercu-
lar, our friend here, don’t you think?”
“Indeed so. I expect the physic mo-
mentarily.” Julio gave a cough of his
own, but a much more discreet and re-
ﬁned one. “Do you have any idea why
Meester Maximillian wanted you to
secure this particular specimen, sir?”
Haalsen Groot kept his gaze on the

barbarian as he spoke, but, behind
their lenses, his eyes appeared to be
looking somewhere else entirely.
“To
Max,
adventuring is an improvisa-
tional art. He likes to have a varietal
selection of raw materials at hand from
which to mold.” He also has a streak
of excess sentimentality, Meester Groot
reminded himself, as well as a certain
philosophy of the world. Most likely he
met this fellow on that caravan in his
recent resume and thought he could
make a modern man out of him. What-
ever the exact details of his interest
in Svin, here, Max was rousing him-
self to more activity than Groot had
seen in years.
Events threatened to
become intriguing.
These events to
come would not be safe, perhaps, and
they would be (most likely) ill-advised,
but they would certainly not be boring.
He reminded himself to order more

sandbags.
Bellowing an inchoate battle cry in
an impressive display of sheer vocal
power, the former Lion of the Oolvaan
Plain pushed off his perch on the
heavy iron chandelier, dislodging half-
a-dozen lit candles in the process, and
plunged downward, his massive sword
twirling lethally around his body. His
opponent, who had been peering in-
quisitively around the room trying to
determine what the Lion might be up
to this time, brought his own rapier
into line. As the Lion descended, his
mightily thewed legs curling into a
crouch beneath him, his adversary’s
blade caught him in a sharp rap behind
the calves, introducing an unexpected
element of angular momentum.
The
Lion began to revolve backward, the
ﬂoor came up as his opponent stepped
smartly out of the way, and with an

unwelcome thud he found himself ﬂat
on his back looking up at the expand-
ing formation of still-ﬂaming candles
following him like dying comets to-
ward the boards.
The tip of a rapier
appeared in his ﬁeld of vision, blur-
ring into a glint of red highlights as it
caught the reﬂections of guttering ﬁre.
Pieces of candles bounced away to all
sides.
The sounds of swishing and slicing
died. The Lion moistened the thumb
and foreﬁnger of one hand against his
lips and raised them to his forehead,
crossed his eyes, and pinched gingerly
in the midst of the glob of wax coagu-
lating above his eyebrows. He was re-
warded by a quick sizzle that faded off
into a gurgling hiss. “You missed one,”
the Lion said.
“It’s your own damn fault,” said his
adversary.
“Chalk it up as a lesson

in humility. Who the hell ever accom-
plished anything with one of those
big grandstanding moves in the ﬁrst
place?”
“I’ll have you know I once ambushed
a bear. “
“By falling off a lighting ﬁxture? And
which scar did that one leave you with,
hmm?”
The Lion snorted. “Shut up and help
me off the ﬂoor. My back’s killing me.
And toss me one of those towels.” A
moment’s leverage, suitably applied,
resulted in the Lion becoming vertical
once again. He draped the towel over
his naked chest and led the way to
the sideboard.
“I’ve got half a mind
to join you,” he said after a moment,
easing the words out around a large
chunk of roast beef.
“I’ve missed the
last two Knittings, and the one be-
fore that must have been, oh, twenty,

twenty-ﬁve years ago.”
“Sure,” Max said, “go ahead, come.
Forget all that stuff you were telling
me last week about how you’re the
only responsible force holding this city
together and getting the warehouses
rebuilt on schedule, not to mention
the good government seminar you’re
putting your old friend Kaar through.
Let Roosing Oolvaya sink back into the
river - who needs it anyway?”
The Lion glared at him, an effect
somewhat
spoiled
by
the
protrud-
ing cud of half-chewed meat in one
cheek. “It’s my kids,” he said, “I should
never have had kids in the ﬁrst place.
That was the beginning of the end.
They warp your whole sensibility. You
should have some.”
“You forget,” said Max, “I do have
some. I have yours. Don’t think I don’t
regret it, either.”

The Lion resumed chewing, a look
of satisfaction on his face.
He might
have been the one who’d ended up ﬂat
on his back on the ﬂoor, but that didn’t
mean he was the one who’d lost. “So,
you think you can teach my son some-
thing?”
“He’s got two arms and a brain, and
at least a full complement of normal
senses,” Max said cautiously. “I don’t
see why not. Should be able to put a
little maturity on him, at any rate, if
he doesn’t get carved up ﬁrst.”
A rather feral grin curled the left
side of the Lion’s mouth. He ran the
towel over his forehead, catching the
sheen of water draining down past
his headband from his long black hair.
“You studied with no master you’ll lay
name to, you ﬁght in a mad hodge-
podge without recognizable style, no
part of the room is safe from you, ei-

ther, and on top of that you know the
value of life - by damn, I like that in a
man! Are you sure you’re not my son?”
Max raised an eyebrow and glanced
at the Lion.
True, they were about
the same height, and they both had
straightish black hair, although Max’s
ran more toward the wavy and the
Lion’s was running signiﬁcantly to-
ward gray,
but Max had a lighter,
more lithe build than the Lion’s heavy-
boned, mass-of-the-earth eastern-plains
solidity.
Max was also fully at home
with the company of a highly function-
ing mind. The Lion, Max had discov-
ered, had a brain with which no one
could ﬁnd fault, but was reticent to the
point of pulling teeth about actually
using it, rather than the largest conve-
nient sword or the nearest wieldable
chair. Beyond temperament, there was
also the issue of age to consider.
“It

would seem unlikely,” Max said. “Then
again, who can say?
If you can pro-
vide a reasonable inheritance, though,
you’re welcome to adopt me.”
“How did you pick up that nickname
anyway, the ‘Vaguely Disreputable’?”
The Lion had retrieved his sword and
was idly using it to cut a thin slice of
corned beef from the other large hunk
on the serving platter.
Suddenly he
whirled, ﬂinging the slice of meat off
the end of the blade toward Max’s eyes
and launching the rest of his body after
it. Max immediately fell backward and
tucked into a roll. He’d been preparing
himself for something of the sort, hav-
ing found that the Lion enjoyed trying
to lull his opponent off guard before
ﬂailing out in some unexpected at-
tack. The corned beef ﬂew over Max’s
body and hit the wall behind him but
the Lion’s sword, following it, slashed

down instead.
Max stopped his back somersault
perched on his shoulders and reversed
direction with a sharpness that im-
plied he’d had this move in mind from
the start, springing forward ﬁrst to
a ﬁrm-footed crouch, then to a clinch
directly up against the charging Lion’s
chest, and then, grasping the towel
still dangling around the Lion’s neck
and giving it a twist and a stiff enough
yank to bring a ﬂush of sudden purple
to the Lion’s face, and using his pull
on the towel to amplify his vertical
momentum, ﬂipped himself head-over-
heels over the Lion’s shoulder as the
Lion catapulted forward toward the
ﬂoor.
Max landed atop the sideboard, care-
fully keeping his feet clear of the food.
The clang of the Lion’s sword against
the ﬂoor was followed immediately by

the familiar sound of the rest of the
Lion joining it.
“Acrobats, “ said the
Lion in a mufﬂed voice.
“I’ve always
detested acrobats. Rabbits, the bunch
of them, always hopping out of your
way.”
“I keep telling you,” said Max, “agility
can outmaneuver the mass of a broadsw
any day.”
The Lion sprang back to his feet
with a fair show of agility on his own
part and retrieved his slice of corned
beef from its perch on a wall sconce.
“Tell the world about it,” he said. “Ac-
robatics are ﬁne if everything falls
out just right.
If not, you’ve just set
yourself up for the strike of death.” As
he swung back toward the sideboard,
he saw Max standing on it, his arms
folded, tapping one foot next to a bowl
ﬁlled with roasted potatoes.
“Oh, all
right,” the Lion said, “I’m ﬁnished for

today. Go ahead and make yourself a
sandwich.
“Never ﬁt will,” said a croaking voice
from beneath the table, “this.” Some-
thing black and leathery moved behind
one of the table legs, virtually lost at
the back of the cabin in the shadows
cast by the single lamp hanging by a
chain from the ceiling. A wooden crate
grated raspingly along the deck boards
under the table and then crunched up
against the wall.
“It does seem, if I may be so bold,
that we have been spending the ma-
jority of our effort on merely moving
the household from one location to the
next,” another voice remarked from
just outside the door. A large heap of
books precariously bound up with a
net appeared in the doorway, followed
by the speaker, who was attempting
to balance the volumes in a pair of

unnaturally long and slender arms
that appeared to be wrapped so se-
curely around the bundle that they
were bending not only at the elbows
but also, although that was certainly
an illusion, midway down the exagger-
ated forearms as well. The skin of the
exposed forearms was colored a more
than incidentally greenish hue.
A muttering black cloak emerged
from underneath the table and scut-
tled off to the side as the taller ﬁgure
let the books subside with a heavy
thump onto its upper surface. The top
of the cloak’s hood was barely higher
than the level of the tabletop, reveal-
ing that working under the table was
no serious inconvenience to its wearer.
“Job did take I not with sole purpose
furniture to arrange,” said the mut-
terer.
A third being, this one human, had

been sitting at the table in question try-
ing desperately to remain engrossed in
deciphering a letter. This being looked
up from the heap of netted books which
had just entombed said letter to a
depth precluding immediate recovery.
“What was that, Haddo?” he said, with
an air of resigned disorientation.
“The matter on which Master Haddo
was
commenting,”
said
the
green-
skinned one, stretching out his kinked
arms, “was that of the purely menial
activities to which our employment
with you has led us of late.”
“Plainly can speak for myself I,”
Haddo croaked. “Intercessor for need
nil is.” The hood swiveled to peer accus-
ingly upward, revealing a continued
expanse of fuliginous black broken
only by two glowing orange sparks
at around the right position for eyes.
“Speaks yet Wroclaw truth.”

“Oh, come on now,” said the man at
the table. “You know the situation. You
know I’m not real fond of it myself.”
“Yet sit you table at,” said Haddo,
“while heavy bundles drag we.”
“But I’m the boss,” the Great Karlini
pointed out.
“I’m supposed to sit at
tables and think.
You’re supposed to
handle things like packing and lifting,
that’s what I hired you for.”
Wroclaw gave a discreet cough. “Not
quite true, if I may remind you, sir.”
“Said not you, ‘For all is one, and
for one is all’?” Haddo grumbled indig-
nantly.
“If you don’t like the job, Haddo,
you’re not bound to it,” said Karlini.
“I don’t own you; you’re more than
welcome to take off and go back to
wherever you came from. Where was
that, by the way?”
“Hinterlands,” said Haddo. “Do not

say I, to wish leave I. It the right of civ-
ilized beings is all complain to, admit
you must.”
“Then what do you want, Haddo?
You want another raise?”
“Satisfying current contract is. Right-
ful appreciation wish I, or treatment of
equality.”
Karlini glanced sidelong at Wroclaw.
“Wroclaw?”
“I believe Master Haddo would wish
either to see you yourself sharing in
the heavier work, or lacking that, to be
properly entreated to continue bearing
the burden himself.”
“Ahead never get will you,” Haddo
snapped at Wroclaw, “when coat your
words you sugar with.
Question one
have I: why beg you not I?”
“You want me to beg you to keep
working?” said the Great Karlini. “Why
should I do that?”

“Fringe beneﬁt,” Haddo stated. “To
contract refer. Also, for you is no skin
off.”
“Oh, very well,” said Karlini. “Please,
please, Haddo, won’t you stay and con-
tinue this demeaning but nevertheless
essential work? I beg you. How’s that?”
“Bad,” said Haddo, “not is.”
“What about me?” inquired Wroclaw.
Karlini pushed himself, to his feet
and glared at Wroclaw. Then he trans-
ferred his glare to his stool, growled
“Do you want me to beg you, too?”
in its direction, abruptly drew back
one booted foot and swept it forward,
connecting with one rod of the stool’s
tripod base with a solid thunk, and
turned and stalked out of the cabin,
limping slightly. Haddo and Wroclaw
looked at each other, then stared af-
ter Karlini as he made his way onto
the deck. “Fancy that,” Wroclaw com-

mented.
The deck of the river barge was
covered by bales of fabric wrapped in
watertight cloth, lengths of neatly cut
hardwood, barrels of pickled ﬁsh, and
whatever else could be sold for more at
some other spot on the river away from
Roosing Oolvaya than it had originally
cost at Roosing Oolvaya itself.
Over
it all were the scrambling members of
the crew, stowing the goods in the cen-
ter of the craft away from the sweeps
or beneath the benches for the rowers.
For all Karlini knew they’d be covering
the benches next; the barge would be
traveling downstream, with the cur-
rent, so you’d ﬁgure there wouldn’t
be much need for rowing, but Karlini
was the ﬁrst to admit he was no sailor.
He stepped aside as two wharfmen
came up the gangplank from the pier,
propelling a recalcitrant goat between

them, and then made his way gingerly
across the deck.
A woman was sitting on the port
gunwale, her legs dangling over the
side, wearing the same breech-and-
tunic traveling outﬁt as Karlini. She
had an inkpot balanced on the gunwale
to her left, a quill pen perched behind
one ear, and an open ledger book in
her lap, and was gazing with an ab-
stracted stare out across the harbor,
occasionally eyeing the dark-haired
young woman seated to her left. Kar-
lini seated himself to her right, keep-
ing a watchful eye on the inkpot, and
gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. She
turned toward him with a small start.
“Ouch,” said Karlini. He rubbed at
the long streak of black ink now track-
ing across his right cheek toward his
ear.
Roni dropped the offending pen into

her book and set both off to the side.
“What do you expect if you sneak up on
me like that when I’m working?” she
said. “Don’t do that, you’re only smear-
ing it.”
Karlini inspected his hand. It was
indeed largely covered with ink, proba-
bly a fairly good indication of the likely
state of his face at the moment, too.
The young woman on Roni’s other side
emitted a strangled yelping sound, her
mouth screwed shut and her face con-
torted into an agonized expression of
controlled repression.
Her hand ﬂew
up to cover her mouth as yet another
yelp escaped.
“Go ahead, why don’t you,” Karlini
said, a note of what was hopefully
only mock exasperation coloring his
own voice.
The girl’s face uncorked,
a spasm of chuckles spewed out like
the cloud of bubbles from a shaken

bottle of carbonated wine, and then
she doubled over, clutching her sides,
overcome by the wave of giggling.
“I
must really look wonderful this time,”
he announced with resignation.
“Hold still,” said Roni, producing a
cloth from a side pocket and apply-
ing it to Karlini’s cheek.
“Tildy, why
don’t you go and try that new problem
set, and I’ll review it with you later.”
Tildamire, the oldest known child of
the former Lion of the Oolvaan Plain,
managed a nod, swung off the gun-
wale, and staggered off across the deck,
holding her exercise book to her chest.
“She’s a good kid,” Roni continued,
“and I think she’s going to turn out to
have a real ﬂair for math, so don’t get
exasperated at her. Promise?”
“Oh, very well,” said the Great Kar-
lini. “But do I really look that ridicu-
lous?”

“Of course, dear,” Roni said serenely,
“but you wear it so well. How’s our load-
ing coming?”
“The staff’s restless again,” Karlini
said. “I don’t blame them. We’ll all feel
better when we’re on the move.”
“I suppose. Did you untangle the let-
ter from Groot?”
“Haddo and Wroclaw are redecorat-
ing the cabin on top of it. Anyway, the
letter’s probably only another warning
to be careful with his boat.”
“I don’t know,” Roni said.
“There,
now you can appear in public. Give me
your hand. But about this letter - do
you think we can trust the crew?”
“It’s Groot’s boat,” said Karlini. “It’s
Groot’s crew, too. You might as well ask
if we can trust Groot.”
“Well, can we?”
A seagull ﬂapped down and perched
itself on Karlini’s shoulder. He ignored

it. “As far as anyone, I guess. Depends
on where the proﬁt is. He’s always had
a soft spot for Max, though.”
“Haven’t we all,” remarked Roni.
“That’s better.
Try to wait at least
ﬁve minutes before disgracing yourself
again, will you please, dear?”
“You knew what you were in for
when you married me,” Karlini said.
“Right.
I told you I didn’t wasn’t
ready for children and I ended up mar-
ried to one instead .”
“Would you like me to give you back
your receipt?”
“Shut up,” Roni said, “you idiot.”
“Very well, dear.” Karlini said, affect-
ing an aggrieved expression.
“How’s
the research coming?”
“It’s hard trying to work out of boxes,
with the apparatus packed away, but I
think the trip won’t be a total loss. I do
have enough data put by to just sit and

think about stuff for a stretch.”
“You won’t, though, if I know you.
You still think all this is leading some-
where?”
“Oh, yes,” said Roni, “no question
about that.
The biologically cellu-
lar roots of magical power, no less.
Whether we can understand it well
enough to harness it, of course, still
remains to be seen.”
“We all have conﬁdence in you,” Kar-
lini said.
“Conﬁdence isn’t the point.
We’re
dealing with intricate systems, tremen-
dous energies, things we’re not even
close to being able to comprehend. Tra-
ditional magic is dangerous enough as
it is, and that’s when you already know
what you’re supposed to be doing, and
yet here we are trying to forge new
tools out of a whole new ﬁeld. It’s in-
timidating as anything. If you ask me,

I’ll take pure research over this any
day.”
The seagull, which had been nib-
bling inquisitively at Karlini’s earlobe,
hopped into the air, beat its wings once
for balance, and landed nimbly atop
his head.
“Why does this thing keep
following me around?” he said, craning
his eyes upward in an attempt to gain
early warning of the gull’s next move.
“Maybe it thinks there’s something
lovable about you. There’s no account-
ing for tastes, I suppose.”
A leathery, attention-getting “hur-
rumph” sounded from behind them.
Karlini shifted his position to crane
his head around without dislodging
the seagull. It was Haddo, the bright
sunlight doing no more than the gloom
in the cabin to reveal a single detail
within his hood.
“Bird,” announced
Haddo, “must ﬂy I.”

“Go ahead,
Haddo,” said Karlini,
“and thank you. We’ll see you later.”
Haddo scuttled away. “‘Thank you’?”
said Roni.
“Don’t ask.” They watched the pass-
ing water trafﬁc for a moment. Then
Karlini said abruptly, “Don’t let Max
stampede you into this, dear. He’ll sur-
vive.”
“Yes, but that’s just the point, dear,
don’t you see?” Roni said.
“Will he?
And will we?”
I took a last look around my ofﬁce. I
know it’s ridiculous to get sentimental
about places, especially rental ones,
but the ofﬁce and I had covered a lot
of ground with each other, so to speak.
At any rate, I couldn’t begin to count
the number of times I’d covered the
ﬂoor of the ofﬁce with my own body,
and for all I knew some of the copious
amounts of organic ﬂuids I’d spilled in

that place were still dripping through
knotholes to the ﬂoor below. The room
was as bare as I’d found it, which re-
ally wasn’t that bare; I’d known that
anything personal I brought in was
as likely as not to wind up smashed
against the wall, if not across my head.
The old bashed-in shield still hung
over the entrance door. It had come in
with the place and would go out with it,
too. It was only in the last few weeks of
investigation that I’d discovered that
the shield had not actually been mine,
receiving its dent in some campaign of
my youth, but then it had only been
a few months or so before, when I’d
fallen in with Max and his crew for
the ﬁrst time, that I’d realized I had
virtually no memory of my life before
I’d arrived in Roosing Oolvaya seven
years earlier.
The Curse of Namelessness, as Max

had called it, was apparently not some-
thing you ran across every day, even if
you were a sorcerer specializing in that
sort of thing. Max wasn’t that type of
specialist, or at least I didn’t think
he was; his strongest talent that I’d
been able to identify was an absolute
genius for driving people crazy with
cryptic references and vague allusions
he would consistently refuse to amplify.
Well, two could play at that game, I’d
thought initially, but it was turning
out to be harder than I’d ﬁgured, since
one of the major items of analysis was
my own mind. Don’t get me wrong. I
wasn’t nearly at the end of my patience
with Max, as exasperating as he could
be.
Any aggravation I went through
with him was pretty mild compared to
knowing I might still have a serious
enemy out there, somewhere, who had
hit me with this spell in the ﬁrst place

and had not only wiped out my past
but even any knowledge of my own
name.
Magic. Things always come back to
magic, don’t they?
I hate magic.
Of
course, more and more my own life was
coming to be wound up with the stuff.
I knew I was in trouble when I found
myself hoping that my memory prob-
lems could be traced to merely being
hit over the head one too many times,
but Shaa, the physician, had assured
me that my condition was not, as he
put it, “a simple organic amnesia.” Re-
alizing I’d rather have physical brain
damage than have to keep dealing with
magic didn’t make me feel more secure
about my sanity, but -
There was a knock on the closed
door.
Oh, no, I thought, not again.
The
last time there’d been someone at that

door who’d managed to approach with-
out triggering a squeak from the stair-
case I’d adjusted speciﬁcally to act as
an adjunct doorbell, it had meant trou-
ble, big trouble; the trouble, in fact,
that had landed me with Max and
his friends in the ﬁrst place, and had
nearly resulted in the destruction of
all of Roosing Oolvaya to boot. While
I was contemplating escape through
the side window and over the roof, the
locked door opened and a woman came
in.
Unlike the last time, when the vis-
itor had been pale and tweedy and
merely radiated an air of deadly pur-
pose, this one had the burnished skin
of a person who spent a lot of leisure
time sitting on a tropical beach lis-
tening to the waves.
And watch-
ing the sharks at play.
The major
thing about her that reminded me of

Gashanatantra was that aura of “We’ll
do it my way or we’ll pull off a few ﬁn-
gers and then try it again,” the kind of
attitude that probably passed for con-
ventional light chitchat in her usual
circles. I didn’t need the warning tin-
gle in the back of my head to know
that whatever the mess before had re-
ally been about, it was back in motion
again.
I was about to say, “How’s your pal,
Gash?” thus getting in the ﬁrst word,
bolstering my fortitude with a typical
display of hard-boiled effrontery, and
making it appear that I understood
everything that was going on, and
then some. But even though it seemed
the perfect way of opening a conver-
sational match of wits between us, an
uncharacteristic burst of caution froze
my jaw. Instead, I merely leaned back
against the side wall next to the win-

dow, crossed my arms over my chest,
and eyed her with as unﬂinching a
gaze as I could muster on such short
notice.
The door swung shut behind
her of its own accord, a cute trick I was
sorry I’d never practiced myself while
business was slow, and she planted her
feet ﬁrmly on the ﬂoor in front of it,
spread at shoulder width, letting her
arms hang, the palms open and facing
toward me and the air curdling slightly
within their grasp. Her eyes were the
color of lightning.
The seconds ground slowly past.
I
felt like something invisible was trying
to mash me backward through the wall,
but that my body was shrugging off
the pressure with the well-mortared
ﬁrmness of a barricade of bricks.
It
could have just been my mental state.
It could have been, but I knew it
wasn’t. Unless I missed my guess, the

metabolism link Gashanatantra had
hooked between us was automatically
drawing on his own personal protec-
tion ﬁeld. At the moment, the shunt
that linked us appeared to actually be
giving me some help; if so, it was just
about the ﬁrst time. Fortunately, the
protection effect was totally automatic.
My own attempts to draw deliberately
on the link had primarily revealed
that where magic was concerned I had
deep reservoirs of total incompetence
whose surfaces I had barely begun to
scratch. There was one thing I could
do, though, that fell in my own de-
partment. Rather than merely glower
at the woman by the door, or let my
jaw assume its practiced wide-open
position on my chest, I forced my face
into something approaching a sarcas-
tic grin. I ﬁgured the effect was less
than completely successful on the sar-

casm front, but I was hoping the subtle
element of mockery I was aiming for
would balance that out.
After a moment whose true length I
wouldn’t have ventured to guess, the
eyes across the room narrowed.
Her
ﬁngers folded inward as the tortured
air in her hands rippled and became
clear.
The pressure against my body
eased. “So,” she remarked. Her voice
had the tenor of a violin string plucked
with a pick of broken glass, smooth and
lyrical above a whiplash spike.
I kept my grin from widening with
relief; this had probably been only the
starter. “So,” I said also, for good mea-
sure.
“‘So?’ All you can say is ‘So?’ I’d have
thought better of you, you, always so
proud of your reputation for having
the perfect thing to say at the right
time. Or do I still hold that much of a

spell over you?” She tilted her head up
and to one side and chuckled, but her
chuckle held a disturbing hint of some
nasty joke in it, barely contained.
“My reputation is occasionally ex-
panded in the telling,” I temporized.
As far as I knew, I had never seen her
before in my life.
“In a way.” said the woman, “I sup-
pose this was the perfect refuge for
you. I’m almost embarrassed how long
it took to track you down.” That’s what
she said, but she didn’t look embar-
rassed at all.
“Really,” I said. “How nice. I’m sorry
I put you to so much trouble. To what
exactly do I owe the honor of all that
effort, as well as the pleasure of your
visit?”
“Now that I see you I’d know you any-
where,” she said musingly. “Even if you
do have a different body, even if you

are hiding out in a rattrap room in a
ﬂea-infested town. Scarcely your style
at all, which is, of course, the beauty
of it. I can even understand your not
giving me a proper greeting. Rest as-
sured, though, my dear, certain things
can survive any number of new bodies.
Come over here and kiss me.”
I tried to keep the gagging feeling in
my throat from becoming loud enough
to be heard across the room. “Don’t you
think that should wait?” I said instead,
hoping I didn’t sound too much like a
drowning frog.
She scowled. It was a mean scowl. I
was glad it wasn’t directed at me, only
at whoever she thought I was. I was
only sorry that whoever that really was
didn’t happen to be around at the mo-
ment. “Very well,” she said ﬁnally. “So
that’s the way you’re going to be about
it.
I would have thought you would

let yourself unbend that far, but then
again, I do know you, so perhaps not.
Nevertheless,” and the scowl crawled
again toward her equally nasty grin, “I
am still your wife.”
“How are you feeling?” said Jurtan
Mont.
“When one considers the alterna-
tives,” said Zalzyn Shaa, “not too bad.”
He plopped down to sit on a convenient
rock.
“After all, look around us.” A
sweep of his arm took in the shrub-
covered hillside, the neat patches of
farmland falling away from them in
long cultivated waves, the low gorge of
the River Oolvaan and the beginnings
of the mountains beyond, and, slightly
downstream to their right, the sprawl
and bustle of Roosing Oolvaya.
“Yeah,” said Mont, following Shaa’s
gesture, “what?”
“Come now. Surely you have more of

an aesthetic sense than that. Or have
I been wasting my time on a toad?”
Mont dropped the sack containing
the herbs Shaa had been collecting
next to the rock and lowered himself to
the ground. “Okay, it’s a nice view, but
what does that have to do with how
your heart is?”
“If one is going to push one’s limits,”
Shaa said sagely, “one might as well
do it where there’s something pleasant
to look at. If one’s limits obligingly re-
treat, then the pleasant vista can serve
as sufﬁcient instant gratiﬁcation for at-
tempting the exercise in the ﬁrst place.
Even if the limits remain in force, one
can at least console oneself with the
thought that one might easily not have
anything to look at at all, pleasant or
otherwise.”
“So you’ve got more energy?” Shaa
had set a fairly brisk pace up the hill.

“Your breathing seems pretty good.”
“To complain would seem churlish,”
Shaa agreed. At least, Mont thought
that’s what he was doing; it was always
hard to tell with Shaa. “Have you ﬁn-
ished packing?”
Mont grimaced.
“Yeah, I guess.
I
don’t know. I don’t even know what I
should be packing anyway.”
“Whatever you can carry without un-
duly aggravating the horse.”
“Why do I have to be going on a
horse? I don’t like horses.”
“Neither does Max,” said Shaa. “How-
ever, he is less fond of walking.
It’s
known as a trade-off.”
“Well, I don’t like Max either. Why
can’t I be going with you?
Why do I
have to go to start with?”
Shaa opened the sack, peered within,
ﬁngered thoughtfully through his lat-
est collection of weeds, selected one

slender stalk of dusty and purple-
edged green, mashed its bulbous end
between his thumb and foreﬁnger, and
inserted the oozing tip in the comer of
his mouth. “Did you ask a question?”
he said.
“You’re like trying to punch smoke,
you know that?” Jurtan said.
“You
know perfectly well I asked a ques-
tion.”
Shaa rolled the weed around with
his tongue for a moment before re-
sponding.
“Maximillian has, rather
valiantly I might add, offered to assist
in your seasoning. I’m not sure I un-
derstand why, but then I’m not certain
I understand why I’ve been spending
so much of my own time with you
when you persist in being so urchinish.
There are some who would pay for the
opportunity that is being thrust upon
you gratis, but from your lips does a

word of thanks fall? Not in my hear-
ing, and I venture not in anyone else’s
either.”
“I never said I wanted to be an ad-
venturer,” said Mont, “or whatever you
all think you are, and I don’t particu-
larly want to try to ﬁght with a sword.
I’d rather work on the - well, the other
stuff.”
“They are not, as you are well aware,
mutually exclusive, and the swordwork
may not only help to occupy you on the
way to the big time, but may help you
when we get there.”
“The big time? I thought we were go-
ing to the City of the Empire.”
“Merely a synonym,” Shaa said, “as
you may come to appreciate if you
survive, a state which may have some-
thing to do with your not exasperating
one of us beyond the bounds of our
professional courtesy.”

“Well, excuse me for living,” Mont
said sarcastically. Shaa was pleased to
note that his command of the proper
tone was improving.
Then again, of
course, as Shaa didn’t mind acknowl-
edging, he did have more than one
expert teacher.
“But what if this ad-
venturing stuff isn’t for me, anyway? I
mean, you’ve got an excuse. You’ve got
your curse.”
“I do indeed, and I am heartily sick
of it. This time there may actually be a
chance of slipping out of it; that is why
I’m going.”
Mont snorted. “You’re not sick of it
at all. I mean, you may be sick of the
curse, but you’re not sick of adventur-
ing, I know you’re not. You like it.”
“I like it more when I have some
discretion about the situation.
The
thought that it is quite likely to bring
about my death does not exactly exert

a calming inﬂuence, either.”
“I thought adventuring was sup-
posed to be risky.”
“This is true. Yet my risk factors are
not merely those of the typical job de-
scription,” Shaa said, “as you know per-
fectly well.”
“That’s a pretty good one, when you
think about it,” said Mont.
“You’re
cursed to keep running after some-
thing that’s probably going to kill you.”
“Hmm, yes,” Shaa commented, “it is
rather classic.
My brother did know
what he was doing.”
Mont actually made a small “whoof”in
noise, as though he had been punched
unexpectedly beneath the diaphragm.
His mouth fell open. “Your -” he said.
“Wait a second.
I thought you had a
sister.”
“I do have a sister.
I also have a
brother.”

“But I thought your sister was the
one causing you all the trouble.”
Shaa swiveled an eye in Mont’s direc-
tion. “One of the major things you have
yet to learn is not to presume that just
because you know one fact, you know
all, or just because you know facts, you
know their proper interpretation.”
“But - “ said Mont, “but -”
“Why should I tell my life’s story
to a lout who wants to rot in Roosing
Oolvaya for the rest of his days?”
Mont subsided into a sullen pout.
“I’ll go with Max, “ he said eventually.
“Don’t do me any favors.
You still
appear reluctant,” Shaa observed. “Is
there some other hidden frustration
you wish to vent?”
“No,” said Mont. “Yes. Why do we
have to go off and try to get in more
trouble, anyway?
I mean, Roosing
Oolvaya’s an out-of-the-way kind of

place,
nothing much ever happens
here, and now that that whole bit
with the coup and Oskin Yahlei and
so forth’s ﬁnished with, I’m sure noth-
ing’s going to happen again for years
and years, if it ever does, so why can’t
we just stay here and do the same
training and -”
“ A characteristic example,” stated
Shaa, “of limited thinking, wishful at
its source, narrow in its development.
Events have a way of seeking one out,
under their own momentum, or -” Shaa
lengthened the word, so as to override
the objection Mont, backtracking to-
ward literal-mindedness,
was about
to voice- “or” (he repeated for good
measure) “the characters behind the
events, caught up in the same momen-
tum, are the seekers; the difference is
of semantic concern alone. The fact re-
mains that events, once loosed, are as

difﬁcult to contain as vapor in a burst
balloon.
There may in fact be some
entropic correlation. We may want to
consult Roni, I believe that falls in her
area.”
Mont,
his jaw set,
was clinging
grimly to his original idea, always a
difﬁcult thing when you happened to
be waging a conversation with Shaa,
but then he had been getting a lot of
practice, at that, anyway. “You’re being
ridiculous.
Why couldn’t I just stay
here and be a clerk or a merchant or
something? Things like you’re talking
about never seek out clerks.”
“These events may not, although I
could recite a list of counter-examples
that might curdle your hair, but what
about your father? Would he seek you
out, hmm? And another point for your
consideration, just as a reminder. Yes,
I have a curse, but you have a gift. Tell

me, my friend - which is the stronger
motivator? Perhaps you could just stay
at home, though, at that,” Shaa mused.
“Would you want to?”
Mont opened his mouth, then paused,
his head tilted slightly to one side, vi-
sions of heroism (Shaa suspected) no
doubt circulating in his mind. “I guess
not,” Mont said slowly.
“I just want
to know my options, that’s all. I don’t
want to be dragged around like a toy
with a pull string. I want to be able to
make choices for myself.”
“What more does any rational per-
son want? A valid goal, if an ambitious
one. How, do you suppose, would one
go about achieving it?”
One of these days, Mont thought,
he might learn to see these coming.
“Luck?”
Both of them knew that Mont had
merely been tossing out a useless re-

sponse to buy himself some time to
really think about the question, but
Shaa was willing to grant him some
room for cogitation at the moment; he
was feeling expansive. “Far too random
for a man planning to rise above the
march of fate. You might as well say
you hope to hide from the gods, from
destiny, from good fortune as well as
bad, indeed, from the world at large.”
“Uh,” said Mont, “as a matter of fact,
that thought had crossed my mind.
Why not hide out? Isn’t that what Max
has been doing, and what about you,
yourself?”
“Ah,” said Shaa, “indeed.
Hiding
out can without question be a valuable
strategy, if not a totally open-ended
one, but that doesn’t mean it’s at all a
matter of sitting back and staying off
the streets. How effective do you think
it might be for someone whose primary

skill is a reliance on luck?”
“All right, all right, I can tell what
you’re getting at.
If you want to try
to control your fate, you have to know
what you’re doing, and if you want to
do that, you’ve got to have skills. Expe-
rience. Right?”
Shaa raised an eyebrow, the expres-
sion on his face affable, and then let
the motion of his forehead draw his
head back for an appreciation of the
clear sky above.
A waggling speck
moved far overhead, a speck that could
perhaps have been a large bird.
“But what’s the urgency now? Why
do we have to leave town all of a sud-
den now, after sitting around for a
month.
I mean, nothing’s happening
yet. Is it?”
“One never wants to be the last to
know,” Shaa said sagely.
“One must
always expect the worst.
There is a

certain attitude one must strive to cul-
tivate. One must always think, in the
midst of the clearest sky, that some-
thing could be happening already.”

Chapter2
A CRISIS OF
IDENTITY
“SINCE YOU WANT TO BRING
THAT UP,” I said, “you might as well
sit down.”
The desk was staying with the ofﬁce,
too, not that I’d have had much use for
it on the road, and along with it the
two chairs. I took the one at the busi-

ness side of the desk and the woman I’d
never seen before took the other. Then
we sat there and stared at each other.
I couldn’t begin to guess what she was
thinking, but at the moment that was
the least of my worries.
My concern
centered around the things she had
given me to think about already.
I’d never been a particularly promis-
cuous guy; at least, not as far as I
could remember. The “not as far as I
could remember” pan was the kicker
in that sentence, of course.
I wasn’t
sure which was going to be worse: hav-
ing her realize she’d mistaken me for
someone else, or having her recogni-
tion of me as her husband actually be
correct. I didn’t remember having been
married, and it didn’t seem like the
sort of thing I’d be likely to forget, but
if you were in an inquisitorial mood
you could probably say the same thing

about my name. Even if I took the tack
that I could have been married to her
and totally forgotten it, I didn’t think
that was the answer.
She’d implied
that she’d recognized me even though
I’d changed my appearance.
I had a
feeling she hadn’t been referring to my
hairstyle, either, but to some major
total body rework that sounded like
pretty heavy magic indeed. I suppose
it was possible that whoever had hit
me with the curse had put me through
such a transformation.
As long as I
was playing the odds, though, it made
a lot more sense to go with the most
obvious explanation.
The one named
Gashanatantra.
I’d been wondering why I hadn’t
heard anything from him. There was
no clear reason he’d want to leave his
metabolic link active indeﬁnitely, since
it had to be a drain on his resources,

yet as far as I could tell it was still
perfectly intact. Now I knew. He was
still using me as a decoy. The woman
hadn’t recognized me, per se, she’d rec-
ognized the trace of Gash that was ﬂa-
voring my aura through the link. She
thought I was really him. She thought
the taste of Gash’s own aura I was still
carrying was really a little bit of his
true identity trickling through an oth-
erwise comprehensive disguise.
That
ring business he’d set me up with be-
fore had been pretty tricky, but it was
looking like I hadn’t seen anything yet.
At least the ring bit was business; this
mess seemed unmistakably personal.
What had I ever done to him?
There was another reasonable ex-
planation though, as long as I was
running through the range of possibili-
ties. She could have merely been out of
her mind. I liked this explanation even

less than the others. She had struck
me as both a powerful and a nasty
customer, and that was assuming her
activities had some rational reasoning
behind them. If she was delusional or
outright insane, well, my best bet was
to start ﬁnding out if I remembered
any good prayers. After falling in with
Max and Shaa I’d gone back and made
a few back payments to Phlinn Arol,
the Adventurer’s God, just in case, but
I had no idea if that had put me into
his favor or not, or if I’d ever even been
there in the ﬁrst place. The gods work
in mysterious ways, they say, which
I always ﬁgured was just as well. Of
course, back then I hadn’t yet gotten
in the habit of staring across my own
desk at gods who were working myste-
riously on me. “It’s been a long time,” I
said. “When we last spoke . . . ”
“I know,” she said. “I know you told

me you never wanted to see me again.
I know you hated me because of that
time with Kortese.”
She paused. I ﬁxed her with a stern
gaze. She swallowed, and said, “Do you
think I would tempt your wrath with-
out a very good reason?”
“I don’t know,” I said, “would you?
Here you are, and yet I haven’t heard
the barest hint of any kind of reason,
good or otherwise, wouldn’t you admit?
As you saw ﬁt to bring up, I suppose we
are married, or at least someone might
try to make that case, but what does
it really mean, anyway? And let us not
forget your initial greeting. I would say
that smacked more of the preemptive
ﬁrst strike than a preamble to polite
conversation, hmm?”
Her gaze was perhaps less sardonic,
less sure of itself than it had been at
the outset. “All right, then, I’ll be di-

rect. I want the ring. If I could have
taken it off your smoking body I would
have.”
“Ah,” I said. “Now we appear to be
getting somewhere.
But where, in-
deed?
There are many rings ﬂoating
about, and even a few worth blasting
one’s in-laws over. Which one do you
have in mind? And why do you think I
might have it?”
“Don’t start playing games,” she
snapped. “You know perfectly –”
“No games?” I said in an aggrieved
tone. “Just what did you expect, pray
tell? If you know me at all, my dear,
you know that convolution is my life’s
blood, so to speak.” I was riding the
odds. Shaa had told me something of
Gash’s reputation as the Mad Plotter,
the Devious, master of stratagems and
counterplots. “I’m rather disappointed
in you, you know.
I’d have thought

during your association with me some-
thing might have rubbed off. Instead,
what am I met with? A frontal assault,
if an expectedly weak one, followed by
a retreat to declarative statements?
Oh dear, oh dear.” I tsk’d at her once or
twice for good measure.
She looked at me, and in her face
I read a mixture of emotions. On the
surface was a ﬂush of rage, no doubt
aimed at me, no doubt well-earned by
my belittling remarks.
Beneath that
was her initial layer of arrogance torn
through now by the shreds of doubt.
Beneath that, though, was something
else, rising up like a leviathan from
the great depths of the ocean.
Like
the hidden leviathan, it made only the
barest ripple on the surface; unlike
the leviathan, which stays in the deep
water because it can’t breathe in the
air, she was deliberately hiding this

particular emotion, which meant, by
extension, that she was deliberately
letting the other emotions show. What
was she up to?
“As long as you’re being declarative,”
I continued, “I’ll try to play your game,
how’s that?
What did you think you
were doing when you walked in here?
Why did you bother to attack in the
ﬁrst place? You knew you’d never lay
me out with your power alone.”
“No,” she said.
“You’re right.” Sud-
denly her original nasty smirk was
back. No, more than that. Suddenly
the leviathan had emerged from the
abyss, hurling its mass clear of the
water in a thunderclap of shrapnel
spray.
“That’s why I brought this.”
She reached into the air, her hand
sliding into a spot above the center of
the desk and disappearing from sight
along a neat dividing line as though

she’d stuck her hand behind an invis-
ible wall, giving me a good angle to
view the rest of her wrist and then
her forearm in a cross-sectional, ap-
parently severed state.
The view of
chopped-off muscles and pulsing arter-
ies, and the yellow of living bone, made
me sorry Shaa wasn’t around to fully
appreciate it;
I prefer my anatomy
neatly conﬁned to outer surfaces.
I
didn’t have to watch that particular
parlor trick for long, though, since she
quickly grasped the thing she sought
in the invisible compartment and drew
it out into sight.
A mass of writhing worms was my
ﬁrst impression, gray and black and
ceaselessly squirming and making a
disgusting squelching sound; I hoped
it wouldn’t start oozing ichor all over
the desk.
Then I realized that the
worm ball might not be solid at all,

since the worms seemed to be freely
passing through each other at will,
overlapping and parting like the mul-
tiple images from a particularly rotten
barrel of fermented oat rotgut scarfed
down in the kind of long ﬂashy swig
that would probably leave you uncon-
scious at its conclusion, either from
lack of fresh air or the unmitigated
kick of the brew itself, and if it didn’t
leave you sprawled insensate on the
ﬂoor you’d wish it had.
The worms
were treating her hand with respect,
not trying to merge with her ﬂesh, only
their own, but as I noted that fact I
also realized that a sparkling ﬁlm had
appeared over her hand and arm like a
painted-on glove. The glove effect was
one I hadn’t seen before in my limited
experience with magic, and since I had
no idea how to duplicate it myself I
had a feeling that the worms might not

treat my ﬂesh with the same level of
restraint.
It did look impressive, I had to ad-
mit. However, the effect was to some
degree lost on me, since I unfortu-
nately didn’t have the slightest idea of
what the wormball actually was, other
than more trouble, but that much was
only common sense. Gash, I was sure,
would have recognized it immediately;
he was that kind of guy, and it did
sound like the sort of thing that would
be up the line of his professional spe-
cialization. He still didn’t seem to be
around, unfortunately, and he sure
wasn’t sending any helpful messages
either. “So.” I said, “you’ve got a new
toy.
Do you expect me to collapse at
your feet, to beseech you in tones of
supplication?”
She peered at me, momentarily non-
plussed. Her eyes took a quick glance

at the worm thing, almost as though
she wanted to make sure it was really
there, and active; I half expected her
to shake it to see if it would rattle.
She didn’t. Instead she ﬁxed that grin
ﬁrmly on her face and extended the
thing toward me. I felt a sudden ﬂush
of heat as though the door to an oven
had been opened in front of my face.
Unlike an oven, I didn’t feel the sen-
sation on the surface of my skin, but
down behind my eyes in the center of
my skull.
“So what are you trying to tell me
here?” I said. “You’re willing to go for
a divorce?”
“I’d rather be a widow.”
“Easier said than done.”
“No, I don’t think so.” Her hand
paused.
The wormball was close
enough to my face that I had to cross
my eyes to see it clearly, and the heat

was extreme.
So far I’d kept myself
from shrinking back in the chair, but
the next time she started moving I
ﬁgured I’d better be prepared to do
something fast. “You know,” she com-
mented, “I’m enjoying this more than
I’d expected, and I’d looked forward to
enjoying it quite a lot.”
“Don’t say I never show you a good
time,” I said.
“Just out of curiosity,
suppose you actually succeed in frying
my cerebellum with that thing.
How
do you plan to get hold of the ring you
mentioned then? The ring you say is
the main reason you’ve come after me
in the ﬁrst place.”
“I said I’d take it off your smoking
body, and I still will.”
“Ah, yes,” I responded, “you did say
that, and in so many words.
What
would you do, though, if it didn’t hap-
pen to be on my body, as indeed it does

not?”
“That’s the oldest bluff there is.”
“No doubt. It happens to be most ef-
fective, however, when it’s true.”
“True?
You’ve never said anything
true in your life. You wouldn’t recog-
nize a true statement if it -”
“You’re sure you’re ready to take the
risk? It’s a little hard to go back once
I’ve become a smoldering corpse, you
know. What would you do then if you
found you’d guessed wrong?
More to
the point, what about your associates?”
It was a calculated gamble.
True,
she hadn’t mentioned any partners.
She didn’t seem nearly as sharp as me,
though, or to be more precise, as sharp
as the being she thought I really was,
and I had a hunch she knew it, too; it
may have had a lot to do with the fact
that the two of them were distinctly on
the outs. That being the case, I didn’t

think she would have decided to go
after me - or him - on her own, ring
or no ring as inducement, and if she
wasn’t in this alone she was in it with
somebody else.
Continuing
to
be
conversational
wasn’t my last-ditch gambit, either,
by any means. My walking stick was
within reach, propped against the side
of the desk, for one, and for another I
ﬁgured I was capable of more frenzied
agility than she was used to expecting
from Gash. Physicality was always a
useful last resort, or an option to turn
to when you couldn’t think of anything
else and ﬁgured you might as well do
something. But I did have a brain, or
so I’d been told, and I ﬁgured it would
be a reasonable idea to ﬁnd out just
how good a weapon it could be on its
own terms, before I started in on my
more usual behavior of trying to throw

it at people, using its gross character-
istic of mass in an attempt to knock
them out before I lost consciousness
myself through the impact of cumula-
tive whiplash.
She had the corner of one lip be-
tween her teeth and was gnawing it
absently in thought as she watched
me.
Not moving her eyes away, she
fumbled around her neck with her free
hand, got hold of a round palm-sized
crystal disk hung from a silver chain,
raised it in front of her face, and then
squinted at me through it.
“You say
you don’t have the ring?”
“I don’t have the ring.”
As I said the words again, a regular
pattern of silver motes ran across the
surface of the disk like a school of tiny
minnows.
Her frown deepened.
Her
pursed lips narrowed to a ominous line.
Abruptly, she thrust the wormball out

straight into my face. .
My head was whipping back out of
gut reaction as she moved, but I felt
a ﬁery lash across my forehead and
heard the quick sizzle of hot grease.
She was the one who yelped, though,
as she fell backward into her chair.
Her arm was jerking uncontrollably,
the forearm twisting spastically back
and forth. The worms that had covered
the front side of the ﬂoating colony, the
side that had barely grazed my skin,
had been crisped, and they had melted
droopingly all over her palm, an evil-
looking brown smoke rising off their
twisted bodies. The rest of the worms
had broken entirely out of their ball
and were slinking their way out of the
vicinity in every direction off across
the tabletop and up along her lashing
arm.
She stared at me for a second,
this time with a clear mixture of shock

and fright, and then turned her atten-
tion to the worms, cupping her free
hand and pointing it down at them. A
ﬂattened vortex appeared beneath her
palm. The worms leapt or were sucked
off the table, some coming free with a
reluctant slurping pop, and the bunch
of them darted in a straight spinning
cloud toward the vortex like arrows off
a multiple-ﬁre crossbow heading for a
competition target.
Sparks showered
out, and then the last of the worms
were gone.
Singed tracks wound up her forearm.
I ﬁgured my forehead probably looked
the same. What I couldn’t ﬁgure was
what had happened, and why.
Obvi-
ously that wasn’t what she’d expected.
It sure wasn’t what I’d expected. What
I did while I thought, though, was
release my grip behind the desk on
Monoch, the sword disguised as a walk-

ing stick, fold my arms, and grin at her.
She didn’t grin back. “l told him this
wouldn’t work, “ she said under her
breath, “but I never expected that.”
Okay, I thought, I have the advan-
tage. I had her off-balance. It was a
perfect moment to hit her with a mop-
up blow. The major problem was that I
still didn’t know what to use for a mop.
The ring; I should concentrate on
the ring.
She wanted the ring, but I
didn’t have it. Any way you looked at
it, that was going to be a problem. I
could take one of two approaches: ei-
ther keep on trying to convince her I
really didn’t have the ring, or go for
letting her believe I did have it but
just didn’t want to turn it over to her.
Or that I had it hidden and I’d lead
her to it if she made me a good enough
offer. If I could get her to accept that
I didn’t have it, the unavoidable ques-

tion would be where it was. Under the
circumstances, I doubted she’d buy the
line that I didn’t know what she was
talking about; I could keep on trying it,
but it would be a holding action that
wouldn’t hold long at all, I could tell.
Maybe I could sort of tell her the truth,
that I’d been working with others and
I’d turned the ring over to them, but
I’d have to tell her who the others were
and then it would be their lives on the
line. Unless I didn’t identify the right
others ...
Who did I know that I was mad
enough at to want to sic this harridan
and her pals on?
Then it hit me that that wasn’t the
only way to go about this. “Very well,”
I said. “Let’s discuss this ring. Let’s
discuss, like adults, not chew up each
other’s ﬂesh like razor-tooth rabbits.
Razor-teeth are beneath us, perhaps

you’ll agree now?”
She was in some pain, it seemed; not
much, but enough to make her more re-
ceptive. I was in some pain, too, but my
edge over her was that I’d been expect-
ing it. “It’s clear you’re interested in
getting your hands on this ring,” I con-
tinued. “I think perhaps you’ll believe
me now when I tell you I don’t have it.
I did have it, though, if we’re talking
about the same ring, and I presume we
are.”
She blinked at me. She’d probably
thought I’d just kick her out the door,
or through the wall, or into the next
dimension, as long as I had the drop on
her. I was playing the role of Master
Plotter, though, or at least I thought
I was, so I was trying to live up to a
higher standard. “The plot for the ring
was mine, but not mine alone,” I said.
A small gleam of triumph appeared on

her face; she knew she’d scored one,
even if it was a point I was letting
her win. “Mine was the plot, but not
the implementation. With me in this
scheme was someone you will recall,
whose name I am sure I will not need
to mention.
Especially under the cir-
cumstances, it would be unwise were I
to do so. Things between us after we
acquired the ring did not go according
to my plan. As a result, as I said, I do
not now have the ring. Sufﬁce it to say
I was outwitted; there, are you happy?”
She was, I could tell.
She looked
real happy.
I ﬁgured the reluctant
self-incrimination and embarrassing
abasement of an admission of failure
would sit well with her, considering
her current attitude toward me, par-
ticularly since her alertness might be
slightly clouded by the pain of the
worm burns. But would she take the

bait?
In the midst of her glee, her face as-
sumed a thoughtful air. “Do you mean
who I think you mean?” she said.
I wanted to say, “If you think I mean
who you think I mean, than I think you
catch my meaning,” or words to that ef-
fect, but somehow I thought it would
spoil the tenor of the exchange we were
having. Instead I simply raised an eye-
brow, tossed her a smile and left it at
that for her to chew on.
I watched her mastications for a
moment before I decided to give the
cauldron another quick stir and toss in
an extra pinch of seasoning.
“As I’m
sure you’ll be pleased to have me ad-
mit, I felt unable to go and retrieve the
ring myself, single-handed, lest I risk
annihilation more closely than you
will remember I prefer.
I had pretty
much written the thing off, if you want

to know the truth.
As I said, brush-
ing against annihilation isn’t worth
it for a ring. Your coming here today
and pressing the issue has made me
reconsider, however.
With you, your
partners and myself united, we may
very well be able to succeed where I by
myself had preferred to back away.”
“How would we divide the ring? Why
would you want to get involved with an-
other partnership, after you’ve just ad-
mitted the last one fell apart on you?”
“I don’t know how much you really
know about this ring,” I said. “Just let
me say that its beneﬁts do not have to
be limited to one bearer.
Aside from
that, though, the issue for me is no
longer merely one of the ring itself.
There are reputations to think of, and
accounts, you will agree, to settle.”
“We’ve never worked a job before,”
she commented, “not even when we

sort of got along. Do you think it’s a
good idea to be talking about doing
that now?”
“No,” I said. “Do you?”
She gave me an actual grin, for a
change. “I don’t either,” she told me.
“Good,” I said. “Then we’re agreed.
The situation speaks for itself. I’m will-
ing to admit I haven’t been in my peak
form, primarily due to lack of motiva-
tion. If I ‘m being sloppy and you can’t
even get me to give up a ring I don’t
have, you’re never going to pry it loose
by yourselves from the one who does
have it. Let’s go talk to your partners.
They’re hanging around somewhere in
town, right?”
She gave a crisp nod and headed
for the door.
I grabbed Monoch and
followed her. I picked up the pack I ‘d
leaned next to the door earlier, when
I’d come in to look things over before

my rendezvous with Max, and closed
the door behind my back. I didn’t turn
around, even though I suspected I’d
never set foot in that room again. Like
I said before,
sentimentality about
that crummy ofﬁce was the last thing I
thought I could afford right then.
I knew I’d never carry this off over
an extended period of time.
I didn’t
know who the players were and I had
only the most rudimentary insight into
the real nature of the game.
At the
moment, though, long-range planning
didn’t occupy nearly the same priority
for me as the short-term question of
staying alive and un-crisped through
each successive minute. Maybe I’d set
something in motion and maybe not,
and even if I had let something inter-
esting loose I didn’t know if it would
wind up in a brief shoving match or an
all-out war of the gods, as grandiose as

that sounds; all I was hoping for was
enough confusion to slip myself off the
hook I’d found myself dangling from by
the collar of my coat. Whatever it was I
might have expected, I had the uneasy
suspicion that the true outcome was
going to develop into something else
entirely.
I’m not perfect, never claimed to be;
all I try to do is learn from my mis-
takes and not to make the same ones
over again.
The problem is that like
most folks, I’m creative. I’ve got a to-
tally demoralizing talent for coming up
with entirely new mistakes even worse
than the old ones.
I wondered just
which one I was sticking my foot into
this time. I’d seized the initiative, true,
or at least I thought I had, and so I was
heading out toward the next trial in a
better position than I’d hoped.
Like
I said, I’d known when she’d walked

in the door that the only way she’d be
walking out alone would be if I was
dead; she wasn’t just going to stroll
peacefully out of my life and let me go
back to whatever I’d been doing.
So
we were leaving together, but we were
doing it more as a mutual standoff
and less as her dragging me. The end
result was the same, but the game of
position between us had me with the
marginally better hand. It was a circu-
lar argument, of course. The spot my
“better hand” had put me in was off the
ladder and onto the high wire.
We headed west through Roosing
Oolvaya, on foot, away from the river
and toward the caravan grounds.
I’d
been hoping we’d pass someone I knew
so I could try to slip him a message,
but I hadn’t really believed that par-
ticular hope would pan out, and of
course it didn’t. Roosing Oolvaya went

through its normal routine of waking
up, stretching, and getting about its
business around us. Carts with fresh
produce,
pens of cackling chickens,
and once even a tank of live droop-
whiskered ﬁsh clattered past on their
way to the central market; a little late
in the morning for the ﬁsh to be arriv-
ing, perhaps, but apparently someone
thought it made sense.
As we drew
closer to the west gate that let onto the
caravan grounds, though, trafﬁc got
tighter and denser until we were virtu-
ally clawing our way upstream. At the
gate - in fact, right in the middle of the
gate - the explanation revealed itself.
Two wagons were mashed up to-
gether in a pile of loose wheels and
fragments of wood siding, one canted
onto its nose with both front wheels
gone and the axle shattered. The rest
of the trafﬁc, wheeled, mounted, and

two-footed, was forced to edge its way
around through the narrow space left
between the wreckage and the stone
arch of the gate wall. A group of people
were trying to pull the wagons apart
and drag them through the gate out
of the way. Unfortunately, they didn’t
seem to have agreed on which side of
the gate they were moving them to,
and so seemed to be largely nullifying
each other’s efforts.
As we wedged
our own way through the gate, past a
tangle of shouting men, including the
wagon drivers, a group of city guards,
and some frenzied partisans who had
probably been normal citizens just
passing through a short time before, I
noticed a big crumbly gap in the over-
head curve of the gate arch. Directly
below it, I could now see more clearly,
was the wagon with the crushed front
axle, the top of a big stone sticking up

above its sideboard.
I shouldn’t have given the situation
a second thought. You built a gate, or
a bridge or a palace, for that matter,
and there was no getting around the
fact that eventually it would start to
fall down. Then you’d ﬁx it up or just
tear it down entirely and start over;
that’s the way things went.
All you
hoped was that you didn’t happen to
be standing under it when it started to
let go.
Sometimes you got real lucky
and built something that was still de-
fying gravity, in reasonable repair and
with minimal maintenance, a thou-
sand years later, but that sure wasn’t
the way to bet.
Like I said, that much was only com-
mon wisdom. Maybe it wasn’t the case
in the old days, I mean the really old
days, but since that time civil engineer-
ing has become something of a lost an.

Not by chance, and not because people
lost interest in it, of course, but be-
cause the gods had decided we’d all be
better off it we gave up technology and
went back to a purer, grubbier world.
Or at least the gods had decided they’d
be better off.
I’d always distrusted
the gods because of their general high-
handed attitude, and their aversion
to the world’s use of technology was
the perfect case in point.
Now that
I had my own private god out for a
stroll, though, perhaps I could voice
my objections in person, and maybe
even ﬁnd out from the horse’s mouth,
so to speak, why they’d always acted
this way, aside from naturally wanting
to run the world and everybody’s ac-
tivities in it. I glanced at the woman.
Somewhat to my surprise, I found she
was eyeing me, as though she was
trying to decide whether to ask me

something on the same order of inter-
est to her as my own question was to
me. We stared down each other for a
second or two, then turned our heads
to the front and resumed plowing on
through the trafﬁc jam.
We cut off down a regular strip
of open ground kept clear as a road.
There weren’t any ofﬁcial roads in the
caravansary, of course, just a sizable
expanse of ﬂat ground mashed into
dust and fenced off for the season into
rentable plots by local entrepreneurs.
The irregular roads tended to converge
at the various wells, though, and off
ahead of us I could see the tall water-
barrel winch poles atop one of them
as we approached. Unexpectedly, the
trafﬁc, which had begun to thin a bit as
we got away from the mess at the gate,
started to coagulate once again. I won-
dered just what was going on around

the city today - a contagious case of
bad luck? We broke through the crush
of people and came face-to-face with
yet another woeful situation.
Ahead of us, two guys in travelers’
robes were standing nose to nose, wav-
ing their arms around and yelling in
each other’s face.
Behind them was
another learned-looking fellow with a
long beard; he was rubbing his chin
with one hand and casting a sage eye
over the proceedings with the air of
someone who was about to make a pro-
nouncement. An ox stood next to one
shouting man, pawing the ground ner-
vously with its right front hoof. There
was blood on the ox’s left horn. As a
son of centerpiece to the scene, a bloody
sheep lay on the ground between the
two men who were going at it.
The
sheep wasn’t moving, but if the two
men were any good at sympathetic

magic, I expected it to leap up and
break into a jig any second from the
level of emoting going on. Instead, the
man who I ﬁgured for the owner of
the sheep made a grab for the tether
dangling from the neck of the ox. The
ox, already spooked by the excitement,
danced back out of reach.
Unfortu-
nately for the ox, it had neglected to
look over its shoulder ﬁrst, and so it
backed into the low crumbling wall
around the water well itself. The wall
crumbled further under the force of
the ox’s hurled mass; the ox, its hind
legs knocked out from under it, sat
down hard on the remains of the wall;
and with a crunch and a small rum-
ble a stretch of wall centered on the
ox disintegrated entirely,
propelling
the ox, still in motion, backward into
the well.
The crowd heard one fren-
zied ox-bellow, the ox’s head and horns

disappeared from sight, and then the
crowd fell silent. The two guys froze,
their arms in mid-wave, their mouths
open in identical circles. In the midst
of the sudden silence we heard a loud
PLOP of displaced water.
That cut
things loose again.
The two original
guys were joined by a third, appar-
ently the owner of the well, and then
the crowd joined in too with a general
shouting and arm-waggling. The orig-
inal sage had been supplemented by
two others, and the three of them had
their heads together in scholarly con-
sultation, trading citations of tractate
and verse in their own rapid crossﬁre.
As we tried to edge around the com-
motion, one of the people who was
trying unsuccessfully to grab hold of
the ox’s tether or otherwise drag it out
of the well clutched at his chest with a
look of horror, pulled out an obviously

empty drawstring bag suspended by a
thong from around his neck, and be-
gan hollering, “My jewels!
This well
has swallowed my jewels!” He swung
around to join the owners of the ox, the
sheep, and the well in their grievances,
elbowing the man next to him in the
back.
The man thus elbowed, who
had been pulling hard on the dangling
tether of the ox, overbalanced and
went headﬁrst over the wall into the
well. Ox and man bellowed in unison.
I turned my head; I’d seen more than
enough.
My companion was regarding me
with a clear look of admiration. “Which
one was you?” she said. “I was watch-
ing you the whole time, but I couldn’t
even pick up a ﬂicker. It was the ox -
you caused it to back into the well, yes?
Or did you start the entire thing? Was
it the sheep?” She shook her head in

amazement. “Such a stylish example
of your philosophy, too - a small nudge
here, a small kick there, and then the
momentum of the avalanche. I hadn’t
been certain before, in the other inci-
dent with the displaced stone in that
gate, even though it seemed to have
the touch of your personality, but now
there’s no doubt about that either, is
there?”
I did my best to show her an in-
scrutable smile.
I thought I’d just
learned something valuable. Not reas-
suring, necessarily, and probably not
useful, either, but it did begin to add
some depth to my knowledge of the
person I was supposed to be imperson-
ating.
“A bit ﬂamboyant, perhaps, if
indeed it was me,” I said.
She cast me another sidelong glance.
“I think I like you more this way. Your
arrogance was always one of your most

obnoxious points. I never thought you
could change, but perhaps your time
spent slumming with these mortals
has done you some good after all.”
“Don’t take it to the bank,” I said.
Behind us now, the crowd fell silent
again for an instant, then resumed
with increased vigor. I didn’t want to
look. She led me around another cor-
ner, though, and down past a camel
corral on our left and a maze of tents
on our right. We went around the back
of a medium-sized tent and she pulled
aside the door-ﬂap, then indicated the
interior with an open hand.
“You told me I was slumming?” I
said.
Her mouth pursed as her mood re-
gressed to its earlier state, and one cor-
ner of her lip curled down in a small
snarl.
“Just go in the tent,” she told
me.

I brushed past her. A few small in-
cense burners were scattered here and
there on low tables and next to cush-
ions, and the canvas walls transmitted
additional light from the outside, so I
had no trouble seeing the ﬁgure of a
man perched comfortably on a large pil-
low at the far end of the tent, his legs
crossed, a pufﬁng hookah at his side;
no, I had no trouble at all. The trouble
was with the interpretation of what I
saw. I’d never seen her before, but I’d
sure seen him. He was the guy I knew
as Gashanatantra.

Chapter3
BUT NOT
FORGOTTEN
“WHY DOESN’T THIS SURPRISE
ME?” Max muttered.
“Rest assured,” said Shaa, “some-
thing will come of it. “
“Something?
You mean something
good?” said Jurtan Mont.
“Good, bad, the difference is primar-

ily a referential one,” Shaa told him.
“Events are Max’s basic philosophy,
stirring them up and then improvisa-
tionally molding the ﬂow. To channel a
current, one needs motion, not merely
a stagnant pool.” Shaa indicated the
rolling surface of the River Oolvaan
visible past the gunwale and the other
moored barges,
and then smoothly
pointed a ﬁnger at a passing vessel
easing downstream with the swell.
“Are you going on with that philoso-
phy bit again?” said Max. “You’ve been
trying to hook me with that line for the
last ten years.”
“If the line ﬁts,” Shaa said blandly,
“one could do worse than hang from it.”
Max snorted. His perch atop the aft
deck cabin of Haalsen Groot’s barge
let him see over the top of the usual
wharf-side clutter of crates and the ris-
ing form of the winch-driven crane, its

reconstruction lagging typically behind
schedule. Many people were visible to
his gaze but the Creeping Sword had
not yet been one of them unless he’d
strolled by in disguise, and why would
he want to do that? The Sword was sev-
eral hours overdue. Even if he didn’t
know his own name, forcing them all
to resort to that cheesy nom de plume
when they needed to refer to him, one
thing he had proven himself to be was
relatively punctual.
Although Max’s
own timeliness was often a matter of
relativity itself, he was willing to ap-
preciate it in others.
“Are you perhaps considering a visit
to his ofﬁce?” Shaa continued, after a
moment for mutual contemplation.
“I’ll go through the motions,” Max
said.
“Of course I’ll go through the
motions, but he won’t be there. I only
hope that whatever he’s gotten himself

into is going to help us out in the long
run. I just wish I knew when he was
going to pop up again; having him on
the loose makes me nervous.”
“You think we’ll see him again?”
asked Jurtan.
“Yeah, we’ll see him again, probably
right in the middle of some mess like
the last time. “
“Unless he’s dead, of course,” Jurtan
added, trying to adopt the same natu-
ral tone of full-blooded yet abstract
appreciation
for
the
world’s
twists
and turns that Shaa and Max seemed
to spin naturally around themselves
merely by breathing.
“Dead?” said Max. “What’s that sup-
posed to have to do with anything?” He
cast a glance down at Shaa. “I thought
you were supposed to be tutoring this
kid.”
Shaa shrugged. “Every day, or per-

haps every other, something of signiﬁ-
cance appears to sink in. The younger
generation is not what it used to be, if
indeed it ever was. I wish you better
luck.”
“You sure you don’t want him?” Max
said hopefully.
It didn’t bother Jurtan,
not any
more;
at least that’s what he kept
trying to tell himself.
“Do you mean
death in general isn’t something he
has to worry about, or that the Sword’s
curse means he can’t die?”
“Tricky thing is curse,” muttered the
voice of Haddo from within the cabin.
“Relevant death may be, or may not.”
“What Haddo says is quite correct,”
said Max, raising his voice so that he
could be heard in turn by the cabin’s
occupants, “but I was thinking more
about the gods.”
“Always think you about gods,” said

Haddo.
“Ulcer get will you.” A small
trapdoor in the roof intended for cabin
ventilation suddenly popped open next
to Max; a black hood and a glowing-
coal eye appeared through it. “Envious
perhaps are you, of gods their power, of
gods their knowledge?”
“You know me better than that,
Haddo,” Max said.
“I don’t envy the
gods, I hate them.
I’d love to wipe
them out, or at least bounce them back
down to mortal status.”
“Join them you would not?”
Shaa and Max exchanged unread-
able looks. “I’d die before I’d join the
gods,” Max said.
“I thought you said death wasn’t nec-
essarily relevant when you’re talking
about the gods,” said Mont. All three
heads swiveled to ﬁx him with nasty
stares.
Max and Shaa, anyway; who
knew what an expression passed for on

Haddo’s face, if he had a face, but that
red thing-that-might-be-an-eye of his
did look a bit more exasperated than
usual. Mont didn’t get it. Why were
they always dumping on him? Oh, all
right, he was being a little snotty, but it
was an honest question and a relevant
one, wasn’t it?
“Truth is truth, except when is not,”
Haddo remarked inscrutably, and then
he popped back down out of sight.
Shaa opened his mouth, perhaps to
continue the exchange.
Just at that
moment, though, a quick shudder ran
through the deck, followed by a side-
to-side rocking sensation. Max slid off
the roof of the cabin and landed neatly
on one of the stacked crates. Instead
of what might originally have been on
his mind, Shaa said, “Some large river
creature?”
“In the middle of Roosing Oolvaya

harbor?” said Max. “Fat chance. Where’s
Roni?” He and Shaa locked eyes again
for a brief instant, and then both of
them simultaneously turned to look
aft, toward Roni’s temporary lab in the
rear of the cabin whose roof Max had
been occupying. The ship keeled over
again, hard enough to make Mont take
several quick off-balance steps toward
the port gunwale before he tripped over
a knee-high length of stacked lum-
ber.
The motion was violent enough
to make even Max reach out a hand
for support.
The ship hesitated, its
deck remaining at the extreme of its
upward-canted attitude, and in the
abrupt silence they heard Roni’s voice
say, softly but clearly, “Damn.”
The
brief
quiet
ended
with
the
screaming hiss of what sounded like
a cauldron-sized tea kettle heated sud-
denly to its boiling point. Then, with

a crash of tearing lumber, the aft sec-
tion of the cabin roof blew out, sending
fragments of wood arcing through the
air.
In the center of the cloud of de-
bris was a ﬁst-sized ball of pulsing
light wrapped in a lumpy, translucent,
and fairly well shredded membrane,
the whole structure wriggling in an
organic manner. Almost as quickly as
the eye could ﬁx on this jellyﬁsh blob,
though, a sparkling meshwork column
shot up after it out of the hole, the
leading end expanded and split radi-
ally like the petals of a long-stemmed
orchid, and then with an audible clunk
the now scoop-shaped petals clamped
shut on the ﬂying blob. One ﬁnal pulse
of light leaked out through the mesh as
the petals wove ﬁrmly together. Now
like a small basket at the end of a short,
narrow tornado, or perhaps even more
accurately at the end of a thick ﬁshing

line, the encased blob danced in midair
for a short moment; then, making a
quick slurping sound, line and basket
were sucked back down through the
crater and into the cabin.
The ship ﬂopped back to its normal
attitude, sending a sheet of spray ﬂy-
ing off the starboard side of the hull
and across the adjacent dock.
Small
fragments of singed wood clattered on
the deck.
Shaa glanced at Max and
raised an eyebrow.
“Looked like a supercharged parame-
cium,” observed Max.
“Roni thought
she’d try to control the expression of
the cellular magic bodies using some
of these one-celled microbes she’s been
studying.
The process is still at a
pretty coarse level, obviously.
The
mid-level containment spells clearly
stopped it from getting out of hand
without any trouble, though.”

“Except to the ship,” Shaa mur-
mured.
“It’s a small hole,” Max said, clam-
bering back up on the roof and stand-
ing over the crater with his hands ap-
praisingly on his hips. “I might as well
add some more safeguards, though,” he
called down through the hole.
“Sounds good to me,” said Roni’s
voice, somewhat weakly, from below.
“What would have happened if that
thing had gotten away?” Mont asked
Shaa in a low voice.
“I’m not certain we’d want to ﬁnd
out,” Shaa said thoughtfully.
“I sup-
pose
the
consequences
might
have
something to do with whether the or-
ganic portion of the construct could
freely reproduce.”
Mont’s
sister
emerged
from
the
cabin, coughing.
Streaks of black soot covered her

face. Shaa produced a clean cloth and
offered it to Tildamire.
“The life of
a laboratory assistant does have its
drawbacks,” he commented.
“Wow,” she said dazedly.
“Real sci-
ence.”
“Uh, Shaa?” said Mont.
“Not right at the moment, please,”
said Shaa. “Hold your thought. Great
One,” he continued, raising his voice
to carry through into the cabin, “is the
situation under control?”
“No problem,” said Karlini,
from
somewhere in the thinning cloud of
smoke still rolling through the door
and the hole in the roof. “No injuries,
just a lot of soot and some broken
glassware and a busted beam or two.”
“Capital,” stated Shaa. “In that case,
Maximillian, would you favor us with
your presence on deck for a moment?”
“What?” said Max. “Oh, sure.” With

a somewhat distracted air, he stepped
away from the hole and toward the
edge of the cabin roof, dropped for-
ward into a roll just ahead of the verge,
grasped the end of the eave beam with
both hands when he reached a com-
pletely upside-down attitude in his
somersault, and straightened his legs
above his head to go into a full hand-
stand.
After balancing momentarily,
he pushed strongly off the beam with
his hands and sprang upward in the
air. He whipped his legs down, bending
at the waist, and then straightened his
upper body, effectively ﬂipping himself
end over end as he reached the top of
his vertical travel and setting his body
upright.
His feet cleared the edge of
the roof by a good six inches on his
way back down. Max hit the deck with
a thud and bent his knees in a deep
crouch to deal with his momentum, his

arms out wide to either side for bal-
ance and, Shaa was sure, for an extra
theatrical ﬂourish.
“Thank you,” said Shaa. “I’ll be cer-
tain to praise your capabilities when
the recruiter from the circus stops by.
Until then, though, there is an impor-
tant question to discuss. Are you quite
sure this research is safe?”
“What’s safe?” said Max, straighten-
ing up again and brushing soot from
his clothes.
“Life isn’t safe.
Riding
around in a boat isn’t safe. Magic isn’t
safe. The stuff we usually do certainly
isn’t safe. You want safe, you’d better
-”
“That’s not entirely what I meant,”
responded Shaa.
“I wasn’t referring
merely to our own personal safety,
I was thinking of any larger conse-
quences if the products of this research
get out of hand.”

“It’s got to be done,” Max said ﬁrmly.
“Without-”
“Do I detect a note of obsession in
your tone, hmm?” said Shaa. “Further-
more, you’re not answering the ques-
tion.
Our friend Maximillian doesn’t
like to be cross-examined,” he added, in
a sidelong aside to Tildy, who had been
intently watching the exchange as
though it was a tennis match, swivel-
ing her head back and forth to focus on
each speaker in turn.
“If you were anyone else,” began
Max.
“I’m not, though,” Shaa said blandly.
“Been at it for years, the two of
them, “ said the Great Karlini: he had
appeared in the cabin doorway several
volleys before. “Usually it’s just to pass
the time. With this one, though, I think
Shaa’s actually got a point, so don’t try
to change the subject, Max. I’d like to

know how dangerous you think this is,
too.”
“This accident was nothing,” Max
said. “You know spellular experimen-
tation; things are always getting loose,
getting a little out of control, but it
never amounts to anything. You round
them up and you go back to work.
Okay, every now and then you blow up
the lab, but that’s how things get done.
That’s what you call progress.”
“Roni’s a careful person,” Karlini
remarked.
“She’s not absentminded
like me, or at least that’s what people
keep saying, and no one she’s ever met
would fault her experimental method-
ology.”
“Of course she’s good,” said Max,
“she is one of the best.
That’s why
she’s the one who’s doing this work,
not some hack like Umberto Iguana, or
even Shaa or me. If anyone can do it,

Roni can.”
With his own theatrically ﬂamboy-
ant sweep of his arm, Shaa fanned at
the cloud of smoke still hanging around
the cabin.
“Yet suppose,” he said, “a
purely hypothetical case where, for
whatever reason, this developmental
effort reaches fruition and its products
go free.
I would imagine the conse-
quences could be quite severe. Hmm?”
“Yeah,” Max said, “‘all right, yeah.
They could. I think.”
“Do you mean,” Tildy asked, her
voice making a small nervous yelp,
“‘severe’ like what happened to Roos-
ing Oolvaya?”
“No,” said Shaa, “severe compared to
what happened to Roosing Oolvaya.”
“Oh,” Tildamire said, her voice now
almost inaudible.
“Okay, so it’s dangerous,” said Max.
“What other choice do we have? This

is a great opportunity. There’s no two
ways about it, we’ve got to seize the
chance.”
“Of course we have a choice,” said
Shaa. “Status quo. Don’t get apoplec-
tic, Max.
There are also other, more
tactical choices.
We can constrain
the experimental organisms so that
if they escape, they can’t reproduce,
or set them so they’ll automatically
self-destruct if they get out, or even
use mutation to ensure they can’t live
outside of the lab dish; a matter of
perhaps of breeding them to require
certain essential nutrients which only
we will provide.
The world is full of
options.”
“Good ideas,” Max stated. “I’m not
an idiot;
I know when something
makes sense.
Let’s do it.
I’m sorry
if I get a little carried away.”
“Before we all get back to work,

then,” said Shaa, “I suspect this gen-
tleman is going to want a word with
someone.” He indicated the leathery-
skinned ﬁgure of their vessel’s captain
hurrying up the gangplank, his griz-
zled head shaking in disbelief.
The
captain approached the cabin, its air
now largely clear of smoke, but marked
still by a line of sooty vapor trailing up
into the sky.
“I should have believed him,” the
captain said in amazement. “Meester
Groot warned me about your lot, he
did, and I thought it was only one of
his tall stories. There’ll be none of this
on the river, d’you hear?”
“Captain,” said Max, “why don’t you
and I have a word in private?”
Shaa inclined his head and the two
Monts followed him up the deck, out of
earshot of the now-wrangling Max and
the unsettled captain.
“Now,” Shaa

continued, turning to Jurtan, who had
watched the proceedings silently, ex-
cept for an occasional audible gulp of
nervous swallowing, “what was it you
wanted to say to me earlier?”
“Uh, ah,” Jurtan said. He was dis-
oriented; Shaa had actually acknowl-
edged he’d had something to mention.
He’d never expected that. How had he
been going to put it?
“Pull yourself together.” Shaa sug-
gested.
“Don’t be a toad,” said Tildy.
Jurtan shot her a glare which she
returned, in pure sibling fashion. “ Ah,
families,” Shaa murmured under his
breath. By all the signs, though, the
Mont siblings had no signs of having
the extreme pathology of the Shaas,
fortunately for them.
For one thing,
neither of the Monts was out of his
or her mind, and for another, their

father hadn’t gone out of his way to
direct them against each other’s throat.
Their willingness to ﬂay each other
by aiming at the most sensitive spots
was purely within the limits of normal
variability. Jurtan left off muttering at
his sister and said, “Ah, what I wanted
to know before was, well, is he safe,
Max I mean, I mean safe to be around?
I mean, is it safe to be alone in the
wilderness with this guy?
Like I’m
going to be?”
Shaa favored him with an apprais-
ing glance. “No,” he said.
Jurtan opened his mouth, glanced
at his sister, and then, with a small
quick frown, apparently changed his
mind about what he was going to say.
“Right,” he said instead. “I just wanted
to make sure.” He glanced over his
shoulder at the spot where the captain
and Max had been working things out.

The captain was still there, muttering
darkly to himself, but Max had disap-
peared.
Jurtan looked around again,
more wildly. Something stirred in the
shadows between two lashed crates,
then the something suddenly became
the form of Max, leaning insouciantly
against a net with his customarily sar-
donic grin.
“So,” announced Max, “you ready to
go, kid?”
How had Max snuck upon them like
that?
And how had he camouﬂaged
himself so well on the spur of the mo-
ment? “What - right now?”
“You have a better time in mind?”
“Uh,” said Jurtan, “I don’t . . .
how
did you do that?”
“It’s an art,” Max said.
“But a teachable one,” Shaa inserted.
“Have you ever heard of the Society of
Masks, Jurtan?”

“Are you trying to motivate him? If
he comes along, “ said Max, “I’ll teach
him stuff, but don’t go promising him
the whole store. We’ll see how he does.”
“Great,” said Jurtan, in the most def-
inite tone he could muster. “Let’s do it.”

Chapter4
THE FRYING PAN
OR THE FIRE
EVER SINCE I’D FALLEN IN WITH
MAX AND SHAA and the rest of them,
it felt like I’d been strapped to the back
of a runaway horse with my hands tied
and a scarf over my eyes, facing back-
ward; it was one change of direction
after another, and the most immedi-

ate worry was just staying on and not
getting stomped into pulp or ﬂung off
a cliff.
As I stood there in the door-
way of the tent, staring at the ﬁgure
of Gashanatantra, I had the distinct
impression that the horse and I had
ﬁnally parted company, unequivocally
and once-and-for-all.
Feeling like I’d
lost my orientation and my mind simul-
taneously was not a totally unfamiliar
sensation, though, so without really
planning it I found myself swinging
into backup mode.
I spotted another
pile of pillows on a fancy rug covering
the canvas ﬂoor not too far away, and
before I was really aware of what I was
doing I had strolled over and plopped
myself atop them.
The woman was
still standing in the doorway, watching
me with what I thought was a hint of
amazement.
“Come on in and make
yourself comfortable, why don’t you?” I

told her.
“This is not what I expected,” said
Gash, also to the woman. “I expected
you and the ring, and possibly his head
or his severed hand or some other ap-
propriate token of his demise. I did not
expect the two of you, together, with all
his pieces apparently still knitted into
a functioning whole. I take it that you
didn’t get the ring, either?”
“He doesn’t have it,” she said, enter-
ing the tent but remaining on her feet.
“How did he convince you of that?”
“He told a plausible story, and –”
“I’m sure he did.” stated Gash, “I’m
sure he did. I understand that’s his spe-
cialty.”
“Don’t take that tone with me, Zharda
she said, glaring down at him with her
hands on her hips.
“I’m not a fool, I
know quite well what he’s capable of;
and furthermore, I wouldn’t have both-

ered to listen to him if the detector
hadn’t failed to pick up the ring on his
person, too. Taunt him, yes, but listen
to him, no.”
“A detector,” he said. “I see, a detec-
tor. How sensitive is this detector, by
the way?”
“Sensitive enough.”
“I see. A detector. Full of surprises
today,
aren’t you,
my dear?” Gash
puffed thoughtfully on the hookah.
Tight little clouds rose out of the fun-
nel and drifted past the woman’s face.
If I’d had a hookah handy, I’d have
puffed thoughtfully on it, too.
She’d
called
Gash
“Zhardann,”
but
that
wasn’t the ﬁrst thing that had made
me question whether or not he actu-
ally was the Gashanatantra I knew.
For one thing,
he wasn’t acknowl-
edging any prior meetings with me,
and I hadn’t read the slightest ﬂicker

of recognition on his face.
He also
hadn’t appeared to recognize the sword
Monoch in its disguise as a walking
stick, yet he (Gash?)
had given me
the thing; and for that matter Monoch
hadn’t seemed to recognize him ei-
ther.
However, I had no doubt that
Gash could be quite thoroughly devi-
ous enough to carry out just such an
act, based on my earlier experiences
with him.
For another thing, then, I
hadn’t felt a tremor from the metabolic
link Gash had left me, the one that
plugged my life force into his own.
I wasn’t sure I would feel anything
from the link if I came face-to-face
with Gash again, but nevertheless I
thought it was an observation worth
making.
That wasn’t all. The woman didn’t
recognize him as Gash; she apparently
thought I was Gash.
Her husband,

Gash. If Zhardann was Gash, he was
running a more convoluted game than
I wanted to think about. That would
raise a cart-load of questions.
Actu-
ally, there was a good barrel-load of
questions already on the table in any
case.
The most interesting question at
the moment was still the identity of
this guy Zhardann. Was he the same
person (or god) I’d dealt with before,
and was that god (or person) actu-
ally Gashanatantra?
In any case,
Zhardann didn’t seem to be talking.
That didn’t mean that he might not
pull me aside sometime in the future
in order to drop a few words of clari-
ﬁcation in my ear, but I ﬁgured there
was no reason to spend good energy
waiting up for it.
Was Zhardann not
talking because he was the same one
I ‘d met before but was currently up

to some plot, or because he wasn’t the
same person and had never seen me
before? If he wasn’t the same person,
then were the two of them related, was
one a clone of the other, or was one
of them wearing the other’s shape for
some reason?
While I was asking for small favors
of elucidation, I was also hoping he’d
go ahead and address the woman by
name, so I could at least ﬁnd out what
I should be calling her. It might look
odd if I was put in a situation where
I had to introduce her to someone else
and I didn’t know what her name was,
considering that she thought I was her
husband.
“If he doesn’t have the ring with
him,” Gash (or Zhardann) said after a
moment, “and he claims not to be in a
position to lay hands on it, just where
does he say it is, and how does he say

he lost -”
“I’m more than willing to sit here,” I
interrupted, “lounging on your pillows,
but rather than hear all of this at sec-
ond hand you just might want to hear
it straight from me, since I do happen
to be here, and all.
Especially since
we’re going to be partners.”
His eyebrows went up.
He looked
back at the woman.
“How much
more of importance haven’t you got-
ten around to telling me yet?”
Glaring at both of us simultaneously,
which was a neat trick since Zhardann
(or Gash) and I weren’t in the same
line of sight, the woman stalked over
to him, sat down next to him on a pur-
ple pillow with long gold tassels, and
started talking to him in a low voice
while keeping her back to me. I ﬁgured
they’d get back to me soon enough, and
I was happy not to have to actually

hold up my end of a conversation right
at the moment. I wasn’t sure what had
made me speak up when I did. There
was some sense to it; if I was going
to have them treat me as a partner
I’d have to keep being assertive and
obnoxiously forceful enough for them
to continue to believe I really was one
of them. On the other hand, I ‘d made
the resolution to keep my mouth shut
and key off what they said as much as
I could until the ground rules became
a little clearer. On the other hand, if I
had some buried instinct that thought
it knew what was going on better than
the conscious me did, and it wanted
to jump in and help, I could probably
do worse than go along with it.
On
yet another hand, which clearly made
me into some species of octopod, if I
started listening to instincts of that
sort, I’d have to trust them more than

they’d given me reason to in the past.
In the past, there were times when I’d
followed my instincts to the letter, and
that had turned out to be just about
the worst thing I could have done.
The
woman
and
Zhardann
both
looked up at me simultaneously, then
bent their heads back together. What
could they do to me, anyway? Proba-
bly plenty.
My close encounter with
the woman’s wormball was without a
doubt only an introductory lesson in
what they had up their sleeves; they
could proceed to torture and dismem-
ber me, I supposed, winding up with a
nice slow eradication, and that would
be all. Except if it wasn’t - Max had
implied on a couple of occasions that
he thought that gods had their ways of
sidetracking death.
Or Death, to get
personal about it.
I decided to keep
up the ﬁght as long as I could. Some-

thing was bound to bounce my way
eventually, and hopefully it wouldn’t
be the ﬁrst round boulder in a large
avalanche.
Zhardann looked up at me again, but
this time he spoke.
“Why would you
give up, you, of all people, and after you
had the ring in your hands, too?”
“There’s giving up,” I remarked, “and
then there’s giving up.
I thought it
might be interesting to stand back and
watch somebody else run the ﬁreworks
for a change. Items like that ring do
have a tendency to come back around,
anyway, and they stir up a lot of other
interesting stuff while they’re doing it.
After all, here you are.”
They exchanged glances; apparently
I ‘d scored a point. “I see,” Zhardann
said. “Then where do you think Pasook
might be currently?”
“Heck, I don’t know,” I said. “As far

as he’s concerned, I’ve given the whole
thing up, so he might not even be both-
ering to take precautions.
We could
just start with the usual places.
I’ll
leave it up to you; after all, I was just
coming along for the ride.”
“I don’t trust him,” Zhardann told
the woman. “It was a bad decision to
bring him here.”
“Who said I trusted him?” she said,
being a bit huffy about it. “I brought
him because he might be use -”
“For what it’s worth,” I put in, “I
don’t trust you either. Now why don’t
we set all that to the side and go ahead
with what we’re going to do?”
“You’re in no position to be suggest-
ing anything,” Zhardann said.
“Re-
member that. Something still disturbs
me, something central.
Why did you
start all this and then drop it in the
middle?”

“Who said I did?”
That
was
ambiguous
enough
to
make them pause again.
It had to
be ambiguous, since I still didn’t really
know what I was talking about yet. My
luck seemed to be holding so far, any-
way.
When you keep making cryptic
remarks all the time, people can either
think you’re being deep but difﬁcult, or
a moron. At least I ‘d learned that they
thought whomever I’d been teamed
up with on the ring job was named
Pasook.
Now Zhardann squinted at
me, as though he thought a change in
refraction would improve his insight.
“Are you Abdicationist?”
What the heck was that?
I had to
give some response, though, unless
I’d rather court a quick lesson in hav-
ing my own fat deep fried. “I haven’t
entirely made up my mind, “ I said,
hoping a spot ﬁrmly on the fence rail

wouldn’t antagonize them too much
one way or the other.
“And has your
own position developed at all?”
“My position is known. The divine
right of gods is exact and immutable.”
Zhardann turned to the woman. “Do
you know where he stands?”
Now it was her turn to study me
again. “I think you may be on to some-
thing, Zhardann.
Pod Dall did hold
a checking role between the factions,
and it wasn’t until he got locked in
the ring that things really started to
break loose. That could certainly give
a political angle to his decision to go
after Dall in the ﬁrst place.
Putting
Pod Dall into play and out of action
doesn’t say anything about which side
my husband may be on, though, since
Dall did have a position in the middle.”
“Not
necessarily
true,”
Zhardann
said musingly.
“The Abdicationists

generally beneﬁt by stirring things up,
the Conservationists by maintaining
the status quo.
Putting Pod Dall ‘in
play,’ as you call it, would have the
impact of favoring Abdicationism.”
“Only at the outset,” she said, “and
he’d never ﬁgure the game to be over
after the ﬁrst round.”
“Don’t forget the matter of Pod Dall’s
own raw power,” I said brightly. “Grab-
bing his power would be nothing to
sneeze at.” Both of them swiveled their
heads to glare at me. I ﬂashed them a
cheerful smile. “Don’t mind me,” I told
them, “I’m just trying to be helpful.”
“I haven’t changed my mind,” Zhardan
said, still eyeing me but talking to her.
“We’d be a lot better off with him dead,
although I’d settle for melding him into
a ring of his own and putting him in a
jar somewhere, or better yet burying
him off in the middle of a desert. Nev-

ertheless, I am willing to yield to your
point. For the moment, I agree that we
need to keep him around.”
“You’d better watch out,” I said. “I
have a tendency to grow on people.
‘Need’ may turn to ‘want,’ and then
where would you be, all your cherished
notions of who’s who and what’s what
gone in a blaze of fraternal affection.”
The woman put out an arm to hold
Zhardann back. “I know,” she said, “he
has a mouth and he opens it far too
often, but don’t forget he has his own
power as well. He’s not all talk.”
“His power is a pitiful -”
“He stopped me,” she said, “and the
Harmala.”
At the mention of the Harmala,
which I assumed must be the ofﬁcial
name of the wormball , Zhardann’s face
acquired a troubled look.
It sounded
like warding off the Harmala was in-

deed a feat worth writing home about.
I wished I could ﬁgure out how I’d done
it, and whether it had even been my
doing at all.
“You didn’t ask how I compelled him
to come here, either,” the woman went
on. “Well, I didn’t. I got him interested,
worse luck, and he decided to come
on his own.” It was reassuring that
she was taking that view of what had
happened; the situation hadn’t seemed
quite as clear to me. This was no time
to breathe a sigh of relief, though. “If
you want to try to turn me into mulch,”
I told Zhardann, “go ahead and take
your shot. I’d just as soon get this past
us so we can settle down and cooperate
the way partners are supposed to, and
anyway I can use the practice. If not,
then let’s get down to business.”
Zhardann looked at the woman. She
shrugged. “It’s up to you if you want

to challenge him,” she said. “I’d advise
against it. I’ve already had a taste of
what he can do, and I’d say he’s been
working out seriously;
he’s in good
form. You’d probably win, but there’s
no point in wasting time and energy
over it just to put him in his place. I
know him, remember, and so I can tell
you no-one’s ever put him in his place.
You’d have to kill him to do that, and
I’d have to say that’s not seriously in
the cards. Even for you.” She ﬂashed
another one of her predatory smiles
in my direction. “Catch him when his
guard is down or his back is turned,
though, and the situation could be
entirely different.”
I smiled, too.
“That kind of situa-
tion can cut two ways,” I said.
“Any-
one who has a back can sometimes ﬁnd
they have it turned. Heh-heh.”
Her smile had turned a bit brittle.

but she was still gamely holding on to
it. “Very well, Jill,” Zhardann said. “I
will withhold the force of my righteous
indignation for the present. One is sup-
posed to listen to one’s partners’ advice,
after all.”
“That’s sometimes a good enough
reason to have partners in the ﬁrst
place,” I added. “Isn’t it, Jill-tang?”
Again it had happened - I hadn’t
known I was going to say that until
I’d already gone and slipped it through
my lips. The woman - Jill? Jill-tang?
-looked as though she was ready to
keep the banter going, but Zhardann
got there ﬁrst.
“Enough of this,” he
said.
“Let us get down to discussing
our next move. Hopefully we’ll do bet-
ter than we did with our last one.”
“How can you fail?” I said. Neither
one of them had jumped, and they
hadn’t moved to mash me either. Jill-

tang must really be her name; probably
the longer, formal form. But, like I said
earlier, I thought I’d never laid eyes on
her before.
So how did I know what
her name was supposed to be? I hoped
the reason was the metabolic link to
Gash. If it wasn’t, somebody was going
to have a lot of answering to do, and
I ﬁgured that somebody was going to
have to be me.
Zhardann gave me another one of
his dirty looks; wasn’t he going to get
tired of that at some point?
“Where
are we, Roosing Oolvaya?” he inquired.
“Oolsmouth is somewhere around here,
isn’t it?”
“Straight down the River Oolvaan, “
I said.
Zhardann looked at Jill, who looked
blankly back, at an apparent loss, for
once.
“Oolsmouth is where the head-
quarters of the Oolvaan Mutual Bank

is located,” he said thoughtfully.
“I had forgotten that,” I said, try-
ing to make my tone as insincere as
possible, so they’d be left wondering
if I really had forgotten it or really
hadn’t, but wanted them to bring it
up on their own.
“Oolvaan Mutual
doesn’t have too many ofﬁces, either,
but isn’t Oolsmouth the closest one in
any case?”
“Why did you decide to settle in Roos-
ing Oolvaya?” Zhardann asked me.
“I like the climate,” I said. “It’s out of
the way, but the news gets here sooner
or later.
You can go ﬁshing off the
wharves.
Also, I look forward to the
occasional ﬂood.”
“Are you in Roosing Oolvaya because
it’s close to Oolsmouth?”
“You’re not going to get anything
out of him by asking him a straight
question, you know that,” Jill said to

Zhardann.
Zhardann muttered something deep
in his throat. Aloud, he snapped at her,
“Stop distracting me when I’m pursu-
ing a line of thought. Whose side are
you on here, anyway?”
“Ours,” said Jill. “As you know per-
fectly well. I’m just trying to show you
ways to save time with him in the long
run.”
“Stop it, then.
If your hints are
worthwhile, I’ll ﬁnd them out for my-
self. And who implied there was going
to be a long run where’s he’s concerned?
Make sure your loyalties stay clear. Do
you understand me?”
“As long as you understand me,” she
said. “Is that clear?”
“Yes,” said Zhardann,
“very well,
yes.
Oolsmouth, then.
Deﬁnitely
Oolsmouth.” He aimed a ﬁnger at me.
“But if I ﬁnd out you’re planning to set

me up for some plot of your own, I’ll –”
“Yeah, right,” I said.
“Okay.
I get
your message.
Oolsmouth it is, then.
You want to drink a toast or something
or just hit the road? And do you want
to discuss what we’re going to do with
the ring when we ﬁnd it now, or hold
that until later, too?
Remember, I’m
the one who knows how to control it.”
I knew nothing of the sort, of course,
or at least I didn’t think I did, but
they’d presume I understood every-
thing about the ring whenever they got
around to thinking about it.
I didn’t
think their contemplation had taken
them quite that far along the thought
path just yet, though, so I ﬁgured I
might as well toss it out on the table
while it might still have some shock
value.
“I thought you’d decided you
were no longer interested in the ring,”
Jill commented.

“That was before you showed up,” I
said. “Now you’ve got me interested in
a lot of things.”
“Very well, then,” said Zhardann,
“we will have to share the ring.”
“Right,” I drawled.
“That was the
same kind of arrangement that went
sour on me last time.
How dumb do
you think I am, anyway?”
“We could set up a rotating es-
crow situation, couldn’t we?” said Jill.
“Zhardann,
shouldn’t your organiza-
tion be able to handle something of
that sort?”
“Perhaps,” Zhardann said. “Perhaps.
If we -”
“We could just auction the thing off,”
I tossed out. “For certain parties out
there, having Pod Dall in their own
pocket might be worth more to them
than it is to us, hmm?”
Jill and Zhardann looked at each

brieﬂy, again conferring without words.
I was going through this exercise not
because it would actually give me a bet-
ter chance of getting my share of the
ring, but because they’d think some-
thing was ﬁshy if I didn’t. Whatever
agreement we reached now wouldn’t
be worth a plugged ool, I knew.
If
they thought we’d dealt with the is-
sue and I’d accepted the resolution,
though, they might stop looking over
their shoulders waiting for me to pull
my double-cross. All bets were off once
we had the ring, I think we’d all agree
if we were being honest, but at least
we might get that far with reasonable
cooperation.
What I knew that they
didn’t, of course, was that the whole
thing was a wild goose chase from
the start, since I’d made up the entire
story that was sending us charging
off to Oolsmouth on the trail of this

Pasook person.
“An auction might not be all that
bad an idea at that,” said Jill. “I say
we should tentatively plan on that for
now, and revisit the question again
once we’re on the way. Agreed?”
“Yes,” I said, “ﬁne.”
It was ﬁnally time to go. I was fully
aware that our departure was another
milestone that would probably reveal
my total ignorance of everything the
well-turned-out god should take as sec-
ond nature.
I’d seemed to be doing
okay so far, though, and perhaps I
was getting a little carried away with
my luck and the feeling I was on a
roll.
In any case, I was sort of look-
ing forward to ﬁnding out what would
happen when we were all supposed to
depart however it is gods are supposed
to depart. It would be a good idea to
keep trying to test the limits of the

data and experience feed I was appar-
ently getting through the metabolic
link, so I was waiting to see just what
it was going to spring on me this time,
when it thought my back was against
the wall. I was particularly surprised,
then, and a bit deﬂated at the anticli-
max to boot, when Zhardann whistled
up a few servants, left them to pack up,
and ushered Jill and me toward the
tent’s door-ﬂap.
I was taken aback that we didn’t ﬂy,
or zap or something fancy like that,
but I guess we weren’t in that much
of a hurry, really, and the big ﬂashy
stuff soaks up so much energy that it’s
not worth using unless it’s absolutely
necessary, even if you are a god.
All
of a sudden I got a quick wave of the
shakes, no doubt from the ﬂood of good
sense that was abruptly returning, and
I decided it was just as well for another

reason. If Zhardann had said, “Come
on, let’s zap,” or words to that effect,
what if the metabolic link or whatever
didn’t kick in? What if Zhardann was
Gashanatantra. after all, and this was
just part of his cruel game to cut me off
cold from my knowledge of what to do
next? The thought of the two of them
waiting for me to help them with what-
ever it was they were doing, which of
course I wouldn’t have the slightest
idea of how to accomplish, was not too
appealing.
It could have the positive
result of having them disappear while
I remained standing around behind,
free to sneak back out the door and
off into the crowd. On the other hand,
the inﬁnite variety of negative results
seemed unfortunately much more prob-
able, and I had to admit I didn’t quite
feel like experiencing any of them at
ﬁrst hand right then and there.

At the moment, though, as I men-
tioned, all of these hypothetical cases
remained just that, hypothetical, as
we strolled out into the sun and let
the servants help the tent fold itself
up behind us.
While we’d been in-
side bickering, a group of horses had
been rounded up outside.
Zhardann
swung up onto one of them, obviously
a ﬁne specimen even though I’ve never
paid much attention to horses, and Jill
boarded another even snazzier-looking
chestnut and white model.
“I am as-
suming you didn’t think to bring your
own transportation?” Zhardann said to
me in his same sour voice.
“One of these will do just ﬁne, thank
you,” I told him.
He muttered some-
thing else under his breath, probably
“This is going to be a long trip” or its
unprintable equivalent. I was just as
pleased not to have heard his remark;

I didn’t know how much abuse my mild
temperament was going to be able to
stand. As far as I was concerned, how-
ever long the trip was going to be for
them was nothing compared to what
it was going to be for me. Aside from
the recurring goal of just staying alive,
though, I thought I also stood to gain
a lot more from this than they did. Af-
ter all, they knew their own identities,
or at least I presumed they did.
If I
stayed sharp, sharp and lucky that is,
and kept my ears open, I thought I
might be able to go a signiﬁcant dis-
tance on the way to ﬁguring out my
own.

Chapter5
ICE CUBES
THE AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE
OF
THE
RIVER
OOLVAAN was
frankly more humid than Zalzyn Shaa
found acceptable. He was standing on
the deck of Haalsen Groot’s river-ship,
the Not Unreasonable Proﬁt,
arms
crossed and leaning on the starboard
gunwale, watching stands of cotton-
woods pass by on the west bank of the

river. They had been out on the river
now for three days, having left Max
and Jurtan Mont to their overland
route westward, and without any of
them having uncovered the slightest
clue to the detective’s disappearance.
The departure had been a bit tiring
with its ﬂurry of activity, but since
then it had been an uneventful three
days. So far, Shaa reminded himself.
On the rises behind the bank were
small areas of unpruned forest inter-
spersed with cultivated ﬁelds.
The
sun was out, declining toward after-
noon, and the behavior of the river
was placid; all in all, it was a perfectly
respectable day.
Nevertheless, Shaa
was not pleased. He was, in fact, in a
grouchy mood, and resented the day
for not giving him a convenient target
against which to vent his spleen. “Ex-
cuse me?” said a voice from behind him.

It was Tildamire. “I brought you some
iced tea.”
Shaa lowered his gaze to the greenish
brown water lapping the shore. “And
what exactly were the source ingredi-
ents for this concoction?” he inquired.
“The usual - tea, I suppose, and wa-
ter, and that freezer-spell thingy,” Tildy
said.
“Water?” Shaa said.
He
was
ostentatiously
watching
something between the boat and the
shore - oh, she got it.
“Not from the
river, at least I don’t think so, and
anyway it’s been through Max’s still.”
She moved around to stand beside
Shaa and leaned her own elbow on the
gunwale, eyeing him from what might
have been a safe distance.
“Here.”
She planted the mug between them
on the gunwale; protruding from its
wide mouth were a sprig of mint and

another leaf from Shaa’s stash of his
self-prescribed herbal glycoside.
“Thank you,” said Shaa, making an
effort to hold himself in check.
She
was only trying to be pleasant, after
all, and there was a substantial mar-
gin between grouchy and barbaric. “I
don’t think I’ll have any right at the
moment, though.”
“Suit yourself,” Tildy told him. She
looked out across the water, spotting
two muskrats cavorting near the shore.
“It’s pretty nice out here.”
“I suppose,” Shaa said morosely.
“What’s the matter?”
“I dislike feeling useless. “
“Why should you feel that way?” said
Tildy.
“You redesigned Roni’s experi-
ment, didn’t you, to make it harder for
her animalcules to escape? And aren’t
you doing your own experiment with
their nutrients? How’s that going?”

Shaa looked at her, canting his head
as he brought it around so that the
gaze emerged sidelong from beneath
a sarcastically inclined eyebrow.
“Pa-
tience is required,” he responded, “as in
most experimentation. As opposed to
tinkering, or outright invention. Nev-
ertheless, investigation into obligatory
nutrients is clearly a sideshow to the
main event.
Watching someone else
do the interesting work you’d just as
soon do yourself is not my idea of a
spectator sport with growth potential.”
“But what you’ve done yourself is –”
“There’s no need to coddle me,” Shaa
said. “If I want to be patronized, I’m
perfectly competent to let you know.”
Tildy frowned. “I’m just telling you
what I think. Why should you be mop-
ing around? Because your curse keeps
you from doing hands-on spell work?
Because there’s not more trouble to get

into on the boat? Why not just think of
this as a vacation, then? I mean, this
is a trip, isn’t it? A cruise down a river
- people pay good money for this sort of
thing.”
Shaa turned his gaze back toward
the water. For some reason that was
not immediately apparent, an ice ﬂow
about the size of a bathtub had ap-
peared off the bow;
the boat was
traveling downstream with the cur-
rent but slightly faster than it, due
to the effect of the sail amidships,
and so the ice ﬂow was drifting and
revolving leisurely toward the stern.
Surprisingly for the presence of ice,
though, the water temperature was,
if not downright tepid, at least well
above freezing, and the nearest snow
or glacier was hundreds of miles up-
stream and a few months removed in
time. It wasn’t even winter. “There is

this unfortunate element of coercion
involved,” Shaa said abstractedly, most
of his attention now concentrated on
the matter of the miniature iceberg.
“Having to take a vacation takes most
of the fun out of it. A vacation is usu-
ally an internal reward for a job well
done, or at least done; or even more
enjoyably one takes a vacation because
one just up and feels like it. Vacation
under duress, enforced idleness, is a
thoroughly tedious prospect.”
“What about burnout, though? You’ve
been
a
professional
magic
person,
right? What do you do when you need
a major recharge?”
“Sink gracefully into a light coma
for a week or two,” Shaa said.
Tildy
thought his tone sounded a bit arch.
Of course, this was Shaa, and his tone
usually sounded a bit something-or-
other.

“If you need to be busy, I’m sure
there are any number of things you
could catch up on; reading, say?
I
mean, we are here on a boat on a river
- you could do worse than just sit out
on deck and work on your tan.”
“Accelerated dermatological aging,”
grumbled Shaa.
“Skin cancer.” Yet
here he was, unquestionably sitting
(or lounging) on a deck, and the sun
was indeed high overhead. He pulled
the brim of his hat lower over his eye-
brows.
“You don’t have to sit around
out here with me, you know,” he said
pointedly.
“I realize my company at
the moment leaves something to be
desired. If asked, I’ll certify that your
nursemaid obligation was thoroughly
and responsibly discharged.”
“You don’t have to be a crab when
someone’s just trying to be pleasant,”
Tildy mumbled.

Shaa wished he had a pincer on his
person, or an appropriately exoskele-
tal piece of apparatus, so that he could
produce it from beneath his shirt for
ironic effect. He was not, however, pre-
pared for every conceivable eventuality.
He did try to be, though, and realizing
that an unusual opportunity with a
cooperating straight-man, or girl, was
slipping past made him even testier.
“You don’t have to provide me with
an audience,” he said, supplementing
the remark by waving his hand at her
and clacking his ﬁngers and thumb
together in pincer-pantomime, while
making a synchronized clicking sound
with his teeth. It was at best a poor
alternative to the display of an actual
visual aid, but then since Shaa was
feeling like a poor excuse for a person
of action he supposed it was reasonably
ﬁtting. The momentary look of incom-

prehension of Tildy’s face was replaced
by one of mild horror mixed with re-
proof. She said, “Ah, right,” edged back
away from the rail, and then turned
and ﬂed into the laboratory cabin.
Shaa watched as the ice ﬂoe slipped
beyond the stern.
He was not neces-
sarily a person of action at most times
in any case, but he did go through
phases. The one he was in at the mo-
ment was certainly frustrating. Shaa
wanted nothing better than to be up
and around, pursuing leads, stirring
things up, and generally getting into
trouble, but his health had betrayed
him. More to the point, his curse had
betrayed his heart, which had in turn
passed the betrayal on to the rest of
his system. This time, no sooner had
he gotten involved in enough shenani-
gans to get his senses keyed up than
he was undercut by his body. Now look

at me, he thought, reduced to banter
with an underage keeper on a placid
river in the middle of civilized territory.
It was enough to make a grown man ...
whine.
He was the ﬁrst to admit that his
funk had nothing to do with good sense.
He wasn’t ready to out-and-out die, af-
ter all. If that was his goal, he could
just jump ship and strike out alone
looking for someone else’s business in
which to embed himself.
He wasn’t
willing to be quietly content with his
present fate, either, though, so he had
decided to adhere to the middle ground
of being tolerably miserable for any-
one else to be around until he got too
bored with that and shifted to being
impossibly noble for awhile, or until
something worth getting excited about
ﬁnally showed up.
Not that there was much excitement

to look for from the River Oolvaan.
Shaa ticked off the possibilities in his
mind.
The river did ﬂood, true, but
unfortunately it was now the wrong
season, although there might be hope
for a lightning storm or two before
they reached Oolsmouth.
There was
undoubtedly a war on somewhere, the
world being what it was, but these
days the Oolvaan basin was devoted
to peaceful trade, and he’d never been
fond of random carnage anyway.
As
far as Shaa knew, the river pirates had
all retired. Most of the shoreline they
were passing was cultivated or lightly
wooded; no interesting creatures would
be found within a hundred miles, and
the local nonhumans were as domesti-
cated as the people. Well, perhaps his
brother would show up.
Another
chunk
of
ice
appeared,
caught up momentarily in the bow

wave. Shaa’s brow furrowed. He left
the rail and walked aft, tracing his
way amidst the tangle of lashed-down
crates and awkwardly-shaped trade
goods, casting an eye as he did over
the river on the port side.
No addi-
tional ice fragments were - no, wait,
there was one, after all, draped with
a clump of river weed.
Reaching the
stern cabin, Shaa leaned through the
door. “Great One?” he said. “A moment
of your time.”
“What you got?” Karlini called back.
“Manifestations. Things are aﬂoat.”
Karlini emerged, blinking his eyes,
then squinted as he followed the line
of Shaa’s pointing ﬁnger. “Ice?” Karlini
said. “That’s odd.”
“Indeed.
Shall we check the ice
maker?”
“A resonance effect, you think? Well,
maybe.
Might as well start there as

anywhere, I guess.” The two of them
went forward.
The few sailors scur-
rying about on seamanlike tasks paid
them no heed;
they’d been advised
before the ship left Oolsmouth that
they’d be safer all around to let Karlini
and his crew putter as they chose, and
besides they were getting hazard pay
for the voyage.
“The most obvious method of obser-
vation, “ Shaa said, proceeding down
the short ﬂight of ladder steps into the
gloomy companionway beneath the for-
ward deck, rather than up the adjoin-
ing stairs onto the forward deck itself,
“would be to stand at the bow, trying to
watch for the appearance of the ice; not
how the ice looks, mind you, but where
it seems to be coming from.”
“Resonance can be tricky,” Karlini re-
minded him. “You get a lot of these ef-
fects at a distance, where the additive

wave crests are strongest.
If the ice
maker is buggy, it could easily be gen-
erating freezing spots in the river ﬁfty
feet away, so just trying to see where
the ice is coming from might not give
us that much new information.”
“Indeed,” said Shaa.
“I can’t say
I’ve ever entirely trusted the freezer.”
On his right was the small galley. First
taking a glance through the door to ver-
ify that no one was heading outward
in his direction bearing a sizzling caul-
dron or a snack of pickles, Shaa eased
himself through the narrow space be-
tween a heap of pots and the sacks
of ﬂour, secure against mold in their
freshness-spelled wrappings.
The ice machine was perched on a
cask of salt cod racked against the tim-
bers of the hull, and was lashed for
good measure to the wood. A pipe led
upward through the ceiling to the wa-

ter tank on the deck. Just beneath the
ceiling, suspended from the joists by
hooks, the pipe entered Max’s puriﬁca-
tion ﬁlter. Shaa turned the stop valve
on the pipe, let the water in the ﬁlter
gurgle downward, opened the catch on
the ﬁlter box, and carefully withdrew
the differentiation sieve, a rectangular
chunk of sponge mounted in a wooden
edge-frame.
The faint nebulous glow
in the spell-guide tube leading from
the ﬁlter box down to the ice maker
dimmed and went out.
Shaa passed
the sieve to Karlini, and they both
peered at it.
“Now that I take a good look,” Kar-
lini commented, “this ﬁlter is pretty
low-powered, isn’t it? The biggest res-
onant effect you’d expect out of some-
thing with this small a level of juice
would be an icicle on an adjacent wall.”
“Under most circumstances I’d surely

agree with you,” said Shaa, poking at
the spongy matrix with a ﬁnger; the
temperature at its surface dropped
abruptly to a skin-numbing chill. “Re-
member who designed it, though.”
“I haven’t forgotten, but you also
have to keep in mind that for a change
this isn’t one of Max’s mechanomagical
hybrids,” Karlini pointed out. “No mov-
ing parts anywhere, just diffusion and
transfer processes.”
“What do you think he might have
woven into the matrix?
And does it
use standard ﬁrst-order techniques or
more of those new second-quantum-
level effects?”
Karlini passed a palm over the
sieve’s surface.
“Feels ﬁrst-level to
me. Max is trying to keep the second-
level stuff under wraps, anyway.
I
don’t think he’d risk blowing his big
new breakthrough over something as

mundane as an ice machine.”
“Trust me,” Shaa said. “When Max
gets to tinkering on a project he’s liable
to end up using any technique he can
lay his hands on. He’s also assiduously
solicitous about his creature comforts.”
“But we’re the ones with the ice
maker,
not him,” Karlini reminded
him.
“He thought he was doing us a favor.”
“He was doing us a favor. How else
do you think we’d be getting civilized
refreshments? We don’t have space for
an ice locker with all Groot’s stuff on
board. I like having ice.”
“So do I,” Shaa admitted. Something
thudded against the outside of the hull,
sending a shiver through the deck, and
then rasped along the side of the ship
just at their position and halfway up
the wall, a bit below where the water-
line was probably located.
The grat-

ing lasted a few seconds, then stopped
abruptly. Shaa looked at the disassem-
bled ice maker, then at Karlini. “You
know,” he said, “I think this device is
working just ﬁne. What do you say we
shift the focus of our investigation? It
sounded like that one was larger than
the ones I saw before, and it was obvi-
ously closer as well.”
Before Shaa could ﬁnish, Karlini
had already shoved the pieces of the
ice maker back together and was head-
ing through the door.
Shaa followed
him down the companionway and up
the stairs to the foredeck. The captain
was already there,
accompanied by
Haddo and Wroclaw, who had appar-
ently been polishing the brass-work,
judging by the pile of cloths at his feet,
the vile-looking bucket of oily polish,
and the half-shiny stanchion at his
side. They were all gazing off the bow

at the ice chunks.
The pieces of ice
were deﬁnitely more numerous, and
they were also without question get-
ting larger - in fact, Shaa noted, it was
not nearly as much of an exaggeration
now to think of them as small icebergs.
Haddo turned as they approached, an
accusatory expression apparent in the
inclination of his hood. “Not liking am,”
Haddo said, “this.”
“Captain Luff,” Shaa said, “I take it
this is not a typical phenomenon for
this section of the river?”
“Never seen anything like it,” admit-
ted the captain. “Kind of nice to look
at, though, wouldn’t you say? Except
for the fact we’re on a ship, don’t you
know, and the blamed things look like
they’re aiming for us.”
“Do you intend to engage in evasive
action?”
“I’ve been considering just that very

point, Mr.
Shaa,” the captain said,
stroking his short silvery beard. “Per-
haps your own opinion, or Mr.
Kar-
lini’s, there, would be helpful to the
situation.
I’ve sailed the seas and
rivers, as boy and man, don’t you know,
and the only times I’ve seen the like
of this business there’s always been
some deviltry afoot.
You two gentle-
men, you’ll excuse me for mentioning,
seem to be the ranking authorities on
deviltry in these parts.”
“We thought it might be the ice
maker,” Karlini said, “but it wasn’t,
or at least we don’t think it was. We
don’t know what it is, but I suspect
it’s not just going to go away, and by
the look of things those ice things are
getting bigger, I think we can all admit
that. I agree with Shaa; I’d recommend
getting ready to evade them. They’re
solid, sure enough, not some illusion.”

“Frankly, Captain,” Shaa added, “I’d
advise sailing your ship as you choose
and not bothering to ask us for advice
on it, or anyway not in the middle of a
piloting emergency.”
“As indeed I have been doing,” said
the captain.
What remained unspo-
ken but understood was the captain’s
desire to avoid stepping on any toes
that might lash out and bite him, Shaa
thought, wincing a little as he man-
gled his own metaphor out of all sem-
blance to civilized discourse. Captain
Luff seemed to have reason to know
that practicing magicians tend to be
a dangerously prickly and unstable
lot, although what he thought of Kar-
lini in particular, and even Shaa, with
their more than typically free-wheeling
attitude toward matters of serious im-
port, remained untested.
“Just you
gentlemen pipe on up when you have

something to contribute,” the captain
continued.
It was apparent that the captain
was as good as his word when two
crewmen appeared from the stern, bal-
ancing long docking gaffs, and took
up positions on either side of the bow.
With a shouted “One point to port!”
a lookout on the mast made his pres-
ence known as well.
The helmsman
on the poop deck called an “Aye!” in
response and the ship angled slightly
to port, putting the latest ice ﬂoe on
their starboard bow.
The starboard
gaffman caught it with his pole and
leaned hard, the muscles in his back
and arms standing out beneath his
brief shirt, and the ice ﬂoe spun slowly
around its center of mass and bore
off. The captain, watching closely, said
in a low voice to Shaa, “Those hunks
get much larger and these gaffs won’t

make any difference at all; they’ll just
go snap.”
The truth of the captain’s words was
evident. The icebergs were forming be-
neath the surface of the water and then
bobbing to the top with a splash and
a heave; this allowed an estimation of
the mass of each new chunk to be made.
Larger they were clearly continuing to
become. With the ship’s sail deployed
to take advantage of the breeze at their
back, and the force of the river’s own
ﬂow added, the vessel had been mak-
ing excellent time. “I know you folks
want to make this a quick trip,” the
captain announced, “and it’s a point of
pride of my own to run the fastest tran-
sit on this part of the Oolvaan, but I
don’t mind telling you I’d be happier if
we heaved to for a bit. With us heading
downstream faster than the current,
you see, the current is what’s carrying

yon ice drifting past us.”
Slowing down, in land-side parlance,
or even stopping would thus keep the
ice ahead of them. Should keep the ice
ahead of them. “If some one is behind
this ice visitation,” Shaa commented,
“slowing us down may be what they
had in mind. Still, captain, you are the
captain, and happy we are to have you.
Proceed as you choose.”
With an alacrity that underlined
the captain’s relief, he ordered the sail
taken in. “Now,” Shaa murmured, “we
may see what is really going on. “
“You think -” said Karlini.
“Don’t you?” said Shaa.
Haddo had again turned and was
scrutinizing them both.
“Any idea
have you each,” he said, “what about is
talking the other one?”
“You are certainly one to comment,”
Shaa told him. “Yet, somehow, commu-

nication still seems to occur. Hmm?”
Haddo, apparently having no appro-
priate response to that, swung back
around in a huff.
He renewed his
scrutiny of the water ahead. “What see
I, see you?”
“Our phenomenon does appear to be
evolving,” Shaa agreed. The chunks of
ice had been rising to the surface two
ship’s-lengths or so in front of them
from a spot that continued to move
ahead of them, keeping roughly the
same separation between it and the
bow.
As the ship had begun to slow,
though, the place where the ice was
appearing had starting drawing in-
escapably closer. Their speed was now
perhaps two-thirds what it had been.
The distance to the ice generation zone
had shrunk by the same proportion,
and was continuing to shrink at the
same rate. “Captain, I trust you have

been observing the same behavior as
have I?”
“Aye, “ the captain said, squinting
ahead in concentration.
Shaa glanced at Karlini.
He was
mumbling
something
beneath
his
breath and waving his hands around
in tight patterns, the tips of his ﬁngers
glinting with a metallic sheen in the
sunlight; perhaps it would be best not
to bother him. “I believe it is a math-
ematically and geometrically sound
proposition.” Shaa said to no one in
particular, “considering the rates and
angles involved, that when this ship
reaches stationary rest and lies-to at
anchor, these ice fragments will be try-
ing to rise to the surface from a spot
beneath the keel, and approximately
at the midpoint of the ship. “
“Oh, dear me,” said Wroclaw, who
had been watching the proceedings

with silent alarm.
“Indeed, yes,” Shaa conﬁrmed. “Not
being a master mariner myself and
having a fully qualiﬁed one close at
hand, I hesitate to hazard an exact
prediction of the outcome of such a
situation, but I venture that it could
represent signiﬁcant morbidity, if not
mortality, for a vessel of this type.”
“Raise sail!” the captain ordered. A
brief chorus of “Raise sail!” echoed
down the deck,
followed by a few
shouts of “Raise sail, aye!”, and with an
almost equally brief ﬂurry of activity
from the crew the single square-rigged
mainsail was once more hoisted into
place.
The ship immediately leapt
ahead again, its bow wake increasing.
The place of appearance of the ice hove
to in the same spot relative to the bow,
stopping its inexorable advance on the
ship. It did not, however, retreat back

to its previous location as the ship got
back up to its previous speed.
The behavior of the ice generation
zone certainly cast doubt on Shaa’s pre-
vious speculation that its goal might be
to have them stop in place. “Perhaps
someone with an interesting sense of
humor is toying with us,” Shaa said.
Karlini now had his hands on his hips
and appeared to be examining some-
thing in the air that only he could see.
“Do you have any pertinent insights to
share, Great One?”
“No one seems to be running this,”
Karlini said, raising a ﬁnger to tweak
a slightly curdled section of the air in
front of his face.
“I’ve been running
some tests, trying to ﬁgure out what
mechanism’s operating here, and ex-
actly how whatever-it-is is keyed to
the ship.
Like I said, there doesn’t
seem to be anybody out there, at least

at the moment.”
“Not unusual,” Shaa remarked.
“Right, of course; a preprogrammed
trap
or
other
physical-effect
spell
doesn’t necessarily need an active op-
erator after it’s been set into place.”
“You think this ice-business is new,
not an old spell-mine left ﬂoating in the
Oolvaan from some war, or something
of that sort?”
“What, “ said Karlini, “you’re sug-
gesting to me that all we’ve done is
blunder into somebody’s else’s old busi-
ness?
You’re the one who sees plots
under every bed.”
“That would be Maximillian,
not
me,” Shaa said. “I am content to take
the world at its word. Just let us not
forget the value of an occasional reality
check.
Perhaps a pirate engagement
took place here recently, perhaps some
river creature has picked up a new

skill, perhaps an arctic nereid was on
the way south and we’ve crossed her
trail. Perhaps it’s one of those sponta-
neous manifestations one occasionally
hears about, as something that some-
one somebody once knew had happen
to their uncle. “
“Pirates?” said Wroclaw, his minty-
colored skin going a shade further to-
ward wintergreen. “Creatures?”
“No,” Shaa said, after a brief mo-
ment of contemplation, “probably not
pirates.”
“ ‘Tain’t been pirates on the lower
Oolvaan since I was a cabin boy,” com-
mented the captain.
“Starboard two
points, there, now!”
The ice generation zone might have
remained at the same distance off their
bow, but the size of the icebergs had
not stopped growing.
The latest one
was fully the size of a small boat it-

self, and not just a rowboat, either. If
no unexpected eddies appeared in the
current, and if their maneuver to star-
board was executed smartly, it would
miss them ... and there it went, churn-
ing past off the port quarter, close
enough though to feel the frosty wave
of condensation off its supercooled sur-
face.
They all turned again toward
the front; the hunks of ice had been
appearing at fairly regular intervals,
about a minute apart, Shaa estimated.
The next one would be due right about
now.
Or now.
Now?
Shaa glanced at Karlini. He didn’t
like the new look on Karlini’s face -
a furrowed forehead and pursed lips.
“Great One, what gives?”
“The traces I was monitoring just
quit.”

“Do you think the spell burned out?
Is it exhausted?”
“Maybe,” Karlini said dubiously. “I
don’t know. Even if it did, I’m kind of
worried it might have had some signif-
icant last gasp planned on its way out.
“
“There,”
announced
the
captain,
pointing dead ahead.
“What?” said Karlini. “Oh!” A hun-
dred feet ahead of them, a dimple had
appeared in the surface of the water,
as though a smooth transparent ball
a double-arm’s span in diameter had
been pressed into it.
A river swell
spilled into the hole, swept around its
concave side. Rather than passing out
of the hole and sweeping on across
the river, though, the mound of water
that had sloshed in tracked around
the inside surface of the pit and then
kept rotating, like the blade of a slowly

spinning drill bit. With a gurgle and
a swoosh that were dearly audible to
the watchers in the ship, the edges of
the hole spread out and the water on
the walls inside began to revolve in
earnest as though a plug was being
pulled out of a drain hole in the bottom
of the riverbed.
“Have you ever -” said Shaa.
“No,” stated the captain. “All hands
on deck!
Prepare for - what?” This
last word was directed at Shaa, with a
raised eyebrow and a lowered voice.
Shaa shrugged. “The unknown.”
“Aye,” muttered the captain.
Then,
shouting again, “Prepare for the un-
known!”
People spilled onto the deck. Shaa
was only peripherally aware of them.
Ahead, the open whirlpool cone had
abruptly started to ﬁll from the bottom,
to ﬁll explosively, to ﬁll and overﬂow. A

mound of water, no, a hill, built above
what had just been a hole, a surging
mass of green and brown river water,
green and brown except for the streaks
of white inside it.
Streaks?
No, not
streaks, but part of a single rushing
shape, and the water was light green,
not dark, and not just a mound but a
frothing, tumbling -
The top of the water erupted. Spray
ﬂew to all sides, showering the boat a
hundred feet away. Out of the mass of
hurtled water burst the largest iceberg
yet, not merely larger but large in any
human-sized sense of the word, in fact
fully twice as wide as the beam of the
Not Unreasonable Proﬁt itself. Directly
toward which, of course, as it fell back
onto the water, sending loose another
titanic sheet of spray, the iceberg began
to drift.
“Hard a-port!” yelled the captain.

There was marginally more iceberg
on their starboard side than there
was to port, but it was still clearly a
doomed gesture. There was obviously
no chance of getting out of the way.
“Somehow,” said Shaa thoughtfully,
“I believe I expected this.” He braced
himself for the impact, and the in-
evitable dive into the water.
Next to
him, though, there was an electric
whine. Shaa started to turn his head
toward Karlini.
Something clear and shiny rippled
past the comer of his eye, warping the
scene behind it like an arm-thick foun-
tain of pure water or a twisting crystal
bar; it darted toward the iceberg, leav-
ing a twinkling trail of distortion in its
wake. The thing hit the iceberg a bit
left of center and immediately slid like
oil out across its surface. The note of
the whine deepened; crunching, crack-

ing, and grinding appeared on top of
it; and the entire iceberg began to ﬁb-
rillate. Fissures appeared. A cloud of
snow lifted from its surface, and then
the entire iceberg disappeared beneath
the sudden compact blizzard with a
powerful crack. Shaa dove for the deck
and covered his head with his arms.
Hail pelted down.
The ship rocked,
heaved, lurched, and the heavier frag-
ments began to thud down around
them on the deck. Shaa felt a smash to
his shoulder and a near-miss sprayed
splinters across his arms. Shaa gave it
another few seconds, heard the patter
begin to trickle off, and levered himself
to his feet.
Ahead, waves lashed back and forth
across the area where the giant iceberg
had been; the ship itself had almost
reached the spot. With an additional
heave and a perceptible twist-and-slide

to starboard, the ship bounced its way
through the turbulent zone, bashing
past the larger ﬂoating fragments that
were the major remains of ﬂoating ice.
The deck around Shaa was dented and
bashed and a coating of broken ice
twinkled over the entire bow of the
ship. The others around him were re-
gaining their feet as well. Next to Shaa
on his right, the captain winced at him
through gritted teeth as he moved one
elbow gingerly around. Shaa eyed Kar-
lini.
“Looks like you were expecting
this, too,” Shaa told him. “That’s not
something you usually keep whipped
up, is it?”
“All things considered,” said Karlini,
shaking his head vigorously, sending
a sheet of icicles ﬂying off his hair, “it
looked like it might come in handy.
I thought a melter would take too
long.,so ...” He shrugged.

“I
agree
with
your
assessment,”
Shaa said thoughtfully.
“Just think
of the energy transfer you’d need to
push out to ﬂash-liquefy that much ice.
Why, it would be . . . ” Shaa paused to
calculate.
Wroclaw
had
produced
another
bucket, this one unsoiled by any nox-
ious cleaning ﬂuids, and - ever thrifty
- was using it to gather up chunks of
ice for the kitchen.
The captain had
moved to deal with the crew as they
checked for damage and made things
generally shipshape once again. Kar-
lini, gazing off the bow and sunk deep
in his calculations, apparently failed
to notice the approach of Roni and
Tildamire approach, even though the
ice through which they had to crunch
rested as much as several inches thick
on the deck.
Roni directed a fondly
rueful glance at Karlini.
In the best

of times, her husband didn’t usually
notice much that was going on around
him without having his attention delib-
erately directed on it.
Shaa bent to pick up a chunk of
ice.
“Neat, Karlini, very neat.
See -
the cleavage surfaces are smooth, not
powdered. “
“Are they really?” Karlini said.
“What have you boys been up to?”
said Roni.
“So after all this, what do you think?”
Karlini asked.
“Difﬁcult to say,” said Shaa, turning
the ice cube over in his hand, pausing
to examine one surface more closely. “A
good question indeed.”
“Either someone’s been trying a new
recipe,” Roni said, with a sharp glance
at Wroclaw, who shook his head em-
phatically, pointing with several jabs
of his ﬁnger at Karlini, “or someone’s

got some explaining to do.”
“Free will,” stated Shaa.
“Random
chance.”
“Or deliberate action,” said Karlini,
gazing intently at the sky.
“Should we pay attention to them, do
you think?” Shaa said to Karlini, sotto
voce. “Or shall we prepare to get hit
over the head with something nasty?”
Karlini looked wildly around.
If
Shaa had observed the approach of the
women and had decided to show no
sign of it, Roni’s husband had clearly
and in actually noticed not a thing.
Karlini was predictable, but so was
Shaa, when you got right down to
it; Roni had been quite careful about
which one of them all she’d picked to
marry.
She looked at her husband,
nodded her head in mild but familiar
exasperation, then grabbed his shoul-
ders with both hands and shook.

“Dear!” said Karlini.
“Are you all
right?”
“Yes,” Roni told him. “No thanks to
you. Or is it?”
“As a matter of fact -”
“What are you guys talking about?”
said Tildy.
“An attack,” Shaa said, “potentially.”
Tildy’s mouth fell slightly open, then
closed with a thoughtful pursing. “You
really think . . . ?”
“I often try to,” Shaa said; his difﬁ-
cult mood had not entirely evaporated
with the iceberg’s own vaporization.
“I mean, you really think somebody
would try to attack us with a hunk of
ice?”
“It’s a signiﬁcant possibility,” said
Shaa. He gave up studying his ice cube
and popped it in his mouth.
“But who?”
“Or whom, one might say if one was

being resolutely grammatical.
That,”
Shaa said, slurping the ice cube, “is
usually the most interesting, not to
mention salient, question.”
“Could it have been someone after
the ring?”
“There are any number of things
someone could have been after, start-
ing with a little fun and building up
from there, but I would say the ring
should certainly be on that list.
Of
course, it’s most likely that the whole
thing was nothing more than happen-
stance. “
“Is that what you believe?” Tildy
said skeptically.
“What I believe would probably have
no inﬂuence on the facts of the matter,”
stated Shaa.
“Paranoia is a survival
trait, however.
This ice is rather re-
freshing, by the way.”
“So you do think -”

Shaa opened his eyes wide and di-
rected a guileless gaze in her direction.
“I think nothing,” he said, “nothing
but hypothetical thought experiments.
Don’t concern yourself unduly;
the
trait runs in the family.”
Tildy closed her mouth and kept
it shut.
Without intending to, Shaa
had reminded her of another trait that
apparently ran in his family - stab-
bing each other in the back. Could his
brother have been behind this attack,
if an attack was what it really had
been?
Which led her to another thought.
Tildamire had never yet seen Shaa
say anything without knowing exactly
what message would be drawn out of
his words; he was not shy about priz-
ing his own ability with allusions. If
he thought his brother was involved,
wouldn’t he come right out and discuss

it? Unless he didn’t trust her. Or un-
less he thought his brother might be
listening. . .
“Another possibility,” Shaa added,
“for your collection.
This could have
been a warning.”
“Against what?” Roni said.
“Any number of things, I’d imagine,”
said Karlini.
“How do you suppose Groot is keep-
ing at the moment?” remarked Shaa.
“We’ll know soon enough,” Karlini
said.
“We’ll be there in a few more
days.”
“Perhaps it might be a better idea to
ﬁnd out how he is before we get there.”
“Wait a minute,” said Tildamire. “If
there’s something going on with your
friend Groot, where would a warning
come from?”
Shaa grinned enigmatically. “There
are many friends in the world beyond

Haalsen Groot.”

Chapter6
OUT OF THE BLUE
“I DEMAND TO KNOW THE MEAN-
ING OF THIS!” Haalsen Groot roared.
On either side of him, a nattily liveried
member of the Communal Police held
one of his upper arms.
The sergeant in the doorway in front
of him regarded Groot with a blank, of-
ﬁciously precise gaze. “ ‘Tain’t no mean-
ing here to know at all,” he said. “The

order is signed and sealed, as you your-
self can see.” He did not, however, turn
the large unrolled sheet of parchment
so that Groot could view the writing
upon it, if any, or so he could view the
seals, if indeed those were present as
well.
“I see nothing of the sort,” said Groot,
dropping his volume but trying to in-
crease the snap in his tone.
He was
having no trouble with the snap. Groot
approved of keeping a set schedule and
had put this ideal into practice for him-
self. These rufﬁans had arrived while
he was reviewing correspondence in
his study over his breakfast tea, still
in his dressing gown.
He had, how-
ever, performed his setting-up exer-
cises upon arising, as was also his
scheduled habit, had seen to the neces-
sary ablutions, and had reviewed with
his clerk Julio the calendar for the day.

There had been no indication of an ex-
pected visit from any civic authorities
anywhere in their itinerary.
“I have
seen no order, heard no charges, known
no accuser. In case you have failed to
be apprised, sergeant, Oolsmouth is a
free city governed by the rule of law
and the guiding hand of the Council;
arbitrary seizure on an unspeciﬁed
charge is clearly not our policy.
Not
- our - policy!” he repeated, with icy
emphasis.
The sergeant,
a singularly stolid
fellow apparently chosen for this as-
signment on the basis of that very at-
tribute, gazed at Groot. “This address
is 25 Rockﬁsh Lane. You have already
answered to the name of Haalsen Th-
elomarias Groot, and have so identiﬁed
yourself. I have further identiﬁed my-
self as a duly constituted ofﬁcer of the
Civil Council of Oolsmouth and have

informed you that I possess a fully
executed warrant for your arrest and
imprisonment. In just accordance with
the law and practice of Oolsmouth,
you are therefore to consider your-
self under arrest, and are directed to
surrender your person into my cus-
tody without delay.
Failure to do so
may expose you to additional criminal
charges as well as the corporal power
of our rightful authority. Now, please
come along, sir.”
Groot would have crossed his arms
over his chest; it was the sort of pos-
ture that went with the deﬁant glower
he was radiating. His arms, though, re-
mained in the ﬁrm grasp of the other
two troopers. He stuck out his chin in-
stead. “I demand to know the charges
against me; that is my right under the
law.”
The
sergeant
didn’t
even
bother

to shake his head; his expression re-
mained placid.
“I have my orders,
which make no mention of the exer-
cise of this right under the present
circumstances.”
“No mention?” said Groot, his mus-
tache waving. “What is that supposed
to mean? Rights are rights.”
“My orders have suspended your
ability to exercise this right in the
present instance.”
“What? You can’t just -”
“The Council has spoken,” the sergean
stated.
“The Council has not spoken, damn
your eyes! I’m on the Council. Don’t
you think if the Council was going to
speak, it would speak directly to me?”
“I’m certain I wouldn’t know, sir.
Now, please come along.” The sergeant
nodded to his troops. “Fetch him now,
boys.”

“Now just a moment,” said Groot,
digging in his slippered heels against
the wood parquet ﬂoor of the entry
hall. The policemen paid no attention
to his attempt at friction and merely
hoisted him into the air, then carried
him toward the door. “At least let me
put on a suit of proper clothes, unless
these almighty orders of yours prohibit
that, too.”
The sergeant raised his hand and
Groot found himself lowered to the
ﬂoor. Unrolling the parchment again,
the sergeant scrutinized it, his lips
moving in silence as he made his way
through its ofﬁcial language.
“The
order does not expressly address the
question of garb,” he said. “Thus the
matter is left implicitly to my discre-
tion.
From the urgency with which
the remainder of the order is phrased,
and the dangerous individual you are

deemed to be, sir -”
“What?” said Groot again.
“I beg
your -”
“- as I say, sir, a thoroughly danger-
ous individual, and one with whom I
am cautioned to take every care lest
you should gain the chance to escape,
possibly causing injury, maiming, or
death to myself or my subordinates in
the prosecution of your desires; from
this danger and the urgency of the
orders my interpretation of this discre-
tionary power would prohibit me from
showing you any leniency, sir.” Again
he nodded to the others.
“Bring him
along. You can bind him outside.”
They crossed the threshold more ig-
nominiously than Groot could recall
having done since he had been in occu-
pation of this house, or at least since
-
Groot’s
house
servant,
who
had

weighed the unattractive option of im-
palement on a pike against the hazards
of letting the troops in the door when
they had originally pounded for entry,
appeared around the corner ahead of
them at a run. He was being followed
at the heels by Julio, who had left the
house by foot mere moments before the
police had arrived. Julio began unreel-
ing his own tirade while still skidding
to a halt.
“Julio,” said Groot, as the
troopers lashed his hands together
behind his back.
Julio fell silent and cocked his head
attentively, panting freely from his un-
expected sprint. “I fear you might as
well desist; this functionary is ﬁrmly
dedicated to his sacred orders, what-
ever they really are and whomever
they are really from. I’d best go along
with him and then try to tangle this
thing apart. You round up old Snee and

meet us at the prison - I assume we’re
going to the barbican in the Hall?”
“Aye, sir,” said the sergeant.
“You meet us at the prison, then,
with the appropriate writs.
Eelmon
will escort us there.”
“Yes, Meester Groot,” said Eelmon,
the house servant, from inside the open
door. Julio took off down the street to-
ward the ofﬁces of Snee, the principal
lawyer for Haalsen Traders, and Groot
fell in with the police as they marched
off together. The door slammed behind
them and Eelmon reappeared, heft-
ing a hastily-stuffed carpetbag. Groot
watched the familiar streets go past,
observing familiar faces turn to stare
at the party in astonishment (as much
for the spectacle of himself abroad in
his dressing gown, he thought sourly,
as for the company he was keeping,
and for the fact that he’d been clapped

in irons), and even considered a bow
to his audience as they crossed the
Bridge of Bronze over the Green Canal.
To their left at the top of the bridge,
down the Green Canal ‘s navigation
channel, the River Oolvaan proper was
visible with its usual clutter of vessels.
The south bank of the Green Canal was
lined chock-a-block with its own docks
and warehouses; in fact, Groot’s own
docks and warehouses, or a major com-
plex of them at any rate. One ship was
presently tied up, the ocean-going Fair
Market Value, due to ﬁnish her loading
by noon for a run eastward along the
coast. Instead of the expected clamor
of teamsters, crane operators, steve-
dores, and sailors, though, the dock
was eerily quiet and virtually empty.
But who were those people lined up in
formation on the wharf, and standing
guard in front of the warehouse door?

Then Groot made sense of the scene,
in the moment before they trod down
the descending slope of the high-arched
bridge and were lost again in the midst
of the streets. More police troops had
just shown up here, at the warehouse.
The place was being shut down. What
was going on?
Groot was not only a leading busi-
nessman in Oolsmouth, he took pains
to be a good citizen as well.
It was
the soul of good business practice to
participate in the affairs of one’s com-
munity, to secure a local power base,
and to become and remain generally
well-connected;
consequently,
Groot
had gone out of his way to do all these
things.
The principal reason behind
such a philosophy, of course, is to make
sure that one can sense even subtle
changes in the local climate and can
position one’s self to take the best

advantage of them, not to mention get-
ting advance notiﬁcation of any overtly
hostile moves that may be brewing
aimed at one’s own operations. What
had gone wrong here?
Groot hadn’t
heard a whisper of warning.
How
could he have been taken unawares,
and how could anyone else have ac-
quired (without his noticing it) the
political strength to move against him
so blatantly?
There was the barest possibility that
some mistake was being made; that a
confusion of identity had occurred, or
that someone had gone off half-cocked.
The move felt too well-planned for that,
though, what with his arrest and the si-
multaneous descent upon his commer-
cial operations. If a mistake had been
made, it would all shake out in due
course anyway.
Viewed from another
angle, however, Groot thought with

some anticipatory satisfaction that a
mistake certainly had been made. By
the time he was ﬁnished with its au-
thors, whoever was behind this would
fully appreciate, to their woe, just how
big a mistake it had been. Groot had
resources that even a well-planned
raid against him would be unlikely to
reveal. He also had friends.
Only what if this offensive wasn’t re-
ally aimed at Groot at all, but through
him at his friends? From the increased
level of activity he’d been hearing
about from Max and Shaa there was
obviously something of signiﬁcant im-
port underway.
And the boat on the
Oolvaan would be due in Oolsmouth
port soon ...
Ahead of them, a wide splash of sun-
lit lawn appeared, a spouting fountain
at its center. The street they were on
had widened into a boulevard, one of

the seven that radiated out from the
Plaza of the Bureaucrats, as Groot re-
ferred to it, and now the boulevard
opened into the Plaza itself. The foun-
tain in the civic park in the plaza’s
center contained several statues ar-
ranged in an interlocking tableau of
local symbols - a heroic twin-masted
ship with two ranks of churning row-
ers, a messy spiral of storm clouds and
thunderbolts looming over the ship
and dripping water on its canted deck,
an out-of-scale ﬁsherman swinging a
full net of carp with one hand and
waving a gaffed squid with the other,
and so forth. A small gang of urchins
were splashing around under the oblig-
atory breaching leviathan, and they,
too, paused in their free-for-all to gawk
as Groot was led around the fountain
and toward the block-long Hall of the
People on the other side of the plaza.

Groot had been agitating sarcasti-
cally if less than seriously at Coun-
cil meetings for years, when nothing
else interesting was up for discussion
(which in truth was most of the time),
to have the name of the Hall of the
People changed, since as they all knew
the People had very little to do with
anything signiﬁcant.
It was also a
thoroughly unaesthetic name, the sort
of name only a bureaucrat could love.
Although
Groot’s
proposals
usually
brought a round of nods and approving
“hurrumphs” from around the Council
chamber, nothing had ever come of it.
The people of Oolsmouth and the sur-
rounding countryside, which also fell
under the territory of Oolsmouth Free
State, while understanding that there
was not in truth very much they could
do to inﬂuence the course of govern-
ment, notwithstanding the constant

rhetoric concerning The Will of the
People and their Elected Representa-
tives, were not (for the most part) too
unhappy with the general state of af-
fairs, especially when they reﬂected
back on the comparison with the ear-
lier autocratic regime. It was true that
the Council was ﬁlled out by the heads
of the local trade guilds, a smattering
of directly elected spokespersons, and
even a few token nonhumans, but the
unmistakable balance of control rested
with the leading merchants and their
proxies. All in all, though, the business
interests tended to pursue a freewheel-
ing policy of laissez-faire leavened with
civic social beneﬁts that were rather a
bit on the paternalistic side.
The People might not have fully ap-
propriate representation on the Coun-
cil, but everyone was aware that they
had risen in the past and could, of

course, do so again. The truth was that
the merchant class was not really that
much more powerful than the popu-
lation at large, and since there were
more working people than merchant
bourgeois things tended to even out.
As a city based primarily on commerce
rather than on manufacturing or the
exploitation of natural resources, or on
the production of goods and services
for local consumption.
the economy
did not support the growth of an oli-
garchy or even a dramatic shift of ac-
tual power to one group or another; as
a result, the basic social contract had
remained in large part intact.
That
being so, the People as a whole ﬁgured
they had better things to do than waste
time grubbing around in the Council.
Watching the Council in its various gy-
rations was a popular spectator sport,
though, since the merchants liked to

use it as just another arena for their
typically cutthroat competition.
The Hall of the People, even for a
powerful city on the leading edge of
the current wave of prosperity, was
an unquestionable civic extravagance.
There was no doubt about its symbol-
ism - here was a city of wealth and
stability, with a government comfort-
able and entrenched enough to grant
itself the luxury of municipal monu-
mentalism. Even so, it was clear that
the Hall of the People would not exist,
at least in its present form, without
a generous philanthropic contribution
from the past.
People seemed to enjoy discover-
ing the same thing over and over
again.
Accordingly, Oolsmouth was
not the ﬁrst city to take advantage of
the strategic signiﬁcance conferred by
control of the mouth of the Oolvaan.

Where Oolsmouth now stood, more or
less, there had once been another city
whose heyday dated back before the
great Dislocation and the fall of tech-
nological civilization, and whose own
descent into the swamp had probably
been contemporaneous with it.
The
chronic overﬂow of the Oolvaan onto
its alluvial ﬂoodplain and the silting
of its delta had spared Oolsmouth’s an-
cestor from the fate of most structures
of its period, or at least the fate of those
structures that people could enter with-
out dropping dead from one or another
of the myriad curses of the ancients.
The fate of virtually everything from
before the Dislocation, not surprisingly,
had been utter eradication through
cannibalistic dismantling or sheer bad
temper, so few discrete traces of the
old world remained. There was always
the tread of the suppressing foot of the

gods to remember, too, as it descended
metaphorically from the heavens to
squash any signs and knowledge of the
past, as well as those who seemed too
freely interested in it.
The ancients
had been a crafty and cunning lot,
however, so it wouldn’t have really sur-
prised Groot one bit to discover that
they had arranged for this city to be
swallowed by the river and covered
by a swamp, awaiting a more rational
time for its excavation.
Of course, Groot had hung around
with Maximillian the Vaguely Disrep-
utable, who spent a lot of time try-
ing to commune with the ancients in
one way or another, so he acknowl-
edged that his attitude toward them
had most likely been colored by Max’s.
Still, most of what the present age
had pulled from the draining swamp
over the past ﬁfty years or so had been

used not for study or gloriﬁcation of
the past, but for building materials.
It was enough to make a sensible per-
son wonder just how much the current
civilization really differed from the
savages of the past, especially when
you saw what most of the scavenged
building materials had been used to
construct.
The Hall of the People hadn’t all
been assembled out of exhumed parts,
of course.
Much of it was built of
locally-quarried stone, and the major-
ity of the outer surface was faced with
marble imported, at signiﬁcant but
not totally unreasonable cost, by a con-
sortium of merchants who had been
on the Council at the time, when the
Council itself had been an institution
constituted solely for its promotional
value by the government of Hugo the
Autocrat. That Council had had noth-

ing better to do than putter around
with public works of marginal utility,
although the precedent they had estab-
lished had held through to the present
modern time. Each edge of the build-
ing, including not only the four major
corners and the margins of the roof
but the cornices and window frames
as well, had facings made not of stone
but of ancient sheet metal, polished
now to a slightly oxidized shine that
made glancing toward the Hall on a
sunny day a painful experience, and
would leave one walking around dis-
tracted by bright afterimages for the
next half-hour.
In the domed roof of
the rotunda above the Council cham-
ber, too, the large translucent panels
had been cast from a slurry of crazed,
opaciﬁed, and pebbled fragments of an-
cient glass. Furthermore, for years the
building had been generating rumors

of secret passages, hidden partitions,
and moving ﬂoors incorporating totally
unnecessary bits of old ﬂotsam and
jetsam.
By anyone’s estimation, the archi-
tect had been a madman.
The Hall’s front facade, which Groot
was squinting his way toward now, had
been outﬁtted with more pillars and
heroic statuary than strict good taste
would have been comfortable with, and
these elements of modern construction
sat uneasily with the dour evidence of
times now gone. Which wasn’t to say,
Groot didn’t hesitate to admit, that all
the gimcrack decoration would have ﬁt
better in any other surroundings. Bad
taste had a certain timeless quality to
it.
The Hall was outﬁtted with a vari-
ety of entrances in addition to that of
the grand main door, with its exces-

sive colonnade and exhausting ﬂight of
broad stairs and long coiled drowsing-
grifﬁn balustrades. The portal on the
right side just around the corner from
the plaza led to the main garrison of
police and, beneath it, to the prison.
Groot had not visited the basements
before, but in the typical manner of
people who knew that law-enforcement
activity was constantly underway but
who didn’t feel much personal connec-
tion with it, he’d been aware of where
the jail was located and what was prob-
ably happening there.
Law enforcement was just one of
the activities that had to proceed for a
smoothly functioning society to exist,
and it was no more of a star attraction
than, say, tax collection.
In the old
days (not the days of the ancients, but
the days of the present generation’s
own great-grandparents, for example)

when things were much simpler all
around, albeit and undeniably much
more savage and brutish, law enforce-
ment was simultaneously a more arbi-
trary and a more crowd-pleasing enter-
prise, especially in its terminal stages.
Now, though, Oolsmouth was a civi-
lized place, and these were civilized
times, so the bread-and-circus atmo-
sphere fostered by peremptory public
hangings, ﬂoggings, mutilations, rack-
ings, and assorted other tortures had
been ﬁrmly laid to rest, along with
many of those who had experienced
them at ﬁrst hand.
Groot was also
aware through his contacts from the
Council that the equipment and facili-
ties for these various excruciations had
not been destroyed, but were merely
in storage somewhere in the building
in front of him, stockpiled no doubt by
prudent heads in the speculation of a

future turn of the wheel, so to speak.
Whether there were dark corners and
hidden departments using these meth-
ods still was a question Groot was hop-
ing would remained unanswered while
whatever he was involved in played
itself out.
After the piercing reﬂections from
the metal details of the Hall’s exte-
rior facade, the interior corridor of the
police section proved to be a dimly-
lit relief.
The common area of the
prison, though lit with equal inade-
quacy, proved less so.
Long tunnels
with barred gates snaked away from
archways in three walls; the long nar-
row stair up to the ground ﬂoor, which
they had just navigated, eased its way
down the fourth. The jailer roused him-
self to produce a logbook from a niche
under the stair as the troopers contin-
ued to hold Groot tightly, and between

the two of them he and the sergeant
noted Groot’s arrival on a fresh page.
“Make your mark here,” the jailer di-
rected, pointing to a space next to their
new set of totally illegible scratchings.
Obviously they were used to dealing
with common rufﬁans, Groot thought,
as he instead inscribed his signature,
complete with his usual intertwined
loops and long sashaying underline
ﬂourishes. The jailer, a burly man with
the troglodytic pallor of someone who
has spent his entire working life in-
doors, gazed intently at the signature,
then looked Groot up and down.
He
began absently licking his chops. “And
what standard of accommodations be
yer requesting, yer lordship?” he said.
“Two, er, three silver ools will get you
-”
“There will be none of that here,”
said the sergeant.
“This man is dan-

gerous, and must be given no consid-
eration beyond the needs of our own
security; these are my orders.”
“But -”
“Do you understand?”
Eelmon
had
dogged
their
steps
throughout the walk and was now
hanging about next to the foot of
the stairs,
clutching the carpetbag
as though he expected someone to try
to rob him of it, here in the central jail.
Eelmon was a trusty sort with a good
head on him. Groot thought, a sturdy
man; he knew his business.
Groot
caught his eye and nodded slightly.
Eelmon pursed his lips and nodded
back.
The jailer scowled, spit off into the
corner with pinpoint aim undoubtedly
seasoned through long practice, and
produced the traditional ring of keys
from his belt.
Unlocking the gate on

the left with a shrill creak and hoist-
ing a lantern from its peg just inside
the entrance, he led the way off into
the gloom. Groot found his nose wrin-
kling involuntarily. For someone who
bathed unfashionably often, every day
if he could, such an unwashed stench
was not encouraging, not to mention
its dominant component aroma that
indicated a total lack of concern for
sanitation. Sanitation was one of the
obsessions of the ancients that Max
and Shaa both ardently admired and
Groot had joined them as a full-ﬂedged
disciple. Well, he thought, perhaps this
will be the worst they intend to do to
me.
The sergeant and his troopers saw
Groot securely installed alone in a
small cell of perhaps three long strides
in each direction before removing the
chains and bonds from his arms. The

new chain around his ankle, when fas-
tened to an eyebolt in the ﬂoor, barely
let him reach the intimidatingly thick
wood door. Eelmon was still out there
in the hall, though, and no one had
made a move to imprison him as well,
so one of Groot’s major worries, that
he would be held incommunicado in an
unmarked cell with the records of his
incarceration unaccountably missing,
seemed to be provisionally relieved.
The sergeant led his men off, hurriedly
now, probably to report in to his ofﬁ-
cers or to whomever had drafted his
mysterious orders, leaving the jailer to
inspect the contents of the carpetbag
under Eelmon ‘s supervision. Although
they were in the hall out of Groot’s di-
rect sight, he did hear the gentle clink
of coins changing hands; Eelmon had
clearly
understood
Groot’s
message
about the importance of giving the

jailer a generous payoff, even (or es-
pecially) in the face of the sergeant’s
express instructions to the contrary.
After a moment, the jailer entered
with the carpetbag and set it on the
rush-strewn ﬂoor within easy reach.
“Here you are, yer lordship,” he said
deferentially.
“I’ll be getting you the
bench and candles shortly.” He touched
his forelock and backed out.
How much did Eelmon pay this fel-
low? Groot wondered. Whatever it was,
Groot had no doubt that the money
would be a prudent investment in his
future.
Who knew, perhaps it might
even help insure that he would have a
future. Groot settled back against the
wall with his legs stretched out in front
of him.
When the candle arrived, he
would take a closer look at the chains.
In the brief glimpses he’d gotten in
the light from the jailer’s lantern. the

links had appeared old and thick and
were covered with a ﬂaky veneer of
rust.
The lock on the ankle shackle
had also seemed to present possibili-
ties, Whether trying to escape was a
good idea, of course, was an entirely
different matter.
When the candle and bench came,
they were accompanied not only by the
jailer but by Julio and the lawyer, Snee.
The jailer left them alone with the cell
door propped open and went out to lurk
in the hall. Julio and Snee arranged
themselves on the bench across the cell
from Groot. “To what do you attribute
this incarceration, Meester Groot?” the
lawyer said in a rush, eager to get the
ﬁrst word in.
“I had hoped that was what you were
planning to tell me, “ Groot said, “Why
don’t we edge backward a step or two
ﬁrst? What is going on out there? On

the way to this place, my route passed
the dock on Green Canal - all my fa-
cilities there were apparently being
placed under guard.”
“This is true,” Julio told him.
“All
the Haalsen Traders assets that are a
matter of ofﬁcial record are now under
impound. From reports at the various
scenes and from the single seizure I
succeeded in witnessing myself, at the
storehouse on Pike Street and Old Mill,
the operations were conducted quickly,
in a businesslike manner, but with
some level of confusion on the part of
the troops involved.
Nevertheless, it
is clear that most if not all of these
forces were drawn from the Commu-
nal Police supplemented by the civic
defense militia, acting under instruc-
tions supposedly issued by the Council.
This was a coordinated effort to seal
all buildings, intern all assets, and

stop all business operations. Since the
police were a bit ragged in their exe-
cution of this attack, as I said before,
it’s uncertain how well planned this all
was -”
“Obviously
it
was
planned
well
enough,” said Groot.
“But by whom?
And why?
And - no, but ﬁrst, was
anyone hurt?”
“None of our people were signiﬁ-
cantly injured, as far as I’ve been able
to ﬁnd out, although there were a few
stevedores roughed up, a few smashed
doors, the temporary standoffs you’d
expect when no one on either side is
quite sure of what is actually hap-
pening.” Julio hesitated.
“If I might
venture a conclusion, I would say that
violence or even intimidation through
violence does not seem to have been
the goal, just conﬁscation of property.
No one else was arrested beside you,

yourself.”
“One thing to consider is that some-
one may be sending you a message,”
commented Snee.
“A message may be part of it,” Julio
said, “but my opinion is that sending
a message is not the most signiﬁcant
point here. “
“There is clearly more than that go-
ing on,” agreed Groot. “You don’t send
a businessman a message by shut-
ting down his whole business.
When
you’ve already tried to exterminate
someone, what do you have left to say
to them, and who is even left to hear
the message? You haven’t left yourself
any room to maneuver, either.
What
more can you do to escalate? If you’re
sending messages, you build up to
the scorching of earth, you don’t start
there.
The way you describe it, this
certainly sounds like the imposition of

barren wasteland to me.
What more
can they do now?”
“You are still in good health, I pre-
sume?” asked Snee.
“Is that just an oblique suggestion,
or do you know something I don’t?”
Snee ran a well-manicured hand
through his thinning light-brown hair,
brushing it carefully back along his
temples. “Ah, well,” he temporized.
Groot shifted his legs, explicitly rat-
tling the chain. “That is not an answer,
and that is certainly not the kind of
thing I’m paying you for.
So you tell
me straight, lawyer, what’s happen-
ing here? On what charge am I being
held?”
“I don’t know,” Snee said reluctantly.
“I beg your pardon?” said Groot. This
was not the response he had expected.
“What do you mean, you don’t know?”
“No ofﬁcial paperwork has been reg-

istered. I have my apprentices pursu-
ing the matter even as we sit here, but
so far nothing has come to light.”
“Please explain something to me,”
said Groot.
“I am incarcerated in an
ofﬁcial civic facility, am I not? For this
to be the case, a charge does have to be
ﬁled, doesn’t it? Do we have a rule of
law, or don’t we?”
“It’s not that simple,” said the lawyer
in a rather professorial tone.
“You’re
an intelligent man,
you know how
things work, so don’t act so surprised.
In the law, there are usually quite a
number of ways to get around inconve-
niences. If a declaration of martial law
has been made, or let us say a state of
emergency or a state of civil siege, var-
ious guarantees of due process can be
suspended. Beyond that, it is possible
for the Council to act peremptorily, or
even for individual Councillors to move

unilaterally on their own if certain ex-
treme contingencies arise.”
“I didn’t know that,” said Groot.
“Why don’t I know that?
I’m on the
Council.”
“These things are on the books,”
Snee said. “They’re obscure, but if you
know where to look what you will ﬁnd
makes for quite intriguing reading.”
“What ‘extreme contingencies’ are
we talking about here?”
“Could they be holding you for trea-
son?” the lawyer asked cautiously.
“Treason?” Groot said incredulously.
“Against whom? This is a free city!”
“Consorting with enemies, then.”
“Whose enemies?
Treason?
Of
course not. “
“You do have many foreign contacts,”
Julio said.
“I’m a trader!” said Groot. “I’m sup-
posed to have foreign contacts!”

“That could be at the root of your
arrest, “ Snee said thoughtfully. “Not
the seizures of property, but perhaps
the arrest.
If some Council member
had evidence that you were in contact
with hostile foreigners, they could have
used that as a basis for drafting an or-
der to hold you preemptively for the
good of the state. Such an order could
be kept secret for a limited amount of
time, especially if there was evidence of
other members of an active conspiracy
still free and active.
Technically, the
order would have to be made ofﬁcial
eventually, though. “
Groot shook his head.
“This all
sounds too autocratic for my liking.
What’s the purpose of due process if
you can get around it whenever you
want? Do we have an independent ju-
diciary, or is that just another ﬁgment,
too?”

“Is that a serious question?” said
Snee.
“I’ll be trying to get you a ju-
dicial hearing, of course, but I have
to tell you that no judge is going to
want to get in the way of the Council
in a matter such as this, whether it in-
volves state security or just a struggle
between individual Council members.
Any judge in his right mind would de-
fer to the Council itself when it’s using
its own extraordinary judicial powers.
And as you well know, Oolsmouth’s
own autocratic past is not so far be-
hind it that there are not vestiges of
it still hanging around here and there.
Some of them even remain statutory.”
“Damn,” said Groot. “So I’m just sup-
posed to sit here, rotting in the ﬁlth?
One of the reasons I clawed after per-
sonal success and wealth was to insu-
late myself from annoyance. Are you
telling me I was wasting my time?”

“The law is your friend,” observed
the lawyer, “except when, occasionally,
it isn’t.”
“Thank you,” Groot said. “Thank you
very much. I will treasure that pearl
of wisdom, alone in this squalid cell. I
assume you have not learned what’s
behind all these property seizures ei-
ther?”
Snee looked at the damp ceiling, at
its close-ﬁtting stones. “Unfortunately
not. I’m trying to lay hands on one of
the order sheets the police have been
waving about. That may give us more
information, but they’re obviously un-
der instructions not to let anyone actu-
ally read the things. “
Groot looked at Julio. “Who do we
have who could obtain one of these
sheets?”
Julio hesitated; more bad news, no
doubt.
“You realize, Meester Groot,

that you can’t actually pay anyone at
the moment. All assets are frozen. You
don’t have to worry about me, sir,” he
added hastily, looking away. “I’ve been -
well, you just don’t have to worry about
me, that’s all. It’s not just a matter of
money.”
Groot had made Julio a partner
in Haalsen Traders, under terms that
made it in his interest to stay with him,
but Groot was willing to accept Julio’s
statement at face value for whatever
it worth beyond that.
Groot wasn’t
going to turn totally paranoid, at least
not yet, and anyway who else did he
have who was acting for him on the
outside?
“Who else is loyal or moti-
vated enough, or paid up sufﬁciently in
advance, then?”
“I’m not sure I want to hear this,”
stated Snee. “I don’t know what means
you intend to use to obtain the order

sheet, but if it’s not strictly aboveboard
then we’ll all be safer if I don’t know
about it. Beforehand, at any rate. If
you do secure one of these sheets, let
me know, but don’t tell me how you’ve
done it. I’ll keep on trying through my
own means.”
“Very well,” said Groot. “How long
will it take you to get to the bottom of
this?”
Snee put on a cagy look.
“In this
case, I’m positive that evidentiary dis-
covery will be a tricky process. There
are clearly many things we don’t yet
know -”
“That is the whole point, isn’t it?”
The lawyer shrugged. “I’ll do what I
can. You may want to pursue your own
means as well.”
“Thank you.” said Groot with a trace
of a snarl. “Why don’t you get down to
it, then?”

Snee rose.
“I will take my leave.”
He bowed to the reclining Groot, then
backed out the door.
“Of course I’ll pursue my own means,”
Groot
muttered,
staring
after
the
lawyer with a dark gaze.
“I’m not a
fool, except perhaps in thinking I could
rely on a lawyer to get me out of a
mess with the law. “ He looked up at
Julio. “We’ll have to round up as full
a Council session as we can get this
time of year. Try to ﬁnd out where the
others stand ﬁrst, as far as you can.”
“Dooglas?” said Julio.
“I wouldn’t be surprised. It’s a much
more blatant move than you’d expect,
but who else is the leading candidate,
anyway?”
“Indeed,” Julio said in a dour voice.
“You haven’t been spending much time
cultivating your faction, have you?”
“No, I haven’t, as you know perfectly

well,” said Groot.
“That doesn’t look
like a very good move in retrospect,
does it?”
“No, sir, I have to say it does not.”
“Hmpph.” Groot thought for a mo-
ment. “What does Sy have to say for
himself? Where has he been in all this?
Why didn’t he see something coming?”
“He wasn’t at any of the facilities I
visited, and I didn’t have a chance to
swing round his house.”
“Perhaps he’ll show up.” Sy Gazoont
was the company sorcerer and commu-
nicator. “We only have a few days to get
all this wrapped up or our friends head-
ing down the river will appear right in
the middle of it. “
“Indeed, yes, sir. I take your mean-
ing. If there’s nothing more, perhaps I
should be moving along myself?”
“Yes,” said Groot.
“Is Eelmon still
out there?
You can take him if you

want; you may need another pair of
legs more than I need a runner on call
here. Find out what’s behind this and
who we have to ﬁght.”
“I’ll check back with you later,” said
Julio.
He vanished through the door-
way.
The jailer promptly reappeared,
checked Groot’s shackles to make sure
no one had tampered with them un-
der the cover of the meeting, tugged
his forelock, and edged out of the cell
again.
The thick door thudded back
into place.
This was a ﬁne kettle of ﬁsh, no
question about it. Groot got to his feet,
clanking conspicuously, and set to ex-
amining the features of the cell, not
that there were many features with
which to be concerned.
With the ex-
ception of the wood of the door and
its cast iron crosspieces, the rest of
the cell was faced with stone.
Even

the ﬂoor was stone, not dirt - no, on
closer inspection, the ﬂoor was some
type of concrete.
Could this be part
of the foundation? Was he really that
far down in the building?
The light
from the single candle was fairly weak,
making Groot’s examination not only
tedious but a matter of judgment as
well. Then again, he had all the time
he needed to absorb the sights since he
didn’t seem to be going anywhere else
any too rapidly.
Groot took a better look at one wall.
Perhaps the regular rectangular stones
making up the wall had also been cast,
not quarried. Concrete was generally
more crumbly than genuine native
rock, but this stuff seemed quite hardy.
His ﬁngernail failed to scratch it, and
the only sediment left on his ﬁnger
after the attempt was not white ce-
ment dust but plain old ﬁlth. It would

be ridiculous to try to tunnel out, that
much was clear. The only existing exits
were the door and the tiny barred ven-
tilation shaft in the ceiling that angled
who knew where;
there wasn’t any
daylight showing through it, surely
enough. Up there, though, on the out-
side wall just below the ceiling, that
discolored area - what was that?
He carried the bench over to the wall
and climbed up on it, candle in hand.
One rectangular stone did indeed have
a different look to it than the rest of
the wall; fresher, perhaps? Less black-
ened with time and the soot of candle
ﬂames?
Groot rapped on it, then on
the next stone over. Both were appar-
ently solid. The scratch test, however,
proved more interesting.
He felt as
though he’d dragged his ﬁnger across a
coarse sandpaper or a length of pumice,
but a powder of small gritty particles

was left on his hand.
A new concrete block, cast in place?
Surely the old one hadn’t just crumbled
to nothing, not with the surrounding
pieces as solid as they were. Not a ﬂaw
in construction, either, most likely. Per-
haps some earlier prisoner had tried to
chip or drill his way out, or the new
block was now ﬁlling a space that had
once been open. Could this have been
another ventilation hole? Such a hole
would have been barred, no doubt, but
a window-type opening in an outer wall
would have probably communicated di-
rectly with the outside of the building...
Groot replaced the bench on the far
side of the cell, kicked the chain into
a comfortable position, and began to
pace, three strides out, three strides
back. How did they make concrete in
the ﬁrst place?
The scrape of the locking bar on the

door interrupted him again. Had Julio
forgotten something? The jailer opened
the door wide.
With him was an un-
familiar man, garbed in a dark sober
clerical cloak and coat like Julio’s, to
be sure, but wearing spectacles and a
full beard, not just a mustache. “This
person to see you,” said the jailer.
Groot indicated the bench with one
hand and retreated to the back wall.
The man entered, swept a quick glance
around the cell, and made a short
bow toward Groot. “Meester Haalsen
Groot,” he stated.
“And who might you be?”
“My name is not important. I repre-
sent the Bank of the New Dawn.”
The Bank of the New Dawn? Groot
had no relationship with such an in-
stitution;
his accounts were all at
Oolvaan Mutual. For that matter, had
he ever heard of this Bank of the New

Dawn? “I see,” said Groot. “What can I
do for you? Unfortunately I am not at
present in a position to offer the usual
pleasantries of comfort and drink, al-
though you’re welcome to the bench.”
“Thank you,” said the banker, seat-
ing himself, but carefully keeping his
cloak aloof from the ﬂoor.
Groot, not
to be outdone by the game of body lan-
guage, settled to his spot on the ﬂoor;
if he kept getting this many visitors,
he’d have to think about bribing the
jailer for another bench.
The banker
inspected the cell again, then summed
up with a disapproving tsk-tsk.
“You
are perhaps wondering what brings
me here for this audience,” he contin-
ued, still eyeing the rude surroundings.
“For that matter, you may have been
wondering what sorry state of affairs
has brought you here, yourself.”
The man seemed to be waiting for

some reply.
Groot crossed his arms
and rattled the chain. The chain was
turning out to be a useful prop, under-
scoring the reality of the situation and
Groot’s awareness of it in one terse
motion, sound effects included. Groot
was not as great a fan of improvisation
as Max, but there was still no doubt
that one had to make do with what one
had available. “Well,” said the banker.
“I feel it is appropriate to tell you that
these two conditions, that is, both our
presences in this particular place, are
related.”
“Are they, now,” said Groot.
“Yes. You see, the Bank of the New
Dawn, with which I believe I may
have mentioned I am afﬁliated, has
acquired the assets of the Oolvaan
Mutual Bank.
In fact, through this
acquisition, the Oolvaan Mutual Bank
has become, temporarily to be sure, a

wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank of
the New Dawn. Temporarily, as I say,
on a time scale most likely measured
in days, at the conclusion of which the
Oolvaan Mutual Bank will be totally
merged into the operations of the Bank
of the New Dawn. Does that clarify the
situation?”
“Not in the least.” said Groot. Who
was this idiot? This was not at all the
sort of banker with whom Groot pre-
ferred to deal. “Feel free to proceed.” he
added, not sure that this person would
pick up the thread again without prod-
ding.
The banker gave a genteel little
cough. “Very well. A major portion of
these assets, that is, the assets of the
Oolvaan Mutual Bank, as I am certain
you will be aware, are associated with
you and your various business enter-
prises.
To be quite straightforward

about this, the Bank of the New Dawn,
in order to safeguard its investments
and insure the integrity of all its as-
sets, including those newly acquired
from the Oolvaan Mutual Bank, has
been compelled by good business prac-
tice to reduce our downside exposure.
As the major downside risk is posed
by your operations, I am certain you
will understand and sympathize with
our decision to bring our outstand-
ing loans into closer balance with our
tangible properties and liquidatable
collateral. Accordingly, we have acted
to restructure your outstanding cap-
italization and reduce what we have
concluded, after careful examination
of the records of the Oolvaan Mutual
Bank, to be an overextension of your
credit by the previous management.”
“Are you telling me you’re calling in
my loans?”

“I do believe that is what I have al-
ready said.”
It was such a ridiculous idea that
Groot had never seen it coming, even
with the time he’d already had to try
to ﬁgure out what was going on. Like
most traders and merchants, he relied
on a high degree of ﬁnancial leverage,
borrowing to ﬁnance trade voyages
and paying back with interest at their
completion, guaranteeing receivables,
arbitraging where appropriate.
He
had reciprocal relationships with other
traders in other locations who served
as his local agents in their own vicini-
ties. The other traders had letters of
credit from him and he had letters of
credit from them; Groot’s credit net-
work alone represented a signiﬁcant
amount of value in place.
In addi-
tion, his credit was, of course, also
good at the few foreign branches of

the Oolvaan Mutual Bank.
Oolvaan
Mutual had liked him.
The bank
had found his cash ﬂow unimpeach-
able.
“All of my accounts are fully
collateralized,” Groot stated.
“My op-
erations have been the biggest cash
cow Oolvaan Mutual has had on the
books for the last ﬁve years. My credit
and my bond have been unquestioned
across the face of the civilized world!”
This wasn’t merely insane and against
the terms of his contracts, it was bad
business.
“In the initial period of consolidation
of the Oolvaan Mutual Bank, or as I
should more correctly note, the former
Oolvaan Mutual Bank, into the Bank
of the New Dawn, the management of
the Bank of the New Dawn has elected
to utilize conservative accounting prac-
tices,” the banker expounded.
“That
is the most stewardly plan, at least,

and the one that is being followed at
present. Accordingly, we have elected
to write down the value of good will,
letters of credit, and other such soft
negotiables, and to accept only tangi-
ble property, valuables, and other hard
collateral for the liquidation of out-
standing accounts. You will appreciate
the prudence of our management deci-
sions in this regard, as a businessman
yourself.”
As the banker might more correctly
note,
a former businessman,
Groot
thought, if what he thought this guy
was saying was really true. “No mat-
ter what kind of internal decisions you
people have decided to make,” Groot
said, “you can’t just do this kind of
the thing by yourselves, unilaterally,
without any kind of notiﬁcation.”
“But I am notifying you,” said the
banker.

“This is totally ridiculous,” Groot
said, “not to mention completely against
normal practice. The loans from Oolvaan
Mutual were made to ﬁnance ongoing
operations. If you shut down those op-
erations and try only to realize salvage
value you destroy the value the loans
were made to ﬁnance.
Even so, the
value of all my outstanding loans is
more than adequately collateralized by
the warehouses, wharves, ships in port,
docking licenses, real estate, goods on
hand, and so forth. There was no need
to impound everything in sight even
if you thought you had the right to
impound anything in the ﬁrst place,
which I certainly do not concede.”
“Your concession is immaterial to
the reality of the situation. Your own
valuation of your assets, too, is of no
signiﬁcance to our auditors.
You, of
course, will make an unrealistically

high assessment of the value of your
warehouses and local property, while
our own rigorous investigation has put
a much more appropriate evaluation
into place.”
“What about the independent val-
uations Oolvaan Mutual had on ﬁle?
What about arbitration?”
The banker shrugged. “The Bank of
the New Dawn makes a point of our
reliance on our own trained profession-
als.”
The value of Groot’s warehouses
and local property, like all such val-
ues, could be assessed either high or
low. These New Dawn people were un-
questionably coming in at the lowest
of the low, although this man wasn’t
putting it in those terms, with the re-
sult being that to secure its payment
the bank was conﬁscating everything
of Groot’s it lay its hands on.
They

were grabbing property ﬁrst, and per-
haps (a shaky perhaps, from the look of
it) they might condescend to untangle
things later. They’d have had to pay off
or cut in or scare away enough Council
members to get the writs, to hire the
police, and to all-around have the clout,
and they’d have had to trample on laws
left and right. This was not a simple
operation or one with a low proﬁle, and
Groot was one of Oolsmouth’s leading
citizens.
How did they expect to get
away with it?
And of course not only had they con-
ﬁscated all of Groot’s property, they
had conﬁscated Groot himself.
“Why
am I sitting here in jail instead of being
out where I can help respond to your
needs?” Groot said; he’d try to play
along with the man for a minute and
see if he could shake loose any useful
information. “Why wasn’t I notiﬁed in

a businesslike fashion in the ﬁrst place
so we could do this thing in an orderly
manner, without needing to drag in the
police?”
The banker gave him a thin smile.
“Your reputation for resourcefulness
has preceded you,” he remarked. “For
our management to act responsibly, it
was clear we had to minimize the pos-
sibility of circumvention.” The banker
leaned forward and rested his hands on
his knees. “To be frank with you, our
external audit of the Haalsen Traders
collateral was not complete, and we
felt that the liquidation value on hand
would not be sufﬁcient to cover the
outstanding value of all loans. It was
felt that we would have a much bet-
ter chance of recovering full value if
we could deal with you directly.
Ac-
cordingly, we acted to assure that you
would not leave the city or become un-

available, thereby leaving your debts
unpaid, and the civil authorities, agree-
ing with our position, commissioned a
warrant for your arrest.”
This is the most ludicrous thing I’ve
ever heard, thought Groot. “You really
expect me to believe this concoction?”
“You are free to believe what you
choose,” said the banker. “After all, you
will have time to ponder, will you not?”
Perhaps the banker was deliberately
trying to provoke him, so they could
add attempted assault or another crim-
inal offense to the list of civil charges.
“We will see,” Groot said, trying for a
note of temperance. “So what is your
proposal?”
“Oh, we have no proposal per se at
this time.
This is purely a courtesy
visit.
The management of the Bank
of the New Dawn respectfully felt you
would appreciate this personal expla-

nation.”
Did they think this guy’s own spe-
cial touch would win them his future
business?
“Thank you,” said Groot.
“That’s very congenial of you, I’m sure.
Perhaps you’d also be so good as to
tell me how it is that the Bank of the
New Dawn carne to take over Oolvaan
Mutual in the ﬁrst place?” Oolvaan
Mutual had been secure in its inde-
pendence and apparently sound in its
capitalization or Groot would never
have remained with them.
For the ﬁrst time, the banker hesi-
tated.
Then, reluctantly, he said, “A
dispute between the two patrons was
involved.”
Oh, thought Grot. Damn. And he’d
thought he’d been getting a handle on
what was going on here. It made sense,
though. If gods were involved, all nor-
mal rules were off.

Banks,
like businesses,
organiza-
tions, and people in general, some-
times adopted gods as patrons, or were
adopted themselves by a god against
their will. In fact, without putting too
ﬁne a face on it, it was not unknown
for a god to basically strong-arm a
business
into
giving
its
allegiance,
thereby running what amounted to
a kind of super-powered protection
racket. There wasn’t much you could
do about being the object of such a
play unless you had the right connec-
tions and were willing to go fairly far
out on a limb to take advantage of
them. The real mystery was why the
opposite situation ever arose, why so
many people went out of their way to
draw a god’s attention to themselves.
While it was Groot’s attitude that no
one in his right mind would deliber-
ately seek to get mixed up with a god,

the fact remained that a lot of folks
were apparently in need of such psy-
chological therapy.
As if that wasn’t
enough, gods had also been known to
start real-world business enterprises
of their own.
Which of these situations were oper-
ating here Groot had no idea. “A dis-
pute,” he said.
“Apparently,” said the banker, push-
ing himself to his feet.
“Those of us
beneath the pinnacle of the hierarchy
have hesitated to inquire too deeply.”
“Wise of you, I’m sure. Just how long
do you plan to leave me rotting here?”
“I must return to the ofﬁce.” the
banker announced.
“I have already
exceeded my brief time allotment here.
Good day to you, then, Meester Groot.”
He ﬂuffed through the doorway in a
curl of cloak and disappeared down the
hall.

When he came to lock up, the jailer
brought him a lunch, or thought he
did, at any rate. Groot sipped at the
turgid mug of watered ale and set the
coarse black bread end aside in case
more company dropped by later. While
the ale set about adding its own acid
to the already burning sensation in his
stomach Groot tried to compose him-
self, and settled back for a try at a good
think.
Later in the afternoon - at least,
Groot assumed it was the afternoon -
Julio appeared again. “There is appar-
ently a problem with our bank, “ Julio
said.
“I’ve heard about it,” Groot told him.
“This is the story I was told.”
Julio listened silently, occasionally
shaking his head in disbelief. At the
conclusion, he shook his head once
more for good measure. “I don’t have

anything to add to that account,” he
stated. “I hadn’t even been aware that
Oolvaan Mutual had a relationship
with a god, nor had I known anything
of signiﬁcance about the Bank of the
New Dawn before this man related his
report to you.”
“Neither had I,” said Groot, “on ei-
ther count.
Assuming what he said
was accurate as far as it went, which
we may as well do in the absence of
any information to the contrary, it may
nevertheless be possible to make an ed-
ucated guess about what was going on
behind the scenes. This god who was
the patron of Oolvaan Mutual has been
forced to yield to the patron of New
Dawn, and New Dawn’s god is now
calling the shots.
Whoever Oolvaan
Mutual’s god was, he or she or what-
ever has clearly suffered a signiﬁcant
reverse.” Part of the whole idea behind

sponsoring a bank, if you were a god,
was to lend it the weight of your own
position and stability, so ﬂopping sides
and selling out depositors would be an
excellent way to undermine your own
credibility and send your worshippers
ﬂeeing to the hills.
“They do say, ‘Getting stuck with the
gods is a one-way street’,” said Julio.
“This mess would certainly seem to
bear that out.”
“Max will never let me live this
down,” Groot muttered.
Once you
were hooked up with a god you were
also gaffed onto whatever plots and in-
trigues the god was puttering around
with.
The downside risk that people
who trafﬁcked with the gods didn’t
usually consider, a risk which was not
inconsiderable, was the danger of be-
ing caught up in the god’s reverses.
On the face of it, that was what had

happened here. “Even if this story is
true, we certainly don’t know the part
of real importance.”
“You discount the rationale and mo-
tivations this banker set out?”
“Of course I do,” said Groot, “and so
do you, or you’re not the Julio I know,
but some cunning impostor.”
Julio’s sly smile appeared and van-
ished, the smile customers and most
others never had the slightest hint
might be present. When someone saw
that expression for the ﬁrst time, and
the transformation it brought to Julio’s
entire face, they generally were forced
into a reappraisal not only of Julio’s
capabilities, which had appeared com-
petent but dull, and his sense of hu-
mor, which had appeared to be totally
nonexistent, but of every transaction
they had had with him in the past. “In-
deed.” Julio said. “I have been think-

ing along the same lines as you, I
believe.
Someone, presumably who-
ever is behind this new bank, wants
to immobilize our operations, if not
destroy them outright, and strip you
of the ability to mount an active re-
sponse, but all that could be a case of
two birds with one stone. Do you think
they’re after the ship on the river? Not
only has Sy Gazoont disappeared, but
I may not have mentioned that the
public communicator has had his civic
commission temporarily suspended as
well.”
“You didn’t,” said Groot, “but that’s
a move to expect, isn’t it, whether they
were after one ship in particular or the
ﬂeet assets in toto; if we are prevented
from communicating with our assets
in the ﬁeld, we can’t even tell them to
take evasive action.
Still, I ﬁnd this
move suggestive. Even if the Proﬁt is

only one reason among many, it is not
beyond the bounds of plausibility that
the Proﬁt and its passengers may have
something to do with the timing of this
thing.
You said the police operations
seemed disorganized, as though they’d
been rushed into execution? The Proﬁt
is due to arrive within the next two
days, ahead of schedule - that could
have forced their hand prematurely.”
“You would think, though, that leav-
ing us confused about what is going on
could serve someone’s aims even more.
Why would the New Dawn bank bother
to send this person with an explana-
tion?”
“You would think that,” Groot said,
“wouldn’t you. An attempt at deliber-
ate misdirection? Perhaps our mysteri-
ous friends were merely ﬂaunting their
control of the situation, or thumbing
their noses.
A test to see how well

we can respond to unexpected attacks?
A throwing-down of a gauntlet?
Or
perhaps, and most likely of all, a com-
bination...” That was how Groot would
do it; there was no point in wasting
three moves when they could be pack-
aged into one.
Was his opponent a
player of games, or was there even a
single opponent? And which was the
central part of the move, here?
“So
who do you think would want us – me -
on ice most of all?” he said rhetorically.
Julio coughed discreetly.
“Perhaps
Meester Dooglas was recalling the inci-
dent concerning the Pecuniary Interest
...”
“That has been on my mind as I
rot here,” Groot admitted. “He’s been
trying to get even with me for that
ever since.” The Pecuniary Interest, at
that time known as the Dooglas Cloud,
had lost her mainmast and a third of

her crew overboard in bad weather
as she was returning, holds packed,
from a voyage to Cematrilla.
Groot’s
ﬂagship clipper Raging Torrent, which
had been running touch-and-go with
the Cloud throughout the expedition,
had escaped damage during the storm.
With the Cloud about to go to wreck
on a shoal and her crew loosing the
lifeboats, the Torrent had appeared,
offering rescue, and when the dust
had settled the quickly renamed Cloud
and its cargo and most of its thankful
crew had ended up on the Haalsen bal-
ance sheets.
It hadn’t been the ﬁrst
skirmish between Dooglas and Groot,
but it had been the kind of watershed
event that shapes a relationship indeﬁ-
nitely into the future. “He’s never been
this blatant before.” Groot remarked,
“which means if it’s him it may not be
him alone; he’d have to have accumu-

lated enough power or leverage to feel
conﬁdent of pulling off a stunt like this
and successfully holding off the coun-
terattack. You did try ﬁnding out what
Dooglas has been up to, I presume?”
“Of course,” said Julio.
“No one
seems to have seen him for the last
week or so, and nothing out of the or-
dinary seemed to be going on before
that time. I haven’t actually knocked
on his door, you understand, but I have
the impression that he has holed up
working on something. I left Eelmon to
watch his house.”
Groot lowered his voice;
a brief
scraping from beyond the door had
given him the feeling that the jailer
might be lurking about outside the cell
again. “Have you recovered any of the
emergency assets?”
Julio actually glanced over his shoul-
der before responding.
“The obvious

cache. If I was followed, so much the
better.
They would be expecting me
to start dipping into any secret re-
sources since everything else is frozen.
I’ve been making a show of abruptly
darting down alleys as though I’m re-
trieving things hidden down them, and
so forth: hopefully they’ll try to search
them all.”
“Good,” Groot said, returning the
pitch of his speech to normal. “As far
as I know, Dooglas doesn’t have par-
ticularly close ties to any gods, or at
least he didn’t. Let’s presume for the
moment that he has fallen in with
someone new, either under his own
power or because he’s been recruited.”
“If Meester Dooglas has been re-
cruited, that would imply that this
unknown one’s agenda would be the
prime motivator here,” Julio mused.
“This would hold even if Meester Doo-

glas was the one to shape the precise
form of this stratagem.”
“Yes,” said Groot. “Even though it is
so blatant, it would be just like Dooglas
to have me thrown gratuitously in jail
for the sheer annoyance, especially if
he thought he could get away with it.”
The best way to accomplish that would
be to have backers of unimpeachable
deterrent value.
If you looked at it
from one school of thought, the most
elegant thing to do would be to strike
directly at whomever this backer was
and ignore any middlemen.
On the
other hand, a different school might
stress the indirect approach, moving
ﬁrst against pawns in a menacing pat-
tern, undermining the kingpin, and
then abruptly pulling the rug out from
under the central ﬁgures with a neat
ﬂourish.
Schools aside, though, the
reality of the situation was that Groot

had to think of himself ﬁrst and fore-
most as in a state of “check.”
“When your king is in check and
your king happens to be yourself.”
Groot commented, “the most appro-
priate thing is to get yourself out of
that position, and try to pick up el-
egance by inserting an appropriate
countermenace as part of the move.”
“As you say, sir,” said Julio, long ac-
customed to apparent non sequiturs
from Meester Groot. Groot had a ten-
dency to think things through rapidly
in his mind, revealing by his subse-
quent words that he had reappeared in
an entirely different spot, with no obvi-
ous clue to the route he had taken be-
tween points A and B. Things usually
made sense eventually, though, and
Julio knew well enough how Groot’s
thought processes operated to make
the jumps with him more often than

not. Even when he didn’t, it was best
to keep Groot guessing.
Julio’s voice
was low again.
“They will be expect-
ing you to try something, no matter
how effectively they think you’ve been
neutralized. With the remark you said
the banker delivered about your rep-
utation for action, perhaps they are
expecting you to try to escape.”
“Thus rendering me a free fugitive
instead of a caged potential martyr,”
said Groot.
His voice was loud, and
seemed to carry deliberately.
“Never-
theless, freedom is freedom, and I’ve
never been fond of dungeons. You said
Sy hasn’t popped up yet?”
“No, indeed he has not.” Julio, with a
raised eyebrow, was matching Groot’s
vocal projection. “You know I’ve never
entirely trusted him.”
“There’s nothing to be done about it
now,” Groot said, “except try to ﬁnd out

what role he’s played.
I doubt there
is even much left for us to do in the
way of damage control, wouldn’t you
say? What’s done is done. You’re right,
though - we must look to the future.
What about that barbarian fellow?
Now that he’s back on his feet I have
something for him to do.
Before the
barbarian, though, the ﬁrst thing you
do is hunt up a chemist.”

Chapter7
THE SCENIC
ROUTE
“HAVEN’T SPENT MUCH TIME ON
A HORSE, HAVE YOU?”
“Urr,” growled Jurtan Mont.
Max
had been acting disgustingly chipper
ever since they’d left Roosing Oolvaya.
Jurtan couldn’t believe Max was actu-
ally that much more comfortable than

he was, except for obviously knowing
his way around horses. Of course, the
way Jurtan had been feeling, that mere
difference alone could amount to quite
a lot.
“Look at it this way,” Max said.
The small farming community they’d
passed through earlier in the morning
had ﬁnally slipped back into the gentle
hills behind them, and they had now
traveled beyond the range of cultivated
ﬁelds. Prairie grasses that reached in
places higher than their shoulders sur-
rounded them on all sides but the rear,
where their passage had trampled out
a trail. Long slow waves rippled across
the surface in the small breeze.
“Be-
ing saddle-sore is commonplace.
Any
out-of-shape body’s going to feel like
it’s lost a ﬁght with a determined ele-
phant after sitting on a horse all day,
at least for the ﬁrst half-a-week or so.

You did want to show you’re an indi-
vidual, didn’t you?
Well, concentrate
on rising above your body, think about
what makes you different.”
“I wish you wouldn’t gloat,” Jurtan
muttered.
“Who’s gloating? I’m trying to help
you be philosophical.”
“You sound like my father.”
“Really?”
Max
said
thoughtfully.
“Maybe that means I’m doing this
right.”
“Urr,” Jurtan said again. All they’d
been doing for days was plod across the
countryside.
Oh, all right, they had
had a few moments of activity that had
started to look more interesting, but
none of them had lasted. Before leav-
ing Roosing Oolvaya, they’d checked
out the haunts of the guy with no real
name, the Creeping Sword. Max had
sniffed around the Sword’s ofﬁce wav-

ing his hands in strange patterns and
mumbling to himself; he’d said he was
running tests.
“Something went on
here,” he’d stated ﬁnally. “There’re still
emanations leaking back off the walls.”
“What,” Jurtan had asked, “like a
duel? Did he get himself blasted?”
Max scrutinized a patch of plaster
near the door. “Whatever it was didn’t
escalate that far. I think.”
Oh, don’t you know?
Jurtan had
thought. You’re supposed to be such a
big hotshot. He didn’t say this aloud,
though.
“I’m sure he wasn’t pulverized,” Max
went on; Jurtan thought he might have
been thinking out loud. “Even getting
ground into dust always leaves some
residue.” Max’s nose twitched and his
eyes lost their focus. “Why was he tan-
gling with god-level stuff?
How’d he
hold it off?”

“Maybe he just talked his way out of
it.”
“Yeah,” said Max. “Maybe.” And that
had been the last he’d said on the sub-
ject.
The next event that had been margina
more stimulating than bouncing up
and down out of synchrony with his
horse had come the ﬁrst night out,
when they were camped out under a
tree set off by a ditch from the side of
the road. Max had proposed to put Ju-
rtan through some paces with a rapier
but Jurtan was already feeling too bent
out of alignment - between the bruises,
the ﬂayed-raw patches, and the mus-
cles going stiff as iron torture rods -
to do more than lie ﬂat on the ground
on his back. At that point Jurtan had
had no idea of the stretching-out rou-
tine Max was going to inﬂict on him
ﬁrst thing in the morning, every morn-

ing, in the cold dim glow before a hint
of sunrise.
It clearly wouldn’t have
helped if Jurtan had known, he real-
ized, since he was in no shape either
to sneak away from Max or to resist
him while he was around.
If he had
known what to expect in the morning
he might have forced himself to go to
sleep faster so as not to lose out on
his rest from both ends; another thing
he had yet to appreciate at that time
was that “morning” for Max always
meant the predawn gloom, at least
while he was on the road. On balance,
though, Jurtan was happy he hadn’t
understood any of this that ﬁrst night.
It wasn’t that he thought the state of
ignorance was desirable.
Rather, if
he had nodded off promptly he would
have missed Max’s activity when he
thought Jurtan had been asleep.
Jurtan had been resting there, his

eyes closed, listening to the insects har-
monize with the constant background
accompaniment of the sourceless music
in his head. Ever since Jurtan had dis-
covered that he could actually channel
the music, sometimes, through teeth-
clenching concentration, he had been
working to increase his control. There
was no question that the frequency of
his contrapuntal seizures had been de-
clining as a result. Now, he often could
react without even being fully aware
of it, almost as a reﬂex, and before
he had felt more than a slight fuzzi-
ness around the corners of his vision or
a distant roar in his ears; he hadn’t
totally
lost
consciousness
or
fallen
over on his face in at least two weeks.
The steady clip-clopping rhythm of his
horse alone would have once kept him
in a perpetual stupor. Jurtan had also
gotten better at pushing the music

into the background where it wouldn’t
overwhelm his thoughts on a constant
basis, the way it had done for his en-
tire life up until the past few weeks.
Still, when the music wanted to draw
his attention to something, it wasn’t
shy about making itself felt. As Jurtan
rested under the tree and the stars, do-
ing a much better imitation ‘of a stone
sarcophagus than of a limber human,
he thought afterward he might even
have been dozing, when a slyly insis-
tent clatter of castanets brought his
eyes open.
In the light of the big moon he could
see the horses napping on their feet
in the same places they’d occupied
when he’d settled down. Max’s bedroll,
though, was empty. Jurtan raised his
head. There, in the line of trees over
by the stream . . .
but who was Max
talking to? All he could see were two

vague silhouettes outlined against the
moonlit shimmer of the birches. Well,
it was none of his business.
Or was it? If Max was plotting with
somebody to get them both in danger
– more danger - that concerned Jur-
tan, sure enough. He creaked his way
off the ground up into a crouch and
headed for the stream.
An attitude
of care and stealth, Jurtan thought,
as grass and shrubbery crunched be-
neath his feet, that’s the ticket.
As
he got closer, he realized that Max’s
companion had a slight internal glow,
a sort of will-o’-the-wisp effect, and
that through the ﬁgure’s body he could
vaguely see the birch behind him. The
low babble of their voices was barely
distinguishable from that of the brook.
Gradually, though, Jurtan began to
make out more than just a combina-
tion of liquid murmurs.

“ ... about Shaa?”
“I’ve been thinking about trying to
slide something past the Curse Admin-
istrator,” Max said. “Try to get it an-
nulled or superseded or even just lost
in the paperwork cycle.”
“Tricky,” said the other form. “Not to
mention chancy. I wouldn’t, if it were
me. Jardin has ... more active.
You
may want to wait until we can better
see what he’s up to.”
“ . . . “
Any closer and Jurtan knew Max
would hear him.
He had the feeling
Max and the other were starting to
wrap up anyway.
Jurtan eased gin-
gerly back toward the campsite, trying
to keep from casting too many glances
over his shoulder in the direction of
the stream. Just short of his bedroll,
he checked behind him again. The sec-
ond ﬁgure was gone - he’d had a quick

impression of something like a sheet
shaking itself out where the other had
been, but it must have been his imagi-
nation; there was clearly nothing there
but rocks and trees.
Max had said nothing the next day
to indicate he realized Jurtan had
been eavesdropping, but still Jurtan
wondered. Jurtan had learned enough
from Shaa not to want to be caught
underestimating Max.
If Max knew,
though, why wasn’t he accusing him?
Maybe he didn’t care.
Or perhaps
he didn’t want to risk giving Jurtan
enough leverage to get him to reveal
who the other one had been, and what
the two of them had been discussing,
by pulling the issue out into the open.
Jurtan had tried to ﬁle it away and
forget it.
The only other episode of note had
come the night after that.
Max had

been interrogating Jurtan about the
symptoms of his music disorder.
Ju-
rtan had been through most of this
already with Shaa and he’d said as
much.
“Since it’s my problem at the
moment, not Shaa’s,” Max had told
him, “I want to know I have the facts
straight.”
“It’s my problem, too, and it’s going
to stay my problem whether you or
Shaa are around or not.” Jurtan had
gotten testier as the day went on and
his blisters had continued to break. In
the middle of the afternoon he’d also
been stung by a bee. Considering the
state he was in, he didn’t really care
at that moment what nasty thing Max
would say back at him.
Not for the ﬁrst time, Max took him
by surprise. He had one eye closed and
was looking up into the air with the
other one while he chewed on the cor-

ner of his lower lip. “Why didn’t I think
of this before?” he announced.
“Think of what?” Jurtan said ner-
vously.
“Hold still.” Max sank down next to
him and placed the outspread ﬁngers
of his left hand over Jurtan’s forehead,
the thumb in front of his ear and the
middle ﬁnger at the crown of his head.
Something
crackled
between
Max’s
ﬁngertips and Jurtan’s skin.
“Don ‘t
move! Are you hearing music now?”
“Uh, yes.” At the top of his vision,
green curlicues were dancing. “Are you,
uh, trying to read my mind?”
“Close your eyes. That’s better. No,
full telepathy’s a pretty heavy deal; not
my specialty either. Gotta match the
impedances - huh!”
“What?”
“Can you make it louder?
Yeah!
-
like a clarinet on top of a bunch of

brass, is that what you’re hearing?”
“You mean you can hear it, too?”
“That’s not bad,” Max said apprais-
ingly. “You could dance to that.”
Jurtan jerked his head back. With
a snap-snaps-snap and a peppering
of small shocks Max lost his contact.
“Ow!” said Jurtan, rubbing his fore-
head. “You going to tell me what you
were doing there?”
Max scowled at him. He was shak-
ing his hand as though he’d just pulled
it back from a hot oven.
“An exper-
iment, what did you think?
It was
getting somewhere, too, until you rup-
tured the interface.”
“Where was it getting?
Into my
thoughts?”
“I already said this wasn’t telepathy,
didn’t I? No, I was just trying to listen
in.”
“On my thoughts!”

Max snorted. “No, not your thoughts,
that’s what I keep trying to tell you,
not that I’m sure they’re anything to
write home about anyway. I don’t know
what the hell is going on in that head
of yours, but I’ve never heard of any-
thing like it before. I don’t think any-
one could read your mind if they were
channeling the power of a volcano. All
they’d hear is that music.”
The sound of slurping cut through
Jurtan’s musings on the recent past.
He looked down. The earth the horse
was stepping into was moist; it placed
its hoof again and water oozed out over
it as though the beast had stamped on
a sponge. “Max?” Jurtan said.
Jurtan had noted that the plain had
been trending generally downward as
they rode west and, Max had said,
rather south. Now, Max had reined up
in front of him ahead of a tongue of

shallow, stagnant water broken with
clumps of protruding grass and low
mounds of earth. The grass had turned
as much yellow as green in color; over-
all an unhealthy-looking tone.
Jur-
tan had an uncomfortable feeling the
stalks might glow in the dark, too. A
smell of decayed vegetables tickled the
air. And there were bugs. Max swung
himself off the horse and strolled to-
ward the edge of the water, stretching
his back, his feet making squelching
sounds in the soggy earth, gazing off
across the water where a maze of slug-
gish channels began.
“There,” said
Max.
“There, what?” said Mont.
“We’re
looking at a swamp,
that’s what’s
there.”
“I think it’s more of a bog,” Max said,
eyeing the terrain in a professional
manner, “although you might go so far

as to call it a marsh.”
“What does it matter what you call
it? It’s wet, isn’t it, and the parts that
aren’t totally wet are spongy.” An un-
pleasant thought had seized him. “You
don’t really plan to go in there, do you?”
“Why do think we went out of our
way to be here in the ﬁrst place? Some-
where in there may be something we’ve
come to ﬁnd.”
Find? “I thought we were going to
Peridol for the Knitting, I didn’t think
we were out to ‘ﬁnd’ anything.”
“Shows what you know, doesn’t it?”
said Max.
He had been probing the
ground with the toe of his boot. Now,
ﬁnding the surface of a low ridge that
extended some way out into the water
to be marginally more solid than the
muck as a whole, he took ﬁrst one and
then another tentative step out along
it, his horse reluctantly following. On

his third step, the sole of his foot con-
tinued down through the surface. Mud
sloshed over the top of his boot.
“That’s disgusting,” Jurtan said.
“Of course it’s disgusting.
It’s a
swamp.”
Mont had to admit that Max didn’t
look terribly pleased, either, by the
prospect of sloshing through the ooze.
“If you’re so dead-set on going in there,
why not use a boat?
Why not use
magic?
For all we know, this stuff
could go all the way to the coast.”
“For all you know,” Max muttered.
“As far as I know, it’s not that far. If
this was regular ground, we’d be across
it in a day.”
“Have you been here before?”
“I had a reliable informant; at least
I hope he was. You want to use a boat,
go ahead, ﬁnd a boat.”
“We could build a raft.”

“I’d love to build a raft.
You want
to tell me where you’re going to ﬁnd
wood?”
Mont looked around.
The gentle
rolling plain they’d followed to the
edge of the swamp had been covered
only with waving wild grain and the oc-
casional low shrub. They’d seen a few
stands of trees, true, but the last one
had been an hour’s ride back, and noth-
ing came to sight now as he scanned
the horizon.
He turned back to the
water, eyed the mud with a resigned
glance, ﬂopped off his own horse, and
stepped after Max. Then Jurtan real-
ized he was wrong. There were some
trees in sight, twisted gnarly things
though they were. The problem with
them was that they were deeper into
the swamp.
Well, it might be better
than nothing; they weren’t that much
deeper. “What about those trees?” he

said.
“Could we make a raft out of
them?”
“Which trees? The ones we’re head-
ing toward?”
“Oh,” said Mont. “You mean you’ve
been planning all along to check out
those trees and maybe use them to
build a raft, only you wanted to be sure
to rub in again how dumb I am not to
have understood it, right?”
“Now, would I do something like
that?” Max said distractedly.
“Well, okay, but what about magic,
then?
Is that what I’m really sup-
posed to ask?
I know you said it’s
usually more efﬁcient to rely on phys-
ical means, but if it’s not that large a
swamp anyway -”
A large bubble burst on the surface
of the water to Jurtan’s left, releasing
the rank smell of spoiled eggs. Jurtan’s
horse knocked him in the back with its

head. Jurtan wished he knew how to
tell the horse how much he agreed with
its assessment. Max had paused just
ahead and was looking around with
an appraising manner. He sniffed the
air. Jurtan had seen him do this before,
usually when there wasn’t anything
worth smelling that he’d been able to
detect, and so he had the general idea
that what Max was trying to sense was
not necessarily a physical aroma.
Max
looked
around
again,
then
spoke in a low voice. “I’ve got reason
to believe magic won’t work right in
this area, and even if it did it probably
wouldn’t be a good idea to try. If the
reports I heard are right, a guy named
Iskendarian used to work here.”
“In a swamp?”
“He built the swamp. He was a very
clever fellow, very clever indeed.”
“‘Was’? Is he dead?”

“That’s what they say.
He hasn’t
been around in a half-century or more,
at least not so anyone’s been able
to ﬁnd him, and he’d probably be a
hundred-ﬁfty or two hundred years
old by now anyway. Still, most likely
it’s not a relevant question. For a sor-
cerer like Iskendarian, death can be a
matter of degree.”
“You can be sort of dead?”
Max turned and again began gin-
gerly picking his way deeper into the
swamp.
“Let’s just say there’s a con-
tinuum between sleep and total loss-
of-consciousness death. Even if he is
absolutely dead, I may still be able to
get some information out of him.
If
he’s even here.”
“This sure isn’t a place I’d want to
be dead in,” Mont muttered, pulling
one foot free of a particularly cling-
ing patch of ooze with a mushy slurp.

“What’s this Iskendarian guy have that
you want, anyway?”
“Knowledge,” Max said. “Maybe an-
swers. That spell of Namelessness the
Sword’s wearing, for one.”
“You’re not thinking this Iskendar-
ian himself cast the spell on the Sword,
are you? Could Iskendarian cast spells
while he’s dead?
Is death that rela-
tive?”
Max grimaced.
“I don’t know, but
I think it might be better if I did,
don’t you? The Sword’s Spell has cer-
tain hallmarks of Iskendarian’s style.
There’s actually another question I’d
be even more interested in getting an
answer to. If Iskendarian did have any-
thing to do with this spell - a prospect
I seriously doubt, mind you, but it’s
always worthwhile to keep an open
mind - well, the question is why would
he bother?
When you’re dead, you

don’t get out much.
How would he
have even met the Sword?
Nobody’s
seen Iskendarian for longer than the
Sword’s been alive.”
“You don’t know where the Sword
came from,” said Mont. “How do you
know how old he really is?”
Max stopped, both legs submerged
to mid-hip in the midst of a pair of
widening ripples, and looked thought-
fully over his shoulder at Mont, one
eyebrow raised. Then he nodded once,
slowly, his lips screwed up on one side
in absent concentration.
“Neverthe-
less.” Max said, “Iskendarian probably
doesn’t have anything to do with it.
Someone may have gotten hold of his
notes, though, or if he was hard up
enough he might have actually taught
somebody the technique.
Even if the
spell’s got nothing to do with Iskendar-
ian, his own formula might suggest a

generic mechanism that could be used
to undo it. And anyway I was planning
to stop off here sometime regardless of
the Namelessness thing. Iskendarian
planted a reasonable portion of the
foundations of modern magic; by all
accounts, he is - or was - a remark-
ably tricky guy, so there may very well
be something around worth learning
from.
And as long we were headed
in the right direction ...” He shrugged
and turned back to the slow strug-
gle toward the gradually approaching
trees.
Jurtan looked at the swamp, his
mind picking out rough chords for him
on what sounded like a banjo. He had
heard from Shaa that ruins and pre-
Dislocation rumors drew Max like a
dehydrated sponge drew water. Jurtan
had held out what he had suspected
was the forlorn hope that he wouldn’t

have to get too much direct knowledge
of Max’s peculiarities through personal
experience.
Shaa - suddenly Jurtan
put together something Max hadn’t
exactly come right out and said in
words. Max had implied that Iskendar-
ian might be a master of longevity or
even rejuvenation; that would have
been the most natural way for him to
be walking around causing trouble at
an age approaching two hundred. And
Shaa was certainly in need of some
signiﬁcant rejuvenation of his own.
Behind Jurtan, his horse was mut-
tering again. “Is it a good idea to be
taking horses into this stuff?” Jurtan
asked. “Mine doesn’t seem to like it.”
“It’s not great,” agreed Max. “Unfor-
tunately, we don’t have much choice.
We should end up coming out on the
other side, for one thing, and for an-
other if we left them here we’d never

see them again.”
“But if they sink out of sight into
this stuff, we’ll never see them again
either.”
“That’s true enough.
What would
you do?”
Jurtan looked back at his horse. It
was mucking along, probably moping a
bit, but aside from the occasional snort
it wasn’t breathing particularly hard.
One brown eye caught his with a dis-
gruntled expression. The horse wasn’t
quite fed up yet, though. “How about
this,” Jurtan suggested. “We make it to
the trees. If we can get a good enough
raft out of them, we try to take the
horses with us. If we can’t, we let them
decide. It looks like they’re game if we
are.”
Max took another step and disap-
peared beneath the surface. After a mo-
ment he thrashed back into sight, his

hair drooping over his head as though
he’d acquired a drowned muskrat for
a toupee.
He spit out a mouthful of
water. “Game,” he said. “Right. Some
game.”
They sloshed and ﬂoundered their
way ahead, the trees beckoning them
on. Max reached the grove ﬁrst, hav-
ing gained even more ground on Jur-
tan, who had been wasting a lot of his
energy swinging at mosquitoes, and
climbed out onto a low hillock barely
awash with water. “Huh,” said Max.
“What is it?
Is there something
wrong with the trees?”
“Forget the trees,” Max said.
His
horse followed him onto the mound and
in among the scrubby trunks, and then
the two of them began to drop down
out of sight. Jurtan thrashed forward
more vigorously and ﬁnally struggled
out onto the ridge himself. The addi-

tional height let him see over the front
side of the hillock and its marsh grass
and down onto a clear-water channel
a short distance back, where Max was
examining a ﬂat barge-like boat.
A
mostly decayed net of woven reeds had
been thrown back onto the bank.
“It
looks old,” said Max, “but solid.”
“Whose do you think it is?”
“I wouldn’t be surprised if it was the
man’s himself; Iskendarian’s.
At the
moment, though, I’d say it’s ours.”
No one else arrived to question that
presumption. After Max had checked
the boat for traps and judged it clean,
they managed to coax the horses on
board by having them step straight off
the bank.
Although the boat rocked
alarmingly and shipped water over its
low gunwales, it showed no serious
signs of becoming unbalanced.
The
attitude of the horses was not remark-

ably improved by the move from muck
to boat. Once they were tied down and
the boat had stopped lurching from
side to side, however, their nervous
whickering began to quiet.
The boat was really more of a raft
with what amounted to a small fence
around its outside edge. With the four
of them on board it proved crowded. It
had gotten them out of the bottom ooze,
though, and when Max and Jurtan set
to work with the poles they had found
lashed to the deck, they discovered a
similar improvement in their speed
compared to slurping through the goop.
A maze of sluggish channels among
the twisted trees led them further into
the swamp.
Around the middle of the afternoon,
they negotiated another hairpin turn
in the channel, got hung up for a mo-
ment in the roots of one of the tentac-

ular mangroves, as Max had taken to
calling them, and then emerged into
an area of relatively open water. The
swamp grasses were the thickest here
that they’d yet encountered, the height
of their stalks rising toward the center
of the lagoon until they were at least as
tall as the tops of the mangroves. Max
poled the raft toward the spot where
the grass seemed most luxuriant. The
grass bent reluctantly before them,
occasionally lashing back with a small
slap. Their sight of the landscape, such
as it was, quickly faded and was lost
behind the ascending wall of weeds.
Several vessel lengths farther along,
though, the bottom of the barge grated
along a concealed obstacle and then
ground to a complete halt, the bow
canted slightly upward.
The grasses had not after all mu-
tated to ascend to gigantic heights but

were planted on a low island, its sur-
face barely out of the water. “This looks
like the place.” Max said.
“There’s no castle here,” said Mont.
“There’s not even a hut.”
“I’ll grant you it is a little surpris-
ing not to ﬁnd anything,” Max mused.
“Maybe there is something here that
we’re not seeing.
It could have de-
cayed, I suppose, or gotten blown away.
Or maybe there was something here,
but it’s moved.” He looked suddenly
thoughtful.
“You mean, like Karlini’s castle? Or
do you think this is where Karlini’s cas-
tle actually came from?”
Max continued looking around and
peering over the top of the grass line,
now brought closer to his own tiptoe
height since he was standing on the is-
land. “No, I don’t, actually, but it’s an
interesting possibility.”

A more practical consideration abrupt
suggested itself to Jurtan. “It’s going
to be getting dark pretty soon. Are we
gonna spend the night here?”
“Do you have a better suggestion?”
“I knew you were going to say some-
thing like that.” Jurtan said with resig-
nation. “Should we let the horses out?”
They let the horses out.
As the
horses tried snacking on the marsh
grass,
dubious
expressions
promi-
nently displayed,
Max and Jurtan
spread out to examine the small is-
land, Jurtan heading for its center. He
was heartily sick of stepping into muck
and goo and so was keeping his eyes
primarily on his feet and the ground
around them. Still, there were enough
of the tall plants around interfering
with his view that at ﬁrst he didn’t re-
alize what he had walked onto when he
felt something crunch beneath his foot.

He bent down to inspect the ground. A
small beaked skull extended just be-
yond the toe of his boot, and the bones
of a foot-long wing were outspread on
either side of his heel. “Max,” he said.
On his way back over toward Mont’s
position from the far side of the island,
Max turned up half-a-dozen birds of
his own in various states of disrepair.
Jurtan had found a few more him-
self.
“Why only birds?” he said.
“If
there’s something around here that’s
poisonous or something, why does it
only affect birds?”
“Maybe something drives ground-
huggers away that birds are too dumb
to notice.” Max said. “What about you?
Is that music of yours giving you any
hints?”
Jurtan’s ears had been treating him
to an increasingly expectant blare of
horns underlined by a rapid-paced

marching beat from a kettle drum. “It
thinks this place is –” what was that
phrase Shaa liked to use? “- a location
of interest, all right.”
The sun took that moment to ease be-
low the horizon and the sudden gloom
leapt out at them. “What’s that other
squeaking sound?” Jurtan asked. “Real
high-pitched and faint?”
“I can’t hear it myself,” said Max, “be-
cause at my advancing age my hearing
doesn’t go that high any more, but I’d
suspect it’s bats. You catch that other
noise, like a few sheets of dry old pa-
per ﬂapping? Bat wings. I’m surprised
you can hear them squeaking over the
gurgling of this swamp.”
The sky overhead was still reason-
ably bright.
Max looked up into it
with suddenly narrowed eyes, at the
increasing clouds of bats swooping and
twirling after the mosquitoes.
About

time something showed up to take care
of the bugs, too.
He thought again
about the birds.
Some of those dead
birds had broken skulls, as though
they’d ﬂown headﬁrst into something
they couldn’t see. But bats ...
“Why are they doing that?” Mont
said. “The bats. I can see them kind of
ﬂopping by overhead there, but there’s
sort of a round place where they don’t
seem to go, right over the middle of the
island.”
The sky and the ﬁrst few stars shone
clearly through the area the bats were
avoiding, but avoiding it they were.
“The birds can’t see it, but the bats
can,” Max said, gazing up with a grin.
“That’s our spot, up there.” That was
whatever they had come for, suspended
in the air and concealed inside a refrac-
tion zone.

Chapter8
NEWS ON THE
RIVER
“NOTHING NEW, EH?”
The Great Karlini looked up from
the reference book perched open on
his lap.
Above the book and a com-
fortable distance in front of his face,
in his favorite individual work-space,
sat a three-dimensional matrix of col-

ored crystalline beads, all in shades
of green and blue. “Not a thing,” said
Karlini. “Did you bring that sandwich
you mentioned?”
“I did indeed,” Shaa replied, produc-
ing the snack from behind his back and
uncovering it on its plate with a ﬂour-
ish of napkin. “I brought more tea, too,”
he added, moving the plate to reveal
the small pitcher on which it had been
balanced as well.
Karlini, still eyeing his work, picked
up a neatly sliced sandwich half and
took a bite. Then he pulled the sand-
wich away from his face and stared at
it warily. “What is in this thing?”
“The main framework,
I believe,
is one of those onion-wheat rolls we
took on in Roosing Oolvaya,” Shaa
said, poking at the remaining half
with his ﬁnger. “The two principal in-
ternal constituent components are the

river anchovies, fresh, and the chopped
tomato-and-lettuce mixture, although
I did take the liberty of adding some of
that mashed egg-white batter stuff you
like. Also, a lengthwise-sliced pickle.”
“Mayonnaise,” Karlini said, taking
another tentative bite.
“That what
Max said it’s called.
He found the
recipe in some old scrap he was trans-
lating; turned out to be a cookbook
or some kind of wrapper for a food
container, I think, instead of an in-
struction manual. You’re sure there’s
nothing ﬁshy beside the anchovies?”
“Reasonably certain,” said Shaa. He
went so far as to ease the top of the roll
back to reinspect the contents. “Why,
don’t you like it?”
“What’s not to like?
I just wanted
to make sure nothing got transubstan-
tiated on your way down from the
kitchen.”

“It does pay to be prudent,” Shaa
agreed.
“Were you expecting some-
thing of the sort?
In my experience,
ﬁsh have much less of a tendency to
mutate once they’ve landed on a plate.”
“We’ve already had one water-related
manifestation,” Karlini remarked in
the midst of a munch.
“I thought it
would be a good idea to keep a weather
eye peeled for any more, don’t you
think?”
“I take it, then, that you’re speaking
from intuition and not because you’ve
actually come up with something?”
Karlini took a swig of iced tea. “Is
it my imagination or has your mood
perked up?”
“I’m always happiest when some
force I don’t know is trying to demolish
me.”
“We still don’t know for sure that
anything’s really happening,” Karlini

said cautiously.
“An omen, then,” said Shaa. “An am-
biguous omen, if you’d rather. A sign
is still a sign; whichever way you slice
it, it isn’t every day the lower stretch
of the River Oolvaan decides to throw
icebergs at you. You haven’t detected a
hand behind it, then? Or The Hand, I
suppose, for that matter?”
“No hands, no arms, no appendages
of any sort.”
“Well, that is what we expected,” re-
ﬂected Shaa.
“Any further thoughts
about just mooring in the river and
sending a scout down ahead in the
skiff, or even overland?”
“Still sounds like overkill to me.”
“Hmm,” Shaa said. “I agree. Among
the lot of us there shouldn’t be much
we can’t handle.
However, one does
like to stack the deck.”
“It probably wasn’t an omen at all,”

Karlini reasoned,
“and it probably
wasn’t an attack either, and even if
it was it probably wasn’t directed at
us.”
“It certainly seemed like an attack
at the time.
What are you trying to
do, spoil all the fun? As much fun as
one can get from anticipating calamity,
that is.”
“You are in a good mood, aren’t you.”
“I’m always in a good mood,” Shaa
stated.
“My family is known for our
equal temperament. Since you haven’t
found
out
anything
about
the
ice-
apparition itself,
I presume you’ve
been gathering intelligence about do-
ings in Oolsmouth?
It would appear
prudent to do that, at least, as long as
the intelligence collection has a justiﬁ-
ably parsimonious overhead of its own.
Judicious employment of that aerial
surveillance probe of yours, perhaps?”

Karlini squinted at Shaa across the
top of the remaining section of sand-
wich, a protruding anchovy drooping
tail-ﬁrst down past his cheek.
“You
haven’t been peeking in at me from the
hall, have you?”
With a theatrical ﬂourish,
Shaa
shielded his eyes with one hand. “By
your answer, I take it that you have, in
fact, been operating said probe in the
vicinity of Oolsmouth.
I will further
predict that you found things to be per-
fectly normal.
Shall I proceed to my
next feat?”
“No,” Karlini said sourly, “that one’s
quite enough, thank you.
Why did I
even bother to take the time in the ﬁrst
place if you already knew what I was
going to ﬁnd?”
“Well, it is axiomatic that aerial re-
connaissance is most useful after a
natural disaster, or from our point of

view an unnatural one, or when one
happens to be looking for an army lost
somewhere in the woods, say. It takes
a lot to disrupt the normal functioning
of a city to the degree where it’s visible
from the air. On the other hand, get-
ting down to the person-to-person level
is tedious and time-consuming, chews
up energy, and leaves one open to coun-
terforce retaliation by anti-scrutiny
countermeasure shields. You are good
at this, I know, and you’ve spent a
lot of time and effort advancing your
methods as well, so don’t feel I’m being
critical; not in the least.
The world
just imposes certain constraints.
As
you know perfectly well.
You knew
as fully as I what your effort would
probably yield.”
“Yes,” said Karlini, “well. I tried to
locate Groot, but he’s not to be found.
His house and warehouses are locked

up, and under guard, too.
And be-
fore you start to pester me again, yes, I
checked the prisons, but they’re search-
screened as a matter of routine, so, all
right, yes, I was just being thorough.”
“Isn’t there some way of getting hold
of Groot or his people directly?” Shaa
said, looking thoughtfully at the beams
of the low ceiling.
“Doesn’t he have
some kind of magician on his staff?”
“I think he does. In fact, I know he
does. One of the usual mercantile spe-
cialists keeps in touch with his trad-
ing parties and ships and all those far-
ﬂung kind of things.”
“Ships?”
They adjourned from Karlini’s work-
room, which also served as a sail-
locker, and proceeded toward the bridge
While they were making their way
across the main deck through the maze
of lashed-down trade goods, Tildamire

suddenly appeared from behind the
mainmast, an exercise book in hand.
“Hi,” she said. “You guys come up with
anything good yet?”
“Are you deliberately dogging my
steps,” Shaa grumbled, “or is this con-
stant serendipity the pure result of
a malign fate?” He held up his hand.
“No, don’t tell me; mystery is an endan-
gered resource as it is.
Dog away, if
you must.”
Not that she needs encouragement,
thought Shaa.
Perhaps if he threat-
ened to deliver a lecture she would
go away.
“We are hoping to contact
Groot’s communications mediator,” he
added.
“That sounds interesting,” Tildy said
cautiously.
“Actually, it’s not,” said Shaa. “Com-
munications mediator is a fairly te-
dious job and not without its wearing

aspects, since many things can inter-
fere with messages and focusing them
becomes much harder the farther they
have to go; the usual radiative inverse-
square
laws
apply
here.”
Ostenta-
tiously pedantic, he began to count
off his points on his ﬁngers. “Like most
other spell-work, the throughput is low
because you usually need to rest up
for awhile after arbitrating signiﬁcant
message trafﬁc. It’s a specialized skill
requiring a lot of higher math. There’s
also the problem of contacting the com-
municator, since his or her expertise is
designed around contacting you; out-
going requires different protocols than
incoming.You see? Not ﬂashy at all.”
Karlini preceded them up onto the
quarterdeck, where the captain was
staring with a sage seaman’s expres-
sion down the river ahead of the ship.
River trafﬁc had been picking up over

the past few hours, indicating (if any
of them were in doubt) that they were
fast approaching the Oolsmouth dis-
trict. “A key?” the captain said, echoing
Karlini’s question. “Aye, a key I’ve got,
and a key I’ve been using, too. Waste
of time it’s been.
Gazoont, that’s his
name, Meester Groot’s facilitator; not
a clever sort like your lot, don’t you
know, but he’s been regular enough in
the past.”
Karlini exchanged a “hmm” with
Shaa. Tildamire appeared on the verge
of joining them, but after a glance at
Shaa she thought better of it.
“We
could give Gazoont the beneﬁt of the
doubt and say he’s on vacation,” sug-
gested Karlini.
“Too much coincidence,” Shaa said to
Tildy. “Far too much.”
“I’m inclined to agree with you, Dr.
Shaa,” the captain stated.
“I don’t

know whether this Gazoont fellow is
dead,
or whether he’s left Meester
Groot’s service, or what-all else might
be afoot -”
“Communications could be jammed
at the source,” Karlini said dubiously,
“although I didn’t pick up the kind of
hash in the carrier medium you expect
with that.”
“Next you’ll be talking about atmo-
spheric conditions being inconclusive,”
said Shaa.
“Which is to say, it’s all
smoke.
The important fact is that
Gazoont is not answering. I ﬁnd that
unhappily suggestive.
I would treat
it as a priority to get some hard news
about what is awaiting us up ahead.”
“Perhaps you don’t have long to
wait,” said the captain.
He gestured
with his pipe, pointing the stem out be-
yond the port bow. A barge was ﬂoating
upriver toward them, taking advan-

tage through its sail of the breeze at
its back. “Outbound from Oolsmouth
within the last day,” he added. “She’ll
come within hailing distance in a mo-
ment.”
“What was that key stuff you were
talking about?” Tildy asked Shaa in a
low voice.
Shaa crossed his arms and leaned
on the rail guarding the drop from
bridge to main deck.
“If you need to
contact a communicator, you generally
have to have their address, which is
to say their aura recognition pattern.
The communicator can publish this ad-
dress by imprinting it on some small
object, the ‘key,’ which for the sake of
convenience is usually a token of some
sort.
Creation of a usable key isn’t
easy,
so a particular communicator
usually doesn’t produce too many of
them. They can be fairly dangerous in

the wrong hands, too, since releasing
a key detailed enough for someone to
contact you with can also let a properly
trained person locate you in return,
or even mount his own attack; this is
another reason that not too many folks
become communicators. Captain, does
Oolsmouth have a public communica-
tor that you know of?”
The captain cocked his head to one
side, while still watching the approach
of the barge. “Might be one at the Hall
of the People, but if I don’t mistake my
own memory she works straight for the
politicians, not free-lance or for hire. I
do have to say I never did trust that
Gazoont fellow. Nothing you could put
your thumb on, mind you, but you’ll be
knowing how it is.”
“Communicators do have guild as-
sociations
to
consider,”
commented
Shaa, “and the endorsement of their

guild requires an upstanding record of
appropriate loyalty and honorable be-
havior, but when it comes right down
to it I suppose they’re as much subject
to bribes or suborning as anyone else.”
Cupping his hands around his mouth,
the captain took aim at the barge
and let loose with tremendous volume.
“Ahoy, Pilodar.’”
A much fainter reply came back.
“Ahoy, Proﬁt!
Have you heard you’re
under new ownership?”
“What was that?
New ownership,
did you say?”
“Aye, most likely!
You’re a ship of
Groot’s, aren’t you?”
“Aye, that we are!”
“Groot’s run hard aground!” said the
man on the Pilodar.
The barge was
now close enough for the captain to
quit ﬂaying his larynx.
Shaa tenta-
tively released the mufﬂing palm he

was holding over his ear.
“On what
shoal’?” called Captain Luff.
“The Powers-that-Be,” the Pilodar
said ominously.
Captain Luff ex-
changed a glance with Karlini and
Shaa.
Shaa shrugged.
“I thought Groot
was one of the powers-that-be,” he
said.
“Aye,” said the captain. He cupped
his hands again. “What more can you
tell us?”
“It be wiser not to be discussing this
at all!”
“Captain Moore, is it? When we’re in
port together, I’ll stand you a round!”
The two captains exchanged pleas-
antries, but soon the ships had begun
to draw apart and there was clearly
nothing to be gained by continuing.
“The Pile-o’-Dough, that’s what she’s
called on the river,” the captain said,

watching the barge retreat.
“The
contrast
between
the
high-
technology of modern sorcery and the
low-tech ways of the world is always re-
markable, don’t you think?” said Shaa.
“On the other hand, hollering back
and forth may be crude, but there’s no
denying it works.”
“Just because I couldn’t ﬁnd out
what was happening is no reason to -”
Karlini began.
“Just so you know,” Shaa told him, “I
am not pleased to ﬁnd my earlier vague
suspicions conﬁrmed.”
“There’s deviltry afoot, sure enough,”
said Captain Luff.
“Aye, there is,” agreed Shaa.
“Per-
haps we should consider bypassing the
Oolsmouth port altogether.”
“Oolsmouth docks and levees control
all passage south to the sea,” the cap-
tain pointed out, “The several channels

of the Oolvaan delta don’t start until
the other side of Oolsmouth.”
“Are there any turnoffs between our
current position and Oolsmouth? Any
side channels?”
“Not a one, Doctor Shaa, not a one.”
“Hmm,” said Shaa. “We could turn
around and return to Roosing Oolvaya,
or anchor in place here and wait for
things to play out in Oolsmouth, or
disembark passengers for an overland
trip. However, all these options would
waste time and,
more signiﬁcantly,
wouldn’t necessarily solve anything.”
“Meester
Groot’s
troubles
could
travel toward us on the river,” the
captain suggested.
“If these Powers-
that-Be decide to send forces after us,
if indeed for some reason someone is
looking for this very ship -” he directed
a hard gaze at Shaa, which Shaa re-
turned with a pleasant and guileless

one of his own “- aye, as I say, a writ
of seizure from Oolsmouth might very
well be honored in Roosing Oolvaya.”
“Or even if it wasn’t we might still
be impounded until things settle them-
selves out,” added Karlini.
“One could consider the old plague-
on-the-ship trick,” Shaa said.
“Do you know,” said the captain, “I
myself have seen plague ships burnt
to the waterline by dock wardens, or
blasted
completely
to
smithereens.
Plague ships, aye, and even one that
had only the rumor of it without the
slightest boil or fever in a single man
jack aboard.
Perhaps the legalities
were
consulted
afterward,
perhaps
not.”
“It may be reasonable to leave that
particular stratagem in reserve for a
later time,” agreed Shaa.
“We could just turn ourselves over,”

the captain said.
“Perhaps Meester
Groot has the wrong of it, and this new
owner Captain Moore spoke of has the
right.”
Shaa raised a skeptical eyebrow,
Karlini resorted to goggling his eyes,
and Tildy dropped her jaw disbeliev-
ingly.
“ ‘Twas only a suggestion,” said the
captain, eyeing them. “I didn’t mean
nothing by it.”
“We thus return by the process of
elimination
to
our
central
course,”
Shaa said, “which is to continue on
in to Oolsmouth, handling problems
as they arise in the manner we have
evolved through long practice.
After
all.
we are at least forewarned, and
forewarned is forearmed, which brings
one halfway to octopod status, not an
unhelpful place to be at all.”
“Yeah,” said Karlini, making a sour

face, “but it sounds like we may have
to face one of the worst menaces in the
civilized world - a bureaucrat armed
with some ofﬁcial document.”
“Ah,” Shaa said mysteriously, “but
we are not without useful documents
of our own. Nor would this be all the
preparation available to us. Come, let
us reason together craftily.

Chapter9
A TINCTURE OF
LIVERWORT
THE POWER OF A STRONG ARM,
Haalsen Groot had always thought, is
less than that of a strong mind. Like
all aphorisms, this one had situations
where it was likely to fail, such as
the one where the strong arm was
facing down the strong mind in close

quarters in the same room, with the
strong mind’s mouth gagged and its
arms lashed behind its back.
Things
are rarely perfect. Nevertheless, in the
past he’d taken the attitude that he’d
rather fail while trying a stratagem
than succeed through a coup de main.
Groot thought it did put things in per-
spective, though, to remember that his
previous philosophy had been adopted
in the abstract, without any foresee-
able expectation of actually having to
test its validity, rather than from the
vantage point of a thick-walled cell in
a jail with his leg chained to the ﬂoor.
Which was not to say that Groot had
a philosophical objection to empirical
methods. He was keeping the candle
on the far side of the cell from him in
case the door began to open suddenly
and he needed to take advantage of
the additional gloom to try to quickly

conceal his work, which meant he was
operating as much by touch as sight; on
the whole, he thought the ﬁnal effect
would be much superior if he wasn’t
interrupted before all the pieces were
in place.
He ﬁnished spreading the
ﬁrst coat of solvent across the face of
the concrete block of variant composi-
tion he had spotted earlier; the newer,
more crumbly one at the junction of
ceiling and outer wall.
Julio’s recon-
naissance and a bit of triangulation
had revealed that Groot’s guess con-
cerning the nature of that particular
block had been more or less correct.
Barred ventilation holes that had been
part of the original construction in
many of the cells had indeed been sub-
sequently blocked off.
As Groot had
estimated,
these now-vanished win-
dows had opened onto the outside air,
that much was true, but the openings

had not emerged at ground level, or not
exactly, anyway. The prison section of
the Hall of the People was surrounded
by a deep trench dug into the ground
around the footings of the building,
as a sort of a dry moat.
Unlike the
more usual objective served by moat-
building, that of keeping unwanted
visitors out, this one had, of course,
been designed to help keep unwilling
visitors in. Although there would have
been a two-story drop from the win-
dow to the bottom of the trench, some
prisoner had apparently managed to
navigate the hazard at some heroic
time in the past, for the openings had
all been obliterated by rock ﬁll and
new concrete and the top of the trench
had been closed off as well by a grating
of iron grillwork.
Even before Groot had ﬁnished cov-
ering the surface, the pasty solvent had

begun to foam. He dipped the spatula
into the wooden pot once more, used it
to neatly square off the one remaining
corner of block, hopped carefully off
the bench, and moved the bench back
against the opposite wall. The solvent,
based on a tincture of pressed liver-
wort in an alkaline broth, was both
well tested and fairly nontoxic, at least
if you weren’t made of concrete, or
such had been the claim of the chemist
Julio had located.
Still, Groot didn’t
particularly want the stuff dripping on
his head or down his back, so he was
content to watch it work from across
the cell. The solvent had ﬁlled a shal-
low reservoir at the bottom of the large
dinner pot; Groot estimated he’d used
about half of his supply thus far.
Another implement had been con-
cealed within the pot as well: a skele-
ton key. Groot inserted it into the lock

on his leg chain, and after creaking to
itself and shape-shifting its outline in
a quick blur and with a tingling vibra-
tion against his ﬁngers, the key found
its match. The lock clacked open.
Groot replaced the key in its slot and
lowered the large crock of stew into the
pot after it, concealing key and sol-
vent alike beneath its false bottom; the
crock locked itself into place with a
small click. The solvent had all been
present when the dinner had been de-
livered although the level of stew had
been a bit low, no doubt due to some
judicious taste-testing on the part of
the jailer as he made his inspection,
but that was, after all, his prerogative,
even with the bribes that Groot made
sure kept coming his way.
Julio had used a runner hired off
the street to deliver the meal.
Hope-
fully, that would insulate him from

immediate implication if the scheme
failed,
and both Julio and Eelmon
were nowhere in the vicinity at the
moment.
Still, Groot thought, there
are times when risks must be run, and
since those who were holding him were
obviously expecting him to try some-
thing of the sort, it would be best not
to disappoint them.
The foam was letting off a small siz-
zle as it worked its way through the ce-
ment matrix. It was not dripping down
the wall, as Groot had anticipated; in-
stead, the solvent was sticking ﬁrmly
to its area of application and was, in
fact, sinking with alacrity deeper into
the block. He heard a small clatter of
pebble against rock as a chunk of em-
bedded gravel fell free onto the solid
block below, the cement around it turn-
ing to goo and then to slush, followed
by an irregular patter as the rest of

the material began to slide free as well.
At one upper corner daylight suddenly
peeped through.
Groot squinted his
eyes just in case, but when no stab of
pain resulted from seeing the sun after
a day in stygian dungeon gloom, he
shrugged to himself and opened them
again, albeit with a careful squint.
Of course, he had had a candle, and
the new light from outside wasn’t ex-
actly direct sunlight spilling down into
the dry moat, but rather a fuzzy day-
time glow; there was surely no need to
get histrionic about this thing, Groot
thought, frowning.
“Stygian gloom,”
indeed.
Trying to keep a tighter grip on
his sense of proportion, Groot crossed
back to the rapidly vanishing block. It
looked much less like rock now and
much more like a chunk of almost-
melted ice.
On the other side of the

opening, by the side of the outer wall,
a length of rope dropped into view.
“Hello?” Groot hissed carefully.
“Who calls?” answered a deep rumbly
whisper, followed by a short round of
mufﬂed coughing.
“Groot,” he conﬁrmed.
There was no need to ask who was
on the other end.
Once indoors and
away from the clinging river air, Max’s
caravan-mate Svin had quickly thrown
off his shakes and chills and had pro-
ceeded to eat steadily for the better
part of a week, rapidly ﬁlling out much
of the mass he’d shed and beginning
to look less like a sheared seven-foot
sheep and more like the barbarian
ﬁghting machine of prototypical leg-
end.
The cough remained, however,
although it seemed to be triggered now
mostly by speech and exercise.
Svin
hadn’t been talking much, but he had

been spending most of his time work-
ing out, so the top ﬂoor and screened
roof-deck of Groot’s house - where Svin
had been staying in seclusion and out
of sight - had been rattled alternately
by the thud and thump of his exertions
and the rack of his booming catarrh.
Using the thick cloth that had swad-
dled the stewpot, Groot pushed the
slurry of foaming gravel that was now
all that remained of the concrete block
away from him over the edge of the
wall, wiped the facing surfaces clean,
and rolled the cloth over the side after
the goo. As his earlier estimation had
implied, the revealed open space was
big enough for a tight squeeze through
to the outside. Groot stretched one arm
ahead through the opening, grasped
the outer edge, boosted himself head-
ﬁrst into the breach, and wiggled care-
fully forward.
A quick glance down

over the rim showed that the cloth and
the remains of the block had already
merged into the expanse of leaves,
branches, mounded dirt, and assorted
litter that lined the bottom of the moat.
He twisted enough to crane his head
upward.
The rope rose another ten feet to
terminate in a hook which was looped
over a stout iron crossbar supporting
the local section of grating.
Perched
on the low retaining wall on the plaza
side was the ﬁgure of Svin, his back
toward the moat, sitting with the con-
tained menace of a lolling jungle cat,
his hands clasped around his knees
and his back leaning backward over
the screened moat. “What about this
grating?” Groot asked softly.
“Rust,” said Svin. “It is rotten and
will snap under your weight. Grasp the
thin part next to the rope.”

“Very well.” It was credible, which
was what was required.
“Proceed to
your diversion now, if you would. Re-
member, no killings - are you clear on
that?”
“It is no task for a warrior born,”
Svin commented, “but I am getting
used to that sort of thing.”
“Good, as long as we are clear. Con-
tact Julio when you’ve ﬁnished.”
Svin grunted.
“I am a barbarian,
not an infant; I can remember instruc-
tions.” He unfolded himself to his feet
and strode off.
Groot grunted for good measure.
The man had done his task. Using the
arm he had left outstretched behind
him, Groot took hold of the inner lip of
the wall and drew himself backward.
As his chest emerged from the passage-
way back into the cell and his weight
dropped him back toward the bench,

his grip on the outside slipped at just
the wrong instant and his head lashed
up and bashed itself against the rock
above him.
He gritted his teeth and
paused for a moment until the wave of
pain eased.
Guilt by association, that’s all this is
anyway, he thought to himself.
Max-
imillian and the rest of them like this
kind of nonsense, ﬁghting with guards,
sneaking in and out of buildings, amus-
ing themselves with feats of daring, but
not me; give me a back room, an ac-
count book, and a well-ﬁlled pipe any
day.
If it hadn’t been for the money
and his investment, he never would
have gotten involved with them in
the ﬁrst place. And look what it had
brought him to now. Fah! How he had
gotten a reputation as a person of phys-
ical action himself, why the forces of
Oolsmouth ofﬁcialdom had felt it nec-

essary to lock him up, and why they
nonetheless expected him to try some
miraculous escape, was beyond him.
Irrational, not to mention ...
His mind caught up in thought,
Groot eased himself the last inches
backward, felt for the bench with his
toes and then let his weight fully down
onto it, stretched out his back with a
satisfying lumbar pop, stepped off the
bench onto the ﬂoor, and started to
turn, with the intention of seating him-
self where he could catch the sluggish
air now circulating through his new
window and trying to freshen his en-
vironment. Instead, his turn brought
with it its own surprises. The cell door
was standing open and a familiar face
was framed in it.
“What do we have
here, now, then, your lordship?” said
the jailer.
There was still no reason not to

make himself comfortable, at least for
the moment, so Groot resumed his mo-
tion and lowered himself to the bench.
“What does it look like?” he said crossly.
“Why, an escape, your lordship, that
it does.”
“How can it be an escape if I’m still
here?”
“An escape attempt, sir, then, if you
please.
You shouldn’t do this sort of
thing; you know that. I’ll have to re-
port this, surely I will.”
Of course you’ll report it, you nincom-
poop, that’s your job. Instead of that re-
mark, though., Groot said. “How can I
be trying to escape if I was coming back
into the cell?”
“You got stuck,
couldn’t squeeze
yourself through, then, could you? One
too many steins of the stout, was it? “
“On the contrary,” stated Groot. “If
you will investigate for yourself, you

will clearly see that this ventilation
shaft is quite wide enough for both of
us to pass at once. I was merely having
a look at the weather and wondering
where that bit of wall went to while I
was dozing.”
The jailer was looking a bit smug,
and not a little reassured. “Checking
the lay of the land, then, were you?”
he chuckled. “Well, no matter.” He had
crossed the cell and was examining the
hole for himself. “What’s this, then - a
rope?”
“That’s what it looked like to me.
What do you think it’s doing there?”
“Perhaps you’ll be telling the mag-
istrate that yourself, then, won’t you.
You may think you’re something, sir,
but you’re no match for the likes of us,
now, are you? Hah! - and what’s this?”
“This” was the loose chain and empty
leg manacle.
“If you please,
sir?”

the warder proposed.
Groot allowed
himself to be shackled again. As the
jailer straightened, a mufﬂed pound-
ing, came to them from down the hall,
along with someone shouting inaudible
words. “What’s this, then?”
“Perhaps you’ve been ignoring some
other prisoner?” Groot suggested.
“Not that racket, sir;
that’s com-
ing from the entrance hall. You mind
yourself here, sir, I’ll be back with you
straight away. And I’ll be taking this,
too, if you don’t mind,” he added, car-
rying the stewpot with him to the door.
Groot watched from his bench, arms
crossed over his chest.
His hand on
the door to close it, the jailer paused.
“You’re a gentlemen, sir, of that there’s
no doubt.”
“Oh? Why is that?”
“A strong fast one like you. not try-
ing to cosh me and grab my keys while

there you were, free of the chain.
A
smart move, though, I’ll have you know.
You might have made it through to the
door, but after that, then, well ...” He
shrugged. “There might just have been
a small detachment loitering about out
in the front who wouldn’t be as kindly
disposed toward you as a pleasant fel-
low such as I. “ The jailer touched his
hand to his forelock.
“My man will show you our appreci-
ation,” Groot told him.
“You stay put now.” the jailer warned,
securing the door behind him.
Of course I’ll stay put, thought Groot,
that’s the whole idea.
Now that the
jailer had found the nefarious action
they had expected,
and had easily
headed it off, they would hopefully
feel they had everything under control,
which in turn should give Julio and
Groot the freedom to concentrate on

some real preparations.
He settled
back to think, and bide his time.
He didn’t have to wait long, as it
turned out, for it wasn’t more than a
minute before Warder Clang was back.
The jailer’s shoulders, though, were
hunched, as though he were uncon-
sciously trying to protect himself from
an ax-blow in the back, and his face
was set in a deep frown. Pushing open
the door, he said. “These visitors would
speak with - oof!”
“Out of our way,” snapped the ﬁrst
of the men behind him, unnecessarily,
since his contemptuous shove had al-
ready sent the jailer reeling off to one
side. The man raised a gloved ﬁnger
as Clang recovered his balance with
a hand against the wall and wheeled
to confront him. “Quiet,” the man di-
rected.
The three visitors ﬁled slowly into

the cell and arranged themselves in a
line facing Groot. They were dressed
identically, all in black, black breeches,
black tunics, black gloves, and black
masks pulled over their heads and
stuffed down their necks into the shirts.
Oval cutouts lined with ﬁlmy black
gauze outlined their eyes and mouths.
The men on either ﬂank were carry-
ing small black satchels.
“I thought
the Council had the last of your lot
disbanded years ago,” Groot told them.
“No,” said the one who had already
spoken.
“Obviously not.
Public con-
sumption to the contrary.
You must
realize why we have come.”
“Why don’t you explain it to me?”
said Groot dryly.
Inside.
though, he
felt anything but calm. Could this have
been what the lawyer Snee had been
concerned about, with his allusions
about the remnants of Oolsmouth’s

autocratic past?
“Very well, let your dread increase,”
the man said. “You are Meester Haalsen
Groot. We are . . . who we are. We have
come to put you to the question. The
key to his chain, please.” He stretched
out a hand to the jailer, but did not
move the direction of his gauze-hidden
gaze from Groot.
“What’s the need of that, then?” said
the jailer, his attitude surly.
“To unlock the chain,” said the man,
“so we can remove him without ﬁrst
removing his foot.” The lower part
of the hood stretched as he smiled
beneath it.
“Each thing in its time
and place.
To advance prematurely
would be scarcely professional.” His
two companions added a “hear-hear”
in agreement on either side of him.
“No, sir,” said the jailer.
“Begging
your lordship’s pardon -”

“Be still,” the man told him.
“We
could question both of you as easily as
one.
Now, the key.” The jailer stared
back at him, undecided, and the man
in black raised a hand to strike.
“Just a moment,” said Groot.
“You
are obviously making some mistake.
My incarceration here is purely a civil
matter.
Even if ‘the question’ was
still legal or even standard procedure,
which it clearly is not, you -”
The man,
his attention diverted
from the jailer to Groot, but obviously
not wanting to waste an already up-
lifted hand, swept it down into Groot’s
face. Groot rolled to the left with the
slap as the man’s ﬁngers scraped down
his cheek and spun his head heavily
around.
Slightly too late, Groot real-
ized fuzzily that there was more be-
neath the glove than just a hand, that
under the glove the man was wearing

an appliance giving him the force of
heavy mass and a raw ﬂaying surface
studded with the hooks or tiny barbs
that had just ripped their way through
his ﬂesh.
He could clearly feel the
warmth of blood as it trickled down
toward his jaw from his mauled skin.
Rather than concentrate on that, Groot
unscrewed his eyes and looked back up.
The man was standing with his arms
crossed. “It is ordered,” he said.
“By whom?” said Groot mushily.
“By those who give such orders.”
“Look here,” Groot said, trying to
drag his thoughts back into focus; he
wasn’t entirely sure what he was say-
ing out loud and what he was merely
thinking. “This situation is totally un-
necessary,” not to mention unexpected.
“Whatever questions you have, why
not just ask me?
No one’s asked me
anything.” have they

“As in many such undertakings,”
the man admitted, “the interrogation
portion of the question is scarcely the
point.
Yet our orders are clear.
No
mistake has been made.”
“I’m being held to guarantee my
bank loans,” muttered Groot. “That’s
what I was told, I’m here as part of an
extended business transaction. To ad-
vance from that to this attention from
you is completely disproportionate and
uncalled for.”
“You are hardly in a position to -”
“It would unbalance the stability
of Oolsmouth,” Groot said, reeling on-
ward. “I am a citizen. I am a member
of the Council! If I can be imprisoned,
stripped of assets by thieving decree,
and put to your question just because
some gods choose to have a squabble,
then what rights and expectations re-
main to any citizen?”

“I know nothing of these things,”
said the torturer, apparently enjoying
the writhings of his prey, “and further-
more, I care even less. You and I have
a job to do together, a task has been set
us, and -”
“A question of the social compact
is at stake,” Groot snapped.
“There
is always a tension between the pre-
rogatives of gods and the rights of
people, but this is without question an
egregious breach.
How can business
continue on a rational basis if a bolt
such as this can strike from a cloud-
less sky? And furthermore, I challenge
your legitimacy to be here - your kind
was banned years ago! I demand to see
your orders! Who -”
As he threw words at them.
the
three torturers had scrutinized Groot
from behind their masks as though he
were a small bug scheduled for immi-

nent dissection.
He had realized he
was wasting his voice as far as they
were concerned, but they weren’t re-
ally his intended audience. The jailer,
who had begun edging backward as
the men in black shifted all their at-
tention to Groot, had now reached the
hall. The heavy thump of the closing
door brought their focus back to him
in a hurry. The torturers wheeled in
astonishment and stared at the door.
“What are you doing?” shouted the
head of the delegation as they heard
the thud of the locking bar dropping
into place outside the cell. “What is the
meaning of this?’”
“Meester Groot speaks aright,” the
jailer said, his voice emboldened by the
intervention of six inches of iron-bound
wood. “Show whichever documentation
you’ve got, your warrant and your char-
ter, for -”

“Open that door this instant or I will
personally ﬂay the meat from -”
“None of that,
then,
sir,
if you
please,” called the jailer.
“My own
father was dragged away by a crew
like yours: never saw him again, did
we, not a piece. Now these days I can
vote, and I do that, don’t you know,
and one reason is to stand for the rule
of law, as Meester Groot makes the
point, and against your kind.
Now,
your documents, please, sir.”
“If you don’t open that door, Groot
and his points will be moot,” the tor-
turer said. “We can work just as well
in here.”
Which was, of course, from Groot’s
angle the major shortcoming in the
jailer’s move, but it was the best oppor-
tunity that had presented itself. Would
the jailer take the next step, though?
There was a pause while the three

torturers examined Groot, waiting for
the jailer’s response. “Where are you?”
yelled the ﬁrst man in black after a mo-
ment. “You haven’t gone and -”
“Begging your pardon,
your lord-
ship,” the jailer said, his voice faint but
growing louder again.
“Here we are.
It’s rather a bit bulky, don’t you know,
so I haven’t been lugging it about be-
fore this, never could see the need, but
after this business it will never be far
from my hand, I can assure you that,
sir.
This, you see, sir.” In the light
of the jailer’s lantern Groot caught a
ﬂash of brass outside the barred hole in
the door; the torturers, though, could
probably see it more clearly than he.
“I’ve a troop on station just outside the
block waiting for the call of this horn,”
explained the jailer. “Now, then, shall
I blow, or will you produce your bone
feedays? “

“What?”
“I suspect he means ‘bona ﬁdes’,”
Groot said under his breath.
No one
paid him any heed, which suited Groot
perfectly well at the moment.
The man in black glowered at the
door, then reached his decision.
“On
your head be it!” He raised his left
hand and snapped his ﬁngers. Along
with the snap his hand gave off a slight
metallic clang as his concealed appli-
ance jangled. The man on his left set
down his satchel and neatly folded the
lid panels away to either side. Groot
got a brief glimpse of shiny metal im-
plements stowed away in compart-
ments or lashed to each visible surface;
something that incorporated a vise-
clamp with needle-razor jaws and a
hollow vacuum tube drew his attention
as though the metal and his eyes were
both complementarily magnetized. In-

stead of an instrument, however, the
man withdrew a rolled parchment of
ofﬁcial-looking cast and passed it to
his leader, then closed and re-latched
his case.
“This is our warrant,” said
the leader, raising the parchment to
shoulder level.
“Show it to Meester Groot,” the jailer
told him.
“He has nothing to say in -”
“This window is scarcely large enough
to pass such a grand document without
shredding it into rags,” said the jailer
patiently, as though imparting a lesson
to a child, “and I will not be opening
this door so it can be handed to me
more conveniently. Show it to Meester
Groot.” He displayed his horn again
behind the tight bars.
The torturer stood motionless for a
moment before turning stifﬂy to half-
hand, half-throw the document toward

Groot. “Thank you,” said Groot. “The
candle is over there on the ﬂoor, if you
don’t mind?”
To Groot’s surprise, one of the assis-
tants actually brought it over to him.
Between the candle and the glow from
the hole in the wail, the writing was
easy to make out.
“This is a rather
curious memorandum.” he said after a
moment, starting to read it a second
time.
“It is indeed a warrant for the
‘extraction of substance through the
procedure of the Question,’ as it states
here in so many words, from Haalsen
Groot, presently incarcerated in so on
and so forth.
It gives no statutory
authority except in effect the recogni-
zance of the executor, whose signature
is unclear; however, it is a signature
I recognize, that of a certain Dooglas
who serves with me on the Council. For
some reason, Meester Dooglas seems

to feel justiﬁed, through this instru-
ment, in speaking in the name and
on behalf of the full Council, which is,
of course, absurd. However, the most
curious part of this document is where
Meester Dooglas states that this war-
rant is commissioned at the behest and
in the name of the patron of the Bank
of the New Dawn, who is identiﬁed
here by name as the god Sapriel.”
“A god, you say, then?” asked the
jailer.
“That is what the document states.”
“Sapriel?”
mused
Warder
Clang.
“Can’t say where I’ve ever heard of
a god by that name.”
“Do you wish to add blasphemy to
your -” the torturer said.
“Be quiet, if you please, sir, while
Meester Groot and I are conferring.
Does this paper show any seals, coun-
tersignatures, or tokens, Meester Groot?

“Only the personal stamp of Dooglas
himself, with which I am familiar. It
appears, given the poor lighting, to be
legitimate.”
“I don’t know about this,” said the
jailer thoughtfully. “There’s the prob-
lem with jurisdiction, you see, that
goes beyond the question of these other
gentlemen themselves.”
“Dooglas
is
clearly
exaggerating
when he talks about acting for the
Council” Groot said, “since I am on the
Council and he obviously is not acting
for me.
Knowing Dooglas as I do, I
think it quite probable that he was
acting alone, by himself, in creating
this order,as part of a long-standing
enmity between us; not, as the docu-
ment claims, in the name of a god, and
especially not in the name of the Coun-
cil. Even if we grant him the power of
attorney for this Sapriel and say that

this warrant is indeed rightfully com-
missioned in his name, Oolsmouth, as
a matter of practice under the Char-
ter of Rights, does not recognize the
magisterium of gods over civil govern-
ment. I presume that is the problem of
jurisdiction to which you referred?”
“What -” sputtered the lead torturer,
“- what? This is beyond blasphemy, be-
yond mere disobedience to divine will,
beyond -”
“Yes, well, there it is,” stated Groot.
“Your orthodoxy is not well chosen in
this instance.
The operative passage
of the Charter of Rights clearly states
that Oolsmouth does not submit itself
to the sole sovereignty of any -”
“When we get our instruments on
you, I will enjoy -”
“It is true that it is difﬁcult to say
no to a god whose determination is set
on a particular path,” said Groot, the

pain in his cheek goading him to more
feistiness than he usually displayed.
“The gods are like the hypertrophic
mountain ape of the proverb, which
goes where it chooses rather than
where society would have it; admit-
tedly, then, the quoted paragraph of
the Charter of Rights is more a matter
of general policy than blanket writ. If
there were no gods there would still
be earthquakes, volcanoes, calamities
of all sorts against which legislation
would similarly fail. Nevertheless, we
still must stand for some things. If this
Sapriel is so committed to this course
of action, let him come and prosecute
it himself; if not, let us follow the pro-
cedures imposed by the consent of the
governed.”
“If you listen to this argument,” the
torturer told the jailer, “I will person-
ally see to it that any children of yours

are -”
“In truth, there is something to be
said on each side,” interrupted the
jailer.
“On the one hand, as Meester
Groot has it, the rule of law; on the
other, as you yourself put it, the force
of fear and power.
As Meester Groot
stated aright, you yourself and the
other gentlemen with you have no ofﬁ-
cial standing, you and your ‘question’;
in fact, you are outlaws, if I might be
so bold. You are also, at this moment,
behind bars.”
“We will set to work on him,” said the
torturer.
“I will summon the reinforcements,”
said the jailer.
“Wait a moment,” said Groot. “I do
not understand why Meester Dooglas,
known throughout Oolsmouth for his
suspicious and devious attitude, would
be so open about issuing such a con-

troversial and ill-grounded order or in-
volving himself so unambiguously with
any particular god, since gods are so
notoriously ﬁckle and unreliable. I did
not understand this and I still do not,
but another explanation has presented
itself. I have discovered just now that
this signature is not actually in Doo-
glas’ handwriting.”
“Do you mean to tell us that you
claim this document is forged?” said
the torturer.
“Look for yourself,” Groot said, hold-
ing it up. “Whoever is behind this is
toying with you just as you are toying
with me.”
“This is absurd,” the torturer de-
clared. “You would expect him to say
anything in his futile attempt to es-
cape.”
“Are you sure, then?” the jailer asked
Groot.

“Absolutely,” Groot lied.
“This is a suspicious business.” said
the jailer, “a very suspicious business
indeed. It is too much for the likes of
me to decide, of that there is no ques-
tion.
I will not yield Meester Groot
without the approval of my superior.”
“Now you just -” shouted the tor-
turer.
The jailer rolled stolidly over him.
“I reckon that my superior would re-
quire more proof of this order you have
here. I’d reckon that he’d require a per-
sonal appearance or some other proof
from this Sapriel, or enough convinc-
ing from this Meester Douglas, and I
know my superior well enough to be
sure he’d need a good quotation of the
right municipal codes.
Then you can
have him.”
“By rights.” said Groot, “the full
Council should convene for discussion,

since the name of the Council has been
brought into this. An individual Coun-
cil member does not have the authority
to act against another citizen, let alone
another Council member, let alone in
such an underhanded way as this, and
especially using the name of Council
as a whole,so you can clearly see the
necessity for a full debate.”
“As you say,
sir,” said the jailer.
“Here is my decision.
Since Meester
Groot is under my keeping, I will not
have you mutilating him before rein-
forcements can arrive. Since you have
made threats against me, I will not
let you go free to mutilate me without
reinforcements at my side to prevent
that. What I will do is this. I will blow
this noisemaker to summon the troops
outside. Right then, I will unbar this
door and retreat quickly up this hall
away from the exit. If you hurry and

do not pause for any mutilations what-
ever, you will have just enough time
to escape from this building before my
colleagues arrive to capture you.”
The lead torturer had been sputter-
ing and trying to break in, without suc-
cess. Now, he had just managed to in-
sert, in a shout full of menace, “Don’t
you dare blow that -” when the clear
tone of a hunting horn burst on them
at close quarters-”oo-OOH; oo-OOH; oo-
OOH !” The torturer’s curse was buried
under the echoes, and then under the
creak of the door being dragged open
by his two assistants as they almost
tumbled over themselves in their haste.
“Damn!” yelled the leader, following the
other two through the exit at a dead
run. A short moment later, the jailer
poked his head back into the cell.
“Thank you,” said Groot.
“I may be just a plain man, just a

turnkey, as you see, but I know what
my job is, not to pat myself on the back,
don’t you know, and sometimes I even
know what’s wrong and what’s right.
Now, after I check with my captain to
make sure they caught up those three
characters on their way out, I’ll just
get back to what I was doing before,
then, which was moving you to a cell
without a passage straight through the
wall, and if you don’t mind I’ll fetch you
something for that cheek of yours, too.”
“You are a prince among civic ofﬁ-
cials,” said Groot as the jailer barred
the door again from the outside and
took off.
Groot spread out the war-
rant, which he had retained, and had
another careful look at it. So, it was
Dooglas, after all. Groot regretted his
exaggeration
concerning
the
forged
signature; on the other hand, at that
point it had still seemed possible for

the matter to swing either way. Now
the situation was clearer. There would
be no more of this pussyfooting around.
Dooglas had thrown down his gauntlet.
It was time to see he got it back.

Chapter10
ON THE
OOLSMOUTH
STREETS
THE TRIP DOWN TO OOLSMOUTH
WAS A TOTAL BUST as far as an-
swers were concerned. Zhardann and
Jill-tang and I rode horses all day,
stopped for an occasional meal, and

let the servants pop open the baggage
train for a peaceful ﬁre and the raising
of Zhardann’s mobile pavilion when we
dug in for the night. I didn’t sleep in
the pavilion, don’t get me wrong, and
whatever Zhardann and Jill were up
to in there was ﬁne with me; she may
have thought she was my wife, but
that didn’t mean I had to agree, and
if she thought she could tick me off
by hanging out with Zhardann I was
perfectly willing to let her waste the
effort.
I was happy enough that she
wasn’t trying to put the make on me.
I didn’t let her know that, of course.
If she discovered anything that made
me happy I ﬁgured she’d immediately
set about removing it from the scene,
and anything that drove me up the
wall, well, I didn’t particularly want to
think about that.
I’m not complaining. It was a pleas-

ant enough excursion as long as I
didn’t dwell too deeply on my fate
if they discovered I wasn’t who they
thought I was.
For that matter, laz-
ing around with the gods was not
nearly the transcendental experience
I might have anticipated. They didn’t
wear their power on their sleeves, so
to speak, and the grass didn’t turn
greener (or blacker,
which I guess
would have been equally probable)
when they walked across it.
In fact,
you’d have been hard put to ﬁnd any
difference between the way they trav-
eled and the habits of any normal rich
person with a retinue to wash the
dishes and pick up after them, if you’d
be willing to call that normal.
We made reasonable time; not the
kind of pace you’d set with a winged
horse or a sky-chariot or even a steered
balloon, but we didn’t dawdle either.

When you got right down to it, the only
differences that sprang to mind be-
tween the trip I’d expected to have and
the one I was getting instead were the
direction I was heading and the com-
pany I was traveling with. Of course,
those weren’t exactly minor differences
either. Although I was sure Max could
be a difﬁcult traveling companion if
he wanted, at least I didn’t have to
watch my every step with him, with
the penalty of a wrong move being
instant annihilation.
We didn’t talk much, just bounced
around on our horses during the day
and sat looking cryptically at each
other over our plates in the evening.
As a result, I didn’t ﬁnd out anything
more on the road about why we were
heading for Oolsmouth,
or what it
was about the headquarters of the
Oolvaan Mutual Bank that would jus-

tify the trip once we’d arrived. There
was no disguising Zhardann’s prior-
ities, though, for when we reached
Oolsmouth late on the morning of the
fourth day after our departure from
Roosing Oolvaya, Zhardann sent the
retainers off in one direction with the
baggage and immediately led Jill and
me out into the city on another course
entirely.
Compared to Roosing Oolvaya, Oolsm
was a real city decorated conspicu-
ously with the signs of genuine wealth.
Not
that
Roosing
Oolvaya
is
any-
thing to sneer at,
you understand,
but Oolsmouth did make its smaller
cousin to the north look a bit shabby by
comparison. With its wide streets and
public statuary and big fancy buildings,
the block-sized palaces of the merchant
trading houses and their adjoining
temples festooned with stone carvings

and stained glass and long paneled
frescoes, the parks with their rolling
green lawns and pruned trees and civ-
ilized squirrels, and the unmistakable
absence of a city wall, Oolsmouth radi-
ated an aura of smug gentility mixed
with ostentatious opulence.
It was a
place that was secure enough in its af-
ﬂuence and stature that it had to fear
neither invasion nor the restraints of
good taste and didn’t care who knew
it. We even passed an opera house, of
all things, complete with a grand colon-
naded entrance lined with statues of
musicians waving their various ﬂutes
and woodwinds and strings toward the
heroically proportioned woman at the
center, her stone wings upraised, arms
outstretched, eyes uplifted, and throat
distended in a mercifully silent strato-
spheric wail: at least they’d stopped
short of having some specialist sor-

cerer animate the statues, although
maybe they saved that for the sea-
son’s opening night.
A block down
from the opera building, in front of the
open gate of another three-story wood-
frame complex, my skin prickled and
the air turned abruptly cool and fresh
as we entered the leakage zone of an
air-conditioner ﬁeld pushing back the
muggy breezes off the river. I immedi-
ately tried to think of a good reason to
visit whoever lived inside the place, or
at least to stroll in the door, since their
air conditioning was the most pleas-
ant sensation I’d felt all day. Even my
horse turned its head and glanced long-
ingly through the gate, but Zhardann,
in the lead, never wavered. I gritted
my teeth and urged the horse on. Five
paces later the humid river air came
rolling back over us.
We turned the corner at the end of

the block.
Amazingly, the street just
ahead even had a stone sidewalk sepa-
rated from the thoroughfare proper by
a neat row of shrubs.
Trafﬁc was as
bustling and purposeful here as it had
been anywhere else around the center
of town.
Over on the right, though,
where another major building occu-
pied the center of the block ﬂanked by
a two-story structure on each side, I
could see an obvious gap in the trafﬁc.
People were edging away from the en-
trance to the bigger building, making
long curves in the street to keep from
getting too close and taking a detour
that was too self-evident to be any-
thing else. A few men were loitering
around in front of the place, men with
pikes and swords who were all wearing
the same outﬁt, a yellow tunic with a
green cap draped over the left shoulder
and balanced with a rakish dangle off

the right.
Zhardann reined up.
“Hmm,” he
said. Then he urged his horse ahead
again and trotted toward the cleared
area, making for the locked gates at
the entrance to the building’s court-
yard. Jill and I followed. As we broke
clear of the street trafﬁc and our des-
tination became apparent, two of the
uniformed men moved to intercept us,
holding their pikes at the ready. One
of them raised his free hand to block
Zhardann and said, “Halt!
What is
your business here?”
“Why?” said Zhardann, letting his
horse continue straight toward the
man. “Who are you?”
The man held his position, dropped
the butt of his pike to the ground, and
lowered the sharpened metal tip to-
ward Zhardann’s face.
“Halt, I said.
What are you, deaf?”

Zhardann looked at the pike. Judg-
ing by the look in his eyes, he was
apparently weighing exactly how to
go about pulverizing it. He pulled the
horse to a stop a hand’s-breadth before
he would have impaled himself in the
eye.
“And I said, who are you to be
asking me anything? I have business
with this establishment.”
“No, sir, you do not,” said the guard.
“Oh?” said Zhardann. “And why is
that?”
“Because this establishment is closed,
sir.”
The gate was not only closed and
locked, it had a thick chain looped
through it, and the chain, too, was
locked. The driveway under the third-
story overhang and the interior court-
yard I could see beyond appeared
empty and deserted.
A person-sized
street-entry door next to the gate was

also closed and sealed shut with a
chain. “Just why is this establishment
closed?” Zhardann demanded.
“This
is a bank, is it not, and the idea of
banking is to deal with customers, of
whom I am one, so what is the problem
here?”
“The establishment is closed. Sir.”
“So you said. Why?”
“Because it’s not open.”
Jill, who’d ridden up next to Zhardann
leaned over and put a hand on his
shoulder.
I was a little surprised
to see that her palm wasn’t burned;
Zhardann was obviously getting pretty
heated up.
“When will the bank be
open?” she said.
“I don’t know that I can say, ma’am.”
“Is the bank still in business?”
“That most likely depends on how
you deﬁne things.” said the guard, who
was either the Oolsmouth champion

straight man or who was having a very
good time without a sign of it showing
on his face.
“What do you mean,” shouted Zhardan
“ ‘deﬁne things’?”
“I think you’d best be moving along
now, sir.” The guard waggled his pike
suggestively.
“Do you have any idea who I am?”
“Wouldn’t make no never mind if I
did.”
“Wait,” said Jill, tightening her grip
on Zhardann. “This is the Oolvaan Mu-
tual Bank, isn’t it?’
“Again, ma’am, that mostly depends
on how you deﬁne it,” said the guard.
“How would you deﬁne it?”
“It’s surely not my place to say,
ma’am.”
“Who could we see to ﬁnd out more
about the situation, then?”
“I’d have to think about that, ma’am.

Don’t rightly know that there is more
to ﬁnd out.”
The score was now (at best) Guard
2, My Side 0, so I ﬁgured I might as
well step up and take my chance. “Who
hired you?” I asked him.
“I don’t know that that’s any of your
concern, sir.”
“Look.” I said. “Let’s try this. You’ve
heard we’re here to do business with
a bank. You’re telling us we can’t do
business with this bank, right? Do you
have any suggestions about another
bank we should take our trade to?”
“That would be the Bank of the New
Dawn, sir.”
Zhardann and Jill turned in unison
to stare at me. I crossed my forearms
over the pommel and leaned comfort-
ably forward over my horse ‘s neck to-
ward the guard.
“Any particular rea-
son you make that speciﬁc recommen-

dation?”
“Of course,
sir,” said the guard.
“I don’t take the affairs of business
lightly, I can assure you.”
He wasn’t going to continue until
I asked the right question. “I’m sure
you don’t,” I said.
“Neither do we.
Let me review the situation for you.
We need to accomplish a transaction
with a banking establishment.
You
tell us that this one, the one we had
planned to use, the Oolvaan Mutual
Bank, is unavailable, and you suggest
we take our business instead to this
Bank of the New Dawn. If we’re going
to change our arrangements, though,
we could just as easily pick a new
bank at random or consult with our
colleagues for their referral, so unless
you have a particularly convincing jus-
tiﬁcation for this New Dawn place I
doubt we’re going to bother visiting it.

Why should we consider the Bank of
the New Dawn?”
“I surely wouldn’t insult you by stat-
ing the obvious, sir,” the guard said.
“Go ahead,” I told him. “I can take
it.”
Finally the guy’s mouth quirked; he
knew I had him. He could just refuse
to say anything, of course, but I didn’t
think that was the game he was play-
ing. He thought about it for a second
or so, though, before responding. “Al-
though it’s not rightly my place to say,
I believe the Bank of the New Dawn
will be taking over the accounts of the
Oolvaan Mutual Bank. If you and your
colleagues are already customers of the
Oolvaan Mutual, I ‘m sure the Bank of
the New Dawn will be in touch with
you soon.”
“Thank you,” I said.
“That’s very
helpful. Zhardann, why don’t you tip

this helpful fellow?”
“You must be -” said Zhardann.
“I agree,” Jill hissed. “Do it.”
Zhardann dug in his belt and came
up with a few coins which he extended
toward the guard. The guard touched
two ﬁngers to his forehead and reached
out his hand for them, although he
didn’t move his pike from its position
in front of Zhardann’s nose during the
process. Before the guard could grab
the money, though, Zhardann lifted his
hand out of reach.
“What about the
patron of the Oolvaan Mutual Bank? I
have dealt with him corporeally in the
past.”
“I’m sure I don’t know, sir,” said the
guard.
He eyed the money but kept
himself from out-and-out licking his
lips.
“You could guess,” I suggested. “I’m
sure my colleague would be content

with a guess.”
“I don’t think that would be very pru-
dent, sir.”
“The patron’s name is Pasook,” said
Zhardann. “Soaf Pasook.”
The guard shook his head.
“Can’t
say I can help you, sir. I’m a guard, sir,
not an information agency.”
“Hand it to him,” Jill told Zhardann,
“don’t throw it in his face.”
“Thank you very much, sir,” said the
guard, ﬁnally pocketing the coins.
“It must have been busy for you,” I
remarked to the guard in a conversa-
tional tone, “dealing with all the other
customers coming up here, wanting to
know what’s happened to their bank.”
The guard looked at Zhardann. He
may have stiffened his shoulders, but
he still took the hint and went again for
his coin-bag. The new coin in his hand,
Zhardann narrowed his eyes and tried

to stare the guy down. “Don’t know if
I can rightly say, “ the guard repeated
thoughtfully, absently letting the pike
slip so that its point rested gently
between Zhardann’s eyes.
Zhardann
carefully handed him the coin.
The guard straightened up and ad-
justed the pike backward away from
Zhardann’s face.
“I beg your pardon,
sir.
This midday sun and all these
questions, don’t you know, and per-
haps a touch of the sunstroke.
Your
party must be new to the city, I wager.”
“What makes you say that?” I asked
him.
“Why, only because you’re the ﬁrst
ones to inquire about this establish-
ment all day.”
“And why wouldn’t the locals be do-
ing the same?”
“I’m sure I don’t know, sir,” said the
guard, “but because of the sunstroke

perhaps I’ll venture a guess. Perhaps
it’s only that they’ve heard about old
Groot.”
Groot? I thought. “What about this
‘old Groot’?”
“Only that he’s in prison, sir, and
some speculate on the coincidence, see-
ing as his company had its dealings
with this very establishment.”
“Are you saying -” said Zhardann.
“Was I saying something?” the guard
inquired. He shook his head. “It must
be that sunstroke, damn me;
can’t
rightly remember from moment to mo-
ment what I was talking about.
No
telling what nonsense might be slip-
ping from my mouth in an instant of
confusion.”
I glanced around at the other three
guards.
They had edged in smoothly
to surround us but had otherwise kept
their own mouths shut. “Perhaps one

of your fellow sentinels could help in
your time of incapacitation?”
“As you can see, sir, this entire post
is exposed to the full force of the sun.
My men and I suffer together in experi-
encing its effects.”
“Then my friends join with me, I’m
certain, in wishing you all a full and
prompt recovery,” I told him. I turned
to Zhardann. “Shall we leave this poor
fellow in peace?”
“I -”
“Yes,” said Jill, “let’s do that.”
I jockeyed my horse around and let
Jill drag Zhardann after me as behind
us the other guards converged on their
spokesman to help him split up the
loot. After a moment, Zhardann trot-
ted up level with me on the left and Jill
matched him on the right. “I thought
that was interesting,” I said.
“Didn’t
you?”

“What’s so interesting about a dis-
respectful
mortal?”
said
Zhardann
sharply; he was still fuming.
“There
are ways of dealing with that kind of
useless -”
“Yes, there are,” I said, “and if you
were paying attention you will have no-
ticed that I used one of them.
To di-
gress for a second, you don’t want ev-
erybody in the city to know there’s a
unhappy god stalking the streets, do
you?”
“It achieves results.”
“It also sends folks into hiding un-
der the bed, them and their valuables.
Like their rings. On top of that, there’s
no reason for us to reveal our hand un-
til we absolutely have to.” If Zhardann
was honestly thinking the way he was
talking, no way could he really be
Gashanatantra in disguise; from his
reputation Gash was prone to spinning

off stratagems and intrigues even in
his sleep. “Let’s keep the advantage of
surprise, why don’t we?”
“Oh, yes,” Zhardann said caustically,
“surprise.
For beings of our stature,
there are worthy tactics and unworthy
tactics. Power is meant to be used for
domination, not hidden away for -”
“It’s the difference between an army
with broadswords and a trained assas-
sin with a knife,” I said.
“They each
have their uses. You may be the master
of one, but I ‘m the master of the other,
and we happen to be playing my kind
of game at the moment. Don’t worry
about it; you’ve got potential, I think
you’ll do just ﬁne.”
“What did you think was so interest-
ing?” Jill said quickly.
“It’s a strange coincidence,” I re-
marked, “wouldn’t you think?
Some-
body else making a move on Pasook

just when we’ve arrived to search him
out.”
A wagon loaded with crates and
drawn by a pair of morose oxen moved
slowly across the intersection in front
of us and we stopped to let it pass.
“Could someone else have discovered
the connection between Soaf Pasook
and the ring?” Jill said.
“It does make you wonder, doesn’t
it,” I said. “I haven’t talked about the
ring to anyone else, but who knows
about Pasook himself:
maybe he let
something slip, or maybe somebody
had something on him that made him
slip. And, of course, we all know there
are other ways as well.”
“Hmph,” said Zhardann. “This is all
quite improbable.”
“Nevertheless,” Jill said, “something
more is going on here than we antici-
pated.”

“All we have to do is cut through it,
then,” Zhardann announced, digging
his heels into the horse’s sides; the
horse jerked into motion, shoving peo-
ple out of the way to a chorus of yells
and curses.
“Let’s visit this Bank of
the New Dawn and get them to –”
“Stop that,” sail Jill.
She urged
her horse level with Zhardann’s again,
knocking another knot of people aside
on her own, and grabbed his reins.
Both horses ground to a halt.
“He’s
right. There’s no reason to be unnec-
essarily conspicuous.
If nothing else,
creating a bad scene here could get
back to the Abdicationists and bolster
their case.”
“Wait a second,” I said.
“You don’t
intrigue against gods this way, do you,
Zhardann?”
“Of course not.” Zhardann was the
picture of resentment, shoulders tensed

arms folded belligerently across his
chest, face locked in a scowl.
“What
does that have to do with anything?
These aren’t gods, these are people.
They are as dust beneath our feet.”
“That’s not a helpful mind-set. Try
thinking of these people as though they
were gods. Never underestimate your
adversary, right? Treat them as if they
were worthy of your subtlety, even if
they’re not; you’ll be able to get a lot
more done with them in any case if you
don’t look at them like squirrels.
I’ll
grant you it may be more fun to erad-
icate a few here and there, but that’s
not what we’re here for, as I recall. Un-
less you’ve changed your agenda?”
“Very well,” he said after a moment.
“What is your plan, then?”
“We’ll want to visit this New Dawn
place eventually, but I’d rather not go
directly there until we know a little

more about what’s going on. The guard
mentioned this Groot person they’ve
thrown in jail - perhaps there’s some-
thing useful he can tell us.”
“Yes,” Zhardann said slowly.
“That
might be a worthwhile course.”
“Why don’t you go to our rooms
and start arranging things there,” Jill
said to Zhardann, “while he and I ﬁnd
Groot. As he said, this is his element.”
“Indeed,” said Zhardann, with an-
other sour glance in my direction.
“Indeed, indeed,” I added for good
measure. I could have suggested I go
alone, but there was no point in wast-
ing my breath; Jill had volunteered
to accompany me not to help me out
but to keep me under her thumb.
I
might be able to make that cut both
ways, though, and in any case I was
feeling enough of a sense of relief at
the moment that a little matter like a

homicidal nursemaid dogging my steps
wasn’t enough to rufﬂe me.
Soaf Pasook hadn’t been around, and
from the sound of it there was a decent
chance he was gone from the scene for
one reason or another. As long as he
wasn’t available, I wouldn’t have to
confront him. If I’d had to come face
to face with Pasook, who, of course,
wouldn’t have the slightest idea who I
was, the jig would most probably have
been up, since my erstwhile partners
would have immediately realized I’d
never been teamed up with Pasook
at all and that he’d never heard of
the ring that was at the center of our
present shenanigans.
There was a disturbing side to this
situation, though, which I couldn’t ig-
nore. What was the real story behind
this bank war and why was it happen-
ing at this particular time? It couldn’t

be connected with the story about Pa-
sook and the ring - or could it? Jill and
Zhardann had put that story together
with my tacit prodding. What if there
was someone else who knew about me
and my connections (or rather about
the god they thought I really was) and
had come to the same conclusions as
Zhardann? If this hypothetical some-
one had pieced together the same story,
but a little earlier than we had, they
could have pounced on Pasook ﬁrst.
Well, whatever the background, I
was the natural person to take the
lead in digging out the answers. Even
Jill and Zhardann should be able to
accept that. After all, they ﬁgured that
even if I was really Gash I had been
masquerading as a detective, and since
I’d done a reasonably convincing job of
it I had to be at least competent in
that role. Of course, they didn’t know

I really was a detective, but for the
purposes of this discussion that didn’t
necessarily matter. Unless ...
Another disconcerting thought struck
me.
What if the detective bit really
was a masquerade, except I was the
one who didn’t know about it? I hadn’t
been dwelling on the Spell of Name-
lessness, but that didn’t mean it was
completely out of my thoughts. No, I
decided, that thought’s just a little too
paranoid, even for me. Wiping out my
memory with some fancy curse was
one thing, changing my entire person-
ality was something else entirely; it
was clearly too improbable to swallow.
Without another word,
Zhardann
turned his horse and headed off down
the intersecting boulevard. “He’s in a
touchy mood today,” I remarked, “isn’t
he now.”
“You should treat him with more re-

spect,” said Jill. “You know who he is,
even if these vermin infesting us don’t.”
“Vermin infestation, that’s a nice
turn of phrase. Do me a favor, though,
don’t use it as a form of address when
we’re with these folks, okay?
Trying
to talk somebody into doing something
they don’t think they should do isn’t
made any easier by calling them Your
Verminship.” That wagon had ﬁnally
cleared the intersection and we rode
on through in the same direction along
which we’d already been proceeding.
Ahead of us a few blocks down I could
see an open space that looked like a
park, with some kind of overgrown
stone fountain in the middle.
“By
the way, do you have any idea what
direction the main jail’s in?
I don’t
remember visiting Oolsmouth before.”
“I thought you were supposed to be
a detective,” she said, amused. “Well,

detect it.”
“Thanks a lot,” I said. “You want to
see me jump through a hoop, ﬁne, I’ll
jump through a hoop.”
“Why did you say the ‘main’ jail,
though?
Groot could be incarcerated
anywhere.”
“The guard said he’d been arrested,
so that implies he’s being held by the
city, not by a private force in some pri-
vate lockup. If he’s really as important
a businessman as it sounds, or at least
as important to the Oolvaan Mutual
Bank, they’d want him in the principal
facility.”
“Is that kind of reasoning all a detec-
tive has to do? It’s so simple it’s embar-
rassing. Anyone could do it.
“Thought is thought,” I said. “That’s
all it is and that’s all it takes, that and
a willingness to talk to people, get lied
to, get beaten up occasionally just like

a regular person, spend a lot of your
time frustrated and bored, and ulti-
mately ﬁnd out things you didn’t really
want to know in the ﬁrst place. I never
said it was anything special. You want
to give it a try, be my guest.”
More of that plaza was coming into
view down the boulevard in front of
us. Either Oolsmouth was even richer
than I’d ﬁgured, enough so to afford
more than one big useless civic loi-
tering yard, or that was the center of
town; the jail had to be around some-
where.
As we got closer, all doubt
vanished. Facing us across the plaza
was a stone, glass, and metal build-
ing that was so large, so lumpish, so
overhung with architectural doodads
and gewgaws, and so lacking in style
or taste that it had to be where the
Oolsmouth bureaucrats hung out when
they weren’t in the streets ﬂeecing the

public or generally making life difﬁcult.
They’d know where the jail was.
The building’s horse park was around
the side, which was where we stumbled
across the entrance to the jail as well.
“You see?” I told Jill conﬁdently, point-
ing it out in case she’d missed it. “Here
it is. Does that restore your faith, or
what?”
“You can’t restore something that
never was -”
“Fine,” I said, “thank you, I appre-
ciate the compliment.
“ I cantered
ahead to the fenced-off corral at the
rear, swung off the horse, took a num-
bered chit of wood from the stable
attendant,
and walked back across
the yard toward the city hall build-
ing’s side entrance. Over in the street,
a group of prettied-up workers were
gathered around a small bazaar of
street vendors, wrapped in clouds of

steam from fat-fryers and the aromas
of heaped ﬁsh:
I guessed it was al-
ready lunchtime, at that.
A gaggle
of supplicants, mendicants, transients,
and other loiterers were loaﬁng around
the scene or working the passersby in
one way or another, and a line of bored-
looking folks stretched out of another
side entrance and off down the street.
“What makes you think we’ll be able
to get in to see this Groot person with-
out revealing something important?”
Jill asked, having caught up with me
where I’d paused to survey the crowd.
“Part of the art,” I said.
“Keep
your voice down.” Actually, her volume
hadn’t been that loud, but it had been
loud enough to attract the attention
of a man who had been crossing the
courtyard going in roughly the same
direction as us, toward the jail. At the
mention of Groot, he had paused in his

tracks and looked straight at us. More
for his ears than hers, I said, “You re-
alize, before we can convince Groot to
talk to us we may have to promise to
help get him out.”
“What do you mean by that?”
The man had taken an uncertain
step in our direction. He was dressed
in a black banker’s robe and wore a
sandy-colored mustache, that much I
could see out of the corner of my eye.
Since Jill hadn’t noticed him at all
and I was apparently still looking at
the stall of a fruit vendor, he had no
idea he was being observed. I turned
abruptly toward him, locked eyes, and
crooked an index ﬁnger in the stan-
dard come-here gesture.
He gave a
momentary start, followed by the typ-
ical reﬂexive glance over his shoulder
to make sure he was really the one I
was aiming at, then ﬁrmed his shoul-

ders and looked back at me again.
I
nodded at him, yes, and he came to his
decision.
“Wait a -” Jill said, as she followed
the direction of my gaze and saw the
fellow strolling toward us. “What’s go-
ing on here?”
“This is something else detectives
do,” I told her. “Watch, you might learn
something.”
The name of Groot wasn’t a new one
to me, of course; I’d known that some-
body called Groot who was a big-time
trader in Oolsmouth was connected
with Max and the gang. I’d never met
Groot and I didn’t think he’d know who
I was, unless Max or Karlini had put
something into one of their communi-
cations; the basic plan I’d settled for
on the trip down, though, was to try
to sneak away from Zhardann and Jill
once we’d arrived in Oolsmouth long

enough to make my own contact. Hav-
ing the mention of Groot dropped into
my lap by the guard had changed that
idea quickly enough.
I ﬁgured that anything that affected
Groot badly enough to land him in
jail was important enough to know
about sooner rather than later, and not
only because of the game I was run-
ning with Zhardann and Jill, either. I
knew the boat with the Karlinis and
Shaa was on its way down the river
to Oolsmouth and was due to be show-
ing up reasonably soon.
It stood to
reason that any unexpected attack on
Groot could easily extend itself to en-
wrap them, too. At the moment, events
might actually have placed Jill and
Zhardann on the same side as Groot,
Shaa, and the rest, and me too for that
matter.
The juxtaposition of causes
that had created this situation proba-

bly wouldn’t last long, however, and I
wanted to make as much hay as I could
out of it while it existed.
“Good day,” I said to the man.
“And to you, sir, good day,” he re-
sponded, with a small bow in the direc-
tion of Jill for added measure.
“You are a resident of Oolsmouth, I
take it?”
“Yes, I am,” he said cautiously.
“Ah,” I said.
“That will explain it,
then.”
“I beg your pardon?” said the man.
“Have you eaten?” I asked him.
“I am in something of a rush,” he
said, glancing across the yard at the
jail door. “If you will -”
“We are also not merely standing
around for the sake of our health. Yet
perhaps we have matters worth dis-
cussing together.”
“And what matters might those be?”

I raised my eyebrow at him.
“To
start with, the matter of a particular
incarcerant in the municipal jail over
there, a particular incarcerant by the
name of Groot.”
He ﬁxed me in return with a cool, ap-
praising gaze. What he saw, of course,
were clothes that were somewhat the
worse for recent travel, a clean-shaven
face, somewhat thin in the cheeks, and
a shock of brown hair streaked with
blond.
“What is your business with
Groot? “ he said.
“That may depend on you.”
I could see wheels turning behind
his eyes.
His face was pale from un-
derexposure to the sun, and against
the light skin tones the smudged rings
around his eyes from lack of sleep were
quite apparent. A slight squint and the
tension lines in his forehead ﬁlled out
the appearance of considerable stress.

“Who are you?”
“I will give you the opportunity not
to have asked that question.”
“Nevertheless,” he said, after a mo-
mentary pause, “I have asked it, and I
will ask again, who are you?”
“The potential exists for us to be a
variety of things,” I remarked.
“Po-
tentially we are friends.
Potentially
we could also be the messengers of
trouble: all these potentials are there.
Potentially we are the answer to your
prayers.”
“You mean that in a metaphorical
fashion.” he said, “of course.”
“I do?” I said. “Are you sure you don’t
want lunch?”
“What is your name?”
I sighed.
“Why this insistence on
identities?
Any name I told you,
whether true or not, you would be very
unlikely to recognize; and if you did

know it you would probably be much
happier if you hadn’t heard it spoken.
You’re obviously an intelligent fellow.
I would think that at this stage you
would at least be open-minded where
the possibility of help is concerned.”
Jill had backed off a bit and edged
over to the side where she could watch
my expression and that of the man
simultaneously without being in the
guy’s direct line of sight herself. Her
expression was one of patient confu-
sion. Nevertheless, she was giving me
room to make my play. It would be a
bad moment for my credibility if my in-
tuition walked out on me now. “Help?”
said the man. “What help?”
“Why, for you and your employer, of
course.”
“I believe we have never met be-
fore,” he stated.
“You are not from
Oolsmouth. What do you know about

me and my affairs?”
“You are the principal clerk for the
businessman Groot,” I told him. “As he
is now conﬁned in that dungeon over
there, you are his main link with the
outside world, and so you are attempt-
ing to manage his affairs in the face of
the current reverses.”
“Perhaps a bit of smoked cod would
sit well at that,” said the clerk.
I indicated the location of the ﬁsh-
monger’s stand with an outstretched
arm and he started toward it.
As I
turned to follow, Jill grabbed my arm.
“How did you know all that?” she whis-
pered.
“Who he is, and what’s his
connection with Groot?”
“Omnipotence?”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Jill snorted.
“You know better than I do that there’s
nothing to that old fable.”
“Very well then,” I said. “The clerk

part was easy enough - you did no-
tice the ink-stained index ﬁnger and
the writing case under his arm? He’s
well-dressed, his clothes are fairly new,
and if that sable collar is any indi-
cation they’re expensive, too, so it’s
reasonable to presume he’s not just
some interchangeable bookkeeper but
high-ranking in his own right: hence,
a chief clerk or principal manager or
something on that order. He initially
stopped and paid attention to us be-
fore when you mentioned Groot, but
if you remember what that guard said
back at the bank, your basic person on
the street isn’t eager to be connected
with either the bank or Groot right at
the moment. That made it likely that
a signiﬁcant connection to Groot was
present.
Either this guy was one of
Groot’s accusers, jailers, creditors, or
employees.

“I made the surmise that he’s one
of Groot’s people. By the looks of the
situation at the Oolvaan Mutual Bank
and our conversation with that guard,
this whole deal was sprung on the
victims by surprise, and only in the
last day or so.
If Groot was locked
up without any advance notice, that
would be a messy situation; somebody
would have to be trying to untangle
his affairs on the outside and report-
ing back to him, as well as trying to
react and get him released. From this
fellow’s face he’s been working long
hours; probably even been up all night.
He’s clearly under stress and not for
a pleasant reason, either.
He’s been
rushing around, but hearing what we
were talking about was enough to stop
him in his tracks. When I mentioned
how we might have to get Groot re-
leased, that decided him - that’s when

he started to come over to us.”
“He could be an informer or an agent
of the police,” Jill commented. “Or he
could be one of those responsible for
Groot’s imprisonment.”
“It doesn’t ﬁt the rest of the facts,”
I said. “In the abstract, yes, it could
be, but if you put it together with ev-
erything else it doesn’t make sense.
For that matter, you might think that
as long as they were locking up Groot
they could have swept up his staff, too,
but even then there’d be somebody left
walking the streets, and when you get
right down to it that kind of major
grab is probably more than a demo-
cratic city like Oolsmouth could get
away with unless there’s an insurrec-
tion or some other crisis going on at the
same time. Still. I’m willing to admit
I may have made a bit of a leap, based
on the available facts and my reading

of the situation.”
“You mean you didn’t actually know
all of that, you only guessed?” said Jill.
“I thought deduction was a pure science
with no chance involved; just follow the
facts and interpret them as appropri-
ate.”
“What kind of ivory-tower world do
you think this is, anyway?” The clerk
was looking over his shoulder at us
from his position at the ﬁshmonger’s,
so I crossed over the yard and joined
him.
I paid his bill and picked up a
small bucket of ale and an apple while
I was at it, then led him to one of the
stone benches arranged in rows next
to the street.
Jill reappeared with a
roasted chicken.
The clerk had also
gotten an onion bread and a sliced
tomato to go along with his cod and
after a moment of ﬁddling he had the
various ingredients stacked to his sat-

isfaction. “So,” I said. “Tell us about
it.”
The clerk chewed and swallowed. “I
am Julio,” he said, “and as you know
my master is Haalsen Groot, who now
languishes in municipal captivity. You
also know, I take it, about the Bank of
the New Dawn, the Oolvaan Mutual
Bank, and the freezing and conﬁsca-
tion of the Haalsen Traders assets?”
“Somewhat,” I said, “but presume we
don’t know whatever is most interest-
ing.
I’d appreciate hearing anything
new you have discovered beyond the ob-
vious.”
“I don’t know you,” Julio repeated.
“Thank you for the lunch, and I com-
pliment you on your perspicacity, but
these things don’t explain why I should
tell you anything.
I don’t know who
you are, where you come from, or what
your interest is in this. How do I know

you’re not in league with those who
seek to destroy us?”
“What point would there be in send-
ing us around to try to be sneaky when
your enemies have already gotten ev-
erything they’re after through a frontal
assault?”
Julio shrugged. “Gods are involved.”
“Yes,” Jill said. “We know that.”
“Oh,” said Julio thoughtfully.
“Oh.
Yet when, ah, gods are, ah, ah -”
“Go ahead,” I said. “Speak freely. We
won’t bite you. Sure, the rules of rea-
son sometimes go out the door when
you get mixed up with gods, but that’s
all the more reason to share your bur-
den with us.”
“I’m not certain I understand why
that makes any sense,” said Julio.
“May I have some of that?”
I passed him the bucket of ale, which
I had really bought for that speciﬁc

purpose in the ﬁrst place.
“It makes
sense because you’d have access to ex-
pert advice and a vantage point that
would otherwise be closed to you, and
the possibility of a strong arm raised
on your behalf. And in any case how
much worse off could you be?”
He ﬁnished his swig and wiped his
mustache. “There is that, I suppose. I
just don’t know.”
Jill had apparently gotten bored
with the conversation since it frankly
appeared to be going nowhere, and at
the moment she had her whole concen-
tration on dismembering her chicken.
I decided to go for it. I raised my eye-
brow on the side away from Jill and
said, “It’s not like I just walked off
a riverboat and claimed to be an old
friend of Groot’s, but you will admit
that he might have friends who have
not yet revealed themselves, eh?”

Julio narrowed one eye as if the
squint would let him see better and
pursed his lips, then glanced quickly
at Jill.
I frowned at him and gave a
small shake of my head, no. He gazed
off at the street trafﬁc: then, appar-
ently reaching his decision, he nodded
slowly to himself.
“Very well,” said
Julio. “I will conﬁde in you in the hope
that - well, I will conﬁde in you. Ev-
erything about this matter is quite ir-
regular, you understand, unreasonable
seizure without due process of state
and so forth.
We feel that there was
absolutely no justiﬁcation for arrest-
ing Meester Groot or conﬁscating his
assets. We feel, and our legal adviser
agrees, that this was done in outright
contravention of the laws and prac-
tice of Oolsmouth, as well as of valid
commercial sensibility.
Our lawyer
has been attempting to unearth the

authority and pretext behind all this,
unfortunately without notable success.
With slightly more promising results,
he and I both have been meeting with
Council members in an attempt to con-
vene a full Council session.
As you
know, Meester Groot is a member of
Council himself.”
“What do these other Councillors
have to say for themselves?”
“To a person, they’ve been quite sur-
prised and distressed. A few of them
have also been concerned for their own
security. Even more so, they are trou-
bled at signs the gods may be meddling
directly in the affairs of Oolsmouth.
They feel that would mean nothing but
trouble.”
“That’s certainly a prudent way to
look at it,” I said.
Coming from me,
for some reason that remark didn’t
seem to reassure him.
“Why hasn’t

the Council put an immediate stop to
these goings-on, then, especially if as
you say it’s been accomplished against
the law?”
“Politics,” said Julio. “Meester Groot
is one of the stronger voices on the
Council and his incarceration shifts
certain groupings and the entire inter-
nal balance. Councillor Dooglas, who
opposes him, is another pole of the
Council, yet he has not made himself
available over the past day to any but
his closest intimates. And then there
are the gods.”
True, it was the soul of wisdom
to tread softly when the gods were
mucking around in your vicinity: just
look at me. “You have to admit these
Councillors aren’t necessarily idiots,”
I said.
“There is a ﬁne balance that
is useful to maintain between directly
confronting a scheme that the gods

may be wrapped up in and ﬁnding
some clever way of turning the tables.
Still, your Councillors’ natural instinct
to hide under the porch is clearly not
what you’re looking to them for at the
moment. Another thing that is some-
times helpful, sometimes disastrous,
and always risky is recruiting another
god to oppose the designs of those who
are on the other side, if there aren’t
more of them involved already.
“I see you shudder.” I went on.
“I
take it that’s not a course you prefer
to pursue. There’s also a perfectly nat-
ural tendency for people to consider
how they want to deal with those folks
who are already tied in with the gods,
whether they want to give such folks
a clean pass or get closer to them, or
even whether to go for an out-and-out
alliance.
Even the gods themselves
build coalitions. Or so they say.”

“My master,” Julio said, speaking
carefully, “as a matter of philosophy,
prefers to avoid troubling the gods on
his behalf, either directly or through
intermediaries. “
“That’s very noble of him, I’m sure,”
remarked Jill sarcastically, diverting
her attention from the chicken.
“Ah, yes,” said Julio, “thank you. We
do feel, nevertheless, that we have the
situation well in hand, and our prepa-
rations are advancing -”
“Right,” I said.
“Save your voice;
we’ve seen how well your preparations
are advancing. What have you discov-
ered about the other forces involved
here?”
“There is the Bank of the New Dawn,
but I assume you know all about that.”
“Don’t assume. As I said. we’re inter-
ested in your perceptions. What about
this bank?”

Julio washed down a thick slice of
cod sandwich with a healthy swig of ale.
“I had never heard of the Bank of the
New Dawn before this started, but un-
til I began to investigate I had no idea
how new it actually was, or in fact how
old.”
“What are you talking about?” said
Jill.
Jill was a natural for the good
cop/bad cop game, as long as she al-
ways got to play the bad one.
Julio
swallowed, this time without any food
in his mouth. “You didn’t know? Ah,
well, ‘New Dawn’ is a new name for an
old institution, the Oracular Treasury
Trust.”
Jill drew her breath in sharply. Out
of the corner of my vision I could see
her glance quickly toward me with an
expression that mixed surprise and, I
thought, some fear; a roasted chicken

leg hung momentarily forgotten in her
hand.
“Indeed,” I observed, and took
a thoughtful munch from my apple.
“That is interesting.” Now that Jill had
had a chance to recover her composure,
I looked over at her. “I think we should
bring friend Julio a bit more into our
conﬁdence, don’t you? You see,” I said,
turning back to Julio, “our interest
lies primarily in the area of banking,
including ﬁnancial transactions, nego-
tiable securities and their exchanges,
and various considerations relating to
business relationships in these areas
between the divine and mortal pop-
ulations.
My own principal area of
specialization concerns mergers, acqui-
sitions, and takeovers, both amicable
and otherwise, in the institutions in-
volved, and, of course, in the nuances
of the patronage relationships brought
into play.

“While you might have presumed
that these institutions and their pa-
trons could freely prosecute whatever
commercial dealings they choose,” I
continued, warming more to the topic
I was making up from whole cloth
as I went along, a habit I seemed to
be falling into more and more of late,
“working out any differences or dis-
agreements through negotiation, guile,
or, ahem, force, there is in fact a cer-
tain level of, shall we say, status quo
that must be maintained. The patron
element is not, as we all know, all-
powerful, and so the restraints of good
sense are also the bonds of prudence. If
one party to the social contract grows
too obnoxious, to put it plainly, the
other party might feel forced for its
part to resist, and there is also the pos-
sibility of dissension within the party
itself.
Our role, then, is to monitor

events, and if necessary to intercede
when a speciﬁc situation appears to
be getting out of hand.” On second
thought, maybe I hadn’t been mak-
ing all of it up from nothing.
That
stuff about the Abdicationists and Con-
servationists I’d heard from Jill and
Zhardann - if that wasn’t dissension
within the ranks of the gods, what was
it? It had sure sounded like more than
just a debating point.
“You don’t say,” said Julio. “Do you
think that this particular situation ap-
pears to be, ah, gelling out of hand?”
“It does seem to have that potential.
Don’t you agree?” I remarked to Jill.
She was looking at me with an ex-
pression of unpleasant astonishment.
“We will have to discuss it,” she told
me.
I had been keeping an eye on the peo-
ple in the courtyard while we talked,

just on general principle, and so I had
seen a young man emerge from the en-
trance to the jail and stride off toward
the street, glancing anxiously around
him.
Now, his gaze fell in our direc-
tion. At the sight of our little group, he
turned and made his way vigorously
toward us, arms pumping at his sides,
halfway between a fast walk and a
slow jog. “Are you expecting someone?”
I asked Julio.
He peered over his shoulder in the
direction I was looking, then set the re-
mains of his cod to one side and rose
to his feet. The man skidded to a halt
next to him. “Excuse me, sir,” he said
in a pant, “I was sent to ﬁnd you.
I
work at the prison, for Warder Clang,
he’s the one who’s -”
“Yes, yes,” said Julio, “I remember
you, go on, what is it?”
“There’s been a spot of trouble, you

see, sir, trouble with your Meester
Groot, not his fault, mind you, but
trouble nevertheless, and -”
“Get yourself together, man,” Julio
said, his voice rising. I handed Julio
the ale bucket; I ﬁgured there was
enough still sloshing around in the
bottom to make a useful impact. The
messenger took a deep guzzle and
wiped his mouth with the back of his
arm.
“Thank you kindly, sir,” the messen-
ger said.
“The warder thought you
should know that a party came to us
to take away your Meester Groot, to
put him to the question, so they said.
Warder Clang -”
“They what?” said Julio. “Where is
he now, where did they take him?
I
must -”
“Don’t be getting yourself in such a
state, sir,” said the messenger.
“As I

was trying to tell you, Warder Clang
sent them away.
He didna have or-
ders, and even though their warrant
was signed by Meester Dooglas for the
Council when your Meester Groot said
the paper was forged, well -”
“I’d best be off,” Julio said to me.
“I think that’s a sound idea,” I told
him. “Perhaps I, and perhaps also my
associates, will pursue certain matters
with this Meester Dooglas, as well as
this Bank of the New Dawn or what-
ever else it’s calling itself by now. How
shall we reach you if necessary?”
Julio dug in his writing case and
withdrew a small card with an address
already lettered on it, then quickly
scrawled another on the back.
“You
do read, don’t you?” he asked as an
afterthought as he handed the card to
me.
Seeing as the matter was as much

his responsibility as mine, I took a
quick glance at the card; the penman-
ship was legible enough, but after all
he was a clerk.
“It won’t be a prob-
lem,” I started to say, but by the time
I looked up Julio was already out of
easy earshot, crossing the yard with
the messenger from the jail.
Jill was staring at me. “I don’t be-
lieve you!” she said.
“Nevertheless,” I said, “I still seem to
exist. What’s the problem? You don’t
believe I can really read?
Or is that
not what you’re complaining about this
time? You still have some problem with
my methods? We found out some perti-
nent -”
“That’s completely immaterial, next
to your nonexistent sense of judgment!
Airing secrets to a person, and in pub-
lic - you’re close to the edge, and if you
don’t realize it then you’re already over

the edge, whether you really are an Ab-
dicationist or not. Even I didn’t know
you had that much gall, I’ll grant you
that.”
“Look,” I said.
“We’re clearly up
against the patron of this New Dawn
group, or more accurately the Oracular
Treasury Trust; we need all the infor-
mation we can get. If there’s a problem
with this Julio fellow we can always
eradicate him, and how many other
people is he likely to mention anything
to? We can certainly exterminate a few
more if necessary. But I don’t think it’s
a concern in the ﬁrst place, especially
when you consider the misdirection.”
“I’ll give you this much, too,” Jill said.
“That agency you invented isn’t such a
bad idea at that, the one we’re suppos-
edly part of.
Pure audacity, but that
always was one of your strong points.
Although how you’d imagine that any-

one with a mind would be taken in by
a fable like that -”
“I chose my audience.”
“I suppose you’re right; he was just
a man, after all, doesn’t know the least
bit about anything important.
You
should know full well, maybe better
than anyone, how difﬁcult it is to get
cooperation on anything,
especially
without immediate payback.
Much
less toward the idea of any kind of
centralized authority.
A de facto hi-
erarchy is one thing, but regulation
is quite another.” She shook her head.
“How the Abdicationists think anyone
would ever agree to a proposal like this
is absurd.
And they call themselves
moderates -hah!
You’re not really an
Abdicationist, are you?”
“What,” I said, “and have you think
I’m absurd?
You know better than
to draw an inference about my true

thoughts from some remark that hap-
pens to drip from my mouth, surely.
Expediency, prosecution of a plot, and
truth are quite different, it should
go without saying; altogether differ-
ent. Are you quite ﬁnished with that
chicken?”
A pile of gnawed bones sat in the
pool of grease in the midst of the wrap-
ping paper in which the chicken had
been served; very little meat, if any,
remained, but for all I knew she liked
to devour her food down to the skele-
ton.
Jill stood up and moved away
from the remains, folding her arms
over her chest.
“Very well, yes,” she
said. “Is it now time to visit Groot, 0
Great Detective?”
Oolsmouth so far had been a re-
markably clean city; part of their civic
ostentation, no doubt, was to employ a
refuse disposal squad. They had even

provided a designated trash container
too tall for the roving dogs over on one
side of the courtyard. As much to an-
noy Jill as to assuage my own sense
of order, and to eliminate the attack
on my aesthetic sense mounted by a
heap of ragged bones on an otherwise
undisturbed marble bench, I carefully
took up the garbage by the corners of
its wrapping paper and brought it to
the trash area, which was only a few
strides away.
Jill followed me, unbe-
lievingly. “Your mind has rotted,” said
Jill. “There is clearly no doubt about
it.”
“Fine,” I said. “Then go away.”
Her sigh was more of a “humph.”
“Groot?” she said.
“No,” I said. “Julio was enough for
now, and he’ll be busy enough himself
with Groot for the time being.
Let’s
check in with Zhardann.”

“First Groot, then no Groot - why
don’t you make up your mind?”
“The one that’s rotten?” I said.
She snarled at me and headed for
the horse park. If I was trying to an-
noy her, it appeared I was succeeding.
Actually, I was trying to annoy her,
at least a little.
I didn’t want her to
start feeling happy I was around, or
worse yet, comfortable.
As long as
she thought we were married, I didn’t
want her to get the idea that maybe
whatever was wrong between us was
on the way to being reconciled.
We redeemed the horses and she
took the lead; Zhardann had told her
where he was setting up shop but
hadn’t bothered to clue me in. I waited
until Jill’s concentration was ﬁrmly
on the twisting of streets and inter-
sections before I asked her. “What do
you want to tell me about the Oracular

Treasury Trust?”
“Nothing,” she said.
“I don’t know
a thing.” The expression that ﬂipped
across her face, though, told me some-
thing else.
What was she hiding?
Probably
something having to do with the Orac-
ular Trust’s patron.
Was I supposed
to know the identity of that god? No,
I didn’t think so; she knew something
that she didn’t expect me to know. But
if I heard the name of the patron, I bet
she thought I’d recognize him or her,
or more to the point that the god Jill
thought I was would know who this
other god was.
The way things were
going, though, I’d ﬁnd it out eventually.
Either she hadn’t thought that part
through or she saw some value in keep-
ing the information from me as long as
she could.
Zhardann had found lodgings in a

predominantly residential section of
the city not far from the central plaza
we’d just visited, or for all I knew he
may have actually owned the place.
The three-story house sat solidly on
the comer lot of the Lane of Wealth, a
street lined with similar houses, each
with a neat gentriﬁed garden out front
that was fenced off from the cobble-
stone sidewalks by a chest-high stone
wall topped with an iron grating. The
gratings all had clever designs worked
into them, coats of arms and heraldic
beasts and long trailing vines and
whatnot, but their vertical bars ended
with sharp polished spear-heads:
if
I knew Zhardann, that detail alone
would have been enough to close the
lease for him.
One of the servants
who’d accompanied us down from Roos-
ing Oolvaya unbolted the side gate and
Jill and I rode down the carriageway

toward the stables at the rear of the
house. “See to the horses and freshen
up, why don’t you, and then we’ll meet
in the house,” Jill told me, swinging
to the ground under an awning that
stretched from the back door.
“The last thing any horse in his right
mind would want is me seeing to him,”
I said, easing myself out of my saddle
as well. The servant had relocked the
gate behind us, and he now took both
sets of reins to lead the horses away.
Jill gave him a dirty look.
“Just freshen up, then,” said Jill, “or
do you have some moral objection to
cleanliness as well?”
“I wouldn’t say that, not in the least.”
A line of round stepping-stones led
from the dirt driveway across the lawn
and through the ﬂower beds around
the side of the house; a gardener was
working his way along it, clipping at

shrubs with a pair of shears. A trail of
cut leaves snaked behind him all the
way to our own position.
I stretched
out an arm to indicate the gardener.
“The mere sight of cleanliness in action,
of order arising from chaos through the
artistry of skill and hard work, brings
a smile to my lips and ﬁlls my heart
with gladness. But, as you well know,
I take nothing to extremes, and I must
say I’m feeling remarkably energized,
not to say downright chipper, at the
moment. If you feel no need to ‘freshen’
yourself, as you put it, I can’t see how
I can do less than follow your example.
Shall we check in with Zhardann?”
“Ooch, you’re impossible,” she said.
She did, however, appear to give up the
idea of trying to decoy me away while
she talked with Zhardann ﬁrst without
me being around. We scraped off our
boots and entered through a sunroom

that led into the kitchen, where I could
see the cook stowing vegetables in a
cupboard.
The cook raised her head
when she heard us stomp in, jerked
her head toward the front of the house,
and said, “Upstairs, in the study.” Jill
had already headed straight in that
direction, into a hall lined with por-
traits of somebody’s ancestors that led
past the entrances to a pair of rooms
on each side and then to the entry
hall and front door.
One side of the
hall was taken up by a straight stair-
case with an ornate banister carved
from some dark wood; by the shine of
it one of the servants had spent the
morning moving up it with a barrel
of wax.
Up the stairs we went, past
another row of portraits and a detailed
mythical battle scene, full of dragons
chewing on sky-carriages and dodg-
ing lightning that rained down from

the heavens onto the muddy conﬂict
below and clichéd boilerplate of that
sort.
The staircase continued to the
top ﬂoor, but we departed at the end
of the ﬁrst ﬂight, walking about the
well in the ﬂoor to reach the room at
the front corner on the right. Jill eased
the door open, peered around the jamb,
and then quietly entered.
Windows ﬁlled out the two outside
walls, overlooking the middle branches
of a tree on the right side and the front
lawn, spiked fence, and street on the
other.
The ceiling was paneled with
squares of the same dark wood as the
staircase. The ceiling panels were sep-
arated by rails and hanging bosses, but
since the second story was high there
was still enough headroom to move
freely beneath them.
Zhardann sat
in a comfortably overstuffed armchair
in front of an unlit ﬁreplace topped

off with a marble mantle supporting
a loudly ticking clock and an array
of stuffed birds.
The picture over
the hearth showed a whiskered man
dressed in forest greens brandishing
a bow against a backdrop of trees; he
was surrounded on a patch of meadow
by heaps of bloody birds, an arrow
protruding from each, and two more
were still falling limply from the sky,
one directly above his head.
I didn’t
recognize the man in the picture, and
for that matter I didn’t exactly recog-
nize Zhardann either.
The top part
of his body, from above his head to
his waist, was shrouded by, well, a
cocoon, or at least the kind of cocoon
that might have resulted if a battal-
ion of silkworms had been using wisps
of cloud-cotton instead of silk for the
job.
The windings of cloud actually
continued down his legs to the ﬂoor,

now that I took a good look, but the
lower stretches were wispier, letting
the outlines of his legs show through.
Jill sank silently into another arm-
chair next to the ﬁreplace and fac-
ing• Zhardann’s while I stretched out
on a small sofa.
I’d initially thought
Zhardann might be in a trance. Now
I saw that was clearly less than the
whole truth, for the shape inside the
cocoon was moving, stretching, and ap-
parently gesturing as though he was
talking - without making a sound - to
someone who wasn’t there. The sight
didn’t rufﬂe Jill, though, so I saw no
reason to let it bother me.
I watched Zhardann’s gauze-wrapped
antics carefully all the same. I didn’t
have to watch all that long, as it turned
out. After a few moments, Zhardann
sat back and stopped his writhing, and
the cloud enveloping his body began to

spin as though caught up in a sudden
wind. Then, like a magician grabbing a
sheet and pulling it upward, making a
point from the center, letting the loose
ends ﬂutter behind, and causing the
sheet to vanish point-ﬁrst into a hole
in the air, the cloud sucked itself off
Zhardann, rose above his head, and
disappeared in a rolling puff.
The newly revealed Zhardann was
seated at ease with his arms folded
across his chest, apparently none the
worse for the experience and rather
pleased with himself into the bargain.
“Guess who’s behind this New Dawn
business?” he said to Jill.
“The Oracular Treasury Trust,” she
told him. Myself, I thought her tone of
voice was a bit too ﬁrm and a bit too
strained, as though she was trying to
warn him of something, but he didn’t
seem to be paying as much attention

to her as usual; maybe he was still un-
der the aftereffects of the spell of the
cloud. Frankly, I had taken the cloud
to heart, too.
Just because I hadn’t
seen much sorcerizing over the past
few days didn’t mean it wasn’t there,
at least in potential. It wouldn’t do to
lose track of the fact that where magic
was concerned these two were heavy-
weight masters.
Events might have
unfolded conventionally enough so far
in our relationship, but that didn’t
mean they’d stay that way.
“Of
course,”
said
Zhardann,
“of
course. You’ve been busy, too, haven’t
you? I can’t say I expected to ﬁnd his
hand in this, but then it’s not entirely
a surprise either, is it. Focasti thinks
there may be an additional operator
at work, but even she agrees it’s really
his play. Well, he may have carved off
more than he can handle this time. I’ve

been in touch with some of the others
who have an interest in these things,
and they’re responsive - the setup even
looks strong enough to mount an up-
and-down challenge.
With the right
preparation, we may be able to ma-
neuver him into submission without
actually having to use a frontal as-
sault.
Wouldn’t that be something?
Sapriel on the defensive for once?”
I’d been looking at him but watching
her as well, so when Zhardann said the
name “Sapriel” and Jill gasped, shot
him a dose of eye-powered venom, and
immediately turned her gaze on me to
capture my response, I’d already pre-
pared myself. I’d been ready for some-
thing of the sort: the fact that I didn’t
know Sapriel from Haddo was com-
pletely beside the point.
“Sapriel,” I
said, letting the syllables ooze from my
mouth as though they’d been steeped

in the savory juice of malice. “Indeed,
Sapriel. I wouldn’t at all mind getting
Sapriel in a situation where he was
at someone’s mercy, myself.” Jill pre-
sumably thought that Sapriel and I
had had encounters in the past, and
my guess was that we were supposed
to be enemies. “This may be more fun
than I’d anticipated. What do you bet
that this guy Dooglas is his local front
man?”
Jill was a trooper, though; she rolled
with it. “Ally, front man, dupe, what
does it matter?”
Zhardann, who ﬁnally seemed to
be returning to earth, said, “Dooglas?
Who’s Dooglas?”
“I’ll explain in a moment,” Jill told
him.
“The obvious plan is for you to
continue developing what you’ve be-
gun while my husband moves ahead
with the mortals, starting with Doo-

glas.” She turned to me.
“Stay away
from these banks, and especially from
the Trust. If Sapriel sees you - need I
say more?”
“No,” I said thoughtfully.
“No, you
needn’t, at that.”
“If Soaf Pasook turns up, we may
be able to use him, too,” she contin-
ued, but by then I was being overtaken
by my own thoughts.
As if it wasn’t
already bad enough worrying about
the sticky situation I’d be in if I did
run across Pasook, now I had to worry
about this Sapriel, too. With luck, if I
was going to meet either one of them. I
would . . .
The problem with trying to plan this
way was that I realized I’d been relying
way too heavily on luck: I was clearly
overdrawn in that department.
My
luck couldn’t hold out forever. When it
turned, I just hoped -

Aw, hell, I thought.
All I could do
was keep playing it bounce to bounce.
But who was Sapriel?

Chapter11
IN THE AIR
THE SUN HAD YET TO MAKE ITS
APPEARANCE, but the sky had light-
ened enough with its advance-guard
radiance for Jurtan and Max to get to
work.
“Have you ever seen anything
like this before?” asked Jurtan, cran-
ing his neck upward and squinting his
eyes at different angles in a vain at-
tempt to catch a solid glimpse of the

object hanging invisibly overhead.
“Not enough like this, no.” Max was
back at the edge of the low island in
the middle of the swamp, holding his
thumb up at the end of his outstretched
arm and sighting past it in various di-
rections. “That has to be an internal
refraction unit up there; nothing else
makes sense.
There was a case once
where a cache of something-or-other
was hidden by a refraction setup, only
that one was slung by a cable from
the underside of an overhanging cliff.
Once you’d ﬁgured it out and managed
to get to the top of the cliff, you could
theoretically slide down the cable to
the thing and get into it from there.”
“Couldn’t you use the cable to pull it
up? Or just cut the cable and catch it
from underneath?”
“Sure,” Max said, “if you wanted to
set it off. Of course you couldn’t see the

cable itself either. There was about a
thousand-foot drop down the face of the
cliff, too, as I remember, and you had to
hack your way to the top through the
ice while hanging from pitons.”
“Why would anyone be crazy enough
to hide something that way in the ﬁrst
place?”
“So it wouldn’t get found; what do
you think? Or do you mean why would
they put themselves through all the
overhead they’d need to actually put it
there?” Max began to stroll clockwise
around the island, shoving his way
through the tall grass.
“A lot of the
problems go away if you can ﬂy.”
“People can ﬂy?”
“Not usually,” Max admitted. “You’ve
got your levitation spells and so forth,
but there you’re talking truly exor-
bitant energy costs, and you’ve got
more ways to do them wrong than you

can - well let’s just say there are good
reasons they’re not very popular.” He
reached the ﬁrst of the island’s gnarled
mangroves, its roots trailing off into
the water, bent over for a close look at
its bark, carved a small scraping off
with his knife, and launched himself
up the trunk. He disappeared into the
maze of branches. The tree shuddered,
twigs and leaves cascaded down, and
then Jurtan saw Max’s head pop up out
of the top of the canopy. After glancing
around, he disappeared again, only to
quickly reemerge at the bottom in the
midst of another cloud of leaves.
He
set off for the next tree. “The person
who set it up doesn’t have to be the
one who does the ﬂying, of course,” he
remarked.
“Like
that
big
bird
of
Karlini’s,
right?” Jurtan said. “You think that’s
how you’re supposed to reach this one?”

“It’s a possibility.
If I’d built it,
though, I’d have made sure it could
recognize me, say with an amulet or
an acknowledgment code or something
of that sort, so it would just lower it-
self to the ground when I showed up.
I wouldn’t want to go through some
ludicrous gyrations ever time I needed
to come or go.”
“Do you think your amulet ... ?”
“Hasn’t seemed to do much since
we’ve been here,” Max said, “has it?
Anyway, that’s not one of its functions,
at least not as far as I know. Another
possibility is there’s a ladder hidden
around here someplace. It’d have to be
an awfully tall ladder from the looks of
it, though.”
Jurtan now had to shade his eyes
against the ﬁrst direct glow of the
sun. He walked around so the sun was
at his back and stared upward again.

“What holds it up?”
“What do you think holds it up?”
Max was on his third tree now. This
time, though, the trunk resisted the
cut of his knife, and even gave off a
small thunk when he jabbed it with
the point.
He pulled down a branch
and peered intently at its leaves.
Was this a trick question?
“Uh,
magic, right?”
“You have any idea how strong a
ﬁeld spell you’d need to keep a couple-
ton object hanging in the air indeﬁ-
nitely?
Damping instabilities alone
would drive you crazy. Let’s just say I
sure wouldn’t want to try it.”
“But I thought this Iskendarian guy
was even smarter than you.”
“That’s not the way I would have put
it, kid.” Max’s voice came from midway
up the tree. “You feed a critique like
that to most spell casters and all of a

sudden you ﬁnd out you’re facing the
rest of your life as a kumquat or some
squishy kind of amphibian.”
“I’m sorry,” Jurtan said, “but didn’t
you tell me -”
“I
don’t
think
even
Iskendarian
could have pulled it off.
In any case,
he didn’t.
Those tests I was running
last night not only conﬁrmed this isn’t
a real healthy place to be doing spell-
work, they would have gone off the
scale if there was a ﬁeld of that magni-
tude around.”
“Something’s got to be holding it up.
A big magnet under the ground?”
Max eased himself carefully out of
the leaves at the top of the tree and
felt around him in the air.
“Ah-hah!”
he said after a moment. He leaned over
and began to trace a ﬂat surface in pan-
tomime with both hands.
“Okay,”
Jurtan
said
thoughtfully.

“Not a magnet. What about -”
Max rapped on the air with the hilt
of his knife. The air clunked. “A py-
lon. It’s grafted into the tree. Probably
swings over like an arch. Most likely
we’ll ﬁnd two more of them at equal in-
tervals around the shore.”
“Hey! - that’s pretty neat. You going
to climb up it now?”
“Too slippery,” said Max, running
his hand along the invisible surface.
“Could be a side effect of the refraction
ﬁeld.” He retreated back into the tree.
“With all this swamp gas, you could
lift a balloon, couldn’t you? Or a kite!
What about a kite?”
“You feel any wind?” Max dropped to
the ground from the lowest branch and
shook off the leaves. “I’ll admit I was
thinking about a kite myself, and I’ve
always been fond of balloons, although
we don’t have nearly enough fabric be-

tween us to build one big enough.” He
reached their small camp next to the
beached boat and began rummaging
through the packs. One of the grazing
horses ambled over to gaze dubiously
over his shoulder.
“I could run across the island drag-
ging the kite.” Jurtan suggested. “Or
we could let one of the horses pull it.
The kite doesn’t have to stay up, just
hop high enough for the rope to go over
the - oh.”
Max had come up with his machine-
crossbow and was winding its spring
with the foot-pedal. An arrow in place,
he clipped the reel of line to the hook at
the back of the ﬂetching, walked back
toward the tree with the pylon, sighted,
and ﬁred. The arrow sprang into the
air, nosed over in a neat parabola, and
plunged down, dragging behind it the
light rope humming out of its reel.

As the arrow embedded itself upside
down in the soft ground the rope hes-
itated, still keeping to the line of the
parabolic trail, ﬂuttered, and began
to fall, then suddenly paused in the
middle and grew taut. “Now we’ll see
if that column’s got a razor edge,” Max
commented, just as the line parted into
two segments at the very top. Each one
ﬂapped separately to the ground.
“Not surprising,” said Max. “I’d have
done the same thing myself. Anyway, it
was worth a try.”
“So what now? We try the kite?”
“No, the arrow again, only this time
I aim for the center where the pylons
meet, now that I know approximately
where it is from the curve of the col-
umn.” He rolled up the loose end of
cord, detached it from the arrow, wiped
off the mud, loaded and sighted, and
again let ﬂy.

The arrow was still heading upward
as it passed the center of the island
when they suddenly saw it stop in the
air with a small thunk and bounce
back. It had barely tumbled ﬁve feet
before it hit something else, fell ﬂat,
and started to slide down a smooth
curve, dragging the cable behind it.
The cord was outlining the surface of
a sphere that curved away to Max’s
left.
Heading toward the right, he
broke into a run, still carefully hold-
ing the crossbow, as above him the
rope drooping across the invisible sus-
pended sphere paused in its slide. The
arrow dove into the ground. The rope,
though, was remaining up.
Max completed a complete circuit
around the hanging rope, passing the
embedded arrow pathway around his
path.
The cord hovered in the air,
apparently unsupported by anything

solid.
On one end the arrow held it
down like a tent-peg. From the arrow,
the cable angled up in a straight line
to a point perhaps forty feet overhead,
bent over the curved top of a spheri-
cal surface, looped once around itself,
outlining a circular space two feet in di-
ameter, and then led downward again
in the same manner, displaced a third
of the way around the sphere from its
entrance.
It terminated in the cross-
bow reel Max still held. “Let’s get that
net,” Max announced, carefully setting
the crossbow down in the grass.
They unloaded the decrepit net they
had originally found camouﬂaging the
boat. “You’re actually going up there?”
Jurtan asked with a note of incredulity.
“You want to do it instead?” Max
adjusted his re-sorted knapsack on his
back. “That is the whole point of this
exercise, in case you weren’t paying

attention along the way.”
“You really enjoy this stuff.”
“Regular
storehouse
of
rhetorical
questions, aren’t you,” Max muttered.
He hefted a coil of heavier rope over to
the upended arrow and tied one end of
it around the arrowhead. “Watch that
it pays out smoothly,” he told Jurtan.
“What’s the matter with the rope
that’s already up there?”
Max began pulling, carefully wind-
ing the slender cord back onto the
crossbow reel. “See how thin it is? The
stuff’s strong, but it’s a pain getting a
good climbing grip.” The heavier cable
rose into the air, navigated the loop,
and sunk back down into Max’s grasp.
One of the wizened trees had dug in
not far from his position: after disen-
gaging the thin cord from the new thick
segment, he pulled the free end over to
the tree and tied it securely around the

trunk. Then he crossed back to Jurtan.
Jurtan was looking across at the knot
around the tree.
“What am I supposed to do if you lose
your hold and -” The rope jerked at his
feet. Where had Max gone this -
Max was already halfway up, his
hand-over-hand grip backstopped by
the loop of rope slapped around his
waist and dropping loosely between
his feet.
He scurried up another ten
feet, then slowed. Just above his head,
the cable curved over across the invis-
ible sphere.
Max slowly reached out
toward it.
“Huh,” he said, again running his
hand along a pantomime surface. “Look
like it is a full ball. I thought it might
be ﬂat on the bottom.” At least it wasn’t
rotating, and it hadn’t zapped him, ei-
ther. Of course, those had been the safe
odds. It hadn’t fried the birds; they’d

only bashed into it.
“What if the door’s on the bottom’?”
Max slithered his way up the slope,
ignoring Mont. He’d been in a lot of odd
situations, but for sheer disorientation
value this one was no slouch.
Even
with his nose up against the surface it
was thoroughly transparent - he was
looking down at the ground through
an unsupported drop in apparent igno-
rance of the law of gravity. But then
he’d reached the top and was outright
sitting on air, although it felt more
like polished ice than air, though. Sup-
ported by the loop around his body, he
locked his legs around the lower rope
and let loose with his hands.
This promised to be one of the trick-
ier parts of the whole enterprise. Be-
fore leaving the ground, he had cut a
short length of free cable. He ﬁshed it
out of his shirt now, passed it around

the other rope where it crossed itself in
its ring around the central support pil-
lar, and made several knots using both
hands, which was the only way to do
it unless you were going to pull some
old fakir trick. Then he ﬂipped another,
longer length of rope around the ﬁrst
one, sat up against the pillar, and knot-
ted the rope around his waist.
“That looks weird,” called Mont.
“Tell me about it.” A glance down
told Max that, regardless of his kibitz-
ing, Mont had gotten ready with the
net. Max hauled in the dangling length
of rope and the net came up tied to the
end.
Although its tails were certainly
ratty, a closer inspection had revealed
that the camouﬂage netting was in
hardier shape than his initial once-
over had implied. On the ground Max
had sliced it halfway through from

one edge to its center.
With this slit
eased around the central pylon, the
net draped itself over the sides of the
sphere and hung free at its lower hem.
A moment more of tying loose ends
together across the long slice, and Max
had an actual visible surface to work
on.
He cast loose from his roped-in
perch and started creeping across the
scaffold.
Max was certainly hoping the door
wasn’t on the bottom, and not only be-
cause he didn’t want to give the kid
the satisfaction of having called it. The
door could still be reached even in that
position but it would take some tricky
rappelling that Max was not excited
about at all; it was really too early
in the morning for that sort of thing,
not to mention a bit gratuitous to boot.
In any case, bottom entry would have
presented the designer with some sig-

niﬁcant problems for the layout of
the interior if he or she didn’t want
things rolling out every time the door
was opened. The ball wasn’t tiny, but
with a diameter of ten or twelve feet
it wasn’t exactly built for entertaining
either. Then again, the use of an ap-
propriately suspended lower deck and
a guard-rail could have . . . ah!
The hideout didn’t use second quan-
tum level spell-work; Max had learned
that much from the absence of the
characteristic emission spectrum dur-
ing his investigations of the previous
evening. He hadn’t been able to learn
much more with his nose pressed up
against it. True, he could now feel the
refraction zone matrix. The fact that
the optical discontinuity was standing
an inch or so out from the actual un-
derlying surface on which his weight
was resting was a disconcerting effect

in its own right, if not a totally un-
expected one.
The underside of the
netting where it came closest to the
surface fuzzed out as it dipped through
the discontinuity and tried to vanish,
as did Max’s own hands and other body
parts. With his face pressed right up
against the interface, the clear view of
the ground took on the blur of a cloudy
crystal or the reﬂection of a mirror tar-
nished enough to show its own silver
on top of the image behind.
With his restriction to manual means
or at the most to passive, receptive
spell-work, even Max had had a smidgen
of doubt about his ability to ﬁgure out a
way into the sphere on any sort of near-
term basis, not that he would have
mentioned it to the kid; he might not
have even mentioned it to Shaa. Too,
there was the barest chance that the
whole thing was a decoy. It wasn’t un-

til his ﬁngers running carefully across
the surface fell a slight ripple, a rip-
ple that on further investigation could
actually have been a ﬁne crack, that
Max started to feel a bit more conﬁ-
dent. The crack outlined a circle just
the right size for a hatch. Its top edge
was perhaps two feet down from the
base of the suspension pillar, which
would put it in an appropriate position
as well. He tugged open enough of the
netting to expose the area.
Of course,
another slight hurdle
remained to be overcome. He was un-
able to feel any other surface features
either inside the circle or in its imme-
diate vicinity. He decided to risk one or
two low-energy revelation bursts, but
when these had soaked in through the
refraction ﬁeld nothing had changed;
no runes had appeared, no instructions
had ﬂuoresced, no locking mechanisms

had materialized.
To be sure, Max
again pressed his face up against the
surface and squeegeed it around in a
search pattern. Through the refraction
haze, he could see Jurtan standing
beneath him on the ground, his neck
uncomfortably contorted.
“Why don’t
you hit it?” Mont yelled up.
The last two search spells were still
circulating.
Max closed his eyes and
let himself feel the ebb and ﬂow of ﬁeld
lines.
It was a door, that was clear,
with a compound-conﬁguration recess
that was waiting for some kind of key
to catalyze its shift to its other state
of stability ...
no, there were more
than just the two states, now that he
looked more closely.
The closed-and-
locked state was easy, that was the
one before him now, and “open” was a
matter of logical deduction, but then
for that matter so were the two - no,

three - trap states whose activation
hooks seemed precariously close to the
sequence that seemed likely to lead
to unfastening.
Max would have to
concentrate, but he had no doubt he
could handle it. It would take awhile,
though.
He lifted his head off the ball to get
himself into a more comfortable posi-
tion. Something seemed to retard his
movement, tugging his chest back to-
ward the surface. A small tented shape
was drawing his shirt outward. Some-
thing under his shirt?
The amulet?
Max pulled it out. The central gem
was glowing blue, and it was warm.
When he let go, the amulet swung out
on its chain and clinked against the
surface like one half of a magnet pair.
It began to turn, clockwise, stopped,
counter-rotated half a revolution, then

-
Max grabbed it back.
It resisted
him more forcefully this time; he ac-
tually had to yank it away.
It came
free with a sudden jerk. He had had
an unpleasant vision of the door sud-
denly swinging open into the sphere,
the amulet stuck to it, the amulet’s
strong chain drawing tight around his
neck and dragging him abruptly after
it with the choke of an unexpected gar-
rote.
Max turned the amulet in his
ﬁngers, probing at it. It ignored him.
It had been ignoring him since he’d
ﬁrst obtained it, during his last visit to
the Imperial Thaumaturgical Archives.
Not for the ﬁrst time, the thought that
this particular piece had not come to
his hands through total accident was
in his mind. If so, the thing’s person-
ality was no less than he deserved. It
liked to treat him the same way he

treated others.
He’d never had a hint that the
amulet was useful as a key, though.
Given that it could be a key, it was
more likely that it had the action of a
skeleton key against a particular class
of lock than to presume it had specif-
ically been designed to ﬁt this lock.
The latter possibility was certainly the
more intriguing, reeking as it did of
murky plots, nameless intrigues, and
hidden stratagems. That sort of thing
was improbable even in the midst of an
improbable life-style, but the improba-
ble was not the same as the unheard-of.
Still, this was scarcely the time to be
pondering the mysterious when more
evidence might be available close at
hand.
Max slipped the chain off over his
head and gingerly inserted the amulet
into the guide-path he’d felt earlier

weaving its way through the lock ma-
trix. In fact, the amulet had its own
clear idea of where it wanted to go.
This time, it hit the invisible sphere
with the protruding curve of its big
gem, a jewel that in its resting stale
was clearly a diamond but that at the
moment had shifted color to become
the spitting image of a large sapphire.
The jewel wobbled once, then hung in
space, twisting back and forth in appar-
ent insubordination to the standards
of earthward motion. Then the jewel
trailing its chain sank downward into
the air and disappeared from sight.
Max’s hand, outstretched after it, en-
countered no resistance of its own, and
similarly faded out.
He lowered his
head into the empty space.
After a short distance, the space
wasn’t empty at all, which was scarcely
a surprise.
The view of netting and

ground dimmed and suffused into mist.
Instead, there was the hatch, swung
down and back, its surface now re-
vealed as metal polished to a light
matte ﬁnish.
His amulet still hung
outward from the hatch with its gem
just touching the surface. Just beyond
the hatch in the middle of the sphere
and dangling on a tripodic chain from
the roof, a large wizard-light globe was
in the process of igniting itself, its color
pulsing back and forth between green
and purple and ﬁnally settling for an
atmospheric pale solferino.
It lit up
a ball-shaped room of the right pro-
portions to match the volume draped
by the netting outside, a ﬂat peg-and-
groove ﬂoor covering the lower bilge
curve. Bookcases bent around the wall
and outlined a small desk across from
the hatch.
In the center of the ﬂoor
was an ornate rug, and on top of the

rug was a comfortable-looking divan.
The divan and its head-pillows bore
the imprint of a human-sized body.
Not,
however,
the recent imprint -
someone had spent enough time there
in the past to dent the springs, but they
didn’t seem to have been around any
too lately, judging from the quantity
of dust and the number of drooping
cobwebs.
Either Iskendarian hadn’t
wanted to spend the effort to set up
a perpetual cleanliness spell or he
just hadn’t cared one way or the other
about housekeeping.
Or, possibly, he
hadn’t planned on coming back. From
the number of books on the shelves and
the height of the stacked manuscript
notebooks and loose pages by the desk,
though, that last guess seemed less
than apt. Now, how much of the stuff
could Max carry? Maybe it would be
better to settle in for a few weeks and

just read everything.
The manuscripts were the logical
place to start. The only problem, Max
realized as soon as he started paging
down through the sheets from the top,
was that Iskendarian had exhibited
good paranoid technique by using his
own writing code.
Max could recog-
nize
equations
interspersed
among
the text; it was difﬁcult to disguise
their form but much easier to obscure
their contents.
Here he had a whole
transformational derivation stretching
through ﬁve - ten! – pages. Something
about that one looked a bit familiar
... communications, that was it. That
term had to be a carrier-wave modula-
tor, and that one ...
“Max!
Max!” broke in on his con-
centration an unclear time later. Max
mounted the ladder and extended his
head back out into the world.

“What is it?”
The sun had shifted positions in the
sky; instead of rising, it was already
starting to descend. “Are you okay?” Ju-
rtan called up.
“Yeah,” said Max. Something beyond
the usual was bothering the kid. Mont
hadn’t been yelling: he’d been speaking
almost softly. “What’s up?”
“I thought it might be you, thought
you might be in trouble. The music -
something doesn’t feel right.” Jurtan
looked nervously over his shoulder
back in the direction they’d come from.
“Could somebody be following us?”
“Damn!” said Max.
He leaned far-
ther out of the hatch, knife in hand,
and slashed at the knots he’d tied
to hold the net in place.
It slipped
free and headed for the ground. Mont
hopped back in a hurry, and the net
just managed to miss his head.

“What are you doing?” Jurtan said.
“I thought we shook them.” Max was
still busy with the knife.
“Cut that
knot! Go!”
“Shook who?” Jurtan reached the
tree and hacked once at the rope with
his own knife. The loose end began to
whip upward.
The other end wasn’t falling, though;
Max was hauling the whole thing in.
He’d cut loose the cross-tie that had
held the cable in place around the py-
lon. Max’s body still vanished into the
empty air at the level of his waist -
his torso and head were clear enough,
although they were balancing on noth-
ing, but below them was - well, it was
weird. The rope was disappearing into
the same place his legs would have
been. “Them,” said Max. “The Hand.
Get down! Can you tell how close they
are?”

“You mean someone was following us
here? This Hand guy?”
Both ends of the rope slithered up-
ward and popped away into the air.
Max withdrew from sight after them.
“The Hand isn’t a person, it’s a group,”
he hissed. “They’re -”
“We know you’re in there, Maximil-
lian!” The shout came from somewhere
across the water surrounding their is-
land. “You might as well come out!”
“Like I said,” Max muttered.
“The
Hand.”
“I wish you wouldn’t keep springing
things on me like this,” Jurtan said
morosely, face down on the ground
beneath the level of the marsh grass.
“Things get sprung on you one way
or the other, kid. You get them from
me or I can stand out of the way and
let life pitch them at you direct, take
your pick.”

“We have the island surrounded,
Maximillian!
Please come out and
save us all some trouble, eh, my old
friend?”
“Who’s that talking?” whispered Jur-
tan. “What are we going to do? What
are you going to do?”

Chapter12
DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVES
“CAN’T YOU HOLD THIS THING
ANY STEADIER?” said the Great
Karlini.
“Is bird,” said Haddo.
“Not is ma-
chine.” Karlini had never been nearly
as fond of ﬂying as Max, who enjoyed
the freedom of clear skies and open

air and rushing speed. Not that Kar-
lini disliked all of it - he didn’t mind
smooth air, or a straight and level
glide, or even high altitude above a to-
tally unsupported free-fall drop. Max
was blessed with a thoroughly unruf-
ﬂeable sense of balance, though, and
the cast-iron constitution of his inner
ear let him actually enjoy the swoops,
banks, rolls, stalls, and crash dives
of the large scavenger bird that Kar-
lini had, after a fashion, inherited.
Haddo - well, who knew what kind of
sense of balance Haddo had, anyway,
but at the least he seemed to have a
solid rapport with the bird, and if the
skin beneath his ever-present fuligin
black cloak ever turned green (or what-
ever passed for the color of nausea in
Haddo’s circle) he had never given the
slightest sign of it.
Karlini screwed
his eyes shut again, took in a deep

slow breath, and tightened his double-
armed grip around Haddo’s midsection,
conveniently located just ahead of him
on the tandem saddle slung across the
bird’s shoulders at the base of its long
wattled neck. “Constrict not my lung,”
Haddo grumbled, but he didn’t actu-
ally try to pry Karlini loose from his
death-grip hug.
Along with whatever mutation and
environmental shift had let the sub-
species grow to such a hypertrophic
size that they were capable of carry-
ing two fully-grown humans (or a hu-
man and a something-else-of-roughly-
human-mass-and-shape) and on top
of them a limited amount of cargo
at the same time, the birds had ac-
quired a different attitude toward the
aesthetics of ﬂight than their dwarf
ancestors and cousins.
Rather than
just looping idly around the sky, drift-

ing on updrafts and generally lazing
around while they waited for some
ground-hugger creature to do them the
favor of turning itself into carrion, the
giant buzzards now seemed to enjoy
executing more strenuous aerial calis-
thenics. That was paradoxical on the
face of it, Karlini thought, because the
stresses on the birds’ skeletons and
musculature would have increased out
of proportion with their increase in
size.
Shaa had once described to him the
results of a rare necropsy on one of
the giant birds.
Although Shaa had
not actually been present for the event
but had instead heard the story from
a medical acquaintance, he had illumi-
nated the scene as though he had been
the one manning the saw, mentioning
the hydrogen-ﬁlled buoyancy spaces
in the hollow bones, tendons with the

tensile strength of old-world bridge ca-
bles, and a supercharger affair on the
high-efﬁciency heart. Max had nodded
sagely at the last point; he was the only
one of them who seemed to have the
slightest clue of what a supercharger
actually might be, but typically enough
he hadn’t been talking.
Sinking into
his reverie, which had looked to be
a clear sight more comfortable than
his current situation, Karlini’s innards
suddenly all leapt at once toward his
left shoulder, revolved around his chest
until they were plastered against his
right side, and then caromed smartly
off his backbone. “Blech,” said Karlini.
“Grouse you not,” Haddo snapped.
“You can’t tell me you actually enjoy
this?” asked Karlini. “Can you?”
“Not to enjoy for me is,” said Haddo.
“Is for me only command of Karlini.
‘Fly bird’ is of Karlini the word, and

of Karlini are both the servants, I and
bird both, so choice have we what?”
The bird might indeed have been lis-
tening: no one who might legitimately
know had been willing to say how
smart the birds really were.
It exe-
cuted a particularly vicious side-slip,
nosed over, and launched itself in a
tight spiral toward the ground. Haddo
squawked at the bird and hauled on
the reins; the bird hollered back and
reluctantly ﬂattened out into a long
glide, and then a slow smooth climb.
“‘Always with bird is Haddo,” he contin-
ued.
“Did sign up not to manager of
aviary be. Not -”
“Not is in your contract, yes, Haddo,
I know,” said Karlini with half a mind,
“and I assure you we all appreciate the
sacriﬁce you’re making.”
“Also not job is to run of operation
air the freight,” Haddo added, but that

was just his mouth slowing from its mo-
mentum, Karlini ﬁgured; Haddo knew
he’d made his point. For only the ﬁrst
time in over half an hour.
“Quite an outstanding job you’re
doing with the bird, too,” Karlini com-
mented.
“I don’t know where you’ve
been keeping it, but I hadn’t seen it
around since before we left Roosing
Oolvaya. Was it out foraging? How did
it know when to show up?”
“Arrangement have we.” The bird
whooped once in agreement.
Karlini cracked one eye cautiously
open and looked around.
Their alti-
tude still let them look down across
the broken-mirror glitter of the moon-
lit Oolvaan off to the left, snaking back
and forth in its sullen meanderings
and gradually spilling open on both
banks as it entered its delta out to-
ward the horizon far ahead.
Much

closer, though, the urban center of
Oolsmouth was clearly apparent. The
bird banked right again and began to
lose altitude, at a much more civilized
rate this time.
Haddo and the bird had obviously
worked out a deal that gave the bird
a certain amount of autonomy over
its own schedule; frankly, Karlini ﬁg-
ured that was just as well, since the
problem of where to house the bird
otherwise never seemed to go away.
As it was, letting the bird hang out
on its own avoided a lot of hassles, es-
pecially since the bird seemed willing
enough to make itself available when
needed.
If you could reliably reason
from the scant evidence, it would ap-
pear that the bird liked its job with
Karlini much more than its old one,
working for the Death who’d ended up
in the ring, and was willing to com-

promise to keep its employers happy.
“Do you think you’ve got enough of a
rapport with this thing,” Karlini said
in a low voice, “that it’ll let you know
in advance before it decides to take its
leave of absence to visit the ancestral
breeding grounds?”
“It better,” Haddo said, “if knows for
itself good what is.”
Well, what more could you want
from a bird, anyway? Karlini thought.
Their decision to use the bird to ferry
him to Oolsmouth had been reached
early enough in the day that Karlini
had actually had enough time to force
himself to skip two meals.
As a re-
sult, his visceral warfare hadn’t taken
the same toll on his stomach that it
otherwise would certainly have done;
in fact, he’d even managed to keep
himself from retching outright.
That
was something to be thankful for, sure

enough. The bird was willing to drag
them around, but it did this under
some sufferance, and Karlini didn’t
want to test its level of forbearance by
throwing up all over its pinfeathers.
He kept his teeth ﬁrmly gritted as they
dropped lower; then, all at once, the
landscape below was no longer an ab-
stract picture disconnected from them,
but an expanse of rushing trees almost
close enough to touch, their crowns
and branches monochromatic under
the white-splashed moon.
Actually, they weren’t really close
enough to touch,
not yet,
but the
bird was coming in steadily as Haddo
looked for a space big enough to use for
a landing-strip.
A road ran through
the trees – surely it was too nar-
row?
. . .
yes, Haddo had let it pass.
The trees abruptly ended in a neat
line and yielded to ﬁelds, the torchlit

sprawl of Oolsmouth conspicuous on
the left.
The ground skimmed past,
they hopped a fence, and then the bird
reared up, stalled, and settled gently
with a ﬂuff of wings.
“Whoof!” said Karlini, letting him-
self slide to the ground.
One foot
landed on soil, but the other leg em-
bedded
itself
in
a
brambly
shrub.
Certainly that wasn’t the only plant
around? No, the entire ﬁeld was ﬁlled
with even rows of them.
He disen-
tangled his foot, glad that he’d worn
his heavy pants for the ride on the
bird-saddle . . . but now his entire leg
was covered by bits of ﬂuffy white, al-
most glowing in the moonlight. They’d
landed in a cotton ﬁeld.
Haddo had tossed down Karlini’s
pack.
Karlini hefted it and turned
back to the bird to have a ﬁnal word
with him before his departure, but the

pilot seat was empty.
“Come,” hissed
Haddo. His glowing eyes were already
some distance down the row of cotton
plants.
Karlini weaved toward him.
Just
as he reached Haddo, he heard a ﬂap
and a whuff behind him, and a gust of
air blew against his back. He turned
around just in time to see the bird take
a ﬁnal step off the ground and soar
off over the ﬁeld, ﬂap its wings again,
and fade gracefully into the night. “I
thought you were just dropping me off,”
said Karlini,
“Thought
apparently
you
wrong.”
Haddo turned and headed purpose-
fully across the ﬁeld.
Now, wait a minute, Karlini thought.
The plan was for him to sneak into
Oolsmouth, try to ﬁnd out exactly what
was happening with Groot, and with
luck resolve the situation - but what

did Haddo intend to do? Karlini caught
up with him.
“Where do you think
you’re going?” Karlini said.
“You’re
not just doing this to go shopping, are
you?”
“Business have you. Business have
I, too,” Haddo told him mysteriously
but in a tone of deﬁnite purpose; a tone
that made it sound like Haddo knew
more about what he wanted to accom-
plish and how he intended to do it than
Karlini did himself.
Maybe I should try to talk him into
taking me along on his errand ﬁrst,
Karlini thought.
“Coming you are?” Haddo said impa-
tiently.
Karlini got himself moving again
and trailed Haddo to the edge of the
ﬁeld and over a split-log fence onto a
dirt road. Without the merest hesita-
tion, Haddo turned left and scuttled off

down the lane with the air of a being
who knew exactly where he was going
and what he was about.
For some time, Karlini’s curiosity
about Haddo had been growing. If he
watched closely, this might be a use-
ful opportunity to ﬁnd out something
worthwhile. Haddo’s recalcitrance and
cryptic nature easily outpaced even
Max’s level of cussedness, though. The
fact that he was not only letting Kar-
lini accompany him on his “business”
without being harangued for half-a-
week ﬁrst, or being wheedled into it,
but had out-and-out told Karlini to
hurry along with him, was enough to
give even a normally impetuous person
pause. Karlini didn’t think of himself
as impetuous in the least but really
rather more the stay-at-home type, so
the situation was all the more glar-
ing in its stark contrast to their usual

routine.
The side road they were follow-
ing soon met up with a larger one.
They turned right at the intersection,
clearly aiming toward the outskirts of
Oolsmouth across the gently sloping
land. It had been a number of years
since the last time Karlini had visited
Oolsmouth, and with the continuing
pace of the local pastime, public works
projects,
he wasn’t sure he’d know
his way around.
If he remembered
correctly, though, they were heading
toward what had been the shanty-
town area on the northwestern edge
of town.
Wandering around in the
post-midnight gloom, even with a good
moon still up, was not exactly the best
way to renew a connection with un-
familiar geography, but Haddo still
seemed to know where he was going,
sure enough.

“Uh, Haddo? Is this side of the city
still the, uh -”
“See you will,” said Haddo.
“Quiet
now be.”
“If that’s where we’re going,” Karlini
muttered, “I’m glad I’m with you.”
“Glad should you be.”
Ahead of them, a clutter of ramshackl
buildings, some little more than lean-
tos, marked the edge of Oolsmouth.
Don’t look like a victim, Karlini re-
minded himself.
That’s what they al-
ways say. But you weren’t supposed to
call attention to yourself by being too
forthright, either.
There was a spell-
sequence for turning yourself invisible,
but it would have taken a several-hour
session to set up even if Karlini had
the right references at hand, and in
any case it was most effective against
straightforward humans.
The street
was still deserted as they passed the

ﬁrst buildings. Down the block on the
right, however, he could see a fairly
solid-looking two-story timber-frame
structure with open glassless windows
on the second ﬂoor. Something drifted
past one window, something luminous
and wispy, like a person-shaped cloud
or a gauze mannequin. It didn’t look
tough, and things wrapped in gauze
usually had a hard time being menac-
ing, but then it could have just been a
lookout.
On the other side of the street, pro-
truding from a deep pool of shadow
between two houses, Karlini spotted
a pair of legs.
The feet, clad in old
ratty sandals,
were resting in the
rubbish-heaped gutter, and the bare
legs stretched back away into the
darkness, disappearing from sight just
above the knee. Each of the two legs
was as thick at its calf as Karlini’s

waist and their length from knee to
ankle would have measured Karlini
from ﬂoor to hip.
A rumbly snore
rasped from the alley. Karlini was not
relieved to see that Haddo gave the
legs a wide berth, but he locked his
jaw shut and followed Haddo’s path.
It doesn’t matter, he thought. They’re
still pretty basically like us.
At the next corner, though, the ﬁgure
sitting on a ﬂat perch nailed halfway
up that building and leaning backward
against the wall with his arms folded
over his chest, appeared human in all
particulars, at least to the limit of vis-
ibility provided by the moon and the
few ﬁrelit windows. The head swiveled
to follow them down the street, the
silver color of moonlight glinting in
its eyes.
Karlini kept himself from
rushing his pace as they moved past.
There were some people who had ex-

tensive congress with their more outré
cousins, whether for reasons of busi-
ness, philosophy, or various emotional
hang-ups, but since cross-species frat-
ernization was more of a vice than a
mainstream activity, and a tawdry vice
at that, those folks didn’t advertise it
around too loudly; they were in a sense
as much of a silent population as the
nonhumans themselves, the kind of
people whom one saw standing on a
street corner shouting hoarse-voiced
manifestos from beneath a mane of
scraggly hair, or giving lectures on “My
Life with the Folk of the Field.” Rather
tedious, really, thought Karlini.
On
the other hand, anyone who spent the
night perched on an outer wall watch-
ing a street might be more than odd, he
could be downright dangerous. You’re
a sorcerer, Karlini told himself, and
a leading one, too.
You can certainly

deal with a single weirdo. It wasn’t re-
assuring. The guy could have friends.
The guy could know the whole district.
And the only backup Karlini had was –
Haddo?
Where he had gone?
A sharp hiss came from the right,
where another narrow alley wound off
between the buildings. Karlini tried to
steady his breathing and walked into it.
Haddo’s glowing-coal eyes glared up at
him. “Attention pay,” Haddo snapped.
“Lost get become.”
“How much farther are we going?”
“Until get there we.” The eyes dis-
appeared as Haddo swung around.
Karlini heard the small sound of feet
crunching through the usual ground-
garbage.
The sound began to retreat
again from him so he followed once
more.
It was much darker in the alley,

which wasn’t a real surprise. He didn’t
like using spells in this gods-forsaken
place, but did he remember anything
for night vision? What about -
Gods-forsaken?
“Haddo,” Karlini said in a low voice,
“do you folks have any gods?”
The crunching ahead of him stopped.
“What mean you?”
“All the gods I’ve ever heard about
have been human, in appearance I
mean, and temperament, too.
Are
there any gods like you?”
Haddo said nothing. Maybe it was a
sore subject: he probably should have
thought more before bringing it up in
the ﬁrst place. The answer could have
signiﬁcance, though, to someone at
sometime somewhere if not obviously
so at the moment. “Personal, question
is,” Haddo said slowly.
“Oh, I don’t know. It’s more -”

“My word, take.”
“Well,” Karlini said, “don’t you have
gods leaning on you and looking over
your shoulder the way we do?”
“Without representation,
taxation
still is.”
“I’m not sure I -”
“Maximillian, ask should you.
Ex-
pert on gods is he.”
Haddo turned and crunched hur-
riedly away.
Was Haddo just trying
to distract him with misdirection? He
knew Max wasn’t anywhere Karlini
could reach him for a question at the
moment.
No, it probably wasn’t mis-
direction at all; it would be just like
Max to have wormed something in-
teresting out of Haddo and not have
mentioned it to anybody. Around the
next bend, his thoughts still churning
queasily, Karlini almost tripped over
Haddo.
Haddo for once didn’t bother

to mention this. He was scrutinizing
the apparently blank wall of a build-
ing, hands on what were presumably
hips. “Haddo izney tu,” he said to the
building.
Nothing happened. After a moment,
he said, in a louder and more aggrieved
voice, “Haddo izney halatu!” Then he
kicked the wall for good measure.
A concealed door separated itself
from the wall and opened inward.
Haddo, abandoning his usual scuttling
gait, strode into a dark hall.
Karlini
squared up his shoulders and trailed
him in.
The door closed after them.
“With doors tricks more,” muttered
Haddo.
“Always with doors tricks.
Think you up with something new
come they would.”
A voice spoke out of the gloom deeper
down in the hall and from a higher
level, as though the speaker was hang-

ing from the ceiling;
the character
of the voice was a sort of contralto
buzzing whine, the kind of sound a
person with a few bees caught in their
throat might make. “Nobody said you
had to come here,” the voice said,.
“Haddo am I,” said Haddo.
“Are you now?” buzzed the voice.
“And who is this - person?”
“With games stop,” Haddo snapped.
“Door open.”
“You can go in,” the voice said reluc-
tantly, “but your man waits outside.”
A sudden glare of red slashed across
Karlini’s dark-adapted vision.
His
own barely stiﬂed yelp went totally
unheard under the twin sounds of an
electric-arc zapping and the frantic
buzz of a beehive abruptly kicked off
its tree branch.
In the seared-white
afterimage Karlini could see the ﬁgure
of Haddo just ahead of him, one arm at

shoulder level, backlit in silhouette by
the core of the light-burst pouring out
from his hand. The buzzing ran down
the scale with a gulp and a pant. With-
out another word, though, a new door
opened ahead and to the right. A stair-
case led down. “Word say not,” Haddo
muttered back over his shoulder. “Cool
be.” He headed down the stairs.
Ahead of them spilling up the stair-
case were the jumping lights of can-
dles and lanterns, quite a number of
candles and lanterns at that, and as
they descended, a large ﬁreplace came
into view as well across the room, its
piled wood in full roar.
Karlini had
given up trying to seriously ﬁgure out
what Haddo had led him into, but he’d
expected perhaps a small room illu-
minated by a single low candle in the
middle of a table, with various dimly
glimpsed beings arranged around it

making secret signs and behaving in
an obstinately enigmatic manner. In-
stead, the sprawling basement room
that greeted them was clearly a tavern,
or more properly an establishment of
cosmopolitan iniquities, and by the
looks of it quite a ﬂourishing one in-
deed.
It was plainly not, though, a
place particularly catering to humans,
of which species Karlini found himself
to be the sole member in attendance.
For the most part, the major nonhu-
man breeds differed only in size, skin
color, number of joints, and facial fea-
tures from what humans liked to think
of as the norm.
Nevertheless, there
wasn’t usually a lot of social mixing.
For the most part, the nonhumans con-
gregated in their own districts when
they were in cities. Whether this hap-
pened under their own pure volition or
because of pressure from the human

citizens (or directly from the coercive
power of the cities themselves) was
for most purposes a moot point; as
long as they were out of sight, people
were happier overall.
The happiness
of the nonhumans was a matter few
people troubled themselves with.
To
be more precise, Karlini reminded him-
self, not much else about nonhumans
troubled people either.
People as a
whole couldn’t care less about what the
nonhumans did in their part of a city,
or what they did when they weren’t in
cities, for that matter. Well, okay, that
was a gross generalization, but then
lumping all individual differences in a
common pot was the kind of thing peo-
ple are good at. Shaa had told him he
thought there was a signiﬁcant case of
societal myopia at work, if not outright
amnesia, but then Shaa had always
held himself to be a social critic.

Ahead of them, a party of stout,
waist-high folks with the generally
rough-and-tumble air of roustabouts
were gathered singing off-key choral
rounds around the hearth; they turned
to look Haddo and Karlini over as they
came down the stairs, and a few other
assorted patrons raised their heads to
eye the two of them as well.
Karlini
found himself trading stares with the
large purple eyes of a white-furred face
topped by a coordinating lilac beret; a
thin rope of glowing smoke wound up-
ward from the cigarette perched in an
ivory holder in the red-lipped mouth.
Karlini held her stare long enough to
demonstrate his security of character
but not long enough to mean anything
by it, and then swung his gaze around
the room with a feeling of relief. He’d
found the proportions and the color
scheme of her face vaguely distress-

ing, but she was a far sight better
than the out-and-out distasteful looks
of her companions around the table.
One had something more than vaguely
snakish about him, and the one with
his leathery arm around the smoker’s
shoulders, well . . . Karlini’s foot came
down on something more solid than
the thick but slippery stair risers, and
he realized they had reached the main
part of the ﬂoor.
Haddo twisted his way off to the
left, Karlini carefully threading along
with him.
The bartender, a thick-set
humanoid about three feet taller than
Karlini and perhaps twice his bulk,
watched their progress with pursed
lips, or more correctly watched Haddo’s
approach and ignored Karlini alto-
gether. The guy took a ﬁnal appraising
look at Haddo, then disappeared into
the stockroom behind the bar. Karlini

noticed that the center portion of the
bar was set at a comfortable height
for the average-sized human, which
seemed to be around the average for
the folks around the room as well: the
left end of the bar, though, had a se-
ries of risers set along the ﬂoor, and
the right end had a trench dug down
into the ground beneath the uprooted
planking.
Haddo sauntered up onto
the middle part of the short-beings’
section and turned to look over the
crowd again.
Karlini edged next to
him and whispered, “Did we really
have to corm here?
I mean, Haddo,
this bar stuff is such a cliché.”
“For you to meet is someone,” said
Haddo, peering into the murk of the far
corner of the room. “To meet, go must
where one is.”
“I haven’t been in a place like this
since, well, since the time I met you.”

Haddo mumbled something unintel-
ligible. The bartender reemerged from
the storeroom, ducking beneath the
door sill at the back of the bar with a
wooden crate the size of a valise under
his arm. He set the crate down in front
of Haddo, took a ﬁrm hold on the lid,
and worked it back and forth.
Nails
let loose with drawn-out squeaks. Set-
ting the lid aside, the bartender probed
around in the crate with a hand that
seemed almost as large as the interior
itself. Wood shavings spilled out on the
bar. Then, with a grunt of triumph, he
withdrew a cylindrical parcel wrapped
in fuzzy cloth.
Haddo straightened.
“Imri naj?” he said.
The bartender tugged loose a cor-
ner of the cloth and ﬂashed Haddo a
glimpse within. Karlini, off at a differ-
ent angle, got an impression of dark
heavy glass containing the sparkle of

active lightning. Haddo reached inside
his cloak after his purse, but the bar-
tender held out his other hand, palm
raised toward Haddo’s chest.
“Your
name Haddo?” he said.
“Haddo am I,” Haddo said.
“Then it’s paid for,” said the bar-
tender.
Haddo paused a second, then shrugge
took the intoxicant, hopped off the
riser, and headed for a table.
Karlini looked at the bartender, who
ignored him and turned away. He took
two long steps and caught up with
Haddo.
“Why didn’t you order some-
thing for me?” said Karlini.
“Not would like your system the
menu.” Haddo said. A path was open-
ing in front of them as Haddo weaved
his way through the room.
A being
about Karlini’s height whose features
were concealed by the hood of a for-

est green cloak was walking from
one table to another with a foaming
mug protruding from his sleeve, his
head swiveling loosely about.
Then
he caught sight of the form of Haddo
bearing down on him with Karlini at
his heels, abruptly straightened, and
reeled back out of the way. Behind him
and off to the back, Karlini spotted the
empty table Haddo evidently had in
mind as his destination. Another table
of patrons turned away, snifﬁng the
air as though something noxious was
drifting toward them. Haddo bent his
path and headed in their direction.
Karlini grabbed Haddo’s shoulder
and leaned over him. “Uh. Haddo?” he
whispered in as surreptitious a voice
as he could manage under the circum-
stances, “Don’t you think it would be
better if I waited outside? I don’t want
to set anything off, but these folks

seem kind of jittery with me around.”
“Not are they because of you up-
set,” Haddo told him.
He shot an-
other glance at the table of supercil-
ious gnomes, said, “On you, all feh!”
in their general direction, turned his
shoulder on them. and scuttled again
toward the empty table and its beckon-
ing chairs. As they reached the back,
Karlini noticed that he had been hold-
ing his breath. “Inhale you can,” said
Haddo dryly, having noticed it too.
Karlini
wedged
himself
into
the
chair behind the table and found him-
self mashed up against the wall. Had
the Haddo he knew changed places
in the dark with a ringer?
Their ta-
ble was back toward one corner of the
room;
the room’s main illumination
spilling from the hearth was shadowed
by the stone side of the ﬁreplace it-
self where it protruded into the room.

Mounted on the stone front of the ﬁre-
place next to the ﬁre was a dartboard;
a small humanoid creature with bare
furry feet and a nasty attitude was
standing ﬁve paces back from it on top
of a table, preparing to launch.
He
threw and hit the board, threw and
hit, causing the few hangers-on to mur-
mur approvingly. A smirk appeared on
the short guy’s button-nosed face and
he said, in a cloyingly high-pitched
squeak clearly audible across the in-
tervening patrons, “You bums think
that was good? Well, watch this.” He
threw again, underhand this time. The
ﬂetching on the short dart grazed the
pointy ear of the elvish-looking fellow
slouched in his chair at the front of the
table, and as the elvish guy shot out
an arm to grab the furry-footed one by
the throat, the dart went corkscrewing
off-course into the ﬁre.
The thrower

started to backpedal out of the way but
put his foot into a tray of salad. The
salad promptly shot out from under
him. He landed back-ﬁrst on a pitcher
of ale, which smashed, and then hit
one corner of the table going down as
the elvish guy hit the other side of the
table on his way up; the table, pre-
dictably, ﬂipped, and all of them went
sliding to the ﬂoor.
“Do you usually
hang out with these kind of folks?”
Karlini asked Haddo, still keeping his
voice low. “Why are we here, really?”
“Time now is some things should you
hear, “ said Haddo, taking a swig from
his container. A small bolt of lightning
rolled out of the jar mouth and crack-
led down into his hood. “But nothing
trust,” he continued, raising an admon-
ishing ﬁnger. “Explain will I later.”
“Hopefully more than you’ve been ex-
plaining until now,” Karlini grumbled.

The ﬂoor shuddered.
An earth-
quake? No, earthquakes didn’t make
that kind of low, gritty, scraping sound,
like something was rasping long stone
ﬁngernails along the underside of the
foundation of a building.
Except for
the clatter of chairs being knocked
about and the crashing of the upended
table, which was now being rapidly
demolished, and the hufﬁng, grunt-
ing, and cursing of the dart players
where they were rolling around be-
neath it on the ﬂoor, all other activity
had hastily ground to a halt. The same
long grating noise came again, this
time even causing the dart players to
pause; they’d stopped beating at each
other with their table legs and were
no longer gnawing on each other’s el-
bows, and their mouths were hanging
thoughtfully open as they listened with
the rest of the crowd, but - they were

still moving. The table top slid off them
and fell ﬁat with a bang.
They were
moving, because -
The
ﬂoor
underneath
them
had
started to revolve.
Suddenly the bartender was there,
shooing the bystanders away with a
sweeping gesture and a ﬁrm kick,
reaching into the pile of hesitating
ﬁghters and coming up with the short
nasty one held upside down by one
furry foot.
The bartender slung him
backward along the ﬂoor toward the
stair,
sliding him after the rapidly
thinning crowd. The short guy’s elvish
friend scurried after him on hands and
knees, trying to rapidly make headway
and gain his feet at the same time. An-
other kick here and a shove there, and
the hulking bartender had cleared the
moving section of ﬂoor of the pieces of
table and the upset chairs, and the few

adjacent but still right-side-up chairs
as well.
Then the bartender knelt
down and rapped on the ﬂoorboard in
the center of the revolving circle.
The circle stopped turning and the
screeching died. Rap, rap, whack came
back at him from the underside. The
bartender knocked a few more times
and stepped back. The ﬂoorboards ro-
tated another quarter turn, the rasp
changed into more of a screech, and
that section of ﬂoor swung open into
the room.
Something moved in the passage be-
neath the trapdoor. Darkly gleaming
and round, like the top of an upside-
down cauldron, it couldn’t be alive
. . .
but it was lurching up into the
air.
The smaller top part was round
like a cauldron, Karlini realized, and
somewhere in its innards there might
be a fully spherical shape about half

his height, but as it rose into the room
the mechanism - for it was certainly
a mechanism - seemed so festooned
with clanking, whirring, spinning, and
hufﬁng pieces of strange apparatus,
arranged in so many intriguing lumps
and modules, that there was in truth
no telling what might have been inside.
Karlini was accustomed to seeing
the latest small assemblies of illicit or
contraband machinery that Max had
dragged home, or whatever his latest
target for tinkering happened to be,
but he had never seen anything like
this - such a conglomeration of cog-
wheels and jeweled gears, pulleys and
linkages and belts, sprockets, cams,
cables, and cranks, pneumatic bellows,
and panels of lights. Gusts of vaporous
air were emerging in spurts from the
thing’s ﬂared base; each new gust sent
the contraption rising up farther from

the ﬂoor, only to see it settle slowly
back down again before the next gust
puffed forth. The cauldron-lid on the
top of the thing – no, it was really
more of a dome - was faced around
with what looked like a strip of hardy
windows; it spun slowly around, eye-
ing the retreating crowd and then the
bartender, who eyed it silently back.
The dome continued to traverse the
room. Finally, it caught sight of Kar-
lini.
“Eyeing” was exactly the right
word to describe what it was doing,
Karlini suddenly thought, as blinking
back at him from the blackness behind
the windows in the dome were two ap-
parently organic eyes, equipped with
the usual pupils and lids and shaded a
delicate light green. Standing next to
Karlini, Haddo waved at it.
The mechanism tilted slightly over
on its left, a trio of vanes like metal

grouper ﬁns ﬂapping in the midst of
the gears, and another gust of vapor
emerged from its rear. Of course, Kar-
lini realized, what else? - the thing was
making its way over to their table. It
hopped over the last intervening set of
chairs and drifted to a halt. Clanking
again, three sucker-tipped struts slid
out from its underside and it settled
gingerly toward the ﬂoor.
One at a
time, the suckers slurped hold of the
ﬂoorboards. The mechanism wobbled
back and forth, getting its footing so
to speak, and the whirring, clicking,
clanking,
and wheezing activity on
its surface quieted down substantially.
The dome tracked around again and
faced Haddo, who was leaning back
in his chair with his arms folded over
his chest under his dark robe. A small
hatch ﬂopped open on one side of the
dome and a tube topped with a ﬂar-

ing, tulip-petal horn rose out. It, too,
pointed itself at Haddo. In tinny tones,
the speaking tube said something to-
tally unintelligible.
“Lower Pocklish not use,” said Haddo.
The tube blew air with a ﬂatulent
honk. Then, in a slightly less fractured
pitch, it said.
“Haddo, with you how
is?”
Karlini tried to stiﬂe a groan. It was
bad enough trying to communicate
with Haddo by himself - now he was
supposed to deal simultaneously with
another savant employing the same
variant syntax?
“With me all is ﬁne,
Favored One,” Haddo said to the tube.
The dome ground to the left again, to
get a better view of Karlini. “This one
Maximillian is not,” the machine said,
“You right are. Introduction to make
is time.
Great Karlini,” Haddo said,
“Favored-of-the-Gods meet.”

“A pleasure,” said Karlini; making
an abortive handshaking gesture to-
ward the mechanism that left him
waggling his ﬁngers in midair.
“Hmph,” said the machine.
The
dome glanced around them.
Karlini,
glancing around, too, noticed that the
crowd had thinned to virtually nothing.
Two of the thickset short miner types
were still hanging around at the top
of the stairs, out of earshot from their
table, obviously keeping watch. Across
the room, the bartender nodded once
at the machine and gave a thumbs-up,
then ducked out of sight into the store-
room.
“To me looks situation stable,”
Haddo said.
The speaking tube snorted again
and withdrew back under its hatch. A
metallic clang came from deep in the
machine, following by the snickting
sounds of clamps unclamping and the

squelch of screws unscrewing.
The
dome shook itself, then lifted up off the
rest of the machine with a soft slurp
and rotated back.
A pair of pointed
ears rose into sight, followed by a rag-
mop of hair and a small elongated face.
The ears swiveled to point at them, one
at Haddo and one at Karlini, and the
rest of the creature hoisted itself out
of the interior onto a new perch on the
rubberized seal of the dome’s mount-
ing ledge. He was all of three feet tall,
even shorter than Haddo.
“Are you
some kind of elf?” Karlini said.
“That’s one way to put it, I suppose,”
Favored-of-the-Gods snapped.
“and
not the way I’d prefer it if you’d like to
know the truth.”
“I see,” said Karlini, not seeing at all.
“I beg your pardon. A gnome?”
“Now, wait just a minute here.” said
Favored-of-the-Gods.
“Wait just a

damned minute!” He waved one hand
in the air. “I am not a gnome! You got
that?”
Karlini threw his own hands up,
“Excuse me, I didn’t realize it was a
slur.” The guy did look like a gnome,
though, at least if he wasn’t some
breed of miniature elf. Was there some
newer, more politically correct way of
referring to them?
Favored frowned at Haddo.
“This
is the one latched by the trap of Pod
Dall?” he said, pointing incredulously
at Karlini.
“Correct are you,” Haddo said. “Kar-
lini it was.”
“Who’s Pod Dall?” Karlini asked.
“Remember you of castle the trap?
Remember you your vision, of Death
the god, of by ring the capture?
Pod
Dall that god was. Castle of Pod Dall
was it where trapped were you. Owns

Pod Dall castle that moves.”
“Now, you wait a minute, Haddo. I
thought nobody knew who that god
was,” said Karlini.
“It’s nice of you
to mention it now, but I don’t under-
stand why it had to wait all this time.
Why didn’t you bring this up before,
when we were all busting our necks
trying to ﬁgure it out? It’s important
information, and -”
“You just watch your tone of voice,
you big clodhopper,” snapped Favored.
“Where the hell you come off talking to
Haddo that way? You better give him
some more respect, you hear me?”
“What are you talking about?” Kar-
lini said. “I thought Haddo was work-
ing for me. It’s starting to look like I
was wrong, isn’t it, Haddo?”
“You didn’t think a guy of Haddo’s
stature would waste his time hanging
around with the likes of you if there

wasn’t a very good reason, did you?” Fa-
vored said.
“Uh,” said the Great Karlini. “As a
matter of fact –”
“Ego has he,” Haddo said to Karlini,
patting him reassuringly on the hand.
“Attention pay not.”
“He damn well better -” said Fa-
vored.
“Touchy always Favored acts,” Haddo
said, chopping him off as he was just
getting underway again.
“Habit is.
When short you are, difﬁcult can you
become.”
Karlini fought against a rising at-
tack of apoplexy.
“What is this guy,
Haddo, your agent?
A labor lawyer?
What is this, he’s going to sue me for
treating you wrong? And what ‘stature’
is he talking about, anyway? When did
you turn into a sorcerer?”
“This guy’s nothing but a hedge wiz-

ard.” Favored muttered “Nostrums and
love potions and no more science than
you can -”
“Now just a -”
“Quiet!” hissed Haddo.
“Of you,
both!” He glared at the creature perched
on the hatch of the machine. “Of you
ashamed am I. Always pick you ﬁghts,
must?”
“He’s a human, goddamit,” Favored
said sulkily.
“You know better than
to expect me to roll out manners for a
hulk like him.”
“For purpose are we here,” Haddo
said slowly,
enunciating each word
with a deliberate slap, still keeping his
gaze on Favored. The eye-sparks under
the hood of his cloak seemed to grow
sharper, brighter, hotter, until they
were visibly lighting Favored’s face
with an angry yellow smear.
Karlini
could see Favored’s pupils contracting

along their vertical slit edges. A wisp
of steam started from Favored’s left
eyebrow.
“Is greater curiosity of Kar-
lini than of Karlini his manners, but
does not in Karlini rudeness imply. If
manners keep will he, manners keep
will you? Shall meet in middle, we?”
Favored kept on trying to stare
Haddo down for another second. Then
he abruptly closed his eyes and swung
his face away. “All right, all right,” he
said, “but it’s only because you’re in-
sisting so much. I still say you’ve been
spending too much time with big idiots
like him; you shouldn’t be away from
your own people so much.”
“For absence reasons are; news to
you is not.” The searchlight glare from
Haddo’s hood faded.
Afterimages of
Favored’s face danced in Karlini’s own
eyes; he was glad he hadn’t been on
the receiving end of that bit of stage-

craft. Haddo glanced over at Karlini,
who was happy to see he was able to
keep himself from ﬂinching. “Excuse of
Favored behavior,” Haddo said. “Walks
he tightrope. Difﬁcult is world.”
“That’s for sure,” Karlini said ap-
peasingly.
Walking a tightrope was
probably a fair description of Favored-
of-the-Gods’ life, even if he had been
ﬂoating rather than walking, per se.
Karlini couldn’t get over the amount
of
machinery
Favored
was
moving
around with.
“You really must be fa-
vored by the gods,” he said to Favored.
“Anybody I know who’d try to put to-
gether that much technology would
ﬁnd themselves catapulted into the
nearest lava pit, or they’d come home
to ﬁnd their house gone and no one in
the neighborhood admitting to having
ever seen them before, or they’d look
down while they’re out in the street to

ﬁnd a bottomless pit had just opened
up under their shoes, all of which I
guess really amounts to pretty much
to same thing all around.”
“Hmph,” said Favored.
“Appears that here must do talking
I,” Haddo said, glowering at Favored.
“Help give you whenever urge you
feel. Random is not name of Favored,”
he continued, turning toward Karlini.
“Description is of job.”
“You mean you work for the gods?”
Karlini asked Favored.
“Yeah, yeah, I do some jobs for the
big guys,” Favored said reluctantly.
“One of them in particular, really. They
been keeping me on the hook.”
Karlini drummed his ﬁngers on the
table top and wished he had a drink.
“You’re a technologist?”
“A Fabricator, I like to call it.”
“But the gods prohibit -”

“Oh, all right,” Favored-of-the-Gods
said with a note of resignation. “You’ll
never understand anything if Haddo
tries to explain it, anyway, and even
if you could ﬁgure out what he’s say-
ing he always gets it wrong.
This is
the deal.
Sometimes the gods need
mechanicals, and some of them just
plain like the stuff, for recreation. You
know, like some of them collect art or
buildings or jewels or stuff, or some
of them collect people; most of ‘em
have got what they call their aesthet-
ical amusements. You’re about to say
they mash down technology out in the
world, right?
Well, they do, but that
doesn’t mean they make themselves
play by the same rules.
Haddo says
you’re not an idiot so I guess you’ve
gotta know the gods don’t play fair.”
“I won’t tell you it’s news,” Karlini
said.

“Right,” said Favored.
“They like
a mortal population they can control.
I don’t know if they really think the
fruits of engineering can upset their
can, but they like to play it safe and
anyway they’re in charge.
So like I
said, some of them go for mechanicals
on their own time.
As far as they’re
concerned,
for themselves,
mechan-
icals aren’t taboo, they’re not what
you’d call appalling, but they’re sort of
risqué for those who swing that way.”
“Technology is a guilty pleasure?”
“Yeah, that’s right, you could say
that.
It’s frowned on in your polite
company, if you can say there is polite
company with the gods, Most of them
turn up their noses at this stuff, call
it lowbrow, quaint, that kind of thing.
Those gods who do go for that kind of
kink don’t really know much of any-
thing about how to actually build the

things, though, so they’ve got to farm
out the work.”
“No god’s ever contacted Max about
doing work,” Karlini said to Haddo.
“He must be one of the best technolo-
gists alive.
He wouldn’t do anything
about it, I’m sure, but no one’s ever
asked him. For that matter, I’ve never
heard of anyone who’s been on retainer
to the gods. Maybe it isn’t the sort of
thing you’re allowed to talk about.”
“Your pal Max is a different kettle
of ﬁsh altogether,” Favored said, “al-
though I don’t know why you’re so
certain no one’s ever come after him.
You want to kick in anything here,
Haddo?”
“With exposition continue,” Haddo
said.
“Have it your way,” said Favored. He
adjusted his perch on the edge of his
hatch.
“Your name’s Karlini?
Okay,

Karlini,
you can’t be too surprised
you’ve never heard of this stuff before.
The gods aren’t fools. They don’t like
using humans if there’s any way to
help it; humans are too much trou-
ble.
They’re too much like the gods
themselves, sneaky and nasty and you
can’t trust them worth a damn, if you
ask me. You can drive yourself crazy
trying to reason with a human, too.,
and they’re all goddamncd busybodies,
they won’t just do a job and leave it at
that. On top of it all they talk too much.
Even when they’re not out broadcast-
ing to the world, they’ve got a hellish
gift for thinking up new ways to cause
problems. You hear what I’m saying?”
And he was calling me a racist, Kar-
lini thought. “I assume you’re building
up to some point,” he said.
“Through underbrush,” said Haddo,
“what saying Favored is, when want

done job gods, call gods human not.
Call gods Favored.”
“The best Fabricator in the busi-
ness,” said Favored, “that’s me, and I
don’t mind being the one to tell you.”
“Okay,” Karlini said, “now you’ve
told me. Why?”
“Don’t put a cramp,” Favored said.
“I’m getting there, I’m getting there.
Like I was saying, along with the jobs
I’ve done I’ve been able to spring my-
self some slack to do stuff on my own.”
“Such as your vehicle there?”
“Yeah, old Flotarobolis. What do you
think of it?”
“Looks a little small for me,” Karlini
said cautiously. “There’s no denying it’s
got character, though, and you had to
have put an awful lot of work into it.
The fact that for most anybody on the
planet, building that elaborate a mech-
anism would draw you an immediate

sentence of eradication from the near-
est god adds a certain something, too.”
Favored frowned. “You may be a hu-
man, but what you say is true enough.
I’m in kind of a tricky situation. They
may like me, but that doesn’t mean
I can just do whatever I want.
It’s
hard to know where their limits are. I
mean, I’ve got a lot more room to ma-
neuver than most, but like I said . . . ”
He shrugged his shoulders .
“But your - whatever you called it,
Floater-mobile?
- your god friends
think that’s okay, right?”
Favored glanced around him, then
leaned over to peer down into his craft,
apparently
examining
some
indica-
tor device.
He straightened up and
checked over his shoulder again before
saying, “Actually, they haven’t seen it
yet.”
“Oh?” said Karlini.
“On the face

of it, since you’re under the thumb
of the gods, so to speak, doesn’t that
mean they’d also have you under their
increased scrutiny?
After all, they
wouldn’t want to risk you spilling all
their secrets, would they?
Wouldn’t
they be unhappy with you for sitting
around discussing this stuff so freely in
public?” Why were they discussing this
stuff, anyway, other than out of gen-
eral comradeship and tale-spinning
curiosity?
“This of the matter crux is,” Haddo
said.
He took a last sizzle out of his
tumbler and slurped at the rim, then
peered longingly down into its depths.
“Vintage of excellence, was.
Try you
sometime should.”
“Not for me,” said Favored. “I don’t
have natural grounding like you do;
it’d fry my innards to a crisp. But any-
how, Haddo’s right. I’ve come up with

this, ah, misdirection technique that
defeats the probe of the gods; seems to
work pretty well as long as you don’t
use it too much. I’m running it now, in
fact.” A soft beep-beep, beep-beep from
the depths of his vehicle interrupted.
Favored leaned over and ﬁddled with
some controls out of sight, and the
beeping died away.
“Technology
that
can
outwit
the
sight of the gods,” Karlini said. “That’s
exactly the kind of thing they’re always
worried about.”
“You’re right again,” stated Favored,
making one last adjustment.
He set-
tled himself back against the ﬂipped-
up hatch.
“I haven’t been doing this
stuff just for the heck of it.
It’s not
worth the risk of getting pulped over
some no-account puttering, even I’ll
say that. I’m doing it ‘cause the time
is right.
You know about this busi-

ness the gods have going on with their
politics? This Conservationist and Ab-
dicationist thing?”
“Some,” Karlini said slowly. Haddo
looked at him, his hood tilted at an in-
credulous angle. “You’re not the only
one’s got your own little secrets,” Kar-
lini said to him.
“Job description change have must,”
announced Haddo, “trusted conﬁdant
from, menial laborer to.”
“Don’t start that again, will you
please, Haddo?” said Karlini.
“Why
don’t we just say we’re even for the
moment, okay?”
“See will we,” muttered Haddo.
“If you two are quite ﬁnished?” Fa-
vored said.
“The Abdicationists and
Conservationists, right?
From what
I’ve been able to ﬁnd out, it sounds
like they’re not just debating any more,
their squabble’s starting to spill over

into outright action,
like with this
Pod Dali thing. There’s still talk, but
things’re getting too intense for talk by
itself. Like Karlini here put it, I don’t
like being a bug under the thumb of the
gods for the rest of my life, and I think
that by playing things right I might be
able to help the Abdicationists come
out on top; and if that means the gods
decide to abdicate their control, well, I
wouldn’t be a bug anymore, would I?”
“We,” said Haddo.
“What?” Favored said.
“I not. Said you ‘I’-’I like don’t.’ ‘I
Abdication help.’ I and ‘I.’ Not should
say ‘I.’ should say ‘we.’ Are here we not
for ‘I,’ are here we for ‘we.’”
Even Favored looked a bit ﬂustered
after that one. Karlini was getting the
idea, though, ﬁnally, of why Favored
had wanted to meet, or at least he
thought he was. “As you probably real-

ize,” he told Favored, “the crew I’m in-
volved with, and especially Max, whom
you obviously know, or know of anyway,
also have the same long-term goal of
breaking up the gods’ hegemony over
everybody else.
I think we deﬁnitely
may have something to talk about here,
but before we get into that, I’ve got a
major question I need an answer for.”
Karlini swung around. “Haddo, where
do you ﬁt into all this?
Have I been
paying good money to a spy, somebody
who’s plotting to stab all of us in our
backs?
Don’t tell me you’re just a
loyal servitor, either -you’ve plainly got
more going on than you’ve been willing
to share. Well?”
“How say that can you?” said Haddo
in his most aggrieved tone. “Have not
been I in faithful extreme?”
“I don’t know. Have you?”
“Disappointment have I with you,”

Haddo grumbled. “Think you –”
Favored had been watching the two
of them with his sculpted eyebrows
raised and the corner of his mouth
curled. “You know, Haddo, I think your
pal had a point.”
“Enemies from all corners have I!
Mournful is world! To corner will slink
I, to there pine and die. Okay! Okay.
Generous will be I. Can understand I
why might think old comrade Karlini
this.
Okay.
Reasonable is question.
From mind furthest was thing to in
back stab friends. Okay?”
“That’s not a bad start,” Karlini said,
“as long as it goes on to something more
substantive.”
“Box nit sassafras,” muttered Haddo
under his breath, or words to that ef-
fect.
“Well very.
In conscience good
cannot say I that false completely is,
charge that own plans have I, but did

ever ask you me? Never ask did you.”
“I did ask if you were loyal.”
“Loyal am I!” Haddo said, throw-
ing his arms in the air over his head.
“In contract nothing is, prohibit that
would own interests to pursue at same
time as performing of job for you re-
sponsibilities of.
Since are aimed us
both at goal same, especially not pro-
hibit contract would. Than this have
done I nothing more, than to work on
own time for same ends. Did not think
you that gang of your only one was, to
dethrone gods trying were?”
“It’s technically true that your con-
tract gives you a large amount of per-
sonal freedom,” Karlini said, “I’ll ad-
mit that much.
When the two of us
executed it, though, I thought we had
a clear understanding about conﬂict of
interest.”
“Is in conﬂict interest not!”

“All right,” said Karlini, “all right.
I’m willing to let that pass.” He had
to acknowledge, to himself at least,
that he was more intrigued than upset,
anyway, and he didn’t really want to
choke off the conversation either.
“I
just want you to know that Roni and I
would have appreciated the extra help
it looks like you were in a position to
give us, if what I’ve been hearing here
is any indication.”
“How know you extra help gave I
not? Glad am I brought you that up.
Signiﬁcant more is question than real-
ize you. Alluding are you to talents of
magic mine?”
“You’re not going to tell me now that
you ever gave any hint you were a sor-
cerer, too?”
“Not am sorcerer I,” said Haddo.
“Not am sorcerer I in sense same as
are sorcerer you. Did learn I not magic

by study, work I not magic by symbol.
Innate are talents.
Magic of Haddo
part is.”
Karlini glanced at Favored.
“Am I
hearing this right? Is Haddo really say-
ing that that old common folklore wis-
dom stuff about you guys having nat-
ural magical abilities is true? I mean,
sure.
elves and such and useless for-
est magic, everybody knows about that,
but magic that’s good for something?”
“Don’t spread it around,” said Fa-
vored, “but yeah, you big galoots don’t
have a monopoly on magic users. Only
you might as well know Haddo’s still
not giving you the whole story.”
“On side which are anyway you?”
“On the side of not being a bug, pal.
It’s like this, Karlini.
Haddo here’d
have you think he was born doing
magic, that it’s built in, and I won’t
lie to you, some of that’s true, but it’s

not the whole deal at all.
He’s stud-
ied, too, learned magic in the way it’s
been set out and lined up by gods and
you people, with all that symbolic logic
and rigorous math you all’ve saddled it
with. Stop sputtering at me, Haddo.”
“Not is public, this. Quiet this must
keep.”
“You’re the one who thought it was
time to tell some human, you wimp,”
said Favored. “Karlini was your idea.
If you don’t think he’s trustworthy
enough, don’t you think it might have
been a better idea to bring it up before
all this?”
“Trust I Karlini,” said Haddo, “To do
something have to, we, still agree I. Dif-
ﬁcult to change habit is. Easier to cute
be.”
“I think I missed something there,”
Karlini said. “You want to translate?”
“We’re set up to feel like animals

that broke out of a zoo, or’d do better
to stay on some nature reserve,” said
Favored, “but that does have its useful
side. A tiger’s a threat because it can
chew your leg off, not because it can
beat your spell with one of its own, or
because it can out-scheme your power
play.
Things with real human-type
power aren’t cute, things that don’t
threaten you can be. People think of
folks like Haddo or me as scum dregs
or, even worse, quaint little adorable
darlings -” Favored made a disgusted
face and spit toward the ﬂoor “- well, it
may be annoying as hell, but it hasn’t
necessarily been a total loss.”
“Protective
coloration,
isn’t
that
called?” Karlini said.
“Yeah, right.”
“So Haddo’s made a point of keeping
his abilities under wraps,” said Karlini,
“and you nonhuman folks need to be

taken seriously, but you don’t want
anybody to know it.
That’s all very
nice, but, again, why are you telling all
this to me if you don’t want anyone to
know about it, and why now?”
“If will patient be Karlini,” said
Haddo, “get there we will.
As have
heard you, same goals share all we,
and reasons for roughly same. Yet have
differences means about, we.
Thinks
friend Favored, dangerous is work of
Roni.”
“That’s right,” said Favored, direct-
ing a sharp stare at Karlini. “I do. I’ve
never met your wife and I’m sure I
don’t have anything against her, per-
sonally, at least no more than just
because she’s one of you big oafs, but
that’s beside the main point. The point
is this stuff she’s working on. If it gets
out of control, there’s no telling what
could happen, and even if it doesn’t get

out of control it may be more power
than anybody knows how to wrestle.”
“But we’ve taken precautions.” Kar-
lini said, “and -”
“I’m not ﬁnished.
Take a look at
Haddo over there. You ever seen him
without that cloak? You ever seen any-
thing under that hood but those two
glowing red things?
You think that’s
natural?”
“Pardon beg you I?”
“He may be too embarrassed to men-
tion it,” Favored said, “but I’m not. He’s
got magic woven into his makeup. You
start tinkering with the roots of magic,
you might stir up things that’re gonna
be hazardous to his health. And it’s not
just Haddo, either, it’s an awful lot of
us. It may also be a lot of you people,
too, even if you don’t realize it.
“And even that’s not all.
For my-
self, I think that lot would be quite

enough, frankly, thank you very much,
but since I can tell you’re gonna be
a hard sell, I’ll give you the clincher.
None of that research your wife’s up
to is even necessary. If we play things
right and just do a lot of keeping quiet
over on the sidelines, I think this po-
litical stuff going on with the gods will
settle things our way. We’re not gonna
have to ﬁght them outright, we’re not
gonna need this goddamned arms race
you’re starting, all we’ve gotta do is be
smart.”
“You think,” said Karlini.
“What if
you’re wrong?
If you’re wrong, we’ve
got no fall-back position; we’re back at
the beginning, or worse. Even if you’re
right and we don’t need to use the new
stuff to ﬁght the gods or undermine
them, it’s still new knowledge and it’s
still valuable. There’ll be no end to the
ways we’ll all think of to use it. We’ve

got extra precautions coming out of our
ears, I told you that: nothing’s going
to get out of control. The research is
moving so promisingly, too, it would be
silly to stop it all now, which is what I
presume you’d like us to do? I presume
that’s ﬁnally the real subject of this
little meeting?”
Favored-of-the-Gods sighed.
“I’m
not surprised that’s your reaction. I’ve
been in enough contact with Haddo
to know what you were likely to say.
I also know you’ve only got Haddo to
vouch for me: you’ve never seen me
before and don’t know who or what I
really am.
I realize all that.
I’d be
happier if you quit your fooling around
where you shouldn’t be, you under-
stand that well enough, but I suppose
you’re not going to do that just on my
say-so. I’m a Fabricator, too - I know
what it’s like not to want to give up

a neat line of research just because
somebody you’ve never met tells you
to. I’ll even admit there’s something to
what you say about not putting all the
eggs under one hen.”
Favored scowled. “So I’m gonna be a
wimp, too. Keep working on your own
front, see if I care. But do me a favor?
Do yourself a favor, do everybody a fa-
vor - go as slowly and as carefully, and
as quietly, as you possibly can.
And
pay attention to what Haddo has to tell
you.”
“Haddo?” said Karlini. “Of course I
listen to Haddo’s input, when he says
something that’s not a complaint or
a contract grievance. If he’s got com-
ments or suggestions, of course I’ll
listen to them.”
Haddo snorted.
He tilted his hood
back and to the side, and his red eye-
things combined to shoot Karlini an

“oh, come on now” kind of look. “With
subtleness been trying have I, to your
impression of me change.
Of time
waste has been it. Blind even to obvi-
ous are you.”
“That’s not true!” said Karlini. “It’s
not fair.”
“Think you of what say would Roni,”
Haddo told him.
“Well,” Karlini said, “all right. Maybe
So why aren’t you talking to her in-
stead of me?”
“Look,” said Favored. “Don’t change
the subject.
If your image of Haddo
the faithful sidekick hadn’t been blown
apart here, you’d still keep plugging
him into the role you’d already carved
out for him; he’d be a supporting char-
acter in your life with a no-negotiation
predeﬁned role. Right? Now you just
take this and chew on it. Haddo repre-
sents himself and a whole bunch of us,

too, and you’ve just got to accept that.”
“You should be having this meeting
with Max, not me,” Karlini said. “After
all, he’s been the one who set this plan
up; he’s the prime motivator, he’s the
main plotter in most everything we’re
all doing. The research was his idea in
the ﬁrst place, based on his concepts.”
“Petulant now sound you,” Haddo
pointed out.
“Don’t you change the subject,” said
Karlini. “Why me and not Max? When
he ﬁnds out the work’s slowing down
again because of more safety quibbles,
you know he’s not going to like that.
Don’t tell me about dangerous, I’ve
seen Max mad.”
“Uh,” said Favored, exchanging an
unreadable glance with Haddo. “Okay.
Here it is, then, straight out on the
table, since that’s the way you want it.
We don’t exactly trust your pal Max.

I sure don’t. He’s a little too gung-ho
about
this
whole
game-against-the-
gods things to make me comfortable.
He could ...
get carried away with
his plots and his plans and kick off
something really nasty. Okay, there it
is.”
“ ... I see,” said Karlini. “I don’t agree
with you. I think you’re wrong.”
“I’m sure you do,” said Favored. “Will
you do this much, anyway? Keep this
conversation to yourself? Don’t blow it
all to your friends.”
“I don’t know. What about -”
“Of course don’t blab it to your wife.”
“I don’t like it,” Karlini said reluc-
tantly, “but I’ll do it.
For the time
being I won’t talk to anybody about
this, not even Roni. Are you satisﬁed?”
“You’re not a bad sort, guy,” Favored
said. “I think we may end up meeting
again. Right now, though, it’s time for

me to get out of here and get to work;
we’ve been pushing our luck as it is.”
“But what about -”
“Catch you later.” Favored ﬁnished
lowering himself down into his vehicle
and slammed the hatch shut behind
him.
The legs retracted, Flotarobolis
chugged and lifted off, executed a turn-
and-bank that would have done credit
to Haddo’s bird, and swooped toward
its hole in the ﬂoor.
“All night wait will you?” said Haddo.
He was standing impatiently by the ta-
ble, making a tapping noise beneath
his cloak against the ﬂoor.
Karlini rose and followed him to-
ward the stairs.
“How am I going to
deal with you now?” he said, half to
himself; he was a little shocked to hear
how plaintive his own tone sounded. “I
always had the impression you enjoyed
working for me, even if you do like to

complain a lot. Were Roni and I just
convenient tools for you, just a means
to an end? We always liked you, and
we thought you liked us, too.”
“In the world more than liking is -”
began Haddo.
“How do you expect me to believe
anything you tell me now?” Karlini
said heavily.
Haddo didn’t really have an answer
for that.
They walked out onto the
street and angled toward the human
core of Oolsmouth. After awhile, Kar-
lini said, “Did this meeting at least
have anything to do with the immedi-
ate problem of Groot and the boat?”
“Is connected everything,” said Haddo
“Only out to ﬁgure have is which con-
nection which.”
“Was that remark supposed to be
helpful?”
“Is not in general useful philoso-

phy?”
“Not as useful as some straightfor-
ward help would be, no.”
“In your soul no poetry is,” Haddo
muttered darkly. “Left turn we here.”
They had almost reached the river,
by the smell of it, and by the glimpses
of empty space opening up at the ends
of some of the cross streets. “What does
my soul have to do with anything?”
said Karlini.
“My point,
this exactly is,” said
Haddo.
“What point?
Are you planning to
tell me how my soul is supposed to bail
out Groot?
Wait a minute - doesn’t
Groot live somewhere around here?”
“Could be,” Haddo said dryly.
Karlini suddenly noticed that Haddo
was no longer leading him straight
down a street, but rather up to the side
entrance of a block of ﬂats, up to it and

through a door, in fact, and into a dark
inner hallway. Doors and stairs to the
individual apartments opened along
the hallway’s length in the dim light
from the street. Haddo, as always, dis-
played his ability to proceed without
hesitation in the gloom. At the third
door on the right, or perhaps it was the
fourth, he knocked softly. After a mo-
ment they heard a creak of ﬂoorboards
from behind the door, and a voice said,
“Who is it?”
Karlini, waiting again for Haddo
for handle this, was surprised to feel
a kick against his shin.
“Him tell,”
hissed Haddo.
“The Great Karlini,” Karlini told the
door. “And Haddo.”
Bolts clanked back and the door
eased open, so they slid inside.
The
man who’d spoken ﬁnished fastening
the door again before unhooding his

lamp.
“Julio?” said Karlini.
“Yes, of course, Meester Karlini.”
said Julio, tramping barefoot in his
bathrobe into the room.
“Thank you
for coming; I must say I’m glad you’re
here. I was surprised when I got your
message that you were on your way
-you must have had the devil’s own
time tracking me down, with all the
excitement there’s been. You and your
sorcerous ways, I suppose.”
“I guess,” said Karlini, staring at
Haddo, who was making a show of ex-
amining the tatty wallpaper coming
down at the top and peeling open at
the seams.
“This hideout isn’t being watched as
far as I’ve been able to determine, so
we’re free to talk and plan here. Might
I get you some refreshment?”
They settled down with mugs of

coffee, or Julio and Karlini did, at
least, and traded stories.
Actually,
the story was mostly Julio’s,
since
Karlini felt Haddo’s eyes on him when-
ever he so much as thought about the
enigmatic session with Favored-of-the-
Gods. That wasn’t the only story Kar-
lini had available to discuss, though.
“An iceberg, you say?” Julio shook
his head. “We didn’t have a thing to do
with that. Perhaps those two strange
characters from this – no, yesterday
-afternoon, perhaps it was their doing.
I thought they might be gods, but then
one of them, the man, said something
that made me think he might be one
of you. Blue eyes, clean-shaven, a bit
sharp-tongued in manner, carrying a
walking stick, of all things.”
A walking stick? “He didn’t give you
his name,” said Karlini, “did he? No, he
wouldn’t have. You’re right, he is one

of ours, sort of.” Maybe. “You said he
was doing most of the talking? Did the
woman he was with seem to be holding
him prisoner?”
“I don’t know,” Julio admitted.
“It
wasn’t the ﬁrst thing on my mind, you
understand.
There did seem to be
something a bit odd between them, but
I thought it might have to do with their
being gods, if that’s what they were. So
you say they weren’t?”
“He’s not,” Karlini said, “but for all
I know she very well might be. Maybe
they’ll help out and maybe they won’t,
but I wouldn’t count on seeing them
again. I’d put my focus on this Council
meeting tomorrow. You still don’t have
any idea what your Dooglas is going to
try to pull?”
“No. Dooglas is still in hiding in his
mansion. I’ve spoken to his usual com-
patriots on the Council and even they

haven’t heard from him. At least that
was what they told me, those I was able
to meet with, but I believe they were
telling the truth. They seemed as con-
fused and curious as any of us.”
“With so much curiosity around,”
Karlini said, “they’ll probably have a
full house at the session. Is that good
for Groot?”
“With the evidence of the torture
warrant and Dooglas’ signature on it,
you would have to say so. Except for
Dooglas’ behavior. That concerns me.”
“Of himself sure is he acting,” com-
mented Haddo. “Perhaps ally has he,
too.”
“Yes,” Julio agreed.
“That god Sa-
priel the warrant mentions. And don’t
forget the delegation of torturers - no
one knows where they came from, and
somehow they managed to give the po-
lice squad the slip. Dooglas has quite

an unusual number of men-at-arms at
his property, too.
If it was up to the
Council, yes, I think they’d shut this
nonsense down, but Dooglas worries
me.”
Karlini adjusted his posture, bal-
anced uncomfortably as he was on the
front edge of the sagging couch; he
didn’t know what might try to climb
down his pants if he put more of him-
self in contact with the cushions, and
especially their back recesses.
“Well,
you may not have been able to ﬁnd
that communicator magician of yours,
Sy Gazoont, but I’m here, and Shaa’s
on the way in, too. I’ll tell you about
that in a minute. And - wait a second.
Does the Council still meet in that
Hall of the People place? The one with
all the scavenged pre-Dislocation stuff,
with that round meeting chamber and
the metal ﬂoor?”

“Yes,” said Julio, “exactly so.
Why
do you ask? Do you have something in
mind?”
“Maybe,” Karlini said. “I think I do.
Look, Haddo, can you get back in touch
with Fa - with that other fellow you
know?”
“Could be,” Haddo said cautiously.
“Idea what is?”
“Okay, listen to this . . . ”

Chapter13
THE RAPTURE OF
THE GODS
SO THERE I WAS.
Squirm as I might, and I’d been do-
ing a lot of that, I can assure you, my
alternatives still looked as limited as
they’d been all along.
There was no
doubt I’d been getting a little carried
away with the current skullduggery,

and especially with the luck that had
continued to roll my way since we’d ar-
rived in Oolsmouth. True, Soaf Pasook
hadn’t turned up yet. The closer I got
to roping him in, though, the closer I
got to the problematic moment when
Zhardann and Jill confronted him only
to discover he didn’t know anything
about the ring or his supposed collab-
oration with me in my presumptive
role as Gashanatantra; when that hap-
pened, the jig would be up.
Even if
they merely managed to catch up with
Sapriel, the god who was apparently
behind the raid on Pasook, my story
would be blown as soon as he told
them his attack had had nothing to do
with some crummy ring.
What was the alternative, though?
I could just try to bug out, leaving
Oolsmouth and Jill and Zhardann.
I
wasn’t sure I could; it wasn’t clear that

they’d let me.
Also, the time hadn’t
been a total loss in itself.
I’d been
ﬁnding out some very interesting new
details about the gods, and potentially
about my own situation.
After all,
Gashanatantra had to be involved here
one way or the other, either through
Jill, his wife, Zhardann, his look-alike,
Pasook, his supposed associate, or Sa-
priel, whose raid on Pasook could the-
oretically have been an attempt to get
at Gashanatantra himself at second
hand. For that matter, if you wanted to
think deviously enough, in a sufﬁcient
haze of double-back stratagems and
tricky schemes, the motivation behind
Sapriel’s strike could have been aimed
at Gash through his contact with me.
I realized there was a chance I’d
been hanging around these folks too
much.
Their own reﬂexive double-
crossing and check-behind-your-back

mentality was certainly rubbing off.
Still, that didn’t change the fact that
my involvement with Zhardann had
put me in a position to have a chance
at helping out Groot, and by extension
Karlini, Shaa, et al. But the closer I
came to Pasook or Sapriel, the closer
things were going to be cut. The sig-
niﬁcant danger, of course, was that the
things to feel that blade were going
to be extremities attached to my own
body.
Not that I had a choice, really. The
way to play this out was to keep on
moving along with them, doubts and
questions or not, on the trail of the ring,
or to be more precise, the wild-goose
chase after the ring I knew wasn’t
there.
It was somewhere, that much
I did know, but it sure wasn’t in the
corner of the woods we were looking.
In the midst of my own fancy footwork,

danced in reaction to the steps I’d been
confronted with, my basic hope was
that I hadn’t outsmarted myself and
left myself in the process of tripping
over my own pair of left feet. The more
twists this thing took, the harder it
was getting to remember who’d heard
which story and how I was supposed
to act with them, and who-all I had
to worry about actually showing up on
the scene.
I’d
convinced
Jill
and
Zhardann
that I (whom they assumed to be
Gashanatantra) had been in league
with a partner, and that the partner
had double-crossed me and now had
the ring we’d teamed up to obtain. I’d
let them decide for themselves who
this partner actually was, trying to
seem cryptic as part of the process,
and now here we were, struggling to
track this mythical partner down. The

main thing that could happen to get me
off the hook would be to encounter the
real person they thought I was. Com-
ing across the authentic Gash could be
a mixed blessing at best for me. Not
only could he blow my assumed cover
if he wanted, but knowing him even to
the superﬁcial extent I did, he’d proba-
bly take immediate and dire remedial
action for my hubris in impersonating
him in the ﬁrst place, even though it
had been done involuntarily and by
default.
The same could be the case,
of course, if the new guy with whom I
was now involved who looked identical
to Gash, the one I knew as Zhardann,
turned out to have been Gash himself
all along; in that case, though, I would
probably turn out to have been part of
Gash’s ongoing scheme myself anyway.
There was simply nothing I could do
about it.

“This is the address,” I stated.
It had been close enough for an easy
walk from Zhardann’s place. Zhardann
or his agents had done well in choos-
ing the house on the Lane of Wealth
as the site for his base of Oolsmouth
operations; not only was it convenient
to the city center, it had turned out
to be agreeably close to several other
locations I could see myself having
the need to visit.
The ﬁrst of these
had been the home of Meester Neville
Hanglebord Dooglas, erstwhile Coun-
cillor and adversary of the incarcerated
Groot, in front of which Jill and I now
stood.
I’d already taken a turn around
Oolsmouth
seeing
the
local
sights,
of
course,
and
between
Julio
and
Zhardann’s local contact, who was now
on call back at the house, I’d heard
enough about Dooglas himself to for-

mulate some idea of what to expect,
so I was not exactly rocked back in
astonishment to see where the street
address and the directions had actu-
ally brought us. The wall around the
block was stone, and what we had been
able to see of the main building as we
approached, before we got so close that
the looming bulk of the wall shielded
it from sight, was hacked from rock as
well; rock, and a lot of it.
“How do you propose to get in there?”
Jill asked, implying by her delivery
that she was humoring a fool, and that
a minute from now she’d step in to
sweep me away and tidy things up the
way a competent person would have
arranged it in the ﬁrst place; not to be
catty, but this was frankly looking to
be her usual tone.
“Not
by
breaking
and
entering,
if that’s what your question had in

mind.”
“Isn’t that what detectives do?”
“Sometimes,”
I
said,
walking
on
down the sidewalk toward the guard
booth I could see protruding onto the
sidewalk where the driveway entered
the compound from the street.
Jill
lengthened her stride to match me.
“Detecting isn’t a one-trick affair,” I
went on.
“You have to have a whole
repertoire of possibilities.”
“You’re not planning to ask them to
let you in?” she said mockingly.
“Why not?” I said.
“I washed my
face.” I’d also borrowed a fancy cloak
from the stock of clothing that had
come with the house, royal blue with
a crimson lining and a fur-trimmed
ruff; not what I think of as my best col-
ors, but it had a certain overstated
touch of ﬂagrancy about it that I
thought was well-suited to the pre-

vailing Oolsmouth style. “If you want,
though, I’m willing to let you pull your
part of the weight, rather than hogging
all the pleasure for myself.”
“I’m having my own fun watching
you squirm,” she told me.
“I hate to be a spoilsport, but would
you rather have your fun,” I responded,
“or the ring? Partner? Just so I’ll know
for the future, let’s say?”
“Why choose? Being one of us means
having it all,
don’t you remember
that?”
“You’re being shortsighted again.”
“Am I now. Tell me then, O Husband,
teach me the proper attitude for suc-
cess with these grubby little people you
like so much.”
“Watch again, then, and learn.” I
hadn’t really had my mind on the dis-
cussion, to be honest, and had been
responding mostly out of rote; I was

getting thoroughly fed up with this
superior-class-dumping-on-the-scum-
of the-earth repartee. I was hoping I
wouldn’t get so disgusted I’d inadver-
tently lash back and break my cover.
There were bigger things to worry
about at the moment, though.
“Planning to unleash your power
against them, then, are you?” she said.
“And after you counseled us to avoid
revealing our true selves, to refrain
from -”
“Some
judicious
escalation
may
not be out of proportion for a place
like this,” I murmured.
We had just
come abreast of the main gate and
its standing platoon of goons,albeit
well-manicured, liveried ones.
Each
was wearing a matching orange jacket
bearing on its back another one of
these junky insignias;
probably the
Arms of the House of Dooglas, or some

such nonsense.
The only element of
the design I could make out was a styl-
ized sailing ship embedded in a ﬂuffy
cloud. Ahead of us was the wide car-
riageway leading ahead to the house,
which from this angle was clearly more
of a small castle. Between the two of
us and the castle door, though, was
that goon platoon I mentioned, and
the gate, and a few dogs who had
obviously been cross-bred with hip-
popotami and hadn’t been fed since
they’d emerged from the vat, and the
tingle of some unquestionably nasty
sorceries wound into the wrought-iron
of the fence grating and spread for
good measure around the grounds. No
way was anybody getting me to sneak
into that place, unless a convenient
secret underground passage came to
light and all the dogs were stricken by
some incapacitating and virtually in-

stantaneous canine plague. “All right,
then,” I said to Jill, “shut your stupid
mouth and let someone who knows
what they’re doing handle this.”
I wasn’t even looking at her and
I could still clearly feel her begin to
seethe with menace; I could just imag-
ine the look on her face. Three more
steps took me face to-face with the
gatekeeper. “Dooglas,” I said.
He was looking at Jill, and he couldn’t
take his eyes off her.
Not that he
seemed to be struck with her beauty,
which was not insigniﬁcant, although
his lids were opened unnaturally wide
and the eyeballs had protruded as
though he’d come down with a sudden
attack of thyroid fever.
I’d seen that
look on sightseeing men before, but it
generally went along with a touch of
slack-jawed drooling, rather than the
kind of picture the rest of this guy’s

face was presenting.
With the blood
drained from his face, his tanned skin
had gone the kind of white you usu-
ally ﬁnd on the boneless mollusks that
hang out under the rocks in a swamp.
He gulped, and said, “No one enters.”
“No one but us,” I stated. “Dooglas
has been treating with our associates.
Now we have arrived ourselves. Open
the gate.”
“He has, at that,” said the guard, in
a voice that was barely audible, per-
haps because he seemed to be in the
process of swallowing his tongue. He
backpedaled, revealing behind himself
as he retreated the small walkthrough
gate at the side of the big one.
I wrinkled my nose and gave him a
little sneer as I passed; I would have
looked down on him except he was
about a hand’s-span taller than I was.
At the moment, though, he gave the

impression of a man who’d been bitten
by a paralyzing adder and on falling
over on his face had found himself in
a pit of quicksand. The word went out
ahead of us, I was happy to see, and so
their handlers kept the dogs from leap-
ing for our throats. Still, it wasn’t until
we’d gone all the way up the driveway
into the central courtyard and were
through the two-story arm-thick front
doors cooling our heels in the entry
hall that I started feeling solid relief;
the dogs were outside, but we were
in.
I could hear the hum of distant
voices down a corridor that snaked off
around the inside of the castle paral-
leling the lines of the courtyard and
ﬁgured that was probably the direction
of the building’s business ofﬁce section.
Where Dooglas himself would be found,
though, I wouldn’t have ventured to
guess.

“That was a cute trick,” Jill com-
mented; she had simmered down on
the way in.
“Thanks,” I said.
“I thought you
might like it.”
“You haven’t lost your old style.”
She was studying a pair of glowering
life-masks that hung on the wall, her
back toward me. The masks, of a man
with ﬁercely angled eyebrows and a
dour bush of a mustache, and a woman
who was his double for expression, all
deeply etched lines and hard jagged
thoughts, had been beaten from metal
and annealed black. “That was what
drew me to you, did you know that?
Originally?”
“Was it, now.”
“Of course. That dark ﬂair of yours
- oh!” She gave a small shudder of re-
membered delight.
“That deft twist,
your
arabesques
of
deceit
and
be-

trayal, the way your victims found
themselves manipulated without any
idea of how it had really come about,
and for that matter how badly they’d
been screwed. And that cool thin smile
as you watched your designs play out.
I wasn’t the only one to fall for you, you
know.”
“I would hardly have guessed,” I said.
“Anyway, that’s all gone and done with
now.”
“Is it?” said Jill. “Is it really?”
“Trust me.”
“Style,” she said musingly.
“It was
more attractive to watch you use it on
others, I will give you that, but still to
be the object of your attention was an
interesting sensation in its own right.
When you did it to me again just now,
though, it did bring back a touch of
that old magic, just for a moment.”
“Call it one for old times sake, then,”

I said, trying to ﬂash her a cool thin
smile, aloof and sardonic at the same
time. She was still turned away from
me, but verisimilitude in a role looked
like a -
“This way,” said another man from
the goon crew, at the end of the entry
hall.
He led us just around the corner
into a sitting room. It was only early
afternoon and a pleasant day outside,
and in contrast to the usual for stone
castles, with their drafts and chills
and dank rock walls, the interior of
this one was actually comfortable, if
not exactly cozy.
The sitting room,
though, had a totally unnecessary ﬁre
roaring in a large hearth.
A row of
plants across the room in front of the
closed courtyard windows were wilting,
but the man staring into the ﬁre with
one hand outstretched on the mantle

had his smoking jacket ﬁrmly belted
and buttoned all the way up. The way
he was focusing on the ﬁre, I wasn’t
sure he was even aware we’d entered,
bur then he abruptly said, “You’re not
Sapriel.”
“I never said we were,” I told him.
He turned from the hearth. In the
strong red ﬁrelight hitting his face
from the side, pulling out the creases
and lines around his eyes and stretch-
ing down from his nose to the corners
of his mouth, the relationship to the
mask in the hall outside was apparent.
The mask could have been that of his
brother, or his father, or for that matter
of the man himself at a different stage
of his life, or perhaps merely under
different circumstances, but that the
mask was the image of a close relative
was clear. Dooglas was older than I’d
expected, possibly in his late ﬁfties or

even more aged. “What do you want,
then?” he demanded.
“A talk.” I said. “A few words.”
“What signiﬁcance are your words to
me? My time is not yours to waste; I
am a busy man.” By “busy”, he clearly
meant “important,” but then he hadn’t
moved to throw us out, either.
If that was the way he wanted
to play it, though, ﬁne.
“You have
abandoned the bounds of prudence,” I
stated. “You have attracted attention.”
From his smirk, Dooglas seemed to
ﬁnd that funny. “So? What business is
that of mine, with my enemies at my
feet? And who are you to say so?”
“Sapriel may have been fool enough
to treat with the likes of you, but that
doesn’t mean you should draw any
blanket conclusions about your impor-
tance.”
“Or his,” added Jill.

This time he did laugh, throwing his
head back and “heh-heh-heh”ing at the
ceiling. “He said your kind would be
around, yapping at heels like curs after
scraps.” Dooglas took two quick steps
toward me, stared me square in the eye
for an instant, and then jabbed an ex-
tended ﬁnger into my chest. “This for
your prudence,” he announced. “This
for your attention.” He exhaled in my
face, a breath of old garlic and a few
rotten teeth and a heavy dose of some-
thing that had been rancid for at least
six months, then stepped back and
folded his arms. “Touch me if you dare.
He has given me his favor, his favor
and his protection.”
“Well, la-di-dah,” I said. “Since you
obviously have nothing to worry about,
how about sharing your side of the
story with us?”
“All in its good time,” said Dooglas,

“all in its time.” He giggled again.
“Shall I strike him down?” Jill mur-
mured in my ear.
“Don’t bother,” I said, speaking as
much to him as to her. “His comeup-
pance will dawn soon enough.”
“Like curs,” Dooglas repeated. “Like
beetles, like vermin of all sorts.”
“Right. You are Dooglas, Councillor
Douglas, aren’t you?”
“Oh, yes,” he said, “for this moment
at least, oh, yes.”
“Just making sure,” I told Jill.
“This is obviously a waste of time,”
she said.
“You know, I think I agree with you.”
I took another look at Dooglas, preen-
ing himself by the ﬁre, rising up on
his toes and then sinking back down,
watching us with the shining eyes of
somebody who’s just found true re-
ligion.
“Ask yourself this,” I said to

him, “if you’ve a mind left to do it with.
Where will you be if Sapriel’s power
runs out, or even Sapriel himself? We
are not the only ones interested in him.
Do you think he will waste a thought
on you?
Where will you be, you and
your business?
You are not exactly
leaving much to the imagination, are
you, and you have not left yourself
anywhere to retreat.
Is this what a
leading merchant renowned for his
perspicacity would do?”
That didn’t rufﬂe him; nothing was
going to rufﬂe him.
He hadn’t even
been listening, so why should I bother
wasting my voice?
I jerked my head
at the door and Jill preceded me with-
out another word. We didn’t have any
more trouble with the dogs on the way
out than we’d had on the way in. Doo-
glas’ small army of goons was probably
following the same guidelines that had

gotten us into the house on our arrival,
that and the intimidating effect of Jill,
but the way they melted away from
us on our exit could possibly have had
something to do with the expression on
my own face.
“Somehow that didn’t sound like nor-
mal senility,” I said when we’d reached
the street.
I’d heard of god-rapture,
but I’d never actually seen a case up
close. Not every person could handle
the personal attention of a god; all
that power and temptation right there,
staring you in the face, and its wielder
dealing with you as one person to an-
other. Maybe it was some side effect of
projecting a god’s aura, something real
gods learned to use as a weapon, but
whatever the cause, the effect could be
enough to make a previously rational
man take leave of his judgment. Delu-
sions of grandeur had nothing on it,

especially if you lost track of the fact
that there was always a price and lis-
tened instead to the rhetoric that gods
were so good at, about gracing you with
their favor or rewarding you for your
devotion or needing something only
you could provide.
“Not much doubt
about what was going on there.”
“You didn’t ask questions,” Jill said.
“I thought we were there to ﬁnd out
what his role was.”
“I did ask,” I reminded her.
“He
wasn’t answering.
But that doesn’t
mean we didn’t ﬁnd out anyway.”
“Oh, we did, did we?”
“Sure we did, as you know very well.
There’s no reason to act dense with me.
He’s Sapriel’s front man on this Groot
thing, which means he was in with the
bank deal, too, and in return Sapriel
promised him backing for whatever he
plans to do; probably take over the city,

that’s what these guys always seem to
have in mind. By the sound of it, Sa-
priel may have even promised he’d ele-
vate his stature in the world.”
“Or out of it,” said Jill.
“Yeah,” I said, “you’re right. But our
real interest wasn’t in Dooglas; it never
was. He’s just a ﬂunky. No matter how
much goo he’s got in his brain, though,
he’d have to be a total idiot not to let
Sapriel know we were snifﬁng around.
That’ll stir things up, maybe even ﬂush
Sapriel out into the open.”
“It could also send him into hiding.
He’ll certainly have more warning to
prepare his response.”
“Maybe. He had to expect someone
would show up asking questions, so I’d
suspect he already had some plans of
his own to deal with it. I don’t think
it’ll matter.
Anyway, I believe in the
value of stirring as a general token of

principle.”
There was more she could have said,
but she didn’t, and so eventually we
turned onto the Lane of Wealth and
arrived back at the house.
Jill eyed
me again as we climbed the stairs,
but she didn’t even bother to try the
freshening-up ploy again; we’d check
in with Zhardann together. Or at least
I thought that was the plan, until I
pushed open the door of the study.
Zhardann was still there, having
changed into a comfortable lounging
robe in the interim.
At the creak of
the door he looked over to me in the
entranceway, and then glanced back
across the room, to the other man over
by the window.
The new man was
about my height but stockier, with a
shock of straight black hair combed
carefully to the side over his ears and
ﬂopping over his collar at the rear. His

dark eyes were bloodshot, as was his
nose, frankly, but his outﬁt was ﬁne,
all black with silver trim and a bro-
cade neck rufﬂe, if a bit the worse for
apparently having been worn around
the clock for at least the last few days.
Whether he’d really been sleeping in
his clothes was a toss-up, since he was
another character who didn’t look like
he’d been getting a whole lot of sleep
lately in any position.
Although I’d
been repeating the observation enough
to make even myself doubt it, I was
sure I’d never met him before.
He nodded to me across the room in
recognition and pleasant acknowledg-
ment, and said, “Good to see you, my
man.”
I nodded to him in return,
and
touched the handle of my walking
stick to my brow as a quick salute.
As I did this, Monoch gave off a gen-

tle tingly vibration, like a tactile purr,
then quickly subsided again into si-
lence. Rather than remain standing in
the doorway, I went over to the mantle
and leaned back against it as though I
were at ease. “So,” I said.
The newcomer coughed gently, not
in a catarrhy sort of way but as a bit of
opening punctuation. “As I was saying.
I do regret that events have evolved
in the manner you know. Even if the
point is obvious, it must be stated that
I failed to realize the ring would be
so difﬁcult to handle, and so popular
an item as to make it difﬁcult to hold
on to as well.” He gave another little
cough.
“One is sometimes forced to
eat one’s words, or to face an embar-
rassing situation of one’s own making.
One is never happy about this sort of
thing, but we are all mature here, we
all know how the game is played.”

Good gods, I thought. Could this be
the missing Soaf Pasook?
Who else could it be?
But why was he validating the de-
tails of that made-up story I’d told
Zhardann and Jill?
“Indeed we do,” I said in a noncom-
mittal tone.
“The situation is different now, of
course,” he continued, “and I for one
am looking forward with no little antic-
ipation to assisting your new group in
the matter of Sapriel. I have no doubt
that in the process we will succeed in
recovering the ring, and who knows
what else may -”
Jill was still in the doorway.
“An-
other partner?” she said.
“Not just a partner,” Zhardann said.
His ﬁngers steepled in front of his face,
a pleasant smile of the sort I hadn’t
seen any evidence he was capable of

displaying on his face, he was radiat-
ing an aura of, well, outright warmth.
Even I knew him well enough by this
time to see he was trying to focus all
his faculties on buttering up the new
guy.
Pasook.
My own stomach was
doing ﬂip-ﬂops. “From what we were
discussing when you came in, it is clear
that
he
has
signiﬁcant
grievances,
grievances of substance,
grievances,
even, of general signiﬁcance. With his
willingness to issue a formal complaint,
my own empowerment is such that I
may convene a statutory tribunal of
arbitration. An enforceable tribunal.”
From the way Zhardann was star-
ing at Jill as he expounded, I thought
he was telling her to follow his lead
and he’d explain everything later. She
wasn’t buying it. “I don’t know if that’s
such a good idea,” she stated.
“Tri-
bunals have a way of getting out of

hand.”
Zhardann waved his hand as if clear-
ing away a stray wisp of smoke. “Noth-
ing that can’t be handled, and the bat-
tleground would be ours. This would be
a ﬁrst-class chance to force Sapriel to a
confrontation of our own choosing.”
“Are you sure you want the ques-
tion of the ring brought up in public
forum?”
“Scarcely public, my dear.”
“Semi-public,
then,”
Jill
snorted.
“Airing the real story - even part of
the real story - don’t tell me you don’t
think that’s dangerous. If – when - the
ring’s current owner gets identiﬁed,
everybody in on the debate is going to
take off after him or her.”
“That risk can be mitigated,” said
Zhardann, a little of his customary
irritation poking through his sunny
demeanor. “What are we here for, tell

me, if not to take that risk?”
“What indeed?” I contributed. “Well
put.”
Both Zhardann and Jill swung to-
ward me with a startled ﬂinch, as
though they might have forgotten for
a moment that I was there. The new
guy had never entirely taken his eyes
and his small smile of internal amuse-
ment off me. Jill opened her mouth to
lash back at my contribution, no doubt,
but then paused, narrowed her gaze,
looked more closely at me, turned and
directed the same scrutiny on the new
guy, and then glanced back and forth
once again. “Are you two related?” she
said.
“Related?” said the guy, aiming his
pleasant smile at her. “Aren’t we all?”
“Do you really think so?” I added. I
thought I’d been doing a good job of
maintaining my air of know-it-allness

and I wasn’t about to cash it all in over
one out-of-the-hinterlands remark, but
I would really have liked to be able to
ask her just what similarity she felt
she’d detected. I didn’t ﬁnd any obvi-
ous correspondence in physical appear-
ance between the two of us, but at this
stage of the game I knew that was no
evidence one way or the other. Reason-
ing from the way my own situation had
evolved, these gods were used to chang-
ing bodies, or at least to changing the
way their standard bodies appeared,
so Jill must have thought there was
some other familial relationship that
would remain constant between phys-
ical redos.
Probably she was looking
at whatever characteristics she had
recognized me by in the ﬁrst place.
Something in our auras?
She ﬂashed me a sharp-edged grin
with a few too many teeth showing.

“My husband never liked to discuss
family,” she said to no one in particular,
“even when our relationship was such
that we discussed anything.”
“Family is relative,” I said, a bit
lamely, even for me.
“It’s not a strong similarity, at that.”
Jill said ﬁnally.
“One can occasionally get some de-
gree of aural overlap merely from close
collaboration,” the guy said in a helpful
tone. “When the two of us were exam-
ining the opportunity of Pod Dall -”
Pasook, I thought.
No question
about it. Or someone who thought he
was Pasook. Or someone who thought
it was in his interest to think he was
Pasook.
“-
and
particularly
later,
during
the engineering of the ring - well,
there was a certain bidirectional ﬂow,
wouldn’t you say?”

He was talking to me, I realized
with a start. “Well, yes,” I said, “the
ring itself, being fairly tricky, and not
of merely incidental interest from a
purely technical perspective, did re-
quire more than the usual level of
effort.”
“Yes,” Pasook said, “quite.
After
all, the design did have to be robust
enough to suck up one of us, and a
leading Death, at that. A nice piece of
work. Nontrivial, if I do say so.”
“You never used to be that adroit a
technician.” Jill said to me. “Was your
old behavior just a pose? Did you dis-
trust me that far back?”
“Some of us can learn,” I commented.
“What do you mean by that?” she
snapped.
“Why, nothing,” I said, “nothing at
all. I thought learning was supposed to
be one of those virtues with no down-

side, something we were all in favor
of as a matter of principle.
At least
among ourselves, for ourselves.”
“He is good, though, you know,” said
Pasook.
“The system that stabilizes
the conﬁnement matrix, for example -
what did you call it?”
“I thought we agreed those were all
trade secrets.”
“Oh, come, come,” he said. “We’re all
associates here now.”
I realized now what he was doing.
He was trying to force me to reveal
how much I really knew about the ring,
like whether I knew enough to have
actually had my hands on it.
Both
Pasook and I knew that the storyline
he was holding to was a fabrication.
Neither of us could tell that to Jill arid
Zhardann, of course, so he was able
to use my reluctance to risk blowing
my own cover story to lever me into

helping him with his hunt for the ring.
At least that was the way it seemed to
shake out, lacking a stray inconsistent
detail or two. I didn’t know how much
he actually knew, but in any case I
was trapped.
He’d backed me into a
corner; I had to say something that
sounded plausible or I’d raise serious
suspicions.
Fortunately, I had hung
around with Max and Shaa enough
while they were analyzing the ring
to learn something about its matrix
construction. “The parasitic catalysis
shunt,” I said. “The power of the ring’s
occupant is synchronized with the on-
board master-wave and used to boost
the circumscription ﬁeld. It’s like one
of those woven puzzles made of straw,
the kind where you stick a ﬁnger in
each end and then can’t pull it back
out again - the occupant’s own power is
used to immobilize themselves. That’s

also the reason the ring looked so in-
nocuous while it was empty, before the
trap was sprung; so innocuous that a
notoriously sneaky victim could actu-
ally be convinced to pick it up. In its
primed state, the conﬁnement matrix
was folded in its unpowered quiescence
mode with virtually nothing protrud-
ing, especially above the countermea-
sures clutter.
When it was triggered,
though,
the feedback expansion let
loose along with the -”
“Rather diabolical, really,” said Pa-
sook, his voice ﬁlled with admiration.
He was trying to butter me up, now,
or at least to make Jill and Zhardann
think he was. On the other hand, he
might have been genuinely impressed
with my clatter of jargon. If he knew
anything solid about the ring, though,
more than deduction or speculation,
he’d understand that my exposition

had been the authentic article.
Up
to a point. “But you will appreciate -
indeed, it goes without saying - that
the technicalities of the hardware were
less important than the target.”
Jill had taken a seat on the chair by
the hearth, in all probability conclud-
ing that we might be there for a while.
“Are you saying that the power boost
the ring’s wearer receives is beside the
point? You are saying that, of course.”
“Of course he is,” said Zhardann.
“There’s no need to play games with
him.
He knows we know the impor-
tance of Pod Dall.”
“Nobody ever turns down a little ex-
tra power,” I said, “especially when it’s
really somebody else’s, but if it was just
that, we wouldn’t have gone after as
dangerous a target as Dall.”
“And you wouldn’t be who you are,”
added Soaf Pasook.
“Capturing Pod

Dall was a clear move of ‘check’ on the
big board, not that the game is nearly
that simple, you appreciate.”
Zhardann
grunted
and
squirmed
around in his chair, searching for a
new posture of maximal comfort. “The
game has as many sides as players,”
he grumbled.
“Still, the move was
elegant.
Dall was as well-placed as
anyone.
From that strategic position
of his, he could maintain a virtual
lock-down hold on the Abdicationist
and Conservationist factions, both. By
snatching him and penning him up,
the whole power structure is thrown
into disarray. All that from the loss of
a swing vote.”
“Scarcely,” said Pasook, a bit super-
ciliously.
“The strength of Dall was
partly political, as a matter of the
swing of the coalition vote, as you say,
but it was also partly positional in a

much more physical manner, and a
question of raw might.”
“Of course, of course,” said Zhardann,
being conciliatory again.
“It is amaz-
ing, though, is it not, to contemplate
the possibilities that Pod Dall as a
commodity presents that Pod Dall in-
carnate did not?”
“Hmm, yes,” said Pasook, as if the
matter was of academic interest to him.
“Some would like to see Dall freed and
restored to action, or ransomed into
their own custody or control, while
some would just as soon see him disap-
pear forever, never to be seen again.”
“And you?” said Jill. “What did you
want?”
Pasook made a guileless expression
coalesce from the combination of his
dramatically opened eyes and the gen-
tly opened “O” of his mouth. Then he
closed his mouth and merely looked

thoughtful.
“Perspective,” he said
slowly.
“Many of us have lost that,
you know.
A restoration of perspec-
tive, a forced reexamination of tenets
and positions-is that not to the general
good?”
“My husband never did anything for
the general good,” said Jill.
“He is a complex fellow,” said Pa-
sook.
“What is this political struggle
that has us all so polarized based on
in the ﬁrst place, though? At its root
there lies the philosophical question
of Abdication: the Abdicationists want
to relinquish power and let the world
get on with its own affairs, while the
Conservationists, on the other hand,
say, ‘What are you, idiots?,’ to put it
kindly, and to paraphrase the coarser
element among us, the Conservation-
ists like things the way they have been
and think it would be the height of bad

management to throw themselves out
of ofﬁce and privilege, but still they ex-
hibit a spectrum of thought. There are
shades of opinion within the Abdica-
tionist community, too, ranging from a
radical extreme of those who would hie
us back to the Age of Stone, in fact who
would return us all to a mere mortal
state, and from that nihilistic fringe all
the way to those centralists who would
make changes only in slight degree,
merely loosening the yoke of dominion
by a notch, or perhaps two.
“Then there is the religious aspect.
I shy away from religion, myself, and
especially questions of theology,” said
Soaf Pasook, “since lack of certitude on
the part of someone in our position is to
my mind irritatingly paradoxical, and
I dislike dwelling on either irritations
or paradox, let alone both together. In-
stead -”

“Certitude?” I said. What the hell, I
was interested.
“What does godhood mean?” Pasook
said, with some heat. Then he looked
a bit abashed at his own outburst. “If
we have no ﬁrm answers, who does?
Some have gotten uncomfortable with
living the self-made life when there
may be those who ... outrank us actu-
ally around somewhere.
This faction
thinks that any deitical beings who
exceed us would probably be quite
annoyed with our carryings on.
An-
other subgroup thinks, in line with cer-
tain ancient and presently suppressed
scriptures, that regardless of hierar-
chy or deitogenesis those who wish to
be more than human should aspire to
higher standards as well, rather than
just behaving like more powerful hu-
mans, and gangster humans at that.
Harsh words, indeed, but of course I

merely quote, in an attempt to fairly
represent a position.”
“There are those,” Zhardann said
carefully, “who would call this kind
of talk heretical, and would call for
punishment.”
“What is the point of being what we
are if one has to toe an ideological line?
Practicalities, yes, there are certainly
reasons for those, but restraint of dis-
course among ourselves?
No, I think
not.
Who can afford to abandon the
search for wisdom?”
“This is just a lot of talk,” said
Jill disgustedly.
“What does another
search for wisdom have to do with Pod
Dall? The only wisdom he understood
is the wisdom of power. Look at him
now, without it - that pretty much
proves his position, doesn’t it?
You
were talking about perspective. What’s
Dall’s perspective?”

“You can ask him, if you want,” Pa-
sook said, “when we recover the ring.”
“Let me get this straight,” said Jill,
pointing a ﬁnger at him. “You wanted
to make people take a new look at
their politics by turning Dall into a
trade good. That’s it? What then? No,”
she shook her head, “it doesn’t wash.
This wasn’t some high and mighty act
of philosophical nobility, you’re not go-
ing to get me to believe that. You’d be
the kingpin, you’d be the one in charge.
You’d be the one who’d proﬁt.”
“Yes,
of course,” said Pasook,
as
though amazed that the issue should
be any less than obvious.
“Harshness doesn’t suit you,
my
dear,” Zhardann said to Jill.
“Philos-
ophy is interesting, of course, we all
have our hobbies, but there’s nothing
inappropriate about combining axiol-
ogy with business; quite the contrary.

Especially with the stakes so high.
There’s nothing that says that even a
search for wisdom has to be free, that
no one should beneﬁt.”
“Just so,” Pasook agreed.
“So as you say,” Zhardann continued,
“the two of you -” he nodded coolly in
my direction “- had intended to play
the role of pivotal middlemen and deal-
makers between the Abdicationist and
Conservationist factions without actu-
ally declaring for one or the other, on
the grounds that those who hold the
balance - the kingmakers, if you will -
will wind up with the most important
role in continuing affairs whichever
side wins out in the end. If neither side
has an out-and-out triumph, of course,
your value would be even greater. Ac-
cordingly,
your real interest would
seem to have been concentrated in see-
ing the struggle continue.
All this is

moot now, of course, but it is always
helpful to understand where one’s as-
sociates have come from.”
“As you say,” said Soaf Pasook.
“So, to be blunt about it,” Zhardann
said, “why is all this moot now? Why
are you before us now, rather than
wielding the ring, with or without your
former partner?”
“I would think it would be obvious.”
Zhardann tightened up his tone,
letting a bit of his usual peevishness
loose into the room. “I have had quite
enough of things that should be ob-
vious.
For once, I would like to see
something laid out on the ﬂoor in front
of me in unambiguous detail. Shall I
restate the question?”
“No,” said Pasook, sounded a bit
wounded himself, “no.
That won’t be
necessary, I’m sure.
A break with
normal etiquette, but these are not

normal times, are they, if indeed they
ever were. Yes, well. As you know, the
two of us broke our collaboration –” I
raised an eyebrow at Pasook, which
clearly caught his gaze since he had
been looking with a contemplative
manner directly into my face “- when I
determined I could make better use of
the ring alone than the two of us could
together. His own power and, one must
say, his vigilance, were drained - from
managing the operational aspect of em-
placing and retrieving the ring, as well
as the ring engineering task, of course
- and so he had left himself in a state of
vulnerability.”
“Hmph,” I said, hoping for a menac-
ing tone. Why hadn’t they asked me all
this stuff? Well, actually, they had, sort
of, only I’d squirmed out of answering
because I wouldn’t have known what
I was talking about.
Pasook, though,

was being forthcoming to the point of
exsanguination.
Why lecture us on
stuff we all presumably knew?
He had to buy his way in, that could
be part of it. I’d come into the game
on my own terms.
At least that was
how they’d interpreted it; even so, I’d
made them treat me as an equal rather
than relying on their favor. Pasook, on
the other hand, was a supplicant. He
wanted their help, although Zhardann
was willing to treat it as a two-way
street when it suited him. He would
also presumably want their protec-
tion from my wrath; after all, he had
double-crossed me, or so the story went.
Now that I was hearing it from some-
one else, maybe even I’d start to believe
it.
“I came down here to Oolsmouth,”
Pasook went on, “and thought that
would be the end of it. Then -”

“Why?” said Jill. “Why did you think
that would be the end of it? Why didn’t
you think he’d come after you?”
Pasook looked straight at me and
said, “He’s not what he was. He has
gone soft. He’s due for retirement.”
That rocked them back in their
chairs. Me, too, even though I’d been
expecting something of the sort even-
tually. All heads swiveled toward me
again. “That may have been the case
at the time,” I said in a steady, almost
pleasant tone, an almost-genial smile
on my lips, “but softness is not an
irreversible condition.”
Perhaps they saw the suggestion of
something hard and noxious cross my
face then; I certainly tried hard enough
to send it there.
I thought of adding
a line about ignoring the implications
at their peril, but it would have been
less than subtle and, more than that,

gratuitous. Instead, I contented myself
with saying. “Jill-tang can attest to my
present temperament.”
The heads swung toward Jill.
She
merely screwed up one corner of her
mouth and scowled out at nothing in
particular, and let the heads ultimately
drift back to ﬁx on Pasook.
“That was the situation then,” he
said ﬁnally. “The strong deal with the
weak, that is the way things go. If the
weak become strong, well, that is a
different matter.” That was probably
as much of an apology as I would ever
get out of him, especially considering
that none of it had ever actually hap-
pened. “When I arrived in Oolsmouth,
there were certain matters requiring
my attention at the bank, so -”
“The Oolvaan Mutual Bank?” said
Zhardann.
“Yes. Quite. After attending to busi-

ness and after a judicious interval, I
turned my consideration again to the
ring.”
“This ‘business’ you mentioned,” I
said. “What was its nature?”
“Loans,” said Pasook.
“Capitaliza-
tion. Strictly questions of mortal com-
merce. I understand you’ve been inter-
esting yourself in my customer Groot
- yes, some of this activity concerned
him, but not to any degree out of the
ordinary; issues of extending credit for
new trade voyages, that sort of thing.
It was not until -”
“Did he learn about the ring?” I
asked. “Could he have learned about
the ring?”
Pasook tipped his head to one side
and seemed to consider the proposal se-
riously. “No,” he said. “No. Even when
I began to deploy feelers, gingerly of
course, which was later, and even from

looking at it from the current vantage
point, I don’t see Groot’s direct hand in
what transpired. Why do you ask?”
“Conﬁrmation, that’s all.
Groot’s
reverses seemed to be a byproduct of
the thing between Sapriel and you,
not a deliberate stab directed at him
by Sapriel. A direct stab, yes, but by
Sapriel’s stooge.”
“What is this?” said Zhardann.
“Let’s hear my old friend out,” I sug-
gested. “If the question remains unan-
swered, I will address it myself. Please
proceed, my old friend.”
“Yes,” said Pasook, swallowing. He
was certainly playing his role all the
way through.
“As I said, I began to
carefully send out word about the ring,
about Dall. The ﬁrst I realized Sapriel
was even in Oolsmouth was when he
attacked.
That time, where he was
strong, I was weak.
My precautions

were insufﬁcient. In retrospect, I was
mistaken to try to do this thing on my
own. At that moment, though, I found
myself Sapriel’s prisoner.”
“And the ring?” I said.
“The ring, yes, the ring, well that
was another matter. I didn’t have the
ring with me, of course, you under-
stand. To pressure me, Sapriel began
to dismantle my operations; in particu-
lar, the Oolvaan Mutual Bank. He had
recruited a local agent -”
“Dooglas,” inserted Jill .
“- yes,
quite,
Dooglas,
which of
course complicated matters, since Doo-
glas had his own ends to satisfy as well.
Among those of us in this room, that
pressure probably would have been
enough, but Sapriel chose to addition-
ally apply more direct force.” He raised
the edge of his tunic.
Scabbed welts
punctuated by jagged ﬂayed strips and

the spot-punctures of thorns covered
his skin. He had been holding himself
rather stifﬂy in the chair, now that I
thought about it.
Gingerly, he eased
the fabric back down.
“Ultimately I
capitulated. The ring was hidden some
distance out from the city.
While Sa-
priel was engaged in collecting it, I was
able to win free. And so here I am.”
What was his game? To my way of
thinking, he was playing to the story
I’d established too obviously for any
element of chance. Pasook had to know
more than he was letting on. But why,
what were his motives?
To get back
at Sapriel for raiding Pasook’s own
bank, for one; that was a no-charge
given.
To toy with Gashanatantra?
That possibility was more interesting.
If Pasook really had been Gash’s asso-
ciate in the ring bit, if that much had
been accurate deduction rather than

invention, he could have had a plan in
mind where he would show up here,
encounter the real Gash, and horn in
on his new action. Surely Pasook could
tell that I wasn’t him.
Jill, Gash’s
wife, hadn’t known the difference, but
then she hadn’t seen him in a long
time; Pasook, though, would have been
hanging around with Gash much mort
recently.
But Pasook was obviously a sneaky
customer in his own right. If he’d been
surprised to ﬁnd me instead of Gash,
he could have smoothly rolled with it
and decided to play along, at least un-
til he could get me alone and ﬁnd out
why Jill and Zhardann thought I was
Gash, and where the real Gash really
was. He’d have enough threat hanging
over my head to back me into a corner
and make me his tool. I could see him
thinking that way, in any case.

What if Pasook hadn’t been Gash’s
associate, though?
What if we’d all
guessed wrong?
Still, there was a
Pasook, who could have heard about
our speculations and decided to live
up to them, ﬁtting himself into our
ongoing plot. Again, in that scenario
he could be out to get a piece of the
action against Sapriel, or to use us to
help him get back at Sapriel for raid-
ing his bank. Also again, if he knew
I wasn’t Gash, he’d ﬁgure I was in no
position to contradict him. Under this
construction,
though,
where Pasook
hadn’t been in partnership with Gash,
he might have no reason not to think I
wasn’t Gash after all.
There was another outside possibil-
ity, but I ﬁgured it was so loopy that it
couldn’t be true, even in the middle of
an admittedly loopy state of affairs. He
couldn’t be that devious, could he?

Downside risks and all, I dearly
wanted to get Pasook alone for a one-
on-one.
I doubted that was in the
ofﬁng, or that it would have been a
good idea even if I could arrange it,
but it was entirely possible that here
was someone who actually knew the
answer to something.
“Torture, you said,” stated Zhardann.
“Yes, there was that,” Pasook admit-
ted with a bit of embarrassment.
“It
was not, shall we say, an overly pleas-
ant experience.
I had not been keep-
ing up my personal protection as well
as I might, but then who would expect
one of us to break with normal practice
so violently? These things just aren’t
done.”
“No,” said Zhardann, “no, they are
certainly not. Shocking. All the more
reason to put him in line. We are all
together on this?”

We were. “We must confer further,”
Zhardann continued, “but I, for one,
would like to take a break.” He pushed
himself out of the depths of the arm-
chair cushions and turned solicitously
to Pasook. Pasook, though, had man-
aged to rise from his own chair, if a bit
gingerly. He walked carefully toward
the door. Then, as he came abreast of
my position, he paused and gazed at
me, which was only fair since I had
been gazing at him.
He approached
me a few steps and stuck out his right
hand. I looked at him, and it, and then
extended my own. As our palms met,
I felt an electric tingle in my knuck-
les followed immediately by a sharp
lancing pain in my palm, as though a
large nail had suddenly been pounded
through the center of my hand. Blue
sparks arced out from between our ﬁn-
gers. I thought I heard a low sizzle, too,

but before I could even jerk my hand
away Pasook had closed his own ﬁn-
gers in a tight grasp around my wrist.
Before I could get out a yelp, either,
the pain was gone as abruptly as it
had descended.
Zhardann was talking with Jill over
by the doorway, their faces averted.
They appeared to have noticed nothing.
Soaf Pasook was grinning at me, but it
was a different, craftier grin than he
had showed us before. He pumped my
hand once, then released it. “We must
speak,” Pasook said, “my old friend.”
He turned to the door and was gone.
My hand wasn’t smoking. The skin
over my palm appeared completely
normal - no scorch marks, no holes,
no rush of blood. I felt exhausted, as
though I’d just ﬁnished running down
from Roosing Oolvaya carrying the
horse on my back, say. The odd part

was that, in a strange way and at the
same time, I seemed to be more en-
ergetic, as though the zap had sent a
transfusion of lightning through my
heart and off into my limbs.
Long
hours, poor eating habits, and maybe
the raw power of the burst itself; I
couldn’t imagine what else it could be.
I’d never experienced anything like it
before.
I squared my shoulders and headed
for the door myself.
At least Pasook
had sounded interested in talking to
me.
For some reason, though, the
thought seemed to have lost some of
its appeal.
Life is just dangerous, I
guess, unless perhaps you’re somebody
like an accountant.
No, that wasn’t
right, either: Julio was the next thing
over from an accountant, and he was
in a mess, too.
At least I had now
had a better idea of how to help him

and Groot, and of where matters were
going.
It was sure going to be interesting if
Sapriel actually did have the ring.

Chapter14
A CAPTAIN AND
HIS CREW
“MIND THAT SKIFF, NOW!” called
Shaa.
“Aye,” said the mate, apparently pay-
ing not the slightest attention to him.
The coxswain continued to pound his
drum at the front of the quarterdeck,
the crew kept time with their oars,

with surprising gusto, Shaa was happy
to see; in short, everything was as it
should be, even with the wind gone
and the ship now moving across the
current as it headed through the maze
of ships toward the main public dock
of Oolsmouth.
They cleared the skiff
Shaa had mentioned in his warning
with a tidy expanse of empty water to
spare and headed in the direction of a
barge plodding slowly at a right angle
to their path, on a converging course.
While Shaa was considering the appro-
priate instruction for that situation,
Tildamire appeared at the head of the
stairs, followed by Roni.
They were
both wearing cloaks with hoods.
“These things should be banned,”
Roni muttered, ﬂapping a long sleeve
out of her way.
“Are you acquiring a particular taste
for fashion, after all these years?” Shaa

asked, diverting his attention from the
needs of the ship. The crew, ably led
by the new mate, could obviously take
care of themselves for a moment or
two.
“Don’t give me that ‘all these years’
nonsense,” she told him.
“The most
ridiculous part of these carryings-on
has always been the disguises. I mean,
look at you.”
“Yes, don’t you like it?” Shaa took off
his cap, polished a dust speck off the
insignia on the sleeve of his jacket, and
replaced it, with perhaps the barest in-
clination toward a rakish tilt. “Just a
slightly different way of viewing truth.”
“Are you sure you should be doing
this?” said Tildy. “Your heart ...”
It was time to nip this in the bud.
That was what Roni was supposed to
be there for, but she had turned away,
ignoring them; he would have to do it

all himself.
“Are we married?” Shaa
asked.
“What are you talking about?
Of
course we’re not -”
“Are we betrothed? Do we have a re-
lationship other than that of two peo-
ple who happen to be on the same boat
at the same time?”
“Why are you -”
“Look,” said Shaa. “You’re a nice girl,
a very nice girl. I like you - you’re a
nice girl. I don’t want to be rude, but if
that’s the way you take it, then my con-
science will just have to determine an
appropriate way for me to do penance.
Nevertheless, there it is.”
“There what is?”
“My business, my choices, my free-
dom of action, however limited, on the
one side, and your solicitous-bordering-
on-meddlesome attitude on the other.
By which I mean to say, if you need

to hear it another way, thank you for
your interest but please leave me alone.
Hmm?”
“All I was doing was -”
“I know what you were doing,” Shaa
told her. “Do you?”
“But what if things get out of con-
trol? It could kill you, couldn’t it?”
“You are persistent, I’ll give you that,
but the last time I checked, persistence
was not one of the cardinal virtues. As
far as for dying, well, everyone dies
eventually.
Well, almost everyone,”
amended Shaa.
The mate gave him
an are-you-crazy-or-do-you-just-sound-
that-way look over his shoulder, the
space on his jaw where until very re-
cently a tidy beard had rooted showing
ﬁsh-belly pale against the weather-
beaten leather of the rest of his counte-
nance. “As you were,” Shaa said to him.
The mate shook his head and examined

the sky, but then shrugged himself and
turned back to his steerage.
“When you say you like me,” Tildy
said slowly, “just what do you mean by
that?
What do you mean I’m a ‘nice
girl’?”
She seemed to be lagging a sentence
or two behind him, Shaa noted. Yet an-
other case of bad timing. “Why are you
interested?”
“Well, there’s your curse ... I mean
my brother told me you, ah, well, you
said that it said you’d, ah, fall, ah, in
love while on some adventure, and,
well, I was, ah, wondering ...”
So, yes, it was as he’d suspected.
Shaa had known he would rue the day
he had identiﬁed Jurtan Mont as some-
one in need of his help.
Actually, he
recalled, he had known it immediately,
a knowledge that hadn’t let up on him
yet.
“Let me give you a piece of ad-

vice, for a change. Don’t get mixed up
with a curse. Don’t get mixed up with
anybody with a curse; don’t even think
about it. It’s bad for your health, and
it could be bad for their health.” Shaa
deliberately stared out ahead, at the
sailing vessel that was crossing their
bow, at the dock beyond it.
“Let’s do
this smartly, now, men,” he called to
the crew.
“Urr,” said the mate.
Tildy had grabbed his arm.
“Now
wait just a second, you! Why are you
always pushing people off, you with
your cute turns of phrase and your
changing the subject and your, your at-
titude?” Her comprehension had appar-
ently caught up with Shaa’s warning
of impending rudeness.
“What is it -
your curse, right? You’re just going to
blame everything on this curse?”
“To
be logically consistent,” said

Shaa.
“I should point out that you
were the one who was blaming my limi-
tations on my curse a moment ago, and
you were -”
“So what - you’re just going to let this
curse rule your life?”
Was the ship passing through a zone
of logical plasticity?
“If I recall cor-
rectly, I was arguing for free will in the
face of destiny’s control, manifested in
this case by the curse, and you were ar-
guing in favor of not pushing the issue.
Now you seem to be trying to reverse -”
“For once in your life, answer a ques-
tion, will you?”
Shaa had not been facing her; now
he turned to do so. Under the shadow-
ing hood, she had exactly the look of
determination he had expected. “Very
well,” he said.
“I recall doing some-
thing like this with your brother, so I
suppose it’s only fair.
What question

do you have in mind?”
Her teeth clenched even further; if
she kept this up, she was going to
make some dentist who liked crown
work very happy.
“Are you going to
let the curse rule your life?” she said,
squeezing each word through her lips
like a spurt of batter out of a tight
dough bag, and chopping off the end of
each syllable with the verbal equiva-
lent of a sharp cleaver.
“As a matter of fact, yes,” Shaa said.
“I am, at least up to a point.
That’s
what you do with curses, that’s what
they’re for.”
“What about happiness?”
“It’s difﬁcult to be happy when you’re
dead,” said Shaa. “I have this on solid
authority.”
“Then
why
are
you
deliberately
putting yourself in danger again?”
The dock was approaching quickly;

they’d have to wrap this up soon. “The
immediate danger should be minimal,
it shouldn’t involve much physical ex-
ertion, and in any case I never said I
don’t intend to keep on challenging the
curse envelope. At the moment I have
certain boundaries; there’s no getting
around that. Everyone has boundaries;
mine are more limited, that’s a down-
side, but I know where they are, which
is generally a plus.
Nothing doesn’t
keep me from being creative about
working with them and trying to push
them out. And I hope you’re satisﬁed
now, because that’s all you’re going to
get.”
The mate and coxswain between
them had been managing their advent
at the dock.
“Very neat,” Shaa told
them, “very clean, all very shipshape.”
“Urr,” the mate said again, followed
by a reluctant “aye.”

“So who do they think they are?”
Roni said. “There, on the dock?”
“Police, do you think?” said Shaa.
“Militia, perhaps, in those numbers.”
A troop of thirty men were drawn up
in ranks on the quay where they’d
been directed to moor by the harbor-
pilot’s vessel crisscrossing the river at
the head of the harbor.
At the head
of the troop was a loose group of ﬁve
more men - the troop’s commander was
clearly distinguishable through his pol-
ished breastplate, serious-looking olive
beret, and swagger stick, and a second
man wearing oilskin coveralls, thick
boots, and a professional manner was
conﬁrmed by the mate to be the dock-
master.
This man, his arms planted
impatiently on his hips, was looking
distrustfully at the third member of
the party, a purse-lipped sallow-faced
fellow with a plumed hat and a satin-

lined off-the-shoulder cloak,
and a
rolled-up document of some sort un-
der his arm.
Behind him on either
side were two fellows with the look of
personal guards, their swords loose in
their hands; one was large, but the
other was larger. “Avast, there,” Shaa
said absently.
On a barked command from the
coxswain, oars were raised and shipped,
the ship lost headway, the mate twirled
the wheel and the stern of the ship
swung smartly to starboard, and then
they were creeping to a dead halt not
three feet from the wharf. Lines were
tossed and secured and the gangplank
was lowered.
The crew stood back,
silent; they had their orders. On the
dock,
the ofﬁcial bearing the docu-
ment was in the midst of a hurried
consultation with the dockmaster, the
ofﬁcial jabbing his arm toward the

ship while the dockmaster alternately
shook his head and shrugged his shoul-
ders.
Then they appeared to resolve
something, or perhaps they didn’t, for
the ofﬁcial was stalking ofﬁciously up
the gangplank, followed immediately
by the two guards and after them by
the commander of troops, and trailed
at a distinct distance by a clearly dis-
pleased dockmaster.
Shaa drifted to-
ward the front of the quarterdeck and
observed their passage over the gun-
wale and back toward the bridge. The
ofﬁcial had a moment’s hesitation on
encountering the steep stairs, which
usually demanded a double handhold
on their railing if one was not to tumble
backward onto the deck at the slightest
swell, or even sideways, encountering
on one side the lower stair into the
cabin or on the other a barrel of pitch.
The man clearly did not intend to be

triﬂed with, though, least of all by a
staircase, so he jammed his document
more ﬁrmly between his chest and
shoulder and took hold of it with the
same hand, a feat mediated by a dra-
matically contorted elbow and forearm,
and continued his march up the steps,
his gait almost unbroken. He popped
off the top stair riser like a spring-
loaded toy, looked around, promptly
culled Shaa out from the group, no
doubt by his natty nautical outﬁt, as
the one in whom he was most imme-
diately interested, and ﬁxed him with
the pallor of his gaze.
“I applaud you,” Shaa said, touching
a ﬁnger to the brim of his cap.
“Cawp-whopt?” said the ofﬁcial, his
own words stumbling in his mouth as
they encountered his reaction to the
unexpected greeting. “What is this?”
“I didn’t believe the promise was se-

rious,” Shaa told him, in a conﬁdential
tone, draping an arm over his shoulder
and down his back, “but my pessimistic
anticipations have clearly been proven
wrong. My vote is secure for the next
election, I can assure you.”
“What are you talking about?” The
man’s voice was rising.
“It is so rare these days to redeem
from local government the trust one
has placed in it. We were promised a
civic campaign to maintain order on
the waterfront, though, and by the
gods that is surely what we have here
before us.”
The ofﬁcial ﬁnally squirmed free
from Shaa’s friendly grasp and reeled
back.
“Seize that man!” he ordered,
pointing
with
his
entire
arm
out-
stretched. The two guards, their faces
impassive, moved toward Shaa and
reached out to take hold of him from

either side.
“Ah,” said Shaa, “a personal demon-
stration of the ﬁrm-rootedness of your
measures - what a graphic example
of outreach to build solidarity among
the loyal constituents!
Nevertheless,
the exhibition most properly should be
made on yonder dock, since as your
companion the worthy dockmaster will
testify, the captain of a ship is invio-
late upon his own deck.
It would be
an unfortunate precedent to attempt
to set, I’m sure you’ll agree, as you are
so obviously a gentleman of some au-
thority and repute yourself, regardless
of the beneﬁts of the civic promotion or
other gains that may accrue through -
I beg your pardon!” Shaa glared at the
guard holding his left arm, and then
turned a matching glare on the guard
to his right. To his right, and up - the
man was at least a head taller than

Shaa, and the mass that had seemed
so well proportioned from the distance
of ship-to-dock was more reminiscent
of a small foothill when pushed up
against it at shorter range.
The dockmaster cleared his throat
reluctantly.
“We are part of the civi-
lized world, as you know, Lord, and
therefore the rule of law and practice
is a code we all bear witness to. It is
true that a captain on his own ship -”
“Thank you, sir,” said Shaa.
“You
see, this man speaks the matter right.
The breakdown of custom is a terrible
thing, a terrible thing indeed, leading
to abrogation of the law, rioting, agita-
tion; breakdown, in short, of all those
enlightenments that separate us from
the savage, from the life of the barbar-
ians.
Present company excluded, of
course,” he added, in an aside to the
guard on his right, whose hand had

wrapped itself easily around Shaa’s
entire upper arm.
“I -” said the guard in a deep throaty
rumble, but then he broke into a spasm
of coughing.
The sound of the cough
was even deeper than the voice, and
more forceful: Shaa felt himself rattled
as if by a close peal of thunder.
The
cough, though, was also damp, if not
out-and-out wet.
Shaa took another look at him. “Are
you well?” he asked solicitously. “In my
travels, I have been fortunate enough
to acquire a smattering of medical wis-
dom which I would be pleased to place
at your disposal.”
“Thank -”
“Stop that!” The ofﬁcial was now
waving the unrolled sheet of parch-
ment, revealing it to be indeed at least
as overwrought as he himself. He had
also, somewhat surprisingly, taken to

yelling, himself, to boot.
“This man could use with some at-
tention,” Shaa told him.
“It is less
than one would expect of a city such
as Oolsmouth, a great city the likes
of this, to fasten for its support and
succor on the inﬁrm, no matter their,
shall we say, undeniable stature. I feel
that -”
“Now you listen to me!” The ofﬁcial
snapped his parchment in the air. “I
am the duly constituted and jurisdic-
tional representative of the Municipal
Authority of Oolsmouth.
This docu-
ment impels and requires -”
“Did you say the ‘Municipal Author-
ity’ of Oolsmouth?” asked Shaa.
“I most certainly did,” the ofﬁcial
preened. “Do not interrupt –”
“Not the Authority of Ports and Tar-
iffs?”
“I said, do not interrupt me wh -”

“That’s interesting,” Shaa said loudly
but conversationally, again overriding
the ofﬁcial’s momentum.
“I was not
aware that the Municipal Authority
had any hint of magisterial preroga-
tive over affairs of the harbor and its
trafﬁc. Now, if you had identiﬁed your-
self as a direct functionary of the High
Commissioner of Rates and Tithes, say,
here on an excise matter or a question
of customs duty, or indeed a delegated
diplomat of the Oolsmouth Represen-
tative Council, your presence might
be more amenable to straightforward
understanding.
Under the situation,
though, I fail to see what signiﬁcance
your appearance here would present to
anyone of us, or indeed the reason for
your detaining us in own prosecution
of business. Accordingly -”
“Your ship and goods are hereby im-
pounded under peremptory decree!”

“No, no, no,” said Shaa. “You surely
have this all wrong. Orders of ﬁat are
clearly proscribed by the Waterborne
Edict of Pollison, at least without the
Seal of Imperial Cognizance to over-
ride the routine procedures.
Please
show your -”
“Here is my writ, here is my war-
rant,” snarled the ofﬁcial, again wav-
ing the document out of reach.
Shaa ostentatiously cocked an eye
in his attempt to follow the moving
sheet. “I see no seal here,” he stated.
Shaa had always been conﬁdent that
his time on the Roosing Oolvaya docks
as Waterfront Health Commissioner
would come in handy again someday,
not that he’d had the slightest idea
how this was to come about. It was all
becoming clear now, though. “This doc-
ument, whatever it might charitably
be called, plainly contains no Writ of

Judicial Attainder, either.
The value
of your attempt at preemption is thus
nil and moot.
Even if it was validly
executed, this ship is covered by the
Concordat of Water-borne Enterprise,
not by some extraordinary regional
declaration.
According to the River
Commerce Measure of ‘93, as promul-
gated by O’Rinn and Finebold during
the reign of -”
“All issues of river commerce are
overridden while in port by the juris-
diction of the local municipality!”
“But clear precedent, for example
that of Wisenfeller, Groth, and Knee-
mare in the case of Craven Shipping
Associates, states that a ship is not
considering to be ‘in port’ until it has
ofﬁcially docked at a designated moor-
age site and has registered with the
appropriate harbor authorities -”
“Established
Oolsmouth
practice

is that all vessels within the greater
Oolsmouth harbor zone are considered
to be ‘in port’,” the dockmaster inserted
mildly. “Furthermore – “
“I will concede that much temporar-
ily, for the sake of argument,” said
Shaa with a small bow toward the
dockmaster, “and in recognition of your
own stature and erudition, sir. Never-
theless, as captain of this ship -”
“You’re not the captain of this ship!”
the ofﬁcial shouted.
“Don’t be absurd. Certainly I am.”
“Is this ship not the Not Unrea-
sonable Proﬁt, registered to Haalsen
Traders and the property of Haalsen
Groot?”
“Not the last time I checked,” Shaa
said blandly.
“What name did you
see painted on the stern, at the area
with the various identiﬁcations and
symbols?”

The dockmaster,
standing behind
the ofﬁcial and out of his line of sight,
had been eyeing the mate. Each time
he did so, a grin appeared about to
break out on his face, and his mouth
contorted into a grimace as he tried
to keep himself from an involuntary
vocalization. Now he looked away from
the mate again and said, in a voice that
sounded as though someone was chok-
ing him gently about the throat. “The
name I saw was Perﬁdious Stranger.”
“Nor Unseasonable Proﬁt, did you
say?” Shaa responded.
“I believe we
did pass her upriver, now that you
mention it; they were putting about
and heading back to Roosing Oolvaya
by the looks of the situation. We hailed
them in case we could offer some as-
sistance, but her master, a stout fellow
by the cast of him, said all was well,
they’d only just discovered they’d for-

gotten something important back in
the last port.”
“No,” the ofﬁcial said, glaring at the
dockmaster, and then whipping about
to accuse Shaa again, “no! You’re all in
league together, that much is obvious. I
will hereby take possession of this ves-
sel and throw the lot of you in -”
“Fetch our papers,” Shaa told the
mate. The mate bent, opened a small
sea chest at his feet, and withdrew
an oilskin-wrapped parcel, which he
handed to Shaa.
“Capital!” said Shaa, busying him-
self
with
untangling
the
contents.
“First-rate crew, don’t you know, fully
prepared for every eventuality, any-
thing from a standard port call or a
mere routine inspection – ah, here we
have it. Them.” He held out a battered
logbook and a small seal-spattered
parchment.

The ofﬁcial grabbed the items out of
Shaa’s hands and gazed at the parch-
ment in disbelief. “Lies, more lies!” His
tone, though, was a bit less sure of it-
self. Was he starting to hedge, perhaps
even to doubt? “According to this scrap,
this ship is, is -”
“You see?” Shaa said, leaning over
to indicate one section with his ﬁnger.
“Perﬁdious Stranger, as this good man
stated.”
“Yes!” the ofﬁcial said.
“No!” He
stared at his own parchment in sud-
den distress. “The description is exact,
the cargo manifest complete, the -”
“What cargo manifest?” asked Shaa.
“How would anyone know what cargo
we’ve aboard?
Excepting myself, of
course.
We concluded our own con-
tracts upriver, a few particularly good
sessions of dealing if you must know,
and I don’t mind if you do, and what

with an extra spot of trading on the
dock no one could possibly predict the
contents of our hold. This is all very
irregular.”
Shaa suspected the ofﬁcial knew he
had overstepped in his eagerness. He
was, though, an obvious bureaucrat,
and was clearly not about to let a small
matter like an untrue fact put him at
a disadvantage.
The man swung on
the dockmaster. “You are here to assist
me in impounding this ship and its
passengers. Now issue your orders! Is
that clear?”
“May I see those?” said the dockmas-
ter, indicating Shaa’s documents. The
ofﬁcial thrust them at him. Chewing
idly on his lip, he looked closely at
the parchment of registration, then
thumbed through the smudged, splat-
tered, and sea-stained book. Shaa con-
tinued his pose of nonchalance, hoping

nevertheless that the man wouldn’t
decided to rub at the gold leaf of the
seals; the black ink he knew was dry,
and of course the signatures, but the
decoration-work had not had quite
enough time to fully set. However, it
was apparent that the dockmaster rec-
ognized the newly-demoted mate, or
thought he did, and found at least that
part of the matter seriously amusing,
and when that was coupled with his
obvious distaste for the ofﬁcial and the
whole nature of the proceedings, there
was a reasonable chance that even if
he found some irregularity he would
be inclined to overlook it.
“Seems quite in order to me,” the
dockmaster said ﬁnally, handing the
papers back to the mate.
“Further-
more, I am familiar with the ship you
are looking for, the Not Unreasonable
Proﬁt.
While there are overall corre-

spondences between that ship and this,
since they are of the same class laid
down in the same shipyard, with sim-
ilar if not identical measurements of
beam, freeboard, and so on, this ship
has been customized quite differently
in its upper works. We have these ex-
tra mid-deck structures, for example,
this awning over the quarterdeck, a
mainmast and a mizzen rather than
just the single-mast fore-and-aft gaff
rig.” He leaned forward over the quar-
terdeck rail and rapped on the mizzen-
mast, producing a solid thunk. Shaa
was glad he had insisted on verisimili-
tude in their utilization of the onboard
supplies for camouﬂage; accordingly,
Karlini’s image-work didn’t start I un-
til out of comfortable reach above the
deck. As a result, the base of the mast
was solid, but its continuation over-
head, as well as the furled sails and

the revised rigging, were all refractive
illusion. It had been a calculated risk,
to be sure, but with Roni’s lab packed
away and disguised as well it had
looked like a calculation well-balanced
in their favor, and since the ring wasn’t
on board either, any reception party
wouldn’t have been able to show them
up by detecting that. Perhaps this all
might work out yet.
The ofﬁcial nodded slowly, his lips
tighter than ever. “If that is how you
choose to declare yourself, so be it.”
Without turning, he raised one arm
and motioned the troop commander
forward with a wave of his ﬁngers.
“Lieutenant, deploy your men. Secure
this ship and place these two under
arrest. My men -” he nodded at the two
guards on either side of Shaa “-will
assist you.
Let no one else on or off
this vessel. Some violation of order is

underway here, and we will soon get to
the bottom of it. We will soon decide
who is in league with whom. We -”
“Are you quite ﬁnished?” Shaa said.
“For if you are, or even, let us be frank,
if you are not, I wish - no, I demand!
- to lodge a protest. I have been quite
patient with this nonsense, quite pa-
tient indeed, but you have now clearly
exceeded the bounds of civil procedure
and even, shall we say, the codes of law,
not to mention those of rationality and
good sense, but let that pass.
Is the
Oolsmouth Council of Representation
in session?”
“Yes, Captain,” said the dockmaster,
“it is.”
“The Council is in special session,”
the ofﬁcial snapped, “and the meeting
is closed, and in any case the Council
would never wish to be troubled with
the likes of you, whatever your -”

“To the contrary,” Shaa said. “I repre-
sent the executors of the trade base of
this great city, those who work respon-
sibly under the rule of law to build
the wealth and power of Oolsmouth
and to increase its stature among the
many municipalities;
in short, this
case stands for the ability of honest,
hard-working folk to purse valid em-
ployment and assist the growth of
capital.
That is exactly the business
of the Council, is it not, and the di-
rect interest of those who sit upon it?
I wish - no, again, there are no two
ways about it, I demand - to lodge my
protest formally and in person before
the Council, to lay this harassment at
their feet, and to submit to their wise
judgment for the resolution of this an-
noying matter.
Such an unfounded
interference in honest business must
be of central importance to them! Fur-

thermore, after this already signiﬁcant
waste of time, I demand to deal with
superiors, and with the superiors of su-
periors until (if necessary) the very top,
and to cease frittering with underlings
and ﬂunkies. Enough is enough!” He
folded his arms over his chest, drew
himself up, and tried to project a solid,
immovable demeanor.
The demeanor
was ﬁne; no problem there. His heart,
though, was pounding. He hoped there
was a breather in store soon.
“Very well,” the ofﬁcial said after a
moment; he too appeared to be breath-
ing hard, although probably not for
quite the same reasons.
“Fah!
Let
someone else deal with you and your
nonsense.
Lieutenant, you will still
secure this ship.
My men and I will
escort this troublemaker to the Hall of
the People.”
“Thank you,” said Shaa. “A ﬁrm ex-

ample of good sense and -”
“It might be appropriate for me to
join you,” said the dockmaster, “given
the circumstances.”
“I was just about to suggest that
very thing,” Shaa told him approvingly.
“Shall we go, then?” He offered his
arms to the guards.
The giant one
on his right grasped that side again,
with surprising grace for his obvious
barbarian ancestry. Shaa took another
quick glance up at him.
How closely
might Max’s description of his recent
caravan-mate, the northerner Svin, ﬁt
this fellow?
There were not all that
many barbarians roaming the south,
surely - there weren’t that many bar-
barians left anywhere these days. Per-
haps the chance of him showing up
here, in this particular situation, was
not as remote as it might objectively
seem.
Max had said he intended to

ask Groot to look out for the guy -
could Groot have actually found him?
Well, one way or another, between Kar-
lini and Shaa, himself, and with the
barbarian or not, perhaps they could
ﬁnally settle this nonsense Groot had
gotten himself mixed up in, and get
back to what they had set out to do
in the ﬁrst place. “Well, what are we
waiting for?” Shaa said to the ofﬁcial,
who had paused by the head of the
stairs for no obvious reason. Now that
he had set matters into motion at this
end, Shaa had to admit he was looking
forward to whatever Karlini had put
together somewhere up ahead.

Chapter15
THE HAND AND
ITS GRASP
THE
AFTERNOON
WAS
WEAR-
ING ON. The Hand did indeed have
the island surrounded, more or less.
It wasn’t a very large island, so the
ﬁve detachments of The Hand, each
its their own cobbled-together raft,
were among them able to maintain

full surveillance of the entire shore,
at least to the limits imposed by the
marsh grass, which marched straight
off the island into the water, still wav-
ing. The beached boat was clearly vis-
ible, though, as were the two grazing
horses, so The Hand had to know they
were in the right place. The right place
for what had not yet been established.
Jurtan Mont had become more closely
acquainted
with
waterlogged
earth
and its myriad tiny creatures than he
had ever intended. An egret had even
strolled past him once earlier in the
day, lifting its stick legs fastidiously
over his reclining chest.
From the
quiet that had descended on the area,
most of the other waterfowl had ﬂed
the scene, although an occasional honk
or the further-off call of a loon did help
to break the monotony.
According to the brief description

Jurtan had managed to pry out of
Max while he’d still been willing to
talk, The Hand was a free-lance merce-
nary troop. At the moment, they had
deployed forty operatives around the
various rafts. All three principals were
present as well, the triumvirate known
as the Vees.
“You are not being cooperative, Max-
imillian!” shouted the speaker. “If you
do not give yourself up, we will ﬁre the
island and shoot you down as you at-
tempt to emerge!”
Up above, Max was still consider-
ing how to proceed. He had the hatch
open, since they clearly couldn’t see
any part of it from the ground, and it
gave him an easy way to eavesdrop on
what was going on below.
From The
Hand’s lack of interest in the sky, Max
had apparently gotten rid of the ropes
and concealed his presence in the air

before they’d caught sight of anything.
It had been a close thing, though.
Occasionally,
Max had eased the
small mirror from his pack up through
the door to assess the lay of the situa-
tion. Gadol V’Nora, the one who’d been
talking, was in Max’s experience of The
Hand almost always the one who was
talking; he was The Hand’s negotiator
and interlocutor.
Max remembered
that curly black beard and overgrown
hair-mop well; from his present van-
tage point, however, he could see that
the area on the top of Gadol’s head
had begun to thin signiﬁcantly. In the
course of his remarks Gadol had been
gesturing freely with both arms. Max
was most interested in the easy mobil-
ity of the left. Either Gadol had gotten
better care than The Hand’s medic had
been in the habit of providing, or Max
had broken the arm more cleanly than

he’d thought at the time of their last
farewell.
Still, Gadol wasn’t actually holding
a weapon. Most of the other assorted
men-and-women-at-arms
spread
out
across the rafts had that covered for
him; they were hefting nocked bows
and had their swords at the ready.
The one who radiated the greatest air
of menace, though, was the man at
Gadol’s side. Max had asked him once
if he’d had his aura spell-doctored to
make him emanate so convincingly.
Romm had just grunted at him, which
from Romm passed for a substantial
conversation, before he’d punched Max
in the stomach again.
Romm V’Nisa
was master of troops and militance
expert.
Romm would have been responsi-
ble for The Hand’s careful deployment.
Max was always happy to make a tac-

tical problem of himself, and Romm
was certainly one to appreciate the dif-
ﬁculties. He would much rather have
moved his men directly onto the island
and combed the ground starting at the
shore and proceeding inwards, Max
ﬁgured, leaving a maneuver reserve
with their bows on the rafts at the rear.
However, he also ﬁgured that Romm
wasn’t about to underestimate Max’s
personal capability for close-quarters
combat again. Giving Max the chance
to close with even a half-dozen of his
men, especially in the muddle of the
tall grass, was not a break Romm
would be willing to give.
Hence the
threat to smoke him out.
Iskendarian’s hideout was being re-
markably unhelpful.
He had to have
equipped the place with the means to
detect and manage intrusions in his
neighborhood, but Max hadn’t been

able to turn up the slightest clue to
the scheme of control.
It was quite
probable that Iskendarian had left the
defenses on automatic, but if so, Max
had yet to discover what provocation
would set them off. Maybe Chas would
help him out.
On the other hand, maybe they’d
just give up eventually.
He’d faked
them out before: maybe they’d think
he’d done it again.
Of course, there
were the horses and the boat to con-
sider. Knowing The Hand, too, they’d
blast the island before they left just
to make sure they’d hadn’t been miss-
ing something. Now, though, the men
were getting ready with ﬁre arrows.
“Maximillian, this is your last chance!”
announced Gadol.
“Max?” he heard Jurtan Mont gasp.
“Keep your head down.” Max said.
“Don’t worry. I’m on it.”

“You leave us no choice! Fire!”
Arrows arched into the grass, trail-
ing ﬂame and soot. A chorus of hisses
arose as many of them plunged straight
into the mud and were immediately
doused. Others caught up in the few
small shrubs on the marginally higher
ground, two thocked into trees, and per-
haps half a dozen lodged themselves
in protruding tangles of grass. Small
wisps of smoke rose up here and there
around the island, and one of the grass
clumps started spouting low ﬂames
of its own.
Gadol turned to Romm,
who was watching the lack of spec-
tacle with arms folded and a sternly
disapproving expression.
Romm lis-
tened, shrugged once, and pointed at
the water. His message was clear, Max
thought. What did Gadol expect in the
middle of a swamp, anyway? Of course
everything would be waterlogged.

Max angled the mirror downward.
There was the kid, still hugging the
ground, clear of the arrows; the clos-
est one was almost ﬁve feet away.
A
clear miss.
As Max watched, Mont
rolled over and stared up accusingly
at him. When are you planning to do
something? the kid mouthed.
He thought Mont would rather not
learn he had been considering giving
himself up. That would give him the
best chance of ﬁnding our why The
Hand had suddenly taken an interest
in him again, and was willing to send
the whole team into a swamp, of all
places, to try to get the drop on him. If
The Hand was serious about this they
were sure to pop up again, though, so
Max would have other chances.
Of
course, Max tried his best to assume
the most steadfastly paranoid attitude
possible.
It was always safer to as-

sume someone was after you, and for
the worst of reasons, too, so it was a
shame to dilute such nefarious poten-
tial through the application of facts.
A romantic attitude, Max thought, if
a less than practical one. Well, if Gadol
didn’t go to Chas now, he’d try to think
of something . . .
ah.
Ah-hah!
One
raft clockwise of Gadol’s, a tall man
with the archaic tonsure of one of the
Kreelmon monkish sects was getting
up from his seat on a wooden chest,
stowing his pipe in a belt-pouch, shrug-
ging back the sleeves on his light robe,
and raising his arms.
Chas V’Halila,
the team sorcerer, was getting ready
for action.
Chas liked ﬂash. He also liked his
own personal comfort and safety, but
what he didn’t always like was ground-
work. In the old days he’d been a lit-
tle too slothful about checking for atmo-

spheric conditions and other potential
sources of problems; his spells were di-
rect and to the point. He’d always been
one to shoot ﬁrst and mop up any mess
later.
He was too far away and the angle
was too weird for Max to see what
Chas was launching,
but he could
guess. A puff of white smoke obscured
Chas’ hands as out of them appeared
a blurred globe of sun-yellow ﬁre.
It
soared toward the island,
breaking
into chunks, each dragging its own
bright afterimage trail, and then they
started to touch down in a ﬂurry of
whoosh and whoomp, getting ﬁres go-
ing for real this time. Max felt a swirl
of force around him in the sphere. It
was too quick to get any kind of ﬁx on;
as soon as he noticed it, it was already
focusing and collimating and vectoring
itself directly toward -

Chas lit up like a ﬁreworks display,
his aura ﬂuorescing a swamp-toad
green and sparks spraying off his out-
stretched arms, his skeleton burning
electric red behind the pasty shadow of
his ﬂesh.
His robe went up in soot.
Then Chas himself fell over back-
ward like a lock-jointed statue into
the murky water. A much larger cloud
of steam ﬁzzed up from the surface.
Same old Chas, thought Max. Throug
his own introductory examination of
the swamp, Max had gotten the hint
that Iskendarian hadn’t wanted any-
one running magic in the vicinity, the
hint that Chas had obviously missed.
What Max hadn’t been able to deter-
mine was the form the backlash would
take. Now that -
A small mountain kicked the outside
of the hideout sphere. Max separated
from his perch at the hatch, hit the

bookcase, and fell to the ﬂoor, a pile of
books cascading onto him and the slid-
ing divan aiming for his chest. Then
the room lashed back in the other di-
rection.
It wasn’t being kicked, no,
but with that amount of motion what
about the island?
Max grabbed the ladder as it swung
past, boosted himself up to the open
hatch, and leaned over the side. Below
him, water was rushing in from all
sides of the island, its leading edge dis-
appeared behind the billows of steam
and smoke boiling off the patches of
Chas’ ﬁre as they got drenched and
went out. The boat lifted off the shore
and ﬂoated toward the center. The two
horses were looking wildly around as
water foamed in their direction, then
over their hooves and forelegs. A tree
fell over into the wave. The island -
The island was sinking.

The rafts of The Hand were vanish-
ing into the fog. Below him, Max could
see Jurtan Mont, now on his feet but
reeling from side to side as the island
continued to shudder on its way down.
“Try to get the horses onto the boat!”
Max called to him.
Had he heard?
But there he was, lurching toward the
horses, his arms wide but his voice
soothing. And here came the boat.
Max dropped down the ladder to the
ﬂoor and looked for the rope. He’d gone
to the trouble to coil it up while he’d
waited, but where was - oh, there, un-
der the cushion from the couch, and
there next to it was the bulging oil-
cloth sack, too. He grabbed them both,
shook loose the end of the rope, and
tied it around the neck of the bag.
Pushing the sack ahead of him out
of the hatch, which was a lot more
difﬁcult than when he’d brought it

up empty, he ﬁnally popped back up
into the air. Around the invisible py-
lon once with the rope - pause for a
quick wobble from the island - then
again, with another turn, Max passed
the end with the sack twice around
his body and cinched it with a quick
slipknot in front.
Taking a ﬁrm one-
handed hold on the other end of the
rope where it emerged from its dou-
ble twist around the pylon, he boosted
himself up, swung both legs out of the
hatchway, snatched his amulet away
from the hatch with his free hand,
dropped the chain over his neck as the
hatch began to ease itself closed, and
let himself slide backward along the
drop-off curve of the sphere.
The sack dangled below his feet.
From the sack, the rope went around
Max’s waist, up to the pylon, and back
down to his now double-ﬁsted grip as

he rapidly paid it out. Fog and smoke
still covered the scene; the only evi-
dence of The Hand was a large shout-
ing from all directions.
Grass came
up with water beneath it, and then he
was down.
A strong tug on the rope
end around his waist sent the loose
bit whipping up into the air, around
itself, and then back down toward him
in free-fall.
Mont
had
somehow
gotten
both
horses up onto the barge. Everything
was wet and covered with mud, the kid
perhaps most of all.
The water had
stopping coming in, though, leaving a
table-sized patch of ground above it in
the center of the island. Max slogged
as fast as he could toward the barge
and ﬂopped on himself. “Good work,”
he told Mont. “Now hold on.”
“Hold on? But -”
Max had one of the poles in his

hands and was heaving at the earth
behind them. The barge had grounded
itself on the mud when he’d climbed
aboard; now, with a lurching slide, it
began to move free.
A bob, and they
were clearly out on the water. Behind
them, though, the edge of the water
was foaming, pulling away from the
small center of ground. Pulling? - no,
rushing, and the barge was starting
to lift, as the island surged powerfully
back to the surface, hurling the water
in front of it.
All of a sudden the barge was rid-
ing the white-capped crest of a wave.
Max had his legs planted wide, one in
front of the other, with the pole held
out over the bow of the barge. Ahead
through the mist and tall grass, the
confused shouts of The Hand grew
louder, although the creaking of the
island and the roar of water in mo-

tion were growing louder still.
Then,
off to the right as they broke through
the fog, in front and below, a quick
glimpse of standing ﬁghters with open
mouths and upturned faces, people
leaning away and reeling back, a cas-
cade of water, a jumble of waving arms
and tumbling heads. A wooden barrel
bounced through the air ahead of the
wave. The maze of trees and channels
that faced the lagoon was approaching.
“Sloppy to let them sneak up like
that; maybe I’m getting old,” Max said,
shaking his head, looking behind them
at the turbulent lagoon still ﬁlled with
splashing Hands. “Shaa would never
have let this happen. He’s a lot better
about these things than I am.”
“. . .
Shaa’s better at this than you
are?” Jurtan was hanging frantically
onto the horses, an arm around each
one’s neck. The horses, though, seemed

to be having a surprisingly good time
of it.
“He went to school, he’s had formal
training. I haven’t. I came up from the
streets. A damned urchin, that’s what
I was.”
“Then Shaa’s curse ...?” Jurtan gasped
“Yeah, Eden knew exactly where to
stick the knife for the best effect.” The
barge slid smoothly around a clump of
trees and into a channel, still surﬁng
along the rapidly dying wave. Max had
his pole ready and fended off from a
root-choked bank.
“Shaa might have
been in line to be Chancellor of the
Imperial Institute; that’s how good he
was. Don’t let him fool you.”
“So did you at least ﬁnd anything
while you were up in that place that’ll
help him?”
“I don’t know,” replied Max. “Maybe.
If I can get this stuff deciphered,

maybe.” He nudged the sack on the
deck with his foot. Paper crunched and
rustled inside; he’d been able to ﬁt in
most of Iskendarian’s manuscript ma-
terial while he’d been hanging around
in the sphere waiting for The Hand’s
move. “There’s a lot of stuff left back in
the ball that might be useful, but we’ll
have to write that off.
I don’t know
when I’ll be able to get back here.”
“You’re not planning to wait until
this settles down and go up again?” Ju-
rtan felt his footing was solid enough
to try letting go of the horses; the barge
was still jumping and shipping water
over the sides, but he could surely han-
dle little things like those, couldn’t
he?
“That wait would probably be long
enough to make us miss the Knitting;
this area’s gonna stay hot for awhile,
it looks like. Also, I don’t want to give

The Hand any more of a clue to the
place than they already might have,
which means I sure don’t want them
watching while I climb up again.
I’d
like to try to dump them, this time for
good, and that means getting out of
here while they’re still pulling them-
selves back together.”
“Those guys have been after you for
a long time, then, haven’t they? Why
didn’t you kill them?
You had the
chance.”
“Shaa doesn’t like it when people get
slaughtered.”
“He’s not here.”
Max shrugged.
“He rubs off.
He’s
either a good inﬂuence or a bad one,
depending on where your own stance
started. You could say I may have been
spending too much time around him.”
Mont managed to get the last horse
tie-down secured and took up the other

pole, by his intent expression appar-
ently planning his next rhetorical foray.
“You have any more detours in mind
you want to tell me about?”
Max gave him a sidelong glance.
“No.”
“Do you mean I should rephrase
that? Okay, do you have -”
“No!
As far as I’m concerned, the
next scheduled stop is Peridol.” Max
eyed the sack with Iskendarian’s manus
There would be help available in Peri-
dol, perhaps, if he was careful; untan-
gling Iskendarian’s code looked to be
a nontrivial task.
A nontrivial task,
but a worthwhile one. Max very much
wanted to know if he’d identiﬁed the
equations properly, and correctly intu-
ited their meaning. The thought that
Iskendarian had ﬁgured out how to de-
code the communications system of the
gods was worth the price of admission

all by itself, but that was by no means
the only topic of interest. It would very
tantalizing indeed if Iskendarian had
actually been the original creator of
the Spell of Namelessness.

Chapter16
THE HALL OF THE
PEOPLE
“AREN’T YOU READY YET?” the
Great Karlini hissed into the hole in
the ﬂoor.
“They’re coming.” He was
answered only by another dull clunk of
metal on metal, followed by the careful
tapping of a small hammer.
“I must go,” Julio told him from the

doorway; he’d been dancing from foot
to foot with totally unconcealed impa-
tience for the last ﬁve minutes, ever
since he’d darted upstairs for the ﬁnal
time to say that the Council Guard
had at last arrived to check Groot out
of his cell and escort him to the Council
chamber for the debate on his case.
“Go, then,” said Karlini, getting up
off the ﬂoor, “go. Oh, and good -”
“Gone is he,” Haddo said.
“Ridicu-
lous this is, think you not?” He had
pressed himself up against the side
wall in the tiny alcove, little more than
the size of a broom closet, really, to
keep his cloak from being snagged as
the secret door revolved again on its
circular base.
From the outside, the
entrance was no more than another
semicircular niche with another heroic
statue on another landing off the stair-
case that curved its way up the outside

of the Council room toward to the ob-
servation deck at the base of the Hall
of the People’s dome.
To operate it,
you actually had to perch yourself on
the statue’s back, contorting past its
extended marble elbows as it leaned
forward with both hands on the guard
of its sword, which was positioned
point-downward in the suggested ﬂank
of some gigantic and most likely al-
legorical beast.
After navigating the
elbow, it was necessary to wedge one-
self between the niche wall and the
statue’s ﬂowing cloak of battle, and to
activate a lever concealed up against
the base with one foot, whereupon the
springs of the mechanism would twirl
wall section, statue, and passenger
alike through a half revolution into
this dark little cabinet.
“Give me the light, will you?” said
Karlini. Haddo unhooded the lantern

and passed it over.
“Good for you is not present Roni,”
Haddo observed.
“Why is that?”
“Filth,” said Haddo succinctly. This
place had obviously not been visited in
years.
Dust had covered every possi-
ble surface, as well as the tube that led
down through the gap in the ﬂoor into
the bowels of the Hall. Of course, much
of that dust was now in the air, and
most of the rest was covering Karlini.
“Who cares about a little grime? Did
you ﬁnish rewinding the door mecha-
nism?”
“As told you I when last time you
asked, is still answer yes.” Once they’d
packed themselves into the room and
cast about with the lantern, the ﬁrst
feature they’d discovered was the wind-
lass crank on the ﬂoor just in front of
the revolving door element; its func-

tion had become clear when the door
had begun to slow signiﬁcantly and
make sproinging sounds after its third
trip around.
“What’s keeping him down there?”
Karlini mumbled, sliding the small
panel on the inner wall aside again
and applying his eye to the peephole.
Ahead of him and below, the circular
Council hall beneath the domed ro-
tunda was beginning to ﬁll. The buzz
of aisleway conversation was clearly
apparent.
“Without
Favored,”
Haddo
said,
“would be here none of us.”
“I had something to do with it, too, if
you’ll remember.”
“If had not known Favored Fabrica-
tor who this building built -”
“Yeah, all right, but if he doesn’t stop
that banging, he may have gotten us
here but we’re not going to be here real

long either before somebody ﬁnds us.”
Karlini closed the viewing panel and
ﬂopped down to the ﬂoor again.
“At
least hold down the noise, will you?” he
muttered into the vent.
The
voice
of
Favored-of-the-Gods
ﬂoated faintly out of the duct.
“Give
me a break, will you? I’ve never even
seen this stuff before, and it proba-
bly hasn’t moved in the last thousand
years anyway.
Where the hell’s that
motor oil?”
“If they hear you out there-”
“Shut up already - I told you I’m
working on it!”
“Quiet!” Haddo hissed at Karlini.
“To this listen!” Karlini held his breath.
From outside the hidden door, he could
clearly hear the tramp of feet trudging
up the stairs. Toward their position?
Toward them, yes, but then without
a hesitation past them as well.
The

steps faded out above, still tracking
around to the right. “Didn’t Julio say
no one ever came up here?” Karlini
said. “The only thing higher than us
in this place is supposed to be that
observation deck.”
Haddo seemed about to say some-
thing but was superseded as a clatter
of parts echoed up the tube, followed by
an incensed “Yeouch!” Karlini winced,
and not in sympathy either. “He’s not
ﬁnished and they’re starting out there,”
said Karlini. “They’re not just going to
think it’s rats.”
“Busy will be debate. Over talk noth-
ing will they hear.”
Karlini clasped his hands behind his
back and tried to pace, but one step
brought him face-to-face with the far-
ther wall. “We can’t just sit here doing
nothing,” he grumbled to it.
“Know you spell of soundprooﬁng?”

Haddo suggested.
Haalsen Groot had made his share
of dramatic entrances into this august
hall and ﬂamboyant gestures on its
ﬂoor, but for him this was a whole new
category. The members were not yet at
their seats along the curved benches
surrounding the central Pit of Debate,
but they had arranged themselves in
their habitual clumps in the aisles,
around the punch bowls and water
barrel, in the Pit itself, and along the
entranceway, and a few small clusters
were still hanging about in the corri-
dor outside, too, having yet to straggle
through the door themselves. The loi-
terers were thus the ones privileged to
catch the ﬁrst sight of Groot and his
escort, of whom there were a generous
ten: four before him and four after, and
one on either side holding the chains

to the closest arm and leg.
Between
their police sashes,
their tall caps,
their swords, and the four halberds
just surrounding him to front and rear,
the escort made its own statement
of power coercively applied and ofﬁ-
ciously maintained; this much Groot
had expected. The challenge that had
confronted him was which statement
would be best to make for himself.
He had been initially of two minds.
One approach,
certainly the main-
stream one and perhaps also the safest,
would have been to appear meek and
innocuous, neatly groomed and con-
servatively garbed, as one who could
present no threat to the smallest crea-
ture, let alone a great city such as
Oolsmouth; in short, to remind the
members of the Council before a word
was spoken that he was one of them,
torn unfairly and most heinously from

their midst. Julio’s politicking on his
behalf and that of the lawyer Snee,
though, had already made those points.
Further, Groot in his time had been
many things, but meek and innocuous
had not typically been among them.
Donning that particular mantle of mar-
tyrdom, then, might have seemed a
little too ingenuous of him. His fellow
Councillors were a tricky lot them-
selves, whether merchants, citizens’
representatives, or rufﬁans-at-large -
the last thing he wanted was to have
them think he was trying to hoodwink
them.
On the other hand, the other
principal approach,
while none the
less histrionic in its own right, held
out the attraction of the power of shock
appeal.
Accordingly, he had uncovered the
gash on his cheek for the occasion, and
had let more than a hint of the dried

blood remain smeared on his face as
well. His clothes were torn and grimy.
His hair showed that although he had
tried to comb it, the circumstances
had been unfavorable, and he had also
managed to miss certain areas of ﬁlth
when washing his hands and face. The
effect was hopefully that of someone
trying to make himself presentable
through adversity that was not his
fault, someone who has been dramat-
ically and unrightfully put upon.
He
had been pleased to discover that he
harmonized quite appropriately with
the picture cut by his escort. The group
of them, then, presented in one easily
captured image the quintessence of
man caught up by the wheels of rogue
authority.
Or at least that was the
idea.
Faces turned toward them, conversa-
tion stilled, jaws opened or lips pursed,

as the bunch of them marched through,
Groot clanking in his chains.
When
they came out of the anteroom into
the Council chamber itself and started
down the aisle, Groot saw that an area
had been set aside in the Pit next to
the central lectern of the presiding
Speaker, an area with an elevated
display box for him to stand in, sur-
rounded by enough space for his entire
troop of guards. After a quick consulta-
tion with the Doorkeeper, the comman-
der of the guard detachment led them
out into the Pit and installed each one
in their assigned place.
Actually, Groot’s escort had really
numbered eleven: the ten guards from
the police, and Eelmon, who had been
drifting along behind them dogging
their steps and generally keeping his
eye on things, not that there seemed to
be much he could do if anything went

sour but run for help. Julio, too, had
been waiting in the corridor as they’d
passed. He’d pulled Eelmon aside for a
brief consultation, after which Eelmon
had disappeared down a side turning
and Julio had followed Groot and the
guards into the Council chamber.
As the members left their eddies of
conversation and ﬁled into the benches,
Groot made a point of trying to ﬁx as
many of them as possible with his
gaze during the moments when they
glanced in his direction. Those Coun-
cillors Julio had tallied for him dur-
ing their last consultation session in
his cell all appeared to be present -
there was Darkan, of course, and Penn
Galtick, and Queeling the Procrasti-
nator, and even old Caloot, but where
was Dooglas? Snee the lawyer had his
head together with Julio’s, the two of
them punctuating their deliberation by

nods here and there in the direction of
certain Council members. Then Snee
nodded reassuringly to Julio himself
and made his way toward the Speaker,
who was mounting his pulpit.
They
exchanged their own few words before
Snee crossed over to sit at a small ta-
ble next to Groot’s compartment as the
Speaker called the session to order.
“It is always better to start with a
spiritual message,” the Speaker said,
after the vocal hum had subsided to
the level of a few scattered whispers,
“before we get down to the serious busi-
ness of ripping each other to shreds
over matters of principle.” That occa-
sioned a ripple of nervous laughter,
which the Speaker allowed to run its
course.
“Yumun Pondwater has been
nominated as the chaplain of the day.
Let us all give him our attention.”
The invocation was innocuous enough

with a brief parable saying allegori-
cally that things usually work out, at
least for someone, under the divine in-
spiration of the gods; Groot rated it as
neutral for his side. Then the Speaker
rose again.
Set into the base of the Speaker’s
cylindrical
lectern
for
its
occupant
to
stand
on
was
an
axle-mounted
foot-plate disk, which this particular
Speaker sometimes liked to use for
dramatic punctuation.
He employed
it now, letting himself revolve around
through a full circle to cast his gaze
across all the Councillors who sur-
rounded him. Then, with a click Groot
was close enough to hear, he engaged
the brake and came to a sudden stiff
halt. “We are convened today,” he said,
“on a matter of gravity.” They were off.
The Speaker himself ran through a
quick précis of the basic facts: Groot’s

arrest, the seizure of property, his
request for a hearing in Council; an
evenhanded presentation.
After this
preamble he moved directly to the is-
sue. “Who stands to accuse?”
The man who had visited Groot as
the representative of the Bank of the
New Dawn rose, looking somewhat ill-
at-ease. “This is not a matter of accu-
sation per se, your honor,” he said. “We
ﬁrmly protest against this proceeding
on -”
“Identify yourself,” said the Speaker.
“Mark Lizzard,” the man said reluc-
tantly, casting a look over his shoulder
toward the entrance door.
“Are you representing yourself, Meest
Lizzard?”
The burst of laughter brought a
slight cringe out of him. “The Bank of
the New Dawn,” he said. “As a ques-
tion purely of the conduct of business,

this -”
The Speaker rapped the Mallet of
Presidium sharply against the lectern
surface. “Thank you, sir. Will Meester
Groot speak for himself?”
Snee rose smoothly, dapper in his
outﬁt of sober responsibility. “Meester
Groot,
beset by privation,
has re-
quested my assistance. I am Sunworth
Snee, of the ﬁrm of Snee, Ruffson,
League, and Gatling. Meester Speaker,
we question the absence of Councillor
Dooglas from these proceedings, since
we will demonstrate how he was truly
the principal in this vicious and unpro-
voked attack against Meester Groot.”
“The Chair, too, questions the ab-
sence and activities of Councillor Doo-
glas, Meester Snee,” said the Speaker,
in a tone shading a surprising distance
toward the dire. “Nevertheless, we will
ask that all available facts and play-

ers be set before this assembly, and
perhaps Councillor Dooglas will grace
us with his presence before we have
concluded.”
Snee inclined his head toward the
Speaker, ﬂashed Groot a reassuring
nod, and sat, as the Speaker called on
Mark Lizzard to say his piece. It was
the same thing as Groot had already
heard from him during their earlier
meeting. Groot looked out across the
room, still looking for Dooglas, trying
to gauge the tenor of the crowd. The
chamber had a different feel from this
close to the center, both of the room
and of the debate. He gave up watch-
ing faces and followed the concentric
swirl of the parquet outward beneath
the benches toward the door.
The
metal ﬂoor of the chamber was almost
completely covered by the parquet,
which had been commissioned by the

Council of seven years before, and the
new rugs atop that concealed much of
the new wood as well. By the entrance,
though, the parquet sloped down to
match the level of the door sill and
ended there; the small gap between
the shiny old metal and the doorframe
itself was apparent enough if anyone
was interested to look for it. Nowhere
in the place, though, was there any
sign of Dooglas, neither on the ﬂoor
itself, nor in the doorway, nor in what
was visible of the antechamber.
Lizzard ﬁnished, and then Snee rose
to begin dismantling him.
Although
Groot had engaged Snee initially for
his reputation in the guidance and lit-
igation of the matters of business, he
was pleasantly surprised to ﬁnd him
rising to the demands of the present
occasion, displaying the full armamen-
tarium of the prototypical barrister:

the sly innuendo, the dramatic punc-
tuation, the delicate control of “spin,”
casting the available facts to provide
the best reﬂection on Groot while grace-
fully weaving through them the odd
supposition or outright conclusion he
wished for the audience to appreciate.
He had reached the story of Groot’s
visit from the would-be torturers and
their reluctant revelation of the war-
rant signed by Dooglas when a com-
motion began in the anteroom. A door
slammed, heavy footsteps were heard,
a gabble of voices rose.
Snee broke
off as the members craned their necks
to try to glimpse what was going on.
“Order in the cloakroom!” the Speaker
was shouting as he bashed away with
the Mallet.
“Order?” a voice ﬂoated back, cutting
through the hubbub with its maniac
edge. “Oh, yes, I’ll give you order.” A

quick high-pitched laugh that was al-
most a giggle followed the words, and
then following the laugh into the cham-
ber came a man; Dooglas. Behind him,
though, the disturbance in the entry
hall continued.
“Councillor,” said the Speaker, his
neatly pointed gray beard waggling
with accusation, “I charge you to re-
store the composure you have so wan-
tonly violated.”
“You are wanton in your own de-
mands, you old moppet,” shouted Doo-
glas. “First you want order, then com-
posure – well, which is it? Perhaps I’ll
give you order ﬁrst, and then the com-
posure will take care of itself, heh?” He
spun around, his ermine cloak ﬂapping
and swishing and his jewels clanking
and clattering;
he really was horri-
bly overdressed, Groot realized, and
he was actually wearing a powdered

wig. “You heard the Speaker,” he yelled
through the door.
“Quiet out there.
Order!”
Surprisingly, the commotion did die
down, with a last couple of thumps
and a metallic twang; a rather omi-
nous silence replaced it. “There,” said
Dooglas, striding down the aisle to the
front row. He struck a dramatic stance,
his feet planted strongly, one hand on
his hip and the other raised with a
ﬂourish, and swept his eyes around
the room. “Order is restored. Shall we
proceed with the show?” He dropped
into the seat the current occupants of
the bench had prudently opened up for
him, then concluded his entrance with
another surprising titter.
“The second childhood, is it, then?”
said a voice across the Pit from Doo-
glas; old Caloot, who, from the scraggly
white-maned creased-skin looks he’d

affected
throughout
living
memory,
most likely had more than a passing
personal familiarity with the subject
himself.
He got his own small scat-
tering of laughter but no more than
that. Dooglas, for all his new-found ec-
centric ﬂamboyance, had the members
spooked.
The Speaker employed his Mallet
again.
“Will someone step into the
cloakroom and bring out the Door-
keeper? Councillor Toomey, I see you
by the aisle, will you be so good ...
thank you.” Just as Toomey reached
the top of the aisle, the door to the
anteroom slammed shut in his face. A
voice spoke indistinctly behind it.
Toomey listened closely, then turned
to address the Council, displaying his
own look of puzzlement. “He says it’s
rather a mess, but he’ll have it cleaned
up in a moment. Not to worry, he says,

there’s the guard of honor out there
with him.”
“Captain,” the Speaker said in a low
voice to the head of Groot’s personal es-
cort, “would you mind having your men
assess the situation in the cloakroom?”
“My orders are clear,” said the man
indifferently, with perhaps the barest
glance toward Dooglas. “We are here
to guard this dangerous prisoner, and
guard him we shall.”
“Stop this vacillation!” called Doo-
glas. “Get on with it!”
The Speaker looked at Snee, who
shrugged,
then out at the Council.
“Very well. We will proceed for the mo-
ment. Meester Snee, please continue.”
Snee rose again, cleared his throat,
and raised the warrant of torture
signed by Dooglas.
“As the learned
Councillors will recall, we were dis-
cussing this most irregular document,

most irregular and thoroughly illegal,
violating as it does -”
“And in whose name is this worthy
document
executed?”
Dooglas
inter-
rupted loudly, springing to his feet.
“Councillor!” said the Speaker. “You
will have your chance in good time.
Meester Snee now has the ﬂoor.”
“The god Sapriel!
I just want you
all to remember that,” Dooglas added.
“The god Sapriel,” he repeated, this
time almost to himself, as he lowered
himself back to the bench.
“Meester Speaker?” said Snee.
He
approached the pulpit and the two of
them began to whisper together. The
Council had been growing increasingly
restive, and now a group of the back-
benchers got up, apparently after mu-
tual consultation, and headed toward
the door. The lead one pushed on it, but
it was still quite securely locked. He be-

gan pounding on the top panel with his
ﬁst.
Dooglas had roused himself again,
too, but he had sauntered out into the
Pit and was making his way over to
Groot’s box; in the general disorder,
no one paid him much heed.
Groot
noted that his guards certainly did not.
Dooglas leaned closer and told him, “I
swore I’d get even with you, and now I
have, at last.”
“You’ve done nothing of the sort,”
Groot said. “Everyone can see already
that you’ve overstepped the bounds of
propriety and good sense. You’re ram-
paging around like a rogue elephant.
First it was me, but now you’re mock-
ing the whole Council.”
“What Council?
I see no Council.
An artifact, perhaps, a rabble, a fos-
sil, a creature soon to be extinct.” He
laughed his high-pitched laugh. “Very

soon.”
“Why are you being so blatant about
all this nonsense?” said Groot.
“We
have laws in this city, in case you
haven’t given thought to them lately,
and more than that we all have to live
together in the same small patch of
land.
It would be much more conve-
nient if we could do it without turning
that land into a ﬁeld of battle.”
“We don’t all have to continue living,
my old friend.
Hah!
My old friend.
Field of battle indeed.
You’re right!
Enough of this.” He ﬁshed out a whis-
tle on a chain around his neck and
blew. Its tone was loud and shrill, but
not nearly as loud as the slap of the
suddenly ﬂung-open door or the shouts
of the Councillors gathered around it
as they were shoved and punched back.
One fell to the ﬂoor, clearly revealing
the band of fully armed soldiers crowd-

ing through the door into the room
behind him. A trooper paused to kick
him out of the way as they spread out
around the chamber.
“Councillor!” the Speaker was shout-
ing at Dooglas. “What is the meaning
of this?”
“Why, you asked for order and deco-
rum, did you not?” Dooglas said. “You
saw how difﬁcult a request that was, I
am merely providing the means to en-
sure your needs, once and for all.” His
mirth bubbled over again.
The red of the Speaker’s face was
beginning to contrast alarmingly with
his silver beard.
He raised the Mal-
let, hefted it, and then swung it with
remarkable alacrity toward Dooglas’
head. Suddenly a muscled arm was in
the way, grasping the Speaker by the
wrist with a grinding of bone.
“None of that,” said the sergeant of

Groot’s guard.
The Mallet fell to the
ﬂoor.
The sergeant gave a yank and
the Speaker came out of his pulpit
liked a leaping marlin. Then the sol-
dier opened his grip. The Speaker sank
down, his back against the lectern, his
hand cradled to his chest, his com-
plexion the reddish-purple of volcanic
sunset.
“Thank you,” Dooglas told the sergean
crisply. He bent and retrieved the Mal-
let, gazed at it fondly for a moment,
then roused himself and straightened.
“Order,” he said.
“Time for order.”
He opened the Speaker’s pulpit and
mounted within.
At
the
familiar
banging,
heads
turned toward the center; when they
saw who was present, conversation
froze. Into the silence, Dooglas said, in
a conversational voice, “Order.”
A few Councillors began shouting at

him. Dooglas bashed the podium again
with the Mallet and yelled back. “Look
around you!” As they did, and their
voices again trailed off, Dooglas added,
“Now sit down, all of you!”
“Yes,” he went on, after giving the
members a chance to sort themselves
out. “I control the forces you see about
you. Yes, subversion can still succeed,
even in this place and time. Yes, un-
helpful forces can still be locked in bar-
racks by one’s own private troops. Yes
-”
“The last time this happened was
about ‘aught-ﬁve,” said old Caloot in
his white-haired civic eminence, a bit
irritably.
“Or was it ‘aught-six?
It’s
all back there in the Council books,
one way or the other.
I hope you’ve
been taking good notes,” he snapped in
a sharp-tongued aside to the Council
secretary, still seated in his writing

position at the desk before the front
bench.
The secretary hurriedly held
up his transcription book, turning it
so the pages faced outward toward
Caloot, and indicated the furious runs
of new ink he been frantically scrib-
bling. Caloot gave him a curt nod and
told him, “Carry on.” He then returned
his gaze to Dooglas.
“These things
never work, you know, and they’re bad
for business, too. Don’t you boys ever
learn anything?”
“Silence him,” Dooglas said to the
sergeant, not taking his eyes off Caloot.
Caloot didn’t take his eyes off Doo-
glas, either.
Ferocious eyes they still
were, too, given additional ﬁre by the
maze of inﬂamed blood vessels and the
eagle-crag cant of his sunken eye sock-
ets. “Just try it, sonny,” he said.
Perhaps Dooglas shrank back a bit,
and perhaps he turned the barest

shade of green.
He cackled once,
though with a bit less glee than he’d
been exhibiting, then said, “Out of the
old sentiment and respect of a one-time
apprentice, this time I will -”
“Put a lid on it,” muttered Caloot.
“If you’d been an apprentice of mine,
I’d have drowned you in the discard
ale.” Caloot was the major Oolsmouth
brewer and distiller, and a leading
importer of foreign spirits as well.
“I will let you live,” Dooglas said de-
terminedly, as the sergeant returned to
his side, “to choke on your words as you
see me master of Oolsmouth.”
“A case of my Old Stout says he
doesn’t last the day,” said Caloot. “What
no takers? You’re all a lily-livered no-
account –”
“Do not push me too far,” stated Doo-
glas, “or you will leave me no choice.”
“What are you talking about?” the

Speaker mumbled from his position on
the ﬂoor.
Dooglas banged the Mallet. “Let us
proceed. Send in the inquisitors!”
One of the goons at the doorway
leaned through it and yelled, “Boss
wants the inquisitors!” Three ﬁgures
garbed all in black - three ﬁgures who
seemed quite familiar to Groot - im-
mediately ﬁled in;
they must have
been waiting on call only steps away.
A collective gasp rose up around the
chamber.
“Come to me!” Dooglas called to
them. “It is time to continue the hear-
ing. However,” he continued, turning
to Groot, “the rules have changed. In a
moment - what is it now?”
Loud conversation had again broken
out in the anteroom. “He’ll gab the gov-
ernment to its knees if he doesn’t get
his hearing, by the gods he will,” one

voice said in a particularly aggravated
squeal that cut through the rest of the
talk.
“An exaggeration to be sure,” said
another voice, “but when set upon and
misused, not to mention maltreated, by
the forces of misguided, misinformed,
or even, shall we say, mistaken ofﬁcial-
dom, what is an honest merchantman
to do but to seek clariﬁcation, at the
least, from -”
“What is going on out there?” Doo-
glas shouted across the room.
That was a question whose answer
Groot was eager to learn as well. He
had recognized the second voice, which
was well-nigh unmistakable. The three
torturers, now apparently promoted to
inquisitors, had paused halfway down
the aisle, and had turned with every-
one else to view the new spectacle at
the entranceway as a familiar man in a

nautical outﬁt plowed through into the
chamber like a manic rod-puppet, drag-
ging behind him two reluctant guards,
each with a tentative hold on one of
his arms, and behind them a gaggle of
at least half-a-dozen assorted ofﬁcials
of increasing rank, everyone of them
gesticulating vigorously and simulta-
neously babbling. Behind this rabble
came another fellow in oilskins and
dock boots, and an aloof but amused
expression.
“What is this?” said Dooglas. “Who
is this ragged sea-captain to disturb
the decorum of the Representative
Council?”
“I told him he couldn’t come in here,”
said one of the bureaucrats, “but he
wouldn’t accept -”
“So did I,” said another, and then
they all started yelling at each other
afresh; they had thus far been too busy,

it appeared, to have noticed the troops
standing guard around the chamber,
and the three inquisitors ahead of
them in the aisle.
The inquisitors
began padding toward them with a
menacing glide.
“Who is responsible for interfering
with my ship?” Shaa demanded loudly,
his captain’s jacket ﬂapping.
“Some
excuse for a commercial center this
Oolsmouth has become. You people of
the Council should be ashamed of your-
selves - obstructing an honest trader
just trying to do a good day’s work.
I am not unknown in the Maritime
Guild, no, not unknown at all, and I
will make the strong recommendation
-”
“Shut up!” said Dooglas. “We have no
time for this! Inquisitors, silence him.”
“Are you in charge here, sir?” said
Shaa, aiming an accusing ﬁnger down

the aisle at Dooglas. “Well, then, sir,
I would advise you that you have no
more important matter before you than
this. I will have you know that I rep-
resent the shippers Crumwald, Twist,
and Loop, and I can assure you that
they will not be pleased, not pleased in
the least, with the way you now choose
to do business in your jurisdiction.
Words will be said, I can promise you,
words indeed.
When all is said and
done - in fact, without exaggeration, I
will venture to state that by the time
not more than half has been said and
perhaps even less done - you will rue
well the day that - I beg your pardon?”
Two of the three inquisitors were
facing Shaa; the third had kneeled
on the ﬂoor to open his case of instru-
ments.
Shaa glared at each of them
in turn. “You heard Speaker Dooglas,”
the central one said. “Shut up. Please

hold his arms more securely,” he added
to the guards who had accompanied
Shaa into the chamber. “We are all pro-
fessionals here.” He raised his hand,
ﬂattened his palm, and moved it to-
ward Shaa.
Then the black-covered
arm seemed to shrink as a truly mas-
sive hand appeared from the side and
clasped it with an almost gentle ease.
The gentility might have been decep-
tive, though, since the man let out a
small shriek and fell to his knees next
to his assistant who was still fumbling
for their equipment.
“He will speak.” The gigantic ﬁn-
gers opened. Its arm was raised. Arm
and voice were attached to the same
body, that of the big barbarian guard,
the big barbarian one. The voice had
been big and deep, too, just the sort
of voice you’d expect from a barbarian,
in fact, and the ﬂoor under his feet

and the framed plaques on the wall
behind him hadn’t yet stopped rattling.
The barbarian raised his eyebrow and
looked around him.
The members of
the wharf delegation were looking at
him with their mouths open. Everyone
was looking at him with their mouths
open. Groot, from his perch in the Pit,
had a look of satisfaction on his face:
the look of a businessman who has just
appreciated that a transaction of his
was working out even better than he’d
anticipated.
Even Shaa had craned
his neck around and was eyeing the
barbarian with surprise.
Clearly the
barbarian had the ﬂoor.
“Where did he come from?” mum-
bled the original leader of the wharf
delegation, the duly constituted and ju-
risdictional representative of the Mu-
nicipal Authority of Oolsmouth who
had challenged Shaa on the deck of

the disguised ship. He and his delega-
tion had been waiting on the wharf for
the ship when the big guy had come
walking up, claiming to have been
sent by the Captain of Police as a re-
inforcement in case of trouble.
He’d
had some kind of token he’d claimed
was from the Council, too. Now that he
thought about it, though, the ofﬁcial
didn’t remember ever having seen the
barbarian around the city before.
Svin coughed; the catarrh had eased
enough for him to start getting back in
shape, but his throat still spent most
of its time being clogged. Still, it had
deepened
his
already
subterranean
voice and added to its resonance, so
that when he spoke it was like blowing
through a low-register organ pipe. He
thought perhaps he should remember
to get sick more often. “It has been a
lot of trouble to bring him here,” Svin

said, when he was sure he had every-
one’s attention. “He is very annoying.”
For good measure, he rested a hand on
the hilt of his axe. “He will speak.”
“Thank you, sir,” Shaa told Svin, in-
clining his head in a bow of acknowl-
edgment. “At least one man here has
the right of the matter. Now, Meester
Speaker - Dooglas, I believe this fellow
said your name was?
- now, Meester
Dooglas, then, I have -”
“Enough of this!” Dooglas shouted.
“An end to this, I say! Won’t any of you
subdue this man?” Some of his goons
grunted, some stood still as though
they hadn’t heard a thing, and one
or two out-and-out shook their heads;
some of them had had experience with
big barbarians before, and the others
had no desire to ﬁnd out if the stories
they’d heard about berserker ferocity
or the strength of ten or the bullhead-

edness not to know when you were
beaten were even half true. “Be that
way, then!” Dooglas told them.
He
tilted his head back and looked up at
the rotunda dome. “Gazoont! Are you
up there?”
A hand appeared over the edge of
the railing of the observation deck and
waved. “Here, master,” a voice echoed.
“Shall I rain ﬁre upon him?”
“Yes,” said Dooglas.
For the ﬁrst
time, some of the Council members
started to take cover, sinking down out
of sight beneath their benches. “Why
don’t you do that?”
A sudden sizzle and a swelling or-
ange glow came from the balcony. Svin
let go of Shaa’s arm and launched
himself down the aisle, one foot com-
ing down neatly onto the outstretched
hand of the head inquisitor where he
had placed it on the ﬂoor for leverage

in getting himself back up onto his feet.
The inquisitor wailed again and col-
lapsed, then hollered yet another time
as Shaa’s other guard, who had some-
how found himself propelled forward
using the leverage of his ﬁrm hold on
Shaa’s arm, only to be thrown cart-
wheeling over Shaa’s hip, fell full onto
the inquisitor’s back. Shaa dove out of
sight under the nearest bench. A pillar
of ﬂame reached from the observation
deck toward the aisle.
The gaggle of
bureaucrats scattered.
The end of the ﬂame-coil from the
balcony paused, lashed around like a
snake looking for the best target, then
looped around in midair and headed
down the aisle after Svin.
Svin had
reached the central pulpit. His knees
ﬂexed and sent him into a tremendous
leap up over the lip of the lectern,
across it,
then down into its inte-

rior, his weight jamming Dooglas up
against the side containing the entry
gate. The latch to the gate came free
with a rip of wood, the gate slammed
open, and Dooglas tumbled out of the
lectern to fall ﬂat on the ﬂoor next to
the Speaker.
Above,
a
slender
sparkling-blue
thread had appeared two-thirds of the
way up between the ﬂoor and the obser-
vation level, reeling itself apparently
out of the blank wall in the midst of the
wrap-around mural of civic forefathers
painted around the rotunda.
Whip-
like, it wrapped its tip around the
trunk of the ﬂame pillar and yanked
tight. The lower section of ﬂame, now
disconnected from its umbilical, roiled
angrily, expanded, and whooshed out
in a singeing cloud, embers raining
around the room.
“That’s it!” said a very faint voice

that rang with a metallic twang, seem-
ingly from just underfoot. “This time
I’ve got it!” Something coughed like a
freshly heated boiler and a shudder
ran through the circular metal ﬂoor.
“Don’t you think events are going
beyond the need for your presence?”
Groot said to the commander of his
own guard escort. Amazingly, the ten
members of the escort had remained at
their stations surrounding his box.
“I have orders,” began the sergeant.
The remains of the ﬂame coil over-
head had begun lashing like a serpent
now in its death throes, its head per-
manently severed. It grazed the wall
where the blue lasso had originated
and a ten-foot expanse of mural ex-
ploded out into the air.
Revealed be-
hind it was a jagged section of stone
and beams, and part of a small room.
A man was standing in the room, or

more precisely, he was reeling back
from the new open brink, or even more
precisely, he was being dragged back
by what appeared to be a waist-high
heap of rags.
In the Pit across from
Groot, Dooglas was getting a wobbly
leg under his body. Svin came out of
his battle crouch and sprang through
the ﬂopping lectern gate toward him.
Just at that moment, though, the ﬂoor
began to move.
The circular ﬂoor was, of course,
massive and ponderous, between its
own bulk and the combined magnitude
of Councillors and furniture.
Even
with its opening jerk, though, as it
lurched through a full hour’s position
on a half-day clock, if in a counter-
clockwise sense, causing Dooglas to
be yanked out of the way of the air-
borne Svin’s convulsive grab, the ﬂoor
was giving a clear signal that it was

not about to be triﬂed with, or to be
impeded in its course by any practi-
cal considerations of power and drag.
Dooglas lurched forward and grabbed
hold of the trailing edge of the pulpit’s
swinging door.
Behind him, Svin hit
the ﬂoor on a rug, which promptly slid
out from underneath his feet, and as
the rest of him tumbled toward the
ﬂoor he skidded into the railing that
fenced the Pit off from the front bench.
The railing burst and Svin’s hurtling
bulk went straight through it into the
bench itself.
The bench and its half-
dozen
members
predictably
ﬂipped
over backward.
Groot’s box groaned
against the ﬂoor and began to glide
outward toward the wall.
Amidst the great creaking and grind-
ing of the ﬂoor itself, and the smashing
of collapsing furniture and the holler-
ing of the chamber’s occupants, a large

bass chufﬁng noise in the middle of a
humming whine was making itself felt
from beneath the ﬂoor as well, centered
approximately
under
the
Speaker’s
lectern.
Perhaps not coincidentally,
the lectern (being at the center of the
room) was the point around which the
ﬂoor was revolving, now with clearly
increasing angular momentum. Groot
braced himself against the edge of
the judgment box; he probably should
have dropped to its ﬂoor for additional
protection, he thought, but he never
liked to miss an interesting specta-
cle. Dooglas had managed to lever his
upper body back into the lectern, his
legs trailing back onto the ﬂoor but
his feet scrabbling for purchase. One
shoe slipped against the slick surface
and lashed back, directly into the knee
of one of the troopers who had been
guarding Groot. The trooper and four

of his squad mates had ﬁnally broken
ranks and were making for the lectern
themselves. Now, as the one Dooglas
had kicked tumbled backward,
his
feet shooting out from under him and
his arms outspread for unforthcoming
purchase, it was plain that the lot of
them were going nowhere but down.
The man caromed into ﬁrst one, then
another of his colleagues like a rogue
set of ﬂailing tenpins, and the knot of
them began to roll and slide outward
toward the wall.
From the observation deck, Sy Gazoon
Groot’s former communication media-
tor, was leaning over the intact section
of the balcony rail, watching the spin-
ning ﬂoor as he chewed anxiously on
his cheek.
“Blast the ﬂoor?” he mut-
tered.
“No, too dangerous, might hit
Dooglas. Main force? How much could
I muster?
How much would I need?”

Getting the ﬂame pillar under control
before its lashings destroyed his entire
perch, instead of merely blasting away
three-quarters of the railing and a
jagged chunk of the adjoining ﬂoor, had
been trickier than he’d expected. It had
looked so straightforward in the book,
too. He’d always looked down his nose
at those brute sorcerers who wasted
their time with attack magic; after
all, any fool could throw around raw
power and burn things down, couldn’t
he? A communicator, though, needed
a more reﬁned talent, a delicate sense
of control. He would still beat them at
their own game, and with his own ﬂair.
“Inhibition ﬁeld, that’s the ticket. Shut
down the motivator spell, right.”
Over the racket from below and the
sound of his own voice, and through
his rapt train of thought, tightly fo-
cused as it was on the problem at hand,

Gazoont was paying not the slightest
attention to the balcony door behind
him.
There was certainly no need.
He had removed it from consideration
by sliding the latch and blocking it
from the inside with a chair.
Accord-
ingly, even if he had heard or noticed
the door as it began to ease open, he
might have dismissed the observation
as an attack of nerves, unless he had
realized that with the damage the ob-
servation level had already taken the
door jamb had been sprung and the
chair had been displaced. Then, too, it
might have occurred to him that any-
one who really wanted to get in might
not have hesitated to just smash the
door down. But, then, they still would
have been too late, since his inhibition
spell was almost ready to go. It would
soon shut down the sorcerous engine
powering that madcap ﬂoor, Dooglas’

henchmen would restore order, and he,
Sy Gazoont, would have saved the day.
What kind of reward would be most
appropriate?
“There!” he said. “On the way.” Even
the spell matrix was neatly crafted,
with its multi-faceted green surface
and all those glints and highlights;
as his course of study had stressed,
the aesthetics of spell work are as im-
portant as the function.
The matrix
dropped away from him, directly on
target for the center of the Speaker’s
pulpit, darted past Dooglas’ face where
he was just pulling himself erect once
again within the lectern, hit the ﬂoor
at his feet, and released. Any second
now ... any second.
Now?
The ﬂoor was still spinning, and
apparently even gaining speed.
Sy
frowned down at it.

“Not a bad spell,” said a man at his
shoulder. Sy Gazoont looked up wildly.
Next to him, peering over the railing
just as he had been doing, was a guy
totally covered with soot and plaster
dust. “Just the wrong one.”
“What are you talking about?” Sy
heard himself say.
He brought his hands up into his
casting position, trying to remember
the other offensive spell he’d learned.
“Not too bad a guess at that,” the
stranger said, “at least if you didn’t
have the prudence to actually check
out the details of the situation. How
could you know anti-magic wouldn’t
work?”
“Wouldn’t work?” said Sy, pausing
out of curiosity before ﬂinging the
spell that would destroy this upstart.
“Why?”
“Because the motivator isn’t magi-

cal, of course,” said the Great Karlini.
“It’s mechanical.” He looked past Sy
Gazoont’s shoulder. “Haddo?”
“Hah!” began Sy. Karlini took a step
toward him.
Always keep a working
distance, Sy had been taught, so he
also took a step back, and fell neatly
over the upended chair Haddo had
placed behind him.
“Amateur,” Haddo said. “With com-
munications stayed should have he.”
On the Council ﬂoor, perhaps the
only one who had noticed any part of
this exchange had been Dooglas. What-
ever Gazoont had been up to with his
green gem-thing, though, it had obvi-
ously not led anywhere useful. “Fah!”
he shouted. Enough of this. Balancing
himself precariously in the center of
the whirling pulpit, with a bracing arm
extended to the lip at his side, he dug
underneath his shirt, past the whistle,

and found the small rune-covered disk
on its heavy chain.
Dooglas pulled
the chain over his head and held the
disk up in his clenched ﬁst. “Sapriel!”
Dooglas called. “Hear me!”
Svin had shaken clear of the tangle
of troops and cascading benches. Most
everything movable, including pews,
desks, rugs, loose sections of parquet,
and, of course personages, had made
their way outward to the wall, either
sliding, tumbling, or hurtling, where
they had now piled up in a long mixed-
media heap.
The single door had
become clogged almost immediately
by the two bureaucrats and a back-
bencher who had reached it simulta-
neously, being followed immediately
after by the back bench itself; the re-
sulting agglomeration had eliminated
the doorway from useful consideration
as an exit.
Svin, however, had man-

aged to keep hold of his ax, and was
using it to make his way against the
centrifugal pull toward the center, like
a mountain climber working his way
against gravity up the ice. A straight
line of ragged gouges in the parquet
traced his path radially behind him.
Now, he jammed the ﬁngers of his left
hand into the space cleared by the
ax on its previous chop, clenched his
teeth, drew himself ahead, and then in
a smooth motion jerked the ax free of
the ﬂoor and swung it out in front with
a convulsive ﬂing. It bit securely. Only
two more rounds of this and he would
be at the lectern.
Shaa shook his trailing foot clear of
the policeman who had been hanging
onto it and pulled himself more se-
curely onto his perch. He had reached
the ledge that circled the chamber ten
feet above the ﬂoor and served as the

take-off stage for the ornamental pil-
lars of the rotunda by immediately
scurrying toward the wall when the
ﬂoor had started to turn, keeping a
careful eye out for newly arriving pas-
sengers and debris, and making his
way up the growing pile.
This was
scarcely the diversion he had hoped to
cause. If it worked, though, he would
be more than happy to claim credit
later. He rose and carefully inched his
way around to the left, then leaned
down and extended his hand. Haalsen
Groot had just arrived at the wall, rid-
ing his box of judgment like a saddled
battering ram. Out in the center of the
room, a volume of air above Dooglas’
head was starting to coagulate.
Groot ﬁnished clambering out of the
box onto the ledge. “Did you think this
was going to happen?” Shaa asked him,
nodding with his chin at the developing

manifestation.
“What? - oh! No, surely not. I cer-
tainly would have never thought this
Sapriel would take an active role even
if Dooglas was involved with him.”
“Hmm,” said Shaa.
“Well, unless
yon barbarian is able to wind this up
quickly, we look to be seeing an active
role, and then some.”
“Send me your power!” Dooglas was
saying.
“Back me in my moment of
need! Invest me with the aura of your
greatness!”
“A bit excessive on the rhetoric,”
Shaa
said
critically,
“wouldn’t
you
say?” A shaft of coiling vapor with a
distinctly orange tinge was reaching
down from the area of curdling air
toward Dooglas.
Dooglas’ head and
upraised arm began to scintillate.
Like the scraping of giant ﬁnger-
nails across slate, a large shuddering

screech appeared, setting teeth on edge
across the room.
The hum and chug
of the engine under the ﬂoor faltered.
The ﬂoor shuddered, rocked, hopped
up an inch and wobbled back down.
Oily black smoke sifted up through
the newest holes Svin had chopped; he
drew a deep breath and narrowed his
eyes, trying to see ahead through the
sudden fog. He got a hand on the sill of
the ﬂapping pulpit door. A deep voice
spoke in the midst of the crystalline
zone above Dooglas. “Go away!” it said.
“Lord,” Dooglas said perplexedly, his
head tilted back to stare upward, “I beg
your pardon -”
“I’m right in the middle of -” the
voice continued.
Then the voice was overtaken by a
large sound of sucking, and the swirl
of sparkling air began to collapse in-
ward like a deﬂating balloon.
Above

the ebbing slurp, a distant deep howl
was brieﬂy heard as the air rippled a
last time and became smooth.
“Sapriel!” shouted Dooglas.
“Sa-
priel? Where are -” Beneath his feet,
the ﬂoor heaved again, settled, visibly
canted over at a slight angle, a spray
of parquet and a jagged coil of torn
metal leapt into the air at the edge
of the Pit, and the ﬂoor ground to a
sudden halt.
Svin had just set him-
self into motion. With the centrifugal
resistance unexpectedly removed, he
hurtled forward like a boulder out of a
siege catapult through the open gate of
the pulpit and into the still-twinkling
Dooglas, the ﬂat of his ax chewing a
wide splintery track through the deco-
rative hardwood siding.
Dooglas and
Svin hit the opposite side and kept
going.
The sparkle that had covered
Dooglas’ upper body came loose like

a suddenly-molted skin; ﬁreﬂy motes
danced for a moment in the air before
winking out in small delicate puffs.
Svin brushed a pile of punched-out
wood off his arms and began to climb
off the ﬂattened Dooglas, who was look-
ing at nothing in particular with his
eyes crossed. The logjam at the door-
way heaved and fell free in a jumble of
waving arms and bench legs. Behind
it was Eelmon, and behind him was a
press of new police troops.
They be-
gan to push their way into the chamber,
the lead policeman shouting, “Traitors!
Lay down your arms!” Then he looked
around, saw the heaps of furniture and
persons piled up against the walls, and
the lack of remaining armed insurrec-
tionists, and his voice trailed off.
People began to separate themselves
from the wreckage, sorting out the
bruises and puncture wounds from the

occasional broken bone. Groot spotted
the Speaker being extricated headﬁrst
from a mound of rug, smiling weakly,
and then noted the ﬁgure of old Caloot
bounding across the ﬂoor toward the
recumbent Dooglas. Dooglas watched
Caloot come toward him with glazed
eyes and a loose-jawed drool.
Groot
eased himself off the ledge and across
the judgment box and went to join
them.
“You boys never do learn, do you?”
Caloot was saying, one hand on his hip
and the other on the hilt of his walking
cane, and his gaze turned downward.
“You thought you could move against
Groot here and not be taken down
for it, and maybe you could have, you
never know.
Oh, maybe the Council
would have given you a slap on the
wrist if you’d left it there, but with the
number of members you started off con-

trolling and the others who wouldn’t
have had enough guts to actually line
up against you if you hadn’t forced
them, you didn’t have anything serious
to fear. But you wanted it all, miscal-
culated and played your whole hand,
didn’t you, except you didn’t have as
much to build with as you thought, eh?
Well, at least you got headed off before
you caused to much harm, before it got
too far out of control.” He waggled his
ﬁnger. “Let this be a lesson.”
Caloot
turned
away
and
started
limping out, then paused once more
to look around him. “Why does every-
body always want to take over a city?
You take over a city, you’ve got to actu-
ally run the place.” He shook his head.
“Some folks are just plain crazy.”

Chapter17
THE HALL OF THE
GODS
“IS EVERYONE READY?” said Zhard
“Sure,” I said heartily. Jill, Soaf Pa-
sook, Zhardann, and I were once again
in the second-ﬂoor study of Zhardann’s
place, sitting around the unlit ﬁreplace
with our armchairs in a half-circle.
“Ordinarily,”
Zhardann
said,
ad-

dressing all of us, “I support the princi-
ple of separate arrivals. Certainly the
individual entrance reveals the least
detail concerning one’s afﬁliations and
confederations, allows the greatest am-
biguity about one’s intentions, gives
one maximum ﬂexibility for maneuver,
or those tastefully yet dramatically
timed shifts of direction, and so forth;
all worthy goals to be cultivated, we all
agree. Anything else is a bit ... jejune,
shall we say.
Nevertheless, the bold
stroke, the dramatic gesture, the small
slap at accepted propriety do have
their place. The sheer shock value of
an unexpectedly explicit statement can
make its own message unmistakable.”
Both Jill and Pasook looked impa-
tiently placid, as though they were
waiting for Zhardann to get past his
rationalization to whatever conclusion
he was leading us up to, but were will-

ing to give him the space he wanted.
Whenever Jill got restless, I’d noticed,
she usually broke in with an unex-
pectedly explicit remark of her own.
From the fact that she was keeping
her mouth shut here, I ﬁgured she
knew what Zhardann was aiming at
and had decided to go along with it.
For Zhardann’s part, too, I caught from
him the feeling of an orator warming
up, doing his knee-bends and short
sprints, and generally giving himself a
running start, as it were.
That was ﬁne with me, too. As far as
I was concerned, Zhardann could take
all the time he wanted. When he got
to the end of his spiel, we’d all have to
zap ourselves off to the tribunal of the
gods. That feat would give three out
of the four of us no problem at all, but
of course the three weren’t my immedi-
ate concern. The fourth, however, cer-

tainly was.
“It is no secret that those of us who
aspire to the higher levels of intrigue
must be ﬂexible,” Zhardann was say-
ing, in his most convincing and crowd-
pleasing voice. “I believe this is a case
where the direct application of these
maxims is appropriate. I will be spe-
ciﬁc. In this case, it may be important
to impress the gathering with our sol-
idarity and uniﬁed purpose right from
the outset. Accordingly, we will utilize -
that is, I propose a modiﬁed group ﬁeld
transfer. Are there any objections?” He
glanced around the circle.
He was obviously trying to put him-
self in a conciliatory frame of mind
instead of just going with his usual
high-handed peremptory style. If that
told me anything about what was com-
ing up, it was that he’d be trying to
sway others by force of persuasion

rather than telling them dictatorially
what to do.
That much I’d already
guessed, though. I nodded back at him
to indicate my own assent, telling him
through my offhand manner that the
trivial question of means didn’t matter
to me one way or the other. Inside, how-
ever, I was hoping that group transfer
meant Zhardann would be doing the
work and I’d just be pulled along for
the ride.
“I do say modiﬁed group transfer,”
Zhardann reminded us. “As I will be
the one called on to perform any major
work that arises during this synod, it is
appropriate not to dilute my strength
through extraneous extension. To that
end, I will provide the synchronization
carrier, but each of us will separately
power his own jump. If we are ready,
then, let us be off.” He raised his hand
and drew it down over his face, wag-

gling his ﬁngers rapidly.
I had barely enough time to say
“Ulp” beneath my breath before the
cloud appeared above Zhardann’s head.
As though spilling out of an invisible
box a hand’s-breadth above his hair,
a coil of ﬂuffy grayish white dropped
down like a python, coiled around it-
self at the level of Zhardann’s forehead,
and spun out into a plump disc. If it
was not the identical effect I’d seen him
use before, when Jill and I had come
upon him in this room shortly after
our arrival in Oolsmouth, it was surely
a close relation.
He’d been using it
then for communication, but his body
had apparently never moved from the
room.
Pasook and Jill were now wearing
their own hat-clouds, too, but I had
to squint to see them since for some
reason my vision had begun to fog

and someone had tossed a shade over
the lights in the room. No, I realized,
that wasn’t it at all! To my surprise,
I suddenly became aware that at the
top limit of my vision, a fourth cloud
was hovering above my own head.
I
brought my hand up in front of my face
as the others were doing and ﬂailed my
ﬁngers, as usual not having the slight-
est idea of what I was really trying to
accomplish.
No, that wasn’t right either - and
this time that comprehension brought
with it a long rolling chill that started
at my neck, tracked down my spine,
and then ﬂowed over into the pit of my
stomach.
It wasn’t just that my ﬁn-
gers were not moving randomly at all
but with purpose, although that was
the case, and it wasn’t that I felt no
more in control of events than at the
other times when magic had occurred

around me, although that was the case,
too. The disconcerting realization was
that it felt familiar. It felt as though I
might have actually done this before.
With all my experience of Gash and
his metabolic link, I’d never had a
sensation like this before.
Could the
throughput of the link have somehow
been increased to the point where I
was getting perceptions piped in from
Gash, too?
The cloud dropped down
over my eyes and the scene went gray,
then darker, almost to black.
I felt
the clammy whisper move lower on my
face like the breath of an anesthetic
gauze - my smell faded away, my taste,
even the caress of air upon my skin.
My head was turning - was it? - well,
it felt like it was turning, anyway, ori-
enting itself, as a tendril of soft sound
eased itself into my left ear, like a con-
versation heard across a stadium ﬁeld

in the fog.
A silvery construction of
thin unsupported wire swam vaguely
through the cloud around my head. I
lifted my other hand - the ﬁrst was still
making its gestures of power, although
I couldn’t see it in front of my face, and
the grayness had slid over it like a vel-
vet cloud - and tried to pinch the skin
on my chest.
Had I dematerialized?
But I could feel my chest there in the
right place; I’d grabbed hard enough to
hurt. Instead of pain, though, I’d felt
only a dull pull-and-twist.
This was sorcery on a fairly high
level of sophistication, I was sure, al-
though
Zhardann’s
synchronization
coordinator - the silver wire thing -
had two obvious extra loops as well as
a subtle glitch that on closer exami-
nation might turn out to be an actual
bug. He was guiding us to one of the
standard meeting-grounds, that much

was straightforward, and I could feel
the four of us deploying into a line - Jill
on the left, then Zhardann and Pasook,
with me holding the right ﬂank - as the
arrival zone he’d picked was coming up
fast.
The imminent-arrival warning
went out ahead, and then, and then ...
What had I been thinking about?
My mind lurched after that ﬂick-
ering sense of competence, the mo-
mentary
feeling
that
I
understood
something that was going on ...
but
whatever it had been, whether my own
imagination or something else, it was
gone.
I felt solidity beneath my feet.
The gray nothingness before my eyes
lightened and grew transparent, not
as if it was actually blowing away as a
normal fog might, but more like one of
those trick panes of glass that are dark
and opaque from one orientation yet
become clear when rotated a quarter-

turn.
I heard conversation and the
clink of crystal around me.
We had
arrived.
I was on the right end of my party,
with Soaf Pasook to my immediate
left. We were standing on the roughly
ﬂat-topped surface of what appeared
to be a cumulus cloud, ﬂuffy billows
rolling slowly around us and tower-
ing above us into the brilliant blue
sky. Perhaps two paces to my right the
edge of the cloud dropped off, reveal-
ing a small meadow of waving green
twenty seconds or so of free-fall below.
Steep walls of ice and snow-dusted rock
ringed the meadow on three sides. The
cliff-sides - for so they were - mounted
toward the altitude of our position, the
central peak in fact overtopping the
cloud by a gut-wrenching leap.
The
whole sight had me by the stomach,
to be frank, and the gaps that were

opening and closing here and there
in the surface of the cloud, showing
other aerial vistas of rock and glacier
through them far below, did not help
to relieve that one bit. Neither did the
other mountain ridge toward which
the cloud appeared to be drifting in a
straight line.
None of these features of landscape
appeared to faze the others in the least.
When I say “others,” I don’t mean only
Zhardann, Jill, and Pasook, either, al-
though they were certainly surveying
the scene with their own aloof calm,
Pasook saying by his folded arms and
Zhardann by his erect but easy pos-
ture and his quick politician’s grin that
scenic details meant no more to them
than the idle amusement of a clever
party trick. If that was the game, I’d
be damned if I wouldn’t play along. Af-
ter all I wasn’t afraid of heights, not

really, not in the least. But even if they
were out of their minds in this way,
as in the several others I’d already
suspected, they were clearly not alone.
The ballroom-sized expanse of cloud
was already occupied by thirty or so
other people - gods? - beings was prob-
ably the safest category to use until I
could get the situation clariﬁed. Gods,
yes, probably, but all the gods I’d met
so far were at least humanoid, if not
outright human, in aspect.
Here, al-
though humanoid body plans were still
in the clear majority, the range of di-
versity was striking, especially for a
guy like me fresh from a backwater
neck-of-the-woods kind of place like
Roosing Oolvaya. Ahead of me across
a slowly closing gap in the cloud base
was a group of three. One was human,
wearing a metal-foil cape full on both
shoulders, and one was a sparrow fully

as tall as the ﬁrst, but the third looked
to my untutored eye like a series of
intermeshing spheres rolling smoothly
and silently within each other. I pre-
sumed the thing was an attendee and
not some kind of accessory since hang-
ing in the air in front of it was a brandy
snifter that would occasionally tilt and
pour an amber-colored liquid into a
retractable spout in its front, and the
other two were matching it tot for tot.
And the sphere-bubbler wasn’t the odd-
est personage there, either - almost,
but not quite.
Another
striking
feature
of
the
crowd was how relaxed everyone was
acting.
I’d spent enough time myself
with the gang to be sure it was an
act, and that each being present was
certainly keeping the appropriate or-
gan peeled to watch their back and to
stay vigilant for a convenient opening

to use against someone else. An occa-
sional head had turned and not a few
eyes had twitched at the sight of our
arrival, with the four of us standing to-
gether shoulder-to-shoulder as a clear
faction, so Zhardann’s goal of making
an immediate line-in-the-sand state-
ment had apparently been met, but
aside from that no one seemed very
impressed with our presence one way
or the other. Or they were just playing
things thoroughly cool. I found myself
listening in on a conversation a short
distance away on my right, next to a
punchbowl perched on a graceful curl
of cloud.
“Have you heard from the Yaws
lately?” the ﬁrst one was saying.
“Zimrat and Ozzie?
No, I under-
stand they’ve dropped out of sight.”
This speaker appeared to be a male
ocelot standing on its hind legs and

wearing a toga.
Balanced in one
forepaw was a china plate covered with
miniature eggrolls, complete with a
small ﬁnger bowl ﬁlled with red sweet-
and-sour sauce.
A pair of speckled
orange-and-brown-frame
sunglasses
were pushed back on top of his head.
“Even when they were connected, they
never liked these little get-togethers,
you know.
Always had other things
they’d rather be doing.”
“Those look quite good,” said the
ocelot’s companion, a woman with a co-
bra wrapped turban-style around her
hair, the snake’s hypnotically waving
head positioned like a tiara in front of
her forehead.
“Do you think I might
have some?”
“With my compliments,” said the
ocelot. An identical plate appeared in
the woman’s hand. One eggroll ﬂipped
end-over-end and dipped itself in the

sauce, then ﬂoated up to her mouth,
where it crackled appetizingly.
She
took a hefty bite.
“I’m going to grab some of that nec-
tar before we start,” Soaf Pasook said
beside me, strolling forward toward
the open chasm in the cloud between
us and the sphere-guy, forward - and
out across it. Strolling placidly across
the open air. But if he could do it, could
I? And why would I possibly want to
try?
The issue of meandering over the
edge of cloud could wait until later. In
the meantime, I decided to mingle, too,
since it didn’t seem we’d be getting
started on business right away.
My
ﬁrst step forward, though, was odd
enough to make me pause there, one
foot planted in front of the other, coils
of cloud-stuff washing gently over my
boots. It wasn’t that I felt I was falling

through the vapor; no, the cloud sur-
face was quite ﬁrm enough, rather like
a thick carpet on top of a pile of rub-
ber. It was my leg that felt strange. I
had felt it operating as I took the step,
its muscles contracting and relaxing
and the lower portion swiveling at the
knee joint and the ankle stabilizing to
take up my shifted weight, but at the
same time, almost like a phantom rest-
ing behind the forthright sensations
of movement, it felt to me as though I
was still sitting in the armchair of the
second-ﬂoor study back at Zhardann’s
rented house on the Lane of Wealth.
Now that I concentrated, I could de-
tect a vague pressure in the seat of my
pants and up my back and along the
undersides of my forearms; exactly the
sensations I’d have had if I was really
was propped in a chair rather than
standing and walking on a cloud, as

my eyes and ears and the foreground
messages of my muscles and skeleton
would have it. It was easy enough to
ignore the sensations that were more
vague, the ones that didn’t seem to ﬁt,
and something was tugging at me like
the hand on the business end of the
leash from a querulous dog, enticing
me to do just that.
Not that it was
unpleasant. Instead, I felt the peculiar
heightened texture of a dream, where
you may seem to yourself to be com-
pletely mobile even though your body
is giving off, at most, an occasional
twitch. This was no dream, though, or
at least not one of the standard default
sort, especially when you considered
the fact that I had already witnessed
what
this phenomenon looked like
from the other end to an outside ob-
server.
When Jill and I had come in on

him after our arrival at the house in
Oolsmouth, Zhardann had been seated
in one of the chairs, his body wrapped
in fog like a ruff-trimmed mummy. He
hadn’t been moving while we watched,
but when he emerged (or the cloud-
cocoon retracted) he’d had the air of
someone who’d just been engaged in
conversation, and had the new infor-
mation to match, too. What if he hadn’t
merely been conversing, though? What
if he’d been transported, in effect, to
meet the other party,
with all his
senses telling him he was present
there in the ﬂesh?
“What if,” noth-
ing - I had no doubt that was really
what was going on.
We were really
still lazing around back in Oolsmouth;
or our bodies were, anyway. We only
thought we were somewhere else.
But did that mean that this place
didn’t exist, either?
That this whole

cloudscape was really some kind of
simulation, a virtual but not physical
reality?
I didn’t immediately see how to test
that hypothesis. It seemed safer not to,
in any case, so I moved slowly forward
after Pasook, snagged a long-stemmed
glass ﬁlled with honey-colored liquid
from atop a conveniently circulating
service-tray cloud-puff, and tried to
project the image of a person who was
looking around for somebody he knew.
Apparently I did a convincing job. Off
to my right, someone broke away from
a group of four and waved in my direc-
tion. I bent my path toward him and he
moved forward to meet me, a normal-
looking guy with rakishly wavy blond
hair, a buccaneer’s mustache, a small
neat scar on his left cheek, and a dan-
gling earring in his left ear, dressed in
gilt-trimmed scarlet with a number of

tasteful jewels clinking here and there.
“It’s certainly been a while, hasn’t it?”
he said, studying me.
“Has it?” I said. “I suppose.”
“The last time was that thing out in -
well, you remember that place, the one
with all the ivy? With that fellow who
thought he was hero material and the
Steadman crypt, wasn’t it? Of course
you had the poor taste to be on the op-
posite side from me, poor fellow. I was
never quite sure what your interest
in the sarcophagus actually was.
Or
were you really after the idol? Surely
it couldn’t have been the hero?”
“You know how it is. No hard feel-
ings, I hope.” I took a sip from the
glass.
The stuff hit my palate like
ﬂambéed honey, but when I swallowed
nothing seemed to actually move down
my throat. “Didn’t you know? I’ve got
a collection.”

The guy twinkled an obnoxiously
clear blue eye at me.
“Touché.
You
must come sometime and see my own.
I have the manuscript copy of the Sec-
ond Iskendarian Codex, you know.”
“No,” I said, drawing the word out
with a dollop of incredulity. “You don’t
say. So that’s where the thing’s been
all these years. You wouldn’t consider
letting it out on loan, now, would you?”
“Put together a museum tour, you
mean?
That is an interesting idea.
Perhaps I should speak to the Impe-
rial Archivist. Most likely the logistics
would interfere, not to mention the
inadvisability of giving anyone else a
chance to read the words and have
their mind jellied.”
“The world’s a dangerous place.”
“So it is,” he said, “so it is.
And a
good thing, too, or the lot of us would
be out of our jobs as soon as the word

got out. A toast?”
“Why not?” I clinked glasses with
him. “To living dangerously?”
He seemed amused by that,
but
tossed his drink straight back. Wisps
of smoke coiled out of each ear. “Nice
touch, that,” I told him.
“Flamboyance,” he said ruefully. “It
gets in the blood. Speaking of which,
I’ve been hearing the oddest stories
about you and Pod Dall.”
“Have you?”
“Of course, I didn’t believe a word of
it.”
“Prudent of you, I’d say.
There’s
no predicting some people’s imagina-
tions.”
He threw back his head and gave a
hearty, surprisingly authentic-sounded
laugh. “Right you are,” he said, “right
you are.” The guy gave his eyes a wipe
with a monogrammed lace handker-

chief whose monogram, unfortunately,
was in a rune I didn’t know, then
stuffed it back into his sleeve before
I had enough time to memorize the
swirls so I could show them to someone
else or try to look them up in a book.
“Quite seriously, though, we should get
together sometime. Our interests may
be congruent.”
“You really think so?
Yours and
mine?”
The chuckle continued. “Oh, yes. Oh,
yes, indeed.” A stunningly beautiful
woman drifted over from the group my
new friend had just left. For that mat-
ter, it hadn’t escaped my notice that all
the human-looking folks around the
cloud were unnaturally striking, and
that even the odder characters radi-
ated a well-groomed glow of attraction.
Just before she reached us, the man
leaned closer and said, “I’ve been in

touch with a friend of yours, I believe.
A fellow named Max.”
“How
interesting,”
I
said,
more
faintly than I liked. “A friend of mine,
you say?”
I got the sly smile again. The woman
rested her side against him, draped an
arm over his shoulders, and tickled his
earring with her ﬁnger.
“Am I?” the
woman said to me.
“Oh,” he said, to both of us at the
same time. “Have you met?”
“Quite possibly,” I said. “If so, though,
the exact circumstances momentarily
escape my mind.
That is quite an
intriguing dress.”
The woman’s gown had been drifting
in and out of consciousness on an irreg-
ular schedule. Each time it reappeared,
it had changed color and style, but in
between, when it was off making up its
mind, it apparently forgot all about her.

“Does it run off the principle of Conser-
vation of Imagination?”
“I beg your pardon?” she said. “Phlinn
do you know that one?”
“I’m sure he spends much more time
on research than I do.
Come now,”
Phlinn urged, “you must elaborate.”
That’s what his mouth said, but his
arched eyes and the permanent half-
smile were clearly anticipating a punch
line.
“Well,” I expounded, “the theory is
that there is only a ﬁxed amount of
imagination around in any closed sys-
tem. If we consider you, my dear, and
your outﬁts as the system - you see?”
Of course, I’d never heard of the princi-
ple of Conservation of Imagination, I’d
only just made it up. With my recent
track record of having the fruits of my
own imagination reveal stories that
everyone around me was all too eager

to treat as the truth, though, it was
obviously a habit I’d be a lot better off
breaking. In this case, unfortunately,
as in the previous ones, I was stuck
having to reel it through. “While the
outﬁt is imagining its new incarnation,
there’s no slack left in such a closed
system.”
“No slack?”
“For leaving your own underlying
form to anyone else’s imagination,” I
ﬁnished helplessly.
The woman looked at me as though
I were out of my mind, if indeed I
had ever had one, as the dress reap-
peared around her pink nubileness,
this time in lavender with rufﬂes down
the front and out one shoulder, but
Phlinn clapped me on the back, laugh-
ing his rakish laugh and shaking his
head. I felt his hand on my skin with-
out thinking about it; the faint feel of

the armchair’s backrest was the next
thing to a memory. “I’m going to dig up
another drink,” he chuckled. “Anything
for you?”
The woman asked for a Hellraiser,
whatever that was. Phlinn raised his
eyebrows at that, but then twinkled
his eyes again and glinted his teeth,
too, for good measure, and ambled off.
“Phlinn Arol,” I muttered under my
breath.
The Adventurer’s God - who
else could it be? I’d been paying dona-
tions to him for years. But why would
he mention Max to me unless he knew
who I really -
“You like the dress, then?” said the
woman. It was now green and ankle-
length with a hoop skirt and bustle.
“Quite becoming,” I said.
“I’ve always enjoyed these gather-
ings,” she continued, taking a dainty
bite out of her goblet. I was sure it had

been glass before, but it now seemed
to have transmuted itself into a crisp
goblet-shaped cracker. “We have so few
opportunities to ﬂaunt our cleverness
in public.”
“It is a hard temptation to resist,” I
agreed.
“Yes, but why should you resist? I
mean, look at yourself - you’d think
you’d walked in out of the mud. You
could at least make an effort to make
yourself presentable.”
I wondered how many of those Hell-
raisers she’d already downed.
“Some
of us are the way we are,” I told her,
“on our better days, at least.” Her re-
mark was reassuring, though. If this
entire environment was synthesized, it
stood to reason that the appearances
people presented here were probably
artiﬁcial as well.
I’d been trying to
decide whether you had to go out of

your way to construct your semblance
for this place as if you were building
a wardrobe, say, or whether you got
one for free as part of the process;
I’d ﬁgured the former, but what she’d
said just now gave me more conﬁdence
I’d guessed right.
I hadn’t noticed a
mirror around, but now I could feel
more assured that the transfer hadn’t
made me look like a snaggle-toothed
orangutan to everyone else.
On the
other hand, that meant I looked like
me.
I couldn’t argue with her.
In a
crowd of beautiful people, I looked like
the guy who brought the supplies in
from the cart.
“There’s no doubt,” Phlinn said.
I
hadn’t realized he’d come back. There
he was, though, handing the woman
her drink. Arcs of ﬂame like miniature
skyrockets were rising out of the ﬁery
red ﬂuid and leaving a small smudge of

haze above the rim of the heavy high-
ball glass. “An admirable philosophy.”
The woman purred at him and snug-
gled up, her dress leaving for another
quick-change. It was quite boring, re-
ally.
“We were discussing how amus-
ing these little get-togethers can be,” I
said.
“Right you are!” Phlinn said, loudly
enough to make a few nearby heads
turn. “Not only these group meetings,
the whole damn communication sys-
tem. One of the best things Byron ever
came up with, after the whole genesis
thing itself, of course.”
“Baby!” the woman said, her purr
changing to growl. She looked ready to
slap him. “Why bring him up, and in a
place like this?”
“I’m getting drunk,” Phlinn said rea-
sonably.
“But whether I’m soused or
not, I’ll talk about anyone I choose.”

“Keep your voice down, then, will
you do that much?” She pulled back a
step, crossed her arms while carefully
balancing her drink, and glared.
“Of course, love, of course.” I had to
admire his control of his voice; now
he’d slid his tone smoothly into sheer
raw persuasiveness. Maybe he’d gone
to acting school, and maybe his voice
effects were augmented for this kind
of environment, too. “I’m probably the
last one around who’ll admit to being
a friend of Byron’s, you know,” he told
me, now using a just-you-and-me note
of conﬁdence-sharing.
“He was the
trickiest of us all, that Byron, but not
always the most prudent, it’s true.” He
took aim at me again with those eyes
of his. I had to admit, he sure did look
like a god. “It is true, you know.”
“What is?” I asked him.
“I was sure you knew.
Jardin cast

the curse himself, but by then Byron
had disappeared, of course, and he’d
changed his aural signature, too.
I
don’t know if the curse ever found him
or not, but he’s almost certainly dead
now any way you cut it. He hasn’t been
heard from in centuries.”
I’d heard the rest of what he’d said in
a vague sort of way, but my mind had
locked around the ﬁrst word, the ﬁrst
name. Jardin. Where had I heard that
name before? “Zhardann?” I said.
“Oh, is that how he’s pronouncing it
again?
He goes through phases, you
know, not that there’s much difference
between them. These old multilingual
names, always trying to decide how
they should be pronounced.
Always
some dispute about the consonants.
But you came in with him; you must
know better than I how he’s saying his
own name now. Do you think we’re up

for another of those curses today?”
“We’ll have to wait and see,” I said.
“We’ll all have to wait and see.”
“Hmm-um, yes. I suppose so.”
“Yes, we will,” said Soaf Pasook. He
was standing on my left. “Arol. I’m sur-
prised you’re here, feeling the way you
do.”
“If you know the way I feel,
it
shouldn’t be a surprise at all. I never
like to miss one.”
Pasook gave him one of those thin
grins that said many things, good hu-
mor not being among them; the kind of
expression these folks all seemed very
good at. Maybe they had a particular
exercise regimen that included helpful
facial muscle calisthenics. “So you’ve
given up your subversive ways? You’re
willing
to
join
shoulder-to-shoulder
with the rest of us in exercising our
power?”

“Absolutely,” said Phlinn Arol. “Es-
pecially when it’s aimed against one
of our own, for exceeding his fran-
chise and using mortals as his pawns.
Among others,” he added,
ﬂashing
Pasook a pleasant smile of his own.
“Aren’t you pleased to see us all here to
help you redress your own grievances?”
“Of course. Glad you could spare the
time. If you’ll excuse me?”
“Have
you
done
something
that
needs to be excused?” Phlinn said in
mock surprise.
“Hah,” Pasook said to Phlinn. Then,
to me,
“We’re almost ready to get
started,” he went on, resting his hand
on my arm and leading me away. He
stopped after a short distance, though,
just out of earshot.
“He’s quite the
radical these days, Phlinn is. I know
you’ve been away from things and
haven’t been keeping up, so I thought

perhaps I should tell you. A bit of good
will between us for you to remember,
and all that.”
“Really?” I said. My mind felt as ab-
struse as my remark.
“Perhaps it’s not totally his fault,”
Pasook said thoughtfully. “As the Ad-
venturer’s God, he has an outlook that
stresses the pitting of man against
the forces of man and nature, but not
against a totally stacked deck, which
is what a world under our thumb often
amounts to, to be frank; we all know
that. Conﬂicts with his damnable no-
tion of fair play, I suppose. Steadfast
ideals and all that.
Or perhaps it
comes from a misplaced sense of obli-
gation to his late friend Byron.” The
name came out in a glob of scorn.
I
thought he might spit on the cloud-top.
I hadn’t asked a direct question of
any substance in days. Maybe I could

get away with one here, with Pasook in
as abstracted a mood as he appeared
to be. Maybe he’d think I’d just been
drinking too much. “Byron?”
“Yes, damn him, him and his Abdica-
tionism. If he’d’ve been dealt with prop-
erly, no one would ever have heard of
the idea again. Just too damn inven-
tive, Byron was. At least it played a
useful role until he turned to politics.”
We weren’t really alone, but this
might be the best chance I’d get to talk
with him. “Look, Pasook -”
“May I have your attention, please.
Attention, please.” The voice was the
voice of Zhardann, or Jardin, but it
boomed along the cloud as though he
had acquired a giant speaking trum-
pet, squashing all other conversation
ﬂat beneath it. I looked around. The
cloud had slowed and beached itself
against the mountain peak I had ob-

served when the four of us had entered
the scene, and Zhardann was perched
ten feet up on a clean-swept crag. No
ampliﬁer of sounds was in sight.
He
had called the gathering, though, so
this was probably his chosen meeting-
ground as well; he must know the rules
here at least as completely as anyone.
Maybe he’d even designed and deco-
rated the place, although that seemed
a bit less likely to me.
If you could
create your own appearance for one of
these simulated environments, it stood
to reason that you could create your
own environment, too.
Whether any-
one else would be willing to set foot in
it was another matter. These gods were
a mutually suspicious lot, for good and
valid reasons, so I couldn’t see them
putting themselves into someone else’s
custom habitat without a very good
reason and a whole lot of preparation

behind them.
No, it stood to reason
that this place was a community neu-
tral ground.
They might not have
many rules, but I was willing to bet
that one of them concerned violations
of the public meeting-hall.
“Thank you all for coming,” Zhardann
continued, after the remaining conver-
sations had quickly died out.
“The
subject of this assembly is Sapriel. Is
he in attendance?”
Several seconds of silence passed.
No one answered.
“Sapriel has been
informed of this assembly and has
clearly elected not to be at hand. His
presence is not required at this stage.
However, I will now contact Sapriel
and ask again, in the sight of this
assembly. Sapriel! Sapriel! Sapriel!”
An area of air at Zhardann’s altitude
but out in front of him, over the front
of the beached cloud, spun together in

a ball, imparting a crystalline shine
and a refractive warp to the clear sky
behind it.
Then the color of the sky
in the ball darkened, becoming cobalt,
and the ball began to vibrate.
I be-
gan to hear echoes of Zhardann’s voice,
still saying “saprielsaprielsapriel,” the
sound growing and overlapping as the
ball’s shimmering increased, until all
the syllables and component phonemes
of the name were ringing together as a
clear pure tone.
Suddenly the ball was black. A deep
voice spoke from it, a deep voice with
an aggravated tone. “Go away,” it said.
“Don’t bother me. I’m busy.”
“Is the notiﬁcation witnessed?” asked
Zhardann.
“I witness,” said four or ﬁve voices
scattered around the cloud, stepping
on each other.
Zhardann raised his hand.
The

name-sound of the ball stopped and
the shimmering faded almost to noth-
ing, and the color of the ball lightened
to the violet-blue of approaching dusk,
but the ball itself remained hovering
in place. It was clear some ritualized
formula was being followed, at least
in outline.
I wondered how much of
this Max knew about. I was sure he’d
be interested; after all, he was curious
about everything having to do with the
gods. It was ironic, really, that I was
the one who’d been getting to know the
gods from the inside. Of course, it was
apparent that there was more than one
angle to “inside.” I was pretty sure my
current perspective would have helped
to round out Max’s, or if not I was be-
ing dragged through a lot of trouble for
nothing, but unfortunately there was
no immediate way to tell him about it.
For that matter, I’d gotten the im-

pression that Max had his own inside
sources; he knew too much already to
have been relying purely on guesswork.
Was one of his sources Phlinn Arol? I
glanced around me and spotted Arol
off to the right.
Not entirely to my
surprise, he was watching me. He held
my eye long enough to make the point
explicit. I gave him a small ambiguous
nod and turned back to Zhardann.
“Your
attendance
is
appreciated,”
Zhardann was saying.
“It should be
gratifying to us all to see the level of
concern such a group is demonstrating
for the well-being and reputation of
our community. Indeed -”
“Get to the point,” someone grum-
bled in an under-the-breath tone that
was clearly intended to carry.
“I
acknowledge
your
indulgence,”
said Zhardann, using a harder voice of
his own for a moment. “This is a seri-

ous matter; whatever our differences,
we will all agree on that. None among
us undertakes it lightly. Does anyone
here present question the legitimacy of
this forum?”
“Let us move forward,” Pasook mur-
mured.
I followed him toward the
front of the cloud, steering around the
clumps of listeners who were standing
or reclining on cloud-tufts along the
way. A fellow whose form showed not
human features or the details of cloth-
ing but rather a vista of ﬁelds, lush
with gently blowing prairie grass un-
der a pleasant sky, as though he was a
man-shaped lens punched through the
local reality to focus on another world,
had raised a question concerning the
appropriate makeup of a quorum, and
some brief discussion had ensued. To
me, it had the sound of an argument
that people had been over often enough

to get sick of, without anyone having
come up with anything new to add in a
long time.
“We are a club without by-laws,”
Pasook said to himself, or perhaps
he was really saying it to me.
“The
only mandatory requirement is self-
interest.”
The consensus, in line with someone
else’s quoted precedent, was that the
will to act provided the legitimacy. “We
will proceed,” stated Zhardann.
“To
present the circumstance, I call Soaf
Pasook.”
Pasook mounted the cliff-face.
Ac-
tually, he did as much ﬂoating as out-
right climbing. The snow at his feet re-
mained largely undisturbed, although
a few artistically placed footprints did
appear in his wake. Facing the crowd,
he unreeled roughly the same story I’d
heard before.
This time, though, he

was playing down the involvement of
the ring, leading away from it as much
as he could. He mentioned “this ring I
had” but didn’t even allude to the deal-
ings through which he had acquired
it or to his connection with me, and
certainly didn’t bring the name of Pod
Dall into the story at all. Instead, he
concentrated on his peaceful conduct of
business, his responsible and limited
revelation of himself to mortals, his
attention to the local standards of con-
duct, and his commitment to the status
quo, setting the stage for his sad tale
of how this had all been shot to pieces
by the unprovoked blunderbuss attack
of Sapriel.
It was a reasonable performance,
but I could tell that the crowd was
only suffering through the exposition
so they could get to the meat. I could
understand their impatience. After all,

stabbing each other in the back was
their preferred sport. What would they
care if one of their number pulled off a
good fast move against somebody else?
Pasook by his own admission had left
himself exposed by failing to line up
with a larger faction and the deterrent
value it could provide.
When he got
to the details of Sapriel’s use of the
banks, the way Sapriel had disrupted
the Oolsmouth business community
and the local politics, and especially
his interaction with Dooglas, the crowd
perked up.
Frankly, I didn’t think Sapriel had
been all that blatant about his activi-
ties, with the glaring exception of his
promises to Dooglas. I was willing to
grant Pasook additional knowledge I
didn’t have since he had been the one
directly involved, and I’d thrown in a
certain poetic license for hyperbole to

boot, and of course there was his story
of torture, which argued for an un-
mannerly lack of restraint on Sapriel’s
part. By Pasook’s earlier account to us,
Sapriel’s desire to get hold of the ring
was the reason for the torture. Further,
Pasook had told us he’d been about to
start shopping the ring around when
Sapriel had pounced. I didn’t think Pa-
sook’s story made quite as much sense
with the ring edited down to an inci-
dental role as it had done when he’d
told it to us. I’d made that point to the
three of them when we’d met before
coming here but I’d been out-voted.
Zhardann in particular had thought
that a full airing of the ring’s nature
might make folks lose sight of Sapriel
in the process since they’d realize that
the ring was really the more important
issue, and they might even start run-
ning out on the gathering to look for it.

I didn’t think he was wrong, but I was
concerned that his tribunal could get
equally out of control if someone else
brought the ring into the picture and
started asking the right questions. Of
course, if someone else did bring up the
ring, that might be useful information
in itself.
Zhardann would have been
even happier not to mention the ring’s
existence at all.
When Sapriel came
in, though, he’d probably refer to it
himself, and if the foundation had not
been properly set down the ensuing
discussion could drop our credibility
through the ﬂoor. All of this worrying
might actually have been moot.
By
the feel of the crowd, they were tak-
ing Pasook’s story more-or-less at face
value, or even if they weren’t, there
was enough in what he was saying
to make them think something worth
considering had been going on.

“Thank
you,
Soaf
Pasook,”
said
Zhardann, when Pasook had capped
off his explication by showing the on-
lookers his recent stigmata.
Pasook
left his shirt open while Zhardann con-
tinued.
“Yet this is not the story of
Soaf Pasook alone.
I have made my
own investigation, and I attest to the
truth of Soaf Pasook’s telling.” Not the
whole truth, I noted, but then I already
knew Zhardann was a tricky customer.
“Who else will attest?”
“I attest,” said Jill-tang. “I also have
investigated, and have met with this
Dooglas creature. He is clearly enrap-
tured. He believes that Sapriel will el-
evate him to our own level as his re-
ward.”
A hum of conversation rose; that
had hit them, all right, as had been
intended.
Zhardann had thought I
should attest, too. With my (or Gash’s)

reputation for subterfuge, though, who
would believe me? I couldn’t very well
swear by the gods, now, could I? To my
surprise, Jill had jumped in to make
those points even before I could get
my own mouth open. After kicking it
back and forth for a bit, Zhardann had
reluctantly acknowledged the problem
and backed down.
Of course, I could
have confounded them all and got up to
make a public statement anyway, but
I was trying to keep a tighter grip on
myself than I’d managed of late. The
middle of a ballroom full of gods was
not where I wanted to blow my luck
with an obvious ﬂub.
“I will want to hear from Sapriel
his version of these facts,” the ﬂoat-
ing:
sphere-creature said, somewhat
metallically, as the generalized reac-
tion began to quiet down.
“Yet I am
troubled. Is there one who will speak

for Sapriel?” The interlocking spheres
whirred as they tracked around, exam-
ining the audience, but when no one
piped up, it went on. “I am troubled.
We maintain a world of harmony, of
equilibrium, working our will with care
and prudence. One who is engaged in
business with those who inhabit the
world has certain responsibilities, for
continuity, respectability, predictabil-
ity. If we are thought of as arbitrary,
as ﬂighty, that climate for dealing will
worsen.”
“Yeah,” said a person-sized palm tree
whose roots were lost somewhere be-
low the surface of the cloud: its voice
was surprisingly conventional, if a bit
raspy, although it did seem to emanate
from the vicinity of its thick trunk.
“They get pushed too far, people may
get more inclined to ﬁgure out ways
of living their lives that don’t include

us.
They may not have power, but
they’re not dumb.
The last thing we
want is to start losing our power base
or, gods forbid, our legitimacy with the
ground-huggers.”
The palm’s use of that particular
imprecation brought a smattering of
chuckles from around the area, but it
was the sort of nervous snickering that
meant a nerve had been touched. “Why
should we fear them?” said a woman
I couldn’t spot.
“We rule, they serve.
They’d better just accept that.”
“I don’t know you,” the palm said,
idly bouncing a small coconut up and
down on the outstretched end of its
longest frond.
“Didn’t anybody ever
tell you about the social contract the-
ory? They stay within certain bounds if
they know what’s good for themselves,
but so do we.
Neither side escalates
without a lot of careful thought.”

“But power -”
“You haven’t heard about the threat
of power being greater than its exer-
cise, either, have you?” The palm rus-
tled its leaves disapprovingly. A differ-
ent coconut fell off its trunk and van-
ished into the cloud.
“Will somebody
please tutor this girl?
Does anybody
else question what we’re doing here?
That it’s important to keep any single
idiot from spoiling the happy hunting
grounds for everybody else? Sounds to
me like Sapriel has gone seriously out
of line.”
“Let’s not jump to conclusions yet,
shall we?” said the ocelot.
“I agree
that purely on the evidence we’ve al-
ready presented, of a bank raid that
has caused a political struggle and the
ﬂaunting or breakdown of the rule of
the law in Oolsmouth, an unwise activ-
ity is in process. I frown on those who

call too much attention to themselves,
especially while engaged in plotting
and scheming.
It goes without argu-
ment that much of our mystique em-
anates merely from being mysterious,
unknowable. The more mortals get to
see us in action, the more knowable we
become. It’s difﬁcult to be known and
not be tarnished to some degree, since
let’s face it, we often operate much like
excessively endowed people ourselves.
If the mortals really understood this,
the aura of godliness would melt and
people would think that the only thing
that differentiated them from gods was
their level of power.”
Listening to him, it occurred to me
that, in fact, this was the attitude I’d
gotten used to from Max et al. Exces-
sive familiarity with the ways of the
gods had bred in them, if not contempt,
at least a realism of appraisal.

There was more back-and-forthing
in this vein, and then they got onto
the subject of fraternization. It wasn’t
uncommon for gods to grant personal
favors to mortals or to interact with
them in one way or another.
There
was general agreement that adopting
a protégé or a human pawn, though,
should be done carefully.
A grouper
the size of a cow which had been cir-
culating without apparent concern in
the air, breathing freely without an
aquarium in sight, stated, as though it
was a maxim, that the wrong human
could drag the best god into the worst
mess.
Someone else agreed with the
ﬁsh, adding that along with the hauled
god, of course, came his or hers (or its)
commitments,
alliances,
and entan-
glements, and before you knew what
was happening there went the whole
neighborhood.

It wasn’t a one-way street, either:
not only could gods drag people into
their affairs, people could get gods
wrapped up in their messes as well. As
a god, if you weren’t careful who you
made promises or binding covenants
to, you might ﬁnd yourself embroiled
in an entirely different situation than
the one you thought was going on.
“Once in, it can be difﬁcult for even one
of us to pull out,” said an eight-foot
guy with a another couple of feet of
ﬂowing white hair on top and a few
of matching beard dangling down his
middle; he had an edge to his voice
that smacked of personal familiarity
with the problem.
“Even if you do manage to pull out,”
a woman said, “you do that at the risk
of losing your personal credibility or
your power, at the least.”
Obviously, being a god wasn’t the

straightforward enterprise I’d always
vaguely assumed.
I shouldn’t have
been surprised; after all, I did have a
personal (if limited) experience with
Gashanatantra, and there were the
shenanigans of the last few days to
boot.
That wasn’t the ﬁrst thought I’d had
of Gashanatantra lately, either.
I’d
been wondering if he was around. The
only one present who looked like Gash
was Zhardann, but that was old news
and in any case it meant nothing.
I
had to assume everyone I saw was in
disguise.
I thought I still might rec-
ognize Gash if I saw him, but on the
other hand how much did I know, re-
ally? The honest answer was “Not very
much.” With that in mind, there was
an equal chance that I’d been shaking
Gash’s hand and having hors d’oeuvres
with him without the slightest idea of

who he actually was. Unfortunately, he
surely didn’t have the same handicap.
With the number of games these
guys played, lethal and less so, they
clearly made an art of disguise and
misdirection.
Of course, that meant
there had to be an art to piercing dis-
guise, as well. If so -
“Is the view of this assembly, there-
fore, that Sapriel be summoned and
brought before us?” Zhardann said, us-
ing his position as chair to move things
along. “I declare that this is the assem-
bly’s will. I now call for volunteers to
assist in performing the summons as
an example of our united decree.”
He picked ﬁve, including the palm,
then raised his hands again. “Sapriel!”
he called, and as he repeated the name
the others joined him. “SAPRIEL! SA-
PRIEL!” The hanging ball sprang back
to life, vibrating, shuddering, shaking

beneath the combined ring of the inter-
woven sounds.
Again, the ball ﬁlled with ink. “Go
away!” said the same deep voice. “I’m
right in the middle of -”
“You are summoned!” Zhardann de-
clared. “Come to us now!” His ﬁngers
swam through another joint-popping
contortion, and the ball began to ex-
pand, like the inﬂation of a balloon.
Like a balloon, yes, but if so like one
being blown up underwater, against
some signiﬁcant resistance, against a
force that was simultaneously trying
to crush it.
The ball strained out-
ward, power ﬂowing into it from the
ﬁve volunteers through the modula-
tion of Zhardann, jerking ever larger
in a popping series of small wrenches,
as a deep-toned howl echoed out of
it into the air.
A spread-eagled hu-
man form took shape inside. The form

was full-sized, and the ball had grown
large enough to contain it.
Then the
form was no mere outline, but a dark-
bearded man.
Sapriel was thrashing like a freshly-
harpooned ﬁsh hauled abruptly onto a
trawler deck, his hands and feet ﬁxed
in stationary globs of what appeared
to be shimmering putty but his limbs
and body remaining free to lash back
and forth in utter futility. I presumed
that this was not the ﬂesh-and-blood
Sapriel, to speak a tad speculatively
about the physiology of a god, since
of course I didn’t know if they really
were ﬂesh and blood or something else
entirely. Rather, it had to be another
simulacrum such as the rest of us were
using in this artiﬁcial environment.
The difference between Sapriel and
the rest of us was the element of com-
pulsion, and the fact that Zhardann

had undoubtedly done something that
equally immobilized Sapriel’s physical
body wherever it happened to be. Just
watching Sapriel writhe made me feel
a bit giddy myself, as though someone
was dragging me around against my
will, too.
“This is a very bad time,” Sapriel
snarled. “I am right in the midst of a
delicate –”
“Your time is now not your own,” said
Zhardann. “You have been called to ac-
count!”
“To account? For what?”
“Step
forward,”
Zhardann
called,
“Soaf Pasook!”
Sapriel dropped his jaw, then closed
it with a small snap.
Pasook hadn’t
actually stepped anywhere, since he
was still standing on the cliff-side next
to Zhardann and a bit below him, but
he did raise his own arm to point at

Sapriel, and in any case Zhardann’s
histrionics were good theater.
“Hear
my charge, O Faithless One!” Pasook
began.
He rattled off a concise sum-
mary of the main points, then wrapped
up with a “What say you?”
“I don’t have to answer to you or any-
one else,” Sapriel growled.
“By the force of this assembly,” said
Zhardann, “you do.”
Sapriel looked down and around
him at the upturned faces as though
the presence of the crowd hadn’t en-
tirely registered before. “What is the
problem here?” he said. “I had every-
thing under control until you dragged
me away. Yes, I heard that Pasook had
this ring, and I hoped to acquire it for
myself. I used the means that seemed
necessary. Pasook persisted in resist-
ing, unwisely, so, yes. I brought him
to his knees.
He was at my mercy –

what’s wrong with that? Huh? I see a
dozen of you out there who have done
worse.
Have we all suddenly found
religion?”
He
looked
thoroughly
disgusted.
“What is the issue here, really? Even
when I leaned on him, Pasook never
had the grace to admit his defeat,
which was ignominious and total.” He
turned his scowl on Pasook. “You still
tried to ﬁnesse me, you toad - I thought
you were dead!”
“Yet another mistake,” Pasook told
him. “Your torture was extreme and ef-
fective, but again you overestimated.”
“The issue here is not one of deicide,
attempted or complete,” Zhardann said.
“Sapriel, you are correct in saying that
nothing prohibits you from eradicating
whom you choose, except the bounds of
good sense and the strength of your en-
emy’s connections; our code of conduct

is, if anything, informal.
That is not
the concern. The true matter is your
level of prudence, and your irresponsi-
ble and unrestrained conduct with the
mortal world.”
All of a sudden Sapriel looked scared,
he looked really scared. “Now wait a
second here. Are you running a hear-
ing or a lynch mob? What -”
Sapriel’s mouth was still working,
but the volume of sound coming through
abruptly dropped to a faint whisper.
“Despite your protestations,” Zhardann
continued, “your plots have not suc-
ceeded, so you cannot use the defense
of justiﬁcation of means by the desired
ends. It may be true that the winner
can make the rules; however, you are
not the winner.” Zhardann raised his
voice to address the whole crowd.
“I
submit the following for your consid-
eration.
If one of us cannot behave

responsibly with his power, if one can-
not restrain himself so as to avoid
endangering the common good, one is
not ﬁt for one’s position.
That is the
true thesis here.
“You have heard testimony.
You
have seen Sapriel’s response. You un-
derstand the serious nature of the
issue. Do you wish further discussion?
Or is a decision of consensus before us
now?”
Sapriel was still immobilized, with
the sound-deadening ﬁeld effectively
gagging him as well, but he was ﬂing-
ing himself fruitlessly around his cage
and clearly trying to yell at the top
of his lungs, his face turning red and
sweat running down it.
For a projec-
tion of his image it was remarkably
realistic.
Zhardann must have dead-
ened more than his voice, too - there
had to be some inhibitor overriding Sa-

priel’s power or he’d have been using
every last bit of it to escape. He could
sense as well as anyone the expectant
taste of blood in the air.
The pause lengthened, as each one
present eyed their neighbors and won-
dered who would be the one to speak
up and kick the thing over into action.
Finally, a burnoose-wrapped fellow I
hadn’t noticed before broke the silence.
“Mortalization,” he said.
“I call for
mortalization.”
The ﬁrst reaction was a stir that
moved like a sudden breeze across the
cloud, leaving behind it a murmur like
the rustling of leaves, and a turning to
and forth like the bending of branches
and trunks. The tone was approving.
The one who had spoken, though, had
wrapped himself again in his burnoose
and was holding himself aloof, with-
drawn. A thought tickled its way into

my mind. If the manifestations of the
folks who surrounded me were only
that, manifestations, artiﬁcial images,
why couldn’t a single person create
more than one of them at the same
time?
Could someone appear more
than once at the same time in the
same virtual environment? Could the
guy in the burnoose be a ringer?
I made a quick circle through the
confusion and approached the fellow
from the rear. “Pardon me,” I said.
Beyond him in the background, I
was able to view both Zhardann and
Soaf Pasook.
The man stirred as
though he was coming awake and
turned slowly toward me.
“Yes?” he
said.
“I don’t believe we’ve met.” I told him.
“I applaud your resolute statement.”
“Thank you,” he said, his voice drift-
ing away again.
“There is a time for

contemplation and a time for action.”
Zhardann had been casting his ea-
gle eye across the cloud, waiting for
the right moment to plunge back in.
At the same time, he was talking to
Jill, who had approached him from the
crowd and was standing below him
on the edge of the cliff.
Soaf Pasook
was ignoring the group in front of him
and spending his own moment in con-
templation, his face blank.
The man
in the burnoose pulled a length of its
cloth lower over his face and seemed to
go to sleep standing up. At the same
moment, Pasook gathered his own at-
tention again and said something to
the woman at his side. As he did so,
though, his gaze went out across the
congregation and happened to meet
my own. We spent a moment staring
at each other.
Then the voice of Zhardann rolled

over us again; I wondered if perhaps he
was using a concealed megaphone. “I
believe that the sense of this assembly
is to mete out upon Sapriel a penalty
both punitive and deterrent,” he said,
“and to remove by this means a danger-
ous presence from our midst. Is there
one who would challenge this?”
The silence had fallen again, the si-
lence of bated breath. No one spoke, no
one challenged.
I did notice that the
crowd seemed a bit smaller than before,
as though people had started to slip out
during the caucus.
“Is mortalization the decision of this
assembly?” said Zhardann.
Again, no one spoke aloud, but an
approving murmur rippled across the
cloud as the most everyone savored
the moment. Most everyone, of course,
with the prominent exception of Sa-
priel.

Zhardann paused once more for ef-
fect before proceeding.
“Very well.
I pronounce in the name of this as-
sembly as its judgment the decree of
mortalization upon Sapriel. I further
declare that this sentence will be exe-
cuted immediately.
Is there one who
would claim the responsibility of lead-
ing the inﬂiction?
Then I assert my
aspect, my ofﬁce, my power, l, Jardin,
Administrator of Curses,
Master of
Dooms! By my ofﬁce and my stature,
I declare that it is my right, my priv-
ilege, my obligation to dispose of this
matter speedily and forthwith.”
Now I remembered where I’d heard
the name Jardin before - Max had men-
tioned it when we’d been talking about
Shaa’s problems and the possibility of
confronting the Curse Administrator
directly.
And now it turned out I’d
been spending the last week hanging

out with him. The way the world works
can get to you sometimes. Maybe after
this was ﬁnished I could bring that up
with him, hah hah. Frankly, the way
the world worked would be one of the
last things on my mind. When we were
ﬁnished here my ﬁrst priority was go-
ing to be trying to deal with Zhardann
and Pasook, and the question of where
the ring was and what more did I know
that I hadn’t been telling them. I could
hear a sizzle as the hot water into
which I would shortly be dumped was
starting to boil.
One thing did make more sense, all
of a sudden.
Zhardann hadn’t hes-
itated to reveal himself as a solid
Conservationist, dedicated to the su-
periority of gods and the overall status
quo. That was exactly what you’d ex-
pect from the Curse Administrator,
whose power and position stemmed

materially from the structure that let
gods interfere most directly with the
activities of the world.
Zhardann
had
been
building
for
awhile, but now he’d reached his full
scenery-chewing form.
“To wander
the earth,” he declaimed, “the glories
of your past lost forever to you, even
the memory of your power gone from
you like dust, to be one with those
who creep across the ground, as one of
them to grow old, to grow feeble, and
to die - this is your fate, this is your
doom, this is your curse.
In my full
power and vested authority as Admin-
istrator of Curses, Master of Dooms,
I pronounce upon you now the dread
Curse of Namelessness!”
What?
I thought.
I’d ﬁgured Sa-
priel was going to meet his doom, but
I’d had no idea that the shape of that
doom was anything other than physi-

cal death. Max hadn’t said anything to
imply that the Spell of Namelessness
was used by the gods; he’d only talked
about it being turned on people.
It
was an extremely rare and tricky spell,
according to Max, which is why he’d
only heard and read about it, never
actually seen it in action or had the
chance to analyze its full speciﬁcations.
True, Max had implied that a lot of
the spells or spell mechanisms used
by mortals were also used by the gods;
when the gods used them these spells
often wound up more powerful, but
they weren’t necessarily different in
operation or even in name. But theory
wasn’t the biggest thing on my mind
just then.
The question looming in
from of me was major, central in fact,
and I hadn’t even seen it coming.
Was it possible that what had just
been done to Sapriel had, in fact, been

done to me too? Could I have misinter-
preted everything? Was I originally a
god?
Maybe Jill and Zhardann (or Jardin)
really weren’t mistaking me for some-
one else - maybe they really had known
me before the Spell of Namelessness.
Before I was mortalized. Maybe they
didn’t realize I was under that curse.
Maybe these trickles of knowledge and
expertise I’d been getting every now
and then weren’t leakage through the
metabolic link from Gashanatantra
after all - maybe they were leakage
from my old self making it through the
barrier the Spell of Namelessness had
thrown up, across the wasteland of my
sundered mind.
Get a grip on yourself, I thought
shakily; I was starting to sound as
ﬂorid as Zhardann.
Calm down.
All
this speculation could be nothing more

than wishful thinking, wishful that is
if you were the kind of person who’d
want to be a god in the ﬁrst place,
much less a god tossed out on his ear
by his peers. True, from a professional
standpoint the Spell of Namelessness
sounded more and more like a really
useful thing to have around.
Sorcer-
ers probably used it on their victims
when they wanted an effect from off
the usual beaten track, and a magi-
cian who knew it could undoubtedly
pick up a fair amount of cash by hir-
ing that skill out. For that matter, a
spell like that one was most likely part
of Jardin the Curse Administrator’s
normal repertoire. In fact, it sounded
like such a handy bit of spell-work that
it was a bit surprising you didn’t see
more of it around. On the other hand,
maybe you did. Look how long I’d been
walking around without any idea I had

no memory of my past, or my identity.
The inhibiting ﬁeld it cast on the peo-
ple around you, keeping them from
noticing your lack of name, too, could
almost be thought of as the spell’s way
of hiding its own identity.
On the other hand, you could under-
stand why maybe the Spell of Name-
lessness wasn’t used that much, after
all.
Why spend all this time and ef-
fort to put somebody on ice when you
might as well just kill them outright?
Special cases, sure - you might need
your victim around for later use, you
might want to have a good time watch-
ing your former enemy blunder around
with his memory gone, you might be us-
ing the Nameless one as bait to snare
someone else, you might merely lack
the power to eradicate your enemy out-
right, or you might even have some
weird moral compunction about mur-

der. Or, as in the current situation of
Sapriel, there could be some standard
of behavior, or the restraint of poli-
tics. But these were all special cases,
without a doubt.
None of the basic facts of my situa-
tion had changed, really, but the scope
of possibilities had just gotten wider. I
still had to assume that whoever had
hit me with the Spell remained out
there somewhere. They might not be
around, true, but that wouldn’t be the
smart way to bet.
If they weren’t, I
just wouldn’t ﬁnd them, that’s all, but
if they were and I didn’t, well, like I
said, that wouldn’t be the brightest
way to plan. Before the Sapriel devel-
opment, though, I’d ﬁgured I had to be
on the lookout for some human enemy
from my past, maybe some sorcerer I’d
crossed or a warlord who wanted me
out of the way and was willing to pay

top ool for the job. Now it looked like
I’d been thinking too small. Not only
might there be a god with a personal
vendetta against me indeed, possibly
one of these very gods I’d been hobnob-
bing with just now - but I myself might
have been one of them. From what I’d
seen of the gods so far, that didn’t seem
like anything to get excited about. Of
course, that attitude could have been
what might have gotten me in trouble
in the ﬁrst place ...
So this was just great.
Now I had
even more stuff to worry about. It just
goes to show you - this was the kind of
situation people thought I liked.
Zhardann had choked Sapriel off in
mid-wail while he set to work. Judging
by the pace he was following, he had
come prepared with a loaded Name-
lessness package, he wasn’t just whip-
ping the thing up from scratch now

as we watched.
The face of Sapriel’s
image was swimming, ﬂowing, melt-
ing, merging into a blank featureless
expanse, the nose ﬂattening and the
eye sockets ﬁlling.
Suddenly I real-
ized that behind that obvious scene,
Sapriel’s mind, too, was ﬂattening, los-
ing deﬁnition and resolution beneath
an empty fog.
Then I realized, too,
that Zhardann wasn’t just guiding the
Namelessness effect as it continued its
lumberjack swath through the forest
of Sapriel’s memory, he was watching,
monitoring, reading as the structure
evaporated away. I knew what he was
looking for, too. He wanted to know the
location of the ring.
Just watching Zhardann’s face I
could tell how it was going; that plus
my own intuition. He was discovering
that Sapriel really didn’t have the ring,
and in fact he never did have it.
I

didn’t know how much time Zhardann
needed, probably not much, but then
the hanging ball fell in on itself and
the ﬁgure that had been Sapriel, its
small spin growing into a whirl. There
was a marble-sized black spot in the
air, then only a puff of dark smoke.
Zhardann continued looking at the
place the ball had just vacated for a
moment, the look of puzzlement on his
face quickly turning hard.
I braced
myself for what was going to come
next, as soon as the meeting broke up,
and he had his chance to come after
Pasook and me again.
I could still
almost feel Zhardann’s mind ticking
over. Pasook had said that Sapriel had
taken the ring. Either he was lying, or
for some reason Sapriel’s memory had
been edited after the fact. That could
be possible, too - someone who had
stolen the ring from Sapriel could have

hidden his tracks by papering over
the appropriate memories in Sapriel’s
mind.
At least those were thoughts I as-
sumed were running past Zhardann’s
attention.
In all these tangled webs,
I had to remind myself that none of
these folks had ever had the ring in
the ﬁrst place, or at least hadn’t had
it since Max and I had acquired it in
Roosing Oolvaya.
The whole thing had only taken a
few seconds - Zhardann’s ﬁnal pro-
nouncement over Sapriel, his unleash-
ing of the Curse of Namelessness
and its prompt action in ripping Sa-
priel’s consciousness apart, followed by
Zhardann’s brief pause in thought. He
turned toward Soaf Pasook.
Soaf Pasook was gone.
Then so was my own view of the
scene.
The gray transport mist was

back, shrouding my body, deadening
my senses, blocking my vision. I had
been thinking it was time to go, but
had I actually managed to summon the
transport ﬁeld? I didn’t think I’d done
a thing. The metabolic link had shown
itself to be unpredictable, though, and
it was worth remembering that I still
didn’t know how the transport effect
had appeared the ﬁrst time, when we’d
arrived at the meeting, so -
The mist lifted. The cataleptic state
that I hadn’t realized was holding me
motionless withdrew. I was still sitting
in an armchair, the disguised sword
Monoch resting on the ﬂoor and lean-
ing up against my knee. The armchair
was in a sitting room. The sitting room,
though, was different.
I didn’t think the room was different
because someone had redecorated the
place while we’d been out. No, it was

a different room. It was smaller, and
lacked a ﬁreplace, and had a single
window on a single wall instead of the
two adjoining walls with their multi-
pane vista, and although there were
indeed artworks on the walls, the style
and subjects were entirely different.
The main item of furniture in the room
was a billiard table.
Jill and Zhardann were nowhere in
sight. Across from me, though, was a
single chair. Regarding me from it was
Soaf Pasook.
“That Sapriel,” Pasook
said. “A simple fellow, at heart.”
Pasook was different, too.
As I’d
known him over the recent hours, he’d
behaved as a supplicant, as someone
trying to make something better out of
an awkward position; as someone who
was being acted upon, rather than a
prime mover. In manner, he had worn
a coat of sheepishness. Now, peering

out beyond the sheep was something
else entirely.
The idea I’d thought was too loopy to
consider when I’d glanced on it earlier
had suddenly moved to center stage.
Pasook had a jeweled cup at his side.
He took a drink, smacked his lips, set
it aside. “May I see Monoch, please?”
he said.
“You’re not Pasook,” I said. “You’re
Gashanatantra.”

Chapter18
BACKWARD AND
FORWARD
“CAST OFF!” ORDERED THE CAP-
TAIN. Zalzyn Shaa, shorn of his own
nautical outﬁt, leaned back against
the stern gunwale, keeping his mouth
shut. The one-time captain, one-time
mate had reassumed his rightful role,
although his beard would no doubt

take longer to grizzle its way back out
to its accustomed station. The captain
eyed him now, shifting his attention
momentarily from the activities of the
crew, probably making sure that Shaa
was clear on who was again whom, and
what was what.
Shaa gave him an
approving nod and a small salute. The
captain grunted noncommittally and
looked away. “Raise sail,” he said.
“Raise sail, aye,” went the repeated
cry.
Shaa turned and looked across at the
retreating dock.
Haalsen Groot stood on the wharf
end with Julio, Julio waiting more im-
patiently than Groot. Well, Julio would
be the one stuck with most of the
legwork involved in getting Haalsen
Traders rolling again, after all; it was
no surprise that he would want to get
back at it as soon as he could. Then,

too, there was Groot’s new control-
ling interest in the recently disenfran-
chised Bank of the New Dawn.
The Great Karlini leaned himself on
the rail next to Shaa.
“When Groot
said he was sorry he couldn’t accom-
pany us,” Shaa said, “did you have the
feeling he was entirely sincere?”
Karlini didn’t bother to respond. He
had more than enough experience with
Shaa’s
straight-faced
statements
to
know which ones were designed for
rhetorical effect.
“What about that
iceberg, then?”
“Still a loose end as far as I’m con-
cerned.” Back on the dock, Julio’s ﬁd-
geting ﬁnally took its toll on Groot, and
the two of them turned and headed
away. “We had too many independent
actors running around hatching their
own schemes, as usual,” Shaa mused,
“but everything has somehow managed

to come together in the end, at least
as far as friend Groot and the greater
good of Oolsmouth are concerned. For-
mer Councillor Dooglas, currently lan-
guishing in a continued daze under
the watchful eye of Groot’s erstwhile
turnkey, Warder Clang, in the base-
ment of the Hall of the People, may
have a different point of view.” The
gods, too, having ﬂed the scene, most
likely had their own angle on things
as well, but they weren’t talking. Nei-
ther was the Creeping Sword.
From
the few vague hints he had let slip, he
might have been in a position to clarify
a good deal, since he had obviously
covered a lot of ground since they had
last encountered him back in Roosing
Oolvaya, but he had been spending his
time consumed with his own thoughts.
Without even turning to look, Shaa
could feel his presence behind them,

pacing distractedly on the main deck.
He hadn’t been out-and-out muttering
to himself, but he had clearly been ex-
amining scenes that were not those of
the ship and river before his eyes.
I couldn’t get it out of my mind. All
the developments of the past days had
come back at me, sure, all the ins
and outs and turns and twists, since
I hadn’t had the leisure to kick back
while it was happening to ﬁgure out
what was really going on, but the one
thing running especially through my
thoughts was that last bit.
“You’re
not Soaf Pasook,” I’d said.
“You’re
Gashanatantra.”
“In fact,” he’d said easily, “I am both,
in a manner of speaking.” He held out
his hand for the walking stick, and I
handed it to him. When I’d ﬁrst seen
him, as Pasook, in the study back at
Zhardann’s place, Monoch had started

to quiver like a puppy returned to the
guy who usually took him for a walk;
Monoch had recognized him even if I
hadn’t. Gash muttered the activation
word and the sword ﬂamed into life
in his hand. As he communed with it,
sweeping it through the air, he decided
to continue talking to me.
“The real
Soaf Pasook, I’m afraid, has reached
the end of his line. I thought Sapriel
was remarkably unconvincing when
he told that story about torturing poor
Pasook to death, surprisingly so in fact,
since it happened to be true. Of course,
Sapriel’s sad performance may have
had something to do with my presence;
I can be quite convincing in a role, I
don’t mind emphasizing. You haven’t
done uncreditably yourself.”
“Thanks a lot,” I said sarcastically,
although “Thanks for nothing” would
have been closer to the literal truth as

far as I was concerned.
“Don’t be so negative,” Gash said.
“This hasn’t been a waste of time
for you, I’m certain.
What you have
learned is more than adequate com-
pensation for my continuation of your
employment.
Nevertheless, I am in
a magnanimous mood. Sapriel was a
recurring thorn I am pleased to now
have out of my path, and without my
own personal implication in his depar-
ture. This pleases me. My pleasure is
your good fortune.”
“Oh, really?”
He ﬁxed me with the gaze of a dead
ﬁsh. “You are a loose end.”
Oh. A loose end. By rights, I was
something he should be tidying up. In-
stead, he was going to let me live, or
at least I hoped that was his implica-
tion. “In that case,” I told him, “thank
you very much.” I was hoping he wasn’t

going to remember the heavy backlash
I’d hit him with when I’d siphoned his
power through the metabolic link back
at the climax of the mess in Roosing
Oolvaya; if that did occur to him right
now his mood might abruptly change.
I didn’t want to tempt him into getting
aggravated at me but I didn’t want him
to start thinking about nasty stuff like
that either, so I ﬁgured I’d better try to
steer the conversation. I didn’t have to
hunt for a topic - the assembly we’d just
left was preying on my mind.
Some-
thing wasn’t right.
Something didn’t
ﬁt.
Then I had it. “Sapriel was lynched,”
I blurted out.
“Unless I’m missing
something big, he didn’t do enough
to justify being demolished like that.
When it came right down to it, nobody
even bothered to hear his defense.”
“Of course he was; of course it was a

sham. Haven’t you learned anything?
Pasook had isolated himself from sup-
port but so had Sapriel. Why else do
you think he’d have launched so shaky
a plot, and relied on human support,
of all things? He had nowhere else to
turn.” Gash ﬂashed his carnivore smile
again. “Perhaps he had help he didn’t
realize in reaching that state.”
“Perhaps he did,” I said. “You mean
to say everybody at that meeting had it
in for him? No, there’d have been some
of them who were there because they’d
gotten in position to scavenge some of
his holdings, right? And some of them
had to be there just for the kicks.”
“You see?” Gash said approvingly.
“You have been paying attention.”
“Do you mind if I ask you a ques-
tion?” I said.
“What about Jill?
She
thought she’d know you anywhere,
but she thought I was you and then

didn’t recognize you when you actually
showed up.”
“She doesn’t know me nearly as well
as she thinks she does,” Gash said.
“Zhardann, then, what about him?
You look different now than the last
time - I assume at the moment you
look like the real Soaf Pasook - but why
did you look before the way Zhardann
does now?”
The way he looked at me,
past
the ﬁery disk of the unleashed sword
Monoch, made me think my moment
of grace was just about at an end, if it
hadn’t expired already. “This interview
is over,” he said.
“Are we going to meet again?”
He continued to scowl at me.
“Oh,
very well,” he said, instead of what I’d
expected. “Verisimilitude.”
“I beg your pardon?” I said.
“Jardin does insurance,” Gash said.

“I don’t.
Insurance was one reason I
was in Roosing Oolvaya when we met
before, if you recall.”
“Uh, yeah, I do.
But I thought
Zhardann was the Curse Administra-
tor.”
“How much business do you think
someone can ﬁnd administering ma-
jor curses?
Insurance gives a much
more regular stream of income.” He
let Monoch slow in his twirlings and
stretched his left shoulder up, back,
around; I heard a squeaking sound
like stretching taffy. Gash lifted up his
tunic with his left hand and scratched
along the side of his ribs.
The fresh
scars, the stigmata of needles, the
ﬂayed skin were like a fading image
painted on a fresh canvas; as he eased
his hand along his side, the skin rip-
pled and smoothed behind it. He gave
a ﬁnal scratch, tugged his shirt back

down, and let Monoch begin to whine
again.
“What you said back at Zhardann’s
place - how if there were gods over
you the way your lot is over us, they’d
be pretty upset with you all - did you
mean that?”
“You of all people should know bet-
ter than to believe what one of us says,”
Gash told me severely.
“But if Zhardann could mortalize
Sapriel over a case of bad etiquette,
wouldn’t evidence of outright heresy -”
“After the things I said to them, mor-
talization would be the least of my con-
cerns,” Gash said, in the driest tones
I’d heard from him.
“Why did you do it, then, why did
you bother? I mean, no one knows it
was really you, of course, but it was a
little off the subject. Why even raise
the problem?”

“You’re the inquisitive fellow,” said
Gash.
“Aren’t you interested in poli-
tics?” He suddenly paused in his fancy
maneuvers with Monoch, and some-
thing else seemed to pass between
them. Then he swung the sword again
and let go.
As Monoch cartwheeled
up into the air and then came down
in a trajectory aimed directly toward
my face, Gash said, over the whine of
released power, “Here. Let him go with
you for now.”
I got my hand up, and instead of
following my natural instinct to cover
my eyes and fall to one side out of the
way, an instinct that I knew wouldn’t
have saved me since I’d seen the kind of
fancy footwork the sword could execute
when it was seriously going after some-
body, I opened my ﬁngers and grabbed.
The hilt of the sword smashed into
my palm.
I slapped my other hand

around it for good measure; even so,
the sword threw me to the ﬂoor, the
two of us knocking over the armchair
in the process. Monoch was loose and
excited and I knew that was a bad com-
bination, but I managed to snarl the
shutdown command as we began to
tangle ourselves up in the rug. When
the sword’s whine faded and I pulled
the rug off my head, I discovered that
Gash was gone.
There was one more obvious thing
I could have asked him, if I’d had the
chance, but it was just as well I didn’t
bother; I ﬁgured I knew the answer
clearly enough and I wanted to keep
being alive to appreciate it. Somebody
had ﬂoated the rumor that had set Sa-
priel on the warpath, the rumor that
Pasook had the ring in the ﬁrst place.
I hadn’t been sure who’d been in the
position to do that, who had both the

knowledge and the inclination,
but
now I ﬁgured there was little doubt
it had been Gashanatantra himself.
Gash had fed me the same story too,
through the metabolic link, and I’d had
enough exposure to the way he worked
now to be pretty sure why. A lot of it
had actually been true.
Gash and Pasook had indeed teamed
up to go after Pod Dall and turn him
into a ring. Pasook had double-crossed
Gash, perhaps using the late Oskin
Yahlei as his pawn, which is where I
had come in originally.
Gash wasn’t
the kind of guy to let a double-cross go
unavenged, though, and he’d seen the
chance to take down two enemies with
the same plot - Pasook and Sapriel -
using me again as his own pawn and
surrogate.
Gash still didn’t have the
ring, though. If he’d been keeping close
enough tabs on me, he had to know

where it was. He could be biding his
time before taking it back.
He could
have decided, too, that it was in a safe
enough place for the moment, and that
it was succeeding perfectly well in stir-
ring up nastiness without even having
to be present. On the other hand, I was
sure he’d been out of commission for a
while after I’d hit him with the back-
lash zap, so maybe the ring’s transfer
and current location had escaped his
scrutiny. If that was true, why hadn’t
he asked me about it?
You could say that if the ﬁrst shoe
was the stuff he’d pushed me into in
Roosing Oolvaya, the other shoe had
already dropped with the mess I’d just
gone through. I didn’t know how big
Gash’s closet was, though, or even how
many scheming feet he had.
Things
had now gotten more confused than
they’d been before, and the ﬁeld was

larger.
That’s why I couldn’t escape
the feeling that a veritable hailstorm
of hurtling footwear was converging on
my head. All I’d felt so far was the ﬁrst
small ones, the little ones that patter
down gently just before the torrent
hits.
On the other hand, perhaps I was
just being optimistic.
It had not gone badly; no, not badly
at all. Which wasn’t to say that it had
gone right, or couldn’t have gone bet-
ter. Still not an operation with which
to be unhappy, especially when one con-
sidered that one was recovering from
recently being dead at the same time
as the exercise was running its course.
The servant slipped silently back
into
the
dining
room
through
the
kitchen door and carefully removed
the plate, stacking the used silverware
neatly atop it ﬁrst, also without the

vaguest hint of clatter or clink.
She
didn’t want to cross him again, Frad-
jikan reﬂected; no one did.
If they
were smart, that is, and of course if
they were still alive to have the second
chance. It was good to be alive.
He swirled the wine in his glass, ad-
miring its rich deep red color, its attrac-
tive if somewhat forward raspberry-
tinged nose.
Cabernet with a blend
of merlot, surely, but what was that
distinctive?
- oh, of course, almost
as much cabernet franc as sauvignon,
that would certainly do it, A bit gutsy
behind a youthful streak of tannin, but
the tannin along with the acidity gave
it a tight backbone, an overall supple
texture with a slightly peppery, spicy
ﬁnish. Ah. Of the many things Fradi
had been glad to leave behind in his
old body, the gout and the inexorably
dulling of his palate, which between

them had not only left everything tast-
ing mournfully bland but had provided
a next-day residue of extreme joint
pain, had been two lumps that had
made the greatest dent in his ability to
appreciate the worthwhile parts of life.
Now, though - ah.
Fradi
had
realized
that
Dooglas
promised to be the weak link as soon
as he’d seen Sapriel rope him in. Still,
there was no predicting Dooglas would
fall apart to the comprehensive extent
he had actually achieved.
The early
events had unfolded well; by driving
Groot toward insolvency and dishonor,
it had become consistent for the river
ship to be seized. This would have at
the least inconvenienced its passen-
gers.
Fradi had hoped things would
proceed far enough to strand them in
Oolsmouth for an extended stay, ruin
their rendezvous plans in the big city,

and most importantly put them in a
position where they could be easily
observed and monitored.
With the
collapse of Dooglas and the implosion
of the rest of the setup the ﬁrst two
of these had gone away.
The third,
though, had not been a total loss. And
there was The Hand; they should be
reporting in soon.
It would have been asking too much
to keep a constant line on all the play-
ers, and there were certainly signiﬁ-
cant holes in what he had been able
to ﬁnd out. Since that damned amulet
kept anyone from observing Maximil-
lian himself too closely, the major goal
of the exercise had been to see what
allies of Max could be ﬂushed from the
underbrush, as well as to get some feel-
ing for their capabilities and ability for
dynamic response.
So now he knew about Shaa, Kar-

lini and his wife and his no-account
servants,
Haalsen Groot,
and that
ﬂoundering barbarian, in addition to
Maximillian himself and the Mont kid.
There was also that other fellow who
had appeared out of nowhere in time
to board the ship out of Oolsmouth,
the guy with the cane. Not that he’d
looked like anyone of signiﬁcance, but
you never could tell, and it was sup-
porting players Fradi needed to ﬂesh
out the cast list anyway. Perhaps the
man with the cane was the one who
could be turned ...
So if not much had been accom-
plished, he had set limited objectives,
and those, at least, had been largely
met. The objectives had been limited,
but Fradi was still human, or anyway
it seemed reasonable to assume that,
and so he was still prey to wishful
thinking as well. He hadn’t wiped any-

one from the stage and hadn’t even
inﬂicted more than a momentary sting,
although if things had fallen a bit dif-
ferently he very well might have. Now
that would have made him know he
was alive.
Intelligence collection and
harassment were all ﬁne and good, but
when it came right down to it, if you
didn’t attack, who were you?
In the long run, though, that might
have limited the fun.
A much larger
canvas was ahead, one more suitable
for the mounting of a greater extrav-
aganza. And of course for the serious
pursuit of his mission; one mustn’t for-
get one’s mission in the midst of one’s
artistry. Fradi knew he’d been going a
bit too far when he’d fed Dooglas the
torture decree, but he’d decided to al-
low himself one direct personal touch;
a signature piece, as it were. By that
time it wasn’t going to make much dif-

ference anyway, and there were certain
standards of style to maintain.
Ego?
Fradi thought, holding the
glass by one corner of its base and
swirling the wine with an adroit move-
ment of thumb and foreﬁnger;
the
candlelight glinted off the curves of the
resulting small whirlpool and accentu-
ated their highlights.
Well, yes, ego,
but not just that.
Fradi was not the
only one who considered himself an
artist. There was, after all, his patron.
It would not do to forget his patron.
His patron was another good reason
to draw things out.
Fradi had not
been born yesterday, or even reborn.
It would not be a good idea to wrap
this up before he knew exactly why his
patron was going to all this trouble,
why Max and his research made him
uncomfortable enough to recruit Fradi
from the dead, and until Fradi had

a ﬁrm enough position from which to
ensure his own future well-being. No,
it would not do at all.
Any interesting scheme never has a
single motivation.
Soon he would leave Oolsmouth, and
then the next act would begin. There
were so many possibilities in front of
him that, like a writer with a blank
slate, it was difﬁcult to know where
to begin.
There was the man with
the cane. What about the wife? She
might be vulnerable. Wives often were.
Fradi’s smile widened. They would see.
They would all see. In Peridol, the City
of the Gadzurian Empire.
