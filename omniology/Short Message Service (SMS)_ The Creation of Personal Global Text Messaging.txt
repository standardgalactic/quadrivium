Introduction
F. Hillebrand
SMS has many applications globally, but personal text messaging, measured in terms of
trafﬁc and users, is by far the most common SMS application. We have therefore chosen a
title that stresses this personal text phenomenon.
Reasons for this Book
SMS is an incredible global success. At the time of writing (mid-2009) it can be used by
all 4 billion GSM customers. More than 50 short messages are generated per month per
GSM user. The service has created a $100 billion turnover industry. This success has been
enabled mainly by the comprehensive and robust standards that have been made mandatory
for every network and for every mobile from the very beginning. The standardisation of
SMS started in February 1985 within the framework of GSM standardisation.
We will be celebrating the 25th anniversary of SMS in early 2010. There is an interest
in understanding how this service was created, but no comprehensive description of the
genesis of SMS is available. Hence, this book will provide a record of the genesis of SMS.
The book is written by people who have been at the forefront of GSM/SMS standardisation
work from the time the ﬁrst ideas of an SMS service were created to the present day.
Therefore this book can describe the genesis of SMS from the beginning to present day.
A review of the present situation and of market forecasts shows that SMS has a promising
long-term future.
Improved Access to the Documents upon which this Book is Based
The authors have attempted as far as possible to base the contents of this book on docu-
mentary evidence. The physical and electronic archives of ETSI contain many documents
dating back to the early 1990s. However, all temporary documents of the ﬁrst six GSM

xiv
Introduction
meetings, which took place from 1982 to 1984, are missing, and for most subgroups the
early documents before the early 1990s are also missing.1
In order to ﬁll these gaps, I have retrieved the complete document collection of the
early GSM subgroups from the T-Mobile archives. In addition, Mrs Elisabeth Spindler, the
widow of the late Dr Klaus Spindler, the head of the German delegation in the ﬁrst 12 GSM
meetings from 1982 to 1986, has handed over to me most of the missing early GSM Plenary
documents and documents pertaining to Franco-German cooperation in March 2009. The
other missing early GSM documents have been retrieved by Thomas Beijer in the Swedish
State Archive in the second quarter of 2009.2
This improved documentary base makes it possible to provide a complete and objective
description of the genesis of SMS, especially the early phases. Interesting parts of the early
documents have been scanned for this book. They are of low quality owing to the limited
text processing capabilities available at the time. We have not retyped them, as we wished
to retain their authenticity.
Content of this Book
The book starts with an overview of ﬁxed-network communication services and the portfolio
of GSM services, in order to place SMS in the context of the developments in telecommu-
nications (Chapter 1). This is followed by a critical review of reports on the invention of
SMS in the press and on the Internet (Chapter 2). The development of the SMS concept
from mid-1984 to early 1987 is then reported in Chapter 3.
The key technical speciﬁcation GSM 03.40 ‘Technical Realisation of the Short Mes-
sage Service – Point-to-Point’ was developed in the DGMH (Drafting Group on Message
Handling) in the period from 1987 to 1990 (Chapter 4). The evolution of SMS features
and speciﬁcations is described in Chapters 5 and 6. The development of SMS features to
support applications other than person-to-person communication is described in Chapter 7.
Chapter 8 addresses the implementation and market success of SMS, and conclusions are
drawn in Chapter 9.
The authors and their Cooperation
Each chapter has a single author whose name is given after the chapter title. All authors
have commented on each part. The authors have also sought the comments and views of
colleagues.
Friedhelm Hillebrand was strongly involved in the early development of the concept
and has written the initial chapters. Finn Trosby, Kevin Holley and Ian Harris were the
1 These documents formed the basis of the book GSM and UMTS: The Creation of Global Mobile Communication,
which was edited by me.
2 All these documents are now in the Hillebrand & Partners company archive. The GSM Plenary documents were
handed over to ETSI for an update of the DVD ‘GSM and SMS archives 1983 to 2000’. It is intended to hand
the rest over to a public archive as well.

Acknowledgements
We would like to express our sincere thanks for thorough discussions to the former leadership
of the GSM committee: Thomas Haug, Philippe Dupuis, Martine Alvernhe, Jan A. Audestad,
Bernard Ghillebaert and Thomas Beijer. In particular, Thomas Beijer put a great deal of
effort into reviewing the draft manuscripts. Also, Mike Short of O2, former GSM MoU
chairman, deserves many thanks for his review and suggestions. Friedhelm Rodermund
(former DGMH programme manager) created the footnotes to Chapter 6.
Advice for the Reader
The Terms ‘Text’ and ‘SMS’
‘Text communication’ is a term that has existed since the 1970s. It broadly describes
all forms of text communication (Telex, Teletex, fax, etc.). Mobile network operators in
countries like the UK and Finland use ‘text’ as another expression for ‘short message’.
In France they use the term ‘texto’ for ‘short message’. It is certainly a better marketing
term than ‘SMS’. For clarity, in this book we use the term ‘text communication’ in the
broad sense. When we speak about the GSM text messaging service we use ‘short message
service’ (SMS), and when we speak about the message we use ‘short message’ (SM)’.
As described later on, text messaging functionalities appeared prior and parallel to GSM
in many forms (pagers, business platforms such as Mobitex, etc). The GSM service – short
message service – comprised elements of these but went much further: a very versatile
element for both the private and the business sectors, enabling messaging in both directions
and delivery conﬁrmation. The term ‘Short Message Service’, or ‘SMS’, was not used by
any of the prior systems. GSM succeeded in making it a brand. I think we should maintain it.
How to Find Cited GSM Documents and Other Documents
In this book, GSM documents and several other document types are cited by title and/or
number. No documents are reprinted in this book. How such documents can be retrieved is
described in Annex 2.

leadership.

Communication Networks in the
Early 1980s and the Portfolio of
GSM Services
F. Hillebrand
Hillebrand & Partners
1.1
Station-to-station Morse Telegraphy, the Origin of All Modern
Technical Text Communication
Morse telegraphy, via wires and also wireless, which existed as far back as the nineteenth
century, is the origin of all modern technical text communication. It is important to empha-
sise that text communication over radio is not at all new. It was there when GSM was ﬁrst
deﬁned, it was there many years before and indeed it has always been there for a very long
time already. The ﬁrst radio systems, the Morse systems, were created in the infancy of
radio technology, and they were still in use in the 1980s when GSM was deﬁned.
It was actually forbidden to send larger ships across the sea without having equipment
and skilled people to handle these systems. Therefore, the importance of radio text com-
munication was fully understood among communications engineers. How to integrate text
communication into the new pan-European system was part of the general discussion among
land mobile telecom engineers in those days.
These radio services were station-to-station services without any support from any type
of ‘network’.
1.2
Network-based Communication Services in the Early 1980s
In contrast to station-based communication between two radio stations, network-based com-
munication means that the users communicate with network nodes and pass their information
Short Message Service (SMS)

Short Message Service (SMS)
via one or several connected nodes to the recipients. This method enables the communication
to be supported by, for example, automatic routing, etc.
1.2.1
Telephony
The most widely used ﬁxed-network service was, of course, telephony. The service was fully
automated, and practically every household had a telephone. But the ﬁxed networks made
progress, and a range of new non-voice services was created. Therefore, it was important
to consider these for the conception and standardisation of the new GSM system, which
began at the end of 1982.
The ﬁrst fully automatic mobile communication networks went into operation in the early
1980s. Back then, the number of mobile users was very small compared with the number
of ﬁxed users. Mobile communication was seen as an extension of the ﬁxed networks, and
hence an objective was that the mobile networks should support the services of the ﬁxed
networks, and of telephony above all. Therefore, the scope of the analogue mobile networks
existing at that time was primarily telephony.1 This meant that users could make national
and international calls. For calls to mobile users, the callers did not need to know where
the mobile was at the time of calling. The mobile network provided an automatic routing of
the call. Subscriber numbers were still very small compared with the ﬁxed networks, which
was caused by high price levels on equipment, subscription and trafﬁc. People referred to
the mobile phone as the ‘rich man’s toy’. Mobile stations were mounted in cars, with high
equipment and service costs. Hence, only professional users could afford them. The situation
improved in the mid- and late 1980s. But still the penetration of the population was small.

The forefather of modern text communication was Telex (= Teleprinter Exchange). It was a
public, worldwide text communication service. It allowed dialogue between two ‘teleprint-
ers’. This was enabled by the development of suitable terminals with a keyboard and printer
function, progress in switching and transmission systems and standardisation of the service.
It was ﬁrst implemented in the 1930s. In 1979 the Telex service was used by 1 100 000 users
in 155 countries. It was used heavily for international connections. The 106 000 German
Telex users3 sent 35% of their trafﬁc to foreign destinations in 1976, which accounted for
58% of the revenue.4 There were extensions of the Telex service via shortwave radio and
1 The ﬁrst-generation systems were also used for fax and remote control, both entirely based on implementations
in the terminals.

satellite services, which allowed text messaging to and from and between ships as well as
aircraft (Maritex is an excellent Telex service to ships using the shortwave radio band).
The service was standardised comprehensively, so that it was unnecessary for agreement
to be reached between two users before communication (as later in data communication).
Instead, the message could simply be sent to any other Telex user by dialling his directory
number and thus setting up a connection.
The service had limited possibilities. The bit rate used was just 50 bit/s, which was due
to the speed limitations of the partly electromechanical equipment. The text was encoded
according to International Alphabet No. 2. This used 5 bits per character and enabled 32
different possibilities to be represented. These were used for 26 letters, without differenti-
ation of lower and upper case, and some control signals (such as carriage return and line
feed, space and switching between letters and numbers).
Telex was very successful in spite of the limitation of its service features. It was the
backbone of international business communication for many decades. Telex no longer exists
as a public service.5 It is remarkable that it worked globally, was interoperable between
equipment of all manufacturers involved and was easy to use. These properties made Telex a
great example for the conception and standardisation of OSI (Open System Interconnection)
in data communication. Telex was popular with users owing to its simplicity, speed and
reliability. Also, Telex messages were considered to be legal documents, very much like
letters. It was loved by network operators because it was highly proﬁtable. All this can
likewise be said of SMS today.
1.2.3
The Advent of Many Faster Transport Techniques for Text and Data
Telex trafﬁc had been carried on speciﬁc 50 bit/s switching and transmission systems. The
need to realise higher data rates for more comfortable text communication or for data
communication led to new developments:
The public switched telephone network was equipped with modems that could offer speeds
ranging from 300 to 9600 bit/s in the early 1980s.
New Telex switches and transmission systems with advanced features were developed.
This led to a family of circuit-switched data services using the CCITT X.21 interface
working at speeds of 600, 2400, 4800, 9600 and 48 000 bit/s.6
Packet switching services were standardised and developed. The key interface was X.25,
offering data rates of 2400, 4800, 9600 and 48 000 bit/s with synchronous transmission. Ter-
minals with asynchronous transmission used a packet assembly/disassembly unit. Possible
speeds were 300, 600 and 1200 bit/s.7
Progress of technology allowed the building of digital circuit-switched telephone
exchanges and digital transmission equipment that was cheaper than the existing analogue

equipment. Therefore, the analogue telephone network was converted in steps into a digital
telephone network. The analogue speech signals were converted into 64 kbit/s digital
signal streams. By adding a digital subscriber line, the ISDN (Integrated Services Digital
Network) was created. It offered to users two 64 kbit/s channels for telephony and a 16
kbit/s channel for signalling. This resulted in a total rate of 144 kbit/s. The rate of 64
kbit/s for a voice channel was established long before ISDN in the development of digital
transmission systems. The state of the art required such a high bit rate in order to achieve
at least the same quality as in good analogue connections.
1.2.4
Creation of New, Fully Standardised Text Communication Services
Facsimile technology was developed early in the twentieth century but did not ﬁnd a wide
use. In 1976 the CCITT approved technical speciﬁcations for powerful fax machines (groups
2 and 3 with up to 9.6 kbit/s transmission rates) working in the telephone network. This led
to the introduction of public fax services by PTTs in the late 1970s. These fax machines
were fully interoperable. Users could simply dial a connection to another fax machine,
the telephone number of which could be found in the public directory, and be sure that
the message was received and printed correctly.8 The standardisation of facsimile led to
a strong acceptance in the market. Fax was ﬁrst adopted on a large scale in Japan, as
it allowed Japanese characters to be transmitted. This led to a volume production of fax
machines. The price of these machines fell, and a breakthrough in the world market was
achieved. A large number of communication partners were available. This again drove the
usage and penetration of fax machines even to private users.
This success led to the standardisation of group 4 machines intended for ISDN with a
64 kbit/s data rate. However, the machines were expensive, so no high penetration was
achieved. Another unattractive element was the interworking with the large base of group
2 and 3 machines. For such connections the speed of the fast machines was reduced and
users had no advantage. The use of a server that could store and forward the fax messages
and would allow the fast machine to send rapidly was not considered in standardisation.
Once again, the lesson was: a wide user base and a low cost make services attractive even
if the performance is limited.
Fax was very widely used in the 1980s and early 1990s, but it was superseded by the
advent of personal computers and word processing programs such as Word. Received fax
messages could not be further processed by a PC. Some people referred to fax messages as
‘dead documents’. Therefore, users preferred to exchange text messages as Word documents
via data communication or email. Fax is still widely used in many countries. It still fulﬁls
a service need that even email cannot fulﬁl: the simple ‘remote copy’ of documents to be
sent end to end in real time. A large number of hotels still use fax for reservation purposes.

Teletex had been standardised to overcome the limitations of Telex. The initial idea was
to convert every ofﬁce typewriter into a communication terminal. The full character set of
typewriters was used. The Teletex messages were formatted as A4 pages, so that a correct
representation of letters could be achieved. This was a wonderful idea that needed global
standardisation in order to achieve a wide acceptance and volumes of trafﬁc and technical
equipment.
A very great effort was made by many network operators and manufacturers in the late
1970s to standardise this new service. As interworking between the different emerging
new transport technologies was not possible at the time at reasonable cost, an agreement
was needed on a single transport technique. There were fervent advocates of using X.21
circuit-switched digital networks with 2400 bit/s. Then there were other fervent advocates
of X.25 packet switching technology and fervent advocates of the telephony network with
modems to avoid the cost of a data network. Later the ISDN faction also urged for ISDN
offering 64 kbit/s channels for fax transmission. But none of the ﬁghting parties was able
to win, and there was no will for a compromise, so they were unable to agree on a single
transport technique. Hence, this unresolved dispute led to a segmentation of the market and
communication islands that could not communicate between themselves. Several systems
became operational in 1981, but they were all switched off during the 1980s.
Then there was an overregulation of the service. A conservative faction requested that,
in order to guarantee quality of service, every Teletex terminal be operational for 24 hours
7 days a week. This was possible if a company had one Telex machine in a separate
room, but, in instances where all typewriters had been converted into Teletex stations, this
requirement was opposed by the people responsible for ﬁre protection. The idea of using a
server to store messages to unreachable terminals and to transmit the messages as soon as
the terminals became reachable was addressed too late. Such a server was, however, already
inherent in the ﬁrst SMS concept.
In view of all these factors, for which the Teletex designers themselves were responsi-
ble, the wonderful service idea of Teletex did not ﬂy in the market. The demand for text
communication was later covered by email.
1.2.5
Creation of Value-added Text Communication Services Based
on Servers
Interactive Videotex was based on the idea of using a TV set as the user terminal and of
offering a dial-in service to a server where information could be accessed. The server stored
a lot of information for users and offered access to the remote computers of information
suppliers. The users dialled via the telephone network with a low-cost 1200/75 bit/s modem
into the server of the Interactive Videotex service. This service found a wide acceptance.
However, owing to its restrictions (formats, screen resolution, data speeds, etc.), Interactive
Videotex was uncompetitive in the time of wide availability of PCs and was replaced by
Internet browsing.

6
Short Message Service (SMS)
Message Handling Systems (MHSs) were systems where a server supported the generation
of the message by a dumb terminal. The MHS stored the message and forwarded it to the
target MHS. The recipient could then look into his mailbox and retrieve the message. The
MHS could be accessed by a wide range of services: the telephone network with a modem,
packet switching networks, etc. Such systems had been standardised since the late 1970s
(X.400 series), and the ﬁrst systems appeared in the market in the early 1980s, providing
a service that was similar to email. They were not a great success as a public service, as
the cost of access via the telephone network was too high. The generation of a message
by a dumb terminal lasted quite some time. Consequently, no operator worked on a low-
cost access, e.g. by dial-in ports in every local exchange. Another important reason for
X.400 fading into oblivion was deﬁnitely the horrendous addressing format of the standard.
However MHSs were fairly successful for closed company internal communications. Most
computer systems offered such features to their users.

The Development of Private Mobile Radio Networks
According to Wikipedia:9
Mobitex is an OSI-based, open, standard, national, public access, wireless, packet-switched
data network. Mobitex places great emphasis on safety and reliability with its use by military,
police, ﬁreﬁghters and ambulance services. Mobitex was developed at the beginning of the
1980s by the Swedish Televerket Radio.10
Mobile text and data networks for private mobile radio applications in the USA and
Canada offered in the late 1970s voice and text/data transmission in a single integrated
network.
Research work was done well before the standardisation and development phase of such
networks and services.
1.2.7
Internet, Web Browsing and Email as the Winners in Communication
in Fixed Networks
As a result of the fragmented development in telecommunications, a lack of innovation and
a lack of fundamental agreement in telecommunication standardisation in several areas, the
Internet has become the present dominant transport network. Fixed text communication has
migrated to email, and Interactive Videotex services have been replaced by web brows-
ing. The future is looming already in the shape of social networking (Facebook, etc.) and
Twitter.

1.3.1
Way of Working in GSM Standardisation
As this book may be read by people with other professional backgrounds and possibly by
students, a short tutorial on how the GSM standardisation machinery worked is offered here.
Most people believe that a group of people gather together and start to ﬁght over which of
a number of already developed solutions to a speciﬁc problem is the best. In the end, and
after much blood has been spilt, a winner is announced, and that is the standard. People
are unaware of the tremendous amount of advanced technical development work that is
involved in the standards body itself. This may even be unique to the mobile business, and
to GSM in particular.
According to Wikipedia:11
Standardisation is the process of developing and agreeing upon technical standards. A stan-
dard is a document that establishes uniform engineering or technical speciﬁcations, criteria,
methods, processes or practices. Some standards are mandatory while others are voluntary.
Voluntary standards are available if one chooses to use them.12
For mobile communication systems – intended for a global or pan-European usage – a
comprehensive standardisation is needed to achieve the necessary functioning: every SIM
card must work in every terminal; every terminal must function in every network; interwork-
ing of all networks for message/call routing and for the support of international roaming
must be possible.
The standard must enable attractive and economic services and equipment. For this,
innovations and inventions are needed. However, for standardisation, not every contribution
has to be novel. Often it is sufﬁcient to choose between several well-known solutions and
agree on just one, but the end result must be attractive to users, operators and manufacturers.
GSM standardisation work starts with an agreement about strategic targets. A work pro-
gramme containing several work items is then developed. The work for each work item
follows a structured methodology:
• stage 1: service requirements;
• stage 2: architecture and message ﬂows;
• stage 3: interfaces and protocols.
In the early years (up to 1987), decisions required unanimity. They have since been
made by consensus. Only in selected cases are votes taken. This open process allows every
11 Wikipedia, 29 March 2009.
12 ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, has very elaborate directives (199 pp.) with many
deﬁned terms. However, there is no deﬁnition of ‘standardisation’ or ‘standard’: ‘The objective of the Institute is
to produce and perform the maintenance of the technical standards and other deliverables which are required by
its members. “STANDARD” shall mean any standard adopted by ETSI’ (see ETSI Statutes).

participant to make contributions to all aspects. The process can be described as a joint
development process.
To judge the value of work in a standardisation context, it is necessary not just to look at
the creation of an idea. For successful standardisation it is necessary to write a contribution
paper, to seek support, to submit it to the appropriate standardisation working group, to
present it and to make sure that it is accepted and incorporated in an emerging standard’s
document. In many cases a good solution needs contributions from several parties. Other
activities to ensure acceptance are to become an editor of a speciﬁcation, to monitor the issue
over a long period and ensure that it is not removed and to improve it over time. Becoming
a chairman and organising the work so that the ideas can ﬂourish is also a possible way of
contributing to a successful outcome.
The agreement on a standard is a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for success in
the mobile communication market. There are so many standards that are not used, as they
are normally voluntary. Mandatory standards are made obligatory by law. This covers only
very restricted areas such as user and network safety. In GSM standardisation, the GSM
MoU Group made the GSM standards mandatory for their members. For market success it
is important that a high quality standard is actually implemented and widely used. Hence,
efforts to seek the agreement of commercial actors to use a standard are very worthwhile if
success is to be achieved in the market.
1.3.2
Service Philosophy of GSM Developed from 1982 to 1984
The GSM committee was founded at the end of 1982, and it was given the task of standar-
dising a future pan-European mobile communication service and system using the 900 MHz
band. The GSM committee agreed upon the following as basic targets for the service:
• The focus was to be upon mobile telephony, but it was expected that non-voice services
would also be required.
• Mobile stations were to be used in all participating countries, including support of hand-
held mobile stations.
• All services that existed in the ﬁxed networks were to be made available to mobile
stations.
The existing analogue mobile telephony networks had nearly no non-voice services.
Neither could they offer SMS-like services. Packet radio networks had supported text com-
munication since 1978. Also, private mobile radio systems (e.g. Mobitex) had supported
text messaging since about 1980. Therefore, a need existed to offer attractive non-voice
services in the GSM system, the next generation of mobile networks.
The ‘coexistence between vehicle-borne and handheld mobile stations’ led to a long
discussion. No existing European mobile system supported handhelds. In Central Europe
there was very limited spectrum available for public mobile services, as much of the
spectrum was used during the cold war for military purposes in many countries. Therefore,

Communication Networks in the Early 1980s and the Portfolio of GSM Services

delegates feared that insufﬁcient capacity would remain for stations onboard cars, trucks,
railways and ships where a radio connection was indispensable. However, all delegates
saw that the support of handheld stations would be attractive to customers. Therefore,
it was concluded that the GSM standard should allow handhelds to be introduced at the
discretion of the network operator. This meant that the GSM standard should allow small
cells to be implemented and should specify special functions to enable cheap handhelds.13
1.3.3
GSM’s Fixed-network-service Companions
1.3.3.1
Reference Model
A reference conﬁguration was agreed for all services that were deﬁned as companions of
the ﬁxed-network services (Figure 1.1).
The reference conﬁguration envisaged the same speciﬁcation for the terminals (TE in
the diagram) in the ﬁxed and mobile networks. Other unstandardised terminals could be
adapted by using a terminal adapter function (TA). Within the mobile network, speciﬁc
functions are needed to ensure a sufﬁcient quality of service. This includes a special channel
coding and, in some service, specialised error correction protocols. These functions could
not be understood by the ﬁxed networks. Therefore, an interworking unit (IWU) was needed
between the mobile and ﬁxed network. The special functionalities would be handled by the
TE or TA on the one side and the IWU on the other. This made it possible, in an elegant way,
to concentrate the additional functions needed for non-voice services in deﬁned units and to

and reception to save battery consumption, and slow frequency hopping to enhance the speech quality in a fading
environment.

install these according to demand without creating additional cost for the basic telephony
service.
1.3.3.2
Teleservices
Teleservices were deﬁned at the time as: ‘A type of telecommunication service that provides
the complete capability, including terminal equipment functions, for communication between
users according to protocols established by agreements between administrations’.15
A wide range of teleservices was envisaged:
• short message transmission;
• access to message handling service;
• interactive videotex;
• Teletex;
• Telex;
• fax;
• teleaction service (alarm service, telemetry service, etc.);
• picture transmission.
The Short Message Service, as a very special type of messaging implemented as an
integral part of the signalling systems, was proposed in GSM as the only new service that
did not already exist in public networks (Figure 1.2).
Figure 1.2
First description of SMS as a new teleservice in a standard document16
Efforts were made to interest the people responsible for ISDN in standardising it jointly
so that a seamless service would exist. But there was no interest on the ﬁxed side.17 The
reason for this was probably that the ISDN representatives saw mobile services as a small
brother proposing a service with severe restrictions for customers (message length) that
they did not want to impose on their customers, as they planned rich text services such
as Teletex. But they did not understand that there was a mass market for a simple service
usable on every ISDN telephone.
In the family of envisaged SMS services, only the point-to-point services were really
commercially successful. The point-to-multipoint services, later called cell broadcast, were

17 I had talks in the late 1980s at a time when we were seeking a harmonisation of supplementary services. I
undertook a second imitative when I was ETSI TC SMG chairman in the debate about ﬁxed-mobile convergence
in ETSI in the late 1990s.

not successful, as no attractive applications were found and no reasonable business model
could be developed.
Hence, the SMS point-to-point services remained the only new services that had no
companion in the ﬁxed networks. It became a very successful GSM service. This book will
explain how and why.
Substantial work was put into the standardisation of an access to message handling
systems, especially by the Nordic operators. A full technical report was developed in stan-
dardisation. The service required a dumb terminal, all intelligence was in the MHS server
and hence lengthy dialogues took place on the circuit-switched GSM bearer services used
for access to the MHS. This was too expensive, and consequently it was not accepted by
the market.
The standardisation of a mobile Teletex version was completed, but it was not imple-
mented, as the service died in the ﬁxed networks. Mobile Telex was seen as too old and
was therefore not standardised.
The mobile fax version was standardised, but it was not successful in the market because
it required clumsy fax machines connected to mobile stations and because the fax service
was superseded in ﬁxed networks during the ﬁrst half of the 1990s when the GSM systems
were launched.
The teleaction and picture transmission services were discussed at the time in the ﬁxed
network standardisation. However, the standards were not completed, and the services were
not implemented in ﬁxed networks and hence not further considered in GSM.
1.3.3.3
Bearer Services
Bearer services were deﬁned at the time as: ‘A type of telecommunication service that
provides the capability for the transmission of signals between user–network interfaces’.18
A wide range of bearer services was envisaged:
• Telephony.
• 3.1 kHz audio band signals.
• Circuit-switched data services:
– unrestricted digital (i.e. raw channel of about 13 kbit/s);
– 300 bit/s duplex asynchronous;
– 1200 bit/s duplex asynchronous;
– 1200/75 bit/s duplex asynchronous;
– 2400 bit/s duplex synchronous;
– 4800 bit/s duplex synchronous;
– 9600 bit/s duplex synchronous;
– several half-duplex versions.
18 GSM document 28/85 rev. 2, Information for Industry, p. 9.

12
Short Message Service (SMS)
Mobile telephony became the most successful service of GSM. The 3.1 kHz audio band
signals bearer service did not ﬁnd much market interest. All the circuit-switched data services
(except half-duplex) were standardised and implemented by most networks. Many had high
hopes for CS-based mobile data, and were very enthusiastic when 14.4 kbit/s and High-
Speed CSD came around. However, this range was not very successful in the market, for
many reasons:
• The call set-up time was way too long.
• Even high-speed data were not fast enough for Internet browsing.
• Reliability was a problem. There were dropped calls all the time, caused by the poor
radio coverage early on.
• In the early years, laptops were pretty clumsy and heavy.
• Moreover, the charges per session were pretty high because most IT applications required
a dialogue between terminal and host computer, where transactions took place only from
time to time. The channel was therefore not used most of the time, but the charging
counters counted the entire connection time. The network operators could have applied
some sort of volume charging, as the function of DTX (Discontinuous Transmission) did
make sure that radio resources were only used when data were sent.
Around the year 2000, the GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) in GSM took these
applications over.

GSM/UMTS was preferred by 89.5% of all mobile users at the end of 2008.21 Therefore,
it is the dominant standard for mobile communication.
By 2002, mobile telephony had already overtaken ﬁxed telephony in the number of
subscribers worldwide (Figure 1.4).
The number of GSM subscribers is greater than the number of Internet users (Figure 1.5):
3552 million versus 1542 million in 2004. Hence, more people can use SMS than email.
It is estimated that the world market saw about 3–4 trillion short messages and a revenue
of the order of $80–100 billion in 2008. A substantial growth in the number of messages
can be expected in the coming years. The growth in revenue will be slower. More details
can be found in Chapter 8, Section 8.4.

Who Invented SMS?

2.1
Introduction
There have been many reports in the press about the ‘invention’ or ‘discovery’ of SMS. The
terms ‘invention’ and ‘discovery’ are used often in a very loose way. In order to understand
what has happened, what was claimed and which claims are justiﬁed, it is necessary to
talk ﬁrst about these terms and gain a precise understanding before dealing with the matter
further in this chapter.
2.2
Clariﬁcation of the Terms ‘Invention’ and ‘Innovation’
2.2.1
Invention
An invention must be novel and not obvious to those who are skilled in the same ﬁeld, i.e.
not only to persons who have no speciﬁc knowledge in that ﬁeld:
An invention is the creation of a new conﬁguration, composition of matter, device or process.
Some inventions are based on pre-existing models or ideas. Other inventions are radical
breakthroughs that may extend the boundaries of human knowledge or experience.1
An invention shall be considered to be new if it does not form part of the state of the
art. The state of the art shall be held to comprise everything made available to the public by
means of a written or oral description, by use, or in any other way . . . .2

Innovation
According to McKeown:3
The term innovation means a new way of doing something. It may refer to incremental, radical
and revolutionary changes in thinking, products, processes or organisations. A distinction is
typically made between invention, an idea made manifest, and innovation, ideas applied
successfully.
According to Wikipedia:4
Those who are directly responsible for application of the innovation are often called pioneers
in their ﬁeld, whether they are individuals or organisations.
2.3
Was SMS Invented during the ISDN Work?
The thesis that SMS was invented during the ISDN work was asserted for quite some time
by people involved in the standardisation of network aspects of the ISDN and GSM.
ISDN is a circuit-switched multiservice network. In later phases of its standardisation
(in the early 1980s), a packet-switched communication between users began to be created
using the signalling channel of the ISDN access. At the time of the start of GSM SMS
standardisation, this feature was not very developed and was coupled to the circuit-switched
connection in order to provide a second communication channel. The solution was also
relatively complicated, as this was a packet-session-oriented concept without any limitations
on the message length. The signalling channel (D-channel) allowed data to be transmitted
at a rate of 16 kbit/s. This is a much higher bit rate than the rate of the signalling channels
in GSM. Therefore, a full OSI protocol could be used, with no need for message length
limitation. This packet switching service over the ISDN service does not envisage the use of
a ‘message handling services centre’ that could treat cases of non-reachable users/terminals.
During the phase of the SMS service speciﬁcation, we did not know how to transport
short messages in the ﬁxed network. We approached the people responsible for ISDN stan-
dardisation in several countries and tried to ﬁnd a solution for a short message service that
would span over GSM and ISDN. But they were not interested, and nothing happened.
Therefore, there is no service comparable with SMS standardised in ISDN, and the term
‘short message (service)’ is not used in this arena at all.5

5 There is, however, a type of SMS service available in ISDN now that is based on a non-standardised solution in
selected cordless phones and speciﬁc servers. It has limited functions. It uses a modem in the telephony channel
for SMS data transmission. Every ﬁrst ringing tone of the phone is suppressed. The phone listens whether a data
connection is requested. If it hears the modem tones, it will not ring, but transmit the short message.

Who Invented SMS?

2.4
Was SMS Invented by Test Engineers, Students
or in a Pizzeria Session?
The overwhelming market success of SMS led the press after 2000 to show great interest in
ﬁnding out about the origin of SMS. As newspapers want strong stories with heroes, they
searched for ‘the inventor of SMS’. It seemed to them to be unthinkable to have such an
important development and no inventor who might become rich by royalties. Two different
stories became known: the SMS discovery/invention by test engineers or students and the
Copenhagen pizzeria story.
2.4.1
Was SMS Discovered or Invented by Test Engineers or Students?
This storyline developed in the UK. On 5 December 2002, the tenth anniversary of SMS was
celebrated by the 160 Characters Association. Articles appeared about the ﬁrst transmission
of a short message in December 1992.6 In December 2007, the 15th anniversary of SMS
was celebrated and the story of the ﬁrst SMS was repeated.7
Some newspapers went further and described the event of the ﬁrst message transmission
as an occasion where a hidden possibility of the GSM system was discovered or even
invented.8
A Finnish newspaper claimed, however, that the ﬁrst short message was sent in Finland.9
The Finnish journalist also mentioned that there were rumours that Nokia engineers had
discovered the possibility of sending messages. In addition, she reported about a book
publication: ‘The technology had been invented by Finnish schoolboys who were nervous
about asking girls out for dates . . . and Finnish schoolgirls who wanted to tell each other
about what happened during the dates . . . ’.10
The sending of the ‘ﬁrst short message’ cannot be interpreted as the invention of SMS
because SMS was not created by the act of sending the ﬁrst message. Instead, SMS required
much effort to develop concept ideas, standardise the service and implement it in many
networks.
2.4.2
Was SMS Invented in a Copenhagen Pizzeria Session in 1982?
There was a series of reports in European newspapers about the invention of SMS. The
source of these reports was a publication in Helsingin Sanomat in a special monthly supple-
ment called Kuukausiliite in May 2002. The journalist had found a Finnish engineer who

had reported that he had discussed with colleagues in a Pizzeria in Copenhagen in 1982
the possibility of transmitting texts between mobile stations. This general idea had not been
further elaborated by methods, techniques, conﬁgurations, etc. They had neither documented
their idea nor provided contributions to standardisation.
The journalist interpreted this as the invention of SMS. This story found its way into
Wikipedia and even led to an innovation prize from The Economist in October 2008.
However, this idea was not novel, as a broad range of text messaging services had been
standardised and in operation before the date of the Pizzeria session:
• There had been Morse telegraphy radio transmissions of text since before 1900.
• In the 1970s, Telex, a worldwide text messaging service, provided text messaging to,
from and between mobile stations onboard ships or aircraft.
• Packet radio technology for text and data communication was ﬁrst used by radio amateurs
in Canada in 1978.
• Mobile text and data networks were ﬁrst used in Sweden (Mobitex), the USA and Canada
in the late 1970s–early 1980s.
The content of the invention claimed by the journalist was just the exchange of text
between mobile stations, and the idea had not been speciﬁed further by methods, techniques
or conﬁgurations. This idea was known in the state of the art and hence was not novel.
Therefore, it was incorrect to call it an invention.
2.5
A Clarifying Discussion within the GSM Community
in Spring 2009
As a reaction to the various press reports, a discussion within the former leadership of
the Technical Committee GSM took place in order to set the record straight. There were
also discussions with the participants of the Pizzeria session mentioned in Section 2.4. The
participants Thomas Beijer, Philippe Dupuis, Thomas Haug, Friedhelm Hillebrand, Kevin
Holley, Matti Makkonen, Seppo Tiainen and Finn Trosby agreed as follows:
The increased international interest in knowing the roots of the present highly successful
mobile services has often focused on one speciﬁc service, SMS, the Short Message Service.
The success of SMS has been a surprise to many, and its global popularity is a natural reason
for the interest in its origin.
We, ex-colleagues from the time when cornerstones of the present modern mobile com-
munications were created, have studied together the state of the art in telecommunications
and old documentation from the European Standardisation Committee GSM preserved in the
ETSI archive. Based on the study and our discussion, we agree on the following:
1. Text messaging was a known telecommunications service years before the development
of GSM, the Global System for Mobile communications, started in 1982 as pan-European
cooperation.

Who Invented SMS?
19
2. Proposals for text messaging as a service in GSM were made by the cooperating Nordic
operators as well as by the cooperating German and French operators.
3. The Nordic operators focused their work on text messaging by using an access to a
message handling system, a service similar to email. This service was standardised by
the GSM committee. It led to a technical report on the technical realisation of access to
message handling systems.
4. The German and French operators focused their work on ‘Short Message Transmission’.
This proposed service uses a dedicated services centre and transmits the text messages
over existing signalling paths of the GSM telephony system on a lower-priority basis.
This transmission method obviously restricts the message to be short – maximum length
initially estimated as 128 octets, later optimised to 160 characters, still sufﬁciently long for
most personal or professional purposes. The concept was developed in the Franco-German
cooperation programme in the 1983/4 timeframe.
5. In a ﬁrst work phase from February 1985 to the end of 1986, the GSM committee speciﬁed
the service features of the Short Message Service (SMS). Most contributions came from
Germany and France.
6. From 1987 onwards, the technical realisation of SMS was standardised in a small group
called Drafting Group on Message Handling. The ﬁrst chairman of this group and the
editor of the key technical speciﬁcation were provided by Norway (later replaced by the
UK), and technical work was mostly provided by Finland, France, Norway and the UK.
The ﬁrst phase of the SMS speciﬁcations comprised items such as service deﬁnition,
network architecture, topology and protocols, acknowledgement capabilities, functionality
for alerting on messages waiting, time stamping and capabilities of identifying application
protocols.
7. The further evolution of the SMS was standardised in the same small group led by the
UK (where the technical work was mostly provided by the UK). Examples of enhance-
ments from this period are automatic replacement of messages, so-called ‘ﬂash SMS’ and
voicemail icons, followed by colour and picture capabilities and long SMS.
Our conclusion is that the origin of the text messaging services in GSM can be found in
the historical development of telecommunication services. SMS was created by a small group
of people. Work on the standardisation of services and technical realisation was approved
by the GSM committee dealing with the standardisation of the new Pan-European Mobile
Communication Service and System.11

The Birth of the SMS Concept in the French and German
Network Operators
3.1.1
Introduction
As shown in Section 2.5, the roots of SMS creation were in the work of the operators of
France and Germany. In order to meet the huge short- and medium-term demand for mobile
telephony, a cooperation programme started in mid-1983 with the target of developing and
implementing a common ‘interim’ analogue 900 MHz mobile communication system (S900
cooperation programme) that was to cover the demand until GSM became available. A start
of operation was envisaged in both countries in 1986.
In mid-1984, both parties made the decision not to pursue the idea of an analogue non-
standardised interim system but to go directly for the standardised pan-European digital
mobile communication system GSM. They agreed ‘to introduce before the end of the present
decade a common digital cellular radio communication system based on a European standard,
the deﬁnition of which is presently under way in CEPT’.1 They planned as a ﬁrst step a
joint experimental programme for digital mobile communication techniques. The new target
required much more intensive joint work to prepare contributions to the GSM standardisation
work. This second cooperation programme with the GSM focus was called the DF900-
cooperation programme.

Short Message Service (SMS)
The joint work was steered by the DF Project Group. It was jointly chaired by Philippe
Dupuis (France) and Dr Klaus Spindler (Germany). The minutes of these meetings and
most meeting documents have survived.2 This group worked mainly on strategic matters,
of course, but there are some relevant traces of SMS-related aspects (see Section 3.1.2).
Then there were small subgroups dealing with service aspects, radio aspects and network
aspects. The subgroup dealing with services was jointly led by Bernard Ghillebaert (France)
and Friedhelm Hillebrand (Germany). The documents of this group did not survive.3
In Section 3.1.2, all relevant documentary evidence that has survived will be considered.
In Section 3.1.3, memories of the programme leaders are reported. Section 3.1.4 describes
the preparation of the input to GSM Plenary in February 1985, where the standardisation
of SMS started. Section 3.1.5 discusses the signiﬁcance of the results.
3.1.2
Documentary Evidence that Survived
After so many years, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd documentary evidence. The search is sometimes
like archaeology. Often only small traces have survived, which need to be put in context and
interpreted. The totality of the pieces found results in a fairly good mosaic of the development.
3.1.2.1
Roots of SMS in ‘Enhanced’ Paging Integrated in a Multiservice Mobile
Communication System
After standardisation of the ﬁxed ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) in the late
1970s there were also ideas in many minds to integrate several mobile services into a new
public digital mobile communication network.4 Advanced PMRs (Private Mobile Radio
networks) and PAMRs (Public Access Mobile Radio networks) integrated several services
such as speech, text and data in one network (e.g. the PAMR network Mobitex, which was
conceived in about 1981). The idea of a single network supporting several services was
from the beginning part of the GSM concept at the end of 1982: ‘It is expected that, in
addition to normal telephony trafﬁc, other types of service (non-speech) will be required
in the system’.5 Such statements were based on inputs from the Netherlands and Nordic
countries in the meetings preparing the way for the ﬁrst GSM meeting.
A radio paging service was proposed as an integrated feature of the future pan-European
mobile communication system in CEPT working group SF (Services and Facilities) in March
1983 (Figure 3.1).6
2 The documents should be available in the archives of Orange France and T-Mobile Germany. Copies are available
in the company archive of Hillebrand & Partners.
3 Participants were Christian B´enard-Dend´e and Ulrich Grabolle, but the principal work on SMS was done by
Bernard Ghillebaert and me. Unfortunately, again, the personal notes of all participants have not survived.
4 Such concepts were discussed early in the Nordic cooperation. It was mainly driven by Jan A. Audestad.
5 See GSM 02/82, Section 3c.
6 Quoted from ‘Summary of deﬁnitions’ taken from the SF handbook in document GSM 14/83, March 1983, put
together by Thomas Beijer, Sweden, and submitted to GSM in March 1983, Section 2.4. This deﬁnition is also
found in GSM 38/83 of October 1983.

25
Figure 3.1
Proposal for a radio paging service in the future GSM system
GSM asked SF for a clariﬁcation and deﬁnition,7 but no further input was received on
this matter from SF.
The French ‘Marathon’ project, a research project for a new digital mobile commu-
nication system, proposed to integrate alongside the telephony service a data service, a
store-and-forward mailbox service and an evolved paging service. This was described in
a technical paper in November 1982.8 The evolved paging service is characterised as ‘a
service of a fast distribution of short messages on radio paths (type Eurosignal9 ‘evolved’,
with or without conﬁrmation of the reception (depending on the technical and economical
feasibility))’. The ‘evolution’ dealt with the greatest problem of paging services. Existing
paging services sent out the message by radio, often repeating it once, but there was no
conﬁrmation from the recipient to the sender that the message had been received.
3.1.2.2
A Surprising Proposal in the S900 Interim System Context
A proposal can be found in a French input document to the S900 programme of 12 September
1983.10 In Section 7.6 of this document, a service is described (Figure 3.2).

10 Functional Speciﬁcation for a Cellular Radiotelephone System Common to Several Countries, document
S900–16, Section 7.6. This document is a draft version of the functional speciﬁcation. It is probably the ﬁrst
draft and may therefore be considered as a French proposal. The mention of DTM/DS on the front page means
that Philippe Dupuis was the editor of this document.

26
Short Message Service (SMS)
It might seem astonishing that such a feature was proposed for an analogue mobile
communication system, but modern analogue mobile systems like the C450 network in
operation in Germany and the S900 design used a core network that was based on a digital
switching system and had digital control channels separated from the speech transmission
channels throughout the system. These systems would have allowed the implementation of
a short data message service.
The service proposed in the section cited above is unidirectional to the mobile user and
is limited to mobile stations that have been speciﬁcally equipped. Hence, this proposal is a
variant of the enhanced paging services integrated into a mobile communication system.
However, such a complicated new feature was not compatible with the necessary time
plans for an interim system that was to cover the mobile telephony demand until GSM
became available. Nobody thought of SMS as a function for the S900 interim system.
Hence, the idea was deleted in the ﬁnal version of the request for proposals.11
Nevertheless, the text shows that many elements of the later SMS proposal were state-of
the art thinking at an early time.
3.1.2.3
The Mutation of an Enhanced Paging Service to a General Short Messaging
Service in the Speciﬁcation Process of the DF900 Trial Systems for GSM
The joint experimental programme planned by France and Germany for digital mobile
communication techniques envisaged several projects: ‘Each project concerns the design,
manufacturing and supply of experimental models of radio subsystem elements of a 900 MHz
digital mobile communication system. By experimental model is meant equipment making
it possible to conduct experiments in laboratories and ﬁeld sites. These experiments will
aim to compare different technical solutions applicable to the radio subsystem’.12
For the technical speciﬁcation of the trial system in the coordination meeting on 29–30
October 1984, France proposed the inclusion of an enhanced paging service (Figure 3.3).13
Figure 3.3
Requirement for an enhanced paging service in a GSM trial system in October 1984
The document was discussed in the meeting and changed at a request from Germany from
an ‘enhanced’ paging service to a general (short) message transmission service (Figure 3.4).14

Change of the requirement for an enhanced paging service into a two-way messaging
system in a GSM trial system in October 1984
The technical speciﬁcations for the trial systems were discussed in the DF900 coordination
meeting on 12 November 1984 in London, again in order to ﬁnalise them for the request
for proposals to be sent to industry in due course. There, again, the draft input document
of France was modiﬁed at a request from Germany, consistently with the former changes
(Figure 3.5).15
Figure 3.5
Change of the requirement for an enhanced paging service into a two-way messaging
system in a GSM trial system in November 1984
Paging is by deﬁnition of the ITU a one-way service. Therefore, the term had to
be changed in order to express the two-way functionality properly. By these changes,
the integrated enhanced paging service, which was directed from the ﬁxed network to
a mobile subscriber, was changed to a general short messaging service that could be
mobile-terminated and mobile-originated. It could support communications between mobile
and ﬁxed users as well as between mobile users.
This modiﬁed text was included in the request for proposals for the trial systems that was
sent to industry in early December 1984. This shows the agreement between France and
Germany not to include an enhanced paging service but to go for a general short message
service.16
3.1.2.4
A Technical Discussion and Input to GSM#07 Plenary in November 1984
There was an intensive discussion about the channels on which packet data should be carried.
Frieder Pernice17 proposed not to use associated control channels for this purpose, as they
would have a capacity of 100–300 bit/s only. If these channels were upgraded to the needs
of packet data transmission of several kbit/s, the spectrum efﬁciency of the system would

be impaired.18 This ended the discussion on using associated control channels for general-
purpose packet data transmission. The subsequent discussion in the DF900 programme
concentrated on the use of associated control channels for short messages only.
A reﬂection of the discussions and internal studies can be found in an input document of
France to the GSM#06 meeting in November 1984.19 It discusses principles for layer 2 of
the interface between mobile station and base station and states that ‘MS_BS link protocols
may be established for signalling or for some kind of data application such as short message
transmission’. This contribution was brieﬂy discussed by Working Party 3 Network Aspects
and then integrated into the meeting report for further study and agreement.20 Here, the
term ‘short message transmission’ is used but not explained. This means it must have been
familiar to the authors of the contribution. The Working Party 3 meeting obviously did not
discuss the input document thoroughly, or else a deﬁnition would have been added.
Two documents from the DRM conference in Espoo in early February 1985 (before the
GSM Oslo meeting) mention enhanced paging by short message transmission. Their authors
are from Germany and France.
3.1.3
Memories of the Work on the SMS Concept in the Second Half
of 1984
Both in France and Germany there had been study work on new digital mobile commu-
nication systems since the early 1980s. From the end of 1982 onwards, both countries
participated in GSM work. Some discussions on GSM work had already taken place during
the S900 cooperation project.21 With the agreement on the new focus for Franco-German
cooperation on the GSM system in mid-1984, joint preparatory work for the GSM committee
was strongly intensiﬁed.
In Germany we had a number of preparatory internal meetings.22 The Franco-German
DF900 Project Group had an intensive discussion about GSM standardisation in a meeting in
September 1984.23 Further discussions took place during the Franco-German Project Group
meetings in 1984 and 1985.24
But separate working meetings on service aspects also took place.25 Some dates can
be found for these meetings, but no minutes or meeting documents have survived.26 Most

team members had a background in text and data communications. As no documents have
survived, I would like to report from memory on the work in the services working group.27
3.1.3.1
The Overall Expectations and Possibilities in the early 80s
The best-known study on demand for mobile services was elaborated by PACTEL in 1981
for the EURODATA Foundation.28 It forecast 5–20 million mobile users for Europe in the
year 2000.29 This means about 1–3 million users in the larger European countries. This was
only a fraction of the number of ﬁxed telephony users. And with the high number of trucks,
buses and executive cars, this means that only a small fraction of the number were hand
portables. This picture was consistent with the possibilities. As the cold war was still going
on, most of the envisaged 900 MHz spectrum was in use by the armies of many countries
that were assembled in Europe.
3.1.3.2
A Possible Concept for a General Short Message Service
The strategic targets of the GSM committee made it clear that the GSM system needed to
be optimised for telephony as its most important usage. The cost for telephony needed to
be low in order to reach the mass market. There was an interest to have attractive non-
voice services to make the new system future proof. However, the size and kind of demand
was unclear. Therefore, no advance investments for non-voice users could be justiﬁed. In
this context, our thinking on possible non-voice services began. We discussed a range of
services. The following text concentrates on what became the SMS.
A key success factor for telecommunication services is a large number of possible com-
munication partners.30 Hence, it was envisaged to equip every mobile station for SMS, to
enable market success.
To do this practically without additional cost, features existing in the mobile station for
telephony purposes, such as the keyboard and display, would need to be used. For message
transmission, the signalling links needed for telephony could be used. Such links had a
limited throughput. Owing to the limited quality of the underlying radio links, the protocols
used frames with a length that would allow only the transmission of a short message.
Also, SS#7, the signalling system used within the ﬁxed part of the mobile network and
between mobile and ﬁxed networks, had a maximum frame length of less than 300 bytes,
of which only a part was usable for short message transmission. For a simple solution, no
27 The result as reported here has been reviewed in a brainstorming session between Bernard Ghillebaert and me
in London on 24 March 2009.
28 The EURODATA Foundation had been created by the European data network operators in order to publish detail
about data communication services available in the European countries. It also published data user numbers and
trafﬁc that existed and forecast such numbers.
29 Results quoted in DF900 trial systems request for proposals 11 November 1984. First mentioned in the DF
meeting on 30 October 1984, in document DF900-3.
30 This was experienced in the 1970s when several new services were introduced. The most striking example is
fax. Fax trafﬁc took off only after the rigid standardisation of group 3 machines and their wide availability.

30
Short Message Service (SMS)
session concept with a breaking down of long messages into a sequence of packets could
be envisaged. This led to the technical possibility of designing a short message service that
would be able to send and receive short messages with acknowledgements. The maximum
message length was estimated in the beginning as 128 bytes, allowing the transmission of
about 146 characters using 7 bits per character of International Alphabet No. 5.31
The only new network element needed was a dedicated server to store and forward the
short messages. This server could also take care of the delayed transmission of messages
to mobile stations that were temporarily unreachable. Initially there was the hope that
this could be done by a standardised message handling system. However, during the
standardisation it turned out that a dedicated short message service centre was the optimal
solution (see Section 3.2.2.3).
3.1.3.3
Feasibility of a Short Message Service
The key question, however, was whether such a restricted service offering only the possi-
bility of exchanging such short messages would be useful to future mobile users at all. No
possibility of market research existed. Intensive discussions led to two convincing positive
plausibility arguments that it was possible to create a useful service in spite of the severe
limitation on message length:
• In the consumer market, postcards with a photo or drawing on one side and an address
and text ﬁeld on the other side were very popular. Many postcards carried less than 146
characters.
• In the professional market, Telex was at the time the most widely used text messaging
service. More than half of all Telex messages were shorter than 146 characters. Telex
used a circuit-switched connection and allowed a dialogue between the two machines
while the connection was established. Therefore, a lot of short messages existed in the
Telex service. Also, many fax messages were short at the time.
3.1.3.4
Coding of Characters and Text Formatting
As code for the characters, the International Alphabet No. 5 using 7 bits per character was
a natural choice, as it was widely used in new telecommunication services.32 For short
messages, page formatting would be useless. Hence, a simple line-oriented transmission
was seen as sufﬁcient.
31 This size could be enhanced to 140 bytes carrying 160 characters later in the standardisation work (see Section 4).
In the mid-1990s it became possible to create longer messages and transport them by concatenated short messages.
See Section 5.
32 The parity bit (eighth bit) was not needed, and neither were the control characters – hence the 7-bit default
alphabet for SMS. Control character positions were populated with European national variants.

31
3.1.3.5
Display and Generation of Short Messages
The short messages could be shown on the display which the receiving mobile station
needed anyhow for telephony functions. Such displays were not very large at the time, but
the text could be scrolled to be read.
The generation of a short message by a mobile station was not so easy. The use of an
external, fully featured keyboard connected to the mobile station was clumsy and hence
unattractive.33 Telephone keypads at the time, in several countries, had letters besides the
numbers on the keys, as is the case today in mobile stations. These were used to dial
‘names’ of subscribers. Such keypads were standardised. They could be used to type the
characters of short messages by repeated typing of the same key. This was not comfortable.
Our French colleagues were sceptical as to whether this was practical for wide usage in the
market. I thought that for a mobile user with no other option it might be acceptable. We
all underestimated the capability of young users to play virtuoso on a standard telephone
keypad, as well as the creativity of developers (T9 system34).
Messages coming from the ﬁxed network could be created by a terminal with a fully
featured keyboard connected to the ﬁxed network. In France, the Minitel terminal and
service was used in practically every household. This service was introduced initially to
replace the telephone directory book by an online retrieval of telephone numbers. Many
other applications were added to this system over time. The creation of a short message
to be sent to a mobile station could be easily added. In most other countries an interactive
videotex service standardised by CEPT existed that could also be easily expanded for the
generation of short messages to be sent to mobile stations. The interactive videotex services
have now been replaced by the Internet, but it is still possible to send short messages from
an Internet terminal to a GSM mobile station.
3.1.3.6
Communication Directions
The long existing idea of an enhanced paging service integrated into the new mobile
communication system could be realised by the short message service ‘point-to-point,
mobile-terminated’. A message could be generated with a Minitel terminal or Interactive
Videotex terminal and be sent to the SMS server and from there to the mobile station. This
service is actually a sort of enhanced paging with a technical conﬁrmation for the receipt of
the message. Also, the message length was longer than in most existing alphanumeric paging
systems. The thinking in France started from this service, as can be seen in Section 3.1.2.
In Germany we were thinking of a more general text messaging service, where mobile
users could also generate and send a short message. This message could be put on the server
used by the SMS for retrieval by ﬁxed users. The server could transmit the short message
to another mobile user.
33 Later, for several mobiles, attachable keyboards were developed (e.g. by Ericsson).

First Step to a Realisation: The Proposal for Standardisation
Submitted to GSM#07 Plenary in Oslo from 25 February
to 1 March 1985
3.1.4.1
The Start of the SMS Standardisation
The idea of a general short message service was included as a requirement in the technical
speciﬁcations of the DF900 trial systems, as described in Section 3.1.2.3. In order to ensure
the realisation of SMS in the GSM system, it was decided by the French and German
operators to propose SMS to GSM for standardisation.
The GSM#06 Plenary in November 1984 had announced that the GSM#07 meeting from
25 February to 1 March 1985 in Oslo would focus on services and facilities. There had
already been WP1 meetings on services during the plenaries in Rome and Gothenburg.
These were ad hoc meetings overseen by the Chairman of the CEPT group SF (Services
and Facilities). But progress has been slow. The original expectation that the services work
would be done by CEPT group SF did not come about, as SF was overloaded with ﬁxed
network subjects and the participants had a ﬁxed network background and no speciﬁc
knowledge about mobile services.35 Therefore, GSM planned Working Party 1 Services
during this Plenary to process the expected input. Martine Alvernhe (France) was appointed
Chairman during the GSM Plenary in Oslo. WP1 Services met regularly from then on and
was later conﬁrmed by GSM as a permanent working party. There had been WP1 meetings
before the Oslo meeting, but they had the mandate to study the viability of hand portables.
Therefore, the WP1 meeting in Oslo was the ﬁrst meeting of the WP1 services group.
3.1.4.2
The Proposed Structure and Classiﬁcation for Standardisation
To be successful, telecommunication services need robust functioning. The possibility of
sending messages to a very large number of users requires a complete and robust standardi-
sation. We thought it would be best to follow the methodology developed in ISDN, namely
ﬁrst to deﬁne the short message transmission as a teleservice (stage 1) and then to develop
the architecture and message ﬂows (stage 2) and ﬁnally the detailed protocol specs (stage 3).
After some discussion, we came to a joint proposal with three different services for short
message transmission (Table 3.1).

The Creation of the SMS Concept from Mid-1984 to Early 1987
33
In order to ensure broad implementation, we used a classiﬁcation method that was devel-
oped, to my recollection, in the ISDN context. A service can be classiﬁed as ‘essential’,
which means that it is mandatory for every network and mobile station. If it is classiﬁed as
‘additional’, then network operators can choose whether they implement it in their networks.
However, if it is implemented, the standardised speciﬁcation needs to be applied.
We agreed between France and Germany that the SMS ‘point-to-point, mobile-terminated’
should be classiﬁed as ‘essential’.
However, we could not agree between France and Germany on a classiﬁcation as ‘essen-
tial’ for mobile-originated possibilities owing to differing views on the suitability of the
clumsy input mechanism for a mass market. Therefore, this service was classiﬁed as
‘additional’, which meant that it would be fully speciﬁed in the standard. If a manufac-
turer or operator chose to use this variant, they would need to be compliant with the
speciﬁcations.
3.1.4.3
The Finalisation of the Input
We had a meeting to ﬁnalise our input on 12 February 1985 in Paris.36 In order not to
ﬂood the delegates, we decided to create a relatively short description of the SMS within
the comprehensive input document GSM 19/85 which covered all proposed services and
principles for them.
This document introduced the idea of a short message service for the ﬁrst time to the
GSM committee. In order not to create resistance, we described just the short message
transmission point-to-point mobile-terminated and brought the rest of the material to the
WP1 meeting that took place during the GSM meeting.
This document was the ﬁrst of a long series of GSM contributions prepared jointly by
Bernard Ghillebaert and me. Philippe Dupuis used to call them the ‘Ghillebrand’ documents.
3.1.5
Signiﬁcance of the Results in the DF900 Cooperation in the Second
Half of 1984
Probably none of the elements of the common SMS proposal to GSM was novel. This
is certainly true for the inputting of text into a mobile station, the transmission of a text
message to another mobile station and the appearance of the message on the display of the
recipient. The concept of an integrated enhanced paging service was not novel, as it was
mentioned in CEPT groups in March 1983.37 Neither was the data transport on signalling
links novel, as this existed, for example, in the speciﬁcations of ISDN user–user signalling.
Hence, none of the elements of the SMS proposal can be called an invention. However, the
combination of the elements in the SMS package was probably novel.

34
Short Message Service (SMS)
The SMS proposal developed in the DF900 cooperation in the second half of 1984 had
the objective of creating a service that would be useful to customers. Therefore, not only
was a service concept proposed, but also a process for standardisation and implementation
was started. The ﬁrst steps were:
• to build a consensus of two large European network operators38 to implement SMS;39
• to include the concept as a requirement in the technical speciﬁcation of the DF900 trial
systems;
• to agree on a proposal for standardisation of SMS as a teleservice in the GSM system;
and
• to propose a classiﬁcation as essential/additional, which would ensure a very wide appli-
cation.
This type of work/achievement can be called a proposal for an innovation, as deﬁned
in Section 2.2. But the work of many more people and many more contributions were
necessary to make it work and hence to enable the innovation.
3.2
The Standardisation of the SMS Concept in the GSM Committee
from February 1985 to April 1987
The GSM committee (chairman Thomas Haug since the end of 1982) had reached an
agreement on strategic questions such as the service philosophy, targets for service quality,
spectrum efﬁciency and the support of hand-portable devices in the period from the end of
1982 to the end of 1984.
In November 1984 the GSM committee had agreed to establish an experimental pro-
gramme for the new digital radio transmission techniques and the low-bit-rate speech coding,
the two most critical new technologies needed for the GSM system. Members were invited
to offer experimental systems. These systems needed to be developed and tested. Compara-
tive evaluations of the candidates were planned for the end of 1986, and a decision for the
beginning of 1987. After this decision, a phase of detailed technical design and elaboration
of technical speciﬁcations was foreseen.
The period from early 1985 to early 1987 was necessary for the fundamental radio and
speech coding work that would assure a future-proof system. In parallel, the period was
utilised to elaborate and agree service requirements and principles of network aspects. In
the GSM#06 meeting held in London in November 1984 it was agreed to dedicate a good
part of the time of the next meeting in February 1985 to services and facilities.
38 France and Germany represented a market potential of more than 130 million inhabitants, equivalent to about
40% of the total potential in the countries working together on the GSM system.
39 This carries even more weight in view of the fact that France and Germany, as the only operators in Europe at
the time, had agreed in the cooperation agreement to implement a GSM system.

Process
In GSM#07 held from 25 February to 1 March 1985 in Oslo,40 contributions from the Nordic
operators on the telephony service and related supplementary services were submitted.41 For
text messaging, a service based on an access to MHS was proposed by them.42
The operators of Germany and France proposed a structure of teleservices and bearer
services aligned with ISDN deﬁnitions and a broad portfolio of services including a new
service called ‘short message transmission’. The conﬁguration of sending a short message
from the ﬁxed network to a mobile subscriber was described.43
The GSM committee formed a subgroup responsible for the deﬁnition of services and
facilities (Working Party 1). The chairperson was Martine Alvernhe (France). This group
met during the plenary week. Germany and France explained the full SMS concept in
this meeting.44 Working Party 1 was able to reach an agreement on a ﬁrst deﬁnition of
the services for the GSM system. In the text messaging area, this included short message
services and access to message handling systems. This GSM service scope, including the
ﬁrst SMS service concept,45 was approved preliminarily as the basis of further work by the
GSM committee in the Oslo meeting.46
The next plenary meeting, GSM#08 from 10 to 14 June 1985 in Paris,47 had again an
embedded WP1 meeting. It revised the tables of the report of WP1 approved by GSM
in the meeting in February 1985 in order to bring the terminology into line with existing
deﬁnitions. Also, the table on supplementary services was revised.48
As GSM deemed it necessary to inform the manufacturers, a version of this document
dated ‘GSM Paris June 1985’ and marked ‘Information for Industry’ was derived from

44 In the personal notes of Dr Klaus Spindler it can be seen that the mobile-originated SMS was also mentioned
in the plenary meeting. These notes are now in the Hillebrand & Partners company archive.
45 The Plenary report says that the WP1 meeting report is in Doc. GSM 28/85 and that there were two revisions.
This document 28/85 rev. 2 (date February 1985, location Oslo) was retrieved by Thomas Beijer from the Swedish

contained in the existing version of the ETSI DVD is the version GSM doc. 28/85 rev. 2 (date June 1985, location
Paris) distributed to industry after GSM#08 in June 1985.

Explanations52
This condensed ﬁrst agreed description contains the following important elements:
point-to-point SMS mobile-originated and mobile-terminated, point-to-multipoint mobile-
terminated. It envisages the use of a message handling system in the ﬁxed network
(possibly including the ﬁxed part of the GSM network). The solutions for use as a
standardised MHS turned out not to be feasible during the technical design work (see
Section 3.2.2.3). The switches in the GSM core network were standard ISDN switches.
Therefore, no store-and-forward functionality existed within any of the network nodes
MSC, BSC and BTS. As messaging required a speciﬁc store-and-forward functionality, it
turned out that a dedicated SMSC (Short Messages Service Centre) became necessary.
In addition, the classiﬁcations of ‘essential’ or ‘additional’ for the point-to-point services
are given. The deﬁnitions of ‘essential’ and ‘additional’ are also included.

Scope of Work in WP1 from Mid-1985 to Early 1987
During the period from mid-1985 to early 1987, GSM Working Party 1 elaborated service
descriptions for all GSM services, including SMS, and created the recommendation53 GSM
02.03 ‘Teleservices’ in the GSM systems.54 I was editor of this speciﬁcation during this
period. WP1 created GSM recommendations on bearer services and supplementary services.
In addition, WP1 also addressed a broad range of other service-related topics:
• types of mobile station and features of mobile stations;
• quality of service and security requirements;
• subscription and charging;
• international accounting for international roaming;
• free circulation, type approval and licensing of mobile stations.
The speciﬁc work on SMS concentrated on service requirements. It was embedded in the
work for all services and therefore did beneﬁt from this work.

53 Technical speciﬁcations were named ‘recommendations’ at that time, as they were not binding to the participants
in standardisation.

SMS Work Included in Recommendation GSM 02.03 ‘Teleservices
Supported by a GSM PLMN’
The ﬁrst version of recommendation GSM 02.03 ‘Teleservices Supported by a GSM Public
Land Mobile Network (PLMN)’ was established in September 1985.55 The service descrip-
tions for all GSM services were completed and inserted into GSM 02.03. It contained a
datasheet per service. The contributions to the SMS work in WP1 came from France and
Germany.
For SMS the use of International Alphabet No. 5 was planned.56 The information transfer
was described as packet connectionless. The description of the services concentrated on the
communication between the mobile station and the message handling system. It was required
that the received messages be conﬁrmed.
It was speciﬁed that a mobile-originated short message would need to go to the message
handling system. Thus, the message handling system became the hub of the short message
communication. How mobile-originated short messages could be further routed to a ﬁxed
or mobile user was not described.
During the WP1 meeting in The Hague from 2 to 4 April 1986, recommendation
GSM 02.03 was reviewed and updated by approximate values for several parameters,
contained in [ ] to show that they were preliminary:
• Maximum message length: [100] characters.
• Probability of correct message reception: better than [99.5]%.
• Maximum transmission delay: [10] s.57
These ﬁgures set a framework for the technical design; in particular, a relatively high
maximum delay value was proposed in order to allow a simple technical design of SMS.
The term ‘short message point-to-multipoint mobile-terminated’ was replaced with the
clearer term ‘short message cell broadcast’.
3.2.2.3
A More Elaborate Service Concept and a First Technical Concept
In November 1986, France and Germany submitted a document ‘Deﬁnition of the short
message service’ concerning the mobile-terminated point-to-point service to GSM Working
Party 1 Services Aspects and to Working Party 3 Network Aspects.58 The service-related
items were processed by WP1 in their meeting in November 1989.
WP1 considered this input in the Berlin meeting on 4–7 November 1986. A small
editing group extracted the service-relevant aspects and proposed an annex to the datasheet
of the short message teleservice point-to-point mobile-terminated in recommendation
55 GSM WP1 12/85.

GSM 02.03.59 It was sent to WP3 for comments and included in the recommendation.60 It
contained a number of requirements:
• Conﬁrmation of the use of International Alphabet No. 5.
• The requirement that users need not know the location of the mobile station they wish to
send a message to. The routing should be done automatically by the network.
• Two levels of message acknowledgement: reception of the message by the destination
mobile station and retrieval of the message by the user.
• A short message service centre that needed to be connected to the land-based part of
the GSM network was assumed instead of a general-purpose message handling system to
control message delivery.
• The user should be able to choose between two delivery options: immediate delivery
(e.g. within 5 minutes) or delivery within a given time period (e.g. 24 hours).
• Needs for international operation were identiﬁed:
– a user in country A wants to send a message to a mobile user of country A roaming
in country B;
– a user in country A wants to send a message to a mobile user of country B.
The concept was well received. The major conclusion was an agreement that it was not
practical to modify a standardised MHS centre, but that a dedicated SMS centre was needed,
as the SMS requirements were too different from the MHS requirements.
Some photographs of the GSM WP1 meeting in Berlin in November 1986 are shown in
Figures 3.9 to 3.11.
Bernard Ghillebaert (F) participated in the meeting, as shown in the list of participants,
but he does not appear in the photos. He may have been outside the room when the photos
were taken.
3.2.2.4
Other Service Aspects
The subscription in GSM 02.1361 was deﬁned without differentiation in respect of the
services included. This means implicitly that all services classiﬁed as E (essential in every
GSM network) and A (additional = fully standardised application according to operator’s
choice) would be accessible by the ‘basic’ subscription. This avoids a barrier to the use of
SMS by the need for a special subscription.
The WP1 work on charging and international accounting could be applied in principle to
SMS.62

SMS.

Work on SMS Network Aspects from Mid-1985 to April 1987
GSM Working Party 3 was responsible for network aspects of all services. They worked
closely together with CEPT SPS/SIG, a group specialising in ISDN network protocols.
They were heavily loaded to deﬁne the new network for GSM telephony. They dealt with
critical items such as mobility management, security procedures, handover procedures and
numbering/addressing/identiﬁcation. In a systematic way they developed the principles for:
• The network architecture: identiﬁcation of network elements, reference conﬁgurations and
network functions, and connection types.
• Speciﬁcation of the interface between the mobile station and the base station (general
aspects, layer 2 and layer 3).
• Speciﬁcation of the interface between the base station system and the switching system
(general aspects, layer 2 and layer 3).
• Speciﬁcation of the mobile application part, the protocol between mobile service switching
centres and between networks.
It is therefore no surprise that not much time was left for issues that were not part of
the telephony service, such as SMS or other data services. However, WP3 envisaged the
transmission of user information in addition to signalling information in the protocols of
the speciﬁed interfaces.

42
Short Message Service (SMS)
The mobility management developed by WP3 for telephony was a good basis for the
automatic routing of short messages to roaming users.64
The technical aspects of the proposal mentioned in Section 3.2.2.3 could not be treated
in WP3 Network Aspects, as this group was overloaded with the speciﬁcation of GSM
telephony-related network aspects. Therefore they were considered in 1987 by the newly
created IDEG/WP4 (see Chapter 4).
3.2.4
Conclusions
The standardisation phase from February 1985 to April 1987 resulted in a general concept
of SMS. Selected aspects of the service were described. The progress was similar to that
in other non-voice service areas. Owing to the broad range of subjects addressed, there
was a lack of contributions and resources in WP1 and WP3. Hence, priority was given to
telephony aspects. SMS therefore became a ‘Sleeping Beauty’ in this period.
Thorough technical work with more resources was necessary for progress to be made.
The necessary technical SMS work was soon enabled by decisions concerning the basic
parameters of the standard and the creation of the GSM MoU, which provided a new drive
and offered additional resources.

The Decisions of GSM#13 in February 1987 on SMS
During the GSM#13 meeting in February 1987, the basic parameters of the GSM standard
were agreed. This decision conﬁrmed the optimisation of the system for telephony and ﬁnally
decided that the GSM system should be a digital system. The key parameters of the digital
radio transmission system were agreed. A low-bit-rate speech codec was selected, which
was optimised for speech only (and not for modem signals and DTMF transmission).65
This decision made it necessary to seek a solution for circuit-switched data using terminal
adapters and interworking functions:66 ‘As a consequence of this decision, GSM agreed on
the necessity of putting extra resources on the task of deﬁning solutions for the deﬁnition
of terminal adaptors, etc.’67 In view of the fact that WP3 Network Aspects had informed
GSM that they were overloaded and could not deal with the work for non-voice services in
the required timescale, France, Germany and the United Kingdom proposed a new Working
Party 4 for non-voice services.
GSM agreed as a ﬁrst step to establish a new ‘sub-working party on data services’ in
principle, and Friedhelm Hillebrand (Germany) was appointed chairman. He was asked
to agree terms of reference with the WP3 chairman Jan A. Audestad. They agreed to

1987 by 14 network operators from 13 European countries.69
The memorandum of understanding (MoU) contained the commitment to procure the
necessary equipment and to open service in 1991 based on the GSM standard. This gave
the voluntary standard elaborated in the CEPT GSM committee a binding character for all
signatories of the MoU. The signatories also committed themselves to provide the necessary
resources to complete the standards in time.
The signatories organised a GSM MoU Plenary and working groups and an action plan.
The GSM MoU organisation took over from the GSM committee the recommendation GSM
01.06 ‘Implementation Phases’, IPR Matters and Charging and Accounting Matters. This
work was reﬁned. Also, a more detailed implementation plan for the networks and services
was elaborated. This all provided direction, energy and resources to the work of the GSM
committee and hence was also beneﬁcial for the SMS work as well.

The Beginning of IDEG/WP4 and DGMH
IDEG met for the ﬁrst time from 20 to 22 May 1987 in Bonn. In the second meeting in
June 1987 in Heckﬁeld, UK, a subgroup DGMH (Drafting Group on Message Handling)
was installed to deal with the access to MHS and SMS. The ﬁrst chairman was Finn
Trosby of Telenor. With this group, ﬁnally an appropriate working structure for technical
SMS work existed that could awake the ‘Sleeping Beauty’ SMS.
An overview of the leadership for the technical SMS standardisation work is given in
Table 3.2.
In March 2005 the work of 3GPP TSG-T was amalgamated with 3GPP TSG CN to
produce 3GPP TSG CT. The work of T2 was initially allocated to CT2, but, as the MMS
development work had been transferred to OMA and there was no ongoing SMS work, it was
decided subsequently to merge CT2 into the newly created CT1 (which had responsibility
for core network signalling). The work of CT1 was dominated by the work of the previous
CN1 group, and only two or three ex-T2 delegates attended CT1. In order to ensure that the

Background
By spring 1987, the technical work in the GSM bodies had reached the stage where it
was time to go ahead with the detailed speciﬁcations of the non-voice services. After some
discussions on how best to provide for rapid progress in this area, it was decided to establish
a new group, IDEG (Implementation of Data and Telematics Expert Group) under the
chairmanship of Friedhelm Hillebrand from Detecon.
The ﬁrst meeting of IDEG was held in Bonn in May 1987. The meetings of this group
during the ﬁrst three years are listed in Annex 3 ‘Meetings of IDEG/WP4/GSM4 and DGMH
in the Period from May 1987 to September 1990’. The attendance of the DGMH meeting
in this period is given in Annex 4 ‘DGMH Attendance in the Period from May 1987 to
September 1990’.
To propose a draft mandate and its course with the design of non-voice services, IDEG
based its work on a set of documents from the GSM main body and from WP1.
The chairman of IDEG proposed to establish a number of subgroups – or so-called draft-
ing groups – to concentrate on different subsets of the services and functionalities for which
IDEG was responsible. The normal working procedure of a drafting group was to be assem-
bled at a period of time allocated for parallel sessions. The outcome of the drafting sessions
would then be dealt with by IDEG in plenary at the end of the meeting.
At the second meeting of IDEG – Meeting 2 in Heckﬁeld, UK, July 1987 – it was decided
to establish a drafting group for the different messaging services that were listed for GSM.

Short Message Service (SMS)
The categories of objectives were twofold:1 (i) designing a set of services for the sending
and receiving of short messages; (ii) designing a set of services for the access to the MHS
(Message Handling System). At the end of the meeting in Heckﬁeld, I was appointed
chairman of the DGMH (Drafting Group on Message Handling), which was to start its
activity at the next IDEG meeting.

4.2
Some Personal Sentiments at the Start
The work in IDEG/WP4/GSM4 represented my ﬁrst participation in work with GSM, and
the assignments as chairman of DGMH and editor of GSM 03.402 my ﬁrst responsibilities
in an international collaboration. In Telenor (at that time Televerket, Norway) I had worked
in the research department on mobile communications since 1980. Much of this time was
spent on mobile messaging, mainly in two business areas:
• for professional users: mobile message services for ﬂeet management (dispatch companies,
taxis, mail distribution, etc.);
• for both private and professional users: studies of how message handling systems and
services could be accessed by mobile users.
In the mid-1980s I was project manager for a set of research activities that encompassed:
• market analysis of the above two areas of services;
• analysis and design of a messaging platform based upon X.25 that would combine both
types of service.
The market analysis showed – not surprisingly – that the Nordic market was far too small
for the provision of services based upon a system like this. However, the work with the
project was in many respects of great value, e.g. when it came to assessing the potential
of mobile messaging for a bigger market. It was with the experiences from those activities
that I entered the work in DGMH.
The instructions that IDEG were given for the provision of messaging services ﬁtted quite
well with the experience gained from participation in the activities described above. There
were several reasons for this, some very obvious. My superiors in the research depart-
ment were also taking part in the GSM discussions that yielded the instructions! Also,
our research department did not have the thick walls that separated the radio and data
communication activities of the operating divisions in many telecom companies at that
time. New concepts that combined the two areas therefore did not need the same time to

mature. And the services called for within the scope of DGMH were indeed new – in con-
trast to most of the other GSM services, most of which were ISDN replicas in a mobile
context.
Anyway, I think it is fair to say that the newborn IDEG possessed quite vague notions of
what the contour of the messaging services of GSM should be like and – even more – which
market potential the services represented.
4.3
The Instructions that IDEG Were Given for Provision of SMS
In the pile of input documents to the ﬁrst meeting, the following referred to SMS:
• the input document from WP1 on services;3
• a document from France envisaging solutions to some of the design challenges of SMS.4
The ﬁrst document envisaged three categories of short message services:
• SM-MT/PP (Short Message Mobile-Terminated Point-to-Point) – the GSM service by
which a short message might be transferred to a mobile station (MS).
• SM-MO/PP (Short Message Mobile-Originated Point-to-Point) – the GSM service by
which a short message might be transferred from a mobile station (MS).
• SM-CB (Short Message Cell Broadcast) – the GSM service by which a short message
might be transferred to a set of mobile users on a broadcast basis.
For both SM-MT/PP and SM-MO/PP, two very essential requirements applied:
• An SMS-SC (Service Centre) should act as a store-and-forward node for the messaging
process.
• A short message should be transferred to or from the mobile station both when idle or
in a state of call-in-progress. This implied that the transfer had to rely upon signalling
resources, not trafﬁc channels dedicated for transfer of user information on a circuit-
switched basis.
The French document envisaged an overall procedure by which a short message might
be transferred from the SMS-SC to the MS, indicating several scenarios of transfer through
the GSM PLMN and including acknowledgement facilities. The procedure was based upon
much of the procedure of a circuit-switched call set-up, indicating that much of the sig-
nalling resources established for this process might be applicable to SM-MT/PP. The French
document proved to be a very useful document, enabling the DGMH crew to get on the
right track faster than it otherwise might have done.

speciﬁcation number is probably a misprint; it obviously refers to the planned GSM 03.40.)

Short Message Service (SMS)
Even though the two documents referred to represented substantial and sufﬁcient
guidelines for starting the design work on SMS, the start-up time for the design of
SMS seemed to take somewhat longer than the design of the other services for which
IDEG was responsible. The obvious reason for this was that SMS was the only one not
representing a replica of an already existing service within ISDN or another ﬁxed network.
SMS thus required more time for consideration of market aspects than did the other
services.
4.4
Overall Description of the Work in the Period from 1987 to 1990
and Work Items Dealt with
4.4.1
General
Through the ﬁrst three years of DGMH, it is fair to say that the basic design was established.
Major extensions and substantial enhancements and corrections were submitted as change
requests after September 1990. However, the supporting walls and basic elements of SMS
were all in place by mid-1990.
Twenty-one DGMH meetings were held during those three years. Seventeen of those
were meetings being conducted in parallel with the meetings of IDEG/WP4/GSM4, and the
other four were meetings of DGMH alone.
Forty-six different experts attended one or more of those meetings. However, only about
eight people attended approximately one-third or more of the meetings.
Of the approximately 280 documents in the document stream of IDEG/WP4/GSM4 in the
ﬁrst three years that related to DGMH, approximately 120 were SMS-speciﬁc documents
that DGMH either dealt with or produced. Approximately 30 DGMH relevant documents
either dealt with or produced were on non-SMS issues (cell broadcast, MHS, etc.).
Most of the record of DGMH’s ﬁrst three years, as described below, is contained in the
DGMH meeting reports to WP4/GSM4.5 In two GSM4 meetings – Padua and Bath, spring
1990 – the DGMH reports were integrated into the GSM4 meeting report.6
4.4.2
Network Architecture and Transport Mechanisms
One of the ﬁrst work items to deal with was the stabilisation of the network topology. The
need for a store-and-forward node – the SMS-SC – was conﬁrmed, as was the decision that
this node should reside outside the PLMN.
Further, the requirement of the mobile user being able to send and receive short messages
during a call in progress conﬁrmed the already existing assumption that the signalling
resources in such situations had to be used for the message transfer. As substantially different

transfer schemes for the idle state and the call-in-progress state probably would require
quite complex functionality, it was decided to base the message transfer upon the signalling
capabilities for both situations.
In parallel with the discussions over the topics outlined above, the network topology
emerged for transfer of short messages (see Figure 4.3).
Owing to the decision above, there were obvious similarities between the transfer of
short messages and the set-up procedures for a speech or data call. In both cases the goal
was to establish the necessary signalling capabilities over the radio path to or from the
mobile station. It was therefore only natural that the relevant speciﬁcation (GSM 04.11,
see Section 4.8.1) had the same basic functional elements as the signalling capabilities for
setting up a regular call (GSM 04.08).
Whereas the choice of transport capabilities was pretty obvious, the corresponding choice
of transport capabilities in the core network – i.e. between MSCs – was not. Considerable
time and effort were consumed on that issue. A true review of those discussions cannot be
achieved without taking into consideration the strong standing that the X.25-based protocol
stack of OSI possessed in those days. Telecom people throughout Europe and also other
expert communities held a ﬁrm belief that the OSI protocols would constitute the bandwagon
of data communications in the future. Therefore, there were several voices heard that advo-
cated X.25-based OSI as a basis for the protocols both on the MSC ↔MSC interface and
on the SMS-SC ↔MSC interface.
The following characteristics of the MSC were important. It was well established within
the Signalling System No. 7-based MAP environment, and it did not beforehand have any
X.25-based applications – either for signalling or for handling of user information. For
these reasons it was decided, after some discussion, to develop the required functionality
for transfer of short messages within the core network (MSC ↔MSC) based on Signalling
System No. 7 rather than X.25 (see also Sections 4.6.2 and 4.8.2).
However, for the SMS-SC the situation was quite different. The SMS-SC was like a blank
sheet of paper – there were no prerequisites to be considered when entering the design phase.
Furthermore, it had been decided to locate the SMS-SC outside the scope of PLMN. Bearing
these aspects in mind, it was decided to specify an optional protocol based upon X.25 for
the SMS-SC ↔MSC interface (see also Section 4.6.3).
For both alternatives for transfer of short messages between a pair of network nodes, the
application protocol ROSE (Remote Operations Service Elements) would apply. ROSE was
originally deﬁned by the OSI community to run on OSI protocols such as X.25, but had
also been deﬁned as a part of Signalling System No. 7.
After the topology had been assessed, work started on deﬁning in more detail the transfer
of short messages to and from the mobile station. The outcome converged towards the
procedures depicted in Figures 4.5 and 4.6. In addition, work was carried out to deﬁne any
possible error situation and to deﬁne how this should be reported to the sending party.
The issues mentioned above constituted a major part of DGMH’s work on SMS during
the ﬁrst year of WP4’s existence.

50
Short Message Service (SMS)
In addition to DGMH meeting reports, network architecture and transport mechanisms
were addressed in more than 40 WP4/GSM4 documents.7
4.4.3
Service Elements
In parallel with the above activities, the work started to establish a service deﬁnition and to
elaborate which service elements should be incorporated in the SMS.
It was decided to restrict the basic service to the transfer of short messages in both
directions and the returning of the corresponding conﬁrmations or error indications. At
this ﬁrst stage there was no proposal to elaborate procedures to be encompassed by the
short message recommendation GSM 03.40 for SMS-SC ↔MS conversation only, e.g.
for address conversion in the SMS-SC (see 4.6.6). Thoughts on the feasibility of such
procedures might have lingered in DGMH even in those ﬁrst three years, but they were
probably diverted by the assumption that this might be dealt with in higher protocol layers
and by bodies outside the GSM community.
What should then be the service elements of the short message to be transferred?
The philosophy of DGMH when elaborating this area was to some extent inﬂuenced by
work on message handling in the ﬁxed networks – e.g. the X.400-based MHS concept of
ITU and ISO.
For any message handling system that will make frequent use of a store-and-forward
functionality, a time-stamping mechanism is required. The receiving party would often like
to check when the sending party submitted the message for transfer. This was considered
to be especially important for mobile communications systems, where mobile stations were
expected to be turned off or out of coverage for longer periods of time. The Service-Centre-
Time-Stamp protocol element was therefore incorporated in the message header (see also
Section 4.5.4).
Again owing to the expectation that mobile stations might be unreachable for substantial
periods of time, the Validity-Period parameter was introduced in the short message header.
If a short message happened to be stored after the Validity-Period had expired in the SMS-
SC, e.g. owing to the recipient being absent, the SMS-SC was allowed to delete the short
message (see also Section 4.5.4).
Like many other protocols for which one might at some stage experience a need to
carry an application protocol, it was considered beneﬁcial to include a parameter that would
identify which application protocol was being carried at the moment. A Protocol-Identiﬁer
parameter was thus included in the short message header, but without a speciﬁc set of values
for a corresponding set of application protocols. The inclusion of the Protocol-Identiﬁer was
a typical example of just reserving space for an element that later on might prove to be
useful (see also Section 4.5.4).

The Technical Design of SMS in DGMH from June 1987 to October 1990
51
In view of the same assumption that a mobile station might be unreachable for a rather
long period of time, the possibility was considered of a queue of short messages waiting in
the SMS-SC to be transferred. There were early considerations of the aspects of speeding
up message transfer at the lower layers by keeping signalling resources established instead
of setting them up and releasing them each time they were needed (see also Section 5.2.1
on continuous message ﬂow). For example, the ﬁrst approved version of GSM 04.11 (see
Section 4.8.1) was designed in such a way that the signalling resources were kept after
a short message transfer attempt to handle the following conﬁrmation or error indication.
According to the ongoing prioritising of work items of DGMH, it was seen as a sensible
strategy ﬁrst to stabilise the design of the simple and less efﬁcient structure of handling each
short message transfer and its conﬁrmation separately, and later to improve the efﬁciency
of transfer of short messages queuing up in the SMS-SC, as indicated. However, already at
this stage a speciﬁc parameter More-Messages-to-Send was included in the short message
header (see Section 4.5.4). The value of the More-Messages-to-Send ﬁeld in a short message
to be transferred from the SMS-SC to the MS would indicate if there were more messages
waiting in the SMS-SC to be transferred to that MS. The parameter would come into use,
for example, when the signalling resources were to handle a sequence of short message
transfers instead of just one.
When a mobile station that has been unreachable for a while turns up again, there might
be messages waiting in the SMS-SC to be transferred to it. What should the procedures
be for retrieving the short messages in such instances? Should the SMS-SC apply some
periodic transfer attempt procedure, or should mobile users themselves take action by some
manual means when they detect that they are once again in contact with the mobile network?
Schemes like this seem neither elegant nor efﬁcient. A preferable solution would imply some
mechanism that transferred the waiting messages:
• as soon as the mobile station is able to receive them and without any manual action
required from the mobile user;
• without any scheme of numerous and superﬂuous transfer attempts from the SMS-SC’s
side.
The solution that was chosen consisted of functional elements to be invoked under two
different situations:
1. When the SMS-SC fails to deliver a short message to a mobile user owing to the user’s
mobile station being switched off or being out of coverage. In this situation, a ﬂag
(Messages-Waiting-Flag) is set, and the address of the SMS-SC is stored in the location
register of the mobile station (Messages-Waiting-Data). The service element that enabled
the network to set the ﬂag and store the address was denoted Messages-Waiting.
2. When a location register with the above ﬂag set detects that the mobile station is again
both turned on and connected to the network. In this situation, the network sends an alert
to each of the SMS-SCs that have tried to transfer short messages to the mobile station
while it was not reachable. The SMS-SC will then make another attempt to transfer the

52
Short Message Service (SMS)
waiting messages. The service element that enabled the network to alert the appropriate
SMS-SCs in that situation and thereafter remove the relevant ﬂag and addresses was
denoted Alert-SC.
The service element Messages-Waiting was very much related to a paired functionality
introduced earlier by WP3, namely IMSI Attach and IMSI Detach. IMSI Detach was a
procedure invoked by the mobile station when the mobile user switched it off. Before
actually turning the power off, the mobile station would send a signalling message to the
network, asking the location register to set an IMSI Detach ﬂag. Correspondingly, when the
mobile user switched on the mobile station again, a signalling message would automatically
be sent to the network with a request that the IMSI Detach ﬂag be removed. The intended
feasibility of IMSI Attach and IMSI Detach was that they would spare the network from
superﬂuous signalling efforts, e.g. from incoming calls to mobiles being switched off. The
functionality of IMSI Attach and IMSI Detach was optional, i.e. PLMN operators did not
have to implement them. At the beginning of the GSM era, some operators were sceptical
owing to the fear that a tidal wave of almost simultaneous IMSI Attach messages, e.g. in
the morning, would jam the signalling capabilities of the GSM network. As this fear proved
to be somewhat exaggerated, IMSI Attach and ISMI Detach were implemented in almost
every GSM network.
An IMSI Detach ﬂag set in the location register would simplify a short message transfer
attempt in the sense that it would cancel the attempt, set the Messages-Waiting-Flag (if not
set already) and see to it that the SMS-SC address was contained in the Messages-Waiting-
Data in the location register. In a substantial part of the cases where the Messages-Waiting
service element would come into operation, it would be invoked by a previous IMSI Detach.
In almost every discussion about designing new telecom services at that time, different
aspects of priority became an issue. This was also the case with the design of SMS. Some
viewpoints predicted requests from authorities for a way to give certain short messages
priority above ‘regular ones’. DGMH gave those aspects thorough consideration, but did
not ﬁnd many obvious processes in the transfer of short messages in which priority settings
would have much effect. In situations where messages were queuing up in the SMS-SC
waiting for the mobile station to become reachable again, one could of course modify the
sequence – putting the priority messages ﬁrst in line. This would not matter much, as it
was expected that the transfer of each message would not take long. The last message in a
queue of four or ﬁve messages would only come about 30 seconds later than the ﬁrst one.
DGMH therefore decided to concentrate the Priority service element at another stage of
short message transfer: if a message with the Priority parameter set encounters the location
register of the mobile station with the Messages-Waiting-Flag set, the network will not
suspend the transfer attempt as it would do in the case of a non-priority message – it will
try to deliver the message in spite of the ﬂag being set.
The reason for this is that there is a marginal probability that the ﬂag may not be removed
when it should. If the mobile station is out of coverage for a short time – e.g. mounted in a
car driving through a tunnel – and then re-enters coverage in the same cell, that last event
will not be notiﬁed by the location register. If there has been an attempt to transfer a short

53
message during the period of time in which it has been absent and the ﬂag has been set,
it may stay set for a while even after having re-entered coverage, i.e. until there is some
signalling procedure that involves both the mobile station and the location register.
Now, DGMH decided that the Priority service element should relate to the above possi-
bility: if there was a transfer attempt of a short message with the Priority parameter set, the
transfer attempt would be carried out even if the ﬂag was set. Priority in this context thus
meant ‘guaranteed delivery if at all possible’.
The service aspects of SMS as depicted above and in Section 4.4.4 represent some of the
major topics to be dealt with from summer 1988 until spring 1990.
In addition to the DGMH meeting reports, the service elements of SMS were addressed
in 13 WP4/GSM 4 documents.8
4.4.4
Supplementary Services
DGMH also considered whether it was feasible to align SMS with ISDN in terms of supple-
mentary services. For many supplementary services of ISDN, no parallel for SMS could be
established, such as, for example, user-to-user signalling. For others, no parallel appeared
to be suitable, such as, for example, completion of calls to busy subscriber. Most time was
spent on a family of supplementary services that at ﬁrst glance seemed to be suitable also
for SMS: the call forwarding services. Again, for some of those an adaptation to SMS was
hardly feasible. For instance, call forwarding on busy subscriber seemed to be pretty useless
because a short message could be delivered to the mobile user even if there was a call in
progress. Call forwarding on no reply or call forwarding on absent subscriber also seemed
to be of little interest – the store-and-forward functionality was intended to compensate for
recipients being temporarily unable to receive the information.
Call forwarding unconditional was different, however. There might be several good rea-
sons for including that service in the repertoire of SMS. When starting to explore a possible
design for SMS call forwarding unconditional, a set of technical questions arose. It was
obvious that the interface between the SMS-SC and the PLMN would have to be far more
complex if that supplementary service were to be incorporated. Also, some more basic
considerations were made: call forwarding unconditional – which does not incorporate a
warning to the sender that the short message will be received by somebody other than the
intended recipient – may be less suitable in view of some code of conduct than the call
forwarding unconditional for regular voice calls. For voice forwarded calls, the caller gets
in direct contact with the user to which the call has been forwarded, and the call may be
moderated accordingly. In messaging, this is not the case. The user to which the message
has been forwarded will receive the text that the sender intended for that recipient only. In
email communication, forwarding is quite frequently used, but almost only in a manual and
individual way; i.e. the intended recipient may – after having scrutinised the incoming mail
and considered its interest to others – take manual action to forward it.

Short Message Service (SMS)
Having discussed aspects of the topics mentioned above, DGMH decided to recommend
that no supplementary service be incorporated at this stage in the SMS. The most important
reason for this decision was the wish to keep SMS as a very simple and non-complex
service.
In addition to the DGMH meeting reports, the supplementary services were addressed in
three WP4/GSM4 documents.9
4.4.5
Short Message Length and Alphabet
As mentioned above, SMS was from the early phase of conception intended to differ from
the circuit-switched services of GSM in many respects, and also in that it would have to be
carried by the signalling capabilities over the radio path. This conclusion came from some
of the basic service requirements, e.g. the requirement that short messages should be sent
or received during a circuit-switched call in progress. This reinforced the perception of a
short message as being a small piece of text. The earliest preliminary assessments of the
maximum length of short messages were 256 and, later, 180 bytes.
It gradually became apparent that the signalling capabilities on the leg between the mobile
station and the MSC did not comprise any functionality that contained a hard limit with
respect to length. Owing to the fact that the radio transmission was based upon protocol
elements of relatively short blocks, it was evident that, even for transfer of relatively small
amounts of data, the corresponding protocol would have to cope with sending several blocks
in sequence. Hence, the radio transmission was not the limiting factor. However, when
the decision was taken to use MAP for transfer between MSCs, it was obvious that a
similar investigation had to be conducted for the speciﬁc MAP operation. As outlined in
Section 4.5.8, it appeared that, owing to the use of MAP, one had to restrict the maximum
length of short messages to 140 bytes instead of 180.
The reduction in the maximum message length did not alarm the DGMH or GSM4, but
it certainly focused attention on how to exploit the message volume in the best way. Would
it be possible to reduce the number of bits per character and still be able to establish an
alphabet that would fulﬁl the requirements from SMS users? As powerful messaging sys-
tems emerged – such as the X.400 standard of MHS by ITU and ISO – a great interest in
standardisation of feasible alphabets evolved. Such work items were also the natural respon-
sibilities of ITU and ISO. The most common standard in the 1980s was IA5 (International
Alphabet No. 5) deﬁned in the ITU recommendation T.50. IA5 of T.50, as deﬁned in 1988,
was a 7-bit character alphabet based on the Latin character set but subject to a great variety
of extensions and modiﬁcations. Those would, however, only be achievable in ways that
were not easily handled by SMS. As DGMH was looking for an alphabet based on the most
frequently used characters in Europe at that time, IA5 was apparently not an optimal choice.
At that time, DGMH became aware of the work that been done in the ERMES groups,
which were assigned to specify a text paging system for Europe. ERMES had aimed at more

or less the same goal as DGMH with SMS: an alphabet of 7-bit characters that comprised
as many as possible of the most frequently used characters in Europe. The result was, of
course, a compromise in which some of the less frequent characters in the smaller languages
were missing (see also Section 4.5.9 and Figure 4.8). However, DGMH considered that this
was as close as one could come, and recommended that the ERMES alphabet replace the
IA5 alphabet in GSM 03.40 that had been adopted on a preliminary basis. GSM4 endorsed
the recommendation. Eventually, the ERMES alphabet, along with a maximum length of
short messages of 160 characters, was approved by GSM1.
The issues of maximum short message length and the alphabet of SMS were dealt with
between autumn 1989 and spring 1990. In addition to the DGMH reports, seven WP4
documents dealt with the problems of alphabet and short message length.10

Some General Remarks on the Way that Services, Networks and
Communication Protocols Were Described in the Late 1980s
Design of communication systems in the 1980s had the beneﬁt of relying on a detailed and
well-deﬁned formalism. For connection-oriented services in particular, endeavours to deﬁne
a strict model for the structure of service deﬁnition, communication protocols and protocol
layering had resulted in a set of working procedures that made it easy to gather experts from
different parts of the world to join in and contribute to a broad collaboration like GSM.
It also helped that the development of GSM was conducted partly just after and partly in
parallel with the development of ISDN.
Owing to the fact that a substantial part of the work on the design of SMS during the
years 1987–1990 was devoted to the challenge of adapting SMS to the network topology
and protocol structure of the circuit-switched domain of the GSM PLMN, this section offers
a quick review of the basics of protocol structuring in the OSI context.
Some of the core principles of service deﬁnition, communication protocols and protocol
layering are encapsulated in Figure 4.1.
In Figure 4.1, protocol elements (or, in OSI terminology, protocol data units (PDUs)) at
protocol layer n may be sent between entities A and C. A and C are not directly connected,
only via node b at a lower protocol layer.
When sending a protocol message from A to C, A’s entity at layer n instructs A’s entity
at layer n −1 to take action to make this happen. In OSI terminology, A’s entity at layer n
invokes the appropriate service primitive with the relevant parameter values of the PDU to
be sent at layer n (green arrow pointing downwards in Figure 4.1). A’s entity at layer n −1
establishes one or more PDUs to be sent at this layer to b. As indicated in Figure 4.1, PDUs
may be sent in both directions for both links A ↔b and b ↔C; e.g. acknowledgements
may be sent on the paths b →A and C →b.

Protocol layers n and n −1 connecting the three nodes A, b and C. A set of available
PDUs are deﬁned between each pair of nodes at the different protocol layers and constitute the
respective protocols. The vertical arrows in green represent the service primitives that are used to
send PDUn between A and C
A PDU at any layer comprises two parts: a header with protocol parameters, address
information at that level, etc., and a user information part (see Figure 4.2). At the uppermost
layer level, the user information part is the core information that the sending party wants to
convey to the receiving party. Going down the layers, the different entities at the sending
node add ever more data to the user information by including the header at the layer
above. The physical transfer of the core information – or the user information at the upper
layer – may thus get a substantial overhead, depending upon how many layers the protocol
hierarchy consists of and how much header information is required at each layer.
Sending a protocol message from A to C in Figure 4.1 is then achieved in the following
way: A’s entity at layer n−1 receives a service primitive from layer n, which results in
PDUs to be transferred between A and b and between b and C at layer n−1 to get the
core information to node C. It is presented to the entity at layer n in that node by a service
primitive (arrow pointing upwards in node C).
The repertoire of PDUs available between two nodes and the rules for how they should
be used is said to constitute the protocol between the two nodes at that layer.

layer n

57
The set of service primitives available between two layers at a certain node is said to be
the deﬁnition of the service that the lower layer is offering to the layer above it at that part
of the network.
For communication networks the OSI standard of ITU and ISO deﬁned a general protocol
hierarchy of seven possible layers, in which each layer served a particular purpose. Four
of the OSI layers ought to be mentioned here: the link layer (layer 2), the network layer
(layer 3), the transport layer (layer 4) and the application layer (layer 7).
The link layer would cater for transfer of data over the link between a pair of nodes.
The network layer11 would deal with address information and routing in such a way that
the layer above – the transport layer12 – and the layers above that would be relieved of
this task.
The application layer (layer 7) would encompass any application protocol to be imple-
mented between any two nodes.
The OSI structure constituted the basis upon which all communication protocols within
GSM system were based. As mentioned above, the OSI model proved to be a very powerful
and versatile concept in the design of communication systems. However, it also represented
some minor challenges. One of those became apparent when a protocol hierarchy with layers
from 1 to 7 – such as MAP based upon Signalling System No. 7 – was to be the carrier of
another type of information, i.e. when one placed protocols for transport of short messages
on top of MAP (see also Section 4.5.5). It might introduce some confusion in terms of
protocol architecture, and it would result in a signiﬁcant overhead.
4.5.2
The Speciﬁcations Deﬁning the Short Message Service Mid-1990
The short message service was in mid-1990 deﬁned by recommendations GSM 03.40 v3.4.0,
GSM 04.11 v3.1.1 and GSM 09.02 (MAP) v3.5.1. The evolution of GSM 03.40 is shown
in the table in Annex 7.
4.5.3
Network Architecture
The network architecture deﬁned in the 1990 versions of GSM 03.40 is given in Figure 4.3.
11 From Wikipedia, 24 July 2009: The Network Layer is responsible for end-to-end (source to destination) packet
delivery including routing through intermediate hosts, whereas the Data Link Layer is responsible for node-to-node
(hop-to-hop) frame delivery on the same link. The Network Layer provides the functional and procedural means
of transferring variable length data sequences from a source to a destination host via one or more networks while
maintaining the quality of service and error control functions.
12 From Wikipedia, 24 July 2009: In computer networking, the Transport Layer is a group of methods and protocols
within a layered architecture of network components within which it is responsible for encapsulating application
data blocks into data units (datagrams, segments) suitable for transfer to the network infrastructure for transmission
to the destination host, or managing the reverse transaction by abstracting network datagrams and delivering
their payload to an application. Thus the protocols of the Transport Layer establish a direct, virtual host-to-host
communications transport medium for applications and are therefore also referred to as transport protocols.

are given by the unbroken lines. The links on which only signalling information is conveyed are
given by the dotted lines. The BSC and BTS are shown in smaller size and fonts because the
protocol layer deﬁned in GSM 03.40 does not involve these nodes
The different nodes of the SMS network architecture were as follows:
• SME, Short Message Entity. Any entity capable of sending or receiving short messages
to or from a mobile station. The most obvious alternative was, of course, a GSM mobile
station in a GSM PLMN, but it could also be, for example, a Telex terminal in the Telex
network, a telephone with alphanumeric keys in the PSTN or a PAD terminal connected
to the PSPDN. The SME potential was completely dependent upon the interworking
capabilities of the SMS-SC.
• SMS-SC, Short Message Service Centre. A node that takes care of the store-and-forward
functionality of messages to and from the mobile station.
• SMS-GMSC/SMS-IWMSC. An MSC that is connected to the SMS-SC. In view of the
fact that such an MSC will have slightly different functions in the mobile-terminated and
mobile-originated cases, it is denoted SMS-GMSC and SMS-IWMSC respectively.
• MSC (optional). An intermediate MSC between the SMS-GMSC/SMS-IWMSC and the
MS will be required when the MS does not reside within the coverage area of any
BSC/BTS connected to the SMS-GMSC/SMS-IWMSC.
• MS, Mobile Station.
• HLR, Home Location Register. The part of the subscriber data that is always located in
the home network of the user.
• VLR, Visitor Location Register. The part of the subscriber data that is connected to the
current state and whereabouts of the user. The VLR is dynamic and ﬂuctuant in the
sense that its data are valid only when the mobile station is switched on and has been
authenticated, and that the register is physically established in the part of the network
where the mobile station currently is.
In the following, most references to the data of the HLR or VLR are given in a context
where it is not necessary to distinguish between the two. In those cases, the term ‘location
register’ is used as a common term.

59
As for the speciﬁcation for most network nodes of the GSM PLMN, apart from overall
functionality requirements, they have detailed speciﬁcations of the interfaces between them.
This is also the case with SMS.
According to the overall requirements of the SMS-SC, it should be capable of:
• submitting a short message to an MS and retaining the responsibility for the message
until the report has been received or the Validity-Period expires;
• receiving a report from the PLMN;
• receiving a short message from an MS;
• returning a report to the PLMN for a previously received short message.
4.5.4
Service and Service Elements
According to GSM 03.40 of September 1990, the SMS comprised seven elements particular
to the submission and reception of messages:
• Validity-Period;
• Service-Centre-Time-Stamp;
• Protocol-Identiﬁer;
• More-Messages-to-Send;
• Priority;
• Messages-Waiting;
• Alert-SC.
The work with and development of the service and service elements of SMS are described
in Section 4.4.3.
The Validity-Period information element indicates the time period for which the short
message is valid, i.e. the length of time that the SMS-SC should guarantee its existence in
the SMS-SC memory before delivery to the recipient has been carried out.
The Service-Centre-Time-Stamp information element allows the SMS-SC to inform the
recipient MS about the time of arrival of the short message at the SMS-SC.
The Protocol-Identiﬁer information element allows the SM-TL to refer to the higher-layer
protocol being used, or indicate interworking with a certain type of telematic device.
The More-Messages-to-Send information element allows the SMS-SC to inform the MS
that there are one or more messages waiting in the SMS-SC to be delivered to the MS.
The Messages-Waiting information element enables the PLMN to inform the HLR and
VLR (with which the recipient MS is associated) that there is a message in the originating
SMS-SC waiting to be delivered to the MS. The information element is only used in cases of
previous unsuccessful delivery attempt(s) due to a temporarily absent mobile. This informa-
tion, denoted the Messages-Waiting-Indication (MWI), consists of Messages-Waiting-Data
(MWD) located in the HLR and the Messages-Waiting-Flag (MWF) located in the VLR.
The MWD contains a list of addresses of SMS-SCs that have made previous unsuccessful
delivery attempts of a message. In order to link an alert message to an earlier delivery
attempt in the multiple MSISDN scenario, the HLR will store each SMS-SC address.

60
Short Message Service (SMS)
The Priority information element is provided by an SMS-SC or SME to indicate to the
PLMN whether a message is a priority message. Delivery of a non-priority message will not
be attempted if the MS has been identiﬁed as temporarily absent. A priority message will be
given a delivery attempt irrespective of whether the MS has been identiﬁed as temporarily
absent or not.
There are two ways in which the mobile station might be notiﬁed by the network of being
temporarily absent:
• The mobile station declares itself absent by sending an IMSI Detach by an action included
in the internal procedures when being turned off. The opposite action would be to send
an IMSI Attach by an action included in the internal procedures when being turned on.
• There would be one or more unsuccessful short message transfer attempts from the
SMS-SC to the mobile station, resulting in the MWF being set (see above).
The Priority information element does not involve prioritisation of the message in any
queueing or handling in the SMS-SC or MSC or by MAP.
The Alert-SC service element may be provided by some GSM PLMNs to inform the
SMS-SC that an MS to which there has been an unsuccessful delivery attempt and which is
now recognised by the PLMN as having recovered operation (e.g. as having responded to a
paging request) is again attainable. The SMS-SC may, on reception of an Alert-SC, initiate
the delivery attempt procedure for the queued messages destined for this MS.

The protocol layers deﬁned for SMS were:

On interface (i) the optional protocol of remote operations based upon X.25 was offered.
However, the SMS-SC and the PLMN operator could agree to use an alternative protocol.
On interface (ii), a MAP operation applied. On interface (iii), the GSM 04.11 applied.
• SM-LL (Short Message Lower Layers). These were layers for all protocols at levels below
SM-RL.
In addition, SM-AL (Short Message Application Layer(s)) are depicted. These were the
protocol layers outside the scope of ETSI.
As mentioned in Section 4.5.1, the decision to base the transfer of short messages between
MSCs upon MAP makes all layers SM-AL, SM-TL and SM-RL reside in the OSI application
layer.

Addressing Capabilities
The addresses of the PDUs at the SM-TL and SM-RL would consist of the following
elements:
• an Address-Length ﬁeld of 1 byte;
• a Type-of-Address ﬁeld of 1 byte, containing
(i) a Type-of-Number and
(ii) a Numbering-Plan-Identiﬁcation;
• an Address-Value ﬁeld of variable length.
The Type-of-Number would indicate if the address was either:
(i) an international number;
(ii) a national number;
(iii) a network speciﬁc number; or
(iv) a short number.
The Numbering-Plan-Identiﬁcation would indicate if the number should refer to (i) the
ISDN/telephone numbering plan (CCITT rec. E.164/E.163), (ii) the data numbering plan
(CCITT rec. X.121), (iii) the Telex numbering plan, (iv) a national numbering plan or (v)
a private numbering plan.

4.5.8
Maximum Length of Message
It was clear from the very conception of the short message service that the design of the
service should be made under the assumption that there would be no transfer of long mes-
sages. If there was a need for such services, they should be catered for by other capabilities
of the GSM system.
But what was the maximum length of messages that could be transferred by SMS?
It became clear that the limiting functional element was the MAP operation forwardShort-
Message (see Figures 4.5 and 4.6) for conveying messages between MSCs. As for every
MAP operation, this was based upon the use of TCAP (Transaction Capabilities Applica-
tion Part). TCAP was deﬁned in ITU-T recommendations Q.771 to Q.775 or ANSI T1.114
as a protocol for Signalling System No. 7 networks. Its primary purpose was to facilitate
multiple concurrent dialogues between the same subsystems on the same machines, using
transaction IDs to differentiate these, similar to the way TCP ports facilitate multiplexing
connections between the same IP addresses on the Internet.
When choosing the simplest scheme of TCAP as a basis for the MAP operation for-
wardShortMessage, one would ﬁnd the maximum number of bytes available for the user
information ﬁeld of the short message by considering (i) the gross number of bytes available
and (ii) the overhead at the different layers of the protocol stack of the signalling system.
The ﬁrst calculations of the overhead budget, from the lowest layers of Signalling System
No. 7 to MAP at the top, indicated that slightly more than 140 bytes would be available for
genuine message information. Then, 140 bytes – or 160 7-bit characters – was established
as the ‘ofﬁcial’ value of the short message length. In Figure 4.7 an extract is given from the
Figure 4.7
Extract from the change request to change the short message length13

change request submitted by DGMH to GSM4 in late 1989 to change the ﬁrst assessment
of 180 bytes to 140. GSM4 approved the request and liaised with GSM1 also to update
GSM 02.03.
As the overhead budget in MAP and Signalling System No. 7 was subject to further con-
sideration, e.g. because of the need to add even further protocol elements to the TPDUs, the
exercise was also carried out after September 1990.14 However, the review of the overhead
budget did at that time alter the value of maximum message length to 140 characters.
4.5.9
Alphabet Available for User Information
With the limitation on the maximum length of a short message deﬁned in the process indi-
cated in Section 4.5.7, it was obvious that one had to look very carefully at the candidates of
the alphabet to be used. Any requirements to allow for a large character set – encompassing
most of the world’s main alphabets – would increase the number of bits per character com-
pared with the number needed for a narrow character set. The result would be a decrease in
the maximum number of characters per short message. The goal was therefore to balance
the need for the most signiﬁcant characters in the written languages of Europe against the
need to keep the character repertoire down. The best compromise seemed to be the choice
made by ERMES for the 7-bit character alphabet intended for the new European paging
service.
The character set recommended for SMS in 1990 is given in Figure 4.8.
4.6
Major Design Issues
4.6.1
General
During the period from May 1987 to September 1990, the four most crucial questions related
to the design of SMS were:
• What transport service should be chosen to carry the short messages in the core network?
• As regards network topology, should the SMS-SC reside inside or outside the GSM
PLMN?
• What interface should be chosen between the SMS-SC and the SMS-GMSC/SMS-
IWMSC?
• As regards the topology of SMS-SC and MSC connections, what restrictions should
apply?
To none of the four questions there was an intuitive answer, and different opinions about
some of them remained for some time. For all of them the decisions that were taken had a
crucial impact upon the feasibility of SMS.

Short Message Service (SMS)
4.6.2
Inter-MSC Transfer of Short Messages – by X.25 or Signalling
Capabilities?
It was clear from the very start that, at least over the radio path, short messages had to be
transferred by the signalling capabilities in order to allow a low-cost implementation in every
mobile station and every base station. This was needed in order to fulﬁl the requirement
that the reception or submission should be invoked even when a call (such as a speech
call) was in progress. However, over some links within the core network, alternatives to the
signalling system did exist.
The general path of transfer of short messages between the MS and the SMS-SC is
depicted in Figure 4.3. The short message will pass one BTS and one BSC only, but
may pass two MSCs. On the links from the BTS via the BSC to the MSC there was no
economically reasonable alternative to using signalling channels of the GSM system. But
on the MSC to MSC link, means other than the signalling capabilities were conceivable.
Several experienced experts did not approve of the principle of channelling user
information – being either on a real-time or a best-effort basis – over the signalling system.
One of the very basic rules of thumb from the POTS15 era was that you should keep an
idle lane on the signalling channel open as long as possible. If the signalling system was
jammed, the users might be left without any service at all.
Thus, viewpoints were put forward to specify X.25 as the means of transfer of short
messages between MSCs.16 In this respect, X.25 was an obvious choice. Everything seemed
to conﬁrm that X.25 would be around for a while as one of the major transport mechanisms
for data on a store-and-forward basis. It had a promising take-up in the market, and it was
the fundamental principle upon which the ITU and ISO were building their OSI model.
Many supporters of using Signalling System No. 7 came from the new breed in the telecom
business: the mobile operator – a company that only provided mobile services and was play-
ing within a competitive arena. The old incumbents resided on several platforms – PSTN,
circuit-switched data networks, packet-switched data networks and gradually PLMNs – thus
being self-contained. Companies of the ﬁrst category knew they would be faced with the
situation where they had to purchase X.25 capacity from other network operators if they
were to deploy SMS on such grounds. Signalling System No. 7, on the other hand, was
‘free of charge’ and within their own control.
After a discussion that spanned a couple of meetings, DGMH decided to rely on Signalling
System No. 7 as the only alternative for the transfer of short messages between MSCs.
It is hard to overestimate the signiﬁcance of this decision. As every GSM PLMN operator
had to purchase Signalling System No. 7 as the basis of the Mobile Application Part sig-
nalling system, an important hurdle was passed on the way to a regional or even global SMS
network. One may wonder what would have been the result if X.25 had been a necessary
add-on to GSM to cater for a small but required cogwheel for SMS. X.25 had its prime time
15 POTS = Plain Old Telephones System/Service, a jargon widely used.

in the 1980s and the early 1990s, but was more or less put aside as an alternative to a data
network carrier when the Internet and IP technology conquered the world in the mid-1990s.
The solution of basing the transfer of short messages upon MAP and Signalling System
No. 7 also represented some challenges. For instance, in later versions of MAP, the headers
at lower layers were increased, thereby leaving less space for the message content (see also
Section 5.2.14 on the upgrading of network capability and consequent reduction in SMS
length). However, this more or less coincided with the steps that were taken by DGMH
to increase maximum message length by concatenation, so the net change for the short
message user was positive rather than negative.
4.6.3
Service Centre – Inside or Outside the PLMN?
From the very origin of the idea of including a text messaging service in GSM, it was obvious
that a network node had to be introduced in addition to the PLMN-speciﬁc nodes for handling
user trafﬁc, i.e. the BTS, BSC and MSC. Many aspects led to this conclusion. In particular,
there was a common understanding that the PLMN nodes as far as possible would be based
on the technology of standard ISDN exchanges and would hence not contain any store-and-
forward functionality. As messaging is tightly connected to the aspects of store-and-forward,
one had to include another network node to take care of that. So the idea of a short message
service centre was contemporary with the idea of a GSM short message service.
The standards of GSM were deﬁned in a period of time when the telecom community
became very much aware of the beneﬁts of dividing the provision of network services and
the provision of value-added services into different domains. There should be a well-deﬁned
and open interface between the two domains, so that players other than the network operator
would have business opportunities based upon value-added services. Blurring the demar-
cation line between network services and value-added services by, for example, including
elements of value-added services in the responsibility of the network operator would only
hamper business development and possibly distort the balance of competition.
There was a strict discrimination between network services and value-added services:
a functionality that in any way inﬂuenced or had an impact upon the bit stream of user
information – like adding store-and-forward or changing the format of the PDUs – was
considered to add value to the service and therefore to reside within the domain of value-
added services.
Thus, from the very beginning the SMS-SC was located outside the PLMN according
to the structure forced on network designers, as indicated above. However, when company
contributions to the standards process contradicted this and included the SMS-SC within
the PLMN as a regular GSM node, there was a discussion on this within the DGMH by
reviewing both the principles and the practicalities of locating the SMS-SC. This discussion
ended with the conclusion that the SMS-SC should be kept outside the PLMN.
In hindsight, it is an open question whether this was a wise decision.
Along with the attention and expectation of the new VAS domain, a working procedure
emerged that one should deﬁne a demarcation line between value-added services and network

68
Short Message Service (SMS)
services. Network operators should involve themselves as little as possible in the business
and endeavours of VAS. In particular, they should not do so to gain an advantage in the
competition in any of the two domains. A regulatory regime like this would yield a series
of positive effects that would apply to SMS as well. It would pave the way for numerous
VAS providers who would start off engineering a series of exciting new applications based
upon SMS.
As we now know, this is not what happened. There were no crowds of VAS providers
putting up their SMS-SCs to be connected to the recently launched PLMNs. To get a short
message service going, mobile operators had to purchase and install the SMS-SC themselves;
very few non-operators – if any – lined up to offer additional or competitive services. And
when some eventually did, lengthy disputes between the PLMN operator and the operator
of the stand-alone SMS-SC on interconnect and other regulatory issues might follow.
It should be concluded that, for the 20 years following the launch of SMS, nearly all of
the SMS offerings in Europe stemmed from SMS-SCs that were owned and operated by
PLMN operators. Some might also say that, for the sake of innovation of SMS and SMS
applications, it might have been better to have left the SMS-SC in the hands of the same
community that was to deﬁne SMS in the PLMN; i.e. to have deﬁned the SMS-SC as being
a part of PLMN.
The considerations above should not necessarily lead to the conclusion that DGMH made a
suboptimal decision when it was free to pick the opposite. Regulatory regimes had already
emerged that led the corresponding delegations to believe that implementation of SMS
with an SMS-SC inside PLMN might be difﬁcult or impossible. The above considerations
therefore apply to the whole of the telecom community – including regulators.
4.6.4
What Interface to Choose for the SMS-SC↔SMS-GMSC/
SMS-IWMSC Connection?
As described above, the decision made for the SMS-SC↔SMS-GMSC/SMS-IWMSC con-
nection was to offer an optional protocol based upon ITU’s and ISO’s ROSE given in an
annex to GSM 03.40.
Retrospectively, the decision may not be judged to be a wise one. The protocol suggested
in the annex to GSM 03.40 was later changed to one based upon Signalling System No. 7.
However, its status remained ‘optional’, which has resulted in several alternative protocols
developed by the vendors.
Obviously, the decision to locate the SMS-SC outside the PLMN cannot altogether be
blamed for the decisions taken in the period from 1987 to 1990 concerning the SMS-
SC↔SMS-GMSC/SMS-IWMSC connection. Even if the SMS-SC was located outside the
PLMN, there was in theory nothing to prevent the bodies specifying GSM to deﬁne a manda-
tory interface based upon Signalling System No. 7 for the SMS-SC↔SMS-GMSC/SMS-
IWMSC connection.

The Technical Design of SMS in DGMH from June 1987 to October 1990
69
However, there are some aspects of locating the SMS-SC outside the PLMN that might
be regarded as giving preference to the decision taken on the SMS-SC↔SMS-GMSC/SMS-
IWMSC connection in 1989/1990:
• There was an unspoken policy to try to keep the access of Signalling System No. 7 inside
the family of network operators. This policy has since been relaxed, but it was quite
signiﬁcant during the 1980s.
• The urge to reach quite tight deadlines for producing stable speciﬁcations for all of
the functionality that contributed to the provision of GSM services made it tempting to
suggest that interfaces to nodes outside PLMN could be subject to optional protocols.
If the SMS-SC had been deﬁned as being part of the PLMN, it would probably have led
to a quick decision in which a MAP-based protocol was deﬁned as mandatory for the SMS-
SC↔MSC connection. Routing might have been simpliﬁed, as much of the functionality
of the SMS-GMSC and SMS-IWMSC related to SMS might have been included in the
SMS-SC itself (interrogating the HLR, etc.).
4.6.5
Fixed Interworking or Variable Interworking?
During 1988 a question came up concerning the routing principles between the SMS-SC
and the GSM PLMN. Did the routing principles have to be very restrictive, i.e. did the
SMS-SC have to be connected to just one or to a small set of MSCs? Or could the SMS-
SC be connected to a variety of MSCs in one or several PLMNs in such a way that the
routing of a short message being transferred between the SMS-SC and a roaming MS could
pick the MSC that would minimise the travelling distance? In DGMH terminology, the ﬁrst
alternative was denoted ‘ﬁxed interworking’, and the second ‘variable interworking’.
DGMH analysed this for approximately half a year. As already mentioned, the motivation
behind variable interworking was to shorten the path that the short message had to traverse
between the SMS-SC and the MS.
The conclusion was drawn at a DGMH meeting in Espoo, Finland, in February 1989.
DGMH advised WP4 and GSM to stay with ﬁxed interworking, mainly for the following
reasons:
• As the SMS-SC will not be able to interrogate HLR and as in most cases there will
be no intermediate network – ISDN or PSPDN – between the SMS-SC and the MSC, a
possible scheme of variable interworking applies to mobile-originated SMS only.
• The beneﬁt by obtaining a near-optimal routing in the mobile-originated SMS case was
not found to outweigh:
 the increased complexity and cost related to variable interworking;
 the problems of combining ﬁxed and variable interworking;
 the risk of barring or obstructing later enhancements of SMS.

Short Message Service (SMS)
The recommendation of DGMH was endorsed by WP4, and 03.40 was updated to cover
ﬁxed interworking only.
4.6.6
Some Concluding Remarks
The above four choices were some of the most signiﬁcant that DGMH were confronted
with during the ﬁrst three years of its existence. If any experience is to be drawn from the
choices we made and decisions we took, it must be the following:
• apply pragmatism – not only principles;
• take responsibility for service standardisation – e.g. by including all entities mainly rele-
vant to the service in the scope of standardisation;
• give priority to simplicity at the expense of complexity.
To summarise, it was a wise decision to use the signalling capabilities of the GSM
PLMN for short message transfer, thereby securing the possibility of a rapid and low-
cost deployment of SMS after GSM network roll-out. It was deﬁnitely wise to restrict the
standards to allow for ﬁxed interworking only. However, it might have been a better choice
to let the SMS-SC be a node within the GSM PLMN, implying that standardisation and
speciﬁcation of the SMS-SC would have been the responsibility of ETSI and later of 3GPP.
That just might have enabled more powerful capabilities within the SMS-SC and thereby
more powerful short message services, provided that the protocol between the SMS-SC
and the MSC had been mandatory and unambiguously deﬁned by the same standardisation
bodies that were innovating the PLMN and the network nodes, i.e. ETSI and 3GPP. Finally,
it must be concluded that leaving the interface between the SMS-SC and the MSC with an
optional rather than a mandatory protocol was not a fortunate choice.
A vision of SMS that one might have expected to emerge already in those ﬁrst three years
of design was to expand the protocol of SMS-SC ↔MS at the SM-TL by adding more
PDUs and making use of compressed information elements in some of them. A straight-
forward example of means to make SMS a more powerful user-to-user communication tool
is the short number option of the address ﬁeld (see Section 4.5.7). The individual short
message was not and is not deﬁned to be able by itself to contain extensive addresses in the
address ﬁelds (such as email addresses in the aa..a@bb..b format17) or extensive address
structures (such as distribution lists). However, using, for example, certain PDUs for this
purpose, both an email address and a distribution list may be established in the SMS-SC
and connected to a short number, acting like an alias to the mobile user. In this way, mobile
users might communicate to a variety of other users that they might not reach by regular
addressing means – of course, still being subject to compromise solutions, e.g. in cases
where the involved communication partners – the SMEs – in their responses might exceed
the maximum number of characters or apply formats other than pure text.
17 Email with the address format depicted above was passed between members of DGMH during its ﬁrst three
years, so the Internet form of email was deﬁnitely already recognised in Europe at that time.

4.7
Final Remarks on the Period of the First Three Years of DGMH
When looking back at a period of designing something new after a rudimentary requirement
speciﬁcation, one often tends to think: ‘Why did it take so long?’.
This may also be the case with SMS by DGMH. In September 1990, after three years
with more than 20 meetings, we had just reached a stage that might be characterised as
a stable overall design. However, such a retrospective glance may often suffer from not
considering every aspect of the outset and its surrounding conditions.
One of the major factors that may explain the time needed for the maturing of SMS is
that, in contrast to most other GSM services, this was truly a new service. It had no other
predecessor in PSTN, ISDN, CSPDN PSPDN or any other type of previous network. Along
with deciding on every tiny little item of technical design, DGMH and WP4 had to discuss
market aspects and make decisions on the basis of these. For most of the other services, the
procedures were in many cases simpler: one just looked for what made the GSM service
similar to the corresponding ISDN service.
It is fair to say that the design of SMS needed quite some time to mature, and that during
the ﬁrst three years of DGMH’s lifetime this did happen. The number of WP4 members
or other GSM experts who attended at least one of the 21 meetings of DGMH during
those three years was close to 50 (see also Annex 4 for DGMH attendance). The number of
people attending the ﬁrst meetings was quite small, and there was no stable core attendance.
From the summer of 1988 this changed. The interest in SMS in WP4 grew considerably,
the perception of SMS as just the paging service of the GSM user gave way to a wider
perspective and a more stable crew of SMS innovators emerged.
I would like to thank all of the almost 50 attendants for their contributions to the SMS
design. In particular I would like to express special gratitude to the following people:
Eija Altonen, Alan Cox, Kevin Holley and Didier Luizard. These four experts undertook
responsibility for major work items that demanded great effort over a period of many
meetings, and they always approached the challenges of SMS in a proactive way. Kevin,
who succeeded me as both chairman of DGMH and editor of GSM 03.40, entered the
DGMH at meeting 12 (Luleaa, July 1988) and stayed as a regular attendant for the rest of
my period as chairman. His close attention to practically all issues on SMS that were dealt
with by DGMH in that period provided for a more than sufﬁcient continuity of the work
that went on after 1990.
To sum up, the ﬁrst three years wiped away the uncertainty of what the contours of
SMS might be like. It vaporised the perception of SMS as consisting of two services – an
essential mobile-terminated one and a not so essential mobile-originated one. From 1990
on, the perception of SMS was that it was a two-way service for which both directions
were essential. The importance of this recognition can hardly be overestimated. From 1990
on, the basic characteristics of topology in terms of network, routing, protocols, protocol
architecture and service elements were stable.
Still, there was to my knowledge no unrealistic assessments either in DGMH or in
GSM4 that the ‘job was done’ and that the present material from the GSM groups could

72
Short Message Service (SMS)
be sent to vendors as fully completed and bug-free speciﬁcations to be used to establish
the production lines.

Work on SMS in GSM Bodies Outside GSM4
4.8.1
GSM 04.11
As GSM 03.40 only dealt with the protocol at the SM-TL layer and the protocol between
the SMS-SC and the MSC at the SM-RL, there was a need to specify, for example, the
transfer of the message at the SM-RL between the MSC and the MS (see Section 4.5.5).
Experts from the L3EG of WP3 took on that responsibility, and in the summer of 1988 the
ﬁrst draft of GSM 04.11 – the recommendation of that protocol – was presented in meeting
12 in Luleaa, July 1988 (see Annex 3).
GSM 04.11 took substantial elements from GSM 04.08 owing to the similarities of setting
up a call connection for speech or circuit-switched data and setting up the signalling path
for short message transfer. GSM 04.11 was designed in a way that allowed for keeping the
signalling path until the transfer attempt was ﬁnished, so that either a conﬁrmation or an
error indication might be returned without once again invoking the set-up procedure.
I would in particular like to thank the L3EG – in particular Jon Reidar Roernes and Knut
Erik Walter – for the efﬁcient way in which they contributed to the swift establishment of
a ﬁrst approved version of GSM 04.11.
4.8.2
Map Operations for the Support of SMS
After the discussion on what transport service to use for the transfer of short messages
between MSCs, and after the decision was taken to incorporate MAP operations to cater for
that, SPS-SIG was asked to elaborate a proposal for new MAP operations for that purpose.
SPS-SIG came back with an operation – forwardShortMessage – that might be invoked for
both transfer cases SMS-GMSC →MSC and MSC →SMS-IWMSC.
Together with the operations required for signalling purposes on the transfer of short
messages, the most important MAP operations related to SMS were:
• forwardShortMessage
• sendRoutingInfoForShortMsg
• sendInfoForIncomingCall
• sendInfoForOutgoingCall
See also Section 4.5.6.
I would like to thank WP3 and SPS-SIG – in particular Christian Vernhes, Bruno Chatras
and Jan Audestad – for the swift and efﬁcient inclusion of the functionality required for
SMS in MAP.

4.9
Other Tasks of DGMH
The DGMH did not altogether deal with the short message service point-to-point, even if
the work with that service gradually consumed most of the time of the drafting group. The
DGMH was also instructed to design the services of MHS access and short message cell
broadcast.
The GSM ambitions of MHS access in 1987 consisted of two services:
• basic MHS access;
• advanced MHS access.
Basic MHS Access was intended to provide a simple access mechanism to an appropriate
point of the MHS system, which turned out to be the user agent.
Advanced MHS access was intended to provide a mechanism that would make the mobile
user a more integrated part of the MHS system, and thereby make the access of MHS services
more easy and less cumbersome than it would have been by means of basic MHS access.
The 1980s was the decade when the ITU and ISO made substantial efforts to establish
a powerful and comprehensive message handling system by the X.400 set of recommen-
dations. The ﬁrst version of the standard to be commercially deployed was the so-called
1984 version. It had an amazingly large repertoire of services and service elements, but in
terms of network nodes it consisted mainly of an MTA (Message Transfer Agent) and a UA
(User Agent). The basic MHS access aimed to connect the GSM user to the MHS via the
user’s UA by access means such as PAD or X.32. The next signiﬁcant upgrade of X.400,
the so-called 1988 version, introduced another network node – the message store. Whereas
the perception of the UA in the 1984 version was that it would reside in a ﬁxed location
and be connected to the MTA by means of high-capacity lines, the 1988 version opened
up for UAs that might be mobile or nomadic and that would have to connect to the rest of
the MHS via low-capacity data connections. The protocol between the UA and the message
store – P7 – was designed on the basis of requirements that it could feasibly be deployed
on a non-permanent and narrowband connection. This became the basic challenge facing
advanced MHS access: would it be possible to align advanced MHS access with the concept
of the UA ←P7 →message store – where the UA resided in the mobile station – in the
1988 version of MHS?
DGMH and WP4/GSM4 gradually recognised two things:
• The scope of GSM recommendations and the scope of X.400 were quite different in
terms of OSI protocol layers. Whereas the GSM recommendations dealt mainly with
layers 1, 2 and 3, the X.400 recommendations dealt with layers 6 and 7. X.400 did not
say much about the layers underneath, except that they should be based upon the OSI
protocol stack, which for the network layer would mean X.25. For this and other reasons
it became obvious that the most convenient way of accessing MHS for a GSM user would
be simply to access a UA located outside the PLMN by means of the most feasible GSM
data services as they evolved.

74
Short Message Service (SMS)
• The conviction held by the telecom community that X.400 was the message handling
standard and service for the 1990s gradually faded. X.400 did not appeal very much to
marketing people at either vendors or operators. It was huge and complex, and some of
the user interfaces – e.g. the horrendous addressing formats – did not appear to be very
user friendly.
Therefore, the DGMH proposed that the intended two GSM recommendations of MHS
access be converted into a technical report describing how access to a MHS system might
be achieved.
Cell broadcast was deﬁned as a service by which a text message fed into the PLMN
was to be transferred to all or a subset of the mobile stations temporarily under the radio
coverage of all or a subset of the base stations of the PLMN.
Even though cell broadcast in the DGMH and IDEG/WP4/GSM4 never drew as much
interest as the SMS point-to-point service, some supportive experts completed work to bring
the service to full deﬁnition, which incorporated:
• the entry point at the PLMN for the text messages to be sent on a broadcast basis;
• addressing the set of mobile stations to receive the text message;
• the message format;
• the underlying protocol of the transfer over the radio interface (GSM 04.12).
In spite of the efforts in DGMH and GSM4, the cell broadcast service never became as
popular as the SMS point-to-point. This lesson may be of interest for future service and
product development, and one of the reasons may be as follows.
Business models based upon broadcast services like cell broadcast of GSM appear to
be more difﬁcult to make successful than those applicable to the point-to-point services.
There are several reasons for that. First, the provider has to cater for some sort of selective
acceptance of cell broadcast messages by those users that subscribes to the services. The
complexity may be further increased by offering some dependency upon the location of
the user, e.g. a user only accepting cell broadcast messages when being in certain regions.
The content must be of such a nature that it is not critical that the user misses some of
the cell broadcast messages that he should have received, e.g. due to being turned off,
being out of coverage, etc. Finally, one has to wrap up the content within the framework of
character strings of approximately the same length as the point-to-point messages. Thus, one
should not be surprised that the cell broadcast has so far failed to penetrate the marketplace.
However, the growing interest in providing public warning messages (e.g. terrorist attack,
earthquake, tsunami warnings, etc.), where all mobile phones in a speciﬁc area can be
targeted, may see a useful roll-out of cell broadcast.

The Evolution of SMS Features
and Speciﬁcations from October
1990 to the End of 1996
K. Holley
Telef´onica Europe
At the start of this period in the history of GSM, SMS was very much seen as a minor
add-on, and much of the focus of the GSM community was on ensuring that voice worked
well and on preparing for half-rate codec so that urgently needed additional capacity
could be provided. Therefore, the focus of many of the reports of GSM is towards
voice.
At the same time, the GSM4 community, focused on data services, considered SMS to
be essentially complete for the ﬁrst implementations, leaving only a few ‘odds and ends’ to
tidy up for the basic design. The baton for chairing the DGMH (Drafting Group on Message
Handling – the technical group responsible for SMS) was passed to me very suddenly. There
were three or four of us in the room, and the GSM4 chairman, Graham Crisp, came into
the room and told us that Finn Trosby would be unable to continue with his services as
chairman. He said that we needed a new chairman for this work and explicitly cited Eija
Thiger (Nokia) and Kevin Holley (Cellnet) as the experts with the most experience. Eija
said that she did not want the job, and so there was only one candidate. Although by then I
had been engaged in the standardisation activity for three years, this was my ﬁrst leadership
role, and there were still many discussions to be had. Often in standards we think we have
completed everything necessary, only to ﬁnd that new avenues open up and all of a sudden
there is much work to be done!

5.2
Technical Improvements to SMS 1990–1996
The following improvements were made between 1990 and 1996. The text is developed from
reviewing the meeting reports and input contributions from the time, along with personal
memories of the meetings and in some cases a personal view of the impact these changes
ultimately had.
5.2.1
Continuous Message Flow
My ﬁrst meeting as chairman was in Paris in December 1990. There were four people
attending this meeting full time, and another seven part time. Several issues were on the
table. Signiﬁcant attention was being paid to future trafﬁc loads, and technical experts had
identiﬁed that the transfer of many short messages to an individual mobile could be handled
far more efﬁciently by sending all messages at once rather than clearing the radio channel
after each short message transfer. This idea is a bit like the postman holding the letterbox
open while he posts multiple letters through the letterbox, rather than opening the letterbox
each time. In the case of SMS, opening the letterbox takes some time and prevents the use
of radio resources by other users, so, in anticipation of future trafﬁc loads, it was better to
promote continuous message ﬂow until all messages had been delivered.1
5.2.2
Multiple Service Centre Scenarios
Some aspects of the original SMS development had been made with the radio paging
community in mind. A radiopager has a single server that sends all its messages, and it
was not necessary to consider multiple servers. However, as SMS ﬂows across national and
international signalling links, it is possible, and indeed these days it frequently happens,
1 GSM4 143/90.

78
Short Message Service (SMS)
that more than one source of SMS (more than one source operator) sends SMS to a given
destination. The design alerts the source operator service centre when a phone is switched
on. At ﬁrst it was only possible to alert one source operator service centre. With international
links and multiple centres needed per operator, it was clear that multiple alerts were needed,
and these were included.
In addition, the inbound routing of a message might be different from the outbound
routing. For example, a message sent from an Orange user to a Cellnet user would go
via the Orange SMS Centre, but a reply would go via the Cellnet SMS Centre. But if the
message originated from a third-party service (e.g. a sports news text service) connected
to the Orange SMS Centre, then the Cellnet SMS Centre would probably not be able to
deliver a reply. So the concept of ‘reply path’ was developed to indicate that replies should
go back via the same route as the original message. The problem then was that the recipient
would probably have no commercial relationship with the provider of the SMS centre (in the
example, the Cellnet user with the Orange SMS Centre). So it was envisaged that the sending
centre would keep track of the messages, relying on the reply path, and reverse-charge the
reply message (Figure 5.1).2
Figure 5.1
Multiple service centre scenario
In practice this feature has not been used in the mass market, and operators have collab-
orated to ensure that short codes work across every network in a given country.
5.2.3
Delivery Reports
Another enhancement to SMS was the ability to determine what happened to a message
sent earlier. SMS was initially envisaged as being heavily used by the dispatch community,
and the conﬁrmation of receipt of a message was seen as important. But it was also seen as
important to identify what had gone wrong with a message. The ﬁrst deployment scenarios
were expected to be like radio paging message centres, where an operator would type in
a message dictated over the phone and submit that to the destination number. In order
2 GSM4 184, 185, and 186/90.

that a message centre operator could advise later if the message was still in a queue for
delivery because the mobile had been switched off, or had failed owing to timeout or to
other circumstances, as well as indicate that the message was successfully delivered, some
additional features were needed to capture and store this information.3
5.2.4
SMS Character Sets
The SMS character set was inherited from ERMES, which provides Greek letters in capitals;
however, there were some incorrect characters in our tables, and we had to make some
changes in accordance with the desires of the Greek operators.4 These last-minute changes
for the ﬁrst implementation phase of GSM made common adoption of the character sets
impossible for those characters, as some manufacturers had already implemented SMS and
would not be able to change their initial handset design.
5.2.5
SMS – an Optional Feature?
Racal (to become Vodafone) pointed out that the SMS capability was deﬁned as ‘optional’,
which would be a serious problem.5 It was envisaged that many manufacturers would omit
to support SMS, which would make it hard for the market to take off, as no one would
know a priori whether a given handset could receive the message. Even the introduction
of a ‘checking’ mechanism seemed complex and expensive to deploy, and so our verdict
was that it would be essential for all mobiles to be capable of receiving SMS from the
earliest possible time. This push for all mobiles to provide support was at ﬁrst rejected by
other groups,6 and it was suggested that the main creation of SMS messages would be by
dictation to an operator over a premium-rate phone number and that the costs for this would
be signiﬁcant – if a subscription was required for SMS, then there would be no guarantee
that the message could be delivered after the money had been spent creating the message.
At the end of 1990, GSM4 sent a liaison including the text shown in Figure 5.2.7

turers to implement mobile-terminated SMS, and later also mobile-originated SMS.

5.2.6
Storing SMS on the SIM Card
In the ﬁrst release of GSM speciﬁcations, the message centre address for routing SMS
messages was stored in the mobile device itself.8 But this meant that a user would always
have to conﬁgure the mobile device, and this could be complex. It would be far easier to
have the operator preprogram the SIM card with the SMS message centre address, and it
was agreed that this would be a useful enhancement in GSM phase 2.
5.2.7
Unacknowledged SMS
British Telecom made some proposals that a new version of SMS could be introduced, where
the messages were not acknowledged.9 A kind of ‘cheap’ version of SMS with no guarantees
of delivery. The SMS community felt that introducing additional options like this added to
the complexity of the system and would also add to user confusion if they could be assured
delivery for some messages but not for others. In the end, this proposal was not adopted.
5.2.8
Memory Capacity Available
It may be hard to believe but initially the storage for SMS was very limited, with some
handsets providing no storage at all and some early SIM cards only providing space for one
message.10 These were extremes, but often the end-user was limited to a low number of
messages, in the region of 5–10. In such cases where the user was regularly receiving mes-
sages, it would be important to delete old ones, and yet there was no knowing how important
a given message would be, so automatic deletion did not seem appropriate. So how could we
ensure that the system could cope with limited memory at the mobile? Some early implemen-
tations coped with this by having a buffer of messages where the oldest read message would
be deleted unless explicitly ‘saved’ (e.g. to the SIM card). But not every handset did this,
and many would send back an error to the network saying that their memory was full. For
the system to keep retrying such messages was the only option available at ﬁrst, but this was
highly inefﬁcient if the user did not delete messages for a long period of time. So we decided
to introduce a ‘memory capacity available’ indication. Once memory became available in
the handset, a message would be sent telling the message centre(s) with waiting messages
that they could retry. This was a more efﬁcient way to handle the issue of limited memory.
5.2.9
SMS Negative Time Zone
It was not always possible to provide a neat way to structure the coding of SMS header
information once the ﬁrst implementations had been ‘committed to silicon’. Unfortunately,

this has led to some anomalies in the coding, perhaps typiﬁed with the Time Zone coding
in the Service Centre Time Stamp. In 1991 it was discovered that the coding for Time Zone
was ambiguous. The original intention was to provide a range to cater for all time zones
in the world at a granularity of 15 minutes. But the speciﬁcation could be read in such a
way that negative time zones (west of GMT) were impossible to code. Luckily, phase 1 of
GSM was restricted to Europe, so there was never a need for a negative time zone. This
time zone coding caught out many manufacturers, and the ﬁrst SMS service centres were
transmitting incorrect time zones for many months, leading to confusion when a clever
mobile interpreted the time zone according to the standard. The previously mentioned
problems with the standard were solved in 1991.11 Some mobile implementations ignore
the time zone, and even today some mobiles use their own internal ‘time of receipt’ and
do not show the ‘time of sending’.
5.2.10
Length of Binary SMS
Another interesting coding issue was with the length of the user data ﬁeld (the actual text
of the message).12 As 7-bit coding was used, the length was expressed in characters and
not in bytes. This was ﬁne for 7-bit messages, but in phase 2 the GSM community wanted
to introduce binary messages too. It made no sense for binary messages to have a length
in septets,13 so we decided that the phase 2 speciﬁcations had to be explicit about whether
the length was in septets or octets. There was obviously no header space to indicate this,
so it had to be governed by the Data Coding Scheme information and we had to specify
which Data Coding Schemes would have their length counted in septets and which in bytes.
At this time there was a review of the length of SMS messages; this was included in the
meeting report14 and is reproduced in Figure 5.3.
5.2.11
Sending to and Receiving from Non-Numeric Addresses
Originally it was envisaged that SMS would be sent between terminals with just a telephone
number, and this was the situation in GSM phase 1. But for phase 2 it was felt to be useful
to be able to send to or receive from text-based addresses as well.15 Again, we were
limited by the requirement to keep 160 characters available, so we had to use the existing
address space of 10 bytes. This effectively restricts the number of characters (encoded with
7 bits) to 11. But this still allows messages to be received from well-known names like
11 GSM4 133/91.
12 GSM4 126/91.
13 Septets are sets of 7 bits – using 7-bit character coding allows the GSM standard to compress 160 characters
(160 septets) into 140 bytes.

Telef´onica. There was even a discussion in 2009 on a podcast about the TV series ‘Heroes’.16
Here, the presenters debated whether someone could really reply to a text message from
‘Unknown’ without the receiver knowing the number. But, of course, that is possible with
the alphanumeric encoding developed as a part of GSM phase 2 in 1991, with the address
set to the text ‘Unknown’. Support has to be enabled in the SMS message centre.
There was a debate at the time about the interaction between this feature and the Call
Barring feature, which can be used to prevent SMS being sent to international numbers,
for example. Also, there are issues with the Fixed Dialling Number capability on the SIM.
But, in the end, these issues were not considered important enough to prevent the use of
alphanumeric addressing in SMS. Today, this is used by some operators for sending out
messages to subscribers, e.g. O2 (UK) subscribers receive messages when roaming abroad
from O2Roaming.
5.2.12
SMS API
Application programming interfaces (APIs) are very important for machine-to-machine or
telemetry applications as well as for machine-to-human applications. Originally it was envis-
aged that APIs would only be needed at the network side for SMS and that the messages
would be displayed at the phone for consumption by the user, and entered at the keyboard
by the user. However, after a while it emerged that there was a need for APIs at the phone
side – to allow remote monitoring applications and control of SMS at the phone by external
devices. The original idea was to extend the interface to a computer terminal by creat-
ing a protocol that would run over a serial cable and transfer messages to and from the

phone. This was ﬁrst discussed in a joint meeting between the technical SMS group and the
requirements group in the summer of 1991.17
5.2.13
Storage of SMS in the Phone
Storage of SMS messages was originally envisaged to be in the SIM card; however, as time
went on it became clear that the phones themselves had much more memory available and
could store many more messages. Phone implementations started to allow messages to be
stored on the phone. This was discussed between GSM WP1, the GSM requirements group
and DGMH, the technical SMS group,18 and it was agreed that, for reasons of privacy, it
should not be possible to view the SMS messages stored in a phone after the SIM is changed.
This feature was implemented by some manufacturers, but after a while they seemed to
lose interest, and there are now many stories of private messages being found and published
because the phones do not lock the messages to the SIM card as originally deﬁned by GSM.
5.2.14
Upgrading Network Capability Reduces SMS Length
In December 1991 there was a challenge to the length of SMS messages as a consequence
of progress in international signalling systems. The CCITT Blue Book overheads had led to
the SMS length restriction of 160 characters, but the newer White Book version took more
overhead, and it was reported that, after upgrading to White Book, the guaranteed length
would only be 116 characters (Figure 5.4).19
Figure 5.4
Reduction in the TPDU length of MAP to 126 octets in the White Book, 1991
Clearly, it would be unacceptable to the market to reduce the length to 116 characters in
the name of ‘progress’, so some other solution had to be found. Fortunately, White Book
signalling allowed segmentation of protocol transport units (signalling messages), which
meant that more than one signalling message would be required in the network per SMS
(only in the network and not over the radio). Interworking between a network supporting
Blue Book and one supporting White Book would be complicated, but eventually this was
resolved and SMS could continue with the 160 character length.

Short Message Service (SMS)
5.2.15
SMS to an External Terminal
The original SMS service was seen as simply for display at the mobile phone, but with such
a complex system there was scope for additional features and functions. At the start of 1992,
a speciﬁcation to allow control of SMS, including sending, receiving and interrogating the
mobile, from an external terminal (e.g. a PC) was started (Figure 5.5).20
Figure 5.5
SMS to an external terminal
The design for this was based on an earlier contribution21, which included the text
shown in Figure 5.6.
The ﬁrst version was based on the standard for control of modems in use at the time, called
V.25bis, which enabled full control of SMS. This was later to be replaced by ‘Hayes’ AT
commands. When considering what this would offer to the GSM system, it became clear that
some SMS messages could be directed explicitly towards an external terminal instead of to
the phone display. And, by extension, some SMS messages could be directed to the SIM card
only. So changes were developed to enable this, including the ability of the mobile to alert
the terminal to the existence of an incoming SMS message. The SIM speciﬁc message func-
tionality paved the way for the SIM management capabilities used today (see Section 5.2.28).
5.2.16
Specifying Service Centre Interconnect to the Cellular Network
Meanwhile, a long discussion started on protocols for interconnecting SMS service centres
with the cellular network.22 The original X.25 speciﬁcation was being supplemented by

other proposals, including the use of MAP. The process being followed was largely the
incorporation of a speciﬁcation developed outside ETSI into 03.40, and 03.40 was becoming
larger and larger. After debate at several meetings, it was eventually decided not to specify
any of these examples in 03.40 and instead to write some simple high-level statements about
requirements on these protocols.
5.2.17
Replace Short Message
Some more interesting capabilities were introduced in 1992, including the Replace Short
Message function. This allows a message to replace (overwrite) one that was sent earlier.23
There are seven types of Replace Short Message – a message tagged with one of these types
can only replace a message with the same type. A message is only replaced if the original
source address matches the one associated with the replacement message. And the strangely
named Replace Short Message Type 0 was also deﬁned – this message is silently discarded
at the mobile (although acknowledged). Type 0 messages can be used to determine that the
mobile is switched on and in coverage and, for example, available for an incoming call.
As SMS has the Alert function, a system can be advised the moment a mobile becomes
23 SMG4 116/92.

available. This has been used in services such as Callback Voicemail – dialling a mobile to
play waiting voice messages when it is switched on.
5.2.18
Detecting Terminal Capabilities
There was a proposal from Detecon to make a mobile detect and reject features to be
deﬁned in future versions of 03.40, to allow a sender to know that the recipient was
unable to process the message properly.24 Unfortunately, this would result in an automatic
(charged) SMS response to the incoming SMS, and for this reason the proposal was not
adopted. However, this feature would have been useful, for example, in determining that
the recipient could not read an incoming SMS message because, for instance, it used a new
encoding method for the message characters (see later about the introduction of Turkish
characters).
5.2.19
Nokia Cellular Data Card
The work on the speciﬁcation for external terminals had started in 1992, but in 1993 there
were several additions and corrections from Nokia.25 Looking back, it was clear that they
had started to implement the protocol and were ﬁxing problems they had found in imple-
mentation. The Nokia Cellular Data Card was the ﬁrst implementation of the standard SMS
control protocol in a PCMCIA card.
5.2.20
Improved Error Reporting
During 1993 there were other additions made to SMS to provide a smoother user expe-
rience.26 One example was a review of the possible error situations. It was agreed that
the error situations were not sufﬁciently handled in the standards and that therefore some
additions were needed so that the user could be informed of the type of error that had
occurred (congestion, problem with the destination number, etc.). Rather than calling for a
second message to be sent to the mobile with the SMS send result, the result was integrated
with the response coming back from the SMS service centre. The problem was that this
meant adding extra data in the lower layers deﬁned outside SMG4. So SMG4 had to liaise
with the other SMG groups, and especially with those working on the network-to-network
protocols (MAP) and radio interface protocols, to ensure that this would all work properly.
The external terminal interface also had to be updated to take this into account. Finally,
there is a rich range of error codes, but these are unfortunately rarely implemented, with
the mobile phones just telling the user something like ‘message failed’.

5.2.21
Receiving SMS from External Systems
In 1993 the implementation of SMS was well under way, and many manufacturers and
operators were interested in being able to connect a ﬁxed network system to the SMS
service centre for the sending and receiving of SMS.27 In today’s world this would have
been straightforward and probably based on XML, but in 1993 there were few precedents for
business-to-business data exchange, and those that were around were based on the packet-
switched X.25 protocols. SMS was relatively new and had many features not seen before,
so a richer protocol was needed. As many manufacturers had already speciﬁed their own
protocol when the issue of standardisation was brought up, it was rather difﬁcult to decide
on only one protocol, and creating another new protocol would have taken a long time and
introduced yet another option. So it was decided to create a technical report that listed all
the various protocols that were provided by manufacturers, and incorporated the details of
them all.
5.2.22
Avoiding SMS Duplicates
As a result of a ﬂurry of SMS testing during 1993, it was discovered that retry attempts for
SMS messages were resulting in duplicates.28 This was felt to be a signiﬁcant problem, but it
was recognised that it would be difﬁcult to detect a duplicate in the mobile-to-land direction.
In the land-to-mobile direction there is a time stamp as well as a message reference, and
this is sufﬁciently unique to detect duplicates (except where the ﬁrst copy of the message
is deleted from the mobile, and then the mobile cannot detect the second copy as being a
duplicate of the ﬁrst copy). In the mobile-to-land direction, the SMS service centre assigns
the time stamp and the message reference is created by the mobile. It was discovered that,
for retries of the same message, in some implementations the mobile was creating a new
message reference, which meant that the duplicate could not be detected at the service
centre. This was ﬁxed by some tightening up of the wording in the standard, but also by
discussion in the committee and letting all the manufacturers know the right behaviour for
the mobile.
5.2.23
Expanding SMS Character Capabilities
In 1993 the spread of GSM was becoming signiﬁcant and the SMS service needed to
cater for many more countries than the original European ones. The ﬁrst input asking for
additional character sets came from Modarabtel in Tunisia.29 The original SMS character
set provided the main European characters as it was based on the European Radio Paging
set. So there was no way to display any Arabic characters. The standardisation of additional
characters took a very long time, largely because the participants in the meeting were not
27 SMG4 155/93.

88
Short Message Service (SMS)
able to discuss and agree what was needed in the non-European countries, as they did not
have the expertise, and there was no participation from the countries that needed additional
characters. One particular problem that was pointed out was that some languages write
text from right to left, and some from left to right, and the interpretation of direction is
very important when taking telephone numbers from SMS and using them to make calls.
Without the required expertise in other languages, it would be difﬁcult to ensure that the
new languages were introduced in a harmonious and inclusive way.
Several solutions were proposed to the missing character problem:
• Introduce additional code page tables – this was felt to be rather onerous on the mobile
manufacturers. Memory was very expensive, and to include lots of code page tables would
simply cost too much. There was a tentative mechanism proposed for switching between
tables, but this was abandoned when it was clear that there was a memory problem with
lots of tables. It was also suggested that changing the language of the handset could
cause the code page for SMS to change, but this would mean that people who speak
more than one language and can receive SMS in a different language from the one set
for the handset would receive strange-looking messages.
• Use the already existing mechanism for adding accents to characters, based on the
T.51/T.61/T/52 standards – this was felt to be too character hungry, as any language
where a signiﬁcant number of characters have accents (e.g. Hungarian) would be using
two SMS characters per displayed character, or in some cases three SMS characters per
displayed character, making a big dent in the original 160 character length.
• Introduce a 14- or 16-bit character set – which could cover most of the characters world-
wide.
As it was envisaged that the work of introducing additional character sets would be an
ongoing exercise, it was agreed to move the character set speciﬁcation material from several
places in the main body, at ﬁrst to an annex of 03.40, but eventually it was agreed to move
this material to a new speciﬁcation 03.38.
5.2.24
Using SMS to Alert to Waiting Voicemail
Siemens introduced the idea of a special SMS message to indicate waiting voicemail.30 This
was based on the Replace Short Message idea, which had been introduced in 1992. The
initial reaction from the group was that SMS already had the ability for a service centre
to send a Replace Short Message, and the text could indicate that there was a waiting
voicemail. But after more discussion it was realised that special handling was needed to
differentiate this type of short message from other types within the handset and to prioritise
such messages in the view to the user. As this was for an indication about waiting voicemail,
in effect a prompt to the user to dial in to collect voicemail, it was decided that Replace Short
30 SMG4 223/93.

Message Type 8 was the wrong name for the code point. Other names such as Callback or
Recall were dismissed because they were names of voicemail services provided by Cellnet
and Vodafone respectively. It was agreed to call the code point Return Call Message.
5.2.25
Which Time Zone to Use for SMS
The Time Zone coding started to present a problem also in 1993 as a result of implementa-
tions and testing.31 Manufacturers were unsure whether the time was supposed to be GMT
or SMS service centre local time (it was supposed to be local time). In addition, the text
referred to ‘two’s complement’ coding and using a bit for the sign of the time zone, which
were not compatible. So the text was clariﬁed. In addition, the original limit of GMT ± 12
hours was lifted to allow for times outside this (e.g. New Zealand is on GMT + 13 with
Daylight Saving Time). Many manufacturers struggled with the correct implementation of
the time and time zone to start with, but the mainstream manufacturers soon corrected any
faults. Today, many handsets display the correct time and adjust for the local time zone set.
But some ignore the time stamp and even display the time the message was received, which
is not very helpful if the phone was off when the message was sent and the message says
something like ‘meet you in an hour’!
5.2.26
Delaying SMS after Phone Power-On
1994 was another year where implementation issues were brought to the standardisation
committee.32 When a GSM phone completes a session on a radio channel, it is required to
perform a rescan of the radio and re-read the broadcast information (which tells the phone
about the network, the features available, the requirements on the phone, etc.). This takes a
ﬁnite time (estimated at around 2 seconds). If during this time the phone is paged, then the
page can be missed. So implementations with SMS were ﬁnding that, when a phone was
switched on, it sent a location update message into the network. This triggered the sending
of waiting SMS messages, but when the SMS page arrived the phone was busy rescanning
the cell. While this was a signiﬁcant issue, it was felt that the solution lay in introducing a
timer in the SMS service centre that could be adjusted. The timer would delay the sending
of waiting messages until 1 or 2 seconds after the alert had arrived at the service centre.
5.2.27
Manual Flow Control
A proposal for manual ﬂow control (stop sending, restart sending, send me all pending
SMS)33 was not agreed in 1994 because there was insufﬁcient support from the SMS
community in SMG4.

5.2.28
SIM Management by SMS
A proposal to use SMS for the purposes of SIM management was agreed to be beneﬁcial.34
There was some concern about earlier mobiles receiving such messages and storing them,
available for the hacker community to modify and reuse, so further study was requested of
the security and service design experts.
5.2.29
Icons for Voicemail Alert
A liaison statement received from the services group suggested that a special icon be intro-
duced on the display to indicate that voice messages are waiting.35 Although in principle the
existing Return Call message coding could be used for this, the connection of the received
SMS to the icon would be proprietary, so it was felt that this would be a useful change.
SMG4 decided to introduce such an indication, called voicemail waiting indication, but also
to include some text in the SMS message for backwards compatibility so that, if the handset
did not support the indication, then the text would tell the user what to do.
5.2.30
Ensuring Proper Display Control via Control Characters
The special control characters CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) have been in use
since printing teletype terminals were used in the 1970s. CR has always meant to return
the print head to the ﬁrst character of the current line (allowing overprinting), and LF has
always meant to move the print head down one line to the current position on the next
line. However, in the mobile case, some manufacturers had interpreted these control codes
differently.36 To stop the text on the current line and restart at the ﬁrst position on a new
line, it is necessary to send both CR and LF. To ensure that the mobile manufacturers
appreciated all of this, some minor changes were made to the wording.
5.2.31
Concatenated SMS
In a messaging system such as SMS there are times when a single message cannot convey
everything needed. For such occasions it was felt useful to be able to string together two or
more SMS messages in a ‘concatenated’ fashion. Some non-standard methods had already
been in use for this, such as ending a message with the + sign and beginning the second
message with the + sign; however, a standardised method that could be seamlessly processed
by the sending and receiving mobile was attractive.37 The header space in the SMS message
was rather limited, and introducing coding for concatenated SMS was impossible without

shortening the SMS text. In addition, backwards compatibility was viewed as essential. So
it was decided to introduce a clever scheme developed in the committee where the SMS
header would point to part of the text of the SMS message as being part of the header
information (‘user data header’). An older mobile would see some strange characters at the
beginning of the SMS message, but a later mobile would skip over these characters and
display the real message. To make life as easy as possible for the poor user with an older
mobile, the scheme ended the binary part of the message with a CR character. This meant
that, if the user data header was short enough (fewer characters than one line of text), then
the mobile (according to the standard deﬁnition for CR) would go back to the beginning of
the current line and overwrite the binary characters with the real text, making the header
invisible. For concatenated SMS the scheme was introduced where up to 255 messages of
152 characters (eight characters used for the header information) could be concatenated.
This scheme has been widely implemented, at least up to six or so messages, and, although
sending more than 160 characters will cost the price of two SMS, this is a useful feature
and is much used in the market for longer messages.
5.2.32
SMS Divert
Diverting short messages from one mobile to another has been a topic of interest since
1994. The ﬁrst attempts at creating a divert capability were with the use of SMS
commands – special SMS messages sent to a service centre for the service centre to
interpret. However, the pre-existing divert commands for other services used supplementary
service *# codes and were sent to the Home Location Register or Visitor Location Register.
If SMS commands were used for divert, then only the SMS service centre that received
the SMS command would action the divert, meaning that SMS messages sent from other
places would go to the original handset. Imagine T-Mobile subscribers who can divert
their messages to another phone for messages received from T-Mobile customers, but not
for messages received from Vodafone customers. Also, what should happen with Type 0
SMS messages (described in Section 5.2.17 above) which should not be diverted? Study
was also suggested for Call Diversion Override and Loop Avoidance. Further work was
clearly needed, but in the end this problem proved too complex and costly to solve for the
perceived beneﬁt.
5.2.33
SMS Message Indication
Earlier, in 1994, we had introduced the capability of Return Call Message which allows an
indication of waiting voicemail. In 1995 we received a request from the services group38
asking to be able to provide an SMS message indication, which could be used to place
icons on the display for waiting voice, fax or email messages. A solution to this39 was
38 SMG4 9/95.

found by adding User Data Header ﬁelds to include the type of message waiting and the
number of messages waiting. This would then allow innovative solutions to be developed
by the mobile manufacturers. This was then left for one meeting. At the following meeting,
concern was raised by One2One40 that strange characters would appear on the front of the
messages with some mobiles, and instead a solution was proposed that used the originating
address to switch on or off the icons. However, this solution was not found to be agreeable
because the originating address was not intended for this purpose and because third-party
voicemail operators had to be accommodated. The meeting agreed on a set of requirements
(Figure 5.7) and for further ofﬂine discussions.41
Figure 5.7
Requirements for SMS message indication
The discussion continued at later meetings, with the introduction42 of the use of Data
Coding Scheme code points to indicate switching on or off of icons.
5.2.34
More on SMS Alphabet Coding
Earlier discussions about the introduction of new language capabilities for SMS continued
in 1995. T-Mobile was an advocate of the standard T.51 mechanism to switch between
language tables,43 while input from Hungary44 suggested more to introduce a new GSM-
speciﬁc code table with an interesting scheme for ‘locking’ or ‘non-locking’ shift into this
new table for speciﬁc Eastern European characters. A ﬁnal decision was not made at this
meeting because it was felt that further discussion was needed.

During the period from 1992 to 1996, GSM was spreading to countries with non-Latin
alphabets like the Arabic states, Iran and China. In China, GSM was competing with CDMA,
and very soon there were hundred of thousands of Chinese users. The then SMG chair,
Philippe Dupuis, therefore thought it was urgent to offer them the possibility of exchanging
SMS in their own language. At that time Mr Dupuis was taking part in the promotion of
GSM by speaking at various conferences in Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing. At one of
these conferences, possibly in Singapore early in 1995, a Chinese engineer from Motorola
in Beijing came to him at a coffee break and explained that the use of Unicode would be an
excellent solution. Mr Dupuis had never heard of Unicode, as there was very little exchange
between telecommunications and information technology experts.
Back home Mr Dupuis made a quick enquiry, obtained a copy of the UCS2 alphabet and
became convinced that it was something serious. At the next SMG meeting we adopted
the speciﬁcation enabling the use of UCS2. A few weeks after, Mr Dupuis included the
information in his report to a GSM MoU meeting, probably in Rome. After this presentation,
three participants from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong came together to Mr Dupuis and
explained that they were very happy with this.
A few weeks later, in Beijing, Nokia demonstrated the transmission of SMS in Chinese
ideograms.
During subsequent DGMH meetings there were further proposals relating to T.51 and
GSM-speciﬁc code points, but in June 1995 a proposal from Motorola45 noted that many
computer systems were moving to adopt Unicode – a 16-bit coding system that included
code points for most of the characters in use worldwide. This would result in the length
of SMS being only 70 characters, but 70 Chinese characters would convey quite a bit
of information, and for those languages with more characters per sentence a compression
scheme would be able to improve on the number of characters per message. This proposal
was adopted in 1996,46 and the topic of international character sets for SMS became quiet
for a few years (See Chapter 6 for later developments). The relevant SMG report47 shows
the adoption (Figure 5.8).

Interworking with Email
Although X.25 message handling systems had been considered as a part of GSM, by 1995
the Internet email systems were starting to become popular and the interworking between
these and SMS needed to be included. A paper from BT48 proposed this (Figure 5.9).
Figure 5.9
Internet mail exchange
This was agreed as useful and incorporated. Subsequently, in 1996,49 more descriptive
text was added to specify how the subject of an email message could be included in an
SMS message, enclosed by brackets or by # symbols.
5.2.36
SMS Between Networks
SMS was becoming more and more popular, but the users did not want to be restricted
to sending SMS only within the network to which they were subscribed. A set of ad
hoc interconnect possibilities had been formed accidentally because roaming agreements
allowed the passage of signalling from one network to another, and this meant that
SMS delivery was possible between two networks with a roaming agreement. Corridor
discussions about deﬁning a ‘proper’ SMS interconnect mechanism were taking place, but
BT provided the ﬁrst paper input50 identifying possible mechanisms, concluding that the
best mechanism would be the one already provided, and allowing signalling interconnect
between all networks (Figure 5.10).
5.2.37
Use of AT Commands for SMS
During the March 1995 meeting in D¨usseldorf, Germany, it became clear that some man-
ufacturers had been developing a set of AT commands for GSM in competition with the
standard V.25bis commands already included in the GSM speciﬁcation. As always with
standards, it is better to admit when an existing document has become less useful because
the industry wants to use something else. In this case the industry really had moved away
from V.25bis control and wanted to use AT commands. Also, for SMS the manufacturers
were reluctant to continue the SMS Block Mode, despite the existing implementations (e.g.

Nokia Cellular Datacard). Instead of allowing the industry speciﬁcation for AT commands
to continue outside the standards, this speciﬁcation material was brought into SMG4. At the
time, the discussion shown in Figure 5.11 took place in SMG plenary.51
Figure 5.11
Use of AT commands
For SMS the AT commands were included in 07.05, which had originally only included
the SMS Block Mode. Two further modes of operation were deﬁned: the Text Mode and the
PDU Mode. The Text Mode allowed AT commands to send characters of the SMS message
as text, whereas the PDU Mode allowed more control over the header ﬁelds and did not
require translation facilities between characters and an SMS message in the mobile. Thus,
the PDU Mode was more suited to a relatively passive datacard implementation with the
intelligence for creating SMS messages in software in a PC. The Turin, Italy, meeting of
SMG4 in September 1995 agreed the ﬁrst consolidated version.52

SMS Compression
The discussion about the use of Unicode to represent characters, and also market input53
about applications needing just a little more than 160 characters, led to the detailed inves-
tigation of compression mechanisms. Compression of 8-bit data was not found to work so
well to compress 7-bit characters, so there was a second proposal54 for a different scheme
to compress the GSM default alphabet. The use of language-speciﬁc dictionaries would
improve the compression ability further, as the graph from this second proposal indicates
(Figure 5.12).

Efﬁciency of SMS compression
The technique to be used was further described in another document;55 however, the
feature was not ﬁnally complete until after the 1990–1996 period (see Chapter 6 for further
information on SMS compression).

More on New Alphabets
Motorola provided more information56 in 1996 about the use of Huffman coding to compress
SMS messages and identiﬁed that up to 50% compression could be achieved. They also
provided a computer program for individual companies to test their own text with the
compression algorithm. In addition, it was suggested57 that mobile capabilities could be
negotiated between SMS service centre and mobile handset, but this latter idea proved to
be too difﬁcult to develop because of the store-and-forward nature of the messages, and the
need to modify the GSM Mobile Application Part for international signalling links.
5.2.40
More on International SMS Messaging
France Telecom started a new discussion in 1996,58 indicating that there are security
problems with the contemporary SMS interconnect possibilities and suggesting that all SMS
should be sent via the ‘home’ SMS service centre. This would have caused a signiﬁcant
redesign of SMS functionality to provide service centre-to-service centre interworking and
been expensive to deliver. In addition, there were other possibilities such as introducing
an SMS policing function in the home network to which SMS messages are diverted. The
cost of this would be met by the operator desiring a higher security, and the originating
operator would not have to make any changes. In the end, the France Telecom proposal
was not agreed. It is interesting to note that, when MMS was developed in 1999–2002,
interconnect between operators used a service centre-to-service centre approach rather than
the direct messaging capabilities of SMS. While this provided a more secure environment,
it meant that MMS interconnect was incredibly slow to take off because it did not work
until a speciﬁc agreement was drawn up and signed. SMS interconnect worked without
any speciﬁc agreement, and therefore it was much faster to market between operators who
already had roaming agreements.
5.3
Concluding Remarks on the SMS Period 1990–1996
At the start of this period the SMS standard was more or less fully deﬁned from a
theoretical perspective. Yet it was not really ‘market ready’ because we were not quite sure
how the market would respond to the features available, and how much more development
would be needed to meet the perceived market needs. Re-reading through all the old
documents made me realise just how na¨ıve we were about what would be useful. But at
the same time we introduced features that are key market requirements today, such as SMS
delivery reports. In development and testing there were many issues that came up, such as
ensuring that SMS is delivered as early as possible without duplication. At the end of this
period, SMS emerged as a strong and essential component of GSM, waiting in the wings
for the text explosion to happen later in its life.

and Speciﬁcations from the
Beginning of 1997 to Mid-2009

Research In Motion
Between 1997 and towards the end of 1998, SMG4 continued its work on SMS enhance-
ments that had begun during the previous period described in Chapter 5. The most signiﬁcant
enhancements were ‘SMS to email interworking’, ‘SIM toolkit’ and ‘SMS compression’.
Under ETSI TC SMG, SMG4 maintained its responsibility for SMS standards until reor-
ganisation to 3GPP took place in 1999. Under 3GPP, a ‘terminals-speciﬁc’ group was
established called TSG T, which comprised three technical subgroups T1, T2 and T3.
T2 was assigned the responsibility for continuing much of the work previously done by
SMG4, which included SMS.
DGMH was renamed SWG3, a subworking group of T2.
The chairmen of SMG4 (and its SMS subgroup DGMH) and the chairmen of T2 (and its
SMS subgroup SWG3) for this period are shown in Chapter 3.
In the transition from SMG4 to 3GPP T2, the main SMS speciﬁcation ETSI TS 03.40 was
given a new document number 3GPP TS 23.040. Similarly, ETSI TS 03.38, which deﬁned
the ‘SMS Data Coding Scheme and default alphabet’, was renumbered 3GPP TS 23.038.
Throughout the period between 1997 and 2009, SMS was continually enhanced, much
of the work being based on the commercial need for improvements and the addition of
features. Although approximately 26 new features were introduced during this period, the
following ones, in chronological order, are considered by the author of this chapter to be

the most signiﬁcant in terms of their value to SMS:
• SIM toolkit data download and secure messaging, 1997;
• SMS compression, 1997;
• Enhanced Messaging Service, 2001;
• Voicemail management, 2004;
• Routers, 2007;
• Language tables, 2008.
6.1
SIM Toolkit Data Download and Secure Messaging1
During the late 1990s, the need for a mobile network operator to remotely manage the
SIM card began to emerge. The SIM card is the network operator’s means of administering
mobile phones on their network.
The complexity, frequency and amount of data required to be managed or updated on
the SIM was small, and so SMS was identiﬁed as being a cost and operationally effective
means of providing SIM management.
The use of this feature is transparent to mobile phone users and in no way affects how
they use SMS. However, its importance in terms of the use of SMS does have an impact
on mobile phone users by greatly reducing the need for making speciﬁc arrangements for
their SIM to be managed that could necessitate frequent ﬁtting of revised SIMs or visits to
their service provider.
Remote SIM management is in wide use today. Two such applications are SIM data
download and SIM toolkit.
6.2
SMS Compression2
The need for SMS compression had already been discussed in SMG4 in 1996.
The growth of commercial services during the late 1990s (which is explained more fully
in Chapter 7) gave rise to concerns about the limitations of 140 octets (= 160 characters
coded by 7 bits per character) for a single short message.
Generally speaking, every single short message has a cost to the consumer, and so, for
commercial applications where potentially large numbers of short messages may be required,
the need to keep the number of messages to a minimum was paramount. See also the section
on billing in Chapter 7 (Section 7.10).
A mechanism for short message concatenation had already been deﬁned in the standards
prior to 1997, which provided a technical solution for those applications and uses where
messages could not be easily conveyed within 140 octets. However, the cost of sending

multiple segments of a concatenated message is much the same as the cost of sending
multiple SMS messages.
SMS had long provided the capability of binary encoding short messages. Such encoding
is capable of containing messages with a high data content (particularly complex numeric
messages) within a single short message.
There were however, a number of applications where neither concatenation nor binary
encoding was a viable solution, and so attention was turned to ‘compression’.
In 1996, Vodafone developed a means of compressing short messages, and TS 03.42 was
created. Test vectors were also supplied to allow implementers to test their compatibility
with other implementations. For those familiar with the history of ETSI document numbers,
they will see that the number 03.42 was originally assigned to the technical report ‘Advanced
Data Message Handling System’ (MHS) TR 03.42. ETSI took the unusual step of using the
same number for the document ‘SMS Compression’ (TS 03.42).
TS 03.40 and TS 03.38 were revised to include the provision for compression.
The compression algorithm, based on a Huffman code, takes into account character fre-
quency occurrence, character groups and punctuation. Typically, it is possible to compress
240 characters into the 160 character space available. The compression mechanism is also
applicable to concatenated short messages, UCS2 encoded messages and binary encoded
messages.
For most European languages, the compression efﬁciency is approximately the same for
each language, but an additional option to include ‘keywords’ is deﬁned for each speciﬁc
language, thereby further increasing the compression ratio.
Compression is an option that requires speciﬁc software in the sending and receiving
mobile, and so its use is largely limited to commercial applications where there is speciﬁc
control over the receiving and sending devices. It is rarely used for casual consumer-to-
consumer general text messaging.
TS 03.42 was renumbered to 3GPP TS 23.042 in the transition to 3GPP.
6.3
Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS)3
During the early 2000s, work had already begun on specifying a Multimedia Messaging
Service (MMS) – a media-rich messaging service that was viewed by some as moving the
need for messaging into the twenty-ﬁrst century and likely to bring about the demise of SMS.
The complexity, implementation costs and consumer costs for MMS were predicted to
be signiﬁcantly higher than for SMS, but so conﬁdent were the protagonists of MMS that
provision was made to encompass SMS messages within MMS to ensure smooth transition
to the media-rich service.
However, there were also a large number of organisations who were not so sure that
MMS was about to replace SMS but who also realised that SMS lacked lustre, particularly
for young users who had stimulated an unprecedented growth of SMS. Nokia had attempted

Short Message Service (SMS)
to make SMS more compelling by developing ‘picture messaging’ which allowed simple
graphic images to accompany short message text. This was a proprietary solution available
for Nokia mobile phones only.
In 1999, a Korean company called Bijitec came to 3GPP with a proposal to allow the
user data ﬁeld of SMS to include coding that would allow simple images, simple animations
and sounds to be included with text or sent instead of text.
Clearly, with only 140 octets of user data available per single short message, the need
to efﬁciently encode images, animations and sounds was paramount in order to keep the
number of short messages and hence consumer costs to a minimum.
Other companies, Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola, came forward with alternative encoding
schemes to challenge Bijitec. All four companies were given the common task of encoding
a range of images such as a bee, a ﬂower, a tree, a simple road map, etc., provide proof as
to how many bytes had been used to encode the image and provide photographic evidence
concerning the rendering of the image – i.e. what it looked like after encoding compared
with the source.
The process of selection was very complex as it required a unanimous decision on a
compromise between the number of bytes used and what was considered to be an acceptable
rendering which in some cases was subjective. (See Figure 6.1).
It was agreed that the Bijitec solution provided the best compromise between coding
efﬁciency and rendering and together with the inclusion of some of the aspects from the
competing organisations the best overall compromise was achieved for the ﬁnal solution.
In March 2000, EMS had been included in TS 23.040. Users were then able to combine
conventional SMS text with pictures, animations and sounds in a singe short message.
For example, an EMS message might be a birthday cake with the tune ‘happy birthday’
playing and the candles ﬂickering with a text message ‘To Sian love from Joe’, all within
a single short message.
Any of these attributes can be predeﬁned in the receiving mobile phone without the need
for the sending mobile phone to actually send, for example, the tune ‘happy birthday to
you’ over the air interface.
In June 2001, the images were extended to include vCard (electronic business cards) and
vCalendar (electronic calendar appointments).
In March 2003, geometrical shapes such as polygons were added, known as Wireless
Vector Graphics.
There were numerous other enhancements to EMS during the early 2000s, adding a
compelling dimension to SMS.
Sadly, as is the case with many enhancements for SMS that have been incorporated into
the speciﬁcation, EMS is optional and, unless the receiving mobile supports the option, then
there is little point in the sender sending an EMS. There is no mechanism in SMS to assess
any optional capabilities of a receiving mobile phone. The weight of market and consumer
pressures usually dictates what options are deployed in the majority of mobile phones.
The term ‘enhanced messaging service’ can give rise to a misconception, and in hindsight
it would have been better to have been called ‘enhanced messaging’, as it is just a way of
encoding the data ﬁeld of a short message and is not a service as such.

Short Message Service (SMS)
In 2004, Research in Motion had developed a more versatile and informative Enhanced
Voicemail Information system using SMS.
Enhanced Voicemail Information allows a voicemail system to convey comprehensive
information to a mobile subscriber regarding individual voicemail messages and mailbox
status. The information aspects are in two parts:
• Enhanced Voicemail Notiﬁcation conveys information to the mobile phone regarding
newly deposited voicemail messages and Voice Mailbox status such as how many mes-
sages, when they were deposited, who they are from (Calling Line Identity), etc.
• Enhanced Voicemail Delete Conﬁrmation allows a mobile phone to maintain Voice Mail-
box status information synchronisation between the mobile phone and the Voice Mailbox
in the event of voicemail message deletion.
Although this feature is an option, it has no impact on interworking between one
mobile phone and another, and so, if a voicemail system offers the Enhanced Voicemail
Information facility, then the only requirement is for the subscriber to obtain a mobile
phone that supports it.
6.5
Routers5
The architecture of SMS interposes an SMS-SC between the sender and the recipient which
is essentially a ‘store-and-forward’ function.
The general functionality of an SMS-SC is described as follows.
Messages are sent from the sender to the SMS-SC where they are stored and the link
with the sender terminated. The SMS-SC then attempts to deliver the short message to the
recipient. If the recipient’s phone is turned on and in good radio coverage, then the message
is delivered. If the receiving mobile phone is turned off or in poor radio coverage, the
delivery attempt fails and the SMS-SC will try again sometime later. The retry periods are
SMS-SC vendor and network operator speciﬁc and thus inconsistent across various mobile
networks. Consequently, the perceived performance by a user may be seen to vary according
to the network operator.
In the event of prolonged delivery failures, the message may be automatically deleted
by the SMS-SC after the retention time set by the sender has expired or the reason for
non-delivery causes the SMS-SC to delete it. SMS allows the sender to receive delivery
conﬁrmation if requested at the time of sending the message. The absence of a delivery
conﬁrmation (if requested) means that the message has not reached its ﬁnal destination, and
so the sender may choose after a period of time to delete the message from the SMS-SC if
such a feature is offered. Usually, for ﬁxed network protocols such a facility is provided,
but for mobile phones it is an option.
The growth of SMS applications identiﬁed that, for some applications, a message whose
delivery was delayed was no longer required. If it were delivered, it could cause confusion
if it were no longer relevant.

The Evolution of SMS Features and Speciﬁcations from the Beginning of 1997 to Mid-2009 105
Take, for example, a parcel pick-up service. A vehicle receiving a delayed short message
may well have driven well away from a pick-up point whose location was conveyed in the
delayed short message.
It became clear that SMS needed to provide a service that exhibited characteristics of
‘forward’ and ‘not store’.
Each message in the SMS-SC has assigned to it, by the sender or by default, a validity
period that deﬁnes the time a message will be kept in SMS-SC pending delivery. For some
applications, the minimum validity period value was considered too long, and so messages
could be held in the SMS-SC longer than the application required them to be. Conventional
SMS-SCs were unable to satisfy the ‘deliver and, if not, delete’ requirement.
Other commercial requirements had emerged relating to behaviour in the event of non-
delivery of a short message. One of these was to forward a short message to an alternative
destination that was available. For such a requirement it should be remembered that short
messages are stored in the senders’ SMS-SC and that there are inevitably various SMS-SCs
belonging to various mobile operators in various countries. A forwarding function would
require every SMS-SC to be aware of the new chosen destination for each short message,
which is impractical.
A solution was therefore needed to intercept the routing information for a short message
in the mobile-terminated leg. That is fundamentally the function of the router.
The router intercepts the routing information, which an SMS-SC needs to deliver a short
message, and can change that routing.
The router was adopted into 3GPP TS 23.040 in 2006 and now, along with the Virtual
Mobile Equipment (VME) described in Chapter 7 section 7.1 provides considerable versa-
tility for SMS applications. A UK company called Telsis has been particularly active in the
development of routers and the VME.
6.6
Language Tables6
At the outset of SMS, the 7-bit default alphabet table, which allows 160 characters to be
sent within the 140 octets of a single short message, was devised to accommodate some of
the national variants of the countries represented in GSM at that time.
The popularity and growth of SMS penetrated countries whose characters were not wholly
or even partially included in the 7-bit default alphabet. The 7-bit default alphabet table in
itself had no capacity to include additional characters, and so those countries were advised
to use UCS2 (Unicode), which was a 16-bit character encoding speciﬁcation that catered
for nearly all worldwide language characters.
Countries that were forced to use UCS2 felt disadvantaged because, instead of being able
to send 160 characters in a single text message, they would be limited to 70 characters
(half of 140 octets owing to the 16-bit encoding). Between 1999 and 2008 there were
approximately six other countries who felt disadvantaged and raised their concerns.
6 Introduced with a Change Request to TS 23.040 in 3GPP document CP-080137, and a Change Request to
TS 23.038 in 3GPP document CP-080223.

106
Short Message Service (SMS)
In every case, 3GPP discussed their plight and advised them to use UCS2 and to adjust
their SMS tariff to reﬂect their reduced-capacity short messages compared to those countries
that could use the 7-bit default alphabet.
The matter came to a head in 2008 when the Turkish regulatory administration expressed
concern about being disadvantaged and took a hard line concerning their dissatisfaction
about the implications of using UCS2.
3GPP once again debated the issue at great length and realised that the ongoing increased
penetration of SMS into countries that would feel similarly disadvantaged to Turkey would
continue. A previous constraint of the cost of memory in the mobile phone was no longer
the signiﬁcant problem it used to be in the 1990s.
3GPP took the decision to provide a solution for additional country-speciﬁc tables.
The concept of escaping to an additional table for characters of international signiﬁcance
such as the email ‘backslash’ (which was not in the 7-bit default table) had long existed.
The Euro symbol was added to that same extension table in 1998. However, that table had
been reserved for characters of international signiﬁcance and had inadequate capacity to
include the various and numerous additional characters from other countries.
The solution to the problem was to extend the concept of the international character
extension table to language-speciﬁc tables.
For some countries only a few characters were needed, as most of them were already
contained in the 7-bit default alphabet table and so a mechanism to escape from the 7-bit
default alphabet table to a speciﬁc language table for a one-shot speciﬁc character was
deﬁned, based on the escape mechanism in the international character table. It is known
as the ‘single shift’ mechanism – analogous to the temporary shift key on a keyboard. The
number of occurrences of any speciﬁc character in that language carries an overhead of
an additional character, and so, while 160 characters would never be achieved, a number
approaching 160 was possible.
However, the language tables also had to cater for those languages whose characters
were a rare occurrence in the 7-bit default alphabet table. A ‘locking shift’ mechanism was
deﬁned – analogous to the locking shift key on a keyboard – to escape virtually permanently
to a table containing the majority of characters used in that particular language.
As is the case for much of 3GPP standards work, consideration has to be given to
backwards compatibility and the behaviour of legacy mobile phones.
Firstly, it was mandated that a legacy mobile phone receiving a short message encoded
using the new language tables should not malfunction. The inability to display a message
in an intelligible readable form is not considered to be a malfunction. Secondly, it was
mandated that, where the single shift mechanism was used to encode a certain character,
the legacy mobile should display the nearest displayable readable equivalent character or
symbol from the default alphabet. So, for example, the Turkish g should be displayed as g.
However, as recently as 2009, Indian language character tables (using both the single
shift and locking shift mechanisms) were added, and for many of those characters encoded
using single shift there were no ‘near equivalent characters’ in the default alphabet table.

The Evolution of SMS Features and Speciﬁcations from the Beginning of 1997 to Mid-2009 107
3GPP realised that, for non-Latin-based characters, the requirement to display ‘near equiv-
alents’ was impractical, and that, faced with the probability of requirements to include
language tables from other non-Latin-based countries, an exception had to be made, but
wherever possible the initial rule to display near equivalent characters or symbols should
still apply.
As with other SMS features, language tables are optional, and, for them to be of true
international value, vendors are faced with having to implement all language tables in
every phone. However, it is possible that phones for a speciﬁc country will emerge as a
cost-effective compromise.
6.7
Other Important Standards Work for SMS
In addition to some of the key enhancements described above, there have been a number of
important corrections without which there may have been serious issues arising concerning
interworking between mobile phones of different manufacture and established SMS services.
6.7.1
Reserved Code Points
There are, in the 3GPP standards, a number of code points reserved for future enhancements
and assignment by 3GPP. Initially, the term ‘reserved’ was taken by some organisations to
mean that they were not used, and so a number of them were used for proprietary means
without consultation with 3GPP.
Left unchecked, there would have been serious implications for future assignment by
ETSI or 3GPP.
Additionally, it was identiﬁed that the behaviour of a mobile receiving a code point that
was reserved or unsupported required clariﬁcation.
In the early 2000s, 3GPP T2 carried out a lengthy exercise examining all the unused and
reserved code points in TS 23.040 and TS 23.038. The behaviour of mobile phones concern-
ing the receipt of an unused or reserved code point was clariﬁed, and the use of ‘reserved’
and ‘unused’ code points was unambiguously stated to be for assignment by 3GPP.
6.7.2
Port Numbers
Around September 2001, the WAP forum requested T2 to assign SMS application port
numbers for WAP SMS applications. T2 subsequently assigned a number of 8- and 16-bit
port addresses to the WAP Forum.

Support of SMS in GPRS and UMTS
During the late 1990s, the need for higher-efﬁciency radio bearers and higher data rates
resulted in the evolution towards packet-switched networks (the General Packet Radio

108
Short Message Service (SMS)
Service) and consequent progress towards convergence with the Internet through UMTS
(Universal Mobile Telecommunication System).
It is way beyond the scope of this publication to describe the detail of either GPRS or
UMTS.
The implication for SMS was that SMS was required to be supported over a GPRS
bearer without affecting the functionality of the protocol layers of SMS as deﬁned in 3GPP
TS 23.040 from the lowest layer to the highest.
The changes to 3GPP TS 23.040 have been primarily concerned with identifying new
node names such as the GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) and the SGSN (Serving
GPRS Support Node) in the text and diagrams.
Over recent years there has been much work done on progressing the support of SMS in
an IP environment and interworking with circuit-switched environments.
The underlying requirement is that SMS functionality as deﬁned in 3GPP TS 23.040
should continue to operate unaffected.
6.8
The End of an Era
By 2004, T2’s work on SMS had become primarily a maintenance task. Very few new
features were being proposed – possibly owing to the fact that there was a belief by some
major companies that the new media-rich multimedia messaging service (MMS) was set to
replace SMS. How wrong they were!
As the pressure grew on companies to reduce travel expenditure, it was decided to move
the work of T1, T2 and T3 to other groups. In February 2005, T2 held its ﬁnal meeting in
Sophia Antipolis. The T2 ofﬁcials at this ﬁnal meeting are pictured in Figure 6.2.
The documentation of all meetings in the period from 1997 to 2009 is included in the
ETSI and 3GPP documentation on the respective servers (www.etsi.org or www.3gpp.org).
There is also a list of all participants and lists of all documents.
TSG T, to which working groups T1, T2 and T3 reported, was dissolved. The responsi-
bility for ‘terminal-speciﬁc work’ was to be merged with the CN (Core Networks) group,
and a combined T and CN group was formed, known as CT. The initial plan was to create
a working group (responsible for T2’s work) called CT2, reporting to CT along with other
CT working groups. However, in view of the fact that much of T2’s work had become
primarily a maintenance role, it was decided to merge T2’s work into CT1 (previously
CN1). The work of CT1 was dominated by the work of the previous CN1 group (which had
always been responsible for core network signalling), and only two or three ex-T2 delegates
attended CT1. In order to ensure that the expertise of T2 was not lost, a group of specialists
from the old T2 group was established, which to this day has maintained a core of expertise
dating back to the origins of SMS in the late 1980s. It is somewhat ironic that a service
such as SMS has so few surviving experts from the pioneering days. The author of this
chapter and the author of Chapter 5 still regularly communicate whenever issues on SMS
arise. Both are considered to be worldwide experts on SMS and are regularly consulted, and
their involvement as pioneers of SMS go back to its origins in standards and the industry.

Early Commercial Applications
and Operational Aspects
I. Harris
Research In Motion
One of the earliest commercial SMS applications, developed by the UK operator Vodafone
in 1992, was to inform a mobile subscriber by an SMS message that there were voice
messages waiting to be read on the subscriber’s voice message mailbox. The voice messaging
platform had a direct automated connection to the SMS-SC and a subscriber could elect by
prior subscription agreement with Vodafone to be alerted of voicemail messages by either a
mobile-terminated voice call or by a mobile-terminated short message. Whilst, at the time,
voicemail notiﬁcation by SMS seemed a useful and innovative invention, delayed short
messages could result in the mobile subscriber being told that messages were waiting when
in fact he had already read them.
The preference for many subscribers fell back to being notiﬁed of their voice mailbox
messages and voice mailbox status by voice.
Another useful early application developed by Kevin Holley while working for the UK
operator Cellnet was to extract news items from the Internet and convert the content to
simple text short messages.
For many years, the use of SMS for commercial applications was constrained by the
impracticality of keying in messages by hand on a mobile phone.
In the mid-1990s, two important developments took place that would stimulate the growth
of commercial applications:
• provision of ﬁxed-network connections to SMS-SCs by third parties;
• provision for the connection of intelligent terminals to the mobile phone.

7.1
Fixed-network Connection to the SMS-SC
The GSM SMS speciﬁcation TS 03.40 had, from the beginning, an architectural boundary
that speciﬁed that any connection to the SMS-SC to any entity other than a mobile telephone
network was outside the scope of the standard. That situation remains true today.
Many business applications require ﬁxed-network connectivity to an SMS-SC because of
the impracticality of using a mobile phone. There was and still is no common agreement
between network operators on the type of ﬁxed network, the physical connectivity or the
protocols that should be used to connect SMS-SCs to a ﬁxed network. Because there were
a number of vendors for SMS-SCs, each vendor developed its own proprietary interface to
ﬁxed networks. and mobile network operators had their own preference for one particular
SMS-SC vendor.
Third parties wishing to offer commercial services across all mobile networks were faced
with having to provide connectivity to every network operator’s SMS-SC, which entailed
different physical connections and different protocols.
The problem was brought to the attention of ETSI in 1995, and much debate followed as to
whether the physical connection to the ﬁxed network and its protocol should be standardised
by either selecting one of the proprietary protocols or by developing a new one containing
all the features of the proprietary protocols.
Common agreement was never reached by mobile network operators and their SMS-SC
vendor to adopt a protocol of one of their competitors, for reasons of loss of commercial
status but also because the level of sophistication of the various protocols varied and some
were unsuitable for some applications. Considerable costs for re-engineering hardware and
software changes would also have been required to adopt a different protocol.
SMG4 concluded that, as there were already various commercial applications operational,
a new ETSI protocol standard would be a waste of time and effort.
However, in an attempt to inject some stability into ﬁxed-network connectivity and restrict
the proliferation of protocols, ETSI published a technical report TR 03.39 that contained the
protocol details from various SMS-SC vendors and advice to future SMS-SC developers to
adopt one of the existing protocols rather than invent a new one. The proprietary SMS-SC
to SME interface protocols were contained in the annexes of TR 03.39 as follows:
• Annex A: Short Message Peer-to-Peer (SMPP) Interface Speciﬁcation (Aldiscon Infor-
mation Systems).
• Annex B: Short Message Service Centre External Machine Interface (Computer Manage-
ment Group).
• Annex C: SMSC-to-SME Interface Speciﬁcation (Nokia Cellular Systems).
• Annex D: SMSC Open Interface Speciﬁcation (SEMA Group).
• Annex E: SMSC Computer Access Service and Protocol Manual (Ericsson).
In the transition from ETSI GSM to 3GPP, TR 03.39 was renumbered TR 23.039. Main-
taining and updating the detail of each protocol in TR 23.039 as SMS-SC vendors improved
their products became an onerous task, and TR 23.039 was modiﬁed to remove the protocol

detail and provide a reference to each of the SMS-SC vendors only. Even that proved
difﬁcult to maintain as company’s merged, reorganised or were dissolved, and so, in 2002,
after Release 5, TR 23.039 was withdrawn.
The numerous proprietary ﬁxed-network protocols were to have a signiﬁcant negative
impact on rolling out commercial applications across various mobile networks, particularly
for those applications that required two-way messaging and for those that required one-way
mobile-originated messaging.
In order to understand the technical and commercial issues surrounding this, it is ﬁrst
important to understand some fundamental aspects of the function of the short message
service with regard to addressing and routing short messages.
A message originating from a mobile phone normally goes to the SMS-SC that belongs
to the originator’s network operator. This is primarily because a network operator has no
means of billing a subscriber that does not belong to its network. The message is held in
that SMS-SC, from where delivery attempts to the recipient are made irrespective of the
network operator to which the recipient belongs. Messages are never sent from one SMS-
SC to another SMS-SC. They are stored in the SMS-SC of the sender’s mobile operator’s
domain until they are either delivered or they expire (or are deleted).
If the recipient of a message is in a different network operator’s domain to the sender
of the message, then any reply to that message will normally be sent via the replying
subscriber’s SMS-SC and not via the SMS-SC that sent the original message. There is,
however, provision to route a reply message back via the original sender’s SMS-SC. That
is called Reply Path. However, not all SMS-SCs support Reply Path, and so the operation
is not guaranteed. Reply Path allows originators to indicate to the SMS-SC that they are
prepared to pay for the reply message. Reply Path is described in Section 7.5.
A commercial application that required just mobile-terminated messages was able to operate
on all mobile networks because it was only necessary for the commercial application to con-
nect to one network operator’s SMS-SC. That SMS-SC would handle the mobile-terminated
message in the same way as any other message it held destined for a mobile on any network.
However, where there was the need in the commercial application for a mobile-originated
message to be received from any network operator’s subscriber, then connectivity of the
commercial application to every network operator’s SMS-SC was necessary, as explained
above.
Take, for example, a bank wishing to offer a banking service to its customers that requires
two-way messaging with a mobile phone that could be on any mobile network.
For ﬁxed-network-originated messages, the bank’s application server would be able to
send messages to all its subscribers no matter which network operator they belonged to
by just connecting the host server to one network operator’s SMS-SC. However, messages
sent from a mobile either as an originated message or as a reply message could only reach
the bank’s application server if the latter was connected to every SMSC in every network
operator’s domain.
The problem remained unresolved for many years until, in the year 2000, the author of
this chapter, whilst working for Vodafone, identiﬁed a solution that was amazingly simple.

114
Short Message Service (SMS)
The solution identiﬁed the need for an intelligent platform in the network that would
behave like a number of mobile phones. Vodafone called the platform the VME (Virtual
Mobile Equipment).
A mobile subscriber wishing to access the commercial application would merely send a
short message to what seemed to be another mobile phone number. Alternatively, the mobile
subscriber could use a published ‘short code’ (e.g. 1234) to send the short message, which
was then translated to a mobile telephone number by the sender’s SMS-SC. Consequently,
no matter what mobile network the subscriber was on, as with a normal short message being
sent to a real mobile in another network, the message would ﬁnd its way into the mobile
network to which the number belonged. The network with the VME was where the message
would be routed to. The VME then translated the destination address into an address that
the SMS-SC would recognise as being a ﬁxed-network address and not a mobile phone.
The message could therefore be routed to the application server irrespective of its origin.
The beneﬁt was that the commercial application server only needed to be connected to
one network operator’s SMS-SC that contained the VME.
This provided a solution to the growing interest for using SMS to vote interactively with
TV programmes.
The use of the VME concept is in wide use today and is covered under the subject of
Routers in TS 23.040.
There were also a number of simple SMS-SC access mechanisms whereby simple data
terminal type devices could construct short messages and send them to mobile phones via,
for example, ‘dial-up modems’. One such gateway was developed by Kevin Holley while
working for the UK operator Cellnet.
7.2
Network Operator Interworking, Roaming and Number
Portability
It is hard today to believe that up until the late 1990s it was not generally possible for
a subscriber of one network to exchange short messages with a subscriber of another
network (network operator interworking), although they could exchange voice messages.
Additionally, although subscribers could use their mobile phone for voice on any network,
they could not send short messages when roaming to another network.
The root of both of these problems was primarily commercial, but there was a technical
deﬁciency in the way that SMS messages were handled compared to speech, which meant
that no commercial solution was possible without technical changes.
Ironically, these problems only existed between network operators who were in com-
petition with each other, and so, when roaming abroad to a ‘friendly’ network operator,
subscribers could use SMS as though they were on their home network.
In the UK, subscribers were becoming increasingly frustrated, not understanding why
voice was not a problem but SMS was. OFTEL (UK Ofﬁce of TELecommunications Reg-
ulator) insisted that the problem was resolved.
To compound the issue, there was an increasing demand from mobile subscribers to
transfer their subscription to a different mobile operator but to be able to retain or ‘port’

Early Commercial Applications and Operational Aspects
115
their mobile number to the new network, including the NNG (the National Group Number
part of a mobile number, traditionally identifying the network to which that mobile belongs).
Again in the UK, OFTEL insisted on a solution.
Technically, all three problems were concerned with identifying the network to which the
sender of a short message belonged and taking action concerning the routing of the mobile
originated short message.
There was no means by which a network operator could bill the sender of a short message
who was not a subscriber to that network, and so any short message originating on that
network from a subscriber who was not subscribed to that network would be rejected by that
network’s SMS-SC. The NNG was the means of identifying whether or not an SMS-SC
would accept a mobile-originated short message. Furthermore, the network to which the
subscriber had roamed had no means of sending the mobile-originated short message to the
subscriber’s home network SMS-SC.
The basic requirement for an SMS-SC to accept SMS messages only from senders who
belonged to that network (or a friendly network) was a principle fundamental to billing and
had to be retained. That principle still exists today.
The solution to all three problems required technical changes along the following lines.
Every mobile network SMS-SC was required to carry out additional checks to allow
routing to an alternative network for short messages originating on their network from
subscribers of another network. The basic check of the NNG already in place to decide
on acceptance or rejection of a short message was elaborated. If the NNG belonged to that
same network, then the short message was allowed into the SMS-SC. If not, then the NNG
would be used to route the short message to the SMS-SC in the network to which the
sender belonged. However, before deciding to route the short message to another network,
an additional check was made to see if the sender had ported to the network on which
the short message had originated even though the NNG identiﬁed the sender as potentially
being a subscriber to another network. If the sender was ported, then the message was
allowed into the SMS-SC. If the sender was not ported to that network, then the short
message would be routed to the SMS-SC to which the NNG belonged, where the check
for a ported number would again take place.
7.3
Third-party SMS-SCs
From the outset it was assumed that the SMS-SC would be under the strict control of
the mobile network operator. This was primarily because the SMS-SC was required to
connect into the mobile network signalling system (CCITT No. 7), which also gave access
to sensitive areas within the operator’s domain such as the HLR (Home Location Register)
which holds subscription details of its subscribers.
In the mid-1990s there was a general growth of liberalisation for mobile services, but,
for network security reasons, the vast majority of mobile network operators saw the need
to retain control of the SMS-SC, their view being supported by the regulators.
However, in the interest of fair competition, some operators such as Libertel in Holland
decided to allow third-party SMS-SCs to be developed and connected to their network which
were not under the direct control of the network operator.

116
Short Message Service (SMS)
In a few cases, in some countries where control over the connection and supervision of
third-party SMS-SCs was not as tight as it should have been, it allowed SMS spam to develop.
It only requires one such SMS-SC to exist to allow SMS spam to be sent to every mobile
subscriber in every network.
Where that has occurred, mobile network operators have had to block all SMS trafﬁc from
the network containing the rogue SMS-SC, hence curtailing legitimate use as a consequence.
Clearly, spam can be sent from any device capable of sending a short message, such as
a mobile phone, but it is more difﬁcult to target large numbers of recipients from a mobile
phone and billing usually controls such trafﬁc.
Most mobile network operators procure their SMS-SC from one supplier, as there are
many design and performance aspects of an SMS-SC that are outside the scope of 3GPP
standards but speciﬁc to the business offering from a particular mobile network operator.
There may also be a direct bearing on the quality of service offered by a network operator
where there are multiple vendors, and it is essential that a network operator is able to provide
a comparable quality and level of service.
A third-party SMS-SC is somewhat outside the network operator’s control, and so users
may experience inconsistent levels of service quality for which they often see the network
operator as being responsible.
Any SMS-SC enhancements that affect the network operation of SMS have to be incor-
porated into every SMS-SC. An example of this is the solution to the network operator
interworking, roaming and number portability problem described earlier. Where there are
third-party SMS-SCs, control over the changes to their product can be difﬁcult, and hence
there is a risk of jeopardising SMS.
Rather than allow third-party SMS-SCs, it is far better to encourage the development
of applications by third parties and connect them to the SMS-SC that is under the direct
control of the network operator. Such is the situation in the UK and most other countries.
7.4
Intelligent Terminal Connections to Mobile Phones
Some early SMS commercial applications required client software intelligence at the mobile
phone. Clearly, it was impractical to embed such software for the numerous applications in
the mobile phone, as every phone would have to be speciﬁc for an application or engineered
for a choice of applications.
One of the earliest of these applications was for vehicle tracking (e.g. parcel deliv-
ery/collection). Vehicles ﬁtted with GPS were required to send their position periodically
via SMS, which necessitated an interface to be developed to a mobile phone to allow the
attachment of an external intelligent programmable device such as the Psion organiser or
the Palm. For some applications, bespoke hardware was developed.
Because there was no standard interface or protocol, the matter was brought to the
attention of ETSI SMG4, who felt that an external interface to a mobile phone should be
standardised. ETSI SMG4 created TS 07.05 (see Chapter 5), which deﬁned three alternative
protocols operating over an asynchronous V24 interface:
• Block mode;

Early Commercial Applications and Operational Aspects
117
• Text mode;
• PDU mode.
The Block mode is a binary protocol and is suitable for software-driven applications. It
includes error protection and is suitable where there is a risk of interference between the
application terminal and the mobile phone.
The Text mode is an AT-command-based protocol and is suitable for a human interface
and has no error protection.
The PDU (Protocol Data Unit) mode is a character-based but hex-encoded protocol suit-
able for software-driven applications and uses AT commands.
The combination of an intelligent terminal connected to the mobile phone and ﬁxed-
network connectivity opened up the opportunity for many commercial opportunities. One
such application is vehicle tracking for parcel collection and delivery.
7.5
SMS Keyboard Text Entry
The drive for smaller mobile phones into the late 1990s and hence smaller keypads made
SMS text entry increasingly difﬁcult. Given the dramatic increase in the use of SMS,
attention turned to easing the task of entering short message text.
One particular company called Tegic, developed a text predictive algorithm whereby
software would predict from the start of a word string what the word was likely to be
and thus save the effort of entering characters. Tegic brought their idea to ETSI SMG4,
but SMG4 felt that this was beyond the scope of standards as it was an implementation
matter. Tegic embarked on a campaign to lobby mobile vendors and eventually succeeded
in making a signiﬁcant market penetration. Today there are several predictive algorithm
implementations – some mobile vendor speciﬁc.
By the late 1990s, SMS was becoming increasingly popular among the younger popu-
lation. Many youngsters were already familiar with Internet chat rooms where the use of
‘shorthand text’ such as CUL8TR (‘see you later’) was commonplace. The ‘shorthand text’
found its way into SMS messaging. Probably unknowingly, they had also stumbled on an
incidental means of keeping the number of characters in a short message to a minimum and
in so doing avoided higher charges than they may have incurred for concatenated messages.
The ‘fun’ attraction of SMS using ‘shorthand text’ was a major factor in the explosion
of SMS text messaging towards the end of the 1990s.
7.6
SMS to Fax and SMS to Email
The most signiﬁcant growth of SMS in the mid- to late 1990s was conventional subscriber
mobile-to-mobile messaging. However, it was realised that there were other established
technologies such as fax and email that were capable of terminating the data content of a
short message, in that both technologies were capable of displaying text.
Vodafone developed an SMS-to-fax service that provided one-way messaging from a
mobile phone to a fax machine. Sending from a fax machine to SMS was never pursued,

118
Short Message Service (SMS)
as it required a complex scanning process to convert facsimile to text. Commercially, the
success of the SMS-to-fax service was somewhat limited, as the popularity of fax began
to give way to the use of email in both mobile and private networks for versatile two-way
messaging.
Email seems ideally suited to interworking with SMS. However, there are some funda-
mental differences, as will be explained.
Short messages predominantly use destination addresses that are numeric, and, although
there is provision in SMS addressing to use alphanumeric addresses, the length of such
an address is limited and cannot contain non-alphanumeric characters. Internet addresses
are of the form lucy@wondernet.com, and SMS cannot handle such an address in its
destination address ﬁeld.
Much work was done in TS 03.40 in the late 1990s to make provision in the mobile
phone to indicate to the SMS-SC that a message was to be sent to an email address. This
is described more fully in Chapter 5.
The intended destination email address had to be embedded into the 160 character user
data ﬁeld of the short message. The format of the email address and its position in the
body of the short message had to be explicit, otherwise the SMS-SC would not be able to
discriminate between normal text and an Internet address. The email address also consumed
a portion of the available space for short message text, and so less than 160 characters were
achievable per single short message.
For concatenated short messages, the email address had to be present in every short
message segment because it is possible for segments to go missing.
For mobile-terminated messages sent from an email source, it is necessary for some
intelligence attached to the Internet to realise that the destination address is actually intended
for a mobile phone, and so translation of the Internet address to a mobile telephone number
is necessary.
Given the above complications of email interworking, it is not surprising that the service
has had a limited success.
Around 1995, Vodafone commenced a project for two-way interworking between SMS
and email. Other companies such as SendIt, Psion and Purple Software had also been
involved in similar projects, and so Vodafone worked jointly with these other companies
to develop an SMS-to-email service known as Vodafone:m@il. As part of that project, the
need for an additional speciﬁc code point in the TS 03.40 Protocol Identiﬁer value arose
and was adopted into TS 03.40 in May 1995.
The Vodafone:m@il project brought a commercial reality to the fundamental differences
between SMS and email:
• Incompatible addressing. SMS is a numeric-based addressing system, whereas email is a
name-based system.
• Content discrepancies. SMS is basically limited to 160 character messages, whereas email
has almost no bounds on message size. SMS, through EMS, is capable of handling simple
graphics animations and sounds, whereas email can handle very complex images and
sounds.

Early Commercial Applications and Operational Aspects
119
Figure 7.1
Souvenirs of Vodafone:m@il
• Tarifﬁng. SMS messages are chargeable, whereas email messages are ostensibly free.
SMS messages are normally charged to the sending party. It is difﬁcult for the mobile-
terminated leg of a short message to be charged to the sender because there is no
contractual link or agreement with the sender, although interoperator accounting can bal-
ance message handling costs. Free email-originated messages would cause an explosion
in mobile-terminated message trafﬁc, for which there is no easy revenue path.
Vodafone:m@il was ﬁnally abandoned a few years later owing to the impracticalities
described above. Some souvenirs of the project are shown in Figure 7.1.
7.7
Two-way Real-time Messaging Applications
There have been numerous applications developed that have attempted to use SMS for
two-way real-time messaging.
SMS is not particularly suited to such applications because of the risk of delays usually
brought about by the receiving mobile being in less than perfect radio coverage.
Messages sent to a ﬁxed-network termination have a very high probability of delivery on
the ﬁrst attempt, i.e. within a few seconds of it having been sent from a mobile. Messages
sent to a mobile phone, however, may experience delays of many tens of seconds or even
minutes and, in extreme cases, hours. The SMS-SC retry schedules in the event of a delivery
failure are outside the scope of ETSI/3GPP speciﬁcations and so will vary between different
networks, making applications vary in timeliness of delivery across different networks.

120
Short Message Service (SMS)
Despite the ‘store-and-forward’ characteristic of SMS, a mobile phone in good radio
coverage can give the appearance of a real-time two-way messaging service. However,
mobile-terminated short messages are, in general, subject to a higher delivery delay than
mobile-originated short messages terminating at a ﬁxed-network entity. This is primarily
due to the receiving mobile being in less than ideal radio coverage, which can result in
non-delivery on the ﬁrst attempt and sometimes non-delivery on subsequent re-attempts. In
certain cases, mobile-terminated short messages may never be delivered. Hence, for services
relying on two-way real-time SMS messaging, the performance cannot be guaranteed.
One two-way service that has recently gone into commercial service in 2009 in the UK is
known as ‘eSMS’. This is an emergency SMS service for the hearing impaired. However, it
relies on human intervention at a central point to convert the mobile originated short message
text into voice for onward routing to the emergency response service and vice versa for reply
messages. Despite concerns over delays, this is a pragmatic case of something is better than
nothing and the expectations of the service are made clear. The service is intended for those
hearing impaired persons choosing to register for eSMS and not for use by the general public.
It has been suggested that SMS could be used for the broadcasting of public warnings
such as earthquake, ﬂood, terrorist attack, etc. Such warning messages are required to be
sent to speciﬁc mobile phones in a particular geographic area.
SMS has two signiﬁcant problems for such applications:
• Firstly, SMS has no inherent location information. The location of a particular mobile
phone can be obtained by independent means, but the process is cumbersome and time
consuming, particularly when trying to identify all mobile phones in a particular area that
are on different mobile networks.
• Secondly, SMS is a ‘point-to-point’ service, and consequently every short message to
every subscriber from each network operator would be sent sequentially, working down
the list of mobile recipients, as opposed to concurrent delivery. As a consequence, there
may be a signiﬁcant time difference between the ﬁrst mobile subscriber receiving a
message and the last subscriber receiving the same message.
Far better technologies exist, such as the Cell Broadcast service (historically and originally
called Short Message Service Point-to-Multipoint).
7.8
Performance
Network operators have a vested interest in monitoring the quality of service for all of their
services in order to identify potential problems and to investigate problems that affect their
quality of service.
Most SMS-SCs have inbuilt SMS records that show when a particular message arrived in
the SMS-SC, when it was delivered, the mobile numbers of the sender and the recipient, etc.
Analysis by Vodafone of their short message service in the late 1990s gave the following
results, which were, at the time, consistent with the results of other UK network operators:

Early Commercial Applications and Operational Aspects
121
• The time between a message being sent from a mobile phone to the time that message was
received at the recipient’s mobile was typically 6–8 seconds. Approximately 1–2 seconds
of this was attributed to message storage in the SMS-SC.
• The time between a message being sent from a mobile to that same mobile receiving a
delivery conﬁrmation was typically 10–12 seconds. (Note that the indication of ‘message
sent’ on most phones is only conﬁrmation that the message has reached the SMS-SC and
NOT that it has reached the recipient’s mobile).
• Typically, 38% of messages were not delivered on the ﬁrst attempt to mobile phones,
primarily due to the receiving mobile being out of coverage, in poor coverage or turned off.
However, 98% of all messages were delivered on the ﬁrst attempt where the destination
was a ﬁxed-network termination.
• Typically, 98% of messages were eventually delivered, provided that the retention time
for the short message was set to 3 days.
Although it has not been possible to obtain the latest statistics, it is unlikely that the
above performance will have changed signiﬁcantly although there may well have been an
improvement in the 38% ﬁgure for the ﬁrst delivery attempt of mobile-terminated messages
owing to improved mobile radio coverage.
The SMS-SC records provided an insight into a user’s experience of the short message
service but could not provide quality-of-service measurements, as the source and destination
devices were uncontrolled.
To address this problem, Vodafone developed an automated performance measuring sys-
tem that deployed mobiles around the UK that were connected to intelligent terminals
which allowed those mobile phones to report back their perception of what had happened
and allowed correlation with the records of messages at the sending end.
Each day, thousands of records were analysed, giving a real-time performance indication
of the behaviour of Vodafone’s entire short message service. Hence, when problems were
reported from subscribers, Vodafone was able to check the performance of the SMS network
at that time and, if necessary, isolate the problem as being speciﬁc to the subscriber or the
application.
7.9
SMS Trafﬁc Growth
There was no precedence for specifying the message handling capacity for the ﬁrst SMS-SCs
that were developed around 1992. SMS was a new service whose use was unquanti-
ﬁed.
Vodafone’s SMS-SC was developed by SEMA – a company in Reading, UK, close to
Vodafone’s headquarters in Newbury. Because of some architectural deviations from the TS
03.40 speciﬁcation, Vodafone called their SMS-SC a Text Messaging Centre (TMC). It was
not foreseen that the term ‘text messaging’ would become a ubiquitous term for SMS.
The capacity for message handling by the TMC was based on the experience of voicemail,
which, given the relatively small number of mobile users at that time, was 10 messages per
second across the whole Vodafone network.

122
Short Message Service (SMS)
As the number of mobile phone users increased, so did the use of SMS, and during
the early to mid-1990s Vodafone’s TMC message handling capability increased from 10
messages per second to several 100 messages per second. By then there were about 45
billion short messages being sent per month – mainly in Europe.
In the late 1990s, SMS trafﬁc growth was virtually exponential, serious redimension-
ing SMS-SC message handling capability became necessary and network resilience and
redundancy were needed. SMS-SCs were designed with faster processing capable of han-
dling many thousands of messages per second, but the limitation was not in the processor
but in the connectivity to the mobile network. This necessitated SMS network topogra-
phy re-thinking to allow deployment of large numbers of SMS-SCs to cope with trafﬁc
growth.
There are many facts and ﬁgures available within a network operator’s domain that give
SMS trafﬁc statistics, but these are not normally publicly available. Sufﬁce it to say that,
in the current-day ﬁgures, the number of SMS messages being sent worldwide per year is
measured in hundreds of billions. This is discussed more fully in Chapter 8.
7.10
Billing
The realisation in the late 1980s that SMS was destined to become an operational service
resulted in a discussion among network operators on how much should be charged to
subscribers and how this should be done.
There was no model of any other service on which to set a tariff.
A memorandum of understanding was set up among mobile network operators
to address the issue of ‘billing’. It was known as MoU BARG (Memorandum of
Understanding – Billing Accounting Regulatory Group).
This group formulated agreements among mobile network operators on how SMS was to
be billed and tariffed.
The initial concept was to treat SMS like any other switched-circuit voice call, i.e. the
originator would be charged. The SMS-SC was in the sender’s domain, and so it was a
simple matter to extract information from the originator’s SMS-SC concerning the identity
of the subscriber who sent the short message. Only subscribers to a particular network
would be allowed to send short messages to that network’s SMS-SC. Other subscribers’
short messages sent to that SMS-SC would be rejected.
The delivery of a short message from the SMS-SC to the recipient meant that, where the
recipient was on a different network to the sender, the recipient’s network was required to
handle the short message. However, the recipient’s network was not designed to monitor
the detail of short messages other than the mobile network from where the short message
had been sent, and in any case there was no commercial billing agreement between the
recipient’s network operator and the sender of a short message if the sender was on another
network. To put it simply, senders could not be billed by anybody other than their own
network operator.
The concept of inter-network accounting was developed: the number of short messages
that a network received for delivery from another network operator was tallied, and an

Early Commercial Applications and Operational Aspects
123
agreement was reached between them to balance the cost of handling the delivery of short
messages.
Apart from the basic concept of billing the sender, arrangements were made for bulk
billing – mainly for commercial operations where preferential rates applied to a sender who
sent high numbers of short messages.
SMS value-added services were also developed, where premium rates for certain messages
applied.
The cost of a mobile-originated short message in the UK was set at 10 pence around
1990.
Today, there are numerous packages allowing ﬂexibility for SMS users, e.g. free SMS
messages rolled in with a package agreement for voice services.
Occasionally, the question is asked whether a short message tariff should be based on the
number of characters sent in a short message. The reality is that the unit size of 160 characters
is fundamental to the technology of SMS, and it costs just the same for a network operator
to handle a message of one character as it does to handle a message of 160 characters.
7.11
The Content Provider Access (CPA) Model Deployed in Norway1
Mobile network operators in Norway agreed around 2000 to adopt a model for offering
content providers the opportunity to connect to the operators’ short message service. Of the
most important characteristics of the model, the following two should be mentioned:
1. The content provider is granted an access number to be used by the end-users for access-
ing their content. This number is the same, irrespective of which mobile operator holds
the end-user as a customer.
2. The mobile operator bills the end-user for both air time and content, preferably in an
integrated way to make it more easy for the end-user to perceive the total expenditure.
The operator then transfers a certain percentage of the content fee at a later stage to
the content provider. The percentage is an essential part of the deal between the content
provider and the mobile operator. The operators have agreed to a common price structure.
It is a common conclusion in the mobile community in Norway that the great success of
the CPA model in the Norwegian market is in particular due to the two aspects mentioned
above.
CPA has been extended also to other access methods, such as WAP.
7.12
SMS in 2009
In 2009, SMS remains a signiﬁcant revenue earner for mobile network operators and is as
popular as ever for mobile subscribers.

Short Message Service (SMS)
The attention in 3GPP standards bodies has recently been turned towards the next stage
of evolution for the infrastructure of mobile telephony, LTE (Long-Term Evolution).
It is beyond the scope of this publication to enter into the detail of LTE.
What is of signiﬁcance is that work has long been under way in 3GPP to adapt SMS,
which was originally designed for circuit-switched bearers, to packet-switched bearers and
interworking with the Internet.
As recently as August 2009, discussions were under way in 3GPP concerning SMS-only
mobile phones for LTE.
SMS remains a unique service, and the drive to support SMS for LTE is a testimony
to the continued popularity of SMS today among its users and its commercial viability for
those responsible for providing the service.

Global Market Development
F. Hillebrand
Hillebrand & Partners
The widest use of SMS is for the person-to-person exchange of short messages. This chapter
focuses on this aspect of SMS.
8.1
The Creation of a Large Base of Mobiles and the Global SMS
Infrastructure
After the completion of the standardisation, all operators were bound to the commitment
from the GSM memorandum of understanding to implement essential services such as SMS.
Therefore, they included the requirement to support SMS point-to-point in the procurement
activities for their networks and mobiles. This created a wave of demand for SMS equip-
ment. Thus, every mobile station supplier and every systems supplier had to develop SMS
functionalities.
The ﬁrst portable telephones available in 1991 and 1992 did not support SMS.
However, hand portables started to support SMS point-to-point mobile-terminated in
1993. The pioneers were Ericsson, Nokia, Orbitel and Siemens. All mobiles supported
the mobile-terminated service from 1994 onwards, and the mobile-originated service from
1996 onwards.
In the GSM network, a new server, the SMS-SC, was required. The rest of the functions
in the network were embedded in protocols needed for telephony (MS/BS protocols and
MAP). The functions in MS/BS protocols and MAP were available in the systems of all
system manufacturers from the end of 1994 onwards. For the development of SMS-SCs, a
number of dedicated companies appeared, in addition to system manufacturers. SMS-SCs
were available from Aldiscon Information Systems, CMG Computer Management Group,
Ericsson, Nokia Cellular Systems and SEMA Group. This is a remarkably broad range of
Short Message Service (SMS)

suppliers for a totally new system element in a market that was relatively small at the time.
There were some early acceptance tests already in 1992, but in most networks these tests
took place in 1993–1995. The procurement and test activities led to the availability of SMS
in practically all GSM networks from 1995 onwards.
International roaming was available from 1995 onwards.
National interworking for message transport between competing networks in a coun-
try lasted until 1996 (in exceptional cases, until 1997) owing to protracted commercial
negotiations. When SMS could be sent between networks, this removed the last barrier to
widespread acceptance.
8.2
First Use of SMS by Network Operators
In 1991, the scepticism about SMS was summed up by the director of one mobile network
operator in the words: ‘Why would anybody want to send one of these messages when they
can talk to them?’. It is fair to say that, in 1992, when the ﬁrst short message was sent,
nobody foresaw that SMS would become the most important revenue earner next to speech
for the following 18 years and perhaps beyond. A message service that was limited to 160
characters and that had to be keyed in on a mobile phone keypad using ﬁngers and thumbs,
and whose message delivery could not be guaranteed, was hardly likely to attract much
attention.
As the new Europe-wide mobile telephony was so exciting, nobody marketed SMS in a
systematic way. In 1993, some operators used SMS to notify users of received voicemails in
order to trigger new calls by their customers to the persons who had left the voicemail. Other
operators saw no use for it. They left the functionality in the network without promoting it
and without charging for it.
8.3
How SMS Was Discovered by Young People and Became a Part
of the Youth Culture and Widely Accepted
Starting in the mid-1990s, youngsters in many countries could afford mobiles. They realised
that SMS was a simple and cheap way to communicate with their friends. They loved this
possibility, and, as it was not known to grown-ups, messages could be sent secretly; for
instance, underneath the desk at school, e.g. C U 2 Nite (‘see you tonight’) or C U L8R
(‘see you later’). This SMS language shorthand was derived from abbreviations used in
Internet chat rooms. It was used to economise on the use of characters. It made SMS ‘fun’
and created a community feeling. Young people developed an admirable skill to input SMS
characters by the standard telephone keypads. Thus, neither the limitation of 160 characters
nor the clumsy inputting method was disadvantageous to SMS development.
As SMS was available everywhere and in every mobile, it became part of the youth
culture in all GSM countries. In many countries a substantial part of the total SMS revenue
comes from young people using the service as a message and chat carrier. This started back
when the user interface for SMS was quite poor. There seems to be light years of distance

Global Market Development
127
between the skills and interest in SMS of a youngster (12–20 years old) and those of a
lady above 50. Unexpectedly large trafﬁc volumes appeared in all networks. Those network
operators who had offered SMS free of charge in the beginning had difﬁculties in getting
their customers to accept charging.
Today, SMS point-to-point services are used very widely by people of all ages. Grandpar-
ents were persuaded by their grandchildren who had received a mobile as a gift to exchange
messages with them.
The high hopes that SMS as a value-added service (VAS) would attract a lot of competing
VAS operators have not become reality.
8.4
SMS Has Become the Leading Mobile Messaging Service and
Will Stay in the Lead in the Foreseeable Future
8.4.1
Global SMS Trafﬁc and Revenues in 2008
It is not possible to obtain consolidated global ﬁgures of the total message number,
as not all operators report their ﬁgures. Therefore, three different approaches will be
presented.
8.4.1.1
Model 1: a Simple Calculation
Table 8.1 presents ﬁgures on the average number of messages per user and month.1
This allows a cautious estimate of the total trafﬁc and revenue:
• Trafﬁc: 3.55 billion users × 70 messages per user and month results in 250 billion short
messages per month. This results in 3 trillion short messages per year.
• Revenue: 3 trillion short messages per year × ¤0.03 per short message2 results in a
revenue of ¤90 billion per year.

Model 2: Research by a Market Research Firm
Portio Research estimates $US 89 billion SMS revenue for 2008 generated by 3.5 trillion
short messages in 2008. They forecast a rise to $US 100 billion in 2010 and 5 trillion short
messages in 2011.3
8.4.1.3
Model 3: Another Crude Extrapolation
The 2008 UK SMS (source MDA) was 78.9 billion short messages for the year.4 The
Population Bureau, Washington, estimated the UK population in July 2008 to be 62 million,
and the world population to be 6.7 billion.5 Assuming 100% penetration in the UK, this
would result in a potential global text market of:
(79 billion short messages in UK per 62 million users in UK) ×
3.55 billion users worldwide = 4.5 trillion short messages worldwide
8.4.1.4
Conclusion
It can be estimated that the world market saw in 2008 about 3–4 trillion short messages
and a turnover of the order of $ 80–100 billion.
8.4.2
Some Considerations about the Market Development
Compared to the expectations at the time of the standardisation, there were major changes
in the mobile communication market. To begin with, car telephones (which no longer exist)
were in the prominent position. But customers have for years been using only personal
hand-portable phones. This has strengthened the character of SMS as a personal messaging
service.
The very high penetration of GSM phones in many markets and the acceptance of the
GSM standard in nearly all countries of the world have made SMS, which is integrated
in GSM, a ubiquitous service. These developments have increased SMS usage beyond all
expectations one might have had at the time SMS was standardised.
In the meantime, new mobile messaging services have appeared in the market: MMS
(Mobile Multimedia Messaging Service), Mobile Email, Mobile IM (Instant Messaging).
The emergence of MMS in 2005 was predicted by some to be the demise of SMS. In
reality, that has not been the case. Unlike SMS, MMS offers the capability of sending
complex graphics and media-rich messages, and yet its penetration has been somewhat
stunted.

dominant mobile messaging service.
8.4.4
Long-term Prospects for SMS
Another indicator in this direction is that the hottest and fastest-growing messaging service
on the Internet is not a multimedia-rich service but Twitter, a type of broadcast SMS with
just 140 characters per message.
SMS still has enormous scope for trafﬁc growth. Whereas person-to-person SMS is widely
accepted by young people, there is much room for use by older people. The fear of many,
especially among mobile operators, that IM and email might cannibalise SMS is greatly
exaggerated. SMS has the great advantage over IM and email to be available on all mobile
phones. SMS is installed in 4 billion phones worldwide. IM and email rely on a part of the
mobile phones equipped for these services and on 1 billion personal computers in service
in June 2008 which can be conﬁgured for IM and email.7
However, as mobile email becomes more established in the mobile workplace, it is
inevitable that, as the cost of mobiles that are capable of email decreases, the attraction
of SMS will be reduced, and the versatility of email may well begin to have an impact
on SMS. However, it remains an open question as to whether mobile email will play a
larger role in private use and in the large volumes of very cheap mobiles used in developing
countries or in the lower end of the market in developed countries. Only time will tell.

130
Short Message Service (SMS)
However, consideration is now being given in standardisation and in large companies
to using SMS as the transport mechanism for machine-to-machine communication (m2m).
This means that every car, every machine in every factory and even electricity, water and
gas consumption meters could in the future be equipped with SMS-capable mobiles.
The reality is that, in 2009, SMS is as popular as ever and shows no sign of dimin-
ishing. SMS is enjoying a long history of success analogous to the history of telex and
facsimile – all services attributing their success to simplicity.

Conclusions
F. Hillebrand
Hillebrand & Partners
9.1
Factors that Were Critical for the Success of SMS
SMS point-to-point is popular because of its simplicity as a personal messaging service.
Many customers carry their phones with them all the time and are normally able to send
short messages wherever they are (at home, in a neighbouring country or far away), and
whenever they want, to every GSM/UMTS phone in the world. SMS is the ideal messaging
service for short notices. It normally reaches the addressees wherever they are, and it
transfers the information as soon as possible. If the addressee’s phone is switched off or
outside radio coverage of a network, then the short message is normally received as soon
as it is possible for the network to deliver it. The received messages are normally stored in
the recipient’s phone and can be read at a convenient time. Thus, the sender need not to be
concerned about whether the recipient is reachable at the time of sending the short message.
The use of SMS by both sender and recipient is far less intrusive and hence socially more
acceptable than voice calls. And it outstrips any messaging service based upon the ﬁxed
networks – e.g. email – as people tend to carry their handsets all day, whereas they only
sporadically sit down at their ﬁxed-network terminal.
Customers value the price they have to pay for the service they get as fair. In the early
years of the GSM commercial service, a short message was cheaper than a phone call. But
today customers love the convenience of SMS, even if it is more expensive than the shortest
call in the cheapest tariff.
SMS is popular among network operators, as it can be implemented with a limited addi-
tional investment and is very proﬁtable. However, it remains to be seen what the impact
of the recent very deep price regulation in Europe will be on the ability of operators to
enhance capacities and features.
Short Message Service (SMS)

132
Short Message Service (SMS)
The success of SMS is enabled by its innovative low-cost implementation concept which
uses the signalling links of the GSM telephony system for the transport of short messages.
The restriction to 160 characters for a short message and the relatively long transmission
delays compared with many other data transmission services have not hindered the success
of SMS. The high quality of the technical speciﬁcations and the test speciﬁcations and the
test regime have ensured an end-to-end functioning including international roaming.
Another important success factor has been that the implementation of SMS was made
mandatory for every GSM mobile and every GSM network by an agreement between the
network operators in the framework of the GSM MoU Group. This led to an implementation
in every mobile station and every network.
It then needed just a large population of terminals and the creativity of a lot of young
people to make SMS a global success.
The additional features in the standard that were optional (such as EMS) were not so
successful, as it was unclear for the message sender whether the recipient’s mobile phone
supported the option. In the case of EMS, for example, the sender was unaware whether the
recipient’s mobile could display the EMS message. Very few of these options achieved a
signiﬁcant market penetration, not least because no efforts were made to seek an agreement
between network operators and manufacturers about the widespread implementation of the
optional features.
9.2
Proposals for a Further Evolution of SMS: SMS Phase 3
The GSM market receives about 1 billion new terminals per year. In the second quarter
of 2009, 286 million units were sold. Of these, 41 million were smart phones, which are
capable of advanced messaging services.1 Hence, a very large number of new SMS-capable
phones will come on the market in the years to come. Therefore, it seems to be worth
considering an evolution of SMS, including standardisation where needed. Areas for further
evolution could be:
• A review of the speciﬁed optional features and an attempt to make those that improve
the service mandatory. This could be done by a concerted effort on the part of operators
and manufacturers. Standardisation is not needed.
• As SMS will for some time yet be used much more widely than Twitter, it may be worth
implementing mechanisms that support user dialogues and the distribution of messages
to several addresses (as in Twitter). However, as far as I am concerned, there is yet no
protocol elements established between the SMS-SC and the MS to manage distribution
lists stored in the SMS-SC. If that were catered for, SMS would take a great leap towards
a more powerful chat platform. However, SC-speciﬁc short codes are already available
for distribution to several addresses. Twitter has three modes of operation: message to all
your followers, messages to speciﬁcally mentioned people and direct messages.
1 Figures from Gartner press release, August 2009.

Conclusions
133
• SMS delivery receipts do not always work very well and are increasingly difﬁcult as
more and more gateways are included. This could be ﬁxed with correct implementation
and a push from the operators and/or manufacturers.
• Looking forward, there is a clear demand for SMS text messaging now and in the fore-
seeable future, and anyone developing new radio technology had better make sure that
this market is catered for. This issue should be reviewed for LTE/SAE to ensure that
precautions for SMS are made.
A workshop could be held that would develop a concept for an SMS Phase 3, and then
a standardisation programme could be set up to specify it. In parallel, the buy-in of major
operators and manufacturers should be sought to implement these features by a certain date.
An SMS MoU could be signed to ensure success.
9.3
What Can be Learnt from SMS for Standardisation in Other
Areas
9.3.1
General Aspects
Later standardisation has often not used the lessons learnt from SMS. These are the key
lessons from SMS:
• Ensure that there is a value for the user and hence a market potential for a new feature.
• Keep the new feature simple. Hard limitations are acceptable if they lead to simplicity.
• Ensure a complete and robust speciﬁcation and interoperability testing.
• Ensure the commitment of major network operators and manufacturers to implementing
the new feature in terminals and networks from a certain time on.
9.3.2
A Proposal for Optimising MMS by a New, Simple, Ubiquitous MMS
MMS still has deﬁciencies owing to its complexity. The message container is structured like
a slideshow. On each slide, many media types can be inserted. The originator of a message
does not know the capabilities of the recipient. There are inconsistencies between different
implementations. This version of MMS does not have the potential to become ubiquitous
in every terminal.
However, there will be a very large number of new mobiles on the market in the years
to come, as outlined at the beginning of Section 9.2. Therefore we would like to propose
an additional new, basic, simple MMS suitable for ubiquitous use in every new terminal
for the mass market. Here are the proposed key parameters of the basic MMS:
• Improved signalling: MMS uses a chargeable short message to set up the GPRS session
(‘establish a PDP context’) for multimedia messages that need to be pushed towards a
receiving phone, as such sessions cannot be set up by the network. This creates difﬁculties

134
Short Message Service (SMS)
in IT for network operators and also in commercial considerations with regard to charging
for the short message. In order to remedy this, SMS should be enhanced by introducing
the possibility of using SMS messages as signalling elements that would not be shown
to users and not charged like user messages.
• Uniform message size for the multimedia message: An implementation should be possible
in every mobile. It is assumed that GPRS and EDGE will be available in every new mobile
and in every network. In order to achieve reasonable download times, the message size
should be limited to about 100 kB.
• Multimedia Message format: The message should be limited to one slide containing
several media.
• Photo: The multimedia message may contain one photo in JPEG with a maximum size
of about 50 kB. In email, the size of attached photos is normally reduced to 30–40 kB,
and this is sufﬁcient for the representation on all sorts of screen.
• Text: A ﬁeld for about 1000 characters coded in 16-bit Unicode should be envisaged,
which requires about 2 kB. This is roughly equivalent to the six SMS containers that
are used in concatenated SMS. Such a size is also sufﬁcient, as text inputting is a little
difﬁcult with the limited possibilities of a mobile station.
• Speech/audio: The remaining about 48 kB could be used either for about 60 seconds of
speech2 or for 10–15 seconds of audio3. This is sufﬁcient to accompany a photo.
An agreement should be sought among major network operators and manufacturers that
this feature package be implemented in every mobile and every network from an agreed date
onwards. The commitment for mobiles should contain an obligation to be able to receive
and to represent the full message. For sending, the omission of photos and audio should be
possible, as this might be too expensive for low-cost mobiles.
This feature package is built according to SMS principles. It is very attractive to users.
It provides a very great improvement on existing SMS and allows an implementation in
every mobile. This feature would function reliably, as the sender knows the capabilities of
the recipient.

Annex 2
Sources for Quoted GSM
Documents and Other Documents
The European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) maintains a comprehensive
archive of most documents that have been created in the history of GSM: meeting reports
including lists of participants, input documents, agreed documents, speciﬁcations of ser-
vices and technical features. ETSI has published the documents of the Plenary of the GSM
Committee in the DVD GSM and SMG Archives 1983–2000. This set of documents also
covers the later SMS history fairly well. An updated version will be published in 2010, also
covering early SMS history.
Then there is a description of GSM history including SMS in the book GSM and UMTS:
The Creation of Global Mobile Communication (ed. by Friedhelm Hillebrand), published by
John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, Chichester, UK, in 2001. This book presents contributions by the
37 people who participated in the development of GSM and UMTS. It touches upon the
cornerstones of early SMS history and contains a CD ROM with key documents including
those on the early history of SMS.

1At this meeting, those attending DGMH had agreed, with the full support of the WP4 chair, to
meet the Friday before the week of the WP4 meeting. In the period from 19 to 25 February, two
DGMH meetings were conducted. However, in this survey they will be treated as one meeting.
2Only a table of Change Requests remains from DGMH in Athens (WP4 Document 116/89).
3At this meeting, the secretary of GSM4 prefers to incorporate reporting of the draft groups in the
body text of the GSM4 MoM. However, in those cases, dates and those attending are omitted as
well. Therefore, no separate report from the DGMH meeting was submitted.

Annex 6
DGMH Attendance in the Period
from October 1990 to the End of
1996
There were more than 130 delegates in DGMH in the period. Therefore, the participation
is split into two tables.
The report from meeting 34 is missing, so this column is blank. The two other blank
columns are when there was no DGMH meeting.
Meetings 46, 47 and 49 had no list of DGMH delegates, so I have included all the
people mentioned in the report – there is no other evidence of anyone attending the DGMH
meeting (there is evidence of people attending the SMG4 meeting, but not all of them were
in the DGMH meeting, and I think it unfair to include all the SMG4 delegates as DGMH
participants).

Brief Biographies of the Authors
Friedhelm Hillebrand
Friedhelm Hillebrand was born in Warstein, Germany, in 1940. He obtained a Master of
Science degree in Communication Technology from the Technical University of Aachen
in 1968. Then he joined the Research Institute of AEG Telefunken in Ulm and worked
on system concepts for electronic switching systems. He joined Deutsche Bundespost, the
national telecommunications carrier, in 1970. From 1976 on, he became responsible for the
national X.25 packet switching network DATEX-P from the ﬁrst concepts until the end of
the ﬁrst year of service in 1981.
He was then appointed project manager for the next-generation mobile communication
system in spring 1983. He participated in GSM plenaries from November 1984 onwards.
He contributed to services design, international roaming and work management methods. In
1987/88 he became the founding Chairman of the GSM data group (IDEG, later called WP4).
From mid-1987 he was responsible for the GSM contributions of Deutsche Bundespost,
operators’ cooperation in GSM MoU and the implementation of the D1 GSM network in
Germany. He was responsible for the D1 system and network and the supporting IT systems
until the end of the ﬁrst year of operation in 1992.

Fred was the ﬁrst technical director of the GSM MoU Group from 1994 to 1996. There
he worked on strategy and GSM promotion worldwide. From May 1996 to August 2000 he
was chairman of the ETSI Technical Committee SMG. During this period the GSM Phase
2+ programme (e.g. GPRS, EDGE) and the fundaments of UMTS were completed. He
proposed the creation of 3GPP.
Fred founded Hillebrand & Partners (H&P), Consulting Engineers, at the beginning of
2002. H&P have been specialising on IPR matters, such as analysis of essentiality of patents,
search for prior art and the application of ETSI IPR policy, since 2004.
Finn Trosby
Finn Trosby was born in Sandefjord, Norway, in 1946. He was educated as a civil engineer at
the Norwegian Technical University in Trondheim 1965–1970. After serving in the military
forces (compulsory military service), he entered the research department in Telenor (at that
time ‘Televerket in Norway’) in February 1972.
In 1980 he started to work on mobile communications, focusing on, for example, mobile
messaging systems for both the private and business market segments. In 1987 he began
work on GSM by taking part in the IDEG/WP4 group on data services for GSM. He was
appointed chairman of DGMH (Draft Group on Message Handling, one of the subgroups
of WP4) and remained in that post in the period from July 1987 to September 1990.
DGMH was responsible for the design of the Short Message Service Point-to-Point and
Cell Broadcast and for GSM access to the Message Handling Service (X.400) in ﬁxed
networks.

Brief Biographies of the Authors
169
In 1990 he engaged in other R&D activities, e.g. the development of a simulator of
trafﬁc handling in a GSM network. In 1996 he entered Telenor Mobil – Telenor’s mobile
operating company in Norway, where he has been working on regulatory matters ever since.
In latter years he has concentrated on issues related to spectrum and spectrum management.
Kevin Holley
Kevin Holley was born in Kingston-upon-Thames, UK, in 1963. He obtained his bachelor’s
degree in Physics at Bristol University 1982–1985. Following graduation, he joined the
British Telecom Research Labs in Ipswich, UK, where he was responsible for various
cellular radio work including the development a signalling monitor (hardware/software) for
the analogue TACS system and developing a system including the user interface for an
acknowledged radio paging technology (hardware/software).
In 1988 he started working on GSM, at ﬁrst on a short project on call set-up times and then
in layer 2 simulation work for data trafﬁc, but moved quickly in June 1988 to work on SMS.
He helped to complete the ﬁrst SMS standard and started chairing the DGMH (Drafting
Group on Message Handling) in September 1990. In 1997 he was appointed chair of the
Special Mobile Group Working Group 4 (data services, including SMS) and he continued
in that role through the change to 3GPP until mid-2001.
Since then he has been responsible for standards development in O2 and Telef´onica,
including chairing 3GPP TSG SA1, the OMA Requirements Working Group, vice-chair of
OMA Technical Plenary and, since March 2009, vice-chair of 3GPP SA.

Ian Harris
Ian Harris was born at Minster on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, UK, in October 1945.
On leaving Sheerness Technical School, he joined the Royal Air Force for a short term,
specialising in air electronic radio and navigation, where he also studied electronic engi-
neering at various colleges and universities. He obtained his higher national certiﬁcate in
electronic engineering in 1966 and joined civil industry in 1968, pursuing a range of posts
in R&D. These encompassed hardware and software design and development using the ﬁrst
8-bit microprocessors in the mid-1970s for the data processing industry, through to the
design and development of navigation and positioning systems for unmanned submersibles,
ship and aircraft engaged in the offshore industry.
In 1984, he joined the newly created ‘Vodafone’ as their chief engineer for value-added
services and was later appointed a senior technical manager. His primary role in Vodafone
was for the speciﬁcation, development and deployment of value-added services such as
‘Data and Facsimile’ over the UK analogue cellular total access communications system
(TACS). With the advent of GSM, in 1988 he became Vodafone’s design authority for
SMS, working closely with his marketing peers to develop many business applications and
enhancements for SMS until he left the company in 2002.
He obtained his Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEE) chartered engineer status in 1976,
and was appointed a Fellow of IEE in 1991 for his work in Cellular Mobile Telecommuni-
cations.
He is currently a technical consultant to Research In Motion (RIM) – the company prob-
ably more well known for being the manufacturer of the ‘Blackberry’.

Brief Biographies of the Authors
171
He has been an active member in GSM and 3GPP standards since 1988 and was active
in the creation of the ﬁrst SMS speciﬁcation. He was elected vice-chair of SMG4 (the ETSI
group responsible for SMS) in 1998 and through its transition to T2 under 3GPP in 1999,
when he took the responsibility of chairing the 3GPP T2 SMS subgroup. In May 2001,
he was elected chairman of T2 and remained in that post until March 2005 when T2 was
disbanded. He took on the task of rapporteur for SMS speciﬁcations in 1999 and retains
that role today. He is still regularly consulted on SMS matters from across the industry.
