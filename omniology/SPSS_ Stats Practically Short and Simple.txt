An Overview

1.1	
Getting In
Having opened SPSS you will get a dialogue box which you can cancel the first time you enter SPSS.
Enlarge the window.
SPSS is like a spreadsheet but it does not update calculations, tables or charts if you change the data.
At the top of the screen are a series of menus which can be used to instruct SPSS to do something.
SPSS uses 2 windows: The Data Editor, which is what you are looking at and which has 2 tabs at the 
bottom, and the Viewer.
The Viewer is not visible yet, but opens automatically as soon as you open a file or run a command that 
produces output, such as statistics, tables and charts. 
The menus are the same in each window but the icons are different. To switch between the two windows 
use the tabs at the bottom of the screen.
The Data Editor window:

An Overview
SPSS comes with a large number of sample data files, which this book will use. If you do not have access 
to these, use any data set you have access to.
To open the data file 1991 U.S. General Social Survey.sav 
use File > Open > Data
•	 Double click on the appropriate directories to open each
•	 Double click on the file 1991 U.S. General Social Survey.sav
At first you will probably be faced by a mass of seemingly meaningless numbers. 
If you look along the toolbar you will find the Value labels icon 
. Click on this and the output 
should look more friendly.
•	 Click on the Variables icon 
 to get an overview of each variable.
Exercise:
•	 How many Regions of the United States are represented?
1.2	
Frequencies
•	 Let’s start simply. All that data looks a bit overwhelming so we need to get a handle on it 
and pick out the main messages. 
•	 First of all how many men and women are there in this group?

An Overview
For a simple count, and for percentages use
Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Frequencies.
SPSS uses Dialogue boxes for the selection of variables and options.
The source list contains the list of variables, with icons as before indicating data types.
•	 Your dialogue box may have only listed the variable names, e.g. sex, rather than the variable 
labels such as ‘Respondent’s sex’. It is more helpful in analysis to see these labels.
•	 If they are not shown use Edit > Options
•	 Select the General tab and at the top under Variable Lists click on the circle Display 
Labels.

Introduction
This is a chapter for anyone faced with the long and tedious task of entering data. Spend a little time 
planning this. Wherever possible use numbers rather than text for answers as you can add labels later.
With questionnaires one usually has a separate column for each question, but if you have a question 
such as:
“Rate each of the following on a score of 1 to 10 according to importance for the community:
Adequate housing
Good schools
Cultural facilities
Sports facilities.”
You will need a separate column for each category.

Entering Data
Data can be entered directly or imported from an existing SPSS file, spreadsheet or text file, and we 
shall cover each of these.
Opening an existing SPSS file.
Use File > Open > Data
2.2	
Entering Data directly
Entering numbers and text.
The Data Editor Window looks suspiciously like a spreadsheet, and numbers and text can be entered 
directly. 
Be warned, though it looks like a spreadsheet it does not behave like one. Your charts and output will 
not automatically update if you should change the original data, and you cannot enter formulae directly 
into a cell, though you can do calculations using a different facility. 
•	 Open a new data sheet. Try Ctrl n; this is the shortcut key to open a new file.
•	 Or use File > New > Data
•	 Try entering some numbers in the first column. 
•	 Type what you want in each cell; press the return key or a cursor key. 
•	 If you make a mistake retype the entry. 
•	 Now try to put some text into the same column. 
•	 Can you? You can type it in but when you press Enter it disappears.
•	 This is because SPSS has identified the column as a numeric one and won’t allow any text.
•	 Put some names of countries in the next column to the right including Australia.
•	 What happens? Most probably it is cut short. 
•	 Try entering numbers in this column – you can but you will not be able to do any 
calculations with them as SPSS thinks they are text.
•	 Your new variables have been given the names VAR00001 and VAR00002 which we will 
now change.

Defining Variables
At the foot of the screen are two tabs. Click on Variable View to get the following screen.
Overtype VAR00001 and VAR00002 with the names of your new variables: numbers and countries  
will do.
Click in the cell under Type to get a grey square.
Click on that to bring up a Variable Type box which you can use to define your variable, control the 
number of decimal places shown, column width etc.
2.4	
Adjusting the width
You can adjust the width of your countries column to 18.
Annoyingly when you return to Data View you will still not find Australia displayed, though when you 
type it in again it will appear.

Variable names
•	 They must start with a letter but can now be 64bytes long.
•	 They can contain numerals e.g. abc12
•	 But cannot contain spaces or % sign. 
•	 Keep them short.
It is important to keep variable names short so that you can see as much as possible of your data on the 
screen. It is quite an art to write short names that still give you an idea of what the column is all about. 
Resist the temptation to write Q1, Q2 etc.
You can enter longer descriptive variable labels to explain what the columns are, and these labels will 
appear on all output. 
Tip: It is better to enter most data as numerical codes and then provide labels explaining what 
the codes represent. Adding Variable and Value Labels will be explained after you have loaded the 
spreadsheet.
2.6	
Entering data via a spreadsheet
Excel spreadsheets can be opened in SPSS with the variable names.

Entering Data
One can also simply copy and paste the data cells from Excel into SPSS but you will have to label the 
columns.
•	 To open a spreadsheet use File > Open > Data 
•	 Ask the dialogue box to display All files and not just the SPSS ones.
Find the spreadsheet to open.
SPSS will recognise the format and automatically give this 
dialogue box.
Tick Read variable names.
Click OK.
2.7	
Adding Variable Labels
To keep your sheet manageable it is advisable to have short column names.
Variable labels can explain more fully the nature of the variable – you have 256 characters for the 
description.
•	 In Variable View of the Data Editor.
•	 Click on the cell under the Label column and type in a suitable label.

21 
Entering Data
To give an example I might have the variable exgrp, short for exercise group.
The Variable Label for this would then be exercise group.
2.8	
Adding Value Labels
Value Labels explain numerical codes. 
To insert a Value Label
•	 Click in the cell under the Values column and a small grey square appears. 
•	 Click on this to bring up the Define Variable box.
Enter a value in the Value box, here it is 1
Type an appropriate label in the Value Label box, e.g. 
smokes regularly 
Click on Add
Enter the value 2, and a label, e.g. non-smoker 
Add
When all the values have been entered use Add for the 
final value, then click on OK
A very useful tip for lots of identical value labels for different variables:
•	
E.g. if you are entering. 0 = No and 1 = Yes, 
•	
Enter them for one variable. 
•	
Then right click on the cell
•	
Select Copy
•	
Go to a new variable and use Paste under the 
Value column. 
•	
This is a huge time saver!
To return to the data click on the Data View tab at the bottom of the screen.

Important note
When selecting data, defining groups, obtaining multiple response sets you will need to use the numeric 
value entered in a column and not the text label.
In these circumstances always check what the original data has entered by clicking on the 
 icon first.
2.10	
Finally
It is very easy to make a mistake when entering data. 
When it is all entered use Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Frequencies for each column which will 
help you spot the most glaring errors .e. 11 instead of 1.

Printing from SPSS
•	 Remember that you need to save your Output first.
•	 You can print directly from the Viewer window using File > Print, but
•	 use Print Preview first to make sure you have what you want. 
•	 To print just one specific thing click on it first to select it. 
•	 Output that you don’t want can be hidden by clicking on the icons in the left hand pane.
3.13	
Recoding into groups
•	 You will find it very useful to be able to recode data.

•	 It might be useful to regroup the data into subgroups and give each group a numerical code. 
•	 As an example I suggest recoding the students into 3 groups:	
 
Those with no brothers or sisters	
	
	
Group 1 
Those with 1, 2 or 3 brothers or sisters		
	
Group 2 
Those with 4 or more brothers or sisters	
	
Group 3

Selecting a subset
During your investigations you may want to look only at the data for the males, or females.
•	 SPSS enables us to select just these cases using 	
•	 Data > Select Cases > If condition is satisfied (click in the circle next to this)
•	 Click on the If…button under If condition is satisfied  
(the If button will not be available if you have not clicked in the circle)
•	 Enter the appropriate condition, e.g. the example shows what has to be filled in for selecting 
males.
•	 Notice you have to put sex =1 not sex = “males”
•	 This is because the data entered into SPSS in the sex column was numeric
Continue	
	
	
select Filter out unselected cases 	
	
OK
(Tip: Do not delete the other cases as they will be lost for good.)
If you scroll down the data sheet you will notice that the females are crossed out on the left, and are now 
ignored in any operation. Try a frequency table for Respondent’s sex and see what you get.
To restore all the data use 	
Data >	 Select Cases >	  All cases	
	
OK
Be warned: this is all too easily overlooked when you have been working on only part of the data, and then 
decide to analyse what you think is the complete data set.

Selecting a Random Sample
This is a two stage process: 
•	 First we set the starting point and type of random number generation. 
•	 Then we select the actual sample.
To select the starting point and type of number generator:
•	 Use Transform > Random Number Generators
•	 Select Set Active Generator
•	 There are two ways in which SPSS version 16 generates random numbers. The current active 
random number generator is displayed. 
•	 You should use Mersenne Twister unless you want to reproduce results generated in SPSS 
version 12.
•	 Select Set Starting Point. 
•	 Choosing Random allows a different start point for the random selection each time you 
enter SPSS. 
•	 Entering a Fixed Value (which can be any number) allows a random selection to be 
reproduced.
•	 Try them both in the next example and see what happens.
•	 If you do not set a starting point you will get the same random selection each time you 
enter SPSS.
•	 Click OK following your selection.
•	 Any settings you make will remain in force for future sessions

Merging Files
•	 Sometimes you will have two data files relating to the same people, or two files with similar 
data but with different people. 
•	 Using Merge Files you can add Variables or Cases to an existing file.
3.19	
Adding Variables
•	 Open the first file 
•	 Open the second file which will relate to the same people or objects but with different variables. 
•	 Always open using File Open – do not double click from Windows Explorer as this will 
often open another running of SPSS.
•	 To merge the two files so that you have all the variables in one:
•	 You must have a key variable which identifies each case, and you must have sorted the 
files so that the key variable is in the same order in each.
•	 Use Data > Merge Files > Add Variables.
•	 Choose the first file from the list under An open dataset and click Continue

Descriptive Statistics

The Analyze function in SPSS enables us to summarise our data in a number of ways.
The confusion is what to use when, especially as there is often more than one way of doing things in SPSS.
This section provides a guide to what to use, and a brief look at the functions in turn.
Remember this is a book on SPSS not on statistics.
A ‘Very Rough Guide’ as to what is appropriate to use when:
All the functions are found under	
Analyze	
Descriptive Statistics 	 except where stated.
Task
SPSS function
Comments
Counts
Frequencies (offers charts too)
Crosstabs
Use %’s as well as counts. 
%’s are used for comparisons.
Round %’s to the nearest whole number 
in reports.
Averages  and Measures of 
spread
Frequencies with the Statistics option;
Descriptives.
Make sure you use a sensible measure, 
e.g. the mean gender is meaningless. 
Comparing sets of data
Explore (offers charts too)
Crosstabs 
Analyze > Custom Tables
Beware of using boxplots for 
inappropriate data, eg nominal.
Crosstab tables can look untidy, so think 
carefully about the number of levels and 
the information required in them.
Use for multiple responses.
All tables can be modified.
Looking for relationships
Tables: Crosstabs
Scatterplots 
(see Scatter/Dot in the Graphs menu)
Plots and tables give a visual impression 
of possible relationships: the eyeball test.
You may then need to follow this up with 
the appropriate statistical test.

The Functions
What follows is a brief description of the following functions: 
Frequencies, Descriptives, Explore, Crosstabs and a brief look at other Tables.
Frequencies: Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Frequencies
This is the best function for overall summaries
Frequencies are used when you want to know how many of something you have.
However, additional statistics available via the Statistics button makes it far more useful than just 
counting. 
The Charts button is particularly useful; automatically producing charts of your data.

Finding Frequencies for Multiple Response Variables
When you write a questionnaire you often include a question where the respondent can tick more than 
one response.
In the data file 1991 U.S.General Social Survey.sav there are several questions relating to health, e.g. 
Are you ill enough to go to a doctor?
Have you received counselling for mental problems?
Infertility, are you unable to have a baby?
Do you have a drinking problem?
Using frequencies we could obtain a separate table for each but SPSS can combine these multiple responses 
into one table for you.

Explore: Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Explore
This is an extremely useful command when you need to compare two sets of data, 
e.g. ages of males and females. It explores the differences.
The example shows the dialogue box set up to compare the ages of men and women in the 1991 
U.S.General Social Survey.sav data file.
SPSS has been asked to display both statistics and charts, the latter being boxplots and stem and leaf 
plots – again a very useful automatic facility.

Boxplots are a useful way of comparing two or more data sets. They are as the name implies a box whose 
length represents the inter-quartile range of the data.
The lower edge of the box is at the lower quartile of the data, and the upper edge at the upper quartile. 
A horizontal line indicates the median.
‘Whiskers’ are drawn to the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 box-lengths of each end of the 
box. Outliers are indicated by o. Values outside 3 box-lengths are indicated by *

Crosstabs: Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Crosstabs
If you want a table use Crosstabs.
The Tables function is in my opinion only for advanced users of SPSS.
The Crosstabs function produces slightly complex tables, but these can be edited to look tidier. 
It has the useful additional facility of doing a Chi-Squared test (and others) if asked – use the Statistics 
button. The Cells button enables one to choose Column %’s, Row %’s and Total %’s, but it is advisable 
to ask for only one at a time, for clarity.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

•	 What % of females were very happy?
•	 Of those who were very happy, what % were female?
•	 The answers are 30% of females were very happy and 56% of those who were very happy 
were female.
•	 You may well have got it the wrong way round.
•	 This is the biggest problem students have – wrongly interpreting %’s in tables. 
The tip is to do both column and row %’s and have them in front of you so that you can see the difference. 
•	 Crosstabs should produce adequate tables for all your needs, but there are other Tables 
functions in SPSS. 
•	 My advice is to ignore these unless you feel very confident.
•	 Plenty of help on Tables is available under the SPSS Help function.

Introduction
SPSS provides a wide variety of charts to choose from including bar charts, histograms, pie charts, 
scatterplots, and boxplots. 
These are accessed via Graphs> Chart Builder
Or by Charts > Legacy Dialogs
Charts should convey a message; 
They should help the reader to understand the data, and not confuse.
Try to use as little ‘ink’ as possible – cluttered charts are not easy to understand.
Drawing appropriate charts is not as easy as it looks, so if you feel daunted use the Charts options under 
Frequencies.
For boxplots use Explore.
These two commands will do most of the thinking for you.
In general there are a 2 simple rules which will help:
Decide what your message is and find a chart that conveys it clearly.
Label everything, but don’t swamp the chart with words – adjust the font size.
Here are 2 examples

for comparing different subgroups.
To produce a panel bar chart of physical activity by gender use 
Graph > Legacy Dialogs >Bar > Simple, 
Put General Happiness in Category Axis and 
Respondent’s Sex in the Panel by > Rows box.
You should get the chart shown. 
This clearly needs some editing.

NB Printing in black and white can lose the 
detail in coloured charts.
This is a good example of that, if you were to 
print this chart in black and white it would 
be hard to find the median bar in some of 
the boxplots.
So, if you know charts will not be printed 
in colour, it is a good idea to change the 
shadings
There is only one way to master chart drawing in SPSS and that is by having plenty of practice – so over

Regression and Correlation
6	 Regression and Correlation
6.1	
Introduction
In statistics when faced with data we attempt to summarise it and then look for patterns. Regression is 
about patterns; the possible relationship between two sets of data, bivariate data.
Open the data set advert.sav from SPSS’s own sample data sets. 
This has two columns representing spending on advertising and sales in the same period.
The type of questions we might ask about our two variables are:
•	 Are the two variables related?
•	 What sort of relationship is there?
•	 Can we describe (quantify) the strength of the relationship?
•	 Can we predict one variable from the other?
6.2	
Scatter Diagrams
A visual impression is enormously helpful.
The first thing to do is to plot the data, 
with the independent (x) variable on the 
horizontal axis and the dependent (y) 
variable vertically.
Sometimes it isn’t obvious which is which. Here 
it is reasonable to suppose sales depend on 
advertising. 
Plot the data with a Scatter Plot 
Graphs > Chart builder > Scatter/Dot
6.3	
Correlation
Correlation quantifies (puts a number to) the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables 
and also indicates the direction of the relationship. 
The correlation coefficient, r, measures the strength of the linear relationship.
The value of r is between +1 and -1
Values of r close to +1 or -1 represent a strong linear relation.
A value of r close to 0 means that the linear association is very weak. 
It could be that there is NO association at all, or the relationship is non-linear.

SPSS: Stats Practically Short and Simple
66 
Regression and Correlation
Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient is used where you have variables which represent 
measurements of some form. 
Use Analyze > Correlate > Bivariate with the two variables asking for the Pearson coefficient.
This shows a correlation coefficient of 0.916 and a significance value of 0.000.
The significance is <0.05 and indicates that if there is no linear relationship between spending on 
advertising and sales there is a less than 0.05% chance that a random sample of this size would give a 
value of r as extreme as 0.916 .
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient can also be used. Spearman’s coefficient can be used when you 
have merely ordered variables, e.g. treatments ranked as to effectiveness. The printout gives a different 
value for r having been calculated another way, but the significance value is again <0.05.

Regression and Correlation
6.4	
Correlation and Causation
Correlation quantifies the degree of association between two variables – BUT BEWARE for although 
two variables may seem to be related, a change in one may not cause a change in another.
Correlation coefficients are the most frequently misused statistics so when interpreting your correlation 
coefficient remember 
•	 that correlation does not mean causation;
•	 to use your common sense! 
6.5	
Regression
Having discovered that two variables are correlated the next question might be can we model this data 
using a straight line?
Can we predict what the sales between and are likely to be from the spending on advertising?
Linear Regression is the technique that is used to find the line that best models the data.
We first have to decide which variable is dependant on the other – here the sales are likely to be dependent 
on the spending on advertising. 
Use Analyze > Regression > Linear 
Place Detrended sales in the Dependent box 
and 
Advertising spending in the independent box.

Regression and Correlation
The Model Summary shows the goodness of fit statistics indicating whether the model is a good fit.
•	 R is the correlation coefficient measuring the strength of the linear relationship.
•	 R Square is the coefficient of determination, more usually expressed as a percentage. Here 
it tells us that 89% of the variability in the sales can be explained by the variability in the 
spending on advertising.
•	 The Std Error of the Estimate can be thought of as a typical residual; the difference between 
what is predicted by the model and what is observed. 
The ANOVA box shows a significance value of .000 This indicates that the regression is significant, i.e. 
that there is a useful linear model.
The Coefficients box tells us that the equation that models the line has a slope of 1.071 
and an intercept of 6.584.
We need to know if the variable is actually significant. This is indicated by the significance column on 
the right. Sig values > 0 ·05 indicate that the coefficient is not significant. Remember that we are trying 
to deduce a model to predict price for the population based on a relatively small sample. This means 
our values for the coefficients of the slope and intercept are only estimates.

The t value column has done a t-test to test the probability that the coefficient is zero given the sample 
data, and the Sig column is the p value for this test.
Here our coefficients are OK so our regression equation would be sales = 1.071* spending on  
advertising + 6.584
We need to know:
1.	 Is this line a good fit?  
The answer is given by the goodness of fit statistics.	
and
2.	 Is it an appropriate model?  
Here we need to look at the residual plots available under the Plots button
•	 To obtain a chart showing the regression line use Analyze > Regression > Curve 
Estimation
•	 filling out the dialogue box as shown.
We have looked at linear Regression but there are other models available from the Regression menu.

Multiple regression is used where we have more than one variable which might predict the dependent 
variable.
For a linear model we use the same commands as before: Analyze > Regression > Linear

7	 Statistical Tests
Many students and others want to be able to use the statistical tests in SPSS for hypothesis testing. This 
is not a statistics textbook, but a guide to using SPSS, so no theory is included but it is nevertheless 
important to stress that you need: 
•	 To be clear about your research question, or the hypothesis you propose to test.
•	 To be sure that the data you are collecting will actually answer that research question, and 
•	 To collect it from a random sample, to be free from bias.
The procedure is:
•	 Write your hypothesis and null hypothesis.
•	 Collect the data.
•	 Look at the data – what does the evidence of the sample suggest? 
•	 Make a chart if possible.
•	 It is usual to test the Null Hypothesis which is a statement of no difference; no association.
•	 Select an appropriate test.
•	 Check that the requirements for that test have been satisfied; e.g. was the sample a random 
sample?
•	 Carry out the test and identify the p value.
•	 Is the p value >= 0.05, or < 0.05?

The requirement for this test is that the sample has been randomly selected.
Use this to test for a hypothesised value; it will give you the confidence interval for the mean of a 
population. 
E.g. Test the hypothesis that the mean number of brothers and sisters people have is 3.
Using Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Explore
•	 with Age of Respondent in the Dependent List 
•	 with no Factor 
•	 asking for Statistics only
The output is:
The confidence interval would support any hypothesis which suggested that the population mean was 
between the Lower Bound of 3.78 and the Upper Bound of 4.09
There is no evidence at the 5% level that the mean number of brothers and sisters is 3.

The null hypothesis is not accepted. 
The conclusion is that this sample shows evidence at the %5 level that there is an association between 
happiness and gender, with men appearing to be happier.

t-test for related samples 
The requirement for this test is that the sample is randomly selected. There is no need for the underlying 
population to be normal provided the sample size is large, i.e. >30.
With related samples we are comparing the differences between pairs of readings that are related: two 
pulse readings from the same patient.
Use the SPSS data set New drug.sav for this example. This is a very small data set but we shall assume 
the subjects were randomly selected.

This gives a low p value of < 0.0005 so we conclude that the samples show that there is a significant 
difference between the population means of the highest year of school completed by male and females.

Analysis of Variance
We are assuming here that we have independent simple random samples drawn from normal populations.
Analysis of variance is a method for comparing the means of several populations. Simple random samples 
are drawn from each and are used to test the null hypothesis that the population means are all equal. 
ANOVA compares the variation among groups with the variation within groups. 
The question:	
Is there a difference in the population means of the Highest year of school 
completed for each region?
The Research Hypothesis:	
There a difference in the population means of the Highest year of school 
completed for each region.
The Null Hypothesis:	
There is no difference in the population means of the Highest year of 
school completed for each region. 
•	 Use Analyze > Compare Means > One-Way ANOVA
Fill out the dialogue box as shown with 
the Highest Year of School in the 
Dependent List,

Statistical Tests

Non-Parametric Tests
A parameter is a number describing the population, e.g. the mean or standard deviation, as distinct 
from a statistic which is a number that can be calculated from the sample data without needing to know 
anything else about the population.
Many statistical tests are parametric tests and make the assumption that the populations involved have 
‘normal distribution’. These tests are very useful and robust but there are occasions when we would 
like to compare two samples which we cannot assume come from a ‘normal’ population, or where the 
measurements are on an ordinal scale as distinct from an interval one.
For such populations we use non-parametric tests. We can use these on ‘normal’ data too.
Note: if the values in the population have a skewed distribution, or if the measurement scale is ordinal 
then it is better to use the median rather than the mean.
Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test also known as the Mann Whitney U test for independent samples
The question:	
Is the population median of the Highest Year of School Completed the 
same for males and females?
The Hypothesis:	
There is a difference in the population median of the Highest Year of 
School Completed for males and females?
The Null Hypothesis:	
There is no difference in the population median of the Highest Year of 
School Completed for males and females?
First we need to find the median Highest Year of School Completed for males and females. 
Use Explore. males: 13.23; females: 12.63.
These are two independent samples; the variable (Highest Year) we shall treat as continuous.
Use Analyze > Nonparametric Tests > 2 Independent Samples
Complete the dialogue box as shown using the Define groups button for the genders (1, 2).

We shall again use the SPSS data set New drug.sav for this example. This is a very small data set but we 
shall assume the subjects were randomly selected.
The question:	
Is there a difference in the population median of pulse rates 1 and 2 of 
patients.
The Research Hypothesis:	
There is a difference in the population median of pulse rates 1 and 2 of 
patients.
The Null Hypothesis:	
There is no difference in the population median of pulse rates 1 and 2 of 
patients.
We are comparing the differences between pairs of readings that are related: the two pulse rates are from 
the same patient.

And finally
8	 And finally
This is not a statistics textbook. This has been a book about using SPSS, written for non statisticians. 
You are probably reading it because you have data to analyse, and want to find out how SPSS can help you. 
It won’t be able to help unless you understand what your data is measuring, which of your numbers mean 
a measurement, and which are merely shorthand codes for answering “Yes” or “I do a lot of training.”
Time spent thinking about your data is never wasted. Think about what you would like your final report 
to say; it will direct your analysis. Firstly though do the simple stuff: look at frequencies, draw charts 
(simple ones) and produce two way tables. Make sure you produce two of these each time, one showing 
row percentages and one showing column percentages, and don’t be tempted to combine them in one 
because that leads to confusion. Keep it simple.
With luck through doing this the data should start to tell you its story, and once you have a handle on 
that you will be well away.
Because this is not statistics textbook I suggest you find one that suits you and consult it from time to 
time. Better still find a statistician, who will be very grateful for all the simple stuff you have done first!
