The Senses 
General Principles 
 
Somatosensation 
receptors in skin, muscle and bones & visceral receptors  
(in organs) detect pain, temperature, touch, pressure, and  
proprioception (joint capsule, tendon, and muscle stretch) 
 
Vision 
Hearing 
Vestibular System (Equilibrium) 
Chemical Senses 
 
taste 
 
smell 
 
also visceral stimuli like pH and O2 content of blood, osmolarity, blood glucose 
special senses – receptors confined 
 
to a specific organ and are 
 
associated with cranial nerves 

General Principles 
sensation – sensory information that reaches the brain 
 
what the stimulus is, where it is, how strong  
 
(action potential frequency, more neurons stimulated) 
 
perception – how we interpret the sensation 
 
adaptation – decrease in sensitivity, decreased action  
 
potential frequency with the same stimulus 
 
some systems more sensitive to adaptation 
 
 
we filter out most sensory information that we collect

Touch and Pressure – mechanoreceptors in encapsulated and free 
nerve endings 
 
Proprioception – muscle stretch receptors, mechanoreceptors  
in skin, joints, tendons, ligaments, vision, vestibular system 
Somatosensation 
Temperature – different types of thermoreceptors (ion channels 
activated at certain temps), also respond to menthol, capsaicin, 
ethanol 
 
Pain – free nerve endings expressing nociceptors, sense 
mechanical deformation, chemicals released by damaged cells or 
immune cells 

Visual System 
Used to determine the shape & color of objects & their movement. 
Light particles (photons) have wavelengths and energies associated 
with different colors.   
 
Eye:  
Functions like a camera to focus light on the retina using a lens and  
an aperture (pupil) whose size can be adjusted to change the  
amount of entering light. 
 
Vision: 
Process by which light reflected from external objects are translated  
into a mental image. This process consists of 3 steps:  
 
1. light enters the eye and is focused by a lens on to the retina. 
 
2. retinal photoreceptors transduce light energy into electrical 
 
signal.  
 
3. processing of the electrical signals through neural pathways. 
 

Human Eye 
The pupil adjusts the amount of light entering.  
Changes in the shape of the lens focus the light onto the retina. 
The retina contains the photoreceptors, rods & cones. 
Cornea - most 
focusing occurs 
here due to 
air/cornea 
density 
differences 
Lens - adjusts 
for change in 
distance

Contraction state of the ciliary muscles (circular like a sphincter) determines the amount of tension 
that the zonular fibers (ligaments) exert on the lens: 
contracted = less tension, more rounded lens (focus on near object),         
relaxed =  more tension, more flattened lens (focus on distant object). 
Focusing Changes the Lens Shape  
relaxed 
contracted 

Phototransduction 
Steps 2-5 - Starts a signal transduction cascade that closes cGMP-gated cation channel 
Since the photoreceptor cell is depolarized at rest, closing of the cation channel causes a graded potential where the 
cell becomes hyperpolarized which reduces neurotransmitter secretion

Step 1- Retinal (vit. A) from 
photopigment changes 
conformation when exposed to 
light 

Transduction of Signal 
Photoreceptors and bipolar cells generate graded potentials.  
Ganglion cells always generate action potentials.  
 
Ratio of photoreceptor cells to bipolar cells determines the resolution. 

Light, Cones & Rods 
Rods are used for night vision. B/c they exhibit convergence, rods give low resolution sight at low levels of 
illumination. Rods contain rhodopsin and are more numerous than cones. 
 
Cones are used for daylight vision. Cones are in a 1:1 ratio to bipolar and ganglion cells. Cones give high 
resolution sight at high levels of illumination.

Key Concepts 
 
Basic function of a sensory receptor is to detect 
change in the environment (called a stimulus) and 
convert the energy (heat, light, pressure, etc) of 
the stimulus into electrical signals (action 
potentials) in the nervous system. This conversion 
is called transduction.  
  
 
Somatosensory pathways carry information about 
pain, temperature, touch, pressure, vibration, 
position of the body parts, and their movements.  
 
 
The visual system detects the shape and color of 
objects and the movement of objects in the 
external environment. Light is detected by 
different cells (rods, cones) in the eye and sent 
via the optic nerve to the visual cortex for 
processing.
