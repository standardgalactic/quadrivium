Introduction
W
elcome to Call Centers For Dummies, 2nd Edition. If the topic of call 
centers has piqued your interest, and you’re looking for a road 
map that can help you lead and manage a call center, you’ve come to the 
right place. The purpose of this book is to demystify call centers, explain-
ing clearly what they do and how they do it, all in a simple, straightforward 
manner. We hope that you’ll have a little fun along the way, too!
In the first edition, Réal Bergevin clearly laid out his approach to call center 
management and did an excellent job of covering a wide range of related 
topics. So why did we write a second edition? Well, call centers have changed 
significantly because of the advancements in technology and the growing 
influence of the Internet. A new challenge now exists because customers have 
many ways to communicate with the call center. In addition to the good ol’ 
phone, customers can use e-mail, online chat, or text messaging to express 
their feelings or ask questions about products or services.
In addition, many agents can work from home now, so you need to be able to 
communicate with those home agents effectively. You also have to find inno-
vative ways to lead, motivate, and coach people remotely.
With change coming at a fast and furious pace, how are you going to provide 
consistently exceptional service to your customers? You can conquer this 
seemingly difficult task by sticking to the fundamentals, which we cover in 
this book. This book draws on the experience and insight of four people (us!), 
but we all lead our businesses by using the same people-first philosophy.
We can’t think of a better vehicle for sharing our knowledge, vision, and phi-
losophy for leading and managing call centers than this book. We hope that 
you enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed writing it.
About This Book
Many people have developed some pretty strong opinions about call cen-
ters. Executives and analysts alike realize more than ever that call centers 
can have a tremendous impact on a company’s revenue, costs, market intel-
ligence, and customer loyalty. Call centers have become a significant part of 
local and world economies.

2
Call Centers For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
A well-run call center doesn’t happen by accident or chance. It happens only 
if the leader of the center has a clear vision of what can be achieved and cre-
ates an environment where high-performing teams can flourish. This book 
can help because it’s full of best practices for leading people and managing 
process and technology.
Because of the complexity of operating a business in today’s world, many 
call center professionals have come to us to deepen their understanding of 
how changes in business affect call center operations. We hope that you ben-
efit not only from this book’s collection of best practices, but also from the 
depth of knowledge that we’ve gathered through our combined half century 
of experience. The difference between this book and the variety of call center 
publications, seminars, and Web sites out there is that this book doesn’t 
offer a call center “theory of everything.” We share with you concepts and 
practices that have worked for us in our operations. We know that manag-
ers benefit from their mistakes as much as they do from their successes, and 
through these pages, you get the advantage of seeing what to do as well as 
what not to do.
Foolish Assumptions
If you work in the call center industry, this book gives you an easy-to-use and 
(we hope) easy-to-read reference guide to the effective operation of a call 
center. We make some assumptions about who you are and what you may be 
looking for in this book:
 
✓ You’re a hotshot MBA tracking through your career, and you find your-
self running a call center.
 
✓ You’re an experienced call center manager, and you’re looking for some 
new ideas and perspectives.
 
✓ You supply the call center industry and want to better understand your 
clients’ management perspective.
 
✓ You work in marketing, finance, or human resources, so you have some 
contact with a call center and wonder what goes on in it.
 
✓ You’re considering a career in call centers.
 
✓ You’re working in a call center and want to advance your career by 
unlocking the mysterious, ancient call center secrets.
 
✓ You’re looking for new material with which you can dazzle members of 
the opposite sex. (Okay, we don’t make any promises about this one.)

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
Call Centers For Dummies, 2nd Edition is organized in six parts (plus two 
appendixes), each covering a different aspect of the call center. Chapters 
within each part cover specific topics in detail. Each part contains concepts 
and definitions, interesting facts and anecdotes, and (in most cases) practi-
cal how-to suggestions pertaining to the topic. You can take any approach to 
tackling this book. Unless you’re a seasoned call center pro, however, you’ll 
probably get the most out of this book by starting with Part I.
Part I: From the Ground Up: 
An Overview of the Call Center
This part provides a good overview of many of the topics covered in more 
detail in later parts. Consider it to be a call center primer, with a little bit 
extra. If you’re just getting started or want a brief indoctrination in all things 
call center, you may find this part to be especially useful.
In this part, we also discuss planning a new call center and considering out-
sourcing, and we introduce a business model for building a call center and 
relate that model to the larger corporate mission and goals.
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, 
Analysis, and Resource Management
This part looks at call center analysis, financial planning, and staffing. We 
provide a simple overview of how (and what) measures come together to 
drive a call center’s operational and financial performance.
Also in this part, we uncover some of the mysteries of how and why call cen-
ters perform the way they do, and we explore everything from forecasting to 
schedule creation and workforce management automation.
Part III: Making Life Better 
with Technology
Part III reviews call center technologies, including basic requirements, valu-
able enhancements, and home agent programs. We also cover a simple 

4
Call Centers For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
approach to recommending and justifying new technology, and we show you 
what this technology can do for your customers, your agents, and your call 
center.
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams
In this part, we cover recruiting; establishing job expectations; offering train-
ing, feedback, and support; and creating employee engagement. We also 
show you how to implement a simple five-step process that can guide the 
way you manage agents’ performance.
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement
In Part V, we explore the call center process and how to manage and improve 
it. In addition, we examine policies, procedures, and the effects of legislation 
and employment law on call centers. We also give you the scoop on master-
ing change, as well as details on various quality programs and certifications 
for call centers.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this part (a For Dummies classic), we offer tips and techniques that we’ve 
collected from the call center industry. These quick hits can give a boost to 
your company’s revenue and efficiency, employee morale, and customer sat-
isfaction. Even if you don’t read the rest of this book, check out this part!
Appendixes
Many industries use a language all their own, and the call center industry is 
no exception, so Appendix A provides a glossary of key call center concepts. 
Appendix B gives you access to support services such as call center associa-
tions, technology suppliers, and consultants.
Icons Used in This Book
We’ve placed several icons throughout this book to point out certain infor-
mation, and these icons have the following meanings.

e answer the question “What is a call center?” and 
explore what makes a good (or bad) call center. If 
you just want to know how call centers work, are thinking 
about working in one, or have ever had any aspirations to 
start a call center of your own, this is the part for you.
In this part, we introduce a business model for building a 
call center and relate that model to the larger corporate 
mission and goals. We examine the organizational struc-
ture, exploring the roles you need to fill to ensure that the 
center performs according to its business model and 
goals. We also discuss the logistics of building a call cen-
ter and some key factors to consider if you’re thinking 
about outsourcing your call center.

F
or years, Réal’s mom has been asking him, “What is it you do, again?” 
Well, here it is, Mom: He works in a call center. In fact, he works in a lot 
of call centers. Okay, okay — you don’t know what a call center is. Well, this 
chapter explains it all.
Defining Call Centers
Here’s a basic definition of a call center: When you call, say, an airline, cable-
television company, or bank, the person you deal with at the other end of the 
phone is a call center agent (or perhaps representative, consultant, or associ-
ate), and the office or department that this person works in is a call center. 
Sometimes, a call center consists of just one or two people sitting beside a 
phone, answering customer calls. Often, it’s a very large room that has a lot 
of people neatly organized in rows, sitting beside their phones, answering 
customer calls. To the customer, the call center is the voice of the com-
pany. If you’re angry, you often get mad at the person at the other end of the 
phone. After all, you’re talking to the company, right?
To the company, the call center is many things: cost center, profit center, 
key source of revenue, key source of frustration, strategic weapon, strategic 
disadvantage, source of marketing research, and source of marketing paraly-
sis. The role of the call center varies from company to company, depending 
on how closely the call center works with the parent or client organization to 
support the company’s goals and the ability of the call center itself.

Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Inbound, outbound, or blended
Call centers communicate with their customers in several ways, depending 
on the type of call center. Call centers fall into three main categories:
 
✓ Inbound: In an inbound call center, customers initiate the calls. 
Customers may make these calls to buy airline tickets, to get technical 
assistance with their personal computers, to get answers to questions 
about their utility bills, to get emergency assistance when their cars 
won’t start, to get advice from a nurse about minor medical issues, to 
buy insurance for their cars, or to talk to a company representative 
about any number of other situations.
 
✓ Outbound: In an outbound call center, agents of the company initiate 
calls to customers. Your first reaction might be “Telemarketing, right?” 
Well, yes, a company may call customers in its telemarketing campaign, 
but companies have a lot of other good reasons to call their customers. 
Companies may call because the customer hasn’t paid a bill or because 
a product that the customer wanted has become available; they may call 
to follow up on a problem that the customer was having or to find out 
what product or service enhancements the customer wants to see.
 
✓ Blended: Some call centers are blended operations, in which agents 
handle both inbound and outbound calls.
 
As we outline in Chapter 8, blending, done well, can make call center opera-
tions very cost efficient and can improve customer service as well.
Contact or call center: What’s in a name?
The explosion in popularity of the Internet and wireless technologies has 
changed the way people communicate. People still use the phone (although 
it’s frequently a cellphone these days), but they also communicate with 
friends, Romans, and Walmart by using e-mail, online chats, Web forums, 
and instant messaging. Call centers have responded to this change. In fact, 
they’re increasingly being called contact centers to reflect the fact that they 
handle more than just phone calls. These facilities are centers for customer 
contacts in whatever ways customers want to communicate: letters, faxes, 
Web chats, e-mails, and so on.
Another term that you may have heard is virtual call center, in which a group 
of agents work from their homes instead of being situated at workstations in 
a building operated by the organization. Some centers are a blend of at-home 
agents and on-site agents. Working from home is a fantastic arrangement for 
many employees: The hours are often flexible, and the job has no dress code 

11
 Chapter 1: A First Look at Call Centers
or commute. Virtual call centers can lower a company’s costs because they 
allow the company to optimize scheduling and spend less on real estate. (We 
explain scheduling in Chapter 8.)
Bottom line, each customer has to decide how he wants to communicate with 
the company, and the company has to respond appropriately through its 
contact center.
As with inbound and outbound call centers (refer to the preceding section), 
some companies choose to separate the handling of customer contacts by 
medium — a group for inbound calls, a group for outbound calls, a group for 
e-mail, and so on. Some call centers, especially those in smaller operations, 
have opted to create universal agents who handle all contact types. Call cen-
ters create universal contact agents for the same reasons that they blend 
inbound and outbound call-handling agents: efficiency and service.
 
This book is called Call Centers For Dummies, but we could just as easily have 
named it Contact Centers For Dummies. Throughout the book, we refer to call 
handling and call centers, partly because we grew up in call centers (well, not 
literally) and partly because phone calls still represent the bulk of communi-
cation between customers and companies. You can apply the concepts in this 
book to all types of contacts: phone calls, e-mails, online chats, instant mes-
sages, and even smoke signals.
Tripping Down Memory Lane: The 
Evolution of the Call Center
Although we can’t really tell you when the first call center opened, we imag-
ine that call centers started around the time that the telephone became a 
common household device.
The evolution of call centers just makes sense. A consumer can much more 
easily pick up a phone and call a company than she can start the car (or 
hitch up the horse), bundle up the kids, and go to town to arrange for the 
cable company to add extra channels. Likewise, for businesses like the cable 
company in this example, it’s much easier to do business over the phone 
than to have agents show up on the customer’s doorstep.
Consumers and businesses have used the phone as a way to do business for a 
long time. As a formal business discipline, however, using the phone to commu-
nicate with customers is not so old — maybe 30 years or so of development.

12
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Moving from low-tech to high-tech
Before the mid-1970s, airlines and major retailers used phone rooms — the 
precursors of call centers. Phone rooms were located in sites spread across 
the country or operated in large rooms that had lots of desks, phones with 
many extensions, and a lot of paper for tracking everything that was going 
on. We’re all too young to have seen these places ourselves, but people say 
that these rooms were very busy, noisy, and confusing.
One of the most significant advancements in call center technology was the 
invention of the automatic call distributor (ACD) by Rockwell International. 
The ACD made large, centralized call centers practical and efficient by pro-
viding a way to distribute large numbers of incoming phone calls evenly to a 
pool of call center staff. With the implementation of the ACD, the call center 
industry began, and the call center as a business discipline was off and run-
ning. We talk more about call center technology and technological advance-
ments in Chapters 9 and 10.
Moving from cost center to profit center
Most important to the call center industry, corporations have changed their 
view of the call center — from cost center and (in some cases) a necessary 
evil to profit center and competitive advantage. Today, business owners 
build entire companies around call center capability. You can buy a com-
puter from a company that doesn’t have a retail store, for example, or do 
your banking with a bank that doesn’t have physical branches. These busi-
nesses offer the telephone or Internet as customers’ only communication 
options.
Meeting legal and image challenges
Not everyone thinks that call center changes and evolution are positive, how-
ever. Partly because of the impact of call centers on everyone’s daily lives, 
and partly because some call centers had bad management and used bad 
business practices, some call centers have raised the ire of consumers and 
caught the attention of legislators.
Overly aggressive telemarketing practices, for example, have resulted in laws 
that regulate how sales are conducted over the telephone, whom telemarket-
ers can and can’t contact, and how telemarketers can contact those people. 
Governments even legislate how quickly some industries must answer incom-
ing calls — a response to the poor service and long delays that consumers 
experienced in the past.

13
 Chapter 1: A First Look at Call Centers
Call centers are also at the head of the outsourcing debate (see Chapter 5) 
because many companies are moving their call center operations offshore to 
countries that have well-qualified but less-expensive labor.
Additionally, privacy legislation has added a level of complexity to the way 
call centers can collect and use information about their customers, and sev-
eral countries are considering legislation that restricts how and where call 
centers can operate.
Poor business practices, as well as the success of the industry, have brought 
on some of the legislative challenges that call centers face. Explosive demand 
for call center services, both from business and consumers, has taxed the 
discipline’s ability to grow in size and capability while maintaining excel-
lence. Still, on balance, call centers continue to advance in number, capabil-
ity, sophistication, and excellence for two reasons: They’re effective and 
efficient business tools, and they satisfy increasing customer demand for 
convenience.
Today’s call centers: Ringing 
up big numbers
Today, the call center industry is an important part of the global economy. 
More than 55,000 call centers operate in North America alone, employ-
ing more than 6 million people (6 percent of the workforce). Consumers 
purchase more than $700 billion worth of goods and services through call 
centers every year, and that number is growing. You can purchase almost 
anything from the comfort of your home, office, car, or wherever you can get 
to a phone (or access the Internet).
Call centers continue to evolve at a dizzying pace. In an effort to gain greater 
efficiencies, provide better customer service, and generate more revenue, 
call centers are using more sophisticated technology, including customer 
information databases that give agents a better understanding of custom-
ers’ preferences, buying patterns, and desired products or services. Based 
on data collected about each customer, the system suggests options for that 
customer. This smart technology and its analytical tools give agents the best 
way to approach each customer as an individual.
Along with improving its use of technology, the call center community is 
improving its members’ knowledge and skills through trade associations, 
industry publications, trade shows, and specialized training and certification 
programs. In an effort to better manage people, processes, and technology, 
the industry has latched onto management approaches and philosophies that 
can give it an edge, including Customer Operations Performance Center, Inc. 
(COPC) and Six Sigma. We describe these programs in Chapter 17.

14
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Making Call Centers Work
You can’t easily manage a call center well, because call centers are complex 
places. It’s not just the technology; that’s the easy part! Call centers are a 
microcosm of business. To run a good call center, managers need to effec-
tively blend people, processes, and technology to produce a desired result.
 
Most call centers rely on people — often, a lot of people. Wages and salary 
typically comprise 60 percent to 70 percent of a call center’s budget.
Because customers can ask almost anything of the call center, agents need to 
have at their fingertips information on just about all the company’s policies, 
procedures, products, and services. With a huge volume and variety of cus-
tomers, a call center gets a lot of activity. Even if you have the best technology 
available to smooth things out, when you’re dealing with hundreds or thou-
sands of calls each day, the slightest bottleneck can add up to a big problem.
 
In fact, a 1-second increase in call length in a call center that answers 1 million 
calls a year creates an additional 280 hours of work requiring approximately 
380 additional hours of staffing. (We explain the math in Chapter 6.)
Identifying good call center managers
Good call center managers have the following characteristics:
 
✓ They have a strong sense of purpose.
 
✓ They understand their roles within the organization.
 
✓ They have clear, measurable targets and goals, and understand how to 
reach those goals.
 
✓ They’re part analyst, part accountant, part engineer, part psychologist, 
part cheerleader, and part coach, effectively blending human resources, 
process management, and technology without limiting themselves or 
indulging too much in any one discipline.
For more information on the call center manager’s role, see Chapter 3.
Defining the culture
Because call centers rely so much on people, managers need to define and 
create a supportive culture to make sure that the call center can operate 
successfully. Think of a supportive culture as being one that clearly defines 
the values and beliefs that support the call center’s mission. (We talk about 
developing a mission in Chapter 2.)

15
 Chapter 1: A First Look at Call Centers
To make the call center’s mission and values come alive, managers are 
responsible for modeling the right behaviors. As a manager, you should com-
municate goals and rewards so that they line up with the call center’s mis-
sion, vision, and values, and thereby help create the desired culture.
Understanding What Makes 
Call Centers Good or Bad
A good call center has a strong culture in which people work from a common 
set of values and beliefs, with a common purpose and a strong focus on busi-
ness goals. Management needs to continually align everything that the call 
center does with the company’s goals and desired culture.
Generally, as Figure 1-1 illustrates, your call center should have four main 
goals:
 
✓ Efficiency: Cost-effective operations for the organization. This area 
includes both operating the call center and completing core tasks for 
the organization (see Chapters 5–8, 11, 15, and 20).
 
✓ Revenue generation: Everything that leads to revenue, such as selling, 
upgrading, collecting, retaining current customers, and regaining lost 
customers (see Chapter 15).
 
✓ Customer satisfaction: Really long-term revenue generation, such as 
building customer loyalty and keeping customers (see Chapters 15, 16, 
and 17). Call centers should make things easy for customers. Whenever 
a customer needs it, the call center should be available, and agents 
should have access to all the information necessary to answer customer 
questions.
 
✓ Employee satisfaction: A measure of how happy employees are with 
their jobs and working environment (see Chapters 13, 14, 16, 18, and 20). 
In our experience, happy workers are more productive, take fewer days 
off, and stay loyal to the company.
 
These four goals are interdependent. Good revenue generation can’t happen 
without some level of efficiency, for example; only satisfied customers con-
tinue to buy a product; and motivated employees promote the business effec-
tively. We discuss the four goals in more detail in Chapter 2.

When a call center is working properly, it exhibits the following traits:
 
✓ Focuses on its business goals.
 
✓ Answers phone calls and e-mails quickly.
 
✓ Has high employee morale.
 
✓ Resolves a high percentage of customer inquiries on the first contact.
 
✓ Measures customer satisfaction as a service indicator and has high cus-
tomer satisfaction scores.
 
✓ Provides a significant source of revenue for the organization.
 
✓ Has an effective process for collecting and presenting data on perfor-
mance. Everyone knows where he or she stands monthly, daily, hourly, 
and even in real time.
 
✓ Works efficiently. Employees need to do little follow-up on the customer 
file after the customer has hung up. Calls last for a consistent length of 
time and require a minimum of customer time to achieve resolution.
 
✓ Keeps everyone engaged and busy with a purpose, with no one being 
overly taxed.
 
✓ Improves processes continually to make gains in service, efficiency, and 
revenue generation.
 
✓ Enables the corporation to see the call center as a strategic advantage — 
an ally to the rest of the organization.

 Chapter 1: A First Look at Call Centers
Characteristics of a poor call center
A call center that doesn’t function well probably displays the following 
characteristics:
 
✓ Creates long hold times for customers waiting to get through to the 
next available agent (and when those customers do reach a call center 
employee, they’re frequently transferred or put on hold).
 
✓ Deals with customer issues that frequently require multiple contacts 
before they’re resolved.
 
✓ Breeds harried staff members running from crisis to crisis, putting out 
fires but not getting ahead.
 
✓ Lacks understanding of metrics or performance.
 
✓ Scores low on customer satisfaction or has no way to measure customer 
satisfaction at all.
 
✓ Lacks the appetite to improve working conditions to stay competitive 
and retain employees.
 
✓ Experiences low employee morale and high turnover.
 
✓ Generates complaints by corporate executives and senior management 
about costs or sales and service results. Some executives may talk about 
outsourcing the operation.
A well-run call center doesn’t happen by accident. Good people need to do 
good planning and good execution. This book gives you the strategies, prac-
tices, plans, and skills to control what your call center produces.

Business Basics: Models and 
Drivers and Goals, Oh My!
In This Chapter
▶ Building a framework for your call center
▶ Zeroing in on the appropriate goals
▶ Employing performance drivers
▶ Following best practices
▶ Reporting results
A
 business model is a high-level description of how your business is orga-
nized and what actions you plan to take to produce results for your 
business: profits, happy customers, or whatever you want to achieve in your 
business unit. A business model is really no more complicated than a game 
plan or playbook (“Our goal is to win the game, so here’s what we’re going to 
do”).
The call center business model that we lay out in this chapter attempts to 
align the call center’s mission, objectives (goals), performance drivers, and 
business practices. In our experience, good performance usually results 
when call centers are truly aligned with their mission and objectives. Add 
to this alignment a strong supportive culture, and you can really increase 
results.
 
Like game plans, business models change and evolve. Over time, your model 
becomes outdated, or you find better ways to run your call center, resulting in 
a need to modify the plan. But you need to have a plan to modify.

Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Creating a Call Center Business Model
Creating a business model involves understanding cause and effect (do this, 
and that will happen). The better your understanding of cause and effect, the 
better you can make your model, and if you have a good model, you probably 
get good results. This book deals primarily with this pursuit of cause and 
effect.
Business models vary in the amount of detail that they provide. Some are 
very general and provide only a low level of detail; others are incredibly 
sophisticated, including complex economic models that forecast business 
results. A call center’s business model should include
 
✓ A statement of mission and vision for the call center.
 
✓ Identification of the business goals, or outputs, that you want the call 
center to produce in the next year.
 
✓ An economic model made up of the key variables, or performance driv-
ers, that affect your call center’s business goals. (We explain perfor-
mance drivers such as occupancy, conversion per contact, and cost per 
call in Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Identification of the business practices that affect performance drivers (fre-
quently organized in the categories of people, process, and technology).
 
✓ Identification and creation of a supporting culture.
 
✓ A feedback mechanism.
What makes business models so important? History is full of examples of 
a superior opponent falling to an underdog who had a plan. In 1974, for 
example, the immensely powerful boxer George Foreman lost the world 
heavyweight crown to Muhammad Ali, who successfully used his rope-a-dope 
strategy to win the title.
In business, few companies can find investors if they don’t have a sound 
business plan. Oddly, call centers in successful companies frequently don’t 
have a well-thought-out game plan. As a result, their operations suffer from 
inconsistent service delivery, high costs, and less-than-optimal revenue 
generation. Typically, these operations have the necessary tools and talent 
to achieve their goals; they just need a well-defined business model to help 
them improve their results.
Figure 2-1 shows a sample of such a model.

Lack of model = lack of results
A while ago, Réal and his team had an inter-
esting consulting assignment. The president of 
a successful retail company, which we’ll call 
PQR Co., approached Réal about PQR’s call 
center. For years, the call center had been pro-
ducing terrible service and experiencing ever-
increasing costs.
The team conducted a fairly quick assessment, 
interviewing management and staff, analyz-
ing data, surveying customers, and generally 
reviewing the call center’s entire process. It 
discovered a call center filled with great tools 
and smart people — frustrated smart people 
who knew too well that the call center wasn’t 
operating in a cohesive way.

Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Developing your mission
A mission statement is an articulation of overall purpose — your call center’s 
raison d’être. It’s a quick, concise description of your department’s purpose, 
telling the world what the center does and why it does it.
Mission statements vary in length and content, but a one- or two-sentence 
statement can suffice if the mission statement is part of a bigger overall busi-
ness model, because the business model adds detail to the mission. Declaring 
the company’s purpose is a leadership responsibility, and the mission should 
inspire employees to do the right thing.
Some people believe that you create a mission statement as a participative 
exercise, involving input from senior management, call center management, 
employees, and even suppliers or customers. Others believe that creating a 
call center mission statement as a group exercise amounts to management 
by committee. If the resulting mission doesn’t meet senior management’s 
requirements, the mission becomes irrelevant.
 
We think that senior management — those in the corporation to whom the call 
center reports — should deliver the mission statement, because the mission 
statement amounts to the call center’s marching orders. Most organizations 
set goals and expectations at a senior level and filter those responsibilities 
down.
Mission statements typically include the following elements:
 
✓ Statement of purpose: What the organization and its employees are here 
to do
Interestingly, the employees at PQR had a 
very high level of sophistication about call 
center concepts and practices. They tracked 
all the measures, and then some; they had a 
lot of training and knew a lot about how call 
centers worked; and they had a great deal of 
support, both financial and moral, from senior 
management.
So why didn’t the call center get good results? 
PQR lacked only a coordinated business model, 
but it was lacking in a big way. Management and 
staff had no focus. Most management activities 
dealt with crises. Management always quickly 
replaced one important initiative with another. 
Priorities changed frequently, based on what 
senior management was focusing on. Few 
senior managers seemed to be on the same 
page. The front-line staff recognized the prob-
lems; many sympathized with their managers, 
who were pulled in every direction. Because of 
the lack of focus, the call center got inconsis-
tent results at high costs.
Réal’s team introduced a simple business model 
to PQR’s call center. Within three months, costs 
were down, revenue was up, and customer 
satisfaction had improved. Equally important, 
the call center staff was more energized and 
motivated.

 Chapter 2: Business Basics: Models and Drivers and Goals, Oh My!
 
✓ Statement of values: What the organization’s rules of behavior and cor-
porate beliefs are
 
✓ Statement of competitive positioning: What the organization does really 
well
 
✓ Vision statement: What the organization’s future looks like
 
✓ Stakeholder expectations: What’s at stake for everyone involved
 
You don’t need to include all these elements in the mission statement, but you 
do need to address them somewhere in the business model. At minimum, a 
mission statement should include the statement of purpose, vision statement, 
and stakeholder expectations.
Dissecting a typical call center mission
A call center mission might look something like this:
Our mission is to maximize value to XYZ Corp., our customers, and our 
employees by providing the highest-value call center services available 
in our industry. We are a learning organization that constantly improves. 
As a result, the call center will become a competitive advantage for XYZ 
Corp., leading the industry in cost control, revenue generation, and cus-
tomer satisfaction.
This mission statement has a few parts that deserve explanation:
 
✓ To maximize value to XYZ Corp., our customers, and our employees: 
This phrase speaks to stakeholders. Maximizing value suggests that 
you’ll work to achieve what each stakeholder wants out of the relation-
ship with the call center. This phrase suggests that senior management 
has measured and understand expectations. The word value allows 
the mission statement to define, through the business model, what the 
stakeholders see as being valuable.
 
✓ The highest-value call center services available: This phrase suggests 
not that the call center will be the cheapest operation, but that it will 
deliver the most productivity for the money, creating an opportunity to 
balance cost control, revenue generation, and customer satisfaction.
 
✓ We are a learning organization: This phrase identifies the long-term 
result of consistently following the mission and business model.
Overall, this mission statement provides a neat way to launch into your busi-
ness model, and you can use it to quickly explain what your call center is 
trying to do.

24
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
 
The mission describes the message that your senior management, both in the 
call center and in the corporation, should repeat regularly. If you say it often 
enough, fairly soon you’ll start to achieve your mission without doing a lot of 
specific micromanagement, because people will gravitate to your overriding 
purpose.
Mission statements should stand the test of time, so you shouldn’t have to 
change them very often. When you do change them, you should do so as the 
result of a shift in corporate strategy — changing the call center’s focus from 
a cost center to a profit center, for example.
 
When Réal and his team first began work with PQR (refer to the sidebar “Lack 
of model = lack of results”), no one could articulate the call center’s mission. 
How did Réal’s team anticipate that this lack of definition might cause a prob-
lem? During their initial interview with senior management, the managers said, 
“We don’t have a mission.” As the saying goes, if you don’t know where you’re 
going, any road can take you there.
Determining Your Business Goals
In the short term, the organization has specific deliverables — goals and tar-
gets that it wants the call center to achieve. The company needs these deliv-
erables, which generally relate to efficiency, revenue generation, customer 
satisfaction, and employee satisfaction, and which always support the call 
center’s mission. The call center is a microcosm of the organization. If the 
call center achieves its goals, this success feeds into the organization’s goals 
and contributes to the success of the organization. Companies frequently set 
these deliverables once per year, coinciding with the annual corporate bud-
geting process.
You can make your mission more specific — and achievable — by defining 
the call center’s goals. Business goals measure call center effectiveness and 
the organization’s progress against the four broad areas addressed in the 
mission statement: efficiency, revenue generation, customer satisfaction, 
and employee satisfaction (refer to “Understanding What Makes Call Centers 
Good or Bad” in Chapter 1).
Senior management provides these business goals to the call center, but ide-
ally, the call center has some input, if only to make sure that the goals are 
realistic.
 
Don’t just pull business goals out of the air; you need to think them through 
and justify them. When you define goals well, you can use them as gauges that 
tell you about the performance of your call center, like the gauges in an air-
plane. On the other hand, the old phrase “Garbage in, garbage out” rings very 
true of operational goals. Set bad goals, and you’ll probably get bad results.

25
 Chapter 2: Business Basics: Models and Drivers and Goals, Oh My!
 
In the case of PQR Co. (refer to the sidebar “Lack of model = lack of results”), 
when Réal’s team asked company agents what their measurable goals were, 
they produced a lot of measures, including cost per call, average speed of 
answer, and call length. No one could say which goals were most important, 
however, and no one seemed to be clear on the right target for each goal. 
Overall, PQR Co. lacked clear direction from senior management about which 
goals to focus on.
Specific goals vary by company. Table 2-1 shows a few examples and explains 
how to measure and interpret them.

Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Defining a good objective
Here are a couple of important characteristics of good business objectives:
 
✓ They’re measurable.
 
✓ They tell a complete story.
Ideally, a measurable goal tells you as much about an area of the business as 
possible. If you use total call center costs to measure cost control, for exam-
ple, you can figure out the costs associated with running the call center, but 
you can’t really tell whether the cost is expensive. Understanding this cost in 
relation to the number of customers, however, provides some context. A call 
center that costs $1 million per year but has only one customer, for example, 
is a lot more expensive than a call center that costs $50 million per year but 
has millions of customers. The most valuable measures tell you about your 
success without having to refer to other numbers.
You can measure goals as follows:
 
✓ Cost per customer (efficiency): Total cost of running the call center 
divided by total customers.
 
✓ Revenue generated per customer: Total revenue generated by the call 
center divided by the number of customers.
 
✓ Customer satisfaction: How satisfied customers are with their call 
center experience. Customer satisfaction can be measured through post-
call surveys, surveys done by a third party, or focus groups. (We discuss 
customer satisfaction in Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Employee satisfaction: How satisfied call center employees are with 
their jobs. Employee satisfaction is usually measured through surveys 
and focus groups. (We talk about employee surveys in Chapter 18.)
 
You can come up with no end of business measures. Just make sure that those 
measures tell you what you want to know about your operation.
Avoiding misleading measures
When you establish how to measure your business goals, avoid using some 
common call center measures that don’t tell the complete story and, there-
fore, can be misleading:
 
✓ Operating budget: The operating budget — how much you spend to 
run the call center — is a misleading measure. Most companies want to 
minimize the total cost of running their center, but if the company grows 

27
 Chapter 2: Business Basics: Models and Drivers and Goals, Oh My!
by 50 percent or 100 percent per year, the call center is likely to cost 
more while the company grows. Looking at the call center budget can be 
misleading when you’re considering cost control, because you need to 
consider costs in relation to growth of the call center.
 
✓ Cost per call: Another misleading measure is cost per call, which is 
simply the cost of running a call center for a given period divided by the 
number of calls answered during the same period.
 
 A cost-per-call measure can be misleading because it doesn’t consider 
the effect of poor client interaction and repeat calls. If you overempha-
size cost per call, you may tend to focus too strictly on keeping call 
times low — sometimes at the expense of good customer service. If 
agents don’t do a good job of handling customer calls, rushing custom-
ers off the phone before they can satisfactorily resolve the customers’ 
inquiries, customers will probably call back — or switch to the competi-
tion. Although your cost per call may appear to be low, a large number 
of callbacks increases your overall cost per customer.
 
✓ First-call resolution: Although first-call resolution (FCR) is a good mea-
sure of customer satisfaction, it can be misleading, because different 
companies have different measures for FCR. If a customer calls back 
within 48 hours of his first call, for example, some companies would con-
sider this call to be a repeat call; other companies may use a different 
time frame for a repeat call, such as 72 hours or 1 week.
 
 Also, most companies don’t have the technology to link the reason for 
a call to a callback. If a client calls her bank to make a deposit and then 
calls back after 24 hours to make a withdrawal, the bank may not have 
the technology to tell that the two calls were unrelated and is likely to 
count the second call as a repeat call, thus inaccurately counting the 
first call as not being resolved.
 
 Similarly, in some situations, a call center has no control over the 
reason for repeat calls on the same issue. If a customer called to make 
a purchase but realized that he didn’t have his credit card handy, for 
example, he may decide to call back or to go online to complete this 
transaction. Such a callback would decrease the call center’s FCR rate.
Considering service level
You may be thinking, “What about that grand dame of call center measures, 
service level?” Service level — defined as the percentage of incoming calls 
answered in a specified amount of time — is probably the most-talked-about 
standard for inbound call centers (refer to Chapter 1). It actually refers to 
how fast agents answer the phone, which has implications for customer satis-
faction and total call center cost.

28
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Service level directly measures the accessibility of your organization to 
your customers. It not only provides a good overall indicator of caller treat-
ment, but also provides the foundation for the most fundamental activities 
in a call center: planning, staffing, and execution. The service-level objective 
you choose will directly influence the number of people you hire, how many 
people you need to have on the phone during each hour of the day, and when 
you need to implement a real-time disaster recovery plan. (See Chapter 4 for 
details on business continuity and Chapter 8 for information on scheduling.)
Service level balances customer tolerances for time spent waiting to speak 
with the next available agent; the cost of providing service; and the revenue 
opportunity that you lose when customers hang up, never to call again. 
Therefore, service level is a performance driver — that is, it has a direct 
effect on your call center’s performance — but you can’t classify it as an 
actual goal. Rather, it’s a variable that will help you achieve your goals.
 
For more information on performance drivers such as service level, see 
Chapter 6.
Flowing goals through 
the accountability funnel
Well-defined goals not only keep the stakeholders happy, but also affect the 
whole organization, so they shouldn’t be created in isolation. Establishing, 
applying, and communicating appropriate goals to every manager, team 
leader, department, and employee increases accountability at every level and 
creates a very focused organization, as illustrated in Figure 2-2.

accountabil-
ity funnel.

Call center goals

29
 Chapter 2: Business Basics: Models and Drivers and Goals, Oh My!
Your goals must keep everyone accountable to, and focused on, the appro-
priate performance drivers. If you communicate thoroughly, everyone in the 
organization will understand how he or she can contribute to meeting those 
goals. If you don’t, you may cause confusion, and your team won’t work 
together to meet the goals.
 
Make your goals well defined and robust. Ask yourself, “If I achieve these goals 
or make constant improvements toward reaching these goals, can I achieve 
my mission? Will my stakeholders in the corporation be happy?” If you can 
answer yes, you’re on the right track.
Measuring Progress with 
Performance Drivers
You derive your business objectives — the goals and targets that you’re trying 
to produce — from your mission. If you want to use your business objectives 
to manage your call center toward success, you need a good understand-
ing of how to manage and control a business objective. This understanding 
comes through performance drivers.
Performance drivers are processes and behaviors — expressed as measures — 
that help you achieve your business goals. Average call length, for example (the 
amount of time required to fully answer a customer inquiry), is a driver of call 
center costs and has a direct effect on the business goal of cost per customer, so 
average call length is a driver of cost.
Performance drivers make up the building blocks of the operation, and by 
analyzing them, you can mathematically model the business goals, budgets, 
profit-and-loss goals, and other aspects of operations, thereby creating the 
economic model for your call center. Performance drivers are like the levers 
that you push and pull to steer the call center ship toward its objectives.
If you drop by a call center, you’re likely to hear discussions of some of these 
performance drivers:
 
✓ Service level: How fast agents answer phone calls, e-mail messages, 
and so on. You can express this driver in a variety of ways, but it’s most 
commonly measured by the percentage of incoming calls answered in a 
specified amount of time. If the call center answers 78 percent of all calls 
taken within 30 seconds of the calls entering the queue, for example, the 
service level achieved is 78/30. Service level affects cost, revenue, and 
customer satisfaction.
 
✓ Average call length: How long it takes, on average, to process one cus-
tomer interaction.

30
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
 
✓ Agent occupancy: The percentage of time that agents are busy process-
ing customer calls rather than waiting for the next call.
 
✓ Agent availability: How many of your agents are actually available to 
take a call (meaning that they’re not already busy on a call) and, there-
fore, aren’t generating revenue.
 
✓ Schedule adherence: The percentage of time that your agents are actu-
ally on the phone during the time when they’re scheduled to be on the 
phone.
 
✓ Conversion rate: The percentage of contacts that the call center con-
verts to sales.
 
✓ Retention rate: The percentage of customers whom the call center per-
suaded to stay (retained) when those customers attempted to cancel 
their relationship with the company.
 
✓ Customer satisfaction: How satisfied your customers are with the level of 
service that your call center provides. This driver is often measured by 
way of a customer survey and is sometimes expressed as a percentage.
 
✓ FCR: The percentage of callers who don’t have to call back within a cer-
tain time frame (usually, a day) to have their issue resolved.
 
In Chapter 6, we review other exciting call center–related stuff that you can 
measure.
By managing performance drivers, you can affect the outcomes of your busi-
ness goals. Much of the information in this book, in fact, deals with how to 
manipulate drivers effectively to get desired results, such as the following:
 
✓ Make customers happy, and improve customer satisfaction scores. 
Answer the phone quickly, be nice to callers, and give them prompt and 
complete service. We talk about how to make customers happy and 
improve customer satisfaction scores in Chapter 15.
 
✓ Reduce the cost of handling calls. Reduce average call length, reduce 
the cost of your service, and make sure that you keep your agents busy 
while they’re available to answer the phones. See Part II for more infor-
mation on improving efficiency.
 
In the PQR Co. example (refer to the sidebar “Lack of model = lack of results,” 
earlier in this chapter), the company tracked all the necessary measurable 
factors relating to its call center. Management didn’t see a clear relationship 
between the performance drivers and the business objectives, however. As a 
result, managers didn’t work in a coordinated and consistent fashion to effect 
results through manipulation of the drivers; instead, they focused on some 
performance drivers one day and on others the next day. Because of this scat-
tershot approach, they got mixed results.

31
 Chapter 2: Business Basics: Models and Drivers and Goals, Oh My!
Categorizing the drivers
As we discuss in Chapter 1, performance drivers fall into four categories:
 
✓ Efficiency
 
✓ Revenue generation
 
✓ Customer satisfaction
 
✓ Employee satisfaction
 
Which driver is most important to your business depends on your organiza-
tion’s goals and the priorities that you’ve established for the call center.
Efficiency
Your call center likely comes under the cost-control microscope often, even 
though call centers tend to offer a very efficient way to communicate with 
massive volumes of customers. Still, corporations frequently have large call 
center expenditures, so executives have reason to scrutinize those costs.
Items that affect the efficiency of your call center include
 
✓ Call length
 
✓ Agent occupancy (defined in “Measuring Progress with Performance 
Drivers,” earlier in this chapter)
 
✓ Average cost of making an agent available to answer the phones (wages, 
benefits, management costs, and so on)
 
✓ Repeat calls from customers who don’t get an accurate or complete 
answer on the first call
 
✓ Nonproduction time (time that agents spend away from the phone, 
which is measured through schedule adherence)
 
✓ Frequent agent sick leave, absence, and turnover
 
You should scrutinize these items in great detail because they will help you 
achieve your call center’s goals. Looking at the drivers of cost control is just a 
start in improving efficiency.
Call center managers who have very good control of their results dig deep 
into these aspects of operations to better understand why they achieve the 
results that they do and how to affect those results in the future. Call length, 
for example, can be broken down into time spent talking with the customer 

32
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
and postcall work (such as time spent processing customer requests after 
the customer is no longer on the line). You can better understand both 
aspects of call length when you consider what call lengths result from differ-
ent types of calls — an information call versus a sales call, for example.
A full-time business analyst can research cost-control drivers to identify 
opportunities to improve efficiencies, especially in a relatively large call 
center. (See Chapter 15 for more information on this worthwhile endeavor.)
Revenue generation
It don’t mean a thing if you ain’t got cha-ching! Improvement in your call 
center’s revenue generation can have a greater effect on margins than 
improvements in cost-control measures. In relatively large call centers, small 
improvements in retention rate (keeping customers who call to cancel ser-
vice) represent hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in saved 
revenue. Similarly, small improvements in selling and upselling (attempting 
to have the customer purchase an upgrade, an add-on, or a more expensive 
item) can represent hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.
In addition to your retention rate, consider these key revenue metrics, or 
measures for quantitatively assessing revenue generation:
 
✓ Conversion rate (the number of sales made per contacts handled)
 
✓ Revenue generated per sale
 
✓ Cancellations per call (a variation on retention rate)
 
✓ Revenue lost per cancellation (a measure of the total revenue lost 
divided by the number of cancellations)
Only when you focus on efficiency and revenue generation with equal dedica-
tion and discipline can you experience real improvements in profit.
Customer satisfaction
Some call centers are getting good — very good — at understanding what 
makes customers happy. Unfortunately, not all of them are good at actually 
doing what it takes to make customers happy.
Here are some metrics to measure:
 
✓ How fast agents answer the phone, including average speed of answer 
and service level (refer to “Considering service level,” earlier in this 
chapter).
 
✓ How customers rate their experiences in a postcontact survey. (See 
Chapter 10 for more about surveys and Chapter 15 for details on devel-
oping a customer-experience blueprint.)

33
 Chapter 2: Business Basics: Models and Drivers and Goals, Oh My!
Employee satisfaction
As we discuss in Chapter 6, your employees can tell you in your monthly 
employee opinion survey what they see as being employee satisfaction driv-
ers. Start by asking general questions about job satisfaction; then ask open-
ended questions about the most and least satisfying aspects of the job. In 
subsequent surveys, include questions about management’s performance 
in relation to the satisfying (and dissatisfying) factors identified in the ear-
lier survey. These points will definitely come up in these surveys as key 
employee satisfaction drivers:
 
✓ Team-leader support: Are your employees getting the help that they 
need?
 
✓ Feedback: Do they know where they stand in meeting their job expecta-
tions and performance standards?
 
✓ Training: Are they getting the training that they need to do the job well?
Why is employee opinion important?
Your mom probably always said that you should 
be nice to the people you meet. She meant the 
people you work with, too.
You have a lot of good business reasons to treat 
employees well. For one, you spend a lot of time 
and money to attract and train good people. If 
those people leave your company to go work for 
nicer people, you have to attract and train more 
people (who will probably leave you too). Even 
if they don’t quit, unhappy people don’t see the 
need to work hard to meet company goals. The 
employee who mentally quits but stays on your 
payroll can cost your business a lot of money.
Also, in our experience, happy employees 
create happy customers.
Réal and his team once consulted for two com-
petitors in the same industry. Neither business 
knew that the team was working with the other 
business, and neither benefited from the work that 
the team did with the other business. Still, Réal’s 
team took away some valuable knowledge.
These companies sold virtually the same prod-
ucts for approximately the same prices and had 
customers in the same location. Customers had 
to communicate regularly with each company 
through the call center. In the first company, 
employees were very happy and rated their job 
satisfaction as very high. Employee turnover 
was modest. In the second company, employ-
ees weren’t so happy, so morale was rather 
dark, and employee turnover was high.
As far as the team could tell, this difference in 
employee satisfaction was the most significant 
difference between the two companies. When 
they looked at performance data, however, they 
were shocked. The second company had nearly 
double the rate of customer cancellations and a 
significantly lower customer opinion score than 
the first company. Not surprisingly, the average 
revenue per customer was much lower in the 
second company.
This story is far from a scientific study, but it 
goes to show you that being nice is good for 
business.

Balancing the drivers
To create a good operation, attempt to strike a perfect balance among effi-
ciency, revenue generation, customer satisfaction, and employee satisfaction.
The challenge is that many companies emphasize one of these four areas more 
than the others, which causes confusion. If you applaud and reward only sales, 
for example, the other measures will be left by the wayside, causing imbalance. 
To achieve balance, you have to promote and celebrate behaviors that help 
employees understand how their actions affect each area.
Table 2-2 summarizes some basic call center business goals and the corre-
sponding performance drivers that affect them.

 Chapter 2: Business Basics: Models and Drivers and Goals, Oh My!
The following sections provide tips on managing each driver.
Don’t go overboard on efficiency
You’ve taken your quest for efficiency too far if you
 
✓ Hire people who are unsuited for the job (perhaps because they work 
for less money than more-qualified people would).
 
✓ Skimp on training.
 
✓ Don’t make time for coaching.
 
✓ Don’t spend enough on support services.
 
A business can benefit from greatly reduced labor costs by taking a call center 
offshore to a far-off country such as India or the Philippines. General Electric, 
which helped popularize this trend, conducted its move offshore in a well-
orchestrated, well-planned fashion. Eager to capture similar benefits, many 
companies moved their call center operations offshore without the same 
level of planning and, in some cases, got less-than-ideal results. Delta Airlines, 
for example, canceled its offshoring in Asia because its customers were very 
vocal in their disapproval of foreign customer service agents. Some of these 
companies suffered more in terms of lost customers, lost revenue opportuni-
ties, and additional costs of repeat calls than they gained in reduced employ-
ment costs. In these cases, an overzealous desire to cut costs resulted in 
increased overall cost to the organization.
Avoid a surplus of service
You need good customer service, but you need a larger goal than just making 
customers like you. Customers want call center agents to perform a service, 
not to be their best pals. Granted, you can find people who want to spend 
extraordinary amounts of time on the phone with their favorite call centers, 
but you have to admit that those people are probably not very common.
 
You’d probably have to spend way too much money to ensure that ten agents 
are always available, waiting for the next call, so that they can answer every 
customer call after the first ring. Your average customer is used to waiting 
at least 20 to 30 seconds before an agent answers. Just try to respond to 
your customers faster than your competitors do instead of worrying about a 
number that someone set in-house. This goal will help you keep service level 
in perspective.
If you overemphasize service, employees can believe that trying to sell the 
customer something is bad or that keeping transactions quick and efficient 
can make the customer dislike employees. In our experience, most customers 
want efficient and professional resolution of their calls, and polite and courte-
ous service.

36
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Resist revenue-generation mania
If an agent fails to resolve a long-term customer’s service concern but makes 
great attempts to close in for more sales, that customer can get angry, 
become disengaged from the conversation, and perhaps even decide not to 
do business with your company.
Although you need an overall focus on revenue generation, overemphasizing 
short-term revenue gain probably leads to long-term service pain because 
your call center loses the lifetime value of a loyal customer.
Don’t focus on entertaining employees
You can overemphasize making employees happy if your management team 
attempts to turn the call center into a love-in. In an effort to ensure high 
employee morale, some companies live with the motto “Try not to upset 
anyone.” If you adopt that motto, you’ll probably end up hurting your call 
center’s performance.
People need feedback and coaching on how to do their jobs better. Over 
time, a fair, honest, and consistent approach wins as much in the morale 
wars as a soft hand does, if not more, because it keeps the organization on 
track to meet its goals.
 
You have to accept the fact that not every employee is going to be happy all 
the time. Unsurprisingly, the unhappiest employees are often those who don’t 
do a good job.
Carrying Out Call Center Best Practices
If you’ve read the earlier sections of this chapter, you’ve developed your mis-
sion — the reason why the call center exists — or asked senior management 
Killing ’em with kindness
Some time ago, Réal was touring a call center 
and listening to agents on the phones. One 
fellow tried so hard to make the customer like 
him that he virtually held the customer hos-
tage. Despite the customer’s best efforts, she 
couldn’t get off the phone with this agent. You 
could hear the pain in the customer’s voice as 
she feigned interest, not wanting to be rude 
to this nice fellow who was regaling her with 
information about everything from the weather 
in northern Alberta to the dietary habits of his 
Aunt Martha’s cat. Interestingly, but not sur-
prisingly, this agent had very high call times, 
moderate customer satisfaction scores, and 
dismal sales results.

37
 Chapter 2: Business Basics: Models and Drivers and Goals, Oh My!
to provide a mission. You’ve also established your business goals — what 
the corporation needs from the call center right now. Finally, you’ve gained 
understanding of the levers or variables that we call performance drivers, 
which directly affect your business goals.
At this point, the parts of your business model should begin to align. In a sort 
of “the leg bone is connected to the knee bone” arrangement, the mission is 
connected to business goals, business goals are connected to performance 
drivers, and performance drivers are connected to business practices.
Business practices are the procedures and policies — the specific things that 
people in the call center do every day — that affect the efficiency, revenue, 
customer service, and employee morale drivers of the operation, which in 
turn affect your call center’s business goals.
 
To meet your goals, consider developing business practices as a continuous 
cycle.
Any call center performs many key practices to ensure success, as we dis-
cuss in Chapter 1. You can categorize all these practices and procedures 
under three headings:
 
✓ People: Employ skilled people, and use the best performance-management 
methods to continue to make those people improve so that they produce 
better results over time.
 
✓ Process: Define, refine, and continuously improve work processes so 
that you improve your business drivers.
 
✓ Technology: Automate efficient, well-defined processes by using appro-
priate technology to improve driver performance over time.
We discuss all three categories in the following sections.
Focusing on people
Dealing with people is an important aspect of call centers. Folks who want 
stuff often need to talk to folks who sell (or know about, or provide support 
for) that stuff. If you have enough people asking, seeking, or buying — as 
when Madonna concert tickets go on sale, for example — you need a lot of 
people taking those orders. Sure, customers can order tickets and look for 
information on the Internet, but a great number of them still want to talk to 
an actual person about making their purchase.

38
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Generally, the people who are inquiring, ordering, or looking for help want to 
encounter someone who has a courteous, professional, polite, and friendly 
manner. You can fulfill that desire almost solely by having great people work-
ing in your call center.
You need to establish the appropriate roles, responsibilities, skills, and 
accountabilities to meet your call center goals. Include clearly defined job 
descriptions for all roles throughout your call center’s organizational chart. 
Also, hire the best people that you can. In Chapter 3, we discuss organiza-
tional design, the key roles, and the importance of work culture in the call 
center; in Chapter 12, we talk more about hiring the right people; and in 
Chapter 13, we talk about the importance of developing skills through good 
leadership and coaching.
 
No matter how impeccable your processes are or how tantalizing your tech-
nology is, without the right people working for your call center, you’re headed 
down the road to mediocrity.
Focusing on process
Any business needs to have the right processes in place to make things 
happen the way they’re supposed to, but you especially need the correct 
setup if you want to run an effective call center.
Process refers to how work gets done — the organization of tasks for inputs, 
which are anything that you put into a system or that’s used in its operation, 
and outputs, which are the results. Call centers are very procedure-driven; 
in fact, some of the biggest success stories in call center management come 
from improvements in processes. A more efficient way to schedule staff, a 
quicker way to service specific types of customer calls, and a better training 
procedure are all process changes that can have tremendous effects on call 
center results.
 
Many call centers seek out quality-control programs, such as International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification, and call center–specific 
standards, such as Customer Operations Performance Center, Inc. (COPC) 
certification. The call center industry also largely accepts Six Sigma, a process-
oriented management discipline. We talk more about these programs in 
Chapter 17.

39
 Chapter 2: Business Basics: Models and Drivers and Goals, Oh My!
 
For virtually every business practice in the operation, you need to ensure that 
your team develops (and follows) a systematic method to make order from 
the chaos that a call center can sometimes produce.
Improving process
Process is a call center business practice in which you can always find room 
for improvement. Fortunately, call centers generally respond well to an envi-
ronment of continuous improvement, as we discuss in Chapter 15. In fact, 
because of the dynamic character of the call center industry, you may want to 
include a process for managing changes — sometimes called, appropriately 
enough, a change management process — in your defined business practices.
Call centers probably grew out of the need for better processes. Imagine, way 
back in the day, a ticket agency that had just one agent answering a single 
phone, selling tickets for a Frank Sinatra concert. Eventually, someone likely 
realized that this setup didn’t allow the agency to do business in the most 
efficient way and hollered, “We need a better process!” The agency rounded 
up a bunch of people to answer a lot of phones and take a heap of orders, 
and voilà — a call center was born. Call centers have been improving pro-
cesses ever since.
In Chapter 15, we discuss some process management concepts and methods.
Defining terms clearly
The best-made processes are laid to waste, however, if people don’t speak 
the same language. Therefore, you must establish definitions of terms to 
prevent frustration. Something as simple as the definition of call length — the 
total amount of time that an agent takes to complete a customer transaction 
from start to finish, including time spent talking to the customer and any 
postcall time needed to fill out information in a database — can make the dif-
ference between an employee’s meeting performance expectations and failing 
miserably.
 
To help you avoid costly miscommunication, we provide definitions and con-
cepts throughout this book. Also, for your quick reference, we’ve included a 
handy-dandy glossary as Appendix A at the back of this book. Use it to amaze 
your friends with your astonishing grasp of call center terminology, or consult 
it when you need a quick refresher.
 
Talk to your team to find out whether your definitions are clear and specific 
enough to ensure that everyone understands them.

Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Focusing on technology
Technology can be dangerous. Although it can lead to fantastic improve-
ments in efficiency and speed, without a well-thought-out plan, technology 
can spell disaster. Even if you have good people, when you take a bad pro-
cess and automate it, you just end up where you don’t want to be faster.
In the simplest of terms, technology refers to the machines that help make 
call center processes work quickly and provide the people who are doing the 
work the resources they need to get the work done. Automation (computers, 
software, and networks) can supercharge or enable certain processes and 
increase productivity.
To continue the earlier example about Madonna concert tickets, imagine that 
when people call to order tickets, all the agents taking all those calls record 
the pertinent customer information by using only pencil and paper. Those 
callers probably don’t have a very good chance of ever seeing the concert. 
This setup could work, but the call center would need a lot of paper and a lot 
more people to process that paper.
You could automate this process, but if you have a poor process, automating 
it simply adds cost — in some cases, a great deal of cost — without driving 
performance toward your business goals. Worse, poorly defined and poorly 
applied technology can take you off track, and if you spend a lot of money on 
a piece of technology, you have a hard time justifying not using it and may 
end up entrenching a flawed process.
What does “call time” really mean?
One of Réal’s team leaders approached him 
with a challenge that involved coaching one 
of the team leader’s team members. (We dis-
cuss the various roles of the call center team 
in Chapter 3.) It seemed that no matter how 
hard the team leader tried to explain, this agent 
simply couldn’t get his average call time down 
to the campaign’s requirement, so he wouldn’t 
receive a quarterly raise.
Réal agreed to help and took a look at the agent’s 
stats. He found that the agent’s average talk 
time — the average amount of time spent on the 
phone talking directly to the customer — was 
shorter than that of many other agents working 
on the same campaign and that he took almost 
twice as long as most to complete his after-call 
work. In other words, his average after-call work 
time — the average amount of time spent doing 
any postcall wrap-up work associated with the 
just-completed call — was twice as long.
When Réal spoke to the agent, he found that 
the agent thought that call time was the same 
thing as talk time. If the team leader had simply 
picked up on the fact that the agent didn’t fully 
understand this definition, she could have pre-
vented a few months’ worth of frustration for 
both of them.

41
 Chapter 2: Business Basics: Models and Drivers and Goals, Oh My!
You can find a lot of great technology that enhances call center processes, 
however, as we discuss in Chapter 10. Just make sure that you’ll be automat-
ing sound processes, and research the technology before you invest in it.
Reporting: Providing Feedback
Call centers are data factories. Almost every tool that a call center agent uses 
collects, stores, and reports on something, and all this data has to be pulled 
together and analyzed. Used properly, all this information helps call center 
managers analyze performance, create processes that improve results, and 
discard processes that don’t support the company’s goals.
Increasingly, call centers hire analysts who have advanced degrees in statis-
tics and engineering because those analysts make valuable findings about 
improvements that the call center can make in the business model.
Reporting on performance drivers is an important part of the call center busi-
ness model. Information reports give managers the feedback that they need 
to figure out whether their business practices and performance drivers are 
aligned with the call center’s mission and business goals. In Chapter 6, we 
discuss analysis, and in Chapter 9, we outline many of the types of reports 
used in a call center.
Why you should put people and process first
One call center implemented technology to 
collect sales data and deliver statistics to each 
agent’s desktop within minutes of that agent’s 
completing a sale. The company used these 
sales statistics in a very aggressive incentive 
campaign. The idea was that agents could 
see their bank accounts grow in actual dol-
lars before their very eyes with every sale they 
made, which would drive them to make more 
sales.
This approach was a great idea. Unfortunately, 
it had a problem: The process for collecting the 
sales data was flawed, and the technology was 
double- or even triple-counting some sales. A 
greater problem, of course, was that the com-
pany implemented the technology to deliver the 
stats before it recognized the process issue. 
That company ended up with a people problem 
because it had to explain to agents that because 
of a management error, they wouldn’t actually 
receive the large payouts they expected. Ouch!

Chapter 3
Developing the Cast of Characters
In This Chapter
▶ Developing the right organizational structure
▶ Defining call center roles
▶ Filling those roles
▶ Creating a supportive culture
▶ Determining the right size for your call center
I
n this chapter, we discuss the people you need to run an effective call 
center — who they are, what roles they have, and how they’re organized. 
Even with the development of self-help technology, call centers are still very 
much about people helping other people.
Organizational design — how the organization is set up in terms of roles and 
responsibilities, and who reports to whom — is an important part of the call 
center business model. You need a coordinated effort among numerous staff 
members for a call center to achieve its business goals (which we discuss 
in Chapter 2). It doesn’t take too many people working at cross purposes to 
place a drag on results.
 
A key part of organizational design is having the right roles in your center, 
which will allow you to reach your objectives. With the right mix of people and 
roles, a call center can operate in a highly coordinated fashion. When roles 
are missing or unnecessary roles creep into the organization, a call center 
can become overstretched or bureaucratic, and either situation can slow the 
march toward achieving your goals.
Because you’re dealing with people, you need to consider the culture of 
your call center workplace. A supportive culture can make the call center 
run smoothly, even if you have a less-than-optimal organizational design. An 
unsupportive culture can sabotage even the best organization, making it dif-
ficult for the call center to improve.
If you put together a good design and a great culture, your organization can 
produce stellar results even when it faces challenges.

44
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Designing an Organizational Chart
Organizational design — one of the things that the business does to create 
alignment with the mission — is part of the business model. (See Chapter 2 
for more information on developing a mission.) Done well, the design process 
makes your organization flexible and scalable — capable of growing easily 
without the need for a new design. If you have a good organizational design, 
people can work together toward the same goals, even though many of those 
people have unique priorities.
 
If you create a poor organizational design, while the organization gets larger, it 
becomes more bureaucratic, inflexible, and bloated.
The most senior person in the call center defines the structure of the organi-
zation. This person has some responsibilities of his or her own, of course, in 
addition to developing the organization structure.
Key considerations
Here are some considerations when you decide how to design your call 
center organization:
 
✓ Keep the organizational design stable. While the call center grows, the 
number of people supporting a particular function (say, scheduling) 
might increase, but the structure shouldn’t need to change.
 
✓ Identify the broad critical tasks that need to be done to support the 
mission. If the mission statement (refer to Chapter 2) says that the 
call center should be customercentric, for example, you should have a 
department that analyzes the customer experience, makes recommenda-
tions for improvement, and sponsors the necessary changes through to 
completion.
 
✓ Group functions around similar and related processes. Accounting and 
payroll, for example, are similar and related processes that can report to 
the finance department.
 
✓ Consider how the functions will work together to meet call center goals. 
You know that certain functions have different goals, and sometimes, 
those goals are in conflict. The scheduler may want agents on the phones 
when the team leader wants agents off the phones for coaching sessions, 
for example. If you make each function understand the other functions 
and their relative importance to the organization, people in all functions 
can work together toward the common mission and business goals.

45
 Chapter 3: Developing the Cast of Characters
Key tasks
Several critical tasks must be completed for a call center to function well. 
Consider these tasks when you design the organization structure and assign 
roles and responsibilities:
 
✓ Determine the call center’s mission. As we discuss in Chapter 2, you 
need to craft the mission, communicate it to the employees, and design 
it into the department’s business model.
 
✓ Work with senior management to determine the call center’s business 
goals.
 
✓ Identify the key variables — called performance drivers (see Chapter 2) — 
that drive the call center’s economic model and that directly affect the busi-
ness goals.
 
✓ Assign the roles and responsibilities required to achieve the goals, and 
determine what roles fall into which function. In your operation, for 
example, you may have a call center with a director who is responsible 
for the managers who supervise team leaders who supervise agents. 
This director may also be responsible for some of the support groups, 
such as those that forecast calls and schedule agents. Another organi-
zational design may have two directors: one who is responsible for the 
agents and another who is responsible for the support team.
 
✓ Recruit, train, and support the management team.
 
✓ Create and maintain a business culture that supports the mission.
 
✓ Create a process for documenting policies and procedures, as well as 
a process for updating policies and procedures when the call center 
makes any changes that improve the customer experience.
 
✓ Create an audit process to determine whether employees are following 
policies and procedures.
 
✓ Develop a system of corrective action to be followed when someone 
doesn’t follow policies and procedures, or when existing policies and 
procedures don’t optimize results.
 
✓ Recruit and train agents and support staff.
 
✓ Manage and support agent performance.
 
✓ Assess and provide feedback on the quality of agent performance.
 
✓ Schedule staff and resources to meet demand.
 
✓ Analyze and report on performance and process, and identify opportuni-
ties for improvement.
 
✓ Implement and manage a telecommunications infrastructure and a com-
puter network.

46
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
 
✓ Identify, build (or purchase), and support applications that support the 
call center.
 
✓ Ensure that the call center complies with all legal requirements.
 
✓ Provide front-line support to customers.
 
✓ Provide direction and support for the management team.
This list doesn’t include everything that you may need to do. You’ll identify 
additional tasks that are important for your particular call center, such as 
payroll and budgeting or facilities management.
Introducing the Call Center Team: 
Roles and Responsibilities
The roles and responsibilities that we describe in the following sections are 
intended only to identify the core work that needs to be done in a call center. 
Figure 3-1 shows a typical functional organizational chart. Naturally, you may 
not organize your call center in exactly this fashion; the size of your opera-
tion has a significant effect on the structure of your organization.
 
The precise structure of your organization isn’t as important as ensuring that 
you assign all the major responsibilities and clearly define the accountabilities.
If you have a relatively small operation, one person may handle more than 
one of the roles and/or responsibilities that we describe. Your team leader 
might also do recruiting, or the analyst might also do some scheduling. On 
the other hand, in a large operation, whole departments might handle one 
role, such as scheduling or reporting functions. Similarly, the team-leader 
role might be broken into finer areas of responsibility, with one group of 
team leaders handling coaching and feedback while other groups work on 
delegated projects that will improve processes.
Senior management
In a corporate call center, you find two groups of customers:
 
✓ External: External customers are the people on the phone who are calling 
for various reasons, perhaps to buy something or (in the case of a TV 
network) to ask why Lassie was taken off the air.
 
✓ Internal: Internal customers are members of senior management — the 
executives who don’t work in the call center but tell you what you have 
to do (such as generate more revenue, cut costs, do both, or make 

47
 Chapter 3: Developing the Cast of Characters
customers happier). If you run an outsourcing call center (see Chapter 5), 
the internal customer is the client company.
 
 Either way, the internal customer gives you your marching orders, and 
in your organizational structure, he, she, or it is at the top.

Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Senior management has certain responsibilities to the call center, including 
assigning a general mission (such as “We are here to serve the customer in 
support of the product. Customers will never leave us for lack of support!”). 
We talk more about mission in Chapter 2.
Senior management also needs to tell you exactly what your annual business 
objectives are. A typical objective might look like this: “The company needs 
the call center to acquire 1 million new customers next year, with average 
revenue per customer of $100 and a cost per customer of $5. Oh, and custom-
ers must rate their satisfaction with the call center experience as excellent 
95 percent of the time, with no more than 1 complaint per 1,000 customers.” 
Ideally, some input from the call center went into creating the objectives so 
that they’re based on what’s realistically achievable.
Call center manager
Senior management works with the person who has overall responsibility for 
the call center’s goals, processes, and results. If all goes well, it has a give-
and-take relationship with this person that results in realistic goals that sup-
port the organization.
And who is this wonderful person who has overall responsibility for the call 
center, this supporter of call center rights and freedoms, this champion of 
the little agent? It’s none other than the wondrous, the celebrated, the awe-
inspiring call center manager!
Okay, you may not call this person a call center manager. She might be a 
director, vice president, assistant vice president, senior vice president, 
super-duper vice president, or “Janet over in the call center.” It really doesn’t 
matter what name any organization gives the job. When we say call center 
manager, we’re talking about the person who has overall responsibility for 
the call center’s results.
The call center manager takes direction and goals from senior management, 
communicates them to the call center agents in the form of overall goals and 
the department mission, and then translates them into internal call center 
goals and measures. He goes through this process by identifying the perfor-
mance drivers that affect business and department goals. Cost per customer, 
for example, may be driven by call length, first-call resolution, cost per hour 
of agent time on the phones, and agent occupancy. (See Chapter 6 for more 
information on these measures.)

49
 Chapter 3: Developing the Cast of Characters
The call center manager spends much of his time ensuring that performance 
and all roles, accountabilities, and processes in the department are on track. 
He has oversight of the following tasks:
 
✓ Working with senior management to develop realistic annual business 
goals
 
✓ Designing the organization structure of the call center, and identifying 
roles and responsibilities
 
✓ Reviewing and approving all policies and procedures to ensure that they 
support the department’s mission and business goals
 
✓ Recruiting, training, supporting, and developing the remaining members 
of the management team, including people who handle support functions
Agent performance team
Recruiter, trainer, and team leader comprise the agent performance team. 
Together, they perform the core responsibilities that we summarize as the 
quick method of getting the right agents to be excellent at their job:
 
1. Hire the right people to do the job.
 
2. Tell them what to do and why they need to do it.
 
3. Show them how to do it.
 
4. Give them feedback on performance.
 
5. Make supporting them — by ensuring that they have the knowledge, 
skills, and tools to do their job — your number-one mission.
Recruiter
Here’s the ancient secret of call centers: You need people who have the skills 
(or the potential to develop the skills) to properly support your products and 
your customers. The recruiter’s job is to seek out people who have the moti-
vation and the experience to do the job.
 
In many small call centers, the job of recruiting is absorbed into the team 
leader’s role. You may not want to create that job combo, however, if your 
call center does a lot of ongoing recruiting, because your team leader will 
spend all of her time recruiting, and your existing staff will lack the attention 
they need. Also, a dedicated professional recruiter can improve the quality 
of recruits, maximizing the success of your recruits and operations. If you’re 
hiring a lot of people who just end up quitting in six months, you’re wast-
ing time. If your call center does more or less ongoing recruitment, look into 
hiring a professional recruiter.

Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Being a good recruiter is tough. A good recruiter plays several roles:
 
✓ Fortune-teller: The recruiter works with the scheduling department to 
predict when the call center will need new staff.
 
✓ Advertising and marketing specialist: In the process of finding people 
who are interested in working for the company, the recruiter becomes 
an advertising and marketing specialist, communicating to potential 
employees the availability and desirability of jobs in the call center.
 
✓ Analyst: After bringing in a sufficient pool of candidates, the recruiter 
starts the process of comparing the candidates with his own criteria for 
success.
 
✓ Researcher/psychologist/tea-leaf reader: Using the company’s selection 
criteria, as well as interviews, reference checks, and employment tests, 
the recruiter determines which candidates are most likely to be success-
ful in the job and within the company. This determination, which can be 
tough, includes two areas of investigation:
 
• Does the candidate have the skills or aptitude to do the job well?
 
• Will the candidate value the job long enough to be motivated to 
improve his or her performance?
 
✓ Lawyer: When the recruiter finds people who can be successful in the 
job, he makes offers to those candidates. At this point, the recruiter 
becomes part lawyer, making sure that the offer of employment is legal 
and promises only the right things. The recruiter has to make the offer 
clear. After candidates accept, sign the offer letter, and schedule train-
ing time, the recruiter can become a couch potato — for a few hours.
 
✓ Sleuth: A very good recruiter is also part sleuth. He reviews the success 
of employees and looks for patterns that can help with future recruit-
ment. The recruiter interviews employees who quit the company to 
find out why they’re leaving and how he might have predicted their 
departure during recruitment. (Don’t be mistaken here: Some turnover 
will happen in your call center, as in any business, but you still want to 
understand why.)
Trainer
You can realize improvements in your call center quickly and easily by estab-
lishing good training in sales, call control, anger diffusion, customer service, 
and similar topics. That training, however, starts with a trainer.
In a call center, trainers offer initial training for new agents; ongoing skill-
enhancement training for existing agents; and management and leadership 
training for team leaders, managers, and other off-phone staff.

51
 Chapter 3: Developing the Cast of Characters
In addition to facilitating training sessions, many trainers develop course 
materials for training. Good trainers are skilled in adult education, manage-
ment, and motivation. They use a variety of techniques to develop the skills 
of those they train.
Being a call center trainer is a wonderful job, because things rarely go wrong 
in training. Unfortunately, things do sometimes go wrong in a day in the life 
of a call center agent, so the trainer should establish a when-things-go-wrong 
process and role-play to prepare agents for such events.
Good training and a great trainer have magnified benefits in the call center 
environment, because call centers are about people — a lot of people work-
ing the phones. Call centers are also about numbers. One small positive 
change can have a big effect on the customer experience or on the improve-
ment of the business, because this change for the better is repeated multiple 
times across a large number of people.
 
A call center that has 1 million customers and reduces its contact rate by 
1 percent because of effective training reduces call volume by 10,000 calls. 
Alternatively, imagine taking 10 seconds off call length through call-control 
training. That translates into about 4,000 hours in reduced staffing.
Often, when an agent comes out of training with a lack of knowledge or 
understanding about how to apply that knowledge, the team leader points 
his finger at the trainer, and the trainer points her finger at the team leader. 
Who has the accountability? Training gives agents knowledge and instruction 
on how to apply this knowledge. When the trainer hands off a newly trained 
agent to the team leader, the trainer and team leader need to have a clear 
discussion about the agent’s strengths and areas of development. The team 
leader must further develop his agent to full proficiency.
Team leader
Probably the most important management job in the call center, in terms 
of driving operational performance, is the team leader. A good team leader 
drives agents and a call center to great improvements, but a bad team leader 
quickly creates poor morale, which leads to agents leaving or not giving their 
best.
 
In fairness, bad supervision frequently isn’t the team leader’s fault. Bad super-
vision can come from poorly designed team-leader roles. Perhaps the team 
leader is conflicted about priorities, and as a result, she doesn’t focus on the 
things that motivate employees and drive results. Bad supervision also can 
result from poor team-leader training (or no training at all). Many team leaders 
face the “You’re a great agent — now get out there and supervise!” dilemma.

52
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Team leaders have several key responsibilities:
 
✓ Setting expectations: It’s been said that the number-one reason why 
employees fail is that the employees don’t know what’s expected of 
them. Amen to that! We’d go further and suggest that expectations must 
be very simple, clear, and easy to remember. The team leader needs to 
communicate expectations clearly and make sure that employees always 
know where they stand with regard to those expectations.
 
✓ Coaching: Coaching includes providing feedback on performance, drill-
ing down to the specific kernel of performance that can result in the 
biggest improvement for the agent. It also includes providing the agent 
ad hoc training and guidance on how to make changes for improvement. 
(For more information on coaching and feedback, turn to Chapter 13.)
 
✓ Providing support: The team leader also needs to offer support to the 
call center agents. Whether he’s providing job support or career sup-
port, he needs to be there for agents when they need help, clearing away 
roadblocks and helping them build the skills they need to better their 
performance. This part of the job is very important, because when road-
blocks hamper agent performance, frustration sets in — and if the team 
leader doesn’t remove the roadblocks, the agents will begin to direct 
their frustration toward him.
Scheduler
Here’s a tough job. The scheduler (or, in large call centers, the scheduling 
group) is responsible for forecasting call-volume demand and planning for 
sufficient staff, desks, and equipment to meet that demand within call center 
goals (service level and so on; see Chapter 2).
The job includes multiple phases of forecasting and scheduling, including 
long-term (“Hey, recruiter, we’re gonna need 20 more people next January”), 
medium-term (“You know, we’re going to have to add some people to the 
evening schedule next month”), short-term (“We’re going to be overstaffed 
Friday afternoon, so we should schedule some training sessions”), and the 
present (“We’re trending over forecast today. Noon to 2 p.m. will be busy; we 
should reschedule the team meetings for tomorrow”). If you want to know 
what’s going on in the call center, ask the scheduler. We discuss this function 
in depth in Chapter 8.
 
A good scheduler can reduce expenses in a call center by 5 percent or more 
without making any service reductions. In many call centers, 5 percent is 
worth a lot of bananas.

53
 Chapter 3: Developing the Cast of Characters
Analysts
Several analyst roles are critical to the operation of a call center. Each role 
calls for a person (or people) with specific technical expertise and a high 
level of skill. The following sections describe the various analysts you’d find 
in a typical call center.
Telecommunications analyst
A call center isn’t a call center without people, but it really isn’t a call center 
without calls. Most phone systems are so reliable that people take them for 
granted. Still, the giant systems at work in today’s call centers aren’t phone 
systems as much as they are sophisticated telecommunications servers. 
Relax — they’re still reliable, but they take some TLC to keep them that way. 
Also, the call center management team always seems to be asking for more 
sophisticated routing and data from the system.
The telecommunications analyst maintains the phone system and network 
connection to the outside world’s phone network. She changes configura-
tions and assists with sophisticated applications that integrate with the 
phone system and network. Forecasting capacity within the phone network 
and phone system frequently falls to the analyst; she works with the help of 
the department scheduler, who tells the telecommunications analyst how 
much demand to expect.
Computer and network analyst
The computer and network analyst is responsible for making sure that the 
call center workstations function optimally as frequently as possible.
Most call centers today rely totally on an agent’s workstation to provide that 
agent the necessary tools and information. When the tools are unavailable, the 
call center quickly grinds to a halt. Imagine a call center that has 500 agents 
taking 4,000 customer calls per hour, and the network fails. Aside from the cost 
of having 500 idle agents, it doesn’t take long to frustrate thousands of custom-
ers. You can bet that this kind of call center takes downtime seriously.
Another concern for the computer and network analyst is that when worksta-
tion response time slows call length, it creates an immediate bottleneck in 
the call center’s work process. This bottleneck results in an increase in call 
length, which can create long holding times for customers and increase call 
center costs. A 1-second increase in call length in a call center that answers 
1 million calls per year can add more than $10,000 in annual costs — and 
that’s from a 1-second increase. When computers get slow, they can create 
much longer delays than that.

54
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
As one of these analysts once said, “It’s one of those jobs where you know 
you’re doing a good job when you don’t hear from anyone, but when you 
do . . .” Like Mr. Scott on the U.S.S. Enterprise, a computer and network ana-
lyst can perform miracles, keeping things working and fixing them at warp 
speed when they don’t.
Applications developer
The brother (or sister) of the computer and network analyst is the applica-
tions developer. You need this person. A good developer pays for himself 
many times over in a year . . . but he can be a little scary. How can anyone 
stare at a computer screen for precisely 1.9 hours, get up, drink a diet cola 
for 14.5 minutes, and be back in his seat staring at a computer screen for 
another 1.9 hours? It’s not natural.
Still, the application developer creates the tools that make the whole call 
center world work — and did we mention that you need him? He develops 
databases, troubleshooting guides, call-management applications, and script-
ing tools, and also links these tools so that they work together seamlessly. 
(For details on the use of technology in call centers, see Part III of this book.)
An application developer has superb development, analytical, and problem-
solving skills; can work unsupervised for months at a time; and may drink 
amounts of cola that would make lab rats stand up and sing “Jailhouse Rock.”
Reporting analyst
Historically, the person who produced department reports filled the role 
of reporting analyst. The position of reporting analyst has evolved a great 
deal. Reporting is still part of her job responsibilities, but now it’s a fraction 
of what she does. Today’s analyst isn’t just the kid who’s really good with 
spreadsheets. Increasingly, she’s someone who has advanced skills in statis-
tics and analysis.
Certainly, this analyst produces reports on how well the call center is meet-
ing its performance metrics — business goals and performance drivers (refer 
to Chapter 2). She produces reports in almost any frequency that manage-
ment wants — hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly — by using an automated 
process. The analyst also makes sure that agent performance data is avail-
able so that team leaders can provide feedback to their staff. In short, she’s 
sort of the scorekeeper for the call center.
In addition, the reporting analyst can identify numerous opportunities by 
analyzing the performance of your calls, agents, teams, and the overall 
department. By studying and researching metrics, she can identify and rec-
ommend improvements in processes and tools that can lead to better perfor-
mance for the call center.

55
 Chapter 3: Developing the Cast of Characters
Quality analyst
The quality analyst has to assess agents’ work objectively against specific 
quality standards for information and data-entry accuracy, complete-
ness, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Past industry practice 
involved a quality analyst assessing customer interaction against a set of 
quality standards, which included subjective components such as courtesy, 
tone, and other soft skills. This practice led to a lot of time being spent on 
internal disagreements about the correctness of the assessment instead of 
the quality of the customer experience.
Nowadays, in good organizations, the customer assesses the subjective com-
ponent through postcontact surveys, thus eliminating this subjective compo-
nent of the quality analyst’s job. Combining the analysis with the voice of the 
customer gives the team leader a full picture of the customer experience.
 
In many call centers, the team leader often performs this role. If you can, 
however, separate the responsibilities so that the team leader doesn’t have to 
spend all his time collecting information.
Compliance and procedures officer
This relatively new role for call centers plays an important part in monitoring 
and documenting your operational process — what you do and how you do 
it. Call centers are subject to an increasing number of laws that govern their 
behavior. The compliance and procedures officer is responsible for making 
sure that the call center knows its legal requirements and that the work pro-
cesses are adapted to meet those requirements.
Also, as we discuss in Chapter 15, managing call center processes is a pow-
erful and important tool because it allows you to continually improve your 
operation. This officer is responsible for identifying existing processes, docu-
menting them, and updating the processes when certain parts don’t make 
sense to you or your customer (or the process is too complicated or takes 
too long). She is responsible for making recommendations for improvements, 
and she creates an audit process to make sure that employees are following 
the approved guidelines.
Call center agent
An agent is the person who’s on the phone talking to your customers. He’s 
responsible for handling customer contacts in a manner that supports both 
the call center’s goals and his own personal performance goals, which his 
team leader should outline for him.

56
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
The agent is the most vital role in the call center. A call center doesn’t work 
without agents, as they can make or break customers’ experience of dealing 
with your company.
 
Many call centers have other titles for their agents, including teleservice rep-
resentative, customer service representative, customer service person, and 
customer account executive.
Finding the Best People for Your Jobs
If you look at the companies that are most successful, the recipe for success 
looks pretty much the same at each company. The first ingredient is always 
having the right talent for the right role. In this section, we give you some 
tips on finding the best people for the jobs in your center.
Locating a call center manager
A call center manager is a solid business generalist. She needs a well-rounded 
set of communication, interpersonal, leadership, and analytical skills. 
Business training, including accounting and organizational behavior, will help 
her manage people and the costs. Also, understanding call center technol-
ogy can help her understand how to drive efficiency and make the customer 
experience better.
You can check many sources for a manager. You might find the manager in 
your call center working as a team leader, as a trainer, or in another position. 
You might find the manager somewhere else in the organization, running 
another business process, or you might even recruit externally.
 
Don’t think that you must hire a manager who has call center experience. 
Most people can figure out call center skills, tools, and terms fairly easily. 
Instead, look for a combination of leadership and core business skills, such as 
statistics, finance, accounting, organizational behavior, and budgeting.
Picking an agent performance team: 
Recruiter, trainer, and team leader
The recruiter, trainer, and team leader play different roles in the process of 
bringing and retaining the best agent talent possible. The process starts with 
the recruiter, who hands off to the trainer, who hands off to the team leader, 

57
 Chapter 3: Developing the Cast of Characters
who is ultimately responsible for the ongoing development of the agent. Here 
are some tips on hiring your agent performance team:
 
✓ Finding a recruiter: It’s beneficial to have agents recruit other agents 
for the call center; likewise, it’s beneficial to find a recruiter among 
your agents. Agents have an intimate knowledge of the job, which they 
can pass on to candidates, and because they’ve done the job them-
selves, they know the type of personality that is best suited for the job. 
Wherever you find a recruiter, however, you need to train him in human-
resources practices and laws as they relate to recruiting.
 
✓ Finding a trainer: You can certainly develop a good trainer in your man-
agement team or even your agent group. A person with a background in 
education (child or adult) and human resources can bring training dis-
cipline and expertise to the classroom. Even without this background, a 
bright employee who’s an excellent communicator and great problem-
solver will do nicely — but make sure that you spend the time to train 
her in adult education techniques.
 
✓ Finding a team leader: The team-leader job is a great advancement 
opportunity for call center agents, but not everyone can be a great team 
leader. The ideal candidate has communication, interpersonal, and ana-
lytical skills. A background in leadership and possibly some business 
education can help the team leader understand human behavior and 
both motivate and lead agents. At a minimum, a new team leader needs 
training in leadership, coaching, and human-resources practices.
Hiring a scheduler
A scheduler needs to be analytical and should have a solid mathematical and 
problem-solving background. Without computer skills, too, a scheduler might 
have a hard time.
You might find a good scheduler in the accounting or finance department, 
on the reporting team, or maybe even in the agent group — especially if he 
has an educational background in accounting, business, or engineering. An 
external candidate might also work, especially if he has the necessary skills 
(which we talk about in the section “Scheduler,” earlier in this chapter). 
Having worked in a call center in the past can really be an asset, particularly 
if that experience comes with good references.
 
Expect to pay well for someone who’s been a success in the scheduling role at 
another call center.

Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Acquiring analysts
Not all analysts are created equal! Each one of the following roles requires 
very specific technical expertise and skills that are unique to that role. You 
may have to look in different places to find the analysts you want. A telecom-
munications analyst may be sourced externally from a technology vendor, 
for example, whereas you may find a quality analyst internally in your pool of 
call center agents.
Here are some tips on finding good analysts:
 
✓ Finding a telecommunications analyst: Telecommunications analysts are 
special. Certainly, you can find a person who has a lot of analytical skills 
and some computer background, and then train her. You can also find a 
good candidate externally or working in other areas of the company.
 
✓ Finding a computer and network analyst: You can find a computer 
and network analyst inside your call center. Look for young people who 
have strong computer and network backgrounds and who are eager 
for an opportunity to use their skills. Those people may work in other 
departments, and you can even find them outside the company. A good 
computer and network analyst has the required computer skills, is ana-
lytical, and is great at solving problems.
 
✓ Finding an application developer: This position is another one that you 
may be able to fill from inside your call center.
 
 Frequently, you may be able to hire an application developer right out of 
school. The smarter a candidate is, the better.
 
✓ Finding a reporting analyst: Consider people who have advanced 
degrees in engineering, business, math, or statistics because of the com-
plexity of the data analysis that is required. A candidate who has experi-
ence in root-cause analysis, a discipline such as Six Sigma (see Chapter 17), 
research, or another analytical discipline would be the best fit.
 
✓ Finding a quality analyst: The role of quality analyst is a good training 
ground for agents who want to move up in the call center world as train-
ers and team leaders. You can probably find a lot of potential quality 
analysts among your call center agents.
Rounding up a compliance 
and procedures officer
The compliance and procedures officer role requires someone who’s well 
organized, detail-oriented, and a good communicator. If this person has 
experience with documenting quality standards, such as ISO 9001/2000 (see 
Chapter 17), he will be better equipped to get the job done.

59
 Chapter 3: Developing the Cast of Characters
Recruiting agents
Agents come from a variety of backgrounds. When selecting agents, develop 
a profile of ideal candidates. We discuss agent recruiting in Chapter 12.
Creating and Managing 
Call Center Culture
A lot of people recognize that a company’s culture — how people in the 
company think, act, and view the world around them — is important and fun-
damental to operating any business. You may hear a lot of talk about under-
standing culture, but not a lot of people understand how to create culture.
Leadership is a topic that would require a whole different book, so we can’t 
go into it in too much detail, but we can show you how to have a positive 
influence on the culture of your call center. Here are some approaches that 
can change your workplace culture for the better:
 
✓ Make creating culture a team exercise. Designing a culture is a great 
team exercise. Even if you can’t involve everyone associated with the 
call center in the exercise, everyone needs to be involved in the commu-
nication and training that come out of it.
 
✓ Review the mission and vision. In Chapter 2, we talk about creating a 
mission, which is a quick, concise description of your department’s pur-
pose that tells the world what you do and why you do it. The vision is 
a very specific statement about what you want the organization to look 
like in the future. The mission and the vision are assignments that the 
people in your call center have to complete as a team.
 
✓ Define what a culture is. We define culture as being the behavior that 
results from a team’s shared beliefs and values. The behavior, values, 
and beliefs should support your mission and vision; they certainly can’t 
contradict the mission or vision. If you want to define certain codes of 
behavior, you have to define some values and beliefs that you want to 
incorporate into your team members’ work lives. Following are our defi-
nitions of values and beliefs:
 
• Values: Values are the organization’s stated rules of engagement. 
Values describe how the people who are involved with your call 
center — management, staff, customers, clients, vendors, and so 
on — should treat one another and expect to be treated. Examples of 
values include honesty, dignity, and respect.
 
• Beliefs: Beliefs are definitive, bold statements of how a company 
or department will achieve its mission by using the power of its 
values. If your call center’s mission is to be a world-class provider 

60
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
of customer service, for example, a belief would be “Together, we 
will achieve our goals through teamwork and integrity” or “We will 
work with our customers as partners to achieve their goals.”
 
✓ Decide what you need to do to turn the values and beliefs into a cul-
ture. Ask yourself how you’re going to incorporate values and beliefs 
into your management practices, policies, and rules of conduct. The 
company reinforces beliefs through actions, decisions, and initiatives 
such as competitive learning (say, promoting teamwork), continuing 
education, and research. If you tie enough threads between values and 
beliefs and the operation of your business, and the members of your 
management team demonstrate these values in their daily interactions, 
the fabric of the culture that you want will emerge in time.
Sizing the Organization
The basic design of a call center organization shouldn’t change depending on 
its size, because the roles that you need in a 20-seat call center are the same 
ones that you need in a 500-seat center. The key difference is that in small 
organizations, you might group tasks so that fewer people can handle them.
In a large call center, you might subdivide tasks because you need several 
people to complete a task. In a small call center, the team leader might handle 
recruiting, training, and feedback, whereas in a large center, an entire depart-
ment may do recruiting, another department may do training, and so on.
 
You can determine the number of people required to complete any task based 
on the complexity of the task and the volume of work to be done. In Chapters 7 
and 8, we discuss how to determine the number of agents that you need. In 
most call centers, agents make up the bulk of your workforce.
Your ratio of team leaders to agents (see the following section) determines 
how many team leaders you need. If your call center has another layer of 
reporting — team leaders who report to managers, for example — you need 
to determine the optimal ratio of managers to team leaders so that you can 
calculate the size of the management team.
Other groups that should be sized in relation to the call center are the vari-
ous roles that support the agents and the center, such as trainers, schedul-
ers, and quality analysts. The ratio of these roles varies with the type of 
work that is required. Scheduling one center of 100 agents requires only one 
scheduler, for example, and if you grow your center by another 100 agents, 
you still require only one scheduler. For those same 100 agents, however, 
you may have 2 trainers who impart specific sales and service skills as well 
as technical knowledge, and if you grow your center by another 100 agents, 
you might need to add 2 more trainers.

61
 Chapter 3: Developing the Cast of Characters
Ensuring the best management span
Call center managers spend much time discussing management span — how 
many agents any one team leader can supervise, or how many team leaders 
any one manager can manage. Make management span for your organization 
directly proportional to the amount of support your agents require. The span 
of control really depends on the complexity of the work done in the center, 
the experience and capability of the staff, and the amount of job support that 
agents can get through technology and tools.
Some call centers prefer a relatively low span of management control 
because it provides more time for the team leader to spend with each call 
center agent, improving the quality of call handling, reducing the employee 
learning curve, and improving employee morale. The obvious downside is 
that it costs the company more money, because when you have fewer agents 
on each team, you need more team leaders.
A span of 15 to 1 seems to be the de facto standard, but spans vary with 
the type of work that is being completed by agents. Often, call centers that 
require lower skill on the phones, such as taking orders for pizza, can work 
with a 30-to-1 span. Other types of call centers, such as those that handle 
insurance underwriting, may work with ratios as low as 5 to 1; in these orga-
nizations, the team leader is responsible not only for coaching, but also for 
approving the work completed by agents.
 
Most call centers fall in the area of 10 or 20 to 1, with an average of about 15 
to 1. We encourage you to use some of the criteria in the following sections to 
determine the right span of management for your organization.
Increasing span
These factors can allow you to increase the span of management control:
 
✓ Technology that supports call center agents, such as performance feed-
back that goes directly to their computers or knowledge bases that con-
tain answers to even very difficult questions
 
✓ E-learning, which allows agents to take training right on their computers
 
✓ E-mail, which allows team leaders to communicate more effectively with 
staff members
 
✓ Automated call recording, which increases team-leader productivity, 
making it possible for team leaders to provide feedback to more staff in 
the same amount of time
 
✓ The creation of a dedicated call-evaluation team that listens to agent 
calls and assesses them for the team leader, essentially offloading some 
of the team leader’s tasks
 
✓ A strong team of agents who know the job well and can work on their own

Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Employing support tools
Imagine that one of your team leaders comes into the office to do her job of 
supporting and coaching her staff. To start her day, she prints a variety of 
reports from various systems that tell her about the team’s performance. She 
summarizes these reports in a spreadsheet so that she can better understand 
each agent’s strengths and weaknesses. Next, she spends a few hours listen-
ing to agents’ calls. (This process takes a while, because not many customers 
are calling today.) After she hears some complete calls by a few agents, she 
reviews and evaluates those calls. Now, with reports and work samples pre-
pared, she’s ready to provide coaching. Unfortunately, the day’s almost over, 
and she needs to wrap some things up before heading home. Oh, well, coach-
ing can wait until tomorrow.
Now imagine the same team leader with better support tools, such as elec-
tronic reports. When she comes into the office, she starts her computer, and 
waiting there for her is a statistical performance analysis for each agent. The 
analyses are very detailed, containing more history than she could ever col-
lect on her own, and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each agent. 
Also, her agents have already seen these reports, which include a list of 
coaching points for improvement.
Also available to the team leader is a large sample of calls for all agents. 
The calls have been scored, and the scores have been sent to the respec-
tive agents. With all this work done, your team leader can start her day by 
approaching agents and offering help in working on their already-defined 
coaching areas.
You can use these tools in your own call center; we discuss them in greater 
detail in Chapter 10. By using these tools, team leaders can spend more of 
their time supporting their agents through coaching and feedback, which 
allows for a higher span of management control.
Recognizing overly high span
Having too low a span of management is rarely a problem. Concerns about 
cost control, growth in the call center, and movement of management to new 
assignments place constant upward pressure on management span. You 
need to be able to recognize the signs of a span of management control that’s 
too high:
 
✓ Call center agents complain that they don’t get enough time with their 
team leaders.
 
✓ Quality of call handling decreases or needs improvement.
 
✓ Team leaders can’t do everything that they need to do.
If your call center’s span of management is too high, you either need to 
change the way that team leaders’ work gets done (through the addition of 
new tools or processes) or increase the number of team leaders.

 Chapter 3: Developing the Cast of Characters
Planning for growth
While your call center grows in size and complexity, you may find that some 
processes and tools don’t work the way they used to. In fact, you may find that 
some tasks fail altogether. In some small call centers, one person who uses 
some fairly basic tools — perhaps homegrown spreadsheets — can do the cen-
ter’s scheduling. When the call center grows in size and complexity, however, 
that person may find that he can no longer get his job done in a day.
You can handle the increased workload that results from a growing organiza-
tion by adding more people or changing the work process. In many cases, 
while a company grows, its old work processes no longer meet the needs of 
the business, so that company needs to change a process or get some new 
technology — not necessarily more manpower. In the case of the scheduler, 
a new, fully automated scheduling package might change the work process 
enough so that he could again do the entire job of scheduling for the call 
center.
 
It’s best to add more people after you’ve looked at your processes and found 
opportunities to create efficiency.

Building a Call Center of Your Own
In This Chapter
▶ Asking questions to find out what you need
▶ Deciding where to locate
▶ Determining the type and size of your center
▶ Creating a building plan
▶ Preparing for emergencies
T
he implementation of a call center starts with a need — sometimes, an 
urgent need. Okay, frequently an urgent need! An organization finds itself 
receiving a lot of calls from customers — perhaps because business is boom-
ing — but the organization doesn’t have anywhere for the calls to go. So 
someone declares, “We need a call center!” Often, and particularly in urgent 
cases, the organization builds the call center quickly to expand the compa-
ny’s existing customer contact capability.
Other organizations plan their call centers well in advance. If your company 
is rolling out a new product or business, for example, and you expect to have 
a lot of calls coming in, you can plan to meet the need for more call handling.
In this chapter, we provide some of the questions and answers on the why, 
what, where, when, and how of building a call center.
First Things First: Asking Questions
You need answers to some basic questions to determine your call center’s 
logistics:
 
✓ What are the call center’s business goals?
 
✓ What functions will the call center perform?
 
✓ What support services will the call center require?
 
✓ What skills do you need on your planning team?

66
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
 
✓ How big will the call center be?
 
✓ Will the call center stand alone, or do you plan to network it?
Answering these questions helps planners create the list of requirements that 
ultimately becomes a project plan for building the call center. We discuss all 
these questions in the following sections.
 
You also need to consider what sort of technology the call center requires and 
whether to outsource the call center’s work. These topics are so large that we 
cover them in separate chapters — outsourcing in Chapter 5 and technology 
in Chapter 9.
What are the call center’s business goals?
As we discuss in Chapters 2 and 3, senior management in the corporation 
sets the call center’s strategic direction by defining its mission. Getting an 
early understanding of what’s expected from the call center can help you 
begin to define future capabilities and requirements.
In Chapter 2, we provide more information about service level and other call 
center goals, along with a model that can help you ensure that you’re meet-
ing those goals.
What functions will the 
call center perform?
The types of services provided by your call center dictate the skills that 
you need, and those services may also influence the call center’s location. 
If you’re taking highly technical calls, for example, you may want to locate 
in an area that has a technical school. If a lot of your callers speak Spanish, 
you need agents who do too, so you may want to locate in an area that has a 
highly concentrated Spanish-speaking population.
Here are some typical tasks that agents might perform in your call center:
 
✓ Inbound customer service: Providing general product information, ser-
vice help, or advice to customers
 
✓ Inbound technical support: Helping customers use their product or ser-
vice, and offering troubleshooting advice for technical problems
 
✓ Inbound sales: Helping customers make purchase decisions

67
 Chapter 4: Building a Call Center of Your Own
 
✓ Inbound billing: Helping customers understand their invoices and pro-
viding them general account information
 
✓ Outbound telemarketing: Selling new offerings to customers
 
✓ Outbound service: Following up with existing customers on inquiries 
and problems, as well as providing information about relevant product 
offerings, gathering opinions, or conducting surveys
 
✓ Outbound collections: Attempting to pry payment from people whom 
you may no longer choose to call customers
 
✓ Inbound collections: Receiving payment from people whom you prob-
ably do still call customers
 
✓ Back office: Processing customer requests and orders for new products 
or services
What support services will 
the call center require?
Call center planners need to ask what services, other than call handling, the 
call center will perform. (In addition to providing call handling, a customer 
support center may want to provide e-mail support for customers who 
prefer to use that method of communication, for example.) Some of these 
services may be obvious, such as management support functions, which are 
performed by team leaders, schedulers, trainers, and the other roles that we 
discuss in Chapter 3. Other services may not be so obvious, and you must 
identify them before you start the call center design.
Consider the product and service support functions that your call center may 
require, such as the following:
 
✓ Communicating with customers via fax, e-mail, or online chat
 
✓ Processing mail
 
✓ Entering customer orders into company systems
 
✓ Ensuring that customers receive products and/or services within the 
promised time
 
✓ Reviewing and approving (or denying) customer requests for claims, 
credit, and so on
 
✓ Distributing the product
 
✓ Processing warranty claims

68
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
What skills do you need 
on your planning team?
Because a call center’s requirements cross several disciplines, you want 
people on the planning team who have a variety of skills. People with neces-
sary expertise include specialists in project management; human resources; 
and facilities, technology, and staff planning. You also need someone who 
has experience running the type of call center that you’re building — perhaps 
the future call center manager.
 
A project team made up of people who have these skills is less likely to miss 
important requirements.
How big will the call center be?
The size of your call center depends primarily on the number of agents that 
you need to manage all your customer contacts, so you must predict the 
workload that the new call center will handle. Conduct a long-range fore-
cast — say, five years out — so that you can plan some room for growth. In 
Chapters 7 and 8, we discuss forecasting and staffing, and explain how to 
determine how big a call center you need.
 
Determining your future call center’s size tells you a lot, including the type of 
community in which you need to locate it (one with a sufficient labor pool that 
has the skills you need) and the type of building you need (one that has suf-
ficient space, utilities, telecommunications infrastructure, convenient access, 
and parking).
Will the call center stand alone, 
or do you plan to network it?
As part of your sizing discussion, you want to know whether you’re making 
the call center a separate entity — a stand-alone facility that does all the 
work itself — or part of a network of call centers that perform similar func-
tions. A new operation requires more planning and research because a blue-
print on which you can base decisions may not exist. Many companies start 
with one call center. To ensure that they can continue operations during a 
disaster (see “Planning for Problems,” later in this chapter), companies often 
launch another site or hire an outsourcer, or they implement a home agent 
program. We cover outsourced centers in Chapter 5 and home agents in 
Chapter 11.

69
 Chapter 4: Building a Call Center of Your Own
You may want to create a network of centers if your customers feel that a 
regional presence is important or you can get attractive financial benefits 
(government subsidies or lower agent turnover, for example). You may find 
adding to a network of call centers to be fairly easy because the new opera-
tion can rely on the model developed by the existing operation.
X Marks the Spot: Situating 
Your Call Center
The major factors that influence your call center’s location are
 
✓ Access to a readily available pool of talent, such as that provided by uni-
versities or military bases
 
✓ Level of competition for the agent skills you need
 
✓ Labor and regulatory laws that affect your ability to operate
 
✓ Access to public transportation
 
✓ Reliability of local providers of telecommunications and utilities, such as 
power and water
 
✓ Local government interest in your success (including incentives such as 
business tax breaks and subsidies)
 
✓ Cost of real estate or rental facilities
 
✓ Cost of operating the call center
Some companies also want to locate their call centers close to other corpo-
rate locations or to their customers. Simply add whatever criteria are impor-
tant to your company to the core location factors in the preceding list to give 
yourself a great basis for comparing operations.
Consider each criterion when you decide on the best location for your new 
center. You have a lot of options. With the worldwide availability of the 
Internet and telecommunications services, new labor markets all over the 
world have opened to call center operators. Every market has its benefits, 
and everything else being equal, you can locate a call center anywhere in the 
world and still achieve the operation’s mission and business goals.
 
You don’t even have to limit your call center to a physical location: You can 
create virtual call centers that have agents working in different locations 
around the world while serving the same group of customers. See Chapter 11 
to find out more about setting up a virtual call center.

70
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Considering infrastructure
Naturally, the area that you select must be equipped with the latest and 
greatest telecommunications infrastructure, not to mention other utilities, 
such as power.
 
Because of technological advancements, it doesn’t matter whether you’re 
locating your call center in a different city, county, region, state, or province 
from the company’s other operations; telecommunications can link everything 
seamlessly. Call centers have been locating away from the home office or cus-
tomer base — a practice called geographic outsourcing — for a long time. If 
a company that was based in New York moved all or part of its operations 
from New York to Iowa, for example, that move would represent geographic 
outsourcing.
Considering the available workforce
Whether or not you decide to build close to home, you always have to con-
sider the availability of sufficient employees who have the skills that your call 
center needs. Here are a few factors to consider:
 
✓ Labor costs: You must find out the average wage rate in the target area. 
To justify locating your call center away from home, it makes sense 
to gain an advantage — preferably, a significant advantage — in labor 
costs. Generally, you can staff a call center more cheaply in a small town 
than in a booming metropolis. When you consider that labor accounts 
for more than 60 percent of your costs, you need to take this consider-
ation seriously.
 
✓ Population base: Factor in the percentage of staff turnover in a year, as 
well as call center growth. The population base of your target area has 
to be able to sustain more than just your immediate needs.
 
 To test whether a market has sufficient qualified labor, call center man-
agers place newspaper recruitment ads and then review the volume and 
quantity of candidates who come forward. A good response makes the 
market a candidate for the new call center.
 
 Réal’s company has developed a recruiting application by using interac-
tive voice response (IVR). (We talk more about IVR in Chapter 9.) When 
looking for new sites, the company advertises in several communities, 
giving each community a unique number to call. Candidates call the IVR 
system, which prescreens applicants. Then the IVR system gives the 
company the volume of interest and an initial indication of the quality of 
applicants.
 
✓ Educational institutions: Does your target area include educational 
institutions? If so, do those institutions offer programs that support your 
business’s needs, providing training in the skill requirements that you’ll 

71
 Chapter 4: Building a Call Center of Your Own
be hiring for? Additional training is a significant call center cost, so it 
pays dividends to locate your center in an area that has an abundant 
supply of educated employees. Also, communities that include univer-
sity or college campuses are a great source of part-time and summer-
replacement employees.
 
✓ Availability of qualified managers: Make sure that you can get a quali-
fied management team in your new location. Many planners have built a 
call center in a remote location only to have a tough time placing a quali-
fied management team there. Sure, you may be able to train some of the 
call center agents to be managers, but that training takes time.
Locating near other facilities 
in the corporation
Is your call center integrated with your organization’s other functions? Does 
corporate management need to have an ongoing presence in the call center? 
If the answer to both of these questions is yes, you want to locate close to 
the corporate head office.
Also, can you consider a call center job to be an entry-level position that 
leads to other roles within the company? If so, staying close to home makes 
sense, because the call center can become a labor pool for the organization.
Building the call center near existing corporate facilities and capabilities — 
data processing, human resources, recruiting, and training — can provide 
cost advantages. You can save on personnel costs because you don’t nec-
essarily have to fill certain roles that duplicate those in place at your head 
office, and the availability of facilities such as training and meeting rooms can 
help avert the cost of extra buildings for the call center.
 
On a more warm and fuzzy level, your organization may want to promote a 
strong sense of corporate community and teamwork, and keeping the call 
center close to the home office can certainly contribute to that feeling.
Getting close to your customers
You may find advantages in locating close to your customers, especially when 
your product or service requires a significant degree of local knowledge.
You can ensure cultural familiarity by keeping the call center in the market 
that serves your customers. By locating within your own country but in a 
different state or province, however, you may not lose much in the way of 

72
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
customer service while gaining the advantage of lower costs and increased 
capacity — particularly if your market is one with relatively high labor costs, 
such as Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, or London.
 
In Chapter 10, we talk about customer relationship management (CRM) soft-
ware, which gives agents information about customers’ interests and pref-
erences. If you want to create a trusting relationship with customers, your 
agents should know a bit about where those customers reside. Therefore, 
include in agent training geographical information about the countries and 
cities that your call center serves.
Being far, far away from your customers
If your company wants to reduce operating costs and feels that cost-saving 
options won’t significantly affect customer service, you have three options 
for locating a call center:
 
✓ Offshore (far from your company’s country)
 
✓ Near shore (in a neighboring country)
 
✓ A combination of offshore and near shore
We discuss all three options in the following sections.
Locating offshore
By far the least costly alternative on a purely operational basis is moving 
your call center operations offshore. Locating in places such as Central 
America, the Caribbean, South Africa, India, the Philippines, or China can 
greatly decrease labor costs. It can also provide a large pool of highly edu-
cated and skilled people who are looking for work. (In India, for example, 
millions of people graduate from university every year.) In many of these 
countries, the availability of jobs falls well behind the country’s ability to pro-
duce a skilled workforce.
Also, contrary to the stigma sometimes attached to working in a call center 
in North America, call center jobs are coveted in many other countries. 
Although an MBA grad in Montreal might not give much thought to a call 
center job, an MBA grad in Manila would jump at the chance. As we discuss 
in Chapter 14, motivation is at least half of what makes up agent perfor-
mance, so finding a location where qualified people truly value the work may 
be the single most important site criterion.
 
Moving your call center offshore comes with significant risk, because cultural 
differences can create communication and operational challenges. You also 
need to do a lot of research and project planning, and possibly create a per-
manent home-office management presence on-site to alleviate potential con-
trol and communication issues.

73
 Chapter 4: Building a Call Center of Your Own
Locating near shore
Near-shore locations are call centers placed in a neighboring country. U.S. 
corporations often locate call centers in Canada or Mexico, for example, and 
many firms in England locate call centers in Ireland.
Locating your call center near shore is an easy and often viable alternative 
to offshoring; the center is close to the company’s home country, so you 
probably don’t have to deal with significant language, education, and cultural 
issues.
A near-shore location is essentially just an extension of the geographic diver-
sification within your company’s own country, and you can gain some signifi-
cant advantages in available labor pools, cost of labor, education, and skill 
level of interested labor.
Implementing a combined option
If you’re seriously thinking about pursuing an offshore location, you may 
want to consider moving your call center operations in two steps:
 
1. Move a portion of your operations to a nearby location in a less-
expensive labor market.
 
 After your organization gains experience running a remote location, you 
can begin the offshore project.
 
2. Run the two operations simultaneously, or begin the process of 
moving all operations offshore.
The company benefits from multiple labor pools, redundancy in case any call 
center needs to be shut down (say, during a snowstorm), and a blended wage 
rate that’s lower than what the company has onshore but higher than the 
lowest rate possible if all the calls went offshore. For some businesses, this 
approach provides a nice mix of cost control and capability.
 
If you’re not sure about taking your call center to a far-off land, consider test-
ing the waters by sending some of your simpler calls or other work offshore. 
By creating a blend of your local call center (doing the more complex and 
valuable work) and the offshore call center (doing the simpler and less valu-
able work), your company can test the offshore option and lower its overall 
cost. Sending only your simple calls offshore may be all you need to do.
Going big-city versus rural
Although locating your call center in a big city can increase the availability of 
labor, the competition for labor at higher wages also increases. A call center in 
the middle of a large residential community has its employee base close 
by — a prime consideration for people who may come to work for you. An 

74
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
inaccessible call center throws up a roadblock to attracting the greatest 
number of highly qualified employees.
Small communities, on the other hand, often have a strong culture of support 
for customer service operations. Often, a new call center becomes a signifi-
cant employer in a small community, reducing unemployment and building 
immediate company loyalty within the entire community.
You can staff call centers more easily if you locate them in or near the com-
munities where people live — meaning near the skilled target labor that you 
require. Attract employees to your center by making the commute easy for 
them.
Setting Up Shop
Regardless of where you decide to locate your call center, you need to think 
about what that call center will look like and any special needs that you may 
have. Creating facilities for disabled agents, for example, can broaden the 
number of candidates you can attract.
Beyond bricks and mortar: 
Planning the facilities
After you settle on a location for your call center, what will you actually 
put there? The term call center describes the operation quite well, actually. 
Agents answer calls, and you centralize the operations by handling them in 
one place, either real or virtual.
Most call centers have one or more large rooms that have a lot of grouped 
workstations, which include desks for the agents, electronic terminals, 
phones, headsets, chairs, and so on. Workstations come in many designs, 
including the everyone-wedged-in-together “I can hear your heart beating” 
style and the everything-exposed-to-the-all-powerful-corner-office “I’ve got 
an eye on you” style. Somewhere in the middle exists a nice place to work, 
which is spacious, quiet, and pleasant.
 
Design the call center for one major purpose: to answer calls. Focus on the 
actual call center — the big room that holds all the people. Set up everything 
else that you add to the facility so that it supports the call center. Make wash-
rooms easily accessible, for example, so that agents aren’t required to make 
long walks. Similarly, make the washrooms large enough to prevent lineups 
that could cause agents to miss parts of their shifts. Design all other rooms in 
the facility in a way that ensures convenience.

75
 Chapter 4: Building a Call Center of Your Own
Usually, a call center includes specialized rooms set up in different areas of 
the building:
 
✓ Data center: A secure and separate room that holds the computer serv-
ers and telephone equipment.
 
✓ Training rooms: Rooms in which your business conducts training 
sessions. Many training rooms include whiteboards and audiovisual 
equipment, and some have workstation setups for simulations and role-
playing scenarios.
 
 Make your training rooms large enough and plentiful enough to accom-
modate more than one training class at the same time.
 
✓ Meeting rooms: Rooms for conducting meetings. A meeting room can be 
anything from a small room with a desk and a couple of chairs (which 
you could use for conducting interviews or one-on-one meetings) to a 
lavish boardroom with leather chairs and a mahogany table that could 
seat the population of a small country.
 
✓ Lunchroom: Yep, a room in which employees can eat lunch. Generally, 
call center lunchrooms include cafeteria-style tables and chairs, as well 
as a kitchen for agents who bring their lunch and vending machines for 
agents who work in the middle of the night. Make sure that the lunch-
room really accommodates your employees and their shifts. Providing 
too few seats frustrates employees, and not providing enough amenities 
(such as microwaves) leads to lineups that can delay agents’ return to 
work after lunch. Some call centers have on-site hot/cold food services, 
which you may want to consider, especially if your call center isn’t near 
a lot of outside facilities.
 
✓ Offices for various managers: Most centers have offices for executives, 
directors, and any managers who require more privacy than the typical 
cubicle world affords.
You may want to go further, as some operations do, and add some nice ame-
nities for the staff. You don’t need the following amenities, but they make the 
call center environment a little more fun and a nicer place to work:
 
✓ Game room: The job of a call center agent can be stressful, so some 
companies provide their employees a room in which to unwind and 
enjoy their break time. Some game rooms include videogame consoles, 
television sets, table-tennis and air-hockey equipment, and the like.
 
✓ Quiet rooms: Quiet rooms offer a place to unwind after or in the middle 
of a hectic day. These rooms often include reclining chairs or sofas and 
books or magazines for agents to read.

76
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Designing the ideal space
Your call center needs a good design because you want to build it for maxi-
mum efficiency — from a cost-reduction standpoint, of course, but also for 
efficiency in operations. You don’t want to have team leaders hunting for 
agents, agents hunting for team leaders, or anyone hunting for the tools that 
he needs to do his job.
Average workspace depends largely on the type of culture you want to 
create. Make sure that your agents have ample room to do their work, with 
their team leaders in their row working alongside them. When you use this 
setup, agents can get the support they need, and the team leader has access 
to the pulse of the business.
 
When designing the layout for your center, make sure that all your employees 
have ample room to work. The workspace-per-call-center-desktop area can 
vary substantially, from less than 50 square feet per desk to upward of 
150 square feet per desk. To encourage open communication, many centers 
use low partitions between workstations to enable line of sight across the call 
center without increasing noise levels.
One possible call center layout is what we call the zigzag configuration. Often 
touted as being employee-friendly and efficient, this configuration places the 
team leader’s workstation at the end of the row. Other possibilities include 
linear and pod configurations. Base your choice on the amount of real estate 
available and the type of culture you want to create.
 
Don’t scrimp on office furniture, getting some tattered hand-me-downs to save 
a few dollars. Agents may feel that the company doesn’t value them if you give 
them chairs that provide poor back support or that have stains, or if you offer 
a dingy, poorly ventilated work environment. Also, you may have to spend a 
lot of money later to bring your facilities up to par, because a poor work envi-
ronment could lead to agent turnover or absenteeism.
 
Naturally, for cost control, you want to maximize the use of your space, but if 
you try to cram too many desks into one operation, you have to worry about 
noise control. No bunk-bed-type stations, please!
Understanding environmental issues
The environment that your management team creates — how management 
treats agents and whether those agents feel valued — has greater impact 
on employee morale than creature comforts and paintings on the walls do. 

77
 Chapter 4: Building a Call Center of Your Own
Still, some environmental factors can go a long way toward making your call 
center a great place to work:
 
✓ Availability and control of natural light and temperature
 
✓ Noise control
 
✓ Comfortable desks and chairs
 
✓ Cleanliness/neatness
 
✓ Ample eating and resting areas
 
✓ Conveniences such as a hot-food cafeteria, relaxation rooms, and lockers
 
✓ Convenient access via public transportation and affordable parking
 
In today’s multicultural society, religious needs may arise, such as a place 
where people can pray during their shifts. Good call centers make accommo-
dations to meet those kinds of needs without disrupting the business.
Taking special needs into account
Your call center can open doors to people who have a variety of special 
needs because technology makes it possible to overcome many disabilities in 
the workplace. Some special-needs concerns include
 
✓ Wheelchair access: The call center should have wide aisles and wheelchair-
accessible desks, offices, elevators, washrooms, and parking.
 
✓ Amenities for visually impaired employees: The call center can provide 
reader software, which reads text information from computer systems 
to the employee, or special monitors that expand the size of text on a 
computer screen. You may also want to consider in your design how 
you can help visually impaired employees navigate the call center, per-
haps by providing Braille signage, railings, and the like.
 
Creating accommodations for employees who have special needs isn’t only a 
socially responsible thing to do, but also good business, because people who 
have disabilities are a large, often-overlooked source of highly skilled labor.
Building a Call Center 
One Step at a Time
Table 4-1 summarizes some of the tasks that Réal’s company performs in 
building call centers. Your call center probably has to take other consider-
ations into account, but you can use this table as a good start.

Task
Steps
6. Decide on renting, buying, 
or building.
Contact the local economic development office in 
your area to see whether you can get any subsidies 
or information about facilities that are suitable for a 
call center.
Contact local commercial real estate agents.
Consider zoning within municipalities, because 
a call center qualifies as commercial real estate. 
Check whether you can locate in a residential area 
or have to stay in a commercial-zoned area.
Investigate government subsidy or support pro-
grams: skills training, facilities-related subsidies, 
tax reductions or deferrals, and so on.
Create a short list of suitable properties for lease or 
purchase.
Conduct a comparative analysis of leasing, buying, 
or building.
Contact an architect to design the call center to 
your specific needs.
7. Create a project plan.
Create a budget for construction or renovation, as 
well as for running the center.
List all tasks (such as installing the technical infra-
structure and ordering equipment), timelines, and 
the people who are responsible for those tasks.
Get approval from senior management.
8. Implement the plan.
Assign a project manager to orchestrate the imple-
mentation of the plan, and get going!
Creating the plan
After the project team determines the building and budget details, it can 
create an implementation plan. This plan identifies all the steps necessary 
to launch the new call center, including creating budgets for how much the 
center will cost to build and to run; defining and documenting initial work 
processes; hiring and training staff; installing furniture, equipment, and tech-
nology; and answering the first calls. The implementation plan should include 
time frames and deadlines for launching the call center.

80
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
When you complete the implementation plan, you can present it to someone 
in senior management for approval. If you have a sponsor in senior manage-
ment who created the mission for the call center and will work with the call 
center to establish annual business objectives, she provides the mandate 
to build the call center; makes the final decision about where to locate; and 
approves the budget, including commitment of capital.
Managing the project
First, you want to assign a project manager — the person responsible for 
keeping the call center project on track. The project manager tracks tasks 
and accountabilities, and hounds anyone who falls behind. Be sure to select 
someone who has experience with project management.
Also pull together a team of people who have expertise in human resources, 
facilities management, technology, staff planning, and general call center 
management.
After senior management blesses the project, the project manager assembles 
the project team, and the team members begin to go through the plan-
ning process, during which they cover the tasks listed in Table 4-1 (refer to 
“Building a Call Center One Step at a Time,” earlier in this chapter).
Planning for Problems
Business continuity is all about ensuring that you can continue to do business 
if something disastrous happens to your call center’s location, people, or 
tools. Disaster recovery involves getting your call center back to the way it 
was before that disaster befell it.
Every call center needs some form of plan for business continuity and disas-
ter recovery. The sophistication of your plan and the protection it offers 
depend largely on the effect on the organization if it loses the call center for 
even a short time.
Some companies can’t function without their call centers; therefore, they 
consider the call centers to be critical. An airline’s ticket and reservations 
center, for example, serves a critical purpose for that organization. It deals 
with customers purchasing tickets and offers customer service for travelers 
when they want to change their travel dates. If the call center shuts down 
for any extended period, the airline loses money because customers will go 

81
 Chapter 4: Building a Call Center of Your Own
to other airlines to purchase their tickets. Having a business continuity and 
disaster recovery plan in place ensures that customers can always reach the 
ticket and reservations center.
A disaster recovery plan may involve ensuring that you back up all call 
center data daily so that you can access that data if something happens to 
the primary facility. To ensure business continuity, you might reduce your 
risk of a loss of service by having multiple centers or employing home agents 
(see Chapter 11), as well as having a complete mirror backup of the call 
center and its tools on standby, just waiting to be used.
 
You can plan for almost anything — at a cost — and when you’re planning 
for business continuity and disaster recovery, you have to balance the cost 
with the risk of loss. For more information on this critical topic, see IT Disaster 
Recovery Planning For Dummies, by Peter Gregory (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
 
Many call centers conduct simulated crisis situations on a regular basis to 
assess the effectiveness of their business continuity and disaster recovery 
plans. Recording and reporting the results from these exercises provides the 
opportunity to fine-tune your plans and make them more effective.
Multiple locations
Business continuity and disaster recovery provide good reason to have mul-
tiple sites in separate cities, if possible. This way, you can duplicate your 
system requirements, building in some redundancy — meaning that you can 
route calls in several ways so that if one route goes down, you still have the 
other routes available and open. Having multiple sites also provides some 
security against temporary localized issues, such as severe weather, power 
interruptions, workforce fluctuations . . . or a plague of locusts.
Stand-alone call centers
If you’re in a stand-alone operation, consider the following:
 
✓ Remember your ABCDs (Always Back up Critical Data). Your opera-
tions should include a backup of critical data at least daily.
 
✓ Have redundant services. You may want to make your entire data 
center redundant (meaning that you have a copy of the data center) and 
locate it off-site. You also need some sort of redundancy to power your 
center. As a short-term option, you can have an uninterruptible power 
supply (UPS) for your computer system. A UPS may work for about 

82
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
20 minutes to an hour and will keep you going while the longer-term 
solution — a diesel generator — kicks in.
 
✓ Use a business continuity service. Business continuity services offer 
sites that sit empty, with the capabilities that your call center needs 
(telephone systems, computers, and operating systems) just waiting to 
be used. They can also include data backup capabilities, which can help 
you with disaster recovery.
 
✓ Engage an outsourcer. Splitting work with an outsourcer (which we 
discuss in Chapter 5) can help you balance workload, act as a frame of 
reference for the quality of your service, and provide a level of business 
continuity.
 
 You can work with an outsourcer in many ways:
 
• Send the outsourcer a consistent percentage of your overall 
volume. In this case, the outsourcer gets the same call types that 
you do.
 
• Use your outsourcer’s call handling to see how well your internal 
organization handles calls.
 
• If your call center ever has a weather-related power failure, route 
all your volume to the outsourcer. Sure, the outsourcer may 
become overwhelmed by the additional volume, but at least you’re 
not out of business.
 
• If you outsource work that you can stop at a moment’s notice, such 
as outbound collections or telemarketing, the outsourcer may be 
able to temporarily increase the number of calls it can take in the 
event of a disaster at your primary site.
Networked call centers
If your call center is part of a network of call centers, you already have a 
degree of business continuity and disaster recovery built in. In this case, you 
need to consider the following:
 
✓ Whether your network has a single point of failure: Can one thing 
bring down the entire network if that thing fails?
 
✓ Whether the remaining center(s) can handle the additional volume: 
If so, for how long? If you have two centers working at full capacity, and 
if one center goes down, the other center can’t take the first center’s 
calls. You’d need to find an outsourcer that could take these additional 
calls or build another center that would go to work only if a disaster 
occurred.

83
 Chapter 4: Building a Call Center of Your Own
Preparing for a possible disaster
Disaster preparation might include provisions 
for quickly accessing the following:
 ✓ Backup batteries and generators: As we 
mention in “Stand-alone call centers,” ear-
lier in this chapter, you need to install a UPS 
and a diesel generator.
 ✓ Your manual (paper-based) processes: You 
need to be able to access customer infor-
mation and call tracking in the event that 
the data network fails.
 ✓ Your telephone network: For a fee, you can 
gain control of your phone network so that 
you can route customer calls to another 
center quickly.
 ✓ The services of a business continuity 
center: This type of center is ready to go 
when you need it, using your own staff.
 ✓ The services of a third-party outsourcer: 
Keep an overflow agreement in place so 
that the outsourcer becomes familiar with 
your business and customers.

Choosing the Outsourcing Option
In This Chapter
▶ Considering the benefits and drawbacks of outsourcing
▶ Choosing an outsourcing partner
▶ Figuring out the details of the transition (before it happens!)
▶ Working with your outsourcer
A
 Google search for call center outsourcer generates results for more than 
15,000 companies that do call center outsourcing. Some of these com-
panies claim to do everything from inbound and outbound sales, customer 
service, and help lines to technical and product support. Which type would 
you choose, and why? How would you go about making that decision?
Mix into that decision the opportunity to choose an outsourcer that oper-
ates in some faraway place, where you can supposedly save so much money 
that it sounds too good to be true. With the ever-present pressure to reduce 
operational costs, examining all options (which includes moving your calls to 
an outsourcer) can give you a competitive edge.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the possibility of getting someone else to 
run your call center and what it means to you and your company on both the 
upside and the downside. We help you compare the costs, benefits, and risks 
of outsourcing your operation versus keeping it in-house.
If you decide to move forward, the rest of the chapter is devoted to getting 
you started, providing tips on choosing an outsourcing partner and creating 
a contract that allows you to meet your goals. To keep your new relationship 
productive and strong, we also share with you best practices that can set you 
and your outsourcer on the road to success.

Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Understanding the Benefits 
and Risks of Outsourcing
Throughout the industry, you can find passionate discussions about the pros 
and cons of outsourcing. The following sections present the well-known ben-
efits and risks of outsourcing.
Potential benefits
Here are some good reasons to outsource. Outsourcing allows you to
 
✓ Reduce your costs: The most compelling reason to outsource is that 
it can potentially save you 30 percent to 50 percent of your call center 
costs. An outsourcer typically pays lower wage rates for comparable 
jobs (such as agent wages and management salaries), provides central-
ized support functions such as human resources, and offers technology 
and technology-support personnel that can help increase productivity. 
An additional cost advantage comes from sharing technology, pro-
cesses, and support functions within the entire client base (meaning 
other companies just like yours).
 
✓ Control your costs: Customers’ calling patterns aren’t always predictable, 
and during unpredictable periods, call volume can move up or down by 
as much as 50 percent. Also, during these periods, you may have little 
control of your customers’ experience and may have to deal with extra 
unknown costs. Outsourcing your operation to cover business peaks or 
off-hour operations converts these unknown costs to known costs. If you 
use an outsourcer, you can increase your flexibility, provide a better cus-
tomer experience, and change these unpredictable fluctuating costs (vari-
able costs) to ones that you can predict (fixed costs).
 
✓ Speed time to market: Companies that are just starting up or perhaps 
launching a new business unit, product, or marketing campaign often 
outsource some or all of their call center operations. Giving this part 
of their business to an outsourcer allows these companies to focus on 
other areas and gives them the advantage of getting to market faster.
 
 A startup bank gave back-office operations to an outsourcer that had 
the regulatory knowledge and operational competency to process its 
transactions. Even though the bank was in a different location from the 
outsourcer, the service was transparent to customers, and the bank was 
able to provide good service at a lower cost because it outsourced — a 
win–win situation for both the bank and the outsourcer.
 
✓ Increase your capability and expertise: As technology and business 
processes become increasingly specialized, you might consider out-
sourcing for capability, not cost. Some companies use an outsourcer 

87
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Outsourcing Option
to broaden their service offering to customers by combining a process 
with an outsourcer’s technology. Some outsourcers have multimedia 
capability and the expertise to handle Web chat, e-mail, and text mes-
saging; others specialize in areas such as outbound calling to prospect 
for customers.
 
 One financial-services company that we know outsources its outbound 
calling for two reasons: It doesn’t have highly proficient and skilled agents 
who can make this type of call, and it doesn’t want to disrupt its agent 
pool because many outbound calling programs can run for a short time. 
Outsourcing makes sense in this case, because the company doesn’t have 
to deal with reallocating or terminating agents when the program is over.
Potential risks
Calculating risk isn’t a perfect science, so you may have to make a best guess 
to estimate the costs of these risks. When you add these estimated costs to 
your cost comparison, you can get a balanced view of the true cost of out-
sourcing, which includes the costs of risks like the following:
 
✓ Decision made on cost alone: Based on the many juicy stories about sig-
nificant cost savings from outsourcing, some companies make this deci-
sion without doing any analysis. You can take the potential risk out of 
the decision by taking time to do a comparison, using the age-old pros-
and-cons method for choosing an outsourced center versus running 
your operation yourself. Cost is just one of many factors to consider.
Uh-oh . . . we didn’t guess that would happen!
A telecommunications company with declining 
revenue and profit decided that outsourcing 
was the key to reducing costs both significantly 
and quickly. It moved forward without doing too 
much planning and without understanding the 
length of time it would take to integrate its sys-
tems and processes.
During the outsourcer’s first implementation 
of the call center, technology installation took 
three months longer to install than planned, and 
it took the new agents more than six months to 
perform at the level proclaimed by the business 
plan. As a result, the company lost revenue 
and added expense because of the number of 
customer complaints that were streaming in. 
Because those complaints took time to handle, 
and because it’s difficult to sell to a customer 
who is unhappy and wants a resolution of his 
or her problem, costs went up, and sales went 
down.
By working with the outsourcer, this company 
rectified its challenges. Still, the call center took 
12 months longer than planned to achieve the 
results that senior management was promised, 
so first-year savings were actually first-year 
losses. The lesson: Plan for and understand 
the level of effort it will take to move calls to an 
outsourcer.

88
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
 
✓ Failure to fix internal service problems first: Some companies think 
that starting outsourced call centers with brand-new agents will solve 
their customer service problems. What really happens is that the ser-
vice goes from bad to worse, because the outsourcer’s agents have less 
experience than the company agents who were handling these service 
issues. The right thing to do is figure out what is causing your service 
problems and fix them before you hand your calls over to an outsourcer.
 
✓ Selection of the wrong partner: Choosing the wrong partner can cost even 
a small company more than $500,000 U.S. per year in lost revenue, custom-
ers, and productivity. You can minimize this risk by defining what you’re 
trying to solve, obtaining tangible evidence that the outsourcer can deliver, 
and completing an objective assessment. (For tips on selecting a partner, 
see “Picking the Right Outsourcing Partner,” later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Loss of flexibility: Your ability to change direction may be hindered 
by an outsourcing relationship or contract. You may not be able to make 
changes as quickly as you want because you have to go through 
many channels of communication first. In addition, you need to think 
out all changes carefully, because those changes may result in additional 
fees charged by the outsourcer.
Deciding Whether to Outsource
On first thought, you may be very excited about the prospect of saving 
money and having someone else deal with the trials and tribulations of run-
ning a complex operation. In the following sections, however, we give you a 
framework to help you figure out the best option for your company based on 
facts, not on opinion.
Going through this process gives you not only greater clarity about the deci-
sion, but also confidence about the decision. By presenting these facts, you 
can bring others in your company on board, therefore making the final deci-
sion easier for those who may be affected by the decision.
Clarifying your internal costs
If you understand how much it costs you today to serve your customers, 
you can use that information to determine whether you can indeed save any 
money if you move your calls to an outsourcer.
In the majority of cases, companies can run their call centers more cheaply 
through outsourcers than through an in-house call center while getting the 
same quality of work. Many in-house call center people argue that outsourcing 
isn’t actually cheaper. They say, “I pay my staff $12.50 per hour, but the out-
sourcer wants $29 per hour.”

89
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Outsourcing Option
That statement, however, is like comparing apples and gorilla feet. The out-
sourcer’s $29 per hour includes everything from agents’ pay to the team 
leader’s pay, the trainer’s pay, the cost of the desks and phone system, the 
cost of having the carpet cleaned when a visitor drops a cup of coffee on it, 
and so on.
Building your own call center can cost more than $10,000 on a per-seat basis. 
By using an outsourcer, you can turn this capital cost into a variable cost. 
Réal’s research and experience suggest that outsourcing typically reduces a 
company’s call center operating costs by more than 30 percent.
Most in-house corporate call centers should look at their true hourly costs. 
To do a comparison, you have to create a point of reference. We call that 
reference point, which consists of your true hourly costs, your baseline. 
Measure all other options or possibilities against this baseline.
 
We suggest that you use cost per hour as the measure for this comparison 
because many outsourcers use this measure or a variation of this measure 
(such as cost per minute). To calculate your true cost per hour, you need to 
define what’s included in your costs and in the time measurement.
 
Some outsourcers charge by cost per call or some other measure. Just ask 
them to convert that charge to cost per production hour so that you can make 
an apples-to-apples comparison.
Determining overall costs
We’ve seen many faulty comparisons of the cost of running an in-house call 
center versus outsourcing — comparisons that include certain expenses that 
shouldn’t be included. Take the time to identify the expenses that will remain 
in your budget regardless of who answers the phone.
 
A good example is the credit or money back that you may give customers to 
compensate for errors made or inconvenience caused. This type of expense 
will continue regardless of who handles your calls: you or the outsourcer. 
If you tally up your costs and don’t include the line item called Credits or 
Refunds in your list of expenses, your overall costs will appear to be higher 
than the outsourcer’s costs. By removing these kinds of expenses from your 
calculations, you level the playing field, allowing you to complete a valid com-
parison of costs.
The budget categories shown in Table 5-1 can help you group your costs. 
From this table, you can easily determine which costs will continue to be 
your responsibility and which ones the outsourcer’s fee includes. We’ve 
boldfaced the costs that many companies should leave out when they calcu-
late their internal cost per hour to run the function or operation that they’re 
considering outsourcing. In Chapter 6, we describe these costs in detail.

Determining your measuring stick
The industry-standard efficiency measure is cost per production hour, which 
references the time devoted to serving customers directly. You calculate 
production hours by adding talk time, after-call time, and time waiting for the 
next call.

91
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Outsourcing Option
 
Be sure to know which time measurement you’re paying for. Does the out-
sourcer charge you for paid hours or production hours? Paid hours include all 
the hours that the outsourcer uses to run your operation: breaks, lunches, vaca-
tion hiring, training of new agents to replace those who left the company, and so 
on. In the outsourcing industry, the outsourcer typically bears these costs, 
which are included in the hourly rate. Production hours, on the other hand, are 
hours devoted to serving the customer: talk time, after-call time, and time wait-
ing for the next call. Before you go any further with a potential outsourcer, make 
sure that it charges only for production hours, not for paid hours.
Calculating baseline costs
Because we recommend using cost per production hour, you can easily tally 
all the costs in Table 5-1 and divide them by your production hours (talk time 
plus after-call time plus time waiting for a call) to get your cost per produc-
tion hour. With this figure, you can accurately compare in-house costs with 
an outsourcer’s cost per production hour.
Adding hidden costs to 
your outsourcer’s cost
In determining the overall cost of moving to an outsourcer, many companies 
don’t factor in ongoing costs, which include the labor cost of managing the 
outsourcer relationship. Also, they often forget the one-time costs associated 
with the transition to an outsourcer and ongoing costs for future events, such 
as training for a new marketing promotion. Include these costs in your com-
parison, and add them to the overall cost associated with the outsourcer. 
The following sections discuss costs that you should include in costs associ-
ated with moving to an outsourcer.
Cost to launch
Determine who else you need to involve in your company to select, negotiate, 
and set up the operation at the outsourcer’s site, as well as the person whose 
full-time or part-time job involves being the main point of contact for your 
outsourcer (the vendor manager). One person may take on all these tasks, 
or a team of people could be responsible for recruitment, training, finance, 
and setting up computer or telephone networks. You may need to create a 
job profile for agents (recruitment); document core knowledge and soft skills 
required to deliver your service (training); create design and project plans of 
your computer systems for the outsourcer’s operation (IT); and set up finan-
cial tracking, controls, and reporting (finance).

92
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Factor in the labor costs for these additional resources when you determine 
the costs associated with your outsourcer. After you launch your program 
with the outsourcer and move into production, you may not need these 
resources to the same extent.
Following are some additional costs that you will incur and should factor into 
your cost comparison:
 
✓ Integrating your technology at the outsourcer’s site
 
✓ Procuring new telephone numbers and lines
 
✓ Designing and printing training and marketing materials
 
✓ Recruiting, orienting, and training new employees and managers
 
✓ Paying various fees (such as licensing fees for technology, insurance, 
and government fees)
 
✓ Hiring consultants to help you with the whole process (from selecting 
the outsourcer to transitioning your calls)
 
✓ Upgrading your Internet and intranet to accommodate the new location 
and people
These costs can grow significantly, depending on the complexity of the work 
that you’re outsourcing.
Cost of travel
Before and after you move your calls to an outsourcer, you and others 
involved in this project occasionally need to go to the outsourcer’s site. The 
outsourcer needs your expertise to solve problems, train its staff and man-
agers in your systems and processes, and further understand your expecta-
tions. You have to add costs for time and travel based on the distance of 
travel, frequency of travel, and length of stay. If you pick an outsourcer that’s 
overseas or on another continent, for example, you may have significant 
direct travel costs and lost productivity for the travelers, and those costs 
carry on for the length of the relationship.
 
It’s a best practice to have your team on site for a minimum of one month — 
maybe more, depending on the complexity of your products, services, and 
processes. One of our clients sent a team of four to its outsourcer, and that 
team stayed two months to train, roll out new processes, and put the client’s 
quality-assurance program in place.
Your first-year savings may be less than you expect because of these one-
time costs — especially if your call center doesn’t get many calls in the first 
place. If you outsource 30 people to a faraway country, the cost of sending 
over your technology, human resources, and training teams could equal what 
you’d pay for 130 in-house agents.

93
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Outsourcing Option
Cost of severance
If you have to lay off staff from your current operation, you have to distribute 
severance pay, maintain benefits for a given period, and possibly provide 
outplacement support. These costs may reduce or even eliminate your first-
year outsourcing savings.
 
If you’re really going to realize savings, you must reduce employee head count. 
You just don’t have an option. Many companies shed the required number of 
agents but miss the fact that other groups that support the agents also need to 
be downsized. If you need 10 support-staff members to assist 100 agents, you 
probably can assume that 60 agents need 6 members of support staff, not 10.
Cost of setting up technology
When you move your calls to an outsourcer, you have to pay to divert 
existing phone lines or perhaps set up new phones lines, provide remote 
access, or integrate your computer systems with the outsourcer’s systems. 
Sometimes, you have to pay extra software licensing costs for a different 
site, even if you use the same number of agents. Check with your software 
provider to find out whether outsourcing would lead to software-related addi-
tional costs.
Cost of lost revenue from lost productivity
You create a flawed comparison if you don’t include assumptions of lost rev-
enue due to lost productivity during employee training.
If you lay off 100 agents who have high collective competence and replace 
them with 100 rookies, you should absolutely expect a period of time in 
which the new agents are building their knowledge and honing their skill. 
(Think about it: When you started your first job, were you performing at 
the same level as others? Most likely, you were learning from your mistakes 
instead.)
During this time, you will incur expenses such as the cost of errors, the need 
for rework (doing the same thing many times before getting it right), and the 
frequency of customer complaints. (Because we visit three to four centers 
every month, we can tell you that most complaints involve an average of four 
to seven calls from the customer before resolution.) All these errors and 
complaints drive additional calls into your center, thereby increasing cost.
 
Many outsourcers keep their prices low by paying agents and team leaders 
less than the wages offered by your company (which is probably why you’re 
considering this option). But an outsourcer often has significantly more attri-
tion (staff turnover) than you do, and its team can never be at the same level 
of competence as your current team because it always has a higher percent-
age of agents in training. Some well-run outsourcers mitigate the wage differ-
ence quite well, but we’ve seen others that have 100 percent turnover each 
year!

Putting your comparison together
Creating a formal and well-defined recommendation document that captures 
all the elements we discuss in the preceding sections has its benefits. It can 
help you organize your thinking and force you to consider all the elements 
of your comparison, not just a few. Also, many large companies require an 
executive or board decision to make this strategic move, and the higher-ups 
will want to know that you have done your homework.
The following sections lay out a framework for a recommendation document.
Problem statement
Make your recommendation clear, and support it with a few well-thought-out 
reasons for your position on whether to outsource your call center. These 
reasons, when you put them together, can make a persuasive argument.
Qualitative benefits
You can’t quantify certain benefits, but they’re just as important as the cost 
benefits. Typically, these qualitative benefits increase customer satisfac-
tion and loyalty, but you may have trouble putting a number on the cost of 
customer dissatisfaction. Companies often cite the benefits to your custom-
ers of having access to the outsourcer’s state-of-the-art technology or the 
outsourcer’s ability to implement a process that your company doesn’t (or 
can’t) implement.
Quantitative benefits and return on investment
Include your cost comparison, which benchmarks your cost per hour against 
the outsourcer’s. You can best show the comparison by doing a return on 
investment (ROI) calculation — the money that you plan to spend to transi-
tion to the outsourcer minus the money you save after you pay off the money 
that you spent.
You may spend $500,000 to transition to an outsourcer, for example. If, by 
the end of the first year, you save $100,000, you have a return of 20 percent 
($100,000 ÷ $500,000). It’ll take you five years to pay back your initial invest-
ment of $500,000.
Although calculating ROI may not be a perfect science (you have to make 
many assumptions, some of which won’t be accurate), you want to know 
when you can see your investment paid off. After that point, you get to keep 
the savings.

 Chapter 5: Choosing the Outsourcing Option
Use this equation to calculate an expected ROI on outsourcing:
Annual difference between outsourcing costs and your current costs ÷ 
Investment to ramp up × 100 = ROI percentage
Risks
Be realistic about the possible risks and the ones that have the greatest 
likelihood of occurring. Any company that’s thinking about moving part of 
its existing call center to an outsourcer needs to consider the morale of the 
employees who remain. Because outsourcing tends to generate lower morale 
among employees, your business could experience higher attrition and/or 
lower productivity. Get feedback from others in the company, and incorpo-
rate possible risks from their points of view.
Another risk is possible negative publicity for the company if it moves work 
outside its home country — a significant risk if the business is well known 
nationally.
Implementation plan
Should you recommend moving to an outsourcer, you want to present a clear 
picture of the transition plan and the effects on the current business. After 
all, timing is everything! Including this section in your document helps senior 
management look at all the other projects going on in the business and deter-
mine whether outsourcing is the right place to invest the company’s time 
and money. For more information on creating an implementation plan, see 
“Planning the Transition,” later in this chapter.
Picking the Right Outsourcing Partner
After you do your homework, if you decide to proceed, you need to find the 
right partner. We say partner — not vendor — for a reason. This relationship 
is like a marriage. Take the time to do the research, and find out all you can 
about your “dates” before you pop the question. When you meet a potential 
partner and experience a spark of interest, you’ll have a lot of questions 
about what that company is and what it can do. That company will be happy 
to present to you all the things you want to know — but it will present that 
information in the best possible light because you’ll be interacting with sales-
people, not necessarily the folks you’ll be working with day in and day out.

96
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Following are some good questions to ask to help you determine whether an 
outsourcer is the right fit for you, regardless of cost:
 
✓ How has this company shown that it can fulfill all your primary needs?
 
✓ Does your company have a true connection with this outsourcer in 
terms of values and philosophy?
 
✓ Did the outsourcer even think of having you meet the team members who 
would be responsible for the day-to-day operations of your business?
 
✓ What was your first impression of the leadership team (not sales team)?
 
✓ Did the company pay attention to the details, respond promptly, and 
follow through on its promises during the due-diligence process?
 
✓ How confident are you that this company has the expertise to deliver 
what you need?
 
✓ Do you trust this company?
 
The profit motive causes some outsourcers to do things that they shouldn’t, 
such as cutting corners on technology, recruiting, and training costs, or taking 
on more clients or campaigns than they can effectively handle. Using a bad 
outsourcer can cost your business money, as well as damage your corporate 
image and customer relations.
Looking for outsourcers in 
all the right places
 
To find a list of reputable outsourcers, contact your regional call center asso-
ciation, ask others in the industry for referrals, or consider saving some time 
by hiring a call center consultant who knows the top-quality outsourcers in 
your area.
Requesting information and proposals
The typical evaluation process starts with putting together a request for infor-
mation (RFI), which is like dipping your toe into water to test the tempera-
ture. This request gives you a sense of what’s out there and whether those 
companies’ capabilities can satisfy your needs.
You create a request for proposal (RFP) when you’re sure that you want 
to move forward and invite a good selection of top-quality outsourcers to 
respond. Send your RFP to each of the candidates, and attach a nondisclo-
sure agreement that both parties can sign.

97
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Outsourcing Option
Table 5-2 lists some do’s and don’ts to consider when you request proposals 
from outsourcers.
Table 5-2 
Do’s and Don’ts of Requesting Proposals
Do
Don’t
Be clear about what you want the outsourcer 
to do.
Ask for the world — and be 
surprised when it comes with 
a high price tag.
Stick to your timetable and promises that you 
make to outsourcers about decisions.
Underestimate the time it takes 
to evaluate and make deci-
sions, especially when many 
people are involved in the 
decision-making process.
Set expectations, internally and externally, 
about the process and the time it takes to find 
the right partner. The timeline from RFP to 
decision-making can range from 6 to 12 weeks. 
Most of the delay involves internal decision-
making rather than waiting for the outsourcer 
to respond.
Make an outsourcer spend 
time responding if you don’t 
see it as being a serious con-
tender. It’s better to have a 
few high-quality candidates 
than to have many.
Ask your contenders to respond by using the 
same unit pricing so that you don’t have the 
extra work of converting cost-to-call figures to 
cost-to-productive-hour numbers.
Make the RFP long, and give 
the contenders a short time to 
respond. You may lose quality 
candidates that may not have 
time to respond.
Demonstrate your willingness to partner, and 
assume some of the burden of preparing the 
response yourself. A good rule is to ask for one 
signed hard copy and one electronic copy.
Overburden your contenders 
with labor- or resource-
intensive tasks. Asking for 
things like multiple hard 
copies, fancy bindings, and 
secure drives takes time 
away from the content of the 
response.
Evaluating responses
You can save time during the evaluation process by creating a list of your five 
most important needs. We’ve used this system with great success over the 
past few decades (goodness, are we dating ourselves?) by assigning a weight 
to each need that appears in the top five. This distinction helps a business 
prioritize its needs and determine whether the outsourcer can really support 
them. If your business needs specialized skills, such as Spanish or French 

98
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
service, to have successful customer interactions, you might place that skill 
in your top-five list.
Examples of other typical criteria are
 
✓ A track record of top-quality service to customers
 
✓ If you have a multilingual requirement, the ability of the outsourcer to 
attract agents who have your specific language requirements
 
✓ A track record of meeting and exceeding given targets
 
✓ Expertise and experience in your industry
 
✓ Cost
After you evaluate the responses, create a short list of outsourcers that meet 
all or most of your requirements. Then make your final choice from this list, 
as outlined in the following section.
Choosing an outsourcer
To choose the best outsourcer on your short list, follow these steps:
 
1. Invite each outsourcer on the list to a private meeting.
 
 At this meeting, have the outsourcer’s representatives expand on the 
company’s responses through a question-and-answer session.
 
2. Narrow the list of candidates again to two or three finalists.
 
 Based on your weighted point system (see the preceding section) and 
interviews, a few outsourcers will bubble to the top.
 
 If you have enough call volume to divide the work between two out-
sourcers, consider that strategy. Healthy competition drives the desire 
for higher performance and allows you to raise the bar over time.
 
3. Visit (don’t tour!) the finalists’ sites.
 
 A visit means that you meet and interview the leadership team and, if pos-
sible, some or all of the support staff (such as trainers, quality analysts, 
and perhaps agents) who handle customer complaints to find out the out-
sourcer’s level of expertise and its fit with your company’s culture.
 
 We recommend that you sit with some of the outsourcers’ agents and 
listen to their calls. This may not be possible, due to customer privacy 
issues, but it doesn’t hurt to ask. We also recommend that you make 
your visits on short notice so that the outsourcer doesn’t have much 
time to prepare. Short notice allows you to get a glimpse of what the call 
center typically looks like.
 
4. Complete your comparison, and make your decision.
 
5. Put together a recommendation document for senior management (as 
outlined in “Putting your comparison together,” earlier in this chapter).

99
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Outsourcing Option
Designing the contract documents
After you choose your partner, you need to create a contractual agreement. 
This agreement consists of two main parts:
 
✓ Master service-level agreement (MSA): Contains all the legal language 
and requirements that typically never change during the term of the 
agreement.
 
✓ Statement of work (SOW): A series of numbered schedules outlining 
your specific requirements. The SOW is more operational than the MSA, 
and you can adjust the requirements according to changes in circum-
stances during the course of the contract.
We describe both types of documents in the following sections.
 
Although you can have an unlimited number of SOWs, don’t get so specific 
that you can’t make a change when your business needs change. Spending 
countless hours documenting and mandating everything that you want your 
outsourcing partner to do isn’t a good use of time and money. Keep the docu-
ment simple and focused on the key issues. Your goals should be to create a 
good working relationship with your outsourcer partner and to establish a set 
of operating guidelines that reflect the intention of the MSA and associated 
SOWs.
Elements of the master service-level agreement (MSA)
Here are the contents of a typical MSA:
 
✓ Definitions (in alphabetical order): You should provide definitions so 
that both parties understand all the terms used. You might include a 
definition of what constitutes a business day or specifically explain the 
term intellectual property, for example.
 
✓ Nonoperational expectations associated with program management 
and key personnel: These expectations may include the exclusivity of 
your business — whether you allow your outsourcer to work with your 
competitors and, if so, how you keep the programs separate.
 
✓ Contract information: This information may include the term of the con-
tract, the notice period for nonrenewal, how and when both parties can 
call it quits, the dispute procedure, and a reference to the schedule that 
contains payment terms and fees.
 
✓ Notice requirements: These requirements may include notice of 
changes in work or site location. You may also specify that certain con-
ditions of the contract can’t change — an increase or reduction in the 
amount of work or a change in the type of work performed, for example.

100
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
 
✓ Guarantee of quality of work performed: This guarantee may include 
a requirement to comply with standard operating procedures and the 
right for you to audit the outsourcer’s work on-site or remotely, as well 
as have access to the outsourcer’s site.
 
✓ Guarantee of the outsourcer’s ability to keep data secure, confidential, 
and private: This part of the agreement may specify which party owns 
new customer data and any inventions created during the course of the 
contract. Other stipulations may require the outsourcer to ensure com-
pliance with privacy legislation, as well as confidentiality of data and 
information related to your business (such as status of your business 
and inside knowledge of your sales volume and revenue).
 
✓ Legal issues: These issues could include indemnity, which means that the 
company or the outsourcer will not be liable to pay damages to custom-
ers for information that was given inaccurately (error), left out (omission), 
or provided on behalf of the other party without authority to do so (mis-
representation). A large call center has many interactions with customers 
and, therefore, many opportunities for any of these situations to happen. 
As a result, many companies and outsourcers buy insurance to protect 
themselves against customer complaints in the event that customers hold 
one or both companies liable and potentially sue for damages.
 
 Other legal points to put into the contract involve what happens when 
either party doesn’t meet its contractual agreement. To resolve the dis-
pute, follow the arbitration process spelled out in the laws of your state 
or province.
Elements of the statement of work (SOW)
A SOW usually contains these elements:
 
✓ Scope: This element outlines the scope of work that your business out-
sources and specific service requirements, such as key roles required 
for your program and service-level agreements (refer to Chapter 2).
 
✓ Fees: These fees are associated with the services provided to you by 
your outsourcer. Certain services are included in your hourly rate, such 
as new-hire training, standard reporting, and management salaries. 
Extra fees include services defined in the scope of work, ad hoc training, 
custom reporting, and any technical work associated with changes or 
upgrades to computer systems.
 
 Many outsourcers are familiar with gain share/risk share programs, and 
a program of this type typically appears in the fee schedule. Gain share 
means that you give your outsourcer a bonus if it overachieves on your 
targets, and risk share means that you get some of the fee back if the out-
sourcer continually misses your targets.
 
✓ Specific procedures: These procedures are what you require your out-
sourcer to follow, such as quality testing, disaster recovery planning 
(what if the outsourcer’s site is no longer functional?), customer com-
plaint handling, and so on.

101
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Outsourcing Option
Negotiating the contract
Before you start a dialogue with your potential outsourcer, figure out what 
you need versus what you want to have. Make items such as privacy, confiden-
tiality, customer data, and some of your service standards non-negotiable. You 
can discuss and negotiate other items, such as specific performance targets, 
your gain share/risk share program (see the preceding section), the term of 
the contract, and the fee associated with services.
Reacting negatively to a request without finding out the motivation or need 
behind the request can only lead to further misunderstanding. You’re possi-
bly starting a long relationship, so try to start out on the right foot.
After you negotiate all the terms in the MSA and the SOW that would include 
a service-level agreement, you’re ready to sign the contract. You need to 
work with your new outsourcing partner to devise the transition plan for 
moving the calls to the outsourcer, as we discuss in the following section.
Planning the Transition
Set up your transition as you would any other project plan, ensuring that 
all activities are delegated to the right people. Integrate your outsourcer’s 
project plan into the overall plan. Hold regular meetings with the outsourcer, 
and when you’re about two weeks away from moving your calls to the out-
sourcer, meet daily to keep the project moving along.
 
When you’re planning the transition, consider the events taking place in your 
organization before you decide when to move calls over. If your company is 
launching a new initiative (such as a new bill design), absorbing an acquisi-
tion, or installing new technology, all these events will affect the transition 
because they increase call volume and customer interaction. You want to set 
your outsourcer up for success, so schedule the transition for a time during 
which you don’t expect to be unusually busy.
Elements of a typical transition plan
A typical transition plan addresses the following elements:
 
✓ Physical location of the call center and facilities, including the number 
of workstations
 
✓ All the technical components: computer systems (including knowledge 
base), telephone system, and so on
 
✓ Design of call routing and number of phone lines

102
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
 
✓ The number of unique groups of agents needed, as well as the number of 
agents needed in each unique group
 
✓ Recruitment and hiring plans for both agents and the leadership team 
based on the skills required
 
✓ Training strategy, design, and materials
 
✓ Mapping of key processes to ensure exceptional customer experience
 
✓ Performance metrics for agents, teams, and the overall program, includ-
ing a gain share/risk share program with respective reporting
 
✓ Customer feedback mechanisms
You want your outsourcer to seem like an extension of your own business — 
one that has particular call center expertise. Set goals and work closely with 
the outsourcer to ensure that it can (and does) achieve these goals. Clarity is 
vital — clarity of purpose, expectations, and communications . . . the works!
Roles and resources required
Identify the roles and skills that you need to lead this transition. If you don’t 
have these skills within your company, consider this option: Pick a function 
in your center, such as e-mail response to customers. Starting with a smaller 
volume allows you to cut your teeth on the first transition and apply what 
you find out to the next transition.
 
Consider taking a phased approach to outsourcing, starting with a just a few 
agents doing simple work. If this phase is a success, you can increase the 
volume or complexity of the work. By doing things this way, you reduce your 
risk by testing the outsourcer with a smaller part of your business.
Developing a Strong Relationship 
with Your Outsourcer
After you move the calls to the outsourcer, your job isn’t over. You need to 
assign a vendor manager who’s accountable for building a strong relation-
ship with the outsourcer to ensure that your business achieves its goals. 
In the following sections, we share some best practices about creating and 
growing a good relationship with your outsourcer.

103
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Outsourcing Option
 
If you don’t have trust within the relationship, you can’t sustain these prac-
tices; both parties must take part in them.
Setting expectations and creating 
operating guidelines
Setting expectations between two parties helps determine how to mesh per-
sonal working styles with what both parties need to accomplish. You have 
to be honest about what you want and what you commit to do for the other 
party. Establish how you want to work together and what’s important to you 
in a relationship.
Verifying the outsourcer’s understanding
In the words of business guru Stephen Covey, who has written several books 
about leadership and management, “Seek first to understand, then to be 
understood.” This guideline applies to both parties. It’s the basis of good 
communication, as it minimizes misunderstandings. Often, outsourcers com-
plete a requested task without understanding the business reason for that 
task and its effect on the business. Take the time to give your outsourcer 
the background and context for a request, making sure that the outsourcer 
understands what you want it to do (and how).
A great example of getting clarity involves a typical requirement for outsourc-
ers to complete quality evaluations. From a business point of view, you want 
assurance that the outsourcer’s agents are providing great service and taking 
care of your customers. It’s important that both you and your outsourcer 
clearly understand what a good customer experience sounds like, which you 
can do only by listening to taped or live calls and discussing them both from 
the customer’s perspective and from the business perspective. You should 
ask two questions during this activity:
 
✓ Did your customer leave with a positive feeling and confidence that his 
or her issue was resolved?
 
✓ Did you give the customer the required information accurately and 
ensure that all transactions were completed without error?
You can communicate clearly what your business expects from an out-
sourcer by listening to calls and having a good conversation about how the 
service that the outsourcer delivered matches the service you want to pro-
vide your customers.

104
Part I: From the Ground Up: An Overview of the Call Center 
Staying involved
Some companies feel that providing direction and stating expectations at the 
beginning of the relationship are all that they need to do. But when you work 
with an outsourcer, you need to stay connected through short daily meetings 
or weekly status updates so that you can understand the outsourcer’s chal-
lenges and help by removing roadblocks. This relationship is a true partner-
ship when you face the challenges together, and holding regular meetings 
helps you get to satisfactory solutions faster.
Another best practice is having regular quarterly performance reviews for 
your outsourcer. Just as employees do, the outsourcer needs to know what it 
has done well and what needs to improve or change.
 
We had a client who asked us for help with an outsourcer that wasn’t meeting 
the client’s revenue-per-call targets and that had high turnover. When we vis-
ited the outsourcer to see what was going on, we found out that no one from 
the client company had come to visit the call center, let alone provide direc-
tion about what products it should offer first or how to sell those products 
better. The outsourcer was doing the best it could with the little knowledge 
and understanding that it had. After we started a conversation between our 
client and its outsourcer, eyes started popping all over the place, and light 
bulbs went off. The agents changed their approach, and the client immediately 
realized the benefits. Revenue per call was no longer a challenge, and the 
client was happy with its outsourcer.
Take the time to talk
When Afshan was in telecommunications, she 
contracted an outsourcer that provided Internet 
technical support for her company’s customers. 
The contract required the outsourcer to provide 
a specific level of service, with a penalty to be 
levied if that service level wasn’t achieved. The 
contract didn’t specifically mention, however, 
how long low service would be allowed to con-
tinue before the penalty was levied.
After the contract was signed, Afshan and 
the outsourcer sat down and created a set of 
operating guidelines that made specific parts 
of the SOW clearer. Her first step was explain-
ing the effect of prolonged low service levels 
on the customer and her company, with the 
understanding that low service might occur on 
occasion for one or two days at most. She and 
the outsourcer agreed that if low service levels 
continued for five days in a row, the outsourcer 
would provide an analysis of why low service 
was occurring and a plan to rectify the problem.
Lo and behold, three months into the contract, 
the outsourcer struggled with low service 
levels for five days in a row. As it had agreed 
to do, the outsourcer came forward with a 
reasonable plan of action that left both parties 
confident that the situation was being rectified. 
Because Afshan had this conversation with the 
outsourcer at the beginning of the relationship, 
the outsourcer was able to meet her expecta-
tions — no mess and no fuss!

105
 Chapter 5: Choosing the Outsourcing Option
Knowing when to jump in
When things are going awry at your outsourcer, it’s difficult to stand back. 
You just want to take the reins and start fixing the problem. But you’ve given 
these reins to someone else who has the expertise to solve this issue. How 
long should you wait for things to improve, and what should you do if they 
don’t?
Don’t add more stress and pressure to the situation. Be part of the solution, 
not part of the problem. Your role could include being part of a brainstorm-
ing team that looks for solutions. Through collaboration and open discus-
sion, suggest options that work for you and your outsourcer. After all, you 
want to set all parties up for success.

most call center professionals. In this part of the book, we 
also explore everything from forecasting to schedule cre-
ation and workforce management automation. We

Chapter 6
Analyze This!
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the important roles of finance and analysis
▶ Knowing which business goals and performance drivers to concentrate on
▶ Setting and hitting appropriate targets
You may find the thought of call center analysis a little boring, and you 
might even feel a little pain at the idea, but trust us — it really isn’t that 
difficult, and it can make your call center more successful.
Call centers can be complex beasts, and they run very much by the numbers, 
so analysis plays a significant role in operating them effectively. Call centers 
can get very big, and although they offer a cost-effective way of doing busi-
ness, they can require a lot of dollars from the parent organization to make 
them go.
In this chapter, we discuss a simple approach to analyzing your business 
goals and setting targets to help you achieve them. Our approach aligns 
performance drivers (and the ways you measure them) with your business 
goals. We also talk about call center operating budgets and costs, methods of 
tracking satisfaction at both customer and employee level, and various ways 
to increase efficiency.
Adding It Up: Call Center Math
Most of the math that you use in call centers every day is simple. Sure, you 
can get really fancy, using sophisticated techniques such as multiple regres-
sion, but your super-keen business analyst will be only too happy to do the 
work and translate the results into English for you. (For a discussion of the 
roles of analysts in a call center, see Chapter 3.)

110
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Understanding the fundamental concepts
Most call center analysis involves basic concepts, such as the following:
 
✓ Percentages and cumulative percentages
 
✓ Averages and weighted averages
 
✓ Standard deviation
 
✓ Simple charts, such as bar charts and pie charts
 
✓ Charts that illustrate variation, such as control charts and run charts
We discuss these tools in greater detail wherever they come up throughout 
the book.
 
A detailed discussion of statistical analysis is beyond the scope of this book, 
but you can find more information and a definition of standard deviation in 
Statistics For Dummies, by Deborah Rumsey (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
After you establish your business goals (as we describe in Chapter 2) and 
know what you need to do to achieve them, you can use mathematical 
models to figure out what levels to aim for, or create and analyze what-if sce-
narios for costs per contact, cost per customer, call center budget, and other 
measures.
If you can model call center results by using the business and operating driv-
ers to create an economic model of your operation, you gain valuable insight 
into how your call center works.
Using models in calculations
You can calculate contacts per hour based on occupancy (how busy call 
center agents are while they’re logged into the company phone system) and 
average call length. Just use the following formula:
Contacts per hour = Occupancy × 3,600 ÷ Call length (in seconds)
In this formula, 3,600 represents the number of seconds in an hour. So if your 
call center’s occupancy is 75 percent (0.75), and the call length is 360 sec-
onds, your equation looks like this:
0.75 × 3,600 ÷ 360 = 7.5
The result is 7.5 contacts per hour.
You can see from this model that to increase contacts per hour, you simply 
have to reduce call length or increase occupancy.

111
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
 
We discuss call length and occupancy calculations in “Performance Drivers: 
Managing the Results,” later in this chapter.
Analyzing Business Goals
You generally group your call center’s business goals into four areas: cus-
tomer satisfaction, efficiency, revenue generation, and employee satisfaction. 
(Chapter 2 covers these areas in detail.)
You can target and measure the call center’s mission and business goals in 
various ways, as well as measure the performance drivers (see Chapter 2) 
that have a direct effect on your call center’s performance. Table 6-1 summa-
rizes the relationships among the four business goals and the performance 
drivers that affect results.

Measuring Business Goals
As we discuss in Chapter 2, business goals are the desired results of the call 
center — what the corporation needs from the call center by way of cus-
tomer satisfaction, efficiency, revenue generation, and employee satisfaction.
In the following sections, we outline some common ways to measure whether 
you’re meeting your call center business goals.
 
A note about employee satisfaction as a business goal: Some companies 
believe that it’s the obligation of a socially responsible employer to provide a 
quality work environment; others believe that maintaining high employee sat-
isfaction is good business practice. Few dispute the strong link between happy 
employees and the satisfaction level of customers with whom those employ-
ees interact.
Breaking down the operating budget
As with most departments or divisions of a business, you need to know your 
operating budget to complete your call center business planning effectively. 
The operating budget is the sum of the costs associated with running a call 
center for a given period — usually, a year. The message is fairly simple 
when it comes to budgets: Don’t exceed a budget, and if you can keep your 
expenses lower than the budget, that’s great.
You may not have an accounting degree, but you need to understand the 
financial aspects of managing customer contact. Some people inside your 
company might see the call center as a big cost pit, so you need to show 
them the value of the call center and explain your costs. If you’re talking to 
senior executives about your call center’s financial results or considering 
outsourcing (which we discuss in Chapter 5), you need to answer the ques-
tion “How much does it really cost to run our call center operations?”
When you have that figure, you can calculate your fully loaded cost per call, 
cost per minute, and cost to service an existing account or customer. Fully 
loaded means that you total your costs (labor, telephony, overhead, and so 
on) and divide it by the number of calls you take over one year.
 
You can calculate these costs over a few months, but things like depreciation, 
amortization, and rent usually are calculated annually. Alternatively, you can 
divide your total costs by the number of labor minutes or hours that your 
operation uses in the course of a year.

113
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
Budgets have their limits, however. Meeting or beating an operating budget 
doesn’t tell you whether your call center operated efficiently or your general 
business activity was lighter than planned. In a growing company, operating 
budgets for call centers generally go up, and an increasing budget doesn’t tell 
you much about whether you’re running the call center less efficiently than 
you did the year before.
Also, sticking strictly to an operating budget without using comparative 
data — such as percentage of revenue or comparison with last year’s 
results — can lead to the wrong business decisions. Most people probably 
would agree that if demand for your product greatly exceeds the demand 
that your call center budget planned for, and as a result, your call center is 
swamped with calls from people who want your product, you probably want 
to exceed your budget so that you can accommodate these purchasers.
Categorizing operating costs
We present a few categories that can help you organize your thinking and costs. 
(In Chapter 5, we talk about these costs in more detail.) These operating-cost 
categories are
 
✓ Direct payroll costs: Labor costs directly associated with handling cus-
tomer calls, e-mails, online chat, and so on. This category includes not 
only your agents’ hourly or salary wages, but also the additional costs of 
health benefits, taxes, vacations, and other payroll-related costs (which 
can add 10 percent to 20 percent to wages, depending on jurisdiction 
and company policies).
 
✓ Indirect payroll costs: Costs such as payroll for team leaders, managers, 
trainers, and people who fix computers, as well as at least part of the 
cost for groups such as human resources. You also need to add benefits, 
payroll taxes, vacations, and so on to these costs.
 
✓ Support and management costs: Costs related to supporting the depart-
ment, such as wages and benefits associated with senior management, 
reporting and analysis, meals, entertainment, food (what call center 
agent doesn’t like a free meal?), travel, and agent incentives. The person 
who manages the service center has direct control of all these costs.
 
✓ Corporate overhead costs: Costs that typically are beyond your day-to-
day control, including facilities (rent, utilities, maintenance, and prop-
erty taxes), insurance, security, software licenses, telecom maintenance, 
phone lines, and Internet access.
 
✓ Capital expenses: Costs of acquiring long-term physical assets such 
as land, buildings, or technology, which appear in this year’s oper-
ating budget as amortization and/or depreciation. Amortization or 
depreciation reflects the portion of the asset that was “used up” 
this year. How much you apply is regulated by accounting and tax rules.

114
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Many one-time purchases (such as technology) include ongoing costs. You 
group these costs as new operating costs (such as licenses and maintenance).
Your company might also look at costs as being fixed versus variable. A fixed 
cost doesn’t change when call or work volume decreases. Fixed costs typi-
cally include rent, insurance, and payroll costs such as managers and the 
information-technology staff. A variable cost does change with call volume. 
Typically, a call center’s variable costs include agent hourly wages (plus 
taxes, benefits, and vacations associated with these hourly wages).
If your call volumes fluctuate, but the number of paid agent hours doesn’t, 
your cost per call, cost per minute, or cost per customer measurement 
increases. You can solve this problem in several ways, including moving or 
reducing agent hours (moving some agents to part-time or casual hourly 
employment), or giving agents some other type of work to do instead of wait-
ing for calls to arrive.
The largest cost in the call center budget typically is labor. You base budgets 
on assumptions about the number of calls that the call center will receive, 
how long those calls will be, and how quickly agents need to answer the 
phone. You use these assumptions to determine how many agents, managers, 
and support people your call center needs. In Chapters 7 and 8, we discuss 
how to calculate the number of people you need to answer the phone.
Companies need operating budgets, and managing with the budget in mind 
can help a company achieve its goals. Very effective call center managers 
have a great deal of control of their costs and generally know how much they 
need to spend in any month long before the finance department produces a 
cost report.
Modeling the operating budget
Modeling the call center budget gives you the opportunity, through what-if 
scenarios, to see the real effect on the bottom line of changes in various driv-
ers. The following formula, which is a simplified version of the call center 
budget model, is an easy way to do a simple cost–benefit analysis:
Call center budget = Customer base × Forecasted calls per customer × 
Average call length ÷ Planned occupancy at service level × Cost per hour
Assume the following:
 
✓ Number of customers (customer base): 1 million
 
✓ Forecasted calls per customer (annual): 1
 
✓ Average call length: 360 seconds
 
✓ Planned occupancy at service level: 75 percent (0.75)
 
✓ Cost per hour: $45

115
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
In this scenario, your equation would look like this:
Call center budget = 1,000,000 × 1 × 360 ÷ 3,600 ÷ 0.75 × $45 = $6,000,000
If you could reduce call length by 30 seconds, your new calculation for the 
department budget would be
Call center budget = 1,000,000 × 1 × 330 ÷ 3,600 ÷ 0.75 × $45 = $5,500,000
In this example, reducing call length by 30 seconds translates into a $500,000 
savings. To reduce call length, management might make some significant 
changes in the call-handling process, introduce call-control training, or 
perhaps introduce some new software that streamlines the way that agents 
retrieve information. Doing a quick calculation of the effect of changing 
the call center’s drivers may motivate management to find ways to make 
improvements.
To figure out what occupancy levels you’ll have when you hit service-level 
targets, look at your results over time, and determine what occupancy level 
you typically hit when you’re at the service-level target. (For more informa-
tion on service level, see Chapter 2.) You can use this information as a bench-
mark, which you can improve on.
We talk more about occupancy later in this chapter, and we discuss forecast-
ing in Chapter 7. Also, knowing your optimal occupancy (see Chapter 8) can 
help maximize productivity without burning out your agents.
Measuring cost per contact
Measuring cost per contact tells you something about your call center’s cost 
control. If cost per contact is getting lower, your boss is probably happy.
This measure doesn’t tell the whole story, however. If your call center’s cost 
per contact is low because your agents are rushing off calls to keep their call 
length low, or if you have a very high percentage of repeat calls, cost per con-
tact can simply mask a problem.
Calculating contact costs
You calculate cost per contact by dividing the total cost of running the call 
center for a given period by the total contacts to which agents responded in 
the same period. Even with the concern about short calls and repeat calls, 
you want this measure to decrease over time.

116
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Figure 6-1 illustrates a run chart of cost per contact. A run chart is a line graph 
that shows data points plotted in the order in which they occur. Run charts 
illustrate trends, so you can identify possible causes if you see spikes or dips.
 
Figure 6-1: 
A run chart 
illustrating 
cost per 
contact.
 
Running with run charts
To create a run chart, simply chart any data 
point, such as how long each agent’s calls 
last over a given period, and voilà — instant 
analysis.
You can even illustrate control limits on a run 
chart when you track an agent’s performance, 
even though doing so isn’t common practice. 
Control limits are horizontal lines drawn on 
charts usually at a distance of plus or minus 
three standard deviations of the plotted statistic 
from the mean. When you include the control 
limits, you can much more easily compare 
an agent’s performance with the trend of the 
group and see exactly how much variation has 
occurred over time.
Although we don’t go into statistics in detail in 
this book, Statistics For Dummies, by Deborah 
Rumsey (Wiley), provides more information on 
common statistics terms and concepts.

117
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
Determining cost per contact
By using the formula for contacts per hour (which you can find in “Using 
models in calculations,” earlier in this chapter), you can easily calculate cost 
per contact if you know your cost per hour:
Cost per contact = Cost per hour ÷ Contacts per hour
If your cost per hour is $45, for example, and your contacts per hour are 7.5, 
your cost per contact is $6 ($45 ÷ 7.5). To reduce this cost per contact, you 
have to reduce your cost per hour (maybe by improving agent utilization, 
which we discuss in “Performance Drivers: Managing the Results,” later in 
this chapter) or increase calls per hour (perhaps by improving occupancy, 
which you can read about in “Occupancy,” later in this chapter).
Models provide a simple but effective way to create and experiment with 
what-if scenarios. You can use models to do very accurate cost–benefit analyses.
Measuring cost per customer
Cost per customer addresses the problems with cost per contact by eliminating 
the variable of call length as long as you have a finite customer base. Cost per 
customer tells you more than cost per contact does, because it takes repeat calls 
into account and doesn’t penalize an operation that smartly took simple shorter 
calls and moved them to a self-service interactive voice response system (IVR; see 
Chapter 9) or Web site. You calculate cost per customer by using this formula:
Cost per customer = Cost of running the call center for a certain period ÷ 
Average number of customers for the same period
If your cost per customer reduces continually, your overall call center costs 
keep going down — and you can bet that you’ll be talked about favorably in 
the executive lunchroom.
Measuring cost per resolution
Cost per resolution is a great way to measure progress toward your business 
goals. Cost per resolution recognizes that sometimes, agents can’t satisfy 
customer issues in a single contact. It also recognizes that customers some-
times call back because of new issues.
You may find cost per resolution difficult to calculate because you can’t always 
track unique issues accurately, but if you use customer relationship management 
(CRM) software, which tracks customer contacts and unique issues, you can at 
least get a close approximation. If you have that data, plug it into this formula:
Cost per resolution = Total costs for the period ÷ Cases resolved

118
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
You want to see your cost-per-resolution number decrease, showing improve-
ment over time.
Ringing up revenue
Revenue refers to the money that your business makes before it pays 
expenses and taxes. Profit (or earnings), on the other hand, refers to the 
money that you have left after you subtract from your revenue the expenses 
of producing, selling, and delivering a product or service.
Determining total revenue generation
Total revenue generation and the call center operating budget (which we talk 
about in “Breaking down the operating budget,” earlier in this chapter) coex-
ist in the annual planning process.
Your finance or marketing department calculates total revenue generated. It 
probably estimates the number of sales-inquiry calls that you’re going to get 
for the period, the percentage of these inquiries that your agents will convert 
to sales, and the average value of these sales.
 
You can always look at beating the revenue-generation target as being a good 
thing, but you don’t know how good it is until you put it into the context of how 
many customers contacted the call center. If customer calls exceeded your plan 
by 100 percent, and revenue generation exceeded the plan by only 50 percent, 
your agents didn’t generate as much revenue per customer as you had planned.
Calculating revenue per contact
Revenue per contact gives you a fairly good measure of how much revenue your 
call center agents are bringing in per contact — and the higher, the better.
You can calculate this value easily:
Revenue per contact = Total revenue generated by the call center for a 
given period ÷ Number of contacts for the same period
Revenue per contact offsets cost per contact. You can also include the effect of 
customer cancellations in the revenue-per-contact measure to arrive at net rev-
enue per contact. When you measure revenue per contact at the agent level, 
you see which agents best maximize all revenue opportunities, including sales 
and retention opportunities. Here’s the formula for these relationships:
Net revenue per contact = Total revenue generated by the call center for 
a given period ÷ Number of contacts for the same period – Revenue lost 
from cancellations

119
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
Include all calls when you’re calculating revenue per contact. Don’t make an 
attempt to qualify which calls to count (“Well, if you take out calls made to 
wrong numbers, my conversion rate goes way up!”). In the world of call cen-
ters, everyone gets the same percentage of misdirected or non-revenue-
opportunity calls. Qualifying which calls count and which ones don’t intro-
duces subjectivity, interpretation, and error into the measure. Use all calls — 
for absolutely everyone.
Calculating revenue per customer
Revenue per customer provides a nice comparison with cost per customer, 
giving your call center a good visible contribution to the organization on a 
per-customer basis. Here’s how you calculate this measure:
Revenue per customer = Total revenue generated for a given period ÷ 
Average number of customers over the same period
If you continually reduce cost per customer and increase revenue per cus-
tomer, you’ll have a key component of a successful performance evaluation.
Scoring satisfaction
We all want to be part of an organization that people not only enjoy working 
for, but also enjoy working with. To find out whether your customers and 
employees (whom you can consider to be internal customers) are satisfied, 
simply ask them by conducting satisfaction surveys. When you conduct these 
surveys, make sure that you have a clear idea of when and how you gather 
this information and what you ask your customers. To get true value out of 
the survey results, consider that the actions you take after you analyze this 
data can help you improve both employee and customer satisfaction.
Measuring customer satisfaction
Your call center needs to provide exceptional customer service, of course — 
and not just because your mother, the president of the United States, or the 
queen of England plans to call. Customer satisfaction drives future business.
At the very least, lack of customer satisfaction is a primary cause of loss of 
future business. You certainly don’t want the call center to be the reason why 
customers stop doing business with your company, so you need to deliver 
good customer service.
In some cases, call centers provide such great service that callers say, “Wow, 
thanks!” If you can impress customers in this way often enough that the call 
center actually increases the number of customers your company has, you 
and your team will have the satisfaction of a job really well done.

120
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Measuring employee satisfaction
Employee motivation is a complex topic, which we don’t dive into too deeply 
here. (For a full discussion, see Motivating Employees For Dummies, by Max 
Messmer [Wiley].) In Chapter 14, we talk about employee engagement. But 
just know that you need to give it a lot of attention, make it one of your busi-
ness goals, and try to improve it so that you have happier employees.
You can start measuring employee satisfaction by conducting regular 
employee surveys, maybe once per month and certainly no less than quar-
terly (see the sidebar “How often should you survey employees?” in this 
chapter). These surveys give you a continuous view of how employees view 
their jobs and the company.
Include a few consistent questions in the monthly survey, such as “Do you like 
working here?” and “Do you find your team leader to be helpful?” In addition to 
these standard questions, you can list a few questions-of-the-month to take a 
closer look at particular issues, such as new initiatives and program rollouts.
You may want to ask open-ended questions to determine what your employ-
ees think you could improve in your operation. After you have a good idea of 
what is and isn’t working, you can make changes.
 
In our call centers, we use a Web-based survey that we can edit and launch 
on a moment’s notice. The survey includes room for employees to write their 
recommendations and concerns. Participation is confidential, which helps 
foster open discussion. The application automatically tabulates results and 
produces trend data on overall satisfaction, as well as satisfaction relative to 
the individual questions.
As you do for other measures, you want a high level of employee satisfaction. 
You want to see improvement — graphs that go up. A bad score can, and 
should, be cause for concern and quick action.
How often should you survey employees?
You may hear that an annual or semiannual 
survey is more appropriate than a monthly or 
quarterly one. We can’t agree with this assess-
ment, however. You certainly wouldn’t measure 
cost-per-call performance semiannually, so why 
measure employee satisfaction any less often 
than you do your other business goals? Frequent 
measurement of employee satisfaction allows a 
call center to track not only progress, but also 
the effect of initiatives designed to improve 
employee satisfaction.
If you do surveys monthly, however, don’t prom-
ise that you’ll resolve every new issue quickly. 
Gauge employees’ attitudes frequently, but also 
manage their expectations about resolutions so 
that you don’t create employee cynicism.

121
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
Performance Drivers: 
Managing the Results
As we discuss in Chapter 2, performance drivers are variables that affect your 
call center’s business goals. They’re called performance drivers because, like 
the software programs that make computers work, they make other things 
go. In the case of call center employees, performance drivers are the behav-
iors and actions that improve business goals.
The models that we discuss in this chapter show that the measures you iden-
tify really do drive results, especially in the very measurable goals of cost 
and revenue. Understanding this relationship is just the beginning, however; 
you want to use that information to plan new business activities to improve 
the way you work.
A key component of controlling and manipulating outcomes is designating 
responsibility throughout the organization — especially to the call center’s 
agents, because each agent is a microcosm of the operation.
Keep your employees by keeping them happy
Here are some characteristics of happy 
employees:
 ✓ They value the work. Hire people who like 
the work and want to continue doing it. No 
job is for everyone, and if you hire someone 
because she needs some quick cash, you 
run the risk of having an employee whom 
you can’t motivate. We discuss recruiting 
in Chapter 12.
 ✓ They get the team-leader support that they 
need. One of the biggest turnoffs for employ-
ees of call centers (or any other business) is 
not being able to get help when they need it. 
A competent staff of team leaders contrib-
utes to employee satisfaction.
 ✓ They get recognition for doing a good job. 
If they do something truly good, employees 
want someone to notice it.
 ✓ They feel that the environment is positive. 
A positive environment can include a posi-
tive corporate culture, friendly coworkers, 
clean carpets, adequate lighting, and so on.
You can measure all these aspects of employee 
satisfaction in your opinion survey by asking 
employees to rate each element on a scale 
— say, from 1 to 5, with 1 being lowest and 5 
highest.

122
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Table 6-2 shows how to track and improve results at agent level. Individual 
agent improvement creates improvement in overall average agent perfor-
mance, which in turn drives overall improvement in the call center.

Application of knowledge
Some measures in Table 6-2 — the ones that agents can’t influence or con-
trol through their own actions — don’t correlate with agent-level measures 
because they’re not considered to be agents’ responsibilities. Occupancy and 
service level, for example, are group measures that individual agents can’t 
control. Also, agents can’t directly control company policies and procedures.
Formula for success
Statisticians might think of the relationship 
between business-goal measurements and 
performance drivers in these terms:
 ✓ y = business-goal measurements
 ✓ x = performance drivers
 ✓ y = f (x) (which means that y is a function 
of x)
Budgets are a function of call length, among 
other things.

123
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
In Table 6-2, cost per hour becomes wage rate at the agent level because 
apart from their wages (which correlate directly to them), agents generally 
can’t control any other costs.
You measure the call center driver called agent utilization as schedule adher-
ence at the agent level. Schedule adherence is the percentage of expected 
phone time that an agent is actually on the phone.
Use these driver calculations to help agents achieve continuous improve-
ment in the areas for which they’re responsible.
 
Wherever possible, break the drivers into the smallest unit of measure that 
you can. Break call length into talk time and after-call work, for example, and 
then try to break those measures down further, perhaps by contact type. 
Tracking these drivers at agent level is just another way of breaking down the 
data so that you can understand the driver better.
Hundreds of performance drivers probably affect a call center’s results. The 
business analyst (see Chapter 3) needs to identify these relationships to gain 
a better understanding of how performance drivers make business objectives 
work. In the following sections, we look at the variables that have the great-
est effect on call center results. Master these variables, and you can develop 
a great deal of control of performance and profitability.
Cost per agent hour
A call center manager needs to know the center’s cost per agent hour, which 
amounts to the total cost of operating the center for one hour during which 
an agent is logged into the telephone system. To calculate this value, use this 
equation:
Cost per agent hour = Total call center cost for a given period ÷ Total 
hours logged into the phone system for the same period
Track cost per agent hour over time because it fluctuates with call volume.
 
You can control this measure, and if you do, you gain a great deal of control of 
the cost-management goals in your call center.
After you calculate your cost per agent hour, you can analyze the result. 
Break the total cost per hour into agent labor, benefits, management, rent, 
and so on.

124
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Next, you may want to compare your cost-per-agent-hour figures with those 
of other organizations — a process called benchmarking. Benchmarking can 
give you a feel for whether your results are high or low (keeping in mind that 
the company you’re benchmarking against may be in a different industry or 
may not provide comparable services). Through benchmarking, you may 
find that you’re doing well, or you may find that you can improve. If you find 
other companies that run good operations and have a lower cost per agent 
hour, at least you know what’s possible.
 
You may want to benchmark with outsourcers, too; they know their cost per 
agent hour only too well and typically remove all inefficiencies. We discuss 
outsourcing in Chapter 5.
Cost per agent hour is influenced by variables such as average wage rate, 
benefits, and logged hours over paid hours (L/P). Here’s the equation for L/P:
L/P = Total logged hours by all call center agents ÷ Total payroll hours for 
the same period
Some operators use the term agent utilization for L/P. Whatever you call it, 
this ratio illustrates the overall productivity of your call center. We’ve seen it 
range from less than 50 percent to more than 80 percent.
 
In a large operation that Réal helped, a 1 percent increase in L/P reduced total call 
center expenditures by approximately $1 million, or about 2 percent of the total 
budget, so you may want to consider paying close attention to this measure.
To manage L/P, account for all the time that agents don’t spend on the 
phones — the difference between your L/P number and 100 percent. After 
you account for this time, you can probably find savings by reducing nonpro-
duction time in your operation — any time that agents aren’t talking to cus-
tomers or doing after-call work.
The cost associated with agent time represents 60 percent to 70 percent of 
the call center’s costs and can be broken into these categories:
 
✓ Total paid time: This category is subject to a markup percentage for 
health benefits and payroll costs that human resources or finance may 
not always share with managers of the call center.
 
✓ Nonproduction time: Some of this time may be paid (such as train-
ing and meetings), and some of it may be unpaid (such as breaks or 
lunches). Check with the payroll person to determine the time your 
company pays agents for and the time it doesn’t pay agents for. Even if 
the company doesn’t pay for a certain period of time, that nonproduc-
tion time still affects your operation; if an agent isn’t there to take a call, 
you have to pay someone else to replace her.
 
 Between total agents-paid time and agents-working time, a typical call 
center can lose anywhere from 7 percent to 12 percent, depending on 

125
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
its absence policy (paid versus unpaid) and on whether it has any new 
hires in training. (The call center has to pay for these new hires but 
doesn’t yet have them in the operation talking to customers.)
 
✓ Production time: This category represents the time when an agent is wait-
ing for a call (idle time), performing after-call work (finishing a customer’s 
file after hanging up with the customer), or talking to the customer.
 
✓ Talk time: Talk time is the most important part of production time. 
During this time, the agent is helping customers and producing revenue.
Payroll efficiency represents how well you turn total paid time into talk time, 
and this number gives you a good overall view of organizational efficiency. 
Unlike measures of quality, generation of revenue, or first-contact resolution 
(see “Contacts per customer,” later in this chapter), however, payroll effi-
ciency doesn’t tell you how effectively your call center delivers great service 
or generates revenue.
Call length
Call length is a major building block of a call center. Together with call 
volume and service level (how quickly an agent answers the phone), call 
length tells you how big to build your operation — how many people, how 
many desks, how large a phone system, how many phone lines, and so on.
Managing call length
Call centers often put too much focus on call length without paying appropri-
ate attention to other measures. Focusing too heavily on call length can make 
agents feel pressured to reduce call times, which can result in a reduction in 
the quality of customer service. Still, this measure can tell you much about 
your operation, as follows:
 
✓ Long calls: Our research has shown that customers want quick, accu-
rate, and complete resolution of their problems or inquiries. Long 
call times suggest that customers may not be getting what they want. 
Frequently, long calls are the result of complex problems.
 
✓ Short calls: Short call length may suggest that the agents don’t fully serve 
the customers. Usually, calls are short because they deal with simple 
problems, but sometimes, the call-handling process doesn’t allow agents 
to fully support customers. In these cases, you actually want call length to 
increase — along with customer satisfaction and call resolution.
 
Your efforts to improve call-handling processes and reduce call length not 
only save the call center money, but also satisfy customers by providing faster 
access to an agent. You can achieve high satisfaction with low call lengths 
only if you can equal or improve service and call resolution.

126
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Calculating call length
Most companies use this standard equation to calculate call length (see 
Chapter 7):
Talk time + After-call work = Call length
These companies, however, may be missing other times that have been 
recorded by the phone system, such as holds or transfers. Therefore, this 
call calculation may be understated.
The following formula, which Réal has used for years, produces a consistent 
measure of call length, or call service time (CST). You can use this measure 
for analysis and scheduling:
Call service time = (Total time agents are logged into the phones – Time 
agents spend waiting for calls) ÷ Number of calls answered
You may find that your CST is slightly different from average handle time 
(AHT) — the total time (measured in minutes or seconds) that agents spend 
on the phone over a given period — that your phone system reports because 
of the different ways that phone systems calculate AHT.
Charting call length
Bar charts (or histograms) can help you see how one thing compares with 
another or how frequently something occurs. In your call center, you can 
chart calls received by day of the week or types of calls received by day.
Figure 6-2 shows the average call length for different types of calls plotted on 
a bar chart.
To use this type of chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Track your call times by the different types of calls you take, and 
create a bar chart of that data.
 
2. Determine the longest call type.
 
3. Map out the step-by-step process for a typical call of that type.
 
4. Try to determine a different way to handle this type of call that 
doesn’t take as long.
 
5. Continue to track the length of this call type for 30 days.
 
 Ideally, you’ll see some improvements.
 
6. Repeat Steps 1–5 for each call type.
 
 Over time, you should increase cost control and customer satisfaction.

Contacts per customer
Contacts per customer is a measure that can help you forecast and track 
cost control. Tracking the number of contacts per customer on a monthly or 
daily basis and then multiplying that figure by the current number of custom-
ers gives you a forecast of call volume demand (specifically, the demand for 
agents’ time).
Reducing contacts per customer can help you gain efficiency and create high 
customer satisfaction. The more times a customer calls, the more total calls 
you have to take and the more agents you need to schedule to handle the calls. 
If customers call back because they’re irate about errors or problems with 
their transactions or orders, you have to take a double whammy: Handling a 
second call costs you money, and so does correcting the error. Reducing or 
eliminating errors and unnecessary callbacks plays a major role when you’re 
striving for improvements in customer satisfaction and efficiency.
For this reason, you need to measure first-call resolution (FCR), which refers 
to the percentage of customer inquiries that your agents can complete on the 
first attempt. If customers have to call back once — or many more times — 
because the call center didn’t resolve their inquiries or concerns the first time, 
your FCR percentage declines.

128
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
You may have difficulty tracking this driver because the call center must 
keep track of all callers, as well as their reasons for calling. Customer track-
ing software can make tracking FCR easier, however. (For more information 
on this software, see Chapter 10.)
You can get big benefits from tracking FCR. Improving this measure affects 
customer satisfaction because customers want quick, accurate resolutions of 
their problems and needs. It also improves efficiency because it reduces calls 
per customer and repeat calls.
Occupancy
Occupancy refers to how busy call center agents are while they’re logged into 
the company phone system. Occupancy has a great effect on efficiency.
You calculate occupancy as the percentage of call center agents’ logged 
hours — the time agents are logged into the telephone system, busy, and 
unavailable to accept customer calls — against the total hours that the 
agents spend at work (being paid). The formula looks like this:
Occupancy = Logged hours ÷ Total time spent at work
Occupancy is the opposite of idle time — time that agents spend waiting for 
customer calls.
What are logged hours?
Everyone in the call center must fully under-
stand and agree with what it means to 
be logged into the phone system. Agents 
are logged in whenever they’re handling 
customer calls, including all work associated 
with handling calls: talking to the customer, 
placing the customer on hold while the agent 
looks up the solution, doing after-call work, or 
waiting for the next call.
When agents are at work but not handling cus-
tomer calls, they shouldn’t be logged into the 
phone system. Agents should log out for breaks, 
meetings, training, and so on.
Reserving telephone logged hours exclusively 
for time spent handling customer calls makes 
it much easier to keep the data associated with 
call handling clean. Some call center manag-
ers might disagree, arguing that the phone 
system can track many uses of agent time. 
We’ve invariably found, however, that when 
agents stay logged into the phones for non-call-
handling reasons, it becomes unclear what 
time they used for call handling and what time 
they used for breaks. You can find other ways to 
track total agent time. Keep logged hours pure.
It’s worth noting that if agents are going to 
remain logged in, auxiliary (AUX) codes in the 
phone system and/or shift segments in the 
workforce planning software should identify 
production versus nonproduction time, provid-
ing a more complete picture of the day.

129
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
You can consider agents who are doing certain activities to be occupied. 
These activities include talking to customers, researching customer issues 
while the customer is on hold, and working on customer files after the cus-
tomer has hung up. This final occupied state is referred to as after-call work, 
and a button pushed at the agent’s phone tells the system that the agent is 
temporarily unavailable to accept calls.
Here are a couple of notes regarding occupancy:
 
✓ How fast agents answer the phone: When occupancy decreases, agents 
can answer customers’ calls more quickly (because a lot of agents are 
waiting for those calls). But if occupancy increases, agents answer the 
phones more slowly, and customers have to wait for “the next available 
agent.”
 
✓ The size of your call center: You want consistent occupancy through-
out the day, meaning that your agents receive a steady but comfortable 
pace of calls during the whole day. In this ideal situation, you optimize 
the use of your agents, and your agents aren’t stressed because they 
don’t receive a ton of calls at the same time.
 
 Because of economies of scale, the larger the call center, the higher the 
occupancy at any service level should be. So if you have agents waiting 
in different queues to take different calls, by consolidating call queues 
(in which customers wait until their turn to speak to an agent) or entire 
centers, you create a steady level of work and a more sustainable occu-
pancy level.
The effect of random call arrival
Unless your call center gets swamped with calls, you’ll never have 100 per-
cent occupancy. Call centers often experience occupancy of 65 percent to 
75 percent because of the random nature of call arrivals. To put it simply, 
customer calls come in bunches.
As we discuss in great detail in Chapter 8, the call-arrival pattern in a typi-
cal call center is random (and looks spiky if you graph the calls over time). 
Imagine that you work in a chocolate factory: The spikes represent choco-
lates coming off a conveyor belt, and you have to wrap each chocolate indi-
vidually. If you’re working alone, you probably miss many of the chocolates, 
especially during the spikes in chocolate arrival. If you absolutely can’t miss 
any chocolates, you ask a few friends to help you catch and wrap all the 
chocolates. Now you and your friends don’t miss any chocolates, but for the 
most part, you’re not very busy. In fact, it’s very slow on the chocolate-
wrapping line during the valleys in chocolate arrival.
Call centers experience the same kind of situation. If you have too few agents 
answering phones, you miss calls, but if you add people so that you don’t 
miss calls, your agents spend time waiting.

130
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Because of the variation in call-arrival patterns, you can’t just staff the 
phones for any given period based on the average number of calls; the peaks 
will kill you, just like in the chocolate-factory example. To answer all calls 
reasonably quickly during the peaks in caller demand, you must staff higher 
than the average number of calls.
The difference between the workload represented in the calls you receive 
and the actual amount of staff used to answer those calls represents time 
that your call center agents spend waiting (idle).
If you want to answer customer calls quickly, you need some agent idle time. 
Conversely, if you want to make your call center agents more productive 
(increasing occupancy), you need to staff fewer agents, reducing idle time 
and making your customers wait for an agent.
As we discuss in Chapter 8, optimal occupancy (what you can achieve with 
perfect scheduling) and expected occupancy (what you get from the imperfect 
schedules that you have to work with) differ. Getting as close as possible to 
optimal occupancy is a goal of every scheduler. You can achieve that goal by 
creating more flexible schedules with shorter shifts and by using part-timers 
and home agents (see Chapter 11). In large call centers, even a 1 percent 
improvement can add up to significant savings.
Occupancy as a driver of cost
How does occupancy affect your cost objectives? For any given caller 
demand, you can easily determine how much work the demand represents. 
If you’re going to get 10 calls in a half hour, and each call takes an average 
of 3 minutes to handle, some quick math tells you that you have 30 minutes 
of work to do. In half an hour, you need one agent to answer those calls, but 
that agent becomes 100 percent occupied for the half hour. If calls arrive ran-
domly — and you know that they will — some callers won’t get an immediate 
answer. If you need to answer calls quickly, you have to add another agent. 
The second agent can help you make sure that calls get answered quickly, 
but because these two agents have only 30 minutes of work, your occupancy 
falls from 100 percent to 50 percent, and the cost of answering these calls has 
doubled.
You have to consider optimizing occupancy when you plan a call center, and 
you need to manage it hourly to help manage costs and productivity.
Conversion per contact
A contact is any occasion when you communicate with a customer (via the 
phone, e-mail, chat, or whatever). A conversion is any occasion when you 
generate or save revenue during a contact.

131
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
When it comes to conversion, higher is better. Period. Full stop. Even if the 
customer just called to ask you what time the store in Upper Rubber Boot is 
open, if you manage to sell him something when he calls, you help build rev-
enue for the company.
In most call centers, the revenue opportunity associated with improving con-
version per contact is big. Managers and sales coaches spend a lot of time 
in call centers finding ways to improve this variable. Conversion per contact 
affects total revenue generated and other revenue goals.
Dollar value per conversion
Sure, you can make a lot of sales, given the universe of opportunities, but 
you want to make a lot of big sales. The terms upsell (which means selling the 
customer more than she initially planned to buy) and cross-sell (which means 
moving the customer to a new product line that he didn’t think about before) 
are the skills that agents need to achieve this goal. If you can make big sales 
or create cross-sells, this variable increases, which adds to total revenue gen-
erated, revenue per customer, revenue per call, and so on.
Accessibility
We use the term accessibility to describe how easily callers can get through 
to an agent — how fast someone answers the phone. Accessibility affects 
both customer satisfaction and efficiency.
A well-selected accessibility target can balance customer satisfaction with 
the cost of providing that level of accessibility. Accessibility affects cost by 
influencing how many agents the call center needs for any particular level of 
demand. As a result, accessibility influences cost through occupancy.
Here are three common measures (among many) that you can use to calcu-
late accessibility:
 
✓ Service level: Service level is probably the most common term used to 
define accessibility. It refers to the percentage of callers whose calls are 
answered or who hang up within a defined time. If your time threshold is 
20 seconds, you may have a service-level objective of answering 85 per-
cent of calls arriving in the call center in 20 seconds or less.
 
 Just to keep you on your toes, service level is also sometimes referred 
to as telephone service factor. Also, the target number of seconds — 20, 
in the preceding example — is referred to as the telephone service factor 
threshold. Oh, boy.

132
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
 
 Service level gives you a very specific measure, which you can use to 
make decisions about the cost and benefit of service-level objectives. 
We discuss this topic in more detail in Chapter 2.
 
✓ Average speed of answer: This term refers to the average amount 
of time that your customers wait before they can speak to an agent. 
Generally speaking, a lower figure is better.
 
✓ Abandonment rate: This measure is the percentage of callers who hang 
up before an agent answers their calls. This percentage, rather than a 
service-level measure, is more a measure of customer satisfaction. If 
your customers are hanging up a lot, guess what? They don’t like the 
speed of your service. If they don’t hang up very often, you likely offer 
them an acceptable average speed of answer (see the preceding 
paragraph).
 
 Be careful with this guideline, however. If customers don’t hang up 
simply because they absolutely must speak with someone, making them 
hold through a long delay can result in some nasty exchanges between 
frustrated customers and overworked agents.
Agent professionalism and ability
Whether they’re phoning a call center or shopping for shoes, most customers 
expect the same things of the customer service people whom they deal with: 
They should know what they’re talking about, and they should be nice.
The customer-satisfaction measures that we discuss in this section can help 
you find out how capable your agents are. Customers will tell you about 
agents who aren’t nice or can’t do the job. When you ask the right questions, 
customers can also tell you specifically what your company needs to do to 
improve. This information can make for excellent training material.
Many call centers have people listen to agent calls to determine whether 
their agents are professional and capable; this process is frequently referred 
to as call assessment or call monitoring. Quality analysts or team leaders often 
perform this role. When listening to agent calls, they score those calls against 
a template of key call behaviors. We discuss this role in Chapter 3.
In measuring customer satisfaction, many call centers rely on two methods:
 
✓ Team-leader or quality-assurance-team assessments of agent calls
 
✓ Customer-satisfaction surveys
We discuss both methods in the following sections.

133
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
Assessments of agent calls
You’ve probably heard the recorded message “This call may be monitored 
for quality purposes.” That recording refers to this process.
This type of assessment (or call monitoring) involves a couple of challenges:
 
✓ Volume: Team leaders can’t possibly assess enough calls to get an accu-
rate view of call quality. In most operations, team leaders may listen to 
only three to five calls for each agent every month.
 
✓ Subjectivity: Even if team leaders could listen to enough calls, their 
assessments of the quality of these calls usually are based on subjec-
tive ideas of what makes a good call. You can’t easily get two managers 
to agree on these criteria. Only the customers know whether they were 
happy with their call experiences.
 
 Many large companies have a team dedicated to quality-assurance moni-
toring to ensure that the calls are heard and that the scoring process is 
followed uniformly.
Customer-satisfaction surveys
Many companies conduct these surveys annually, but more sophisticated 
companies conduct them quarterly or even monthly (using different custom-
ers each month). Standard questions include evaluating speed of answer, 
agent knowledge, agent style and attitude, and possibly loyalty measures 
such as these:
 
✓ Will you continue to buy from us?
 
✓ Will you buy additional products or services?
 
✓ Will you recommend us to others?
Call monitoring and scoring can help agents meet and correct basic service 
standards (such as using the proper greeting or delivering the company’s pri-
vacy statement), but you really need to survey customers first to determine 
what’s important to them. Saying the customer’s name three times, as some 
quality-assurance score sheets require, may not be as important as giving 
the customer a quick, courteous answer and allowing her to get off the phone 
and get on with her life. The customer rules. Long live the customer!
Company and call center 
policies and procedures
The drivers discussed in this chapter aren’t the only ones that influence your 
operation. A large part of your business analyst’s job involves figuring out 
how to identify and manipulate all the drivers of call center performance.

134
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Your management team can control and improve performance drivers 
throughout the operation and improve agents’ ability to apply their skills 
and knowledge. Create detailed documentation of company policies and pro-
cedures — right down to how processes work. If you have well-documented 
processes, when you want to review a process, you don’t have to spend a 
lot of time researching it. In fact, the act of documenting a work process can 
help improve everyone’s understanding of how to do it. While you lay out a 
work process on paper (or in a word processor file), you or others may look 
at it and say, “Wow, that doesn’t make any sense!” Then you can change the 
process for the better. You can find a lot more about process management in 
Chapter 15.
Also, have a strong coaching culture (see Chapter 13) to help both new hires 
and existing agents achieve the skills they need to create a memorable cus-
tomer experience. Your agents must be able to coordinate all the tasks they 
have to perform and what they need to say, making the interaction feel like 
a natural conversation with the customer. The customer should feel that the 
experience both met his needs and provided other options that he hadn’t 
even thought about. Coaching has been shown to be the best strategy for 
achieving this goal.
Setting Performance Targets
People work better when they have specific performance targets. 
Unfortunately, many call center operations generally set unrealistic perfor-
mance targets (or none at all), probably because it’s not easy to set them 
effectively. You can easily say, “Tomorrow, I want you to answer 25 calls and 
make all the customers happy,” but knowing whether those targets can be 
achieved effectively is another matter.
First, you have to figure out the right thing to target; then you have to deter-
mine what level of performance to expect for that target.
If you set a target that’s too low, your operation underachieves. If you set a 
target that’s too high, you frustrate the people in your operation.
Targets for accessibility/service level
Sorting out this mess and selecting the perfect performance targets can be 
difficult. The following sections give you methods that you can use to set per-
formance targets specifically for service level.

135
 Chapter 6: Analyze This!
Do what everyone else does
The default level of service for answering phone calls tends to be 80/20 — 
which means that 80 percent of calls are answered or hung up in 20 seconds 
or less. In most operations, this service level results in a relatively short aver-
age wait time for customers (8 to 18 seconds), and most customers hang in 
there for that long.
Although 80/20 is good enough for many operations, the wait time on the 
other side of the 80 in 80/20 (meaning the 20 percent of people who wait 
more than 20 seconds) can be a long time — one or two minutes, or even 
longer. A person who’s calling to claim her lottery winnings probably 
wouldn’t mind, but the guy who calls because his television set stopped 
working three minutes before the big game probably wouldn’t be satisfied.
Go with your industry’s direction
Several industries are self-regulated, or even government-regulated, in terms 
of how fast call centers must answer the phone. Utilities such as electricity 
providers come to mind; many have penalties for long answer times. The gov-
ernment regulates these companies’ service levels so that consumers can get 
access to these essential services.
Develop a business case
Do a cost–benefit analysis to determine your service-level goal. Work out 
the cost of providing faster service through a broad range of service levels: 
50/20, 60/20, 70/20, 80/20, 85/20, 90/20 . . . you get the idea.
Next, work out the benefits of providing faster service:
 
✓ More customers get through to your call center (meaning that they don’t 
hang up and call the competition).
 
✓ When customers do get through, they aren’t grumpy from long waits.
 
✓ Your agents aren’t fraying at the edges from taking one call after 
another for eight hours (so they don’t call in sick or take extra breathers 
between calls).
 
✓ You aren’t paying additional toll-free (800-line) costs for your customers 
to listen to a repeating loop of elevator music.
 
Beyond an optimal point, providing faster service doesn’t lead to higher cus-
tomer satisfaction or more revenue. Work with your business analyst to deter-
mine what your optimal point is, and don’t spend more than you need to.
In Table 6-3, we illustrate a simple analysis that you can use to determine 
your ideal service level.

Here’s an explanation of the information in the table, column by column:
 
✓ Staffing cost: To increase service level, you need more agents on the 
phone, so staffing costs rise.
 
✓ Abandonment rate: This measure decreases when you have increased 
service level because customers don’t hang up due to a long delay.
 
✓ Lost revenue: Fewer lost customers mean less lost revenue.
 
✓ 800-line-delay cost: Because agents are answering calls more quickly, 
customer wait time decreases, so your toll-free telephone costs 
decrease.
 
✓ Incremental benefit: This measure combines the incremental lost rev-
enue and incremental 800-line-delay costs that you avoid.
 
✓ Incremental cost: This measure represents the staffing cost associated 
with raising your service-level objective.
The first two rows of figures in Table 6-3, for example, represent a change of 
your service-level objective from 50/20 to 60/20:
 
✓ Staffing costs go from $200,000 to $220,000, for an incremental cost of 
$20,000.
 
✓ Lost revenue (because customers abandoned calls) goes from $180,000 
to $120,000, for an incremental benefit of $60,000, and the 800-line-delay 
costs decrease from $2,100 to $1,733, for an incremental benefit of $367. 
Totaling these benefits gives you a total incremental benefit of $60,367.
Analysis, then, involves finding that sweet spot where the incremental benefit 
starts to exceed the incremental cost.

Targets for call length
Call center mystics, gurus, and shamans have posed this question for eons: 
“What’s the correct benchmark for average call length?”
Honestly, we don’t know. You can’t know! Way too many variables, all of 
which are changing all the time, go into determining call length. Here are a 
few to consider:
 
✓ Product complexity
 
✓ System capabilities
 
✓ Responsiveness
 
✓ Availability
 
✓ Working environment
 
✓ Temperature
 
✓ Noise level
 
✓ Training
 
✓ Competitive environment
 
✓ Policies and procedures
 
✓ Work distractions
All these variables, and many more, affect call length. Add the individual 
difference that each of your call center agents brings to the situation, and 
you have a very complicated process. Identifying the one right call length is 
nearly impossible.
 
What you can — and should — do is try to understand as much as possible 
about your own call center’s call lengths (or, more accurately, the call lengths 
for each of the call center’s campaigns). You should also attempt to make call 
length as consistent as possible.
Tracking variations
Consider what would happen if your call center produced exactly the same 
call length day after day, and every agent produced the same call length as 
the others day after day. Then you could be fairly certain that the call length 
produced was the product of your defined work processes. You’d be cer-
tain that all agents were following the same processes day in and day out. 
Then you could experiment with making changes in the work processes and 
measure the effect of those changes on the resulting call length. This experi-

138
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
mentation could give you a great deal of control of call length, which would 
greatly simplify the task of making improvements.
Unfortunately, your call center and its employees can’t behave that consis-
tently. Most call centers see a great deal of variation in call length from one 
agent to another. Day after day — often, even hour after hour — your call 
center produces very different call lengths, making planning and process 
improvements difficult.
Using variation analysis
To find the outliers (or underperforming agents), follow these steps:
 
1. Plot whatever you want to analyze (usually, one of the drivers) on a 
control chart.
 
 A control chart is a specific kind of run chart that allows you to differenti-
ate significant change from the natural variability of the process.
 
 Figure 6-3 shows a control chart of average handle time.
 
2. Identify those agents who are out of band — the ones who are above 
the top acceptable limit or below the bottom acceptable limit.
 
 Make this determination by choosing a percentage of variance above 
and below your group average.
 
3. Target those agents for coaching and follow-up.
To perform your actual analysis of what behaviors or skill gaps are causing 
the variances, follow these steps:
 
1. Look for differences.
 
 What causes these agents to be statistical anomalies for this driver 
(metric)?
 
2. Act on the differences.
 
 You have the following options:
 
• If the differences are better than the average, use them to inspire 
other members of the team to perform the same way.
 
• If the differences are worse than the average, work with the indi-
vidual agents to correct skill or behavior gaps.
 
 The overall goals of this analysis are to reduce variation and increase 
your understanding of what creates performance variance.
Note: Use this approach with all agent metrics, including FCR and conversion 
rate — not just call length.

For planning purposes, such as scheduling resources or creating your 
budget, simply use your call center’s historical average call length. In 
Chapter 7, we provide details on how to do long-range workforce planning.
To increase consistency and to help your call center reach its performance 
targets, use a process of variation analysis, performance diagnostics, and 
corrective measures to identify exceptions in overall operation performance 
and individual agent performance.
 
If you feel that your call center needs a specific target for call length, try using 
the top or bottom acceptable level. If your target for call length is 300 seconds, 
for example, and you choose a margin of 10 seconds because most agents 
(say, for example, 84 percent) achieve this target, your acceptable top limit for 
call length will be 310 seconds. For some metrics, you may use a lower accept-
able limit. An example is sales conversion — the number of calls on which an 
agent make a sales attempt and closes the sale. If your agents close sales on 
three out of ten calls, your conversion rate is 30 percent. If you allow a margin 
of 5 percent for conversion, you have a bottom control limit of 25 percent for 
conversion. Make sure that you’ve established these limits over a reasonably 
long period — say, 90 days. Incremental improvements in performance can 
help you reach your targets.

140
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
If something of consequence changes in your call center and affects call 
length, the control limits change, and so should the targets — the top and 
bottom acceptable levels of performance that most people achieve. Many 
people who don’t achieve the bottom limit fall just below it. Because the top 
or bottom limit is based on performance that the staff actually achieves, it 
gives you a reasonable minimum target. Through coaching (see Chapter 13), 
you can motivate agents who are just shy of the bottom limit to improve their 
performance to at least the minimum standard.
Operationally, track the daily average call length on a run chart (see the side-
bar “Running with run charts,” earlier in this chapter), along with the top and 
bottom limits at plus and minus one standard deviation, as Figure 6-4 illus-
trates. You want to control the metric, so dive into the exceptions — where 
the metric is exceptionally high or low, or where variation is greatest — to 
see what happened and why.
 
For more information about this type of calculation, see Statistics For Dummies, 
by Deborah Rumsey (Wiley).

If you notice that during a particular week, call lengths increased significantly 
compared with previous weeks, you can look for the reason behind that 
increase. Maybe you had a bunch of new hires on the phones that week, the

computer systems were slow, or you had a complicated billing problem that 
affected a lot of customers.
Whatever the case, this analysis can help you understand and quantify the 
effects of events, and you may be able to use the analysis to justify changing 
the way your company works.
Targets for occupancy
Occupancy can be a tough performance measure to get a handle on, but 
you need to consider it because it’s a key contributor to your productivity 
and costs. Much debate exists among call center professionals about how 
to target and manage occupancy. Some people incorrectly believe that you 
simply need a good service-level target and that by achieving your service-
level target, you maximize opportunity. If you have a well-thought-out 
service-level target — which includes a solid cost–benefit analysis — you 
can run your operation effectively and efficiently by achieving a consistent 
service level as close to the goal as possible.
When your actual service level is too far above the target, it costs you too 
much in labor; if it’s too far below the target, it costs you customer satisfac-
tion, revenue, and more. You achieve cost control when service level is right 
on target.
You want to maximize the occupancy that you achieve while reaching your 
target service level. You can reach this goal primarily through better schedul-
ing. The more closely you can match the number of agents scheduled to the 
actual call load requirements, the fewer periods of understaffing or overstaff-
ing you experience.
Figure 6-5 and Figure 6-6 illustrate two ways — one bad and one good — to 
achieve an 80/20 service level.
Note: For ease of charting, we show time based on a 24-hour clock.
In the scenarios illustrated in these charts, at the end of the day, the call 
center has achieved the target service level of 80/20 (80 percent of calls 
answered or abandoned in 20 seconds or less):
 
✓ Ineffective: In Figure 6-5, the call center achieved a very high service 
level (approaching 100 percent) for 80 percent of the day, but it had a 
dreadful service level for the remainder of the day. In this case, occu-
pancy would be very low for that first 80 percent of the day because the 
call center was way overstaffed during that time.

✓ Effective: In Figure 6-6, on the other hand, the call center met the service-
level target by having an appropriate number of agents on the phones 
throughout the day, thereby maintaining much higher occupancy.

f you’re in the resource or scheduling department, you have to ensure 
that your call center has the right people, tools, and equipment in the 
right places and at the right times to support the service, revenue, and effi-
ciency objectives of the call center, as directed by senior management. A 
basic understanding of simple math can help you get the job done, but with 
the additional knowledge of just a few key concepts and processes, you can 
become a call center resource management genius.
Understanding Resource Management 
Tasks and Concepts
The following sections provide an overview of the key concepts and tools 
used in call center resource management and their importance to scheduling.
Forecasting
Similar to forecasting the weather (but, we hope, more accurate), forecasting 
in call centers refers to predicting the future — specifically, how much work 
your center is going to have.

144
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
The key is determining your workload accurately so that you can match avail-
able resources to demand. You also have to forecast how much of different 
types of work you’ll get and how long the work will take to do (because differ-
ent types of work take different amounts of time).
 
Don’t assume that processing calls (or e-mails) always takes the same amount 
of time. A very simple customer inquiry is likely to take much less time to 
process, on average, than a complicated, high-level technical support call. 
Contact length fluctuates over time, as does call volume.
Scheduling
Scheduling is the process of assigning resources to meet your demand. 
Whereas forecasting provides the “how much” of resource management, 
scheduling provides the who, what, where, and when. We talk about schedul-
ing in Chapter 8.
Full-time equivalent
Full-time equivalent (FTE) refers to the amount of time that one full-time 
employee works in one day. You express staffing requirements in terms of 
the number of people working full-time hours. In Réal’s company, in one day, 
one FTE equals 7.5 paid hours. (Your company may have a slightly different 
FTE, such as 7 or 8.) Using Réal’s company as an example, if call demand 
required 750 total paid hours to get the work done for a day, that demand 
would equate to 100 FTEs (750 ÷ 7.5).
 
Because not all your agents work full time, you usually need more actual staff 
members scheduled than the number of FTEs you plan for.
Real-time management of resources
As the name suggests, real-time resource management refers to the process 
of managing call center resources immediately. We provide a more detailed 
explanation in Chapter 8. In essence, this term refers to making the neces-
sary ongoing changes in your original schedule (based on real-life, up-to-the-
minute changes in call volume and staff availability) so that your call center 
achieves the best possible results each day.

145
 Chapter 7: Right People, Right Place, Right Time: Resource Management
Forecasting: Timing Is Everything
Resource management is a lot easier than people make it out to be. The math is 
straightforward, and you can do projections for items such as department bud-
gets and staffing requirements without using complicated scheduling systems.
 
Determining how many resources your call center needs depends a great 
deal on the time frame in question. When it comes to forecasting, this task is 
done continually. Start with an annual forecast and then hone it on a quarterly 
basis, incorporating changes in the quarterly forecasted call volume. These 
changes may increase or decrease your call volume. An increase in calls may 
be due to a new promotion, and a decrease could occur because of a delay in 
communicating a promotion.
Long term: Setting budget 
and capital projections
Do long-term planning for requirements that expand beyond three months, 
up to a couple of years. In this phase, you forecast the demand on your call 
center and project the overall resources that you’ll require: how many people 
and desks you’ll need, how large the phone system has to be, how much data 
access you’ll require, and so on.
You use this forecasted information to develop operating budgets (how much 
money you need to spend to run the call center) and capital budgets (how 
much money you need to spend to build the call center).
Midterm: Creating the schedules
In the long-term projection, you determine how many people and desks you 
need; the midterm scheduling projection tells you when you need to use 
those people and equipment.
Try to create a schedule over a period that ranges from three months to one 
year — however long you think your schedules can reliably last. Some opera-
tions have schedules that last a few weeks at most, but others can keep a 
schedule together for a year or more.

146
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
During the midterm scheduling phase, you attach names to schedules so that 
you know (generally) who’s going to work when.
Short term: Making adjustments
From the time you plan a schedule to the actual day of handling the calls, 
changes can occur. You often have to deal with changes in caller demand 
and changes in the availability of staffing. In short-term projections, which 
you generally do approximately one week out, you adjust your schedules to 
accommodate any recent changes in demand or staffing availability.
Tracking forecast accuracy
 
You can easily track forecast accuracy by using what we call absolute forecast 
variance. The word absolute means that the result contains no negative num-
bers. When you calculate how inaccurate your forecast was, you always 
express the error in positive numbers because over time, tracking both posi-
tive and negative errors results in one canceling the other out, making your 
overall forecast appear to be more accurate than it really is.
Tracking variance with positive and negative numbers
If you’re using positive and negative numbers to track how accurate your 
forecasts are, your forecast variance uses this formula (always making the 
result a positive number):
Variance = Actual calls – Forecasted calls
Suppose that you have these values for Day 1:
 
✓ Forecast: 10,000 calls
 
✓ Actual: 20,000 calls
 
✓ Variance: 10,000 calls (20,000 – 10,000)
Day 2 has these values:
 
✓ Forecast: 20,000 calls
 
✓ Actual: 10,000 calls
 
✓ Variance: –10,000 calls (10,000 – 20,000)
You get 0 when you add the variance for Day 1 and Day 2 — 10,000 + 
(–10,000) — so the total forecast looks entirely accurate, even though the 
forecast was very wrong on both days.

147
 Chapter 7: Right People, Right Place, Right Time: Resource Management
Tracking accuracy with absolute forecast variance
Variance tracking, which uses only positive numbers, provides a realistic pic-
ture of how inaccurate forecasts are.
Using only positive numbers, you’d change the Day 2 results in the example 
in the preceding section to 10,000 calls, and you’d calculate the total variance 
by adding the two days’ variance amounts (10,000 calls + 10,000 calls = 
20,000 calls).
With this information, you can calculate the error percentage by using this 
formula:
Error percentage = Total variance ÷ Total actual calls
So in this example, you get
Error percentage = 20,000 ÷ (20,000 + 10,000) = 0.67 (67 percent)
This calculation process does away with negative numbers to show the total 
error in a daily forecast. It more accurately shows how good your forecast is, 
compared with the approach that uses both positive and negative numbers.
 
Your forecaster should do this type of analysis for monthly, daily, and half-
hourly calls and forecasts. Then you can use this information to reduce error 
to the smallest possible margin. Some forecasters use two or three different 
methods before they settle on the most accurate method to do their call-
volume forecasting.
Using the Tools of the Scheduling Trade
In Chapter 8, we focus on the guts of doing the scheduling job — a job that 
can involve a lot of work, especially in large call centers. Fortunately, many 
tools are available (some of which we outline in the following sections) that 
automate the scheduling function. Although these tools can help you sched-
ule, we believe that good schedulers should understand how basic schedul-
ing works and know how to do it the old-fashioned way — with paper, pencil, 
a calculator, and maybe an Erlang table or calculator (see the following 
section).
Calculating with Erlang C
Erlang C is a mathematical formula that helps you determine how many call 
center agents you need to meet forecasted demand. We’ll spare you the 
actual formula, but it takes into consideration the expected call volume, call 

148
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
length, and desired service level to calculate the number of people required 
on the phones. In essence, it calculates the occupancy (as defined in Chapter 6) 
of your agents so that you don’t have to estimate the level of occupancy in 
any half-hour period.
We don’t provide the Erlang C formula in this book, but you can find Erlang C 
calculators and tables on the Internet.
Planning with spreadsheets
Spreadsheets may just be the best tools ever created for the call center, and 
they’re probably the most frequently used. A lot of scheduling systems are 
either professionally or home-built spreadsheet programs.
You or your scheduler can easily manage the graphs and charts that we show 
throughout Chapter 8 by using a simple spreadsheet program.
Using workforce management software
If you have a very large call center, which makes manual scheduling a signifi-
cant challenge, you’re in luck: The workforce-management-software business 
for call centers is alive and well. A large number of workforce management sys-
tems and providers exist (see Chapter 9), and many of them are very good.
 
The value of these systems is in the process of forecasting, not in the tools 
themselves. A great tool used by someone who lacks this knowledge doesn’t 
do much good, but a person who has forecasting expertise can make a great 
tool sing.
Scheduling the Work That 
Your Call Center Needs to Do
Long before you create staff schedules, you need to figure out how much 
work the call center needs to do. The first step of the scheduling process 
(which we talk about in Chapter 8) is forecasting the number of contacts 
expected and the time required to handle those contacts for a given period 
(workload demand).

149
 Chapter 7: Right People, Right Place, Right Time: Resource Management
Call centers use different forecasting methods, ranging from simple to pain-
fully complex. When forecasting, you have to forecast both the volume of 
calls (and e-mails, and so on) and their length, or processing time. When you 
consider these factors together, you can arrive at a forecasted demand of 
workload by using the following formula:
Workload (or call load) = Call volume × Average call length
 
A 5 percent increase in call length has the same effect on staffing demand as a 
5 percent increase in call volume.
Before you finish your forecasting activity, you need to forecast the entire 
planning range — from long-term budgeting right down to the half-hour-
interval level (next Tuesday from 2:30 to 3 p.m., for example).
Call volume versus call load
Newcomers to call center resource man-
agement concepts often wrongly equate the 
amount of work to be done with call volume. 
This analogy explains the difference.
Imagine that you work for a company that dis-
tributes bricks. Big trucks drop off a lot of bricks 
that you sort and load onto smaller trucks to be 
shipped out to construction sites for homes, 
schools, hospitals, and so on. Assume that 
you’re the team leader in charge. You know 
that on a particular day, your team is going to 
handle a total volume of 10,000 bricks. Being a 
good team leader, you also know that your brick 
distribution agents (your staff) can carry 1,000 
pounds of bricks per day on average. So how 
many agents do you need to schedule for the 
day?
If you said 10 agents, guess again. You can’t 
know because you haven’t been given enough 
information! To determine how many staff 
members you need, you have to account for 
the weight of the bricks. Think about it: If each 
brick weighs 1 pound, you’ll have 10,000 pounds 
of load (volume = 10,000 bricks; average brick 
weight = 1 pound), meaning that you indeed 
require 10 staff members (carrying 1,000 pounds 
each).
If the bricks weigh 15 pounds each, your load is 
150,000 pounds, and you’re going to need to call 
some folks in for overtime.
Determining workload in the call center is 
essentially the same. It’s not enough simply 
to forecast how many calls you’re going to 
receive. You also need to know the weight of 
each call — or, more accurately, the load of 
each individual call. The load of an individual 
call is just the average time it takes to complete 
a call.
So overall workload in the call center equals 
call volume multiplied by average call length, 
and you need that information to really begin 
the process of forecasting staff.

150
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Starting long: The first step 
in forecasting call volume
One approach to forecasting involves starting with the long-term forecast 
and working down to the interval level. What this means is that you can fore-
cast the number of calls you might expect down to intervals of 30 minutes or 
even 15 minutes.
Consider the demand that you had last year. If your call center took 1,638,000 
calls last year, and you have no reason to believe that this business level will 
change, last year’s volume is a good starting place.
You can add a little insight to this forecast if you consider the trend year 
after year. If volume of work has increased by 10 percent every year for the 
past 10 years, you can probably assume that volume will increase this year 
by 10 percent.
Alternatively, you can calculate the volume of calls that you receive per cus-
tomer. If you’ve consistently received two calls per customer over the past 
several years, and you know that your customer base is increasing, increase 
your demand forecast by the expected customer base increase.
Here’s the formula for calculating forecasted demand:
Forecasted demand = Contacts per customer × Customer base expected
 
If you know about something that may materially change your volume of work, 
such as a new product line or a bankruptcy, make the assumption that you 
will get more calls, and add a percentage of extra calls into your forecast.
Breaking the forecast into intervals
A long-term forecast usually covers a year, but the specific dynamics of your 
situation dictate the length of your long-term forecast. Whatever period 
of time the forecast covers, after you make a long-term forecast, break it 
down into months, weeks, days, and half-hour intervals. To do these break-
down forecasts, which are simply the volume of calls for any period of time 
expressed as a percentage, you can use historical calling patterns.
Typical breakdown intervals include
 
✓ Monthly percentage of a year
 
✓ Daily percentage of a week
 
✓ Half-hourly (or hourly) percentage of a day

151
 Chapter 7: Right People, Right Place, Right Time: Resource Management
Table 7-1 shows an example monthly percentage breakdown of call distribu-
tion, based on the actual call volumes from the preceding year. You base the 
current year’s call volume forecast on these kinds of percentages.

The data in Table 7-1 contains the total call volume by month for the entire 
year. The far-right column (Percentage of Year) is a calculation of each 
month’s percentage of total annual call volume. The call volume — and the 
corresponding monthly percentage — decreased from June to August. The 
retail industry commonly sees this type of call pattern because fewer custom-
ers tend to call for sales or service inquiries during the summer months. The 
call volume increases in September (9.16 percent of the total year’s volume), 
when customers get back to school and business, and again in December 
(10.38 percent), because people are calling to do their Christmas shopping.
Ideally, you calculate the monthly percentage by using several years’ worth of 
monthly call volume. If you know that your business is going to increase by 
10 percent next year and that call volume will increase with the business, 
creating your forecast is as simple as increasing last year’s call volume 
by 10 percent and then multiplying the new total call volume by the monthly 
percentages.
After calculating the percentage of volume by period (month, week, and day), 
you can graph the pattern, as shown in Figure 7-1, and look for any trends.

152

Figure 7-1: 
A monthly 
call distribu-
tion chart 
based on 
the preced-
ing year’s 
forecast.
 
The call center depicted in Figure 7-1 is fairly busy during the winter months, 
gets slower in the summer, has a busy spike in September, and reaches its 
peak in December. These trends make sense if this call center is in the retail 
industry. Winter is working time for most people; vacations and breaks 
from school happen in the summer, September is a time of return to work 
or school for many people, and December is the busiest retail period of the 
year.
To make a forecast based on last year’s results, assuming that this year’s call 
volume will increase by 10 percent, use this formula:
Forecasted volume for this year = (Last year’s volume × 0.1) + Last year’s 
volume
In the example from Table 7-1, you calculate
Forecasted volume for this year = (1,638,000 × 0.1) + 1,638,000 = 1,801,800
So the call center has a forecast for this year of 1,801,800 calls.

153
 Chapter 7: Right People, Right Place, Right Time: Resource Management
If you want a forecast for the call volume of a month in this year, you use this 
formula:
Forecasted monthly call volume = Forecasted annual call volume × 
Month’s historical percentage
To calculate the forecast for January for the call center in Table 7-1, you plug 
those values into the formula:
Forecasted monthly call volume = 1,801,800 × 0.0916 = 165,045
So the forecasted total call volume for this January is 165,045 calls.
Next, you need to determine the distribution of work over days of the week 
and hours of the day, following the same process of reviewing historical 
patterns.
When you look at trends that repeat, you can predict with some confidence 
that they will occur again. Update these relationships continually. Generally, 
the more data you use — that is, the larger the time frames, which means 
the broader the overview — you will be able to create a forecast with greater 
accuracy.
Suppose that the question you’re trying to answer is “How many calls should 
we expect from 2 to 2:30 p.m. on Wednesdays in March if we’re forecasting 
1,801,800 calls for the year?” Use this formula:
Forecasted calls from 2 to 2:30 p.m. on Wednesdays in March = ([Annual 
forecast × Month percentage of the year] ÷ Days in month) × Active call 
center days in week × Day percentage of the week × Time span percent-
age of the day
Plug in the numbers, and you get
([1,801,800 × 0.0904) ÷ 31) × 7 × 0.16 × 0.051 = 300 calls
Following is a summary of the assumptions used:
 
✓ This year’s annual forecast: 1,801,800 calls
 
✓ March percentage of the year: 9.04 percent
 
✓ Wednesday percentage of the week: 16 percent
 
✓ 2 to 2:30 p.m. percentage of the day: 5.1 percent

154

Forecasting call length
You can use a variety of methods to forecast call length. We like to track 
historical call length on a half-hourly basis and use the average for a given 
period — such as over a rotating four-week period, as shown in Table 7-2.

Accounting for unique situations
You can’t always forecast future call volume predictably. Sometimes, things 
happen that disrupt historical patterns, and although these special situations 
tend to make forecasters crazy, you can plan for them. Simply track their 
impact on historical calling patterns.
Holidays, for example, disrupt historical calling patterns for most call cen-
ters. If your call center is open on Christmas Day, you probably don’t get the 
same type of caller demand that you have on a normal workday.
 
A good forecaster can track the historical effect of a day such as Christmas on 
normal calling patterns and adjust his forecast by that effect.
Suppose that Christmas falls on a Wednesday this year. Looking at the 
example forecasting data in the section “Breaking the forecast into intervals,” 
earlier in this chapter, you find
 
✓ Forecast for the year: 1,800,801 calls
 
✓ December percentage: 10.38 percent
 
✓ Wednesday percentage: 16 percent

155
 Chapter 7: Right People, Right Place, Right Time: Resource Management
This information assembles the normal forecasting data. Your forecaster 
knows from experience that Christmas Day has a lower call volume than a 
regular day; in fact, Christmas Day is only 30 percent of a normal day. So your 
call volume forecast for this year’s Christmas Day (using the formula from 
the section “Breaking the forecast into intervals,” earlier in this chapter, with 
31 days in December and 7 days in a work week) uses this formula:
Forecasted calls for Christmas Day = ([1,800,801 × 0.1038] ÷ 31) × 7 × 0.16 
× 0.3 = 2,026 calls
Now you have a forecast for Christmas Day. The forecaster may also know 
that call volume isn’t distributed over Christmas Day in the same way that it 
is on other days. She would also have the historical call times for Christmas 
Days and use this pattern when forecasting half-hourly call volume.
 
You can use the same approach for other special events that disrupt normal 
call volume, such as holidays, storms, and promotions. Your forecaster 
merely tracks and applies these historical effects.

Call Center Scheduling: 
Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
In This Chapter
▶ Determining what resources your call center needs — and when
▶ Creating schedules to get the work done
▶ Boosting employee morale and productivity with flexible shifts
▶ Handling unique scheduling situations
A
s the chapter title suggests, creating a call center schedule isn’t a 
simple thing. It’s more difficult than trying to hit a moving target. In 
fact, it’s a little like trying to hit that moving target while you’re moving, too. 
The mechanics don’t have to be particularly complicated, however, as long 
as you follow a relatively specific process in your effort to ensure that you 
have the right people in the right place at the right time to answer all those 
calls.
In this chapter, we outline the typical steps of the scheduling process.
Calculating the Resources 
Required to Do the Job
After you forecast your call volume and average call length for each half-
hour interval of the year (as we discuss in Chapter 7), determine the staffing 
resources that you need to handle the forecasted demand over the selected 
period of time so that you can develop your schedules.

158
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Considering occupancy
The most important relationship in resource management is the one between 
call workload (call volume × average call length) and total staffing require-
ments. Not to worry — you have only to use a simple formula to determine 
the number of staff members you require. (We talk more about occupancy in 
Chapter 6.)
The formula to calculate staffing, although simple, is very important:
Staffing required = Forecasted call volume × Forecasted call length ÷ 
Expected occupancy
As much as you may want (from a pure production standpoint, at least) your 
agents to be occupied — dealing with customer contacts — 100 percent of 
the time, you just can’t make that happen. From the customer’s point of view, 
calls are stacked up in the phone system, waiting for an agent to become 
available, which means lots of time spent waiting to talk to an agent. From 
your agents’ point of view, burnout becomes an issue when there’s no down-
time between calls. When determining your staffing requirements, you have 
to account for the fact that sometimes, your agents will be idle.
After you forecast the workload — the total amount of time that it’s going 
to take to handle all the calls — simply divide that number by the expected 
occupancy to determine the amount of staff time for which you need to 
schedule.
Busy versus idle time
Suppose that you forecast 150 hours of work-
load for the day, meaning that you’re expecting 
150 hours of calls. Your expected occupancy is 
75 percent, meaning that your agents, on aver-
age, will be idle 25 percent of the time they’re 
on the phones. The number of staff hours 
required to handle this load is 150 hours of load 
divided by 75 percent occupancy, which equals 
200 hours.
Confused? Look at the equation the other way 
around. If you had 200 hours of agents staffing 
the phones, and they were occupied 75 percent 
of the time, this equation would tell you how 
many hours they were occupied:
 
 0.75 × 200 on-the-phone hours = 150 hours 
of occupied time
In other words, agents were busy actually 
working for 150 hours.

159
 Chapter 8: Call Center Scheduling: Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
Calculating expected occupancy
To calculate your staffing requirements, you have to know your expected 
occupancy.
You can figure out expected occupancy in a couple of ways: You can look 
at the history of your operation and establish approximate benchmarks for 
occupancy, or you can calculate it by using a formula. We outline both of 
these approaches in this section.
For an established call center, you can most easily look at the occupancy 
that your operation typically achieves at any time when it’s hitting the acces-
sibility/service-level target. If your call center typically achieves a monthly 
occupancy of 74 percent when making its service-level targets, for example, 
74 percent is a fair expected occupancy for the month.
In busier months, expected occupancy will be higher, and in slower months, 
it’ll be lower. The difference isn’t going to be dramatic, so don’t get too 
worked up about it; just keep an eye on the trend so that you can collect 
information on it and adjust your staffing in the future.
Also, be a bit careful about the time frames you’re using when working 
with expected occupancy. Occupancy fluctuates throughout the day. As 
we explain in Chapter 6, occupancy varies with demand, and because call 
volume fluctuates throughout the day, occupancy also fluctuates, which cre-
ates a range of expected occupancies. The good news is that monthly and 
daily occupancies don’t fluctuate a great deal at any given service level.
Improved scheduling can increase expected occupancy, so plan for and cap-
ture the small improvements in your expected-occupancy calculations. Even 
a 1 percent improvement in expected occupancy can produce significant cost 
savings.
 
Another way to calculate expected occupancy is to use an Erlang C table 
(which we mention in Chapter 7) to calculate optimal occupancy for every 
hour or half hour of the day. Then you multiply the optimal occupancy that 
you calculate with Erlang C by your historical scheduling efficiency.
Alternatively, you can buy a good workforce management system and let it 
work out expected occupancy for you. While you’re allowing this tool to do 
its job, make sure that you understand the difference between actual occu-
pancy and optimal occupancy. Small improvements in actual occupancy can 
make a big difference in call center efficiency and cost control.

Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Calculating expected occupancy 
versus optimal occupancy
As we discuss in Chapter 6, occupancy is defined as the time agents are 
actively busy doing something (they’re occupied, not idle), expressed as a 
percentage of the time they’re logged into the phones. Optimal occupancy is 
the occupancy that a call center would achieve if it were staffed perfectly for 
every hour of the day. You’d have just the right number of people idle and 
just the right number of people working, so agents would answer calls within 
the service-level objective — no faster and no slower.
Call centers rarely achieve optimal occupancy while also meeting their 
service-level targets. More likely, they achieve a lower occupancy for several 
reasons:
 
✓ Unpredictable call patterns: Call volume doesn’t always arrive exactly 
as expected. Even when your forecasts are very accurate, calls don’t 
arrive exactly as you plan, creating an imbalance between actual staff 
scheduled and what you really need for optimal occupancy.
 
✓ Disruptions in staffing plans: Your staffing doesn’t always work out 
exactly as you plan it, either. People often are late or absent, or last-
minute demands such as training take agents away from their primary 
call-handling duties. These unexpected changes detract from your staff-
ing plan, making it difficult to achieve optimal occupancy.
 
✓ Inflexible workforce: The biggest challenge in achieving optimal occu-
pancy involves dealing with a workforce that isn’t perfectly flexible. In 
a perfect world, your staff would come and go just when your callers 
come and go, which would allow the call center to meet caller demand 
precisely. In this wonderful world, your agents would work only when 
you needed them — a few minutes here, a few minutes there.
Although you can increase flexibility, you can’t get the ideal amount of 
flexibility. Typically, the best you can do is come close to your call arrival 
patterns, staffing a little over here and a little under there, but being approxi-
mately right overall. This approach reduces the efficiency of your schedule, 
therefore reducing actual occupancy achieved and taking it further from your 
optimal occupancy. The first graph in Figure 8-1 shows a schedule in the 
perfect world, and the second graph illustrates a more realistic, imperfect 
schedule.
Note: To make charting easier, we use a 24-hour clock for time references in 
this chapter.

Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
When you do this type of analysis, calculating monthly staffing requirements, 
you get a big-picture view of how many staff members you need, which you 
can use for budgeting purposes. To do this calculation, you need a forecasted 
call volume; a forecasted call length; and expected occupancy, which is 
based on your target service-level objective.
Here’s an example:
 
✓ For the upcoming year, you’ve forecasted a 10 percent increase over last 
year’s volume of 1,638,000 calls.
 
✓ Calls in March represent 9.04 percent of the year.
 
✓ Calls average 350 seconds in length.
 
✓ Your expected occupancy is 74 percent for the month at a service level 
of 80 percent in 20 seconds.
To calculate staffing requirement for one month, use this formula:
Staffing requirement for one month = (Last year’s call volume + [Last 
year’s call volume × Forecasted increase percentage]) × March percent-
age × Forecasted call length ÷ Seconds in one hour ÷ Expected occupancy
So for the example information in the preceding list, you get
Staffing requirement for March = (1,638,000 + [1,638,000 × 0.1]) × 0.0904 × 
350 ÷ 3,600 ÷ 0.74 = 21,400 hours
To handle the forecasted call volume at the forecasted call length, you need 
21,400 agent hours on the phones.
Determining scheduling efficiency
The term scheduling efficiency refers to how 
close the call center gets to achieving opti-
mal occupancy. If a center’s optimal occu-
pancy is 90 percent, for example, and the call 
center produces actual occupancy of 80 per-
cent, its scheduling efficiency is 88.8 percent 
(80 percent ÷ 90 percent = 88.8 percent). About 
the best we see in scheduling efficiency is 
92 percent.
Expected occupancy is the occupancy level 
that your call center expects to hit, given its 
existing demand and scheduling. This expec-
tation doesn’t mean that you don’t want to 
improve and get closer to your optimal occu-
pancy — just that you know that for the time 
being, you’re running at 80 percent. As sched-
uling efficiency improves, you can adjust your 
scheduling efficiency forecast.

163
 Chapter 8: Call Center Scheduling: Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
Here’s a breakdown of this formula:
 
✓ Last year’s call volume + (Last year’s call volume × Forecasted 
increase percentage): This part of the calculation creates the new 
annual forecast.
 
✓ March percentage: Multiplying by March’s percentage gives you the 
March forecast for next year.
 
✓ Forecasted call length: Multiplying by the forecasted call length deter-
mines the workload for March.
 
✓ Seconds in one hour: Dividing by the number of seconds in one hour 
expresses the workload in hours.
 
✓ Expected occupancy: Dividing by your expected occupancy turns the 
workload into total staffing requirements, in hours, for March.
 
Be sure to divide by 3,600 to turn the result into hours. Otherwise, you get 
your forecasted staff requirements in seconds (and you don’t want to risk 
giving your schedulers heart failure when they see that number!).
Affecting occupancy
According to the immutable laws of the call center, you can affect occupancy 
in several ways:
 
✓ Change how fast agents answer the phone. Answering the phone 
quickly means that your agents spend more time waiting for calls. 
Answering quickly decreases occupancy. Answering the phone slowly 
means that your agents spend less time waiting for calls. In fact, the 
calls may be waiting for them! Answering the phone slowly increases 
occupancy.
 
✓ Pool your resources. When you increase the size of your call center (by 
merging sites or pooling calls from different campaigns, for example), 
you reduce the overall randomness of call arrivals, because callers’ 
decisions to contact you begin to merge, and the call arrival pattern 
begins to smooth out. (Figure 8-2 compares call arrivals at a small center 
and a large one.) Because the large call center has a smaller difference 
between the variance in call volume compared with the average than in 
the small call center, it needs fewer staffing resources (as a percentage 
of total staff) to answer the phone quickly.

164
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
 
Figure 8-2: 
Taking 
advantage 
of econo-
mies of 
scale.
 
 
 With a larger group of agents, your scheduling efficiency improves; the 
incremental staff that you need for a big call center isn’t directly pro-
portional to the increase in workload/call volume. While the operation 
gets bigger, you begin to realize economies of scale; the call center can 
answer calls with better occupancy and, therefore, at a lower cost.
 
 To take advantage of these economies of scale, minimize the number of 
distinct answering groups in the call center by cross-training agents so 
that they can excel in several campaigns and by merging groups wher-
ever it’s possible and practical to do so.

165
 Chapter 8: Call Center Scheduling: Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
 
✓ Get better at scheduling. If your staff schedule results in massive over-
staffing for 80 percent of your operating hours and massive understaff-
ing for the remaining 20 percent, overall, you have an 80 percent level of 
accessibility (a common target in call centers). You have a low overall 
occupancy, however, and 20 percent of your customers — the ones who 
called while you were understaffed — will be very unhappy.
 
✓ Increase the flexibility of your staffing. If you have full-time employees 
who start work at the same time and take breaks at the same time, your 
staffing won’t match the way your calls arrive. You can increase your 
staffing flexibility by using part-time staff, varying the length of agent 
shifts, and using split shifts (such as agents working three hours in the 
morning and four hours at night). Home agents — agents who work at 
home (see Chapter 11) — have become popular in part because this setup 
gives agents more lifestyle flexibility and also helps improve occupancy.
Delivering good service costs money. Before you decide to save some costs 
by reducing staff and taking more time to answer the phone, check with your 
customers. They may have an issue with waiting 20 minutes to receive the 
service they’re seeking.
Scheduling close to the curve — meaning that you match your staff schedule 
closely to caller demand — is a better way to achieve your accessibility target. 
During some times of the day, you’re slightly overstaffed, and at other times, 
you’re slightly understaffed. Overall, you still achieve 80 percent accessibility, 
but you have much higher occupancy, and the other 20 percent of callers 
probably will be less disgruntled because your agents answer their calls only 
slightly less quickly than the average speed of answer during the day.
The graphs in Figure 8-3 illustrate these scenarios. Both graphs show the 
same call arrival, and both cases achieve 80 percent accessibility, but sched-
uled staff is much more in line with demand in the second chart, which 
increases overall occupancy.
Give ’em a break: Accounting 
for off-phone time
Calculating on-phone staffing requirements isn’t the whole story. When 
people work for your company, you pay them for more than just the time 
they’re on the phones. Your employees also get paid for training, meetings, 
breaks, and so on.

166

You need to take agent utilization — a measure that tracks how much of an 
agent’s paid time is spent processing the work — into consideration. Of the 
total hours that you pay your agents, what percentage of this time do they 
end up doing actual work — on the phones taking calls or on the computer 
handling customer e-mails, for example?

167
 Chapter 8: Call Center Scheduling: Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
After you determine how much staffing you need just to handle the work, you 
need to think about giving those people time away for meetings, breaks, vaca-
tion, training, and the like.
If you pay an agent for 10 hours, and he spends 7 of those hours logged in 
working on telephone calls and 3 hours off the phone on breaks and in meet-
ings, agent utilization is 70 percent.
Tracking, planning, and understanding historical utilization rates allow you to 
adjust your scheduling practices for the future. Most operations can forecast 
agent-utilization rates with a fair degree of accuracy.
You use a formula similar to the calculation used to account for occupancy 
(which we discuss in the section “Calculating expected occupancy,” earlier in 
this chapter) to get the total paid hours required:
Paid hours requirement = Forecasted staff work hours ÷ Agent utilization
Suppose that you need 21,400 hours of staffing for March, and your fore-
casted agent utilization is 70 percent. You would use this formula:
Paid hours requirement = 21,400 ÷ 0.7 = 30,571 hours
So you need 30,571 hours of paid staff time to handle the forecasted calls.
After you establish the number of paid hours you need to answer the fore-
casted calls, you calculate the number of agents you need by using this 
formula:
Full-time equivalents (FTEs) required for a month = Paid time required for 
a month ÷ Hours per month per FTE
Now assume that a typical full-time agent in your center receives 155 paid 
hours per month:
FTEs required for March = 30,571 ÷ 155 = 198 FTEs (rounded up)
So you need 198 FTE agents in your office during March. (Usually, an FTE is the 
number of hours that a typical full-time employee works in a given period. You 
use this term to express staffing requirements, as we explain in Chapter 7.) You 
need to round up the FTEs to the nearest whole number. An FTE represents a 
whole person, and you generally don’t schedule partial people (although you 
may occasionally schedule some who aren’t quite all there).
Calculate the additional cost of every percentage-point decrease in your 
agent utilization so you understand its impact on the cost of your call center. 

168
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Just run your staffing calculations for different agent-utilization levels, and 
multiply each by your cost of labor (including benefits). In addition to shock-
ing the life out of you, this information can really help you control your 
budget or make cost-benefit calculations.
 
Not long ago, Réal showed a call center director the effect of a 1 percent 
change in agent-utilization ratio. A 1 percent change in agent utilization was 
worth more than $30,000 per month to the call center. Up until that point, the 
center hadn’t paid a great deal of attention to agent utilization. After Réal went 
over this number with the director, agent utilization became a hot topic in the 
call center and improved dramatically the very next month.
Determining When the 
Resources Are Required
After you figure out how much you’re going to spend on staffing, you still 
don’t know when those people are going to work. You have to take the 
forecast down to a lower level of detail to determine when your call center 
requires the resources — right down to the daily and half-hourly (interval) 
basis.
Calculating base staff requirements 
by half-hour intervals
Using the example from “Calculating the Resources Required to Do the Job,” 
earlier in this chapter, calculate the staffing requirements for each interval in 
March to build the schedule requirement.
You use this formula:
Staff required for particular period of time = Forecasted call volume ÷ 
Days in month × Days in the work week × Day’s percentage of the week 
× Interval percentage of the day × Forecasted call length ÷ Seconds per 
interval ÷ Expected occupancy
This information allows you to calculate the staff required:
 
✓ Interval: 14:00 to 14:30
 
✓ Day of week: Wednesday

169
 Chapter 8: Call Center Scheduling: Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
 
✓ Wednesday proportion of week: 16 percent
 
✓ Interval’s proportion of day: 5.1 percent
Plug this information into the formula:
Staff required for 14:00 to 14:30 on Wednesday = 162,883 ÷ 31 × 7 × 0.16 × 
0.051 × 350 ÷ 1,800 ÷ 0.77 = 76 employees (rounded up)
So you need 76 agents on the phones from 14:00 to 14:30 (2:00 to 2:30 p.m.) 
on Wednesdays in March.
Here’s a breakdown of this calculation:
 
✓ March’s forecasted call volume: You take last year’s volume, increase it 
by 10 percent, and multiply by March’s historical proportion of the year 
(9.04 percent).
 
✓ Call volume for the average week of the month: Divide the monthly call 
volume forecast by the number of days in the month to get the average 
daily call volume; then multiply by the number of working days in the 
week.
 
 In this example, we divide March’s forecasted call volume by 31 
(because March has 31 days) and then multiply by 7 (the number of 
working days per week for this call center). This calculation expresses 
the monthly volume in terms of one week of the month, making it easy 
to calculate Wednesday’s forecast simply by multiplying the weekly fore-
cast by 16 percent (Wednesday’s proportion of the week) — giving you 
5,885 calls.
 
✓ Forecasted interval call volume: Multiply 5,885 calls by the time inter-
val percentage (5.1 percent) to arrive at the forecasted interval call 
volume — 300 calls.
 
✓ Staffing workload requirement: Multiply 300 calls by the average call 
length of 350 seconds to get an overall staffing workload requirement of 
105,000 seconds.
 
✓ Workload by the half-hour: To determine how many staff you need to 
handle the work in a half-hour interval, divide 105,000 seconds by 1,800 
(the number of seconds in a half hour) to determine staff required on 
the phones, which gives you 58.33.
 
✓ Factor in occupancy: Based on the volume expected from 14:00 to 14:30, 
the call center will be near its peak, resulting in higher occupancy than 
average — around 77 percent. Divide the occupied staff requirement by 
your 77 percent expected occupancy, and you see that you need 75.75 
total staff on the phones. Rounding this number up (unless you have 
three quarters of a person somewhere on staff) means that you need to 
schedule for 76 agents during the interval 14:00 to 14:30 on Wednesdays 
in March this year.

170
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Now just go back and do this calculation for every half-hour period of the 
month (and year) to determine your staffing pattern. We help get you started 
with an example in Table 8-1, which calculates staff requirements by interval 
for all of Wednesday. Figure 8-4 charts the result.

Adding in the off-phone requirements
After you determine the forecasted number of staff you need on the phones 
for each half-hour interval of the day, you need to layer in the staffing 
requirements for nonphone needs, such as breaks, training, meetings, sick 
leave, and vacation.
First, determine what percentage of your staffing goes to each of these activi-
ties. You can use historical averages or estimate what you need. You can’t 
exactly predict some items, such as sick leave, so you need to allow for them 
as percentages based on historical averages. You can plan other items, such 
as meetings, around peak periods.
Table 8-2 shows Wednesday’s staffing requirements from the calculation 
of staff required for a half-hour interval (refer to Table 8-1), with off-phone 
allowances considered. Therefore, this table provides actual total staffing 
requirements for each interval of the day. The resulting chart is illustrated in 
Figure 8-5.
To calculate the staff required to handle calls, you use the process that we 
explain in the preceding section. (You can see the numbers in Table 8-1.)

 Chapter 8: Call Center Scheduling: Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
After you know how many employees you need to handle calls, use this for-
mula to calculate total staffing required:
Total staffing requirement = Staff required to handle calls + Sick leave + 
Breaks + Meetings
If you plug in the information for the interval between 8:00 and 8:30, you get 
this calculation:
Total staffing requirement = 24 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 26 staff members
Continue this calculation for each half-hour interval of every day of every 
week of the month to find out how many actual bodies in seats you need to 
have at any point during the month. You can use this data in planning your 
call center’s work schedules.
 
Figure 8-5: 
Total

Don’t forget shrinkage!
Did you know that 2 percent of the whiskey 
that’s aging in kegs evaporates every year? 
This lost portion is frequently referred to as 
“the angels’ share.” Well, in call centers, some 
of your staff evaporate when they’re work-
ing on the phones. Missing time comes from 
many sources, including breaks that go too 
long, extra breaks, and unplanned meetings 
and discussions. These situations happen, and 
you really can’t prevent them, so plan for them. 
If your call center loses 5 percent of its staff’s 
time, add that missing 5 percent back into your 
scheduling. Give yourself a little extra time pad-
ding so that you don’t end up short-staffed.

174
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Using your forecast to determine 
call center size
If you’re planning to build a call center of your own (as we discuss in Chapter 4), 
you need a bodies-in-seats calculation (discussed in the preceding section) 
to determine the size of your center. Simply follow the process in the preced-
ing section to calculate the staffing requirement for each interval of the year 
and then find the peak interval — the one that requires the highest number of 
staff. That number represents the maximum number of agents that you need 
in your center at any given time to meet your service-level targets and pro-
jected occupancy, and it tells you how many seats you need. It’s a simplified 
method, not taking into account growth or changes in the business, but it’s a 
first step. Then you can plan for what you believe you’ll need in the future.
Scheduling Available Resources 
to Meet Caller Demand
After you determine the half-hourly staffing demand (which we talk about in 
“Determining When the Resources Are Required,” earlier in this chapter), you 
need to plan schedules around that demand. At this point, don’t worry about 
who, specifically, is going to work these schedules. (We go into that process 
in “Creating People-Friendly Schedules,” later in this chapter.) Just build 
schedules to match staffing as closely as possible to demand.
Starting to build your schedules 
with full-time shifts
You can match available resources to caller demand by creating a graph 
that compares caller demand with total staff scheduled. In Figure 8-6, caller 
demand throughout the day is graphed by using the demand calculated in 
Table 8-2, represented by the bars.
This graph also includes scheduled shifts (the line in the graph) in an effort 
to match staffing with caller demand. To start building a schedule, this call 
center added a shift of 26 staff members working from 8:00 until 16:00.

175
 Chapter 8: Call Center Scheduling: Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
In this figure, the staffing line isn’t consistent. The chart shows that total 
staffing has scheduled dips at 11:00, 13:00, and 15:00. Figure 8-6 shows that 
this single 8-hour shift of 26 staff members can’t cover the entire day’s caller 
demand. These dips in staffing represent breaks that scheduled employees 
take during their day.
Not everyone takes breaks at the same time, of course, and you can stagger 
breaks if you want. At this point in the scheduling process, however, you’re 
still dealing with broad strokes. When you fine-tune the schedule later, you 
can adjust the breaks.
Next, you need to continue to add shifts toward completing your schedule.
Figure 8-7 shows a bump of overlapping shifts in the middle of the day, from 
approximately 13:00 until 16:30. This bump occurs because the end of one 
full-time shift overlaps with the beginning of another full-time shift. As you 
probably can imagine, if you continued adding only full-time staff shifts, 
you’d likely end up with a significant amount of overstaffing — a big bump — 
in the middle of the day.
 
Figure 8-6: 
Adding full-
time shifts 
to meet 
required 
staffing
 
If you continue adding shifts, a pattern soon emerges, as shown in Figure 8-8.
You can continue to add shifts that have different start and stop times. Aim 
to make the available-staffing line equal the caller-demand bars. But you can 
use only as many shifts as you have people to work said shifts. One shift per 
employee — that’s it.

176
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
You’re almost done; you just have to fill in the cracks. In this case, adding 
any more full-time shifts would create a great deal of overlap. You can accept 
this overlap, continuing to use full-time shifts — in which case you’re prob-
ably moderately overstaffed or understaffed at various times throughout the 
day, which decreases the efficiency of your schedule — or you can attempt 
to schedule some part-time shifts in the mix, as we discuss in the following 
section.

 Chapter 8: Call Center Scheduling: Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
Filling in the gaps with part-time shifts
Part-time shifts help fill the gaps in your schedule created by the overlap 
of full-time shifts. Figure 8-9 shows the final completed schedule for the 
Wednesday example from the preceding sections.
 
Figure 8-9: 
A completed 
schedule, 
using full-
time and 
part-time 
shifts.
 
You can’t make the schedule perfect — and that’s okay. Ideally, you get as 
close to your requirement line as possible. If you have some overlap (over-
staffing) during the middle of the day, you can use that time to conduct train-
ing and meetings or to assign agents to do essential nonphone work.
You can also help shore up the weak areas — where you have some under-
staffing — by adjusting breaks and lunch times. Certainly, your department 
scheduler should make everyone aware of the weak spots in your schedule 
so that no one plans meetings during these times.
Part-time shifts present some problems, however. You may find managing 
more difficult when you have a large number of agents staffed for short shifts, 
and you can have problems attracting good part-time agents.
Attracting and retaining good part-timers is challenging. Compensate part-
time agents at least as well as you do full-time agents on an hour-by-hour 
basis. The key is to ensure that you hire agents who want part-time sched-
ules; otherwise, they’ll find other jobs. Finding a good fit for a part-time 
employee’s lifestyle is key, and the benefit you’ll get for your efforts is 
increased efficiency (occupancy).

178
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
Creating a summary of schedules
When you finish creating your schedule, you actually have a bunch of shift 
schedules, each requiring a certain number of positions. Table 8-3 shows 
what the total number of schedules for the Wednesday example that we use 
in this chapter might look like.
Table 8-3

After you complete Wednesday, you get to do the whole process all over 
again, and again, and again — for each day of the week.
Creating weekly schedules
The summary of schedules lists every schedule that you create to meet the 
daily demand for agents. You need to select shifts from the summary and 
create weekly work schedules.
A weekly work schedule includes several days’ worth of shifts and days off. 
It’s beneficial for agents to have consecutive days off (and might create a life-
style that encourages them to remain employees for a long time).
 
Be sure to check that your scheduling practices meet the employment regula-
tions of your company and your state, province, and/or country.
Weekly work schedules have more rows of shifts than the daily schedule. 
While you add days off to complete the schedules, you’re essentially creating 
various five-day work weeks over the seven days, creating more rows. Use all 
the daily shifts created, and assign each to a weekly schedule.

179
 Chapter 8: Call Center Scheduling: Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
Creating People-Friendly Schedules
After you create your schedule, you can attach the names of agents whom 
you want to work the shifts. You can most easily simply pick names and 
assign them to a schedule — if, that is, you really don’t want people to 
like you.
Probably the safest (and fairest) way, especially in large call centers, is to 
post the schedules and allow staff members to bid on the available shifts, as 
we describe in the following section.
Letting agents bid for shifts
You usually determine an agent’s bid priority based on seniority: The most 
senior agents get the highest priority. You could determine bid priority 
based on other criteria, such as performance: Agents who perform best over 
a certain period receive the highest bidding priority.
Allow the employee who has the highest bid number to pick first, and 
eliminate the shift that she picks so that it’s not available for others. The 
employee with the next-highest bid number chooses next, and you continue 
that way until all the shifts are assigned.
Shift bids can be time-consuming. Follow these steps (and make sure that 
you’ve documented them clearly for your staff and managers):
 
1. Communicate the clear criteria and process for shift bids.
 
 Staff members need to know the process and the criteria every day, not 
just when shift-bidding starts. If one criterion is tenure, for example, 
does it depend on the number of hours worked or just time on job?
 
2. Communicate the available shifts to all staff members.
 
 The staff needs time — frequently more than a week — to review those 
shifts.
 
3. Ask agents to submit their shift preferences in writing.
 
4. Sort the bid requests based on your established criteria (see Step 1).
 
5. Assign shifts based on these requests.
 
 In bid-number order (however you assign priority), determine whether 
each employee’s first choice is available. If so, assign that shift to that 
employee. If an agent’s first choice isn’t available, look to his next prefer-
ence, and so on.

180
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
When you follow these steps manually, however, the process is complex and 
lengthy. Some call centers use alternatives to shift bids, including rotating 
staff through all shifts (essentially sharing the pain), working around employ-
ees’ personal preferences, making assignments based on employee perfor-
mance, or scheduling fixed permanent shifts. Also, you may need to make 
some special accommodations based on an employee’s disability.
Many call centers gravitate toward seniority-based shift bids, because as a 
call center grows, accommodating the preferences of every staff member 
becomes increasingly difficult. Also, in large call centers, shifts can change a 
great deal. Rotating staff through all schedules is very effective and equitable 
but not always preferred by the most senior employee. In our experience, a 
seniority-based shift bid is the most common — and most agreeable — way 
to assign schedules in large call centers.
 
If you use performance or seniority to determine shift-bid priority, be careful 
when assigning schedules for newly hired staff. If several new staff members 
start working at the same time, you may want to assign them a temporary 
post-training work schedule instead of simply giving them the lowest shifts 
on the totem pole. Otherwise, a large percentage of new hires working at the 
same time (usually on night shifts) puts a strain on the management team and 
creates an imbalance in staffing. Keep in mind that new people usually take 
longer to serve customers and, as a result, skew average call length.
You might consider having a temporary post-training schedule. You can 
spread the newbies around on the shifts and thereby spread out the effect of 
their lack of experience.
Offering flextime
Admit it — many call centers have some less-than-desirable shifts. Staff can 
find working these shifts to be somewhat demoralizing, considering that the 
majority of folks would rather be working 9 to 5 Monday to Friday. You can 
ease their angst in several ways:
 
✓ Rebidding: Redo the schedule from time to time so that you can cor-
rect any problems that gradually creep in. When new staff members join 
and other folks move on, the seniority of those employees who remain 
improves. A rebid allows staff members to move up the call center food 
chain and get more desirable shifts, which can really improve your 
team’s motivation.
 
 If your call center doesn’t use a shift bid, you need to fill vacancies in 
your schedule with new staff in a way that your staff sees as equitable.
 
✓ Shift-trading: The time-honored tradition of trading shifts really is as 
simple as it sounds: Give your employees a mechanism for trading their 
shifts (“You work my 9-to-5, and I’ll work your 1-to-9”). Staff members 

181
 Chapter 8: Call Center Scheduling: Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
usually trade shifts on a one-day-at-a-time basis, but you can also allow 
employees to trade entire schedules.
 
✓ Time bank/flextime: In addition to regular vacations, you can allow 
employees the option to bank time (they work an extra hour today, and 
instead of getting paid for that hour, they bank the time). The extra 
hours that they have worked can be taken as time off at a future date. 
This approach works well if you administer and track it carefully. You 
need some kind of mechanism to allow employees time off one day at a 
time in addition to their regular vacation process. This method allows 
you to respond to unexpected increases in call volume or to employee 
absences.
 
Scheduling practices are subject to the employment standards of both your 
organization and government. Make sure that you adhere to limitations on the 
number of overtime hours permitted, and find out whether you’re allowed to 
bank employee hours.
Accounting for Unique Situations
In discussions of call center scheduling, the focus tends to be on a rather 
typical, generic, inbound operation: one type of call coming into one site. 
If only life were that simple! The following sections talk about some special 
situations and circumstances that you may need to consider.
Scheduling for different types of work
You must plan for and schedule non-inbound-call work, based on the specific 
type of work.
Outbound calling is likely the most common type of other work that you need 
to schedule, and it’s actually easier to forecast than inbound calling. Outbound 
call volume is very predictable (even when you’re using a predictive dialer), so 
you can easily forecast your occupancy and average call length.
As we explain in Chapter 9, a predictive dialer is a piece of technology used 
to increase efficiency in dialing outbound calls. The dialer places more out-
bound calls than the available number of agents but sorts out answering 
machines, busy signals, and other nonhuman interactions before delivering 
live calls to the agents.
If you’re conducting a stand-alone outbound project, scheduling is a simple 
matter of deciding how many calls you want to make by a certain time of day, 
calculating how many staff that figure equates to per hour, and staffing to fit. 

182
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
You use the same math that you do for inbound forecasting, as we describe 
in detail in Chapter 7.
Making contingency plans
What happens when you do all the planning and still have more callers than 
you can handle — or you have too many staff and too few callers (in which 
case the boss is probably asking, “Why is everyone just sitting around?”)?
A lot can change from the time that you do your forecast and create your 
schedule to the time that calls arrive. You can get an unexpected increase in 
call volume; a large percentage of the staff can call in sick; and/or systems can 
get slow, causing call length to go up. Success is determined by how you handle 
these kinds of situations. The following sections suggest some strategies.
Blending various work types
Blending refers to mixing inbound call handling with other work, preferably 
work that an agent can put aside or stop when inbound traffic warrants it. 
Examples include making outbound calls (collections, customer service, and 
telemarketing), answering customer e-mails, and opening regular mail. We 
discuss the various types of call centers in Chapter 1.
Implementing envelope scheduling
A technique that we call envelope scheduling is a great strategy that takes 
advantage of call blending to greatly increase flexibility and maximize sched-
uling efficiencies.
Envelope scheduling is simple. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Go through your normal scheduling process for inbound calls.
 
 We describe this process in “Scheduling Available Resources to Meet 
Caller Demand,” earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Add staff over and above the number necessary to cover the inbound 
demand, creating an envelope (a forecasted number of extra hours) 
by scheduling extra agents.
 
 Add enough agents to give you the additional hours required to do work 
that doesn’t need immediate attention (such as answering e-mails or 
placing outbound calls).
 
3. During periods of low inbound-call volume, switch some agents to this 
“extra” work, which they can set aside to respond to inbound calls.
 
 This practice can generate sales, thereby maximizing cost control and 
occupying staff with productive work other than handling inbound calls.

183
 Chapter 8: Call Center Scheduling: Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3
As Figure 8-10 shows, wherever the envelope staffing line is above the 
required staffing line on the chart, you switch agents over to other work.
 
Figure 8-10: 
Envelope 
scheduling.
 
 
Using a combination of envelope scheduling and blending can reduce your 
overall cost per call by as much as 25 percent.
Extending overtime
Strategic use of overtime can help you respond to gaps in your staffing, espe-
cially during the transition between shifts. You can either extend the shifts of 
those agents who are already on the phones or ask agents who are scheduled 
for later in the day to come in early.
Allowing early leave, late start, or extended lunch
During times of lower-than-expected volume, if you give your staff the oppor-
tunity, they frequently sign up for time off without pay. You can also offer 
extended lunch breaks. All these options reduce staff on the phones during 
slower periods and thus increase the occupancy of the remaining staff. These 
measures can have a significant effect on cost per call.
Engaging an overflow partner
Having an overflow partner — another call center to which you can send 
calls when your call demand exceeds your staffing levels — can help you 
handle peaks and valleys in call volume. The overflow partner can be a third-
party outsourcer (see Chapter 5) that specializes in this type of relationship 

184
Part II: The Master Plan: Finance, Analysis, and Resource Management 
or another call center within your own organization. In addition to providing 
quick access to additional staffing, the overflow partner can provide after-
hours support (when your call center might be closed) or can take calls for 
your center in the event of a disaster (fire, a cut cable, and so on).
Scheduling for multiple-site call centers
If your company runs more than one call center, scheduling may be more 
complex. You can make your life (or your scheduler’s life) much easier, how-
ever, if you appropriately organize your call flow — the kind and number of 
various groups of calls that particular groups of agents or call center sites 
receive.
If you treat each call center as an island (getting its own call volumes from its 
own customer base or a subset of the overall customer base), you can sched-
ule each center independently, as though it were the only call center in your 
operation.
Frequently, multiple-site call centers are on the same network, so they 
work together just like one large center. Calls from your customer base are 
directed to the first available agent, wherever he or she is sitting. It doesn’t 
matter whether the centers are separated by a few hundred feet, several 
thousand miles, or even an ocean: You can treat them as one call center for 
scheduling purposes.

cience-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke once said, “Any 
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable 
from magic.”
Part III helps demystify the apparent magic that makes the 
call center machine hum. In this part, we review call cen-
ter technologies — including basic requirements and valu-
able enhancements — in layperson’s terms. We explain 
why you shouldn’t implement technology unless it can 
advance the business causes of the call center.
In this part, we also cover the technology you need to set 
up a home agent program, highlight the benefits of such a 
program, and provide criteria to consider if you’re think-
ing about implementing a home agent program.

T
he machinery that helps manufacture great customer experiences in the 
call center has evolved tremendously since the cord boards that opera-
tors used in the 1950s. For many years, the phone system alone was the hub 
of customer communication.
Although the phone system is still in use, it’s no longer alone. Modern tech-
nology is so fundamental to today’s call centers that you have to know how 
to use it properly. Good operations blend people, processes, and technology 
in effective solutions that maximize efficiency, revenue generation, and cus-
tomer satisfaction.
In this chapter, we explore some of the modern technology tools that can 
help you run your call center more effectively.
Seeing What Technology 
Does for Call Centers
Broadly speaking, technology does three things for your call center:
 
✓ It gives your customers a way to communicate with your company.
 
✓ It allows the call center to more readily collect, access, and edit informa-
tion about customers.
 
✓ It provides a means for reporting on activity in your call center.

188
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
Call center technology is becoming increasingly integrated, making for 
improved processes that lead to increases in efficiency, revenue generation, 
and customer satisfaction.
Call centers themselves are a response to the demand for convenience in 
a world that continues to move quickly. Consumers don’t have the time 
or desire to go to the market square to make every purchase or to receive 
services. Technology enables a company to meet customers’ “any time, any-
where” expectations, and it’s the foundation on which call centers are built.
Figure 9-1 shows the basic layout of a typical call center network, illustrating 
many of the pieces of technology that we talk about in this chapter.

 Chapter 9: An Introduction to Call Center Technology
Using Telecommunications 
Technology in the Call Center
The first piece of technology that you need must provide a means of getting 
customer calls to your call center. For the most part, call centers use the 
public telephone network — something that’s such an integral part of the 
modern world that people don’t give it much thought. Customers just pick up 
their phones and dial a number to connect to your operation.
Like most call center operations, yours probably uses toll-free 800 numbers. 
Your customer dials a number that has an area code starting with 8, and 
even though the call center might be thousands of miles away, he doesn’t 
pay long-distance charges. (The bill goes to the call center rather than the 
customer.)
On the other side of the coin are call centers that use phone numbers start-
ing with 9 — usually, 976. For these calls, the customer does pay . . . some-
times, a lot!
Today’s telephone and Internet networks provide your call center valuable 
opportunities and services, including the following:
 
✓ Automatic number identification (ANI)
 
✓ Dialed number identification service (DNIS)
 
✓ Dynamic network routing
 
✓ Automatic call distributor (ACD)
 
✓ Predictive dialing
 
✓ Interactive voice response (IVR), including speech recognition
 
✓ Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
 
✓ Hosted call center applications
 
✓ Web tools
We discuss all these topics in the following sections.
Automatic number identification
Automatic number identification (ANI) is a service that transmits the custom-
er’s telephone number and delivers it to your call center’s telephone system. 

190
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
You can use this information to identify the customer and look up her 
account information before an agent even says hello, maybe giving the caller 
special treatment. (Your best customers might be routed to an elite group of 
agents, for example.) Special routing allows you to boost customer satisfac-
tion and revenue per customer. We talk more about routing in the section 
“Taking advantage of ACD’s capabilities,” later in this chapter.
On your home phone, you see ANI in action if you subscribe to a Caller ID ser-
vice. The number of an incoming call appears on your phone’s display, allow-
ing you to decide, for example, whether the caller is important enough to 
interrupt the 12-hour Star Trek marathon you’re watching on TV. (Maybe it’s 
the dry cleaner, calling to let you know that your Klingon costume is ready 
for pickup. You wouldn’t want to miss that call!)
Call centers might use ANI to pull up a caller’s account information so that an 
agent can be ready to handle the customer’s inquiry. Having this information 
might shave only a few seconds off average call length, but you can get tre-
mendous savings compounded over thousands of calls.
Dialed number identification service
Because your call center probably has several 800 numbers, depending on 
the various services or products that the company offers, you need to know 
which of those numbers the customer called. Through dialed number identi-
fication service (DNIS), the telephone network provides the number that the 
customer dialed, which tells the telephone system how to route the caller.
Dynamic network routing
Dynamic network routing is a service that goes by several names, but the 
basic concept remains the same. Some call centers have a computer terminal 
that’s connected directly to the telephone company’s switching office. This 
computer allows such a center to control the routing of customer calls at net-
work level, before they even hit the call center’s telephone system.
When call volumes peak beyond a level that your call center can service, for 
example, dynamic network routing can redirect calls to other centers with 
which you have overflow agreements. (We talk about overflow agreements in 
Chapter 8.) You can route calls based on various criteria, such as a predeter-
mined percentage of calls allocated to each office. Also, because the routing 
occurs in the telephone network, the routing appears to customers to be 
seamless.

191
 Chapter 9: An Introduction to Call Center Technology
 
Dynamic network routing also enables you to provide an announcement to 
callers and route their calls depending on their responses. You might greet 
customers with the message “Press 1 for English or 2 for Spanish,” for exam-
ple, and then use the responses to route the calls to English- or Spanish-
speaking agents.
Automatic call distributor
You might consider this service to be the heart of the call center. When cus-
tomer calls arrive, they’re delivered to the automatic call distributor (ACD) 
system — a specialized phone system designed for call centers. Unlike a reg-
ular phone system, an ACD system doesn’t route calls to a specific phone set; 
instead, it routes a large volume of incoming calls to a pool of waiting agents. 
Call center operators figured out years ago that they could achieve great effi-
ciency by lining up incoming calls when they arrive and then distributing the 
longest-waiting calls to available agents. (Imagine the alternative: thousands 
of customers calling individual agents’ extensions.) An ACD system simply 
connects the longest-waiting caller to the first available agent.
When customers call, they’re greeted by a recorded message, which asks 
them what language they speak (English, Spanish, and so on) and what type 
of service they’re looking for (such as billing or technical support). Based on 
the customers’ responses, their calls are lined up, or queued, to wait for the 
next available agent who can provide that type of service. These queues act 
as waiting rooms of sorts, where callers likely hear a recording similar to this: 
“All of our agents are currently assisting other customers. Please hold, and 
we will be with you shortly.”
Queuing capability is a key part of call center efficiency. You can create a 
large number of queues within your ACD system and then route calls to vari-
ous subqueues based on services required, language preference, and so on.
Taking advantage of ACD’s capabilities
ACD has several important capabilities:
 
✓ Delay messaging: A delay message says something like “Thank you for 
calling. All of our operators are currently busy. . . .” Delay messaging 
tells customers that they’ve reached the right place and very effectively 
gets callers to wait briefly. ACD provides multiple messages, which the 
call center can play at any time during a customer’s wait.

192
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
 
 Limit the number and frequency of delay messages that interrupt music 
on hold or recorded information. Otherwise, those “Your business is 
important to us” messages can become a nuisance and may drive cus-
tomers to hang up quickly.
 
✓ Music on hold: This feature plays music between delay messages. The 
main objective of music on hold is to encourage customers to wait for 
the next agent.
 
✓ Skills-based routing: As a variation on routing to queues, most ACD sys-
tems can route to skills instead. As the name suggests, skills-based rout-
ing matches each caller’s needs with the agent who has the best skill set 
(of those available at the moment) to service those needs.
 
 The first step in skills-based routing is establishing a skill set for all 
agents. Next, you must attempt to identify the skill requirements of call-
ers, which you can do in several ways, including these:
 
• Using a DNIS service.
 
• Collecting caller information through telephone prompts, such as 
“Press 1 for English . . .”
 
• Looking up the caller’s phone number by using ANI and searching 
your customer database to pick up some important information 
about the caller. ANI might determine that a caller is one of your 
best customers, for example, and skills-based routing can send the 
caller to one of your best agents.
 
 Skills-based routing doesn’t eliminate queues, but it changes the agent 
queue dynamically for each caller.
 
✓ Reporting: ACD systems provide a great deal of reporting capability, 
both historical and real-time:
 
• Real-time: Real-time ACD reporting tells you everything that you 
need to know about current call center performance, such as how 
many callers are waiting to be served, how many agents are staff-
ing the phones, and how long it’s taking agents to process calls, 
as well as how many customers hung up and how quickly they 
hung up.
 
• Historical: You can view ACD information that spans a certain 
period so that you can revise your staffing plan for the next day, 
week, or year.
Gathering reports from ACD
The ACD component of your telephone system provides the basis of your 
reporting requirements. All activity starts with a customer call, and the ACD 
system tracks the volume, timing, and effort associated with accepting each 
phone call. The system can summarize and present this information in a vari-
ety of time frames, including by interval (time of day), day, week, or month.

193
 Chapter 9: An Introduction to Call Center Technology
You can collect reports on three general areas:
 
✓ Agent performance: ACD agent performance reports, such as the 
example shown in Figure 9-2, provide statistics about each individual 
agent, such as how long she took to service calls, how many calls she 
answered, when she logged in, and how long she was logged in. (We talk 
more about measuring agent performance in Chapters 6 and 13.)
 
✓ Queue performance: Queue performance reports can tell you how many 
people called, how quickly agents answered the phones, how many cus-
tomers hung up, how long agents took to service the average call, how 
many agents were logged into the system at a particular time, and so on.
 
✓ Trunk performance: Telephone lines are frequently referred to as 
trunks, and trunk performance reports provide information about the 
telephone lines that deliver customers to the ACD system. You can use 
this information to make decisions such as when to add more telephone 
lines.
 
 Trunk performance reports provide information about the use of each 
line and the amount of time that all lines were busy (raising the potential 
that callers received busy signals). They also provide information about 
the average time that each line was in use.

Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
Unlike at a local bank branch, in a call center, you can’t physically see the 
customers being served or waiting for service, but you can still get a very 
clear picture of what your callers are experiencing. From the ACD reports, 
you can determine whether your customers are waiting a long time or 
whether your agents aren’t busy enough. With good information from your 
ACD reports, you can take action to correct any imbalances, such as adding 
staff to help waiting customers or moving agents to other work when you’re 
overstaffed. (We talk about scheduling in detail in Chapter 8.)
 
ACD manufacturers have made it very easy to transfer historical data across 
the local area network (LAN) and into a data warehouse. (We talk about LANs 
in the section “Connecting agents to the local area network,” later in this chap-
ter.) After the ACD data enters the warehouse, you can mix it with information 
from other systems to generate some very powerful information for your man-
agement team, as we describe in Chapter 6.
Predictive dialing
A predictive dialer is a device that allows you to manage outbound calls — 
calls originating from your call center. Companies that place large numbers 
of outbound calls, such as collections bureaus and telemarketing agencies, 
often use predictive dialers.
This technology can increase agent productivity by 300 percent or more over 
manual dialing in several ways:
 
✓ It places the outbound calls, leaving agents free to perform other tasks.
 
✓ It weeds out answering machines, busy signals, and other nonhuman 
interactions before delivering live calls to agents.
 
✓ It reduces agents’ wait time between live calls.
The call center can control how aggressive the predictive dialer is in dialing 
customers. If you want to keep your agents very busy, you make the dialer 
dial quickly. Fast dialing comes at a cost, however. In some cases, the dialer 
can dial so quickly that no agent is available for a customer to talk to. (That’s 
why you sometimes hear a long delay in a telemarketing call before an agent 
speaks.)
 
Predictive dialing can lead to customer irritation when it’s used irresponsibly, 
such as calling at unacceptable times of day.

 Chapter 9: An Introduction to Call Center Technology
Managing customer lists
A predictive dialer simply dials a list of phone numbers that you’ve loaded 
into its database. This list generally includes customers’ names, some perti-
nent information about them, and (of course) their phone numbers.
 
You need to manage your customer list effectively if your call center does 
outbound calling. To maximize the effectiveness of each list, you must clean 
(or scrub) the list to remove incomplete phone numbers or numbers that the 
dialer has determined are fax machines or out-of-service phone lines.
 
Also scrub lists based on other information you may have about a customer’s 
interest in the product or service that you’re offering. You might call some 
of your existing customers who are now eligible for a great new product, for 
example. By scrubbing customers who probably don’t want a product that 
you’re promoting, you can increase the quality or effectiveness of your list 
and make more sales over the life of the list. As a result, you make dialing 
more effective.
Respecting do-not-call laws
Most countries have laws that regulate call center practices (see Chapter 1), 
generally dealing with telephone sales, the use of predictive dialers, and pri-
vacy. The United States and Canada have implemented do-not-call laws, which 
require call centers to scrub their telemarketing lists against government-
provided do-not-call lists. By checking every list against both government 
lists and your own internal do-not-call list, you can be sure that you aren’t 
calling customers who prefer not to be called for any offer.
Do-not-call lists are positive for call centers in that they provide a cost-
effective way of improving lists by removing customers who don’t want to 
talk to you — which ultimately improves dialing effectiveness.
 
Take do-not-call lists seriously! If you use predictive dialing and don’t scrub 
against the do-not-call list, you could be violating the law thousands of times 
per day. The fine is as much as $11,000 per violation, so it doesn’t take long for 
fines to add up to a lot of money. The governing bodies mean business; if you 
violate the law, you’ll be paying. Using predictive dialing without scrubbing 
your call list also comes with hidden costs, from wasted agent time to nega-
tive effects on your company’s image and brand.
Creating reports from predictive dialing
Like ACD systems (which we talk about in the section “Automatic call dis-
tributor,” earlier in this chapter), a predictive dialer reports on agent produc-
tivity, office productivity, and trunk performance. The dialer reports on the 
results of each conversation, including sales per hour, refusals, reasons for 

196
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
refusals, and how many answering and fax machines the dialer encountered. 
Because the dialer dials more customers than it has agents to handle, you 
occasionally run into situations in which agents aren’t available when the 
customer answers the phone. The dialer needs to be able to report on how 
many customers had to wait for an agent and how many customers hung up 
while waiting.
Interactive voice response
Interactive voice response (IVR) involves using automation — automated 
voice prompts and, sometimes, synthesized speech — to provide service to 
customers.
Think of an IVR system as being like a robotic agent. You encounter IVR 
yourself whenever you call your bank’s automated account-lookup system to 
determine your account balance; the system reads your account balance in a 
computerized voice.
IVR is very cost-effective. The cost of a service provided by IVR can be less 
than one fifth the cost of providing the same service by using a live agent. 
Also, IVR systems generally provide faster and more convenient service. 
Rarely does a customer have to wait for the “next available agent.” Because 
IVR is virtually always available, it’s there whenever the customer is, 24 hours 
a day.
You should see very fast payback on investing in IVR — in significantly less 
than a year. You can measure the benefit in terms of inquiries and requests 
that live agents don’t have to handle. Calls that don’t make it to call center 
agents reduce the total calls and the cost of servicing customers.
 
Here are some simple keys to IVR success:
 
✓ Provide a quick out. Give callers who don’t want to use IVR a quick way 
out by allowing them to press 0 at any time to get an agent.
 
✓ Keep it short and sweet. The IVR script should be up-tempo, clear, and 
to the point. Humans can interpret speech much faster than 100 words 
per minute, yet most IVR systems are paced slower than this, so callers 
get bored and opt for the quick out. Formalities aren’t necessary. Callers 
know that they’re listening to a machine, so keep the script polite, but 
don’t bother with a lot of extra pleasantries.
 
✓ Follow the three-by-three rule. Try to avoid offering more than three 
options at a time, and don’t make callers drill more than three options 

197
 Chapter 9: An Introduction to Call Center Technology
deep into the IVR script. If you break this rule, you may find that cus-
tomers begin to drop out of your IVR service, opting to speak with a live 
agent.
Speech recognition
Traditional IVR systems ask customers to press a key on their telephone 
keypad to select an option; this keypress identifies why they’re calling and 
directs them to the right place in the IVR system or to a live agent. With 
speech-recognition software, however, the IVR system can understand 
human-language commands. Speech recognition can range from simple (“If 
you’d like to reach sales, say sales”) to sophisticated (“Please state the name 
of the party you are looking for”). In the latter example, the system would 
look up the name and provide the phone number.
Both traditional and speech-recognition IVR systems give customers the 
chance to get answers to commonly asked questions, get account informa-
tion, or complete transactions. The benefit to your customers is that they 
have access to your company around the clock. The benefit to your call 
center and company is that removing simple requests quickly saves money.
Speech-recognition software has become more accurate at understanding 
what a caller says, but it’s far from perfect. This software can frustrate cus-
tomers when it doesn’t accurately understand what they’re saying, leading to 
a significant number of misdirected calls, which adds costs to your bottom 
line. Keep the design of your IVR menu simple (no more than three levels; see 
the tip in the preceding section), test it on your own employees first, and fix 
what’s not working before you allow customers to use it.
Investigating speech analytics
The ability of a computer to understand what 
humans are saying has opened a new field of 
study called speech analytics. Speech analyt-
ics allows you to search recorded calls over a 
period of time (today, a month, and so on) for 
specific words or phrases, or even for the tone 
of the customer. Identifying trends in customer 
requests, issues with products, and reasons for 
customer calls can help you solve costly prob-
lems and, ultimately, resolve the reasons that 
the customers needed to call you.
Speech analytics also allows a computer to 
search and group recorded calls in a specific 
category (such as sales calls). By listening to 
these calls, you can identify why products are 
popular and spot missed selling opportunities. 
Instead of scratching your head and wonder-
ing why your sales are down, now you can use 
technology to target and analyze specific calls. 
All these capabilities allow you to bring more 
revenue and a better customer experience to 
your company.

IVR reports
The IVR system provides reports about calls received, the options that cus-
tomers selected, the length of time customers spent using IVR services, and 
the time when customers used those services.
Figure 9-3 shows an IVR report for a customer-opinion-survey application. 
The report shows how many calls the call center received, the average call 
length during each half-hour interval of the day, and IVR selections made by 
the customers who completed the survey. The detail in the IVR report can 
tell you about the success of the applications that the system is running.

Voice over Internet Protocol
The abbreviation of this system’s name doesn’t mean “hello” in an alien lan-
guage. Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP (pronounced voyp), is the name 
of a communications technology that changes the meaning of the phrase 
telephone call by transmitting speech over a computer network. Just as many 
people have switched their home phone service to high-speed VoIP access, 
companies also use VoIP. Unlike consumers, however, businesses have VoIP 
options that can improve the quality and reliability of call center services.
Potential benefits of VoIP
VoIP service offers several benefits to call centers:
 
✓ Cost savings: Because VoIP allows you to carry all calls through your 
computer network and out over the Internet, you don’t need expensive 
phone lines (also called trunk lines). If you support international calls 
into your call center, you can avert per-minute costs (but still incur 800-
number charges for domestic callers). Also, the point-and-click admin-
istration of VoIP saves you money on maintenance and management 
charges.

199
 Chapter 9: An Introduction to Call Center Technology
 
✓ Multiple-site capability: VoIP has enabled call centers of all sizes to 
employ home agents (see Chapter 11) and integrate mobile workers. 
(The fellow in the plumbing aisle at Home Depot can now offer support 
to professional plumbers when they call from their clients’ basements 
for help!) VoIP also can enhance multiple-site coordination, routing calls 
between two or more call centers and balancing call volumes.
 
✓ Benefits for the rest of the company: This technology includes some 
very cool features and applications that can help improve productivity 
and solve challenges throughout your business. You can use VoIP to 
seamlessly connect physical offices with mobile workers, such as techni-
cians or salespeople, for a low cost.
 
✓ Energy savings: On top of the financial and customer benefits of VoIP, 
the move to home agents reduces your call center’s carbon footprint, 
which is good for the planet.
Potential drawbacks of VoIP
Despite what VoIP can do for a call center, deciding whether your call center 
should use it isn’t a no-brainer. You need to consider the following potential 
problems:
 
✓ Effect on current systems: You and the person in charge of information 
technology need to discuss the effect of VoIP on your current phone, 
computer, and network systems.
 
✓ Cost: The cost of implementing a VoIP system might require you to ana-
lyze the benefits (see the preceding section) to determine whether the 
implementation would be worth the price.
 
✓ Physical vulnerability: VoIP requires electricity, so a power outage 
knocks it out of service. Also, because calls are transmitted over the 
Internet, the sound quality may vary.
 
✓ Security vulnerability: VoIP introduces a new kind of security challenge 
because (like a Web site) your network can be hacked by intruders if 
you don’t protect it properly.
Make sure that you do your homework, understand the issues, have service-
level agreements in place with your VoIP provider, and establish a Plan B for 
use in case problems arise.

or VoIP Deployment For Dummies, by Stephen P. Olejniczak (both from Wiley 
Publishing).

Hosted call center applications
You can actually have call center technology tools hosted at another location 
and maintained by another company instead of buying and installing them 
in your company’s computer room. In essence, you can rent technology and 
access it remotely (by using the Internet, for example).
Hosted technology tools, which you may hear called Software as a Service 
(SaaS) or application service providers (ASPs), have several attractive benefits:
 
✓ Low up-front costs: Instead of buying an expensive tool, you can rent it, 
which means that you can be up and running more quickly. You can also 
decide to buy the tool later, after you try it out.
 
✓ Low maintenance costs: Maintaining hardware and software requires 
upgrades and patches, so you need a person at your company who 
knows how to support the tools. If you use a hosted tool, you don’t have 
to worry about these costs.
 
✓ Redundancy: Hosted-system suppliers usually have multiple servers in 
multiple locations that include backup generators to ensure availability.
 
✓ Flexibility: Hosting has given small and midsize call centers access to 
tools that only large call centers could afford before. You can rent what 
you need today and add new tools or grow the number of agents or loca-
tions in the future.
No matter what capability you want technology to deliver to your call center, 
you probably have an option to host instead of buy. A few of the most popu-
lar hosted applications are
 
✓ Hosted IVR: You can easily route calls to different locations, based on 
area code or time of day, for example. If your customers mainly want to 
look up account balances, or if you want to use enhanced speech recog-
nition (covered in the section “Speech recognition,” earlier in this chap-
ter), you might want to use a hosted IVR system.
 
✓ Home agents: Technology-enabled hosting allows you to have agents 
working remotely from their homes. We cover this topic in detail in 
Chapter 11.
 
✓ Support and management tools: Whether you want better scheduling, 
call recording, reporting, or customer-satisfaction surveying tools, 
your call center can rent them.
 
✓ Call center in a box: Some applications offer an all-in-one solution for 
a call center. You may want to use this approach if you’re just starting 
an operation or want to expand your call center slowly.
 
Hosted applications also have drawbacks. You need to understand exactly 
what you’re buying, as well as the risks that come with the new setup and the 

201
 Chapter 9: An Introduction to Call Center Technology
company that offers the hosted application. Be sure to build a service-level 
agreement that guards against risks, both now and in the future.
Web tools
Several tools can help you support customers through the Web. If your com-
pany has an online Web presence, it may offer a self-service system in which 
customers can find answers to their questions. Offering this kind of Web 
support can make life easier for your customers and reduce your company’s 
costs of providing service, but keep these factors in mind:
 
✓ Delayed versus real-time responses: Handling e-mail (to which the 
customer might expect a response within 24 hours) is very different 
from handling real-time chat (in which the customer expects a response 
now!). A good example of real-time Web-based response is the Call Me 
button that businesses place on their Web sites. After a customer enters 
his phone number on the Web page, this information immediately routes 
to the call center, and the system initiates a phone call back to the cus-
tomer with a live agent ready to answer that customer’s question.
 
✓ New processes and skills: Handling e-mail, text messaging, and real-
time online chat is very different work from talking to customers on the 
phone. Don’t assume that your processes, training, or even current staff 
can deliver just because you installed a new technology.
 
✓ Customer support in a social-media world: Blogs, product forums, 
YouTube, and Facebook (to name just a few media) allow people to pub-
lish information and ideas online easily. In this environment, customers 
can express whatever they want about your company (or your products 
or services) in a very public way.
Web tools allow customers to interact with one another to solve problems 
and answer questions, and if they can’t get the help they need from the 
online community, they can submit a request for someone in your call center 
to resolve the issue. (See how to connect your agents to your online presence 
in the section “Connecting agents to the local area network,” later in this 
chapter.) You can also use these tools to give customers information about 
what your business offers.
 
When your company declares the need to reduce costs by pushing some cus-
tomer calls to self-service (such as to the Web or an IVR system), establish a 
strategic plan so that you know what this change means for your call center. 
When your marketing team decides to move aggressively toward new online 
and social-media marketing, you should have a plan that outlines the effect 
on your call center. Usually, the easy part of putting customer support on the 
Web is installing the technology; the hard part is preparing your agents and 
changing your processes.

202
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
Getting Information to Agents
The two most important devices for call center agents are the phone and the 
computer. The phone routes a call from the customer’s house, cellphone, or 
office to one of your skilled agents. Without phones, you obviously wouldn’t 
have much of a call center. Without computers, agents can’t easily (or 
quickly) respond to customer questions, retrieve information, and complete 
customers’ requests.
In the following sections, we discuss these and other tools that give your 
agents access to information.
Giving agents the tools they need
Recruiters and trainers can put a very skilled and motivated person on the 
phone. But after the call is routed to him, that agent needs the best possible 
tools and resources to provide quick and accurate customer service. Today’s 
networked computer systems are the means by which your agents access 
these capabilities, which include (at minimum)
 
✓ Customer accounts
 
✓ Product and service information and prices
More sophisticated environments also include access to the following:
 
✓ Company knowledge bases, including problem-solving guidelines, poli-
cies, and procedures
 
✓ Controlled Internet access (meaning limited or no access to certain 
areas of the Web, such as offensive sites) so that agents can research 
and respond to customers
 
✓ Call guides and scripts, sometimes including dynamic scripts that cus-
tomize call-handling recommendations based on customer characteris-
tics and preferences
 
✓ A personal performance dashboard, which provides agents critical infor-
mation about their job performance
 
✓ Communication tools that allow agents to contact other departments, 
peers, and members of management
 
✓ Software to respond to e-mails or handle online chat
Make each workstation very neat and relatively spacious. The computer 
should use an industry-standard operating system (such as Microsoft 
Windows) that includes a graphical interface so that the agent can navigate 
easily by using a mouse or keyboard.

203
 Chapter 9: An Introduction to Call Center Technology
 
The more easily agents can access anything that they need to serve callers — 
including account information, troubleshooting tips, call strategies, and phone 
services — the more successful they can be on every call.
Providing specialized call 
center applications
The world is full of packaged workstation tools and applications, many of 
which were built especially for the call center industry or even for specialties 
within that industry. Following are a few examples of specialized call center 
applications:
 
✓ Contact management software: Tracks customer contacts, reasons why 
customers are calling, and how issues were resolved; also books any 
follow-up actions that may be required
 
✓ Help-desk software: Records, tracks, and allows for the analysis of sup-
port requests within an organization
 
✓ Knowledge-management software: Provides call center agents a ques-
tion-and-answer path that leads to a solution for a customer request or 
problem
There’s no tool like an old tool
Not long ago, Réal was working with a call 
center for a travel agency. Call length had 
always been long, but it was getting longer; 
as a result, costs were out of control, custom-
ers were becoming dissatisfied, and manage-
ment was becoming concerned. Réal quickly 
determined that the number-one reason for the 
long calls was that agents needed to call other 
travel companies to book travel packages. In 
some cases, his client’s agents were waiting 
40 minutes or more to get through to the other 
company’s agents.
Réal and his client set about to find an online 
travel-reservations system that would allow 
agents to bypass the other company’s call 
center. After more than a week of research, 
Réal described what he was trying to find to 
one of his client’s agents. This agent knew 
what Réal was talking about immediately — 
an application called Vacations Online, which 
allows a company to deal directly with all of its 
suppliers’ data. As it turned out, the client even 
had Vacations Online but simply hadn’t imple-
mented it because the person who purchased 
it had left the company some time ago.
To make a long story not so long, the client 
immediately began using the software and 
chopped more than 100 seconds off its average 
call length. We probably don’t need to tell you 
the financial effect of this reduction (but in case 
we do, see Chapter 6).

204
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
 
✓ Sales and marketing software: Helps call center agents maximize their 
sales efforts by providing product and pricing information, as well as 
by cross-selling (suggesting new products based on customers’ past pur-
chases) and upselling (suggesting related products or services in addi-
tion to the original purchase) while talking with customers
 
✓ Billing and order system: Gives agents access to your company’s 
customer-account information and the tools that they need to process a 
customer request
 
✓ Reservations system: Provides industry-specific tools that agents may 
require, such as travel-industry tools for booking flights
Connecting agents to the 
local area network
A local area network (LAN) is an internal network that delivers online ser-
vices across the organization to anyone who has a computer. You can con-
nect services such as customer billing systems to the LAN, making those 
services readily available to anyone on the network without dramatically 
changing the look and feel of the billing system.
Examples of other services that you can connect to a LAN include
 
✓ Fax and imaging servers
 
✓ E-mail and chat servers
 
✓ Scheduling software
We discuss these services in the following sections.
Fax and imaging servers
In the past, whenever a customer needed to fax information to the call center, 
the fax arrived at a local machine and went into an agent’s inbox. Then the 
agent would process the fax and file it. The process created a lot of potential 
problems, because faxes could be misplaced or misfiled, and creating them 
wasted a tremendous amount of resources.
 
Installing a fax server on the LAN can prevent these problems. When custom-
ers need to fax your call center, the faxes are stored electronically on your fax 
server, and agents can easily retrieve faxes from their workstations with no 
worries about filing. This process can save a significant amount of time and 
reduce errors.

205
 Chapter 9: An Introduction to Call Center Technology
This same server can store images (that’s the imaging server part), giving you 
the ability to scan any document and store it electronically. Your agents have 
network access to the stored documents through their workstations. If a cus-
tomer writes a letter or sends documentation regarding warranty claims, for 
example, an agent can scan, store, and retrieve the documents when they’re 
needed.
E-mail and chat servers
Increasingly, customers want to contact call centers electronically, such as 
via e-mail and online chat. In a call center, the e-mail and chat server routes 
electronic customer communications to agent workstations and manages the 
contacts in an organized fashion, much the same way that an ACD system 
manages phone calls (refer to the section “Automatic call distributor,” earlier 
in this chapter).
The system coordinates which agent receives the next contact in a large pool 
of customer contacts and collects statistics on how quickly an agent handled 
the customer’s request. The system also allows you to build and reuse tem-
plates to answer common customer questions quickly and consistently.
Scheduling software
Workforce management software can do all your scheduling work for you. 
(We talk about scheduling in Chapter 8.) This software forecasts call volume 
and length, determines staffing requirements, creates and organizes work 
schedules, automates shift bids, and tracks where your employees should be.
Today’s scheduling and workforce management systems are integrated into 
the call center’s computer network, making it possible for the system to 
share data with other systems and for users anywhere in the center to take 
advantage of its capabilities. The systems can also provide other services, 
such as quality control, agent-performance management, payroll, and 
reporting.
 
Probably the biggest benefit of workforce management software is its ability 
to keep track of all the thousands of bits of information required to prepare a 
call center schedule.
Generating Reports
Routing calls to your center (see “Using Telecommunications Technology in 
the Call Center,” earlier in this chapter) starts the process of providing ser-
vice to your customers. Keeping a well-designed set of tools and information 

206
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
at agents’ fingertips (discussed in “Getting Information to Agents,” earlier in 
this chapter) helps ensure that you’re providing that service with a decent 
level of efficiency and accuracy. If you don’t have reporting capability, how-
ever, you can’t figure out how good you are, whether you’re improving, or 
whether you’re actually getting worse.
 
To be effective, reporting must be timely, complete, and accurate — all a lot 
easier said than done, but good reporting systems are worth the great deal of 
time and diligence required to build them. Call center systems put out many 
kinds of reports that provide vital feedback on business measures, making 
continuous improvement possible. Check your management reports to ensure 
that you’re making fact-based decisions about your operations and how you 
service your customers.
Using multiple systems to generate reports
Your call center can get reports from the following systems:
 
✓ ACD (discussed in “Automatic call distributor,” earlier in this chapter)
 
✓ Predictive dialer (which we talk about in “Predictive dialing,” earlier in 
this chapter)
 
✓ IVR (check out “Interactive voice response,” earlier in this chapter)
 
✓ Scheduling (flip back to Chapter 8 for the lowdown)
 
✓ Workstation applications (dive into these applications in “Giving agents 
the tools they need,” earlier in this chapter)
Not enough data for you? You can also conduct surveys with customers and 
get data from your order management system (as well as your e-mail and 
chat server) to help you understand your call center’s interactions with 
customers.
 
Other systems can provide useful reporting data. The payroll system, for 
example, can provide information on the number of hours for which the com-
pany paid your agents and the cost of paying these agents for their time.
Pulling the data together
These systems provide a lot of reports containing huge volumes of data. By 
themselves, they give you bits of information but don’t paint the complete 
picture. In fact, looking at one piece of information without the benefit of other 

207
 Chapter 9: An Introduction to Call Center Technology
data can be very misleading. An agent who has very high call length, for exam-
ple, may appear to be unproductive until you realize that the same agent has 
the highest level of sales and customer satisfaction in the company.
Combining data from the various systems can create meaningful information 
about your drivers and business performance. But don’t get carried away. 
Your goal isn’t to create a ton of metrics and reports; it’s to obtain clear and 
actionable information.
The process of combining data manually is labor-intensive, slow, and not 
very sophisticated. (In some call centers, pulling reports together amounts 
to printing out daily results from a variety of systems and then retyping this 
data in a formatted spreadsheet.) Many call centers have made dramatic 
strides in their reporting capability by automating the collection of reporting 
data through the creation of a data warehouse attached to the LAN. The data 
warehouse performs automated processes called routines — often during 
off hours for the call center — that place data in prepared reporting tem-
plates. The reporting team checks to ensure that the reporting data has been 
entered correctly before sharing that data for use in the operation. In addi-
tion to saving time (because no one has to print reports and type the infor-
mation into other reports), consolidating the data allows managers to create 
a complete picture of how the call center is operating.
These kinds of reports can actually improve results instead of simply report-
ing on them. The less time team leaders have to spend preparing perfor-
mance reports, the more time they can use the reports to coach their agents.
 
Being able to report with this level of detail, speed, and accuracy helps a call 
center manage processes and key performance drivers. The adage “If you 
can’t measure it, you can’t manage it” proves to be very true in the call center 
industry.

A
s part of a strategy of continuous improvement, call centers are always 
looking at cool new technologies that may provide improvements in 
their business practices. Okay, maybe those technologies aren’t all that cool, 
but they definitely make things work better!
In this chapter, we provide some examples of technological enhancements.
Integrating Phones and Computers
Computer–telephony integration (CTI) refers to a system of hardware and soft-
ware that allows for communication between the telephone system and the 
computer system. With this communication, you can instruct these systems 
to work together to produce some interesting and powerful applications.
CTI is kind of like call center superglue. After years of using it, we’re still 
amazed by the magic that this technology can perform in a call center; it’s 
ideally suited for creativity and continuous improvement.

210
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
In the following sections, we describe a few common CTI applications.
 
With a good CTI team, management can use this technology to improve cus-
tomer service and create efficiencies in the call center.
Screen pops
One popular CTI application is the screen pop, in which the phone system col-
lects the caller’s telephone number — either through automatic number iden-
tification (ANI) or interactive voice response (IVR), both of which we discuss 
in Chapter 9 — and passes this information to the CTI system, which looks 
up the customer’s information in the database. When it finds a customer 
account, the CTI system coordinates with the telephone system to send the 
call and the customer information simultaneously to an agent’s telephone 
and workstation. The agent doesn’t have to look up the account; it arrives on 
his computer screen at the same time that the call arrives on his telephone.
Our experience has shown that the screen pop saves 10 to 15 seconds in 
average call length, and this time savings directly reduces the cost of running 
a call center.
Mandatory data entry
You can use CTI to require agents to enter critical data before they take the 
next call. Are you frustrated, for example, that some agents forget to ask the 
customer what prompted her to call? Make completing the Reason for Calling 
field a mandatory task before the agent can move on to another call.
Soft-phone functionality
A soft-phone application houses an agent’s telephone on his computer, which 
gives the agent easy access to a phone function by using that computer’s 
mouse. Agents no longer need physical phones on their desks; all the tools 
they need are now housed on their computers.
Using a software-based telephone increases the amount of information that 
the call center leadership team can collect about how an agent uses her time. 
Whenever an agent leaves her desk, the soft-phone application can prompt 
her to account for her time. She might make an entry such as Lunch Break 
when she’s away for 30 minutes, for example.

Enhanced reporting
The CTI system tracks a customer call from cradle to grave — from the 
moment that the telephone system recognizes a customer call through the 
call’s entire life cycle in the call center. The CTI system knows how long a 
customer waited for service, what he selected in the IVR system, his phone 
number, which agent he spoke to, what actions the agent took by using com-
pany applications, whether the agent transferred the customer, and to whom 
the customer was transferred.
This incredibly rich source of information makes for very detailed reporting 
and analysis. You can report not only on call length, but also on how long an 
agent spent using each part of the company’s applications.
Idle-time training
CTI can monitor how busy the call center’s phones are at any point in time. 
When it identifies a lull in caller demand, it can route training information to 
idle agents. Better still, it can identify individual agent weaknesses and route 
the most appropriate training materials to each agent. You get customized 
agent training with no loss in agent utilization. That’s what we call a killer app!
Coordinated screen transfer
This function enables an agent to transfer customer data on his computer 
screen to another agent’s or team leader’s computer. This way, customers 
don’t have to repeat their names and account information after the transfer. 
This type of information transfer not only saves time, but also represents 
good customer service.
Call routing
You can use CTI to control the routing of calls to agents, essentially taking 
this function away from the automatic call distributor (ACD). You can use 
CTI to control call routing and gain the added benefit of CTI’s sophisticated 
logic in making routing decisions. When a customer calls, CTI may look up 
the customer’s account history, her preferences and likely behavior, and her 
selections in the IVR system before deciding which agent to route the call to 
and what information to present to the agent.
 
See Chapter 9 for more information on ACD and IVR.

212
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
Dynamic scripting
After it routes the caller to an agent, CTI may prompt the agent with a cus-
tomized script or call-handling approach to serve the specific customer. In 
doing so, CTI refers to a customer’s analytics database, which predicts the 
customer’s preferences and suggests the most appropriate call-handling 
strategy.
Call blending
Call blending occurs when CTI switches agents among different types of work 
at any time. The system might blend an agent between inbound customer 
service calls and outbound collections, for example. CTI can control this pro-
cess by monitoring inbound caller demand and dynamically moving agents 
between inbound and outbound calling.
Call blending greatly increases the efficiency of inbound call handling and 
gives you an effective way to move occupancy closer to optimal levels. (We 
discuss optimal occupancy in Chapter 8.)
Web-enabled call centers
As we discuss in Chapter 1, call centers are increasingly being called con-
tact centers because companies have added multimedia contact methods 
to inbound and outbound telephone calls. Other methods of contact can be 
woven into the call center through CTI integration and blending. In these 
cases, the CTI system routes other forms of contact (such as e-mail, online 
chat, and scanned letters) to agents who possess the skills needed to handle 
these methods of contact.
Again, the CTI system controls the routing of these contacts. CTI can also 
blend these other forms of contact with inbound calls, creating more call-
blending efficiencies. Presto! Your call center just became a contact center.
Warehousing Data to Track 
Agent Performance
Many call centers have agent performance data in various computer systems. 
Your phone system has all the productivity numbers, such as average handle 
time and the number of calls taken in a day. Your order-taking system or your 
customer relationship management system has the number of sales or orders 

213
Chapter 10: Technological Enhancements: Getting the Newest and Coolest Stuff
that an agent has taken or perhaps the number of complaints or problems 
that he has resolved.
To get an overall view of agent and team performance, many call centers 
move data from different systems into a central database called a data ware-
house. This data can be organized so that team leaders can access it for any 
interval (daily, weekly, monthly, the year to date, and so on). Also, the data 
warehouse presents the same information about all agents, which allows 
team leaders to do some analysis by comparing agents on their teams and in 
their departments.
 
You want to collect data on performance drivers and report on individual 
agent performance relative to these drivers so that you can target improve-
ments in operational effectiveness to meet the business goals and mission. 
Without a tool to summarize all the reporting information and report on 
individual agent performance, it’s virtually impossible to produce consistent, 
timely, and reliable reports.
Monitoring Quality
Most call centers randomly listen to, record, and grade agent telephone calls 
by using call-recording software.
Most call centers can benefit from using an automated call-monitoring system 
and integrating it into their local area networks. Such a system automatically 
captures complete agent phone calls, recording both the voice conversation 
and a video picture of how the agent navigates screens within the computer 
system while she solves the customer’s issue. To review agent calls, team 
leaders simply log into the system from their workstations, retrieve sample 
calls for the agents they want to evaluate, and begin scoring. This software 
application has many benefits:
 
✓ Team leaders don’t need to wait for a call to come in. A team leader 
can go to a library of recorded calls, choose one randomly, listen to it, 
and evaluate it. Then the team leader can attach comments to the call 
and show those comments to the agent. This feature increases team 
leaders’ personal productivity.
 
✓ The agent and team leader can stop the call’s recording at any point to 
discuss it. In the coaching session, they can talk about what the agent did 
well and whether he might do something differently in the future. You can 
find more information on specific coaching best practices in Chapter 13.
 
✓ A team leader can target specific agent challenges such as high call 
length, low customer opinion, poor sales, or high returns. The team 
leader can look for the root cause of a particular challenge by sitting 
side by side with the agent, as well as by listening to calls through a call-
monitoring system.

214
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
 
✓ The agent can listen independently. Then she can complete a self-
assessment of the quality of the call.
 
✓ The team leader can gather great calls. He can add these calls to a 
library that demonstrates best practices, which any agent can listen to.
 
✓ The team leader and the agent can evaluate the agent’s use of the 
call center’s computer systems. Because the software also records the 
agent’s computer screen during the call, the team leader and agent can 
determine whether the agent used the most efficient navigation path.
 
Many agents perform perfectly during a side-by-side evaluation with their 
team leaders, but when the team leaders listen to calls remotely through a 
call-monitoring system, the agents don’t give the same high-quality perfor-
mance. This difference in performance can occur for a variety of reasons, 
including lack of motivation or lack of practice.
If you want to use a call-monitoring system, keep these points in mind:
 
✓ You have options. You can find hosted services, for example, if your 
center can’t afford the expense of this type of technology. If you use a 
hosted service, your call center doesn’t have to buy the technology out-
right; instead, it pays the technology company for what it uses.
 
✓ You must determine how much to record. Because housing all 
recorded calls can be costly, many companies record a percentage of 
total daily calls. If you work for a financial institution’s call center, how-
ever, specific regulatory and risk-mitigation requirements force you to 
record all calls. Even if you don’t work for a financial institution, not 
recording calls means that you don’t have as many agent calls to evalu-
ate. You have to weigh this need against the cost factor of storage.
Using Customer Relationship 
Management Technology
Customer relationship management (CRM) is a business term that refers to the 
process of relating to your customers in a way that allows you to maximize the 
length and value of that customer relationship. It involves collecting and analyz-
ing data to better understand your customers’ needs and wants. It also includes 
creating customized strategies to address unique customer needs. The whole 
point of CRM is to get new customers, keep the customers you have, and maxi-
mize the value of the relationships you have with those customers.

215
Chapter 10: Technological Enhancements: Getting the Newest and Coolest Stuff
Putting CRM to work
You can gain benefits from CRM by using a diverse range of technologies. 
You don’t have to use overly complex or uncommon technology, though, 
especially in the beginning of your implementation. CRM technology tends to 
involve three components:
 
✓ Data collection, management, and analysis
 
✓ Creation of business rules
 
✓ Onscreen presentation of the correct data to agents
Companies collect data about their customers from a variety of sources, 
including legacy customer information and billing systems, call center cus-
tomer contact systems, Web-based contact information, and all other points 
of contact where the company can collect customer information. Marketing 
and sales use this information to build the CRM database, which is stored in 
the data warehouse. The call center uses a subset of this database, accessing 
specific customer data.
Marketing uses the data warehouse to analyze customer information and 
anticipate your customers’ needs and intentions. A bank, for example, could 
determine from analyzing the data warehouse that if a customer is in his 
early thirties and renting his home, the bank should offer him a mortgage. 
Therefore, if this type of customer contacts the call center, the CRM applica-
tion may suggest to the agent that she offer this customer a mortgage.
CRM applications have many functions, such as searching for customers; 
updating customer information; merging duplicate accounts so that the data-
base is up to date; linking one customer to another within the same family; 
accessing a customer’s call history, purchases, and preferences for products 
and services; tracking the status of a current inquiry or complaint; and taking 
orders for products and services. All points of contact from the customer 
(e-mail, online chat, phone, and so on) access the same CRM application.
 
You can use your CRM application to produce a daily list of the customers 
who are most likely to stop using your products. This evaluation allows you to 
make a service call to these customers to see whether you can do anything to 
enhance their use of your product or service. This proactive initiative greatly 
reduces customer cancellation rates and keeps those customers actively con-
nected to your company.

216
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
Developing a CRM strategy
In our opinion, CRM is first and foremost a strategy, not just a technology. 
The core of this strategy involves how you want to treat your customers, 
what you want to get from your customer relationships, and what you plan to 
give customers in return. All parts of the organization should coordinate in 
the execution of your CRM strategy, from marketing to call center operations.
The execution of the CRM strategy includes three components: people, pro-
cess, and technology. You can easily purchase technology in the hope that it 
can solve your problems and achieve your strategic goals, but even with the 
best technology, the people in the call center need to see the value in pursu-
ing the CRM strategy.
Call center agents, who for a long time have been concerned primarily with 
call length and keeping the customer happy, must come to believe that col-
lecting customer information and offering each customer new products and 
services — that is, selling to customers — helps the company, the customer, 
and the agent.
Changing old behaviors may take some time. Call center managers need to 
believe that the extra time agents take to collect data is worth the investment 
in longer call length and increased cost per call, and senior managers need to 
give the call center time to adapt.
 
The CRM process doesn’t spring to life overnight. Companies may spend mil-
lions of dollars on CRM applications, training, and consulting, and they reap 
the benefits of CRM only many years later. It takes time, trial, and error for all 
the components to come together in a successful and profitable solution.
The technology component of call center CRM addresses handling each cus-
tomer contact. What does your customer data tell you about a customer’s 
needs and preferences? How should you handle her? Does marketing route 
her to the IVR system because her history shows that she typically calls to 
complete a transaction and has a history of refusing your product offers?
After the call reaches an agent, CRM applications give the agent the means to 
access information about the customer (including recommendations developed 
from data analysis) and to collect new information provided by the customer.
Employing a Knowledge Base
Agents live in a world in which new and sometimes confusing information 
comes at them quickly every day. Call center managers expect agents not 
only to know this information, but also to weave it into natural conversations 

217
Chapter 10: Technological Enhancements: Getting the Newest and Coolest Stuff
with customers. Some agents think that they have to memorize all exist-
ing and new information, but they really need to retrieve this information 
quickly, understand it, and respond to the customer without missing a beat.
You can help agents by giving them access to a knowledge base — an orga-
nized library of your company’s products, services, process, and procedures. 
This library includes a search engine that presents options to the agent to 
ensure that he has the right information at his fingertips. Good knowledge 
bases contain images of your products and processes, which can help agents 
understand the information quickly. If you think about the customer experi-
ence and the pressure on the agent to provide the right answer at the right 
time, providing a robust knowledge base that has good search functionality 
can pay dividends not only in customer satisfaction and workplace produc-
tivity, but also in employee satisfaction.
 
You can also help your agents by increasing what we call their think, type, 
and talk proficiency: Think about what the customer is asking, type the right 
request to find the appropriate information, and talk to the customer to 
deliver a response seamlessly. This type of proficiency grows with practice, 
and as we describe in Chapter 13, you can accelerate an agent’s skill only by 
providing that agent coaching at her workstation right after she completes a 
call with a customer.
Surveying Customer Satisfaction
In the section “Monitoring Quality,” earlier in this chapter, we talk about 
quality-monitoring applications. If you use these types of applications, you 
can get some specific benefits in improving the customer experience, but 
you can’t get much information about what the experience felt like to the 
customer. The call center industry spends a lot of time doing calibration 
exercises — meetings in which team leaders spend time with quality ana-
lysts listening to an agent’s call, evaluating it, and determining how the call 
quality compares with those of other calls within a specific group of agents. 
These exercises aim to have less than a 5 percent deviation in the call-quality 
scores of agents in the group.
 
A calibration exercise creates consistency within the group, making sure that 
team leaders and quality analysts understand the specific components of what 
the center thinks makes up a good customer experience. These sessions can 
go awry, however, if the team leader discusses how the agent made the cus-
tomer feel. Only the customer can give that type of feedback (which you can 
get through customer-satisfaction surveys).

218
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
To get this type of customer feedback, many centers implement postcon-
tact surveys. You can get immediate customer feedback by conducting the 
postcontact survey right after the customer’s interaction with an agent. You 
can conduct these surveys in several ways, including using an e-mail–based 
survey with which you reach out to customers to get their rating of the expe-
rience. You can also conduct postcontact surveys through IVR technology. 
(We talk a bit about the many uses of IVR in Chapter 9.) When a customer 
calls a call center that has a postcontact survey set up, an automated voice 
asks the customer whether he wants to participate in a survey. If the cus-
tomer presses the number for Yes, after he speaks to an agent who services 
his request, the IVR system presents a short survey to the customer. (If the 
customer presses the number for No, he’s simply routed to an agent, and the 
call has no follow-up survey.)
If your technology can accrue the results in real time, you can review the 
responses and scores daily, which allows you to recognize when your agents 
do excellent work. If specific agents have consistently poor responses and 
scores, you can prioritize your time to coach these agents first. Real-time 
results let you take action when a call is still fresh in an agent’s mind.
Your quality analysts can look for department-level trends in this data and 
dig into the root cause of your results, whether those results are positive or 
negative. This analysis feeds directly into your continuous improvement pro-
cess, which we talk about in Chapter 15.
Getting Approval for Technology
Okay, you’re a technology genius, and boy, oh boy, have you found some 
technology that’s going to make a big difference in improving your customer 
experience. So what’s next? How do you go about getting approval so that 
you can start saving the call center money?
Our first piece of advice is to keep it simple. The simplest, most appropriate, 
and most effective way to submit a proposal for technology enhancements is 
to prepare a one-page cost–benefit analysis that you can use to create a case 
for change if you need to. You can create this kind of analysis easily, and Réal 
suggests that you follow two specific rules:
 
✓ The analysis must fit easily on one page of 81⁄2- by 11-inch paper.
 
✓ Express your argument for spending money on new technology in one 
minute or less.

219
Chapter 10: Technological Enhancements: Getting the Newest and Coolest Stuff
 
You can most easily meet both of these rules by using the business model that 
we outline in Chapter 2. The model says that all business activities go toward 
the key goals of generating revenue, minimizing cost, or satisfying customers. 
To make the case for new technology, you have to define the benefit of new 
technology in terms of those key business goals.
To make your case for a new technology, you have to show that it can 
affect at least one of the drivers in a manner that substantially adds value 
(increases revenue or reduces cost) to the company, thereby justifying the 
cost of the new technology.

▶ Dealing with the technology
▶ Putting the program in place
▶ Following best practices
▶ Supporting your home agents
I
magine that one of your best agents is moving to the other side of the city. 
She comes into your office to tell you that her commute is more than an 
hour, and she’s thinking of resigning to find a job closer to home. She has a 
young family and doesn’t want to spend two hours a day driving in big-city 
traffic. This scenario repeats itself across North American call centers every 
week.
Or maybe next year’s call volume forecast, based on new programs that your 
organization is planning to roll out, contains both good news and bad news. 
The good news: Sales will be up. The bad news: Your operation is at capacity, 
and you don’t have any room for more desks and people. (You already have 
three agents working next to the coffee machine!)
If you find yourself in one of these situations, consider a home agent pro-
gram. Over the past four years, we’ve helped many of our clients start home 
agent programs. All of them started their programs for different reasons, but 
all of them enjoy many benefits from using these programs.
In this chapter, we discuss why you might want to go the home agent route, 
the key planning issues that you need to consider, and how to go about start-
ing a program.

222
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
Seeing Reasons for a 
Home Agent Program
Also known as virtual agents and at-home agents, home agents (the most com-
monly used industry term) take calls and do their work from their homes; 
they don’t regularly come in to the call center to work. They’re a group of 
agents connected to your systems, customers, and call queues through 
what’s known as a virtual private network (VPN), via the Internet or a sup-
plier that provides this type of platform. (Although we don’t go into the 
details of VPNs in this book, you can find information about them on the 
Internet.) If you execute a VPN well, to your customers, it sounds and per-
forms the same as — or better than — agents in your call center operation.
In the United States, industry studies predict that the number of home agents 
will grow from an estimated 150,000 in 2008 to 330,000 in 2011 — a remark-
able growth rate of more than 35 percent per year. In Canada, according to an 
April 2009 study by Triad Services, Inc., about 25 percent of call centers cur-
rently use home agents, and 50 percent of companies say that they plan to be 
using home agents within two years. The trend looks unstoppable.
The following sections provide a few reasons why companies start home 
agent programs.
Making your business run more efficiently
You probably could use a few extra advantages to make your operations 
more efficient and productive; everyone could! Using home agents is one 
more way to keep improving your business. We’ve identified four key ways 
that home agent programs improve companies’ operations:
 
✓ Smoothing out service-level peaks and valleys
 
✓ Reducing turnover of skilled agents
 
✓ Attracting new talent
 
✓ Reducing costs while the company grows
We discuss those benefits, and others, in the following sections.
Smoothing out service-level peaks and valleys
You may experience variation in your call center’s service level, and you 
need to smooth out those differences, especially if your call center experi-
ences large swings through the course of a single day. (In Chapters 7 and 8, 
we talk about forecasting and scheduling.)

223
 Chapter 11: Using Home Agents
Home agents allow you to switch from a fixed labor pool of 9-to-5ers to a vari-
able labor pool of flex workers whom you can schedule in relatively short 
time blocks and multiple times per day. This scheduling works because home 
agents find the lack of a commute and the freedom to use time between shifts 
for personal activities attractive.
Home agents can quickly sign in when unexpected peaks in call volume 
appear and queues back up. They get extra hours exactly when you have 
extra customers — a perfect win–win scenario. We can’t make you a work-
force expert in this chapter, but moving from fixed schedules to flexible 
schedules is just common sense, right?
 
Be careful about starting with the same scheduling model for home agents 
that you currently use in-house and then trying to make the change to flexible 
short shifts later. Some of your agents might feel betrayed if you shift the rules 
after they decide to work from home. Be honest about setting and managing 
expectations.
Reducing turnover of skilled agents
With employees looking for more flexibility (so that they can achieve that 
coveted work/life balance), home agents give you a viable option in your 
employee retention strategy. Many companies that SwitchGear surveyed 
about why they launched home agent programs mentioned that their 
number-one reason was keeping agents who otherwise might leave, for any 
of several reasons:
 
✓ A family relocation (in the case of an on-the-move military spouse, for 
example) or life change (such as a new baby)
 
✓ Dissatisfaction with a large, stressful operation
 
✓ An expensive and stressful commute
 
✓ Environmental allergies (perfume in the next cubicle causing an allergic 
reaction, for example)
Attracting new talent
You can gain access to new workers outside your labor-pool area (sometimes 
in other cities) by using vendors that specialize in home agent recruiting and 
have access to labor pools in multiple markets.
You can use home agents if you’re recruiting for multilingual agents whom 
you can’t find in your hometown. Small call centers that struggle to compete 
for multilingual talent can find home agents to be particularly helpful.

224
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
Reducing costs while the company grows
While your company grows, you can expand customer service without incur-
ring the additional costs of creating a new bricks-and-mortar work area. By 
using home agents, you can scale up your operations quickly for peak buying 
seasons (such as Christmas), new product and service launches, or major 
campaigns, and you can scale them down again just as quickly. You can 
much more easily increase the hours of a large pool of flexible home agents 
than build more capacity in a building and recruit under duress.
One recent industry study estimates that the fully loaded cost of an agent in a 
bricks-and-mortar operation decreases by 30 percent when that agent works 
from home. (We explain fully loaded costs in Chapter 6.) Another report esti-
mates a similar 30 percent decrease — $21 per hour for home agents, com-
pared with $31 per hour for agents in bricks-and-mortar operations.
You may see an even more dramatic savings if you have an expensive union-
ized environment and can transition over time to less-expensive independent 
workers.
 
This calculation might make your eyes pop: If you can send 20 percent of 
your agents home and save 30 percent on that group, you can improve your 
expense line by 0.2 × 0.3, which equals 0.06, or 6 percent. That’s a big savings 
from one initiative.
Reaping other rewards
Additional benefits reported by our clients that use home agents include
 
✓ Business continuity: Power off in one site doesn’t affect 50 dispersed 
agents in their homes (as long as you have your call center operation’s 
phone switch on a backup power source).
 
✓ Environmental benefits: If you have 1,000 agents commuting for 12 
months about 40 minutes each way twice a day, having them work at 
home could save 125,000 gallons of fuel and emit 170 tons less air pollut-
ants. That kind of environmental consideration will make ice-cap watch-
ers very happy!
 
✓ Lower absenteeism during extreme bad weather: When it snows heav-
ily and in-house agents might not make it to work, your home agents 
can simply walk down their hallways with coffee in hand (and maybe in 
pajamas).
 
 Graham Kingma, vice president of customer service for a television 
shopping channel, had his home agent program in place for 12 months 
when an incredible snowstorm hit the city. As he told us, “It took most 
people more than two hours to get in. I knew it was going to be a very 
challenging day. I made it in after a two-hour drive, and when I saw our 

225
 Chapter 11: Using Home Agents
operations supervisor, I hesitantly asked him how things were going. 
He said, ‘Well . . . we have 21 agents absent for the day.’ I shuddered. He 
then said, ‘The good news is we got 19 home agents to come on, so there 
is no effect on the service levels.’ That’s when I realized all the effort of 
building our home agent program was worthwhile.”
Providing an attractive work 
option for your agents
You can provide two ways for your agents to work from home: They can be 
home-based employees, earning their current pay and benefits, or they can 
work for your company as subcontractors for an outsourcing firm. (We dis-
cuss outsourcing in Chapter 5.)
Your agents might want to work at home for several reasons:
 
✓ They don’t have to commute. Not having to get to work (because they 
work from home) saves many home agents a lot of time and fuel costs.
 
✓ They may enjoy more personal time. Home agents like the integration 
of their work and their personal lives, where pajamas and computers 
can work together.
 
✓ Their workday has more flexibility. Many home agents prefer to work 
three two-hour shifts with an hour in between rather than seven straight 
hours in the call center.
 
✓ They can save money. Home agents have no costs for commuting, and 
they may save on clothing and lunches. If they work as subcontractors, 
they can also enjoy tax write-offs on home-business expenses.
Is working at home perfect for every agent? No. The at-home option works 
best for agents who can handle a relatively isolated work environment that 
provides little face-to-face contact with other people. Also, home agents need 
to be self-directed enough to work on their own without hourly supervision.
 
You may want to create a self-assessment questionnaire to help agents deter-
mine whether working at home suits their personalities and lifestyles. See the 
nearby sidebar “Home agent interview” for a sample questionnaire.

✓ What calls and queues do you plan to send to home agents?
 
✓ Will you use an employee model (run it yourself) or a contractor model 
(use a vendor)? How does this decision support your objectives?
 
✓ What does your organization need to invest to set up a home agent pro-
gram, and when can it achieve a payback?
 
✓ What do you expect to save in costs, and does using home agents fit into 
your overall business goals? (Assume that establishing home agents gives 
you a reduction in agent attrition rates and an increase in productivity.)
 
✓ What risks does this change come with, and how do you plan to deal 
with them? Risks might include upset customers going to the com-
petition, upset employees leaving, decreases in productivity, union 
grievances, or hidden costs of technology or networks. We talk about 
mastering change in Chapter 16.
 
Include facts and data that support the opinions and insights that you offer 
in your recommendation to the executive decision-makers. You may be con-
vinced based on talking to your peers for years, but facts help make the case.
Figuring Out the Technology
Whether you decide to go it alone or use a hosted solution, the following sec-
tions cover various technology considerations that you need to address with 
your technology advisors, which can help you speak their language.
Deciding where to host the network
Your first (and major) choice is whether to set up and run the technology 
yourself (with your tech team) or outsource the network and security to a 
hosted vendor that will deal with the headaches associated with technology.
Hosting the network yourself
Mario Perez, chief executive officer of Telax, a hosted call center solutions 
provider, advises that you use the following criteria to decide whether to 
keep the network in-house. According to Perez, if the following elements are 
in place, you can host and manage the network yourself:
 
✓ A private branch exchange (PBX) that allows you to run a Voice over 
Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone system.
 
✓ A tech team that can manage the remote setup and maintenance of a 
large number of agents. Your team may be able to handle 5 to 8 agents, 
but can it keep pace with 100 agents?

228
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
 
✓ Relatively low security-level needs (see the nearby sidebar “Levels of 
security”) and a security setup capable of protecting you across the 
Internet. You can’t have any high-end security requirements that need 
dedicated data lines or a complex network design that separates voice 
and data.
If you don’t have all those elements in place but your call center has 200 to 
300 seats, your company can afford to invest in new equipment and software 
for hosting its own network.
Using a network provider
According to Perez, you may want to consider using an experienced provider 
to host your network if your call center doesn’t have any one of the elements 
listed in the preceding section. Also, if your call center has fewer than 200 
seats, a hosted solution is probably more cost-effective.
Setting up a network in-house
Figure 11-1 is a simple diagram that shows you how your tech team will set 
up your network. In the figure, PSTN stands for public switched telephone net-
work, which involves good ol’ dial-up phones; ACD stands for automatic call 
distributor; and IVR stands for interactive voice response. (For more informa-
tion on ACD and IVR systems, see Chapter 9.)
Here’s what your tech team needs to set up (and what you need to include as 
costs in your business plan):
 
✓ IP-enabled phones at home: Each phone added requires the equivalent 
capacity at the switch in the call center. The type of PBX and security 
setup existing in your call center may dictate the type of phones your 
agents need.
 
✓ A router in each agent’s home: You can purchase phones that have 
routers included or have a separate router at each location.
 
✓ A computer data line into the house: If the agent already has a broad-
band Internet connection, you don’t need to add this line (but you might 
assume the cost).
 
✓ A dedicated phone line: Unless you’re sending VoIP calls, which would 
travel on the existing broadband data line, each agent needs a dedicated 
phone line.
Calculating installation time
Setting up your home agents can take as little time as 4 weeks or as much 
time as 12 weeks, depending on these factors:

229
 Chapter 11: Using Home Agents
 
✓ Whether the phone vendors are responding quickly to your requests 
and have available inventory of phones, routers, and PBX cards
 
✓ Whether your tech team has the resources to get the job done and 
you’ve finalized the technical requirements
 
✓ Whether the telephone company can provide added bandwidth and 
dedicated lines
 
✓ Whether the back-end PBX switch is IP-ready and requires upgrades to 
card slots or security
 
✓ How far your agents live from a tech team, which dictates how far tech 
teams have to travel to agents’ homes for setup
Protecting your data
Here’s a starter list of security and data protection tasks for your tech team 
to carry out:
 
✓ Remove home agents’ ability to cut and paste data, print confidential 
reports, or copy data to their hard drives.
 
✓ Ensure that home agents have up-to-date operating systems and firewall 
protection for their computers (and that their firewalls are turned on).
 
✓ Install the latest security software, and give enterprise security software 
to all home agents.
 
✓ Set up agents with strong passwords, and train them to lock their com-
puters when they’re away from their desks.
 
✓ Enable remote access for tech support personnel so that they can both 
support and observe agents’ computer behaviors.
 
✓ Allow home agents to see only the last four digits of customers’ credit-
card numbers.
Levels of security
Here’s a summary of security levels:
 ✓ High (most expensive): Dedicated data 
and voice lines that only your data passes 
through
 ✓ Medium: Virtual private network over the 
Internet
 ✓ Low (least expensive): Internet access 
with minimum security standards

 Chapter 11: Using Home Agents
Making home agents secure
With a little bit of thought, you can ensure that working at home doesn’t 
mean more downtime, more data risk, or lower productivity. You can manage 
these risk areas, if you know how:
 
✓ Have each home agent sign in and out by using biometric fingerprint 
scanners to prove that it’s really the agent who’s logged in.
 
✓ Provide home agents technical support whenever they need it to elimi-
nate viruses and fix other computer problems so that those agents can 
keep working (and feel supported).
 
✓ Educate home agents about security risks and how to protect against 
them.
 
✓ Ensure that each home agent knows the most serious compliance guide-
lines — the ones that can lead to dismissal if not followed.
 
✓ Require agents to block or stop all other Internet traffic (games, down-
loads, and so on) while they’re working, because this traffic reduces 
bandwidth and affects the sound quality of a call.
Implementing the Program
After you figure out whether home agents can fit into your call center’s struc-
ture, you can create an operating plan (sort of like a checklist of tasks that 
you must do to get a home agent program going) and determine what type of 
work and leadership support agents may need.
Creating an operating plan
An operating plan follows the principle of the skilled handyman: Measure 
twice, cut once. Do thorough planning so that you can avoid making costly 
mistakes later. You have plenty of issues to consider. Here are a few impor-
tant ones to start with:
 
✓ Business specifications: Your operating plan needs to have a list of busi-
ness specifications that can help support your strategy, including
 
• Types of calls that you route to home agents and optimal periods 
of time during which you schedule home agents
 
• Whether you’re going to build your own program or outsource it 
(see Chapter 5)

232
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
 
• Security measures and what expectations you set for your agents 
with respect to security and privacy
 
• Home agent technical setup
 
• Whether to use proven in-house agents or combine newly hired 
agents and existing agents
 
✓ Selection process for home agents: How can existing agents apply for 
these positions? How do you select candidates?
 
✓ Selection process for team leaders: How do you select the right team 
leader for these home agents? What’s the right ratio of team leaders 
to home agents? How are you going to help your team leaders coach 
remotely?
 
✓ Training: What type of training do you plan to provide to existing 
agents? You might have them trained in troubleshooting simple techni-
cal issues with their computers, for example, which can save you down-
time and money when an agent’s equipment isn’t working.
Planning the work
You have to make the same decision — which calls you want to send to 
home agents and how much ramp-up you need per call type — regardless 
of whether you outsource or manage your own home agent program. Going 
the outsourcer route might involve many new agents who work remotely 
and aren’t experienced in your business. If you’re in pizza delivery, and your 
operation has relatively simple transactions and huge swings in call volume 
(pizza companies see a threefold to sixfold increase in calls starting Friday 
night into the weekend), using home agents makes loads of sense, because 
you can easily train many folks remotely. It’s difficult, however, to train home 
agents to support complex financial products or services.
You might also consider using home agents when you need agents who have 
highly specialized skills, so you have to look in a larger geographic area to 
find and recruit enough quality agents who have that specific skill. Such 
specialized areas include technical support, insurance, travel agency, and 
health care. You may have a longer ramp-up, however, because of complex 
scenarios, the kind of decision-making and judgment required, and the need 
for formal certifications (or very thorough security checks).
Building a management team
Depending on the scale and speed of the growth of your home agent pro-
gram, you need to determine in your operating plan (refer to “Creating an 
operating plan,” earlier in this chapter) whether you need to make the follow-
ing management roles full-time, dedicated, or part-time.

233
 Chapter 11: Using Home Agents
 
Whatever time you think you need, add 50 percent until you test it. During 
planning, people have a tendency to underestimate (a lot!) the actual effort 
required.
The core team includes
 
✓ Team leader: Oversees the home agent program. This person needs 
training in the specifics of remote management — how to monitor, moti-
vate, communicate, coach, and train.
 
✓ Tech-support liaison: Needs great rapport and patience with home 
agents who have technical challenges. (You don’t need this liaison if 
another company looks after your computers and network.)
 
✓ Home agent training specialist: Knows how to deliver training online 
and across virtual networks, and can lead the occasional in-house class.
Explaining the program to your staff
Touch on these key points to help sell the idea of working at home to your 
agents and management team:
 
✓ A flexible workforce is important for success. Both the company’s 
and the call center’s long-term success may depend on home agents as 
part of the mix, for reasons including business continuity and employee 
retention. You can cite the reasons that we discuss in this chapter to 
explain why companies go this route.
 
✓ This is only a test. Let your staff know that you’re starting a pilot only to 
test the concept. You’ll share with the team along the way what’s work-
ing and what’s not working, and together, you’ll keep improving the pro-
gram. (For more details on pilot programs, see the sidebar “Launching a 
pilot home agent program.”)
 
✓ Home agents aren’t going to replace in-house agents. In-house agents 
can become home agents, if necessary, but the company doesn’t plan to 
force anyone to work from home.
 
✓ Managers can expand their skill sets. In our research of home agent pro-
grams, we’ve found that managers who are involved in these programs 
acquire new skills from leading both in-house and at-home agents, and 
many enjoy the new challenges. Those who work with home agents say 
that the program helps them understand how to measure and motivate, 
as well as focus on results, without having the face-to-face advantage.
 
See “Providing an attractive work option for your agents,” earlier in this chap-
ter, for a good benefits list that you can also use in this discussion.

234
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
Selecting and/or recruiting agents
You might hire in-house (select) or from external sources (recruit). If not 
enough internal employees sign up or meet the requirements to work at 
home, you may need to recruit.
When selecting current in-house agents to move into home agent positions, 
use an interview process and a self-assessment to check for the following:
 
✓ Do they have 12 to 18 months on the job and know your products and 
services well? (You may decide to drop this criterion if you have a very 
short training cycle and a simple product line.)
 
✓ Have they had strong, consistent performance evaluations?
 
✓ Are they willing to work part-time shifts and short time-interval shifts? 
Can they work shifts that allow you to have the most flexible workforce?
 
✓ Are they self-motivated, getting the job done without supervision?
 
✓ Do they have better-than-average time-management skills?
 
✓ Do they have sufficient computer skills to handle downloads and com-
puter fixes?
Launching a pilot home agent program
You get many benefits from using a pilot home 
agent program, which reduces risk and helps 
persuade current team members to sign up. 
You can start with, say, six agents working 
from home; test the issues; and get the pio-
neers through a phased transition. Use the pilot 
results to make your business case to the exec-
utive team, other managers, and other agents. 
Here are a few things you can try:
 ✓ Start the agent guinea pigs in-house in 
isolation pods so that they work alone and 
become accustomed to seeking support 
only through the channels they’ll have as 
home agents. Dedicate a team leader to 
manage your home program, giving these 
agents full attention and documenting the 
issues that arise. Run this isolation program 
for one to three months until all six agents 
say, “We’re ready to do this!”
 ✓ Send the six agents home, and repeat the 
pilot. By now, you’ve addressed some of 
the differences caused by isolation, so you 
have to deal with only the new consider-
ations that come from working at home. 
Again, your dedicated team leader docu-
ments and solves new issues when they 
arise. Run this pilot program for three to six 
months.
When you use this slow and steady approach, 
only a small percentage of calls will involve a 
negative customer experience (barking dogs, 
remote systems down, and so on), so you can 
manage your customer risk.

235
 Chapter 11: Using Home Agents
 
Make your interviews behavior-based, asking your potential home agents how 
they’d respond to different scenarios (such as isolation, technical problems, 
or stressful calls).
Setting up the agents at home
We recommend that you consider the following factors when you get agents 
set up to work at home:
 
✓ Employment contracts: Companies provide employment contracts that 
outline technology and Internet use, customer privacy rules, procedures 
for adapting and maintaining the work environment, security, required 
performance levels, and types of shifts. Home agents must understand 
that if they don’t follow some of these guidelines (such as security), they 
may lose their jobs, and other violations (such as preventable back-
ground noise) can lead to your recalling them to work in the call center.
 
✓ Employment guidelines: Develop a consistent set of guidelines, and 
build them into a contract. In union environments in which new con-
tracts aren’t allowed, make it clear that these guidelines don’t qualify 
as contracts but still set the working relationship. Have all home agents 
sign a copy of these guidelines.
 
✓ Technical setup: Take the time to set up each home agent’s work area 
properly. You may want to use an ergonomics checklist to assess the 
safety of each home office.
 
✓ Employee expectations: Set clear expectations, refresh your home 
agents on existing expectations, and make sure that agents know the 
new expectations that working at home impose.
 
✓ Paperwork: Don’t underestimate how long you may have to wait for 20 
to 50 agents to send back accurate paperwork.
Integrating Best Practices 
into the Program
You can follow several best practices to ensure that your program runs suc-
cessfully and that home agents stay motivated and productive. Many of the 
best practices for home agents are similar to best practices for your call 
center. Use the practices that we discuss in the following sections to better 
your chances of managing and growing your home agent program.

236
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
Delivering uniform customer service
Delivering consistent customer service doesn’t change dramatically when 
you use home agents. The same criteria that apply to in-house agents apply 
to home agents; agents have different customer-handling proficiencies, moti-
vations, temperaments, and so on.
Focus on these criteria for success:
 
✓ Select the best-skilled agents who can work independently, know the 
products well, and can navigate the online systems competently. Skill 
and experience are more important for complex operations (such as 
telecommunications or insurance) and less so for operations that handle 
calls such as offering billing information, answering retail shoppers’ 
questions, or taking food-delivery orders.
 
✓ Set clear expectations, and monitor home agents against their results. 
Make sure that the home agents have the same key performance goals 
as your internal agents, and communicate with your home agents often 
if they’re not meeting your expectations.
 
✓ Give home agents ongoing coaching. Put a specific focus on customer-
handling skills, listening skills, and content knowledge (especially on 
the most frequently asked questions). Use a dedicated home agent team 
leader to stay on top of this ongoing coaching. (For more information on 
coaching, see Chapter 13.)
 
✓ Provide subject-matter experts for the same hours that home agents 
work. If you do this, when customers need specialized information, an 
expert is able to provide it quickly.
 
✓ Provide virtual chat rooms. These chat rooms can provide real-time 
agent support and allow home agents to contact managers or senior 
agents about nonurgent issues.
 
✓ Give home agents the authority and training to do the right thing for 
customers. You should also establish this policy in-house.
 
✓ Include home agents in incentives and contests. You want them to feel 
that they’re part of the team and are rewarded the same way.
 
✓ Give home agents the same tools and system stability that you provide 
in-house (if you have good tools and stability in-house, of course).
 
✓ Give home agents regular performance feedback. Make this feedback a 
coaching opportunity.
 
The best service is provided by happy and energetic agents. If home agents 
are happier than they would be as in-house agents, they provide better
 service.

237
 Chapter 11: Using Home Agents
Aligning the workforce and quality teams
For a home agent program to work successfully, you must explain to your call 
center’s support teams what processes will change and what processes will 
stay the same. Quality assurance, which ensures agents’ call consistency and 
obligations, and the workforce team, which schedules the home agents’ work 
hours, play important roles in a home agent program:
 
✓ Quality assurance: Most of our clients who use home agents make no 
big adjustments in their quality-assurance programs, although they may 
listen for background noises such as doorbells and dogs barking. You 
can use the same monitoring process as long as your tech team can pro-
vide remote real-time or recorded-call capability. You use the same ratio 
of quality-assurance staff to home agents as you do for in-house agents. 
You may want to increase the monitoring in the beginning, however, to 
ensure that customer service doesn’t go off the rails.
 
 Make sure that your home agent team leader can take agents through 
their quality-assurance scores, and use those scores as a coaching 
opportunity. Don’t have quality assurance toss scores over the fence to 
the agents (with no feedback loop) and hope that they land softly.
 
✓ Workforce: Smooth workforce scheduling improves vastly if you closely 
match work shifts to customer volumes. If you have very high short-
term intervals — mainly, hourly swings — you can greatly benefit from 
having agents who are willing to work by the hour or (better still) by 
the half hour. Some home agent outsourcers that employ subcontrac-
tors (meaning self-employed home agents) contract those agents for 
30-minute increments and guarantee them a minimum number of hours 
per day. This setup doesn’t work for all companies, but you may want to 
use it if you have high interval swings.
All programs are set up differently, but if you want a highly flexible staffing 
pool, you want many part-timers working very short incremental shifts. Many 
programs have home agents working 10 to 20 hours per week, so you need to 
think about a 3 to 1 ratio when recruiting — that is, you need three part-tim-
ers working 12 to 13 hours per week to cover the same shifts as one full-time 
agent working 35 to 40 hours per week in-house.
 
If you don’t achieve maximum scheduling flexibility, in which staffing matches 
your call volume spikes, you might ask why you’re using home agents. Make 
sure that your home agents are willing to work more variable shifts as a trade-
off for working from home.

238
Part III: Making Life Better with Technology 
Helping Agents Deal with In-House 
and At-Home Differences
To set up a successful home agent program, you need to ensure that agents 
who move from in-house to at-home work don’t lose productivity or can’t 
focus on delivering great service. Home agents sometimes have trouble tran-
sitioning because they feel isolated working at home, don’t feel that they’re 
part of the company, and don’t have in-person supervision. The following sec-
tions look at some strategies you can use to remedy these kinds of problems.
Training
If you rely on a virtual training model, plan to add 15 percent to 25 percent 
more training time. Without face-to-face contact, people can find it more dif-
ficult to quickly grasp what they’re being told, and instructors can’t easily 
watch those people navigate the online systems.
If you’re providing online training, do you already have the content devel-
oped? Preparing this content can take a long time if you have to start from 
scratch. If the training team takes four weeks to train in a classroom, you 
have to manage a lot of content and transpose that content online. Part of 
your operating plan (which we talk about in “Creating an operating plan,” ear-
lier in this chapter) should include your training strategy and the people who 
will implement that strategy.
Isolation
The home option works best for agents who can handle a relatively isolated 
work environment because interactions occur via phone, chat, and e-mail. 
The following practices can help you keep home agents from feeling isolated:
 
✓ Allow home agents to chat online or blog to create a community of home 
agents who experience similar issues.
 
✓ Include home agents in all the contests, annual parties, and awards in 
your call center.
 
✓ So that they can connect to your company culture and to coworkers, 
allow home agents to visit the call center whenever they want. (Some 
companies even require home agents to work on-site at regular inter-
vals — typically, two times per month.) If your home agents visit your 
call center each month, they feel that they belong to the company, they 
can bond with the support teams, and they can meet their team leaders 
for some one-on-one coaching.

239
 Chapter 11: Using Home Agents
 
 Set up some temporary workstations, and create well-structured sched-
ules for each visit. Make these visits worth the home agents’ while; they 
didn’t drive across town (or from another town) for a group hug. Plan to 
help them hone their skills, connect with others, and leave their visits 
inspired (not tired).
 
✓ Have a home agent team leader, if possible. Home agents understand the 
needs, wants, and challenges of being a home agent better than anyone 
else.
Provide a dedicated support system
When Arlene King and Ian Cruickshank from 
TELUS started their home agent program, they 
tried different operating models to determine 
what would work best for their agents and 
front-line managers. Home agent feedback 
quickly revealed that those agents had differ-
ent support needs from in-house agents. Team 
leaders needed to develop new skills and pro-
cesses to enable them to better support the 
unique needs of home agents.
King and Cruickshank switched direction, 
consolidating all their virtual teams into teams 
comprised mostly of home agents. From their 
existing pool of managers, they selected those 
who best demonstrated the ability to work with 
virtual call center employees to lead the home 
agent teams. Those managers were specially 
trained in the unique processes, communica-
tion, recognition, and coaching tools for man-
aging home agents.
This team system generated very positive 
results. The home agents improved their cus-
tomer service and productivity results, and they 
felt happier and more engaged in their jobs. The 
managers could provide a broader range of 
coaching, training, and process support to their 
home agents in these specialized teams than in 
the previously blended teams.

E
very agent is a miniature version of your call center. Each efficiency 
achieved or sale made, or each customer gained or lost, by an agent 
directly affects the overall productivity, revenue, and customer satisfaction 
of the entire operation. Moreover, variation in performance among agents 
highlights opportunities for improvement in both agents and processes. All 
too frequently, however, call centers don’t manage agent performance well or 
don’t do it at all.
After you build a high-performing team (we discuss call center roles in 
Chapter 3) and understand the basic principles of optimizing performance 
(see Chapter 14), you can use a simple process to manage your agents’ per-
formance in a way that improves results for your operation.
Recognizing the Key Components 
of Optimal Performance
In virtually any human endeavor, the three primary components that contrib-
ute to success are skill, motivation, and opportunity. Only when your agents 
can optimize all three factors can you maximize call center performance and 
results.

244
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
Here’s a brief overview of these important components:
 
✓ Skill: Skill is ability or aptitude to do the job. It includes what the agents 
bring to the party and what you provide them after they arrive.
 
✓ Motivation: Motivation is behavior that directs agents toward a goal. 
What your company does to arouse, maintain, and direct agents’ motiva-
tion also affects agents’ performance.
 
✓ Opportunity: No matter how skilled or motivated your agents are, they 
can’t find success without opportunity, and they can’t control opportu-
nity on their own. The environment that you put your agents in shapes 
their opportunities. Tools, marketing, company policies, work pro-
cesses, competition, media, economy, customers, and scope for growth 
within your organization all affect opportunity.
 
 Generally, all agents have the same level of opportunity. You can do a 
lot of things to increase opportunity for your agents, however, such as 
improving tools like customer relationship management applications 
(see Chapter 10), improving your product, and improving work pro-
cesses and company policies.
Think about how these elements of performance relate to professional ath-
letes, who need a certain level of skill and an appropriate amount of motiva-
tion. The best players tend to have a natural, inherent desire to succeed. But 
athletes can’t play if they don’t have an opportunity. Without fans buying 
tickets, no games are played — and no games means no opportunity to show 
off all that skill and motivation.
 
Managing agent performance involves managing agents’ skills and motivation 
in an effective and ongoing manner. If you manage agent performance well, 
skill and motivation improve continually. If you manage poorly, at best noth-
ing happens; at worst agents become disenchanted.
Managing Employee Performance 
in Five Simple Steps
Managing agent performance boils down to following these five steps:
 
1. Hire the right people.
 
2. Tell them what to do and why.

245
 Chapter 12: Hiring and Training
 
3. Show them how to do it.
 
4. Give them feedback on how they’re doing.
 
5. Make supporting them your number-one mission.
We cover the first three steps in this chapter; Chapter 13 talks about the final 
two steps.
Recruiting the Right People
Hiring the right people to work in your call center is very important. Perhaps 
you’re thinking, “In a call center, who’s the right person? Someone who can 
speak?” But if you hire a person who isn’t a good fit, especially from a skill 
and motivation standpoint, your call center’s performance suffers. We dis-
cuss the skill and motivation aspects of recruiting in the following sections.
Evaluating skill
Testing for skill is the easy part. You can take many approaches to evaluate 
skill level, several of which we discuss in the following sections.
Résumés and interviews
You can’t find a better predictor of future success than past success. If can-
didates have done well in the past on jobs similar to the one you’re consider-
ing them for, they’re seemingly ideal candidates. Making this determination 
is easier said than done, however. To ensure that you can weed out those 
candidates who might have exaggerated past successes, use these behavioral 
questions to determine just how well they did:
 
✓ What steps did you use to perform a relevant activity?
 
✓ What challenges did you face when you had to deal with a new aspect of 
your work?
 
✓ What results did your former employer measure you on? Which mea-
sures did you excel in, and which did you struggle with?
 
✓ What are some of the techniques you used when you were performing 
your job function? What did you say to be successful? What techniques 
did you try that weren’t successful, so that you stopped using them?

246
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
 
✓ What do you do first when you have an upset customer on the phone? 
What do you do next?
 
When interviewing potential call center agents, you may want to consider 
doing the first interview over the phone. A phone interview gives you an excel-
lent opportunity to see how the candidate sounds and handles himself in a 
live-call situation. Tell the candidate that you want to record the interview, 
and be sure to ask for permission first.
Reference checks
Reference checks are becoming more difficult to do, because previous 
employers may face legal liability if they give a bad reference and the can-
didate doesn’t get the job. Also, candidates never give you references from 
places that fired them, so you have to read between the lines. If a former 
employer is gushing and enthusiastic, she’s likely sincere. If she mumbles, 
refuses to answer direct questions, and makes vague statements, she may be 
trying to avoid a lawsuit.
Here’s some key information to get from a candidate’s former employer:
 
✓ Confirm the candidate’s employment record, dates of work, position and 
title held, and so on.
 
✓ Describe your job, and ask whether the former employer feels that the 
candidate may be suitable for it.
 
✓ Find out what the candidate did exceptionally well and what he would 
require some coaching to improve.
 
✓ Ask whether the former employer would rehire the candidate if given 
the chance.
Aptitude tests
If you can’t predict a candidate’s likelihood of success in the job by look-
ing at her résumé, interviewing her, and checking references, you can use 
employment testing. Online testing and case studies (including sample calls) 
are becoming the industry standards. You generally offer these tests after 
screening a potential employee but before offering a formal interview.
Here are some of the tests that we find most valuable in determining a candi-
date’s fitness for the job:
 
✓ Customer service aptitude testing: Indicates whether the candidate 
can handle different customers’ styles, emotions, and issues in a profes-
sional, calm, and empathetic manner.

247
 Chapter 12: Hiring and Training
 
✓ Sales aptitude testing: Indicates whether the candidate has the aptitude 
and listening skills to diagnose customer problems and offer solutions 
that can make money for your company. Sales aptitude includes confi-
dence and assertiveness, as well as a positive attitude about selling.
 
✓ Computer skills testing: Indicates whether the candidate has the ana-
lytical and logical skills to use multiple systems.
 
✓ Call center aptitude testing: Indicates whether the candidate can sit in 
one place for an extended period and handle the routines and repetitive-
ness of the position successfully.
You can find these tests by contacting recruiting agencies or searching the 
Internet.
Make sure that your human resources team has thoroughly validated a test 
to prove that it accurately predicts success on the job. Using a test that 
hasn’t been validated may expose your organization to lawsuits filed by 
people who feel discriminated against.
Reducing recruiting time through technology
If you run a call center that has a large number 
of employees, you’re probably recruiting new 
agents continually to keep up with staff turn-
over. Some large call centers use interactive 
voice response (IVR; see Chapter 9) to manage 
large volumes of applicants so that a limited 
recruiting staff can focus on the personal-
interviews stage.
When a call center uses this method, interested 
job applicants simply call a toll-free number. 
Typically, the IVR system asks the applicant to 
enter a telephone number and other identifying 
information for potential callback by recruit-
ers. Then the system gives the applicant a brief 
introduction to the business; lists available 
positions; and interviews the caller about his 
education, qualifications, and other job require-
ments. At the end of the automated interview, 
the applicant receives a reference number, and 
the call ends.
The IVR system uses the data collected to 
create reports that your recruiters can search 
or filter based on their preferred criteria. You 
can select only those candidates who have 
customer service experience or a certain edu-
cation level, for example, thereby eliminating 
those who don’t qualify for a live interview. This 
system reduces the number of live interviews 
conducted and allows your recruiting team to 
focus on those applicants who are qualified for 
the job.

248
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
 
Do your own in-house validation to see which methods work best for your call 
center’s needs. You could collect data about agent performance, for example, 
and then compare your employees’ success on the job with their employment 
test results to see whether your employment tests accurately predicted abil-
ity. You probably have a math whiz in your office who remembers how to do 
correlation analysis; if you want to be really precise, let him have at it, and see 
what he uncovers. He could amaze you!
Evaluating motivation
Predicting skills and aptitude (the ability to develop skills) is fairly easy, but 
you also need to understand a candidate’s motivation, which can be much 
more difficult.
You can uncover some of this information at the interview and reference-
check stages, assuming that the candidate’s previous job was call center–
related. Did she like her previous job? How was his attendance? Did she 
advance? Why did he leave?
If the candidate’s never done a call center job, have her listen to some 
calls — maybe for a few hours. Ask the candidate specific questions, such as 
these:
 
✓ What do you think of the job?
 
✓ Does it interest you?
 
✓ Can you see yourself being in this role for five years?
 
✓ How would this job help you achieve your life goals?
 
Levels of interest and motivation in past jobs give you a good indicator of 
future motivation in the new job.
In the same way that skills testing tells you whether a candidate can do the 
job, motivational assessment indicates whether he will do the job. Some form 
of motivational testing helps supplement interviews and reference checks. 
You can build a motivational analysis into the skills test, or you can give a 
separate test for each of the factors. Either way, a motivational analysis can 
greatly enhance your hiring success. Go online and search for job motiva-
tional tests to get a look at your options, or ask your human resources depart-
ment for recommendations on motivational testing.

249
 Chapter 12: Hiring and Training
 
Frequently categorized as personality profiles, good tests include a mecha-
nism for detecting any attempt to manipulate the test.
Integrate whatever testing you do into your overall recruiting plan or model. 
(Figure 12-1 illustrates a sample recruiting process, including all the points 
at which you can weed out a candidate.) Also, assess your recruiting process 
against your employees’ success on the job from time to time. If you aren’t 
getting consistent results, you need to change the process.

Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
Setting Agent Expectations
One of the primary reasons why people don’t succeed on the job is that no 
one told them what to do, let alone provided specific, clear expectations. 
Make your expectations for agents clear on their first day of work. Agents 
need to know what they have to achieve to keep the job and what they need 
to do to excel. In this section, we provide pointers on setting expectations for 
your agents.
Setting performance goals
Most experienced leaders agree that at minimum, you need to make per-
formance expectations specific, measurable or observable, and realistic. 
Typically, call centers have no problem setting specific and measurable 
expectations; making expectations realistic is more of a challenge.
Frequently, call centers set expectations at the level where management 
wants to see performance, rather than what’s achievable but a challenging 
stretch for the majority of agents. If you set expectations unrealistically high, 
agents either ignore them or become frustrated and demotivated in attempt-
ing to achieve them. If you set expectations unrealistically low, agents may 
ignore them because those expectations aren’t challenging. In both cases, the 
expectations fail to motivate employees.
A minimum expectation gives clear direction to your staff on the minimum 
they need to achieve. Because the expectation is based on the average per-
formance of the group, minus an acceptable percentage near that average 
range, most employees will eventually achieve it without too much concern. 
Perhaps 15 percent to 20 percent of your staff will be conscious of the mini-
mum expectation at any time.
Establishing bonuses
To really motivate your agents and promote continuous improvement, con-
sider setting a bonus level of performance.
Set the bonus level the same way that you set minimum expectations, except 
that for the bonus level of performance, you calculate the group average 
performance and add one standard deviation. At any time, approximately 
13 percent of your staff will achieve this bonus-level expectation, making the 
expectation realistic. Some employees will perform just below this bonus 
level, and because they’re close to achieving the bonus, they’ll feel motivated 
to do just a little better. This motivation results in improvement for both the 
individual agents and the group as a whole, pushing up average performance, 
the minimum expectation, and the bonus-level expectation.

251
 Chapter 12: Hiring and Training
 
When you set minimum and bonus goals by team each quarter, you create 
gentle pressure on the entire organization to improve. Periodically, you need 
to change the goals to reflect improvements in process and agent 
performance.
Doing the math on agent performance
 
To create agent expectations that are specific, measurable, and realistic, 
you can use the historical performance of the agent group. Use one standard 
deviation from the average performance of the group to set the minimum, as 
illustrated by the control chart in Figure 12-2.
 
Figure 12-2: 
Tracking 
call length 
on a control 
chart.
 
A control chart sets high and low expectations, and maps where each agent 
falls in comparison to those expectations. In the preceding figure, the mini-
mum expectation is set at approximately 603 seconds — one standard devia-
tion above the team average of 589 seconds. The bonus target for call length 
is approximately 575 seconds — one standard deviation below the average. 
So 87 percent of your staff will achieve this minimum. You can target those 
who don’t achieve the minimum for extra help.
For more information on standard deviations, control charts, and other 
topics that are beyond the scope of this book, see Statistics For Dummies, by 
Deborah Rumsey (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Balancing your expectations
If you concentrate your expectations on any one measure, you get what you 
ask for — great results in that one measure, perhaps to the detriment of 
other areas of performance. You need to take a balanced approach to setting 
expectations.

252
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
 
In compiling agent performance data for a rock-and-roll call center (where 
people called to answer trivia questions), management noticed that no one 
measure told the complete story about which agents were contributing more 
than the others, as the following examples show:
 
✓ John had the lowest call length, but when management combined this 
measure with other measures, he came out fourth in the overall ranking. 
He should focus on improving his first-call resolution. Maybe he tries to 
get through calls too quickly.
 
✓ Mary made the most sales, but her average revenue per sale needed 
some improvement.
 
✓ Peter was the highest-performing agent because he had a high customer-
opinion rating and high average revenue per sale. Even though he had 
a longer call length than the others, his overall contribution translated 
into the highest overall performance index.
Consider the measures that you want to weigh in your call center’s overall 
performance index to reflect their importance to the call center and the 
company.
Giving specific directions
When you tell your agents specifically what you expect of them, you’re ahead 
of the game. When you tell them why, you’re adding an extra level of motiva-
tional turbocharging that can kick-start continuous improvement.
Here are two good reasons you can give your agents for achieving their mini-
mum expectations and stretch goals:
Every call’s a sales call
In Chapter 2, we mention that improvement in 
your call center’s revenue generation can have 
a greater effect on results than improvements 
in cost-control measures. In large call centers, 
small improvements in retention rate (main-
taining customers who call to cancel service) 
can represent hundreds of thousands — or 
even millions — of dollars in saved revenue. 
Similarly, small improvements in selling and 
upselling (see Chapter 6) can represent hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars or more.
Because every interaction with a customer 
gives you a chance to enhance your business 
relationship, you need to set the expectation 
that agents will treat every call as an opportu-
nity to increase revenue, now or in the future.

253
 Chapter 12: Hiring and Training
 
✓ “Our department will meet its goals if we pull together.” Too often, the 
front line is left out of the big picture. Most people want to be part of a 
successful team. What’s more, people want to know that their depart-
ment and company are doing well and that their jobs are secure. Sharing 
department goals, how they work, and how individual results contribute 
to the overall goals can empower and motivate your agents.
 
✓ “I’ll reward you.” Raises, bonuses, commendations, or opportunities for 
advancement — whatever the reward structure is, you need to tie it to 
agents’ achieving their objectives.
Providing Appropriate Training
After you hire very motivated and skilled people, and tell them exactly 
what you expect of them, don’t stop there. If you do, you’ll have some very 
frustrated high-performing people. (We wouldn’t be alone in a room with a 
group of them.) Next, you have to show people how to perform the jobs that 
you’re asking them to do. Many companies train, but not all of them train in a 
manner that shows people how to excel at what’s expected of them.
You can find plenty of material on effective training. Online searches can give 
you many good options to explore. In the following sections, we focus on a 
few basic rules.
 
Make sure that you target training to your agents’ job performance goals by 
asking these questions:
 
✓ How can this training help agents meet and excel at their job 
expectations?
 
✓ How can this training help agents get ahead in their skills and 
knowledge?
 
✓ How can this training help agents help the company?
Keeping the training simple
Research shows that shortly after training ends, trainees forget a very high 
percentage of the information that was delivered during training — maybe as 
high as 85 percent.
 
You have to stop fighting for retention of information and focus instead on a 
few critical things that you can get agents to remember, such as how to get a 
raise and what to avoid doing if they want to keep their jobs.

254
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
Also, focus on the development of critical skills for the job, such as how to 
use the database (which houses thousands of pieces of information that can 
help agents do their jobs well) and how to handle calls.
Focusing on a few critical policies, call-handling skills (call control, customer 
service, sales, and difficult situations), and knowledge tools can take your 
agents a long way toward getting the skills they need.
Covering the basics
Your call center’s training should cover these key components:
 
✓ Individual goals and expectations: Provide a recap of what’s expected 
of your agents, how their goals affect the department and the company, 
and how the training can help them achieve their call center goals.
 
✓ Key policies and procedures: Provide the critical information that 
agents need to know, and tell them how they can access information on 
policies and procedures in the future.
 
✓ Product knowledge: Make sure that agents know what products or ser-
vices they’re supporting and how to look up information about those 
products or services. (Agents who work in the call center of a major 
retailer, for example, probably can’t remember details about all 53,239 
products that the company sells, so they need to know how to access 
the relevant information.)
 
✓ Call handling: Demonstrate the skills that agents really need to do the 
job, and have them practice those skills. Agents can’t achieve mastery in 
the training class, but good skill development in key areas can help them 
through difficult situations — especially during the challenging first few 
days or weeks on the job.
 
 Call-handling skills include
 
• Call control
 
• Defusing anger and dealing with difficult situations
 
• Customer service
 
• Sales strategies
 
 
Also make information and tutorials on call handling accessible to 
agents through department systems.
 
✓ System navigation: Show your agents how to navigate all the various 
systems that they need to do their jobs. (See Chapter 9 for examples and 
explanations of the call center technology that agents may use.)

255
 Chapter 12: Hiring and Training
 
 Systems in today’s call centers are becoming increasingly integrated 
and user-friendly. Still, some operations continue to have a hodgepodge 
of older and newer systems. In these environments, agents may find 
remembering all the codes, toggles, back doors, and tricks to be very 
tough. New agents need a tutorial to help them along.
Keeping the training short
The sooner you get your agents on the phones, the sooner they can start 
developing the seeds that you planted in training. Even the best trainers 
don’t plant fully developed crops, however. Give the new agents enough 
training to ensure that their lack of proficiency won’t negatively affect your 
customers, test those agents to make sure that they understand what to do, 
and then get them out there (with support and coaching, of course). Training 
is a process, not an event.
Encouraging continued training
Jack Nicklaus, one of the most successful golfers of all time, once told an 
interviewer that he was still learning about the game of golf, even though at 
the time he was in his mid-50s.
You can look at training for a job in the same way. You can give your agents a 
great start by providing new-hire training, but the process of actually figuring 
out the job never ends. With this philosophy in mind, you can build in proce-
dures to encourage continuous training, such as these:
 
✓ Weekly quizzes: Quizzes can test for ability in a specific area and, in the 
process, develop skill in and awareness of the subject.
 
✓ Regular coaching sessions: Conduct side-by-side sessions with agents 
to build their confidence and proficiency in interacting with customers. 
Specific areas include closing knowledge gaps; helping them think, talk, 
and type (multitasking); and further developing their soft skills in deal-
ing with customers, meaning how those agents constructively commu-
nicate. Make these sessions short, sweet, and to the point. We provide 
more details on coaching in Chapter 13.
 
✓ Mystery calls: Mystery calls are mock calls that the phone system sends 
to an agent, in which a trainer or team leader plays the part of a cus-
tomer incognito. You can use this approach to develop agents’ problem-
solving skills quickly and effectively.

256
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
 
✓ Team meetings: Team meetings allow you to get new information (noth-
ing too complex, though) or updates out to the entire team, and you 
can also celebrate successes. Use team meetings to develop some team 
bonding with recognition, idea generation, and fun activities.
 
✓ Updates training: When your agents need complex skill development, 
you may need to use classroom training. Again, keep the training simple 
and as brief as possible. Agents need to know the critical components of 
the new information — why it’s so important and how it affects their job 
performance. Make sure that they also know where to find procedures 
and policies on the subject.
 
✓ Idle-time training: You can even inject training events between an 
agent’s calls. Because you actually use the agent’s idle time, you lower 
your cost, and because you tie the training to individual needs, that 
training is very effective.
 
 
When idle times increase at Transcom, agents receive mini training 
sessions through video or audio tapes, or through Webinars (seminars 
accessed over the Internet).

Chapter 13
Creating a Coaching Culture
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the benefits of coaching
▶ Following some basic principles of coaching
▶ Training your call center’s coaches
You only need to look at the professional (and amateur) sports model 
to see the impact of coaching. These multimillion-dollar businesses 
have managers and administrators, as is typical in any business. The core 
position, however, is the coach, whose role involves the development of the 
human capital — that is, the players — to their full potential.
Call centers that have a similarly high human-capital component don’t always 
take advantage of coaching. They often relegate the job to managers and 
administrators instead of doing what sports teams do: Remove the admin-
istration and management duties from the coach so that he can focus on 
people performance.
In this chapter, we show you how to make training a top priority for your 
team leaders. Yes, training! You may have promoted your best agent, but that 
doesn’t necessarily make her the best coach. Coaching is an art and a science 
that uses specific techniques and methods to help you maximize your agent 
potential. This chapter also includes the recipe for the secret sauce: the top 
ten applied coaching principles that set you up for success.
 
Don’t think of coaching as just a nice employee-centered activity. It is a nice 
activity, but we do it because it’s the surest path to minimizing costly repeat 
calls; optimizing revenue opportunities; and delivering a consistent, high-
quality customer experience. With 65 percent to 75 percent of your costs 
being driven by agent wages, benefits, and incentives, coaching is a critical tool 
to improve the retention and overall performance of your agents. It also 
corrects a common problem of noncoaching organizations: Despite the 
expense and effort, classroom training fails to produce a performance return 
on investment.

258
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
Seeing the Benefits of Coaching
Selling an investment in coaching to your organization isn’t very different 
from persuading the organization to buy a piece of technology. Whether 
you’re trying to get approval from your boss to invest in training for manag-
ers or to purchase a resource that can streamline administration, be sure to 
quantify the financial returns from any investment.
Financial benefits
Focused coaching can give you a significant number of measurable benefits, 
such as lower average handle time, improved sales, and increased first-call 
resolution. Moreover, coaching takes advantage of existing operational 
expenses (such as wages and benefits), so unlike technology solutions, it 
doesn’t require new capital expenses.
 
Rather than plead for assistance, build a business case on why investing in 
your managers or the right support structure makes sense. Senior managers 
are more likely to see exactly why they need to invest in coaching when they 
can see the financial benefit. (See Chapter 10 for insights on building a busi-
ness case.)
Here’s one impressive statistic about good coaching that may sway senior 
managers: Industry statistics consistently indicate that a rigorous coaching 
system returns an 8 percent to 18 percent reduction in operational expense 
or increase in revenue.
Performance benefits
If your call center uses coaching, agents can benefit by figuring out how to 
do their jobs more effectively and quickly, which makes them feel confident 
and relaxed when they perform those jobs. Very often, top performers get 
more money and promotions. Also, agents who know how to do the job want 
to improve their performance. High anxiety in call centers often stems from 
coming to work every day and not knowing whether you’re doing the job 
correctly.
Companies can quickly get a good result from time spent coaching their 
agents. The following sections talk about five areas of positive effect.

259
 Chapter 13: Creating a Coaching Culture
Operational efficiency
Coaching enables each agent to minimize the time spent on each call on a 
call-by-call basis and over each shift worked. It has a direct and immediate 
effect on profitability because constant improvements in efficiency mean 
that you need fewer agents (and fewer support roles around them). Reducing 
agent head count by even 5 percent provides your organization significant 
savings. (In Chapter 6, we talk about where agent time goes and how to make 
agents use their time more efficiently.)
Operational effectiveness
Coaching helps agents handle the reason for a customer’s call during that 
first call, without errors and with high customer satisfaction. These effective-
ness elements together reduce expense by reducing repeat calls. Many non-
coaching organizations experience a 40 percent repeat call rate on the same 
issues, which dramatically drives up their operating costs.
Revenue generation
Coaching supports and improves the advanced selling skills of agents, includ-
ing how to identify customer needs and offer additional products to the 
customer. An agent’s ability to sell, especially on service calls, allows organi-
zations to transition from cost center to profit center, which can easily pay 
for the investment in coaching effort. With a lot of companies pushing many 
contacts to self-service (such as interactive voice response or the Web), 
every live contact with the customer needs to provide an opportunity to sell, 
as well as to service.
 
One of SwitchGear’s clients is a small technical support center that handles 
inbound support calls from consumers. In response to the center’s potential 
outsourcing, the director of the center decided to initiate a specific revenue 
opportunity. We identified a specific call driver tied to an additional prod-
uct offering that could prevent problems from arising in the future. Focused 
coaching over a six-month period produced enough revenue to cover 18 per-
cent of the call center costs, which made the executives decide against losing 
that revenue source by outsourcing.
Customer satisfaction and retention
With the high cost of customer acquisition, you have to retain the right 
customers if you want to succeed. Exceptional customer service is the only 
sustainable competitive advantage in businesses. Ongoing coaching helps 
keep the importance of every customer interaction front and center in every 
agent’s mind.

260
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
Employee engagement and retention
You want to keep proficient agents and team leaders engaged and in the orga-
nization for a long time. Often, agents leave your call center because they 
feel stressed, unsupported, and inefficient. Sustained coaching can easily 
produce a 25 percent to 50 percent reduction in the number of agents leaving 
your call center for jobs elsewhere.
If your call center spends less on recruiting, training, and lost productivity 
related to agent turnover — by adding as little as two to four months to the 
time an agent stays with you — you can potentially save hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars.
Understanding the Principles 
of Coaching
Overall, organizational culture helps determine potential for success. A build-
ing block of a coaching culture is the ability to establish trust and engage 
people in meaningful work. You can manage employees without trust, but 
leading and coaching them require that they trust you.
 
Coaching can succeed only if it becomes a top-priority job responsibility for 
the team leader. Often, an organization assigns too many duties to team lead-
ers, which spreads them thin, taking them off the floor and away from their 
agents.
In the following sections, we explain ten key principles that can help you and 
your organization focus on active coaching in your call center.
Get the coach on the court
Get the coach (meaning the team leader) working side by side with the 
agents she supervises and the team she leads. A team leader can’t establish 
the foundational credibility that she needs to be an effective coach if she 
has a superficial knowledge of the business and is more comfortable being a 
spectator than a competitor.
Prioritize ruthlessly
A team leader absolutely needs to focus. Nothing is more valuable than the 
team leader’s ability to motivate his agents and accelerate their performance. 
Assign the task of writing reports and doing other administrative work to 
someone else so that team leaders can focus on their teams.

261
 Chapter 13: Creating a Coaching Culture
Distinguish among management, 
leadership, and coaching
Be clear about the differences among management, leadership, and coaching, 
which are completely different disciplines that may not mix:
 
✓ Management is about policies, procedures, projects, and administration — 
the “what” of the business.
 
✓ Leadership is about inspiring people — the “who” of the business.
 
✓ Coaching is about helping people develop skills and improve their abil-
ity to do their jobs better — the “how” of the business.
Often, team leaders are caught in a reactive approach to the business that 
focuses on reports, new ways to control agents, and what happened yester-
day. Coaching, by contrast, is proactive, affecting the team’s ability to pro-
duce results in the future.
Ask, don’t tell
Managers need to focus on getting information from their agents, rather than 
judging their agents. In this knowledge-based world of contact centers, the 
old command-and-control approach to management fails. An operation is 
destined to fail if the people who know the least about the processes, sys-
tems, and issues (meaning management) tell the people who know the most 
about the operational details (that would be the agents) what to do without 
seeking input. Managers need to ask, not tell.
Put energy before value
If agents don’t trust management, those agents probably don’t trust team 
leaders or welcome them on the call center floor. A team leader first needs to 
bring positive energy and then bring value that improves the performance of 
team members. If agents can’t stand having the team leader side by side with 
them in the business, that team leader can’t truly add value to the way agents 
do what they do.
Build on strengths
Don Shula, the former coach of the Miami Dolphins, said, “Build on people’s 
strengths to engage them early in the process and have them partner with 
you to deliver results.” Leaders must inspire and build on strengths instead 

262
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
of tearing agents down. A decade of employee satisfaction research shows 
that the number-one reason people leave an organization is because they 
have a poor relationship with their direct boss. If an agent is doing her job 
well 75 percent of the time, why isn’t 75 percent of the feedback that she 
receives positive?
Focus on one skill and one step at a time
A weekly or daily approach that first focuses on specific behaviors can really 
help an agent improve his job performance. Conversely, if you give an agent 
a monthly list of results that you want him to improve on without offering 
daily support on how to make those improvements, the agent typically fails 
to improve his results.
In call centers that heavily manage their agents’ performance, you typically 
find 5 percent to 15 percent of employees (the ones who perform poorly) 
on performance improvement plans. In coaching organizations, by compari-
son, you have 100 percent of employees using action plans so that those 
employees can continually improve performance and develop essential skills. 
Everyone should be on a plan to improve performance.
Be specific
If your summary notes from coaching say that agents must build better rap-
port or ask more questions, agents find this coaching hard to implement. 
They ask themselves, “How do I build better rapport? How many questions 
should I ask?” If an agent and manager don’t know exactly what to work on 
after meeting, coaching hasn’t happened.
 
An employee needs to leave a coaching session with a specific and actionable 
commitment that helps her develop her job skills.
Follow up
If an agent can’t use the coaching that he receives on the next customer call, 
and therefore doesn’t start implementing this new information immediately, 
he probably won’t implement the new technique weeks from now. Team 
leaders need to follow up with agents after coaching sessions as soon as 
the agents have had a chance to put the new skill into practice. Usually, this 
follow-up should happen the same day.

263
 Chapter 13: Creating a Coaching Culture
 
We’re not suggesting that team leaders micromanage their agents’ perfor-
mance, but if agents don’t trust their team leaders, they may feel that they’re 
being micromanaged. The objective of coaching follow-up is to provide sup-
port and positive reinforcement, not to make agents feel smothered.
Practice consistency, repeatability, 
and results
Start the wheels in motion by focusing on a repeatable approach that works 
every day. As Stephen Covey says in The Seven Habits of Highly Effective 
People (Simon & Schuster), the main thing is to keep the main thing the 
main thing! World-class leaders and coaches all have the ability to focus on 
improving the call center’s results by working with their agents every day — 
not once a month.
Coaching the Coaches
Many call center organizations believe that they have an effective coach-
ing program in place when they really don’t. They can find many clues, if 
they want to look: poor or inconsistent service and sales results, increasing 
operational costs, poor attendance, and high agent attrition, to name a few. 
Few companies have a sustainable and successful coaching system that can 
fundamentally change the company culture to a high-performance coaching 
culture, in part because very few companies invest in the most important 
positions: the coaches.
Although organizations push for improvements in performance and encour-
age change, they often focus on the agents directly by offering a lot of train-
ing. Usually, they ignore the team leaders. This small group of resources in 
your call center determines the performance ability of all your agents and 
the call center’s culture. They can either enable positive change or prevent it 
from occurring. Yet most of these managers used to work as agents, and the 
company promoted them without training them to coach and lead people. 
Being great agents didn’t prepare them for being great team leaders.
 
A coach who can help improve the performance of her agents by continu-
ally becoming more skilled herself provides a huge asset to the business. 
Your organization probably promoted the current team leaders because they 
performed well in the role of agent. Now you need to train them to be great 
coaches.

Chapter 14
Creating a Motivated Workforce
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the importance of employee motivation
▶ Finding out about agents’ needs
▶ Motivating and rewarding your agents
K
eeping your agents motivated and engaged doesn’t happen by accident. 
You need to make thoughtful and deliberate decisions about how you 
want to treat your agents. Growing engagement within your call center, which 
means motivating the agents who work there, should be one of your key 
strategies; it not only creates an enjoyable and fun work environment, but 
also increases your customer satisfaction and fosters innovation so that you 
can improve constantly. The icing on the cake is that you can save a lot of 
money too.
In this chapter, we define what it means to have truly engaged employees; 
explain why you should be interested in motivating employees; and offer spe-
cific programs and ways to recognize, value, and motivate your agents.
 
To motivate agents, you need to establish an environment of trust in your 
center, especially between your agents and team leaders. If your call center 
has poor relationships, you end up with the proverbial treadmill of agents 
leaving, which means you have to deal with an endless cycle of recruitment 
and training. Before you take the time to create programs to survey, reward, 
and develop your agents, take the time to build trusting relationships (see 
Chapter 16).
Knowing What Motivating 
Your Employees Involves
In many call centers, after an agent has gained knowledge and mastered most 
of the job, she can find it routine and repetitive. For this reason, many call 
center leaders want to know how to motivate their agents — especially when 
those agents have been doing the same job for years.

266
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
When unmotivated agents — and, more important, your top performers — 
walk out the door and never come back, that absence has an enormous 
effect on the organization because it quickly translates into higher cost (cost 
of replacing employees) and possible loss of revenue (often as a result of 
new hires who have less knowledge and lower proficiency). Knowledge- and 
service-based centers are hit the hardest by employees leaving because of 
the challenge of finding good talent in large numbers within the short recruit-
ment time frames that those call centers often require.
Monetary reward programs, agent appreciation days, and other motivational 
programs can get agents excited but often fail to sustain a high-performance 
culture. A key reason for this failure is that programs alone don’t create moti-
vated agents. The leadership team needs to figure out — and take actions to 
address — the root causes of agent dissatisfaction.
In the call centers that we visit every month, some leadership teams focus 
on keeping their agents happy by not creating conflict or avoiding actions 
that may cause employees to disengage. This type of management behavior 
is called employee appeasement. Employee appeasement doesn’t necessar-
ily make the work environment happier, because it leaves employee perfor-
mance issues unaddressed — and it leaves those who are working hard and 
performing well wondering whether they actually need to bother. Therefore, 
employee appeasement can drive a culture of declining performance.
On the other hand, true employee engagement occurs when the executive 
leadership team builds a partnership between the employees and the orga-
nization. The leadership team creates an environment in which employees 
are passionate about the vision of the call center and committed to live by its 
values. Agents go beyond the basic job responsibility to delight customers, 
are proactive and persistent, and make decisions that are consistent with the 
company’s strategic goals and objectives.
If you search for the phrase employee engagement in an Internet search 
engine, you can find a lot of articles that point to a direct correlation between 
high employee motivation and high customer satisfaction (not to mention 
company growth and profitability). You can find an equal number of articles 
that dispute this claim, of course, saying that these aspects of a business 
aren’t necessarily affected by motivated employees. But common sense says 
to us that if your agents are happy, this enthusiasm and energy come across 
on the phone and in e-mail, providing a great start to creating a memorable 
customer experience. Customers who receive consistently good service 
develop loyalty to the organization that treats them well, and those loyal cus-
tomers come back for more, often referring other customers.
Also, highly motivated agents provide stability to your call center. Fewer 
agents leaving your center means less time devoted to hiring and training 
agents and to making newly hired agents proficient in their jobs — and more 
time devoted to helping your seasoned agents improve your customers’ 

267
 Chapter 14: Creating a Motivated Workforce
experiences and your call center’s operational efficiency. The time associ-
ated with replacing agents who know the job very well with newly hired, 
inexperienced agents carries a significant cost.
On average, annual agent attrition rates range from 25 percent to 40 percent 
for most call centers. A call center that requires a high degree of knowledge 
and skill — such as a health-care or technical-support center — tends to have 
a relatively low attrition rate.
Seeing the benefits of motivating agents
Based on our estimates, the cost of replacing an agent ranges from $6,000 to 
$20,000, depending on your industry’s salaries and training time. Also, you 
may have to offer extra benefits to attract the talent you want, based on the 
supply and demand of the skills you need.
An easy calculation can show the magnitude of the savings that you can expe-
rience if you reduce employee attrition. To keep our example simple, we’ve 
included only the typical cost of hiring and training. We don’t include other 
costs (such as cost of errors made and coaching time) in the calculation.
For a call center that has 100 agents, a 30 percent annual attrition rate, and a 
cost of $10,000 to replace one agent, you can calculate the cost of replacing 
an agent by using this formula:
100 agents × 30 percent (0.3) × $10,000 per agent = $300,000
100 agents × 20 percent (0.2) × $10,000 = $200,000
Savings = $300,000 – $200,000 = $100,000
If this call center reduced its agent attrition to 20 percent, it would save 
$100,000! Then it could redirect this money to offer better training, which 
can improve the customer and agent experience. So in addition to creating a 
positive working environment, keeping your agents motivated has a definite 
monetary benefit for your call center.
Identifying why agents leave
When an agent leaves your call center, have an objective party conduct a 
brief exit interview with the departing agent. Some companies outsource 
this task to an agency that specializes in these types of interviews. A single 
interview doesn’t tell you much, but if you can consolidate information from 
several of these interviews, you can see trends and patterns.

268
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
If you’re lucky, an agent may tell the truth in an exit interview, but in most 
cases, no one wants to burn a bridge by saying bad things about his former 
employer. Departing agents often give these kinds of reasons for leaving:
 
✓ I wanted to go back to school.
 
✓ I got a job in the field of my studies.
 
✓ I found a job that pays more money.
 
✓ I found a job that gives me a promotion from what I do currently.
Based on our experience, answers like the ones in the preceding list suggest 
that the call center job didn’t challenge the agent and that she didn’t see any 
potential for personal or career development in your company. Often, agents 
leave because they find jobs that offer more money — but money can be an 
emotional factor, compensating agents for something that they feel they’re 
not getting from your company. You need to create a trusting environment 
that focuses on learning from mistakes, helping agents grow and develop in 
their job, providing agents the opportunity to try different roles within your 
center, and creating a career path that has specific outcomes — recognizing, 
supporting, and ultimately achieving the agents’ ambitions.
 
Many organizations have exit interviews in place, but you need to analyze the 
results so that you know what changes you need to make.
Figuring Out What Motivates 
Your Agents
You can do many things in your organization to keep the environment positive 
and enjoyable, but you have only so many hours in the day. By surveying your 
agents, you can pinpoint exactly where agent dissatisfaction exists and then 
use your time effectively to work on initiatives that matter to your agents.
Understanding what agents want
Agents, like any other employees, have certain needs. If you can satisfy the 
needs of the majority of agents, you set yourself up for success. Don’t feel lim-
ited by the following list; try to determine specific needs that your agents have.
Agents want to be
 
✓ Led by a capable team leader who has a clear sense of direction
 
✓ Heard and acknowledged

269
 Chapter 14: Creating a Motivated Workforce
 
✓ Able to use their skills and abilities to their fullest potential
 
✓ Able to find meaning in their work
 
✓ Recognized and given credit for good work
 
✓ Treated fairly
 
✓ Appropriately compensated
 
✓ Able to grow their skills and to develop as individuals
Surveying your agents
You can most effectively measure how engaged your employees are in their 
work by asking them. Some companies do it once a year, and others do it four 
times a year. If you survey your agents too frequently, you may not be able to 
implement some changes that you make based on the results fast enough, so 
the agents may think that you’re not making any change or taking any action 
based on the feedback they give. Whatever frequency you choose, be consis-
tent in surveying, and look for improvement from one survey to another.
Here are some practices to consider when you survey your agents:
 
✓ Communicate openly. Each time you conduct a survey, tell your agents
 
• Why you’re doing the survey
 
• What you want to achieve
 
• Which company goal this survey supports
 
• What you plan to do with the results (what changes you want to 
put in place)
 
✓ Assure your agents that the survey is anonymous. That way, they feel 
comfortable giving you honest feedback.
 
✓ Encourage everyone to participate. Explain how agents can make a dif-
ference, and give them time to complete the survey during their work 
day. You want to get a good sample size so that not only vocal agents 
direct your actions. Check with an expert in research and surveying to 
determine the right sample size for your call center.
 
✓ Analyze the survey results and formulate a plan based on those results 
as soon as possible. If too much time elapses, the initiative loses steam, 
and the agents think that you didn’t take their feedback seriously.
 
✓ After you analyze the results, communicate face to face with your 
agents. Make sure that they understand what the results mean, what 
next steps you plan to take, and why you’re choosing to make those spe-
cific changes.

270
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
 
✓ Keep your commitments visible by using posters or bulletin boards. 
You don’t want these displays to look like wallpaper, so update them 
continually to show progress on the changes you’re making.
 
✓ Meet with your agents three to four months after the survey results 
have been published. Provide agents an update, and show them how 
their feedback has positively affected their work environment, their job, 
and the company. Survey again to see whether your changes improved 
agent satisfaction.
Comparing your call center with others
Compare your call center with other call centers by participating in a 
regional or national employee-satisfaction survey. This comparison can help 
you understand how your call center ranks against others. Ranking higher 
than other companies in the following areas can ensure that you have a boun-
tiful supply of talented candidates to draw from for agent positions. Here are 
some characteristics of well-led call centers:
 
✓ Trust and integrity: Do your team leaders communicate expectations 
and demonstrate the same expectations within their role? If you expect 
agents to get to work on time, for example, your team leaders have to 
get to work on time every day.
 
✓ Good agent–team leader relationships: Do agents value their relation-
ships with their managers?
 
✓ Link between employee performance and company performance: 
Does each agent understand how her work contributes to the company’s 
performance?
 
✓ Professional development opportunities: Is the company making an 
effort to develop the agents’ skills and knowledge?
 
✓ Personal growth opportunities: Do the agents have future opportunities 
or a clear path for growth?
 
✓ Coworkers/team members: Does the work environment offer support, 
recognition of work, and collaboration, and does management encour-
age ideas?
 
✓ Pride in the company: Are agents proud of being associated with the 
company? Does your company have a great reputation for being a ser-
vice leader or a community leader? If not, what steps are you taking 
to make changes, and how can your agents contribute to making 
improvements?

271
 Chapter 14: Creating a Motivated Workforce
Motivating Your Agents
When you can motivate and engage agents, you create a positive working 
environment. Agents have an enjoyable time doing work that gives them 
a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, and that allows them to work 
with people who are genuinely interested in their job success and personal 
growth. We talk about what makes agents engaged in their work and within 
your center in “Figuring Out What Motivates Your Agents,” earlier in this 
chapter. The following sections outline specific actions that you can take to 
create that atmosphere of engagement.
Making agents feel valued
Inspiring others starts by communicating very clearly about specific behav-
iors that support your call center’s vision and values. Agents need to under-
stand what’s expected of them, but team leaders must first demonstrate 
these behaviors. Reinforcing the importance of your agents’ role and contri-
bution when you roll out strategies and changes can help agents understand 
how they fit into the bigger picture of your call center’s mission and vision.
Because your agents talk to your customers and have firsthand knowledge of 
what your customers experience each day, they can give you input and feed-
back about your products, customers, processes, and systems. You can get 
useful information in several ways:
 
✓ Conduct focus groups. You can conduct regularly scheduled focus 
groups or impromptu ones based on need. Bring together a small group 
of agents, and ask them specific questions such as these:
 
• What obstacles prevent you from providing great service?
 
• What are customers saying about our new product?
 
 By asking more in-depth questions based on the answers you receive, 
you can come up with the top three pressing issues for agents. To keep 
these ideas and feedback coming, you need to communicate progress to 
your agents and show them that changes are being made.
 
✓ Sit with a few agents at their workstations every month. You can see 
firsthand the agents’ point of view and the challenges they face. This 
activity also shows that you’re interested in and value what agents do: 
work hard every day to satisfy customers’ inquiries and requests.
 
✓ Encourage employee involvement by establishing committees. If you 
find yourself wondering whether agents would approve of changes 
you’ve planned, you can take the pressure off yourself by creating an 

272
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
agent committee. That committee produces new ideas and plans how to 
implement incentives effectively — information that it passes along to a 
team leader. Committee involvement gives agents a voice in something 
very near and dear to their hearts: their pay!
 
✓ Design a process to capture, acknowledge, and implement agent sug-
gestions and ideas. These suggestions can relate to improvements 
to your products, processes, and overall customer service. After you 
commit to the employee suggestion process, you have to build a struc-
ture within your department to keep suggestions active and ongoing. A 
group of people or one person in your call center should be assigned 
the job of acknowledging and reviewing each idea and then determining 
whether the call center should implement the idea immediately, later, 
or perhaps not at all. This group or person also needs to communicate 
decisions back to the agent who suggested the idea so that she knows 
what happened to it.
 
✓ Give your agents some control of their jobs. Allow them to make cer-
tain decisions. When you give agents some information about the effect 
of their decisions and some guidelines about what they can do, they can 
gain a sense of confidence and control by solving customer problems 
without having to get approval from their team leaders.
 
✓ Understand agents’ personal situations. Make good decisions that bal-
ance employee needs with business needs. Many new team leaders think 
that they have to treat all agents the same way, but agents and their situ-
ations are unique. When appropriate, involve agents in coming up with 
solutions to their individual problems. An agent may not be able to work 
overtime because he has to pick up his child from day care, for example. 
By brainstorming possibilities with the agent, you can try to come up 
with a solution that works for both the agent and the call center as a 
whole, such as giving your agent notice when the call center may need 
him to work overtime so that he can make alternative arrangements to 
pick up his child that day.
Taking time to recognize agents
Call center leaders constantly look for ways in which agents can improve. 
When team leaders and quality analysts listen to calls, everyone looks for ways 
that the call could be better. But if you praise a job well done, you reward the 
positive outcomes that agents create for your business, and you reinforce the 
actions and behaviors that you most want those agents to repeat. If you focus 
only on what an agent can improve, that agent may think that she doesn’t do 
anything well and may become demoralized.
 
Recognition can seem shallow and uninspiring over time if you limit it to 
generic encouragement, such as “Good job!” or “Well done.” To make recogni-
tion meaningful, be specific in your praise of what the agent has done well, 
and give your feedback soon after the impressive behavior occurred. You 

273
 Chapter 14: Creating a Motivated Workforce
could tell the agent that you liked how he acknowledged the customer’s situ-
ation and built confidence when he said, “I’m sorry to hear that you had so 
many problems, but I’m glad you came to me, because I can help you solve 
your issues today!” With this specific feedback, the agent can understand 
what you liked and what he should do again in a similar situation.
To build and celebrate behaviors that you want to see repeated, you can 
establish programs that recognize agents who
 
✓ Are consistent every day in meeting all the criteria for good performance.
 
✓ Go the extra mile to help customers or other agents.
 
✓ Give suggestions that create benefits for the call center, such as saving 
money or improving customer service.
 
✓ Are the most improved in building their skills or working toward a goal. 
This kind of recognition helps encourage those agents who aren’t always 
at the top but are trying hard to improve.
Recognizing individual agents
A call center’s leadership team can take myriad actions and offer all kinds of 
rewards that cost very little and energize agents. Here are a few examples:
 
✓ Encourage peer-to-peer recognition. The leadership team encourages 
agents to recognize teammates who go above and beyond the call of 
duty.
 
✓ Offer a handwritten note with detailed praise. This kind of personal 
recognition can make anyone feel special.
 
✓ Give a personal acknowledgment and a small token. You can give gift 
certificates for small items, such as coffee at your local coffeehouse or 
lunch at your company cafeteria. You can even have the agent pick her 
certificate from a bag to ensure fairness and add to the fun.
 
✓ Allow the agent to work a preferred shift. Recognizing achievement in 
this way delights agents because they can work a shift that integrates 
better into their lifestyles.
 
✓ Point out the agent’s accomplishment to the senior leadership team. 
Drawing attention to that agent not only gives him recognition, but also 
allows you to showcase the type of talent you have in your call center.
 
✓ Create a “smile team.” This team schedules random, fun events that 
recognize agents for good quality of work, best sales, or significant 
improvement.
Recognizing the whole department
You can even recognize the whole call center department for a job well done. 
Maybe everyone worked hard during a seasonal time to help the company 
meet customer demand for its services or products, or maybe the call center’s 

274
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
daily effort helped your company exceed its profit targets. You can use these 
activities to show the entire call center that the company appreciates all the 
work:
 
✓ Have the head of the call center cook for the agents by holding a com-
pany barbecue onsite or in the parking lot.
 
✓ Arrange for high-performing agents, or even one select agent, to have 
lunch with the executives or leaders, whom they typically wouldn’t 
meet. Giving agents direct access to executives in a casual setting helps 
agents and leaders understand one another better.
 
✓ Offer an unexpected perk — such as pizza, chocolate, or ice cream — for 
everyone in the center.
 
Recognition programs can fail if you single out a few mysteriously selected 
agents, thereby sapping the morale of those who don’t understand the crite-
ria. Don’t use personalized, subjective criteria to determine winners.
Paying agents appropriately
You can easily say that compensation programs must be fair, but you have 
to work to find out what the going rate is in your area and what you should 
pay to attract the right talent. Make sure that you can show your agents how 
their compensation is related to the expertise required in the job. Various 
companies provide compensation surveys and research relevant to your 
industry and area; you can find this information by doing an Internet search.
Good compensation programs match your business goals and, therefore, 
drive the right behaviors and results, compensating agents for good work. 
Regardless of the type of call center, you have two types of compensation 
plans to consider, each with its own merits:
 
✓ Fixed salary: To drive higher sales or another specific behavior, you can 
introduce random incentives as a minor part of an overall compensation 
program.
 
✓ Pay-for-performance: This compensation program uses a relatively low 
fixed salary and a relatively high variable component called a bonus. 
You base this monthly program on the agent’s ability to realize three to 
four specific performance targets.
 
 Pay-for-performance programs are becoming very popular, particularly 
in sales call centers, where performance can be measured easily through 
sales achievement.

275
 Chapter 14: Creating a Motivated Workforce
Offering incentive and bonus programs
Whichever path you take, the following sections provide some best practices 
for incentives and performance bonuses.
Introduce the program properly
Your top goal in rolling out a new program is communicating with your 
agents about the program early, telling them how you plan to help them suc-
ceed in this program. These activities can set you up for success when you 
introduce new targets or a new program:
 
✓ Determine which agents can receive bonuses if you use the new tar-
gets, compared with the current program. If the same agents benefit 
after the change, reevaluate your change, because it doesn’t provide 
enough challenge for your agents or enough benefit for your company.
 
✓ Design a gap analysis for each agent. A gap analysis examines how 
much money an agent is making today and how much she’ll make if you 
establish the new program. If fewer agents would get bonuses in the new 
program, determine what support you’ll provide through the team lead-
ers to bring these agents up to the same earning bracket as before.
 
✓ Give your agents time to adjust. While you’re still using the current 
program and before you start the new program, show your agents how 
much bonus they’d receive in the new program and whether that bonus 
is less than what they earn today, and work with them to find ways to 
get to the same level of monetary compensation — or to a higher level.
Keep your measures simple
Pick three or four key measures that have specific targets — not ten mea-
sures. Choose targets that your agents can attain, and make sure that those 
targets can drive the desired long-term behaviors you want. If you choose 
to measure productivity, for example, you need to balance it with quality. 
Choosing one without the other encourages wrong behavior, such as rushing 
through a call and not giving the customer good service. Some call centers 
use customer-satisfaction survey scores as a qualifier for the program, mean-
ing that even if an agent hits his productivity or sales target, he doesn’t qual-
ify for a reward if the customer doesn’t give the call a high score.
Maintain accurate performance data
Keep your data accurate, and ensure that one person is responsible for gath-
ering data, validating it, and producing a report based on the results in a 
timely manner.

276
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
Keep the program flexible
We recommend that you run your bonus program on a monthly basis and 
not run any incentive for more than two months. Agents experience fatigue 
and loss of interest if an incentive goes on too long. By reviewing the targets 
monthly or bimonthly, you can tweak (not completely change) the program 
to include seasonal or promotional differences, or include specials that the 
marketing department dreams up.
Support company goals
We’ve seen programs in which companies encourage agents to get sales with-
out thinking about what happens in the after-sales process, so those compa-
nies end up with orders that they can’t process because the orders contain 
incomplete or inaccurate information. Let your agents know that ensuring the 
accuracy and completeness of an order are as important as taking the order 
itself. To do so, include order information in the structure of the incentive or 
pay-for-performance program (see “Paying agents appropriately,” earlier in 
this chapter).
Measure against company goals
If you reward your agents for meeting the targets, but your company isn’t 
doing well, you may want to rethink your program. The acid test for a good 
program involves determining whether your call center is meeting targets. 
The call center needs to contribute very specifically to the overall goals of 
your company. If your program’s targets don’t lead to this contribution, go 
back to the drawing board.
Seek input from agents
You may find raising the bar on performance to be tough because you have 
to get your agents excited about a new program each year. Don’t just say to 
your agents, “Thank you, but now you have to do 10 percent more.” Let them 
know why you want to raise the bar, and include them in finding a solution 
so that you can implement that solution effectively. Incorporate their sugges-
tions on ways to improve the program.
Also, discuss the changes that you plan to make with other company employ-
ees who will be affected to ensure that all employees recognize and agree 
with the importance of those changes. You want everyone to be on the same 
page regarding sales strategies and corporate goals, understanding how com-
pensation can support these strategies and goals.
Add a benefit for everyone
Establishing a pay-for-performance program means that you pay bonuses 
only to those who meet the performance targets. Agents whose performance 
sits just on the borderline of meeting targets may challenge you for that com-
pensation. Unfortunately, you have to draw the line somewhere and can’t 

277
 Chapter 14: Creating a Motivated Workforce
change the bar after the fact. Consider creating a program to acknowledge 
effort and to reward those agents who almost reach the target.
Successful programs reward good results and recognize effort through a point 
system. This point system encourages those agents who tried hard to meet a 
target but fell short, because they can redeem the points that they did earn for 
rewards. This type of program needs to have a minimum acceptable level of 
achievement as a qualifier for agents to earn points. Suppose that your sales 
target is $10 of revenue per call, and for each $1 of revenue that your agent 
brought in, she earned 2 points. Your agent didn’t qualify for the bonus because 
she got only $5 of revenue, but you can still encourage her because she earned 
10 points, which she can redeem for gift certificates or merchandise.
Rewarding and recognizing performance
An executive with a large financial services 
company once approached us with a typical 
sales scenario. Only 10 percent of his sales 
team — the same high performers every 
month — were being recognized through his 
organization’s rewards and recognition (R&R) 
program. This left the rest of the team, particu-
larly those agents who performed at a medium 
level relative to their peers, demoralized and 
unmotivated to improve their sales results. This 
medium-tier group represented about 70 per-
cent of agents — a huge opportunity to improve 
sales performance and team morale.
To address this motivational issue, our client 
decided to move from an R&R program focused 
purely on sales numbers to one that included 
reward for positive behaviors. His team iden-
tified the key behaviors that led to the best 
results. One example was doing the right thing 
for the customer, which meant that in case 
of problems, an agent referred the customer 
to an internal party who could better address 
the customer’s needs instead of trying to 
close the sale himself. The agent “lost” the sale, 
but the action created a better experience for 
the customer and higher revenue for the orga-
nization. This positive behavior was reinforced 
through weekly coaching by team leaders.
Implementing the new R&R program had a big 
payoff. Performance improved at every level. 
among high, medium, and low performers. 
Because of the focus on positive behaviors, the 
whole team was able to improve results and be 
recognized for both big and small successes.
Building on the success of the new program, 
our financial-services client sought to improve 
the sales performance of his overall team. He 
found that the way sales objectives were being 
set demotivated most members of his sales 
team, because targets were being met by only 
the top 10 percent of the group. Rather than 
set a fixed target that only a few agents could 
achieve, he set objectives based on a ranking 
system that compared individual sales results 
with a weighted team average. He called this 
system a “peer-to-peer” system because 
objectives were set based on peer perfor-
mance. The system created targets that agents 
could buy into — results that their own peers 
were achieving, not top-down objectives set by 
management.
Implementing an R&R program that blended 
sales results, positive behaviors, and peer-to-
peer ranking to set targets produced a dramatic 
improvement in sales results. The client’s team 
achieved a 32 percent lift in gross sales in one 
quarter, and he improved sales results and team 
morale without increasing his R&R budget.

Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
Developing agents’ careers
By creating a development path or a plan of action to help your agent build 
his skill and knowledge, you can clearly show that agent where he is in terms 
of his personal development and where he can progress.
 
Dangling that proverbial carrot of a promotion to get your agents to acceler-
ate their performance can backfire very quickly. You easily lose the most 
important part of the relationship — trust — when an agent doesn’t get the 
promotion. What if the company doesn’t have any positions available to which 
the agent can move? What if your agent doesn’t get the job because she isn’t 
as qualified as other candidates for that position? Any of these situations may 
leave you with a very demoralized agent.
To develop an agent’s skills, you first need to convince him of the importance 
of sharpening the skills required for his current role, as well as how he can 
easily use these skills in other types of roles. Skills such as decision-making, 
judgment, thinking on one’s feet, multitasking, managing conflict, and effec-
tively selling are great skills to have in most jobs, including leadership roles, 
and an agent has hundreds of opportunities (otherwise known as calls) to 
practice and develop these skills. We talk about the value and importance of 
coaching in Chapter 13.
Developing, succession planning, and mentoring
It may all sound the same — development, succession, mentorship — but 
it isn’t. Every employee in a company should have a development plan that 
Helping your agents make career choices
One of our Canadian clients, Scotiabank, has 
call center agents who have limited knowledge 
of other areas of the company, as is common in 
call centers. To give agents a broader under-
standing of the business, the client created a 
career Web site where agents could look at job 
descriptions by department to find what each 
department does and the type of jobs that it has 
available. The Web site also includes a skills 
self-assessment form, which an agent can use 
to compare the skills that he has today against 
those he needs for a job that he’s interested in. 
Agents can also find opportunities on this Web 
site to attend a panel discussion with former 
agents who have moved to other departments, 
where those former agents can share experi-
ences and tips. Agents can use this Web site 
and the opportunities it offers to discuss with 
their team leaders how they can develop their 
skills most effectively.

279
 Chapter 14: Creating a Motivated Workforce
leads her to improve her knowledge and skill. This improvement then earns 
her participation in succession planning and mentorship programs:
 
✓ Development plan: A sort of map that your agent can use to get to a 
higher skill level as it relates to his current job. This plan could include 
observing or shadowing employees in other roles while they do their 
jobs within your center or even other departments. This process helps 
an agent develop understanding of the role, which helps him decide 
whether that role is a possible next step in his career.
 
✓ Succession plan: A plan that starts with the team leader’s vision of how 
the call center will support the customer in three to five years, and 
what skills and key people can help the team leader reach that goal. 
Succession planning involves ensuring that the call center has the next 
line of leaders in place, ready to take the next step when they’re needed.
 
 A succession plan includes ways to further enhance the skills required 
by specific people in new roles. Your three-year vision could require 
another ten team leaders, for example. You can hire them from outside 
the company, but developing the skill and knowledge of your agents for 
this next role can benefit all parties: Agents have a path to further their 
opportunities and income, and you can benefit from internal candidates’ 
existing knowledge of company products, processes, and systems.
 
✓ Mentoring: Actually part of a succession-planning program. Mentoring 
pairs an agent who has a consistent and proven track record of high 
performance with a team leader, a manager, or even the head of the call 
center so that the agent can gain knowledge and experience.
Tapping the real experts
Karen Jensen of Assante Advisor Services, 
an associate of Afshan’s, told us about a chal-
lenge that she faced in her call center: keep-
ing phone representatives knowledgeable and 
up-to-date on changes in products, processes, 
and procedures. Because of the company’s full 
range of complex products, ever-evolving regu-
lations, new products, and taxation information, 
her staff members were overwhelmed by the 
amount of information they had to know.
Jensen decided that her call center needed 
subject-matter experts (SMEs). The SME initia-
tive involved assigning specific agents to deal 
with a specific area of the business (one prod-
uct, for example), rather than requiring every-
one to understand all of them. This approach 
allowed the SMEs to provide knowledgeable 
support to financial advisers and customers 
who needed assistance in that particular area.
Jensen saw significant results from her SME 
effort. The center increased first-call resolu-
tion, so customers got their issues resolved the 
first time they called. Also, the agents who were 
responsible for a specific area of knowledge 
felt very motivated, had a sense of ownership, 
and found their roles more challenging.

280
Part IV: Creating High-Performance Teams 
Creating a great career-development program
Whether you want to implement a development or succession plan, you need 
to consider some key factors:
 
✓ Understand your agents’ motivations and aspirations. By using this 
knowledge, you can link the skills that an agent uses or the work that 
she does to her aspirations. If your agent loves to help others but 
doesn’t feel comfortable selling, for example, you can show her that 
building competency in selling can allow her to train and lead others to 
improve. This approach might pique her interest in improving her own 
selling skills.
 
✓ Talk to agents about their demonstrated strengths and behaviors. 
What does an agent need to do to enhance his potential for advance-
ment, and where does he need to spend time to close the gap in his 
weaker areas?
 
 Suppose that you have an agent who’s interested in training and who’s 
taken many techniques-and-facilitation courses. Taking a course only 
builds knowledge, however; it doesn’t necessarily provide opportunity 
to apply that knowledge. Therefore, the agent lacks training experience. 
If she wants to be a trainer, give her an opportunity to put a small train-
ing session together for your team so that she can apply her knowledge 
in a real-life situation. This training time supports her goal and provides 
you the benefit of a better-trained team.
 
✓ Let the agent know where he is in his development. Make it visual, 
just like a map at the shopping mall: You are here, and you want to go 
there. Depending on where your agent is in his development of the skills 
that he needs in his role as an agent, you can design this path to move 
within your call center or to other areas of the organization outside your 
center. If the agent has mastered his job and now wants to do more, for 
example, he can pursue many paths. Center your discussion with this 
agent on the option that interests him most and what benefit that option 
offers him, and design a plan to help him build the knowledge and skills 
that he needs for that role.
 
✓ Agree on specific next steps, and establish frequent check-in points 
with the agent. Each agent needs to take responsibility for her own 
development. The team leader can coach, provide advice, mentor, and 
suggest possible opportunities, but the agent has to do the work to build 
skill and demonstrate that she really wants to advance.

any call centers have fallen prey to what W. Edwards Deming called 
“instant pudding.” Deming, a management guru whose theories led 
to the development of total quality management (a management philosophy 
that focuses on process and controls to ensure continuous improvement), 
was referring to the act of installing the latest technology or implementing 
the latest management fad in the hope that this addition alone would result 
in operational success. Ongoing improvement and excellence, however, don’t 
come without internal examination and innovation.
Many organizations have realized that improving processes is one of the 
necessary steps to improving the customer service experience. In this chap-
ter, you can find a framework that starts with customer experience and then 
finds ways to improve processes and ideas about how to continually improve 
the experience for your customers.
Managing Complexity through 
Process Improvement
Because call centers have a significant effect on their organizations in terms 
of revenue, cost, and customer relationships, bad results get quick attention. 
In fact, in response to corporate and customer dissatisfaction with call center 
performance, subindustries and government watchdogs sprang up during the 
past decade.

284
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
Considering complexity in call centers
Call centers are struggling with the growing complexity of delivering service 
to customers. This complexity arises from several factors, including these:
 
✓ The breadth of products and constant changes in information about 
these products
 
✓ Changes in the processes and procedures that support the products
 
✓ The number of systems and ways to reach companies, such as phone, 
fax, e-mail, and Web chat
As a result, your agents need a lot of knowledge and skill to listen, think, talk, 
and type, conducting a natural, positive conversation with your customers. 
Your agents have to be product experts who can solve a broad range of cus-
tomer requests through multiple computer systems (either by talking on the 
phone or by writing in e-mails and Web chats) and must continually upgrade 
their knowledge and skills.
Complexity always creates challenges, but by putting a method in place to 
clean up the fallout from your complexity, you can provide an excellent expe-
rience for your customers. The best byproduct of putting this kind of disci-
pline in place is that improvements in customer service often translate into 
cost savings for your organization. If you want to streamline a process so that 
Call-handling process improvements 
generate big wins
A few years ago, Réal was helping a telecom-
munications company improve the cost of 
running its call centers. He focused on the pro-
cess of handling various types of calls, which 
involved mapping out how agents handled the 
most common types of customer inquiries. Up 
to that point, the call center had offered no 
standardized approach for handling various 
call types.
While Réal and his team identified and docu-
mented the general approach that agents used 
to handle customer inquiries, the agents began 
making their own suggestions for improvement, 
with two major results:
 ✓ Réal’s team developed several new call-
handling processes that went into effect 
almost immediately.
 ✓ The agents defined a process for making 
ongoing improvements in the call-handling 
process.
Within a month, call length had declined by 
15 percent, and the total cost per customer of 
running the operation fell by a similar amount. 
Also, the leadership team reported that the 
number of errors and callbacks had decreased. 
Months later, the improvements continued.

285
 Chapter 15: The Power of Process Improvement
customers receive their product faster, you can reduce the time it takes your 
company to send off an order by reducing the number of people involved 
in the process. If fewer people are involved, you reduce labor hours, which 
means cost savings for your organization.
Benefiting from process improvement
Process improvement is a systematic way to make steps or actions in a process 
better. Think of process improvement in terms of what it does for the drivers 
of performance. If a process improvement positively affects a driver, you can 
enhance performance (and results) — often, in a very quantifiable way.
 
Here are some examples of typical process improvements that you can 
make in your call center and the potential benefits associated with each 
improvement:
 
✓ Redesign your call-handling process. This improvement reduces aver-
age call length, cost per call, the total expense of running your opera-
tion, and the number of seats needed. It might also improve customer 
satisfaction because customers receive quick resolution of their needs. 
(We talk about call length in Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Create a new schedule. Try to match your scheduling and caller demand 
as closely you can. This improvement speeds answers and can increase 
customer satisfaction. (See Chapter 8 for more information on scheduling.)
 
✓ Improve off-phone or overhead work processes. Improving the pro-
cesses that don’t directly affect agents on the phones can result in a 
reduced need for total support duties and a corresponding reduction in 
the average cost per hour of call center services.
 
✓ Design a new interactive voice response (IVR) system. Create new 
automated voice prompts that provide service to customers who call 
your center, which can reduce the number of callers who need to speak 
with a live agent, contacts per customer, total cost, number of staff, and 
equipment needed. (You can find more on IVR in Chapter 9.)
 
✓ Develop an effective way to present customer data to your agents 
during calls. Agents can present purchase options to customers, result-
ing in a higher percentage of calls that lead to sales or higher average 
value per sale.
 
✓ Analyze why customers call. Determine the number of simple inquiry or 
transaction calls for which the customer could use the company’s Web 
site to get answers or conduct the transaction. Developing a strategy to 
help customers serve themselves allows the customer to seek informa-
tion independently in a way that’s easy and convenient for him. For the 
company, this strategy provides cost savings because each question or 
transaction costs significantly less over the Web than it does through 
the call center.

286
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
Developing a Culture of Improvement
Process improvement can provide the greatest benefit when everyone 
involved in the process being improved is also involved in the improvements. 
Many organizations often overlook one group of potential contributors: their 
customers. Your customers can tell you what’s working and what’s not while 
they do business with you.
The other key contributors to improvement are the people who work with a 
process every day, because they can best tell you how employees actually 
perform tasks as opposed to how they’re supposed to perform those tasks. 
Your agents are a gold mine of ideas and suggestions, and they can point out 
duplication of work (when too many people or departments are involved in 
the same process) or situations in which a specific task or action takes longer 
than necessary. All these ideas should help you streamline or stop activities 
that don’t add value for the customer or the company.
Seeing your company through 
the customer’s eyes
Developing a culture of improvement starts with everyone — from your 
agents to those who run the company — understanding what type of experi-
ence your customers want. After you determine how to treat your customers, 
you can integrate that experience through your processes and train your 
agents in what to do and how to do it so that your customers feel satisfied. 
Then you have to improve the experience over time, for several reasons:
 
✓ Your customers’ expectations change over time, and you have to keep 
pace with their needs.
 
✓ Your agents may use approaches that worked yesterday without under-
standing the value of those approaches to the customer or the company. 
To figure out whether your agents know why they do what they do, ask 
them. When an agent takes a particular approach, ask him, “Why do you 
do that? What value does this step provide for the customer and for the 
company?” If he can’t explain it, the approach likely doesn’t serve its 
original purpose.
 
You can use what we call a customer-experience blueprint to establish the 
way that you want to treat your customers. This blueprint gives your agents a 
guide to satisfying customers and creating a consistent experience that goes 
above and beyond customers’ expectations.

287
 Chapter 15: The Power of Process Improvement
The customer-experience blueprint guides the agent from the time she says 
hello to a customer to the time she says goodbye. This blueprint helps agents 
consistently handle the customer requests and the customers’ emotional 
state by clearly articulating the key steps, knowledge, and skills required at 
each stage of the client experience.
When you create a customer-experience blueprint model, break the interac-
tion into the key phases of the call, as in this example:
 
✓ Phase 1: This phase is the beginning of the call, during which the agent 
connects with the customer and discovers what he’s requesting.
 
✓ Phase 2: The agent provides a solution to the request and confirms next 
steps to solve that request, if needed.
 
✓ Phase 3: The agent adds value by providing information that the cus-
tomer may find helpful in his future transactions with your company, or 
perhaps by discussing products or services that are relevant to the cus-
tomer’s situation or needs.
A company has service expectations of its agents at each phase, and each 
phase requires an agent to demonstrate a specific set of skills.
In the first phase of the preceding example, the first step involves greeting 
the customer. The guide for this step might ask the agent to
 
✓ Answer within a certain number of seconds with a friendly greeting.
 
✓ State her name, the department in which she works, and the company’s 
name.
 
✓ Make the customer feel welcome by offering assistance.
After you create your own unique blueprint, you can train your agents and 
your leadership team in the steps, knowledge, and skills required to create an 
outstanding experience for your customers.
Checking the internal view
Many call centers don’t have a customer-experience blueprint; instead, they 
rely on their quality analysts to identify what aspects of a call effectively lead 
to the desired results and what aspects need improvement (such as broken 
processes, quality issues with products, or poor customer service from 
agents). We recommend that you start with the blueprint because it reduces 
the number of opinions about what good customer service looks like.

288
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
We also recommend that your quality analyst receive agent suggestions 
and customer feedback, integrating her own observations. As we discuss in 
Chapter 3, quality analysts also listen to agent calls and provide feedback 
about service-related negative and positive trends so that they get a well-
rounded view of the biggest issues in your call center, which allows them to 
make well-founded recommendations.
After you figure out what issue you want to fix, you can most effectively find 
gaps in the handling process by mapping out the process related to the issue 
and identifying points of failure. Then analyze the root causes of the failures, 
brainstorm solutions, test the most promising solution, and implement that 
solution.
Mapping your processes
You can use process mapping, a project management method, to design and 
analyze business processes. Literally, you graph a business process in a flow-
chart — a diagram that shows the sequence of operations in a process, such 
as the steps involved in a successful customer call — so that everyone can 
understand the steps involved in producing a result. Figure 15-1 shows a call 
center recruiting and hiring process chart that you can use as an example.
Ceridian’s customer-centered approach
Ceridian Canada, a human-resources and 
payroll management company, significantly 
improved customer satisfaction by tapping into 
customer feedback. After a thorough analysis 
of that feedback, management realized that the 
organization was defining the overall customer 
service experience, not the customers.
The management team conducted a series of 
customer interviews to get more specific feed-
back about what customers really wanted. 
Then, based on this feedback, the com-
pany implemented a few customer-focused 
practices:
 ✓ Analyzing key call types and surveying cus-
tomers to simplify internal processes
 ✓ Training managers and agents to under-
stand the meaning of certain metrics 
and the opportunities that those metrics 
represented so that agents could modify 
their behaviors to use those opportunities 
effectively
 ✓ Constantly considering what customers 
want and developing strategies to deliver 
the desired products or services
By following the simple approach of ensur-
ing that the service experience reflected the 
voice of the customer, Ceridian saw great 
improvements in overall Net Promoter Scores 
to exceptionally high levels while reducing 
service costs and motivating its agents — a 
win–win situation!

With a little time, some common sense, a pot of coffee, and a bunch of dry-
erase markers, your management team can put together some homegrown 
process charts that can really help your call center manage and improve 
processes.
Involving the team
You can most effectively use process mapping as a collaboration tool, so get 
everyone involved, including managers at all levels and your call center agents. 
Aside from the process-improvement outcome, the process-mapping . . . well, 
process, also provides a wonderful team-building exercise.
 
Although process mapping is fairly straightforward, spend some time with 
your team reviewing how it works and why it’s important. A bit of up-front 
training can help prevent blank stares at the beginning of your process-
mapping exercise. Also, be sure to share the spoils of your process-improvement 
success. You don’t have to do anything elaborate. Just offer some form of 
recognition — a party, a platter of fine imported cheeses, whatever.

290
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
 
Involve members from all parts of the call center team in process mapping. 
Any and all input can help the process-mapping exercise while increasing 
employee commitment and improving the quality of the results.
The act of charting the steps of a process helps simplify the process and 
clarifies potential problems and inefficiencies, or places where you need to 
rework the process. At some point while process-mapping, we bet that you’ll 
laugh out loud and ask, “What idiot designed that?” (On second thought, you 
may want to keep that thought to yourself. The idiot may be you!)
Charting the Flow: An Amateur’s 
Guide to Process Mapping
In its simplest form, creating a flowchart involves drawing a picture of what 
happens in your work process, starting with inputs; identifying all actions 
and decisions associated with a process; and then finalizing your diagram 
with the output or goals.
Follow these basic steps to construct a process flowchart:
 
1. Determine the process beginning and ending points.
 
2. List each step involved.
 
 Here are a couple of things that can help you stay focused and consis-
tent when listing steps:
 
• Use action verbs to describe steps.
 
• Decide whether you want to provide a general overview or list 
every discrete step.
 
3. Write down an approximate order for these steps.
 
 Relationships and parallel steps begin to emerge.
 
4. Place each step in the appropriate symbol.
 
 In Figure 15-1, for example, the diamond-shaped items represent a step in 
the process in which the human-resources manager makes a decision — 
usually, yes or no — and the rectangular items illustrate an activity.
 
5. Add arrows.
 
 The arrows show the direction of the process flow.
 
6. Check for redundancy.
 
 Follow the steps in the flowchart to identify steps in the process that 
seem redundant or repetitive. If you identify redundancies, eliminate 
them, and work through the steps again to ensure that you have a com-
plete process.

291
 Chapter 15: The Power of Process Improvement
 
7. Check for missing elements.
 
 Also make sure that you’ve captured all the steps in the process. If 
you’re missing steps, add them to the flow.
 
8. Have a second and third person review the flowchart.
 
You diagram a process so that you can understand it and ask yourself, “What 
do customers expect of us? What should we do to provide better customer 
focus and satisfaction?” The process map can identify the best practices that 
you need to incorporate and locate appropriate benchmarks to improve your 
services.
As American scientist Dr. George Washington Carver put it, “It is simply ser-
vice that measures success.”
Doing a root-cause analysis
After you map the process and identify the points of failure within the pro-
cess (which customers, agents, and your operational data told you about), 
take the time to find the root cause. A root-cause analysis is a class of problem-
solving methods aimed at identifying exactly what leads problems or events 
to occur.
Don’t let finding the root cause become overcomplicated. Keep it simple 
by asking why until you can’t ask that question anymore; then investigate 
further by asking “what” and “who” questions, such as “What caused this to 
happen?” and “Who is responsible for this step of the process?”
Suppose that customers are waiting a long time to get a response from their 
e-mail inquiries. When you map the process related to e-mail response, you 
find out that after an agent receives the e-mail, he responds and sends that 
e-mail to another person, who checks all e-mails for proper grammar, tone, 
and accuracy before finally releasing that message to the customer. Here are 
the questions you should ask:
 
✓ Why do the e-mails need a check for accuracy? You may find out that 
customers used to receive many e-mails containing mistakes and poor 
grammar, so the call center put this step in place.
 
✓ Why did e-mails contain so many errors before the call center put the 
proofing practice in place? You may figure out that several new agents 
were working in the call center at that time.
 
✓ How many errors are occurring today? The answer to this question 
may tell you two things: Preformatted e-mail templates now help agents 
create their responses, and the agents are now more knowledgeable and 
skilled.

292
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
Knowing the answers to the questions in the preceding list allows you to 
come up with possible solutions to reduce the turnaround time for e-mails. 
You could
 
✓ Add more people to do the quality check, if that check gives you a sense 
of security about the quality of e-mail accuracy.
 
✓ Take out the quality step because you currently have a low error rate 
and put in spot checks instead.
You have to identify the right solution for your particular call center, but by 
mapping your process and figuring out the root cause, you can come up with 
an informed and educated decision about which solution can eliminate the 
problem most effectively.
Documenting policies and procedures
If it isn’t written, it isn’t real! Whether your call center’s processes are effec-
tive or not, write them down, and formalize them into some kind of proce-
dures document. You can create and agree to the most efficient and effective 
set of processes and procedures in the world, but if you don’t write them 
down, your agents probably will stop using them.
 
By documenting your procedures and making them accessible to everyone 
in your center, you create a reference guide and training tool that people can 
use to judge their actions. Written documentation also becomes a standard 
against which you can audit work processes. Probably the biggest advantage 
is that it serves as a baseline for future improvement. Put the information that 
agents need right at their fingertips by using a knowledge-base software appli-
cation (see Chapter 9 for more information on knowledge bases).
You need to take some specific actions to ensure that your knowledge base is 
user-friendly. Make sure that it
 
✓ Provides visuals: A picture paints a thousand words. The documenta-
tion in your knowledge base should contain primarily words, of course, 
but it should include a lot of photos, diagrams, and flowcharts as well.
 
✓ Communicates changes in processes: Many call centers are in a con-
stant state of information overload. After you identify the improvements 
that you want to make, you need to communicate those changes to 
your agents. Explain why you made the change, what kinds of calls the 
change affects, and what the agents have to do differently to integrate 
the change into their calls.

293
 Chapter 15: The Power of Process Improvement
Have a process in place for updating and changing your knowledge base, and 
assign one person to this task. This person needs to understand what agents 
like and don’t like about the knowledge base. Agents need to be able to use 
the knowledge base easily, and the person assigned to update the knowledge 
base must make it as agent-friendly as possible.
Overall responsibility for improving processes and ensuring that the changes 
are well integrated must be assigned to a senior person in the call center — 
ideally, the most senior person.
 
If you don’t have the top person in the call center involved, you run the risk 
of losing momentum in making the change — and making it stick — because 
you need her support to get the green light from executives, approval for 
resources, and so on.
Staying Informed: Legislative 
Considerations
In addition to improving processes, you need to establish procedures and 
stay abreast of legislation that affects your call center. In your knowledge 
base, include a section on policies about complying with legislation.
 
What’s the difference between policies and procedures? Procedures are the 
steps you follow to perform tasks; policies are rules that govern your behavior. 
Call centers write a lot of policies, which are designed to protect the agent, the 
customer, and the company. Policies related to agent safety, for example, out-
line what agents need to do to prevent accidents in the workplace.
Law and order: Creating 
appropriate policies
In your knowledge base, include policies for any legislation that someone in 
your call center would need to adhere to so that the center can avoid the risk 
of violation because the employee doesn’t know about the law. Include the 
policies that your leadership team should know in a separate section of your 
knowledge base. These policies might relate to
 
✓ Labor laws: These laws are related to recruiting, working conditions, 
working hours, labor relations, discipline, termination, layoffs, compen-
sation, harassment, and employment equity.

294
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
 
✓ Call center–specific legislation: This legislation directly or indirectly 
affects how your call center can operate — hours of calling for outbound 
projects, telephone solicitation of new business, do-not-call lists, privacy 
of personal information, and so on.
 
✓ Legislated service levels: Call center operations in certain industries 
have minimum service-level targets that their local government estab-
lishes. In some U.S. states, for example, the cable television industry has 
minimum speed-of-answer requirements for call centers. Failure to meet 
these minimums can result in substantial fines for cable operators.
 
All these obligations are very serious, and you need to incorporate them into 
your operations. Create policies that address these legislative requirements; 
then filter your procedures through the policies, and train the affected staff 
members in the policies and underlying legislation. Failure to comply could 
land your call center in a heap of trouble, incurring hefty fines and risking 
reputational ruin.
Knowing the laws
If you want to know the laws that apply to your call center, start by hiring a 
good lawyer or two. You need a labor lawyer and a lawyer who specializes in 
the laws affecting call centers and/or telecommunications.
Give your lawyers copies of your policies and procedures, and ask them 
to review and comment on those policies and procedures. Then ask them 
to identify the areas of legislation that your policies and procedures don’t 
adequately address. They’ll find a lot of stuff — that’s what lawyers do — and 
you can amend your policies and procedures to ensure compliance.
 
Periodically ask your lawyers to review any updates or provide you informa-
tion about new legislation that affects your operations.
Wherever you live, be aware of and compliant with all your local laws and — 
equally important — the laws of the countries with which your call center 
does business. The following sections give you an idea of the kinds of laws 
that affect call centers.
 
If you have a large call center, or if you run an outsourcing call center, you 
may want to consider creating a compliance-officer role in your operation. The 
compliance officer is responsible for making sure that your company complies 
with all the legislation affecting your call center. The best part of having a 
compliance officer is that he’s the person who has to talk to the lawyers!

 Chapter 15: The Power of Process Improvement
U.S. laws
The United States regulates telemarketing through the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC), which enforces a variety of federal antitrust and con-
sumer-protection laws and is responsible for taking action against practices 
that are unfair or deceptive. The FTC’s authority extends to the Internet, 
which (like other media) can be used to deliver fraudulent content.
In addition, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates inter-
state and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and 
cable in the United States. Here’s some legislation that affects call centers:
 
✓ Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act: Under 
this law, the FTC adopted the Telemarketing Sales Rule, which prohibits 
misrepresentations and calls to a consumer after that consumer has 
asked to not receive telemarketing calls, sets payment restrictions for 
the sale of certain goods and services, and requires that call centers 
keep specific business records for two years.
 
✓ Telephone Consumer Protection Act: The FCC places restrictions on 
unwanted telephone solicitations, automatic telephone dialing systems, 
artificial or prerecorded voice messages, and the use of fax machines to 
send unsolicited advertisements.
 
✓ Do Not Call Implementation Act of 2003: This law gave the FTC the 
authority to create and enforce a National Do Not Call Registry, which 
the FCC has also adopted. After consumers place their names on the 
National Do Not Call Registry, telemarketers can’t make unsolicited sales 
calls to those consumers. If a call center fails to comply with the law, it 
can face some very large fines. Although some exemptions apply, this 
law has greatly cut down the number of unwanted telemarketing calls in 
the United States.
 
In addition to enforcing the laws discussed in the preceding list, many U.S. 
states have registration and bonding requirements for telemarketers, as well 
as state-specific do-not-call lists and programs.
 
Both the U.S. and Canadian governments (see the next section) also have 
established privacy laws to protect consumers’ personal information by regu-
lating how and when companies can collect, use, and disclose personal infor-
mation. These laws also regulate the length of time that these companies can 
retain personal information; how companies must secure it; and finally, how 
companies must destroy it. Violations of these laws can result in fines and 
criminal prosecution.

296
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
Canadian laws
Canada regulates outbound telemarketing through the Canadian Radio-
Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). The CRTC issues 
regulations called Telecom Decisions, including calling-time restrictions, 
disclosure requirements, and prohibitions on calls to consumers who have 
asked to not receive telemarketing calls. Current regulations include identifi-
cation and Caller ID requirements, as well as the maintenance of a company-
specific do-not-call list.
Organizations that conduct unsolicited telemarketing activity must honor a 
consumer do-not-call request for three years. The National Do Not Call List 
(DNCL) gives consumers a choice about whether to receive telemarketing 
calls. The National DNCL rules introduce responsibilities for Canada’s tele-
marketers. Consumers can choose to reduce the number of telemarketing 
calls they receive by registering their residential, wireless, fax, or VoIP tele-
phone numbers on the National DNCL. Violations of CRTC rules can result in 
the termination of telecommunications services to the call center.
The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) 
governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable infor-
mation by companies in Canada. All organizations engaged in commercial 
activity must designate a privacy officer or contact, have written policies and 
procedures outlining how the organization handles and protects personal 
information, and train employees in data-handling procedures. In addition, 
PIPEDA meets the requirements set forth in the European Union’s Data 
Protection Directive (see the following section), thereby allowing Canada-
based organizations to handle data about consumers in EU member states.
European Union laws
The European Union (EU), currently comprising 27 member countries, has 
two primary directives that affect call centers:
 
✓ Distance Selling Regulations of 2000: This directive protects con-
sumers throughout Europe who buy goods and services, regardless 
of whether the companies selling these goods or services are located 
within the EU. The regulations cover sales made by mail order, Internet, 
telephone, and all other means of distance communication. They require 
suppliers to give certain information to consumers, offer the right to 
cancel the contract within seven working days of receiving the goods 
or concluding the contract for services, meet set deadlines for delivery 
of goods or performance of services, and offer consumer protection 
against fraudulent use of card payments. The regulations also prohibit 
inertial selling, which is the practice of sending unrequested goods to 
customers and sending them an invoice for the goods in the hope that 
they’ll pay it.

297
 Chapter 15: The Power of Process Improvement
 
✓ Data Protection Directive: The second EU directive establishes how 
public- and private-sector organizations can collect, use, disclose, 
hold, and destroy personal data, whether within or outside a member 
country.
Each member country’s national laws must implement these consumer rights 
under both directives, and these national laws vary from country to coun-
try. Many EU member countries have established preference services that 
include do-not-call lists. Requirements regarding do-not-call laws vary from 
country to country.

Mastering Change in 
Your Organization
In This Chapter
▶ Anticipating situations that call for change leadership
▶ Becoming an effective change manager
▶ Helping your staff adjust to change
Y
ou need strong leaders to introduce change and get agents (and manag-
ers) to adapt, stay focused, and stay productive. Most people call this 
process change management, but we prefer to call it change leadership.
When you read the word change, you might think of big changes, such as lay-
offs, outsourcing, or the implementation of a brand-new piece of technology. 
But call centers have far more constant, incremental changes — changes in 
metrics, expectations, products, billing, new hires, system upgrades, and so 
on. If you get good at dealing with these small changes, you don’t have 
to deal with lost agent productivity and a lack of trust between agents and 
management.
In this chapter, we discuss how to manage all the change that goes on around 
you, how to keep your agents productive, and how to announce and imple-
ment change in a seamless way.
Recognizing When Change 
Leadership Is Needed
As we mention in Chapter 1, call centers have been changing and improving 
for more than 40 years — ever since a call center consisted of a single opera-
tor taking ticket orders to a Frank Sinatra concert. Look at call centers now! A 
modern call center features many technology choices, hundreds of agents in 
one room, managers everywhere, and online content in place of the bulging 
three-ring binders of the past.

300
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
Also, company mergers and complexity have forced agents to use three to six 
online systems just to fill one order. To paraphrase an old saying, “The only 
thing that’s constant is change in call centers.” (In case you couldn’t tell, we 
added the part about call centers.)
Call centers are constant-change machines, and great call center leaders 
develop their personal skills to refine and continually improve changes in a 
call center. If your team never misses a beat during turbulent times, you have 
achieved change mastery. As Charles Darwin said, “It is not the strongest of 
the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most respon-
sive to change.”
Understanding common 
changes in call centers
The following list goes through a few common changes that most call centers 
experience at some point:
 
✓ Customer expectations: Customers want faster service, 24-hour Web 
self-service, and order confirmation by e-mail.
 
✓ Technology: These changes can include updates to systems and net-
works, Web chat, interactive voice response (IVR) prompts, and new 
call-monitoring processes. (See Part III for more information on technol-
ogy in the call center.)
 
✓ Procedures: Your call center may require new procedures and pro-
cesses, as well as a new coaching program.
 
✓ Marketing or products: Your call center may have to deal with a credit-
card launch, a new infomercial that increases calls, or retirement-
planning season.
 
✓ People: Your call center gets new leaders, as well as new recruits (but 
you get new recruits so often, that change doesn’t even feel like change 
anymore). Promoted employees also have to deal with new tasks, higher 
expectations, and confusing job titles.
 
✓ Job security: The call center may need to eliminate individual jobs, or it 
may experience a drop in revenue or a decreasing number of calls.
 
✓ Operations: Your call center may impose extended hours, new sched-
ules, new performance metrics, a new quality process, or (horror!) no 
more free coffee.
Change never takes a break. Everyone is trying to improve the business, 
fix problems, and grow sales. New ideas lead to more projects and more 
changes. New people join and old people leave, and after you achieve suc-
cessful results, management wants better results. Go figure!

301
 Chapter 16: Mastering Change in Your Organization
 
Don’t underestimate the impact of change. Big or small, every new thing that 
you want your team to do falls under this definition and requires thoughtful 
planning. The following sections help you figure out how to get call center 
agents to welcome change with open arms.
Knowing how people react to change
To implement change effectively, you need to understand the perceptions 
that shape people’s responses to change. You can’t lead change success-
fully if you don’t have at least a basic understanding of how and why people 
respond to change.
Perceptions of change
Resistance to change comes about for a variety of reasons. People are simply 
risk-averse; they like things the way they are and may worry that change 
will create a worse situation. Often, agents don’t trust management if past 
changes went poorly, making their jobs more difficult. Also, the degree of 
resistance directly relates to the size of the change you’re making. Changing 
the coffee system may not evoke long-term hostile response, but a change in 
the bonus system can, if agents see this change as a way for management to 
avoid paying the agents their fair share.
Your call center agents may have these types of perceptions of change:
 
✓ Process changes can be confusing. Agents have to figure out these 
changes, and during the transition period, they may work more slowly, 
make mistakes, and lose confidence.
 
✓ Technology changes lead to changes in processes. These changes 
require retraining and cause system instability, which can lead to agent 
frustration.
 
✓ Changes in leaders mean that trust, friendship, and mentorship disap-
pear. Agents don’t know how a new leader will treat them.
 
✓ Changes may mean a change in work/life balance. Agents may have 
new hours, more calls, and no weekends off.
 
✓ Agents may fear failure. Agents may worry that they’ll have to work 
harder to reach the level of success they currently have or that changes 
will leave them with fewer career options.
 
✓ Agents could lose income if expectations are raised. If agents have to 
work harder to get their regular bonuses, they may lose that income if 
they can’t increase their productivity.
 
✓ Agents may worry that they’ll lose their jobs. An agent’s viability can 
be affected by new processes, technology, leaders, or unions; a drop in 
revenue; an increase in revenue; and so on.

302
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
Not every agent has all the concerns in the preceding list, but most agents 
think about some of them, because they wonder how the changes will affect 
them personally. A new mom, for example, might focus most on work/life bal-
ance (getting out at 5 p.m. to pick up little Melissa at day care). A team leader 
might be more focused on career advancement and fear of failure in a chal-
lenging new role.
 
People can be pretty emotional (and often irrational) about change. A strong 
leader needs to help them get through the emotion and become productive 
again.
Stages of reaction to change
Change has as much to do with context as content. You need to understand 
what people think about change if you want to help them accept change.
People go through four stages in reaction to change:
 
✓ Shock or fear: The news causes an emotional reaction that often gets in 
the way of hearing the facts.
 
✓ Defensive retreat: They aren’t ready to deal with change yet and often 
push back or act out.
 
✓ Acknowledgment: They’re ready to listen but haven’t yet accepted the 
change.
 
✓ Acceptance and adaptation: They’re ready to move forward produc-
tively (although they may still have anxiety about some aspects of the 
change).
Every agent remains in each stage for a different period. Also, positive 
change for one agent may be negative change for another. A strong sales-
person may like the new bonus system, which provides lower base income 
with more opportunity for bonuses, but an unskilled sales agent may see the 
change as creating a loss of income.
 
Often, when managers think that their agents aren’t accepting the change, 
those agents are merely confused about what the change means. Don’t 
assume that an agent’s need for clarity equals nonacceptance.
Seeing why things go wrong sometimes
 
Clients often ask us, “Why, despite my best efforts, do my agents have so 
much resistance to change?” Here are some common missteps that can derail 
a smooth transition to agent acceptance:

303
 Chapter 16: Mastering Change in Your Organization
 
✓ You don’t explain why the call center needs the change.
 
✓ You don’t think that agents can handle the truth, so you try to sugar-
coat it and lose credibility.
 
✓ You try to rush acceptance and don’t respect the four stages of reaction 
that agents go through (as discussed in the preceding section).
 
✓ You send confusing or conflicting messages, or you try to explain by 
using data that doesn’t seem relevant.
 
✓ You give up communicating with and listening to your agents, thinking 
that they should understand the change by now.
 
✓ You don’t describe the change in terms of personal effects on agents; 
you focus only on company and customer needs, ignoring the needs of 
your agents.
 
✓ Instead of having an empathetic conversation, you answer emotional 
questions about personal effects with data and facts — terms that offer 
no comfort.
 
What you’re thinking and what your agents are thinking may not be the same 
thing. It can be difficult to guess the context in which agents will take the news 
and even more difficult to anticipate their emotional reactions.
Improving Your Personal 
Change-Leadership Style
When you’re dealing with a lot of changes in your call center, remember that 
each change has its own effects on employees, and its own data and metrics, 
but all changes have common themes that tell you how to make your agents 
accept the change without a lot of bother.
Avoiding change pitfalls
Managers at all levels may struggle to deliver change messages because they 
inadvertently follow the wrong behaviors. Do you recognize yourself in any of 
the following examples?
 
✓ Situation: You haven’t personally bought into the company’s decision.
 
 Wrong behavior: You create an us-versus-them mentality by telling the 
agents that you don’t agree with the change either, but the muckety-
mucks are insisting that you impose it.
 
✓ Situation: You avoid conflict at any cost, and implementing this change 
feels like conflict.

304
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
 
 Wrong behavior: You avoid handling the introduction of the change face 
to face with your agents. Instead, you deliver the messages by e-mail or 
through other people, and you don’t do individual follow-up.
 
✓ Situation: You don’t know how to explain vision and context because 
you’re not sure why the company decided to impose this change.
 
 Wrong behavior: You wait to tell your team until after senior manage-
ment has made all the decisions and planned every step. You avoid 
explaining why you’re imposing the change and discussing the effect, 
and you focus instead on the easier “what and when” discussions.
 
✓ Situation: You don’t have all the information that your agents want, you 
can’t answer all their questions, and you find some of the information 
provided by senior management or other teams to be confusing.
 
 Wrong behavior: You conduct your team meeting without preparing 
properly for it or getting all your facts clear in advance.
Following the Rule of Change Success
The Rule of Change Success can help you decide which elements need most 
of your attention. This rule uses a sort of formula to spell out how to achieve 
change success:
Discontent + Clear future state + Action plan > Degree of resistance
Keeping communication transparent
One of our clients recently had to implement 
a sales program in his organization’s service-
oriented call center, which provides diagnostic 
service or repair advice and dispatches techni-
cians to repair faulty equipment. Many of the 
agents had worked for the company for years 
and were well entrenched in their current roles. 
Our client had to ensure that the team would 
fully support the new sales program.
His management team focused on transparency 
of communication, communicating with agents 
openly and frequently so that the agents felt 
respected and excited about the center’s new 
direction. Actively engaging the agents, and 
giving them a clear understanding of the direct 
benefits for themselves and the company, was 
fundamental to the program’s success because 
the agents had to implement this new program 
themselves.
By openly discussing the program, our client 
gained commitment from the majority of the 
center’s agents. Those agents even provided 
recommendations on how to introduce the pro-
gram, and our client made several enhance-
ments to the program based on agent feedback.
The transparent approach produced dramatic 
results for our client’s company — sooner than 
expected and at a lower cost than budgeted — 
because it got agents involved in making the 
sales program a success.

305
 Chapter 16: Mastering Change in Your Organization
Here’s a breakdown of the elements of this formula:
 
✓ Discontent: No one changes easily if he’s very comfortable with the cur-
rent state. Acceptance of change typically occurs when enough discon-
tent breaks down organizational inertia.
 
✓ Clear future state: Agents can see a positive, or even exciting, outcome 
of the change. Explain the positive outcomes of change, as well as what 
isn’t changing. Be sure to discuss the possible effects and how you plan 
to work them out with your agents.
 
✓ Action plan: Lay out the next steps you plan to take and the key mile-
stones to watch for. Also explain what you won’t be working on to rein-
force what isn’t changing. Even if your next step involves only creating a 
committee to plan the implementation, that step gives agents a sense of 
control and an opportunity to be involved.
 
 The leadership team needs to design some changes — such as staff 
reduction — without agent involvement.
 
✓ Degree of resistance: You need to gauge the level of resistance and 
potential opposition to the change at organizational level (you get differ-
ent responses in a bureaucratic culture compared with an entrepreneur-
ial startup) and at employee level. Some company cultures don’t handle 
any change well, and in all companies, some people don’t handle it well.
If the call center employees aren’t accepting change well, you usually can 
look to the elements of the Rule of Change Success to understand why. If 
you don’t understand how these elements work in your call center, even 
weak opposition to change could hamper your success in implementing that 
change.
Reducing Resistance to Change
Resistance to change is natural. (We discuss agent resistance to changes 
in “Knowing how people react to change,” earlier in this chapter.) Follow 
the best practices that we talk about in the following sections to reduce the 
degree of resistance.
Earn — and keep — agents’ trust
Organizations that have high levels of trust between employees and manage-
ment can almost always get through change more easily than organizations 
that have little or no trust. When you talk to them, agents really listen and 
know that you have their best interests at heart.

306
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
 
You can’t start earning trust at the point when you need to impose the big 
change; make trust a preexisting condition.
You earn the trust of your agents over a long period by building strong rela-
tionships with them and — most important — keeping your promises. This 
idea sounds simple (you probably remember hearing it in grade school), but 
a history of broken promises is a certain trust-buster.
Reducing agents’ resistance to change also involves including them in the 
process: communicating with them early, openly, and honestly; respecting 
their points of view and their emotions; setting the context for why the call 
center needs change; and helping them understand the effect of the change.
If you’re not sure whether your organization’s trust level may hold back 
future change initiatives, you may want to find out. Consider the following:
 
✓ Think about the last change that you implemented. Experience may 
help you predict the future, so figure out how many agents expressed 
satisfaction and happiness with past changes. If you received little posi-
tive feedback, and adaptation took a long time, you may have to build up 
more trust before you make the next change.
 
✓ Do an anonymous agent survey. This survey can measure satisfaction 
with the past few changes and get honest answers to questions about 
those changes and their effects. Specifically, ask whether the agent’s 
team leader was clear, honest, and trustworthy during recent changes. 
Ask at least one open-ended question to capture comments and reac-
tions that you can’t anticipate.
 
✓ Bring in an expert. Hire a third-party expert on change leadership. 
(Often, consulting companies provide this service.) Have the expert do a 
full analysis of your call center’s ability to accept change and train man-
agement in methods for implementing future change.
Communicate well
In the absence of factual information, people get together and make up stories 
to fill in the information gap (and their stories are usually worse than reality). 
As a leader, you need to communicate change to your agents effectively.
Communicate accurately
If you create a communication plan that contains omissions, confusing data 
or charts, formulas that no one can decipher, vague references to the future, 
or just too much information, you make all the other best practices less effec-
tive. Spend enough time to build the communication template, test-drive it 

307
 Chapter 16: Mastering Change in Your Organization
with your peers, edit as required for your agents, and communicate in phases 
so that agents start with the big picture and get more details later.
Communicate completely
If you want change success, you need to communicate completely with 
your agents. Partial explanations typically lead to confusion and sometimes 
mistrust.
In Figure 16-1, the pie chart includes all the pieces of complete communica-
tion. Note: Most managers report on the “what” and “when” of a change, but 
they should also include context — the “why” and the “how.”

Figure 16-2 illustrates that if you start communicating during the planning 
stage as opposed to during implementation, you get several benefits:
 
✓ Agents feel that you’re collaborating with them — not doing something 
to them.
 
✓ You control the message before the rumor mill takes control away 
from you.

308
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
 
✓ The four stages of acceptance (which we talk about in “Stages of reac-
tion to change,” earlier in this chapter) starts at this early point, and 
by the time the change arrives, many agents have already accepted the 
change.
 
✓ You can get smart insights from those who are affected by the change 
about how to manage the change better. Your team may not have con-
trol of whether the change moves forward, but using agent input always 
creates a better implementation plan.

Communicate frequently
Managers need the patience to communicate until agents accept the change 
to the required degree. Some agents accept the change at the first announce-
ment; some need to hear about the change, think about it, ask a few ques-
tions, and then accept it; and some may not accept it until you have it in 
place and everyone else is already doing it.
The chart in Figure 16-3 shows example agents and how much time they’ve 
needed to accept change in the past. Mike (who has a generally high resis-
tance to change) needs more information before he can accept the change. 
Bob, on the other hand, generally likes and accepts change quickly; he’s less 
risk-averse than Mike is.
How much you communicate with an agent often depends on the complex-
ity of the issue, how much information the agent needs to understand, and 
whether the change will create a negative effect on someone. In the High-
Impact Change column in Figure 16-3, Mary needs a long acceptance cycle 
(longer than her normal response), almost equal to Mike (the risk-averse 
guy). Some part of this specific high-impact change felt risky or negative to 
Mary. The opposite occurred for Edith, who accepted the high-impact change 
more quickly than her norm.

No matter how well you handle the situation, some people always resist 
change. If some agents resist months after everyone else has accepted the 
change, be blunt. Let them know that if they’re going to remain productively 
on the team, it’s time to accept the change; then get them to agree to do so.
 
Leading change doesn’t involve only your agents, but also your peers and 
managers senior to you in the call center. They have similar emotional 
responses to your agents when it comes to not knowing what’s happening, 
feeling that they haven’t been consulted, or wondering what advantages they 
can get from the change.
Show empathy
You can’t focus only on facts; emotions play the biggest role in the four 
stages of acceptance (discussed in “Stages of reaction to change,” earlier in 
this chapter). Often, agents don’t even need an answer, new facts, or a solu-
tion; they just want you to listen while they sort things out for themselves.
After you announce a change, plan time to follow up with people individually 
so that you can find out how they feel about the change and whether you can 
answer any questions they may have. Announce facts and context in a group, 
but handle emotions one person at a time.
 
Be careful not to confuse what your agents say with how they say it. Also, you 
need to be patient; some of your agents may have trouble expressing them-
selves, so their points may sound abrupt or negative, but they may have great 
ideas if you listen without becoming defensive.

310
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
Identify and work with influential agents
An influential agent — one whom other agents respect and listen to — can 
provide support for the change you need to implement. You might recruit 
this person early in the change process so that she can help explain the 
message about the positive aspects of the change. An influential agent who 
opposed change in the past but agrees with the need for this particular 
change can influence a group of fence-sitters, because they respect her for 
not always agreeing with everything.
Try to get influential agents to join validation groups. Give these group mem-
bers a sneak peek at the change; then ask them to help you refine the change 
and communicate it to the rest of the staff. You can have a truly effective 
team meeting when, say, 4 of 18 agents are already on your side and can help 
with the question-and-answer session.
Building trust through communication
Bernie Herenberg, an associate of Winston’s, 
worked as a call center manager for a Canadian 
not-for-profit organization and had to merge 
the organization’s donations-processing team 
with its call centers. Several cross-country 
branches had to be centralized with the full 
commitment of staff.
Herenberg did several things to tackle the 
issues:
 ✓ He visited the regional offices to meet and 
reassure staff members. He explained the 
plan for centralization, listened to agents’ 
concerns, and promoted the benefits of the 
planned national contact center.
 ✓ He worked with the managers of each 
center to develop guiding principles, agree 
on allocation of work for extended hours, 
and determine what new skills agents 
would need to service customers from 
across the country.
 ✓ When talking with agents, he described 
the department mergers as an arranged 
marriage, adding that many cultures have 
a high arranged-marriage success rate 
and that love grows over time. The humor 
helped reduce resistance.
 ✓ He submitted an article about the project to 
internal publications.
 ✓ When each province transitioned success-
fully, he sent announcements to all staff 
members. Each small success built support 
and lowered resistance for the next team.
Ultimately, the centers merged successfully — 
on time and with a lot of staff support.

311
 Chapter 16: Mastering Change in Your Organization
 
Don’t ignore those agents who are respectfully critical but also respected 
among their peers as informal leaders. When they agree to support the 
change, others will follow.
Involve the team
Many changes (such as systems upgrades and process fixes), which are 
never completely figured out when they reach your operation, require final 
input from your agents. You need to involve the agents in finalizing the 
details, fixing the errors in real time, or seeking clarification about how to 
implement the change.
Some new programs, such as establishing home agents (see Chapter 11), 
need agent involvement starting very early in the change. You can safely start 
with a relatively small number of agents transitioning to working at home. 
You’re likely to find a small number of agents who want to participate while 
the other agents wait to see how the change turns out.
Launch a pilot program
A pilot program allows staff members to participate — not in the initial 
decision, but in the implementation and refinement of the decision. A pilot 
program lets you try out a planned change and see how it goes. If it doesn’t 
work, you can discuss with your agents what they think you need to do dif-
ferently. Giving your agents input in the process can minimize their anxiety 
about the change.

Quality-Control Programs 
and Certifications
In This Chapter
▶ Getting your management team certified
▶ Developing a quality-control program
▶ Finding call center support services
I
n the service world — and the call center industry in particular — the 
meaning of quality has changed from the original dictionary definition of 
“an inherent or distinguishing characteristic of something (or someone).” 
Quality has come to mean something of superior grade, as in a quality wine. 
So when people talk of improving quality, it’s kind of like saying seeking 
perfection — or, as we define it in this book, continuously improving.
In many organizations, quality control is a system for ensuring the main-
tenance of proper standards, which we interpret as a system designed to 
ensure continuous process improvement. We define and discuss process 
improvement in some detail in Chapter 15. In this chapter, you can find sug-
gestions and resources to help ensure that process improvement happens in 
your center.
Certifying Your Management Team
Certification involves taking your existing, new, or potential call center man-
agement through a training program that covers call center definitions, con-
cepts, and practices. You want to produce a management team that’s familiar 
with call center operations and skilled in managing call center processes so 
that each operation achieves excellent results.

314
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
Call center management certification isn’t new, but its popularity has 
exploded in recent years — which is a good thing, because certification can 
enhance the performance of your management team by providing them the 
knowledge, skills, and tools they need to run your call center efficiently.
The increase in demand for this type of program is largely a response to a 
shortage of skilled call center managers. The diversity of skills and knowl-
edge required — from managing service level and occupancy (see Chapter 6) 
to labor relations and the psychology of motivation — make call center man-
agement a fairly specialized profession.
 
A good certification program can take smart people and develop them into 
competent call center operators.
In-house versus external programs
Certification programs come in two varieties: homegrown and external. Don’t 
assume that a program’s no good just because it was developed in-house; 
good programs can be created internally or purchased externally. If you get 
external help from people who’ve already gone through the process of creat-
ing the course, you can benefit from training based on industry standards. 
This training helps your staff adapt to new work methods and technology, 
and you can tailor it to meet your requirements, saving you a lot of time and 
trouble.
 
You can find a handy-dandy reference of certification-program suppliers in 
Appendix B.
A course is a course, of course, 
of course . . .
To develop a good program, assume that participants know very little about 
call centers. Start with the basics so that you can use your certification 
course as indoctrination for managers who are new to the call center envi-
ronment (meaning smart people hired to perform call center management 
functions).
 
Going beyond the basics, you may want to create a general call center man-
agement certification program, targeted to managers and executives who need 
an overall understanding of how the call center operates.

315
 Chapter 17: Quality-Control Programs and Certifications
Here are some topics you might include in your certification course:
 
✓ Call center definitions
 
✓ The business model, mission, and vision
 
✓ Call center business goals and metrics
 
✓ Unique call center concepts, such as managing service levels and 
occupancy
 
✓ Call center logistics (location, building, setup, and so on)
 
✓ Organizational structure, roles, and responsibilities
 
✓ The uses and benefits of technology in the call center
 
✓ Supervision and agent performance management, including labor 
relations
 
✓ Call center budgeting models
 
✓ Forecasting and scheduling
 
✓ Quality assurance
 
✓ Process management, including policies, procedures, and best practices
 
✓ Legislation that affects the call center
 
✓ Important skills for team leaders
 
✓ Priorities and use of time — a clear description of a day in the life of a 
front-line manager that defines roles and responsibilities, priorities, and 
use of time
 
✓ Behavioral skills, such as role modeling and developing direct reports
Courses that provide a general overview can take a week to complete. In each 
module (self-contained course unit), however, you can go into a great deal 
of depth, making the course considerably longer. Each module should cover 
several training goals.
 
A more feasible approach involves creating a separate certification course 
for each discipline within the call center, such as forecasting and scheduling, 
team leader and agent performance management, analysis and reporting, and 
technology management. Then you can prioritize the courses as optional, 
suggested, or required for specific roles within your center. Forecasting and 
scheduling courses would be required for the folks on your resource manage-
ment team, for example.

316
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
Who should attend management 
certification courses?
Certification programs can help smart new managers run all or part of your 
call center operations. Those managers may have been transferred from 
other departments, promoted from within, or recruited from other compa-
nies; they may have good management credentials but little or no call center 
experience.
Senior managers who are responsible for call center operations can also 
benefit from certification programs because these programs provide clear 
performance standards. Executives who just got the responsibility of running 
the call center, for example, may use these programs to familiarize them-
selves with the day-to-day operations of running a call center, and executives 
who’ve worked in call centers for some time and want to make sense of the 
operation can benefit from getting a refresher on the technical side of the 
center.
Finally, certification can help call center agents, team leaders, and junior 
managers achieve a better overall understanding of call center operations. 
It can also be a great career move for these employees, setting them up for 
advancement after they successfully complete the course.
Instituting a Quality-Control Program
You can do a great deal on your own to improve processes (see Chapter 15) 
and ensure quality control within your call center. Still, you can find people 
out there who are certified in quality-control programs, helping you better 
understand your business’s processes and build systems of improvement so 
that you can identify gaps in your processes and then implement solutions to 
improve those processes.
 
If you turn to one of these organizations, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. 
Such an organization can implement time-tested methods in your company 
quickly, allowing you to start improving your operation sooner and probably 
with a better-defined approach than if you’d built a quality-control program 
on your own. Try to get someone senior in your organization to sponsor this 
program so that you can get the resources you need to build and run your 
quality-control program.
Because of their methodology and inherent metrics, quality-control programs 
provide numerous benefits, including the following:

317
 Chapter 17: Quality-Control Programs and Certifications
 
✓ They offer a standardized approach to problem-solving.
 
✓ They improve operational efficiencies by raising productivity and lower-
ing costs.
 
✓ They often include rigorous reporting, data gathering, and disciplined 
documentation, helping you determine a point of reference for measur-
ing performance improvements and allowing the business to be certified 
as a quality-regulated organization.
 
✓ They help businesses demonstrate that they comply with industry oper-
ating standards or regulations.
In the following sections, we discuss some of the quality-control programs 
that are most commonly used in the call center industry.
ISO 9001/2000
ISO 9001/2000 is an international standard for the creation and maintenance 
of a quality-assurance system within a company. This standard, developed by 
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO; www.iso.org), pro-
vides a template for building and documenting a quality-control system.
Key elements of ISO 9001/2000 include standards for training employees, 
maintenance of equipment, recordkeeping, inspection of processes, cus-
tomer relations, and continuous improvement. You can ensure adherence to 
these standards by allowing a third-party, ISO-accredited auditor to conduct 
an annual audit.
 
ISO certification doesn’t ensure that your company has high-quality products 
or services. It merely provides a means to ensure that your company docu-
ments and follows its own internal procedures, including those for correcting 
problems and improving processes. “Say what you do and do what you say” is 
a common ISO motto.
You can tailor ISO to the call center environment, integrating measurable 
outputs of success. You, as the user, have to determine what those outputs 
should be.
If you want to standardize and document work processes, ISO can help you 
reach that goal, but ISO is the beginning — not the end — of process manage-
ment and control. (We talk about process management in Chapter 15.)
If you’re interested in using ISO, be aware that it’s not a quick process; con-
verting your processes to the ISO standard may take a year or more. The 
more you have documented already, the better.

318
Part V: Ensuring Continuous Improvement 
 
You need a consultant and a third-party auditor (called a registrar) to get ISO-
certified. We offer some suggestions on where to find these resources in 
Appendix B.
COPC-2000
Created in 1995, Customer Operations Performance Center, Inc. (COPC) is 
a privately held customer service support company that defines industry 
standards for call center excellence. COPC certifies organizations to the call 
center–specific COPC-2000 standard. This standard focuses on measurable 
criteria in the areas of customer service, customer satisfaction, and opera-
tional efficiency, and on the application of effective processes in those areas.
A committee made up of industry professionals from high-profile organizations 
that use and purchase call center services maintains the COPC-2000 standard.
COPC-2000 was originally intended for use in evaluating third-party providers 
of call center services, but it has evolved into a standard that’s used by both 
in-house and external/outsourced call center operations.
For more information on COPC and on COPC-2000, visit www.copc.com.
Six Sigma
Six Sigma is a quality-control program that uses data and statistical analy-
sis to improve efficiency and control, and reduce variation, in business 
processes for the purpose of increasing profits, customer satisfaction, and 
employee morale.
Criticisms of ISO certification
The application of ISO certification to call 
centers has generated some criticism. Some 
observers suggest that it’s a manufacturing 
standard that isn’t suited to service operations 
such as call centers; others argue that ISO 
doesn’t focus enough on measurable outputs, 
especially quality outputs. Also, some compa-
nies simply fake their adherence to ISO just for 
the purpose of marketing themselves as ISO 
shops, and when a registrar audits their quality 
systems, these companies try to cover up the 
fact that they haven’t been faithful to it.
Although all these criticisms are legitimate, 
they’re probably not fair in their assessment 
of the standard. As with many business prac-
tices, if you use an ISO framework in a sincere 
attempt to build a structure for documenting 
work processes, it’s a great tool that can lead 
to substantial process improvements in your 
organization. It certainly has in ours.

319
 Chapter 17: Quality-Control Programs and Certifications
Six Sigma, which literally means six standard deviations, refers to the reduc-
tion of errors to six standard deviations from the center of process output, 
which translates to about 3.4 defects per million outputs (approximately 
none!). Imagine your call center having fewer than four bad calls per million 
customer interactions.
In the call center, a defect occurs when a customer call ends without the 
desired outcome for the customer or the organization, probably resulting in 
an unsatisfied customer. Indicators of call defects include abandoned calls, 
repeat calls, customer complaints, low customer satisfaction scores, and 
errors in call-monitoring scores. Defects occur because of inadequacies in 
the call-handling process and your internal processes, and because of errors 
made by your call center agents. Identifying your levels of defects and group-
ing them by cause can help you start to reduce these defects and create 
improved customer satisfaction.
 
A detailed discussion of Six Sigma is beyond the scope of this book, but you 
can find much more information in Six Sigma For Dummies, by Craig Gygi, Neil 
DeCarlo, and Bruce Williams (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Finding Other Sources of Help
Over the past decade, call center management has become a discipline and 
industry unto itself — a very large industry. As a result, subindustries have 
developed solely for the purpose of providing call center support. The fol-
lowing sections discuss some resources that can help you meet your call 
center’s goals.
Consulting firms
Call center consulting services have become readily available through a vari-
ety of firms, covering everything from general call center management and 
technology to very specific disciplines such as call handling, location selec-
tion and development, recruitment, and scheduling.
Most large consulting firms have a division of experts who can help you with 
your call center projects. You can also find a lot of small, independent call 
center consulting and support companies.
We provide a list of some places to look for call center support in Appendix B. 
An Internet search for call center consulting can also give you a good place to 
start.

Trade shows
The number of call center trade shows has grown along with the industry 
itself. These shows take place around the world, often specializing in specific 
trends in the industry. They’re busy, fun, and often held in far-off exotic 
locations.
 
For information on call center trade shows, visit the Direct Marketing 
Association’s Web site at www.the-dma.org, or contact your local or 
regional call center association.
Trade magazines
You can buy trade magazines much more cheaply than you can attend trade 
shows. These magazines are full of great current information on the call 
center industry.
 
Everyone who’s responsible in any way for the operation of a call center — or 
a department within a call center — should subscribe to call center–industry 
and related magazines, such as those that focus on marketing or technology. 
A good trade magazine covers every hot issue, trend, and discipline of run-
ning call centers over the course of a one-year subscription. You can even get 
information from the advertisements, in which vendors strut their latest and 
greatest developments.
Here are some magazines that we like:
 
✓ Call Center Magazine: Archives at www.callcentermagazine.com
 
✓ Customer Interaction Solutions: www.tmcnet.com/call-center

call center industry that can boost your company’s 
revenue, efficiency, employee morale, and customer satis-
faction. The Part of Tens — a For Dummies tradition —

every call center manager should answer, and provides 
techniques for reducing costs and increasing efficiency.

Ten Ways to Improve Agents’ 
Job Satisfaction
In This Chapter
▶ Maximizing job satisfaction
▶ Treating employees as you’d want to be treated
▶ Encouraging two-way communication
▶ Creating a better working environment
I
n the business world, a generally accepted principle — which we agree 
with — says that companies that have happy employees tend to have 
happy customers. By improving your agents’ job satisfaction, you can likely 
improve your customers’ satisfaction as well.
In this chapter, we provide tips that can help you maximize your agents’ sat-
isfaction with their jobs.
Recruit People Who Value the Work
When recruiting, you need to look for two key things in a candidate: skill and 
motivation. (For more on recruiting, see Chapter 12.) Most employers know 
how to find candidates who have skill, but many employers have difficulty 
finding candidates with motivation.
 
Finding employees who value the work means that you have employees who 
continue to feel motivated after doing the job for some time. By choosing 
agents who have a positive outlook and energy, you set yourself up for suc-
cess in your center, even if some of those candidates don’t have all the skills 
that you need. By building a trusting relationship and employing good coach-
ing skills, you can quickly develop employees’ skills and keep their motiva-
tion high.

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The knee-jerk reaction is to hire the most skilled person who knocks on your 
door, but you often end up hiring a highly skilled person who’s between jobs. 
Don’t be surprised if such a person quits after finding a job elsewhere that he 
considers to be better.
Even worse than losing a skilled agent is hiring an unmotivated agent, who 
can end up resenting your call center work for not challenging her enough. 
This type of employee may quit emotionally but stay on the payroll.
Clarify Expectations
Tell your agents what your company expects of them and what they can get 
for meeting and exceeding those expectations. (We talk more about develop-
ing and communicating expectations in Chapter 3.)
Employees often fail to do what’s expected of them because no one tells 
them what’s expected of them. Be clear in your expectations — even before 
a potential agent accepts the job — so you can make sure that your agents 
aren’t disappointed (and you aren’t, either). Confusion about roles and con-
tributions frustrates everyone.
 
Clear expectations set the road for achievement, and your agents may feel an 
enhanced sense of job satisfaction when they meet those expectations.
Provide Thorough Job-Specific Training
Train your agents in the skills that they need to succeed in the call center. 
(See Chapter 12 for more on training.) Know the top ten reasons why your 
customers call, and be able to provide your newly hired agents the knowl-
edge and skills to answer these questions or solve these problems. Typically, 
your new-hire training involves imparting knowledge of products and pro-
cess, explaining how to use the computer systems, and training in basic cus-
tomer service and sales skills.
The key to coaching and building proficiency is working on one skill at a time. 
After an agent can consistently demonstrate the use of a skill, move on to the 
next skill that needs development until that agent has mastery of all service 
and sales skills.

325
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Improve Agents’ Job Satisfaction
Ask, Don’t Tell
Agents are more likely to change their behavior if you coach and lead them 
to discover the change themselves. In many centers, team leaders tell their 
agents what they should say or do; then they wonder why the requested 
changes don’t stick. Effective coaching sounds like a natural conversation, 
and it helps agents fully understand what they need to work on. When you 
add value to your agent by giving him a suggestion to do or say something 
very specific, he’ll welcome your input again and again. See Chapter 13 for a 
rundown of the principles of coaching.
 
Coaching can work only if a high level of trust exists between agents and their 
team leaders. An effective coach keeps her promises, pays attention to the 
small things that agents find important, and remains consistent in her interac-
tions with agents.
Remove Roadblocks to Success
Obstacles occur in almost every endeavor, and your agents will likely run 
into a lot of them. Common call center roadblocks include processes and 
tools that don’t work, policies that customers complain about, and unhelp-
ful management. Obstacles in themselves don’t demotivate staff, but if man-
agement does little to help remove them, agents can find roadblocks to be 
very demotivating. By removing roadblocks, you show your agents that you 
understand their challenges and are actively working to make their situations 
better.
Calm Fears
Call centers can become scary places for employees because they have a 
very high level of accountability, and in an increasingly competitive world, 
the drive for results is only increasing. Poorly trained or bad team leaders 
compound the problem of fear because they talk or act without thinking 
about the effect of their behavior on agents.
Fear makes people shut down, so they don’t express their feelings and often 
feel trapped. It dampens their enthusiasm and prevents innovation and 
improvement. Fear makes agents feel that they have no voice in the company 
or control of their jobs. A lot of good people leave call center jobs because 
of fear.

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Your management team must step in to ensure that hard-working employees 
don’t have to be afraid that if they make a mistake, they may lose their jobs. 
You can reduce fear by using the change management techniques discussed 
in Chapter 16.
 
Adapt policies to ensure that accountability goes both ways. Agents are 
accountable for doing their best in their positions, and management is 
accountable for contributing to agents’ success.
You can use regular (at least quarterly) employee opinion surveys to ensure 
that your call center maintains a fear-free culture. Make team leaders respon-
sible for the job satisfaction of the employees they supervise. Also, exit inter-
views can help determine how successful management has been in creating a 
supportive working environment. Check out Chapter 14 for tips on creating a 
motivated workforce.
 
Establishing an appeals process can ensure that you address agent dissatisfac-
tion and maintain employee rights. If it’s done well, this process can go a long 
way toward reducing agent anxiety in the workplace. Make the appeals pro-
cess well-thought-out and well-designed, and train the staff in how to use it.
Don’t Ask Agents to Do Anything 
You Wouldn’t Want to Do
Set an example by doing some of the tough work that you ask your agents to 
do, such as answering calls from angry customers or making cold calls.
 
Have your team leaders do an agent’s job from time to time; it can really help 
build a bridge between agents and the leadership team. Some of the very best 
team leaders sit down in an agent’s seat to demonstrate a technique or a spe-
cific skill. By taking this approach, the team leader can quickly get the respect 
of call center agents and move the coaching from something theoretical to 
something practical that agents can actually achieve.
Communicate Honestly
Effective communication is critical to agent job satisfaction. If you’ve worked 
in a call center for any length of time, you can probably attest that call cen-
ters are rumor machines, which isn’t surprising when you consider that so 
many people are brought together in one place.

327
 Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Improve Agents’ Job Satisfaction
 
By using team meetings, e-mail, portals, internal Web sites, and chat sessions, 
you can communicate openly and honestly — and a lot. The more information 
that you communicate to agents, the less active the rumor mill will become.
Ask for Feedback
Communication needs to go both ways. On a regular basis (we suggest 
monthly), ask employees for their feedback on whether management is creating 
a healthy and effective workplace. You should ask a variety of questions, but 
the one that’s most important finds out whether employees value their jobs.
Also provide a mechanism for employees to give open-ended comments and 
suggestions. You may have to make the survey anonymous. Even in the best 
environments, some people don’t feel comfortable opening up completely.
Based on the findings of your employee satisfaction survey, pick out spe-
cific positive and negative trends. Work to either improve the most critical 
areas, as defined by your employees, or communicate why these things are 
the way they are. In subsequent months, add specific questions to the feed-
back forms regarding key areas of dissatisfaction so that you can figure out 
whether your agents feel that you’re improving the work environment and 
overall employee satisfaction. Chapter 14 provides more information about 
employee surveys.
 
Tying part of team leaders’ rewards to employee satisfaction engages the 
entire management team in improving job satisfaction.
Be Positive
In call centers, you can track accountability easily, and in the quest for con-
stant improvement, you may tend to focus on things that aren’t right. This 
narrow focus, however, can lead you and your team leaders to concentrate 
mainly on catching people doing something wrong. Although you may adopt 
this management style with good intentions, it’s inherently negative and can 
dampen enthusiasm and morale.
Constant improvement is a worthy goal. When your suggestions for improve-
ment come in a predominantly positive environment, employees receive 
them much more enthusiastically. (We talk more about process improvement 
in Chapter 15.)

328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
As basic as it may sound, we subscribe to the idea of a 10-to-1 positive-to-nega-
tive ratio. Give people in the office ten pieces of positive reinforcement for 
every suggestion for improvement, and frame suggestions for improvement in 
a positive manner (“Jane, you’re already good at this. Imagine what can 
happen when you start following the troubleshooting guidelines!”).
You should be able to offer encouragement easily. Catch people doing some-
thing right! If you can’t easily find things to praise, you’re not doing enough 
to create a positive environment.
 
We’re not suggesting that you don’t hold employees accountable. You just 
need to create accountability in a very positive environment.

Ten Questions Every Call Center 
Manager Should Answer
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the role of your call center
▶ Determining your call center’s key goals
▶ Making the call center well-run and well-prepared
▶ Dealing effectively with changes
M
anaging a call center can be a rewarding and exciting job. If you want 
to be a successful call center manager, you need to know the answers 
to the important questions that we cover in this chapter.
How Does Your Call Center Fit into 
the Bigger Company Picture?
You can easily forget that a call center is a cog in the wheel of a larger enter-
prise. Everything starts with understanding how the call center fits into the 
big picture and answering the question “What does the business need the 
call center to do?”
If you run a specific business’s call center, your direction comes from the 
senior executives to whom you report. If you run an outsourced call center, 
your direction comes from your client. In either case, you need clearly 
defined marching orders, ideally detailed in some form of service-level agree-
ment that spells out the operating commitments between two internal teams. 
(We cover service levels in Chapter 6.)

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
With direction from the company that your call center is part of, you can 
define optimal service levels, the types of support that you offer to callers, 
the types of skills your employees need, and the kinds of tools that you need 
to fulfill your mission. No matter what type of operation you run, you must 
work through these issues with your internal clients and get the funding to 
create the operation that the business needs.
Why Are People Calling You?
First, by analyzing call driver reports, determine the top reasons why cus-
tomers call; then drill deeper into each reason. If customers most often call 
to get billing information, for example, you can segment billing reasons into 
specific types of billing calls (the customer didn’t understand the bill, the bill 
came late, the bill contained inaccurate charges, and so on).
Analyzing call drivers is one of your top ten management activities: It allows 
you to cut costs now and make operations more efficient in the future.
 
Understanding historical call types also helps you forecast staffing and the 
facilities’ needs. (We talk more about forecasting in Chapter 7.) The call center 
scheduler uses call types to forecast future demand — which is especially 
important in the short term. Any given day may have a higher or lower call 
volume than forecast. The better you understand why volume is high or low, 
the better you can decide what to do about being understaffed or overstaffed.
What’s Your Ideal Service-Level 
Objective?
You need to set a service-level objective — a call center term meaning your 
target for the percentage of calls that you answer within a specified period.
Often, call centers go with the crowd, setting the service-level objective at 
the industry average. Frequently, 80/20 (80 percent of calls answered within 
20 seconds) becomes the default target, for no other reason than so many 
companies use it.
Although 80/20 is a good level of service, it may not be appropriate for your 
company. In an emergency-response call center, for example, 80/20 isn’t good 
enough. Also, if a call center provides a very popular free service for which 
callers are willing to wait, 80/20 might be too costly.

331
 Chapter 19: Ten Questions Every Call Center Manager Should Answer
 
Understanding this analysis (which we discuss in Chapter 6) arms you with 
knowledge of the right level of performance, as well as good reasons why your 
call center needs to achieve that level of performance.

Call Center for One Hour?
When you know the total cost of running your call center for an hour — and 
you need to consider all the costs, not just direct labor — you can quickly 
assess the benefits of a variety of business solutions, from the cost of an 
interactive voice response (IVR; see Chapter 9) system to outsourcing.
Understanding the components of cost per hour can really help you bring 
your costs down by eliminating inefficiencies. We discuss cost per hour in 
more detail in Chapter 6 and outsourcing in Chapter 5.
Are Your Employees Happy?
Too much change, unstable systems, poor implementations, and angry 
customers can all make employees unhappy. Whatever the reason, if your 
employees aren’t happy, they aren’t at their best when working with your 
customers. Not every day needs to be a love-in at your call center, but the 
work environment does need to be fair and challenging, with the occasional 
spark of excitement and fun.
 
The topic of understanding and affecting employee morale is a large one and 
could fill an entire book on its own — specifically, Motivating Employees For 
Dummies, by Max Messmer (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
We want to point to one issue specifically: Employees often feel dissatisfied 
if they have poor relationships with their team leaders. A team leader needs 
to motivate and accelerate the skill level of her agents, which happens only if 
that team leader spends time coaching those agents. If a team leader consis-
tently adds value to every interaction with her agents, those agents feel ener-
gized about the work and are willing to tackle new assignments and deliver 
high-quality service to customers.
No single activity can improve employee morale more than coaching by team 
leaders, but team leaders need the specific skills to coach well (see Chapter 13). 
Bring in the necessary expertise to help your team leaders be leaders.

What Will the Call Center Look 
Like in 12 to 18 Months?
Most call center forecasting and scheduling focuses on the relatively near 
term — from tomorrow to a few months from now — but call center manag-
ers need to have a slightly longer-term view as well. (We talk more about 
forecasting in Chapter 7.)
Major changes in caller demand, process, or products that your company 
offers require a good deal of planning, particularly if the changes require 
expansion, training, or new technology.
 
Failure to prepare results in a last-minute urgent rush to adapt, which causes 
stress on the call center’s employees and degraded levels of customer service. 
The larger the change, the greater the effect of being unprepared.
 
Forecasting for the long term doesn’t need to be difficult. Organize regular 
meetings with key people in the organization who might know about midterm 
changes that could affect the call center, such as the senior executive in charge 
of the call center or someone in marketing. With a broad understanding of 
what might be coming, you can work with your business analyst and scheduler 
to determine the effect of the changes. Then you can prepare your proposals 
or business plans for presentation to the senior people in the organization.
What Legislation Affects 
Your Call Center?
Call center management is becoming an exercise in risk management. Look 
no further than the do-not-call legislation affecting the call center industry.
You need to know about these laws and take steps to make sure that you 
comply with them. Better yet, hire a compliance officer, and make that 
person responsible for understanding the laws and making you comply, or 
get a compliance officer and a good lawyer.
Some areas of the law that you need to be concerned with include
 
✓ Privacy
 
✓ Outbound sales

333
 Chapter 19: Ten Questions Every Call Center Manager Should Answer
 
✓ Labor
 
✓ Human rights
We talk more about call center legislation in Chapter 15.
How Does Technology Affect 
Your Call Center?
The developers of new technology address the demands of call centers in 
increasingly creative ways, as we describe in Chapter 9.
 
If you understand your call center process, as well as your operation’s metrics 
and how to influence them, you can quickly identify the technologies that can 
improve your call center and drive results.
Call centers can often implement technology that pays for itself in one year. 
First, to keep capital expenses low, look for opportunities in old and proven 
technologies; then consider new technologies that can save you operating 
costs or deliver a higher level of service. You can’t implement everything, but a 
few well-placed investments can make a big difference in efficiency or quality.
You need to consider some caveats before making tech changes:
 
✓ How the technology can affect the drivers of your operation: Your 
drivers include call length, calls per customer, occupancy, cost per 
hour, conversion rate, revenue per sale, employee satisfaction, and cus-
tomer satisfaction.
 
✓ Proof that the technology can get results: Who has used this technol-
ogy? What results did they get?
 
 A lot of expensive technology that never realized its promise is sitting in 
call centers. Excitement about unsubstantiated claims can lead to a pre-
mature purchase.
 
✓ Training for call center employees: You can’t effectively implement 
most technology in a vacuum. People in the call center need to under-
stand the technology, what it does, how it works, and how they need to 
interact with it.

What’s Your Disaster Recovery Plan?
Ask some people what a disaster recovery plan is, and they envision some 
type of James Bond scene in which the camera pans over a hidden lair — 
probably under a volcano — where the world’s coolest agents take customer 
calls. The reality of disaster recovery planning is simpler (and, we admit, less 
cool).
You start a disaster recovery plan by first focusing on business continuity — 
planning how to keep your services available if you experience short, tempo-
rary outages (perhaps due to power failures or inclement weather) and then 
determining what to do during a prolonged outage and how to get back on 
your feet after power is restored. We discuss instituting a disaster recovery 
plan in Chapter 4.
 
For full details on this subject, see IT Disaster Recovery Planning For Dummies, 
by Peter Gregory, CISA, CISSP (Wiley).
What Are Your Three Initiatives 
for Improvement?
We like call centers that run effectively, and we really like call centers that 
are always evolving and improving. In the long run, the call centers that insti-
tute a culture of learning and improvement always seem to receive industry 
awards and rate high in customer-satisfaction surveys. Imagine that!
The managers of these centers frequently have ongoing initiatives — the 
things they’re working on or planning that can lead to improvements in call 
center results. Often, team leaders and employees get excited about these 
initiatives; they can’t wait until they can get the initiatives implemented and 
running. Not all initiatives work perfectly, of course, but constant innovation 
leads to successful initiatives that make these call centers leaders in their 
industry.

Chapter 20
Almost Ten Ways to Decrease 
Call Center Costs and Increase 
Efficiency
In This Chapter
▶ Improving efficiency and reducing costs while maintaining service
▶ Understanding the importance of mapping processes
▶ Reducing the number of unnecessary calls
G
enerally speaking, call centers provide a very efficient way to communi-
cate with a large number of customers. Because call center operations 
frequently cost companies a lot of money, however, owners or leaders usu-
ally scrutinize those costs closely.
In this chapter, we provide some tips for improving efficiencies and decreas-
ing overall call center costs.
Improve Call Control
In most call centers, implementing an effective call-control strategy can have 
an immediate effect, because reducing call length without sacrificing service 
is an effective way to reduce costs.
Most agents work hard to provide good service, and perhaps to sell addi-
tional products or services to customers, but many lack a structured plan 
that can guide a call to a successful conclusion. Some agents feel that if they 
control the call, they’re not delivering good service; some even consider han-
dling a call quickly to be rude, and as a result, their calls frequently wander. 
Training your agents in simple call-control techniques makes a significant dif-
ference in the length of each call. We talk more about training in Chapter 12.

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
You can help agents with call control by developing a customer-experience 
blueprint, as described in Chapter 15. This blueprint shows agents how to 
handle a call so that they can create an exceptional customer experience. The 
content of the blueprint doesn’t deal with a specific call type, but with the spe-
cific phases that a good call should go through.
Effective coaching by team leaders (see Chapter 13) can help agents figure 
out how to control the call, reduce call length, and increase customer 
satisfaction.
Map and Improve Call Processes
Mapping your processes for handling various types of customer calls can 
help agents know exactly what they’re supposed to do in a particular call 
situation. For a more complete discussion of how to map processes, see 
Chapter 15.
Start by identifying the eight to ten primary reasons why customers call. 
Then sit down with a group of agents, a team leader or two, and a trainer to 
map out (on paper or in software) how an agent needs to handle each type 
of call.
After you map the top call types, you can ask the group, “How might an agent 
answer this call more quickly, and how might he prevent the customer from 
calling back?” Simplifying and improving call processes can result in tremen-
dous improvements in call length and other goals.
Achieve Your Service-Level Objective
A good service-level objective (a target that you set to measure how fast your 
call center answers the phone) creates a balance between the benefits and 
the costs associated with answering the phone quickly. See Chapter 6 for 
more information on assessing your service-level objectives.
 
Understanding the optimal service-level objective or sweet spot — the point 
where you maximize customer satisfaction while minimizing costs — can help 
you control costs. If you want to have your call center agents answer calls 
very quickly, you need a lot of agents waiting for customers at every hour of 
the day, which adds cost. In Chapter 6, we describe how to do a cost–benefit 
analysis to find your sweet spot.

337
 Chapter 20: Almost Ten Ways to Decrease Costs and Increase Efficiency
After your call center achieves the optimal rate, you can still gain efficiency 
by delivering this level of service as consistently as possible. The less devia-
tion from the optimal service level you have, the better. As a result, call 
center occupancy increases, and costs decrease.
Make Your Call Center Bigger
You can increase occupancy (how many minutes an agent talks to customers 
in a typical hour) without sacrificing customer satisfaction or service level by 
making your call center bigger. As you can read in Chapter 6, big call centers 
are more efficient than small centers. In large centers, you have a higher level 
of occupancy for the same level of service.
 
If your call center runs separate call-handling groups (customer service and 
collections, for example), by merging these two groups, you can take advan-
tage of the economies of scale that big call centers have.
You can make your call center bigger so that you can benefit from improved 
agent occupancy by blending, or combining work in your inbound call-handling 
queue. A classic example of blending involves mixing outbound calling into an 
inbound sales or service queue. In this case, you use agent idle time — time 
that agents spend waiting for incoming calls — to do your outbound work. As 
a result, your agents are busier (more occupied) overall. If inbound volumes 
increase (or spike), your agents stop making outbound calls while they handle 
the inbound calls.
 
Blended work can include outbound collections calls, customer service, wel-
come calls, or telemarketing. You can also blend other types of work, such as 
answering e-mail or regular mail. Remember always to give priority to answer-
ing inbound calls!
Use Skills-Based Routing
After you analyze the types of calls you receive and the processes you need 
to handle each call, you can group work by required skill level. Simpler call 
types might go to one skill level (maybe to newer agents) and more compli-
cated or challenging calls to another skill level. Skills-based routing — sending 
calls of specific types to agents who have the appropriate skills — can give 
you a lift in occupancy. We talk more about skills-based routing in Chapter 9.

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Be careful not to go overboard in creating different skill levels. Skills-based 
routing still amounts to creating separate call-answering groups, so it’s not as 
efficient as using one large pool of agents.
The closer you get to one skill group, the simpler organizing your inbound 
calls becomes and the higher your overall occupancy is, as long as your staff 
can handle the added complexity.
Turn Idle Time into Training Time
Even in large, efficient call centers, idle time makes up 15 percent or more 
of an agent’s time on the phones. In an agent’s standard eight-hour shift, 
15 percent idle time equates to more than one hour doing nothing but wait-
ing for calls. Instead of having agents wait, maybe you can use that time for 
something more valuable, such as modularized training that’s ready to go 
whenever call volumes drop. This practice allows a team leader to take a few 
agents off the phones to work on very specific skills or knowledge.
A few companies have experimented with turning some of their agents’ idle 
time into training time by using special technology. Some training applica-
tions monitor the activity of agents who work in a call-answering queue. 
When the application recognizes that an agent has sufficient idle time, it 
sends training material to that agent’s desktop and headset.
Eliminate Unnecessary Calls
Your call center receives unnecessary calls for a variety of reasons, includ-
ing agents who handle calls poorly on the first attempt, confusing marketing 
materials, and incorrect or confusing invoices. Reducing unnecessary calls 
gives you a basic way to make your call center more efficient. Nothing saves 
money like not having to answer the call at all!
Here are three quick fixes to help reduce the number of unnecessary calls in 
your call center:
 
✓ Implement an interactive voice response (IVR) system. As we discuss 
in Chapter 9, an IVR system gives customers a fast and efficient means 
of self-serving simple calling needs, such as accessing account balances, 
getting general information, and even ordering products and services. 
Also, an IVR system can handle calls around the clock.

339
 Chapter 20: Almost Ten Ways to Decrease Costs and Increase Efficiency
 
 Depending on the environment, an IVR system can handle 5 percent to 
25 percent (or more) of your call center’s call volume. You get a tremen-
dous payback from reducing the number of agents (and the cost of their 
wages), making IVR one of the most cost-effective investments that you 
can make.
 
✓ Transition customers to online self-service. Many businesses allow cus-
tomers to complete relatively complex transactions on the Web. Having 
a customer do the work himself can save tremendous costs (more than 
by using IVR) if you can persuade him to use a self-service system on the 
Web. Customers may find this method to be convenient because online 
services are available around the clock.
 
✓ Analyze why customers are calling. A slightly more complex way to 
reduce unnecessary calls involves tracking the reasons for the calls. 
Knowing why customers call can allow you to analyze the root cause 
and, in many cases, eliminate the need for the customer to contact your 
call center in the first place. Start with handling the calls you currently 
get really well so that customers don’t have to call back. Then work on 
calls related to billing errors, confusing marketing materials, or missed 
technician visits. Sometimes, you can easily eliminate calls; at other 
times, you need to go through a more involved process and work with 
other departments.
 
 Calculate the benefit — in terms of reduced costs to the call center and 
the company — of eliminating these unnecessary calls. Showing people 
this benefit can help you persuade them to invest time in eliminating 
unnecessary calls.
Find Out What a Change in 
Agent Utilization Costs
You can’t chain your agents to their desks; they need time for breaks, meet-
ings, training, and coaching. In most operations, agents also have a certain 
amount of time that’s unaccounted for. This missing time happens for a 
variety of reasons, and your call center can probably accept it as long as it 
doesn’t get out of hand, representing a small percentage of the total time 
agents are at work.
If everyone understands the costs, everyone may think about the benefit that 
each activity can yield. When managers plan meetings, training, and so on, 
for example, they do it with cost–benefit analysis in mind. (See Chapter 6 for 
more information about where agents’ time goes.)

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
By thinking about how your agents use their off-phone time, you can effec-
tively control your call center’s use of those human resources. Turning non-
production time into time spent talking to customers means that you need 
fewer agents, which lowers costs.
Relocate Your Call Center
Moving your call center to a different location can help you obtain labor at 
a lower cost. If your call center is located in the heart of Capital City, you 
have access to a lot of the best-qualified people who value the job, but they 
have relatively high pay requirements. You may be able to get the same qual-
ity of staff for a much lower cost in Rural City, USA; Frostbite, Canada; or 
Farfaraway, India.
You may not even have to close your existing call center; you can start by 
sending some of your calls to the remote center. Rather than replace staff in 
Capital City whom you lose to turnover, you might opt to hire additional staff 
for the rural operation. See Chapter 5 for more information on outsourcing 
options.
