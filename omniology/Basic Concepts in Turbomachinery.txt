Acknowledgements
This book is based on an introductory turbomachinery course at Durham University. This course
was taught by Dr David Gregory-Smith and Professor Li He over a number of years and I am ex-
tremely grateful to them for providing a clear and lucid set of principles on which to base this work.
My current colleagues at Durham Dr Rob Dominy and Dr David Sims-Williams have also provided
invaluable help (even if they didn‚Äôt realise it!) in preparing this work.
The book is designed to help students over some important ‚ÄúThreshold Concepts‚Äù in educational
jargon. A threshold concept is an idea that is hard to grasp but once the idea is understood transforms
the student understanding and is very hard to go back across. Within turbomachinery my view is
that understanding the cascade view, velocity triangles and reaction form three threshold concepts,
perhaps minor ones compared to the much bigger ideas such as ‚Äúreactive power‚Äù or ‚Äúopportunity
cost‚Äù that are also proposed but this view has signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuenced the production of this book.
I‚Äôd therefore like to acknowledge Professor Eric Meyer for introducing me to the idea of threshold
concepts.

Chapter 1
Introduction
This book is designed to help you understand turbomachinery. It aims to help you over some of the
difÔ¨Åcult initial concepts so that your work or study with turbomachinery will be much more fruitful.
It does not tell you how to design a turbomachine but instead aims to make your other studies, lectures
and textbooks which go into more depth make much more sense. For those readers not concerned with
turbomachinery design it might provide all the background they need. It is based on an introductory
course taught at Durham University for some years.
There are actually only three really difÔ¨Åcult ideas in this book: understanding the cascade view
(Chapter 1), velocity triangles (Chapter 2)and the concept of reaction (Chapter 6). Once you have
mastered those three concepts Turbomachinery actually becomes relatively straightforward!

1.1
How this book will help you
The book is designed to provide guidance on the basics. So if someone is presenting a velocity
triangle which you do not understand or you have absolutely no idea what a stator is this book will
help. Armed with this understanding you can then go on use the more complex texts effectively.
The book also contains examples which illustrate how understanding these basic concepts lead to
an immediate appreciation of why machines look the way they do. So for example you will rapidly be
able to see why wind turbine blades are twisted, why a the blade height in a steam turbine increases
towards the low pressure end and why pump blades often point away from the direction of rotation.
The most valuable learning experience however is to actually manipulate the ideas contained in
this text. A series of problems are provided at the end of each chapter with numerical answers - to
fully understand the material in this book you should attempt these problems.
1.2
Things you should already know
This book is directed at readers with a basic knowledge of Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics.
In order to make best use of the book you should have some knowledge of the steady Ô¨Çow energy
equation, static and stagnation conditions, the perfect gas law, how to use steam tables and charts and
an understanding of the boundary layer.
1.3
What is a Turbomachine?
A turbomachine is a device that exchanges energy with a Ô¨Çuid using continuously Ô¨Çowing Ô¨Çuid and
rotating blades. Examples of these devices include aircraft engines and wind turbines.
If the device extracts energy from the Ô¨Çuid it is generally called a turbine. If the device delivers
energy to the Ô¨Çuid it is called a compressor, fan, blower or pump depending on the Ô¨Çuid used and the
magnitude of the change in pressure that results. Turbomachinery is the generic name for all these
machines.
Somewhat confusingly the word turbine is sometimes applied to a complete engine system on an
aircraft or in a power station, e.g. ‚Äúa Boeing 747 is equipped with four gas turbines for thrust‚Äù. A
glossary is in Appendix A on page 137 at the end of the book to help you navigate your way through
the turbomachinery jargon.
Turbomachinery is essential to the operation of the modern world. Turbines are used in all sig-
niÔ¨Åcant electricity production throughout the world in steam turbine power plants, gas turbine power
plants, hydro-electric power plant and wind turbines. Pumps are used to transport water around mu-
nicipal water systems and in homes, pumps and turbines are also essential in the transportation of
fuel oil and gas around pipe networks. Gas turbine engines are used to power all large passenger

aircraft either in the form of turbo-prop or turbo-fan engines and also through a gearbox they power
all helicopter engines.
In short turbomachinery is all around you and is an area worthy of further study! Figure 1.1 shows
four important applications of turbomachinery, in the top left gas turbine propulsion for aeroplanes,
in the top right wind turbine power of electricity production, in the bottom left the rotor of a steam
turbine for power production and a water pump is shown in the bottom right.
1.4
A Simple Turbine
There are many variants of turbine, here we describe the operation of a simple turbine so you get a
feel for what is going on. An outline of a turbine is shown in Figure 1.2. From this view all we know
about the device is that Ô¨Çow goes into it and as if by magic the shaft turns and produces a torque.
If we look at the device in an exploded view (Figure 1.3) we see that as well as a number of covers
and bearings there is a row of aerodynamically shaped objects that don‚Äôt move followed by a row of
aerodynamically shaped objects that provide the torque to the shaft.
The objects are known various as blades, buckets, nozzles, aerofoils or airfoils. In this book we
will generally refer to them as blades. The row of stationary blades is known as a stator and the row
of rotating blades connected to the output shaft is known as the rotor.
The basic mechanism of operation is as follows (Figure 1.4):
1. the Ô¨Çuid Ô¨Çows directly into the device in an axial direction (in line with the machine)
2. the stator blades turn the Ô¨Çow so that it is lined up with the turbine blades
3. the turbine blades turn the Ô¨Çow back towards the axial direction and turn the output shaft.

The key point is that the power extraction from the Ô¨Çuid arises from turning the Ô¨Çow. More
complex turbines use more than one row of rotors and stators, but all work on the same essential
principle. A question often asked at this point is that since all the power comes from the rotor can you
do without a stator? The answer is yes! Wind turbines extract power from Ô¨Çuid with the need for a
stator. However for Ô¨Çows with much larger energy densities such as those in aircraft engines adding
a stator allows you to get much more energy out of the subsequent stator row - the reason for this is
found in Chapter 5.
1.5
The Cascade View
There are two key views of turbomachinery used throughout this book (and in turbomachinery design
in general). These are the cascade view and the meridional view.
The cascade view arises from looking at the stator and rotor of the simple turbine shown earlier
(Top half of Figure 1.5) if you look closely at the topmost part of the turbine you can see the blades
of the stator and rotor outlined in plan view. This is highlighted by a red box. You can actually do
this for any rotor/stator blade combination around the circumference of the turbine. The fact that
you can do this for every blade suggests that the plan view may be an excellent way of analysing the
performance of the machine.
The 2D cascade view of the simple turbine is shown in the lower half of Figure 1.5. The cascade
view with a single stator and rotor blade is highlighted with a red box. The relation between the 2D
cascade view and the 3D real turbine should be obvious. The rest of the cascade view is made up of
plan views of the other stator and rotor blade combinations. When looking directly down onto the red
box in the the 3D view of the turbine the movement of the rotor blade appears to be simply from left

to right. So in the cascade view the rotary motion in the 3D model becomes 2D linear motion in the
cascade view.
We can then analyse how the turbine blades inÔ¨Çuence the Ô¨Çow by looking at this 2D cascade view,
since the cascade view is the same for every blade passage around the circumference of the turbine.
Although we have completed this for the top of the turbine we can repeat the exercise at any radius
from the hub of the machine to the tip.
An alternative way of looking at the cascade view is to say that we are examining an inÔ¨Ånite
radius machine. Consider Figure 1.6 which contains three views, the Ô¨Årst is a 3D view of a simple
turbine, the second shows a sketch of the turbine as viewed from upstream with the blades and hub
shown in schematic form. To form the cascade view we can approximate the real turbine rotating at
speed œâ with a tip radius R = 0.15m and a spacing between the blades of s with a machine with an
inÔ¨Ånite radius and the same blade spacing (or pitch) of s. The rotation of the machine œâ is replaced
by a linear motion of magnitude œâR where R is the radius of the original machine.
The actual cascade view involves looking down from the casing to the hub so you get a plan view
of the blades. Note that in the real machine the pitch s gets larger with larger radius r so the cascade
view only accurately represents the machine at a single radius. For machines with very large changes
of radius such as wind turbines we can draw a number of cascade views at different radii.
The cascade has two ‚Äúanalysis stations‚Äù associated with it at inlet and outlet. A consequence of
the cascade view is the properties of the Ô¨Çuid (pressure, temperature etc) going through the machine
are assumed constant in the tangential direction since there is no change in geometry or Ô¨Çow between
one blade and the next in that direction. In the real machine this assumption represents properties
being constant around the circumference of the machine so that a single value describes the Ô¨Çuid state
around the whole machine. Analysis stations can also be applied to parts of the turbomachine that
don‚Äôt always have rotational symmetry such as the inlet or the exit pipe - what is assumed there is
that a single value accurately represents the Ô¨Çow in the inlet or the exit.

The Meridional View
The meridional view is much more straightforward than the cascade view and is illustrated in Figure
1.7. On the left of Figure 1.7 is the familiar 3D view of our simple turbine. For the meridional view
instead of looking at the tip of the blade this time we take a side on view of the whole turbine and
look at a cross section of the machine at the hub and tip radius. This is highlighted by a red box. On
the right of Figure 1.7 is the actual meridional view which shows the stator followed by the rotor in
cross section. The actual machine radius r is usually very large compared to the blade height b and
so the axis of rotation is not always shown in the meridional view.
1.7
Assumptions used in the book
It is easy to see how the real turbomachinery Ô¨Çow Ô¨Åeld is three dimensional and unsteady now that
the complex geometry of machine has been shown. In addition the Ô¨Çow is compressible so density
changes have to be accounted for. However to introduce the basic concepts we can dispense with a
great deal of this complexity by making a number of assumptions about the Ô¨Çow Ô¨Åeld.
1. The Ô¨Çow is symmetric in the circumferential direction. There is no variation in the Ô¨Çow from
one side of the blades to another
2. We consider a mean Ô¨Çow (technically called a stream surface) between the hub and casing.
This is reasonable for short blades, for longer blades the ‚Äútrick‚Äù is to repeat the calculation at a
number of radii.

3. Flow is steady. Although state of the art blade design requires a consideration of unsteady Ô¨Çow
most of the turbomachinery in use today has been designed with this steady Ô¨Çow assumption.
4. Flow follows the blade exactly. There is no deviation between the direction that the blades are
pointing and the direction that the Ô¨Çuid travels in. (In turbomachinery jargon: the Ô¨Çow follows
the metal angle of the blades)
These assumptions may seem quite limiting but most of them are used in the preliminary design
of all turbomachinery in use today so actually get you a surprisingly long way!

Chapter 2
Relative and Absolute Motion
One of the key concepts in turbomachinery is understanding how the Ô¨Çow appears from the point of
view of components that are rotating compared to those that are stationary. Once this is understood
this the shape of turbomachinery becomes much easier to understand! Viewing Ô¨Çows from the point
of view of a rotating component is known as being in the relative frame of reference and viewing Ô¨Çows
from the point of view of a stationary observer is called being in the absolute frame of reference.
We start therefore with a simple explanation of relative and absolute motion before ending this
Chapter with a discussion of how this relates to turbomachines.

Figure 2.1: Relative and Absolute Velocities for a Cyclist
2.1
1D Motion
Consider the everyday activity of riding a bicycle with three cases one where there is no wind, the
second with a tail wind and a third with a head wind. This is shown in Figure 2.1. The velocity of the
bicycle we shall label ‚ÉóU and call it the ‚Äúframe velocity‚Äù, the velocity of the wind we label ‚ÉóV and call
this the ‚Äúabsolute velocity‚Äù. Clearly the absolute velocity ‚ÉóV is the velocity that will be experienced by
an observer watching the cyclist. The wind velocity experienced by the cyclist is called the ‚Äúrelative
velocity‚Äù and given the symbol ‚ÉóW.
The Ô¨Årst case shown at the top of Figure 2.1 shows the simplest case, if there is no wind the ob-
server watching the cyclist will experience no wind and the cyclist will experience a relative velocity
that is equal and opposite to that of the speed at which he or she is cycling. So the relative velocity
‚ÉóW = ‚àí‚ÉóU.
The second case concerns a tail wind that is roughly equal in magnitude to the speed of the bicycle
‚ÉóU. This is shown in the middle of Figure 2.1. In this case a stationary observer would experience the
wind velocity but since the cyclist is moving at the same speed as the air the relative velocity ‚ÉóW will
be around zero and the cyclist will experience no wind.
The third case concerns a head wind that is again roughly equal to the velocity ‚ÉóU of the bicycle
in magnitude but not in direction. This is shown at the bottom of Figure 2.1. A stationary observer
would experience the same wind velocity as in the second case but in a different direction. The cyclist
however has a very different experience. The relative velocity is made up of their own speed ‚àí‚ÉóU (that
of the Ô¨Årst case) added to that of the oncoming wind ‚ÉóV . By inspection we can see that ‚ÉóW = ‚ÉóV ‚àí‚ÉóU.
Since ‚ÉóV is negative the cyclist now has to work much harder to maintain the same forward speed.
This suggests a generalisation of the relationship between relative and absolute velocity:
‚ÉóV = ‚ÉóU + ‚ÉóW

Figure 2.2: Velocity Triangles for an Aircraft Landing
Or in words absolute velocity is the vector sum of the frame velocity and the relative velocity. A
trivial rearrangement returns us to the relationship seen in Figure 2.1.
‚ÉóW = ‚ÉóU ‚àí‚ÉóV
(2.2)
2.2
2D Motion
We will apply our new found key rule (Equation 2.1) to one other non-turbomachinery situation to
illustrate how it works. This situation is one where the motion is in two dimensions. Consider the
plan view of a aircraft and a runway in Figure 2.2. In the Ô¨Årst situation (top of Figure 2.2) there is no
atmospheric wind ‚ÉóV = 0 and so the aircraft simple lines up with the runway and lands.
The second situation (lower part of Figure 2.2) is where there is a substantial cross-wind, in this
case imagine that the wind is entirely perpendicular to the runway. What relative velocity ( ‚ÉóW) does
the aircraft have to Ô¨Çy at to ensure that the movement of the aircraft (the frame velocity ‚ÉóU) results in
the aircraft arriving on the centre-line of the runway?
The frame velocity we know is given by the desired path of the aircraft, that is directly towards the
runway and the absolute velocity is given the atmospheric conditions. The relative velocity is given
mathematically by the application of our key rule, Equation 2.2. But what if we wanted to sketch out
the vector? This enables us to understand the direction the aeroplane should be facing.
To do this we need to use a tool known as a velocity triangle one of the fundamental tools of
turbomachinery analysis. First we review some very basic vector addition and subtraction rules,
shown in Figure 2.3.
‚Ä¢ To add two vectors ‚ÉóA + ‚ÉóB graphically: place them nose to tail and the result is given by
movement from the tail of the Ô¨Årst to the nose of the second.

Figure 2.3: Graphical Addition and Subtraction of Vectors
‚Ä¢ To subtract two vectors ‚ÉóA‚àí‚ÉóB graphically: reverse the direction of ‚ÉóB then proceed with addition
of vectors as before.
To apply this to the example of our aircraft we apply the key rule and our knowledge of how to
put vectors together to end up with the required relative velocity. This is shown in the lower portion
of Figure 2.2, Ô¨Årst the frame velocity ‚ÉóU is reversed in direction to form ‚àí‚ÉóU, this is then added to ‚ÉóV
by putting them nose to tail. We then draw the line between the start of the vector ‚ÉóV and the end of
the vector ‚àí‚ÉóU which gives the relative velocity ‚ÉóW.
This explains why aircraft landing in cross-winds often have to approach the runway at an an-
gle. If you have an active web connection there are some spectacular examples of this on YouTube:
http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=GHrLB_mlir4
Note that we formed the relative vector ‚ÉóW by drawing ‚ÉóV then ‚àí‚ÉóU but we would end up with the
same result if we drew the triangle with ‚àí‚ÉóU then ‚ÉóV .
All this may seem obvious but it is vitally important before we move onto turbomachinery that
you are conÔ¨Ådent in how to draw a 2D vector and how to add and subtract vectors graphically.
2.3
Velocity Triangles in Turbomachinery
In this book we consider a Cartesian coordinate system consisting of an axial x, radial r and tangential
Œ∏ set of coordinates. The velocity of the frame of motion is denoted by ‚ÉóU, velocities in the frame of
motion are denoted with ‚ÉóW and absolute velocities are denoted with ‚ÉóV . Consider a turbine consisting
of a stator and a rotor, the cascade and meridional views are shown in Figure 2.4 along with the
coordinate system.
There are three points that are of interest to us entry to the stator, the gap between the stator
and the rotor and exit from the rotor, these are labelled 1,2 and 3 respectively in Figure 2.4. The

combination of rotor and stator is called a ‚Äústage‚Äù in turbomachinery jargon. These points are the
analysis stations referred to in Chapter 1.
At point 1 we have an incoming velocity but as the stator is not moving there is no relative motion
between the incoming Ô¨Çow and the stator so there is no velocity triangle to draw at this point.

At point 2 the Ô¨Çow leaves the stator and enters the rotor. Here there are two frames of reference,
the Ô¨Çow viewed from the point of view of the stator and the point of view from the moving rotor. A
velocity triangle can be drawn here. The rotor in the cascade view is moving with a linear (tangential)
velocity of magnitude œârm where œâ is the rotational speed of the machine and rm is the mean radius
of the blades.
At point 3 the Ô¨Çow leaves the rotor and exits the stage. Again there are two frames of reference, or
points of view for the Ô¨Çow. That found by viewing from the moving rotor and that found by viewing
from outside the rotor where there is no motion.
We can now draw the velocity triangles for point 2 and point 3 in the stage, this is shown in Figure
2.5. The methodology for this is as follows:
1. Draw the Ô¨Çow that you know
2. Draw the blade speed
3. Close the triangle with the remaining vector
4. Check that the key rule applies: ‚ÉóV = ‚ÉóU + ‚ÉóW
This methodology is important and we will refer to elsewhere as the ‚Äúfour step rule‚Äù.
So for station 2 the Ô¨Çow that we know is the absolute velocity at exit from the stator, ‚ÉóV . This is
the Ô¨Çow that we know, recall from Chapter 1 that the Ô¨Çow follows the metal angle of the blades so if
with a sketch of the stator the absolute velocity may be drawn directly. To get the velocity triangle
draw the absolute velocity vector ‚ÉóV , draw the blade speed ‚ÉóU and then close the triangle with the
relative velocity ‚ÉóW. The result is in Figure 2.5. The Ô¨Ånal (and vital!) step is to check that the correct
triangle has been obtained by following the blade speed and relative velocity vectors. If we end up in
the same place as if we had followed the absolute velocity vector the triangle is correct.
For station 3 the Ô¨Çow that we know is the relative velocity at exit from the rotor, ‚ÉóW again this is
because the Ô¨Çow follows precisely the path of the blades and since the rotor blades are moving the
Ô¨Çow that we sketch on the rotor must be the relative and not the absolute velocity. Having drawn ‚ÉóW
we draw the blade speed ‚ÉóU and then close the triangle this time with the absolute velocity ‚ÉóV . Again
the Ô¨Ånal vital step is to check that the we have the correct triangle by making sure the key rule applies.
The correct velocity triangle is shown at the bottom right of Figure 2.5.
Once we have drawn the velocity triangles we can then carry out a series of calculations on
the Ô¨Çuid going through the turbomachine and the end result might indicate that our sketch is not
entirely accurate, i.e. the blade speed is much greater than what we have drawn in Figure 2.5 - this
does not matter! If accurate velocity triangles are required they can always be drawn again once the
calculations are complete.
2.4
Velocity Components
For each velocity in the cascade view we can decompose into axial and tangential components and
can also express each vector as a magnitude and direction. Axial components are denoted with the
subscript x and tangential components are denoted with subscript Œ∏. Angles can be measured in a
number of directions but in this book the axial direction is chosen. The angle made by the absolute

velocity with the axial direction is called Œ± and the angle the relative velocity makes with the axial
direction is called Œ≤. Angles are positive in the direction of rotation. Therefore velocities can be
speciÔ¨Åed as a vector ‚ÉóV or a magnitude and angle, V and Œ±.
The one complication to this is that in this book we also deal with machines where the Ô¨Çow has
a signiÔ¨Åcant radial component - in that case we draw velocity triangles in the radial (subscript r) and

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet‚Äôs 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF‚Äôs innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world‚Äôs wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity,

radial and centrifugal machines are explained in Chapter 4.

Aside from trigonometry we can also work out that Wx = Vx for all turbomachinery. The reason
for that is if we look the basic geometry of a turbomachine such as that shown in Figure 1.4 we see
that there is no motion of the machine components in the axial direction. That is the stator and the
rotor remain the same distance apart when the machine is operating. The only time we would have
movement between the stator and the rotor is if the device had suffered some sort of catastrophic
failure - there is no normal operating procedure where the gap between the rotor and stator would
increase!

Consider an OfÔ¨Åce Desk Fan. It rotates at 200 rpm and has a diameter of 30 cm. Air
enters the fan at 3 m/s, parallel to the axis of rotation. Calculate the relative velocity ( ‚ÉóW) at the tip
of the fan.

Figure 2.7: Velocity Triangles for a Desk Fan
Solution
The information given is the absolute velocity ‚ÉóV which is the air entering the fan. The
plan is to work out the frame velocity and thus determine the relative velocity.
To do this sketch the fan and velocity triangle in Figure 2.7. A sketch of the desk fan is on the
left hand side of Figure 2.7 and the cascade view and the velocity triangles are shown on the right.
It is very good practise to sketch the object that you are trying to do calculations on to determine the
overall layouts - even if (as in Figure 2.7!) the sketch is only approximate.
The frame velocity ‚ÉóU we can obtain from the rotational speed and the radius:
U = œâr = 200 √ó 2œÄ

Trigonometry gives the magnitude of the relative velocity:

Œ≤ is negative as the angle is opposite to the direction of rotation. Many students write V tan Œ≤ = U
which gets the correct magnitude but a careful inspection of Figure 2.7 will reveal that this has the
wrong sign.

Chapter 3
Simple Analysis of Wind Turbines
This chapter provides an immediate application of the principles of relative motion by using the
horizontal axis wind turbine as an example. Such a wind turbine is shown in Figure 3.1 as can
be see from Figure 3.1 the blades are far apart so the inÔ¨Çuence between them is very small. In
turbomachinery jargon the pitch s is very large. The interactions between the different blades can be
ignored in a simple treatment. The wind turbine is one of the only examples in turbomachinery where
each blade can be considered in isolation and this is one of the reasons that a simple analysis is easy.
Consider one of the turbine blades shown in Figure 3.1, the speed of each of the three blades will
be the same and assuming that the wind does not vary over the area of the machine, an analysis need
only be conducted on a single blade and multiplied as necessary. The interaction of the blades and
the tower is ignored but since this occupies a small fraction of the 360‚ó¶rotation of the turbine this

Figure 3.1: Wind Turbine Picture and Sketch
will not inÔ¨Çuence the analysis greatly.
Consider what happens if an observer was positioned on the turbine blade about half way along
the span and a virtual cut made through the blade. If the observer looked towards the hub of the
machine, they would see an aerofoil proÔ¨Åle rotating around the hub. Since the radius of the machine
is large the rotational motion of the turbine blade can be approximated by a linear motion - in much
the same way as the earth is round but looks Ô¨Çat as the radius is very large. Such a view of a turbine
blade is shown in Figure 3.2. The rotational motion of speed œâ is translated to a linear motion of œâr
the tangential velocity of the rotating blade. If the turbine is facing into the wind the incoming wind
‚ÉóV will be perpendicular to the rotating blade.
The velocity triangle for the wind turbine blade can then be drawn according to the four step
procedure and is shown on the left hand side of Figure 3.2. The Ô¨Çow that is known is the incoming
wind velocity ‚ÉóV which is in the absolute frame of reference. The blade speed, ‚ÉóU is then drawn and
the triangle is closed by the relative velocity ‚ÉóW. The triangle can then be checked by following the
relative velocity vector and the blade speed to ensure that the same point is arrived at if ‚ÉóV alone was
followed.
The blade therefore experiences a velocity of magnitude W and angle Œ≤ which will produce a
force on the blade.
Recall that from basic mechanics that a force in two dimensions can be resolved into two per-
pendicular components of any orientation. Two particularly convenient directions are found to be
perpendicular and parallel to the incoming Ô¨Çow. The force perpendicular to the incoming Ô¨Çow is
known as the lift force L and the force parallel to the incoming Ô¨Çow is known as the drag force D.
The principle reason that these are useful directions is that a large body of data on aerofoil perfor-
mance is available in this form.
For the wind turbine to produce a useful output a force in the tangential direction must be pro-
duced, so the lift and drag forces must be resolved into the tangential direction to give a tangential
component of the force FŒ∏. It is also possible to determine the axial force Fx on the blades which is

important for determining the loads on the wind turbine tower and wind turbine bearings.
All of this is shown in Figure 3.3 which shows the lift and drag forces on the blade. Note that
these forces are perpendicular and parallel to the incoming Ô¨Çow ‚ÉóW and not the axial chord line of
the aerofoil. Some trigonometry shows the relationship between lift and drag and tangential and axial
force to be:

Fx = L sin Œ≤ + D cos Œ≤
(3.2)
If we consider FŒ∏ and Fx to be forces per unit span. We can obtain a torque per unit span from
the force times radius.
T = FŒ∏ √ó r
The power per unit span is given by the torque multiplied by the rotational speed, this can then be
integrated from the hub to the tip to give the total power on the blade.
P =
 rt
rh
FŒ∏rœâdr
Where rh and rt are the hub and tip radius respectively. Usually these conditions are evaluated
at a number of points along the span of the blade and the integral is obtained numerically by using
the trapezium rule. The tangential force depends on the lift and drag of an aerofoil which is usually a
very complex function so no analytical solution is possible.
In order to determine the performance of the wind turbine some method of determining the lift
and drag forces is required. This largely comes from test data obtained in wind tunnels, in the form
a lift and drag plot against incidence. To use this a short digression into aerofoil performance is
required.
3.1
Aerofoil Operation and Testing
In wind tunnel testing an aerofoil is placed in wind tunnel and the incidence of the aerofoil is changed,
usually by rotating the aerofoil. A lift force perpendicular to the incoming Ô¨Çow and a drag force
parallel to the incoming Ô¨Çow are measured. Figure 3.4 shows such an aerofoil at two incidences one
of which is zero or aligned with the incoming Ô¨Çow. Note how the lift and drag remain in the same
direction with changing incidence and that the aerofoil chord c also does not change with incidence.
Since it is the Ô¨Çow relative to the aerofoil that produces the lift the incoming velocity is the relative
velocity ‚ÉóW and not the absolute velocity ‚ÉóV . The incidence i is deÔ¨Åned as the angle made between
the axial chord of the aerofoil and the incoming Ô¨Çow.
The lift and drag are usually expressed in turns of a non-dimensional coefÔ¨Åcient so that they can
be scaled for size, Ô¨Çuid density and incoming Ô¨Çuid velocity. These are given by:
CL =
L

2œÅW 2c
(3.3)
where L is the lift force per unit length of aerofoil. The drag coefÔ¨Åcient is given in a very similar
form:

where D is the drag force per unit length of the aerofoil. For wind turbine analysis and design val-
ues of CL and CD as a function of incidence i are required, these are found in reference books such as
Abbott and von Doenhoff (1959) A simpliÔ¨Åed example of aerofoil data is shown in Figure 3.5 which
is for a NACA 0012 aerofoil. NACA was the predecessor of NASA and the four digit designation
allows the aerofoil geometry to be determined. On-line coordinate generators are available.1
Figure 3.5 is a simpliÔ¨Åed presentation of aerofoil data as there is no indication on the dependence
on Reynolds number, for serious work primary sources should be consulted.
An excellent explanation of the basic physics of aerofoil operation is found in Babinsky (2003)
but for the purposes of this book it is enough to note that there are three areas of interest for this
aerofoil plot:
1. Since the NACA 0012 aerofoil is symmetrical when i = 0‚ó¶the Ô¨Çow on both sides of the
aerofoil follows an identical pattern so the lift is zero.
2. When the incidence is non-zero but below what is called the stall point the lift coefÔ¨Åcient
increases rapidly and the drag coefÔ¨Åcient increases more slowly. In this case streamlines of the
Ô¨Çow over the aerofoil will still largely follow the geometry of the aerofoil.
3. When the incidence reaches a certain level the aerofoil stalls. The streamlines over the aerofoil
no longer follow the geometry of the aerofoil, the boundary layer has separated and there is a
substantial reduction in lift along with a substantial increase in drag.
A common design choice is to place the design point at around 80% of the maximum lift to allow
for some variation in incidence with stalling the aerofoil.
Example
A wind turbine is designed to work at a condition with a wind speed of 10 m/s and an
air density of 1.22 kg/m3. The turbine has blades with a NACA 0012 proÔ¨Åle and is rotating at one

revolution per second. The blade chord length is 0.5 m. Taking the design point at 85% maximum
lift condition and ignoring the drag on the aerofoil estimate the power output per unit blade span at a
radius of 6 m for each blade.
Solution
The maximum lift shown in Figure 3.5 is around 1.3 and 85% of this value is around 1.1.
Recall that:
L = CL

2œÅW 2c
So we need to Ô¨Ånd W the magnitude of the relative velocity. To do this we consult a velocity
triangle such as the one in Figure 3.2. From this triangle we can see that:
W =

U2 + V 2
U = œâr = 1 √ó 2œÄ √ó 6 = 37.7 m/s
V is the wind speed at 10 m/s so:
W =

37.72 + 102 = 39 m/s

Wind Turbine Design
In wind turbine design the turbine designer has three primary variables that he or she can change:
1. The type of aerofoil to be used. In this book the NACA 0012 aerofoil is used for simplicity
but there are actually a wind variety of aerofoils available many designed speciÔ¨Åcally for wind
turbine use.
2. The chord length c along the span of the blade.

Figure 3.6: Relationship between Œ≥ and i
3. The angle that the blade is set to given the symbol Œ≥, this is positive in the direction of rotation
as for the Ô¨Çow angles Œ± and Œ≤. This is also known as the blade twist.
CL and CD are obtained with a stationary aerofoil in a wind tunnel and the incidence i is deÔ¨Åned
for convenience in the wind tunnel testing environment. In order to analyse wind turbines some way
of relating the incidence i and the blade twist angle Œ≥ is required and this is obtained in the velocity
triangle shown in Figure 3.6.
Note that the lift force L is perpendicular to the incoming Ô¨Çow ‚ÉóW and so is not at right angles to
the chord line of the aerofoil. From Figure 3.6 it is apparent that:
i = Œ≤ ‚àíŒ≥
This arrangement often confuses students as the sign conventions for i on the one hand and Œ≤ and
Œ≥ on the other hand are in the opposite direction. It is much easier to work in terms of absolute values
and then determine the orientation from the velocity triangle in that case:
|i| = |Œ≥| ‚àí|Œ≤|
(3.5)
which is much more ‚Äúintuitive‚Äù when compared to Figure 3.6.
Example
For a wind turbine with the same parameters as the previous example. That is: NACA
0012 aerofoil, air density of 1.22 kg/m3, chord length of 0.5 m, rotational speed of one revolution
per second. Calculate the wind speed at which the blade will stall at a 6m radius if the blade angle
(Œ≥) remains constant.
Solution
The Ô¨Årst step is to determine Œ≥. From the previous example at a wind speed of 10 m/s
the relative Ô¨Çow angle was given by:
Œ≤ = ‚àí75.1‚ó¶

The operating point was obtained by examining the lift as 85% of maximum where CL = 1.1
from Figure 3.5 the incidence i at this point is around 10‚ó¶. Using equation 3.5 determine the blade
angle:
|Œ≥| = |i| + |Œ≤| = 10 + 75.1 = 85.1‚ó¶
From Figure 3.5 we can see that the aerofoil stalls at an incidence of around 14‚ó¶which means the
relative Ô¨Çow angle at the stall condition is given by:
|Œ≤| = 85.1 ‚àí14 = 71.1‚ó¶
The velocity triangle in this example is the same as that used in the previous example so from
Figure 3.2 we can see that Œ≤ should be negative so for stall Œ≤ = ‚àí71.1‚ó¶. Using the velocity triangle
gives a relationship for V :
Œ≤ = tan‚àí1

=‚áíV = ‚àíU
tan Œ≤ =
‚àí37.7
tan(‚àí71.1) = 12.9 m/s
This example illustrates why long turbine blades are twisted, as the radius changes so does the
blade speed so to maintain the same incidence the blade has to be twisted.
Example
If the blade hub section in the example above at a radius of 1.5m is designed to stall at
the same wind condition, what would be the local blade angle?

Solution
So at the hub of the wind turbine the blade angle Œ≥ must be set to stall at V = 12.9 m/s.
Since the radius of our analysis has changed so will the blade speed:

3.3
Turbine Power Control
Too high a power output from wind turbines is actually very undesirable. Too high a power output
can over-stress the blades causing structural failure and the generator in the turbine has only a Ô¨Ånite
capacity to absorb power. Two methods are commonly used to control the power output.
1. Stall Control. The blade is designed mechanically for maximum lift. At higher wind speeds,
the blades will stall, causing a reduction in lift and hence tangential force. The drag will
be increased signiÔ¨Åcantly, which contributes to the axial force, so there is a need to ensure
the structure can endure the increased axial loading. The drawback of this technique is that
predicting the onset of stall and the Ô¨Çow around a stalled aerofoil is very difÔ¨Åcult.
2. Pitch Control. The blade is provided with an actuated mechanism to vary the blade angle at
different wind conditions. When the wind speed is too high, the blade angle is altered to reduce
incidence. This is shown in Figure 3.7 in Case A on the left the wind turbine blade angle
Œ≥ is set so that the incidence i is large. In Case B on the right the blade angle has been set
so that the incidence i has been reduced. The inset in the bottom left of Figure 3.7 shows
the two blade shapes superimposed to highlight the differences between them. In low wind
conditions pitching can be used to increase the incidence and hence reduce the power output.
The drawback here is that a complex actuation mechanism has to be provided.
3.4
Further Reading
The method outlined is this Chapter is a simple method of calculating wind turbine performance. The
simple wind turbine analysis assumes that the wind turbine does not alter the Ô¨Çow going through it
when momentum changes are considered later it will be clear that this is only a Ô¨Årst order approx-
imation. A more accurate technique is the so called ‚ÄúBlade Element Momentum Method‚Äù which
allows for the variation of Ô¨Çow over the blade and is described in much more detail in Manwell et al.
(2002) along with much more detail on the general operation of wind turbines. Hansen and ButterÔ¨Åeld
(1993) provide an excellent description of some early development of the aerodynamics of wind tur-
bine blades.

Problems
1. A two-blade wind turbine is designed to operate at an atmospheric condition (the air density
can be taken as 1.22 kg/m3) with a wind speed of 22 mph. The turbine blades of 10 m length
are attached to a nacelle of a radius of 1 m. A preliminary blading design is considered by
using a NACA 0012 proÔ¨Åle with a constant chord length of 1.5 m. The rotational speed of the
turbine is 30 rev/min. The blading design is taken at a condition corresponding to 80% of the
maximum lift.
Calculate the blade angle and the power output per unit blade-span at 20%, 50% and 80%
spanwise sections for each blade. Note that the blade starts at radius of 1 m so the tip radius
is 11 m. Estimate the total power output of the wind turbine using the results from the three
spanwise sections and an approximate integration.

Different Turbomachines and Their
Operation
Now that the concept of an axial Ô¨Çow turbine has been introduced in some detail the geometries and
mode of operation of a number of other types of turbomachine will be considered and the cascade
view and velocity triangles applied to those machines.
There are three ways of classifying turbomachines, the Ô¨Årst is by the type of Ô¨Çuid they work on
and the second is based on the direction that the Ô¨Çow travels through the machine and the third is
whether or not they deliver power to or extract power from the working Ô¨Çuid.
The classiÔ¨Åcation by type of Ô¨Çuid splits machines into two categories. Those that work on com-

pressible Ô¨Çuids (most often air or steam ) such as aircraft engines, stationary gas turbines, steam
power plants and high speed fans. The complication with these machines is that if the velocity of the
Ô¨Çuid goes above the local speed of sound in the Ô¨Çuid shock waves may result. The second category
is those that work in incompressible Ô¨Çuids such as water or oil such as pumps or hydraulic turbines.
Shock waves are not an issue in liquids but the complication here is a phenomenon known as cav-
itation which occurs if the pressure of the Ô¨Çuid falls below a certain pressure. This is discussed in
Chapter 10. Machines such as wind turbines and low speed fans fall outside this classiÔ¨Åcation system
as although the Ô¨Çuid is compressible in practise the changes in density are minimal so they can belong
to either category.
The classiÔ¨Åcation of machine by Ô¨Çow direction is more complex, essentially if the Ô¨Çow direction
is roughly along the direction of the axis of the machine the device is called an ‚Äúaxial‚Äù machine
but if the Ô¨Çow direction turns and has a component substantially in the radial direction the machine is
know variously as a ‚Äúradial‚Äù or ‚Äúcentrifugal‚Äù machine. The meaning of this classiÔ¨Åcation will become
clearer as the different machine types encountered in practise are described.
The Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation is that some turbomachines absorb power from the Ô¨Çuid (turbines) and
some deliver energy to the Ô¨Çuid (compressors,fans or pumps).
4.1
Axial Flow Machines
A simple axial Ô¨Çow machine was used to introduce the idea of a turbomachine in Chapter 1 essentially
an axial Ô¨Çow machine is one in which the Ô¨Çuid remains parallel to the axis of rotation as it passes
through the machine. There are many examples of this type most aircraft engines use axial Ô¨Çow
devices as do all large power station equipment and wind turbines are the most visually striking
example.
The complication with axial Ô¨Çow machines compared to the simple one see in Figure 1.2 is that
more than one stage may be present. This idea allows energy to be extracted in ‚Äúsmall bites‚Äù from the
machine allowing very large pressure ratios to be used in a single device - indeed it was this concept
that is the key to the superiority of steam turbines compared to reciprocating engines. A single stage
is sufÔ¨Åcient when the Ô¨Çuid does not have a great deal of energy to be extracted for a turbine or when
the requirement is for a modest pressure rise such as in most fans.
4.2
Radial and Centrifugal Flow Machines
To introduce the idea of a radial Ô¨Çow machine we will discuss a speciÔ¨Åc instance, that of a radial
Ô¨Çow pump. A general arrangement drawing of the pump is shown in Figure 4.1, on the left the cross
section of the pump is shown and on the right a plan view. Two components are shown in each view
the outer casing also called the ‚Äúvolute‚Äù or ‚Äúscroll casing‚Äù the aim of which is to ensure an even
distribution of Ô¨Çow out of the machine, the area is therefore gradually increased up to the discharge
pipe. The second component is the rotor also called the ‚Äúimpeller‚Äù.
The operation of the machine is such that Ô¨Çow approaches the device through the inlet pipe in the
axial direction, the Ô¨Çuid is then turned through 90‚ó¶to the radial direction where it enters the impeller.
The rotor then increases the angular momentum of the Ô¨Çuid and it exits in the radial direction into
the volute. The pump shown in Figure 4.1 has no stator following the rotor, the Ô¨Çuid slows and
experiences a rise in static pressure simply by the action of the increased cross sectional area of the

volute as the radius increases (An analysis of this can be found in Chapter 10) for large pressure rises
it is necessary to put in a stator row to control this process.
A 3D view is shown in Figure 4.2 of the impeller only with a radial and the axial direction marked
on, this hopefully puts Figure 4.1 in context. The blades of the impeller in Figure 4.2 are what is
known as radial blades, that is no part of them operate in the axial-tangential plane. The impeller as
a whole is therefore sometimes called a ‚Äúradial impeller‚Äù. This is best seen in comparison to what
is often called a ‚Äúcentrifugal impeller‚Äù shown in Figure 4.3 here the blades extend from the radial
direction until they also have an axial component.
Although radial machines are most often found in pumping applications, radial turbines are

widely used in small gas turbines such as the auxiliary power unit found on most aeroplanes and
centrifugal designs and are used exclusively for turbochargers on internal combustion engines.
4.3
Radial Impellers
The velocity triangle can be applied to radial turbomachines in an identical manner for the axial Ô¨Çow
machine used earlier. The difference is that the cascade view becomes slightly more abstract and the
velocity triangles may be drawn in the radial tangential plane as well as the axial tangential plane.
First consider the radial impeller shown in Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2. The cascade view for the
axial Ô¨Çow turbine can be considered as an ‚Äúunwrapping‚Äù of the turbine so that the rotational motion
of the blades œâ was transformed into a linear motion with magnitude œârm. We apply an identical
process to the radial impeller in Figure 4.4 as we did for the axial machine in Figure 1.6 on page 18.
Figure 4.4 shows three views, the Ô¨Årst is a 3D view of the radial impeller, the second shows a
sketch of the turbine as viewed from upstream with the blades, axial inlet and blade tips highlighted.
To form the cascade view we can approximate the real turbine with a tip radius R = 0.15m and a
spacing between the blades of s with a machine with an inÔ¨Ånite radius and the same blade spacing
(or pitch) of s. For the radial impeller the cascade view is formed by simply examining the sketch
produced at the bottom of Figure 4.4 which shows the inlet and the exit from the blades.
There are two differences between the cascade view for a radial machine and the cascade view
for the axial machines:
1. As we shall see later in Chapter 5 there are only two radii that we need to examine to determine
the work input that the pump applies to the Ô¨Çuid: the radius at where the blades start and the
radius at the blade tip. Unlike for axial machines the cascade view need only be drawn once no
matter how large the radius of the machine.

2. The cascade view for radial machines is formed in the radial tangential plane and not the axial
tangential plane.
Having developed the cascade view the four step method for drawing velocity triangles (Section

sketch of the cascade view and the two velocity triangles.
The cascade view is the same as Figure 4.4 simply turned through 90‚ó¶. The inlet to the rotor is
station 1 and the exit from the rotor is station 2 there is no stator in this case so no station 3 is drawn.

conditions using conservation of angular momentum - for now we stick to the velocity triangles. For
radial machines the blade velocity ‚ÉóU is different at station 1 and station 2. The blade velocity is given
by ‚ÉóU = œâr and will get larger with increasing radius at the same revolutions per minute.
First consider the velocity triangles at station 1. The Ô¨Årst step of the four step rule (Section 2.3)
is to draw the Ô¨Çow that you know. At station 1 the Ô¨Çow that we know is the absolute inlet velocity at
inlet to the impeller. There is no mechanism for the Ô¨Çuid to have been imparted with any tangential
velocity (the inlet Ô¨Çow in the pipe is assumed to have no rotation in it) so the Ô¨Çow is purely radial. So
a purely radial vector ‚ÉóV1 be drawn. The second step of the four step rule is to draw the blade speed,
the blades move in the tangential direction which is perpendicular to the radial direction so we can
draw a vector ‚ÉóU1. Step three is to close the triangle with the remaining vector ‚ÉóW. Finally check the
correct orientation of the triangle by following the line drawn by ‚ÉóW then ‚ÉóU this should produce the
same movement as following the vector ‚ÉóV . In Figure 4.5 the velocity triangle is correct so there is no
need to adjust.
The velocity triangles at station 2 are drawn with exactly the same method. Step 1: the Ô¨Çow that is
know this time is the relative velocity, in this book we assume that the Ô¨Çow always follows the blade
geometry directly so once the blade has been sketched the relative velocity vector ‚Éó
W2 at exit from the
impeller may be drawn. Step 2: The blade speed is always purely tangential but note that the blade
speed at 2 is greater than at station 1. Step 3: This time close the triangle with the absolute velocity
vector ‚ÉóV3. Finally in Step 4 check that the key rule ‚ÉóV = ‚ÉóU + ‚ÉóW applies by following vectors.
An alternative approach to step three and four which is essentially a trial and error approach to
getting the velocity triangle correct is to work out which way around the triangle should go using
vector addition and get it right Ô¨Årst time. The author‚Äôs experience is that many students Ô¨Ånd velocity
triangles very confusing at Ô¨Årst and a slower but fail-safe method is more appropriate when Ô¨Årst
introduced to the concept.

Figure 4.6: Common errors in Velocity Triangles
Figure 4.6 shows correct and incorrect velocity triangles for the radial impeller exit. On the
left that are two correct triangles the difference being in whether the blade speed is above or below
the other vectors. Note how the angles and lengths in both triangles are the same. The right hand
side of Figure 4.6 shows a number of velocity triangles that are incorrect. The Ô¨Årst has the relative
and absolute velocity interchanged, the second two have the vectors for relative velocity and blade
speed connected in an incorrect manner. The incorrect velocity triangles do not obey the key rule:
‚ÉóV = ‚ÉóU + ‚ÉóW a tool which gives a systematic method for checking velocity triangles.
4.4
Centrifugal Impellers
We now apply the same techniques for deriving velocity triangles to the most complex case commonly
encountered in turbomachinery - that of a turbomachine where the Ô¨Çow is turned from axial to radial
and the blades operate in both the axial tangential and the radial tangential plane. The velocity triangle
at inlet and exit are in different planes. The construction of the cascade view is illustrated in Figure
4.7 as before.
In the top left of Figure 4.7 the 3D view of the centrifugal impeller is shown. The front on
‚Äúsketch‚Äù is show on the top right, hopefully the relationship between the two is clear as since a 3D
sketch is hard to do a front view of the 3D model is used. To draw the cascade view two views in the
radial-tangential plane are shown at the bottom of the Ô¨Ågure.
The bottom left of Figure 4.7 shows a sketch of the blades when they are unwrapped to an in-
Ô¨Ånite radius. The blade tip view is straightforward as it is the same as the blade tip view for the
radial machine, the complication is that since the geometry is complex the section at the tip only is
sketched.1
The blade hub view (bottom right of Figure 4.7) is actually very similar to the one found in Figure
1Chapter 5 will show to determine the performance of a turbomachine we only need information at the inlet and exit of
a set of blades.

Figure 4.7: Constructing the Cascade View for a Centrifugal Impeller
1.6 except the sketch only covers the front part of the blades, the parts that are directly facing us in
the top right view in Figure 4.7. It is apparent that since the blades extend outwards in the radial
direction that there will be some variation in conditions in the radial direction at inlet to the blades.
The blade speed œâr will increase with increasing radius. Normally centrifugal impellers are small
enough to use a mid-height radius as representative of the Ô¨Çow at inlet but for detailed design work
or for machines with very large blades a number of different radii should be examined at inlet. The
cascade view is formed (as for an axial Ô¨Çow turbine) by looking down from the casing to the hub so
you get a plan view of the blades at the inlet to the impeller.
The two different cascade views are produced in Figure 4.8 along the corresponding velocity
triangles at inlet and exit. The triangles are built up using the four step rule, the process for which is
the same as for radial machines.
For station 1 the cascade view is sketched, it is important to remember that the cascade view is
only for the entry to the machine, the complex geometry that extends beyond the start of the rotor
row blading is ignored. The cascade view at inlet is sketched in the axial-tangential plane. At station
1 the known Ô¨Çow is the absolute velocity which with the absence of any device to increase angular
momentum will have zero tangential velocity. The blade speed is given by œâr1 where r1 is mean
radius at station 1 as discussed earlier. With the blade speed and absolute the relative velocity can be
used to close the triangle and the velocity triangle is complete.
For station 2 the view is the axial-radial plane and the known velocity is the relative velocity
leaving the blades. The blades in the centrifugal impeller shown are radial at exit or to put it another
way the blade direction at exit is parallel to the radial axis. Since the blades are radial the relative
velocity at exit is also radial. The blade speed is given by œâr2 which since r2 > r1 will be greater
than the blade speed at inlet. The relative velocity and blade speed allow to complete the velocity
triangle.
Figure 4.8 represents the most complex velocity triangle and cascade view encountered in prac-
tise so once the reader has mastered this technique you are well equipped to analyse almost any
turbomachine.

Note that the analysis of radial Ô¨Çow machines is not restricted to pumps, the technique is equally
applicable to hydraulic turbines, turbochargers and so on.
4.5
Hydraulic Turbines
Hydraulic turbines are devices for extracting energy from a reservoir of Ô¨Çuid usually obtained from
rainfall above sea level. Water is collected in a reservoir at a height then is carried by a series of pipes
to a turbine which discharges into a river (Figure 4.9). Hydraulic turbines are universally used to
generate electricity and there are broadly three types of hydraulic machine in use: The Pelton wheel,
Francis turbine and the Kaplan turbine, each of which were named after their inventors are are in
common use around the world today.
Using the relationship Œîp = ŒîhœÅg it is possible to express any pressure in terms of height of a
particular Ô¨Çuid. This is an approach commonly used in hydraulic turbines as pressures directly relate
to the height of the reservoir or the height above river level that the turbine is situated at.
Hydraulic turbines are usually classiÔ¨Åed in terms of total head. For any position in a Ô¨Çuid system
the total head is given by the following equation:
H = p
œÅg + V 2
2g + z
(4.1)
If we examine the total head at the dam of a reservoir (Station 0 in Figure 4.9) where the height
datum is the river level at exit from the turbine. The surface area is very large so V ‚âà0 and since
the pressure is at atmospheric pressure p = 0. The total head is therefore given entirely by the height
term z. At entry to the turbine however the height term z ‚âà0 but the pressure and velocity terms will
be much larger - essentially gravitational potential energy has been traded for pressure and velocity.

The four major types of turbines are shown schematically in Figure 4.10.
The Pelton wheel is the simplest form of water turbine and is used for high head installations. The
Pelton wheel consists of one or more nozzles which produce a high velocity jet of water these then
impact a series of buckets which divide the Ô¨Çow in two and the Ô¨Çow exits to the side of the machine.
The original patent from Pelton in 1880 is shown in Figure 4.11 which includes details of his bucket
design. The analysis model of the blade is shown on the right hand side of Figure 4.11 essentially
the blade experiences a relative velocity W1 onto the blades which is then turned through some angle
and leaves with velocity kW1 where k is an empirical coefÔ¨Åcient for the reduction in velocity due
to friction with the bucket etc. Analysis of the Pelton wheel is most convenient when the angle Œò is
used in the analysis. The Ô¨Çow is turned through 180‚ó¶‚àíŒò and so the Pelton wheel is a high turning
device as typical values of Œò are ten to twenty degrees.
The Francis turbine is used for moderate head installations and in many ways can be though of as
a centrifugal impeller working in reverse. A cross-section of the device is in Figure 4.10 Ô¨Çow enters
through a volute or scroll casing which is designed to evenly distribute the Ô¨Çow around the periphery
of the inlet guide vanes. The inlet guide vanes increase the angular momentum of the Ô¨Çuid which is
reduced again in the turbine rotor that turns the Ô¨Çow from the radial to the axial direction. The Ô¨Çow
then exits into a draft tube and from there to a river.

Figure 4.12 shows a 3D CAD drawing of a Francis turbine, the real machine is quite complex so
an external view and a view with the top half of the turbine removed are shown. The Francis turbine
shown has two sets of guide vanes the Ô¨Årst at a high radius are Ô¨Åxed in place, the second allow control
of the machine by being pivoted on an axis. Usually these guide vanes can turn to 90‚ó¶so can actually
stop all Ô¨Çow through the machine to allow it to started and stopped. The control mechanism for these
vanes is clearly seen in the external view. The relationship between the three dimensional object and
the sketch in Figure 4.10 should be clear.
The Kaplan turbine is used for low head applications, the operation is very similar to that of a
Francis turbine but the rotor design is different. The blades do not extend to the radial direction, so
the Ô¨Çow is turned before it enters the rotor blade row. This can be seen in Figure 4.13. The Kaplan
turbine impeller is a lot like that of a propeller. The bulb turbine is very similar to an axial Ô¨Çow
turbine, except that the medium is water rather than a gas. Again both turbine types are shown in
Figure 4.10.
4.6
Common Design Choices
One common design choice is to have constant axial velocity: V1x = V2x = V3x
Hence the blade height for turbine must increase as density falls, as seen earlier. There is no
fundamental physical law that produces this constraint it is a design choice, although it is often used.
For multi-stage machines, successive stages are often designed to have identical Ô¨Çow angles and
velocities at corresponding positions in each stage:
V1 = V3 =‚áíŒ±1 = Œ±3 and V1Œ∏ = V3Œ∏

Figure 4.13: Three Dimensional Views of a Kaplan Turbine
This is know as a Repeating Stage where the velocity at inlet is equal to the velocity at exit.
Often we design for axial leaving velocity from a turbomachine. Since for a given Vx the exit
velocity V3 is given by V3 =

V 2
x + V 2
Œ∏3 the minimum exit kinetic energy at exit occurs when
VŒ∏3 = 0 or the Ô¨Çow is entirely in the axial direction. Clearly this condition occurs at Œ±3 = 0 so an
axial leaving condition speciÔ¨Åes the shape of the exit velocity triangle for the stator or rotor row.
These three commonly used design conditions are design choices, although there are many suc-
cessful turbomachines in use that do use these design choices there are some that do not.
4.7
The Turbomachine and System
The turbomachine always operates as part of a system. Pumps are required to deliver Ô¨Çuid at a higher
pressure for water delivery for example, steam turbines receive steam from a boiler and deliver it to a
condenser or some industrial process. The torque from a turbine is either used to generate electricity
or provide mechanical power for gearboxes. The mechanical work for a compressor or a fan comes
from either electrical power (or in the case of a gas turbine engine is taken directly from the turbine).
So both the Ô¨Çuid movement and the work changes from the machine Ô¨Åt into a system.
The apparent exception to this rule are devices such as wind turbines which although they supply
electricity to some sort of load have varying and unpredictable inlet conditions. Even here a great
deal of work is done to ensure that turbines are sited appropriately so that they extract the maximum
amount of energy at a given location and have a minimal visual impact.
The inputs and outputs from the turbomachine are not arbitrary and are usually Ô¨Åxed by external
parameters:
‚Ä¢ For steam turbines the inlet conditions are Ô¨Åxed by the boiler conditions which are dependant

on the type of fuel used in the cycle and the overall thermodynamic cycle that is chosen for the
site. In a steam cycle the exit conditions are Ô¨Åxed by the temperature at which the condenser
cooling Ô¨Çuid can operate at.
‚Ä¢ For aircraft engines the inlet conditions are determined by the operating envelope of the aero-
plane and the exit conditions largely determined by the amount of thrust required from the
engine.
‚Ä¢ For pumps the exit conditions are set by the Ô¨Çow rate required and pressure loss introduced by
the piping system to which the pump is connected to. In the case of moving the Ô¨Çuid from one
location to another the pump also has to supply a pressure equivalent to the change in height
between the two locations as well as any losses in the system.
‚Ä¢ For wind turbines the inlet conditions are set by the location of the wind turbine and the variabil-
ity of the weather. Of all turbomachines wind turbines have the most variable inlet conditions
and ensuring that the design performs over a wind range of inlet conditions is key to producing
a successful turbine.
‚Ä¢ For hydro-electric power systems the available pressure or head is determined by the height
difference between the reservoir and the river into which the Ô¨Çuid is discharged. (See Figure
4.9) The Ô¨Çow-rate is determined by the rainfall for the region in which the hydro system is
located and the capacity of the reservoir. A common strategy is to use the reservoir as an
energy storage system and run the turbines when electrical demand is high, turn them off during
periods of low demand and allow the reservoir level to rise.
How the turbomachine Ô¨Åts into the system is generally beyond the scope of this book but it is
worth remembering the impact that the system will have on the design of the turbomachine.

Application of The Equations of Fluid
Motion
Engineering study of Ô¨Çuid dynamics (and turbomachinery) is built on three sets of equations the
conservation of mass (continuity), conservation of momentum and the conservation of energy.
5.1
Conservation of Mass
Conservation of mass can be simply expressed as ‚Äúwhat goes in must come out‚Äù, in steady state
operation the mass Ô¨Çow of the Ô¨Çuid entering the machine must be matched by mass Ô¨Çow exiting the

machine.
In equation form this is expressed as:
Àôm = œÅAV
(5.1)
Where Àôm is the mass Ô¨Çow, œÅ is the Ô¨Çuid density and A is the cross sectional area and V is the
velocity. For the equation to be valid the velocities and cross sectional areas must be perpendicular
to each other. This will become clearer with the application of the equation to various machines.
The simplest case to examine is that of an axial Ô¨Çow turbine. Consider the meridional view of
the machine shown on the right hand side of Figure 2.4. We denote (as before) the conditions at each
station by a subscript so œÅ2 is the density at station 2 for example. Conservation of mass tells us that:
œÅ1A1V1x = œÅ2A2V2x = œÅ3A3V3x
(5.2)
Note that the axial component of velocity is used, as this is perpendicular to the cross sectional
area under consideration. The cross sectional area of an axial Ô¨Çow turbine is given by the area of an
annulus between the hub radius rh and the tip radius rt:
A = œÄ(r2
t ‚àír2
h)
(5.3)
In turbomachinery applications it is more useful to express the area in terms of the mean radius
rm and the blade height b.
From Figure 2.4 we can see that:
rm = rt + rh
2
=‚áí2rm = rt + rh
(5.4)
and
b = rt ‚àírh
(5.5)
We can rewrite the area (Equation 5.3) and substitute using Equations 5.4 and 5.5:
A = œÄ(r2
t ‚àír2
h) = œÄ(rt + rh)(rt ‚àírh) = œÄ(2rm)(b) = 2œÄrmb
There are therefore two alternative expressions for the cross sectional area in an axial Ô¨Çow turbine:
A = œÄ(r2
t ‚àír2
h) = 2œÄrmb
(5.6)
Conservation of mass provides us with a powerful tool to explain the geometry of many turboma-
chines.
Example
An industrial turbine operates at an 8.8:1 pressure ratio and a mass Ô¨Çow of 77kg/s using
air as the working Ô¨Çuid. The exhaust temperature is at 43‚ó¶C and the inlet temperature to the machine
is around 1000‚ó¶C. The mean blade radius is 0.4 m. The machine is to be designed for a constant
axial velocity of 200 m/s. Estimate the blade heights at entry and exit of the turbine.

63 
Solution
This problem requires us to apply the continuity equation at inlet and exit from the tur-
bine, to do this we need to know the density of the Ô¨Çuid at inlet and exit. This is obtained from basic
Ô¨Çuid dynamics:
p
œÅ = RT
(5.7)
where p is pressure, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. For air R = 287 J/kgK is a
good approximation. The temperature has to be expressed in Kelvin.
At entry to the turbine:
p1 = 8.8 bar = 8.8 √ó 105 Pa and T1 = 1000 + 273 = 1273 K
At exit from the turbine:
p2 = 1.0 bar = 1.0 √ó 105 Pa and T2 = 473 + 273 = 730 K
The corresponding densities are therefore:
œÅ1 =
p1
RT1
= 8.8 √ó 105
287 √ó 1273 = 2.41 kg/m3
œÅ2 =
p2
RT2
= 1.0 √ó 105
287 √ó 710 = 0.49 kg/m3
Finally we apply the continuity equation to obtain the required blade heights:
Àôm = œÅAVx = œÅ2œÄrmbVx =‚áíb =
Àôm
œÅ2œÄrmVx
Since mass Ô¨Çow conservation applies to the turbine (what goes in must come out!). This can then be
applied to the entry and exit of the turbine.
b1 =
77
2.41 √ó 2œÄ √ó 0.4 √ó 200 = 0.06 m
b2 =
77
0.49 √ó 2œÄ √ó 0.4 √ó 200 = 0.31 m
This is shown approximately to scale in Figure 5.1. The turbine is split into three stages each with
a stator and rotor. The design is for a constant mean radius although it is equally possible to design
for a constant inner or outer diameter. The key point is that Equation 5.1 can explain why the blade
height changes through a typical gas turbine. This is based on the assumption that the axial velocity
remains constant, a common design choice that is discussed later.
5.1.1
Application to Radial Machines
The application to radial machines is straightforward but requires a good understanding of the geom-
etry of these machines. Figure 5.2 shows the meridional view of a radial and a centrifugal impeller.
For the radial turbine (shown on the left) the application of continuity is straightforward. The Ô¨Çow

Figure 5.1: Meridional View of a Gas Turbine
perpendicular to the cross sectional area of interest is the radial velocity and the cross sectional area
is given by the area of a cylinder face with a depth given by the blade height b and a circumference
given by 2œÄr, that is A = 2œÄrb so the continuity equation becomes:
œÅ1A1V1r = œÅ2A2V2r =‚áíœÅ12œÄr1b1V1r = œÅ22œÄr2b2V2r
So for machines operating at constant density and constant radial velocity then b2 < b1. The
blade height falls as the radius increases.
The application to centrifugal machines (right hand side of Figure 5.2) requires slightly more care.
At exit the continuity equation is the same but at inlet different velocities and areas are needed. At
inlet the velocity is the axial velocity and the perpendicular area is the annulus between the hub and
the tip of the blades. So A = 2œÄrmb where rm is the mean radius at inlet to the machine. Therefore
the continuity equation becomes:
Àôm1 = œÅ1A1V1x = œÅ12œÄr1mbV1x
and for station 2:
Àôm2 = œÅ2A2V1r = œÅ22œÄr2bV2r
The most useful application of these equations is that given a mass Ô¨Çow and a machine geometry
the velocities inside the machine can be calculated.
5.2
Conservation of Momentum
Newton‚Äôs second law of motion can be applied to rotational as well as linear systems in words: ‚Äútorque
is equal to the rate of change of angular momentum‚Äù. In equation form this is given by:

Basic Concepts in Turbomachinery
 
65 
Figure 5.2: Meridional Views of Radial and Centrifugal Machines
T = dL
dt
(5.8)
Where T is the torque, L is the angular momentum and t is time. In linear motion force is equal
to the rate of change of momentum in the system which is the well known form of Newton‚Äôs second
law.
We now apply Equation 5.8 to the Ô¨Çow through a turbomachinery passage shown in Figure 5.3
with an entry station 1 and an exit station 2. The passage varies in radius from station 1 to station 2
and can be any shape (though in the Ô¨Ågure the radius change is linear), the passage is bounded by a
hub and a casing so mass Ô¨Çow is conserved through the turbomachinery passage.
The velocity through this passage may differ between entry and exit but at either of those stations
is uniform. The left hand side of Figure 5.3 shows a cross sectional view of the turbomachinery
passage at entry and at the top a representative velocity vector decomposed into radial and tangential
components is shown. This vector would have the same value of radial and tangential components no
matter where on the circumference of the passage at entry we chose to measure it. This is illustrated
by drawing the same vector at 3 o‚Äôclock, 6 o‚Äôclock and 9 o‚Äôclock on the cross section at entry to the
annulus. A similar exercise can be carried out at exit from the turbomachinery passage.
Angular momentum is given by the moment of momentum or:
L = mVŒ∏r
(5.9)
Where m represents the mass. So at entry to the turbomachinery passage the angular momentum
is m1V1Œ∏r1 and at exit from the passage is m2V2Œ∏r2. So the change in angular momentum between
entry and exit is:
m2V2Œ∏r2 ‚àím1V1Œ∏r1
Application of The Equations of Fluid Motion

66 
and the time rate of change is given by:
m2V2Œ∏r2 ‚àím1V1Œ∏r1
t
= Àôm2V2Œ∏r2 ‚àíÀôm1V1Œ∏r1 = Àôm(V2Œ∏r2 ‚àíV1Œ∏r1)
Since ‚Äúwhat goes in must come out‚Äù Àôm1 =
Àôm2. The time rate of angular momentum is equal to
the torque we have:
T = Àôm(V2Œ∏r2 ‚àíV1Œ∏r1)
(5.10)
Recall from basic mechanics that power is torque times rotational speed then:
P = Tœâ = Àômœâ(V2Œ∏r2 ‚àíV1Œ∏r1)
(5.11)
Where œâ is the rotational speed of the device. It is very useful in turbomachinery to work in terms
of quantities per unit of mass going through the turbine, so we divide Equation 5.11 by the mass to
give one of the most important equations in the book:
w = œâ(V2Œ∏r2 ‚àíV1Œ∏r1)
(5.12)
This is known as the Euler Turbomachinery Equation. The Euler equation applies to all types
of turbomachinery, from wind turbines to pumps to gas turbines, whether they be axial Ô¨Çow, radial
Ô¨Çow or a mixed Ô¨Çow device. It also applies to either energy extraction devices (turbines) or energy
delivery devices (compressors, fans or pumps).
There are a number of important points that this equation brings to light:

Figure 5.3: A Generic Turbomachinery Flow Passage
‚Ä¢ For a turbine the Euler equation will give a negative value and for a compressor it will give
a positive value. The energy Ô¨Çows are in different directions so it is reasonable that they be
of different signs! It is common when dealing with turbines to multiply the right hand side of
Equation 5.12 by -1 to avoid continually have to write negative signs in front of every calcu-
lation. Some authors (e.g. Dixon (2005)) refer to different forms of the Euler equation to deal
with this circumstance but in this book we will stick with Equation 5.12.
‚Ä¢ The power input or output is given entirely by the change in angular momentum. This is
determined by the turning done by the Ô¨Çuid in the turbomachinery passage which is controlled
by the blade angles of the turbomachine. In short: work input or output is determined by
the Ô¨Çow turning - this is one of the fundamental concepts of turbomachinery and is vital to
understanding the operation of all these important devices.
‚Ä¢ Finally we note that since angular momentum (Equation 5.9) is the product of mass, radius and
tangential velocity that changes in radius can also inÔ¨Çuence the power output or input. So radial
Ô¨Çow machines tend to deliver or absorb much more power per stage than a corresponding axial
Ô¨Çow device.
Example
A turbine stage with a rotational speed of 3000 rpm is to be designed with an absolute
inlet angle of 60‚ó¶and an absolute exit angle of ‚àí60‚ó¶at a mean radius of 0.4 m. The machine is to be
designed for a constant axial velocity of 450 m/s. Estimate the speciÔ¨Åc work from this stage.
Solution
This is a straightforward application of the Euler work equation (Equation 5.12), but
since the mean radius is constant r1 = r2 and we can simplify somewhat.
w = œâ(V2Œ∏r2 ‚àíV1Œ∏r1) = œâr(V2Œ∏ ‚àíV1Œ∏) = U(V2Œ∏ ‚àíV1Œ∏)
Here the blade speed is obtained easily:

Figure 5.4: Isolated Aerofoil compared to a Cascade
The tangential velocities are obtained from the velocity triangle. This example is straight forward
the absolute inlet and exit angles are given. From Chapter 2:
VŒ∏ = Vx tan Œ±
So at inlet to the stage:
V1Œ∏ = 450 tan 60 = 779 m/s
and at exit from the stage:
V2Œ∏ = 450 tan ‚àí60 = ‚àí779 m/s
The speciÔ¨Åc work from this stage is given by:
w = 125.6 √ó (‚àí779 ‚àí779) = ‚àí195.8 kJ/kg
5.2.1
The Difference Between a Single Aerofoil and a Cascade of Blades
This is a good point to explain the differences between a single aerofoil and the operation of a linear
cascade. The operation of a single aerofoil is much closer to most common experience - nearly every-
one has been on an aeroplane for example. In this book we do not discuss the detailed mechanisms
of how an aerofoil works there are other excellent explanations of this phenomenon such as Babinsky
(2003). SufÔ¨Åce to say that when an isolated aerofoil (Left hand side of Figure 5.4) meets an oncom-
ing stream of Ô¨Çuid a lift force is produced. A small drag force is also produced. The aerofoil exerts
and equal and opposite force onto the stream of Ô¨Çuid but since the mass of the incoming stream is
effectively inÔ¨Ånite the net deÔ¨Çection of the Ô¨Çow is zero.
In the case of the cascade shown on the right hand side of Figure 5.4 the aerofoil operates on a
Ô¨Ånite mass of air as the upper and lower blades of the cascade limit the area that a single blade can
operate on. With a Ô¨Ånite mass the reaction to the lift force produces a net deÔ¨Çection on the Ô¨Çow.

This actually provides an alternative derivation of the Euler Turbomachinery Equation. Consider
the control volume drawn around the blade on the right hand side of Figure 5.4. The force exerted
on the Ô¨Çuid is given by the rate change of momentum of the Ô¨Çuid - which is Newton‚Äôs second law
of motion. The momentum at stage 1 is m1 ‚ÉóV1 and the momentum at stage 2 is m2 ‚ÉóV2, since we are
normally interested in the force in the tangential direction and the velocities are normally steady the
rate of change of momentum and force in the tangential direction is given by:
FŒ∏ = m2V2Œ∏ ‚àím1V1Œ∏
t
= Àôm(V2Œ∏ ‚àíV1Œ∏)
Torque is then given by the tangential force times the radius and power is the torque times the
rotational speed:
T = FŒ∏rm =‚áíP = FŒ∏rmœâ = rmœâ Àôm(V2Œ∏ ‚àíV1Œ∏)
Again we divide through by the mass Ô¨Çow to give the power per unit of mass Ô¨Çowing through the
turbomachine:
w = P
Àôm = rmœâ(V2Œ∏ ‚àíV1Œ∏)
(5.13)
Equation 5.13 is a less general form of the equation obtained earlier using angular momentum
(Equation 5.12) as it relies on the assumption of constant radius between entry and exit of the control
volume - something that is not true of all turbomachine geometries.
5.3
Conservation of Energy and Rothalpy
The conservation of energy can be applied to a turbomachinery blade row as well, this leads to a
new concept called rothalpy. For simple design a very large amount of information can be obtained
without recourse to Rothalpy but the concept simpliÔ¨Åes more advanced work.
The steady Ô¨Çow energy equation is applied to the Ô¨Çow between station 1 and station 2 of a turbine
or a compressor. The blade may or may not be in a rotor row. The steady Ô¨Çow energy equation applied
to the turbine shown in Figure 2.5 is given by:
Àôq + Àôw = Àôm

(h2 ‚àíh1) + 1
2(V 2
2 ‚àíV 2
1 ) + g(z2 ‚àíz1)

(5.14)
There are two simpliÔ¨Åcations that can be immediately applied to this equation. Firstly any height
changes through the machine will be negligible compared to the changes in velocity and enthalpy so
the z2 ‚àíz1 term will be zero.
Secondly the heat transfer to and from the Ô¨Çuid in the machine will also be zero, Àôq = 0. This
second assumption requires some explanation as we also apply this to turbomachines where the tem-
perature of the Ô¨Çuid is around 1500 K. The reasoning is that the velocity of the Ô¨Çuid is high enough
that the amount of time a given particle of Ô¨Çuid spends inside the machine is very small so there is
no opportunity for heat transfer for take place. In reality of course the outside of a high temperature
turbomachine will get very hot but the heat transfer through the machine casing will be very small
compared to the work transfers taking place inside the device.

If a moving Ô¨Çuid is brought to rest in an isentropic (or fully reversible) manner different values
of temperature and pressure will be obtained than if measurements were taken with the Ô¨Çuid still
moving. The values of temperature and pressure thus obtained are known as the stagnation conditions
and those obtained whilst the Ô¨Çuid is moving are known as the static conditions. The same concept
of static and stagnation conditions can be applied to the quantity enthalpy:
h0 = h + V 2
2
(5.15)
where ho is known as the stagnation enthalpy and h is called the static enthalpy.
Equation 5.14 can be further simpliÔ¨Åed to:
Àôw = Àôm [h02 ‚àíh01]
(5.16)
Equation 5.16 is important as it relates the work output or input from the turbomachine to the
change in Ô¨Çuid properties between the inlet and the exit of the machine. The method for determining
h0 varies depending on the type of Ô¨Çuid.

5.3.1
Rothalpy
Note that Àôw/ Àôm is the speciÔ¨Åc work w so the equation is further simpliÔ¨Åed to:
w = h02 ‚àíh01
But the Euler Turbomachinery Equation (Equation 5.12) also contains an expression for w, so
Equation 5.14 becomes:
w = U2V2Œ∏ ‚àíU1V1Œ∏ = h02 ‚àíh01 =‚áíh01 ‚àíU1V1Œ∏ = h02 ‚àíU2V2Œ∏
DeÔ¨Åne a new quantity called rothalpy given by:
I = h0 ‚àíUVŒ∏
(5.17)
From the re-arrangement of the SFEE energy equation, rothalpy is constant from station 1 to
station 2, I1 = I2, which leads to the general principle that the conservation of energy applied to
turbomachines can be expressed as ‚Äúover a blade row rothalpy is constant‚Äù.
Rothalpy is conserved over a blade row (stator or rotor) and not a stage (stator plus rotor). The
value of rothalpy at the stator/rotor interface will clearly change as the stagnation enthalpy h0 will be
the same but the blade speed U will be different depending on whether or not one is considering the
rotor or the stator.
5.3.2
Rothalpy in Stators and Rotors
For a stator Rothalpy conservation is straightforward, since U = 0, rothalpy conservation from stator
entry at station 1 to stator exit at station 2 yields:
I1 = I2 =‚áíh01 = h02
Or in words - in a stator the stagnation enthalpy is conserved. For a rotor the situation is more
complex. Consider a generic velocity triangle in Figure 5.5 from which we will derive some general
relationships between relative and absolute velocity. Since the relationships are general no subscripts
are used to indicated a particular station, the relationships could apply to any station. Some of these
were discussed in Chapter 2 when the concept of velocity triangles was introduced but are worth
repeating here.
Two relationships are obvious from the triangle:
Vx = Wx and VŒ∏ = U + WŒ∏
Pythagoras‚Äôs rule can be applied to the absolute velocity, ‚ÉóV :
V 2 = V 2
x + V 2
Œ∏

Figure 5.5: Generic Velocity Triangle
We can then substitute the two obvious relationships so:
V 2 = V 2
x + V 2
Œ∏ = W 2
x + (WŒ∏ + U)2 = W 2 + 2WŒ∏U + U2
So we can express the absolute velocity magnitude V in terms of relative velocities and the blade
speed:
V 2 = W 2 + 2WŒ∏U + U2
(5.18)
Now consider a rotor row with entry (point 1) and exit (point 2):
I1 = I2 =‚áíh01 ‚àíUV1Œ∏ = h02 ‚àíUV2Œ∏
expanding out the h0 term yields:
h1 + V 2

2 ‚àíUV1Œ∏ = h2 + V 2

Consider the left hand side of this equation
LHS = h1 + V 2

LHS = h1 + W 2

h0rel = h + W 2
2
(5.19)
Apply this to the right hand side of the equation as well as the left rothalpy conservation for a
rotor row reduces to:
h0rel1 ‚àíU2
1
2 = h0rel2 ‚àíU2
2
2
(5.20)
where station 1 is the entry to the rotor row and station 2 is the exit to the rotor row.
Equation 5.20 brings out two signiÔ¨Åcant points about turbomachinery:
‚Ä¢ Firstly for axial machines with little change of radius U1 = Uw so rothalpy conservation is
equivalent to conservation of relative stagnation enthalpy. Compare this with the stator case
where rothalpy conservation is equivalent to conservation of stagnation enthalpy. Constant
relative stagnation enthalpy implies that no work is done in the relative rotor coordinate system
- which may be confusing but there is no movement in this coordinate system as the observer is
attached to the rotor blades - therefore in this coordinate system there is no work. The energy
inputs or outputs depend on the coordinate system chosen but the pressure and temperature are
independent of the coordinate system chosen.
‚Ä¢ Secondly the U2 term can be rewritten:
U2
2 = (œâr)2
2
and can be thought of as the potential energy of a centrifugal force Ô¨Åeld due to rotation. With
the same rotational speed a higher radius object will have a higher tangential velocity.

Problems
1. An industrial gas turbine operates at an 8.8:1 pressure ratio and a mass Ô¨Çow of 77 kg/s. The
exhaust temperature is at 437‚ó¶C and the inlet temperature to the machine is around 1000‚ó¶C.
The machine is to be designed for a constant axial velocity of 200 m/s. (This data is based on
the Rolls-Royce Avon, an engine that dates from the 1950s but is still used as low efÔ¨Åciency
high reliability engine for stationary power such as pipeline pumping.)
For this gas turbine, draw to scale the meridional view with:
(a) a constant mean radius of 0.4 m.
(b) a constant outer diameter (to minimise cross sectional area) of 1.05 m.
2. Consider an axial compressor rotor blade row. The inlet velocity is 150 m/s and is in the
axial direction. The blade speed is 180 m/s and the relative outlet angle is ‚àí30‚ó¶to the axial.
The axial velocity is constant across the row. Calculate the relative Ô¨Çow angle at inlet and the
absolute swirl velocity at exit and the absolute Ô¨Çow angle. Calculate also the speciÔ¨Åc work
output. Answers: ‚àí50.2‚ó¶; 93.4 m/s, +31.9‚ó¶, 16.8 kJ/kg

EfÔ¨Åciency and Reaction
6.1
EfÔ¨Åciency
There are over one hundred different ways of deÔ¨Åning the efÔ¨Åciency of a turbomachine, though only
one of them will be discussed in this book. Consider a turbine on a h-s diagram, Figure 6.1.
Three points are shown on this diagram 1 the entry condition to the machine, 3 the real exit
condition and 3s the isentropic (or ideal) exit condition. (We use 3 rather than 2 as we will consider
the stator/rotor interface as 2 later) Since the real exit condition will contain irreversibility‚Äôs due to
Ô¨Çuid friction, heat transfer over a Ô¨Ånite temperature difference and so on the entropy in the real case
increases meaning the line 1 to 3 is a diagonal. The ideal process is a straight line on the chart as the

Figure 6.1: Enthalpy-Entropy Diagram for a Turbine
change in entropy is zero for an reversible process.
One of the reasons there are hundreds of deÔ¨Ånitions of efÔ¨Åciency is that there are various ways
of accounting for the kinetic of the Ô¨Çow at inlet and outlet. Recall that for each location in a Ô¨Çuid
machine there is a static condition and a corresponding stagnation condition. The stagnation condition
is the condition that occurs when the Ô¨Çuid is brought reversibly to rest so the entropy is the same
between the static and stagnation conditions. For the turbine stage on the h-s diagram (Figure 6.1) at
each condition 1,3 and 3s there is a corresponding stagnation condition 01,03 and 03s which are also
plotted.
Note that the difference between static and stagnation conditions is always a vertical line on the
h-s chart as it is by deÔ¨Ånition an isentropic process. h0 = h + V 2
2 by deÔ¨Ånition, so the vertical length
of the line is V 2
2 .
EfÔ¨Åciency can be deÔ¨Åned in terms of actual work output and ideal work output. For a turbine, the
Isentropic Total-to-Total EfÔ¨Åciency is the ratio:
Actual Work Output
Ideal Work Output = wA
wI
=‚áíŒ∑it = h03 ‚àíh01
h03s ‚àíh01
(6.1)
The ideal work output is always greater than the actual work output, the real (non-deal) process
serves to reduce the power output of the device. Note that the work output will be negative which is a
matter of sign convention, if the work output for turbines is negative the work input for compressors
is positive - one has to pick one to be negative! Often however designers deal with only turbines and
make the work output positive to avoid writing minus signs in front of every calculation.
Figure 6.2 shows the h-s diagram for a compressor or pump. Since compressors deliver energy to
the Ô¨Çuid the net result is a rise in pressure. For a compressor the ideal work is always less than the
actual. The isentropic total to total efÔ¨Åciency for a compressor is given by:

Example
A compressor stage working on air at 1 bar and 25‚ó¶C has a work input of 17 kJ/kg
and an isentropic efÔ¨Åciency of 0.9. The velocity at inlet and exit is the same. Assuming that the air
properties are unchanged over the stage calculate the pressure output of the stage.
Solution
The work input is the speciÔ¨Åc work input so and since the velocity at inlet and exit are
the same V3 = V1 the difference between static and stagnation enthalpies is the same.
wA = h3 ‚àíh1 = 17 kJ/kg
Since we can approximate air as a perfect gas (Cp = 1.01 kJ/kgK):
CpŒîT = Œîh =‚áíŒîT = Œîh
CP
=‚áíT3 ‚àíT1 = 17
1.01 = 16.83 K
The efÔ¨Åciency for a compressor using a perfect gas can be expressed in terms of temperature rises:

h3 ‚àíh1
= T3s ‚àíT1
T3 ‚àíT1

6.1.1
Using EfÔ¨Åciency
Actual efÔ¨Åciencies can be determined by either measurement or computationally intensive simulations
of the Ô¨Çuid Ô¨Çow through a turbomachine. For the purposes of this book they will simply be based on
given values. Isentropic efÔ¨Åciencies of over 90% have been reported for turbines and compressors are
typically a few percent less efÔ¨Åcient.
The key point is that efÔ¨Åciency provides a link between the work from Ô¨Çow geometry (Euler work
equation) and the actual enthalpy or pressure change in the Ô¨Çuid.
‚Ä¢ For a steam turbine the ideal work is given by: wI = h01 ‚àíh03s. Finding the ideal work
involves determining the enthalpies at inlet and exit. At inlet h1 is determined from the h-s
diagram or steam tables given inlet pressure and temperature. The exit condition h3s is derived
from an isentropic expansion (vertical line on the h-s chart) and a known exit pressure.
‚Ä¢ For a gas turbine the ideal work is obtained using the ideal gas laws:
wI = h01 ‚àíh3s = CpT01

‚Ä¢ For a pump operating on an incompressible Ô¨Çuid (water or low speed gas Ô¨Çow) then the ideal
work can also be obtained from an equation:
wI = h01 ‚àíh03s = Œîp
œÅ = gŒîH0
where ŒîH0 is the change in total head across the turbine.

Example
A steam turbine stage operates with inlet conditions of 120bar and 500‚ó¶, the exit pressure
is 10 bar. If the efÔ¨Åciency of the stage is 90% calculate the speciÔ¨Åc work output.
Solution
The strategy here is to look up h1 and h3s from a suitable set of Steam Tables such as
Rogers and Mayhew (1994) and then use the efÔ¨Åciency to get the actual work out.
From steam tables or a Mollier Chart:
h1 : 120 bar, 500‚ó¶C = 3350 kJ/kg
Sketch a line of constant entropy on the Mollier chart from point 1 to the 10 bar line or interpolate
using tables to determine h3s:
h3s = 2730 kJ/kg
rearranging the deÔ¨Ånition of turbine efÔ¨Åciency (Equation 6.1) the actual work is:
wA = Œ∑it(h3s ‚àíh1) = 0.9 √ó (2730 ‚àí3350) = ‚àí558 kJ/kg
The answer is negative as our sign convention is that energy transfers out of the system are negative,
but generally such sign conventions are not important in turbomachinery as one normally knows
whether the device is supposed to extract or deliver energy!
6.1.2
Other EfÔ¨Åciency DeÔ¨Ånitions
In this book only the total to total efÔ¨Åciency (using only h0) in deÔ¨Ånitions of efÔ¨Åciency is used but
using static or stagnation conditions in the deÔ¨Ånitions of efÔ¨Åciency allows the kinetic energy of the
leaving Ô¨Çuid to be used in different ways:
1. Where the exit kinetic energy is useful for example for thrust in a jet engine, or subsequent
stages in a multi-stage machine. In this case the energy is not part of the maximum work
available.
2. Where the exit kinetic energy is not useful for example in the last stage of a steam turbine
exhausting to the condenser, or a hydraulic turbine where the water Ô¨Çows away done the exit
pipe. An ideal turbine would make use of that exit kinetic energy so it must be included in the
deÔ¨Ånition of the maximum work available.
These different cases explain why other deÔ¨Ånitions of efÔ¨Åciency may be used.
6.2
Reaction
There are three difÔ¨Åcult ideas presented in this book. The cascade view, velocity triangles and the
concept of reaction. Once these three concepts have been mastered they open the door to a much
wider understanding of turbomachinery which is why this book concentrates on them. The third
concept to master is that of Reaction which is deÔ¨Åned as the ratio of the static enthalpy drop through
the rotor divided by the static enthalpy drop through the stage. Or in equation form:

R = ŒîhROTOR
ŒîhSTAGE
Recall from basic thermodynamics that:
Tds = dh ‚àí1
œÅdp = 0
If the process is isentropic ds = 0 then:
dh = 1
œÅdp =‚áíŒîp ‚âà1
œÅŒîh
Most turbomachines are quite efÔ¨Åcient so approximating their operation as isentropic is reason-
able. This means that enthalpy drops can be approximated as pressure drops and gives the widely
used deÔ¨Ånition of Reaction:
R = ŒîhROTOR
ŒîhSTAGE
‚âàŒîpROTOR
ŒîpSTAGE
(6.3)
Consider the turbine shown in Figure 2.4 on page 25 and in the context of Reaction a number of
questions arise: How should we assign the pressure drop of the stage between the stator and the rotor?
What blade angles do we need to set to obtain the desired pressure drops? What levels of reaction are
desirable? These are questions that we will answer next and in Chapter 8.
6.3
Reaction on the h ‚àís Diagram
It is possible to show the level of reaction of a particular turbomachine on the h-s chart and get a good
understanding of what is going inside a turbomachine as a result. This can get somewhat complex
so the chart is built up in stages. Firstly consider Figure 6.3 which shows a real process in a turbine
expanding from pressure p1 to pressure p3. The geometry over which this takes place can be seen in
meridional and cascade view in Figure 2.4 on page 25. So station 1 is the stator inlet, station 2 is the
rotor/stator interface and station 3 is the rotor exit. The intermediate pressure p2 is shown in Figure
6.3 along with the static and stagnation conditions at 1 and 3.
We now consider station 2 on the h-s diagram in more detail. For the stator 1 to 2 h01 = h02
because no work is done in the stator we can then add a point 02 to the h-s diagram showing this. Since
the difference between stagnation and static enthalpy is given by V 2
2 we can draw the corresponding
velocity magnitudes on the h-s chart for V1,V2 and V3. This done in Figure 6.4.
Now since the stagnation enthalpy is constant:
h01 = h02 = h1 + V 2

2 = h2 + V 2

=‚áíh1 ‚àíh2 = V 2

From Figure 6.4: V2 > V1 so there is a static enthalpy drop in the stator. For a turbine the Ô¨Çow is
accelerated in the stator.

Basic Concepts in Turbomachinery

The level of static enthalpy or pressure drop is controlled by the velocity V2 for high values of
V2 the pressure drop is greater. V2 is set by turbomachine geometry so we can control the level of
reaction in the turbine by altering the blade angles and blade height through the machine.
Finally we consider a turbine where the mean radius is the same so the blade speed U is the
same at entry to and exit from the rotor. This restricts the generality of our diagram somewhat but
this condition is true of a great deal of axial Ô¨Çow turbines and provides some useful insights. If the
blade speed is the same through the turbine the relative stagnation enthalpy will be constant through
the rotor blade (See Chapter 5). Two new points are added to the h-s diagram 03R and 02R which
represent the relative stagnation enthalpy at points 2 and 3 respectively, this is shown in Figure 6.5.
Points 03R and 02R lie above the corresponding static conditions 2 and 3 and the distance between
them is given by W 2
2 from the deÔ¨Ånition of relative stagnation enthalpy. Figure 6.5 shows that for an
axial Ô¨Çow turbine the Ô¨Çow is accelerated through a turbine W3 > W2.
Reaction is often a cause of some confusion for students. This is because intuitively one might
expect the power output from a stage to depend on the pressure drop across it - but as we showed with
Equation 5.12 the work input or output from a turbomachine depends entirely on the Ô¨Çow turning the
rotor row. The relationship between pressure drop and velocity change can be seen in the enthalpy-
entropy diagram in Figure 6.5.
The effect of the real process irreversibilities can also be seen in Figure 6.5, an ideal process is
a straight line (Œîs = 0). So if the process was ideal it could be drawn on the h-s diagram using a
vertical line from 01 to the pressure p2, the velocity V2 would then be larger than in the real (Œîs > 0)
case.

Problems
Note that some of these problems use the same data as previous chapter problems so if you have kept
your answers you may save some time.
1. An axial compressor has a rotor blade row where the inlet velocity is 150 m/s and is in the
axial direction. The blade speed is 180 m/s and the relative outlet angle is ‚àí30‚ó¶to the axial.
The axial velocity is constant across the row.
These rotor blades are followed by a set of stator blades to form a complete stage. The stators
turn the Ô¨Çow back to the axial direction and the axial velocity is constant across the whole
stage. If the total-to-total efÔ¨Åciency is 90%, calculate the total pressure at outlet from the stage.
Assume air properties with inlet stagnation conditions of 20‚ó¶and 1.0 bar. Answer: 1.187 bar
2. Calculate the reaction of the stage in the previous question. Answer: 0.74
3. The Ô¨Çow at exit from a turbine stator row has a velocity of 100 m/s at an angle (Œ±2) of 70‚ó¶
to the axial direction. The rotor row is moving with a velocity of 50 m/s. At exit from the
rotor row the relative Ô¨Çow angle (Œ≤3) is ‚àí60‚ó¶. The axial velocity is constant across the row.
Calculate the power output for a Ô¨Çow rate of 4kg/s. Calculate the total pressure drop across the
stage if the efÔ¨Åciency is 90 % and the Ô¨Çuid density is constant at 1.2 kg/m3. Calculate also the
static pressure drop. What is the stage reaction? Answers: 20.6kW, 6.88kPa, 6.93kPa,0.154

Dimensionless Parameters for
Turbomachinery
Dimensionless coefÔ¨Åcients are a very useful technique to bring out trends between groups of variables
in Ô¨Çuid mechanics. Further details can be found in basic Ô¨Çuid mechanics texts Massey (1989) but
essentially the technique works by constructing physically plausible relationships between variables.
Consider the relationship between static pressure, dynamic head and stagnation pressure for example:
po = p + œÅV 2
2
For this relationship to be physically possible œÅV 2 must have the same units as pressure, in simple

terms one cannot count two oranges and expect to end up with an apple!
Pressure can be explained as a force per unit area, force can be expressed as a mass times an
acceleration so the units of pressure will be given by:
mass √ó acceleration
area
= mass √ó length
time2
length2
=
mass
time2 √ó length
The units of œÅV 2 can similarly be expressed:
density √ó velocity =
mass
length3
length2
time2
=
mass
time2 √ó length
Therefore the equation is said to be dimensionally correct. Using this principle one can construct
a number of dimensionless parameters or dimensionless coefÔ¨Åcients. For example reaction is a di-
mensionless coefÔ¨Åcient as the units on the top of the expression cancel the units on the bottom of the
expression.
Dimensionless parameters provide a number of advantages:
1. With an appropriate choice of dimensionless parameters the performance of machines can be
characterised using only a few key variables.
2. Given data on one size of machine performance can be predicted at different sizes.
3. Given data on one set of operating conditions behaviour at different operating conditions can
be predicted
4. Enable designers to pick a particular machine shape of maximum efÔ¨Åciency.
Which dimensionless parameters are important depends very much on the application area several
of which are discussed in turn.
7.1
CoefÔ¨Åcients for Axial Machines
For axial Ô¨Çow turbines there are four dimensionless coefÔ¨Åcients that have been found to be important.
The Ô¨Årst of these is the Ô¨Çow coefÔ¨Åcient:
œÜ = Vx
Um
(7.1)
which is the axial velocity divided by the mean blade speed. For a given blade speed and height
this gives some idea of the Ô¨Çow through the machine.
The second of these is the stage loading coefÔ¨Åcient or work coefÔ¨Åcient:
Œ® = wx
U2m
= Œîho
U2m
(7.2)
which is a measure of the work done in a stage. The other two important coefÔ¨Åcients are the
efÔ¨Åciency Œ∑ and the reaction R.

Table 7.1: Typical Values of Œ® and Œ¶
Figure 7.1: Velocity triangles for exit and inlet combined
In general the designer of turbomachinery blading does not have complete freedom to determine
the dimensionless coefÔ¨Åcients that the design will operate at. For example the mean blade speed is
often Ô¨Åxed by mechanical considerations, or the rotation frequency of the machine is Ô¨Åxed by the
frequency of the electrical supply and the number of poles in the electrical generator. The stage
loading is often Ô¨Åxed by the number of stages and the required enthalpy drop in the machine.
Table 7.1 shows some typical values of the stage loading and Ô¨Çow coefÔ¨Åcients for aircraft engines.
Note the much lower loading for compressors compared to turbines, the reason for this is that com-
pressors operate in an adverse pressure gradient. That is compressors have a higher pressure at exit
than they do at inlet and this makes the boundary layers along the blade surfaces much more likely to
separate. The aerodynamic design is then much more challenging than for a turbine so lower levels
of loading are applied.
For an axial Ô¨Çow turbine the mean blade speed is usually constant across a blade row as there
are no large radius changes in most axial Ô¨Çow turbines. It is impossible to change the blade speed
œâ within a blade row. It is therefore often convenient to plot the exit velocity triangle and the inlet
velocity triangle on top of one another (Figure 7.1.
Now the Euler equation (Equation 5.12) gives:
w = œâ(V2Œ∏r2 ‚àíV1Œ∏r1) = UmŒîVŒ∏

So substituting this into the expression for work coefÔ¨Åcient:
Œ® = w
U2m
=
1
Um
ŒîVŒ∏
and remembering the deÔ¨Ånition of Ô¨Çow coefÔ¨Åcient:
œÜ = Vx
Um
Two things become apparent:
‚Ä¢ For a given blade speed Um: Œ® gives the width of the diagram
‚Ä¢ For constant axial velocity Vx: œÜ gives the height of the diagram
The representation in Figure 7.1 is compact and is often used when designing axial Ô¨Çow ma-
chines, especially when large numbers of stages have to be put together - in this book the emphasis is
simplicity not compactness so it is not used very much.
One of the key points to take away from Figure 7.1 is that given a constant blade speed and axial
velocity changing the dimensionless coefÔ¨Åcients has a direct bearing on the Ô¨Çow angles. So for the
triangles shown in Figure 7.1 if the stage loading coefÔ¨Åcient is reduced for example but the Ô¨Çow
coefÔ¨Åcient and blade speed kept the same, so U and Vx are constant then the absolute Ô¨Çow angles Œ±1
and Œ±3 will reduce. There is a direct link between machine geometry and dimensionless coefÔ¨Åcients.
Finally an important simpliÔ¨Åcation with constant blade speed is that since VŒ∏ = Um + WŒ∏ then
ŒîVŒ∏ = ŒîWŒ∏
Example
Given a turbine blade row with constant axial velocity of 150m/s at 5000rpm on a mean
radius of 0.7 m and an absolute Ô¨Çow angle at exit from the stator of 70‚ó¶. The turbine operates with
axial leaving Ô¨Çow and is a repeating stage. Calculate the Ô¨Çow coefÔ¨Åcient, stage loading coefÔ¨Åcient
and reaction.
Solution
This problem is a straightforward application of dimensionless coefÔ¨Åcients. First calcu-
late the mean blade speed:
Um = œâr = 5000 √ó 2œÄ
60 √ó 0.7 = 366.5 m/s
œÜ = Vx
Um
= 150
366.5 = 0.409
œà = w
U2m
= Um(V3Œ∏ ‚àíV2Œ∏)
U2m
= V3Œ∏ ‚àíV2Œ∏
Um
Now the turbine row is axial leaving so V3Œ∏ = 0 from the generic velocity triangle:
V2Œ∏ = Vx tan Œ±2 = 150 tan 70 = 412.12 m/s
so the stage loading coefÔ¨Åcient is:
œà = 412.12
366.5 = 1.124

Reaction is given by R = ŒîhROTOR/ŒîhSTAGE. The stage enthalpy drop is given by the work
output as the turbine has repeating stages so V1 = V3.
ŒîhSTAGE = Œîh0 = w = Um(ŒîVŒ∏) = 366.5(412.12) = 151.04 kJ/kg
From Figure 6.5 we see that the static enthalpy drop across the rotor is given by:
ŒîhROTOR = W 2
3 ‚àíW 2
2
2
= W 2
3Œ∏ ‚àíW 2
2Œ∏
2
Since the turbine axial velocity is constant W2x = W3x and so:
ŒîhROTOR = W 2
3Œ∏ ‚àíW 2
2Œ∏
2
However since we have constant blade speed ŒîWŒ∏ = ŒîVŒ∏ so:
ŒîhROTOR = 412.122 + 02
2
= 84.92 kJ/kg
Which means that the reaction is given by R = 84.92/151.04 = 0.56
7.2
CoefÔ¨Åcients for Wind Turbines
For wind turbines two coefÔ¨Åcients are in widespread use, the Ô¨Årst CP or power coefÔ¨Åcient is essen-
tially an efÔ¨Åciency by a different name:
CP = Power from Turbine

where P is the power output, V is the velocity of the wind and A is the swept area of the machine.
The second coefÔ¨Åcient is the tip speed ratio, which is the ratio of the wind speed to the tangential
velocity of the tip of the turbine:
Œª = œârtip
V
(7.4)
Performance of wind turbines is usually presented as CP vs Œª curve, this is often called a ‚Äúpower
curve‚Äù. A power curve for a Nordex N80 turbine 1which produces 2.5MW at full power is shown
in Figure 7.2. The power curve shows a characteristic of many turbomachinery devices, that there is
distinct peak in efÔ¨Åciency with a lower device effectiveness away from the design point.
Example
Given the power curve shown in Figure 7.2. Calculate the power output of the device at
10 rpm in a 10 m/s wind given that the turbine is 80m in diameter and the density of air can be taken
as 1.15kg/m3.
Solution
This problem reduces to Ô¨Ånding the tip speed ratio Œª looking up the power coefÔ¨Åcient on
the graph and then calculating the power output. The tip speed ratio Œª gives:
Œª = œârtip
V

So look up the power coefÔ¨Åcient that corresponds to 10.47 on Figure 7.2 which is approximately
CP = 0.37. The area of the turbine is given by A = œÄr2
tip = œÄ √ó 402 = 5026 m2, the assumption is
that the area of the nacelle is negligible. Putting this all together:
CP =

CoefÔ¨Åcients for Hydraulic Machines
Hydraulic machines are those turbomachines that operate with liquid (most often water) as the work-
ing Ô¨Çuid. These are enormously signiÔ¨Åcant devices which produce up to 20% of the worlds electricity
in large and small hydroelectric plants. Pumps are vital to the infrastructure of water and fuel supply.
Dimensional analysis of hydraulic machines yields a different set of coefÔ¨Åcients, these are the
Ô¨Çow coefÔ¨Åcient:
Œ†1 =
Q
ND3
(7.5)
where N is the number of revolutions per second made by the machine and D is the machine
diameter. We give the coefÔ¨Åcients the symbol Œ†. The next dimensionless parameter is the head
coefÔ¨Åcient:
Œ†2 =
gH
N2D2
(7.6)
where H is the head produced or absorbed by the hydraulic machine and g is the acceleration due
to gravity. Finally the power coefÔ¨Åcient is given by:

The power of dimensional analysis can be seen in Figure 7.3 the left hand plot consists of pres-

the data is exactly the same but reduces the relationship at different speeds to a single line. This shows
how plotting parameters in terms of dimensionless quantities is a powerful method for reducing the
complexity and amount of information an engineer needs to understand.

Clearly efÔ¨Åciency is a non-dimensional parameter for hydraulic machines and again it varies
between pumps and turbines as follows:
Œ∑pump = Ideal Work
Actual Work, Œ∑turbine = Actual Work
Ideal Work
7.3.1
SpeciÔ¨Åc Speed for Turbines
Note that for a turbine:
Œ†3
Œ†1Œ†2
=
P
œÅQgH = Œ∑
For a pump the reciprocal applies. So if for a model turbine we obtain test data and plot the dimen-
sional parameters against each other the performance of larger machines of the same type can be
predicted. For a particular machine the operating conditions are expressed by values of N, P and H.
The rotational speed N is normally Ô¨Åxed by the frequency of electricity supply, P and H are set by
the Ô¨Çow rate and the height drop of the physical location that the hydro-electric scheme is proposed
for. It would therefore be useful to have a dimensional group which includes N, P and H but not
D so that it would be independent of the machine size. This can be obtained by manipulating the
dimensionless groups for a turbine to obtain a new dimensionless coefÔ¨Åcient:
Œ†4 = Œ†1/2
3
Œ†5/4
2
=
NP 1/2
œÅ1/2(gH)5/4
The point of machine design is to obtain maximum efÔ¨Åciency and there is generally only one set
of values of Œ†1 and Œ†2 and Œ†3 for which this occurs. For a given shape of machine we are therefore
interested in a unique value of Œ†4. We call this dimensionless speciÔ¨Åc speed:
Ks = Œ†1/2
3
Œ†5/4
2
=
NP 1/2
œÅ1/2(gH)5/4
(7.8)
Ks has a unique value for maximum efÔ¨Åciency for a given shape of machine. It is a shape
parameter independent of the size, D. By calculating the value of Ks from the design speciÔ¨Åcations,
we can determine the most efÔ¨Åcient machine type.
Normally hydraulic turbines use water and remain on the surface of the earth so œÅ and g are
dropped to give a dimensional speciÔ¨Åc speed:
NS = NP 1/2
H5/4
(7.9)
For N in rev/min, P in kW and H in m, NS = 1042Ks.
The term speciÔ¨Åc speed arises from the idea of a given type of machine producing unit power
(1kW) at unit head (1m), Ns is the speed it would run at in rev/min. It is much better to think of it as
a shape parameter.

For commercial machines there are size limitations the upper limit for N is determined by material
strength (centrifugal forces) and machines with a small power output P of a given type become less
efÔ¨Åcient - giving a range of applicability for different types of hydraulic machine.
7.3.2
SpeciÔ¨Åc Speed for Pumps
For a pump the requirement is more likely to be Ô¨Çow Q, rather than power so a different dimensionless
group is picked.
Œ†5 = Œ†1/3
1
Œ†1/2
2
= Q1/3N2/3
(gH)1/2
raise to the power 2/3 to get:
Ks‚Ä≤ = NQ1/2
(gH)3/4
(7.10)
which is the dimensionless speciÔ¨Åc speed for a pump, which again has a unique value for maxi-
mum efÔ¨Åciency. As for turbines there is also a dimensional speciÔ¨Åc speed:
NS = NQ1/2
H3/4
(7.11)
For N in rev/min, Q in m/s and H in m, Ns = 333Ks‚Ä≤
Note that the speciÔ¨Åc speed for pumps and turbines are related by a simple ratio - they are funda-
mentally the same concept just applied to different machines.
7.3.3
Using SpeciÔ¨Åc Speeds
Pump and turbine manufacturers will provide charts and diagrams that relate pump or turbine ge-
ometry to speciÔ¨Åc speed. These charts are based on the manufacturer‚Äôs experience with particular
machines as the choice of machine type depends on the maximum efÔ¨Åciency which can only be de-
termined by testing. Note that different companies or organisations have widely different choices for
the units they apply to their charts - be sure to use the same units as the person who made the chart! .
Figure 7.4 shows a plot of speciÔ¨Åc speed against head from a large number of hydroelectric
power plants produced by Alstom Power from 1965-2006. The units of speciÔ¨Åc speed are actually
kg1/2m7/5s‚àí5/2 or in other words not very meaningful so they are not recorded on the graph. The
graph shows clearly the expected trend of speciÔ¨Åc speed vs head. This can also be obtained from
Equation 7.11 where Ns ‚àùH‚àí1.25 or approximately 1/H in order. The point of the graph is to show
how the different turbine types are grouped together.2
From this illustration of industry practise one can draw up some guidelines for turbine type based
on speciÔ¨Åc speed, these broad guidelines are shown in Table 7.2.
2The outlier on the graph with a head of 10m and a speciÔ¨Åc speed of around 450 is actually a tidal stream turbine at La
Rance in France so operates with the Ô¨Çow going in either direction so the design is unusual.

Example
A turbine is to be designed for a site with 400m of head an an expected power of 1MW,
the turbine will feed electricity into a 50 Hz electrical grid. Using speciÔ¨Åc speed estimate which sort
of turbine design should be investigated further.
Solution
The strategy here is to calculate the speciÔ¨Åc speed. The head and power are given so we
need to Ô¨Ånd possible values or rotational speed. Electrical generators typically run at Ô¨Åxed multiples
of turbine speed the fastest being a two pole generator which runs at the frequency of the grid, there
is no limit to the number of pole pairs that can be used in the generator but up to ten pole pairs will
be examined.
With a single pole pair, the rotational speed will be N = 50 √ó 60 = 3000 rev/min:
NS = NP 1/2
H5/4
= 3000 √ó 10001/2
4005/4
= 53.03
Note that power is input in kW, rotational speed in rev/min and head in m. With ten pole pairs,
the machine rotational speed will be N = 300 rev/min and so:

Comparing the values of speciÔ¨Åc speed to Table 7.2 or Figure 7.4 it is evident that a Pelton Wheel
design is required. The exact choice of generator speed being determined by various design trade-offs
such as between generator cost (increasing with number of poles) and windage losses (reducing with
number of poles).

Problems
1. An axial Ô¨Çow gas turbine has three stages of compression and one stage for the turbine. The
compressor operates with an axial inlet Ô¨Çow velocity of 250 m/s at 3000 rpm. The rotor
relative exit angle is set at ‚àí34‚ó¶at a mean radius of 0.75 m. Draw the velocity triangle for the

Reaction for Repeating Stage
The aim of this section is to relate reaction to blade dimensions for a common special case: a repeating
stage with constant axial velocity. This shows how the static enthalpy drop (and therefore also the
static pressure drop) are controlled entirely by the blade geometry.
Consider the h-s diagram in Figure 8.1. First consider the enthalpy drop from the stage as a whole:

It is very useful to change Equation 8.1 into one that uses Œ±2 instead of Œ≤2 this form of the

Apply the key rule in the tangential direction so:

A turbine stage of a reaction 0.4 is to operate at a Ô¨Çow coefÔ¨Åcient of 1.0, if the stator exit
Ô¨Çow angle is 60‚ó¶. Estimate the rotor relative inlet and exit Ô¨Çow angles.
Solution
This example is quite easy but drives home the point that once the non-dimensional Ô¨Çow
parameters are set the geometry of the machine is Ô¨Åxed.
The Stator exit Ô¨Çow angle is known Œ±2 along with the reaction, R and the Ô¨Çow coefÔ¨Åcient œÜ

We now examine two special cases of zero reaction (also called impulse blading) and 50% re-
action to illustrate the fundamental trade-offs that are made when varying the level of reaction. In
practise machines will operate with varying levels of reaction but comparing two very different cases
gives information about the general trends.

8.1.1
Zero Reaction (Impulse) Stage
If R = 0, from Equation 8.2 it is apparent that tan Œ≤2 = ‚àítan Œ≤3 So the inlet and outlet of rotor have
equal and opposite and opposite angles. This leads to bucket shaped blades.
|W3| = |W2| and Œ≤3 = ‚àíŒ≤2
A sketch of an impulse blade is shown in Figure 8.2 on the left hand side. We saw earlier that for
a rotor row Equation 5.20 that energy conservation is equivalent to:
h0rel1 ‚àíU2
1
2 = h0rel2 ‚àíU2
2
2
Since there are no changes in blade speed between the inlet and the outlet of the rotor then
h0rel1 = h0rel2 which means that for the zero reaction case:
h0rel1 = h0rel2 =‚áíh1 + W 2
1
2
= h2 + W 2
2
2
=‚áíh1 = h2
so there is no static enthalpy change across the rotor in an impulse blade. Since:
R ‚âàŒîprotor
Œîpstage
there is no pressure change across rotor and all acceleration of the Ô¨Çow is across the stator, which
is why it is often called a nozzle. Note that:
‚Ä¢ Zero reaction has high turning in the rotor, typically Œ≤2 = 60‚ó¶= ‚àíŒ≤3 giving around 120‚ó¶of
Ô¨Çow turning in rotor.
‚Ä¢ All the stagnation enthalpy drop must be across rotor, since only the rotor is moving. There is
no work done in the stator.
Zero reaction is often called impulse blading as there is no pressure change in the rotor so the
mechanism of turning the rotor is down to kinetic energy changes. Where R > 0 there is a pressure
drop in the rotor passage so the mechanism of energy transfer is more complex. The Euler equation
however Equation 5.12 shows that the detailed mechanisms within the blade row do not determine
the work input and output from the stage - it is the change in angular momentum through the rotor
passage that matters.
8.1.2
50% Reaction Stage
It is useful to examine what happens when the reaction level is 50%.

tan Œ±2 ‚àítan Œ≤2 = tan Œ±3 ‚àítan Œ≤3
=‚áítan Œ≤2 = ‚àítan Œ±3 =‚áíŒ≤2 = ‚àíŒ±3
Now Œ±3‚àíŒ±1 as the stage is a repeating stage. This means that the rotor blades are mirror image of
the stator blades. 50% reaction gives equal acceleration through rotor and stator, and equal pressure
drop.
The two types of blade design are sketched in Figure 8.2, this illustrates that when presented with
a blade geometry from a simple examination of the inlet and exit angles the level of reaction chosen
for the particular blade can be estimated. Blades with high turning are generally impulse blades.

Loading and EfÔ¨Åciency Variation with Reaction
Changing the reaction (for constant Vx and a repeating stage) will change the blade geometry (Figure

turbine stage with constant axial velocity, repeating stages and an axial exit velocity. For impulse
blades R = 0 and we know from Equation 8.1 that the blades will be bucket shaped.
So W2Œ∏ = ‚àíW3Œ∏ and from the exit velocity triangle V3Œ∏ = 0 ‚áíU = ‚àíW3Œ∏
So at position 2:
V2Œ∏ = U + W2Œ∏ = U + U = 2U
Euler Equation:
w = U(V3Œ∏ ‚àíV2Œ∏) = U2U = 2U2
Œ® = wx
U2 = 2U2
U2 = 2
So Œ® = 2 for impulse blading, repeating stages, constant axial velocity and zero swirl at exit.
For a 50% Reaction design where R = 0.5 and we have Œ≤2 = Œ±3 = 0 and Œ≤3 = ‚àíŒ±2
Rotor/stator velocity triangles are a mirror image so from the velocity triangle at 2:
V2Œ∏ = U
From the velocity triangle at station 3:
V3Œ∏ = 0

Euler Equation:
w = U(V3Œ∏ ‚àíV2Œ∏) = UU = U2
Œ® = w
U2 = U2
U2 = 1
So Œ® = 1 for 50% reaction blading, repeating stages, constant axial velocity and zero swirl at
exit. So there is twice as much work for an Impulse Stage compared to a 50% Reaction Stage for the
same design constraints.
8.3
Stage EfÔ¨Åciency
Turbine efÔ¨Åciency is related to the energy loss or entropy gain within turbomachines. This is an
enormously complex topic and the best (although very advanced!) reference is Denton (1993). There
are three basic mechanisms for entropy creation inside a blade row:
1. Viscous friction in either boundary layers or free shear layers.
2. Heat transfer across a Ô¨Ånite temperature difference.
3. Non-equilibrium processes such as occur in shock waves.
The latter two are complex subjects and left aside in this book. The entropy rise in a boundary
layer can be taken to be proportional to a Reynolds number based on boundary layer thickness. In
particular for a turbulent boundary layer the dissipation coefÔ¨Åcient (a measure of the rate of entropy
generation in the boundary layer so smaller values are good).
CD = 0.0056Re‚àí1/6
b
(8.3)
where Reb = œÅV b
Œº
where œÅ, Œº are Ô¨Çuid properties and V is the free-stream velocity and b is the
boundary layer thickness. The origin of equation 8.3 is a subject for advanced Ô¨Çuid mechanics but
the implications can be discussed here. For a given boundary layer thickness b a high free-stream
velocity will result in a greater value of Reb and therefore a greater value CD, more entropy and
therefore lower efÔ¨Åciency.
Simplifying Ô¨Çuid dynamics slightly we might therefore expect the stage efÔ¨Åciency to be somewhat
dependent on the velocity in the machine - the higher the velocity the lower the machine efÔ¨Åciency.
Consider the velocity value at stator exit V2.
‚Ä¢ 0% Reaction, Impulse, V2 =

V 2
x + V 2
Œ∏ =

V 2
x + (2U)2
‚Ä¢ 50% Reaction V2 =

V 2
x + V 2
Œ∏ =

V 2
x + U2
So for a comparable blade the higher velocity for impulse blading gives more frictional loss and
lowers peak efÔ¨Åciency. The choice of reaction therefore is fundamentally a trade-off between high
loading and high efÔ¨Åciency.

Figure 8.3: Locations for Tip Clearance Flow
8.4
Choice of Reaction for Turbines
In any situation with a rotating blade and a stationary casing there has to be a small ‚Äútip clearance‚Äù
between the end of the blade and the casing in which the machine rotates. Since the tip of the blade
has a pressure difference over it there is leakage Ô¨Çow over the top of the blade, the Ô¨Çow here is highly
complex. In a turbine the Ô¨Çow over the tip of the blades does no work so tip leakage Ô¨Çow is usually
detrimental and should be minimised as far as possible. 1 Tip leakage losses occur at the gap between
the stator tip and rotating hub and at the gap between the rotor tip and casing clearance as shown in
Figure 8.3.
Leakage Ô¨Çow driven by the Œîp across each row which is linked to reaction as from equation 6.3.:
R = ŒîhROTOR
ŒîhSTAGE
‚âàŒîpROTOR
ŒîpSTAGE
For 50% reaction, there is a pressure drop across both the stator and the rotor. So we get some
leakage for each row, but the sealing is relatively straightforward as the pressure drops are quite
modest. So we can make do with a simple ‚Äúdrum‚Äù construction. (Top half of Figure 8.4)
For 0% reaction (impulse) all the pressure drop is across stator so the leakage Ô¨Çows would be
much larger. A ‚ÄúDisc and Diaphragm‚Äù construction is often used. This enables the leakage path to
be lowered to a small radius so although Œîp is quite large the area for Ô¨Çow is reduced, reducing the
leakage. However it requires a more complex construction. (Lower half of Figure 8.4)
Gas conditions might also inÔ¨Çuence the choice of reaction. At turbine inlet, the Ô¨Çuid temperature
and pressure are very high, high work per stage reduces this temperature and pressure quickly. There
are a number of reasons this might be beneÔ¨Åcial. High work per stage may enable the designer to
avoid the expense of having an extra stage in the machine reducing the build cost. The materials
1For a compressor one generally wants to minimise tip leakage but the situation is much more complex and sometimes
a small amount of tip leakage can help the overall stability of the machine.

required to operate at high temperatures for both steam and gas turbines are incredibly expensive so
reducing the machine temperature rapidly may again reduce the manufacturing costs. Finally most
high performance gas turbines have very complex blade cooling arrangements as the temperature of
the Ô¨Çuid going around the turbine blades is much higher than the melting point of the material they
are made off - requiring only one stage of this blading has clear advantages in terms of reduced design
effort and manufacturing cost.
8.5
Compressor Design
Compressors operate in an adverse pressure gradient, that is the exit pressure is much higher than the
inlet pressure. There is a limit to how much pressure rise you can obtain in a single stage without
boundary layer separation. Boundary layer separation means that the pressure rise through the ma-
chine is removed and if this happens suddenly you have the temporary situation where there is a high
pressure in the combustion chamber and no pressure rise through the compressor to prevent the Ô¨Çow
of air from high pressure to low pressure. This leads occasionally to Ô¨Çames coming out the front of
aircraft engines! Though modern design much reduced the incidence of these events.
So for a turbine excursions from design values of œÜ or Œ® are likely to reduce efÔ¨Åciency, for a
compressor they are likely to compromise the operation of the whole machine. This means that
the design imperatives for compressors are about ensuring consistent performance, i.e. avoiding
phenomenon such as stall and surge rather than achieving maximum efÔ¨Åciency. For compressors the
values of stage loading and Ô¨Çow coefÔ¨Åcient are therefore more modest than for a turbine and the level
of reaction tends to be around 50% to ensure that the adverse pressure gradient is shared between the
rotor and the stator as far as possible.

Multistage Steam Turbine Example
Here many of the techniques developed for axial Ô¨Çow machines are illustrated using an axial Ô¨Çow
steam turbine design example, though the same technique could be employed for gas turbines or
compressors.
Example
A steam turbine is to be supplied with superheated steam at conditions of 10 bar and
400‚ó¶C the exhaust pressure is set to 4kN/m2.
The turbine isentropic efÔ¨Åciency is expected to
be around 88% based on past experience with machines of this type. The machine will rotate at
3000 rpm, a speed set by the electrical grid frequency. The mean radius of the machine will be
0.75 m.
Repeating stages, with constant axial velocity and axial leaving velocity are to be used. Estimate
the number of stages and make a choice of blading with a stator exit angle of 75‚ó¶.
Solution
This is a design type problem - so there is no one right or wrong answer. The Ô¨Årst thing
to be clear about is the difference between the changes in steam conditions over a stage and over the
machine. The inlet conditions for the machine are Ô¨Åxed by the delivery pressure and temperature of
the inlet steam. The exit pressure at the machine exit is Ô¨Åxed by the condenser pressure. The pressure
drop of the machine what the blading we choose has to deliver. A good Ô¨Årst step is to examine the
machine performance.
To make clearer the distinction between machine conditions and stage the entry and exit condi-
tions for the machine are given the labels a and b respectively. The steam conditions at inlet and exit

are determined by reference to Steam Tables or charts (For example Rogers and Mayhew (1994). At
inlet the steam conditions are:
ha : 10 bar, 400‚ó¶C = 3266 kJ/kg
if we then sketch a line of constant entropy on the Mollier chart from point a to the 0.04 bar line or
interpolate using tables we can determine hbs:
hbs = 2253 kJ/kg
The change in enthalpy across the machine is therefore:
Œîh = ha ‚àíhbs = 3266 ‚àí2253 = 1013 kJ/kg
Now:
Œ∑ = Œîhactual
Œîhideal
=‚áíŒîhactual = Œ∑Œîhideal = 0.88 √ó 1013 = 891 kJ/kg
This is the enthalpy drop across the machine. The mean blade speed is given by:
Um = œârm = 3000 √ó 2œÄ
60 √ó 0.75 = 236 m/s
Firstly consider a design based on impulse or zero reaction design. Earlier we saw how the stage
loading coefÔ¨Åcient for impulse blades with repeating stages, axial velocity and zero swirl at exit was
œà = 2
œà = w
U2m
=‚áíw = œàU 2
m = 2 √ó 2362 = 111 kJ/kg
this is the work output from each stage of the machine. The number of stages is given by the machine
enthalpy drop divided by the stage enthalpy drop or:
Nstages = 891
111 = 8.03
This would be taken as eight stages for impulse blading.
The velocity triangles for both impulse and reaction blades are shown in Figure 8.2 on page 94.
For a stage we have inlet designated by station 1, stator exit by station 2 and rotor exit by station 3 in
contrast to the a, b labelling for the machine.
From the velocity triangle for an impulse stage:
V2Œ∏ = 2Um = 472 m/s and V2x =
V2Œ∏
tan Œ±2

tan 75 = 126 m/s
Again from the velocity triangle:

= 61.9‚ó¶
Since the blades are ‚Äúbucket‚Äù shaped Œ≤3 = ‚àíŒ≤2 = ‚àí61.9‚ó¶. The deÔ¨Çection or turning across the rotor
is therefore: 2 √ó 61.9‚ó¶= 124‚ó¶. The key point is that once the level of reaction has been speciÔ¨Åed this
determines the blade geometry!
Secondly consider a design based on reaction blading where R = 0.5. The stage loading coefÔ¨Å-
cient for reaction blades with repeating stages, axial velocity and zero swirl at exit was œà = 1
œà = w
U2m
=‚áíw = œàU 2

this is the work output from each stage of the machine. The number of stages is given by the machine
enthalpy drop divided by the stage enthalpy drop or:
Nstages = 891
55.5 = 16.05
This would be taken as sixteen stages for reaction blading.
The determination of blade geometry for reaction blades is straightforward, a cascade view and
velocity triangle are shown in Figure 8.2. We know that the rotor blades are the mirror image of
the stator blades. Therefore Œ≤2 = ‚àíŒ±3 = 0 as there is no exit swirl. Stator and rotor blades are a
mirror image: Œ≤3 = ‚àíŒ±2 = ‚àí75‚ó¶. The deÔ¨Çection across the rotor is therefore 75‚ó¶. Compared to
the impulse blading the 50% reaction blading gives lower turning and therefore lower work output,
necessitating more stages for the same power output. The advantage of reaction blading is a slightly
higher efÔ¨Åciency.
In practise the design is not limited to a single choice of reaction, so one might end up with four
impulse stages in a high pressure turbine and eight stages of 50% reaction in a low pressure turbine.
Example
In the previous example the turbine is designed to produce 100 MW of power. At inlet
the steam density is around 3.26 kg/m3 (this can be checked with steam tables). Estimate the local
blade height h.
Solution
The Ô¨Årst step is to Ô¨Ånd the mass Ô¨Çow.

The axial velocity Vx = 126 m/s and the steam density œÅ = 3.26 kg/m3 so:
h =
112.2
3.26 √ó 126 √ó 2œÄ √ó 0.75 = 0.058 m
The rationale behind these examples is to show that even with a relatively small amount of theory
one can obtained powerful insights into the reasons behind the design choices made by turbomachin-
ery designers.

Problems
1. A steam power plant has a High Pressure (HP) turbine, an Intermediate Pressure (IP) turbine
and a Low Pressure (LP) turbine. All stages of the HP, IP and LP turbines are designed for an
axial leaving velocity and a rotational speed of 3000 RPM. The axial velocity is kept a constant
through each turbine.
‚Ä¢ HP turbine: stagnation pressure drop from 15MN/m2 to 3MN/m2; isentropic turbine
(not stage) efÔ¨Åciency (total-to-total) of 0.88; impulse blading; stator exit Ô¨Çow angle of
75‚ó¶; blade mean radius of 0.51m.
‚Ä¢ IP turbine: stagnation pressure drop from 3MN/m2 to 0.3MN/m2; turbine isentropic
efÔ¨Åciency of 0.88; 50% reaction blading; stator exit Ô¨Çow angle of 70‚ó¶; blade mean radius
of 0.74m.

efÔ¨Åciency of 0.84; 50% reaction blading; stator exit Ô¨Çow angle of 70‚ó¶; blade mean radius
of 1.09m.
Superheated steam enters the HP turbine axially at a stagnation temperature of 550‚ó¶C. The
steam is reheated to 550‚ó¶C between the exit from the HP turbine and the inlet to the IP turbine.
(a) Use the steam tables or chart to Ô¨Ånd relevant energy changes and estimate the number of
stages required in the HP, IP and LP turbines (the kinetic energy leaving the LP turbine
may be neglected).
(b) Calculate the axial velocity for the HP, IP and LP turbines
(c) Estimate the relative Ô¨Çow angles at exit from the rotor blades for each turbine
Answers: 1) 8 stages, 11 stages, 5 stages, 2) 86 m/s, 85 m/s, 125 m/s, 3) ‚àí61.8‚ó¶,‚àí70‚ó¶,‚àí70‚ó¶
2. The repeating stage of an axial Ô¨Çow steam turbine is designed with the following Ô¨Çow angles:
Exit Ô¨Çow from stator, Œ±2 = 75‚ó¶; relative Ô¨Çow at inlet to rotor, Œ≤2 = 45‚ó¶; relative Ô¨Çow at outlet
from rotor, Œ≤3 = ‚àí68‚ó¶. Sketch the velocity triangles at the stator exit-rotor inlet and at the
rotor outlet.
3. For the machine in the previous question Show that the values of Ô¨Çow coefÔ¨Åcient and stage
loading coefÔ¨Åcient for the stage are œÜ = 0.366, œà = 1.272.

Hydraulic Turbines
Hydro-electric power accounts for up to 20% of the world‚Äôs electrical generation. Hydraulic turbines
come in a variety of shapes determined by the available head and a number of sizes determined by the
Ô¨Çow rate through the device. This chapter introduces no new concepts but instead allows the analysis
techniques learnt over the preceding chapters to be applied by means of analysis examples.
Three three basic hydraulic machines (Pelton, Francis and Kaplan) are discussed and with all
hydraulic machines the simpliÔ¨Åcation for analysis and operation is that the Ô¨Çuid density is constant
but the complication is that cavitation may occur in the machine. Cavitation is effectively the boiling
of the liquid as it is exposed to extremely low pressures in certain parts of the turbine.

Figure 9.1: Pelton‚Äôs Patent Application and Analysis Model
9.1
Pelton Wheel
This device invented around 1880 by Lester Pelton is used in high head locations with 300m to 4000m
head, it has a peak efÔ¨Åciency of around 90%.
Figure 9.1 shows the Pelton wheel on the left and the sketch on the right shows a diagram of
operation with velocity triangles.
The analysis of this machine is straightforward and can be found in any basic Ô¨Çuid mechanics
textbook (e.g. Massey (1989)) as a simple control volume can be drawn around the rotor blade and
the force determined from a simple analysis. Alternatively the results can be obtained from the Euler
equation as follows.
Recall that P = Àômœâ(V2Œ∏r2 ‚àíV1Œ∏r1) so the key parameters to work out are the inlet tangential
velocity and the exit tangential velocity.
At inlet the situation is straightforward V1Œ∏ = Vj the jet velocity, as the nozzle directs the Ô¨Çow
only in the tangential direction. At exit the velocity triangle shown in Figure 4.11 must be used.
Note that : W1 = Vj ‚àíU so W2 = kW1 = k(Vj ‚àíU) where k is an empirical coefÔ¨Åcient for
frictional losses in the bucket. From the velocity triangle:
V2Œ∏ = U + W2Œ∏
and that W2Œ∏ = ‚àíW2 cos Œò, where Œò is the bucket angle shown in Figure 9.1. angle made by
the bucket. The negative sign arises as our sign convention is ‚Äúpositive in the direction of rotation‚Äù.
Substituting yields:
V2Œ∏ = U ‚àíW2 cos Œò = U ‚àík(Vj ‚àíU) cos Œò = ‚àíkvj cos Œò + U(1 + k cos Œò)

Substitute this into the expression for power:
P = ÀômU(Vj ‚àíU)(1 + k cos Œò)
In the Pelton wheel all the pressure drop occurs in the stator or nozzle so the machine can be
classiÔ¨Åed as an impulse machine.
9.2
Analysis Approach
The analysis of the Pelton wheel is extremely straightforward, other hydraulic machines required a
more nuanced approach. This is a three step process:
1. Given the Ô¨Çow rate apply the continuity equation to get the radial or axial velocity.
2. The geometry (blade angles and radii) will yield absolute and relative velocities by means of
velocity triangles.
3. Power is obtained from the Euler Equation.
Empirically obtained values of efÔ¨Åciency (or estimated values based on prior experience) link
the power produced and the head drop across the machine. There are two methods of doing this
depending of what information is available.
1. If the total head is given this yields the ideal power:
Pideal = œÅ ÀôQgH = ÀômgH
Given the ideal power, we have the actual power (from the Euler equation above) this yields
the efÔ¨Åciency.
2. If loss information is given, the actual head is obtained from:
Hactual = Pactual
œÅ ÀôQg
+ Hloss
The ideal head is given by Hactual ‚àíHloss so given the actual power and the losses efÔ¨Åciency
can be obtained.
This may seem slightly abstract at the moment but will become more concrete as the examples are
explained. Firstly a Francis turbine analysis is conducted where the overall head is given and the draft
tube and supply pipe losses must be estimated, secondly an analysis on a Kaplan turbine is presented
where losses are calculated for each component.
9.3
Francis Turbine
The Francis turbine was brieÔ¨Çy described in Chapter 4. But for this analysis of the machine each
station through the device is considered in more detail, a diagrammatic representation of the turbine
is shown in Figure 9.2 with each of the analysis stations labelled. The four stations are:

Figure 9.2: Analysis of a Francis Turbine
1. Inlet to Guide Vanes. (Station 1) There may be a small amount of swirl at inlet to the guide
vanes because of the use of a volute to distribute the Ô¨Çow
2. Exit from Guide Vanes. (Station 2) Flow is deÔ¨Çected by the guide vanes (stator) to give high
swirl velocity, and thus high angular momentum. Draw the velocity triangle to get the relative
Ô¨Çow at inlet to the runner blades.
3. Exit from Runner. (Station 3) The aim here is to design at exit for zero absolute swirl as
otherwise kinetic energy is wasted. Again we must draw the velocity triangle to get relative
Ô¨Çow at exit from runner.
4. Draft Tube. (Station 4) This diffuser allows recovery of some of the exit kinetic energy of the
axial Ô¨Çow.
Unlike the Pelton wheel all the pressure change does not occur over the stator so the Francis
turbine can be thought of as a reaction machine. Flow from station to 1 station 2 through guide vanes
is radially inwards, while being deÔ¨Çected and gaining angular momentum.
First we apply continuity: Flow rate Q1 = Q2:
Q2 = V2r2œÄr2b2 and Q1 = V1r2œÄr1b1
If b1 = b2, (constant width vanes), then V2rr2 = V1rr1. Now the guide vanes have a non-zero
thickness, and this introduces a blockage t at station 2 so to allow for this:
Q2 = 2œÄr2b2(1 ‚àít)V2r
Typical t = 0.08 or about 8% of the area is blocked by the inlet guide vanes. The detailed analysis
process is as follows:

‚Ä¢ From the value of V2r, the Ô¨Çow angle at exit from the vanes, Œ±2 and the blade speed, œâR2,
construct the velocity triangle at vane exit, 2
‚Ä¢ Usually the design is for no exit swirl to reduce the exit kinetic energy that is lost, i.e. V3Œ∏ = 0.
Thus from the blade speed œâR3, the velocity triangle at runner exit, 3 can be constructed.
‚Ä¢ The runner inlet and exit relative Ô¨Çow angles (to give the geometry of the runner blades) are
obtained and also the power from the change in angular momentum across the runner (Euler
equation).
‚Ä¢ Finally to get the efÔ¨Åciency, the height of the reservoir and information on losses is required.
Example
Consider a machine with the following speciÔ¨Åcation:
‚Ä¢ Outer diameter of runner, 2r2 = 2.0 m
‚Ä¢ Rotational speed, N = 200 rev/min
‚Ä¢ Guide vane height, b2 = 0.3 m
‚Ä¢ Vane blockage, t = 0.08
‚Ä¢ Vane exit angle, Œ±2 = 75‚ó¶from the radial direction
‚Ä¢ Impeller designed for axial Ô¨Çow at exit, Œ±3 = 0, and r3m = 0.5 m; b3 = 0.4 m
‚Ä¢ Supply head, HO = 63 m; Flow rate Q = 12 m3/s
‚Ä¢ Flow losses: 2 m of heat loss in the supply pipe, 0.5 m of head loss in the draft tube
‚Ä¢ Draft tube velocity of 4 m/s
Determine the relative angles at inlet and exit of runner to give a preliminary design for the runner
geometry. Also Ô¨Ånd the power output.
Solution
The strategy is to apply the analysis steps outlined earlier. The most difÔ¨Åcult part is
drawing the velocity triangles at station 2 and station 3.
Continuity at 2
At exit from guide vanes:
Q = 2œÄr2b2(1 ‚àít)V2r =‚áí12 = 2œÄ √ó 1.0 √ó 0.3(1 ‚àí0.08)Vr2
Working the numbers though yields: V2r = 6.92 m/s

Velocity Triangle at 2:
Figure 9.3 shows the velocity triangle at 2 and the corresponding cascade
view. Earlier velocity triangles were drawn for pumps in a very similar manner. Since the geometry
of the blades is very complex only the Ô¨Årst part of the blade is drawn. To determine power the Euler
equation only requires values at inlet and exit of the turbine so a sketch at inlet and exit will sufÔ¨Åce. In
reality the turbine blade curves around into the axial direction which can be represented using CAD
for example but is not easy in a sketch. The velocity triangle is in the tangential radial plane.

‚áíW2Œ∏ = V2Œ∏ ‚àíœâr2 = 25.83 ‚àí20.94 = 4.89 m/s

In Chapter 4 the velocity of a jet expanding to atmospheric pressure was shown to be ‚àö2gH for
this turbine the ratio, V2/‚àö2gH = 0.76 so not all the acceleration of the Ô¨Çuid occurs over the stator
so the reaction R > 0 and the machine is not an impulse turbine.
Continuity at 3:
The Ô¨Çow area is given by 2œÄr3mb3 so:
Q = 2œÄr3mb3V3x
Rearrange and put the numbers in to give V3x:

Figure 9.4: Velocity Triangle for Francis Runner Exit
Draft Tube Analysis
Although external to the rotating parts of the turbine the draft tube is an
important part of the hydraulic machine. The draft tube is a conical diffuser with around 7‚ó¶divergence
which reduces the exit kinetic energy in the departing Ô¨Çuid and therefore increases the efÔ¨Åciency of
the machine as a whole.
In this example the aim is to reduce exit kinetic energy at station 4, note that h4 is normally below
the height of the river that the Ô¨Çow exits into.
As seen in Chapter 4 the total head at station 0 (the reservoir) is:
po
œÅg + V 2
o
2g + zo
But po = 0 as in hydraulics we always use gauge pressure where zero is the ambient atmospheric
pressure, in the reservoir V0 = 0 so the total head at station zero is simply given by H0 = z0
We need to Ô¨Ånd the head across turbine:
ŒîH = H1 ‚àíH3
Now H1 = Ho ‚àíhfp, where hfp is the pipe head loss due to friction. Now examine the total head
from the other end of the machine starting at station 4. If loss in draft tube is given by hfDT then:
H4 = H3 ‚àíhfDT =‚áíH3 = H4 + hfDT
The total head at station 4 is given by:
H4 = p4
œÅg + V 2
4
2g + z4
Hydraulic Turbines

Basic Concepts in Turbomachinery
 
116 
The pressure at station 4 must be equal to the pressure of the Ô¨Çuid in the river as a whole so is
given by the pressure due to a height of Ô¨Çuid: p4 = œÅgh4. Also z4 = ‚àíh4 substituting gives:
H4 = œÅgh4
œÅg
+ V 2
4
2g ‚àíh4 = V 2
4
2g
Thus
H3 = hfDT + V 2
4
2g
So head across turbine:
H1 ‚àíH3 = Ho ‚àíhfp ‚àí

hfDT + V 2
4
2g

simplifying slightly:
H1 ‚àíH3 = Ho ‚àíV 2
4
2g ‚àíhfp ‚àíhfDT
(9.1)
So for maximum head change across turbine and therefore the maximum power the design aim is
to keep V4, hfp and hfDT as low as possible.
To apply this information on pipe Ô¨Çow losses and draft tube losses is required and the velocity at
station 4. In this example the information is provided: hfp = 2 m, hfDT = 0.5 m, V4 = 4 m/s.
hfp can be calculated from a simple knowledge of pipe Ô¨Çow friction (Massey (1989)). Draft tube
losses require some empirical knowledge and V4 is set by conservation of mass. In this example
V3 = V3x = 9.55 m/s, so the exit velocity is considerably reduced by the draft tube.
Apply Equation 9.1 with the above numbers:
H1 ‚àíH3 = 63 ‚àí42
2g ‚àí2 ‚àí0.5 = 59.68 m
The turbine efÔ¨Åciency may then be worked out:
Œ∑T = Pactual
Pideal
=
6.49 √ó 106
1000 √ó 12 √ó 59.68 √ó 9.81 = 0.92
9.4
Kaplan Turbine
The Kaplan turbine is shown in diagrammatic form in Figure 9.5 which also shows the analysis
stations. In comparison to the analysis of the Francis turbine an extra analysis station is needed
(station 3) between the guide vane exit and the runner inlet as the Ô¨Çow is turned through 90‚ó¶before
entering the turbine blades. The analysis approach is as follows:
1. From station 2, the guide vane exit, to station 3, the runner inlet one can either use conservation
of angular momentum if guide vanes are radial. In some Kaplan turbines the guide vanes are
orientated in the axial direction in which case station 2 = station 3. The velocity triangles are
then drawn to get relative velocities at rotor inlet.

2. At 4, runner exit, draw the velocity triangle to obtain relative and absolute exit velocities.
3. The Euler equation 5.12 gives the power P = Àômœâ (r3V3Œ∏3 ‚àír4V4Œ∏)
4. Calculate losses. In this example component losses will be considered. Component head losses
will be obtained by working through the stations from 0 to 4. This gives the turbine efÔ¨Åciency.
5. Finally the draft tube, station 4 to station 5 is analysed, this calculation will give us the overall
efÔ¨Åciency of the site.
Example
Consider a Kaplan Turbine with the following characteristics:
‚Ä¢ Guide Vane Exit: Radial Ô¨Çow, r2 = 2.0 m; blade height, b2 = 1.0 m, blockage, t2 = 0.08;
absolute Ô¨Çow angle to radial, Œ±2 = 50‚ó¶
‚Ä¢ Runner: Mean radii at station 3 and 4 are the same: r3m = r4m = 0.85 m, blade height, b3 =
0.7 m; designed for zero exit absolute swirl, V4Œ∏ = 0; rotational speed, N = 300 rev/min.
‚Ä¢ Draft Tube: Reduces axial velocity to V5 = 5 m/s
‚Ä¢ Flow rate: Q = 36 m3/s
Calculate the runner relative and absolute Ô¨Çow angles and velocities at inlet and exit. Also calcu-
late the power output.
Solution
The strategy is to apply the analysis steps outlined earlier. In a Kaplan turbine the Ô¨Çow
through the guide vanes may be be radial or axial so the geometry must be carefully inspected.

Loss Estimation
One way losses may be calculated is to assume that across any component the total head loss is
proportional to the velocity head at exit:
ŒîH = k
V 2
2g

exit
This is a concept borrowed from minor losses in pipe Ô¨Çow calculations, this is still an empirical
method as one has to specify an appropriate value of k for each component. For runners the relative
dynamic head W 2/2g is used as the and the cause of most Ô¨Çuid friction is the the relative motion
between the runner surfaces and the mainstream Ô¨Çow.
Example
With the Kaplan turbine from the previous example the loss coefÔ¨Åcients may be taken as
k = 0.05 for the guide vanes and bend and k = 0.06 for the runner. Ignoring pipe friction estimate
the turbine efÔ¨Åciency.

Solution
Each station is considered in turn and an appropriate value of k speciÔ¨Åed.
‚Ä¢ 0 ‚áí1, for this example ignore the pipe loss. Though it is relatively easy to calculate.
‚Ä¢ 1 ‚áí2, for the guide vanes, k = 0.05: ŒîH = 0.05(V 2
2 )/2g = 0.05(4.842)/2g = 0.06 m
‚Ä¢ 2 ‚áí3, k = 0.05 for the bend from radial to axial Ô¨Çow: ŒîH = 0.05(V 2
3 )/2g = 0.05(13.02)/2g =
0.43 m
‚Ä¢ 3 ‚áí4, for the runner use the relative exit head. With k = 0.06: ŒîH = 0.06(W 2
4 )/2g =
0.06(28.382)/2g = 2.46 m
From station 1 to station 4, across the whole turbine, the ideal total head drop for the actual power
is given by:
ÀômgŒîHideal = Pactual =‚áíŒîHideal =
Pactual
ÀômgŒîHideal
this means that:
ŒîHideal =
8391 √ó 103
36 √ó 1000 √ó 9.81 = 23.76 m
which is the total head required if there were no losses in the turbine. The actual total head drop
across the turbine,
H1 ‚àíH4 = ŒîHideal +

ŒîHlosses
Each of the losses have already been calculated so substituting:
H1 ‚àíH4 = 23.76 + (0.06 + 0.43 + 2.46) = 26.71 m
This is the required total head drop across the turbine alone to produce the desired Ô¨Çow rate. The
turbine efÔ¨Åciency is:
Œ∑T = Actual Power
Àômg (H1 ‚àíH4) =
8391 √ó 103
36 √ó 1000 √ó 9.81 √ó 26.71 = 0.89
This is the efÔ¨Åciency for the turbine alone.
9.4.2
Draft Tube Analysis
Normally in hydraulic machines two efÔ¨Åciencies may be quoted. The Ô¨Årst known as ‚Äúturbine efÔ¨Å-
ciency‚Äù excludes draft tube and inlet pipe losses from the deÔ¨Ånition of available head and gives an
indication as to the ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù of the turbine runner. The second known as ‚Äúsystem efÔ¨Åciency‚Äù in-
cludes the losses in inlet pipes and draft tube and is of crucial interest to those designing or operating
particular hydro-electric power plants.
Example
Using the Kaplan turbine in the previous example. Estimate the system efÔ¨Åciency if the
draft tube loss coefÔ¨Åcient is given by k = 0.2.

Solution
From station 4 to 5 the draft tube reduces the axial velocity and hence the wasted exit
kinetic energy. The total head at 5 is given by:
H5 = p5
œÅg + V 2
5
2g + z5
But z5 = ‚àíh5 and so p5 = œÅgh5 as the pressure at station 5 must be equal to the pressure in the
river so:
H5 = p5
œÅg + V 2
5
2g + z5 = V 2
5
2g =
52
2 √ó 9.81 = 1.27 m
Now ŒîH4‚àí5 = H4 ‚àíH5, so H4 = H5 + ŒîH4‚àí5 and k = 0.2 so the draft tube loss becomes:
ŒîH4‚àí5 = k

= 0.69 m
This gives H4 = 1.27 + 0.69 = 1.96 m so the inlet head to the turbine H1 = (H1 ‚àíH4) + H4 =
26.71 + 1.96 = 28.67 m
This is the inlet total head required for the turbine to deliver the actual power. So the overall
overall efÔ¨Åciency for the system is given by:
Œ∑S = Actual Power

9.4.3
Effect of Draft Tube
To make clearer the inÔ¨Çuence of the draft tube, a calculation is carried out to illustrate what would
happen if it was replaced with a parallel pipe, V5 = V4 = 9.63 m/s and assuming that there is no
head loss associated with the parallel pipe. Consider what happens to the head and efÔ¨Åciency when
there is a parallel pipe.
H4 = H5 = V 2
5
2g =
9.632
2 √ó 9.81 = 4.73m
This makes the inlet head to the turbine H1 = (H1 ‚àíH4) + H4 = 26.71 + 4.73 = 31.44 m. For
the same power output the inlet head would need to be raised from from 28.67 m to 31.43 m. The
changed overall efÔ¨Åciency for the turbine is given by:
Œ∑S = Actual Power
ÀômgH
=
8391 √ó 103
36 √ó 1000 √ó 9.81 √ó 31.44 = 0.76
So there is a substantial reduction in efÔ¨Åciency, the difference in cost between a parallel pipe and
a diffuser is negligible so a draft tube is well worth having!
There is a drawback to having a draft tube, consider the turbine exit pressure for both the parallel
pipe and the draft tube. The total head at station 4 is given by:
H4 = p4
œÅg + V 2
4
2g + z4 = h4 + V 2
4
2g + z4
Where h4 is the static head at station 4:
h4 = H4 ‚àíV 2
4
2g ‚àíz4
For the sake of example say that the turbine exit is 1 m above the tail race, that is z4 = 1.0 m
With the draft tube installed. H4 = 1.96 m and V4 = 9.63 m/s so the static pressure head at station
4 is:
h4 = 1.96 ‚àí
9.632
2 √ó 9.81 ‚àí1.0 = ‚àí3.77 m
The negative sign indicates that the pressure is below atmospheric pressure. Expressing this
pressure in Pa rather than m of Ô¨Çuid yields:
p4 = h4œÅg = ‚àí3.77 √ó 1000 √ó 9.81 = ‚àí36.9kPa ‚âà‚àí0.4 bar
Without the draft tube so with a cylindrical pipe at exit. H4 = 4.72 m and V4 = 9.63 m/s so the
static pressure head at station 4 is:
h4 = 4.72 ‚àí
9.632
2 √ó 9.81 ‚àí1.0 = ‚àí1.00 m
Hydraulic Turbines

Basic Concepts in Turbomachinery
 
124 
Again this is below atmospheric pressure, converting to pressure rather than head gives:
p4 = h4œÅg = ‚àí1.00 √ó 1000 √ó 9.81 = ‚àí9.8kPa ‚âà‚àí0.1 bar
which is considerably greater.
The problem with excessively low pressures is that they can lead to a phenomenon known as
cavitation. Cavitation occurs if the absolute pressure falls below the saturated vapour pressure, pv,
for the water temperature. Or in other words when the pressure drops too low the water starts to boil
even at the ambient temperature encountered by hydraulic machines. Essentially bubbles of vapour
will be formed. As the pressure rises again the bubbles collapse suddenly and very high instantaneous
pressures can be created (p > 500bar) which can cause signiÔ¨Åcant erosion of blade surfaces and lower
machine performance.
In practise dissolved air starts to come out of solution of the Ô¨Çuid Ô¨Årst and so some margin between
the saturated vapour pressure and the pressure the turbine operates at is required. This is normally
done by using an empirical parameter known as Thoma‚Äôs parameter:
œÉ = p ‚àípv
ŒîH
(9.2)
where p is the pressure of the Ô¨Çuid, pv is the saturated vapour pressure and ŒîH is the head drop
across the machine. Charts of Thoma‚Äôs parameter derived from practical experience are available.
The problem of cavitation can be alleviated somewhat by reducing z4, that is lowering the turbine
closer to the river level or even below it.

Problems
1. A Francis turbine operates with the following data: Head: 100m; Flow rate 36 m3/s; Speed:
410 rev/min; Outer radius of runner 0.6 m; Absolute Ô¨Çow angle: 72‚ó¶; Velocity: 36 m/s; Exit
swirl angle: 0‚ó¶
Calculate the effective runner width (i.e. ignoring blockage) and relative Ô¨Çow angle at inlet, the
power output and efÔ¨Åciency. Answers: 0.859 m, 37.3‚ó¶, 31.8 MW,90.0%
2. A water turbine develops 480 kW with a head of 12.2 m with an overall efÔ¨Åciency of 86%
when Ô¨Åtted with a cylindrical draft tube of 1.5m diameter. If a conical draft tube of 2.25m exit
diameter is substituted, calculate the increase in efÔ¨Åciency and power. Assume the Ô¨Çow rate,
head, speed and losses in the machine are unaltered, and that there is no exit swirl. Answers:
88.3%, 493 kW
3. A vertical axis Kaplan Turbine is to be designed for an overall head of 9 m, delivering 800 kW
at a rotational speed of 150 rev/min. The vanes and runner are to be mounted in an annular
duct of outer diameter 2 m and inner diameter 0.8 m. There is to be no exit swirl, and a draft
tube reduces the axial velocity by a factor of two. Making a reasonable assumption for the
overall efÔ¨Åciency, estimate the required Ô¨Çow rate and hence the Ô¨Çow angle at exit from the
vanes and the relative Ô¨Çow angles at inlet and exit for the runner. The losses of total head are
estimated as:
(a) across the guide vanes, 6% of exit velocity head

10.0.1
Pump Geometry and Performance
A general arrangement diagram of a pump is in Figure 4.1 on page 44. If station 1 is inlet to rotor and
station 2 the outlet of the rotor, then the Euler equation gives:
P = Àômœâ(r2V2Œ∏ ‚àír1V1Œ∏)
Consider the efÔ¨Åciency of a pump:
Œ∑p = IdealPower
ActualPower =
ÀômgH
Àômœâ(r2V2Œ∏ ‚àír1V1Œ∏)
This means that the Head H developed over the turbine is:
H = Œ∑p
g œâ(r2V2Œ∏ ‚àír1V1Œ∏)
(10.1)
So for a large head rise one can make r2 > r1 as well as relying on the change in tangential velocity
VŒ∏. Recall that the key rule (Equation 2.1) can also be applied in the tangential direction only:
V2Œ∏ = W2Œ∏ + œâr2 = V2r tan Œ≤2 + œâr2
The relationship W2Œ∏ = V2r tan Œ≤2 can be seen in Figure 4.5 or worked out from a new velocity
triangle. The velocity V2r is obtained by applying the continuity equation at station 2:
Q = 2œÄr2b2(1 ‚àít2)V2r =‚áíV2r =
Q
2œÄr2b2(1 ‚àít2)
Substitute this into the expression for V2Œ∏ obtained earlier to give:
V2Œ∏ =
Q tan Œ≤2
2œÄr2b2(1 ‚àít2) + œâr2
If there is no swirl at entry then V1Œ∏ = 0. (A reasonable assumption as the inlet is usually the Ô¨Çow
from a pipe and pipe Ô¨Çow generally has no rotational motion). Substitute expressions for V1Œ∏ and V2Œ∏
into Equation 10.1 to give:
H = Œ∑p
g

œâ tan Œ≤2

P = œÅ

œâ tan Œ≤2


(10.3)
Equations 10.2 and 10.3 provide powerful insights into the choices designers have in determining
pump geometry and operation. Consider Equation 10.2. The pump head (or pressure) rise produced
increases with increasing efÔ¨Åciency. At zero Ô¨Çow rate the head produced by the pump is determined
by the rotational speed, radius and efÔ¨Åciency only, because Equation 10.2 with Q = 0 becomes:
H = Œ∑p

Figure 10.1: Three Blade Angles at Impeller Exit
Figure 10.2: H vs Q for Three Blade Angles
The tan Œ≤2 term is also important. Consider three cases of radial pump design: Ô¨Årstly where Œ≤2 is
positive, this is often described as forward leaning, secondly where Œ≤2 is zero called radial exit and
Ô¨Ånally Œ≤2 is negative known as backward leaning. These three geometries are shown in Figure 10.1.
Equation 10.2 can be used to predict the performance of the pump as the Ô¨Çow rate varies at
constant rotational speed. (This is generally achieved by adjusting valves at inlet and exit to the
pump, though exactly how this is achieved is not important for this discussion).
The three cases are sketched on Figure 10.2 which shows two lines for each of the three pump
geometries. The Ô¨Årst of which is with constant efÔ¨Åciency (blue lines) so are straight lines on the graph
as from Equation 10.2 H is linear with Q when everything else is constant. The three cases are:

129 
Figure 10.3: P vs Q for Three Blade Angles
‚Ä¢ For Œ≤2 = 0 (radial exit) then the head produced does not vary with Ô¨Çow rate, from Equation
10.2: tan Œ≤2 = tan 0 = 0.
‚Ä¢ For Œ≤2 > 0 (forward leaning) the head produced increases with increasing Ô¨Çow rate, as tan Œ≤2 >
0.
‚Ä¢ For Œ≤2 < 0 (backward leaning) the head produced decreases with increasing Ô¨Çow rate.
The plots are then repeated with an efÔ¨Åciency that varies with the maximum value being at a
design Ô¨Çow rate Qdesign and reducing efÔ¨Åciency either side of the design value. These are the red
lines shown in Figure 10.2 and show a more realistic characteristic curve for the pump. The key point
is that with a simple equation the performance of pump as a whole has been characterised.
The power variation with Ô¨Çow rate can also be sketched using Equation 10.3 which is shown
in Figure 10.3. The Q2 term in equation 10.3 is signiÔ¨Åcant. When Œ≤2 > 0 this term results in the
gradient of the P vs Q line increasing with increasing Ô¨Çow rate. For radial exit tan Œ≤2 = 0 so the
gradient is constant and for backwards leaning tan Œ≤2 < 0 so the gradient reduces with increasing
Ô¨Çow rate.
As a result of this backward leaning is generally preferred to forward leaning, despite the lower
head produced. Backward leaning pumps have a higher efÔ¨Åciency due to lower exit swirl and forward
leaning blades have an increasingly steep power curve. If Q is underestimated, the power requirement
will be greatly underestimated so backward leaning blades are more tolerant of Ô¨Çow rate errors.
10.1
Pump Diffuser Analysis
For a machine with radial exit Ô¨Çow from the rotor, the kinetic energy may be reduced either by means
of a vaned diffuser, or a vaneless diffuser. For a vaneless diffuser, as the Ô¨Çow goes out radially by

continuity:
Vr √ó r = constant = K1 or Vr = K1/r
By conservation of angular momentum:
VŒ∏ r = constant = K2 or VŒ∏ = K2/r
The exit kinetic energy is therefore given by:
V 2
2 = V 2
Œ∏ + V 2

=

2r2 (K2

So the exit kinetic energy reduces with the inverse square of the radius:

r2
In a Ô¨Çow where the total pressure is conserved there will be a a corresponding increase in static
pressure. If this pressure rise is large enough to cause separation then vanes may be required to control
the Ô¨Çow.

Pump Losses
Losses are often expressed in terms of fractions of a dynamic head, in a similar manner to the tech-
nique used in the Kaplan turbine in Chapter 9. For an impeller the relative dynamic head at inlet

is used. This is because Ô¨Çuid friction causes most of the loss and the relative motion between the
impeller surface and the mainstream Ô¨Çow is the cause of much of that Ô¨Çuid friction. The head loss for
an impeller is given as:
ŒîHImp = KImp
W 2

2g
KImp is the impeller loss coefÔ¨Åcient. For the diffuser the loss coefÔ¨Åcient is based on the absolute
exit velocity:
ŒîHDiff = KDiff
V 2

In actual fact the diffuser is the major source of loss in the pump. The loss in a diffuser may also
be expressed in terms of a diffuser efÔ¨Åciency:
Œ∑Diff = Œîpactual
Œîpideal
(10.4)
where Œîpideal is the ideal pressure rise with diffusion to zero velocity, so Œîpideal is effectively the
dynamic pressure at impeller exit or:

where station 3 is the diffuser exit. The diffuser head loss is given by:
ŒîHDiff = H2 ‚àíH3
Total head is made up of pressure, velocity and height terms, assuming that the height terms are
negligible the diffuser head loss can be rewritten:
ŒîHDiff = H2 ‚àíH3 = p2

Centrifugal Pump Example
Example
Consider a centrifugal pump with data:
‚Ä¢ At impeller inlet, mean radius, r1m = 0.1 m, blade height, b1 = 0.1 m
‚Ä¢ At impeller exit, radius, r2 = 0.2 m, blade height, b2 = 0.03 m, blade blockage, t = 0.08
‚Ä¢ Backward leaning blades with Œ≤2 = ‚àí20‚ó¶
‚Ä¢ Flow rate of water, Q = 0.2 m3/s, Rotational speed, N = 1450 rev/min
‚Ä¢ Assume for losses: Impeller, Kimp = 10%; Diffuser efÔ¨Åciency = 60%
Calculate: The relative Ô¨Çow at impeller inlet, absolute Ô¨Çow at impeller exit, the power required,
head produced and the pump efÔ¨Åciency.
Solution
The basic strategy is to work form pump inlet to exit drawing the cascade view and
velocity triangles through the machine.

But VŒ∏1 = 0 so:
w = 151.8 √ó (0.20 √ó 28.26) = 857.97 J/kg
Power input is obtain directly from the speciÔ¨Åc work input:
P = œÅQw = 1000 √ó 0.2 √ó 857.97 = 171.59 kW
Head and Pump EfÔ¨Åciency
Idea head rise is obtained from w = gŒîHi, so:
ŒîHi = w
g = 857.97
9.81
= 87.46 m
Actual Head Rise is given by ŒîHa = ŒîHi ‚àílosses where
losses = ŒîHimp + ŒîHdiff

Therefore ŒîHdiff = 16.96 m - note the large diffuser loss in comparison with the impeller loss.
The total head rise across the pump is therefore:

Figure 10.6: Pump Inlet
ŒîHa = 87.46 ‚àí1.23 ‚àí16.96 = 69.27 m
Pump efÔ¨Åciency can also be calculated easily:-
Œ∑p = Ideal Work wi for actual ŒîHa
Actual Work w
Now wi = gŒîHa minimum work required and w = gŒîHi. This can be confusing but recall that
the actual work has to supply the actual head and the losses, the ideal head is therefore always higher
than the actual head produced. The efÔ¨Åciency is therefore given by:
Œ∑p = gŒîHa
gŒîHi
= 69.27
87.46 = 0.792
10.4
Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH)
Consider the pump shown in Figure 10.6, the pump inlet station 0 is at atmospheric pressure. The
impeller inlet station 1 must be at a lower pressure p1 to ensure Ô¨Çow into the pump.
For cavitation to be avoided (See Chapter 9 for details about the phenomenon of cavitation) then
p1 > pv where pv is the saturated vapour pressure of the liquid in question. This is a property of the
Ô¨Çuid and for water can be found in steam tables such as Rogers and Mayhew (1994). Normally this
pressure is converted to a head h =
p
œÅg as pressure changes can be directly related to the physical
location of the machine above or below the datum.
For satisfactory operation some margin is needed between the saturated pressure vapour and the
pressure at inlet to the impeller this is called the Net Positive Suction Head or NPSH for short:
p1 ‚àípv
œÅg
= h1 ‚àíhv = NPSH

Consider the total head change from pump inlet 0 at pressure pa and height z = z0 = 0 to impeller
inlet 1 where z = z1:
Ho = H1 + hf
where hf is the frictional head loss between station 0 and station 1. At station 0 the velocity
can be regarded as very small as the reservoir that the pump is taking Ô¨Çuid from is generally large
compared to the pipe inlet diameter and since z0 = 0 m the total head is simply equal to the pressure
head which is given by atmospheric pressure so:
pa
œÅg = p1
œÅg + V 2
1
2g + z1 + hf =‚áíha = h1 + V 2
1
2g + z1 + hf
this can be rearranged to give h1:
h1 = ha ‚àíV 2
1
2g ‚àíz1 ‚àíhf
but NPSH = h1 ‚àíhv so:
NPSH = ha ‚àíhv ‚àíV 2
1
2g ‚àíz1 ‚àíhf
(10.6)
This is a very important parameter in pump selection and analysis. Note how the NPSH is reduced by
high inlet velocity, high height above the water surface and large friction losses in the inlet piping. In
fact most pumps do not operate in the manner shown in Figure 10.6 and are usually operated below
the water level, this means that z1 would be negative increasing the NPSH.

In practise NPSH values are obtained using empirical criteria. One simple treatment is to use
Thoma‚Äôs parameter given by:
œÉ = NPSH
ŒîH
(10.7)
where ŒîH is the total head rise across the pump, cavitation is deemed to occur when œÉ = œÉcrit
which has to obtained empirically.
10.4.1
Cavitation Example
Example
Consider the previous centrifugal pump example. Calculate the impeller inlet height
above the free surface water level for no cavitation. If the critical value of Thoma‚Äôs parameter is
œÉcrit = 0.1. The water temperature is 25‚ó¶and atmospheric pressure = 1.0 bar. The inlet duct loss is
25% of the inlet dynamic head to the pump.
Solution
To determine the maximum applicable height the inlet loss is examined:
ŒîHi = h0 ‚àí

h1 + V 2
1
2g + z1

=‚áíz1 = h0 ‚àíh1 ‚àíV 2
1
2g ‚àíŒîHi
The problem then reduces to Ô¨Ånding values for h0, h1, V1 and Œîhi. The NPSH can be calculated as
follows:
NPSH = h1 ‚àíhv = œÉcrit √ó ŒîH = 0.1 √ó 69.27 = 6.93 m
Now pv = 3.17kPa at 25‚ó¶for water, this is obtained from standard steam tables (Rogers and Mayhew
(1994)). This pressure is converted to a head as follows:
hv = pv
œÅg = 3.17 √ó 103
1000 √ó 9.81 = 0.323 m(abs)
Absolute pressures and not gauge (relative pressures) must be used. From the deÔ¨Ånition of NPSH:
h1 = NPSH + hv = 6.93 + 0.323 = 7.25 m(abs)
The inlet loss is 25% of V 2
1 /2g so:
ŒîHi = 0.25V 2
1
2g = 0.25 3.1832
2 √ó 9.81 = 0.129 m
At the inlet to the pump (station 0) the total head is given by the inlet pressure head as Vo, z0 = 0
so:
h0 = pa
œÅg =
1.0 √ó 105
1000 √ó 9.81 = 10.194 m(abs)
So the maximum height above the water at which the pump can be placed is given by:
z1 = h0 ‚àíh1 ‚àíV 2
1
2g ‚àíŒîHi = 10.194 ‚àí7.25 ‚àí0.516 ‚àí0.129 = 2.299m
So the maximum height is around 2m above the water.

Application to Real Pumps
This book is about the basic concepts in turbomachinery and if you were to design a real pump you
would need to take account of more advanced concepts such as slip - where the exit from the pump
blades does not exactly follow the angle set by the blades. Although there is not space for it in this
book for further details see Dixon (2005).
10.6
Problems
1. A radial Ô¨Çow pump delivers 0.015 m3/s when running at a speed of 1470 rev/min. The
impeller has a uniform width of 15 mm, with an entry diameter of 70 mm and an exit diameter
of 120mm. It has backswept blades with a relative exit Ô¨Çow angle of ‚àí50‚ó¶. The blade blockage
at exit is 8%. Calculate the power required to drive the pump and the relative Ô¨Çow angle at inlet
to the impeller. Answers: 803 W;‚àí49.8‚ó¶
2. The losses for the pump in the previous question are estimated to be 15% of the relative dynamic
head at inlet to the impeller and 45% of the dynamic head at inlet to the diffuser. Calculate the
head delivered and the efÔ¨Åciency of the pump. Answers: 4.12 m; 75.4%

Basic Concepts in Turbomachinery

Chapter 11
Summary
There are three really difÔ¨Åcult ideas in this book:
‚Ä¢ The Cascade and Meridional View. Essential this idea is how one can relate the machine
geometry to the analysis model. In the author‚Äôs view this is one of the most difÔ¨Åcult concepts
in turbomachinery and is the most important idea in the book! This concept has been discussed
at length throughout the book but with particular emphasis in Chapter 1.
‚Ä¢ Velocity Triangles. These are essential for the calculation and understanding of machine per-
formance and allow the graphical representation of the ‚Äúkey rule‚Äù: ‚ÉóV = ‚ÉóU + ‚ÉóW, this concept
is used throughout the book but is Ô¨Årst explained in Chapter 2.
‚Ä¢ Reaction. Very simply reaction is a choice between high work (low reaction) and high efÔ¨Å-
ciency (high reaction). The geometry set by the blade angles determines velocities through the
turbomachine and in Chapter 6 it was shown that this determines the reaction: the pressure drop
between the stator and the rotor.
A number of key equations have been developed and applied to turbomachines:
‚Ä¢ Continuity or conservation of mass. Equation 5.1: Àôm = œÅAV
‚Ä¢ Conservation of angular momentum. Euler equation 5.12: w = œâ(V2Œ∏r2 ‚àíV1Œ∏r1)
‚Ä¢ Conservation of energy or Rothalpy conservation across a blade row. Equation 5.17: I =
h0 ‚àíUVŒ∏ = constant
Finally the concepts and equations have been combined to analyse the performance of a number
of different machines: gas turbines, steam turbines, pumps and hydraulic turbines. This book gives
an introduction to turbomachinery and (hopefully) empowers the reader to either understand more
advanced texts or give an appreciation of the operation of these important devices. Further reading
on turbomachinery may be found in Cumpsty (1997), Dixon (2005) or Cohen et al. (1996).
