Introduction
I
n the grand accounting of the planet, every step you take toward a 
greener lifestyle makes a difference. Toss your banana peel in a compost 
pile instead of into a plastic trash bag, and you get to pat yourself on the 
back. Of course you’re not going to save the planet by taking your own reus-
able tote bag to the grocery store, but you’re reducing your consumption of 
fossil fuels and contribution to landfills. Not bad, eh? You won’t solve water-
shortage issues by using native plants in your landscape, but you save gal-
lons and gallons of the precious stuff.
Those examples are just a few of the zillions of tips you find in this guide. Flip 
through these pages, find the suggestions that sound do-able to you, and con-
sider yourself a valued contributor to the growing green movement.
About This Book
Don’t let the impressive heft of this book fool you: Within it are easy-to-digest 
overviews of the many ways you might approach taking your home to the 
next level of ecofriendliness. Under one bright yellow cover are highlights 
from a stack of books on topics environmentally conscious. The information 
herein gives you practical tips for going greener — all without waxing judg-
mental about any current practices.
No home is perfect. Taking steps to make yours better is a hugely commend-
able effort, and this book can be a springboard for your undertakings.
You aren’t expected to commit anything within these pages to memory. 
Instead, use this guide as a reference, opening it whenever you want to 
answer a question, revisit advice, or follow steps for a project. Where you 
open it is up to you — this isn’t a typical, read from cover to cover kind of 
book. It’s designed to be at the ready whenever you feel the urge to find out 
more about the topics within it.

What You’re Not to Read
This book keeps nonessential information to an absolute minimum, but 
wherever its authors felt powerfully compelled to include information that’s 
interesting but not critical to your understand of the topic, that information 
appears in a sidebar (shaded gray box of text) or next to a Technical Stuff 
icon. You may well find this information interesting, but you can skip it and 
still get all the relevant facts you need.
Foolish Assumptions
Writing this book meant making a few assumptions about who you might be. 
One or more of the following probably apply:
 
 You want to find out more about how you can make your home life 
greener by taking small steps that work for you and working toward 
greener steps as you can.
 
 You don’t want to be scolded for the things you’re doing but you do 
want to make positive changes in your habits.
 
 You’re ready to dig into making your home more energy efficient, 
healthier, and more comfortable — even more beautiful.
 
 You want any changes you make to be easy on your budget as well as 
the earth.
 
 You have an inkling of the environmental issues facing our planet.

 Introduction
 
 You’re not necessarily a crusader, but you are interested in practical 
tips for lessening your household’s impact on the community and the 
planet.
How This Book Is Organized
Within this book is a cornucopia of approaches to making your home more 
ecofriendly. The following sections give you an idea of what information 
you find where. Flip right over to whichever topic most excites your green 
impulses.
Book I: Green Living
Maybe your first thought about making your home greener had to do with 
solar panels or energy-efficient appliances, but the simplest place to start 
making your household greener is with the way you live within it. This book 
introduces you to good reasons for going greener and shows you how to 
make simple changes. You find out how to reuse or recycle the items that 
may be ending up in your garbage can, as well as how to grow or choose 
greener groceries, even outside the produce section. You get tips for bringing 
your kids into the green act and keeping the air in your home healthier.
Book II: Energy Efficiency
Only a rare home has no room for improvement when it comes to energy 
efficiency. You might be amazed at the simple fixes that reap huge rewards 
for making your heating and air conditioning, lighting, water use, and 
appliances more efficient.
Book III: Green Cleaning
So maybe the cleaners you’re using now do a magnificent job of making your 
floors and windows sparkle, but many of them are doing very ugly things 
to the water supply. Put to rest any worries that you have to sacrifice that 
sparkle to lessen your environmental impact. This book shows you how very 
valuable bringing green to your clean is and gives you all kinds of practical 
information to do just that, including recipes for inexpensive cleaners you 
can whip up in your kitchen (just before you clean it).

Book IV: Green Remodeling
Abandon your old house for a new one? Hardly a sustainable action, even if 
you’re moving to a super-efficient model. Remodeling is the greener choice, 
and you score a gazillion extra points for remodeling with green materials 
and energy-efficient systems. This book takes you through the choices and 
projects that make a green difference in your home.
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping
In a beautiful confluence of concept and actuality, you can green up the green 
things growing in your lawn. Hard to wrap the ol’ noggin’ around, maybe, but 
even the way you plan your landscape includes environmental concerns that 
go beyond what plant is going to look good where — which plant is going to 
grow best with the least use of resources and which location does the best 
things for increasing your home’s efficiency. (No jive: A well-placed tree helps 
reduce your energy use.)
Book VI: Organic Gardening
Growing your garden with only what nature gave you — and in reasonable 
portions — is a satisfying way to go green (thumb). And walking into the back 
yard to pluck your dinner from branches and plants is the ultimate in staying 
local. With smart choices for getting your soil in to premium shape, control-
ling weeds and pests, and raising fruits and veggies the organic way, you get 
what you need to have the greenest yard on the block.
Book VII: Solar Power
Tapping into just a smidge of the power the sun puts out every day could 
power the planet. As solar power becomes more and more commonly uti-
lized, the once astronomical (pun totally intended) cost of bringing solar 
energy to your home is coming down. You can dig into solar with projects 
small and large, and in this book, you find out how solar works and how best 
to make it work for your home.

Chapter 1
The World’s Gone Green!
In This Chapter
 Exploring choices and the benefits of change
 Uncovering hidden chemicals in your household
 Making small changes every day for big, green gains
 Taking care of the home outside your house
 Imagining a greener future
Just what does green living mean, anyway? Different people use different 
definitions, but it all comes down to one fundamental concept: The earth’s 
resources shouldn’t be depleted faster than they can be replenished. From that 
concept comes everything else, including caring for the environment, animals 
and other living things, your health, your local community, and communities 
around the world.
When you start to look at all the different kinds of resources — from fossil fuels 
to forests, agricultural land to wildlife, and the ocean’s depths to the air that 
you breathe — you see how everything is interconnected and how the actions 
that you take today can affect the future. This chapter looks at the impact your 
lifestyle has on the earth’s resources and then summarizes positive steps that 
you can take to protect and preserve those resources — starting today.
Understanding the Impact 
of Your Choices
Think about the concept of green living (also called sustainable living) as 
being a lot like your family budget. If you spend more than you make each 
month and neglect your bills as a result, the bill collectors start calling. If you 
keep going down the same path, you end up owing so much that you can’t 
possibly pay it back. On the other hand, if you’re careful with your monthly 
expenses (maybe even saving a little), you’re able to live within your means 
and keep everyone happy — especially you.

10
Book I: Green Living 
The planet’s no different. Right now, its resources are being depleted far 
faster than they can be replenished. The call of the bill collectors is getting 
louder all the time, with the clear implication that bankruptcy’s down the 
road if something doesn’t change. Fossil fuels such as oil are becoming more 
difficult and more expensive to bring out of the ground, and their reserves 
are dwindling. Burning fossil fuels to provide energy for homes, vehicles, 
and industries emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases along with 
pollutants that affect the health of the planet and its people.
Other resources are in trouble too, including water. In some parts of the 
United States, drought conditions are becoming more common and more 
widespread. Debates continue about where to find sources of water: to pipe 
it in from other areas, to drill into underground aquifers, or even to build 
desalination plants to take the salt out of seawater. One possible effect of 
global warming is the further reduction of groundwater sources. Decreasing 
the demand that people place on water sources is essential in order to 
continue having enough water to go around.
Thankfully, it’s not too late to turn the situation around — to make the 
changes that the planet and its people need for a safe, healthy, prosperous, and 
compassionate future. Changes need to happen quickly, however: According 
to the United Nations, some parts of the world are nearing the tipping point, 
after which the damage will be irreparable.
 
A useful way to understand your impact on the environment is to measure 
your ecological footprint, which is the land and water needed to support 
your consumption of goods and resources. Think of it as a way of describing 
the amount of land and water required to farm your food, mine your energy 
sources, transport your goods and services, and hold your waste. Your 
carbon footprint is a subsection of your ecological footprint and measures the 
carbon dioxide created by the things you do and the products you buy.
You make decisions every day that have an impact on the planet: choosing 
between the car and local rapid transit, for example, or selecting local or 
organic fresh food instead of packaged, processed food that has been trans-
ported long distances. Think about the impact that each individual decision 
has and weigh the pros and cons of your everyday actions.
The Earth Day Network, a network of environmental organizations and projects, 
estimates that there are 4.5 biologically productive acres worldwide per person. 
The average American’s ecological footprint, however, is 24 acres, which means 
that a lot of people are using more resources than the planet can afford.
 
You can measure your own ecological footprint simply by visiting the Earth 
Day Network Web site at www.earthday.net and entering some informa-
tion about your lifestyle. If you’re just starting a greener lifestyle, reducing 
your ecological footprint may seem a little daunting. You can reduce it signifi-
cantly, though, and it won’t take long. Use the questions from the Earth Day 
Network to think about where you’d like to start reducing your impact.

Book I
Green

Climate change: A sign of changing times
Climate change (also known as global warming) is a huge issue in the 
world today, but it accounts for only part of all damage being done to the 
environment — damage that will dramatically change the way that the earth 
is able to provide for the needs of its residents in the future. In fact, climate 
change isn’t actually the problem but a symptom, or product, of two far more 
important problems:
 
 The amount of the earth’s natural resources that humans consume in 
order to live, especially in advancing economies
 
 The waste that spills over into the earth’s land and atmosphere as a 
result of that consumption
When you put those two problems together over an extended period of time, 
they have a domino effect: They contribute to issues such as the earth’s cli-
mate change and regional food and water shortages, which in turn have their 
own environmental impacts.
 
Fortunately, humanity — and each individual — is capable of moving the 
earth to a healthier place for all by taking small steps every day.
Mother Nature and the law 
of supply and demand
Human beings naturally aspire to more technologically advanced, convenient 
lifestyles — the payoff for lots of hard work. Unfortunately, the laws of Mother 
Nature say that all things come at a cost; in the case of material goods, that 
cost is in the form of the earth’s resources. These resources include not only 
those used to produce fossil fuels and, therefore, energy, but also resources 
such as water and the land that produces food.
The vast majority of the energy that people use to heat and power homes and 
businesses, fuel vehicles, and manufacture home furnishings and all other 
material goods comes from nonrenewable sources called fossil fuels, which 
are energy-rich organic substances traced back to the remains of organisms 
that lived 300 to 400 million years ago. Often found under the sea bed, fossil 
fuels include oil, coal, and natural gas, and they consist primarily of carbon 
and hydrogen. Today, these substances are extracted from the earth’s crust 
and are mostly refined into suitable fuel products, such as gas, propane, 
heating oil, and kerosene.
Uranium, the other nonrenewable energy source, is used in nuclear power 
plants, which can produce very few emissions — but those plants have their 
own environmental issues in terms of radioactive waste.

12
Book I: Green Living 
Fossil fuels currently provide 85 percent of the energy needs of the United 
States. They’re also responsible for the lion’s share of greenhouse gas emis-
sions, such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, and they 
contribute to particles that can cause acid rain.
Pondering pollution’s impact
One of the great examples of how humanity directly impacts the planet (and 
indirectly affects itself) is waste, whether it comes from a factory smokestack 
or is consigned to a landfill or incinerator, because of its potential to pollute 
the atmosphere, the land, and the water. It may be “out of sight, out of mind,” 
but waste and its associated pollution still have an impact on the environment.
The burning of fossil fuels is perhaps the greatest contributor to pollution, 
yet it’s currently the primary means for generating and transporting energy. 
Electrical energy, for example, is one of the most popular forms of energy 
supplied around the world. The cheapest and most reliable way of providing 
electricity to cities and towns involves power generation plants that burn 
fossil fuels, such as coal. The energy required for transporting the coal to the 
plant comes from refining oil — also a fossil fuel.
Although many waste materials, products, and packaging can find space in 
landfill sites or incinerators, their components have to be dealt with to avoid 
emitting potentially toxic chemicals back into the land and the air. True, new 
landfills are carefully sealed so that their contents don’t leak, and incinera-
tors use much cleaner technology than they once did. But all these improve-
ments require energy, which is exactly what the people of the world should 
consume less of.
Making the Move toward 
a Sustainable Lifestyle
As you begin to make your life greener, you’ll see benefits well beyond the 
immediate green ones such as reducing carbon emissions, reducing waste, 
and supporting the local economy. You’ll discover that being green can 
improve your life in all kinds of areas.
Here are just a few of the major benefits of a sustainable lifestyle:
 
 Saving money: Consuming less of any commodity — from electricity to 
water to clothes — means that you pay less, too. You’ll discover lower 
utility bills and a budget with breathing room when you take actions 
such as buying quality items that last a long time and even growing 
some of your own food.

13
 Chapter 1: The World’s Gone Green!
Book I

 Encouraging profits: When you support green and ethical businesses 
such as stores and financial institutions, you help them stay profitable 
enough to continue acting in environmentally and socially responsible 
ways. You also send a message to less responsible companies that they 
need to clean up their acts.
 
 Boosting health: Following the tips in this book about walking and cycling 
instead of driving and about reducing the amount of chemicals in your 
food, your home, and your garden can leave you with an improved cardio-
vascular and immune system, stronger muscles, and cleaner lungs.
 
 Leaving a legacy: The opportunity to protect what’s vital about the 
planet for future generations is perhaps the most important benefit of 
all. If you consume only what you need, reduce your trash, live more 
naturally, and invest carefully, you do a great deal to leave a planet that 
will benefit people and wildlife for centuries to come.
Changing what you can as you can
Although you can’t change the world and save the planet single-handedly, 
you can make a difference — and you can start right away with whatever 
budget and time you have available. Buying a hybrid-electric vehicle in order 
to reduce fossil-fuel consumption and emissions is an excellent strategy, but 
few people can afford to go out and buy a new car tomorrow (not to mention 
the implications of getting rid of your old one before its time). You have tons 
of options that are both easy and affordable, however.
The best strategy is to take change one step at a time and implement small — 
and eventually bigger — changes when and as you can. Also assess where you’re 
starting from (calculating your ecological footprint is one way to measure this; 
see the earlier section “Understanding the Impact of Your Choices”) and figure 
out what you can do to counter your effect if you can’t yet make the changes you 
want to make. Carbon offsets are one approach to reducing your impact: You buy 
back your carbon use by purchasing offsets, which fund projects that reduce 
greenhouse gases. Clean Air–Cool Planet maintains a directory of carbon offset 
providers at its Web site, www.cleanair-coolplanet.org.
Adopting the four primary green strategies
Here are four green living strategies that you can implement in a variety of 
ways to contribute to the solutions that the planet needs:
 
 Reduce consumption. Anything that you do to decrease the amount 
of the earth’s resources that you use — from choosing goods with less 
packaging to turning down your home’s thermostat a few degrees in the 
winter — helps you lead a more sustainable life.

14
Book I: Green Living 
 
 Choose carefully. Assessing where certain products and services come 
from by thinking about their entire life cycles from manufacture to 
disposal helps you make the greenest choices possible. You not only 
protect the environment but also protect the people involved in the 
manufacturing process.
 
 Opt for renewable resources. Using renewable resources (such as solar 
or wind energy) instead of nonrenewable resources (such as energy 
based on fossil fuels) is a very powerful green action — and it may be 
easier than you think.
 
 Repair when needed. You can find plenty of ways that you can help fix 
the damage that’s already been done to the environment, from supporting 
tree-planting projects to helping out with ecological community programs 
at home and around the world.
Taking those first small steps
Making small changes as and when you can puts you firmly on the road to 
living a much greener lifestyle. Trying to jump into it all at once can be coun-
terproductive, in fact, because the subject area is immense and is growing all 
the time. Instead, decide what your priorities are: Think about where it would 
be easiest for you to begin. Start there and work up to the bigger or more dif-
ficult issues.
 
Your priorities may not be the same as other people’s, but that’s okay: 
They’re yours, and you’re entitled to them. Be prepared to adjust them as 
new information becomes available, however. Research is ongoing in most 
areas of green living, so arguments will change. In the meantime, take one 
small step every time you’re ready to, and keep aspiring to be greener.
Great small starts include replacing your light bulbs as they burn out with 
compact fluorescent models and replacing your cleaning supplies as they run 
out with environmentally friendly ones.
Another tip that’s super-easy to implement is to buy items with less packag-
ing. Consider, for example, what would happen if you bought toilet paper in 
double rolls, which contain twice as much toilet paper in a roll than regular-
size rolls. That cuts down the number of cardboard tubes inside the rolls by 
half, and it also decreases the amount of plastic that’s used to wrap the pack-
ages! If you recycle the cardboard tubes that remain, even better. And if you 
slit the plastic wrap open only at the top of the package, you can reuse the 
wrap, perhaps as a trash bag. See how easy that was?
 
As you read through this book, jot down a list of actions that you can see 
yourself taking fairly easily. When you have a list, it’s easier to prioritize the 
tasks so that you don’t feel you need to tackle them all at once.

Turning green choices into 
habits around your home
Reducing, reusing, repairing, and recycling are the four most important 
actions when it comes to adopting a greener lifestyle because they all con-
tribute to conserving the earth’s resources.
 
Your home is one of the best places to start making green living changes 
because you have the control to make the choices that are best for you.
Along with energy efficiency, water conservation is a major issue, and it’s 
where you can really make a difference. Between the source and your faucet, 
water has to be pumped at various stages, and that takes energy, as does the 
process of treating the water. If you conserve water, you do double duty by 
conserving both water and energy, which helps reduce the amount of carbon 
emissions pumped into the atmosphere.
Most of the water used in homes — whether it’s for flushing, washing, clean-
ing, or drinking — is processed to the point of being high-quality drinking 
water. Although systems do exist to divert graywater (water that’s been used 
in sinks, for example, for hand- or dishwashing) to toilets for flushing, they’re 
not yet a common feature of home building and renovations. However, you 
can make a difference by preventing as much good-quality water as possible 
from running down the drain into the sewers, and then back to the process-
ing plant so that it can be finessed into drinking-quality water. Chapter 5 in 
Book II gives you great ideas for reducing your water usage.
 
When it comes to waste, reduce what you buy as much as possible — includ-
ing choosing the least amount of packaging possible — which will naturally 
reduce the waste you generate. Then assess your waste to see what can be 
reused or recycled; what’s waste to you may be useful to your friends and 
neighbors or to a nonprofit group (see Chapter 2 of this book).
Of course, your home extends to your yard, as well. Book V describes what a 
green yard looks like (Hint: The grass isn’t always greener.), and Book VI pro-
vides tips on taking your yard off chemicals and growing your own organic 
food with the help of composting.
 
When you introduce green living at home, everyone can be involved. 
Children learn from adults and then pass the word on to their friends, who 
pass it on to their parents. Give everyone an age-appropriate role to play by 
putting them in charge of some aspect of your greener household. You can 
find more about raising green children in Chapter 4 of this book.

16
Book I: Green Living 
Shopping greenly and ethically
Shopping is a great opportunity to make your lifestyle more sustainable. 
Choose the greenest options available to you, such as food produced using 
as few chemicals as possible, grown locally in season, and transported over 
as short a distance as possible to reduce the amount of fuel used. (Chapter 3 
of this book tells you more about green choices for your diet.) Other green 
options include buying clothes made from organically produced materials, 
goods made from recycled materials rather than resources that have to be 
mined from the earth, secondhand or vintage goods, and those made from 
biodegradable materials.
Ethical issues, including how the people and animals involved in the produc-
tion processes were treated, are also important to consider. You can find out 
a lot about the products you buy and the places you buy them by checking 
out www.ethicalshopping.com.
Avoiding goods produced using child labor or in sweatshop working condi-
tions also may be a priority for you. Animal welfare is a growing concern as 
well; consider choosing meat and dairy products that come from animals 
raised in humane conditions rather than intensively farmed, overcrowded 
pens and cages. Poor conditions for animals often go hand-in-hand with 
regrettable effects on the planet and on human health.
Finding Chemicals Where 
You’d Rather Not
The burning of fossil fuels for a variety of energy, transport, and industrial 
needs affects not only the global climate but also your health. Many toxic 
chemicals are emitted into the environment, whether into the air, ground, 
waterways, and even through the food you eat.
In the air
People living close to industrial sites in countries with little or no environ-
mental regulation for emissions and pollution of air, land, and water are at 
risk for health problems, including asthma and other respiratory diseases.
Even in countries where environmental regulation is taken more seriously, 
the sheer volume of traffic in urban areas puts people at risk for diseases 
caused or made worse by air pollution.

You may not see it, but some of the pollution floating around in the air is a 
major health hazard. Some of the dangers include
 
 Ozone: Good ozone is the layer that exists between 6.2 and 31 miles 
above the earth’s surface and protects you from the sun’s ultravio-
let rays. Bad ozone is formed when pollutants emitted by vehicles, 
factories, and refineries react chemically in the presence of sunlight. 
Ozone can bring on respiratory infections and increase the incidence of 
asthma.
 
 Particle pollution: Most fine-particle pollutants are visible only through 
a microscope, but together they form the smog you see on windless 
days. Particle pollutants are emitted directly (from vehicle exhausts and 
manufacturing plants, for example) or are formed in the atmosphere 
when other pollutants react with them. They can cause major respira-
tory difficulties and have even been linked to lung and heart illnesses.
 
 Carbon monoxide: Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas 
that’s difficult to detect. It forms when the carbon in fuels doesn’t com-
pletely burn. Vehicles contribute a high proportion of CO to the atmo-
sphere; industry and brushfires also contribute to CO emissions. Carbon 
monoxide in the body restricts blood flow, affects those with cardio-
vascular problems, and can even be fatal when it builds up in enclosed 
spaces (such as homes and garages due to faulty furnaces or venting).
 
 Sulfur dioxide: Sulfur dioxide is also colorless, but its rotten-egg smell 
makes identifying it easy. It’s a reactive gas that’s produced when coal 
and oil are burned in places like power plants and industrial boilers. 
The smell is the main reason that people stay away from industrial areas 
using these fuels. But besides being offensive to the nose, it’s offensive 
to the lungs and heart.
 
The next time you watch the local news on TV, pay attention to the weather 
report’s air-quality index. This index measures the extent of major gases and 
particles delivered into the air on a given day, and it provides an indication 
of the potential for health issues for those who are vulnerable to respiratory 
conditions.
So what is an Ozone Action Day?
A state or city declares an Ozone Action Day 
when weather conditions make an area partic-
ularly vulnerable to ozone-producing pollution. 
On an Ozone Action Day, make an extra effort to 
reduce your polluting activities. Don’t drive, for 
example, unless you have to. Put off filling up 
your car’s gas tank, mowing the lawn, or using 
any other gas-powered lawn equipment.

A recent study at Northwestern University sheds some light on how air pol-
lution can cause not just respiratory ailments but also cardiovascular events, 
such as heart attacks and strokes. The study found that the pollution parti-
cles triggered the formation of blood clots in mice, and blood clots can cause 
both heart attacks and strokes, depending on whether they form or move 
within the body to the heart or the brain.
In foods
The need to feed the world’s growing population and the demand for inex-
pensive food has led to mass food production. Intensive farming methods 
have developed to meet demand and to get food onto plates quickly. These 
methods include
 
 Chemical additives, antibiotics, and artificial hormones used to make 
animals and birds grow more quickly and to prevent disease in herds 
and flocks
 
 Chemical pesticides and fertilizers used to raise the quantities of crops 
that can be produced per acre of land while sending environmentally 
harmful runoff into waterways
The long-term health effects of these farming methods aren’t always clear 
immediately, but they are cause for concern. For example, antibiotics in 
Sniffing out some air-freshener alternatives
Air fresheners, most of which simply cover up 
smells rather than remove them, contain chem-
icals. Plug-in air fresheners use energy while 
they’re pumping their chemicals into the air. 
What’s more, some people find that air fresh-
eners make them short of breath and give them 
headaches. In all, air fresheners aren’t particu-
larly eco-friendly.
Fortunately, you can enjoy a nice-smelling 
home while using an air freshener because 
natural alternatives abound. Both vinegar and 
baking soda dissolved in water absorb bad 
smells. Lemon slices in a pan of boiling water 
make another good air freshener. If you have 
smokers in your house, hide a small bowl of vin-
egar under a piece of furniture to deodorize the 
room. Burning natural beeswax or vegetable 
wax candles with pure essential oils also takes 
the cigarette smoke out of the air and stops fab-
rics from getting smelly.
Another alternative to the conventional air 
freshener is to use essential oils to make rooms 
smell nice. Get an oil burner, some small can-
dles, and your favorite pure essential oils to get 
a more pleasant smell. For even less work, fill 
up a bowl with petals from flowers and herbs 
from your garden!

the food chain can cause people to become resistant to them, which causes 
problems when the antibiotics are essential to the treatment of a medical 
condition. The Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE, also called mad cow 
disease) outbreak, which led to the deaths of more than 150 people in the 
United Kingdom in the 1990s and 2000s, was a direct result of particular bone 
meal products added to the food given to beef cattle to keep the costs of beef 
production down. (Chapter 3 of this book looks at the food you eat and how to 
buy the greenest food available. If you’re feeling ambitious, Chapters 4 and 5 in 
Book VI tell you how to grow your own food.)
In products
The biggest users of chemicals that are potentially harmful to human health 
are industries that manufacture medicines, plastics, textiles, detergents, 
paints, and pesticides. Two problems are inherent with the chemicals found 
in these products:
 
 The products bring people into daily contact with potentially harmful 
substances.
 
 The processes used to create the products create waste that’s 
potentially harmful.
When the manufacture of these chemical-containing products (see the list of 
potentially harmful chemicals later in this section) began decades ago, the 
toxic mess produced was invariably released into nearby waterways, emit-
ted into the air, or simply dumped on the ground. Environmental regulations 
in many industrialized countries are now in place to prevent some of these 
issues, but more and more people are at risk from contaminated air, land, 
and water in areas where environmental regulations haven’t kept up with 
industry. And even in the United States, regulations allow the emission of cer-
tain amounts of chemicals as long as they’re kept within specific limits.
Toxic chemical leaks from industrial sites do still happen in the United States 
as well, despite enforcement of environmental regulations. For example, in 
October 2007, the leak of 500 gallons of hydrochloric acid at a metal plating 
plant in Melvindale, Michigan, caused the evacuation of approximately 3,000 
local residents. In parts of the world where factories routinely get rid of their 
waste into the nearest stretch of water and where local people are dependent 
on that water for everyday use, the dangers are huge. And in many parts of 
the world, untreated wastewater from septic treatment plants also finds it 
way into the nearest stretch of water, where it routinely causes disease. This 
contamination leaves people at risk of disease and toxic poisoning.
Some of the major potentially harmful substances that may be introduced 
into the environment include

20
Book I: Green Living 
 
 Brominated flame retardants: These substances are used in plastics for 
computer casings, white goods, car interiors, carpets, and polyurethane 
foams in furniture and bedding. They can end up in the dust of homes 
and offices and are linked with cancer and reproductive problems.
 
 Dioxins: A byproduct of PVC (polyvinyl chloride, made into anything 
from window frames to plastic), industrial bleaching, and incineration, 
dioxins can lead to diseases of the immune system, reproductive and 
developmental disorders, and cancer.
 
 Lead and mercury: Toxic heavy metals that don’t break down in the envi-
ronment and aren’t destroyed at any temperature include lead and mercury 
(which is also used in people’s dental fillings). Lead is the most prevalent 
industrial toxin released into the environment and therefore causes the 
most environmentally related health problems. It’s released into the atmo-
sphere through gas and paint. Low levels of lead and mercury can cause 
mental illness, learning disabilities, and stunted growth in children.
 
 Organochlorine pesticides: These types of pesticide include DDT, 
dieldrin, heptachlor, chlordane, and mirex, all of which are used in 
farming and gardening and can end up in soils, the water table, rivers, 
and streams. Most have been banned in many countries, including 
the United States, because they can cause cancer and are toxic to the 
immune system; however, these substances can linger in the ground. 
DDT is particularly tenacious, and a 2000 study found that DDT is still 
detectable in blood streams (although thankfully at ever-decreasing 
levels) despite its being banned for more than 30 years.
 
 Perfluorochemicals: These acids are used in the manufacture of every-
day items, such as clothing, stain-resistant materials, and cosmetics. 
They’re linked to cancer and liver damage.
 
 Phthalates: One of the most omnipresent groups of chemicals and used 
mainly as softeners in polyvinyl chloride (PVC), as well as in cosmetics 
and perfumes, these chemicals disrupt hormones.
 
Use fewer of the products that contain these substances, and you reduce the 
need for them, and eventually manufacturers stop producing them.
Taking Care of the Community 
Outside Your Door
In the past three decades, the world’s population living in urban areas has 
gone from one-third to just over half. In the United States, 80 percent of the 
population lives in metropolitan areas. Growing world populations, which are 
moving toward large urban areas, mean that more and more people are living 
in close quarters near sources of pollution, such as factories and large con-
centrations of vehicles and even infection from each other.

 Chapter 1: The World’s Gone Green!

Clearly, the earth can take only so much. It can’t replenish its resources 
at the same rate that people are currently consuming them, and its rate of 
replenishment may well decrease further as climate change continues to 
affect both the land and the oceans. Add to that a growing urbanization of the 
world’s population as a result of economic growth, and you have a situation 
in which land, water, and wildlife are all at risk.
Simply throwing more fertilizer, genetic modifications, or chemicals at crops 
isn’t a long-term, green solution. Instead, people need to understand where 
the problems are coming from — including land clearing, water consumption 
practices, overconsumption, and breaking links in the food chain — so that 
they can find solutions.
 
 Clearing the land: One major concern in modern-day society is that the 
amount of land available in the world for growing crops and supporting 
animal herds for food (such as cattle and sheep) is insufficient to support 
the food needs of the world’s population. The causes are urbanization 
and land clearing for economic development (added to the fact that large 
areas of the world aren’t suitable for agriculture).
 
 Clearing the land has a number of negative effects on ecosystems, 
among them the following:
 
• When you replace forests or wetlands, for example, with agricul-
ture or development, soil erosion occurs. Clouds of dirt can even 
be seen blowing in the wind over farmland in drier areas as topsoil 
disappears, leaving the resulting land with fewer nutrients and less 
ability to soak up rain, which means increased flooding.
 
• Stripping the land removes tracts of forest and other vegetation that 
would otherwise use and store the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, 
thus reducing the earth’s ability to deal with greenhouse gases.
 
• Food and other essential products have to be transported into 
towns and cities to support people who no longer produce their 
own food and clothing. As a result, energy consumption for trans-
portation increases.
 
• Mass production farming methods are required to produce the 
food needed for growing populations. This scenario leads to the 
breakdown of the family farm, which is being replaced by large 
corporate farming entities that can afford the technology and 
research needed for mass production.
 
• The amount of waste that has to be disposed of in urban areas 
grows as the population does, in part because as people become 
separated from the land that supports them, their concern about 
reducing waste through such techniques as composting decreases.
 
 Overconsumption: Also called affluenza, overconsumption refers to 
the unsustainable use of the planet’s resources. Overconsumption is 
fed by population growth and by the “keeping up with the Joneses” 

22
Book I: Green Living 
mentality that requires buying a constant stream of bigger, newer, better 
products — both of which are a strain to our natural resources.
 
 Depleting the founts of H2O: Water supplies are dwindling because of 
rapid population growth in the developing world and because of the way 
people consume water in many developed areas. It’s essential for people 
to reduce the amount of water that they use every day to ensure that 
enough of this resource remains to support not only the people living on 
the planet but all its ecosystems, too. After all, those ecosystems are at 
the heart of the world’s agricultural production.
 
 Removing links in the food chain: Urban development can reduce 
wildlife abilities to migrate to seasonal feeding grounds, and pesticide 
spraying for agricultural crops can run off into waterways, introducing 
chemicals into the water that kill or harm fish. Even when not directly 
involved in food production, wildlife — from insects to large mammals 
such as elephants — plays a role in the health and regeneration of the 
environment.
 
 Removing even one species can have a negative effect on the entire 
ecosystem. For example, when predators such as wolves are removed 
from the ecosystem or deer-hunting is banned, the populations of deer 
increase well beyond the numbers that the local vegetation can support, 
which in turn leads to the deer starving, or moving into new areas in 
search of food.
Looking Forward: Thinking 
Globally, Acting Locally
Is it possible to stop and then reverse the damage that’s being done to the 
planet?
Considering where the world currently stands in terms of resource depletion 
and greenhouse gas emissions, it’s tempting to think that the situation can’t 
possibly be improved. However, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has taken a 
clear look at where things are and where they’re going, and it believes that, 
in fact, the world has more than enough sustainable energy and technology 
to supply a projected doubling in global demand for energy between now and 
2050 while dropping carbon dioxide emissions by 60 to 80 percent.
The WWF believes that this supply will come from six key solutions:
 
 Improving energy efficiency
 
 Stopping forest loss

23
 Chapter 1: The World’s Gone Green!
Book I
Green 
Living
 
 Accelerating the development of low-emissions technologies
 
 Developing flexible fuels
 
 Replacing high-carbon coal with low-carbon natural gas
 
 Equipping fossil fuel plants with carbon capture and storage technology
Huge gains in environmental progress have been made before — for example, 
the protection of threatened wildlife species, such as the peregrine falcon 
and the bald eagle. However, the citizens of the world need to act quickly 
according to the WWF — in the next five years, in fact! And bringing about 
change and repair will take a combined effort from individuals, businesses, 
and governments. Reversing every effect may not be possible, but people can 
still make a difference.
And your own household is a mighty fine place to start.
 
Living a green life at a very local level really does help to change the world 
on a global level because every positive change that you make has a ripple 
effect. Reducing your energy consumption, for example, means that less 
fossil fuels need to be burned, which means that fewer greenhouse gases 
end up in the atmosphere, which in turn creates less global warming and 
protects more of the environment. Sure, the effect seems minimal when 
you consider the grandiosity of the environmental problems, but as history 
shows, individuals can create great waves of change — you just have to be 
consistent and persistent.
Going green in Güssing
The town of Güssing, Austria is an excellent 
example of the impact of environmental change. 
Güssing has cut its carbon emissions by more 
than 90 percent in the past 15 or so years!
How did they manage that? The town had no 
major industry; most of its residents commuted 
to Vienna to work, and the town was losing its 
population to migration at a quick clip. Its town 
council had trouble paying its electrical bill, so 
it decided that all public buildings in Güssing 
would run on renewable energy instead of fossil 
fuels. Today, energy sources in Güssing include 
the sun, cooking oil, and biofuels, such as saw-
dust and corn; the town generates enough 
power to sell some back to the national grid!
Most industrialized countries are now focus-
ing on reducing or eliminating waste by edu-
cating residents and businesses about how to 
decrease the amount of waste they’re respon-
sible for, how to reuse as much as possible, 
how to recycle what can’t be reused, and 
how to turn household and garden waste into 
compost.

You can make plenty of changes to your own lifestyle right away, thus taking 
care of your own personal responsibility and making an immediate difference 
to your home and community. You also can help people around you adopt a 
similar green approach by participating in community and even international 
initiatives, such as
 
 Volunteering for a community action group that has similar interests to 
you, such as a cyclists’ lobby group or a group representing local con-
servation efforts
 
 Writing letters about topics such as waste reduction, greening the local 
municipality’s vehicle fleet, and alternative energy sources to the edi-
tors of newspapers, magazines, and Web sites, and to your local, state, 
and federal politicians
 
 Getting involved with an international lobby, policy, or research organi-
zation that supports green living
 
 Joining a political party that represents your views and through which 
you think you can have an influence
 
Getting more people involved in actively promoting greener living makes it 
more likely that the politicians responsible for policy-making will take envi-
ronmental issues more seriously. It’s important to make your case tactfully 
and based on science rather than rhetoric, however; otherwise, you’ll do 
more to turn people off green living than on.
Many of the tips in this book are simple ones that you can start immediately 
without making huge changes to your lifestyle. When you take action, you 
help turn the tide and provide hope that the planet can sustain its future gen-
erations — your grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

or many people, trash is “out of sight, out of mind” as soon as it 
leaves their homes. But that’s not the end of trash’s journey; it’s just 
the beginning. The scope of the trash problem worldwide involves more 
than just the volume of trash that’s produced. For every item you throw out, 
there’s hidden waste — the raw materials that went into its production and 
the resources such as water and energy that fueled the process, from raw 
materials to finished goods to landfill. And much of that energy comes from 
nonrenewable sources.
The green living ideal is to reduce your trash so much that you produce no 
waste at all; however, achieving that ideal is quite challenging. It’s far more 
practical to focus on reducing your trash as much as you can. Zero waste will 
become more achievable as recycling and packaging practices catch up with 
today’s culture.
Quick and easy ways to reduce your trash all start with what — and how 
much — you buy. When you reduce the amount that you consume, you 
declutter and simplify your life, automatically reducing the amount of 
trash that you generate (and maybe even reducing your stress level as well). 
For those things you can’t reduce, reusing and recycling remain the key to 
dealing with waste. This chapter discusses ways of incorporating all three Rs 
into your daily life and adds a couple more, including repairing and regifting, 
plus a C for composting to help you reach your trash-reduction goals.

26
Book I: Green Living 
Cutting Back Consumption 
and Aiming for Zero Waste
The best way to reduce waste is to reduce what you buy. Bring into your 
home only what you really need and know that you’ll use — whether it’s 
food, clothes, or electrical appliances. Bringing in less not only reduces the 
items you eventually have to dispose of but reduces their associated packag-
ing, which is where much of your waste likely originates.
Buy less
Living a simpler lifestyle isn’t about doing without or cutting out the things 
you truly enjoy. It’s about knowing the difference between what you “need” 
and what you “want.” It’s also about prioritizing — looking at your days and 
deciding what’s really important to you so that you can make better decisions 
about how you spend your money. In this way, being careful about what you 
bring into the house has more benefits than just reducing the trash that you 
produce: It also can help to simplify your life and reduce your stress level.
 
Some experts suggest keeping a journal of everything that you buy for a 
month or even a week. When you review the journal, you may see patterns 
of spending emerge that you weren’t even aware of. Perhaps you bring home 
convenience or takeout food more often than you realize, or maybe you make 
up for a tough day at work by buying yourself a “treat,” such as a new piece 
of clothing for your closet. Simply recognizing these patterns may be enough 
to help you break out of them; the next time you’re tempted by the fast food 
drive-through or the mall, think twice and keep going instead of stopping and 
shopping.
Another way to scale back your purchases is to opt for good quality items 
over mediocre quality ones. From the kitchen cupboards to the bedroom 
closet, buying fewer items of good quality keeps your spending in check and 
doesn’t overwhelm your storage space. It also ensures that you’re not 
throwing out items because they’ve worn out prematurely.
Be mindful of packaging
Keep in mind that the packaging of items you do buy is another important 
part of reducing excess. In an age where you seem to have less time and 
you’re lucky just to get to the grocery store so that you can prepare your 
meals at home, you certainly don’t have time to think about what happens to 
the packaging that’s left over or whether you can recycle it. The good news, 

27

Living
though, is that choosing products with minimal or recyclable packaging is 
easy to do without much inconvenience; you can incorporate this awareness 
seamlessly into your shopping habits with just a little assessment work on 
the front end.
Evaluating your output
Take a look at a week’s worth of your trash in order to evaluate your output:
 
 Assess how much is coming from typical sources, such as packaging, 
food waste, and paper (such as junk mail). You may want to keep track 
of your trash in separate garbage bags for the week: food scraps in one 
bag, paper trash in one, packaging in another, and so on. Sorting makes 
it easy to see what’s generating the biggest volume of trash.
 
 If you’re not already recycling or composting, make a list of all the 
items in your trash that you could recycle or compost. Imagine how 
that would reduce your weekly trash. Chapter 2 of Book VI gives you 
details about composting.
 
 Take a look at what’s left — the unrecyclable items. This category is a 
great place to start considering measures to reduce this type of trash by 
not purchasing or producing it in the first place.
 
Prioritize your strategies so that you tackle the biggest unrecyclable source 
of your waste first — you don’t have to reduce everything all at once. Take 
small, easy steps to get yourself started on a sustainable path.
Adjusting your purchases accordingly
The general guideline for minimizing your trash (other than buying less) is to 
buy items with either the least possible packaging or recyclable packaging. 
You also can shop at stores that sell loose items or use refillable containers. 
Shopping around for the least wasteful packaging takes some time, but you’ll 
immediately see a difference in the amount of trash you throw away.
Here are some general tips to guide you around the grocery store, where 
most packaging trash comes from:
 
 Buy fresh food that doesn’t come prepackaged. Place fruits and veg-
etables directly into your cart — skip the plastic bags hanging in the 
produce department. Or reuse bags from a previous shopping trip.
 
 Avoid individually packaged items. For example, buy a larger container 
of juice and send the kids to school with juice in a thermos instead of 
those small, individual juice containers.
 
 Opt for items in glass or other recyclable containers instead of plastic 
containers that can’t be recycled. Basically, try to avoid any plastic that 
can’t be recycled through your local system. (See the “Recycling” section, 
later in this chapter, for more information on recycling plastics.)

28
Book I: Green Living 
 
 Avoid aerosol cans altogether if at all possible because you can’t reuse 
or recycle them. For cleaning and toiletry products, purchase products 
in pump-action bottles, for example.
 
 Take your own canvas bags, shopping basket, or reused bags with 
you when you shop so that you don’t load up on more plastic or paper 
bags. If you must choose between paper and plastic bags, choose paper, 
which can be composted, reused, or recycled. But try hard to remember 
to bring your own bags — paper and plastic bags demand a heckuva lot 
of energy.
 
Take your attack on product packaging one step further by sending packag-
ing back to manufacturers with a letter telling them why you won’t be buying 
their products again. Stores and manufacturers will get the message if sales 
drop for heavily packaged items or products in nonrecyclable packaging. 
Help them understand by telling them why you’re buying the competition’s 
product instead.
 
All packaging isn’t necessarily bad, even if it’s not recyclable (although, obvi-
ously, it’s far better if it can be recycled). It may protect goods so that they 
can be transported without damage, thus reducing waste. Packaging also 
may maximize the amount of a particular product that can be packed into 
a container, such as a large box; if fewer containers need to be used for the 
same amount of goods, fewer trucks are needed to transport an order, thus 
decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Manufacturers may be thinking pri-
marily of how to cut their transport and damage costs, but they’re still being 
greener as a result of minimizing packaging.
Lengthening the Life of Your Possessions
Cutting back on consumption is an important part of waste reduction, and 
if you’re able to hold on longer to the possessions you already have, you 
reduce even further your need to buy new items and get rid of the old ones. 
Not only does this practice reduce your waste, but it also saves you money, 
which is always a good thing! In this section, we take a look at how reusing 
and repurposing items can give them a new and longer life at very little envi-
ronmental cost.
 
If you can’t reuse something directly, recycling is your next best option 
because it turns the item into something that’s once again usable. This con-
version costs energy, but it’s still better than throwing out the item.

29
 Chapter 2: Reducing, Reusing, and Recycling
Book I
Green 
Living
Reusing and repurposing
Sometimes you can’t reuse items in the same way you’ve been using them 
because they’re too worn out for that purpose; in these situations, find a new 
purpose for that item, adapting it however you need to.
Reusing sits above recycling in the hierarchy of the three Rs because it 
doesn’t require any extra energy for reprocessing and because it cuts down 
on the need to buy new. The aim is to use items for as long as possible, for 
as many different uses as possible, or by as many people as possible, before 
they have to be recycled or disposed of in the trash.
 
Most things have more than one use. Here are some ideas to get you thinking 
creatively about how to reuse or repurpose things that you own:
 
 Reuse paper that has been used only on one side. Put the other side 
through your printer again for rough drafts, use it for notepaper, or give 
it to your children to use as drawing paper.
 
 Wash plastic food storage bags instead of discarding them. Use hot 
soapy water to get them clean, but don’t reuse bags that have been in 
contact with raw or cooked meat.
 
 Use empty glass jars as containers in your workshop or as organizers 
at your desk or elsewhere. If you drill holes in the lids and screw them 
to the underside of a shelf, you can attach the jars to the lids to reduce 
clutter on your work surface.
 
 Use wrapping paper and gift bags again and cut down cards to make 
gift tags. Fold gift paper and bags carefully so that they store easily and 
live to wrap again. Make a wonderful joke or legacy card among your 
family members and friends by reusing the same birthday card over and 
over and simply encouraging everyone to keep passing it on to the next 
person who has a birthday — no apologies, just cross out the last giver’s 
name and add on your own best wishes for many happy returns . . . and 
returns and returns.
 
 Alter clothes and cultivate your own vintage look by contributing to 
and shopping at secondhand clothing boutiques. Want more ideas for 
what to do with clothing? Check out Reconstructing Clothes For Dummies 
(Wiley), by Miranda Caroligne Burns.
 
 Repair damaged items. Try repairing an item rather than throwing it away 
and buying a new one. If it’s not worth repairing the item — especially with 
electrical items, where safety is an issue — decide whether it really needs 
replacing. Life may be too short to darn a sock, but a chair with a broken 
leg or ripped upholstery, a defunct kettle, or a temperamental toaster may 
have years of life left with a bit of tender loving repair.

30
Book I: Green Living 
 
 If you can’t repair things yourself, find someone who can: Furniture 
restoration businesses, clothing alteration and repair services, shoe 
repairers, upholsterers, electronic appliances repair firms, and even toy 
hospitals can give your items a new lease on life.
 
 Turn small plastic containers into garden pest traps. Set the plastic 
container into the ground and fill it with beer to create a baited trap for 
harmful pests such as slugs.
 
 Cut old, worn clothing into rags for cleaning, dusting, or washing 
vehicles. Chapter 2 of Book III gives you details about what fabrics work 
best for which cleaning jobs.
 
 Turn old pantyhose into plant supports for the garden. Simply cut off 
the legs, loop them around plant stems or branches, and then tie them 
off to stakes.
 
 Use wine corks to create a corkboard. Check out the CraftersLoveCrafts 
site, www.crafterslovecrafts.com/wine-cork-crafts.html, for 
instructions as well as many other ideas for using old corks.
 
 Cut down a king-size sheet that’s worn in the middle into a single-size 
sheet or a few crib sheets.
Recycling
If all else fails (meaning that you can’t reuse or repurpose items), recycle. 
Recycling involves collecting goods that have reached the end of their lives 
and processing them, their parts, or some of their parts, into the raw materi-
als from which new goods are made.
Ever wonder just how green recycling is compared to producing new goods 
from scratch? Consider this fact: Recycling steel, aluminum, copper, lead, 
paper, and plastics can save up to 95 percent of the energy it takes to pro-
duce new goods from these materials.
 
Recycling doesn’t just help reduce the amount of trash that heads to land-
fills and incinerators: It also reduces the amount of greenhouse gases that 
are released into the atmosphere. Although the recycling process consumes 
energy and therefore emits some greenhouse gases, those gases are still less 
than what would be emitted by a combination of machinery at landfills and 
incinerators and by the manufacturing processes used to create new goods 
that would be needed if the recycled goods weren’t created. According to the 
EPA, in 2005, recycling prevented the release of 79 million tons of carbon into 
the air — about the same as would be produced annually by 39 million cars.

greenhouse gases), you should try to reduce and reuse first and foremost. 
Glass can be recycled into bottles, for example, but it has to go through a 
manufacturing process to get there, and that process uses energy. In an ideal 
world, the energy would be generated using renewable sources such as wind, 
hydro, and solar power so that the recycling process is completely green, but 
in the real world, that’s not usually how it works.
Despite the drawbacks, recycling an item is far better than throwing it in the 
trash. And as states and cities increasingly develop and encourage waste-
reduction strategies, recycling will become an even more important part of 
daily life.
Identifying what you can recycle
Not everything can be recycled (yet), but you should be able to put out at the 
curb or find recycling dropoff facilities for these six main categories of house-
hold waste:
 
 Paper: Most paper is recyclable, including newspapers, cardboard, 
phone books, packaging, magazines, catalogs, and wrapping paper. If 
you have a garden, you also can turn most paper into compost; turn to 
Chapter 2 of Book VI for composting instructions.
 
 Some recycling facilities and pickup services take paper products, 
such as milk and juice cartons; others don’t. These cartons are made of 
cardboard sandwiched between very thin layers of plastic, so not all the 
material is recyclable. Check with your local recycling facility or service 
provider before you haul your waste for drop off.
 
 Plastics: Most plastics are recyclable, but recycling rates for plastic 
tend to be low because of a lack of facilities. Each plastic product has a 
Plastic Identification Code — a triangle with the number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
or 7 inside it. The code usually appears on the bottom of the plastic 
product. Most recycling services and dropoff facilities accept plastics 
with codes 1 or 2, which includes beverage bottles and containers used 
for milk, juice, and body-care products. Table 2-1 shares details on the 
Plastic Identification Codes and the products they’re associated with.
 
 Check with your local service provider or dropoff facility about which 
plastics it takes for recycling, and if you can, buy only products in plastics 
with those numbers. If the local provider doesn’t accept plastics, try to 
reduce the plastic that you buy and reuse what you already have.
 
 Glass: Most household glass can be recycled over and over again — you 
usually just need to rinse or wash out food containers and remove paper 
labels. In fact, glass is easier to recycle than plastic, so if your local service 
provider or dropoff facility doesn’t recycle plastic, buy the product you 
need in a glass bottle or jar if one’s available. Recycled glass has a whole 
variety of uses, but mainly it’s used to create new glass containers.

32
Book I: Green Living 
 
 Glass items, such as car windshields, cooking dishes, and light bulbs, 
aren’t usually accepted by local recycling systems. These items may not 
be recyclable in your area, or you may need to take them to a special 
dropoff point. Check with your service provider or local government’s 
waste office to find out whether a special dropoff point is near you. For 
example, compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs aren’t usually accepted 
in local recycling programs. Because CFLs contain a small amount of 
mercury, you need to take them to your local household hazardous waste 
disposal site. Home Depot stores also accept used CFLs for disposal.
 
 Metals: Metal food and drink cans made from aluminum or steel are 
recyclable. With food cans, wash them out first and remove paper 
labels — it’s worth the extra chore. Aluminum cans in particular are very 
valuable in terms of recycling material. You can recycle used aluminum 
foil, too.
 
 Organics: Some recyclers include organic materials, such as yard and 
kitchen waste, in their regular services, whereas others offer seasonal 
organics recycling, such as Christmas tree dropoff locations after the 
holiday season.
 
 Textiles: Many charitable and nonprofit organizations operate dropoff 
points for textiles like clothes and shoes; you usually find these sites 
in supermarket parking lots and in the organizations’ own business 
locations. What the groups can’t use they generally sell to private firms 
dealing in textiles.

Paint isn’t recyclable, but it’s worth a mention in this section because 
some communities offer a central dropoff point for leftover paints. People 
can come and pick up the unwanted paint for free, latex paints may be mixed 
together and reprocessed, and components of oil paints can be reprocessed 
into fuel (or at least disposed of responsibly if this isn’t practical in your 
location). It’s also possible that local organizations, such as Habitat for 
Humanity (www.habitat.org), can use your unwanted paint, so check with 
your city or town to see whether such a service is available.
Creating your recycling system: Compost piles and recycling stations
Turning your organic kitchen and yard waste — paper, vegetable peelings, 
eggshells, grass clippings, and leaves, for example — into new, nutrient-rich 
dirt is the best possible example of recycling success in action. If you have a 
yard, you can build or install a composter in a sunny spot; if you don’t have the 
space and your local recycling options don’t include organic waste, consider 
setting up a worm farm indoors to handle the compostable materials. For more 
information about how to compost, check out Chapter 2 of Book VI.
For those items you can’t compost, you can create a recycling station in your 
home no matter how little room you have to devote to it. Essentially, you set 
aside a space where you can collect and store your recyclables until it’s time 
for pick up or drop off.
A garage is the perfect place for a recycling station. To save space, install shelves 
on the wall, one above the other, that will each hold one recycling bin. You 
can buy brackets and wood or ready-made shelves from local building centers 
or organizing stores; you also can purchase bins to hold your recyclables. If 
your recyclables need to be separated, label the bins and allow enough space 
between them to throw in the recyclable items.
For smaller spaces, especially apartments, check under your kitchen sink. 
You may already have a trash can there, so it’s the ideal spot to add another 
trash can (or even two or three) for your recyclables. You can buy commercial 

34
Book I: Green Living 
products, such as pull-out trays, to make the bins easily accessible, or you can 
rig up your own tray that slides out. If you don’t have enough room for trash 
cans under your kitchen sink, use paper bags to collect recyclables instead.
 
If you’re really tight on space, buy a can compactor to crush metal cans, 
significantly reducing the space they occupy. You mount the compactor on 
a wall or sturdy, vertical surface, such as a wood shelf frame. You can crush 
milk and juice cartons without the aid of a compactor.
Finding places to drop off recyclables
Many local governments have well-established recycling programs that pro-
vide either curbside pickup at your home or operate neighborhood dropoff 
points. You may be asked to put all your material for recycling — bottles, 
food and beverage cans, paper, newspapers and magazines, cardboard, and 
recyclable plastics — into one box separate from the rest of your household 
trash. Or you may be asked to separate each type of recyclable material into 
different boxes for collection.
If your community doesn’t offer government-sponsored services, keep an eye 
out for school recycling drives and look for commercial businesses in your 
area that offer weekly recycling pickup. There’s likely to be a fee involved, 
but it’s worth it to divert waste that would otherwise end up in the trash. 
Increasingly, stores also are offering recycling services as a response to 
customer demand. The office-supply store Staples, for example, lets you 
drop off used rechargeable batteries, empty printer ink cartridges, and even 
unwanted electronics such as televisions and computers, and most Ikea 
stores accept batteries and CFLs for disposal.
 
To find recycling resources in your community, check with your local 
government. Earth 911 (earth911.org) and the National Recycling Coalition 
(www.nrc-recycle.org) also can help. Of course, if your state has instituted 
a refundable deposit on certain containers (such as plastic beverage bottles), 
there’s likely to be plenty of local bottle depots where you can drop off the 
items and claim your money.
If your municipality or county doesn’t already tackle waste reduction, write 
to local politicians or representatives asking them to put the issue on their 
agendas. You can find more information about zero waste initiatives at Zero 
Waste America (www.zerowasteamerica.org) and Eco-Cycle (www.eco
cycle.org).
 
To make recycling as easy as possible — and to prevent it from becoming 
an overwhelming task — set up a home recycling center that works for your 
family. If you need to drive somewhere to drop off the recycling, plan to stop 
by the recycling center on your way to another destination. That way, you’re 
not making a special trip, which costs you extra time, fuel, and greenhouse 
gas emissions.

Turning Your Garbage into 
Someone Else’s Gold
If you can’t reuse something, you don’t know anyone who wants it, and you 
can’t recycle it, you may still have alternatives to throwing it out. You can 
give things away or sell them if you have access to potential customers.
 
If you can’t reuse something, someone else may be able to.
Deciding what others may want
Walk around your home and pick out things that you don’t need but that 
other people could use. If you have room, create a storage system that allows 
you to add an item to the “find a new home for this” box when you’re done 
with it. When a box is full, offer it to your local secondhand book or music 
shop; if you don’t get a sale, offer it to a local charity or nonprofit.
Some of the most popular secondhand items include
 
 Books, magazines, CDs, and DVDs: The market for these items is huge, 
and they can go on and on being reused.
 
 Clothes: Used and vintage clothes are fashionable, and someone else 
may be able to make good use of good-quality clothing even though you 
never want to wear it — or see it — again. Sift through your wardrobe 
and drawers and sort out things to give away, swap, sell, or turn into 
rags. If your items are fashionable or desirable, check out the later 
section “Cashing in on unwanted items.”
 
 Furniture: Whether it’s old or relatively new, valuable or not, in good 
shape or has seen better days, furniture that you want to get rid of will 
find a home with someone out there. All sorts of home clearance firms 
buy furniture; auctions sell antiques and less valuable furniture and 
household items; and charities often want furniture of all sorts to help 
furnish homes for those less fortunate.
 
 Electronics such as computers, appliances, and cell phones: Other 
people may be able to get electronics in running order either for 
themselves or for charity.
 
 Household items such as dishes, knickknacks, and storage containers: 
If these items are in reasonably good shape (not chipped or cracked, 
for example), there’s no reason why they can’t be used by someone else 
who may find their patterns more attractive than you do. Charity stores 
often accept such household items.

Book I: Green Living 
Giving away your goods
Giving things away may appeal to your green nature more than selling your 
unwanted items. In terms of being green, offering your used goods to another 
person reduces waste and fits in with the idea of reusing as much as possible. 
Try charitable and nonprofit organizations, private waste collectors, scrap 
metal dealers, friends, family, and work colleagues.
Contributing to sweet charity
If you’re interested in giving things away to people who have more need for 
them than you do, you can donate just about anything.
 
Make sure that anything you give is in good condition, usable, and clean and 
that won’t create a problem for the person receiving it. Too many people 
dump unwanted, dirty, or broken items on the doorsteps of charitable 
organizations, thus also dumping the expense of disposing of the items.
Tips for selling online
Selling items online can seem a little intimidat-
ing if you’ve never done it, but if you take the 
time to read the Web site’s instructions and 
carefully do a little research, it’s not at all dif-
ficult. Here are a few tips to help you maximize 
your sale price:
  Check out similar items on the Internet to 
compare prices. Potential buyers are likely 
to find items similar to yours, so do some 
research and price your items competitively. 
You can sell just about anything through the 
Internet, so if you get little response from 
would-be buyers, there’s either no demand 
for your used goods or you’ve priced them 
too high. Try dropping the price before you 
give up completely.
  Be sure that you’re dealing with a well-
known, established, reputable site. The 
credibility and security of the site you 
choose is absolutely critical to ensure that 
your transaction goes smoothly and every-
one comes out satisfied. With auction sites 
such as eBay, the more you buy and sell 
successfully on the site, the better reputa-
tion you’ll get within that site’s community. 
If you sell on eBay, for example, everyone 
who buys on the site has access to your 
past buying and selling history (and vice 
versa) thanks to eBay’s community ranking 
system. This feedback system has greatly 
reduced the chances of being sold a dud 
product or not receiving payment for an 
item you sell. For more tips on selling on 
eBay, check out eBay For Dummies (Wiley), 
by Marsha Collier.
  Be alert to the possibility that all may not be 
as it appears. When dealing with Internet 
sales sites, you generally have very little 
protection if you send goods and the money 
doesn’t arrive or if you send money and the 
goods don’t arrive. Internet sales are based 
on trust. You can find consumer protection 
information pertaining to online sales on the 
Web site of the Better Business Bureau at 
www.bbb.org.

Following are a few organizations that accept household or clothing items:
 
 Habitat for Humanity (www.habitat.org) accepts tools, building 
materials, furniture, and appliances in good working order, either for 
use in homes being built or for resale to the public in order to help raise 
funds. The organization also accepts vehicle donations!
 
 Lion’s Clubs International (www.lionsclubs.org) conducts eyeglass 
recycling, collecting used eyeglasses at a number of eyewear chain 
stores and redistributing them in developing countries.
 
 Nike Re-Use a Shoe (www.letmeplay.com/reuseashoe) collects 
worn-out athletic shoes of any brand and processes them into material 
that’s used for sports surfaces, such as playgrounds for youth around 
the world.
 
 The Salvation Army (www.salvationarmyusa.org) operates local 
centers that accept household and clothing items for resale.
 
 Goodwill Industries International (www.goodwill.org) has local stores 
that welcome donations of clothing and household items for resale.
 
 Hands Across the Water (www.surplusbooksforcharity.org) 
collects unwanted books and sends them to schools and libraries that 
need them around the world.
 
Facilities such as hospitals, libraries, senior and rehabilitation centers, daycares, 
homeless shelters, and churches in your area may be able to use various items 
that you’re ready to donate. Search online or check the phone book under “recy-
cling” or “charitable organizations” to find them. Contact each organization to 
find out what it really wants and to make sure that it can handle the items that 
you have to offer. Some may even offer to pick up your items.
Trading goods online
The Freecycle Network (www.freecycle.org) was one of the first Web 
sites to offer members a way of giving unwanted possessions away for free to 
other members who would make good use of them. This program takes the 
principles of reducing, reusing, and recycling into cyberspace. Community 
members who want to find a new home for something, whether it be a chair, 
a fax machine, or a piano, send an e-mail offering it to local members, who 
then respond by e-mail. The rule is that everything offered must be free, 
legal, and appropriate for all ages. Membership in Freecycle is free.
Sharing Is Giving (www.sharingisgiving.org) is a site with a similar 
purpose, acting as a one-stop source for all free-transfer Web sites.
Regifting
Regifting — giving a gift you’ve received to someone else as a gift — isn’t for 
everyone; in fact, some consider it quite rude. It’s up to you to assess the 
potential consequences; for example, it may not be the wisest idea to regift 

38
Book I: Green Living 
the birthday present your parents gave you. And it’s definitely not a good 
idea to regift an item if there’s a chance that either the new recipient or the 
original giver may find out and be offended.
It’s not usually acceptable to regift an item that’s used rather than new. 
On the other hand, regifting something that’s important to you and thus 
sharing its value with the recipient is actually quite generous and thoughtful. 
Perhaps you have a painting or a book that has always given you inspiration 
or encouragement during a difficult time and you want to regift it to someone 
you love who’s now facing their own difficult time.
In the right circumstances, regifting offers these significant advantages:
 
 You aren’t buying new goods. You’re subscribing to the principle of 
reducing waste and thus reducing the amount of energy used to produce 
new products.
 
 You’re reusing something. You’re giving something to someone who 
will make use of it, therefore keeping the item out of a landfill site.
 
 You’re eliminating the need to recycle the item. You’re saving the 
energy required to reprocess the item.
Cashing in on unwanted items
Buying and selling secondhand goods is a hobby for some people, a busi-
ness for others, and an occasional pastime for the rest. If you like to hunt for 
secondhand treasures, or if you have something to sell, you have plenty of 
choices. The only limiting factors are how much someone is willing to pay 
and whether it’s economically viable and green to have the item mailed or 
delivered to that person’s home. If something has to be transported by road 
or air for long distances, you should consider the carbon emissions that the 
journey can produce. (See Chapter 1 of this book.)
Here are the more common places where you can trade in or sell items for cash:
 
 Pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers are much more sophisticated 
than they used to be, and they abound in most areas.
 
 Secondhand book and music shops are very popular. Trade in your 
unwanted books and CDs for others in the store, sell them for cash, or 
leave them on a consignment basis (that is, you leave them in the shop 
for a certain amount of time, and if they don’t sell, you get them back).
 
 Antique shops are an option for some items. You may be quite sur-
prised at how much you can get for that old painting that’s been sitting 
in the attic for years.

39

 Auction houses generally sell antiques, jewelry, used cars, unwanted 
office and household furniture, and larger household items. You can set 
a reserve amount on an item you want to sell and take it home again if it 
doesn’t make that much.
 
 Classified ads in the local weekly newspaper or the free advertising 
papers were the places for advertising your goods or picking up a used 
bargain long before the Internet, and they’re still going strong.
 
 Garage sales are perfect for selling a lot of unwanted stuff, especially if 
it’s too big or you have too much to sell to a secondhand store. Set up a 
sale in your front yard or garage. Find out whether your neighborhood 
organizes an annual sale and participate in order to tap into neighbor-
hood sale advertising. If you live in an apartment or condominium, the 
owner or condo board of directors may support a community sale — 
check to find out.
 
 Phone your local city or county government or check its Web site to see 
whether you need any permits to hold a garage sale. Rules may be in 
place about the items you sell, especially food, and about permitted sig-
nage or hours of operation.
 
 Online, you’re more likely to get a better price for your goods on the 
Internet than in your local secondhand store or through a garage sale, 
and you may be able to find buyers online for unusual or hard-to-sell 
items that other places won’t take. In fact, the success of Internet sales 
sites has shown that selling things that you no longer need can be quite 
profitable. Of course, if you list an item that doesn’t sell, you’re out the 
money that you spent to list it.
 
 You’ll find two types of Internet sales stores:
 
• Auction sites, such as eBay (www.ebay.com) and uBid (www.
ubid.com) where sellers place items for sale and buyers bid on 
the items up to a closing date and time. The highest bid wins the 
item.
 
• Classified advertising sites, such as Craig’s List (www.craigs
list.com) and Kijiji (www.kijiji.com) where sellers simply 
advertise items for sale. Buyers contact the sellers directly if 
they’re interested in the items.
 
The success of eBay has led to services that help you sell items on the popu-
lar Web site. I Sold It (www.i-soldit.com), for example, has outlets in many 
U.S. cities where you can drop off an item you’d like to sell; service people at 
the I Sold It location take care of listing the item on eBay and managing pay-
ment from the eventual auction winner. The service is expensive compared 
to listing the item online yourself, which costs just a few dollars; I Sold It 
outlets charge varying commissions on top of eBay’s fees — typically in the 
range of 35 percent of the first $500 of the sale price and 20 percent on the 
amount above $500.

Disposing of Electronic Goods
As electronic goods, such as televisions, computers, cellphones, and com-
puter-driven toys, as well as automobiles, assume a more prominent posi-
tion in your home and daily life, they also contribute more to your home’s 
waste. The pace of technology development means that many items that are 
even a few years old are difficult to reuse, so recycling them has become an 
essential issue. In 2005, approximately 2 million tons of electronic products 
were discarded in the United States, and the vast majority of the items went 
straight into the trash.
Not only does the fast pace of the technology industry represent huge losses 
of reuse potential for many electronic items, it also creates a toxic waste 
issue because of the components in many of these products. Electronics such 
as computer monitors, cellphones, and televisions can contain toxic materi-
als, such as lead, chromium, cadmium, mercury, and brominated flame retar-
dants. The health of the environment depends on the safe disposal of these 
components. Thankfully, opportunities for reusing and recycling electronic 
goods are growing significantly.
 
The related issues of waste reduction and hazardous waste management 
have prompted several state governments — including those in California, 
Maine, Maryland, and Washington — to introduce mandatory electronics 
recycling programs. Most of these mandates place the responsibility on elec-
tronics manufacturers to create recycling programs, with some instituting a 
recycling fee that’s passed on to consumers at the time of a new electronics 
purchase.
Manufacturers and distributors are putting recycling plans into action, thus 
joining local businesses that offer electronics recycling. Find an electronics 
recycler near you through the National Center for Electronics Recycling at 
www.electronicsrecycling.org.
Leveling the cellphone mountain
The EPA estimates that up to 130 million cellphones are retired each year, 
which means that a lot of dead phones are sitting around unused in draw-
ers or are headed for the trash. Because cellphones contain toxic materials 
such as mercury, it’s important to keep them out of landfills and incinerators. 
More importantly, however, your old cellphone may just turn out to be some-
one’s lifeline.

41
 Chapter 2: Reducing, Reusing, and Recycling
Book I
Green 
Living
Several organizations reprogram retired cellphones so that they can be used 
free of charge by people, particularly seniors or victims of domestic abuse, to 
call 911. Other organizations reprogram and sell the phones to raise funds for 
charity. The following organizations operate such programs:
 
 Collective Good (www.collectivegood.com) allows you to mail your 
phone, PDA, or pager in to be recycled.
 
 Phones 4 Charity (www.phones4charity.org) donates or recycles 
your cellphone or similar device.
 
 Wirefly (www.wirefly.org) offers a trade-in incentive to encourage 
consumers to recycle wireless devices.
You also can check with your cellphone service provider about a recycling 
program; many providers collect old phones to reuse parts and to donate to 
charities.
 
You can do more than recycle cellphones; consider reducing the number 
of cellphones in circulation by turning your service provider down the next 
time you’re offered a new model of phone as a free upgrade. If you prefer 
not to do that, give your old model to a friend or relative who can use it with 
their own SIM card rather than buy a new phone. The same goes for phone 
chargers and batteries — pass them on!
Getting rid of computers
If you’re thinking about upgrading your computer system, either at home 
or at work, consider what to do about your old one. The EPA estimates that 
some 250 million computers will become obsolete in the next five years, 
which has the potential for a lot of waste. You do have options for reuse and 
recycling, however: Computers can be donated for reuse by facilities such as 
schools and charities, or if computers are too old to be useful, they can go to 
a responsible electronics recycler to break down their components for reuse, 
recycling, and safe disposal.
Computer refurbishers can upgrade or adapt your unwanted computer so 
that it can be donated to schools, community centers, and even initiatives 
in developing countries to enable more people to gain access to the benefits 
of the information age. To find a computer refurbisher or recycling program 
in your area, check Earth 911 (www.earth911.org; in the Find a Recycling 
Center box at the top of the home page, enter “Computer” and then your zip 
code or city and state) or Tech Soup (www.techsoup.org; click Learning 

42
Book I: Green Living 
Center, then Hardware, and then Ten Tips for Donating a Computer). Some 
computer manufacturers have established computer recycling programs, and 
you can also take computers to Staples stores (www.staples.com/sbd/
content/about/soul/recycling.html), which participate in an elec-
tronics recycling program.
 
Whether you donate your computer for reuse or drop it off for recycling, 
make sure that you protect the personal information that may be on it. 
Computer-savvy criminals can access files that you’ve deleted, so use hard 
drive disk-cleaning software to properly erase your files. Also make sure that 
you deal with a reputable refurbisher or recycler with its own disk-cleaning 
procedures in place as well.
Dealing with old televisions
The same places that recycle computer monitors in your area likely recycle 
televisions, too, because their technology is quite similar. If you can’t find a 
charity or friend who needs your old television, drop it off at your nearest 
electronics recycling center.
You may have heard about the switch from analog to digital broadcast televi-
sion; essentially, after February 17, 2009, all full-power television stations will 
have switched from analog signals to digital. The switch will affect you only 
if you have a television that’s not hooked up to cable or satellite television 
services. If you have a television that receives free signals over the air with 
an antenna, you’ll still be able to use your set, but you’ll need to add a digital-
to-analog converter box for $50 to $70.
Disposing of an older vehicle
If your vehicle can be resold at a reasonable value, then figuring out how to 
get rid of it is easy: Either trade it in when you purchase a new vehicle or sell 
it yourself (which can often get you a better value for it). But what if it’s no 
longer in good enough condition to be sold — perhaps it’s no longer running, 
requires far more repair than it’s worth, or has been in a major accident — and 
you don’t feel right about selling it on to become someone else’s problem?
You may think it’s time for the scrap heap, but that comes with some obvi-
ous issues. Some of the material that goes into a vehicle can be recycled 
or reused (the list of potential items includes liquids, such as oil and gas, 
metal, refrigerants from air-conditioning systems, tires, parts, and even wind-
shields), but other material, including foams and plastics, end up shredded 
and in landfills.

43

Although programs and research are in progress to improve the situation, 
you can help out by checking your local resources to find out whether any 
municipal or state recycling programs will help you get rid of your vehicle. 
The U.S. EPA (www.epa.gov) Web site has a section dedicated to vehicles 
in its Product Stewardship area that lists partners and resources for automo-
tive end-of-life issues, including tire recycling and the removal of mercury 
switches from vehicles before they head to the landfill. You also can lend 
your voice to organizations, such as Environmental Defense Fund (www.edf.

life issues beginning at the manufacturing stage.
 
Up to 11 million vehicles reach the end of their useful lives each year in 
the United States, generating as much as 5 million tons of nonrecyclable 
waste. The U.S. Council on Automotive Research, a joint effort from 
DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors Corporation, is 
working to improve how much can be recycled or reused. Find more informa-
tion at www.uscar.org.
Consider donating your older vehicle to charity: You get a receipt for a tax 
deduction, and the charity sells the car either at auction or perhaps to an 
auto recycler. As with any charity, research your local options and ensure 
that it’s a 501(c)(3) organization that you’re donating to in order to obtain 
the tax deduction. Try to avoid middlemen agencies that accept car dona-
tions and then pass the proceeds on to charities; a better proportion of your 
money actually gets to the charity if it’s the charity itself that runs the dona-
tion program rather than a middleman. Charity Navigator has excellent infor-
mation about car donation programs at www.charitynavigator.org.

hoosing what to eat is one of the most important and difficult green 
decisions you have to make because it’s not just about the environment; 
it’s also about your health. Luckily, the right thing for the planet may also be 
the right thing for your body.
Eating green means knowing where your food comes from, and that involves 
two issues: how the food was produced, and how it got to you (including 
what happened to it along the way). To be sure that your food is as green as 
possible, you need the answers to these questions. Some scientists advise 
that if you were to buy locally produced foodstuff — especially from within 
100 miles of your home — you would do more for the environment than if 
you simply bought organic foods from farther afield. Most significantly, you’d 
save all the greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation of the foods 
from those distant places.
The packaging your food comes in is also a green issue. Even if the food is 
organically produced, if it travels any distance to get to you, it usually needs 
packaging to protect it. Whether that packaging is recyclable or not, it would 
be greener if the packaging weren’t needed at all (which it often isn’t for 
locally produced food) because it takes energy to produce the packaging and 
then to either recycle or dispose of it.
Many factors are important when it comes to making decisions about what you 
buy and eat. This chapter shows you how to make practical, cost-conscious 
decisions that improve your green eating habits.

The Big Question: Is Vegetarianism 
Essential for Green Living?
People become vegetarians, meaning that they don’t eat meat, and even 
vegans, meaning that they eschew meat, dairy, and other animal products, 
for health reasons, philosophical reasons, or both. When you ask people why 
they choose to be vegetarians, you often find that they’re protesting the meat 
industry’s production methods. Others give up meat in favor of vegetarianism 
because they’re alarmed by the health issues. Still others are concerned about 
the resources that go into the production of meat. Grain-feeding animals in 
a factory farm uses up a lot of resources — gasoline for tractors to plant the 
stuff, power for lighting and machinery, water to flush away effluent — and in 
many cases relies on fertilizer and pesticides. Even though many farmers keep 
their cattle and sheep out in the fields, their diets often are supplemented with 
grain at times when there’s not enough grass.
Researchers now use the word foodprint to indicate the amount of land that 
various diets require to sustain them; the idea is linked closely with the idea 
of a person’s ecological footprint (see Chapter 1 of this book). The diet foot-
print is a handy way to visualize the environmental impact of your diet; the 
bottom line is that a more sustainable diet requires less land per person. The 
popular notion is that a meat-free diet uses the least land per person and is 
thus the greenest, most sustainable way of eating. This reasoning is in part 
because animals consume feed grown on land that can otherwise be used to 
grow vegetable or fruit crops for humans.
However, researchers at Cornell University recently added a new twist to this 
argument when they explained that, depending on the specific type of land 
that surrounds you, a diet that contains a small amount of meat and dairy 
actually can be more efficient than a straight vegetarian diet. That’s because 
vegetarian crops require higher quality land than the pasture land that ani-
mals need. So if your geographic area and climate offer more pasture land 
than crop land, eating a small amount of meat can be more efficient. (The 
Cornell researchers suggested an annual meat and egg intake that averaged 
approximately 2 cooked ounces per day.)
 
The argument over the greenest use of land for food, which is particularly 
applicable given the current emphasis on eating local food in order to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, demonstrates why green issues are rarely black 
and white and why one solution doesn’t necessarily fit all situations. So if you 
lust for a lamb shank and pine for a pork chop, you can still pursue a green 
eating strategy. Meat can be, and is, produced in the same organic and sus-
tainable way that many fruits and vegetables are farmed. You can cut down 
your impact on the planet’s resources by reducing the amount of meat you 
eat and choosing green meat whenever possible.

Choosing Your Food Source Wisely
Despite all the arguments about what food is best in terms of health, there’s 
agreement from an environmental point of view that buying local food is 
best. At the heart of all the arguments for eating locally grown produce is the 
need to cut down on what have become known as food miles, the distance 
food travels from where it’s produced to your plate. Transportation over 
what can be thousands of miles results in a lot of carbon emissions. The food 
Americans eat travels an average of 1,500 miles before it gets to the plate. 
In addition, food that travels a long distance and spends time in storage has 
fewer nutrients than locally produced food.
However, sometimes buying locally isn’t an option, particularly when you’re 
talking about foods that aren’t grown in the United States. Enter Fairtrade, a 
trade program that works to make sure that
 
 Producers in the developing world get fair prices for what they produce.
 
 Producers have reasonable working conditions.
 
 The processes used in the developing world are sustainable.
Buying Fairtrade items raises the issue of how far the food has traveled to get 
to you. Is it “greener” to buy the Fairtrade item that may have been transported 
from the other side of the world but that supports the developing world, or the 
local item that isn’t benefiting the developing world’s economy but that contrib-
uted far fewer greenhouse gases to the atmosphere? A green lifestyle has room 
for both: Buy local when you can, and buy Fairtrade when you can’t buy local.
Your best bet: Buying locally
Food that flies thousands of miles from other countries is just part of the 
food miles problem. Even American produce can travel many hundreds of 
miles before it gets to your plate. Retailers buy from producers and often 
transport the food over the road to big packaging plants, to huge storage 
facilities, to distribution centers, and finally to the stores from which you 
drive it home. To cut down on those miles, you have to buy locally.
From locally owned and operated grocery stores
Because of concerns for animal welfare, and because eating food produced 
using pesticides and other chemicals may cause health problems, the 
demand for organic food has increased to such an extent that big businesses 
are interested in its money-making potential. Most people have limited time 
to shop, so large grocery stores are the convenient option. They enable you 
to get everything under one roof and do a big shop every once in a while, 
reducing the miles you travel to get groceries.

48
Book I: Green Living 
Keep in mind, though, that many large grocery stores tend to treat food 
grown throughout the United States as if it’s locally produced. Even if a cow 
starts its life in a farm just one mile away from you, the meat will travel to 
storage and distribution centers miles from home and will have traveled a 
large distance before it gets back to your grocery store. Big businesses have 
greater buying power than small competitors, but they also transport food 
farther to storage and distribution facilities, increasing factory and transport 
emissions and reducing the nutritional value of the stored food. Also take 
into account the impact that big business has on local business, particularly 
small, locally owned specialty grocery stores and farmers’ markets.
 
Take a careful look at where you shop. If your nearby chain grocery store 
brings in as much local and organic produce as possible, then by all means 
support it. But if it doesn’t, then look for other options. The larger stores’ 
buying power may translate into lower food costs on the shelves, but do 
what you can — within your budget — to purchase more locally and/or 
organically produced food.
If you’re unable to buy food from a farmers’ market or directly from a local 
farmer, head for smaller specialty stores and co-ops, many of which sell 
organic and/or local products.
 
Co-ops are exactly what they sound like: cooperative organizations in which 
people come together as members to take advantage of the buying power 
that results from being more than just one individual or one family. Members 
usually pool money in some way and thus become member-owners of the 
organization, with a say in how it runs and a share in dividends if any money 
is left over at the end of the year. Co-ops can be informal, such as when sev-
eral families pool funds in order to buy from a co-op food warehouse, or they 
can be more formal with hundreds or even thousands of members. When it 
comes to food, many have a mandate to support local, organic, or natural 
food producers. You can find co-ops throughout the country through the 
Coop Directory Service at www.coopdirectory.org.
Some local shops or co-ops may sell only organically produced and labeled 
food; others combine organic food with health food, vitamin and mineral sup-
plies, and other well-being and fitness-related products. These kinds of stores 
are popping up everywhere and are increasingly moving into many large 
shopping centers thanks to the demand for organic food products.
Wherever you shop, check with the store to see how local “local” is. The dis-
tance that experts consider local varies — some say 12 miles; some say 100; 
some say within your own watershed or climatic region. Decide for yourself 
what’s practical given your geographic location. (If a label says “locally grown,” 
it generally indicates something within 250 miles.) If you live in the northern 
part of the country, of course, buying local agricultural products during the 
winter is very difficult; in that case, “local” may mean produce grown within the 
United States in winter but produce grown much closer to home in summer. 
Local definitely does not mean buying strawberries from Chile in December.

At local farmers’ markets
Farmers’ markets have increased in popularity in the past few years. That’s 
great news for people who love to eat locally grown food and support local 
food growers and producers. Farmers’ markets may be open one or two days 
a week during the growing season, or they may operate year-round. They 
cater to people who are interested in buying fresh, local, and sometimes 
organic produce.
At most farmers’ markets, you can talk to the growers about their produce — 
they’re usually passionate about the subject — so that you know exactly what 
you’re buying and eating. You can find details of local farmers’ markets at 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Web site (www.ams.usda.gov/
farmersmarkets/map.htm). If you don’t find a market in your town or city 
listed on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Web site, inquire with 
Local Harvest (www.localharvest.org).
 
Not all the produce at a farmers’ market is certified organic. Some growers 
use conventional growing methods, some may go through the certifica-
tion process to convert to organic (see the later section “Getting a Grip on 
Organic”), and others simply may be keen vegetable gardeners with green 
fingers.
Straight from a local farm
If you don’t have a local farmers’ market, you may be able to hook up with a 
farm not too far away from you that sells its produce straight from the farm or 
has its own farm store. Even if you live right in the middle of a city, you may 
find that farmers set up shop temporarily and sell produce straight off their 
own trucks. (Some farmers even deliver to established regular customers.)
 
Local Harvest (www.localharvest.org) has lists of family farms and other 
sources of sustainably grown food. In addition, many state government agri-
cultural departments maintain lists of such farms.
Canning bottled water
Americans are drinking an ever-increasing 
amount of bottled water — some 27 gallons 
per person last year, in fact. The environmental 
resources involved in bottled water are stag-
gering: Energy is required to produce the plas-
tic bottles, tap the water source, fill the bottles, 
possibly add carbonation or flavoring, transport 
the bottles to the consumer, and finally dispose 
of or recycle the plastic bottles.
The water inside the bottles isn’t necessarily 
healthier than the water coming out of your tap. 
You can reduce your water miles significantly 
by minimizing your purchase of bottled water 
and instead choosing a refillable and washable 
container that you can fill from the tap. If you’re 
concerned about the taste or quality of tap 
water, consider installing a tap-mounted water 
filter or using a water filtration pitcher.

50
Book I: Green Living 
The produce from a farm store may be somewhat more expensive because 
the farm doesn’t sell the volume of produce that allows it to cut prices. If you 
have to drive there and back, you also have to think about the fuel you’re 
using and the impact of your transportation on the environment. However, 
if you can combine a trip to the farm or farm store with other errands, you 
reduce your environmental impact.
Getting to know local farmers and shopping directly from farms has the 
added advantage of providing a fun day out for the whole family. Farms 
near your home may have pick-your-own operations that offer a variety of 
fruit and vegetables — often strawberries and raspberries, but the selection 
depends on the area, the climate, and the farmer.
 
Look for community supported agriculture (CSAs) services that enable mem-
bers (who buy shares or subscriptions in the CSA or even contribute labor) 
to take part in local farmers’ bounty. Pay the fee, and you get a regular deliv-
ery of seasonal produce. Head to the Local Harvest Web site, www.local
harvest.org, to find a directory of CSAs.
From food-delivery services
Many cities are serviced by companies that deliver fresh fruit and vegetables 
from local growers, with some specializing in organic produce. Depending 
on the company, you may be able to sign up for weekly or occasional (on-
demand) delivery and order exactly what you want so that you know what 
will arrive on your doorstep.
Door to Door Organics (www.doortodoororganics.com) offers organic 
food home deliveries in various communities in several states.
 
To find a food-delivery service in your area, run an Internet search for “food 
delivery service (your town or city).” You may want to add “organic” to the 
search terms.
Finding Fairtrade food
The idea of Fairtrade is that more of the money you pay when you buy an 
item goes to the producers who then can pay their workers better and invest 
more in their businesses. It’s a trading partnership that aims at sustainable 
development for excluded and disadvantaged producers.
In the United States, you can find a range of goods (approximately 300 of 
them, from chocolate to herbs to footballs!) with the Fairtrade logo on 
them, many of which are available at stores near you or via online shopping. 
You can even find coffee shops that distinguish themselves by selling only 
Fairtrade-certified coffee.

51

The Fairtrade program aims to make sure that
 
 Producers are paid a fair price that covers their production and living 
costs so that they have some security, they have long-term contracts 
and therefore can plan ahead, and their businesses are sustainable.
 
 The extra money you pay goes toward other aspects of the producers’ 
welfare, such as education.
 
 Producers and workers are allowed to join unions and other organiza-
tions that can protect their rights and ensure that they have fair working 
conditions.
 
 No child labor is used.
 
 Production methods are environmentally friendly and pesticide-free.

Organizations International, an umbrella group that deals with a number of 
different certification programs around the world: www.fairtrade.net.
Growing your own — at home 
or in a community garden
If you have the time, energy, space, and desire, the greenest option is to grow 
some of your food yourself using organic methods. Food that comes out of 
your garden isn’t only the most local food you can possibly get, but it con-
tributes to sustainability. You can find more information about what to grow 
and how to grow it in Book VI.
If you don’t have access to space of your own but like the idea of gardening 
and growing some of your own food, consider joining a community gardening 
project or even setting up one in your area if one doesn’t exist. A community 
garden is essentially any plot of land that a group of people garden together. 
Many are volunteer-run, perhaps located on land that belongs to a housing 
association, city council, church, school, or healthcare facility.
Each garden runs by its own rules; in some cases, people sign up for spe-
cific duties, whereas in others, the team assigns workers weekly to keep the 
garden healthy. Part of the community garden team may include members 
who take responsibility for areas such as volunteer management, fundraising, 
obtaining plants, garden maintenance, and harvesting.
 
To find a community garden in your area or to find out how to set one up, 
visit the American Community Gardening Association’s Web site at www.

Getting a Grip on Organic
Maybe you focus on taste and convenience when you’re thinking about get-
ting supper on the table each night, but a lot more goes into your food than 
meets the eye. If you ask many schoolchildren where bacon comes from, 
they’re likely tell you “the grocery store.” The process of breeding, rearing, 
feeding, and eventually killing pigs and other animals for food is something 
many of them know nothing about. And why should they? They live in towns 
and cities where they may never encounter anything related to farming. But if 
you want to know what you’re eating, you need to know what kind of farming 
methods get the meat you eat from the farmyard to your plate. Even a simple 
grilled cheese sandwich likely contains a lot more than wheat flour and milk. 
When eating green, you need to consider chemicals and additives along with 
factors such as how the chickens were raised and what went into the field of 
grain aside from the grain itself.
You may think it should be quite easy to explain exactly what is and isn’t 
organic food. But it’s not that straightforward. Hundreds of organizations 
around the world give certificates to say that products are organic, and each 
has slightly different criteria by which it makes its judgments.
U.S. farmers have to meet the United States Department of Agriculture’s defi-
nition of organic through the National Organic Program. Basically, the pro-
gram says that in growing crops and raising animals the organic way, natural 
substances are allowed, and synthetic substances aren’t. More specifically, it 
means that
 
 Crops are grown without the use of most chemically based pesticides or 
petroleum- or sewage-based fertilizers.
 
 Animals are raised without antibiotics or growth hormones.
 
 Genetic engineering and ionizing radiation aren’t allowed at any stage of 
the food-creation process.
 
Although organic food is produced by greener methods and shouldn’t con-
tain pesticides and other substances that can potentially be bad for your 
health, scientists aren’t in agreement about whether organic food is safer and 
more nutritious than its nonorganic equivalents. In fact, the USDA is careful 
to point out that the National Organic Program lets consumers know what is 
and isn’t organic; it doesn’t make any claims that organic produce is better or 
safer for you than nonorganic produce.

53

What isn’t disputed, however, is that conventional — and especially intensive — 
farming methods can be much more damaging to the environment than organic 
methods.
 
The words organic and natural aren’t interchangeable. Organic products have 
been created (or grown) using natural methods and ingredients and haven’t 
come into contact with chemicals. Natural, however, means simply that a 
product doesn’t contain artificial ingredients — not that the production pro-
cess has been organic. What’s more, the use of the word natural isn’t regu-
lated by federal guidelines, so you’re trusting the manufacturer on that one.
Avoiding chemicals and 
unnecessary medicines
Organic farming is much friendlier for the earth and the local economy than 
mass production of products. Instead of using chemical-based fertilizers to 
create a high-yield soil, organic farming uses traditional methods of plowing 
the soil to break down soil compaction that can reduce water and air getting to 
the plants’ roots, rotating the crops to prevent crop-specific diseases or pests 
from building up in the soil, and growing cover crops such as peas or clover 
that naturally add fertility to the soil in rotation with conventional crops.
Organic farming also emphasizes the use of physical, mechanical, or biologi-
cal controls to handle weeds, insects, and plant diseases. You can pull weeds 
by hand or machine, for example, or introduce a beneficial insect to eat a 
harmful one (for example, ladybugs to eat aphids). If you don’t use danger-
ous substances, you eliminate the risk of their running into nearby rivers, 
streams, and the water table below, affecting water quality. In turn, you’re 
less likely to be eating any chemicals used to keep bugs at bay and the soil 
fertile.
When it comes to livestock, organic animals are fed only organic feed along 
with vitamins and minerals. Depending on the animal, there are specific rules 
about when and for how long the feed needs to be 100 percent organic.
Growth hormones and antibiotics also are specifically banned in organic food 
products, although vaccines are allowed. Of course, farmers are allowed — in 
fact, they’re required — to give medication, including antibiotics, to animals 
that are sick to prevent suffering. However, food products that come from 
the animal involved may not be called organic if the animal has received a 
medication that’s on the organic-prohibited list.

Letting nature govern production: 
Say no to genetic modification!
Genetically modified organisms — also known as genetically engineered 
organisms — are living things whose genetic makeup (their DNA structure) 
has been changed by the addition of genes from another living thing. Genetic 
modification is used to make plants and animals more beneficial to food pro-
duction, both in terms of quantity and quality. With this kind of intervention 
come major concerns that, for the green community, outweigh the pros.
Although cloning doesn’t fit the definition of genetic modification (the DNA 
hasn’t been added to but rather replicated), the use of cloned animals or 
their offspring — especially for animal products such as milk (the cloned 
animals themselves are currently too valuable to be used for meat) — in the 
food supply is something that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is 
assessing as this book goes to print. Although the FDA has stated that there’s 
no scientific evidence to show that the meat or milk products, for example, 
are unsafe, groups opposing the approval cite research that indicates cloned 
animals may have some genetic abnormalities. It’s not yet clear what effect, if 
any, those abnormalities may have if they enter the food chain.
The potential effects of genetic modification
Genetic modification (GM) may make foods taste better, last longer before 
spoiling, or contain certain types of nutrients or medicines. The primary 
benefit, though, is generally to food producers in terms of higher production 
capacities, increased disease or pest resistance, or increased herbicide resis-
tance (which enables farmers to use more weed-killing herbicides). Crops, for 
example, can be genetically modified so that they resist insects, herbicides, 
and disease or so that they contain extra nutrients or even vaccines. Animals 
can be genetically modified to produce lower-fat meat, resist certain dis-
eases, or create less waste.
 
One of the most common genetic changes to food products involves a gene 
that comes from a bacterium known as Bt. When this gene is added to plants 
such as corn or cotton, those plants begin to produce a protein that’s toxic 
to insects that can otherwise prey on the crops — and, unfortunately, to a lot 
of other nonpests, such as butterflies and moths.
Proponents of GM crops claim that nutritionally enhanced grain or rice crops 
can be used in developing countries to solve some of the issues of under-
nourishment or malnutrition. GM crops also can be used to provide vaccines 
against diseases, which also would most benefit the developing world. Some 
scientists believe that, by boosting production efficiency, resource conserva-
tion, and nutrition, GM crops and animals can offer solutions to both world 
hunger and environmental degradation.

With all these potential benefits, you’re probably wondering where the con-
cern comes in. Scientists’ biggest reservations lay in the unknown; genetic 
engineering is a relatively new concept (modern genetic engineering began 
with scientific discoveries in the 1950s through 1970s), so long-term conse-
quences have yet to be determined. And given the amount of time generally 
needed to link cause and effect in the scientific world, you can safely assume 
that these consequences won’t be identified in your lifetime — and perhaps 
not even that of your children or grandchildren.
Some scientists also are concerned that GM ingredients may cause toxic poi-
soning, allergic reactions, antibiotic resistance, and even cancer in humans. 
Research hasn’t proven all the concerns, but there’s enough evidence to war-
rant caution.
Some short-term effects include the potential for GM crops to “contaminate” 
non-GM crops when their seeds migrate over distances. Contamination 
means that GM seeds can begin growing in non-GM areas, meaning that the 
non-GM crops would no longer be considered free of GM material, which is 
a huge issue, especially for organic growers who — through no fault of their 
own — would suddenly be prevented from calling their crops organic. Other 
concerns include the potential for organisms, such as insects and viruses, to 
evolve and become more powerful super pests that overcome the resistant 
GM animals and plants.
Examining the world food supply
The issue of what’s happening with food around 
the world is part of the larger discussion of 
eating green. While famines often make news 
headlines, children in many developing nations 
face a more constant (and usually unreported) 
threat: undernourishment and malnutrition. But 
does this mean that the world isn’t producing 
enough food to feed everyone? Not necessarily.
The Population Reference Bureau (www.prb.
org) reported in 2007 that malnutrition plays a 
role in the deaths of approximately 6 million 
young children a year, primarily in the develop-
ing world. That’s 16,000 children a day.
The issue with food isn’t that we can’t currently 
produce enough to feed the world: According 
to the United Nations’ World Food Programme 
(WFP), there’s plenty of food to go around. The 
problem is that the food isn’t always grown 
where it’s needed. Natural disasters, war, 
lack of infrastructure such as irrigation, over-
farming practices that rob the land of its fertil-
ity, and poverty all can reduce how much food 
is available in specific areas. The result is an 
overabundance of food in some areas and a 
shortage in others.
Improving the green quotient of your food — 
buying local and organic — can help protect 
the environment and support producers near 
to you. To address issues on a global scale, 
you can support or get involved with nonprofit 
organizations that work in developing areas to 
improve the situation, such as the WFP (www.
wfp.org).

Book I: Green Living 
In addition, the idea of manipulating living organisms at the DNA structural level 
raises serious ethical questions. This interference goes well beyond the ways in 
which humans have traditionally interfered (by cross-breeding, for example). 
Experience should have taught us that interfering with nature can create 
unforeseen results (such as when high-end predators like wolves were culled 
from the food chain, causing an overpopulation of deer that were then prone to 
starvation because there weren’t enough food sources to sustain them).
Genetic engineering changes the fundamental building blocks of life: 
Researchers don’t know how changing the genes of crops will affect wildlife 
that coexists with the crops, or how changing the genes of animals may affect 
them (possibly causing diseases or deformities and therefore suffering). If 
farmers introduce GM crops that have been designed to resist herbicides, for 
example, how will they be able to remove those crops if they later realize that 
the GM crops have unexpected and undesirable effects? Until we can answer 
these ethical questions, we need to err very much on the side of caution.
Recognizing when food has been genetically modified
Because of concerns about foods that contain genetically modified ingredi-
ents, GM food has become a major consumer concern in Europe, to the point 
where any foods that contain GM products as ingredients must be labeled 
as such. For the most part, European consumers avoid GM-labeled foods, 
so producers simply aren’t growing crops or raising animals that have been 
genetically modified.
In the United States, however, the issue hasn’t captured consumers in the 
same way. GM crops are common in the United States, and no labeling is 
required; in fact, it’s estimated that upwards of 70 percent of foods in U.S. 
supermarkets contain some element of genetic engineering. You most likely 
are eating GM ingredients in your food without even realizing it.
 
The best way to find out whether your food choices contain genetically engi-
neered ingredients is to choose local options so that you can talk to the pro-
ducers and find out from them exactly what went into the food. If you can’t 
do that, then try talking to the managers or owners of local grocery stores — 
they may not be able to tell you about production methods, but the fact that 
you asked them may help to convince them that they should pay more atten-
tion to this issue.
If you can’t buy the groceries you need from your community, try contacting 
food manufacturers directly. Their Web sites often contain information about 
production methods and a consumer telephone or e-mail hotline for ques-
tions. If companies aren’t able to categorically deny that they use GM ingredi-
ents, chances are good that they use these products.

Some of the foods and ingredients currently subject to genetic modification 
for reasons such as increasing yield or pest resistance include
 
 Soybeans: Soy is one of the main sources of genetically modified ingre-
dients in food and can be found in everything from chocolate to potato 
chips, margarine to mayonnaise, and biscuits to bread.
 
 Canola: Canola oil comes from certain types of canola plants. GM canola 
may be used for oils in making potato chips and animal feed.
 
 Corn: GM corn is used as cattle feed but also is used in all sorts of pack-
aged food, such as breakfast cereal, bread, corn chips, and gravy mixes.
 
 Wheat: GM wheat has been developed, but its implementation in North 
America so far has been successfully opposed.
 
 Milk: Cows may be injected with a genetically engineered growth hor-
mone to increase milk production.
The life and times of a factory-farm chicken
You only have to look at how chickens are 
treated on a factory farm to understand how 
viruses such as bird flu strains can evolve and 
spread quickly and why eating meat can intro-
duce chemicals into your diet. That’s not to 
mention the welfare issues related to treating 
animals with a significant lack of compassion. 
Here’s some insight into how chickens live their 
lives on factory farms:
  Many hens born and raised on a factory 
farm can live their whole lives crammed 
inside cages next to other chickens, never 
seeing anything outside the cage in which 
they’re housed.
  Most hens raised on a factory farm have 
never walked, never stretched their wings, 
never made a nest, and never foraged for 
food.
  Because of their desire to move around, 
the hens can become aggressive and peck 
at the other chickens around them, caus-
ing injury and disease. To avoid that, many 
hens’ beaks are cut off when they’re born.
  Chickens raised for meat (called broilers) 
spend relatively short lives in sheds with 
hundreds or even thousands of other birds. 
They’re fed with growth hormones so that 
they grow quickly, which makes them pre-
disposed to disease and physical abnor-
malities. Many of these birds die of heart 
attacks, dehydration, or starvation because 
they can’t even stand or walk to feeders.
You can find more information about factory 
farming from the U.S. Animal Welfare Institute 
(www.awionline.org), which recently 
launched its Animal Welfare Approved certifi-
cation program for family farms.

Freedom rules for organic livestock
Organic livestock farming takes into account both the health of the animals 
as well as their welfare. Factory farming concentrates many animals in a lim-
ited space, which can result in an overflow of animal waste on each farm and 
the need to use extra water and chemicals to assist in removing the waste. 
Additional chemical use can lead to chemicals leaching into the soil and the 
water table, and it can mean that the animals are less healthy and may often 
need to be treated with antibiotics and other medicines. Organically raised 
animals, however, must be free-range, which means they have access to the 
outdoors, including pasture. They aren’t confined within buildings but may 
be kept in buildings temporarily for health or safety reasons.
The rules on what constitutes free range aren’t always what green experts 
would wish; free range covers a variety of conditions, from the birds being 
able to wander in a natural environment to the birds having access to a small 
outdoor enclosure that may not be very natural. It’s a good idea to check 
with the producer if you can in order to find out what free range means in the 
context of a particular product.
Factory farming methods have evolved to meet the ever-growing demand for 
meat. The organic approach may be slower and less profitable — animals 
must have room to move, and so fewer animals can be produced from the 
same amount of land, for example — but it produces cleaner and healthier 
animals.
 
If you find it difficult to locate organic meat, ask your local butcher to stock 
some organic and sustainable options; increased demand increases supply. 
The environment will be better off, and your local butcher will have a guar-
anteed customer. You also can purchase food from animals that have been 
raised in a sustainable way through the Eat Well Guide at www.eatwell
guide.org. The site has searchable listings of producers across the country.
Fishing for sustainable varieties
Buying fish brings with it a whole range of ethical issues. The world’s fish 
stocks are dwindling, which means that fishermen have to go farther afield 
into deeper waters to bring home their catch. Fishing in deeper waters means 
greater use of dragnets that catch endangered species as well as fish for the 
stores. Fish are taken from the sea younger, further depleting stocks because 
fewer breeding fish are in the sea. Only 3 percent of the world’s fish stocks 
are underexploited. At the same time, demand for fish is growing, doubling in 
the last 30 years alone.

59
 Chapter 3: Making Great Green Diet Decisions
Book I
Green 
Living
One answer to the decrease in fish stocks has been to farm fish such as 
salmon. Intensive farming methods have resulted in the same sorts of prob-
lems faced in livestock farming, however. The use of chemicals, antibiotics, 
and disinfectants to protect the farmed fish from disease has led to worries 
about toxins and cancer-causing chemicals in the fish you eat, and there are 
concerns about escaping fish carrying contamination into wild fish stocks. 
All this comes at a time when nutritionists advise eating more cold-water fish 
species for the benefits of the heart-protecting omega-3 oils that they contain.
Various national and international quotas are in place that set the amount 
of fish that each country can take from the various fishing grounds. These 
restrictions have done a lot to conserve fish stocks, but some fishermen 
cross into non-quota-controlled waters in order to meet demand, and many 
conservationists are concerned that current quotas aren’t low enough.
When you go shopping for fish, you need to think about
 
 Whether the fish you’re buying is from sustainable stock: Sustainable 
stock means that the fish are replacing themselves at the same rate as 
they’re being fished. Cod, for example, used to live up to 40 years and 
grow up to 6 feet long, but now the stocks are so depleted that most of 
the fish caught are less than 2 years old and haven’t bred replacement 
fish. People usually are advised not to buy cod in order to allow stocks 
to build up again.
 
 What the fish’s body may contain: There’s a major concern that many 
fish — including swordfish and Chilean sea bass — contain higher than 
healthy doses of substances such as mercury.
 
 Whether the fish is farmed or wild: Buying wild fish may contribute to 
overfishing, but the fish may be a healthier option than farmed. If you 
choose to buy farmed varieties, opt for farms that use sustainable prac-
tices. Wild Alaskan salmon usually are considered healthy and sustain-
ably caught.
 
 How the fish was caught: Catching fish by line doesn’t cause further 
damage to the marine environment, but net fishing can do a huge amount 
of environmental damage. For example, fishing for Yellowfin tuna with 
purse seine nets in the Eastern Tropical Pacific kills hundreds of thousands 
of dolphins. Fishing for shrimp and other bottom dwellers often is done 
using drag nets that destroy the ecosystem of the sea floor being fished.
 
Buy fish from a store where the staff members know how and where the fish 
were caught, where any farmed fish come from, and how they were farmed. 
Check out the fish facts from the Marine Conservation Society Web site at 
www.fishonline.org or from the Marine Stewardship Council Web site at 
www.msc.org. Also keep on top of changing information about species that 
are threatened or potentially contaminated: Check Sea Food Watch at www.
seafoodwatch.org for the latest news.

Reading Labels to Apply Green Ideals
Buying food can be confusing, particularly if you’re trying to make healthy 
and sustainable choices. Reading the labels is important because in grocery 
stores, they’re often the only source of information about the content of the 
food you buy. Food labels aren’t perfect, but they do provide basic informa-
tion about where the food comes from, what it contains, and what nutritional 
value it offers.
Finding food with good nutritional 
value and ethical production
When buying a food product, find out whether it has arrived on the shelf 
from a sustainable production process by checking out the following informa-
tion on the label:
 
 Ingredients list: Understanding the ingredients and their nutrients gives 
you an excellent feel for the quality of your food. Heavily processed food 
is likely to have added salt to assist in preservation and taste and sev-
eral chemicals for flavoring and coloring. Naturally prepared foods are 
usually low in added salt, sugar, and saturated fats.
 
 Animals used: Some animals and fish are protected because over-
farming, culling, or habitat destruction has led to near extinction. From 
a food point of view, you’re most likely to run into threatened species 
of fish; you can find the latest news plus handy pocket shopping guides 
from Sea Food Watch (www.seafoodwatch.org). The site tells you 
the best choices for seafood, good alternatives if you can’t find the best 
choices, and species that you should avoid.
 
 Country of origin: Somewhere on the label should be a note that says 
“Product of (a country).” Technically, this information tells you the 
country the food comes from, which is helpful if you’re not able to buy 
a product from local sources. The note on the label can tell you, for 
example, whether the product is from the United States or from Mexico; 
however, the reality is that this information can be misleading. It may 
indicate, for example, where the product was processed and packaged 
rather than where the original produce actually came from or where it 
traveled to during the processing. The nuances aren’t apparent from 
the packaging, so you may have to check sources such as the manufac-
turer’s Web site to find out where it processes its products.

Looking for organic and more on labels
Organic food is much more plentiful than it used to be; demand for it con-
tinues to increase, so retailers are responding with a wider range of organic 
products at lower prices. Now most of the big food retailers sell organic fruit, 
vegetables, and meat, as well as processed foods like bread and breakfast 
cereal and other foods.
The USDA’s National Organic Program has strict rules about what food 
manufacturers can and can’t say regarding organic foods on food labels. 
Specifically, if a food label has the National Organic Program’s seal on it (see 
Figure 3-1), the producer has been certified under the program. The specifics 
of the wording, however, are where the differences lie.
 
Figure 3-1: 
The USDA’s 
seal con-
firms that a 
product is 
organic.
 
USDA
ORGANIC
Here are the USDA’s labeling terms, with explanations:
 
 100 Percent Organic: All ingredients in the product are organic.
 
 Organic: At least 95 percent of the product’s ingredients are organic.
 
 Made with Organic Ingredients: At least 75 percent of the product’s 
ingredients are organic.
 
 Organic ingredients noted on the ingredients statement: Less than 70 
percent of the product’s ingredients are organic, so the producer can 
identify only the actual organic ingredients within the ingredients listing 
on the product label.
Meat packaging has additional terminology that you should be aware of, 
although at this point, no third-party inspectors verify these claims, and 
you’re therefore trusting the packager:

62
Book I: Green Living 
 
 Natural: Labels may refer to beef and lamb, in particular, as being pro-
duced naturally, but this designation means only that the meat may not 
have any artificial colors, artificial flavors, preservatives, or other arti-
ficial ingredients. Natural production doesn’t necessarily mean that the 
animals led the life of Riley outside, gamboling in the fields.
 
 Grass fed: Feeding cows primarily on grass or hay rather than on grain 
is considered greener (and kinder) because they can digest grass and 
hay more easily.
 
 Free-range: This term means that chickens, for example, weren’t con-
fined to cages. There are different degrees of free-range, however — 
from true free-range where the chickens are allowed to wander in a fairly 
large space outside to more limited conditions where they may have 
only short periods outside in an area that’s quite small. You may not be 
able to tell exactly what free-range means when you see it on meat pack-
aging, so if you’re looking at a specific product, consider contacting its 
producer directly for clarification.
 
The next time you’re in the produce aisle, check out the little label that’s 
stuck on the fruit: You should see either a four- or a five-digit code on the 
label. A four-digit code means that the produce was produced convention-
ally (it’s not organic). A five-digit code that starts with “9” indicates that it’s 
organically grown, and a five-digit code that starts with “8” indicates that it’s 
genetically engineered.
 
You can get more information on the regulations of food labeling from the 
FDA at www.cfsan.fda.gov.
Any food producer in the United States that wants to use the word “organic” 
in its labeling has to follow the National Organic Program, and any producer 
that’s selling more than $5,000 worth of organic food a year has to become 
certified under the program. In order to become certified, the land has to 
have been treated organically for at least three years, and an organic plan 
must be in place to explain production practices and substances. (Converting 
to organic farming takes time — time for all the existing pesticides and fertil-
izers to disappear from the soil.) The producer then applies for certification, 
which involves an initial inspection and then annual inspections for as long 
as the producer wants to be part of the program. The program’s inspectors 
can show up unannounced, and they can test the food for residues if they 
think that it may have been in contact with nonorganic substances.

Failsafe ways to buy locally 
when labels are unclear
If you find no labels on particular foods, or if you find labels with little infor-
mation — which can be the case in smaller stores and in the fruit and vegeta-
ble sections of bigger grocery stores — here are a few tips to help you make 
the greenest food choices:
 
 Eat fruit and vegetables in season. They’re more likely to have been 
grown locally. Fruits and vegetables on the shelf that you know aren’t 
in season are likely to have been imported or brought by road from the 
other end of the country.
 
 Avoid exotic foods. Some foods and ingredients, such as coffee and tea, 
likely can’t be grown locally; the United States simply doesn’t have the 
climate for them. Find out what grows near where you live by checking 
out local farmers’ markets or by visiting the Web site of your state’s 
department of agriculture, and make the most of it. You’ll be supporting 
your local growers.
 
 Food retailers say that customers want exotic foods from around the 
world, partly because people are traveling more widely and experiencing 
foods that they want to continue to enjoy even after they arrive home. 
Eating green isn’t about sacrificing taste or variety or depriving yourself 
of a taste that you enjoy. If you’re making greener choices most of the 
time, there’s more than enough room for an occasional treat from afar.
 
 Look for local businesses. Check out the companies close to you that 
produce, package, and transport things like bread, rice, milk, and so on. 
Buying those brands means that you’re likely cutting down on the miles 
your food travels and supporting your local economy.
If you try to buy local produce in order to cut down on the environmental 
impact of food traveling around the globe, you’re likely to end up eating 
what’s in season. And that’s how people used to eat: lettuce in the summer 
and apples in the fall, for example. Quite apart from the environmental and 
health benefits of eating this way, there’s the added pleasure of rediscovering 
particular foods each year. When the season is over, you can look forward to 
tasting something again next year instead of becoming used to it all year and 
taking it for granted.

64
Book I: Green Living 
 
Buying local produce may not be practical in areas that are especially hot or 
cold because there are times of the year when pretty much nothing grows. 
As always, you need to make compromises based on not just the greenest 
option but the greenest option that’s available to you.
It’s possible that local producers extend the growing seasons using different 
kinds of technology: artificial heating and lighting, for example, or growing 
under poly tunnels. While this setup isn’t as perfectly green as in-season, 
outdoor growing, it can be done in a way that reduces the impact on the envi-
ronment. Talk to the producers to find out how they manage their growing 
seasons.
Eating green when out and about
When you go out for a meal, you have to depend 
on the chef when it comes to green principles. 
Many chefs, however, make a point of buying 
only truly local and/or organic produce. If you 
want to be sure of what you’re getting, call 
the restaurant before you make a reservation 
and ask about the ingredients used. Good res-
taurants are more than happy to answer your 
questions — and if more customers demand 
greener restaurant meals, chefs and managers 
will get the message.

T
he earlier you encourage your children to become interested in green 
choices and issues, the more likely they are to carry that interest 
through the rest of their lives. With that kind of head start, imagine how 
much better off the planet will be when they’re done with it!
Setting a great green example for your children is an excellent beginning. 
Then add fun green activities and get involved to encourage your children’s 
schools to be as green as possible. What you do in your own home to live 
a greener lifestyle can translate to the school environment, and what your 
children learn at school can be put to good use at home — everyone benefits. 
This chapter shows you how to best instill green values in your youngsters 
as well as how to live greenly with a baby, who likely values only milk, mushy 
foods, and snuggling.
Greening Your Baby
There’s nothing like starting the green lifestyle immediately — even before 
your children arrive in the world. From the items you surround them with to 
the items you dress them in, you have plenty of opportunities to keep the mate-
rials as natural and organic as possible. You may want to encourage friends 
and family who buy baby gifts for you to go green as well — providing hints 
about where they can find greener items can help. The increasing number of 
stores that carry environmentally friendly goods for babies is making buying 
green much easier.

66
Book I: Green Living 
 
Opting for the most organic and/or local food possible (including breastfeed-
ing, if possible) for your baby is not only environmentally friendly but also 
healthy. (You can find general information on eating green in Chapter 3 of 
this book.)
Equipping the green nursery
When going green in the nursery, you can take a variety of approaches. Using 
natural and organic materials whenever possible is one way to reduce the 
amount of potentially harmful substances that your baby comes in contact 
with. Another way to focus on ecological protection is simply to reduce the 
number of items that you buy.
The list of baby paraphernalia, from clothing to furniture and everything in 
between, can appear endless at first, and if you’re having your first child, 
it’s difficult to know what you really need. Get recommendations from other 
parents: Find out what they used a lot and what they hardly used at all. For 
example, you may be able to forego a changing table in favor of a low dresser 
with a pad on top. Your child can keep the dresser and get more use out of it 
over the years than a changing table.
 
Stay true to your own lifestyle. If you love to jog and find that it’s an excellent 
stress reliever, go ahead and invest in a good quality wheeled baby carrier 
that you can jog behind in comfort. (Look for one that’s secondhand rather 
than buying new.) You’ll be happier and healthier, which helps your baby to 
be happy and healthy.
 
Consider obtaining just these essentials before the baby is born, and add to 
your list gradually as you find out whether you really need other items:
 
 Diapers: See the later section “Choosing cloth versus disposable diapers.”
 
 Clothing: Look for comfy secondhand clothes in good condition and 
forget about all the fancy outfits — they’re more for you than the baby 
anyway.
 
 Personal baby care: Many experts recommend using a small amount of 
plain old olive oil for use as baby skin lotion.
 
 Car seats: Because anchoring car seats properly is a major safety issue 
and can mean the difference between life and death for your child, relax 
your green rules here and buy an extra car seat if you have more than 
one vehicle in which the child will be riding (this includes grandparents’ 
cars). Buy new car seats or ensure that secondhand car seats are in 
excellent condition.

 Crib: Look for a crib that turns into a child’s bed to reduce the amount 
of furniture you need to buy later on.
 
 Toys: Opt for secondhand toys, soft toys made from organic cotton, and 
wood toys with nontoxic paints. And keep the number of toys in check.
 
 High chair: A sturdy high chair really does make feeding so much easier.
 
 Baby buggy/stroller: Look for one that does double duty, converting 
from a buggy for young babies to a stroller for older babies and toddlers.
For a lot more information, Tree Hugger (http://treehugger.com) has 
a section on greening your baby; also, you can find a lot of ecofriendly baby 
products at Ecobaby (http://ecobaby.com) and information on a green 
nursery from National Geographic’s Green Guide (www.thegreenguide.
com/doc/119/greenroomtogrow).
 
When choosing materials such as paint, furniture, and flooring for your nurs-
ery, be aware that many new materials that have a distinctive smell (like the 
scent that new cars often have) are actually off-gassing, or releasing volatile 
organic chemicals (VOCs) into the air. These chemicals, include formaldehyde 
and toluene and have been linked with health effects that range from breath-
ing passage irritation to cancer. Try to avoid items with VOCs, especially 
plywood, particleboard, and upholstered furniture or mattresses that contain 
formaldehyde or PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) as flame retardants; 
Ikea (www.ikea.com) and Select Comfort (www.selectcomfort.com) have 
said they’re avoiding these substances in upholstery and mattresses. You 
also can decorate the nursery well before the baby arrives in order to let new 
materials off-gas or keep new items outside or in the garage for a few days to 
let the worst of the gases dissipate (The items release significantly more gases 
when they’re new, and off-gassing in plywood and pressed wood can go on for 
months or even years — yet another reason to buy secondhand.)
Here are some strategies for choosing the most ecofriendly items for your 
nursery:
 
 Decor: Choose natural materials wherever possible, including flooring of 
solid wood, linoleum, bamboo, cork, or organic cotton or wool carpets; 
water-based finishes for hardwood floors; paint that contains low or no 
VOCs; and soft furnishings made from natural, organic fabrics.
 
 Furniture: Select solid wood furniture with nontoxic finishes and ensure 
that the item is durable. You may have to spend a little more on quality, 
well-constructed furniture, but the fact that it will hold up much longer 
than other offerings makes it worthwhile. Further lengthen the life of 
nursery furniture by selecting multipurpose furniture: a crib that can 
later become a bed, for example, or a changing table that incorporates a 
chest of drawers. Look for mattresses made from natural materials such 
as rubber and organic wool or cotton.

68
Book I: Green Living 
 
 Clothing: Natural fibers are great, but organic natural fibers are even 
better: Wool, cotton, hemp, and even bamboo if it comes from sustain-
able and chemical-free sources are all green options that are becoming 
more widely available in stores and online.
 
 Baby care: Look for products made from natural, organic, and fra-
grance-free ingredients. Avoid antibacterial products and minimize 
chemical-impregnated items such as wipes — look for biodegradable, 
chlorine-free wipes, for example, from Seventh Generation (www.sev-
enthgeneration.com) and other ecofriendly companies or use wash-
cloths instead. (Because the issue of cloth versus disposable diapers is a 
bigger discussion, we devote the whole next section to it.)
 
 Cleaners: Avoid antibacterial and chemical cleaners. Instead use natu-
rally based products, from household cleaners to laundry detergents. 
Stay away from chemical-based fabric softeners, too. More information 
about natural versus chemical cleaners appears in Chapter 5 of this 
book, but you can look for products such as Ecover, Method’s Free & 
Clear line, Restore, and Seventh Generation for greener alternatives to 
conventional cleaning and laundry products. Chapter 3 of Book III gives 
you recipes for homemade cleaners.
Choosing cloth versus disposable diapers
It’s the big question for prospective parents: cloth or disposable diapers? 
Considering that the little tykes need approximately 6,000 of the absorbent 
necessities before they graduate to being toilet-trained, it’s a big ques-
tion and an important one. Is it better to go with disposable and add to the 
nation’s waste or go with cloth and add to the energy output required to 
launder them (as well as the inconvenience of having to deal with the messy 
post-baby cleanup)?
On the pro side of disposables, they’re easy; on the con side, they take 
upwards of 500 years to decompose in landfills, and the 18 billion that get 
thrown out in the United States annually consume approximately 100,000 
tons of plastic and 800,000 tons of tree pulp every year — not exactly the 
greenest products. Plus, there’s the question of what’s hidden within them, 
namely dioxin, a byproduct of bleaching the pulp, which has been linked to 
cancer, plus other chemicals and fragrances that can cause allergic reactions.
Enter cloth diapers, which have the major disadvantage that they’re not 
convenient — you generally have to presoak the dirty diapers and then wash 
them in the washing machine (or at least rinse them and have a laundry ser-
vice take care of washing them). This all means that you’re handling dirty dia-
pers several times instead of once (as with disposables). Odor also may be 

69
 Chapter 4: Setting Your Kids on the Path to a Green Lifestyle
Book I
Green 
Living
an issue, and the time involved to deal with the dirty diapers most definitely 
is something to think about, too. Removable, biodegradable, flushable liners 
for cloth diapers can make the worst of the waste much easier to dispose 
of — it gets flushed away with an environmental impact far less than that 
of a disposable diaper (which, of course, isn’t flushable at all). (One option 
is gDiapers, cloth diapers that use plastic-free, flushable inserts for easier 
cleanup; visit www.gdiapers.com for details.) However, the mess involved 
with cloth diapers is an issue for many parents, especially when the child has 
a tummy bug.
 
The super absorbent polymers (SAP) that disposables and some flushable 
diaper liners contain are the same polymers that were removed from tam-
pons because they were linked to toxic shock syndrome. SAP can absorb 
many times their weight in liquid; sodium polyacrylate, for example, can take 
on 100 times its weight. This characteristic makes them great for diapers, but 
they may not be so great for your baby, although no conclusive studies exist 
at this point.
The advantage is that you can use cloth diapers again and again, and some 
studies indicate that cloth can help if your baby’s prone to diaper rash. Other 
studies have shown that washing diapers takes about the equivalent amount 
of water as flushing a toilet five times a day for the same period (which may 
be less than you imagined it would take) and that even when you throw in 
the energy that your washing machine uses, cloth diapers have half the eco-
logical footprint of disposables (even less if you use a laundry service). (See 
Chapter 1 for a discussion about ecological or environmental footprints.)
So . . . the ultimate in ecofriendliness where diaper duty is concerned 
appears to be cloth. The good news is that cloth diapers are much more par-
ent-friendly than they used to be. Forget about pins: The new versions come 
with snaps or hook-and-loop tape for easy on and easy off. They also come 
in organic fabric options, including hemp, bamboo, and cotton, and you can 
choose organic wool covers that help protect the diaper against leaks, too.
 
Cloth diapers are starting to take up more space on store shelves, but if the 
selection in your neighborhood is sparse, try Cotton Babies (www.cotton
babies.com). Diaperco (www.diaperco.com) sells diapers and has an 
informative section for anyone new to cloth diapering.
 
Washing cloth diapers is one occasion when you shouldn’t save energy by 
using a cold wash cycle. Hot water kills germs, which is especially important 
because the clean diapers go back on your baby. (It’s no good being green 
if it negatively affects hygiene.) Presoak cloth diapers in hot water and then 
wash in hot water with a cold rinse using detergent that’s free of perfumes 
or dyes. Don’t use fabric softener, which can reduce absorbency and cause 
allergic reactions or irritation.

70
Book I: Green Living 
 
When it comes to diapers, you don’t have to go all the way in either direction. 
In fact, some childcare providers don’t allow cloth diapers, so you may have 
to compromise there. Or you can use cloth at home and save disposable for 
when you’re out and about or for when your child has a digestive upset and 
you could really use the extra convenience. If you choose disposable diapers, 
opt for chlorine-free, biodegradable versions in order to be friendlier to the 
environment and your baby. And whether you use cloth or disposable, change 
diapers regularly to help prevent diaper rash and dump the waste down the 
toilet before either laundering or throwing out diapers. (This step puts human 
waste where it should be, which is in the sewer system, not the landfill.)
Instilling Green Values at Home
Most children understand green issues — sometimes even better than adults do. 
Children’s curiosity about the world gives them a natural empathy for the state 
of the environment, for the plight of the animals within it, and even for the situa-
tions faced by children in developing countries. When children feel that they can 
do something to help or make a difference, they usually go to it with enthusiasm.
The most effective way to teach your children to live a green lifestyle — with 
care and consideration for the environment, animals, and people with whom 
they share the world — is to live that lifestyle yourself and become a life-size 
example. When kids see you picking up trash from the park even though 
you weren’t the one who dropped it, they see value in keeping public places 
clean. When they see you volunteering your time for a worthy cause, they see 
that giving back to society is worthwhile and important.
 
From walking them to school to finding ways to reduce your family’s trash, every 
choice that you make helps your children make green choices, too. Involving 
them in the decision-making — in an age-appropriate way, of course — also 
helps them learn how to continue making even bigger green decisions as they 
get older. After all, if they grow up green, a sustainable lifestyle will come natu-
rally to them, allowing them to pass that way of life along to their friends, col-
leagues, and eventually their own children — a very positive, long-lasting ripple 
effect.
Starting kids young with green 
behaviors and activities
Even young children can gain an appreciation for nature and what it takes to 
protect it. Head outside with them whenever you can and introduce them to

the wonder that’s the world, from grass to caterpillars to daisies. Help them 
understand that the world is theirs to enjoy and protect; their desire to safe-
guard it will come naturally.
 
When you do something at home to make your life greener, explain the 
change and your reasons to your children, but don’t force changes on them. 
Lead by example, and they’ll likely adopt your plans far more quickly than if 
you were to force them into something.
Use these suggestions to introduce your children to green living:
 
 Choose an active lifestyle. Walk, bike, and play with your children 
regularly.
 
 Opt for public transportation. Use the car only when necessary; oth-
erwise, demonstrate a commitment to public transportation by taking 
trains and buses with your children.
 
 Ask for their help. Younger children in particular may be proud and 
happy to contribute to grown-up activities. Have them carry the con-
tainer of vegetable scraps to the compost bin, for example, and have 
them help you dig out the resulting soil to put on garden beds.
 
 Older children may want to get involved with green activities, such as 
cleaning up their neighborhood and organizing the household recycling, 
because they’ve learned about environmental issues at school. If they’re 
not enthusiastic, however, you may need to convince them by making it 
a family-time activity that you do together or by making their allowance 
partially conditional on their help with such projects around the house.
 
 Introduce them to growers. Take kids with you to places such as farm-
ers’ markets and farms where you pick items yourself so that they 
understand that food doesn’t just come from supermarket shelves.
 
 Consider introducing them to animal life. Petting farms for younger 
kids may help them to understand that there’s a whole other world 
beyond their community and prevent farm animals from becoming 
something that they see only in books or on television.
 
 Zoos offer a valuable educational and conservation lesson. (Many zoos 
are involved in breeding programs to help support the population of 
threatened or endangered species, for example.) If you feel that going to 
a zoo will help your children understand the wider global environment, 
look for a zoo that’s actively involved in conservation, is accredited 
through the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (www.aza.org/
FindZooAquarium), and provides its animals with as natural an envi-
ronment as possible along with plenty of mental stimulation.

72
Book I: Green Living 
 
 Create a family garden and get the kids involved. Gardens are places 
where the whole family can practice being green. If you don’t have room 
for a garden, you can involve your kids in planting window boxes and 
pots with herbs and salad greens.
 
 Limit consumption. Choose well-made, durable, quality toys over quan-
tity. (See the next section for more details about quality green toys.) 
Talk to family and friends about not overwhelming children with too 
many gifts and about checking with you first if they’re considering a big 
gift. Encourage kids to donate toys they no longer use to other children.
 
 Encourage conservation. Let kids know that resource-conserving habits, 
such as switching off lights and turning off water when brushing their 
teeth, are expected — and even rewarded.
 
You don’t have to become a paragon of green overnight, and you shouldn’t 
expect your children to either. Start with the things that are easiest to change 
and remember that every little bit helps. Add more changes gradually, and 
your family will soon be living greener without even realizing it!
Finding green toys
Thanks to the growing green movement and the Internet, finding toys that 
fit the environmentally friendly lifestyle is much easier than it used to be. 
Although you don’t want to cut off your children from tools such as electron-
ics that can help them learn, it’s a good idea to aim for a balance between 
screen-oriented playthings and those that boost their imagination, especially 
if the latter don’t expose them to harmful materials.
When looking for green toys, keep these points in mind:
 
 Choose natural materials. Toys made from solid wood and nontoxic 
finishes are your best bet along with those made from natural, prefer-
ably organic, fabrics. Avoid soft plastics that contain PVC, which has 
been linked to health hazards. For babies and toddlers, you can choose 
stuffed toys that are made from organic cotton and puzzles and pull-
along toys that are made from solid wood and nontoxic paints.
 
 Free up energy. Choose well-made, durable toys that will last for a long 
time. The fewer toys that you have to replace, the more energy you save 
in the processes that manufacture the toys in the first place, and the 
fewer toys end up in the landfill. Also look for toys that don’t require 
batteries and toys that are driven by alternative energy, such as solar 
power. (You can find solar-powered frogs, robots, and cars suitable for 
children from ages about 5 through 10 at many toy stores and online at 
fatbraintoys.com.)

73
 Chapter 4: Setting Your Kids on the Path to a Green Lifestyle

Living
 
 Boost imagination. Ensure that your children have access to unstructured 
play opportunities, whether outdoors or in. Science-based kits are great 
sources of inspiration and cover every subject from gardening to chemis-
try to arts and crafts, but even a collection of ecofriendly dress-up clothes 
(made from natural fabrics or secondhand items from friends and family) 
or a collection of building blocks can provide hours of imaginative fun.
 
 Go local or Fairtrade. Find out whether local artisans or manufactur-
ers produce toys near you and support their businesses. Buying locally 
helps reduce the energy costs associated with transporting toys to 
your local store. If you’re considering toys that were made elsewhere, 
research the manufacturer to find out who made them; look for toys that 
are certified under Fairtrade programs to ensure that those involved 
in the manufacturing process were treated well and paid fairly. Local, 
independent toy stores may carry Fairtrade toys; if not, check out Ten 
Thousand Villages (www.tenthousandvillages.com), which offers 
a selection of toys including rattles, puzzles, mobiles, simple musical 
instruments, kites, and games, all of which are Fairtrade items.
Involving children in green choices
Children like to be able to teach their parents a thing or two, so give them 
the chance to take the lead at home. Put them in charge of various aspects of 
your environmental policy at home, and they’ll likely love the role. You can 
help them take this leadership position by involving them in decision-making 
around the house.
Depending on their ages, you may ask your children to help you do the fol-
lowing things:
 
 Plan healthy, green family menus and then turn them into a shopping list.
 
 Find items around the house to reuse, such as turning computer paper 
printed on one side only into notebooks or scrap paper for art projects.
 
 Sort through their toys to find items that they’d like to donate to chil-
dren in need in their community.
 
 Save money as a family to help a charity either at home or around the 
world; examples include donating to a local food bank or helping a com-
munity in Africa build a well to provide a reliable source of water.
 
 Shop for secondhand clothing to ensure that they’re comfortable early 
on with wearing used items. Wait until they’re teenagers, and you’re 
swimming upstream to make secondhand a viable option.
 
 Set up bins and a composter to make organizing recycling efforts easy 
(see Chapter 2 of this book).

Book I: Green Living 
Staying Green through the School Year
Green education starts before children even arrive at school when you 
choose ecofriendly transportation, such as walking or carpooling, to get to 
and from the classroom. In some cases, of course, children have to take big 
yellow school buses to school; that’s actually a very green way to go, too, 
despite the bus color. Another simple way to keep your child green at school 
is to load them up with green school supplies.
Walking or biking to school
If your children’s schools are close enough to walk to, leave the car in the 
garage. Explain to your kids that when you take short journeys in the car, it 
doesn’t have enough time to warm up to run most efficiently and so those 
journeys cause the most pollution. Walking is the greenest way to travel and 
does the least damage to the environment.
Start out easy by walking on mild, dry mornings and driving when the weath-
er’s rainy or freezing. Gradually work up to walking even when the weather’s 
not so good.
 
Children love to hang out with their friends, so consider joining forces with 
the friends’ parents if they travel the same path to school as you and your 
children. This arrangement can give you adult company to chat with, or you 
can split the task of walking with the children to school. If enough children in 
your area head in the same direction to school, consider setting up a walking 
bus in which the children all walk together with a parent at the front as the 
“driver” and a parent at the back. The Pedestrian and Bicycle Information 
Center maintains a Web site that gives you the complete scoop on a walking 
bus. Find it at www.walkingschoolbus.org.
 
Walking isn’t just green. It’s good exercise and saves you money. You may 
even get your kids to school faster than if you were navigating busy streets in 
the car.
When your children are old enough and competent enough on bicycles, let 
them cycle to school. Consider enrolling them in a cycling proficiency class 
so that you both feel confident that they can handle themselves safely in traf-
fic. Check with schools, the local police department, or your town’s parks 
and recreation organization to find out about safety course offerings.

Setting up a carpool
If you have to drive your children to school, you can cut down on the number 
of cars going in the same direction each morning and afternoon by sharing 
the school run. Organize a group of parents to pick up the number of children 
that can safely be transported in the smallest car and then take it in turns.
To set up a carpool effectively, first talk to parents you know, such as the 
ones you see when you drop off your kids or others in your neighborhood, to 
find out whether their children’s schedules match yours. Find out which days 
work best (or worst) for them and create a schedule that works for everyone, 
distributing the driving responsibilities evenly. If the driving can’t be shared 
equally, suggest that a small fee be paid to help out with the drivers’ fuel and 
maintenance bills.
For safety reasons, everyone involved in the carpool must have full con-
tact information for all the children’s parents, along with the children’s 
addresses, allergy notes, and any important health information. Parents 
should introduce their own children to the parents who are driving so that 
“stranger danger” strategies can be maintained.
 
Have a system in place to notify the day’s driver if something happens to pre-
vent a child from taking the carpool. For example, a phone tree in which each 
parent calls and passes along messages to another parent may work best in 
these situations. Also consider making up a schedule that you e-mail to the 
group to keep everyone on track. Also agree ahead of time on rules, such as 
everyone wears their seatbelts, appropriate behavior while in the car, and no 
stopping while on the carpool run.
Stocking up on green school supplies
When your kids head to school, their bags should be filled with as many green 
school supplies as possible. Look for solar-powered calculators to save on bat-
teries, for example, and for post-consumer recycled paper content in printed 
products, such as loose-leaf paper and notebooks. Glue, crayons, and markers 
should be nontoxic, and lunches should be packed in reusable containers rather 
than disposable plastic and paper bags. Rather than re-using plastic water 
bottles, which can leach chemicals into the liquid they contain, consider using 
stainless steel beverage containers such as a Klean Kanteens (www.klean
kanteen.com), which are not only lightweight but also child-friendly. (You 
can purchase a sippy cup version of the Klean Kanteen for younger children.)

Chapter 5
Keeping Your Home Healthy
In This Chapter:
 Steering clear of manmade contaminants
 Detecting carbon monoxide in your home
 Honing in on the hazards of Mother Nature
Your house may well be the picture of health, but you can’t always tell 
by looking. That fresh coat of paint that has the living room looking daz-
zling isn’t necessarily great for the air you’re breathing. And you’re so used 
to seeing some of the things that may be making your home sick that you 
don’t notice them anymore — aerosol oven cleaner, anyone?
In this chapter, you find a number of the most common sources of home 
problems, discover how to detect them, and then arm yourself so that you 
know what to do when trouble strikes.
Know your enemy, and it shall be vanquished.
Getting Started with General Guidelines
As the other sections in this chapter explain, maintaining a healthy environ-
ment encompasses a lot of details, but some general rules are worth knowing 
for starters. Fortunately, most of them are easy enough to follow:
 
 Get wise. Find out what kinds of things to avoid. Understand where 
nasty little critters like to live and breed. (Carpets, anyone?) Pay atten-
tion to things you can’t see with the naked eye. In particular, read the 
warning labels, which spell out precisely what the dangers are.
 
 Ensure proper ventilation. Ventilation is essential to health. Getting it 
can be tough sometimes, especially in the winter. But you don’t neces-
sarily need to open windows to ventilate your home; fans go a long way, 
and so does leaving doors between rooms open.

78
Book I: Green Living 
 
 Store toxic materials away from the living quarters in your home. 
The best place to keep them is in your garage. Many people store toxins 
underneath the kitchen sink, but this is asking for trouble. Of course, the 
best bet is not to store toxic materials at all. Buy small containers and 
toss out the empties. This approach may be a little more expensive, but 
it makes sense, especially if you have kids.
 
 Pay attention to your cleaning products. A surprising number of 
household cleaners are unhealthy. When possible, use environmentally 
friendly cleaning supplies. Check out the following sources of green 
cleaning information and products:
 
• Household Products Database: www.householdproducts.nlm.
nih.gov
 
• Eco-Source: www.eco-source.com
 
• Natural Choices, Home Safe Products, LLC: www.oxyboost.com
 
• Seventh Generation: www.seventhgeneration.com
 
• Sun and Earth, Inc.: www.sunandearth.com
Avoiding Some of the Worst Offenders
We are surrounded by manmade chemicals, and most of them are quite 
benign. However, the harmful chemicals that have given their ilk a bad name 
certainly are worth weeding from your household as much as possible. In the 
upcoming sections, you find out about the chemicals within your house and 
suggestions for living without them.
Fighting off formaldehyde
Formaldehyde gas evaporates (technically referred to as outgassing) from a 
wide range of common household materials, such as
 
 Particleboard used as subflooring and in shelving, cabinetry, and furniture
 
 Hardwood plywood paneling and decorative wall coverings
 
 Carpets, draperies, furniture fabrics, and permanent press clothes 
treated to resist mold and fire
 
 Paints, shellacs, waxes, polishes, oils, and other coating materials
 
 Glues and adhesives
 
 Molded plastics
 
 Insecticides, fumigants, disinfectants, deodorants, germicidal soaps, and 
embalming fluids

79
 Chapter 5: Keeping Your Home Healthy
Book I
Green 
Living
 
 Cosmetics, shampoos, nail hardeners, mouthwashes, and antiperspirants
 
 Household cleaning products
 
 Water heaters and gas ranges
 
 Old mobile homes and prefab-style houses
 
Exposure to formaldehyde results in cold-like symptoms: coughing, runny 
nose, sore throat, fatigue, vomiting, and nosebleeds. The Environmental 
Protection Agency classifies it as a carcinogen and can also cause menstrual 
disorders, chronic headaches, and periodic memory lapses. To test for form-
aldehyde, obtain a simple testing monitor (they cost between $25 and $50; 
search for “formaldehyde monitor” on the Internet). You leave a vial open to 
your home’s interior air for a specified period of time and then cap the vial 
and send it to a lab. The lab makes the appropriate measurements and then 
mails you the results.
To avoid formaldehyde:
 
 Paint over old plywood surfaces with a water-based sealant. Old 
kitchen cabinets are good candidates for repainting, as are old paneling 
and particleboard.
 
 Check before you buy. You can usually find out how much formalde-
hyde a produce contains by consulting with the manufacturer, who is 
required to supply this information.
 
 Keep the air flowing. Formaldehyde is an airborne gas, so good ventila-
tion can alleviate the problem to a great extent. Dangers are more acute 
in the winter months when homes are closed off.
 
 If you’re buying composite wood or agrifiber products, get them with no 
added urea formaldehyde. Look on the label, or call the manufacturer.
Vanquishing Volatile Organic Compounds
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) is the name given to a class of carbon-
based gaseous contaminants emitted from a wide range of home products:
 
 Solvents used in lacquers, adhesives, waxes, cleaning agents, cosmet-
ics, paints and paint removers, and leather finishes. Common names 
are benzene, xylene, methyl collosolve, ethyl collosolve, methyl ethyl 
ketone, and trichloroethylene (TCE).
 
 Phenols found in household disinfectants, antiseptics, perfumes, mouth-
washes, polishes, waxes, glues and, ironically, air fresheners. Phenols 
are also a byproduct of combustion, so they’re more prevalent in winter, 
when the windows are closed.
 
 Aerosol sprays propelled by propane, butane, and nitrous oxide gases.

80
Book I: Green Living 
 
 Permanent press fabrics, polyesters, and most synthetic materials.
 
 Pesticides, disinfectants, pet collars, and plant food. Pesticides are by 
far the worst source of contaminants in a home, and the chemicals last 
for years. Particularly noxious are the chemicals used by pest control 
companies, which spray heavy concentrations all around the outside of 
a house and often right inside. These companies have an incentive to 
make sure that insects don’t appear, and the best way to obliterate them 
is to use more than enough chemicals.
 
 Electrical equipment containing PCBs. This material is used because it’s 
particularly fire-resistant. The problem is that when it’s exposed to fire, 
some of it burns off. That’s why whenever an electrical fire involves a 
utility company transformer, a special unit of the fire department is dis-
patched with high-tech equipment to protect the firemen. The same sort 
of contamination occurs in your home.
Avoiding VOCs
One of the easiest ways to avoid these chemicals is by not bringing them into 
your home. To do that, read the labels on the materials you buy. By law, man-
ufacturers must list the contents of their products, particularly if potentially 
noxious chemicals are in the mix.
Some prime culprits that you may want to include on your do-not-buy or 
be-careful-if-you-use list include
 
 Chlorine bleach: A component of most household cleansers. Many 
people use chlorine all the time without realizing it’s unhealthy. If you 
must use it, make sure to allow for ventilation.
 
 Oven cleaners: Particularly bad news as they outgas for a long time. Buy 
an oven with a built-in cleaning feature, and when you’re using it, make 
sure the ventilation is adequate. If you do need to clean your oven, use a 
mixture of baking soda and water and spread it around the dirty spots. 
Wait until it dries; then wipe it away. Chapter 3 of Book III gives you 
more ideas for safe, homemade cleaners.
 
 Air fresheners: These don’t freshen air. They fool your nose into think-
ing the room is fresher. They don’t remove the odor-causing problem; 
they simply overwhelm it with superior force (in many cases from 
phthalates, a harmful chemical group that you can find out about in 
Chapter 1 of this book). So now your room is completely full of swirling 
chemicals. Use an air-filter instead, or, better yet, find out what’s caus-
ing the stink and get rid of it. Unless, of course, it’s Uncle Albert.
 
 Carpet: Particularly risky, especially if it’s old and dirty. In fact, carpet in 
general is a bad idea for people who are sensitive to chemical exposures 
of any kind. Find tips for living healthfully with carpeting in Chapter 5 of 
Book III.

81

Living
 
 Aerosol sprays: Avoid them like the plague. Most household products 
that used to come in aerosol cans now come in misters, which aren’t 
quite as convenient and fun, but are much better for your family.
 
 Oil-based paints: Use latex paints with zero VOCs instead. This paint is 
easier to use and is better for your health.
 
 Art supplies: If you love to paint seascapes and gorgeous landscapes, 
find out what sorts of chemicals you’re breathing. You’re right over the 
work for extended periods, so even if the chemicals aren’t particularly 
strong, you’re dosing yourself up more than you would with just about 
any other hobby you can find. Make sure that the area you work in is 
well ventilated.
 
 Ceramics: Especially ripe for airborne abuses. If you insist on making 
ceramic artwork, do a lot of research before you partake.
 
 Pesticides: Come on now, do you really need pesticides? You may find 
insects ugly — some have thousands of legs and eyes and furry little 
tentacles. Many of them can sting and cause other problems; plus they 
fly around and distract you when you’re watching television. But the fact 
is, when you use pesticides, you’re exposing yourself to the same chemi-
cals that kill the insects. Do you think you’re any more immune to the 
assault than a bug? In fact, statistical studies have shown that the only 
difference between you and a bug is that you are bigger, although this 
size advantage may not be true in Florida.
 
 Any product that doesn’t list its contents on the label: Manufacturers 
aren’t required to list their inert ingredients, but that doesn’t mean they 
don’t contain harmful chemicals.
Minimizing the risk
Despite your best efforts, chances are you won’t be able to purge your home 
of all VOCs. In that case, you need to minimize the risk:
 
 Ventilation is imperative. Many noxious chemicals evaporate quickly, 
so exposure is only temporary. Always use glues and solvents in ade-
quate ventilation. If possible, paint outdoors and leave whatever you’re 
painting there until the paint is very dry.
 
 Store paint, fuel, and pesticides well away from human habitats. Or 
better yet, don’t store them at all. Buy what you need and no more. Even 
containers that are sealed can still leak poisons. And admit it; when you 
seal a paint can and store it, you rarely, if ever, end up using the remain-
der. Most likely it just sits on the shelf until you move.
 
 Wear protective clothing, safety goggles, and masks with appropriate 
filters when necessary. If you must use a potentially toxic chemical, 
dress accordingly. Most of the stores where you purchase chemicals 
carry the appropriate equipment and can advise you accordingly. Work 
outside whenever possible.

82
Book I: Green Living 
 
 Trust your nose; it’s smarter than your brain. In general, your nose will 
tell you when something is noxious. Trust your senses, and when in doubt, 
back off, read the label, open some windows, and start up some fans.
 
 Never eat food while working with chemicals. This just makes the 
ingestion ten times worse. Also, never eat chemicals while working with 
food — this is somewhat intuitive.
 
 Never use paint stripper indoors without ventilation. Never. You may 
just as well drink a gallon of gasoline while playing with matches to 
accomplish the same end. And you’re better off buying nontoxic, biode-
gradable paint strippers in the first place.
Eschewing asbestos
Asbestos has been used to provide heating and acoustical insulation and 
fireproofing, strengthen building materials and make them more durable, 
enhance the aesthetic value of a product, and even to make it easier to clean. 
Unfortunately, it’s very toxic.
Finding asbestos
Around the home, you can find asbestos fibers
 
 In gypsum wallboard, textured paint, joint compounds, and spackling 
compounds in older homes (pre-1970).
 
 In older homes in insulation used around pipes, as well as in the paper 
wrapped around the pipe insulation.
 
 In a lot of old appliances, which use asbestos for insulation. In par-
ticular, the seals around doors in old wood-burning stoves are almost 
always made of asbestos. As they get old and crumbly, they’re almost 
guaranteed to release fibers into the air.
 
 In siding shingles and sheet flooring, especially in older homes.
 
 In some kinds of floor tiles, particularly linoleum, which have asbestos 
backing. The presence of asbestos is not a problem until you decide to 
remodel and remove the tiles.
 
 Sprayed onto walls and ceilings for both decoration and insulation.
 
 Spun or woven into textiles, blankets, curtains, ropes, and lamp wicks.
How can you tell whether you have an asbestos issue? It’s not easy, but if 
you’re suspicious, finding out for sure may be worth the trouble. Consult 
an expert (look up “asbestos” in the phone book). Or check with the U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission (www.cpsc.gov) and the Center for 
Science in the Public Interest (www.cspinet.org).

Solving your asbestos problem
In the 1970s, asbestos was largely banned due to its correlation with certain 
types of cancer and other diseases. But fortunately, asbestos is only harmful 
when the fibers become airborne. Here’s what to do to make sure that your 
asbestos stays grounded:
 
 Simply leave asbestos products alone. In particular, don’t gouge them 
or tear them apart. It’s the same as with mountain lions: Leave them 
alone, and they’ll leave you alone.
 
 Cover them. Covering them is often better than tearing them out and 
installing new materials. For example, if you have a floor with asbestos, 
simply install a new floor over that. If you have asbestos siding, install 
new siding over it or paint it with a sealant type of paint. (Ask at your 
paint store; a number of options are available.) If you have asbestos 
insulation on pipes and it’s starting to crumble, wrap it with a new coat 
of insulation and then paint that with latex. You’ll have much better 
insulation, and you’ll have squelched the problem.
If you have to remove old asbestos products, the best bet is to hire a pro. 
Find one from a local environmental protection agency.
Burning Up with Combustion Products
If you have a gas-burning furnace, a wood-burning fireplace or stove, a gas 
cooking stove, or gas water heaters (in other words, any type of combustion 
device) in your home, you need to take extra precautions. You also need to 
be careful if you have an attached garage, where exhaust fumes may enter 
your home.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an invisible, odorless gas that’s created by com-
bustion (like carbon dioxide [CO2], its more newsworthy cousin). In a well-
designed home, chimneys and vents carry these gases away.
A smoking gun
Cigarette smoke is full of hostile chemicals. 
If you smoke, you know exactly what you’re 
doing to yourself and everybody around you, 
but consider this new angle: From an efficiency 
standpoint, smoking is about the worst thing 
you can possibly do because not only are you 
introducing health hazards into your home and 
everywhere else you go, you’re paying a hefty 
price for cigarettes at the same time.
At the very least, go outside and hide behind the 
garage or something.

84
Book I: Green Living 
CO alarms are simple, inexpensive insurance policies to warn you if CO gas 
is building up in your home. They cost between $20 and $45 and work essen-
tially the same as a smoke detector: They emit a high, shrill squeal when they 
detect high levels of the gas.
Buy an alarm, or alarms, that are UL-approved. You can get a digital type 
that plugs into your home’s electrical outlet system and has a display that 
tells you what the concentrations are in your home. (Just make sure that it 
has a battery backup in case the power goes out.) Even though the level in 
your home may be low enough for safety, you can see how the levels vary, 
and many times you can use this information to solve problems before they 
become extreme.
The best locations for CO alarms are near sleeping rooms on each level of 
your home. Position them away from drafts and solvents, which can inadver-
tently trigger a response.
If an alarm triggers, get everybody out of the house. Call your fire department 
and tell it what happened; then do what it tells you. Don’t ignore an alarm. 
Always find out why it went off and solve the problem.
Beating Back Natural Hazards
Unfortunately, manmade chemicals are not the only noxious chemicals you 
need to contend with in your home. Mother Nature has a few of her own dirty 
tricks.
Slipping through the cracks: Radon
Radon can penetrate into a home when uranium is present in nearby soil or 
rock, thereby introducing radioactivity into your home. Granite, shale, and 
phosphate bedrock under your house are the prime culprits, as well as gravel 
derived from these materials. The hazards of radon are the same as with 
exposure to any radioactive materials. Cancer is the worst.
Radon concentrates in your house — especially in basements, where leaks 
through the foundation are common. The EPA did random tests across the 
entire country and found that up to 25 percent of all homes with basements 
are susceptible to radon poisons in potentially dangerous levels. Many states 
require radon tests to be performed when a home changes ownership.

The only way to know if a home is contaminated is to test, and a number 
of inexpensive means are available, the two most common being charcoal 
detectors and alpha-track devices.
 
 Charcoal detectors: You can find these tests on the Internet by entering 
“radon testing” into your browser. You place a charcoal detector in a 
cool, dry spot in your basement for no more than a week. Then you seal 
the container and send it to a lab. You need to repeat the test twice to 
get a good result. The cost is around $10 to $25 apiece.
 
 Alpha-track devices: These tests give better results than charcoal detec-
tors, and are recommended if your home fails the charcoal test. A strip 
of special plastic material is exposed to the air in your basement; then 
you send the plastic to a lab for analysis. Alpha-track devices require a 
minimum of four weeks of exposure but cost little more than the char-
coal devices.
The good news is that, most of the time, radon infiltration can be contained 
rather easily. Two solutions exist: You can stop it from getting into the 
house, or you can dilute it once it gets in. When fresh air is imposed into a 
radon-contaminated region, the levels go down immediately. For ways to 
restrict radon entry, consult a professional or see Chapter 2 of Book II on 
sealing your home. You can also search the Internet for solutions. Enter 
“radon contamination” into your search engine. At the very least, if you have 
a radon-contaminated basement, seal the doorway between the basement 
and the ground floor of your home — a good idea in general, as you’ll also be 
preventing other airborne biological agents from entering your living area.
Operating in secret: Biological agents
Natural microscopic organisms include bacteria, viruses, fungi, molds, mildews, 
and mites — most of which are necessary for life. Pollen is a collector of spores 
from seed-bearing plants. All these can be either tracked in on shoes and cloth-
ing from the outdoors, or simply fly in on the wings of chance. And all multiply 
indoors; only some of them can cause irritations and illnesses.
 
The greatest source of nutrition for indoor microbes is the three or four 
grams of skin that flake off the average human body once every day. (Did you 
know that most of the dust in your home comes from human skin?)
Symptoms of sensitivity include the usual retinue of allergic reactions: runny 
nose, sneezing, watery eyes, sore throat, coughing, and upper respiratory 
discomfort. Hives and rashes are also common. Flu-like symptoms can result, 
including fever, chills, malaise, muscle aches, and chest tightness.

86
Book I: Green Living 
No easy-to-use kits are available to measure for microbe contamination. If your 
family seems to suffer from any of these ailments more commonly when the 
house is closed up (and wet or humid), you should do a bit of investigating.
The first place to look? Wherever there’s water. Face it, water can be a big 
problem. Especially when left standing or combined with just enough warmth 
to create an oozy stew. Microbes love damp places. That’s why the biggest 
front in your war on biological agents is in the marshes — wherever there’s 
water. The following list tells you where to look and what to do to fix the 
problems you may find:
 
 Wet carpeting is a virtual breeding ground for all kinds of nasty little crit-
ters. If you have carpet in your bathroom, replace it with vinyl or tile and 
make sure to seal the joints and edges extremely well. No carpet in the 
laundry room or kitchen, either. If you have area rugs, wash them in hot 
water occasionally or take them to the cleaners for thorough cleaning.
 
 Clothes dryers are hot and wet, perfect for microbe propagation. Make 
sure that your dryer is vented well to the outdoors. If you have a leaky 
washing machine, especially if it’s in your basement and it’s perpetually 
wet underneath, you have a microbe farm.
 
 Clean all drains once a week with hot water or white vinegar. Microbes 
love the filthy, wet environment down in a drain. If you have a drain in 
the basement that seldom sees water flushed into it, it’s a prime candi-
date for a science-fiction movie.
 
 Repair all leaks in the roof or plumbing system. Leaks generally result in 
rotting wood or sheetrock. Not only do water issues cause contamina-
tion, but they also depreciate the value of your home.
 
 Repair leaky faucets. In addition to being wasteful, every drop splashes 
and humidifies far more than you’d guess.
 
 Wet insulation materials are very fertile. If you have a leak in your roof 
or siding, you probably have wet insulation, which doesn’t work very 
well and encourages rot, mold, and infestations.
 
 If you have leaks in your grout, you have wet, oozing sheetrock some-
where beneath. You can fix leaks in grout very easily with silicon caulk-
ing. The clear stuff matches any decor.
 
 Never allow water to pool, especially in your basement. Find and fix 
whatever problem is causing the water to pool.
 
 Fix leaky toilets. They’re just asking for it. Not to mention the fact that 
you’re going to pay a lot more than you need to when you have to fix the 
rotted subflooring. And fuzzy toilet seat covers are simply nuts, if you 
value your health.

 Install a vent or a window in your bathroom. An enclosed bathroom 
with no ventilation equals microbe nirvana. You need to let your bath-
room dry out thoroughly. Failing a vent or window, use a fan and keep 
the bathroom door open when not in use. Make sure that the joints and 
cracks are sealed well.
Book IV gives you a lot of great suggestions for making changes to your home 
that improve its health.
Finding Easy Decluttering Tips to 
Improve Your Home’s Health
In an efficient, green home, there’s a place for everything, and everything is in 
its place. (That may well mean cutting back on the buying, which is a great sus-
tainable action.) Here are sundry tips to get you going in the right direction:
 
 Use the sun to clean and sanitize. Put cushions, sheets, rugs, clothes, 
and so forth out into the hot sun. To find out just how well this works, 
try putting a sweaty shirt in direct sunlight for a couple of hours. It’ll 
smell like new.
 
 Use stove vent fans. When grease mixes with dust in the air, it wafts 
around your kitchen and sticks. Over time, it makes a big mess.
 
 Avoid humidifiers, if possible. They encourage bugs and mildew.
 
 Make sure to keep a good-sized, rough mat at each door. When you 
come in, shed your shoes; put slippers by the door and change into 
them.
 
 Keep your plants healthy. Healthy plants clean the air. Fake plants are 
dust magnets, and they launch colonies.
 
 Seal the garage floor. This makes for a cleaner garage, with less dust 
buildup that would eventually make it into your home. Use a nontoxic, 
zero-VOC sealer.
 
 Wax wood. Doing so keeps moisture from permeating into the grain and 
keeps the dust down.
 
 Clean curtains without washing. Curtains don’t need to be washed. 
Instead, put them in a clothes dryer, turn the setting to no-heat, and 
tumble the dust out of them in a matter of minutes.

Energy Efficiency

In this book . . .
Just a twist of the thermostat or flip of the light switch 
away, the energy you use in your home is easy to take 
for granted. And with all that easily accessible energy, 
maybe the figures on your utility bills may come to seem 
inevitable. Far from it: Simple fixes can have a major effect 
on the amount that shows up on your utility bills.
The chapters in this part of the book show you how to 
find out where your house has room for energy-efficiency 
improvement and then how to make the changes that 
impact your energy use, including insulating your walls 
and sealing up your ducts, lighting without hogging elec-
tricity, cutting back on your water use, and ensuring that 
your appliances are operating well (or replacing them). 
You also find information about harnessing the sun’s 
power to power your home.

f you want to improve the energy efficiency of your home in an, um, effi-
cient manner, you need to first understand the economics of your overall 
consumption. When you make investments in time or money, they should be 
focused and deliberate in order to ensure good payback.
Unfortunately, most people don’t have a good handle on the specifics of how 
and where they’re using energy and other resources in their homes. As the 
saying goes, “The devil is in the details.” In this chapter, you find a detailed 
system for analyzing your resource use.
Getting a Handle on Your Energy Usage
The ultimate goal is to deduce how much you’re paying for different sources 
of energy and then tackle those costs based on what your main objective 
is. For example, your primary goal may be cost reduction as you strive for 
efficiencies, or your main objective may be pollution mitigation or energy 
conservation. In any case, you need to first consider the total resource con-
sumption in your home.

92
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Looking at nationwide statistics gives you a baseline for comparison. Does 
your own usage make sense, or can you make easy changes? Do you need 
to simply change your habits, or are you going to have to invest time and 
money in equipment improvements? Table 1-1 shows how a typical North 
American home uses energy (averaged over the course of a year). For the 
purposes of this data, a typical home has 1,600 square feet, two baths, three 
bedrooms, and 2.3 occupants in a region with moderate weather patterns.

These values represent total energy used, not how much that energy costs. 
The cost of different energy sources varies widely. For example, if you heat 
your home by chopping wood yourself and burning it in a wood stove, your 
heating costs may be almost zero, but that obviously doesn’t mean you’re 
consuming zero energy to heat your home. If you have a solar water heater 
on your roof, your water heating cost may be zero, but 21 percent of your 
energy consumption can still be attributed to heating water. The cost of 
equipment also factors into the equation. For example, you had to buy that 
solar heater, and that’s not cheap.
Focusing on your own home sweet home
Obviously, if you don’t fit the typical profile described in Table 1-1, your energy 
consumption will be different. To a large degree, personal lifestyle dictates 
energy consumption. If you’re gone all day and the home is empty, for exam-
ple, you can lower your thermostat and save. If you’re diligent about turning 
off unused lights, your lighting component will be less. If you tolerate heat and 
cold better than most, you can save on heating and cooling. And so on.

93
 Chapter 1: Taking Stock of Your Energy Efficiency and Use
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
As you evaluate how your home varies from the typical energy consumption 
numbers, spend some time going around your house, looking at all the differ-
ent ways you consume energy and resources. Just by paying more attention, 
you can learn a lot.
Where you live and the type of house you live in
Where you live has a big impact on how much energy you use. Folks sweating 
through summers in the sunny Southwest don’t have the same heating and 
cooling needs as those shivering through winters in the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan. If you’re in a hot climate, you may need very little heat, but your 
cooling bill is higher. If you’re in Alaska, your heating bill is much higher.
Different home styles also make a difference. Apartments and many condos 
have common walls, and the heat and cooling losses are less. Homes with a 
lot of windows have poorer insulation, while those that are surrounded by 
trees and natural windbreaks suffer less heat loss.
The type of HVAC you have
HVAC stands for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. Most homes have 
forced air systems, which means ducts and fans push air through the home. 
Some homes have radiant heat, and many homes have wood stoves or other 
combustion appliances.
Energy use around the world
To put the energy consumption of the United 
States in perspective, take a look at how much 
energy is used (per capita) in different countries 
around the world:
Country 
Btus Per Person Per Year
Canada 
418
United States 
339
Western Europe 
149
Japan 
172
China 
 33
Canada is cold, so its citizens require a lot of 
heat. But their high consumption also reflects 
the fact that energy is relatively inexpensive 
in Canada. When this is the case, regardless 
of where in the world it may be, there is little 
incentive to conserve or practice efficiency.
What’s more interesting is to compare American 
consumption with that of Western Europe. It 
would be very difficult to argue, as one can do 
when comparing the United States to China, 
that the large difference reflects quality of life-
style. Western Europeans, in many ways, enjoy 
better lifestyles than Americans. So why is 
their per capita consumption so low? Because 
they’ve been inculcated by high energy prices 
for so long that energy conservation and effi-
ciency are ingrained into the very fabric of their 
societies.

94
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Heating is the biggest single component of the utility budget in most homes, 
and it’s subject to the most variation in energy consumption. Thus, it pays to 
know as much as you can about your home’s heating resources. Ask yourself 
these questions:
 
 What kind of heating source(s) do you use? A wood-burning stove, gas 
fireplace, electric heat pump, baseboard heater, free-standing heater, 
radiator, and so on? Figure out how much you spend on each source 
of heat.
 
 How old is your system, and what’s its expected lifetime? In general, 
the older the system, the less efficient it is — not because old technol-
ogy is inferior, but because back in the day, people didn’t worry about 
energy efficiency as much as we do now, and paying more for an effi-
cient system just wasn’t worth it.
 
 Do you have a central air conditioner or window units? Do you use 
fans, an evaporative cooler, dehumidifiers, and so on? Include them in 
your assessment of your energy consumption.
 
As you think about your own energy consumption, look at your neighbors 
and see how their consumption differs from yours. What is the most popular 
HVAC system in your area, for example, and what are new homes in your 
area being equipped with? The answers to these types of questions can give 
you valuable information about the kind of technologies that work best in 
your region. Heat pumps, for example, work well in moderate climates but 
not in extremely cold climates. If nobody in your area uses a heat pump, 
there’s probably a good reason. And if everybody is burning wood in a stove, 
it’s probably because the availability and cost of wood is advantageous.
The people who live in your home
Heating and cooling don’t depend on how large your family is, but on the 
ways that people in your family use energy. You may have to turn the ther-
mostat lower in the summer and higher in the winter because of personal 
preference and potential health issues. If a member of your family has special 
needs, such as air filtration for asthma, for example, you should factor that 
in. If your family is very sensitive to exposure to contaminants, you’re prob-
ably paying more for filters and cleaning services.
Your water usage
Where do you get your water, and how much do you use? If a well supplies 
your water, your electric bill is larger, but your water bill is nonexistent. If 
you take long, hot showers or if your family is large, your water heating com-
ponent is higher. If you have a solar water heater, this component may be 
costing you next to nothing on a monthly basis. And if you have kids, as any 
parent can tell you, you probably wash a lot of clothes.

95

Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
The type of amenities you have
Be sure not to leave life’s little extras off your radar as you scope out things 
that consume energy around your home. For example, do you have a swim-
ming pool or spa? Pool pumps consume a lot of electricity, especially in the 
summer. Spas consume a lot of power, especially in the winter. What about a 
massive home entertainment center? These items can easily consume more 
energy than an old refrigerator, which is about the most inefficient appliance 
ever made. And if you’re charging a golf cart or powering a motor home in 
your driveway, keep in mind that they take a lot of power, too. Room full of 
aquariums? Giant gym? You get the point.
Special situations
If you’re running a business in your home, your lighting, heating, and cool-
ing costs will be higher. Your power bill may also be higher if you’re running 
heavy equipment.
Other things to think about
Many people who want to become more energy efficient do it for two rea-
sons: to save money and to save the planet. If you’re one of the many people 
interested in polluting less, add the following to your list of possible areas for 
improvement:
 
 What kind of garbage service do you have? Are there alternatives? Does 
your trash collection agency offer recycling, for example, and if so, what 
kind of recycling? You can call the customer-service number for answers.
 
 Do you have sewer service, or are you using a septic tank? If you’re 
using a septic tank, how old is it and how long has it been since it was 
serviced? If you don’t stay on top of your septic system, you may incur 
extra costs when problems arise.
 
 How much carbon and other pollutions are you producing in the pro-
cess of consuming energy in your home? If you have a cheap wood 
stove, your cost may be very low (if you cut your own wood), but your 
carbon footprint astronomical. Is this important to you? (See the sec-
tion “Calculating Your Own Carbon Footprint,” later in this chapter, for 
details on how to measure your footprint.)
 
Do you have equipment that you know is going to need replacement? Are you 
paying a lot of repair bills for a particular piece of equipment? Would you 
like to invest in improvement? Check to see whether government agencies in 
your area are offering subsidies for certain types of equipment. Your utility 
may offer subsidies, too. See Chapter 4 of Book VII for more details.

Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Figuring Out What You Spend
The best way to figure out what you spend — and where you potentially can 
cut back — is to dissect your utility bills. By doing this calculation, you get 
good data on specifically where to look for the most rewarding investments 
in efficiency.
Figuring out what you spend is basically a three-step process:
 
1. Gather all your data.
 
2. Plot it month by month.
 
3. Analyze your results.
The following sections give you the details.
Collecting the data
The first thing you need to do is collect a stack of utility bills. If you don’t 
already have them, call your utility companies (customer-service numbers 
are always listed on the bills) and have them send you copies of your bills for 
the past few years. Most utilities don’t charge for this service, and some even 
Big reasons for high energy bills
Do you have a really high bill? One that sticks 
out like a sore thumb? Here are the most likely 
reasons:
  The addition of occupants in your home
  The addition of appliances, like a freezer in 
the garage
  Faulty appliances
  High rates of outdoor air infiltration into 
your home. You may have a faulty weather 
seal on a door that needs fixing, or you may 
have a bad attic trap door.
  The use of too much electrical resistance 
heating
  Hot water leaks
  Use of appliances with large motors (pumps, 
compressors, air conditioners)
  Seasonal appliances — electric blankets, 
a dehumidifier, lots of shop lighting, power 
tools
  An estimated bill or one that reflects a 
higher time period
  A wedding or a big party
  Uncle Bill’s motor home parked in the 
driveway

do data analysis for you: They graph the data, which is much nicer than a 
load of raw numbers; ask when you call. They may even offer other services, 
such as a free home energy audit.
In addition to your utility bills (water, electric, gas, trash, and sewer), you 
need to compile a list of all the expenses associated with the resources you 
use. Here’s a sampling of what you need, but you may have other items not 
on this list:
 
 Trash runs to the dump: If you take trash to the dump yourself, estimate 
the cost by including everything: gasoline for your truck, other transport 
expenses, costs at the landfill, and so on.
 
 Manufactured logs: If you use manufactured logs, you don’t need to 
come up with receipts; just estimate how many you use and how much 
they cost. Transport and storage may also be significant.
 
 Power generator: If you bought one, how much did it cost? If you rent 
one, include the rental cost. Also include the cost of the gasoline you 
use to run it.
 
 Firewood: If you use firewood, include costs for the chainsaw, saw 
blades, transportation for firewood, and rental (or purchase price) of a 
wood splitter.
 
 Wood pellets and bio-energy products of any kind: Include all costs 
associated with these resources.
 
 Propane or natural gas: If you use either energy source, include not 
only the cost of the product, but also rental agreements, maintenance, 
and so on. A lot of people pay a yearly rental for their propane tank.
 
 Barbecue grill: Calculate how much you spend for charcoal, the pro-
pane, and the tanks. How much did the grill itself cost?
 
 Lawn tools: Include any gasoline you buy for them, as well as the gas 
canister if you bought one. If you buy gas (and/or a gas canister) for a 
generator, include those costs, too.
 
 Kerosene: If you use kerosene for lanterns, cooking, or heating, include 
those costs.
 
 Space heaters, portable air conditioners, dehumidifiers, swamp cool-
ers, and so on: If you bought any of this equipment, include how much 
it cost and estimate how much it costs to run. Check labels for power 
consumption and then estimate how much time the equipment is on and 
when.
 
 Candles and light bulbs: Add them to your list if you use them.
 
 Batteries and chargers: In some homes, batteries are very expensive, 
and most people don’t consider them a part of their power consump-
tion, but they definitely are.

98
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
 Maintenance and repair costs: These costs apply to energy equipment, 
such as a woodstove, HVAC filters, appliances, and so on.
 
 New equipment: If you bought a new water heater, new HVAC, or any-
thing else along these lines, add the replacement costs to your list, as 
well as any delivery and installation charges.
 
 Insulation: If you insulated your pipes, the cost is directly related to 
your energy consumption.
 
 Loans to buy energy-creating equipment: If you took out a loan to buy 
something like a generator or woodstove, be sure to include the interest 
on the loan as you calculate your energy costs.
 
 Permits, fees, and taxes: Some additions require permits; some up your 
taxes. You may have to obtain a county permit for installing a wood or 
gas stove, for example. Or you may pay higher property taxes because 
of a sunroom addition.
 
 Bottled water: If you drink it, estimate how much and the cost.
As you compile your list, you’re likely to find that you’re spending a lot more 
for resources than you thought, and you may be surprised by some of the 
details. You’re already moving forward!
Plotting the details, month by month
Ultimately, you need to do some month-by-month estimations. The power 
company bill is the easiest, along with water and trash. Here are some rules 
for allocating other resource costs by month:
 
 If you have a propane tank that’s filled periodically by the propane 
company, you’ll have a tough time figuring out the monthly usage. Just 
get the yearly total and divide that by 12. If you use the propane only 
for heat, allocate the cost to those months when you use heat. If you 
use some for hot water and some for heat, divvy it up as best you can. 
Double-check the total.
 
 Ditto with firewood and all the associated expenses. Most people buy a 
big stack once a year. How much did you use each month? Divvy up the 
costs as best you can and make sure that the total is right.
 
 Servicing for equipment should be allocated according to the use of 
that equipment. If you serviced a heater, allocate the cost only to those 
months when you use heat.

99
 Chapter 1: Taking Stock of Your Energy Efficiency and Use
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
 Even if your water bill is fixed, estimate how much water you used on 
a monthly basis. If possible, you should try to divide your water usage 
according to the various functions for which you use it, such as sewer, 
laundry, dishwasher, and so on. Landscaping may be the biggest water 
consumer in your household, and this fact is important to know.
For large equipment expenditures, accountants use a term called deprecia-
tion. You can use the same calculation to determine monthly costs of a piece 
of equipment. Here’s how:
 
1. Determine what you paid.
 
 Example: A gas fireplace costs $4,000 plus tax, plus another $200 for per-
mits and inspection.
 
2. Estimate how much that equipment increased the value of your home.
 
 A gas fireplace may increase the value by $2,500.
 
3. Subtract how much the equipment increased the value of your home 
from its total cost to get the net cost.
 
4. Estimate the lifetime of the equipment, in months.
 
 The fireplace should be usable for ten years, or 120 months.
 
5. Calculate the monthly depreciation by dividing the net value by the 
number of months in the equipment’s lifetime.
 
You may want to plot several years’ worth of graphs to get a comprehensive 
idea of your energy consumption. Individual years may be subject to strange 
weather patterns or one-time-only events, like a big wedding or a lot of rela-
tives visiting at Christmas. You also want to watch out for isolated events on 
your bills. If, for example, one of your monthly statements includes a one-
time deduction as a result of your electric company settling a lawsuit with 
energy providers who charged too much, you need to factor this sort of thing 
out because it has no bearing on your habits.
Keeping Up with the Joneses: 
A Real-Life Scenario
The best way to illustrate how to put all your data together is to use Bill 
Toomuch as an example. Bill and his small family live on a five-acre ranch 
in California in a 2,700-square-foot house. With the exception of a small gas

fireplace in their great room, all their energy comes from the electric com-
pany. They have an above-ground swimming pool and a hot tub. Water is 
supplied by a well. Analyzing Bill’s energy consumption demonstrates by 
example how to go about systematically analyzing your own situation.
Looking at Bill’s resource costs
Bill lists his resource costs as follows:
 
 Bill called his energy company, PG&E, and got four years’ worth of his-
tory, broken down by month.
 
 Because his house has a well, Bill doesn’t have a water bill, but the cost 
of his water supply shows up on his electric bill because the well is pow-
ered by an electric pump.
 
 The household fills a 64-gallon trash container every week. They also 
fill a 64-gallon container for recyclables every other week. Paper, card-
board, bottles, cans, and plastics are all placed into a single recycling 
bin. The cost is $32 per month.
 
 Bill uses three gallons of gasoline a month in lawn mowers, leaf blowers, 
and so on. That’s around $8 per month.
 
 Bill spends $15 per month in propane for a barbecue.
 
 The HVAC system broke down and cost $267 to fix, for a monthly total of 
$22.25.
 
 In the colder months, Bill burns liquid propane in the gas fireplace in the 
great room. His costs by winter month are
 
 Month

 March 
$65
 
 April 
$10
 
 October

(Christmas cheer!)
 
 Bill’s wife loves candles; they cost around $28 per month.
 
 Bill spends $23 per month in batteries for remotes, flashlights, sprinkler 
controllers, and so on.
 
 The house is on a septic tank, so it has no sewer. Every three years the 
tank must be pumped out at a cost of $300, which is $100 per year, or $8 
per month. Last year a repair was made at a cost of $480, which is amor-
tized over ten years at $48 per year.

Analyzing Bill’s energy costs
If you take a close look at Bill’s data, you notice a few interesting — and 
enlightening — details:
 
 The heater is on a lot in the winter, and the air conditioner is on a lot 
in the summer. The rates are higher in the summer than they are in the 
winter. Your data should look similar, unless you have unusual climate 
conditions. If you’re in a cold climate, the magnitudes of the data may be 
different, but the overall shape will be similar.
 
 You can establish your baseline usage by looking at the months in which 
you use no heating or air conditioning at all. April and October are the 
usual candidates. In the example, Bill’s approximate baseline electric 
usage is around 1,600 kWh. By subtracting each month’s total from the 
baseline, you can determine approximately how much Bill is spending 
on heating and air conditioning:

 The average American consumes around 20 kWh per day. Bill uses over 
three times that amount. His house is bigger, with a lot of extra goodies, 
but there still seems to be room for a lot of improvement.
 
 You can see how the kWh charge is higher in the summer on the seasonal 
rate structure.
Value today versus future value
Strictly speaking, when doing payback calcula-
tions, changes in the value of money over time 
must be taken into account, which basically 
means that you should discount the value today 
of a dollar you expect to receive in the future.
Suppose you have a choice between two alter-
natives: $1 today or $1 a year from now. You take 
the $1 today, of course. But how much would 
you take today for a dollar in the future? To 
determine its future worth, you need to factor 
in the current interest rate or, even more pre-
cisely, what the interest rate is going to be over 
the course of the next year. Say the interest rate 
is 6 percent. You would then be trading $1.06 a 
year from now for $1 today.
In calculating payback, it works the other way 
around. For example, if you’re going to save 
$100 a year from today, at 6 percent interest that 
$100 is worth only $94 right now. Saving $100 in 
ten years is worth only $54 today.
A good way to factor in the value of money over 
time without getting into weird math is simply 
to be liberally conservative (not conservatively 
liberal) in your estimates. The net effect will be 
the same.

Calculating Your Own Carbon Footprint
In addition to auditing your personal costs, taking a look at how much pollu-
tion you’re generating in your home is worthwhile, particularly if your main 
goal is pollution efficiency. A very common term these days is carbon foot-
print, which just means how much carbon you’re emitting into the atmosphere 
through your various energy-consuming activities. Carbon (or more precisely, 
carbon dioxide) is important because it’s the main cause of global warming.
Here’s a fact of physics: When you consume energy, it doesn’t simply go 
away; rather, it changes into some other form. Burning gasoline creates 
carbon dioxide and a thousand other pollutants. The chemical and atomic 
bonds between the molecules and atoms in the gasoline are broken down, 
and heat is released in the process. To put things into perspective, consider 
that a gallon of gasoline weighs only 6 pounds, but in the process of burning 
it in your auto engine, 20 pounds of carbon dioxide is released. This weight 
is higher than the original fuel because oxygen from the air is combined with 
the liquid gasoline in the auto’s carburetor. So the pollution that comes from 
burning gasoline weighs more than the original gasoline, and valuable oxygen 
is taken from the air and replaced with polluting CO2. The effects are much 
more robust than your intuition suggests.
Table 1-3 lists how much carbon pollution is released into the atmosphere 
due to the consumption of common energy sources.
Table 1-3

The amount of carbon pollution generated by the production of electricity 
varies quite a bit depending on the type of generators being used. States with 
nuclear power can generate as little as 0.03 lb/kWh, while regions with coal 
plants may produce as much as 2.24. The national average is 1.75.

104
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Did you know that your home is probably emitting more CO2 than your car? 
Just because you can’t see it with your naked eye doesn’t mean it’s not there. 
Consider these tidbits:
 
 A typical midsized automobile that travels 12,000 miles annually emits 
around 13,000 pounds of CO2 per year.
 
 A typical home that uses 600 gallons of home heating oil emits around 
13,500 pounds of CO2 per year.
 
 A typical North American home consumes around 700 kWh per month in 
electricity, for an emission of 14,700 pounds of CO2 per year.
 
 If you burn a cord of firewood for heat, you’re emitting around 3,814 
pounds of CO2.
Auditing Your Home to Find 
Areas for Improvement
Once you’ve finished crunching the numbers, you’re ready for the next phase 
of your home audit. (If you haven’t done the calculations, see the section 
“Figuring Out What You Spend,” earlier in this chapter.) Now you need to go 
around and carefully inspect both the interior and exterior of your home and 
identify areas where you can make improvements. Most people find that a 
majority of improvements are simple and can be done by a do-it-yourselfer 
for less than a hundred dollars.
Greenhouse effect and global warming
The best way to understand the phenomenon 
of global warming is to consider your own car 
sitting in the hot sun. Window glass transmits 
sunlight so that it enters the interior of your 
car. The sunlight then hits the seats, the floor, 
and so on and is converted into heat. The heat 
begins to build up inside the car because the 
same window glass that let the sunlight into the 
car resists letting the heat back out. Windows 
are excellent transmitters of light, but very poor 
transmitters of heat (good insulators, in other 
words).
The earth’s atmosphere operates like a window. 
It lets in sunlight very nicely, but it also has 
insulation properties. When increased carbon 
dioxide is trapped in the atmosphere, sunlight 
transmission is basically unaffected, but the 
insulation properties are increased, so more 
heat is trapped. Hence, our planet is getting 
warmer for the same reason that your car gets 
warmer when it’s sitting in the sun. The phenom-
enon is called the greenhouse effect; it explains 
why greenhouses work so well in the winter-
time (and may get too hot in the summer).

An audit helps you accomplish five key objectives, listed here in order of 
importance:
 
 Ensuring safety: Safety is the most important aspect of any home. If 
your home isn’t safe and free of contaminants, it doesn’t matter how effi-
cient it is in other regards.
 
 Maximizing your house’s longevity and durability: The biggest detri-
ment to a home’s lifetime is moisture, which only gets worse when 
ignored.
 
 Enhancing your home’s livability: Air leaks affect both the livability of a 
home and the amount of energy it takes to heat and cool a home.
 
 Analyzing the costs and benefits of making improvements: All 
improvements are not equal, and the costs and benefits depend on your 
particular situation.
 
 Creating a game plan that enables you to make your home more 
efficient: When you know what your trouble spots are, you can better 
determine which fixes take priority.
 
If you have gas-burning equipment and, like most people, are not well versed 
in the technology, hiring a professional auditor to inspect it is usually best. 
This book doesn’t give you instructions on how to inspect or adjust gas-fired 
machinery because too many different kinds exist, and they’re too dangerous 
to be messing around with.
Grunting it out: The inspection
Put on your grungiest clothes because you’re going to be climbing around in 
your basement and attic to systematically inspect your home. First just go 
around your home and carefully look at everything. You’ve probably glanced 
around before, but now you’re going to sharpen your focus. The following 
sections take you through the various areas of your home and explain what 
to look for.
Foundation and structural elements
The place to begin your inspection is outside and beneath your home. While 
you live inside, what happens outside is of critical importance:
 
 Look up into all your eaves. Are there vents? Are they dirty? Are there 
bug nests? Moisture damage (look for spots and mildew)? Is wood rot-
ting anywhere? How’s the paint job?
 
 Inspect the foundation. Are there openings or gaps? Why? Are the gaps 
sealed where pipes feed through? Are there vents? Are they dirty? Are 
there cracks in concrete or masonry walls? Are pads secure and dry?

106
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
 Underneath your house, look for moisture issues. Where is the water 
coming from? Why? Does it stink?
 
 If you have a basement, look for water leaks and air leaks. Check 
to see whether the pipes are insulated. Check for signs of pesky little 
rodents.
 
 Check out your roof. (Be very careful; falling off the roof is more common 
than you may think.) Is it leaking anywhere that you know of? What’s the 
condition? At what point are you going to have to get a new roof?
 
 On the outside of your house, inspect any spot where two different 
types of building materials come together. Are these joints sealed? Is 
there leakage?
Attic
Checking for water leaks is your first order of business in the attic. Finding 
evidence of leaks may be difficult. If you do find evidence of a leak, you may 
have trouble tracing it up to the roof where it’s coming in, but it pays to try.
You also want to pay attention to the insulation in your attic. Are there 
gaps in it? Are there voids around ceiling light fixtures? Is there evidence of 
rodents or pests? Do you see a lot of spider webs? Are there vents to the out-
side world? Are they dirty so that air has a difficult time passing through?
Plumbing
If you can, make a sketch of your plumbing system, including both hot and 
cold water pipes. Where do they go? Where are the feed-throughs? Are there 
any leaks? Are the hot water pipes covered with insulation? Are the pipes ade-
quately tacked down, or are they flopping around? Is the system old? Rusty?
After you complete this schematic, look at the following things:
 
 Are there any dripping faucets? Check both inside and out. Do the fau-
cets work the way they should?
 
 Check for clogged drains (especially in a basement floor; these are 
incredible sources of microbes).
 
 Are you aware of any plumbing problems? Toilets that don’t work the 
way they should? Shower drains that are too slow? Stinks in bathrooms, 
kitchens, laundry rooms, garages?
 
 Check under all your sinks for leaks. They’ll usually stink, and the par-
ticleboard will be moldering and warped. Where’s the leak coming 
from? Maybe the disposal is leaking. You may have to turn the water 
on to find out.

 Chapter 1: Taking Stock of Your Energy Efficiency and Use
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
Heating and cooling
Because heating and cooling costs are the biggest factor in most homes’ 
energy use, it pays to check out heating and cooling systems on a periodic 
basis:
 
 Do certain parts of your house always seem too warm or too cold? Find 
out why; if you poke around, you may be able to unearth the cause. Is 
there a draft somewhere? If you have a difficult time, consult an HVAC 
professional.
 
 Is one heater vent always too hot compared to the others? Too cold? 
Check out the ductwork to find potential problems. Most homes have 
gaps in the ductwork, and the owners don’t know it. These gaps are easy 
and inexpensive to fix.
 
 To find leaks in your HVAC’s ductwork, turn on your HVAC system 
(assuming that it’s forced air) and get access to the ducts. Chapter 2 
gives you complete details on finding the leaks in your system.
Windows and insulation
Can you find out what kind of insulation is in the walls and ceilings? How 
thick is it? You don’t need a numerical measurement, but you want to try to 
see whether it fills the voids. If you’re in an old house, you probably don’t 
have very good insulation. Also find out whether there’s insulation beneath 
your floors, particularly below the area where you spend the greatest amount 
of time (probably the family room).
Are your windows single-pane or double-pane? Do you have storm windows? 
Do you use them? Do you have blinds? Do you use them? How about solar 
screens for the summertime?
If you have a window that gets condensation between the two panes of glass, 
you have a leak in the seal. It won’t affect the window’s net insulation very 
much, but the windows will sooner or later become permanently obscured.
Filters
Check out all the filters in your home. Furnace filters are located at the input 
vent; you should replace these regularly. If you don’t, they become extremely 
dirty. Exhaust fans sometimes have filters that you may not even know about. 
Look up inside; take off the cover cowling if you need to. Dryers have lint fil-
ters. Faucets have filters that regularly collect crud. If your faucet is squirting 
around erratically, change the filter.

108
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Other places to investigate
In addition to the obvious places to look, here are some more candidates:
 
 Check out your fireplace. Is the damper working properly? (It should 
move so that it opens and closes easily.) Have you been operating it 
properly? Are any seals old and frayed?
 
 Check out your fuse box. Do you have problems with blown fuses for 
which you can’t seem to identify a reason? Are wires frayed? Is the box 
covered well? Trace some wires and try to get the gist of the overall 
layout of your home’s electrical system.
 
 Check under all appliances and sinks for moisture. Where is it coming 
from?
 
 Go through your home and check out the wattage of each light bulb. 
Note what type of bulb each is. You can probably get by with a lot less 
wattage, and in most spots you could change to a fluorescent.
 
 Look for air leaks. See Chapter 2 to find out how to find leaks.
Hiring professional auditors
If you’re not up to the challenge of auditing your own home, simply don’t 
want to, or have gas-burning equipment, you may decide to go with a profes-
sional. Several sources are available.
You can call your power company, which will probably do an audit for you 
at no or little cost. It may be a mail-in type of deal, in which case you may as 
well just struggle through it yourself because by the time you’re done compil-
ing enough information to make the mail-in audit worthwhile, you basically 
will have done the job yourself. The same applies to Internet audits. Plus, 
online resources that offer energy audits will probably try to sell you some-
thing you don’t need.
Professional audit companies will impress you with all their cool stuff. They 
have fancy gizmos that use invisible infrared light to measure the tempera-
ture of your interior surfaces, and they use them to pinpoint leaks. They 
check out your furnace, which is worthwhile. They inspect your ductwork 
and look for cracks in your foundation. They can tell you in precise math-
ematical terms just how leaky your house is.
But the fact is, the biggest inefficiencies are usually easy to detect, especially 
if you’ve never even tried before. Most houses have glaring problems that 
can usually be fixed for less than a few hundred dollars. The biggest culprit? 
Loose joints in the ductwork, which result in untold hundreds of dollars of 
wasted energy costs per year. And you can fix them up with aluminum or 
duct tape for less than $10.

109

If you do decide to hire an auditor, check out these resources:
 
 Consult NAESCO (National Association of Energy Service Companies) at 
202-822-0950 or www.naesco.org.
 
 In the phone book, look under “energy conservation services and prod-
ucts.” Locate utility companies under “electric service,” “utility provid-
ers,” or “gas utility companies.”
 
 Check out hes.lbl.gov for a free home energy audit and carbon foot-
print estimates.
As you check out different auditors, consider the following:
 
 Do you want to make a change or improvement in your home? Ask how 
this modification would fit in with the results of your audit, and ask 
for some advice. Auditors have tons of experience, and they’re usually 
proud to expound.
 
 Ask about financing programs the company has for improvements the 
auditor suggests. You may be surprised by your options.
 
 Ask about guarantees for their work. If they tell you that you can achieve 
a certain cost reduction, how accurate do they warrant that claim to be?
 
Tell the auditors before they come out to your home that you want them to 
tell you which jobs you can do yourself. If they balk, find somebody else.

ou probably spend more energy on heating and cooling than you do on 
all the other energy-consuming functions combined. This means the 
greatest potential for energy savings lies in finding ways to make your heat-
ing and cooling efforts more efficient. In this chapter, you find out how to seal 
and insulate your home.
Here is where you can find the biggest energy-efficiency improvements for 
the least amount of cash and labor on your part. Most homes have problems 
that can be fixed for $100 or less — in fact, sometimes all you need to invest 
are a little time and labor.
Finding Leaks
By knowing where to look for heat loss, you can get a pretty good idea of 
where to find the problem spots in your own home. Table 2-1 lists the energy 
losses from heating and cooling equipment in a typical North American 
home. (Note: The first table entry refers to heat escaping or coming in 
through gaps. The other entries refer to heat moving through solid masses, 
like doors, walls, and so on.)
Table 2-1 gives you a rough idea of where to look for problems and the order 
in which you should look for them. You can perform a leak test to find the 
biggest and worst offenders: air leaks through holes in sheetrock and through 
hatches or trapdoors that lead into your attic or basement. The next logical 
place to look for leaks is in your doors and windows, and so on down the list. 
(For information on how to conduct a leak test, see the upcoming section 
“Performing a pressure test to find air leaks.”)

Looking for cracks in your home
You can find most leaks by simply taking a flashlight around your home and 
looking with a keen eye. Here are some details:
 
 Look at faucets, pipes, electrical wiring, and electric outlets. Cracks 
often occur around the junctions where pipes fit through foundations 
and siding. You can fix these cracks with caulk.
 
 Check all interfaces between two different building materials. For 
example, check where brick or siding meets the roof and the foundation. 
Check where all corners meet and around the molding strips that are 
commonly used in corners of walls and between walls and floors and so 
on. Plug all holes and voids with caulk. (See the later section “Caulking 
your way to Nirvana” for caulking advice.)
 
 If icicles cluster around a particular location at your house, you have a 
leak somewhere above that’s melting snow. It warms, drips down, and 
then refreezes into icicles. If you see icicles, you usually have a pretty 
good-sized leak.
 
 Look for cracks in mortar, foundations, siding, and so on.
 
 Check for cracks and voids around exterior doors and windows.
 
 Check storm windows for seal integrity. The interior window may be 
well-sealed, but the storm window will work better if it’s also sealed 
just as well. To work properly, storm windows must fit tightly into the 
brackets. The way to ensure a tight seal is to check the weatherstripping 
materials that commonly fit into the gaps.
Performing a pressure test to find air leaks
You can perform a pressure test on your home in rudimentary fashion. You 
can hire a pro to do an audit that includes a detailed leak test, but you can 

113
 Chapter 2: Sealing and Insulating Your Home

Energy 
Efficiency
do an easy one that’s 80 percent as effective. The best time to do this test is 
when it’s cold outside and warm inside, although it will work under any con-
ditions if you have patience and tenacity.
 
Contact your utility company or state energy office to find a professional 
energy auditor. You can also go right to the phone book; look for listings 
under “energy.”
To conduct a leak test, follow these steps:
 
1. Completely extinguish any fireplace fires.
 
 Close the fireplace damper as much as possible.
 
2. Turn off your HVAC system and any furnaces.
 
 If you have a gas water heater, turn that off, too.
 
3. Close all the windows and doors in your home.
 
 Also make sure to close any skylights or vents.
 
4. Turn on all the exhaust fans in your home.
 
 These fans are normally located in kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry 
rooms. If you don’t have any exhaust fans, aim a portable fan out a single 
open window and turn it on. With the fans on, your house is depressur-
ized, so any leaks will be readily apparent.
 
5. Go around the house with a bowl of water, dip your hand in the 
water, and move your wet hand around the area you’re testing.
 
 You’ll be able to feel a leak, especially if it’s cold outside. Another way 
to do this test is with a stick of incense — when the smoke fluctuates, 
you’ve found a leak. Or you can use a candle — in this case, flickering of 
the flame indicates a leak.
 
 Test the following areas and make a list of all the areas where you find 
leaks:
 
• Test your fireplace. If it’s leaky, you’ll be drawing in some stink. If 
so, turn the fans off and inspect your fireplace to find out why it’s 
so leaky. If you can, fix it. If not, forge ahead if the smell isn’t too 
bad. If the smell is really bad, call a fireplace specialist.
 
 Fixing air leaks around your fireplace is vitally important. You 
don’t want to pull in air from your fireplace because it contains a 
number of pollutants and volatile chemical compounds.
 
• Test windows, doors, molding interfaces, attic hatches, basement 
hatches, and so on.
 
• Get a ladder or a chair and check for leaks in overhead lights. 
These leaks are very common, but they’re unfortunately a little 
more difficult to fix if you don’t have good attic access.
 
• Check AC outlets and switch plates.

114
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
6. After you’ve tested all the areas of your house, turn the fans off; then 
fix the leaks.
 
 You get details on how to fix leaks in the section “Fixing the Leaks You Find” 
later in this chapter, but here’s an important safety tip that bears repeat-
ing: If you find a leak in an outlet or switch, flip the main circuit breaker off 
to turn the electricity off in the entire house before you fix it. You’ll have to 
reset your clocks, but you’ll be alive to do it, so don’t complain.
 
7. Once you’ve finished fixing leaks, turn the exhaust fans back on and 
repeat the wet-hand routine.
 
 Your house will be tighter now, and any remaining leaks will be even 
more obvious.
 
8. Repeat the whole process until you’re satisfied.
Finding attic air leaks
Attic air leaks are quite common. Following is a simple pressurization test 
that will help you locate air leaks in your attic as well as other air leaks 
through your ceiling:
 
1. Completely extinguish any fireplace fires.
 
 Close the fireplace damper as much as possible.
 
2. Turn off your HVAC system, any furnaces, and, if you have one, your 
gas water heater.
 
3. Close all the windows, doors, and any skylights or vents in your home.
 
4. Position a portable fan so that it aims into the house through an open 
window.
 
 Now your house is pressurized (as opposed to depressurized).
 
5. Go into the attic with a bowl of water, dip your hand in the water, and 
then move your hand around potential leak sites.
 
 With a wet hand, you’ll be able to easily feel the air pushing through 
from the inside of your house. Pay particular attention to these areas:
 
• The hatch you climbed through to get to the attic. See the later 
section, “Weatherstripping,” for details on how to fix this.
 
• Recessed lights in the rooms below. Simply turn the lights on and, 
from up in the attic space, looking to see whether light is visible. If 
so, you have a leak. You can fix it by buying a kit at your hardware 
store that fits over the light from the top and seals the space.
 
• Around chimneys. If your chimney flue isn’t sealed, you likely 
have a leak here.

The good news is that most attic leaks are straightforward, if not easy, to fix. 
On the down side, most attics are a hassle to move around in, and some are 
just plain dangerous.
How heat moves
Heat is a form of energy. When a substance 
gets hotter, the molecules in that substance 
are moving faster, with more energy. When a 
substance gets cooler, heat is moving out of 
it into other nearby substances. The reason a 
hot substance can burn your skin is that heat 
moves very quickly in some cases.
Heat moves out of your home in the winter and 
into it in the summer — exactly what you don’t 
want. That’s why sealing your home is a good 
way to improve your energy efficiency. So how 
does heat move from one spot to another? Via the 
mechanisms explained in the following sections.
  Convection: In convection, heat is either 
transferred between a surface and a 
moving fluid (be it liquid, gas, or even the air 
itself), or it’s transferred by the movement 
of molecules from one point to another. 
As opposed to conduction (see the next 
item), the hot molecules themselves move. 
Convection causes hot air to rise while cold 
air gravitates downward. Most people have 
heard of convection ovens; these work by 
using a fan inside the oven cavity to move 
the air and cook food faster. Cold air pass-
ing over a window removes heat from a 
home through convection. Wind in general 
causes a lot of convection loss. But all air is 
moving because the molecules are always 
moving, so even air that seems to be still is 
capable of a lot of convection. That’s why 
convection is the most common culprit of 
heat loss in your home.
  Conduction: In conduction, only the heat 
moves, not the molecules. The material 
remains static while the energy moves 
through it. This is analogous to billiard balls, 
where kinetic energy is transferred from 
one ball to another, without moving the 
balls themselves. Heat can move through 
window glass via conduction. Window 
frames are also prone to conduction 
heat loss (particularly aluminum or metal 
frames), as are metal doors. And metal 
pipes are great heat conductors, too.
  Radiation: A hot object emits infrared radia-
tion, any form of light energy, whether vis-
ible or not. The sun is a perfect radiator. 
Fires radiate heat, some of which you can 
see (a very hot fire glows white, for exam-
ple, and as it cools down the color changes 
to orange, and then red) and most of which 
is invisible. When you can’t see the embers 
anymore but can still feel the heat, the 
radiation is entirely infrared. In fact, there 
is far more invisible radiation than visible, 
but both versions are capable of heating. 
When you put blinds over your windows, 
you are keeping radiant heat from entering 
your home. On the other hand, when you 
raise the blinds to let in winter sunshine, 
you’re inviting radiant heat.
 
 Radiation is more of a problem in the 
summer, when you want to keep your 
home cool by keeping sunshine out than in 
the winter when you’re trying to retain hot 
air (assuming you live in a climate where 
the temperature varies with the seasons). 
In the winter, you generally seek as much 
radiation heating as you can get.

Fixing the Leaks You Find
When your windows are all open, your home is basically a part of Mother 
Nature’s fantastic domain. When you shut your windows and doors, it’s 
another matter entirely — unless your house isn’t well sealed. Some win-
dows, for example, let in a lot of air, even when they’re closed. Same with 
doors. And electrical outlets can leak air as well, as can the light fixtures in 
your ceiling. Therefore, you can improve energy efficiency just by closing 
these gaps. This section gives you valuable tips on how best to fix leaks.
 
When sealing any home, be careful about indoor air pollution and combus-
tion appliance back drafts. Back drafting occurs when the various combustion 
appliances and exhaust fans in a home have to compete for air because there 
simply isn’t enough to go around. An exhaust fan may pull combustion gases 
back into the living space, for example, in which case you want to make sure 
that you’re ventilating combustion gases into the great outdoors rather than 
your home’s interior. If your home burns fuel, you can avoid back drafts by 
making sure that the combustion system has an adequate air supply. (One 
way to tell whether your home is sealed too tightly is to note whether you 
get condensation on your windows during the winter. If so, you don’t have 
adequate ventilation.)
Weatherstripping
Weatherstripping works great around doors and windows and where seals 
can’t be made permanent (as with caulking). The trick is to get the right stuff, 
and the best way to do this is to take a sample of the existing seal (if you 
have one) to your local hardware store, where the salespeople can sell you 
the appropriate new material. Foam and wrapped foam (a layer of vinyl or 
plastic wrapped around a foam core) are usually best and cheapest.
Whatever weatherstripping you buy, be sure to follow the directions on the 
label. Here are a few other suggestions to make weatherstripping a breeze:
 
 Make sure to measure how much length you need before you buy. If you 
end up with too little, don’t stretch the material: It’ll pull back over time 
and come loose.
 
 If you can, buy a kit to seal a door or window straight from the manufac-
turer of that door or window.
 
 The biggest culprits for air leaks are double-wide sliding doors, and the 
seals for these doors usually are best purchased straight from the manu-
facturers because they’re very specific to a particular style of door.

117

 If you can’t buy the same type of weatherstripping (because it’s no 
longer available, for example), have no fear. Weatherstripping is pretty 
versatile stuff. You may need to use your imagination to figure out ways 
to cut it to fit into strange spaces, in which case you’ll find that a good, 
sharp box-cutting knife is just the thing.
 
 Sometimes shutting a door or window right after weatherstripping has 
been applied is difficult, but this problem usually tapers off in a week or 
two. If it doesn’t, give it another week or two. If time doesn’t do the trick, 
get out the box-cutter and hack away.
 
 Most garage doors have a rubber seal on the bottom called an astragal. 
They’re expensive, but in some cases, astragals can make a big difference 
in your home’s comfort. If your garage is well sealed from the home, you 
probably don’t have to worry about this seal. But if you get drafts, or 
your garage is perpetually cold, changing the seal may be worth it.
Expandable foam sealant
Expandable foam sealant is great stuff and horrid stuff, all at once. Via a long, 
straw-like wand, you squirt a yellowish foamy liquid into tight spots that have 
air and insulation gaps. The foam expands and fills in the gap; then it dries, 
hardens, and solidifies. Very effective. The problem is that expandable foam 
sealant sticks to everything, and nothing works very well to get it off. So a bit 
of a mess can easily turn into a big mess.
 
If you’re going to use an expandable foam sealant, practice first in your 
garage, a barn, or an outbuilding before you try to fix anything inside your 
house. You’ll quickly figure out how — and how not — to work with it.
Foam sealant works best for
 
 Leaks between jambs and wood: Remove the trim molding from around 
leaking windows and doors, and you’ll often find an air gap between the 
jamb and the frame wood. Squirt foam sealant in the gaps, wait until it 
dries, cut off the excess with a sharp knife, and then replace the trim 
molding. Many old houses benefit greatly from this simple, cheap fix.
 
 Plumbing feed-throughs: Squirt foam in the gaps around plumbing feed-
throughs (where the plumbing goes through exterior walls to the outside 
world).
 
 Plumbing vent pipes: Squirt foam around plumbing vent pipes that pass 
through your attic.
 
 Small gaps in insulation: Squirt foam into any small gaps in insulation to 
stopper air leaks.

118
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
In general, if you can, use foam sealant instead of caulking because it provides 
both a seal and insulation.
Caulking your way to Nirvana
Caulking is fun. There’s something about squirting beads of thick, sticky goo 
that just seems to resonate with the human spirit. So get out your caulking 
gun because you can use caulk in a lot of places:
 
 Around all exterior joints that may be in contact with water
 
 Around doors, windows, decks, frames, and anywhere wind can push 
water in
 
 On horizontal surfaces where water may pool and seep in over time
 
 Wherever you think water can’t get in (because it can, and it will)
 
Buy a good caulking gun. A pro-style gun may cost $20, but it’s worth it, 
especially if you’re doing a lot of caulking. Look for larger handles, a smooth 
ratcheting action, pressure relief, and a hook on the end to hang on ladder 
rungs or rafters. An attached wire that pokes a hole in the tube’s seal is espe-
cially convenient.
You also want to use good-quality caulk. Three types are available:
 
 Acrylic (latex): Water-based and by far the most common. It skins over 
(dries on the surface) almost immediately, so you can paint it within 
minutes of applying (with latex paint, not oil-based).
 
 Silicon acrylic: More flexible (and expensive). Use this type if you’re 
caulking between two surfaces that may expand and contract with 
weather. Make sure to get the kind that you can paint, if that’s what you 
intend to do.
 
 Polyurethane: Performs better than latex but is much more difficult to 
work with and clean up. Use it between concrete, masonry, bricks, or on 
a surface that’s been painted by oil-based paints or varnish. Because it 
has better adhesion, you may also want to use it on surfaces, such as on 
roof lines, where a leak can be potentially costly.
 
All caulk is rated by years, but don’t use the amount of time you want it to 
last as a guide; instead, buy the best stuff you can afford. Fifty-year caulk 
works better than 20-year over the course of its entire lifetime. If you must 
use the cheap stuff, use it where nobody will ever see it and where you need 
to simply build up mass to fill a space or void.

119

Here are some suggestions for getting a nice, smooth bead when you caulk:
 
 If you’re a first-time caulker, practice in a place where mistakes can be 
tolerated.
 
 Cut the caulk tube ends at an angle to get a better beading action. You 
can also cut the tube ends of several tubes to squirt out different diam-
eters of material and then use the diameter which best suits the particu-
lar joint you’re working on.
 
 Don’t squirt a bunch of caulk into a wide gap because it simply won’t 
stick in there when it dries. (Caulk inevitably shrinks and cracks when 
it dries.) Use foam backer rods (ask for them in your hardware store), 
which you can jam into wide gaps between materials. Then caulk over 
the backer rods.
 
 You can use painters’ masking tape to block off surfaces you don’t want 
to get any caulk on, as well as to make nice, crisp, even lines.
 
 To get into hard-to-reach corners and tight spots, tape a flexible drinking 
straw onto the tip of your caulking gun
Inspecting and Repairing HVAC Ducts
Most of the HVAC ducts in your home send heated or cooled air into the 
house; one large duct is the return to the HVAC machine itself. All these 
ducts need to be tightly sealed. Yet, in almost every home, especially older 
ones, the HVAC duct system has some big problems: shredded insulation, 
broken junctions, holes chewed through insulation and ducts by rats and 
mice, and so on.
 
Leaks in the ductwork are worse than air leaks in your house because the 
ducts are pressurized, which magnifies the amount of air escaping through 
cracks and openings.
Fortunately, duct problems are usually easy to find and fix (although gaining 
access may be tricky). It’s amazing how many problems you can find with 
just a flashlight and a quick glance. You can also turn the HVAC on so that 
the ducts are pressurized, and find leaks with a wet hand. (Refer to the ear-
lier section “Performing a pressure test to find leaks” for instructions.) Follow 
these bits of advice:
 
 If the ducts aren’t well insulated, you can get a number of different kinds 
of insulation sealing kits at hardware stores to do the job. Tell your 
hardware clerk what kind of ducts you have (what they’re made of, how 
they’re suspended, and so on) to find the right kit.

120
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
 If the insulation around the ducts has any rips or tears, fix it. Duct tape 
works well for this chore, but it may be a real hassle. Once again, ask 
your hardware clerk what will work best.
 
 Duct tape works wonders, but it doesn’t stick to dusty surfaces very 
well. If you’ve got a dust problem, wrap the duct tape around and 
around and just cover up the dust. This approach is easier than trying to 
clean it off.
 
 If the insulation is thin, you may want to build it up. You can add a new 
layer directly over the old.
 
 Many leaks occur at the junction between the ducts and the registers 
that feed the air into your home. You can seal these leaks with caulk.
When working with dusty ducts, wearing a good-quality dust mask is highly 
recommended. You can get one at your hardware store.
Insulating Your Home
The previous sections in this chapter deal with things that are responsible for 
convection where warm (or cool) air escapes from your home through gaps. 
The other way to experience unwanted heat loss is through conduction — 
transfer through a solid material, like a window — and that’s where insulation 
comes into play. A well-insulated house is comfortable and efficient, with just 
enough moisture in the air.
 
Capacity to resist heat flow is called R-value. A higher R-value means greater 
resistance and depends on how thick, dense, and effective your insulation 
material is. County building codes have minimum R-values for homes, and 
you can review them to find out what’s right for your area. You can also get 
more information on insulation levels from your local utility, who may come 
out and do a home energy audit for you and check your insulation so that 
you don’t have to. (They usually do these audits for free, and they know what 
they’re doing.)
 
Insulation is generally an expensive fix that you should address only after 
you’ve taken care of air leaks. So if you haven’t tested your house for air 
leaks, refer to the earlier sections “Finding Air Leaks” and “Fixing the Leaks 
Your Find”; then come back to this section.
Types of insulation
There are dozens of different types of insulation schemes, but for most 
homes, only a few are practical. The vast majority of homes use fiberglass 
insulation, and most people have a good idea of what this stuff looks like 

121
 Chapter 2: Sealing and Insulating Your Home
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
(cotton candy). In distant second comes foam board, a type of insulation that 
is generally used when a home is being constructed. If you’re remodeling or 
improving existing insulation, you’ll probably use some form of fiberglass.
The following sections describe the most common types of insulation, along 
with the pros and cons of each.
Fiberglass
Fiberglass, which is made of glass fibers, comes in at an R-rating of R3 to 3.8 
per inch (thickness). Fiberglass is by far the most common type of insulation, 
and it’s what you should use if you can. It’s readily available and comes in 
spun rolls which you can easily cut and lay into place.
 
 Pros: It’s low-cost, easy to install (once you get the hang of cutting and 
placing it into the gaps), and can be pressed into place without the use 
of glues or chemicals. It comes in standard widths and is available with 
kraft paper backing, which also provides a moisture seal.
 
 Cons: It’s very irritating to your skin and lungs and is susceptible to air 
gaps. When you get big plastic bags full of it and cut the plastic packag-
ing off, it expands to three or four times the size and is difficult to move 
around and place.
Loose-fill insulation
Loose-fill insulation is chopped fiberglass material that is blown into place, as 
opposed to cut and fitted. It comes in at an R-rating of R2.2 to 4 per inch.
 
 Pros: It’s low-cost and gives much better coverage in irregular spaces 
where the one-piece fiberglass format doesn’t fit well. It can be poured 
or blown into walls and odd spaces, which makes working with it much 
easier than fiberglass.
 
 Cons: It’s messy, and the quality varies even within the same lot. It can 
shift or settle over time so that gaps may grow rather large. You can’t 
use it for under-floors without a complex web of nets, which aren’t 
worth the hassle. Depending on the size of the job, you may need to rent 
a special blower.
Extruded foam insulation
Extruded foam insulation is solid, rigid material made of the same type of 
foam as a drinking cup. It comes in flat sheets, with an R-rating around R5.2 
per inch.
 
 Pros: It’s high-strength, easy to tack up, covers well, and works under-
ground and in wet basements. It’s good for covering a house and then 
tacking up siding over it.
 
 Cons: It’s very expensive and needs to be covered up with siding.

122
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Sprayed urethane foam
Sprayed urethane foam is held in a metal container, under pressure, and then 
force sprayed onto walls where it sticks. It comes in at an R-value between R6 
and 7.3 per inch.
 
 Pros: It forms a tough, seamless barrier that seals well over all types of 
surfaces, especially irregular ones.
 
 Cons: It must be professionally installed, and it needs to be covered up.
Checking and fixing your 
home’s insulation
Visually check insulation wherever you can. Most gaps will be readily evi-
dent. Also look for spots where water has damaged insulation, or spots 
where the insulation is very thin. Small problems, such as gaps or voids in 
your insulation, usually occur around light fixtures and where somebody 
(like an electrician or plumber) has been working and pushed it aside. You 
can fix these voids by hand tucking some loose insulation into the gaps.
If you find your insulation wholly inadequate, you’ve got a big decision on 
your hands. Putting in new insulation is expensive — the payback time may 
seem far off. But if you don’t, you’ll continue to waste money and leave a big 
carbon footprint.
 
If you’re on a limited budget and want to make the biggest difference for the 
least cost, insulate your family room (or the room you spend the most time 
in) first. In particular, if you don’t have any insulation under your family 
room floor, adding insulation there is usually easy to do and doesn’t cost that 
much. You’ll get the biggest bang for your buck.
The following list outlines the different areas to check and explains how to 
remedy the problems you may find.
 
 Attic: Insulation makes the most difference in the attic simply because 
heat rises. If no heat can leak out of your home through the attic, your 
home is very well sealed. The easiest thing to do is have the insulation in 
the attic thickened. You can do this task yourself (use a dust mask at all 
times), or you can find a company to come in and spray loose fill insula-
tion. Unfortunately, when the insulation in your attic is substandard, it’s 
most likely also substandard in the walls.

123
 Chapter 2: Sealing and Insulating Your Home
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
 Completely seal up the attic for air leaks from the home before you apply 
insulation because once the insulation is in place, taking care of attic 
leaks is much more difficult.
 
 Walls: Substandard insulation in your walls isn’t as easy to remedy as 
substandard insulation in your attic. The best bet may be to simply 
put new siding on the outside of your house. You can get good-looking 
siding with great insulation properties, and at least when you spend 
money in this way, you can accomplish a visual remodel as well.
 
 Basement: If you have a basement, check to see whether the ceiling is 
insulated. If not, putting in insulation is a relatively easy job, probably 
even easier than working in your attic. If you need to insulate a base-
ment, it’s usually best to use foam sheets and then cover them with 
sheetrock. You can either glue the sheets directly onto the concrete 
basement walls, or build a wall up with 2 x 4s, which will make the room 
smaller.
 
 Pipes: Hot water pipes should be well insulated. You can eyeball them to 
see where they aren’t, or you can feel the pipes (after you’ve turned the 
hot water on in the house for a minute or two) to determine which pipes 
are for hot water and which ones are for cold. A number of easy options 
work well for insulating pipes, the easiest being a three-foot-long foam 
section with a longitudinal slit. You simply slide the piece over the pipe, 
and you’re in business. Ask about your options at the hardware store.
Tips for applying insulation
Putting in insulation isn’t particularly difficult, but it can go more easily if you 
keep a few things in mind:
 
 With fiberglass insulation, wear a one-piece jumpsuit, along with a 
face mask and gloves, and make sure that ventilation is adequate 
before you begin. You don’t want to breath a lot of fiberglass dust, and 
you don’t want to get it on your skin because you’ll be scratching up a 
storm. Also, in old attics, the dust that collects on insulation can be very 
nasty. Try not to disturb it, if possible.
 
 Fiberglass insulation is itchy. Some versions come with plastic covers 
to reduce the risk of itch – if you’re really sensitive, look for them.
 
 Apply insulation carefully and evenly. Fill entire cavities, but be care-
ful not to cover up vents or other means for attics and basements to 
breathe.

124
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
 When you come across electrical wires, arrange half of the insulation 
in front of them, and half behind. You will have to tear the insulation 
open, but this technique works much better than leaving big air gaps 
without any material at all. If you leave a gap unfilled, you’re wasting 
money. Filling only 80 percent of a cavity prevents only 20 percent of the 
heat loss.
 
 Always buy the right width and thickness to fill spaces. You don’t want 
to piece insulation together to fit a space if you don’t have to, because 
you risk creating air gaps. Still, you can press fiberglass insulation tight 
into narrow gaps and cracks, and it will perform better than nothing at 
all. (Using expandable foam is best, but it may not always be practical, 
and it’s not worth a lot of extra hassle.)
 
 Compressing insulation reduces its R-value. (Check out the section 
“Insulating Your Home” to find out more about R-value.) When you 
squeeze it down to make it fit into gaps, you’re accomplishing the oppo-
site of what you intend. You’re actually reducing the effectiveness of the 
insulation. So press it down only when necessary.
 
 You can get one-piece seals for plugs and switch outlets for about $4 a 
dozen at your hardware store. Simply remove the plastic cover, set a 
seal into place, and replace the cover.
 
 If you have moisture problems in your home, you may want vapor 
barrier facing on the insulation. (It comes prefaced on some versions, 
so look for that type when you buy.) It doesn’t cost much more, and it 
makes the insulation easier to work with to boot.
 
Use hedge shears to cut insulation, not a knife.
Insulating old homes
In some old homes, it pays to blow loose fill 
insulation into the walls. Normally this works 
when the existing insulation is so poor that air 
gaps are more common than insulation. Sound 
absurd? It’s a lot more common than you think. 
Some homes have no insulation at all, like the 
old homes back east. Energy was so cheap (ah, 
the good old days) that insulation was not cost-
effective.
Having a pro do an energy audit of your home to 
get a second opinion is a good idea. If you decide 
to go ahead, you’ll need to rent a blower, which 
will come with detailed instructions. You’ll need 
to cut a number of two- or three-inch-diameter 
holes through your exterior siding so that the 
blower head can get into each individual cavity 
between the beams.
A better way may be to simply cover your home 
with insulation sheets, and then cover that with 
new siding. This way, not only do you get the 
added insulation, but your home also gets a 
nice facelift.

Working with Windows
Of all the investments you can make in your home, windows have the poten-
tial to make the most impact. Not only do they provide insulation (and seal-
ing), but they also affect the aesthetics like nothing else in your home. But 
installing new windows is very expensive, maybe one of the most expensive 
projects you’ll ever take on. A typical residential window costs anywhere 
from $150 to $400, plus another $100 to $300 for professional installation. And 
you can easily spend a lot more than this amount.
 
If you have very poor insulation in your home and you’re looking for the big-
gest bang for your buck, you’re better off improving the insulation before 
buying new windows. See the earlier section “Insulating Your Home” for 
details on insulation.
Single pane windows may be a huge factor in your energy bill. With homes in 
mild climates, the number of panes doesn’t matter much. However, if you’re 
living in extreme climates, single pane windows are almost always worth 
upgrading to double- or triple-pane options. Besides, single pane windows 
are always old, and you can buy something better looking.
You don’t need to change all the windows in your house to make a significant 
improvement. One single, large window in a family or living room may make a 
big difference in both energy efficiency and aesthetic beauty.
 
You can put up heat-sealing cloth barriers in the summer or storm windows 
in the winter, and both of these solutions are much cheaper than changing 
windows.
Before you replace windows, take your time researching all the options. Visit 
some window stores and check out the different types, like wood, plastic, 
fiber, and so on (you’ll probably be confounded by the variety) and get a 
number of bids. In particular, pay attention to the following:
 
 Glass: Ask about different types. Some glass selectively filters sunlight 
for UV; some has low-emittance coating to increase the window’s insula-
tive powers.
 
 Appearance: Does the style blend in well with your existing home 
decor? Do the colors match your home, or are you going to be painting?
 
 You can get windows that require paint so that they’ll match anything, 
but you don’t want to because every five years you’ll have a big, tedious 
job. (Painting windows is very time-consuming. You can’t just roller — 
or even spray — it on.)

126
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
 Cleaning: Are they easy to maneuver so that you can clean them? A lot 
of new window designs enable you to clean from the inside, which is 
particularly handy for second-story windows.
 
 Operation: Are the windows smooth and easy to open and close? It pays 
to invest in quality bearings and movements. No one wants to have to 
remember a complicated schematic just to let in a little summer breeze.
 
 Maintenance: Where are you going to get parts when you need them? If 
you choose wood (and it is fairly energy efficient), you have to paint it 
regularly unless you choose clad wood, which is coated with aluminum.
 
 Warranties: The seal between double-pane glass inevitably gives out, so 
make sure that you understand who is going to pay for this expensive 
repair.

ost homes have both heating and cooling systems. Together, these items

Understanding Human Comfort
Human comfort isn’t simply determined by room temperature, but by a vari-
ety of other factors as well, such as air movement, humidity level, and so on. 
Yet most people still erroneously think that the best way to make a room 
more livable is to set the desired room temperature on the thermostat. You 
can do much better if you’re willing to apply some tricks and change a few 

128
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
habits. This section explains the factors that affect how comfortable a room 
feels and offers a few pointers on how to exploit these factors so that you can 
use your HVAC less frequently but maintain — or even enhance — the com-
fort level in your home.
Getting air moving
In summer, people like the feel of air moving over their skin. Just the phrase 
“summer breeze” generates a cool sensation. Even a warm breeze on a hot 
day can cool things down. That’s because it’s not air temperature that’s 
important, but the actual temperature of your skin. Moving air removes heat, 
so skin temperature goes down.
Fans move air and, in the process, cool you down. They don’t change the air 
temperature (if anything, they make the air hotter), but their effect is still 
pronounced. Fans, like breezes, cool by convection. You can make a room 
more comfortable just by installing fans to improve the ventilation.
 
Don’t use fans when no humans are present, because all fans do then is 
heat up the air. Fans don’t cool a room; they just make the people in it feel 
cooler — there’s a difference.
The lowdown on portable heaters
Portable heaters are heaters you can move 
around to wherever you like. You see them 
underneath people’s desks at work when the 
boss is a miser. If your HVAC system isn’t work-
ing consistently from room to room, a portable 
heater may be just the thing.
But here’s what’s quirky about most of them: 
They come with fans that move air over a resis-
tance coil. If the fan wasn’t moving the air, the 
coil would get really, truly hot and probably burn 
up, which is clearly not something you want in 
your home (unless you want to collect on your 
fire insurance). The fan also tends to make you 
feel a lot cooler. So with traditional portable 
heaters, a conflict exists between their pur-
pose (to generate warmth) and their design (the 
inclusion of the fan, which cools you down).
The best bet is to use a radiative type of heater, 
which uses parabolic reflectors with a heat-
ing element at the focal point, or something 
akin to this setup. These heaters spread heat 
by radiating it rather than by convection, which 
is the way a portable heater with a fan works. 
Radiation heaters are also more efficient, and 
they feel more natural because they’re supply-
ing heat the same way the sun does: through 
radiation.
Remember, though, that either type of heater 
is dangerous if used incorrectly, and in no 
case should a portable heater be used around 
children.

Helping or hindering: Humidity
On humid days, people feel much hotter than they do on less humid days, 
even if the temperature is the same on both days. Why? Because humid air 
doesn’t carry heat away from your skin nearly as well as dry air does.
For this reason, equipping your home with a dehumidifier that you use in the 
summer can make the air feel much cooler. As a bonus — and one that’s par-
ticularly relevant to this book — dehumidifiers are much cheaper to operate 
than air conditioners, so they save money. Conversely, in the winter you want 
humid air because your skin can draw heat more readily from it than from 
dry air. In the winter, people don’t want to feel moving air from fans because 
that removes heat.
 
Sweating is your body’s way of eliminating heat and cooling itself down. 
Many people think the evaporation of sweat is the key, but that’s only a small 
part of it. The truth is, water holds much more heat than air does; sweating is 
your body’s way of expelling this hot water. In other words, the sweat itself 
cools you down — if you can get it off your body. (Otherwise, sweating just 
moves the hot water from in you to on you.) That’s where evaporation comes 
in and why humid days feel hotter than dry ones. When it’s humid, the air is 
already full of water and simply can’t hold any more, so sweat doesn’t evapo-
rate. It just hangs around, making you feel sticky and hot. (Contrary to the 
way it may feel, you don’t actually sweat more on humid days.)
The following sections tell you how to keep humidity levels comfortable 
throughout the year.
In the summer
Use a dehumidifier in the summer. Keep the filter clean and try placing it in 
different rooms to get the maximum effect. The best bet is to place it in your 
family room (or wherever your family congregates the most). Other things to 
keep in mind include the following points:
 
 Clothes dryers absolutely must be vented to the outside world. Your 
dryer is the single biggest source of humidity in a home. If you use a 
clothesline to dry things (such as delicate garments) and you can’t put it 
outdoors for some reason, put it in the garage, not inside the house.
 
 Install exhaust fans vented to the outside in all bathrooms, the 
kitchen, and the laundry room. Use them when you’re showering or 
cooking to get rid of humidity in the summer. You can even install a 
humidistat to turn the vent fans on when humidity levels exceed a cer-
tain threshold.

130
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
 When you use a vent fan with the whole-house air conditioner on, crack 
a window near the vent fan. The fan will draw its air from that location 
instead of the cool air from the house.
 
 Don’t put carpet in the bathrooms. It sucks up moisture and then 
releases it all day long, producing a musty smell through the entire 
house as well as mold and mildew.
 
 Don’t allow water to pool in your basement. Use a sump pump or find 
another way to get rid of it.
 
 Ventilate your attic and basement. Ventilating these areas lets fresh air 
in and reduces humidity.
In the winter
Use a humidifier in the winter. Doing so lets you decrease the load on your 
heating system. (You don’t need to turn the heat on nearly as much to main-
tain comfort levels.) You can make a humidifier by simply hanging clothes to 
dry in your bathroom — but keep the door open — or by setting up a drying 
rack in any room.
 
In the winter, don’t use vent fans in the kitchen. You want both the humidity 
and the heat that you generate when you cook.
Capitalizing on the chimney effect
Heat rises. That’s why your house doesn’t fill with smoke when you’re burn-
ing wood in the fireplace. When a fire is burning in your fireplace, cool air 
from the room is drawn in and the oxygen combines with the biomass in the 
firewood to create a flame. The heat from the flame moves up into the flue 
and out the chimney (unless something is preventing it, like a home that is 
too tightly sealed or a closed damper). Hence, the term chimney effect.
In the same way, hot air rises within the confines of a single room. The tem-
perature of the air near the ceiling is always higher than that at the floor. If 
you live in a two-story house, you may notice that the upstairs gets hotter 
than the downstairs — that’s because of the chimney effect.
 
Heat rising is a passive effect; you don’t need a fan to make this air move. 
Passive effects are the absolute best when you’re looking to maximize effi-
ciency because they’re essentially free. To take advantage of them, you just 
need to exploit physics. So how do you take advantage of the chimney effect? 
In these ways:

131
 Chapter 3: Maximizing Your Heating and Air-Conditioning System
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
 Install ceiling fans. Depending on whether the blades push air up or 
down, ceiling fans can move heat either up into the ceiling, thereby 
making the ground level cooler, or move heat down (in the winter). With 
the flip of a switch, you can change the blades’ direction.
 
 Adjust your registers. During the winter, adjust the registers in your 
home so that much more heat enters the downstairs than the upstairs. 
The chimney effect evens out the heat in your home very nicely. During 
the summer, do just the opposite: Open the upstairs registers and let 
the majority of cool air enter there. Over the course of the day, the cool 
air will gravitate down to the lower floors.
Going for the greenhouse effect
Why does a greenhouse get so hot when the sun is shining? The answer is 
found in the greenhouse effect. Essentially, sunlight transmits through the 
greenhouse’s glass walls and is converted into heat on the interior surfaces 
of the greenhouse. The same glass that transmitted the radiation into the 
greenhouse serves to insulate that heat from getting back out into the great 
outdoors. The same effect causes cars to get hot when they’re sitting in 
harsh summertime sunshine.
To take advantage of the greenhouse effect, follow these suggestions:
 
 Open all your blinds when you want to heat your home and the sun is 
shining. Blinds prevent sunlight from entering, so you can’t exploit the 
greenhouse effect when they’re drawn.
 
 Blinds work very well for insulating, so close them whenever you 
need to retain heat or cool air. In general, closing your blinds at night 
is always a good idea. Close them on cold winter days, when the sun is 
dull, to make your heater work more efficiently (by increasing the insula-
tion of your home).
Making more small changes 
for even bigger benefits
 
One of the best ways to reduce your energy costs is with a programmable 
thermostat. Installing one is a great do-it-yourself project, and it costs less 
than $100, in most cases.

132
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Find a unit compatible with the equipment you have in your house. Consult 
your owner’s manual to find out what types are compatible, call a heating 
and air specialist, or ask at your hardware store. Make sure to get one with 
easy-to-understand instructions. Avoid thermostats that seem complex to 
operate because that’s an indicator that the design just isn’t a good one. It 
doesn’t have to be complex.
Available options include the following:
 
 A reminder when it’s time to change the filter
 
 The option to automatically change programs between heating and cool-
ing seasons
 
 A low-battery indicator
Most homes don’t need every room to be maintained at the same tempera-
ture. In general, rooms where you don’t spend a lot of time or that tend to 
warm up or cool down quickly (because of size or design) are good candi-
dates for blocking off. Bathrooms, for example, don’t need HVAC very much 
at all, nor do laundry rooms. The following list shares advice on how to vary 
the temperature of different rooms:
 
 To block off rooms, close the registers and the door. You can further 
seal the room off from the rest of the house by laying an old towel 
across the threshold at the bottom of the door. But don’t overdo it. 
Closing more than one out of every five vents may cause your furnace to 
work too hard.
 
 Use window air conditioners to cool rooms individually. A portable 
air conditioner is much cheaper to run than a big, whole-house unit. 
Perhaps you need to cool only your family room or a single bedroom 
upstairs so that your sleep will be more comfortable. (Note, however, 
that the thermostat that controls your system needs to be in a room 
that isn’t blocked off!)
 
 Heat a single room using portable heaters. If you set up a couple of por-
table heaters in your family room, for example, you may not need to turn 
on your whole-house system at all. Just don’t use them while you sleep.
Here are other ways you can reduce your energy costs while maximizing your 
comfort:
 
 Use your grill more. If possible, do all your summertime cooking out-
doors. Gas barbecues are the most efficient and convenient, which may 
motivate you to cook outdoors more often.
 
 Adjust the lighting. The human mind is subliminally sensitive to cer-
tain sensory effects, one of which is lighting tone. A harshly lit room 
makes people feel hotter. A shady, dull room makes people feel cooler. 
Candlelight makes people feel warmer. You get the idea.

Solving Some of the Most Common 
Inefficiency Problems
In order for any system to be efficient, it needs to be running well and 
smoothly. Sometimes, though, problems creep up that can decrease the 
performance of the system, especially HVAC systems. If your existing HVAC 
equipment isn’t working the way you think it should, here are some of the 
most common problems that you can solve yourself.
 
If you have a combustion system, have an HVAC pro inspect and tune your 
equipment every few years. It pays as these systems are prone to carbon 
buildups and other soot issues that can drastically affect their performance. 
Heat pumps can work nicely for a decade without being serviced, as can solar 
water heaters, space heaters, and so on.
Restoring air flow
To work at their peak efficiency, HVACs need adequate air flow. That means 
that the filters must be clean, and the airflow path must be unobstructed. 
When air flow is obstructed, the machine basically uses up the same amount 
Window air conditioners for a single room
If you’re buying a window air conditioner, get 
one with a Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating 
(SEER) between 10 and 17. The higher the 
rating, the more efficient the air conditioner is. 
Check with your utility company to see whether 
it offers rebates for units with high SEER num-
bers. It may have a list of recommended units 
you can get at a discount.
You can also buy a stand-alone unit that sits on 
wheels and move it around your home as you 
see fit. You can use it in the family room during 
the evening hours and then push it into your 
bedroom when you sleep.
When you install your air conditioner, put it in 
the shade. The cooler it is, the more efficiently 
it will run.
Fortunately, you can easily do the maintenance 
yourself:
  Clean the fins, evaporator coil, fan, con-
denser fins, and tubes. Be sure to unplug 
it first and don’t make a big mess. You can 
use a jet spray to clean out the fins.
  Air conditioners also have filters that get 
clogged. You can replace these inexpen-
sively, or you may be able to vacuum the 
dust and debris from the filter material.
  Buy a cheap fan comb to straighten bent 
fins. Using the comb to straighten the fins 
out can make a big difference in the unit’s 
efficiency.

Book II: Energy Efficiency 
of power but does less work for that power, and so it has to be on longer to 
get the same job done. You waste energy, and your house is noisier to boot. 
Following are some of the most common problems impeding air flow:
 
 Blockage in the air ducts: Construction debris sometimes falls into the 
ducts, as do kids’ toys, carpet segments or pads, and so on. Small items 
are easy to remove. Larger items can be more of a problem; you may 
need to pull the duct from the register either from underneath the floor 
or from the other side of the wall.
 
 Blocked registers: Something may be sitting over a register, such as cur-
tains, drapes, furniture, toys, or decorations. You may not even realize 
that the register is closed off. Or maybe the air is flowing freely, but it’s 
headed in the wrong direction. You may be able to add a plastic reflec-
tor to aim the air better into the living quarters.
 
 Loose joints: To repair joints, use aluminum tape rather than duct tape. 
Wear a face mask to protect yourself from the dust, or you’ll be sorry 
about an hour later.
 
 Dirty coils, fins, and filters: You can take the outer cover off of your 
condenser unit and jet spray the fins to remove debris and crud buildup. 
If you’re still not sure whether enough air is passing through, get your 
system inspected.
 
 A blocked return air path: A forced-air system can’t heat a closed-
off room. You must crack the door open or cut an inch or two off the 
bottom of the door so the air has a gap to move through. Louvers work, 
but they’re difficult to use and neither cheap nor easy to install. If you 
absolutely need to close off a room, look into a portable heating or air-
conditioning unit for that room.
 
 Too many bends in the ductwork: When this is the case, air has a diffi-
cult time passing through. Not only are you not getting much air through 
the maze-like ductwork, but the air you are getting is expensive (because 
the machine has to work harder to push the air through all the turns). If 
you can’t change the ductwork, consider installing a portable heater or 
air conditioner and simply closing off the inefficient ductwork entirely.
Repositioning the thermostat
Your system’s performance is governed by the location of the thermostat. 
The temperature you set is maintained wherever the thermostat is located. 
Sometimes systems work poorly because direct sunshine hits the thermostat, 
resulting in a temperature reading that doesn’t accurately reflect the actual 
temperature of the room. If the thermostat is located directly over a heating 
duct or in a remote corner of the house, its temperature isn’t indicative of the 
house in general. A well-designed system has the thermostat near the center 
of the home, usually near the air intake vent.

You can have your controller moved, and sometimes doing so is cheap and easy. 
Or you may be able to find one that uses a remotely located temperature sensor. 
The latter works well unless your kid takes it to school for show-and-tell.
When Your HVAC’s on the Blink
Something’s wrong. Your house isn’t staying as warm or as cool as it should, 
even though you’ve taken steps to maximize your HVAC system’s efficiency. 
What do you do? Well, if you’re like many people, you curse the Fates 
(because these things tend to break down on either the coldest day of the 
winter or the most searing day of the summer) and then call in the HVAC 
repair pros. But before you do, make sure that you really need their exper-
tise. While some problems definitely need the attention of an HVAC expert, 
other problems are relatively easy to fix yourself.
What to check before you call a repairman
You know that your wallet is going to take a hit as soon as you call in a pro. 
So when your system is down, check out these things first. If you’re lucky, 
you may just solve your own HVAC problem:
Different kinds of HVAC filters
The most expensive problem you can encoun-
ter with your HVAC system happens when 
either the filter or the fins get clogged up, in 
which case your machine runs, but little or no 
air passes through. Changing filters prevents 
both filter and fins from clogging. When buying 
filters, keep these things in mind:
  Fiberglass filters are woven and often blue, 
and they’re the cheapest filters you can 
get. If you buy them in bulk, they’re even 
cheaper, and you’ll change them more often 
as a result. These only screen out debris 
that could damage your unit. Large dust gets 
through, as well as mold, mildew, toxins, 
and so forth. This may or may not matter to 
you. If you open your windows a lot, a high-
tech filter on your HVAC input isn’t going to 
change the average air quality in your home 
enough to merit the extra cost.
  Pleated paper filters have smaller porosity 
(so they filter smaller particles), as well as 
much greater surface area so they don’t get 
clogged as fast. Use these if you only want 
to change the filter every three months or 
so. They’re worth twice the cost, if you 
change them one third as often.
  Electrostatic filters get rid of smoke resi-
dues, allergens, and asthma-causing agents 
($20 to $45 and up). Be aware, however, 
that simply installing these does not remove 
all particles from the air. You need to be 
using your system a lot to get the effect. 
You also need supplementary systems like 
air purifiers.

136
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
 Check the thermostat and make sure that it’s on. Fiddle with it, moving 
the temperature up and down. Give it a little time — an hour or so — 
because sometimes fail-safes (timers, clocks, and so on) go off.
 
 Check breakers at your main panel. Often when servicemen are called 
out, it’s not the HVAC that’s down, but the circuit panel, in which case 
you’ve wasted money on a call. Many furnaces also have an on-off switch 
somewhere on the chassis. Somebody (kids . . . ) may have flipped it off, 
so check to make sure that it’s on.
 
 Change the filter. HVACs need flowing air to work properly. It’s amaz-
ing how many times servicemen are called out only to discover that the 
filter is totally clogged up. They don’t mind; they love to charge $80 to 
change your filter. But you can do it for much less.
 
 Make sure that the gas is on. (Or if you have a tank, make sure that it’s 
not empty). Check all the valves by closing them and opening them back 
up. This check may not seem like it makes any sense, but valves can 
stick, and by opening and closing them, you may be able to get the fuel 
flowing again.
 
 Check to see whether the chimney exhaust flue is clear. Checking the 
flue may or may not be an easy thing to ascertain because many chim-
neys meander back and forth, like an accordion. In other cases, you just 
plain can’t see up into that dirty, black hole. If in doubt, call for service.
 
 Make sure that the line that drains water isn’t clogged. Many furnaces 
drain off several gallons of water per day in heating season. If the line 
becomes clogged and the water can’t drain properly, the furnace shuts 
down due to a fail-safe switch. If the drain hose looks dirty, remove it, fill 
it with a mixture of bleach and water (30 percent bleach to 70 percent 
water), wait 15 minutes, and flush it.
 
 Look for blocked or leaking ducts. The big ones going into the furnace 
from the house/filter port are especially problematic. If you can get to 
the ducts, you can usually fix them yourselves (see Chapter 2 of this 
book). Or you may need to contact an HVAC pro. (If you do, have them 
do a complete inspection.)
 
 Clean the outdoor equipment. Remove debris like leaves and twigs 
from fins or intake and exhaust ports.
Symptoms that call for a pro
If your HVAC is exhibiting any of the following symptoms, you need the help 
of a professional HVAC repairperson:

137
 Chapter 3: Maximizing Your Heating and Air-Conditioning System
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
 Short cycling, or going off and on a lot: When the thermostat is out 
of adjustment or the internals are out of balance, a fail-safe shuts the 
system off. Turn it off and get it repaired.
 
 Irregular flame from the burners: An irregular flame indicates a prob-
lem with dirty burners or a cracked heat exchanger. The flame should 
be nice and even over the entire burner surface. Many times you can tell 
at a glance whether your burners are running optimally.
 
 Strange sounds like rumbling, clicking, and so on: Hearing these 
sounds are okay in hot-water or steam-heating systems, but in a furnace 
with a forced-air system, they’re a sign of trouble.
 
 Inexplicable illness in your family: You may have a combustion leak 
somewhere in the system. Call a pro right away. Get a carbon monoxide 
alarm right now and use it.
 
 Sooty accumulations: Deposits usually appear near where the flame 
is burning. A good clean burn leaves very little residue, and it appears 
more brown than black. Sooty black grunge, on the other hand, is a sign 
of incomplete burning — you’re not getting all the heat you could be out 
of your fuel — and you’re paying for the inefficiency. Plus, you’re going 
to have to clean the soot out of the system, which can be costly.
Buying a New System or Supplementing 
the One You Have
If your HVAC system is old, it’s probably inefficient compared to newer tech-
nology. You’re likely to be disappointed with your system’s performance. 
Maybe it doesn’t cool the house well enough in the summer, or it’s on all the 
time in the winter and the air isn’t hot enough when it comes out. Or perhaps 
you’re getting tired of the twice-a-year service call, in which case you need to 
add these costs to the payback analysis.
If you’re thinking about replacing your current HVAC system, your best bet 
is to call an HVAC service company and have them come out and analyze 
your equipment. They can tell you how much better new equipment will 
perform (although you should keep in mind that their motive is to sell new 
equipment). Armed with this information, you have a payback decision on 
your hands. You’ll be saving a certain amount of energy per year, which you 
can translate into cost. What you’ll probably discover is that, because HVAC 
equipment is expensive, you’re not likely to get a payback in less than 20 
years, which is a dubious investment.

138
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
Before you spend the big bucks, first try all the little things in this chapter 
and in Chapter 2 of this book. If you still decide to change, take your time. Do 
your research and get at least three quotes.
 
One of the best bets is to install a high-efficiency gas fireplace in your family 
room or living room. You can use the gas fireplace to heat the room locally, 
which means you won’t be heating your entire home.
Hiring an HVAC Contractor
Whether you decide to replace your existing HVAC system with a brand-new 
one or supplement the one you have with additional heating and cooling 
equipment, you need to hire a contractor. Every contractor uses a standard 
contract and follows approved practices. Contractors can
 
 Obtain permits.
 
 Manage the schedule and get the parts when they’re needed.
 
 Deal with all the inspections, and assume responsibility for a failed 
inspection.
 
 Solve problems quickly and efficiently.
To find potential contractors, your best bet is to ask friends who have the 
same kind of system you want to install for referrals (or warnings to stay 
away, as the case may be). You can look contractors up with the Better 
Business Bureau, or you can get information from state regulatory agencies. 
The Internet contains a lot of referral sites, but beware — these recommen-
dations may be paid for by the contractors themselves. Enter the name of 
your city or county and the kind of project you want to do.
 
Never use a family member or friend. You may think they’ll give you a better 
price (they’ll probably be thinking they can charge you more since there won’t 
be competitive bids) and better service (they’ll be thinking they can work your 
job when it’s convenient because you won’t fire them), but the reality is you’ll 
(both) probably regret it if any problems arise or mishaps occur.
Getting and comparing bids
When hiring an HVAC contractor, always, always, always get multiple bids. 
There’s a possibility that you may only be able to find a single contractor 
who can do the job you have in mind. In this case, try to get some informa-
tion about how much the job costs in other areas so you’ll have something to 
compare your bids against.

139
 Chapter 3: Maximizing Your Heating and Air-Conditioning System
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
Always let contractors know you’re going out for competitive bids. Never 
make a commitment of any kind when they first visit.
After you get the bids, the problem becomes one of comparing apples to 
apples. Choosing the contractor comes down to three things:
 
 Cost: This factor may seem very important, but ultimately it may be the 
least significant. Why? Many things can go wrong, and problems gener-
ally add up to more cost. If you get a bid that’s much lower than the 
other ones, beware. Your contractor probably doesn’t understand what 
he’s doing, either technically or competitively. Or maybe you’re getting 
a contractor with a much lower overhead rate. Why? Does he not carry 
insurance? Is he working out of his truck, or off of his bicycle? Will he be 
around in three months to provide warranty coverage?
 
 Craftsmanship: Get referrals. While referrals may not seem important, it 
reveals experience and efficiency. How long has the contractor been in 
the business?
 
 Compatibility: Face it: Some contractors are just dubious characters, 
and some are living in a different universe. Having a good relationship 
matters — a lot. Not only does it foster cooperation and increase the 
likelihood that problems will be ironed out quickly and effectively, but 
a contractor who doesn’t like you is simply not going to go the extra 
mile for you. (That’s right — it can go both ways.) You may get the work 
done as per spec, but extra time won’t be spent to get the pipe joints 
just right. Or your phone calls won’t be returned until it can’t be put off 
any longer. You want a contractor who is happy to answer the phone 
when he sees your phone number on his Caller ID.
 
Make sure to ask about workmanship warranties. If the contractor offers only 
the warranty that comes from the manufacturer, beware. Ask about bonding, 
insurance, licenses, and so on, too. If your contractor doesn’t like these ques-
tions, beware. Good contractors are glad to hear these questions — it means 
their shady competitors are being weeded out.
Sealing the deal
A contract should include prices as well as a schedule of events that can be 
easily established and approved between the two of you. You also need to 
specify the cash flow: when payment is due and how much it will be.
 
Get everything in writing. Make it clear that throughout the entire project you 
expect everything to be in writing. Any decisions or changes made will be in 
writing only. E-mails are okay, but print them and keep them in a file folder. 
It’s not that people are to be distrusted; it’s that verbal communication is like 
that children’s game “Telephone,” where the message gets garbled each time 
it’s spoken. Writing forces clear articulation.

140
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Working with a contractor 
after the job begins
When you’re on the go, you need to work with your contractor as effectively 
as possible. Now is not the time to express doubt about your contractor’s 
abilities. Now is the time to follow the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you.
 
 Always be completely square and decisive. You may not want to 
express disappointment about how a job is turning out, but you should 
do so if that’s what you’re feeling.
 
 Be friendly no matter what. Don’t get emotional. Problems happen. Be 
cool when they do, and your contractor will be more honest with you 
about everything.
 
 Offer cold drinks. Make a cooler available. Go the extra mile.
 
 Don’t forget the need for a restroom. Make it nice and easy and keep it 
clean.

T
he typical North American home spends between 8 and 10 percent of its 
energy budget on lighting (excluding the bulbs and equipment). In any 
given night, the average home uses 32 light bulbs, including not only lighting for 
rooms, but lighting inside refrigerators, ovens, and microwaves. Most of these 
light bulbs are the standard, 50-cent, screw-base style using a technology that 
has been around for more than a hundred years. People have spent the vast 
majority of their lives with Thomas Edison’s original brainstorm. But things are 
changing. A number of choices are available now that, while more expensive, 
provide much better economics and performance over the lifetime of the prod-
uct. They also offer lower pollution, which is very important to many people.
In this chapter, you find out how to review your lighting arrangements and 
make sensible changes geared toward realizing payback. New lighting tech-
nologies can be very expensive, and you may be better off spending the 
money on other efficiency improvements.
Picking the Right Light: Your Options
When you think of lighting, you may automatically think of Thomas Edison 
and his incandescent bulb. In fact, you may be reading this very book by the 
light of a bulb not too different from the one Edison first invented. But light-
ing options have evolved over time, from natural light to firelight to candles 
to incandescent bulbs to the energy-efficient products of today. Each has its 
plusses and minuses when it comes to ambience and energy efficiency.

142
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
Visit a good-quality lighting store to see all kinds of lighting options. Stores 
dedicated to lighting have better displays and a broader range of products 
than big hardware stores. The sales staff is also able to explain energy-efficient 
products better.
Natural light
Natural light includes sunlight, firelight, and candlelight. Sunlight has been 
around a lot longer than humanity, and it provides the overwhelming bulk of 
our lighting needs. Sunlight has a very broad spectrum, or many wavelengths of 
light — what most people think of as “color.” (Think of the colors of the rain-
bow, and you get the idea.) Sunlight’s spectrum goes from ultra-violet, which 
we can’t see, through the visible range (the rainbow colors), and on into the 
infrared and far infrared, which are also invisible to the human eye. Sunlight 
gets filtered as it transmits through the atmosphere, and that’s why it can look 
very red in the morning and evenings. But mostly sunlight is white and bright, 
creating a jaunty mood that people associate with the best of Mother Nature.
Candlelight and firelight preceded all our fancy, electrical light-bulb schemes. 
Flames cast a rich tone of reddish hues and make people’s skin tone appear 
deep and attractive. Candles are popular because of the benign, tawny tint 
they cast on a room.
You can increase the lighting efficiency in your home by taking advantage of 
these natural light sources. Following are some ideas:
 
 Sunlight is the most efficient way to light your home because it’s free 
and creates zero pollution. Sunlight also creates a specific mood that 
can’t be beat by manmade options.
 
 Candles don’t require any utility power. If you want to use candlelight, 
use natural beeswax candles with minimal scent and lead-free wicks and 
try to find the long-burning style, which translates into less crud being 
released into the air in your home. (Regular candles contain volatile 
organic compounds and phthalates.) Candles of this type can light your 
house very nicely and save a lot of money.
 
 Don’t blow out your candles when you’re finished with them; use a 
snuffer (a long handle with a cone shape on one end). Blowing out can-
dles causes more pollution than a snuffer because you’re blasting the 
wick with oxygen. (The snuffer is much gentler.) Just notice how much 
less smoke a snuffer creates.

Old-fashioned incandescent bulbs
Standard-style (incandescent) light bulbs work by using electricity to heat 
up a narrow, high-resistance filament until it glows very bright. The filament 
is enclosed in a vacuum-drawn envelope (called the bulb) so that when 
the filament glows, it doesn’t burn up from being combined with oxygen. 
Incandescent bulbs cast a warm, reddish tint, especially when a dimmer is 
used. You can get them in a thousand different configurations, and they’re 
inexpensive and widely available but highly inefficient. In fact, the U.S. 
Congress has acted to phase out incandescent bulbs, removing them from 
the market starting in 2012.
An important specification for a light bulb is how much light it puts out divided 
by the amount of energy it consumes (an efficiency standard). Incandescent 
bulbs are the worst of all lighting options in this regard: Most of the energy an 
incandescent bulb gobbles up is converted into heat — nearly 90 percent.
 
When considering light bulb efficiency, pay attention to the bulb’s intensity 
and spatial focus. A round light bulb emits its spectrum pretty much in all 
directions at once, while a laser beam, for example, is extremely focused on 
a specific spot. A 10-watt gooseneck lamp with a highly focused reflector can 
cast enough light onto the page of a book to make reading easy and comfort-
able on the eyes. A 100-watt light bulb in a broadly emitting lamp, on the 
other hand, may be so diffuse that nothing shows up clearly. So when you 
choose incandescent bulbs, remember that higher wattage doesn’t neces-
sarily mean brighter light. Rather than buy the highest wattage you can find, 
buy the bulb that’s labeled a floodlight, which usually means that they’re 
conically shaped and have some reflective material on the inside of the glass 
envelope.
Halogen bulbs
Halogen light bulbs operate almost the same as incandescent bulbs, but with 
a few small differences. Inside a halogen bulb is a peanut-sized glass envelope 
that contains a tungsten filament and halogen gas. Essentially, it’s a light 
bulb inside of a light bulb. As the tungsten filament burns (the same way an 
incandescent does), the halogen gas catches the tungsten molecules and 
redeposits them back onto the filament, yielding a longer lifetime and better 
lighting uniformity. Halogen bulbs also emit a whiter, brighter, and more 
easily focused light, comparable to sunshine itself.

144
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Halogen bulbs are good for reading because they’re easier on your eyes. 
They’re also good for store displays or for artwork illumination where you 
want the light to have a color-neutral affect (and let the artwork do its own 
talking). They work well outdoors because the light is more noticeable. While 
they may yield the same lumen output (a measure of how much light a bulb 
emits) as an incandescent, the light works better with the human eye, so the 
spectrum is more efficient.
Halogen bulbs burn hotter than regular incandescent bulbs, so you need to 
be careful how you handle them, and keep them away from flammable materi-
als. If you use one for a reading light, you may not like having the intense heat 
source next to your head.
Halogen bulbs can be much more convenient than incandescent bulbs 
because they last twice as long. However, they aren’t nearly as efficient as 
compact fluorescent bulbs.
Flickering fluorescent bulbs
The best option on the market, compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) use 
a gas-filled tube and a ballast with electronics. A high-voltage signal excites 
phosphors on the inside surface of the bulb, which, in turn, emit light. The 
main difference between CFLs and incandescent or halogen bulbs is that 
CFLs are far more efficient because they don’t put out a lot of heat. A typi-
cal 15-watt CFL puts out as much light as a 60-watt incandescent light bulb, 
meaning CFLs are four times as efficient.
 
If you plan to replace an incandescent bulb with an equivalent fluorescent 
bulb, in general, you can divide the wattage of an incandescent by four to get 
the wattage needed for an equivalent CFL. But the best bet is to compare the 
lumens, an actual measure of the light output. (Wattage is simply the input 
power the bulb will take.) Almost all light-bulb packages now include lumens 
in addition to wattages.
CFLs are more expensive, although the gap is closing because so many more 
fluorescent bulbs are now being manufactured. The typical lifetime of a CFL 
is around four times that of an incandescent bulb, and herein lies their real 
benefit: They don’t need to be changed nearly as often, so the lifetime costs are 
actually less than incandescent bulbs, making them cheaper in the long term.
Here are some other things to note about CFLs:
 
 They’re available in the coil form that you probably are used to seeing 
and in versions that look like incandescents, as well as a host of specialty 
forms. If you can put a bulb in it, chances are there’s a CFL that fits the bill.
 
 You can use them anywhere you’d use an incandescent bulb. Dimmable 
and 3-way CFLs are available, and you can even buy CFL bug lights.

145
 Chapter 4: Lighting Your Home More Efficiently
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
 You can find CFL bulbs that give off warm, white light that’s very much 
like incandescent bulbs or cool, blue light. A bulb’s Kelvin temperature 
tells you which you’re getting: 2,700 K for white light and 5,000 K for 
bluer light.
 
 CFLs don’t like very hot environments, where their lifetimes are drasti-
cally reduced. If you use them in enclosed spaces without ventilation, 
they heat up and grow old quickly, reducing their longevity advantage.
 
 Turning off a lamp that uses a CFL bulb quickly can reduce the bulb’s 
life. Fifteen minutes of on time is enough to avoid cutting into the 
bulb’s life.
 
 CFLs often take a few moments to reach maximum brightness, but wait-
ing a moment is a small price to pay for the impressive energy savings 
CFLs provide.
 
Around 5 milligrams of mercury are contained in each CFL light bulb. 
(Big bulbs have more, of course.) Mercury is a very poisonous substance, 
although 5 milligrams isn’t much at all (about as much as the tip of a fine-
point pencil). The fact that CFLs contain mercury means you have to be par-
ticularly careful when disposing of and handling these bulbs:
 
 In most municipalities, you can’t simply throw a CFL into the trash. As 
with rechargeable batteries, paints, and so on, you take used CFL bulbs 
to your local hazardous materials drop site. Many stores that sell CFLs 
also take back your used ones. (IKEA stores accept CFLs, and so does 
Home Depot.) To find further options for dropping off your CFLs, call 
Earth 911’s recycling hotline, 800-CLEANUP, or visit www.earth911.
org, where a recycling center locator appears on the home page.
 
 Never send a CFL product to an incinerator, as the mercury becomes 
airborne when the bulb burns.
 
 Never use a vacuum to clean up a broken bulb; the mercury is aerated 
into your home environment through the vacuum filter, which is too 
porous to catch the molecules. Open windows and doors right away and 
stay clear of the area for about 15 minutes to give the vapors time to 
dissipate. Use a wet paper towel and stick both the bulb parts and the 
paper towel in a sealed, plastic bag.
Light-emitting diodes
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are extremely efficient — even more so than 
CFLS — and they have incredibly long lifetimes. However, they’re much more 
expensive than other lighting sources. At present, LEDs are used where ultra-
high efficiency or ultra-long lifetime are required — for example, in off-grid 
homes that run off of batteries or remote cabins that run off of generators. In 
these applications, LEDs are actually cheaper in the long run, despite their 
high cost, because they enable owners to use smaller batteries. (In off-grid 

146
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
homes, the battery banks are the fundamental power source. Batteries are very 
expensive, so smaller batteries are economically desirable.) LEDs are also used 
in stoplights (because of their ultra-high reliability) and in auto taillights.
Portable devices that use batteries also benefit from using LEDs. The avail-
ability of LED flashlights and camping lanterns, as well as boat and RV 
lighting systems, is increasing. You can buy LED-based light modules that 
interchangeably plug right into existing screw-type light fixtures, but they 
cost over $25. Furthermore, the light is thin and silvery, which isn’t the 
friendliest hue. Before you buy LEDs, check them out at a lighting store 
because light bulbs, like kids, aren’t returnable items if you’re not happy with 
their performance.
Going for efficiency without sacrificing aesthetics
Lighting does more than illuminate. It creates 
mood, or ambience. While one type of light 
produces a warm, cozy glow, another type pro-
duces a harsh glare. Either can be just the type 
of light you want, depending on your lighting 
needs, the area you want to illuminate, and the 
mood you want to create.
Most lighting is not for “seeing,” but for mood, 
and for making your home feel homier. By being 
imaginative — moving your lights around in dif-
ferent setups and trying different light bulbs — 
you can probably find an optimum configuration 
that takes less energy than you’re using right 
now without sacrificing a thing.
Here are some ideas for your consideration:
  Find a style of lamp that creates the mood 
you want. The lamp is usually more influ-
ential than the type of light bulb in creating 
a mood. Lamps with dimmers are always 
good, and a lamp that focuses light lets you 
use a smaller light bulb and attain the same 
effect.
 
 You can find a lot of interesting lamps at 
garage sales, often for less than a dollar 
apiece. Be on the lookout for such a find. 
It can save you money twice: on the pur-
chase price and on the energy costs. The 
best finds are gooseneck lamps with dim-
mers so that you can focus the light on your 
work and turn the intensity up and down as 
desired.
  Avoid metal or heavy paper lampshades. 
Lampshades are very important in terms of 
focusing and directing light. Many of them 
cut off most of the light from a bulb. Look 
for ones that have the effect you want, but 
allow most of the light through. Gauzy films 
are best.
  Vary the intensity of lighting as much as 
you can. Vary light bulb intensities to create 
texture and depth in a room. Disperse the 
lights around your house to highlight the 
good and ignore the not-so-good.
  Vary wattage where you can. The higher 
the wattage, the colder the light (bluish 
light “feels” colder than red; it’s a human 
perception thing); the lower the wattage, 
the redder the light, and the friendlier the 
tone. The wattage you choose depends on 
what you’re trying to achieve. A number 
of smaller light bulbs distributed around a 
room makes for a soft color and even light-
ing. Plus, lower-wattage bulbs have longer 
lifetimes simply because they’re not being 
so stressed by heat.

Calculating How Much You Can Save
To make a long story short, your potential cost savings (and the payback of 
installing a more expensive technology) are entirely dependent on how much 
you use a light (the average number of hours per day). Obviously, the easiest 
way to save money is to simply use less lighting.
In most homes, some light bulbs are on all the time, particularly outside 
lights or garage lights. And someone who likes a bright room may have every 
table lamp on as well as the book light he’s reading by. Start thinking greener 
by asking yourself whether you really need the lights you turn on and making 
sure that you flip the switch on lights you’re done using.
Consider the lights you use. Do you really need all of them? You’d probably 
answer no if you knew how much each one costs. Fortunately, lighting costs 
are easy to calculate. Here’s how to determine how much you’re spending on 
a particular light each month:
 
 Always use the smallest wattage pos-
sible. Experiment instead of just plugging 
in what you have on hand. You’ll probably 
find that you can use smaller bulbs in most 
instances. For example, a gooseneck lamp 
in the bathroom that focuses in on your face 
gives you the lighting you need and keeps 
wattage down.
  Use lights creatively. For example, vary 
the lights on tracks; they don’t all have to 
be the same type or wattage, nor do they 
all have to be focused on the fireplace. A 
small spotlight on your favorite picture will 
bring those colors into play in the room. A 
small, 10-watt picture light can completely 
change a room for the better.
  Try candles. Use them alone or in combina-
tion with electric lights. You’ll get hooked, 
and you’ll save money if you do it right. (See 
the earlier section “Natural light” for details 
on what makes candles energy efficient.)
  Lower the lights before bed. Too much light 
right before bed creates a bad sleeping 
mood. Start to dim the lights or turn them 
off well before you retire. You’ll find yourself 
gently relaxing into sleep mode.
  Use night lights. Having strategically 
placed night lights relieves you of the need 
to flip every light switch on when you get up 
in the middle of the night to go to the bath-
room or nursery. Besides, blasting yourself 
with light in the bathroom in the middle of 
the night wakes you up, and you then need 
more time to get back to sleep than if you 
had used a very dim night light.
 
 As your old incandescent lights burn out, 
replace them with CFLs, which currently 
are hands-down the most energy-efficient 
option for your home. And all those energy 
savings mean reductions in pollution and 
greenhouse gas production.

148
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
1. Figure out how many watt hours (Whs) the bulb is on per day by mul-
tiplying the wattage by the number of hours the light’s on daily.
 
 You can read the wattage from the light bulb. The value is expressed in 
watts; 60 watts is very common. Then ask yourself how many hours you 
typically use that light per day. Two hours? All day (24 hours)?
 
2. Multiply the total daily Whs by 30 to get the total Whs per month.
 
3. Divide the total Whs per month by 1,000 to get the total kWhs.
 
 Why are kWhs important? Because your utility bill is calculated based 
on kWhs.
 
4. To get your monthly cost, multiply your kWhs by the amount the 
electric company charges you per kWh.
 
 Look at your electric bill to find out how much you’re being charged for 
electricity. Fifteen cents per kWh is typical, but your rate may be a lot 
higher.
Here are some examples of calculations and the cost savings you may be able 
to achieve by changing your lighting schemes:
 
 A 60-watt bulb left on for an hour consumes 60 Whs, or .06 kWh per 
day. Ten 60-watt bulbs in recessed lighting in your ceiling turned on for 
four hours consume 2.4 kWh per day. At a rate of 15 cents per kWh, this 
amount of usage costs 36 cents a day. For a month, the total comes to 
$10.80, or $130 per year. Add to that the cost of new bulbs, and you 
may be spending over $150 a year to leave those overhead lights on 
every night.
 
 A 15-watt CFL costs around $4, while a comparable 60-watt incandescent 
bulb costs around 75 cents. For a light fixture that is turned on four 
hours per day, at a cost of 15 cents per kWh, the CFL costs $3.24 per 
year to operate. The incandescent costs $12.96 per year, for a difference 
of $9.72. Going with the initially more expensive CFL is actually more 
cost-efficient, easily paying you back the difference in original equip-
ment cost and saving around 130 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution.
 
 Do you have an outside light that burns all night? If it’s 600 watts, it’s 
costing you: 0.600 kW × 10 hours/day × 30 days/month × $.15/kWh = 
$9 per month, or $108 per year. You could add a motion detector, which 
turns the light on only when something moves through the viewing area, 
and save $100 per year while still having light whenever you really need 
it. (See the next section for more on motion detectors.) Crank up the 
savings further by putting an outdoor CFL in that motion detector.

149
 Chapter 4: Lighting Your Home More Efficiently
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
 A 15-watt CFL bulb costs $3, whereas a 60-watt incandescent bulb costs 
50 cents. If a light is on all the time (totally not green, by the way), a CFL 
costs around $20 per year to operate, whereas an incandescent bulb 
costs $80. However, if the CFL is put into a bathroom light socket that’s 
only used for an hour a day, the annual cost difference is only $2.50, 
which is the difference in the prices of the bulbs. But keep in mind that 
money savings are only part of the picture. CFLs cut down on pollution 
and greenhouse gas production, too.
Using Clever Switches 
to Reduce Your Bill
You can use different types of light bulbs to increase your energy efficiency, 
but a better option may be to use clever switching systems that simply and 
automatically turn off your lights when you don’t need them.
Motion detectors
Motion detectors are devices that switch light bulbs off and on when they 
detect something moving in their field-of-view, basically the area where the 
motion detector is set up to “look.” Motion detectors are the exact same 
technology used in burglar alarms, except that they don’t trigger an alarm; 
they simply turn on the light. Most motion detectors are integrated with a 
timing switch, so when motion is detected and a light is switched on, it goes 
off after a set amount of time. (A couple minutes is typical — most devices 
are adjustable for time delay.)
Motion detectors offer all sorts of benefits, some relating to efficiency and 
some relating to safety, but all relating to convenience. Burglars, for example, 
hate being suddenly illuminated while they’re sneaking around. When a light 
is simply left on, a burglar doesn’t mind so much; it’s when things suddenly 
change that they get nervous and decide to vamoose. Mount a motion detec-
tor light over a porch or on the side of your house where a burglar is most 
apt to approach (like a dark garage side door).
Motion detectors aren’t valuable just for their “gotcha!” effect, though. They 
turn on when anyone is there, which can be helpful when a neighbor comes up 
to your porch for a friendly visit, you pull into the driveway at night, and so on.

150
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
You get the best return on investment when you combine motion detectors 
with high-wattage lights, which are usually the kind employed outdoors. Here 
are some options to consider:
 
 Solar-powered outdoor floodlights with motion detectors: You can 
mount them anywhere so that you get light exactly where you want it. 
Better yet, you don’t need an electrical outlet so you avoid the cost of 
outlet installation. The unit includes a battery that is charged during 
high intensity solar hours, and so the amount of available energy is 
limited. At around $65, the solar-powered motion detector can provide 
huge cost savings if you need light in a remote location. Plus, you can 
move the lights around at will, which you can’t do with a standard hard-
wired light fixture.
 
 One-piece outdoor systems: These systems include one or more motion 
detectors along with light fixtures in one complete package. These come 
in flood, decorative, and remote arrangements.
 
 Motion detector switches: These switches fit right into the standard 
switch socket you already have in your home. Whenever somebody 
walks into the field of view, the light goes on for about 30 seconds. 
Motion detector switches are great for utility rooms where your hands 
may be full of clothes or groceries, and flipping a switch is inconvenient. 
They’re also good for basements and attics.
 
 Screw-base-style motion detectors. You install these detectors between 
a light bulb and the socket that the bulb would normally be screwed 
into. At around $40, they’re not cheap and the payback isn’t very good, 
but they may be just the ticket for a utility room or laundry room or any-
where you often find yourself with your hands full and unable to grapple 
around for the switch.
 
Before you buy a motion detector, pay attention to the field of view. With 
some units, you can adjust the field of view; with others, it’s fixed. Getting 
one with an adjustable sensitivity is best; you don’t necessarily want your 
lights to go on when a cat crosses your yard. (Then again, maybe you do.) 
When in doubt, save the packing materials and receipt and be prepared to 
buy something else. And put those marvelous, energy-efficient CFL bulbs in 
all your shiny, new motion-detecting lights.
Dimmer switches
Light dimmers are used for decreasing and increasing a light’s intensity. 
Although they aren’t particularly efficient, the net effect of using them is that 
you do use less energy (and if you’re using dimmable CFLs, you’re saving a 
whole lot of energy and money). There’s another benefit as well: The bulbs 
on dimmer switches last longer because they’re operating at lower tempera-
tures. In general, you get a friendlier, richer color, and you can vary the mood 
in a room like nothing else.

151
 Chapter 4: Lighting Your Home More Efficiently

You can change almost any light switch in your house to a dimmer switch, 
but beware: You need to know a few basic rudiments about electricity before 
you start poking around inside your electrical junction boxes. You need to 
understand the difference between the white wire, the black wire, and the 
green (or bare) wire. The task isn’t difficult, but explaining everything you 
need to know about electrical wiring is beyond the scope of this book. If 
you’re motivated and want to give it a go yourself, keep the following advice 
in mind:
 
 Before you do anything, the safest bet is to simply turn the main 
breaker switch off in your house. You’ll have to do your work during 
daylight hours or with a flashlight, but you won’t be able to shock your-
self. After you do the work, make sure that you cover the dimmer switch 
with the faceplate. If you turn the main breaker back on and a circuit 
breaker trips, you’ve messed up somewhere, at which point you may 
want to call in an electrician to do the job right.
 
 Ask for instructions and guidelines at your hardware store. Someone 
there can probably tell you how to install a switch and show you the 
actual hardware to use. When you’re getting instructions, make sure 
that you understand how to maintain the proper grounding scheme, 
which is very important. You may need to be aware of local electrical 
codes, so ask your hardware store clerk about those as well.
 
Another option is to refer to How To Fix Everything For Dummies (Wiley) by 
Gary Hedstrom, Peg Hedstrom, and Judy Ondria Tremore for general informa-
tion and instructions on common electrical wiring jobs.
 
If you have aluminum wiring in your house (it’s shiny or dull gray, instead of 
the usual coppery or orange color), don’t wire a dimmer yourself because 
there are technical problems you don’t want to deal with. (Specifically, when 
two dissimilar metals come into contact, the potential for corrosion exists. So 
when working with aluminum wires, you need to understand what works and 
what doesn’t.)
Whole-house lighting controllers
Whole-house lighting control systems basically switch all your home lights 
off and on from a central console. For example, you can turn off all your lights 
from one location when you go to bed. Or when you enter your house, you 
can turn on a certain preset number of lights so that you don’t have to go 
around and individually activate each light. Some can be turned off and on by 
a timer. You can even get a system that you can call from a remote location.
If you program one of these contraptions for efficiency, you can achieve some 
significant cost savings. For example, you could turn off all of your lights at 
a certain time of night. You could also turn lights on and off according to a 
clock so that you capture exactly the right mood at different times.

Increasing Your Water Efficiency
In This Chapter
 Figuring out what type of water to drink
 Getting a fix on faucets
 Using less water in the bathroom
 Landscaping your way to savings
T
he minimal human requirement for water is only around four gallons per 
day, and that’s for both consumption and cleaning. So how much does a 
typical family (2 adults, 2 kids) use? Between 200 and 350 gallons of water a 
day. That’s 73,000 to 128,000 gallons per year. Landscaping, swimming pools, 
and spas take even more water. A small, working ranch may use over 270,000 
gallons per year. That’s a lot of water.
In most homes, water has five main destinations: faucets, toilets, showers 
(baths), dishwashers, and washing machines. In each case, water heating 
may be required, which consumes around 20 percent of a typical home’s 
energy costs. Other uses of water include outdoor irrigation, pools, spas, 
fountains, and so on. This chapter tells you how to save in these areas.
 
The vast majority of homes get their water from the local utility, some with 
metered rate structures, some not. If you’re not operating off of a water 
meter, your water utility may give you a better monthly rate if you voluntarily 
go to a metered rate structure. The utility will come out and install a meter, 
usually free of charge. If you’re frugal, you can save money, and by having a 
meter, you’ll be more conscious of how much water you’re using.
Drinking to Your Health
Most of the water used in a home isn’t consumed. Instead, it’s used for tasks 
like cleaning, watering, and so on. Yet many people today spend much more 
money for water they drink than on water they use for these other purposes. 

154
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Why? Because our society is fixated on bottled and/or purified drinking 
water, which is almost always a waste of money and resources and generates 
far more pollution than is necessary. In fact, evidence increasingly indicates 
that drinking purified water may lead to health problems. So what’s the deal?
The following sections help you sort out what you need to know about your 
water supply and to give you ideas for reducing the amount of money you 
spend on drinking water.
Wading through a flood of choices: 
Tap, well, bottled, and purified
Most homes have a number of choices for their water sources. In this section 
you find out more about the most common choices. Your best bet is to use 
the cheapest source for each of your various applications. Most of the time, 
this choice is very easy; simply use tap water.
Tap water
Most homes get their water from local utilities, which have stringent quality 
requirements. In fact, federal standards for tap water are actually higher than 
those for bottled water. In addition, most tap water already contains minerals 
important to your health — minerals that some purveyors of purifier systems 
and bottled water deliberately add to their products and charge you more 
for. Bottom line: The government provides you with safe, healthy water with-
out the hassle and expense of bottled water.
 
Local utilities are required to make public their testing process and results. 
If you want to know exactly what’s in your water, call the customer-service 
number on your utility bill and ask to be sent the data. You shouldn’t be 
charged for this information.
Well water
Some homes get their water from wells. Although these sources are generally 
very good, they may not be the best source for drinking water because con-
taminants do make their way into wells, and you may have to pay for testing. 
Well water is especially prone to change over time. If you have a well, you’re 
very likely getting the requisite minerals and other natural components. But 
you may also be getting pollution and other contaminants like dumped pesti-
cides or other chemicals.
 
If you have a well, test it at least once a year; if your well fails a test, test 
more often. Look in the yellow pages under Water Well Drilling.

Bottled water
Bottled water costs 240 to 10,000 times more than tap water — moneywise, 
that is; the environmental costs are even more enormous. The costs show up 
in bottling, packaging, shipping, retail, sales, advertising, and so on. If you’re 
paying this price for bottled water simply because you think it’s cleaner, you 
may want to consider these facts:
 
 Quality isn’t guaranteed. Unlike the water provided by utilities, the 
quality of bottled water isn’t regulated by the federal government. When 
you buy bottled water, you have no guarantee that you’re even getting 
water that’s as good as your home supply.
 
 “Enriched” may not provide enrichment. Some bottled water is adver-
tised as “oxygen enriched.” Absolutely no evidence exists to support the 
notion that it does anything whatsoever to help you.
 
 Transporting water is costly. Bottled water takes a great deal of energy 
to transport to your store shelf. Think how far that water from the Italian 
mountain lake has come and then think of the pollution generated in the 
process. It doesn’t matter that the water is cheap; the cost of pollution 
isn’t reflected in the cost of a product.
 
 America’s appetite for bottled water gobbles up more than 47 million 
gallons of oil and produces one billion pounds of carbon dioxide per 
year (that’s right — billion!).
 
 Plastic bottles stick around for a very long time. It takes 1,000 years for 
a plastic bottle to degrade in a landfill. You can recycle the bottles, but 
if you don’t need them in the first place, recycling isn’t the best answer. 
Not using them is.
 
 If you want to use bottles of water because they’re convenient, use reus-
able bottles. You can fill them up with tap water. Alternatively, buy puri-
fied water at a grocery store that lets you bring in and fill up your own 
bottles and charges you by the gallon.
Purified water
Many people use water purifiers, systems that in most cases remove impuri-
ties but in some instances add minerals and other positive substances.
 
Humans don’t necessarily need perfect water. In fact, evidence suggests that 
a pristine lifestyle leads to increased immune deficiency. Certain types of 
minerals and bacteria are required by the human body to enable digestion. 
And recent studies indicate that children raised on purified water are statisti-
cally more likely to suffer from childhood diseases than those brought up on 
tap water. The reason? The immune system needs to be constantly exercised 
in order to achieve optimum conditioning (just like muscles). Humans that 
live in sanitized, pristine environments don’t get the necessary exposure.

156
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Having said that, sometimes having a water purifying system is a good idea. 
The next section explains how to tell when your water supply is problematic 
and what you can do about it.
Getting the goods on suspicious water
In rare cases, you may actually have good reason to be suspicious of your 
water source. Potential contaminants include pernicious bacteria, cysts 
(parasites with protective coverings that make them very tenacious), heavy 
metals, chlorine, sediment, poisons, and many more.
Signs that your water supply may be contaminated include
 
 Age of your pipes: In old plumbing systems, some contaminants reside 
right in the pipes and are very difficult to get out. If your city water 
supply is pristine but you have an old home, you may still have a prob-
lem because you’re running clear water through contaminated pipes.
 
 Clarity: While unclear water isn’t a sure indicator of contamination, you 
should find out what the cause is. Most of the time, it’s only minerals, 
which isn’t a problem.
 
 Poor taste: Bad-tasting water may be a sign of a contaminant. But deter-
mining whether the bad taste indicates a real problem or just tastes dif-
ferent than you’re used to is difficult. (It’s very common to go into other 
cities and find that the water tastes poor, even though it’s just fine.) If in 
doubt, get your water tested.
 
 Smell: The human nose is very sensitive. If your water smells bad, get 
it tested (although a bad smell isn’t necessarily an indicator that it’s 
unhealthy).
If you’re suspicious about the quality of your water, the best bet is to get 
your water tested. Here are your options:
 
 Have your water tested by an independent company. Check the 
Internet or your phone book for “Water Testing.” For around $100, you 
can get a detailed analysis. (They send you a sterilized container; you fill 
it and send it back.) You need to do every testing sequence twice, at dif-
ferent times of the year, to get reliable results.
 
 Have your water tested by a not-so-objective company. You can get 
tests done by water purification companies (probably for free). But 
beware: Their goal is to sell you water purification equipment or ser-
vices. They probably won’t tell you that humans do better with impuri-
ties in their water supply.

157

Book II

 Test your water yourself. Although you can buy your own equipment and 
test your water yourself, doing so isn’t your best bet. First, it’s expensive. 
Second, and more importantly, you probably don’t have the expertise to 
interpret the results sufficiently. It’s best to trust the experts.
Purifying your drinking water
So you’ve decided to improve your drinking water. Two types of home-based 
equipment are widely available:
 
 Distilleries: Distilled water is boiled, and, in the process, the water 
separates from the impurities. This type of purification is expensive and 
energy-intensive, but it’s very thorough.
 
 Filtration systems: Filtering involves forcing the water through some 
kind of porous device that removes the impurities. Aerator filters that 
attach to faucets are the simplest type of filter.
As you consider your water purifying options, look for a system that treats 
only the water you plan to consume. After all, it makes no sense to filter 
water for your shower or your dishwasher. In addition, make sure that the 
system targets the impurities you want to eliminate. Some systems improve 
only the water’s taste and color. Others get rid of contaminants. Make sure 
that you know what your system does.
 
Simply buying a filter because it sounds good is a waste of money, although 
most filters are purchased for this very reason. Purification equipment tar-
gets very specific types of contamination. Before you make an investment, 
make sure that the equipment you’re getting is designed to remove the con-
taminant you’re interested in removing. The only way to know is to first have 
your water tested.
 
All systems take effort and maintenance. If you don’t want to hassle with 
water purification, consider one of these alternatives:
 
 Contract with a bottled water company. They will rent you a dispenser 
and come out twice a month to refill it with a big jug of distilled or 
filtered water and do the regular maintenance. The cost is around $8 
per month. You can get dispensers that heat the water, which is more 
efficient than using your water heater but less efficient than using your 
microwave.
 
 Get a bottle with a built-in filter. This method is the cheapest way to 
go, and you use this system only when you need it. Fill the bottle with 
water from your tap, screw the filter/lid on, and, when you drink, the 
water is filtered.

158
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Mechanical filtration occurs when water is forced through a porous medium, 
like a screen or a chunk of carbon. These strainers use mesh with particular 
hole sizes. The size of the holes determines the strainer’s porosity, which is 
usually specified in terms of microns. (A micron is one millionth of a liter.) 
As you’d expect, strainers with finer porosity remove smaller-sized contami-
nants than strainers with higher porosity.
To get an idea about what type of porosity you need, you have to determine 
what type of contaminant you’re trying to remove. Sediment filters, for 
example, remove smaller particles like suspended dirt, sand, rust, and scale 
(known as turbidity). Once again, filters are always very specific to the type 
of material you’re attempting to filter. Look on the filter label (or get on the 
Internet and research a particular filter’s specifications) to see which types 
of contaminants it’s good at filtering.
 
If you need a filter with a very fine porosity, you’re better off removing the 
biggest impurities by using a higher porosity filter first. Larger porosity fil-
ters are generally much cheaper than smaller porosity filters (and easier to 
clean). Catch the big stuff first, and your overall filter expenses will be less.
Here’s a look at how common filter types do their thing:
 
 Activated carbon filtration: Carbon absorption filters are the most 
widely used because they offer high performance at a low price. They 
remove many types of contaminants as well as chlorine, but they don’t 
affect water hardness. Few carbon systems work with lead, asbestos, 
VOCs (dissolved organics), cysts, and coliform, so if these contaminants 
are your issues, carbon filters aren’t recommended.
 
 In fact, most of the impurities that carbon filters remove aren’t the 
impurities that you’re targeting. In addition, carbon filters need to be 
changed frequently, and this can be very costly.
 
 Reverse osmosis (ultrafiltration): This method uses pressure to force 
water through a selective, semi-permeable membrane that separates 
contaminants from the water. Reverse osmosis systems are very good at 
removing turbidity, asbestos, lead and other heavy metals, radium, and 
VOCs. But keep these things in mind:
 
• Membranes are costly to replace. Most are capable of having the 
membrane washed out (backwashing), but the membranes do 
eventually need to be replaced, which isn’t cheap.
 
• They waste a lot of water. They use 3 to 9 gallons of water to get 
one pure gallon. This method is a dubious way to achieve efficiency.
 
 Virustat filters: Virustat filters eliminate viruses from water sources in 
foreign cities or wild streams. For the most part, these viruses don’t affect 
local folks because they’re used to them and have built up a tolerance.

Directing the Flow of 
Traffic with Faucets
The typical home has six indoor faucets, and another four or five outdoors. 
That gives you a lot of opportunities for improved efficiency. Just by making 
a few changes in your faucets, you can use water more efficiently.
Some relatively easy changes you can make include
 
 Using a two-valve faucet: A two-valve faucet is more efficient than a sin-
gle-valve type (where you move the lever around until you get the right 
temperature). The latter inevitably wastes hot water.
 
 Using aerator filters in the faucets: These filters add air and keep up the 
pressure while reducing flow volume. Most of the time, people are look-
ing for greater pressure, not flow volume, from a faucet. In fact, many 
building codes now require low-flow faucets because they make so much 
sense. (They save water without being inconvenient.)
Of course, dealing with leaks is a great way to not only increase how effi-
ciently you use water but also to offset some other problems as well.
Leaks: Money and energy down the drain
Leaky faucets waste water. A faucet dripping once per second can waste 
2,000 gallons per year. Beyond just the waste factor, leaking faucets can 
also cause increased health issues because mold and mildew just love damp 
environments.
In addition, a dripping faucet can humidify your entire house. In the summer, 
higher humidity means less comfort. Do not underestimate this effect — it’s 
much more pronounced than you may think. So not only are you wasting 
Caring for your filters
As the filter cruds up, its effectiveness dimin-
ishes, so when reading specs, always remem-
ber that you need to change filters as often as 
the manufacturer recommends, or you may not 
achieve the required performance.
Also, as the filter gets older it traps impurities 
of all kinds, so it may actually become a breed-
ing ground for nasty little critters invisible to 
the naked eye, making the problem worse, not 
better.

160
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
water, but also your house is uncomfortable and your air conditioner is 
running more (which means wasted utility costs). Chapter 3 tells you more 
about the effects of humidity.
The largest cost is the heat being wasted when hot water is drawn from your 
water heater. If a faucet is dripping, it may be drawing hot water. If it’s drip-
ping very slowly, you may not even know it’s dripping hot water because by 
the time that water has come all the way from your water heater through the 
pipes to your faucet, it has cooled down. But heat is still being wasted.
If your water pressure is high, you probably experience dripping faucets, 
especially outdoors where leaks are more likely to go unnoticed. High pres-
sure basically means higher force, which can push through questionable 
seals. You can have a pressure regulator installed on your water system, but 
it’s probably not worth the hassle. If you have high water pressure, you need 
to be sure to provide adequate maintenance for your seals and gaskets.
 
Outdoor faucets are more prone to leakage than indoor ones because they’re 
generally cheaper, plus they get beat up by the weather. (Constantly chang-
ing temperature is hard on metals.) Replacing outdoor faucets that leak is 
much easier than replacing indoor faucets; anybody can do it with the right 
wrench and patience level.
Obviously, the only way to deal with a leaking faucet is to fix it. Before you 
tackle the job, though, keep these suggestions in mind:
 
 Shut off all the water. Shut-off valves are generally found below sinks 
and the like, but shutting off the water in your entire home when doing 
plumbing jobs is a good idea. You can find a whole house shutoff valve 
in the utility box either in front of your home or in your basement. (Most 
of the time it’ll be right next to your water meter, if you have one.) Many 
homes also have an underground container near the roadway (watch 
out for spiders when you stick your hand in).
 
 Be careful to get it right. Make sure you understand what you’re doing 
before you start and that you have the right tools (and good ones). To 
find out how to fix leaky faucets, ask at your local hardware store. They 
have tons of experience with dripping faucets and usually know the 
types used in your community. You can also find instructions for fixing 
dripping faucets in How to Fix Everything For Dummies (Wiley) by Gary 
and Peg Hedstrom and Judy Ondrla Tremore.
 
 Almost anybody can do plumbing, but if you don’t do it exactly right, 
you have to do it over until you do get it exactly right.
 
 Take a picture before you start. Whenever you take a plumbing system 
apart for repairs or maintenance, use a digital camera to snap shots 
once in awhile so that if you forget where things go, you can look back at 
the pictures.

161

Don’t feel up to the job? Then hire a plumber and watch him fix the leak. 
Then next time you encounter a leaky tap, you can do the job yourself. Of 
course, while watching a plumber work, you may decide you never, ever 
want to do plumbing. Either lesson is worth the money.
A few more tips for using water wisely
 
Beyond fiddling with the faucets and fixing leaks, you can do a few other 
things to use water more efficiently:
 
 Avoid using your garbage disposal. It requires a lot of water to run and 
ends up filling the septic or sewer system far more than is needed. Get a 
composter and start a little garden — check out Chapter 2 of Book VI to 
find out more about composting — or toss the waste into your garbage.
 
 Don’t waste cold water waiting for the hot. When you need hot water, 
you generally run water down the drain until it shows up. Instead, put a 
pot, bowl, or other container under the faucet while you’re waiting for 
the water to get hot and then use the cold water you collect for cooking, 
ice cubes, or whatever. Just don’t waste it.
 
 Don’t leave the tap running while you’re doing something else. 
Whether you’re brushing your teeth or cleaning off the countertop, turn 
the water off. Leaving the water running is an easy habit to break, and 
you’d be surprised how much difference it can make.
Savings in Showers and Baths
When you’re thinking about water consumption, you need to factor in two 
things: heat and water. Heating water accounts for around 20 percent of the 
power bill in a home, and showers and baths use 37 percent of that. That 
means that around 6 percent of your power bill is dedicated to heating water 
for your shower and baths. You can save in both areas:
 
 Forget baths. They’ll become a thing of the past when energy rates get 
high enough. You simply can’t take an economical bath.
 
 Double up. Put the kids (appropriately aged, of course) into the shower 
together. Or take a shower with your partner.
 
 Use handheld showerheads. These showerheads focus better, allowing 
much less water to do the job. (If you think about it, most of the water 
flowing from a showerhead is wasted.) The downside is you have to 
hold them.

162
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
 Avoid showerheads that “mist” the water. They humidify your home 
more than anything, and the mist does no good at all. They’re especially 
inefficient in the summer.
 
 Take shorter showers. Lingering in the heat is nice, but it wastes energy 
because all you get out of it is, well, lingering in the heat. Find something 
else to linger in. A 5-minute shower is the green ideal.
 
 Avoid things that make your shower a pleasant living quarters, like 
radios, TVs, nice views, and so on. In order to be truly efficient, a shower 
should be strictly functional.
 
 Install a graywater recycle system on your shower and bath drain. 
These systems basically recycle your home’s water. A tank is connected 
to certain drains (usually everything but the toilet) and then a chemical-
sanitizing process is performed that brings the water up to cleanliness 
standards suitable for landscaping and even washing. The best systems 
can clean water well enough to be consumed. Not only does graywater 
offset the demand for treating water to the highest potable standard, but 
it also may actually be beneficial to plants as it’s likely to contain nitro-
gen and phosphorous. Installing one of these systems when building a 
new house is a lot more economical than retrofitting an existing house.
 
Water-wise, baths take 20 gallons or more of water, but a five-minute shower 
takes around 10 gallons, making baths about twice as expensive as showers. 
On the other hand, a shower can consume more water if you have an old-
style showerhead, which typically delivers 4 to 5 gallons per minute — quite 
a rich and wasteful flow of water. To address this issue, the Energy Policy 
Act of 1992 set maximum water flow rates at 2.5 gallons per minute, so new 
houses and new showerheads are almost always at or below this number. 
New showerheads are designed to use less water and create more water 
pressure, so you aren’t aware that you’re getting less.
 
You can easily measure the flow of your showerhead. Simply get a pitcher 
with gallons marked on the side. While you count one-Mississippi, two-
Mississippi, and so on, run your showerhead into the pitcher until you’ve got 
one gallon. Divide 60 by your Mississippi count, and you have your flow rate 
in gallons per minute. The current standard is 2.5 gallons per minute, but you 
can do better than this number without sacrificing much quality.
Wasting Water in the Toilet
Toilets account for 45 percent of indoor water use, or around 32,000 gallons 
per year for a family of four. A running toilet (one that makes a constant hiss-
ing noise) can waste up to 4,000 gallons of water per year. Fortunately, you 
can solve these problems, if you’re willing to do a little dirty work.

163
 Chapter 5: Increasing Your Water Efficiency
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
If you put a couple of quart bottles filled with water in the tank, each flush 
will use that much less water. Bricks or rocks also work.
What to do when your toilet runs
If your toilet is running, finding the problem is almost always simple. The 
most common problem in a running toilet is the flapper, which is a rubber 
disk that covers the hole where the water enters the toilet bowl. Flappers are 
so ridiculously easy to change that anybody can do it. Go to your hardware 
store and ask the clerk how to get the job done.
 
You can completely rebuild the workings of most toilets with new parts (that 
will probably work better than the old) for less than $60. A plumber will 
charge a lot more than that, maybe on the order of hundreds of dollars.
 
If you have to work on the mechanisms in the toilet tank, first drain the tank 
by turning off the shut-off valve (all toilets have a shut-off valve where the 
water source comes out of the wall) and flushing. The tank will empty down 
to an inch or two. Now you can work on the working parts.
Updated toilet designs
Nothing is worse than flushing a toilet and looking back down to find that 
it wasn’t 100 percent effective. (Okay, one thing is worse — when the toilet 
clogs up and overflows all over the bathroom floor, especially when you’re in 
somebody else’s house.)
The old standard technology in toilets simply uses gravity to “rush” the 
water down into the bowl and carry away the waste. Gravity works well 
enough most of the time, but it uses a lot of water, so less wasteful designs 
that accomplished the same thing came into being:
Taking energy efficiency to the limit
One toilet style that’s finding widespread use 
in countries where water is scarce features 
a little sink on top of the toilet tank. You wash 
your hands and other sundry items in the sink, 
and that water then drains down into the toilet 
tank. When you flush the toilet, it’s not clean, 
pristine water, but it hardly matters. This design 
makes a lot of sense because it’s so simple and 
effective. Look to see more of these toilets in 
the future.

164
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
 Pressure-assist toilets: Pressure-assist toilets use much less water per 
flush and actually work better. The water is held in the tank under pres-
sure, and when you trigger the flush lever, it “explodes” down into the 
toilet bowl. These toilets are costly ($250 apiece) and hard to fix, plus 
they’re very loud, so everybody in the house is going to know what you 
just did.
 
 Most public facilities use pressure-assist toilets. If you’re considering a 
pressure-assist toilet, you can decide firsthand whether you want this 
loud noise in your own home by going into almost any public facility and 
sampling the wares.
 
 Vacuum-assist toilets: Vacuum-assist toilets suck waste right out of the 
bowl (which is sort of the opposite of the pressure-assist method of 
blasting it out). They’re cheaper than their pressure-assist counterparts 
and easier to fix.
 
 Compost toilets: Compost toilets don’t flush at all. You need to be a 
hearty soul to consider these devices, but they’re very earth-friendly. 
They basically allow the waste products to decompose in a specially 
designed chamber. At some point, you take the “materials” out of the 
“finishing drawer” and to your landscaping.
Watering Your Landscaping
Ah, the great outdoors. Most people have some form of landscaping, and 
many people have extensive landscaping, including a lawn, which is the most 
water- and energy-intense form of landscaping you can imagine. In a yard, 
you can conserve water through your landscaping choices and through your 
choice of sprinkler. The following sections tell you how to use less water and 
energy in your yard.
Considering lawn alternatives
The one thing you can do to conserve the most water and energy is to get rid 
of your lawn. Replace it with drought-resistant plants and don’t water them 
much. (Create a drought of your own!) You can also go au naturel by replac-
ing your lawn with native plants that grow and thrive in your climate without 
need for watering above and beyond what Mother Nature provides. Barring 
that, you can
 
 Set the height levers on your lawn mower an inch higher. Less heat will 
hit the dirt beneath the grass, thereby allowing you to water less. And 
longer grass chokes out the weeds much better than short grass, so you 
won’t have to use herbicides.

165
 Chapter 5: Increasing Your Water Efficiency
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
 Fertilize your lawn less often. When you lighten up on the fertilization, 
you aren’t asking the grass to grow quite so vigorously.
 
 Use a mulching mower, which helps fertilize the grass.
Picking the right sprinkler and 
watering at the right time
If you need to water your lawn, know that all sprinklers aren’t created equal. 
Some waste more water than they apply to the plants. And you can also con-
trol the time of day or night you do your watering to gain better efficiency. 
Follow these guidelines to water with the least waste:
 
 If you need to water a large area, use rotary sprinklers. Avoid misting 
sprinklers because all they do is mist water into the air where it blows 
away into the neighbor’s yard.
 
 Use drippers instead of broadcast sprinklers for isolated plants, par-
ticularly when they’re surrounded by bark or other ground cover that 
doesn’t need any watering at all. You may have to spend more money 
up front on hardware, but you’ll save a lot of water, and your plants will 
be much healthier because they’re getting water right where they want 
it — in their root systems.
 
 A drip system needs to be maintained. Check it once in a while by turn-
ing it on manually and making sure that all the drippers are working.
 
 Water at night or early in the morning. The sunshine will be less likely 
to evaporate most of the water before it gets to where it’s used.
 
 Use battery-operated valves. They save water by regulating the amount 
that’s delivered. If you turn your system off and on manually, you’ll 
forget about it. Battery valves can be set to open for a predetermined 
period of time. These valves generally fit right onto the faucet for a good 
mechanically rigid mount.
 
 You can get small, cheap valves that you set for a number of gallons 
instead of time. These work very well for gardens and when your water 
pressure varies. The Weather TRAK sprinkler controller works accord-
ing to weather conditions, ensuring that you’re not watering unless your 
lawn really needs it. Check it out at www.weathertrak.com.
 
 Use barrels under downspouts to catch rainwater. You can then use 
the rainwater for other purposes. If you can, position the barrel in an 
elevated position (for example, set it up on some concrete blocks); then 
simply use gravity feed when you need water.

ncluding your domestic water heater, around 40 percent of your power 
bill is consumed by your appliances, big and small. And just because an 
appliance is small in stature doesn’t mean it’s small in energy consumption.
Understanding how much power your appliances consume is the first step 
toward recovering from the rampant disease of appliancism. (Okay, we made 
up that term.) You can lower your power bills by using your appliances more 
sensibly — or even better, by not using your appliances at all. For instance, a 
great way to lower your power bill is to set up a clothesline.
Looking at Typical Appliance 
Consumption Numbers
Aside from your HVAC system, appliances consume the lion’s share of power 
in your home. The biggest culprits are your washer and dryer, but because 
your refrigerator is on all the time, it comes in a close second. There are 
exceptions, of course. Some homes have aquariums that collectively steal 
the spotlight. Other homes have an old freezer in the garage that cranks kilo-
watts 24/7. Increasingly common are homes with large entertainment centers, 
which can gobble kilowatts with the biggest and baddest of energy pigs.

168
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Table 6-1 shows you how many kilowatts per hour (kWh) the average home 
uses in a year and the annual cost (based on an electric rate of 15 cents per 
kWh, which is pretty typical). You can determine your own annual usage and 
cost by gathering your electric bills, which show kWhs used and your rate. 
(See the next section for details.) If your rate is higher or lower than 15 cents, 
adjust it accordingly.

Analyzing Appliance Consumption 
in Your Home
To find out how much an appliance costs per month to run, first estimate 
how much time it’s on per day. Then determine how much power it con-
sumes. You can usually find this information on the label, but you may have 
to consult the instruction manual or go to the manufacturer’s Web site.
Use this formula to estimate your monthly cost to run an appliance:
Wattage ÷ 1,000 × hours on per day × cost per kWh × 30days = total cost 
per month
Say you want to know how much it costs you to run your washer, dryer, and 
iron (assume that your rate is 15 cents per kWh):
Washer: You run your 900-watt washing machine for six hours a week. 
(Figure your daily usage by dividing the number of hours the washer is on by 
the number of days in a week: 6 ÷ 7 = .86.) Here’s what you spend:
900 ÷ 1,000 × .86 × .15 × 30 = $3.48 per month
Dryer: Your clothes dryer uses 5,570 watts (that’s a whole lot). If you dry 
clothes for six hours a week, you spend this much to dry your clothes:
5,570 ÷ 1,000 × .86 × .15 × 30 = $21.56 per month
Iron: If you iron clothes with a 1,200-watt iron each morning for 15 minutes, 
it’s costing you:
1,200 ÷ 1,000 × .25 × .15 × 30 = $1.35 per month
Add up these numbers and you can see that for the appliances you use to 
keep your clothing clean and pressed, you spend a total of $26.40 per month.
If you put up a clothesline, you would save $21.56 per month (and around 
1,748 pounds per year of carbon dioxide emissions). Plus, your clothes would 
smell better and you could pat yourself on the back for doing your part to 
save the planet Earth.

You can work this number stuff to death, but what you really want to do is 
simply make sensible improvements in your efficiency. Start with your big-
gest appliances and work your way down. Some appliances are easy to use 
less often; others are harder to do without. It also makes sense to start with 
the appliances you use the most. Just do your part where you can, and you’ll 
be surprised at the difference it makes.
 
You can find out how much your old appliances are costing by visiting www.
energystar.gov. Click on Home Appliances and enter the year, size, and 
other data for your old appliance. A calculator tells you how much your cur-
rent unit is costing, as well as how much you could save if you switched to a 
new, energy-efficient model.
Making time stand still
Here’s an educational project. Try to get your 
power meter to stand still. Find your meter 
and note the spinning wheel and the numbers. 
(These are kWh. When the utility people come 
to read your meter, they read this number and 
then subtract the number they read last month 
to get your monthly consumption.)
First, turn off the main breaker on your circuit 
panel. If your meter is still spinning, you have 
a ground fault, and you’re paying for electricity 
that’s basically going through the earth beneath 
your feet. This should not to be misconstrued as 
generosity; have your utility company come out 
and fix this right away.
If that checks out, turn the main breaker back 
on and check to see how fast it’s spinning. Now 
switch off every one of the individual breakers 
in your box; the spinning should stop, once 
again.
Now start switching the individual breakers 
back on, one at a time, and see what hap-
pens. The panel should have a well-articulated 
legend that tells you what each breaker is for: 
HVAC, laundry room, upstairs lights, and so on. 
The biggest switches (those with the biggest 
numbers, such as 30 or 50) are for your HVAC 
system and your clothes dryer. You may also 
have a swimming pool pump or spa that’s on a 
large circuit.
As you switch the individual breakers on, you 
can see how much power each of the individual 
circuits consumes. (Make sure each appliance 
you check is turned on so that it’s drawing 
current.)
Here’s where things get interesting. You’ll prob-
ably find a circuit that draws current even when 
nothing is turned on in that room. In particular, 
note that TVs, computers, DVDs, and other 
digital devices draw current even when they’re 
turned off.
You can take this a step further by plugging in 
various small appliances like hair dryers, porta-
ble fans and heaters, electronic games, and so 
forth. You can see how fast the meter spins for 
each of these. Some of these little gadgets can 
make the meter look like the Tasmanian Devil.

Keeping Water Heaters in Check
The water heater accounts for about 20 percent of the typical home’s power 
budget. Dishwashers and washing machines use up to 80 percent of their 
energy on heating water, and only 20 percent running the mechanical equip-
ment. The cost of taking showers and baths is almost entirely in the cost of 
heating water.
Unfortunately, the typical domestic water heater is wasteful. It holds a con-
siderable amount of hot water, and when it’s not being used, heat seeps out 
of the tank, which is sheer inefficiency. The best water heaters have thick 
insulation, but some heat is still lost. So what can you do to save on water 
heating costs? Follow the advice in the following sections.
Paying attention to pipes
When you use hot water, not only do you drain the water you use from the hot 
water tank, but all the intervening plumbing fills with hot water as well. The 
amount of hot water trapped in your pipes can be significant, depending on 
how you’re using the water and how far away the faucet or tap is from the tank.
If you’re taking a bath, the amount of water in the pipes is small compared 
to the amount in the tub, so you’re not wasting a lot of hot water (aside from 
the fact that taking a bath is inherently wasteful compared to a shower). But 
if you’re simply filling a cup with hot water, you’re leaving a heck of a lot 
more hot water in the pipes than you’re actually using. You’re almost always 
better off heating water in the microwave oven than drawing it from a tap.
Staying on top of maintenance
Regular maintenance goes a long way toward maximizing the efficiency of 
your hot water heater. As with your HVAC system, you should have your 
domestic water heater tuned up periodically. (The gas version gets especially 
gummed up.) The following sections outline areas to pay attention to.
Draining the tank
Every four months or so, drain a quart of water from your tank. There’s a 
valve near the bottom of the unit for this very purpose. Before you begin, 
consider where the drained water is going to go. If the heater is in your 
garage, you can broom the water outdoors. Otherwise, you may need a drain 
bucket. Be sure the bucket is shallow enough to accommodate the valve.

172
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
The water you drain from your water heater’s tank can be very hot, so be 
careful.
Draining a quart of water directly from your water heater’s tank prevents 
sediment buildup, which affects efficiency. If you haven’t tackled this task in 
years, you’ll be shocked at how much crud comes out.
Changing the heating elements
Change the heating elements in your electric water heater every few years. 
(Most of them have two elements, one on top and one on bottom.) Use a 
stainless steel heater element if your old one is corroded. This change makes 
the unit operate more efficiently and avoids untimely failures.
When you buy the heater element, be sure to purchase a special wrench head 
that fits the element; ask the hardware store clerk to help you find the right 
wrench. (You may be able to borrow one from a friend and save some money. 
And if you don’t return it to your friend, you can save even more — although 
you may lose the friend.) Note that sometimes very old heating elements get 
stuck in place, in which case you can use WD-40: just spray it on, wait a day, 
and then give it another try.
Check out Bob Vila’s instructions for changing a water heater element on his 
Web site, www.bobvila.com. Click the “How To” tab for his home improve-
ment library, which gives you the step-by-step rundown.
Finding more ways to save
Beyond regular maintenance, you can do several things to make your water 
heater more efficient. Temperature, timing, and insulation are all factors that 
come into play:
 
 Set the water temperature lower. Most domestic water heaters are 
set at too high a temperature. Scalding water is too hot. For each 10°F 
reduction in water heater temperature, you can expect to lower your 
heating cost by 3 to 5 percent. You may find yourself dialing more hot 
water in your shower to get to the same comfort level, but so what? The 
most common problem you may encounter if you lower the temperature 
is that your dishwasher may not clean as well. You can usually remedy 
this issues by presoaking your challenging dishes (in cold water, no 
less) or by changing to a detergent that requires a lower temperature 
(read the label). See the upcoming section “Lessening the Load on Your 
Dishwasher” for more information.

173
 Chapter 6: Taking Control of Appliances and Electronics
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
 Use timers. Hot water heaters consume a lot of energy when they’re on. 
Most of them aren’t on all that much, but when they are, they gobble up 
power. Use a timer to turn off your hot water heater at night and during 
the day when you’re gone. Specialty hardware stores sell special units 
for this purpose. The salespeople can tell you how to install them.
 
 When you’re away from home for extended periods, turn the hot water 
heater off before you go. Either flip off the appropriate circuit breaker in 
your fuse box or turn off the gas valve (in which case you’ll have to re-
light the pilot). You may also be able to turn the temperature all the way 
down to minimum and then turn it back up when you return.
 
 Add insulation. Insulate the storage tank with a specially made blanket. 
Your utility company may give you one free. (Call the customer-service 
number and ask.) Or you can buy one for $10 to $20 at most hardware 
stores. A tank that’s warm to the touch is a clear sign that you’re losing 
heat and can save money and increase efficiency by adding insulation.
 
 Insulating your hot water pipes is easy, and a number of options are 
available. The best is a long, cylindrical piece of foam with a slit length-
wise — you just slide it over a pipe, and you’re done. Don’t worry 
about corners and inaccessible pipes — whatever you can cover helps 
increase efficiency. Another option is a fiberglass wrap that you roll 
around and around the pipe and then cover with a plastic tape material. 
The wrap covers the pipe more completely than the slit foam, but it’s a 
lot harder to install, especially if the pipe is close to a wall.
Considering a solar or 
tankless water heater
Most North Americans (almost 55 percent) heat their water with natural gas. 
About 38 percent heat water with electricity. (The few others heat with oil 
and liquid petro gas.) However, two types of water heaters are increasingly 
being used for their energy efficiency: solar and tankless water heaters.
 
 Solar water heaters are the best from an energy-efficiency standpoint, 
but the economics vary greatly from region to region and depend on 
your power rates and rate structure. From a pollution perspective, you 
can’t do better than solar.
 
 Tankless water heaters have no storage tank; they heat water as it is 
being used. They’re generally gas-powered because of the need for very 
high, instantaneous power. They’re more expensive than conventional 
water heaters, but if you don’t use much hot water, you can save big in 
the long run.

174
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
 Smaller units work with a single tap or faucet at one time, so if you have 
a large family and might need to run two showers simultaneously or 
you’re interested in taking a bath while you’re doing laundry, forget it. 
Large-capacity units cost around $1,000. (A conventional unit costs only 
$300.) Units can save the typical family $100 per year, so the payback in 
extra investment cost is around 7 years.
 
 Hybrid units combine the attractive features of tankless and traditional 
tank water heaters: They enable you to get an endless, energy-efficient 
supply of hot water from more than one faucet at a time. With a system 
that doles out energy based on how you’re using the system (and better 
utilizes that energy), hybrid units are extremely efficient. And they don’t 
require the maintenance that tankless and traditional water heaters do. 
Eternal is a gas version, and GE is working on gas and electric versions 
predicted to hit the market late in 2009.
Washing and Drying without the Crying
The average washing machine wastes more energy than any other appli-
ance in the home. With due diligence, most households can save 50 percent 
on operating costs and use 50 percent less water (including hot water, 
which costs a lot more than cold) just by changing the way they do laundry. 
Following are some practical tips.
Running hot or cold: Changing 
water temperature
A great way to save energy doing laundry is to use hot water only when you 
need to. Eighty-five percent of the energy used in washing is consumed by 
heating the water. A lot of people simply run their machines on hot all the 
time. You can easily save 25 percent on your washing costs by using cold 
water most of the time — in particular, for the rinse cycle. Look on the label 
of your detergent for the best ways to use cold water. You can also effec-
tively wash in cold water if you use detergent made for cold water. Check 
your detergent label to find its temperature requirement.
 
Another way to save energy is to make every member of the household 
responsible for cleaning his or her own clothes. You’ll see an instant 
decrease in wash-load quantity, especially if you have kids.

Adjusting load size, water level, and cycle
When you wash clothes, use as little water as necessary to get the job done. 
To that end, wash only full loads — it’s much more efficient, per item of 
clothing, than partial loads. Always adjust the water level to the lowest pos-
sible setting for the load size. For the smallest loads, use a mini-basket insert 
that fits over the agitator.
You can also take advantage of the cycles your washer offers. If yours has a 
presoak cycle, use it. Presoaking cycles save energy. They take more time, 
but so what? Some washers also let you choose the speed of the spin cycle. 
Faster spin speeds remove more water, resulting in less dryer time. If you’re 
using a clothesline, faster, longer spins make your life much easier because 
the clothes weigh less and pull the line down less.
Saving drying costs
Dryers use more power than every appliance save the washing machine and 
refrigerator. Saving money with your dryer is easy.
Avoiding the dryer altogether
The best way to save money on drying costs is to use a clothesline. Clothes 
dried outdoors smell much better, particularly if they’re in direct sunlight.
The best clothesline style for most users is an umbrella arrangement. (True 
to its name, it folds up like an umbrella.) You mount it into the ground and it 
rotates, so you can set your laundry basket down and move the line around 
as you pin up clothes. It features the most length of line for the least amount 
of space.
To determine the best location for your clothesline, consider the following:
 
 Convenience counts. If getting to the clothesline is a hassle, you’ll be 
less apt to use it. Garages work well, and they’re usually right next to the 
laundry. Open the garage door if you can. Otherwise, your garage will 
get humid.
 
 Air movement is helpful. A breezy spot with direct sunshine is ideal.
 
Not convinced fresh air can freshen clothes? Try this experiment: Take some 
sweaty, smelly workout clothes and simply hang them up in direct sunshine. 
Check them out a couple hours later — they may feel and smell better than 
clothes you run through the washing machine.

176
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Another way to avoid using the dryer is to hang clothes to dry indoors. A 
quick, easy way to dry small loads is to simply hang them over your shower 
curtain rod while you’re at work. You need some ventilation in your bath-
room or you’ll humidify your home, but maybe that’s what you want to do — 
especially in winter. You can also use drying racks anywhere in your house 
or even use a shower tension rod to hang clothes in hallways.
Putting (drying) time on your side
If you time the use of your dryer just right, you can take the best possible 
advantage of the heat it puts out. Consider the following tips to decrease 
your drying costs:
 
 Overdrying is hard on clothes, and it wastes energy. Take clothes out of 
the dryer just before they’re fully dry and hang them to finish the job.
 
 Many dryers have moisture sensors, which are much better than timed 
drying cycles. (Using a timer makes no sense at all, if you think about it.)
 
 Cool-down cycles are the most efficient because the dryer heater gradu-
ally shuts off and the residual heat finishes the cycle.
 
 Dry two or more loads in a row, thereby taking advantage of the dryer’s 
retained heat.
Taking care of your dryer’s ductwork
Dryers have vented pipes (around 4 inches in diameter) that lead outdoors. 
The purpose of these pipes is to vent the hot air to the outside environment. 
To work most efficiently, this vent pipe needs to be free of obstruction.
 
 Clean the removable filter every time you use the dryer. Keep a small 
waste bin by the machine so that you can toss the coagulated lint into it.
 
 Check your dryer ductwork. It may be clogged with years’ worth of 
accreted crud, which causes inefficiency. New ductwork is cheap. You 
can find it at any hardware store; ask the clerk for help.
 
 Where your ductwork ends outside you’ll find a vent, often with a flap-
ping door that opens and closes when the dryer is on and off (to keep 
birds and rodents out of the line). These vents often get dented and 
smashed, thereby restricting flow and wasting money. If possible, just get 
rid of the vent. Or replace the one you have with a better-working model.
 
 Buy a duct cleaner — a long, snaking wand with a big, bushy brush head 
that you cram down the duct line — but for the cost, you’re probably 
better off simply rebuilding the ductwork, assuming that you have easy 
access. Many ducts are built into walls, in which case you’re stuck with 
cleaning.
 
 Use the straightest, shortest duct possible. Ninety-degree bends cause 
your dryer to work harder and longer to accomplish the same task. In 
fact, most ductwork can be rebuilt to good advantage.

Keeping Your Cool with Refrigerators
The No. 1 way to save money with your refrigerator is to keep the coils clean. 
On either the bottom or the back of your unit is a meandering line of narrow 
tubing. Air is drawn over this tubing, and, over time, dust accumulates and 
clogs the flow, decreasing your refrigerator’s efficiency. You can get special 
brushes that enable you to brush the collected dust off the tubes, or you can 
simply use your vacuum cleaner.
Coils on the bottom of a refrigerator are harder to get to than those on the 
back, although for the latter, you have to move your refrigerator out. You’re 
likely to be shocked at how much dirt and crud accumulate behind your 
refrigerator. This stuff causes health problems.
If your refrigerator is 15 years old or more, a new one is undoubtedly cost-
effective. However, the greenest option is to use your fridge until it dies. 
Manufacturing a new one still hogs more energy than your old refrigerator. 
When the time comes to buy, look for a top-bottom model rather than a 
side-by-side. The top-bottom refrigerator arrangements use around 10 per-
cent less energy than their side-by-side counterparts. The payback on a new 
energy efficient refrigerator is less than five years.
Wondering what to do with your old fridge? You may be tempted to sell 
a refrigerator that still works, but you’re passing on the energy waste. 
Depending on where you live, you might be able to recycle it. Check out the 
Energy Star recycling program for details at www.recyclemyoldfridge.
com/findaprogram.aspx. If you aren’t near a recycling program, try con-
tacting a scrap metal dealer.
Beyond buying a new refrigerator, you can do other things to make the refrig-
erator you have run more efficiently. The following sections explain.
It’s what’s on the inside that counts
How you arrange your food, the temperature settings you select, and how 
much ice buildup you have in the freezer all contribute to how well or poorly 
your refrigerator works. Some advice:
 
 Check the temperature. If your refrigerator allows different tempera-
ture settings for different zones, adjust the temperatures accordingly. 
Recommended temperatures are 37–40°F for the refrigerator, and 5°F for 
the freezer. Long-term freezer storage (deep freezers) should be set at 0°F.
 
 Buy a refrigerator thermometer to keep tabs on what’s going on inside 
your fridge. They’re inexpensive, and you can easily move them around 
to different spots inside the refrigerator to get a more accurate reading.

178
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
 Defrost the freezer. Ice buildup makes for inefficiency.
 
 Eliminate overcrowding. When the air inside a refrigerator compart-
ment can’t move, the machinery has to work harder.
 
 Cover all foods in the compartments. Uncovered foods release a lot of 
moisture and make the compressor work harder. Besides, if you don’t 
cover the food, it’ll taste weird.
Close the door!
Keep your refrigerator’s doors closed as much as possible — an obvious 
piece of advice, perhaps, but worth stating anyway.
 
Tight seals are a must. If they’re tattered and leaking, you’re wasting up to 25 
percent of the refrigerator’s energy (even more if your home is hot). If you 
can’t change the seal, use some silicon sealant instead. (The same kind you 
buy for bathtubs and sinks works just fine.) Follow these steps:
 
1. Spray cooking spray over the metal frame surface of the refrigerator 
where the seal should be located.
 
2. Squirt the silicon over the seal.
 
3. Close the door and let the material dry.
One refrigerator or two?
Operating one large refrigerator is much more efficient than operating two 
smaller units. A lot of people have a refrigerator in their garage — usually the 
one that used to be in the kitchen. You may not want to throw it away, but old 
reefers cost a lot of money. That unit in your garage is costing you a lot more 
than the new one. Is it worth it? What do you have in there, anyway? Drinks 
for the kids? A whole pig? You can surely live without two refrigerators.
Lessening the Load on Your Dishwasher
Dishwashers use as much energy as clothes washers and dryers. Around 80 
percent of this energy is consumed by heating the water — which means that 
one way to maximize your energy efficiency is to reduce the amount of hot 
water your dishwasher uses. Another way to save energy is to modify the 
way you rinse your dishes and load the dishwasher. The following sections 
explain.

179
 Chapter 6: Taking Control of Appliances and Electronics
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
Believe it or not, a detailed scientific study was performed to determine 
whether hand-washing or machine-washing dishes is more efficient. Hand-
washing a complete 12-piece setting of dishes in a sink used around 30 
gallons of water and 2.5 kWh of electricity for water heating. An automatic 
dishwasher used only 4 gallons and 1.5kWh of electricity. Not only that, but 
impartial judges determined the dishes from the machine were much cleaner.
Using less hot water
New dishwashers heat their own water, which is far more efficient than draw-
ing hot water from the water heater the way older models do. Keep this fea-
ture in mind if you’re in the market for a new dishwasher.
In addition, dishwashers get warm and heat your kitchen. In the winter, this 
extra warmth is welcomed. In the summer, it makes your air conditioner 
work harder. During warm months, use the no-heat dry option. If your 
machine doesn’t have a no-heat option, simply stop it after the rinse cycle, 
open the door, and let the dishes dry that way.
 
In the summer, the dishwasher humidifies your house quite a bit. Get some 
ventilation going to get that humidity out of the house, and you’ll feel cooler.
Unless your dishwasher heats its own water, the temperature of the water 
from your domestic heater may affect the quality of your dishwasher’s per-
formance. If the water isn’t hot enough, your machine will have a hard time 
doing the job. However, some detergents are rated for a lower water tem-
perature. (For more information on water heaters, refer to the earlier section 
“Keeping Water Heaters in Check.”)
Changing the way you rinse and load
The key to greener dishwashing is to minimize how much water you use. 
Here are some suggestions to help you do that:
 
 Rinse dishes as little as possible. In fact, just scraping off large chunks 
of food without rinsing at all is often sufficient. Most dishwashers do a 
good job of getting rid of caked-on, hard stuff. New models have special 
cycles that steam-heat the crud and loosen it up.
 
 Always run a full load. Your dishwasher uses just as much water to 
wash a few dishes as a full load, so make the most of the water you use.
 
 Try skipping the prerinse cycle on your dishwasher and using the 
economy wash cycle. You probably won’t be able to tell the difference.

Eating Up Power with Stoves 
and Microwaves
Depending on how much you cook in your home, energy costs for your stove 
and microwave can be significant. You can do a number of easy things to 
save costs, and in this section, you find the best and easiest candidates.
Checking out efficient ovens
Some ovens (both microwave and conventional) are just plain more efficient 
than others. Some have features that offer extra efficiency, and some are 
more efficient even without the extra features.
 
 Self-cleaning ovens: These ovens are more efficient because they have 
higher insulation levels, which means that less heat is lost while you’re 
cooking.
 
 Gas ovens with pilotless ignition: One of these ovens saves you 30 per-
cent over its lifetime, and the air in your home will be cleaner. With pilot 
lights, some gas is always being burned. (You can usually see the little 
blue flame wavering near the burner.) With a pilotless gas stove, a spark 
plug type device ignites the gas each time the burner is turned on.
 
 Convection ovens: Convection ovens incorporate a small, high-temper-
ature fan that moves the internal air in the oven compartment thereby 
bringing more heat into contact with the food being baked. Convection 
ovens are very efficient because they allow you to bake in less time, with 
less energy.
Altering your cooking techniques
You don’t have to use a conventional oven to cook a hot meal. Sometimes the 
following appliances do the job more efficiently:
 
 Toaster ovens: Use a toaster oven for small jobs. Small toaster ovens 
(the kind that sit on your countertop) take much less energy than big 
conventional ovens. And if you know how to use them properly, you can 
get great browning effects. They don’t cost much, but you’re better off 
getting a good one with an automatic timer and temperature controls.

181
 Chapter 6: Taking Control of Appliances and Electronics
Book II
Energy 
Efficiency
 
 Barbecue grills: Use your barbecue as much as possible in the summer. 
From an efficiency standpoint, gas models are the best. Charcoal grills 
waste a lot of energy (you can’t turn them off and on, as needed), plus 
they put out far more pollution. Small propane barbecues work very 
well and, contrary to what some people claim, they don’t make the food 
stink. Burning petro-based charcoal is no different from burning petro-
based natural gas. Look instead for 100 percent hardwood charcoal 
made from scrap lumber.
 
 Crock pots and portable pressure cookers: In the summer, put them 
outdoors to save air-conditioning costs and lower humidity.
You can also employ energy-saving strategies like the following:
 
 Bake dishes simultaneously. Try to fill your oven with a number of 
dishes at the same time. Doing so lowers the per-item cooking cost. If 
different items call for different temperatures, relax; there’s wiggle room. 
Put the items that need higher temperatures on the top rack, and items 
that need lower temperatures on the lower rack.
 
 Don’t preheat. Let your food warm up with the oven. And turn your 
stove off a few minutes before the allotted cooking time — the residual 
heat will finish the process. In winter, take advantage of the extra heat 
from your oven by leaving its door open after you turn it off.
 
 Don’t lay foil on racks. Foil obstructs the natural flow of heat.
 
 Use glass or ceramic pans in the oven. The food cooks more efficiently, 
and the texture is better.
 
 Match the pan to the size of the heating element on the stove. This 
way, no heat escapes around the edges.
 
 Contain heat in the summer. Putting a lid on that boiling pot reduces 
the amount of heat and humidity that’s released into the air, and it 
brings water to a boil faster. Rinse pans out as soon as practical to cool 
them down.
 
 Release heat in the winter. In cold weather, let hot pots and pans 
release their heat into your home. Don’t rinse them out because that 
washes the heat right down the drain.
Enjoying the Fine Life with 
TVs and Computers
Although the new flat-screen televisions reduce power consumption, the 
trend toward gigantic screens drives consumption right back up. Combine 
a big screen with a big sound system, and your entertainment center may 

182
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
be costing you an arm and a leg. Computers and their various components 
and accessories constitute a similar category of common household energy-
eaters. What’s a modern person to do?
For starters, be aware that “off” doesn’t always mean what it implies. Even 
when your TV, entertainment system, computer, monitor, DVD player, and 
so on are sitting idle, they’re still drawing power. You can put a halt to this 
energy drain by plugging these appliances into a power strip and turning off 
the power strip when you’re not using them.
In the same vein, always use the power down feature on your computer and 
turn your computer off any time that you won’t be using it for at least four 
hours, like at night and on weekends. Remember, even in sleep mode, power 
is being wasted. Don’t forget to turn off your printer when it’s not in use, too.
Some processors use a lot more juice than others. Laptop computers use a 
lot less power than desktops, so if you can, opt for a laptop.
Old CRT monitors draw considerably more power than the new, flat-screen ver-
sions. They also put out a lot of extra heat, requiring more air conditioning in 
the summer. So you may want to update (unless, of course, you’re looking for 
heat in your home office, in which case you may want to keep your old CRT).
Buying New Appliances
Most of the time, you don’t have a choice over whether to buy a new appli-
ance. The old one breaks, it can’t be repaired, and you come to the difficult 
conclusion that it’s time for a funeral. Many people also decide that upgrad-
ing to an energy-efficient model is worth the investment.
Fortunately, the government has made your decision process easy for you with 
the Energy Star program. (Yes, a government program that actually works the 
way it’s supposed to — take advantage of this rare opportunity!) The Energy 
Star is awarded to appliances that significantly exceed the minimum national 
efficiency standards, typically by 20 percent, and by as much as 110 percent. 
Energy Star ratings apply to nearly all major appliances, plus HVAC systems, 
natural gas and oil systems, programmable thermostats, and so on. 
The Energy Star label shows the product’s annual power consumption. Even 
better, note the annual cost estimates based on different utility rates. On 
these labels, the highest rate is 12 cents, which is somewhat anachronistic in 
light of rising energy rates. But multiplying the costs based on your own rates 
is easy enough. For instance, if you’re paying 16 cents, simply multiply the 
result based on 8 cents by two.

You can easily compare different models of appliances using the Energy Star 
labels. Simply compare the estimated annual costs. You can then compare 
the difference in price with the difference in costs.
 
If you want to buy an energy-efficient appliance, buy one with an Energy Star 
certification; it’s that simple. You can get super-duper-efficient models, but 
they tend to cost a lot more than they’re worth. These are generally for the 
off-grid crowd, or those willing to pay any price to go green. For the most part, 
if you buy an Energy Star model and use it efficiently, you’re doing very well.

sing sunshine effectively isn’t as simple as just letting the sun shine in. 
Obviously, in the winter, you want both the sunshine and its heat in 
your home as much as possible. In the summer, you want the sun’s light but 
not the heat — two goals that are almost always at odds.
In this chapter, you find out how to heat your home in the winter and avoid 
doing so in the summer. We show you how to light your home with sunshine, 
and how to plan and build sunrooms that increase the value of your home 
and provide increased living area at an efficient cost. For much greater detail 
on this subject, check out Solar Power Your Home For Dummies (Wiley) by 
Rik DeGunther.
Lighting Your Home with Sunshine
The more you use sunshine to light your home, the less you need to rely on 
artificial lighting. Using sunshine to your advantage also creates a kinder, 
more inviting atmosphere. The following sections outline a variety of ways 
to manipulate sunlight and reap all the benefits it has to offer. (For details 
on how to deal with the heat factor, head to the later section “Heating Your 
Home with Sunlight — or Not.”)

186
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Planting a tree
By far the best way to control sunlight in your home is to strategically locate 
deciduous trees (those that lose their leaves in the winter) around your 
home’s exterior. If you plant a single deciduous tree outside a southern-
exposed window, particularly a large window, you benefit in many ways.
In the summer, the leaves block most of the sunlight, leaving the room with 
diffused, subtle, cool light. On a hot summer day, harsh sunlight makes you 
feel even hotter, but shade creates a sense of calm and well-being, not to 
mention relief. In the winter, with the leaves gone, direct sunlight enters the 
room, casting the interior with warmth (due to the greenhouse effect), as well 
as a bright, yellow tint that feels warm.
Making natural light more effective
You can make the most of whatever natural light is available to you. Here 
are a number of clever ways to increase the effectiveness of sunlight in your 
home’s interior spaces:
 
 Put up mirrors to enhance existing light. Position your mirrors in cor-
ners to broadcast light around the entire room. In essence, mirrors mag-
nify light. Two mirrors positioned catty-corner on opposing walls work 
even better and make the room seem much larger.
 
 Before you nail a mirror up permanently, try it out at different times of 
the day to gauge its effect. If you want more light in the morning than 
the evening, put the mirror on an eastern-facing wall. Also keep in mind 
that mirrored closet doors often work wonders to light a bedroom and 
increase its perceived size.
 
 Use glass bricks to let light in. Cut some high holes through the solid 
walls of a dark hallway (it doesn’t matter whether the walls lead to 
other rooms or outdoors) and put glass bricks into the spaces so that 
light enters the hallway. Doing so not only spreads light but also makes 
the hallway seem larger and less restrictive. In fact, your entire home 
will feel friendlier and more open. Installing glass bricks is a relatively 
straightforward and inexpensive do-it-yourself project. (Ask for more 
details at your hardware store.)
 
 Use windowed doors. Instead of the usual solid wood doors, install 
French doors between rooms. You can get French doors from most any 
building-supply stores. Even if you use curtains for privacy, the light 
will still shine through, and your home will seem more spacious. You’re 
likely to find one location in your home that’s a perfect candidate for a 
French door.

187

Book II

Efficiency
 
 Don’t forget the front door. Glass panels can lighten up your entryway, 
and guests will find them more inviting than a solid, impersonal mass of 
heavy wood staring them in the face.
 
 Get rid of overgrowth. If vegetation is crowding the light through one 
of your windows, cut it back. Trimming overgrown bushes is especially 
important with windows facing east because morning sunlight works 
much better than coffee.
 
 Clean or tint your windows. Spotless windows make a huge difference 
in the way a room feels. Cleaning may not matter much in terms of the 
quantity of light coming in, but it definitely enhances the quality, which 
may be even more important.
 
 If your problem is that a room gets too much sunshine (or you want to 
obscure a view to the outside without using blinds), apply window tint-
ing. Tinting comes in sheet tape form, and anybody can put it up. (Well, 
pretty much anybody — it helps if you don’t have ten thumbs.) You can 
get a similar benefit from lace or sheer curtains.
Installing skylights
For those of you with more advanced ambitions, skylights can make a big dif-
ference in your home’s lighting for a relatively small investment.
Traditional skylights are big, expansive channelers of sunlight, and the large 
openings in your home’s ceiling will make a room bigger and airier, both liter-
ally and figuratively. If you’re interested in skylights, consult with a contrac-
tor unless you’re really good with tools and projects.
 
Skylights are very expensive to install. If you want multiple skylights, con-
sider doing them all at the same time. Installing three or four skylights at one 
time takes around twice as much time and money (rather than three or four 
times as much) — food for thought when you’re deciding how many skylights 
to install.
Opting for solar tubes
If you like the idea of skylights but not the amount of dough they require, 
then consider solar light tubes. Also known as tubular skylights, they’re a less 
expensive alternative to skylights. Solar light tubes let in natural light that 
varies with the clouds and the weather. Solar tubes, which can be installed 
by just about anybody in half a day for around $250, can have just as much 
effect as a traditional skylight for around one tenth of the cost. (The typical 
price, uninstalled, is $200 for a four-foot-long pipe. Extensions cost an addi-
tional $20 per foot.)

188
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Here’s how a solar light tube system works: Sunlight is collected up on the 
roof and transmitted down a shiny, silver pipe into a diffuser, which broad-
casts the light into the room below.
If you’re interested in solar tubes, keep these points in mind:
 
 You can make most rooms bright enough to work in during daylight 
hours, even in the winter. Large-diameter units (12 inches and more) 
can output as much light as a dozen 100-watt light bulbs, at one tenth 
the heat. Because they don’t produce as much heat you can use your 
air-conditioner much less.
 
 One of the best locations for a solar tube is a dark corner in the family 
room, where the light will be well used and have a dramatic effect. Solar 
light tubes are also good for dark, isolated bathrooms. The natural light 
is comforting, and you never have to flip a light switch during the day. 
If you have a dark kitchen, a solar tube may be the perfect solution, 
especially if a lot of people come and go during the day. The light switch 
won’t be constantly flipped off and on.
 
 The intensity of light changes quite a bit because solar light varies 
with the clouds and weather. On a partly cloudy day, you can get a lot 
of fluctuation as clouds move across the sun, making you much more 
conscious of the outdoors.
 
 The tubes themselves can drastically change the way decor looks. Be 
prepared for a drastically different room because lighting is very influ-
ential in terms of how a room “feels.” Also, the silver color imparts a 
certain “cool” mood. Some types of solar light tubes come with filters for 
creating moods, but the filters cut out light as well.
 
 Installation isn’t easy (you have to go up into your attic space), but it’s 
doable. When deciding where to install solar light tubes, always keep 
the installation itself in mind. Just forget about installing these tubes in 
locations where you can’t easily go — like shallow attic spaces or near 
the edges of the attic. Better to get a professional because you certainly 
don’t want to create leaks.
Heating Your Home with 
Sunlight — or Not
In addition to being a great light source, sunlight is a great source of heat — 
which is wonderful when you want heat, but not so wonderful when you want 
to stay cool. Fortunately, you can regulate how much heat the sun generates 
in your home.

189
 Chapter 7: Controlling Solar Exposure for Light and Heat

Efficiency
First, you need to understand the greenhouse effect. The best way to describe 
how sunshine heats a home is to explain how a greenhouse works. Sunlight 
enters the enclosed space through the glazing, or window material, and then 
gets absorbed and turned into heat. The heat stays in the enclosed space 
thanks to the glazing’s insulation properties.
 
You can enhance the greenhouse effect — and make your home warmer — by 
increasing the transmissibility of the window and maximizing its insulation. 
Double-pane glass works well for this goal, and you can also use a number of 
window coatings and other optical tricks to good effect. Inexpensive plastic 
materials that work well are available, although they tend to blur the view.
To maximize the heat generated, the space must be well sealed to prevent 
air leakage, although the greenhouse effect is often powerful enough to work 
well even in relatively leaky environments. In fact, sometimes it works so well 
that the heat is intolerable. (The greenhouse effect explains why your car 
gets so hot when it sits out in the summer sunshine.) So how do you reduce 
the greenhouse effect when you don’t want all that heat? Easy. By controlling 
the amount of sunshine that enters your home.
Installing blinds and sunscreens
When you install blinds or shades, you control the amount of sunlight that 
enters your home. An added benefit is that these things can also increase the 
beauty of your home and, if you’re really smart (of course, you are — you’re 
reading this book), you can use blinds and shades to insulate, or maintain 
heat storage, as well.
Bare glass lets the sun enter freely. Using blinds or sunshades (and even 
curtains) restricts the amount of sunlight that enters and, depending on how 
they’re hung (whether on the inside or outside of the window, and how far 
from the window), affects the insulation properties, as Table 7-1 outlines.

Hanging blinds: Inside or out?
When you hang blinds on the inside of windows, the sunshine comes in 
through the window, strikes the blind, and gets converted into heat. The heat 
is trapped in the air gap between the blind and the window and can get very 
hot because of the greenhouse effect. Of course, heat is desirable only in 
the winter. In the summer, you may have a cooler room if you just leave the 
window uncovered and let the sun and air in.
You can use blinds to accomplish several goals:
 
 To warm a room in winter: Contrary to what you may think, the best 
way to heat a room with sunshine in the winter is not to open the blinds, 
but to use special blinds that capture sunlight and insulate at the same 
time. You can get interior blinds made to do just that. Look for cellular 
shades, which hold air to provide insulation.
 
 To keep a room cool in summer: Interior blinds made for summer 
reflect a lot of light back out the window. They’re usually shiny and 
white, at least on the exterior-facing surface.
 
 To get the best cooling effect, allow for some ventilation between a blind 
and the open window it covers. If you can’t do that, use a blind that has 
a shiny, metallic exterior surface that simply reflects all sunlight and 
doesn’t let any heat into the room at all. The room will be completely 
dark, but this is desirable on a burning hot day.
 
 To maximize the efficiency of an air conditioner: When your air condi-
tioner is on, it’s best to hang blinds so that they create as much insulation 
as possible and banish sunlight. You can achieve this goal by closing your 
interior blinds all the way. If you have outside shades, all the better. The 
best scheme for a sunny home that uses a lot of air conditioning is both 
solar screens (see the next section, “Putting up sunscreens”) and interior 
blinds. The home will be very dark, but it will also be much cooler.

191
 Chapter 7: Controlling Solar Exposure for Light and Heat

Putting up sunscreens
Sunscreens, also called solar screens, are an inexpensive and effective way to cool 
your home in the summer. They reflect a lot of sunlight — up to 90 percent — 
plus they create an insulation barrier on the outside. Most are dark, heavy-duty, 
fabric screens with a tacky surface. Some are a flexible, tinted plastic film. You 
can get sunscreens up to 8 feet wide, with unlimited length.
 
Only windows that get more than a few hours of direct sunlight a day are 
worth sun screening. The best candidates are tall windows facing south, but 
east and west exposures can also get very hot. With a solar screen tacked up 
on the outside of a window, most of the sunlight is reflected before it even 
gets to the window. The screen gets hot and an insulation barrier keeps that 
heat trapped, but it’s all outside the window.
You don’t want sunscreens in the winter, which means you need to mount 
them in such a way that you can bring them down in the winter. Sunscreens 
are easy to put up, and most people can do it themselves. Call a screen shop 
for tools, materials, and installation advice. Easy-to-use mounting hardware is 
essential. (For automatic sunscreens, you’ll need a professional installation.)
 
Before you go the do-it-yourself route, ask the shop what it would charge to 
install sunscreens for you. Their employees can do a window in a few min-
utes, and the bid for the entire job may not be much more than what you’ll 
pay for the material alone.
You can expect at least a three-year lifetime with quality sunscreen, at 
around 75 cents per square foot. For a 3-foot x 6-foot window, if a screen 
lasts five years, the cost is only $2 per year (with the cheapest installation 
method). If your climate is hot and sunny, there’s no question you’ll get 
good payback on this small investment. Cheap screen bleaches out and looks 
perpetually dirty — avoid it unless you like cheap and perpetually dirty.
Infrared filtering glass
You can get special glass that filters infrared 
light out before it gets into your home. In fact, 
most of the sunlight’s heat comes from light that 
is invisible to the human eye. Some animals (like 
owls and nocturnal hunters) can see infrared 
light, but humans can’t see it. Infrared filtering 
glass rejects up to 70 percent of the heat of 
sunlight, yet you can’t tell the difference in the 
view because it transmits visible light as well 
as a conventional window. Solar screens and 
other sunlight-inhibiting processes inhibit the 
view, which you may not want if your window 
is a centerpiece to a home that features lavish 
views. You’ll pay more for infrared glass, but it 
may be just the thing.

192
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
Covering your windows 
with exterior awnings
Awnings are great light shades because you can configure them in different 
geometrical relationships and control the light over the course of a day. They 
also drastically change the appearance of your home for the better. They add 
shape and break up monotonous flat surfaces and also complement the color 
scheme of your home’s exterior.
Two common awning styles are the Venetian awning and the hood awning:
 
 Venetian awnings allow sunlight in the winter, when the sun is low 
in the sky, and block sunlight in the summer, when the sun is high. 
Venetians also allow you to see out of the top of your window, and the 
effect is much more open than that of hood awnings.
 
 Hood awnings are more decorative. They can be made of nice fabrics 
that match or complement the house. They work better in rainy climates 
because they keep cold water off your windows. (You can lose a lot of 
heat by water-based convection from rain.)
Installing outdoor window blinds
Outdoor blinds, which are designed to cover windows from the outside, stop 
the heat on the outside of the home. Plus in the winter, these blinds can act 
as insulators.
Outdoor blinds are usually made of vinyl. Some are prettier than others, 
which may or may not matter to you. Import shops stock different sizes of 
roll-up bamboo shades, often priced as low as $5 apiece.
These blinds are also commonly used overhead for patios and porches where 
late afternoon and evening sunlight can prevent you from using the area. In 
these situations, leave them up all day, or your floor will heat up. (Concrete 
or tile floors hold heat for a long time.)
Most outdoor blinds have cords that you pull different ways, but if you don’t 
want to raise and lower the blinds manually, you can find outdoor blinds that 
retract automatically. Automatic retractable shades are available from spe-
cialty suppliers. You can even find solar-powered retractors that work with a 
hand-held remote controller.

Putting up radiant barriers
A radiant barrier is a sheet of thin material that looks like reinforced alumi-
num foil. It’s tacked up beneath your roof joists or simply laid over the insula-
tion on your attic floor. It does a good job of keeping a lot of heat out of your 
home in summer, but its benefits for keeping heat inside your home during 
winter are less pronounced.
The material itself costs around 20 cents per square foot. For a 2,000-square-
foot house, the material costs $400, and the payback can be very impressive. 
In hot climates, radiant barriers cool the home down more than enough to 
pay for themselves in less than a couple years.
To install a radiant barrier, you simply staple it into place, regardless of 
whether you mount it overhead or lay it on the floor. (Make sure that you 
have a good quality stapler.) The design of your roof impacts how easy instal-
lation will be. Open rafters are the best candidates; if you have complex 
trusses, forget it. Installation, however, is a snap if your attic floor is open 
and easily accessible.
 
Even if you can cover only a portion of the rafters or floor, it’s worth it. Try to 
cover an entire small area, rather than isolated spots in a number of different 
areas.
 
Attics can roast you fast. They heat to over 130°F, easy. Don’t kid yourself; 
if it feels real hot, it can be dangerous. One way to stay safe is to work in the 
morning, when things are cooler.
Cutting out summer sunlight 
with overhangs
Overhangs, which are solid constructions built over windows, can provide 
both financial gain and aesthetic beauty. You can design an overhang to visu-
ally complement your home’s roofline.
Here’s how overhangs work: In the winter, sunlight can enter the home 
because the sun is lower in the sky. If you have high thermal mass floors (like 
concrete or tile), your home will heat up nicely. In the summertime, when the 
sun is higher in the sky, the overhang stops any direct sunlight from entering 
the home.

194
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
 
Be sure the overhang you install changes your home’s appearance for the 
better. (The best-looking overhangs mimic the pitch of your roof and use the 
same materials.) Before you nail an overhang up and make it permanent, try to 
arrange it where it’s going to go and see what it looks like. Alternatively, take a 
digital photo of the window and use a computer program to play around with 
different ideas. You can find overhang designs in home plan books.
Garnering Sunlight with Greenhouses 
and Sunrooms
There are two types of solar rooms: greenhouses and sunrooms. 
Greenhouses, which are either connected to your home or separate from it, 
can help warm your home as well as provide inexpensive, delicious, highly 
nutritious food or beautiful and soothing decorative plants. Sunrooms, which 
are always part of your home, add living space and square footage for a rela-
tively low cost, increase the efficiency of your heating and cooling efforts, 
and brighten up your home’s ambience and decor.
A well-designed solar room can work efficiently even in very cold climates, 
giving you a nice, warm escape from the winter. However, a solar room does 
tend to lose a lot of heat during the night.
Most home additions cost more than your property value increases due 
to the improvement. But with solar rooms, the variety of designs and the 
reduced building restrictions make it possible to enjoy profitable apprecia-
tions, especially if you do it yourself.
 
Plant deciduous trees at the same time you build your solar room. They’ll 
cut back the sun in the summer and allow it all in during the winter. Plus, the 
room will be much prettier with a view of some nice trees. Partnering with 
Mother Nature brings a benign continuity to the entire project.
Deciding between the different 
types of solar rooms
So which type of solar room is better: greenhouse or sunroom? That answer 
depends on what you want to achieve and which type of room you prefer.
Greenhouses invite the maximum amount of sunlight and generally require a 
glass ceiling or sloping glass walls. In addition:

195
 Chapter 7: Controlling Solar Exposure for Light and Heat

Efficiency
 
 They’re very functional.
 
 They need a water supply.
 
 Their temperatures need to be regulated (the difference between the 
hottest and coldest temperatures needs to be kept to a minimum, as dic-
tated by the type of plants).
 
 They need adequate ventilation to provide oxygen for plants.
 
 They need floors that can withstand water leaks and mud spillage.
Sunrooms, on the other hand, are designed as extensions of your home’s 
living space. You can leave them partially open to the outdoors, or you can 
completely enclose them and put in carpeting and fine furniture. Because too 
much sunlight is uncomfortable and sunrooms are meant to be inviting, they 
generally have water-tight, solid roofs. They may or may not contain sky-
lights and vents, but both increase the livability factor.
In both types of solar rooms, most of the southern wall space is taken up by 
windows or some other suitable glazing material. In addition, both green-
houses and sunrooms can increase a home’s privacy by providing a buffer 
between the outside world and the interior spaces.
The best location in your house is adjacent to the kitchen for attached green-
houses, and adjacent to the living room or family room for solar rooms. 
These locations afford not only the most efficient use, but also the most 
use in general. Leaving the doors and windows open between your house 
and sunroom lends a sense of increased floor space and size to your home. 
(Building a solar room off your family room is the cheapest way to increase 
the square footage of your home.)
Building a solar room yourself
A do-it-yourselfer can design and build a sunroom or greenhouse at a rela-
tively low cost with relatively low risk. These rooms can be separate from 
the house and, as such, don’t need electrical wiring or plumbing and don’t 
require that you obey all the building code requirements that are unavoid-
able inside of a home.
 
If you don’t want to have to apply for building permits or have the property 
value reappraised (with the commensurate increase in property taxes), build 
the sunroom against a house, but don’t actually nail the frame elements 
to the home — in this case, it’s just a free-standing porch. (Keep in mind, 
though, that if you ever sell your house, you can’t advertise your solar room 
as part of your house’s square footage.)

196
Book II: Energy Efficiency 
If you plan to add a solar room to your home, kits are the best bets for 
do-it-yourselfers. (Greenhouse kits made of plastic sheets instead of windows 
are easy, cheap, and effective.) Fortunately, an entire industry is dedicated to 
manufacturing and selling prefab kits that cost anywhere from a few hundred 
dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars. You can see samples in show-
rooms. Remember to touch things before you buy; photos are often mislead-
ing and rarely reflect reality the way you expect them to.
Alternatively you can build your own custom design and use the same mate-
rials (windows, framing, trim) as the rest of your house. As much as a well-
designed solar room can enhance your home’s aesthetics, a poorly designed 
one can make your house look awkward and uninviting.
 
Easy and straightforward candidates for solar rooms are existing porches 
and decks that already have the basic support structures and flooring in 
place. All you need to do is build up and around them.

at your cleaning projects.
Clean doesn’t have to mean dangerous, and in these chap-

any conventional cleaning practices add to environmental damage by 
using energy, wasting resources, and polluting the Earth. Does this 
risk mean that it’s better to skip the cleaning altogether? (Wouldn’t that be 
a great excuse to do away with housework?) By recognizing the relationship 
between your cleaning practices and the environment, you can identify ways 
to “green” your housekeeping for a healthier planet and a healthier home.
This chapter shows you that you can have a clean house, and green it, too.
Waking Up to a New Awareness
No doubt about it: What happens in Peoria affects Patagonia. And Paris. And 
Punxsutawney. The water wasted in Scranton hurts villages in the Sahara. 
The traffic congestion in Atlanta warms the ice caps in the Arctic. If only it 
were true that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. But people there and 
throughout the world are waking up to the fact that their actions can affect 
the climate, damage the planet, and use up stuff you may really want to keep.
How you clean has an impact on the environment, too. Greening the way you 
mop your floors may seem like a drop in the bucket, but each small change 
accumulates into a larger stream. Maybe you can’t save the Antarctic pen-
guins this morning, but you can hold off running the dishwasher until you 
have a full load. Action by action, you can make positive changes.

Book III: Green Cleaning 
Ramping up to a greener clean
 
Your housekeeping practices intersect with big-picture ecological issues at 
many junctures. Look for these connections:
 
 Plugging petroleum consumption: Plug in, turn on, flip the switch, and 
press the button. Your home’s appliances, temperature control, operat-
ing systems, and even water delivery run on energy generated by fossil 
fuel. Petroleum is also a critical component of most plastic containers 
that hold everything from ketchup to tile cleaner.
 
 Modifying your cleaning routine — decreasing the number of laundry 
loads, updating old, inefficient appliances, and even turning down the 
temperature on your water heater — can play a big role in reducing your 
household energy consumption. Throughout this book, you find alterna-
tives to energy-intense cleaning methods.
 
 Clearing the air: Not only do many home furnishings and materials 
include petroleum, some forms can cause harm to the environment and 
to anyone who lives in your home, contaminating water systems and 
emitting unhealthy chemicals. Blame it on paint, particleboard in cabi-
nets, vinyl flooring, and carpeting and upholstery, but air quality in the 
typical American home can be worse than the outdoor air. Commercial 
household cleaning products are also culpable.
 
 Blocking the drain on water: You thought oil was in short supply. 
Water is being depleted at an alarming rate, through drought, pollution, 
and commoditization by big business interests. Changing your cleaning 
habits helps reduce your contribution to water shortage: Using energy-
efficient washing machines, taking shorter showers, and using your dis-
posal less all help.
 
 Taking out the trash: Landfills climb ever higher as the world popula-
tion continues to consume. Cleaning practices can contribute to the 
problem. Choosing reusable dust cloths over paper towels or throw-
aways; being mindful of the packaging that accompanies new cleaning 
products; and even purchasing cleaning appliances designed to last help 
reduce your contribution to the waste stream.
Finding benefits close to home
Cleaning green is good for the planet, but it’s also good for you. As you begin 
making changes to your housekeeping practices, you’re certain to discover 
the following benefits:
 
 Better health: Removing harmful chemicals (found in many conven-
tional cleaners) improves air quality in your home, thereby having a 
positive effect on the health of its inhabitants.

 More savings: Energy-efficient appliances, although sometimes more 
costly upfront, mean you spend less on energy and reduce water usage. 
You gain even more savings when you simplify your cleaning arsenal 
with homemade recipes concocted from common ingredients that cost 
pennies compared to commercial cleaners.
 
 Deeper commitment: Cleaning green can be one of those “gateway” 
experiences that lead to a heightened awareness of other ecoconscious 
practices. Every green step you take elevates you to the next level, 
where you discover yet other ways to make sustainable changes to your 
life and to the world.
 
The sum total of your actions as they affect the environment is referred to 
as your carbon footprint. This footprint is usually measured by the amount of 
CO2 that a household generates per year. In the United States, the average 
annual household footprint is 55,000 pounds. That’s more than twice as high 
as Germany’s footprint, and nearly four times that of the average Swedish 
household. Here’s the good news: Just like when you diet to lose weight, you 
can go on a diet — a low-carbon diet — to reduce your carbon footprint. And 
the way you clean your house, among all the other activities that are part of 
your life, has an impact on how much weight you can take off.
Looking into greener practices
Making changes, even small ones, takes preparation. And figuring out your 
plan of attack is an important step when launching your new clean-green 
assault. Here’s what you need to do:
 
 Employ better tactics. One of the cornerstones of sustainability is to 
avoid the need to consume resources and expend energy: If you can take 
a bus to work, for example, why buy a car? A great place to start clean-
ing green is to consider the stuff you need to clean. A white carpet takes 
more effort to maintain than a tile floor. Dry cleaning is more costly 
(from environmental damage to personal budget) than washing at home. 
You get the idea.
 
 This advice parlays to housekeeping in a bunch of ways: from imple-
menting routines to prevent your home from getting dirty (taking off 
your shoes at the front door), to recognizing that you don’t need sepa-
rate cleaning formulas for each surface and room in your home.
 
 Stock better tools. Choosing tools and cleaning aids that do the least 
amount of damage to the environment is another important component 
of sustainable cleaning. Mop systems, for example, are a great conve-
nience for modern housekeepers. But their throwaway mop heads are a 
green strike against them. Single-use wipes, likewise, are wasteful when 
an old towel or diaper can do the job again and again.

202
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 Simplifying your tools — gathering a few that serve many purposes 
rather than dozens that all perform a single specialized task — and 
investing in durable items that last are steps for greening your utility 
closet.
 
 Switch to better ingredients. Cleaning formulas made of petroleum-
based chemicals may rid your home of undesirable elements (dirt, mold, 
grime, germs), but may also introduce unhealthy chemicals into your 
home. If the same cleaner that kills the germs that were making you sick 
now emits a fume that makes you sick, are you really ahead?
 
 An easy and inexpensive way to reduce the fossil fuel in your cleaners 
is to make your own with common household items such as vinegar and 
salt. Some of the recipes in Chapter 3 of this book take just seconds to 
make and can clean a host of household surfaces.
Formulating a new green clean
 
Reducing reliance on fossil fuels is a key step toward sustainability. It’s an 
effort that requires the cooperation of big government and big industry. But 
individuals who want to be part of the solution are discovering that manage-
able changes in their own lives can bring about big-impact changes, include 
cutting down on use of gasoline — whether that means downsizing from an 
SUV, trading in for a hybrid car, or taking the bus to work — and making their 
home more energy-efficient.
Changing housekeeping habits also helps reduce carbon impact at home. 
Petro-whittling moves such as the following can help melt off the pounds:
 
 Trade in for a newer model. When it comes to cleaning machines, 
new is better. The difference in energy efficiency between a 20-year-
old washer and a just-off-the-assembly line model is huge. Look for the 
Energy Star designation on major appliances, including washers and 
refrigerators. (Visit www.energystar.gov for a full load of informa-
tion about ways to reduce energy consumption.) Although not Energy 
Star-rated, the newer models of clothes dryers, vacuum cleaners, and air 
cleaners rate dramatically better on the energy-efficiency scale.
 
 Degrease your cleaning formulas whenever possible. For example, 
virtually all detergents — even many of the green, vegetable- or plant-
based brands — contain varying levels of petro-chemicals. Purists prefer 
the homemade formulas Grandma would approve of. (See Chapter 3 of 
this book for recipes.)
 
 Unplug it. Instead of behaving — as your dad would say — like you 
have stock in the electric company, invest in sweat equity. Hang your 
delicates to drip-dry and give the dryer a rest. Give your wrist a workout 
and open your tuna with a manual can opener.

Warning: Disinfecting May Be 
Hazardous to the Planet
Pollution from toxic substances is another negative byproduct of reliance 
on fossil fuels. Environmental calamities from ozone damage and smog to 
contaminated water supplies have their roots in the burning of nonrenew-
ables, such as petroleum and coal. And all can result in the following serious 
damage to the natural world:
 
 Smog alert: Utility plants, coal-burning facilities, and oil refineries are 
among the biggest generators of acid rain, ozone compromise, particle 
pollution, and the release of chemicals that shade our skies an ominous 
gray and brown. This air pollution damages trees and eats away at 
metal, building materials, and even ancient monuments.
 
 Dead in the water: Chemical runoff from factories, homes, and farms — 
where petroleum-based pesticides and fertilizers are used — pours 
into streams and waterways with disastrous consequences, destroying 
water life and creating algaes that upset the balance of the underwater 
ecosystem.
 
 Dangerous ground: The same processes and chemicals that cause air 
and water pollution contaminate soil and threaten vegetation and the 
creatures (including humans) that depend on them.
Outing indoor pollution
Once they’ve done their dirty work, tough-acting cleaning products contrib-
ute their share to environmental havoc when they’re washed down the drain 
or dumped into the ground. They also do a number on indoor air quality.
In our battles against germs, we often wipe out the enemy only to discover 
we have a bigger threat. The conventional cleaning formulas employed in 
housekeeping contain chemicals that can activate or aggravate a spectrum of 
health problems.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), found in certain household products 
and prevalent in paints, varnishes, household furniture, and carpeting, 
escape into the air as vapor and contribute to what’s been dubbed sick-
building syndrome. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 
VOC levels can be as much as five times higher indoors than outside. Even at 
lesser levels, VOCs are known to aggravate allergies and to cause asthma and 
respiratory illnesses, and they’re linked to other health problems. Children 
and pets are most vulnerable to these conditions.

Ammonia, butyl cellusolve, phthalates, perchlorethylene, benzene: An alpha-
bet soup of ingredients in commercial cleaning formulas has been connected 
to cancer and other serious conditions.
Breathing easier with greener cleaning
Eliminating or reducing the everyday use of toxic chemicals and keeping 
them out of our water systems is a step toward a healthier home and environ-
ment. Reducing the damage from common household products requires posi-
tive changes, such as the following:
 
 To be certain cleaning formulas don’t contain chemicals that have been 
linked to health problems or pollution, choose products that list ingre-
dients on the container. Because they’re not legally required to do so, 
few manufacturers disclose their contents on the label. Search for infor-
mation by chemical or product at the Household Products Database 
(http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov).
 
 Dispose of toxic solutions responsibly by taking advantage of hazardous-
materials collection sites. Pouring chemicals down the drain means they 
end up in the water supply (we’re hearing a lot these days about the 
high level of pharmaceuticals in our drinking water) and the soil as well.
Getting into Hot Water
Water is a precious resource on Planet Earth. But if alien beings dropped in 
on a typical household in the United States, they’d never guess it. American 
earthlings wash small loads of laundry in large tubs of water; take 20-minute 
showers; leave the faucet running while brushing and flossing; fill up back-
yard swimming pools; and excessively hose down lawns to maintain that per-
fect green grass.
Sure, 70 percent of the earth’s surface is covered in water — but only a small 
percentage is drinkable. And that supply is drying up as the world’s popula-
tion grows and conditions like drought increase. The average American uses 
300 gallons of water each day — for drinking, showering, flushing, and wash-
ing — yet 1.2 billion people around the globe don’t have access to potable 
drinking water, let alone enough for their animals and crops, which then 
reduces their food supply and leads to further malnutrition.

205
 Chapter 1: Bringing “Green” to “Clean” for a Healthier Home
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
Throwing money down the drain
With on-demand access, you can easily take water availability for granted. 
Residents in certain parts of the country, however, are familiar with the con-
sequences of drought and make sacrifices to reduce water consumption by 
foregoing watering their lawns and even being cognizant of too much toilet-
flushing.
When it comes to cleaning, water is almost always part of the equation, from 
the content in cleaning formulas to the buckets of hot water for scrubbing 
the kitchen floor. Letting the water run — running the hose as you wash your 
car, keeping the faucet on as you rinse dishes, waiting for the shower water 
to heat up before you step in — hikes up the water bill as it drains valuable 
resources.
 
The bathroom is the home’s primary water villain, with the toilet demanding 
more than a quarter of the monthly water bill and using as much as 8 gallons 
per flush. The washing machine is the second-biggest guzzler.
Having water available on command comes with an energy cost. That water 
is pumped into your pipes by means of a system powered by — you guessed 
it — fossil-fueled electricity. Nearly 5 percent of all electrical energy in the 
United States goes to moving and treating water, and in some locations, it 
accounts for more than 50 percent of municipal energy consumption.
Heating up the debate
If wasting water isn’t bad enough, the temperature at which you’re wasting 
it can make things even worse. In fact, you don’t even have to turn on the 
hot water to expend electricity. Working around the clock, your water heater 
keeps a 40- or 50-gallon tankful at the ready. And when you use it up, it gener-
ates a new batch — without being asked. Appliances and fixtures that can get 
you into further hot water include
 
 Washing machines: Washing a full load of clothes in an older-model 
machine can require as much as 40 to 55 gallons of water. Doing a load 
in hot water increases energy use by as much as 90 percent, according 
to Energy Star.
 
 Dishwashers: Older machines suck up as much as 25 gallons per wash, 
and extra rinse cycles only increase that amount. The cycle uses the 
same amount of water and energy whether it’s a half or full load.

206
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 Showers: Keeping yourself clean takes energy, too. In many homes, the 
water heater is located far from the bath plumbing, so the hot water must 
travel a ways to get to the showerhead. You know what that means: You 
wait several minutes for it to warm up as water just pours down the drain.
Reducing the water pressure
Being clean and green means being conscientious about taxing the water 
supply — looking for ways to clean with less water. To green up your house-
keeping, incorporate the following practices:
 
 Turn off the tap. You can easily treat the faucet like a fountain while 
soaping up or rinsing the dishes, washing the car, or brushing your teeth. 
But your plumbing fixtures may be the biggest culprit in water waste.
 
 Stop the drain on water resources at all source points. Update your 
plumbing with low-flow showerheads, faucet aerators, and low-flush 
toilets and check regularly for leaks.
 
 Purchase a Star. Replacing your old clothes washer with an Energy Star 
model reduces water usage dramatically — as much as 50 percent. Other 
water-using fixtures, such as toilets, showerheads, and sink aerators, are 
also much more conservative than their free-spending ancestors.
 
 Fill it up. Do full loads of dishes. Your energy and water consumption 
are the same whether you do a full or partial load. If you need to do small 
loads of laundry, make sure that you use the lowest water-level setting.
 
 Keep it cool. Whenever possible, without sacrificing clean, use a lower 
water temperature for washing, mopping, and soaking. Also keep the 
water heater at 120°F or less.
Is Your Home Making You Sick?
The cleaning-product industry seems to view housekeeping as germ warfare: 
With liberal use of descriptives such as “kills on contact” and “decimates,” 
“destroys,” and “wipes out,” the manufacturers of commercial cleaning solu-
tions approach their work as a room-to-room battle against bacterial insur-
gency and house-born illnesses.
Most of this “defenders-of-the-clean-world” positioning is simply part of the 
advertising hype. But the fact is, your home — and buildings in general — 
can pose a threat to your well-being, and that threat isn’t just from the germs 
and dirt that conventional cleaners vow to protect you against. Within the 
four walls that make up your sanctuary from the world lurk an army of haz-
ards, hidden in dark corners, under floors and carpets, inside showers, and 
behind the walls. Your home can make you sick. Literally.

In addition to choosing the right building materials and furnishings, keeping 
your home dry, well ventilated, and clean helps protect against many house-
hold health risks. But how effective are green cleaning practices? Promoting 
themselves as “earth-gentle,” “ecofriendly,” and “safe for plants and animals,” 
they do seem to lean more toward the speak-softly strategists than the 
carry-a-big-stick camp.
By understanding the potential health threats in your home, you can easily 
see that among the strategies for combating sick-building syndrome, good 
green housekeeping practices are your No. 1 ally.
Factors in poor indoor air quality
A confluence of forces within your home can create an unhealthy environ-
ment. From that old carpet where the dog has slept for the past ten years 
to the vinyl floor in the kitchen that still gives off the new smell, your home 
exudes its own atmosphere in more ways than one — and I’m not talking 
about bad feng shui. The combination of all sorts of elements can bombard 
you on a daily basis with substances unseen but highly potent.
 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, indoor air pollution is 
one of the top five environmental risks to public health. Levels of pollutants 
inside a private home are often five times higher than they are outdoors; 
under certain circumstances, they can be as high as 1,000 times more. This 
pollution can result in a slew of respiratory problems, including asthma. Poor 
indoor air quality can cause headaches, dry eyes, nasal congestion, nausea, 
fatigue, and other symptoms. Children and people with respiratory illnesses 
are at an even greater risk.
Don’t count on being able to see signs of poor air quality. Although you may 
be able to pick up on the strong acrid smell of a new furniture stain or “feel” 
that a room is too humid, indoor air pollution is particularly insidious in that 
it’s often invisible. Primary culprits of poor indoor air quality include
 
 Poor ventilation: When the air inside a home doesn’t have enough circu-
lation, unhealthy particle matter — dust and pollen, for example — and 
gases from chemicals in furnishings and household products stay in the 
atmosphere, creating their own form of smog.
 
 Humidity: Bathrooms, basements, kitchens, and other areas where 
moisture can collect in dark, warm spots are prone to structural rot 
and the growth of mildew and mold, which may not be visible when the 
damage is spreading behind the tiles of a bathroom shower or under the 
floorboards where a pipe is leaking.
 
 Biological pollutants: In addition to mildew and molds, bacteria, dust, 
dust mite droppings, pollen, and pet hair and dander are other biologi-
cal contaminants that wreak havoc.

208
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 Radon: A gas created when uranium in the Earth decays, radon can 
enter your home through cracks and other entry points in the founda-
tion. It’s the second-leading cause of lung cancer. The good news is you 
can test for radon — and prevent it from getting into your home. For 
more information, visit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Web 
site at www.epa.gov.
 
 Chemicals in some building materials and furnishings: Treated wood 
used in home construction, carpets, flooring, and furniture can emit 
chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) — harmful sub-
stances, such as formaldehyde, that are released as gases and remain in 
the air until after the new smell has worn away. Older homes may con-
tain asbestos insulation, which, if it’s in poor or deteriorating condition, 
can release fibers dangerous to lung health.
 
 Household products: Personal-care toiletries, pesticides, paints, sol-
vents, and cleaning solutions may be sources of hundreds of potentially 
harmful VOCs and chemicals that compromise the air quality of your 
home.
The next two sections tell you what you need to know about these common 
pollutants.
Dander and dust mites 
and mold — oh, my!
Some of the worst-offending home pollutants come from biological sources: 
your beloved family dog and cat (pet hair and dander), pollen, tiny little dust 
mites that like to snuggle into your pillows and bed linens, and mold spores 
that reproduce like rabbits in the privacy of your home’s dark, damp hiding 
places.
Most of these contaminants are so small that they can’t be seen, but what 
they lack in size they make up in impact, penetrating into your airways and 
lungs and potentially producing a string of symptoms. Some effects are as 
mild as headaches, dizziness, flu or cold symptoms, and fatigue. For those 
sensitive to respiratory conditions, these contaminants can trigger allergic 
reactions and asthma attacks. The worst pollutants — such as toxic black 
mold — have been linked to serious immune deficiencies, attacks on the cen-
tral nervous system, and, in rare cases, death.
Keys to eliminating these sources of indoor air pollution are good cleaning 
practices:

209
 Chapter 1: Bringing “Green” to “Clean” for a Healthier Home
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
 Cleaning bathrooms weekly helps wipe out mildew and mold before it 
can do damage.
 
 Vacuuming floors and carpets with a HEPA (high-efficiency particular air) 
filter picks up irritants. Both bag and bagless models can be effective — 
but do be careful with bagless vacuums so that you don’t accidentally 
release dust and particles when you open the machine.
 
 Washing bedding and curtains frequently helps reduce pet hair, dust, 
dust mites, and other contaminants.
 
Good ventilation helps fend off the negative effects of pet dander, bacteria, 
dust mites, and the formation of mildew and mold. And, of course, controlling 
the humidity in wet-prone areas, such as bathrooms, basements, and kitch-
ens, helps, too.
Chasing down chemical contaminants
You’ve probably walked into someone else’s home and, by your first inhale, 
known that something in the place was new — the carpeting, the kitchen cab-
inetry and countertop, a sofa, or even paint. Although sharp, acrid, and some-
times overwhelming, the odor frequently elicits positive feelings — people 
often equate the new smell with cleanliness and abundance.
 
To many people, however, that first breath of “new smell” equates to dizzi-
ness, nausea, coughing, and difficulty in breathing. Others may not react as 
strongly, but the chemicals emitting those smells affect all people who are 
exposed to them at any length.
VOCs are in the air
That new smell whiff comes from VOCs, which are in many of the following 
materials:
Carpeting 
Vinyl flooring
Pressed wood 
Furniture
Upholstery 
Paint
Varnish 
Treated wood
Fiberglass insulation 
Solvents
Adhesives 
Nail polish remover
Air fresheners 
Gasoline
Mothballs 
Cosmetics
Insect killer 
Cleaning products

210
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
VOCs include a variety of chemicals, such as formaldehyde, benzene, and 
tuolene, found in adhesives in carpeting. The new smell lingers in the air 
for quite some time as the gases continue to slowly release. This process is 
called outgassing or off-gassing, and it’s another good reason to keep your 
home well ventilated.
Eventually, all of the VOCs dissipate — in anywhere from three months to 
five years or more. But in the meantime, they’re known to cause both short- 
and long-term adverse effects ranging from eye, nose, and throat irritation; 
headaches; and nausea. They also damage the liver, kidneys, and central ner-
vous system. Some VOCs are suspected or known to cause cancer in humans.
Pointing the finger at the top suspects
Indoor air quality can get worse when you have a mix of chemicals within 
the confines of your house — the combination of those chemicals can create 
other toxic compounds. Some of the known offenders are
 
 Ammonia: A common cleaning agent in toilet bowl cleaners and 
all-purpose sprays, ammonia is regulated by protective agencies, 
including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug 
Administration, and the Occupational Safety & Health Administration.
 
 Chlorine bleach: Found in laundry bleach, dishwasher detergent, scour-
ing powders, and tub and tile cleaners, chlorine bleach is a byproduct 
of chlorine, listed in the 1990 Clean Air Act as a hazardous air pollut-
ant. It’s on the EPA’s Community Right-to-Know list as well. In 1993, the 
American Public Health Association issued a resolution calling for the 
gradual phase-out of most chlorine-based compounds.
 
 Synthetic solvents: These chemicals appear in all-purpose cleaners, 
window sprays, floor strippers, degreasers, and oven, metal, and carpet 
cleaners under an alphabet soup of names, including ethyl cellosolve, 
ethylene glycol, ethylene dichloride, butyl cellosolve, and 2-butoxyetha-
nol. Ethylene glycol, for example, is found in everything from window 
cleaners to antifreeze and is listed in the 1990 Clean Air Act as a hazard-
ous air pollutant and in the EPA’s Community Right-to-Know list.
 
 Formaldehyde: Conventional deodorizers, disinfectants, and germicides 
can contain this compound that is common in household products such 
as adhesives, permanent press fabrics, particle board, and many others. 
The EPA has classified formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen.
 
 Optical brighteners: These synthetic chemicals in laundry detergents 
make clothes appear whiter but don’t actually make them cleaner. 
They’re toxic to fish when washed into the general environment and can 
create bacterial mutations. Optical brighteners also can cause allergic 
reaction when in contact with skin that is then exposed to sunlight.

211
 Chapter 1: Bringing “Green” to “Clean” for a Healthier Home
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
 Phosphates: Although phased out of laundry detergents and other clean-
ers in some states, phosphates are still added to some automatic dish 
detergents to soften water. When released into the household wastewa-
ter, phosphates encourage certain algae to grow, which then upsets the 
ecosystem balance, killing many forms of water life.
 
 Perchloroethylene: Perc is the chemical used in the dry-cleaning pro-
cess, but it’s also found in spot cleaners and degreasers. Classified as a 
hazardous air pollutant by the EPA and a probable human carcinogen 
by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, it’s also a primary 
groundwater contaminant.
 
Other chemicals, including phthalates and alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs), have 
raised controversy as some studies have linked them to cancer and diseases 
of the reproductive system. Phthalates, a common component of plastic and a 
petroleum derivative, are commonly contained in fragrance additives, and APEs 
are often found in detergents, fabric softeners, and products that foam.
Going beyond the ingredients list
Don’t bother pulling out your reading glasses: Even if you know which ingre-
dients to avoid, don’t expect to find them listed on most cleaning products. 
Manufacturers aren’t required by law to disclose the ingredients in cleaning 
formulas on the label. Some cleaners may advertise that they’re environmen-
tally sound but fail to provide a full list of ingredients.
 
In choosing products for their health and environmental safety, make sure 
that you can find a full list of ingredients; that’s a good sign, even if you 
haven’t a clue what those polysyllabic mouthfuls of letters means. You 
can find out more about the formulas by visiting the Household Products 
Database Web site (http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov) and looking up the 
Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).
Also, be on the lookout for certain claims that may not carry a lot of weight:
 
 All-natural or nontoxic: These terms are unregulated and can’t neces-
sarily be validated.
 
 Biodegradable: Referring to a chemical’s ability to break down into 
harmless components, this claim is only meaningful if the product indi-
cates how long it will remain in the environment.
 
 Plant-based: While agents derived from plant sources are better than 
petroleum-derived agents, be aware that some manufacturers may 
advertise their plant-derived ingredients — while downplaying their syn-
thetic components.
 
 Phosphate-free: Because phosphates have been phased out of virtually 
all laundry detergents, this claim is meaningless. Be aware, however, 
that many more automatic dish detergents still contain phosphates.

Solutions to the Rescue
From choosing natural building materials or those without harmful chemicals 
to building and maintaining an energy-efficient structure that allows for fresh 
air exchange, environmental practices support a healthy home.
But green cleaning techniques, despite their kinder-to-the-planet character-
istics, can be just as tough in room-to-room combat with indoor pollution 
and offer one of the best ways to get toxins out of your space. Here are a 
few cleaning practices that have a positive effect in reducing poor indoor air 
quality and other environmental risks:
 
 Eliminate the usual chemical suspects. Avoid cleaning products that 
contain the most offensive compounds, including the ones listed in the 
earlier section named “Pointing the finger at the top suspects.”
 
 Choose safer cleaning agents. Because most manufacturers don’t list 
all the ingredients in the product, this one can be a challenge. Stick with 
cleaners that disclose all the ingredients or make your own simple and 
safe formulas included in Chapter 3 of this book.
 
 Get the dirt to stick. Conventional dusting and sweeping can actually 
make air quality worse by stirring up sleeping dust and dirt into the air. 
The best solution is to replace your old shaggy-headed dust mop for one 
with a microfiber pad — dirt sticks to it like Velcro.
 
 Suck it up. Vacuuming regularly helps keep pollutants at bay — as long 
as the vacuum is actually sucking up dirt instead of spewing it out. A 
HEPA filter is a critical component of a good vacuum. Look for one that 
traps 99.97 percent of particulates 0.3 microns and larger, which include 
some chemical contaminants that bind to household dust.
 
 Clear the air. Use an energy-efficient air purifier to remove dust, pollen, 
and tobacco particulates from your home. Conventional air cleaners 
can drain a lot of energy, but to keep it under control, choose an Energy 
Star-rated model. (You can find listings on www.energystar.gov.) 
Select the smallest model that meets your needs based on area size.
Counting the Cost of Cleaning Green
In some respects, going green demands a lot more green — you know, the 
kind with dollar signs? A neighbor just got a quote on installing solar panels 
to generate his home’s energy. The estimate was almost as much as my 
first home! Tankless water heaters. Hybrid cars. Even free-range eggs and 

213

Cleaning
grass-fed beef cost more than their conventional counterparts. Organic 
towels and sheets? Before you look at the thread count, better count up the 
extra expense.
Of course, cost is relative. The organic, locally grown tomatoes are a good $1 
a pound more than the hothouse brand. But when you weigh in the fertilizers 
and pesticides used to grow the conventional tomatoes and add the embod-
ied energy from their packaging, storage, and cross-country journey to your 
grocery store, the environmental price tag offsets any cost savings.
 
Some green upgrades may require more cash out of your pocket, but clean-
ing green is not one of them. In fact, in most cases, following environmental 
cleaning practices can save you money.
Shopping for green cleaners
As you stroll down the housecleaning aisle at the grocery or big box chain, 
you’re bound to notice that, in most cases, the earth-friendly cleaning brands 
are more expensive than the conventional names your mother would be 
familiar with. A recent shopping expedition in a Midwestern discount chain 
confirmed that for toilet bowl sanitizer, all-purpose spray, laundry detergent, 
window cleaner, and dish soap, the green brands were pricier — sometimes 
by spare change and sometimes by several dollars.
Bottom line: If you intend to stock your utility closet with preformulated clean-
ing supplies from green-brand lines, be prepared to budget just a bit higher.
 
If you’re willing to take the minute or two to whip up your own recipes from 
basic household workhorses — baking soda, white distilled vinegar, and 
salt— you can watch your cleaning budget plunge deeper than a plumber’s 
snake. (For recipes, see Chapter 3 of this book.)
As of late, more commercial brands are advertising cleaning solutions with 
baking soda, vinegar, and other environmentally safe ingredients. In some 
cases, these products also contain the offending chemicals that make them 
environmentally undesirable. But they also cost as much as the other com-
mercial products. So, why buy a window cleaner with vinegar when the vin-
egar alone works at least as well — at one-tenth the price?
Considering your time investment
In addition to the cost of your cleaning solutions, your time has a value, too. 
If it didn’t, why would housecleaning franchises be popping up like dandeli-
ons? Plenty of homeowners are willing to pay as much as $100 an hour for a 
cleaning crew rather than sacrifice hours of their own time.

214
Book III: Green Cleaning 
But if you’re cleaning on your own dime, you don’t have to worry about 
adding anything more than negligible increments to your time. Count on 
a few minutes to mix together your own cleaning solutions — if you’re 
bypassing the packaged products — and a little more time if you opt for old-
fashioned, appliance-free cleaning methods, such as dust-mopping instead of 
vacuuming or hanging your wash to dry in the sun rather than loading up the 
dryer.
 
You may have to invest a little more sweat equity into your scrubbing and 
scouring efforts. Giving your oven a good cleaning may feel like the equiva-
lent of 20 minutes of upper-body exercise.
Reducing the Need to Clean
The best shortcut to maintaining a clean and orderly home is to sidestep the 
need to clean. Making changes that reduce the amount of dirt you bring into 
the home or the mess you make means cleaning less often and not having to 
work as hard.
Leaving your shoes at the door
In many parts of the world, particularly Asia, it’s customary to take off shoes 
that are worn in the outside world and leave them at the door, slipping on 
“house shoes” or shuffling about in stocking feet. Maintaining a shoe-free 
home is more than a quaint custom, however; it’s a wonderful way to keep 
the crud you pick up on the bottom of your shoes from ending up on your 
floors. It also reduces scuffmarks, scratches, and wear and tear on floor mate-
rials, from carpet to hardwood.
 
Keep a mat of assorted slippers at the door for guests to put on. This hospi-
table gesture serves as a signal to folks that they can “get comfortable” and 
make themselves at home.
Doormats serve a similar purpose. Place a rough-textured mat on the out-
side of all entrances to the home, including the garage. If caked-on mud is an 
issue, add a boot scraper, a heavy wrought-iron or stiff-brushed device to run 
the bottoms of your shoes over. Keep another doormat on the inside. Well-
used doormats mean extra cleaning, but shaking out or washing a doormat is 
a lot easier than mopping and sweeping the floors throughout your house.
 
If you have only one mat, put it by the door you use the most. So many 
people put them at their front door for appearance, but for function, you may 
need it most at the garage, kitchen, or back door. If the mat will be rained on, 
get one specially made for outside.

Cleaning
Wear it again, Sam
The “wear-it-once” school of thought is anathema to environmental advo-
cates. A pair of denims or a sweater doesn’t have to go into the wash after 
one wearing — unless you’ve been up to your knees in garden muck or 
running a marathon. Retraining kids or teenagers to hang up their clothes 
instead of letting them drop where they take them off can help extend the 
wear before they have to be washed.
You can modify other home habits to reduce the frequency of your washing:
 
 If just-worn clothing has no discernable stains or dirt, refresh it by 
hanging it outside in the sun or in a room with well-circulated air.
 
 If you’ve switched to cloth napkins to cut down on paper use (a great 
idea even though you must use water and energy to clean them), con-
sider the European tradition of reusing mildly soiled napkins through 
more than one meal. In most homes, family members tend to sit in the 
same seat, so what’s the harm if you reuse the same napkin you used 
with your bagel and juice at breakfast for your soup and sandwich at 
lunch?
 
 Putting a glass top on a piece of furniture, such as a wood cabinet 
holding a television or a table, is a decorator trick. This trick prevents 
staining from glasses or plants and makes for easier clean up. Glass can 
be custom cut to fit the particular piece of furniture, and the sides are 
rounded for appearance and to prevent injuries.
 
 A clean towel for every shower or bath isn’t necessary: Even hotels are 
catching on and offering guests the option of turning down daily linen 
changes. Do the same at home. Do, however, change towels at least once 
a week to avoid bacteria growth that thrives in warm, humid spots. And 
if allergies are a problem, be sure to change bed linens frequently to get 
rid of dust mites.
Preventive maintenance
Scheduling a yearly checkup keeps your furnace and air conditioner healthy. 
Not only does preventive maintenance ensure that everything is in work-
ing order, a smoothly operating appliance means more efficient energy use, 
lower utility bills, and cleaner air.
Keeping the air clean
One of the components of the tune-up is changing the air filter, which you 
can do yourself more frequently. Change your air conditioner filters monthly 
during the summer or warm-weather periods and replace your furnace filter in 
heating season every two or three months, more frequently if you have pets.

216
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
Choose a high-efficiency filter over a traditional fiberglass one. According to 
the American Lung Association, a high-efficiency filter can capture 30 times 
the amount of indoor air pollutants, including smoke, pet hair and dander, 
and pollen.
Keeping the air dry
Damp air breeds mildew, particularly in the ever-humid bathroom. A work-
ing exhaust fan goes a long way in expelling moisture and discouraging the 
growth of mold and mildew. But mold can spread anywhere — wood fur-
niture, books, the clothing in your closet — so ensure good air circulation 
throughout the house.
 
Ventilate by opening the windows and letting the fresh air do what it does 
best. You can’t always open windows, of course, if it’s extremely cold or 
hot, or you live in an area with frequent smog alert days. When your house 
is sealed (good for reducing energy consumption), good circulation is more 
important than ever. Despite the increased energy usage, running the fan or 
the air conditioner or furnace may be an unavoidable tactic.
Filters, filters everywhere
The furnace and air conditioner aren’t the only appliances putting in over-
time to filter out dust, pollen, dander, or other elements dirty and undesir-
able. Plenty of other filtering devices are at work, too. Regularly clean out or 
replace filters and dirt traps for
 
 Vacuum cleaners
 
 Air-filtering machines
 
 Water filters (whole-house water filters or refrigerator water-in-the-door 
filters or faucet filters)
 
 Dryer lint traps
 
 Hood exhaust fans above the cooktop or stove (these filters can go in 
the dishwasher)
Tidy up as you go
You may remember yelling at your kids, “Why can’t you just put it away when 
you’re done with it?” Or “Is it so difficult to take two more steps to the closet 
instead of throwing your pants on the bed?” Or maybe that was your mom 
yelling at you.

Cleaning
She’s right, and you know it. When you replace the book on the shelf when 
you’re done with it, if you place your coffee cup in the sink after you’ve taken 
the last sip, when you put the clean clothes back in the drawers as soon as 
you fold them — just finishing up the job that you’ve started goes a long way 
in minimizing on your cleaning effort.
 
When you’re in a hurry getting out the door in the morning, being tidy may 
be impossible and simply another stressor. If that’s the case, resolve to do a 
quick pickup when you get home or, as many families do, reserve Saturday 
mornings for a general housecleaning. Tidying as you go is ideal, but slippage 
(just as in a diet) is normal. Be kind to yourself.
A Lean-and-Mean Plan for 
Getting the House Clean
When faced with a houseful of rooms demanding to be cleaned, you can 
become so overwhelmed you don’t know where to begin. Maybe you start 
by picking up the dirty clothes on the bathroom floor and take them to the 
laundry room, where you stop to fold socks that take you next to your bed-
room to put them away. The dirty mirror distracts you, and you head into 
the kitchen for the window cleaner, and stop to finish up the breakfast dishes 
and then. . . .
When you hop from room to room, putting a single pair of socks away or 
wiping down one piece of furniture at a time, you may be multitasking or 
merely running around in circles.
What you need is a plan. A method. A strategy. There are plenty of great 
ones: Cleaning strategies are certainly not a one-size-fits-all. Trial and error 
will tell what works for you. But all good plans have certain components.
A practical sequence
If you were making a shirt, you wouldn’t sew the buttons on before you cut 
out the material from the pattern. Likewise, cleaning necessitates a logical 
order. You wouldn’t, for example, mop the floor before you sweep it. Each 
home is different, but the order follows some universal principles:

218
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 Clean from the top down. Dust the ceiling corners and lighting fix-
tures, then the tops of picture frames, clean the windows, and finally 
the window frames and sills. Wipe up any smudges on the walls or light 
switch plates, dust the furniture, and sweep or mop the floor.
 
 If you start from the floor and work up, by the time you get to waist-level 
cleaning, you’re sweeping toast crumbs off the counter onto your clean 
floor.
 
 Work your way through the house. When doing a whole-house clean, 
move from room to room in a sequential order. Say that you have a 
two-story home: Start on the second floor in the room farthest from the 
stairs and work toward them, cleaning the hallway floor as you make 
your final trip toward the steps.
 
 Then start on the first floor, working from the room farthest from the 
kitchen or laundry room — whichever place you must return to for more 
water or cleaning supplies as needed.
 
 Prioritize “public” areas. If you have frequent visitors, start with the 
rooms and areas your guests are most likely to see: the main floor entry 
area, powder room, living room, and kitchen.
 
 Go around in circles. A good strategy for cleaning a single room is to 
work in a circle. Start to the left or the right of the door or entrance and 
make a clockwise or counterclockwise circle around the room.
 
 What about the center? Most rooms are small enough that your efforts 
can be somewhat pie-shaped, stepping from the perimeter to catch 
any furniture placed closer to the center of the room. By following this 
methodical path, you’re less likely to have overlooked a corner or a 
piece of furniture.
 
 Group by task. Here’s another plan of attack: Instead of moving through 
the house room by room, approach your cleaning one task at a time. 
For example, begin with your dust rag and wood cleaner and dust every-
thing in several rooms. Put that down and pick up the window cleaner 
and do the mirrors and so on.
 
 Bundling your chores can be a very efficient approach: After you finish 
all the vacuuming, for example, you can put away the vacuum instead of 
leaving it out until you’re ready to use it in the next room.
A surefire spring cleaning strategy
Ah, spring! In cultures ancient and traditional, spring holidays have cel-
ebrated the renewal of life through food, festivity — and cleaning rituals. 
Doors and windows are opened, the sun is welcomed in, and homes are given 
a good airing.

219
 Chapter 1: Bringing “Green” to “Clean” for a Healthier Home

Green 
Cleaning
According to a survey conducted by the Soap and Detergent Association, 77 
percent of Americans participate in spring cleaning each year. Out with old, 
in with the new!
And the new may include a fresh approach to cleaning. As motivated as you 
may be to tackle your spring housework, the prospect of overhauling your 
home from top to bottom is a bit intimidating — overwhelming, even. Try the 
following to bring it down to a manageable level:
 
 Spread it out. Don’t try to power through your entire homestead, from 
window washing to attic-purging, in one weekend. To do a thorough 
job of spring cleaning without losing momentum, divide the chores and 
spread out the work over a month or even more.
 
 Practice patience. Take on the tasks as they make sense. Wait on wash-
ing the windows for a cloudy day (fewer streaks than on a sunny day) or 
cleaning out the fireplace if more winter storm activity is likely. Repaint 
the living room first and then replace the old carpet with a new bamboo 
floor.
 
 Don’t go it alone. If your housemates and family members aren’t reli-
able members of the housekeeping team, then sign on a free agent: Enlist 
the help of a cleaning service, especially for the most demanding jobs. 
Better the licensed experts climb on the ladder to dust your chandelier 
and clean the skylight, and you polish your heirloom silver.
Seeking Professional Help
The most effective way to reduce your cleaning efforts? Let someone else 
do the work. There’s no shortage of housecleaning services in the phone 
book or notices on your mailbox. But until recently, most of them, whether 
national franchises or local businesses, were anything but green. Driven pri-
marily by a clientele who wanted clean at any cost, such enterprises typically 
chose cleaning products that clean fast and powerfully. No surprise, most 
services used powerful products with bleach, ammonia, and other fossil fuel-
based or eye-watering powerful chemicals.
That’s changing, and changing fast. Housecleaning companies that offer 
green services are popping up from coast to coast. But before you pay a pre-
mium for green service, do a little digging to find out exactly how that com-
pany differentiates itself.
 
 If the service claims to use “green” cleaning formulas, find out what they 
are. If their brand’s labeled “nontoxic,” “natural,” or “biodegradable,” 
be wary as these labels may not mean much. Remember, manufacturers 
don’t have to list ingredients on the label.

220
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 Find out whether the company is committed to sustainable business 
practices. In addition to its choice of cleaning products, does the busi-
ness attempt to reduce its environmental footprint by considering trans-
portation issues and building operations? Does it offset for the carbon 
emissions it generates?
 
 Ask what else the business does to define itself as green. Are the 
employees cognizant of water usage, conserving where possible and 
using cooler water when it makes sense? Do they clean without elec-
tronic appliances? Do they clean with reusable tools — cloth rags 
instead of paper towels?
 
If the greenness of the cleaning products is your primary issue, consider 
sticking with a conventional service and ask that they switch to your clean-
ing products. Most are happy to use whatever products you specify, whether 
your homemade recipes or green-brand formulas.

Green Cleaning Tools

 Clearing the air about room fresheners and fragrances
P
eek into a green cleaning closet, and you won’t see a dramatic difference 
from a conventional collection of cleaning tools and equipment: dust rags, 
brooms, mops, sponges, and a vacuum cleaner. The sustainable sensibility 
may be reflected in the type of dust cloths, or the amount of mops and brooms, 
or the content of the trash bags.
In this chapter, you explore these sometimes-subtle differences as you get a 
rundown of just what tools and hardware belong in the green utility closet, 
from stuff as basic as old towels for cleaning rags to the latest gadgets that 
make quick work of cleaning.
Greening Your Cleaning Closet
 
The general rule when assembling the greenest cleaning equipment is the 
environmentalist’s first commandment: Thou shall reduce, reuse, and recy-
cle. Just as you question whether you require a multitude of cleaners for 
countertops, bathroom tile, and floors, you may not need that assortment 
of brushes or three different kinds of vacuum cleaners. Secondly, work with 
what you have. Instead of tossing and replacing, repair and reuse. And, lastly, 
when your old equipment is finally ready to go to the utility closet in the sky, 
recycle everything that you can.

222
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
Remember that buying isn’t a green activity. But for those tools you must 
acquire, seek products made of ecofriendly materials or of recycled content. 
Look for items with minimal packaging — more and more, such wrappings 
may be identified as recyclable, biodegradable, or compostable.
Tackling dirty jobs: Cleaning cloths
Cleaning cloths are the workhorses of your house-cleaning kit. If you have 
nothing else in your utility closet but towels and rags, you have all you need 
to attack most cleaning jobs. (See Chapter 3 of this book for cleaning-agent 
recipes that pair up well with your cleaning cloths.)
These multipurpose fundamentals can tackle just about any household job, 
including
 
 Dusting, wet or dry
 
 Wiping down appliances and furnishings
 
 Mopping floors
 
 Cleaning tile and kitchen and bathroom surfaces
 
 Shining chrome
 
 Sopping up spills
 
 Polishing silver
 
 Cleaning glass and mirrors
 
Hanging up a damp cleaning towel to reuse risks growing and spreading bac-
teria. Solve this issue by switching out the towel and washing it often in hot 
water.
Working with the right material
Options for cleaning cloths are endless: On the market are packages of cloth-
like throwaway towels, heavy-duty, purpose-made cleaning cloths; products 
with antimicrobial properties; microfiber wipes, and paper towels. And you 
can always repurpose old, worn T-shirts, towels, and sheets.
The best cleaning choice is the cloth that picks up the most dirt without 
streaking, spreading, smearing, or leaving behind muddy trails. Certain fab-
rics do a better job than others:
 
 Wool: Ideal for dusting, wool contains lanolin and has static electricity 
properties, attracting dust and keeping hold of it more so than other 
fabrics.

223
 Chapter 2: Building an Arsenal of Green Cleaning Tools
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
 Cotton: The soft, absorbent nature of pure cotton makes it a great 
choice for almost any cleaning job.
 
 Microfiber: Its fine filaments pick up dust, dirt, and oil and boast a high 
absorbency factor, able to hold up to seven times its weight in water.
Repurposing old clothes: The greenest option
Used fabrics make outstanding cleaning aids. They’ve been washed to a 
smooth softness, with less lint and loose fibers. Cut up an old wool blanket 
or reuse hole-ridden wool socks (just slip them on your hands) for dusting; 
convert old cotton towels, baby diapers, and soft cotton T-shirts and night-
wear into scrub rags. Remove any buttons or zippers because they scratch 
surfaces.
This standout choice for cleaning rags meets the highest green standards: It 
requires no additional output of energy (other than your effort to cut it into 
rag-size pieces); you don’t have to buy it; it requires no wasteful packaging; 
it’s not damaging the environment; and you’re exercising the principle of 
reuse. And if you’re using old towels or T-shirts made of organic cotton, chalk 
up even more green points.
Buying new cleaning cloths
One benefit of buying new cleaning cloths rather than repurposing: You can 
choose colors to separate cloths for different uses — red for dusting and 
blue for wet-wiping, say. The ability to color-coordinate makes keeping cloths 
separate a lot easier.
 
Look for 100-percent organic cotton towels. Organic towels often cost more 
than conventional towels because the natural materials used are grown 
without the use of most pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, or genetic engineer-
ing. Most organic towels are 100-percent cotton or a blend with cotton and 
another natural fiber, such as linen or hemp. To verify that the product is 
organic, look for the USDA certified organic symbol. Another green choice is 
bamboo. Yes, that sturdy woody rapidly renewable grass can be transformed 
into the softest fabric. Its antibacterial qualities make it a perfect choice for 
dishtowels.
Getting attached to microfiber
Microfiber cleaning cloths are available from a number of brands. Though 
derived from petroleum, polyester-polyamide-based microfiber materials are 
worth their weight in water — they’re super-absorbent and scoop up dirt like 
iron shavings to a magnet. You can reuse most of them, and some are special-
ized to tackle
 
 Granite, picking up dirt and dulling residue, and leaving a shine
 
 Wood, attracting and trapping dust

224
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 Windows/glass, cleaning and adding gleam
 
 Stainless steel, removing smudges, fingerprints, and streaks
 
 Floors, picking up dust, dirt, and debris with mop pads or sweep dusters
Shredding the use of paper towels
Anything that ends up in the trash after a single use doesn’t rate very high on 
the green-o-meter. And paper towels are the ultimate in discard-ability.
Rolled up inside every package of paper towel is a dirty back-story: The paper 
industry is one of the world’s worst polluters, keeping company with chemical
 and steel manufacturing. And very little paper towel is recycled, of course. 
Instead, it contributes to the 40 percent of landfill content from paper.
Because wood pulp is the basis for paper, its production has an impact on 
deforestation, which adds to global warming. And the manufacturing of 
paper towel, in addition to bearing a heavy environmental footprint, involves 
bleaching with chlorine-based chemicals, which can lead to the release of 
toxic emissions, causing further damage.
 
Cleaning cloths can pinch-hit for virtually any job that paper towels can 
handle. They’re washable, and you can use them again and again. Save your 
most tattered and faded dishtowels and other soft cloths to use for the dirti-
est jobs, giving them one last shot at service before discarding them.
If you decide that your home can’t function without paper towels, you’re in 
good company. Some steps do help lessen the environmental impact:
 
 Seek products with the highest percentage of post-consumer waste 
(PCW). This figure indicates the amount of material that came from 
paper used and recycled by consumers — mail-order catalogs and 
magazines you’re finished with or the used copy paper from your office, 
for example. Most recycled-content products include some recycled 
content from manufacturing waste, referred to as preconsumer waste. 
For example, Seventh Generation paper towels use 80-percent PCW and 
20-percent preconsumer.
 
 Choose unbleached paper towels. They’re identified by the label PCF 
(processed chlorine free) to ensure that no chlorine derivatives were 
used in the processing of the paper.
 
 Select products free of dyes and fragrances. Why add chemicals (and 
potential irritants) when you’re working to go green?
 
 Buy the largest quantity with the least amount of packaging. Double 
rolls make more sense than single rolls.

An absorbing issue: Sponges
An ideal ally for soaking up wet messes, sponges suck up water so that you 
can transfer it into the sink with a good squeeze. Once upon a time, the 
sponges used for cleaning were from the amorphous, faceless sea creatures 
that float under the ocean’s surface like deflating beach toys. Today, the arti-
cles you buy in hardware and home stores are rarely made from real sponge, 
but rather from some sort of polymer with petroleum origins. The microfiber 
sponges, a relatively new novelty, are likewise synthetic-based.
 
Reduce the elbow grease and cleaning solution required by choosing sponges 
with a “scrubbing” side and sponge mops with an abrasive strip — great for 
scraping away stubborn dried-on food.
The dark side of sponges
Whether plastic- or plant-based, all sponges pose a similar risk: They’re germ 
carriers. Talk about a natural breeding ground: All those little holes and dark 
crevices are the perfect spot for germs to hide and thrive. When you use a 
dirty sponge to clean a surface, chances are you’re leaving behind a trail of 
bacteria even as you’re picking up the mess.
 
Some companies have countered the sponge’s dirty reputation by soaking 
their products with antibacterial agents, typically the ingredient triclosan. 
Avoid this ingredient! Triclosan has not been proven to be any more effective 
than soap and warm water in killing germs. It’s also suspected of contributing 
to the spread of drug-resistant bacteria. Finally, when in contact with chlo-
rine, triclosan can become chloroform, a probable human carcinogen.
Practicing sponge safety
Don’t write off sponges completely. These guys are redeemable and worth 
the effort because of their super-hero absorption powers. They just require a 
little more attention. Follow these practices for safe sponging:
 
 Buy cellulose sponges or long-lasting microfiber products for the green-
est options. (The packaging usually identifies the contents as such.)
 
 After each use, wash the sponge in hot soapy water or spray with a solu-
tion of white distilled vinegar.
 
 Set the sponge on a kitchen windowsill so that sunlight and its magical 
disinfecting properties can dry it.
 
 Wash the sponge often in the washing machine. Warmer water is preferred.
 
 Use common sense: Keep the bathroom sponges only for bathrooms, 
the kitchen sponges only in the kitchen, and then specify their use for 
wiping crumbs off the table or range top or rinsing out the sink.

226
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
Clean sponges in the dishwasher or boil them in water for three minutes. 
Another solution is to microwave them for one to three minutes, making sure 
that they’re wet before you “nuke” them. Using hot water to get at the holes 
and crevices is important for thorough cleaning. Even following these prac-
tices, you want to replace sponges frequently. When the dirt discoloration 
appears permanent and the sponge starts to disintegrate, it’s time to toss.
Brushing up on other cleaning tools
No other product in the cleaning closet offers such diversity as brooms and 
brushes. You can find brushes expressly for cleaning baseboards, cobweb 
brushes, ceiling fan brushes, carpet rakes, dryer vent and lint trap brushes, 
grout brushes, and even garbage disposal brush.
Sweeping changes
No green home is complete without the traditional good-luck gift, a broom, 
for new homeowners. Although more cleanup jobs are handed over to the 
vacuum cleaner these days, the broom still earns its keep for sweeping up. A 
broom comes in handy when the power is out, or when you simply find the 
meditative motion of sweeping relaxing.
The no-plug broom is by its very nature a green cleaning tool. That brooms 
are traditionally made of natural and abundant material such as straw — 
from sorghum and often referred to as broomcorn — and wooden handles 
adds to their sustainable allure.
Many brooms found in hardware and big box stores are plastic-based, with 
nylon brush and plastic or metal handles, but plenty of the traditional models 
are available. In fact, Home Depot has committed to using wood certified 
by the Forest Stewardship Council (meaning that the wood was sustainably 
harvested from a properly managed forest) down to and including broom 
handles.
 
Don’t use a broom to sweep a hardwood floor. The brush, whether natural-
material or nylon, can scratch the surface. You’re better off using the vacuum 
or dust mop to round up dust bunnies.
Nylon brooms or other lightweight smoother finished brooms are best for 
inside use, such as tile floors. Straw brooms, however, work fine indoors, 
too. And the rougher texture of the brush is especially effective on uneven 
surfaces, such as outdoor brick patios. The unevenness of the straw gets
into the cracks and crevices between the bricks. Shake brooms outside to 
clean them.

Close brushes with green cleaning
When you remove the harsh chemical agents from your cleaning arsenal, 
you’re compelled to use a little more elbow grease to get some surfaces and 
furnishings as clean as the chemicals do. The tough scrubbing power of 
brushes can up your cleaning power, using agents as mild as plain water.
A good stiff scrub brush can tackle scuffed kitchen floors, mildewed tile 
grout, grease-coated ovens, and brick or stone floors and surfaces. You can 
also use it for sweeping (a push-broom is, in essence, a scrub brush with a 
handle). You can use soft-bristled brushes for picking up dust and cleaning 
delicate objects and surfaces.
Every green home should have the following brushes in the utility closet or 
appropriate spot in the house:
 
 Stiff-bristled scrub brush for scouring and scrubbing tough surfaces and 
tougher dirt — both indoor and outdoor scrub brushes
 
 Soft-bristled brush for cleaning fragile furnishings and for dusting and 
polishing
 
 Toilet brush
 
 Vegetable brush, for cleaning food
 
 Bottlebrush for thoroughly cleaning long, narrow-necked containers 
from baby bottles to flower vases and reaching into garbage disposals, 
drains, and even dryer vents
 
Before buying a custom-use brush for small jobs, tap your medicine chest 
and bathroom toiletry cabinet first. Toothbrushes are great for getting into 
the tiny crevices of blenders or taking lint off hair-dryer vents. Old makeup 
brushes are soft and gentle for dusting the curves and hard-to-reach spots on 
antique furniture.
Not your mother’s mop
Unless you’re partial to housemaid’s knee, floor mops and dusters are a 
must-have. Most floor mops have a sponge on the end that has a scraper 
edge to get up crusted-on food or dirt. They pair nicely with a bucket of 
soapy water. Dust mops, on the other hand, are based on a fringy head or 
microfiber cloth to pick up dry dust and loose particles.
Mops both wet and dry have evolved, overcoming some objections to their 
performance. One of the biggest trends in floor cleaning is the “mop system.” 
An all-in-one kit includes the mop handle, mop head, and removable cloths 
that attach to the mop head. Some systems also feature an “onboard” refill-
able cleaning solution dispenser — as you mop, you can press a button to 
squirt out cleaning liquid from the mop head.

228
Book III: Green Cleaning 
Until recently, most mop systems used disposable mop cloths: You’d use 
them a couple times and then toss them. But as consumers and companies 
become more attuned to sustainability issues, these throwaways are increas-
ingly replaced by reusable cloths, most often made of microfiber material.
Microfiber means harder-working and longer-lasting cloths for both wet and 
dry mopping. These qualities earn microfiber, while a synthetic material, 
plenty of green points. Additionally, some makers manufacture their microfi-
ber from post-consumer content, and some cloths are recyclable or 
biodegradable.
Trashing plastic bags
As more communities, including countries from Ireland to China, impose 
bans, fines, and restrictions on the plastic grocery bag, its bigger relative, the 
trash bag, continues to raise environmental debate.
Used for purposes from collecting leaves to gathering kitchen garbage, these 
larger trash bags have the same drawbacks as the smaller offenders: They’re 
made from petroleum-based synthetics, so both extraction and manufacture 
contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.
In addition, trash bags are used almost exclusively for disposal, which means 
that they’re adding to the growing landfill and possibly preventing com-
postable and biodegradable materials from decomposing.
For a number of reasons, trash bags are near essential to even the greenest 
consumer. Some community trash pickups require that materials be bagged 
rather than set out loose in trash containers to discourage animals. And few 
people have been able to reduce their household footprint to the point that 
they’re no longer generating trash. Thus, the trash bag conundrum.
One way to cut down on your use of plastic trash bags is to ratchet up your 
recycling efforts to reduce your waste output. (See Chapter 3 of this book 
for ideas on setting up an efficient recycling collection center.) In addition, 
follow these steps and watch your use of trash bags shrink.
 
 Compost kitchen scraps. You can turn fruit and vegetable trimmings, 
coffee grounds, tea leaves, eggshells, and some other materials into rich 
garden soil in your backyard. (See Chapter 2 of Book VI for more about 
composting.)
 
 Limit the use of trash liners to only those receptacles that collect wet 
or drippy garbage. For smaller cans, such as those in the bedroom or 
living areas, eliminate the trash bag. Many waste cans now come with a 
removable, washable plastic liner (ah, more plastic!) so that you don’t 
have to continue to use small liner bags.

 Use bags you already have, such as brown paper bags from grocery 
stores, tired-looking gift bags, and department store bags for trash. 
This option is green because you’re recycling, but it’s a less green 
option because you shouldn’t have these items in the first place if 
you’ve converted to taking your own cloth bags to the store.
 
 Designate the lined trash bin as the homes “central” receptacle and 
empty the smaller bins into this one. That way, you can limit your 
weekly bag use to one.
 
 Look for biodegradable trash bags. These bags are made from corn or 
other renewable sources, and many advertise that they can biodegrade 
in a compost bin in just days. Even if you set them out for your weekly 
trash pickup, at least they’re breaking down in the landfill.
Plugging in Green Gadgets
The best energy source for green cleaning is, of course, your own muscle 
power. But some technological tools are too valuable and effective to do 
without. Especially where indoor air quality is concerned, nothing picks up 
dirt and filters irritants as well as a well-made vacuum cleaner.
A clean sweep of vacuum cleaners
A regular sweep through the home with your vacuum cleaner does wonders 
for reducing problems related to poor indoor air quality, particularly with 
issues of dust mites, dander, and other irritants. Specialized vacuums suck 
up pet hair.
The new kid on the block is the Halo vacuum. It has a built-in ultraviolet light 
bulb that disrupts the DNA of viruses, bacteria, flea eggs, and dust mites. 
When vacuuming, you activate the light. The Halo vacuum is suggested for 
cleaning carpets and mattresses. Similar technology is being used in heating 
and air-conditioning ducts. Anywhere it is dark and dusty, the idea is to shine 
light on the potential problem. (Stay tuned on this one because the scientific 
tests and reviews are still underway.)
 
The micron is the measure of the microscopic particulates that find their way 
into air passages. The best machine is one that includes a high efficiency 
particulate air (HEPA) filter, which can pick up 99.97 percent of particulates 
as small as 0.3 microns, the size of cat dander, and on up, including such irri-
tants as dust mite droppings (10 to 20 microns), and pollen, weighing in at a 
whopping 15 to 25 microns. They can also catch chemical pollutants such as 
flame-retardants, phthalates, and pesticides.

230
Book III: Green Cleaning 
The vacuum cleaner is an investment in your home’s air quality, but it won’t 
help much if it isn’t routinely put into service and maintained. Be sure to take 
these steps to properly use and care for your appliance:
 
 Vacuum often — once a week or more frequently if someone in your 
home has allergies, or you have pets.
 
 Vacuum more in areas with high foot traffic, such as the area in front of 
your couch.
 
 Change bags or canisters before they’re full to avoid spilling dirt when 
you empty and change.
 
 Replace the filters and maintain according to manufacturer’s guidelines.
 
 Assist your vacuum cleaner with its chore by dusting furniture regularly 
(less to fall on the floor) and taking off shoes before tracking dirt onto 
floors and carpets.
 
 When carrying, grip the vacuum by the handle, not the hose.
 
 Remove hair entangling the brushes.
 
 If you’re using a bagless vacuum, empty the canister outside to help alle-
viate any allergen concerns and wipe the vacuum cleaner with a slightly 
damp cloth.
 
Investing in the best vacuum cleaner you need and can afford makes environ-
mental sense. The embodied energy that went into manufacturing it certainly 
warrants its good care and long life. A model with a lifetime warranty is some-
thing to look for. Also, buy from a company that you can purchase parts or 
repairs from rather than simply replace the vacuum down the road.
Heating things up: Steam cleaners
A clean and chemical-free way of cleaning, steam cleaners are especially good 
for zapping dirt embedded in carpet, rugs, and fabrics, such as draperies, 
upholstery, mattresses, and bedding.
In particular, steam cleaners are known to wipe out dust mites and clean up 
the microscopic messes that irritate allergy sufferers. By targeting dirt with 
steam heat at 240°F, steam cleaners exceed anything that the clothes washer 
may aspire to.
Use steam cleaners for wiping up all traces of pet stain, mildew, and mold. 
They clean most surfaces and get into grout like nothing else can. Read and 
follow instructions carefully before using.

231
 Chapter 2: Building an Arsenal of Green Cleaning Tools
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
Remember that steam cleaners are not vacuum cleaners: Dust or pick up 
loose dirt before steaming and vacuum before using the steam cleaners.
 
The steam generated can cause bad burns. Some reports suggest that some 
of the smaller hand-helds may be more prone to causing burns because 
of malfunctions. Be sure to research models carefully and read consumer 
reviews before purchasing.
Sniffing Out Room Fresheners
Not only do most people measure clean by the looks of a place, but they also 
judge it by its smell, but nice smells don’t equal clean. In fact, they can spell 
indoor air quality issues. Many of the aerosol spray room fresheners propel 
the chemicals used to create the scent, dispersing them in such small par-
ticles that they can easily make their way into your air passages and lungs. 
Some of the sprays are merely overbearingly strong.
Even candles are guilty when it comes to indoor air quality. The smoke they 
produce creates particulates that can enter air passages and cause irritation 
and distress to those with respiratory problems. And the wire that supports 
the wick? Some foreign manufacturers use lead. When burned, the substance 
enters your airways and is no better for you in this form than if you ate lead 
paint.
To add insult to injury, candles are most commonly made of petroleum-based 
paraffin, known to burn “dirty” compared to natural candles made of bees-
wax, palm oil, or soy.
Cleaning the air in your home is better accomplished by the following meth-
ods rather than covering up bad odors with yet more fragrances, whether 
sprayed, burned, or plugged in:
 
 Open the windows and let in the fresh air.
 
 Open curtains or blinds to get some sun exposure, which does its part 
to freshen.
 
 Get rid of odors by removing the source or cleaning.
 
 Set an open box of baking soda in the room to absorb odors.
 
 A mixture of ½ cup baking soda and ½ cup cornstarch with 3 drops of 
essential oil (optional for scent) sprinkled in athletic shoes will absorb 
odors and moisture.

232
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 Limit candle burning to those made of beeswax, soy, or palm-oil, making 
sure that they contain all-cotton (no-lead) wicks. Avoid burning in a 
drafty area to prevent fires.
 
 Create your own natural scents with favorites such as lavender buds, 
citrus oils, and mint oils. (See Chapter 3 of this book for recipes for air 
fresheners.)
 
Don’t assume that you won’t have a reaction to natural scents made from 
essential oils. These oils are quite strong and may irritate the skin. Don’t put 
these oils directly on your skin. Use in small amounts until you determine 
whether you or anyone else has a reaction to them.

G
rocery stores, warehouses, and home-supply stores contain aisle after 
aisle of commercially formulated products, promising to clean, dust, 
disinfect, degrease, polish, shine, scour, scrub, swab, mop, and eliminate 
every last bit of dirt in your home. Who would have imagined that cleaning 
is such a complex task that it requires dozens of different formulas for each 
room and surface?
Fact is, these shelves of solutions contain pretty much the same ingredients. 
And many of them aren’t so good for you — or the planet. These ingredients 
are commonly derived from petroleum, a fossil fuel responsible for green-
house gas emissions, and many of the chemicals contained in these powerful 
cleaners are linked to a host of illnesses. And to make matters more confus-
ing, manufacturers aren’t required to list the ingredients on their labels. Even 
products that claim to be “natural” or “gentle” may still contain chemicals 
that can cause harm.
When you make your own cleaning formulas, you know exactly what’s in 
them. Consider this chapter your green-clean cookbook.

234
Book III: Green Cleaning 
Beginning with the Basics: 
Elbow Grease and Water
The greenest ingredient is your own muscle power. Add a little water, and 
you have a highly effective recipe for eliminating dirt. Water is often the best 
first response — with a little scrubbing, the stain or spill is gone.
 
Water also happens to be the predominant ingredient in most of the recipes 
in this chapter. Unless otherwise directed, use warm water — in most cases, 
hot is not necessary to do the job.
Using water in the form of steam is another great way to zap dirt and sanitize 
floors without chemicals. Steam mops with reusable microfiber pads require 
no more than ordinary tap water to clean slate, marble, tile, and sealed wood 
surfaces. Hand-held steamers are perfect for cleaning kitchen counters and 
combating mold and mildew in bath areas. And using plain steam means no 
cleaner residue or buildup. (For more information about steamers and other 
cleaning tools, read Chapter 2 of this book.)
 
Remember that all chemicals, including water and common table salt, are 
toxic at some level of exposure. Additionally, some home-grown cleaning 
remedies are definitely not safe. Using mayonnaise or yogurt to clean furni-
ture, for example, can lead to bacteria growth.
Here are a few precautions to take when making, using, and storing home-
made mixtures:
 
 Keep all cleaning solutions out of reach of children — on a top shelf or 
in a locked cabinet.
 
 Don’t store cleaning formulas in reused food or beverage containers.
 
 In recipes using perishable ingredients, such as lemon juice, make only 
enough for immediate use. Don’t store.
 
 Use steamers or hot water with caution. Take care when carrying full 
buckets of hot water.
 
 Don’t leave water buckets unattended, especially in homes with young 
children or small pets.

 Chapter 3: Mixing Up Your Own Green Cleaning Solutions
Book III

Cleaning
Gathering Your Ingredients
Pull together all the ingredients you need to mix up your green cleaning agents. 
Chances are, you’ve got a good number of them in your pantry, maybe a couple 
in the fridge, and one or two under the bathroom sink or in the laundry room. 
You probably will have to purchase very little to whip up your own formulas. 
And if you do, you can find most of the ingredients in your grocery store.
Neutralizing with acids or alkalines
Many of the ingredients in do-it-yourself cleaners are either acid or alkaline, 
and each functions as a cleaning agent in a unique way.
 
No need to panic: Understanding the power of acids and alkalines doesn’t 
require an advanced degree in chemistry. The pH scale is used to measure 
the nature of certain elements, with 7 being neutral. Certain household 
cleaning ingredients rate as
 
 Acid, which measure at 6 or less on the pH scale
 
 Alkaline, agents that come in at 8 or higher on the scale
The cleaners in these categories work as a function of the pH level. Here’s 
how: Say that you spill some tomato sauce on your tablecloth. Tomatoes 
are acidic in nature, so the best cleaner is one that neutralizes the acid: an 
alkaline agent such as salt or baking soda. On the other hand, if the table-
cloth has been washed in an alkaline-based detergent, it may have some soap 
buildup that a more acidic solution, such as a vinegar rinse can remove.
Acids include
 
 Lemon juice: This citric acid bleaches, disinfects, deodorizes, and cuts 
grease. Use the real thing — or bottled concentrate.
 
 Hydrogen peroxide: An oxygen bleach that doesn’t have the harmful 
properties as chlorine bleach, this mild acid is used as an antiseptic for 
minor wounds and kills germs when it’s used as a cleaning agent, too.
 
 White distilled vinegar: Count on this wonder cleaner for deodorizing, 
cutting through grease, removing stains, and freshening.

236
Book III: Green Cleaning 
Alkaline ingredients are equally common and include
 
 Baking soda: Sodium bicarbonate not only neutralizes the acid in your 
stomach, it cleans up after acidic stains and messes, works as a mild 
abrasive, shines up aluminum, chrome, silver, and other metals, and 
unclogs and cleans drains. It cuts grease and dirt and deodorizes.
 
 Washing soda: Also known as sodium carbonate, this stronger iteration 
of sodium bi-carbonate (baking soda) looks similar and is sometimes 
available in the laundry section of the supermarket or hardware store.
 
 Borax: Another member of the sodium family (sodium borate), this 
natural mineral is a disinfectant, and sold at drugstores, supermarkets, 
hardware and supply stores.
 
 Cornstarch: Just as its name implies, this mild and absorbent cleaner is 
a starch derived from corn.
 
 Cornmeal: Set aside some the next time you’re making corn muffins: 
This mildly abrasive substance makes easy work of grease stains.
 
 Club soda: Have a big bottle of bubbly on hand for cleaning glass or 
tackling wine spills on carpet.
 
 Cream of tartar: This white crystalline powder sold in the spice section 
of supermarkets whips up impressive meringue and makes a great paste 
for scrubbing up cookware.
 
 Salt: Another member of the sodium family, sodium chloride — or 
common table salt — is a natural scrubbing agent.
Lathering up with soaps and oils
Soap comes in many forms: bar, liquid, foam, laundry formulas, dish liquid, 
and hand and body bars. But all contain similar elements, including miner-
als, which give soap an alkaline nature, and oils that promote lather and add 
emollient (softening) properties. The time-honored recipe for bar soap has 
been a concoction of animal fat and lye — an extremely corrosive alkaline 
substance that can cause severe burns. You want to avoid contact with skin, 
eyes, and mouth and keep away from children and pets.
The basic liquid soaps on the ingredients list are plant-based, and the alka-
line list includes products not nearly as harsh as lye. You also find essential 
oils in a few of the recipes. Here’s what to shop for:
 
 Liquid castile soap: This vegetable-based soap, found in grocery or 
health-food stores, is a mild and versatile cleaning agent.
 
 Essential oils: Tea tree, peppermint, grapefruit, and other oils (found in 
health-food or craft stores) not only smell great, they have disinfecting 
properties, as well.

237
 Chapter 3: Mixing Up Your Own Green Cleaning Solutions
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
 Glycerin: This common ingredient in hand-wash and dish liquid is an oil 
that provides lubrication and is often used in milder cleaners.
 
 Castor oil: The colorless or sometimes yellowish oil, from the castor 
plant, is a fine lubricant and a worthy ingredient in wood cleaners or 
polishes.
 
 Liquid hand soap and liquid dishwashing soap: The same ingredients — 
castile soap, glycerin — are found in both of these mild cleaners.
Singling out two top workhorses
Baking soda and vinegar are the yin and yang of cleaning ingredients. One 
alkaline and the other acid, the two team up to create a formidable cleaning 
duo. They can stand on their own against some of the toughest challenges: 
Baking soda shines metal surfaces and fixtures, unclogs drains, removes 
odors, and tackles tough baked-on food buildup. Vinegar fights stains, scum, 
mildew, and germs and can make windows gleam. Both are gentle on most 
surfaces and materials — but wait until you see them join forces to clean a 
toilet bowl!
 
Keep a shaker of baking soda and a squirt bottle of vinegar-water solution at 
your kitchen sink and turn to them throughout the day for a variety of needs:
 
 Sprinkle baking soda in an empty sink, give the sink a brief scrub with 
water and a damp cloth or sponge, and rinse with clear water.
 
 Dust baking soda on your cutting board to draw out odor and stains — 
especially if they’re acid-based. Let it sit for 15 minutes or so and then 
rinse.
 
 Set a box of baking soda in your refrigerator to absorb food odors. 
Replace every three months. Pour old baking soda down the sink drain.
 
 Soak rubber gloves in water with a sprinkle of baking soda. Then rinse 
and dry.
 
 Add a sprinkle of baking soda to freshen the cat litter box.
 
 Spray vinegar on counter stains (unless countertops are marble) and let 
soak a few minutes before wiping off.
 
 Keep fingerprints and toothpaste spatter off bathroom mirror with a 
mist of vinegar—just wipe dry with newspaper.
 
 Pour vinegar in the toilet tank to keep odors away.
 
As versatile as white distilled vinegar is, it doesn’t belong in some places: 
cleaning marble or marmoleum floors, for example, or washing cotton, linen, 
rayon, and acetate. Baking soda and other alkaline detergents, on the other 
hand, should not be used on wool or silk.

238
Book III: Green Cleaning 
Cleaning Up with Basic Formulas
You’ve likely bought a spectrum of all-purpose cleaning products that claim 
to clean everything from tub and tile work to Formica counters and appliance 
surfaces. You can make general-use formulas with similar powers with a 
minimum of effort and mess. Several of the recipes in this section include 
one or the other of the two “workhorse” ingredients covered in the previous 
section: baking soda and white distilled vinegar. But I introduce a few of the 
other agents in your new green-cleaning arsenal here.
 
In the cleaners to come, those with vinegar and water can last a long time, 
but those with lemon or essential oils have a shorter shelf life. If your recipes 
contain these last two ingredients, make only a batch and use it up in a day 
or two.
Try sampling one new recipe at a time, testing it, and seeing how you like it. 
Mixing up cleaning formulas is a lot like experimenting in the kitchen: Sometimes 
it takes some tweaks and finessing to get a recipe just where you like it.
 
Check garden-supply centers, hardware stores, and grocery stores for 
plastic spray bottles you can use for your recipes. Quart-size bottles are most 
convenient for big jobs like windows, counters, and showers. Label them so 
that you know what’s in the bottle.
Do-it-all cleaners
These all-purpose cleaners should do everything you need. More abrasive 
cleaners are available commercially, some are quite gritty. Generally, the 
larger and harder the particles, the more abrasive.
Let the sunshine in
Sunshine a cleaning agent? You bet. The ultra-
violet radiation in sunlight works to kill germs. 
No wonder your grandma hung out her wash on 
the clothesline. Not only did the laundry absorb 
that sweet scent of outdoors, the sunlight 
worked to subdue dust mites in the bed sheets 
and bacteria in your grandpa’s socks.
If you live in a sunny area — and a neighbor-
hood that doesn’t have an ordinance against 
clotheslines — take advantage of free solar 
power and let your laundry line-dry. Set freshly 
washed toys, car accessories, doormats, and 
outdoor furniture to dry in the sun on an old 
blanket, quilt, or shower curtain.
Windows filter out much of the ultraviolet rays, 
but you can still get some assistance from the 
sun by opening your curtains and letting the sun 
shine in.

 Chapter 3: Mixing Up Your Own Green Cleaning Solutions

Cleaning
Here are three easy options:
 
 Mix 4 tablespoons baking soda in 1 quart water: This baking soda-
based formula gently scours away dirt, food spills, stains, and buildup 
on most surfaces. Its deodorizing properties make it an ideal solution 
for cleaning refrigerators, microwaves, diaper pails, tiles, coffee pots — 
even baby and children’s toys.
 
 Mix ¼ to ½ cup white vinegar and 1 quart of water in a spray bottle. 
Vinegar is a great degreaser and works especially well to remove soap 
scum in tubs and showers. Spray this mixture on the surface, wait 30 
seconds, and wipe away. Rinse off with hot water if you’re cleaning soap 
scum in tubs, showers, or sinks.
 
 In a quart spray bottle, mix 2 tablespoons peppermint liquid castile 
soap, ¼ cup baking soda, and ¼ cup white vinegar. Add water to fill 
the bottle. This cleaner has a minty scent and works on sinks, showers, 
tile floors — and as a great insect-deterrent when sprayed on outdoor 
plants and flowers.
 
A leading brand name in scented castile soap, Dr. Bronner’s comes in several 
size containers, often available at health-food stores. Some sell it in bulk — 
bring your refillable jug with you.
Tile and vinyl floor cleaner
Both vinyl and tile are tough floorings that clean up beautifully with this 
simple formula. In a bucket, mix 
1⁄8 cup liquid castile soap, 
1⁄8 cup white 
vinegar, and 1 gallon water and then damp mop.
 
If you don’t have castile soap, add another 
1⁄8 cup vinegar.
Linoleum floor cleaner
Made from natural products, including linseed oil and cork flour, linoleum 
is making a comeback because of its green qualities. Care can be more of a 
challenge, however, as excess water and harsh chemicals can cause damage. 
For the necessary wipe-down or spot cleaning, this recipe is a safe remedy. 
Just spray it on a soft mop until it’s just damp, and run it over your floors.
In a quart spray bottle, mix ¼ cup white vinegar and 1½ to 2 cups water.

240
Book III: Green Cleaning 
Window, glass, and mirror cleaner
Newspapers do a great job of shining up glass — and they’re a great green 
solution: Reuse before recycling! But if you object to getting the newsprint all 
over your hands, paper towel is another option. Just be sure to buy a brand 
that’s soft on nature. Do outside windows on an overcast day, as strong sun 
dries the glass before you can buff the windows clean.
 
Don’t use cotton cloth because it leaves lint behind. A microfiber cloth made 
for glass and windows works fine.
A squirt bottle of this mixture and a stack of newspapers can wipe away a 
season’s worth of grime and fool resident birds into thinking that the win-
dows are open. In a spray bottle, combine ½ cup to 1 cup white vinegar and 1 
quart cool water.
Polishing Wood Furniture, Floors, 
and Collectibles
Water isn’t a friend to wood, so the best way to clean it is to dry-dust. Use a 
lint-free rag or microfiber cloth — which traps dust, lint, and pet dander — 
for furniture and collectibles. Dry-mop or vacuum floors to pick up dust and 
food particles. Steer clear of feather dusters: They simply stir up dust rather 
than eliminate it, and their quills can scratch wood surfaces.
When furnishings and floors have collected a little more grime than floating 
dust or lint, you’re probably inclined to ratchet up your efforts. In that case, 
here are some solutions that involve the sparing use of water.
Dust buster for collectibles
White distilled vinegar is a terrific solution for collectibles and fragile items. 
In a bowl or spray bottle, mix 2 cups water, 1 cup white vinegar, and two 
drops of lemon oil (optional for scent).
 
Be cautious when damp-dusting delicate items, antiques, and furnishings 
with old paint, gilding, or gold leaf. Avoid leaving any water on these pieces 
and take care not to rub too vigorously. Leave valuable items to the care of 
professionals in antique care.

241
 Chapter 3: Mixing Up Your Own Green Cleaning Solutions
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
Hardwood floor cleaner
Vacuum or dry-mop floors first to remove crumbs, chunks of dirt, and dust. 
Then follow with this cleaner on a damp rag or mop. In a bucket, mix 3 cups 
white vinegar, 1 tablespoon castile soap, 3 drops grapefruit essential oil, 
and 3 cups water.
Wood furniture polish
Traditional furniture polishes contain beeswax and linseed or lemon oil. You 
can actually take a chunk of beeswax and rub it into your wood furnishings, 
buffing in with a soft cloth. An easy homemade favorite is to mix 1 pint linseed or 
olive oil (or a smaller amount if you prefer) with 4 or 5 drops of lemon essential 
oil (optional for scent) in an open container. Then dab the mixture with cloth 
and rub the oil into furniture, using sparingly.
 
Linseed oil seems to be absorbed more easily than olive oil, which requires 
a bit more elbow grease to buff in. Both oils are expensive to use in large 
quantities. This recipe is definitely not a good use for expensive extra-virgin 
olive oil!
Rolling Out the Carpet Cleaner
A good vacuum is a must for maintaining your carpeting, but effective 
cleaners for spots and shampooing are also important.
Don’t wait for spills to settle in: Take action immediately by picking up the 
debris and follow with a dab of water blotted into the spot gently. Plain water 
is always the first course of action — cold water is the best solution for 
bloodstains and most food stains.
 
Choose a white absorbent cloth or white paper towel to dab out the spot: 
Printed or dyed materials can leave a stain of its own, especially on white or 
light-colored carpet. Don’t use too much water; you don’t want the carpet to 
be damp for long or water to seep down into the pad.
This solution works well for a number of stains, including chocolate and 
blood (if cold water alone doesn’t work). Simply combine ¼ teaspoon of 
clear, plant-based dishwashing liquid with 1 cup warm water.
 
Never use laundry detergent on your carpet. It may contain bleach and be 
too harsh.

242
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
For a strong-staining substance, such as pet urine, mix 1 cup white vinegar 
and 1 cup warm water. Dab mixture on spill and blot to dry.
For wall-to-wall carpet with multiple stains, the best solution is to call in 
carpet-cleaning professionals. (Chapter 6 of this book covers carpet cleaning 
in more detail.)
Keeping Food Surfaces Clean
Because of spoilage and contamination issues surrounding food, surfaces and 
appliances in the kitchen pose unique challenges to the green housekeeper. 
In commercial kitchens — restaurants, institutional cafeterias, and hotels — 
state health laws require strict standards of upkeep, which include using 
hot water and strong disinfectants to clean, eliminating the risk of food-borne 
illnesses. Chlorine bleach is the disinfectant often dictated, but a milder 
choice is hydrogen peroxide. Solutions made up of hydrogen peroxide and 
water or borax and water or vinegar and water have disinfecting properties.
Green commercial cleaners can effectively disinfect surfaces as well. These 
cleaners are suitable for the home environment, and many smell good, too. 
Look for the following characteristics:
 
 Nontoxic, phosphate-free and biodegradable ingredients used when 
possible
 
 Detergents are plant-based, not petroleum based
 
 Never tested on animals, sometimes listed as cruelty-free
 
 Doesn’t create harmful fumes or leave harmful residues behind
 
This book is about home cleaning rather than commercial cleaning, but the 
same health risks exist in the home as in the restaurant. Many experts insist that 
ecofriendly disinfectants, such as vinegar and lemon juice, don’t stand up to 
bleach. So if you’re determined to keep bleach out of your home, you need to be 
even more diligent about food contamination in your kitchen, which has as much 
to do with techniques of food handling as it does with cleaning products.
Oven and stovetop cleaners
Check the oven manufacturer’s instructions before cleaning the oven. If you 
lost them, go online for the answer or call the place you bought the oven. Many 
manufacturers are adding green suggestions to their instruction booklets.
Here are a few tips to get you started:

243
 Chapter 3: Mixing Up Your Own Green Cleaning Solutions
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
 Cornstarch is great for absorbing grease and oily spills. Lightly sprinkle 
cornstarch on your stovetop and allow it to soak up the grease. Wipe 
away with damp sponge.
 
 After a messy spillover — whether blueberry pie or lasagna — wait until 
the oven is cool before attempting to clean. Then sprinkle baking soda 
on spilled food or spray inside of oven with water until damp. Allow to 
sit for several minutes or even overnight. Remove with cleaning cloth or 
paper towel.
 
 If you’re out of baking soda or want a little more “scrub” action, salt is 
a good choice. Simply sprinkle table salt on the spill while the oven is 
still warm. Wait for the salt and stain to cool and then scrape food away. 
Wipe with damp cloth.
 
 To clean your microwave oven, mix ¼ cup baking soda and ½ cup water 
and apply with damp sponge. Let the paste set for several minutes and 
then wipe away with clean sponge.
Cleaners for cookware
As soon as your cookware has cooled after using, put it in the sink to soak in 
water, adding a squirt of dishwashing liquid or a sprinkle of baking soda. This 
method lifts off the burned-on food and makes cleanup easier. After soaking 
your cookware, scrub it with a sponge and finish with hot soapy water or the 
dishwasher, if appropriate. You find more dishwashing tips in Chapter 4.
The following combinations are for pots and pans that may have years of 
buildup and won’t come clean with a general washing:
 
 Stainless Steel Rejuvenator: Pour water in a pot until halfway to almost 
full. Add ½ cup of white vinegar and bring to boil. Immediately reduce 
heat and simmer 30 minutes to 1 hour. Empty and wash as usual.
 
 Aluminum Illuminator: You can shine up your aluminum cookware and 
rub new life into pots and pans. Add water until the pot is halfway to 
three-fourths full. Add 2 tablespoons cream of tartar or ½ cup of white 
vinegar to water. Bring to boil. Then reduce heat and simmer 10 to 15 
minutes. Empty and wash as usual.
 
 Burned-On Grease Cleaner: Baking soda works well at removing built-
up grease from any kind of cookware. After the pan cools, scrape out 
surface grease. Fill pan with water and sprinkle in baking soda. Place pan 
on stovetop and bring to boil. When grease floats to the top of the water, 
remove from heat. Let cool. Wash as usual.
 
Don’t make the mistake of putting dishwashing liquid into the dishwasher. 
You’ll end up with tons of suds spilling out all over the floor.

Cleaning metals and silverware
 
You can wipe the stickiness right off refrigerator door handles, faucets, 
fixtures, cabinet pulls, and more by mixing ¼ cup white vinegar and ½ cup 
water. Using a clean cloth, wipe the surfaces with the mixture.
For sinks and silverware, consult the manufacturer’s recommendations. 
Stainless steel flatware can go right in the dishwasher.
If you use your silverware on a daily basis, good for you! Simply wash in the 
sink with mild soap and hot water, dry, and put away. If you pull out the good 
stuff only rarely, storing it properly can help cut down on tarnish. Nevertheless, 
you may need to polish once or twice a year. Apply a low-abrasion white tooth-
paste (not gel) to a soft toothbrush and gently brush the silverware. Rinse with 
warm water and dry thoroughly with a towel or silver polishing cloth.
 
If you prefer to keep your toothpaste in the medicine cabinet, here’s another 
traditional favorite that works equally well. Combine 1 cup water with 2 table-
spoon baking soda in a measuring cup. Apply mixture to silver with a soft 
cloth, rubbing until dry.
This last concoction is great for cleaning stainless steel sinks. It’s more to 
the watery side than a pasty texture. In a bowl or bucket, mix 3 tablespoons 
baking soda, 1 drop of essential oil (for scent, optional), and 1½ cups water.
Tackling Water-Challenged Areas
No area of the house gets wetter than the bathroom. And along with all that 
water come the accompanying problems of mold, mildew, mineral buildup, 
lime and scale, soap scum, and clogs. The traditional solutions to these 
challenges have relied on some pretty strong chemicals: Caustic lye and 
chlorine bleach are two of the most familiar agents to plumbing, fixtures, 
porcelain and tile.
The fact is, these tough chemicals do attack the problems ferociously — 
you can see the scum just fizz away! But if you’re committed to retiring these 
toxic elements, you have other ways to combat those troublesome water-
loving blights. Plenty of cleaners that claim to be green are on the market, 
but sometimes it’s hard to read between the lines to determine whether 
they’re really free of the petrochemicals and elements toxic to the residents 
of your home and damaging to the earth.
Use the mild and medium all-purpose cleaners already covered in “Cleaning 
Up with Basic Formulas” for countertops, tub, and tile floors. Baking soda 
with a small amount of water makes a mild abrasive paste that you can apply 
with a sponge or soft cloth to sinks and faucets.

Battling mold, mildew, and other buildup
Chlorine bleach has been the conventional cleaner of choice for mold and 
mildew. Eliminating mold and mildew is crucial because they can lead to 
serious health issues.
 
A preemptive effort is to keep the bathroom and other areas of the house as 
dry as possible. Make sure that the air in your home is circulating effectively. 
Use the bathroom fan during and after showering. You may even consider 
using a dehumidifier to remove excess dampness.
To keep mold and mildew at bay, mix ¼ cup hydrogen peroxide and 1 cup 
water in a spray bottle. Spray on problem areas. Do not rinse off.
Removing soap scum, water stains, 
and lime and mineral deposits
The mild all-purpose cleaners mentioned earlier in this chapter in the 
“Cleaning Up with Basic Formulas” section are great for eliminating soap 
scum and water stains. For a bit more punch, increase the vinegar for a 1-to-1 
ratio. It works on tile, porcelain, and metal fixtures and drain covers.
For lime and mineral deposits, use vinegar straight-up, wiping on with a rag. 
For extra-stubborn spots, leave the rag on for several minutes or one hour. 
Then wipe dry.
Flushing away dirt and germs
The toilet area is another hot spot for bacteria. In addition to store-bought 
green cleaners, vinegar and baking soda are two tough agents. Use any of the 
all-purpose cleaners appearing in the “Cleaning Up with Basic Formulas” sec-
tion in this chapter. You may want to use paper towels to clean the outside 
the toilet — or be sure the sponges and cloths you use for the toilet aren’t 
used for anything else. One technique is to put the disinfectant in the toilet 
and let it stand while you clean the rest of the bathroom. Then swish with the 
toilet brush and flush.
This mix gives you a fun mini-explosion when the alkaline baking soda and 
acidic vinegar meet up in the toilet:
 
1. Sprinkle sides with baking soda and allow to stand for a few minutes.
 
2. Pour in ¼ to ½ cup vinegar and let stand for 15 minutes.
 
3. Scrub with toilet brush and flush.

246
Book III: Green Cleaning 
Cleaning and Unclogging Drains
One of the easiest ways to keep your drain clean is to pour ½ to 1 cup baking 
soda down the drain. Follow with dripping warm water. Perform once every 
week or two. Be sure to let it stand a few minutes before rinsing — if you 
flush it out too quickly, the baking soda won’t have much effect.
 
To combat rusty drains and dirty garbage disposals, rub the cut side of a 
halved lemon half on rust around drain and on faucets. Rinse with water. 
Then put the used lemons in the disposal and grind for freshening — or 
throw in your compost bucket.
If a clogged showerhead is an issue, remove the showerhead and clear holes 
with an old toothbrush or unbent paperclip. Rinse with clear water. Then 
place the showerhead in a bowl or bucket and cover it with vinegar. Soak 
overnight to remove deposits. Rinse with clear water, dry, and put back in 
place.
Drain cleaner
For trouble-free maintenance, mix up a batch of this cleaner and use once a 
week: 1 cup salt, 1 cup baking soda, and ¼ cup cream of tartar.
Pour ¼ cup of this mixture into the drain. Rinse with water. Repeat as 
necessary or save the rest of the batch for the future.
Drain declogger
If this process doesn’t work, try a plunger or call the plumber.
 
1. Pour ½ to 1 cup of baking soda down the drain.
 
2. Follow with ½ to 1 cup of vinegar, pouring slowly.
 
3. When you hear a fizzing sound, cover the drain and let stand for 5 
minutes.
 
4. Pour boiling water into drain.
A Laundry List of Solutions
In addition to taking steps to reduce your energy and water consumption, 
your choice of detergents, soaps, softeners, and spot removers can help you 
improve your personal environmental report card in the laundry room.

Removing stains is a bit tricky, because some fibers are weakened by certain 
chemicals. Strong alkaline substances, such as washing soda, for example, can 
ruin delicate wool and silk, but small amounts of washing soda can be good for 
removing oil and grease stains on sturdier fabrics. Always check the label on 
your garments to determine their fiber content and washing instructions.
Water is your first solution for most fabrics. So as soon as you drop food or 
drink or whatever, try to wipe it off with clean water. Here are a few solutions 
when you need a little more power.
White clothing stain remover
This prewash treatment isn’t appropriate for silk, but it’s great for handling 
stains on most other whites.
Mix 1 tablespoon borax and 6 tablespoons water to create a paste. Dab the 
mixture on stains. Follow with normal washing.
Presoak and fabric softener
A favorite and easy fabric softener is to add ¼ to ½ cup white vinegar to the 
rinse cycle in an automatic washing machine. If your washer requires you to 
add the fabric softener at the start of the rinse cycle to and you don’t want to 
be a wash-watcher, try this presoak, which also removes stains.
 
1. Mix 2 tablespoons cream of tartar and 1 gallon hot water in a bucket 
and then let cool.
 
2. Let the fabrics sit in the mixture for a half-hour or until the stain is 
released.
 
3. Rinse with fresh water.
 
4. Launder as normal.
Freshening clothes
If a garment doesn’t require a washing but needs an airing-out, hanging it 
out in the sun is a much gentler remedy than spraying it with a clothing 
freshener — which is, in essence, a perfume masking the musty odor of the 
clothing.
 
If fading is concerned, turn the garment inside-out. This tactic also serves to 
expose the underarm area, which is likely where most of the freshening is 
needed.

248
Book III: Green Cleaning 
Laundering
As you prepare to launder, always remember to read garment and linen 
labels and follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using a washing 
machine.
 
 Use the proper load setting for the size of each load.
 
 Match the temperature setting to type of cleaning desired is also 
important.
 
 When using detergent, measure properly. If you use too much, the load 
won’t rinse properly.
Here are some beginning recipes for cleaning everyday home laundry. 
Remember that many green product makers offer ecofriendly laundry 
detergents.
Dry laundry detergent
Mix the following ingredients and store them in an airtight container:
1 cup soap flakes or shreds of homemade soap, or any store-bought type 
without lotion
½ cup washing soda
½ cup borax
A few drops of essential oil (optional for scent)
Use ¼ cup to 1 cup detergent, depending on the size of the load and the 
machine type.
Liquid laundry detergent
Use ¼ to 
3⁄4 cup of this detergent per load. You might need to remix it before 
you use it. It tends to congeal.
1 cup soap flakes (homemade soap, or any store-bought type without 
lotion)
½ cup washing soda
½ cup borax
2 tablespoons glycerin
2 cups water
Mix soap, washing soda, and borax. Add glycerin and water, stirring until 
thoroughly combined.

Cleaning Up the Odds and Ends
Beyond the typical household cleaning tasks that involve floors, furniture, 
fixtures, and more are some unique surfaces or materials that need to be 
cleaned, too. Here are some ways to address those items:
 
 For a gentle paint remover for your hands, use vegetable oil instead of 
paint thinner.
 
 You can use this gentle cleaner for your garage floor or patio or kitchen 
floor. Mix ¼ cup mild dishwashing liquid with 2 gallons warm water and 
apply. Rinse with clean water and air dry.
 
 When cleaning your vehicle’s exterior, do not use anything abrasive 
on the finish — that means no grit, such as baking soda, or anything 
acidic like vinegar. Try mixing several squirts or ¼ cup of mild liquid 
dishwashing detergent with 1 gallon of water in a bucket. Get some suds 
going, throw in the sponge, and clean away! Rinse with clean water, use 
a squeegee, and buff the car dry with a clean cloth.
The best way to get your house to smell good is to rid it of sources of bad 
odor. But when that’s not possible, here’s a spray with disinfecting ingredi-
ents that also seems to suppress unpleasant odors. In a spray bottle, mix 1 
teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon vinegar or lemon juice, and 2 cups water.
 
Try this realtor trick to freshen up your house. Add 3 or 4 cinnamon sticks 
to 4 cups boiling water. Simmer for an hour or so. (Don’t let all the water 
evaporate out of the pan.)

T
hrough the miracles of modern machinery, clothes from not-so-fresh to 
downright dirty are delivered clean, bright, good-smelling, and ready to 
be worn and used again. This transformation doesn’t occur with the press of 
a button. A lot of resources go into turning dirty laundry into once-again 
presentable apparel.
Because laundry-room activity consumes so much energy and water, the 
green changes you make to your clothes-cleaning practices are sure to have a 
positive impact on lightening your household’s carbon footprint.
Giving Your Appliances a Break
When you replace your old-dinosaur washer and dryer with the most efficient 
models on the market and maintain them well, you can see your energy use 
drop. But the most effective way to cut down on their energy consumption? 
Use your washer and dryer less often.
Hand-washing small loads
Unless you live in a commune or are part of a very large family, you’re likely 
to have some small loads to wash. Socks and undies just don’t take up much 
space in the machine, for example, making the electricity a load of laundry 
consumes hard to justify. The greener choice is to hand-wash any small loads 
you encounter in your laundry adventures.

252
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
For items that require temperatures a little more torrid than tepid (cleaning 
rags, for example), fill a bucket or the laundry sink with steam-emitting hot 
water and soap, scrub the clothing by hand, and let the items soak. This 
practice keeps your hot-water use under control, but gives you the peace of 
mind that the grimiest, germiest articles get a high-powered cleaning.
Hand-washing is a practical option for lingerie and other garments too 
delicate for the agitator or even the gentler frontload tumbler. And for any 
less-than-full-load-sized piles of dirty laundry, a scrub in the laundry tub can 
be an easy cleaning option that saves the wear and tear on your washer and 
cuts down on water and electricity.
 
If you like scent, add a couple of drops of essential oils to hand washables. 
Lavender is a favorite, said to induce a state of relaxation. Citrus or pepper-
mint offers a fresh, wake-up aroma.
Wash and wear (and wear and wear)
Adherents to the wear-it-once school of fashion assume that a single wearing 
can dirty or soil an item so badly that it must be washed again. Sometimes 
that’s true, but as long as you’re not sweating profusely or rolling around in 
the mud regularly, many outer garments — sweaters, jackets, even casual 
pants — can be worn two, three, or more times before they need cleaning.
If you’re concerned that your preworn clothing smells “stale” or looks worn, 
try these tips to freshen up your apparel without dedicating yet another 
wash cycle to getting it clean:
 
 Air it out. Hang your clothing on a hanger in a room with good circulation. 
Better yet, weather permitting, let it hang outside in the sun for a bit. 
Turn items inside-out to avoid fading and to expose the underside to the 
disinfecting powers of the sun.
 
 Give it a rest. When you let your garments breathe between wearings, 
you can often wear them more times without feeling like a walking laundry 
hamper. If you allow the jeans you wore on day one to air out on day two, 
they seem “cleaner” when you wear them again on day three.
 
 Brush it off. If you see lint, cat hair, grit, or other stuff collecting on the 
material, take a clothes or a lint brush to the item.
 
 Spot-clean stains. The sooner you catch stains, the better. Sometimes all 
it takes is a dab of cold water to get out a bit of dirt. (See the “Removing 
stains” section, later in this chapter, for more information.)
 
 Hang it back up. Remind the kids to hang up their bath towels so that 
they can use them again.

Line-drying, inside and out
Not only does sun-drying cut down on your energy use, the disinfectant 
properties of sunshine help kill bacteria as clothing and bedding dry, aided 
by gentle breezes.
Line-drying your clothes outside can be as simple as stretching clothesline 
(found in most grocery and hardware stores) from one tree to another or as 
complicated as a kit that includes zinc pulleys, hooks, a clothesline wire, a 
line tightener, and a line divider. With this technology, you can stand in one 
place and pull the line to you for hanging up or removing clothes.
You can also install a fold-up pole dryer in your backyard. This contraption 
usually has an aluminum center pole with folding steel-coated arms that 
accommodate two to three loads of wash. The arms rotate, and you can place 
unmentionables so that they’re not visible to the street or the neighbors. Also, 
when the arms are down, the pole itself is fairly unobtrusive in the landscape.
 
If you or someone else in your household suffers from allergies, hanging bed 
sheets and towels on the line during pollen season isn’t a good idea.
Conditions aren’t always amenable to outdoor drying, and some clothes 
don’t do as well when hung out to dry. Follow these suggestions to make the 
most of your indoor and outdoor space:
 
 For towels, bathrobes, and other heavy materials that take a long time 
to dry — or dry stiff and rough — hang on the line until partially dry and 
then finish up with a brief spin in the dryer.
 
 Knits and sweaters tend to stretch when hung on a line. Better to lay 
them flat to retain their shape. You can set up a mesh dryer rack so that 
air circulates around the fabric.
 
 When weather permits, hang up damp dishtowels, washcloths, hand 
towels, and bath towels and let them dry in the sun. Then replace them 
on your towel bars to be reused.
 
 If you live in a wet, humid, or perpetually gray place, you can dry wet 
clothes in well-circulated rooms. Install a retractable clothesline in your 
laundry room or get a drying rack.
 
 At your house, use the bathtub to stretch out sweaters and items that 
need to be dried flat. To control inside humidity, you may want to put a 
fan in your drying area.

Book III: Green Cleaning 
Making Sense of Laundry Products
Wander the housekeeping aisle of any grocery store and prepare to be 
overwhelmed by options for cleaning your clothes, but doing the laundry 
doesn’t have to be complicated. Basically, you clean your clothes with the 
same stuff you use to clean everything else: soap or detergent. There is a 
difference between the two; in a nutshell, soap is most often derived from 
plants, oils, ash, and other natural ingredients, and detergents are commonly 
made of synthetic surfactants, based on — you guessed it — petroleum-based 
compounds.
Both are effective cleaners, but when it comes to washing clothes, the 
popular choice has been detergent. Soaps, many complain, leave a film on 
fabric that turns the material dull and gray, but they’re the greener choice.
Zeroing in on green alternatives
Ecofriendly laundry detergents substitute plant-based oils for the nonrenewable, 
petroleum-based components. They typically are free of heavy perfumes, 
although many are scented with essential oils, such as lavender and orange. 
And they also omit dyes and optical brighteners — for those who prefer their 
clothes to be truly clean rather than coated with something that makes the 
material look whiter. (You want clothes to be clean, not glow in the dark like 
George Hamilton’s smile.)
Many consumers say that plant-based cleaners often don’t seem to do as 
good a job getting clothes really, really clean. Adding a laundry booster, which 
improves the power of other laundry cleaners and are good for presoak-
ing, can give your cleaner the edge: Two are washing soda and borax. (See 
Chapter 3 for more about these mainstay ingredients of the green cleaning 
cupboard.) Add ½ cup along with your laundry detergent at the beginning 
of the wash cycle. Or use as a presoak — 2 tablespoons in a gallon of water 
ought to loosen up the toughest stains in 30 minutes.
 
The newest high-efficiency (HE) washers require low-sudsing detergents, 
and the green aisle offers a selection of them. HE machines also take much 
less soap than the traditional top-loading agitator models. So go easy on the 
amount. Follow instructions to avoid suds overflow.
Getting soft on laundry
Fabric softeners reduce friction and static electricity. They give material a 
soft, fluffy feel and often provide a sweet or fresh smell.

255
 Chapter 4: Making Green Work of Laundry
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
These formulas don’t, however, aid the cleaning process in any way. The 
conventional brands typically contain petrochemicals and ingredients, such 
as artificial fragrance, that have been linked to air, water, and health concerns. 
Moreover, liquid softeners and dryer sheets can cause skin rashes and 
asthmatic reactions.
And don’t think you’re safe with dryer balls, either. Although advertised as 
environmentally friendly, the spiky, rubbery devices you throw in the dryer 
to “naturally” soften your clothes are made of polyvinyl chloride (yes, PVC), 
which may result in the release of carcinogenic substances.
Even the green softeners may be considered a waste of resources, what with 
the manufacturing, packaging, and shipping required. But if you love the effect 
of fabric softener, it’s your decision; just choose wisely and use sparingly.
 
For a similar anti-static, softening result, try one of these ingredients in the 
rinse cycle:
 
 ½ cup of baking soda
 
 ¼ cup of borax
 
 ¼ cup white distilled vinegar
Material Matters
Your clothing plays a part in your home’s energy-consumption habits. Factors 
such as material, color, and quality all determine how often an item should 
be washed — and how. Understanding fabric and its care is an important step 
in making choices that reduce your laundry energy load. Checking out the 
care label of a garment before you buy can help you select responsibly for 
minimizing the energy demands for cleaning and maintaining your clothing.
Preparing clothes for the wash
Pre-sorting the laundry is a great tactic for cleaning most efficiently. By 
dividing your clothing into like loads, you’re more likely to wash in a way that 
requires less energy and less water and maintain your garments so that they 
last longer.
 
Of course, if you’ve switched over to cold-water wash, you’ve already 
reduced the risk of making colors run, fabrics shrink and wrinkle, and 
material wear faster.

256
Book III: Green Cleaning 
Still, follow these tips to ensure the best results when you do your laundry:
 
 Sort laundry by color, separating whites and light colors from garments 
with intense color.
 
 Separate items that are stained or heavily soiled or require special pre-
treatment.
 
 Pull out clothing that must be hand-washed.
 
 Place delicates in a mesh bag to avoid hand-washing. In the bag, they’re 
less likely to snag during the cycle.
 
 Check the label for each article: Even in a load of reds, you may want to 
treat an item likely to bleed separately.
 
 Imported fabrics and madras can bleed for many, many loads, so don’t 
assume that if it’s been washed before, it won’t bleed again.
 
 If you’re washing a load in warm or hot water, double-check the labels to 
be sure that nothing in that batch can shrink or bleed.
 
 Turn dark-colored clothing, such as jeans and cotton T-shirts, inside out 
before washing to reduce fading.
 
 Check pockets before throwing garments in the wash. Those used tis-
sues wreak enough havoc, but heaven forbid that a lipstick or a perma-
nent marker gets by, permanently marking your favorite white shirt.
 
 Fasten Velcro openings, clasp hook-and-eye fasteners, and zip zippers to 
prevent snagging and snarling with other garments.
Removing stains
Blood, grass, grease, lipstick. When you discover these stains on your gar-
ments, you know a regular wash won’t do the trick. You’ve got to take deci-
sive steps and laser-focus on the stain if you’re going to get it out.
 
Conventional spot removers are good at getting out some of these more chal-
lenging stains, but many contain nasty solvent ingredients — the kind that do 
unfriendly things to your air passages and put groundwater at risk.
You can find earth-friendly spot removers on the shelves of big box stores 
and even conventional supermarkets. Or you can make your own by pulling 
these stain-zapping ingredients right off your shelf or out of your refrigerator:
 
 Baking soda
 
 Borax
 
 Club soda
 
 Lemon juice

Best course of action when discovering a stain is to take care of it immedi-
ately. Water is always your first and best defense. When in doubt, always use 
cold water rather than warm water. Many stains, such as blood and tomato, 
are protein-based, and hot water can set the stain. If a bit of plain cold water 
doesn’t do the trick, try the solutions in Table 4-1.
Table 4-1 
Solutions for Specific Stains
Stain
Solution
Berries
Soak the spot with cold water and then let it soak in lemon 
juice for 20 minutes. Rinse with cold water and launder as 
usual.
Blood
Wash stain with cold water. If that doesn’t do it, use a 
little baking soda, liquid soap, salt, or other alkaline-based 
agent.
Chocolate
Soak fabric in cold water. If that doesn’t work, dab with 
liquid laundry detergent. 
Coffee
Rinse with warm water and then soak in a mixture of half 
borax and half water. When the stain is gone, rinse with 
warm water and air dry. 
Fruit juice
For a substantial stain, pour boiling water on sturdy fabrics, 
warm water on delicates. For a light drop or two of juice, a 
quick once-over with cold water should do the trick. Grape 
juice may take more effort than lemonade. 
Grass
Bring on the liquid dish soap and warm water and then 
rinse with clear water. For more stubborn stains, try white 
distilled vinegar or cream of tartar.
Ink
A little dishwashing liquid and water may remove a small 
stain. For more stubborn spots, try white distilled vinegar. 
A little white wine or vodka may lift the spot out, too.
Tomato-based 
foods, such as 
pasta sauce or 
ketchup
Rinse immediately with cold water and then rub on liquid 
dishwashing or laundry detergent. Let it set for a few 
minutes and rinse again with cold water. If the stain 
remains, try laundering with a cup of white distilled vinegar 
in the wash, followed by a cool-water rinse.

Solution
Lipstick
Put stained garment or linen on an old white towel and 
soak with a solution of water and dishwashing detergent. 
Blot to remove the stain. The lipstick should seep under 
onto the towel. Follow by laundering. Baking soda and 
water may work as well. 
Perspiration
Make a solution of 4 tablespoons of salt in 1 quart of hot 
water. Sponge the area with this mixture, rinse well, and 
launder as usual. 
Red wine
Gently dab the spot with club soda until the stain is 
removed. Follow by laundering. 
Sunscreen
Remove any remaining lotion, then sprinkle with baking 
soda, and allow to sit for an hour or two. Shake off the 
residue and sponge with a small amount of dishwashing 
liquid and warm water. Launder as usual. 
Urine
Soak in ¼ cup white vinegar in a quart of water, remove, 
and launder as usual. Works for human and pet urine. 
Yellowing
Prescrub with a mild liquid detergent. Then wash as usual 
in the washing machine. 
 
Some solutions can weaken certain material fibers: Cotton, for example, 
doesn’t take too well to acidic bases, such as vinegar or lemon juice. Always 
read the care instructions on the inside of a garment before treating with any 
stain remover. Once stains have become set in the dryer, it may be nearly 
impossible to remove them. Fresh stains are easier to remove than stains 
that have dried.

our green-living philosophy can smoothly align with the tenets of 
germ-free kitchens and baths. These rooms pose some of the greatest 
challenges to clean, let alone clean green. The kitchen is the heart of the 
house — and the stomach. Food preparation and disposal bring to light 
issues all their own. And bathrooms raise quite a few issues of their own, 
most of them less than appetizing — from the soap scum that clings to tile 
walls and shower curtain to the shaving cream and toothpaste detritus that 
coat the sink.
In this chapter, you find tips for keeping your family healthy and your kitchen 
and baths clean.
Handling Food Properly
Storing, preparing, and serving food involves more than merely keeping a 
tidy kitchen: Ensuring that perishable items are stored properly, food sur-
faces are kept scrupulously clean, and methods of meal preparation eliminate 
possible cross-contamination is absolutely critical for your safety.

260
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
Raw meat and contaminated produce can leave behind dangerous bacteria 
such as E. coli and salmonella in preparation areas, on knives, and on towels 
reused for wiping up after spills. Children and the elderly are especially at 
risk of food-borne illness. Meat, poultry, and eggs have long been considered 
the biggest threat, but contamination can come from many sources — even 
packaged spinach. Clean food-handling practices can’t prevent all food-borne 
illnesses, but they sure cut way down on these risks.
Adherence takes strict attention and can sometimes seem a challenge to 
your environmental principles. After all, many of these steps involve liberal 
amounts of hot water, or you may be advised to use disposable wipes or 
towels to avoid contamination. The safe choice may be to throw out quanti-
ties of food if its freshness is in question. And your concern about disease 
and disinfecting may pressure you to use chemicals that are decidedly 
unhealthy for the planet.
 
Depending upon how you maintain and care for them, your cleaning imple-
ments can serve as your staunch allies for clean — or traitorous enemies. 
Sponges, dish cloths, mops, and scrubbers tend to be damp mediums that 
serve as breeding ground for all kinds of gruesome germ life. For more on 
keeping these items free of bacteria, see Chapter 2.
Fighting food contamination 
without chemicals
For the most part, you can keep a clean and safe kitchen and still adhere to 
your environmental principles. Here are general guidelines for protecting 
your food from contamination.
 
 Keep your refrigerator at the proper settings (36 to 39°F) to ensure that 
food is cool enough not to spoil.
 
 Adhere to the expiration dates on all perishables, especially meat.
 
 Keep refrigerated food well wrapped.
 
 Keep meat products separate from fruits and vegetables.
 
 Place meat on the lowest shelf to reduce risk of juices dripping on other 
food items.
 
 Wash any produce that is to be eaten raw — even if you plan to peel it.
 
 Don’t prepare vegetables, fruits, or other foods on the same surface or 
with the same knife used for poultry, beef, pork, or fish, until it has been 
scrubbed clean with soap and hot water.
 
 Use separate cutting boards: one for meat, another for fruits and vegeta-
bles, and perhaps even another for bread or other food items. (For more 
on keeping your cutting boards sanitized, see the next section.)

261
 Chapter 5: Bringing Kitchens and Baths to a Green-Clean Sheen
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
 Don’t reuse the same cloth towel to wipe up spills from food, especially 
animal products, including eggs. In some cases, you may feel justified in 
using paper towel to avoid contamination.
 
 Don’t reuse plastic bags or packaging that has held poultry or other 
animal products. Wash thoroughly and let dry before recycling.
Keeping cutting boards germ-free
In addition to using separate cutting boards for meats and produce, you also 
need to wash them with dishwashing liquid and hot water every time you use 
them and dry them thoroughly before you put them away. (This method is 
the best way to clean wood cutting boards, which don’t hold up in the dish-
washer and don’t take to harsh cleaners — even vinegar can be too acidic.)
Dishwashers have hotter water than your hands can stand, so you can trust 
that your plastic cutting boards are thoroughly sanitized after a wash. If 
you plan to clean them in this way, be sure that the cutting boards are dish-
washer safe: Most acrylic or plastic boards are.
 
Bamboo is another cutting board alternative. This rapidly renewable, earth-
friendly material is extremely hard and durable and has some antibacterial 
properties. Bamboo boards are typically formaldehyde- and toxic-finish–free, 
but check to make sure. (Now if they could only grow bamboo closer to home 
to skip all that embodied energy from shipping from Asia!) Clean bamboo cut-
ting boards as you do wooden boards: dish soap and hot water.
Doing the Dishes
Is it more environmentally friendly to do your dishes by hand or in the dish-
washer? Opinions vary. Most sources weigh in on the side of the automatic 
dishwasher.
The pros and cons of automatic 
dishwashers
An automatic dishwasher’s efficiency depends on several factors:
 
 Newer, Energy Star dishwashers use less energy, less water, and less hot 
water than other models — especially those manufactured before 1994. 
If you’re ready to replace your old model, visit www.energystar.gov 
for research about the benefits and efficient operation of dishwashers.

262
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 Running your dishwasher with a full load cuts down on the number of 
loads you do, reducing energy and water usage. If you’re single or have a 
small family, you may need to run it only every other day, or less.
 
 Taking advantage of the dishwasher’s most energy-efficient settings 
improves energy efficiency, too. Choose the air-dry feature and avoid 
the heat-dry, rinse-hold, or pre-rinse options.
Do review the manufacturer’s instructions for use. (If missing, go to the 
manufacturer’s Web site.) Some models require you to dispense detergent 
for each load, while others have a place to insert a bottle of detergent, which 
dispenses just the right amount based on water hardness, cycle selection, 
and soil level of the dishes.
From a green perspective, dishwashers may have some drawbacks:
 
 If you find yourself pre-rinsing or scraping your dishes manually before 
placing them in the dishwasher, you’re doing double-duty.
 
 Water-saving or energy-saving dishwashers may or may not work well. 
Using the no-heat option may make the cycle longer or leave glasses 
spotty. Some appliance experts suggest adding a rinse agent, which 
prevents water from beading and causing marks. However, a rinse agent 
adds another set of chemicals to the process.
 
Most conventional automatic dishwashing detergents contain phosphates or 
chlorine. Green brands eliminate these ingredients, but many find that dishes 
don’t come as clean and spot-free, especially if you have hard water. This 
factor alone may be enough to persuade you to stick to hand-washing.
Doing dishes by hand
To make the most of washing by hand, follow these tips:
 
 Use hot water. Protect your hands with dish gloves. (When finished, turn 
gloves inside-out, sprinkle with baking soda, and allow to air-dry.)
 
 To avoid running the water while washing, fill the basin with enough hot 
soapy water to cover or immerse dishes. Then fill a dish tub or the other 
side of the sink with hot water for rinsing.
 
 Use a mild but grease-cutting dish soap that contains plant-based 
surfactants rather than bleach- or ammonia-based cleaners.
 
 Add a tablespoon or two of baking soda to hot, sudsy dishwater to cut 
the grease and loosen sticky foods on dishes.

263
 Chapter 5: Bringing Kitchens and Baths to a Green-Clean Sheen
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
 Add vinegar to the tubs of rinse water to eliminate the suds.
 
 Towel dry or, better yet, air-dry on a plate rack next to the sink. Air-
drying is the most sanitary practice, as damp dishtowels collect germs.
Getting Down to Clean Floors
The following are the greenest cleaning tips for most floors, unless otherwise 
indicated.
 
 To keep floors cleaner longer, put floor mats at outside entrances into the 
kitchen, as well as one in front of the sink and under pet food/water areas.
 
 Vacuum or sweep the floor to remove loose dirt. Brooms have been 
improved to have bumper guards so that they’re less likely to dent cabinets 
or furniture. When sweeping, use short, powerful strokes and a dust pan.
 
 Damp mop once a week or as needed, using a mild cleaning solution — 
either a commercial green solution or one of the recipes in Chapter 3. 
Some of the best recipes include white distilled vinegar and maybe some 
liquid soap.
 
 Choose a porous sponge mop with an abrasive strip for coaxing stuck-on 
gunk or use a mop with reusable microfiber head.
 
 Consider an electric steam cleaner, also called a steam mop, which uses 
nothing more than tap water. This cleaner is especially great for tile, 
marble, slate, and sealed-wood surfaces.
 
 Do not wax kitchen floors, because that makes them slippery. A properly 
sealed floor should provide enough shine, which re-emerges on a dry 
mopping or damp mopping.
Tackling the toughest floor problems
Everyday dirt, such as food and drink spills, 
clean up easily, but some substances pose out-
of-the-ordinary challenges:
  Dried paint: Carefully chip away with a putty 
knife and follow with a green all-purpose 
floor cleaner.
  Shoe scuff marks: Rubbing with a sock 
should take them away. If not, apply a green 
cleaner with a soft cloth and buff dry.
  Chewing gum and candle wax: Apply ice in 
a muslin bag or wrapped in an old T-shirt to 
the gum or wax, and it should flake off with 
a putty knife. (Don’t have a putty knife? A 
butter knife will do; what you don’t want is 
something sharp that may gouge the floor.)

Cleaning Kitchen Surfaces: From 
Sink to Stove and Beyond
Green concerns aside, conventional cleaners include abrasive powdered 
cleansers and chlorine-based formulas, which aren’t good for some sinks and 
other surfaces.
The following sections give you some ideas for treating your kitchen surfaces 
well but leaving them well cleaned.
Scrubbing (gently) the sink
Kitchen sinks come in many materials. In most cases, a similar cleaning rou-
tine applies for all:
 
1. Routinely wipe out the sink with water to keep foods, oils, and stains 
from building up.
 
2. For a good cleaning, add a few drops of the same soap you use for 
your dishes into your sink.
 
 Use hand-washing dish soap, not automatic dish detergent. Baking soda 
is an alternative to dish soap, or you can use a combination of both.
 
3. Lightly wet the sink with a splash from the faucet or use a damp 
sponge and wipe ’til it shines.
 
 Avoid using anything abrasive, including steel wool or caustic powder 
cleaners that can scar or pit the surface.
 
4. Rinse the sink with water.
 
5. Pat the sink dry with a towel or simply allow to air-dry.
 
 If you have hard water, you may need to rub down the sink with dry 
paper towels to remove water spots.
Some sink materials pose unique cleaning challenges:
 
 Stainless steel: Thinner material may mean more stains, dings, and 
dents, so consider your choice carefully when installing a new stainless 
steel sink.
 
 Porcelain enamel: If yellowing is a problem, try distilled white vinegar 
(a tablespoon in a cup of water) and rub the surface with a clean cloth 
or sponge, let sit for a few minutes, and rinse with water.
 
 Solid surface: More commonly known by brand names such as Corian 
or Silestone, these surfaces are nonporous and inhospitable to bacteria. 
For routine care, check with the manufacturer’s recommendations.

265
 Chapter 5: Bringing Kitchens and Baths to a Green-Clean Sheen
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
 Copper and brass: These materials are more often used as bar sinks or 
accessory sinks. Both are very sensitive materials, so follow the manu-
facturer’s recommendations. For a sink that’s heavily stained, try a 
mixture of salt and water. Use a soft rag or sponge and rub the sink with 
a mixture and then add a little lemon juice to cleanse. Rinse with water 
and then dry completely with soft clean towel. Avoid any strong acids or 
bleaches, even glass cleaners!
 
 Stone: A bit unusual, but granite, soapstone, and marble sinks do exist. 
The best advice is to do what the manufacturer recommends. Don’t use 
ammonia or strong soaps or detergents.
Attending to faucets, drains, and disposals
Don’t forget to clean your faucets, drains, and garbage disposal. For rou-
tine cleaning, follow the same guidelines as for sinks: dishwashing liquid or 
baking soda and a sponge work fine. Pour baking soda down the drain to 
neutralize odors and rinse with cool water. If the faucets are made of chrome, 
a vinegar and water mixture works — go for the gleam! Remove any food 
remnants or soap scum around the base — an old toothbrush helps you get 
into those cracks and crevices. Attend to the pull-out sprayer. Older ones, 
especially, get a lot of buildup. You can soak the sprayer in vinegar and water 
to dissolve the mineral buildup.
While grinding up food in the garbage disposal may at first blush seem green, 
it’s not. First, proper use of the disposal requires a lot of water, an increas-
ingly precious natural resource. And running the disposal requires electric-
ity. If you’re on a septic system, you have to worry about sludge buildup, 
which can lead to serious plumbing problems. And sewage treatment results 
in a sludge that winds up in a landfill or is used as fertilizer. But with all 
the poisons tossed down the nation’s drains, that material contains a lot of 
toxins and harmful chemicals. So compost everything you can, throw away 
anything that can damage your drains, and use your disposal with discretion, 
following the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Bringing on the counter revolution
For most countertop materials — whether the ubiquitous plastic laminate 
(known to most people by its brand name, Formica) or designer tile — wiping 
up with warm water and an all-purpose cleaner, such as those presented in 
Chapter 3, is all it takes to keep them clean.
Keep the following caveats in mind:
 
 If you have a wood countertop (which, depending on the source, may or 
may not be green), avoid vinegar-based cleaning solutions.

266
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 If you have a granite, marble, or stone countertop, mild dish soap and 
water is the best for cleaning. Keep in mind, though, that granite and 
marble can be fussy — they don’t like harsh solutions or even highly 
acidic food spills and are sensitive to heat, so use trivets and hot pads 
to protect counters (a good idea for any countertop regardless of type).
 
 If you have a solid surface counter top, such as Corian or Silestone, use 
an all-purpose cleaner or 4 tablespoons of baking soda in 1 quart of warm 
water, apply with a sponge and dry. Do not use abrasive cleaners or tools.
Hot tips for cleaning stoves
The green way to eliminate oven grease and other cooktop grime is to use a 
lot of elbow grease along with some traditional cleaning agents. You can also 
employ a few other tactics to pre-empt some of the buildup:
 
 Avoid or limit cooking practices that increase grease and grime. Deep-
frying meat is a major gunk-producer.
 
 Install a cooktop backsplash, such as ceramic or glass tile, that you can 
wipe clean with soap and water.
 
 Use an all-purpose cleaner for the cooktop, whether one of the recipes 
in Chapter 3 or an on-the-shelf green product, all-purpose or specially 
formulated for the stove.
 
 Don’t use abrasive pads on glass or ceramic cooktops.
 
 Clean removable parts (racks, grates, and grate pans) to wash in the 
sink or dishwasher, as necessary.
 
 For grease stains, dampen the spot with water and cover with baking 
soda or cornstarch — both natural grease absorbers. Give it some time 
to work and then rinse off with water and wipe dry.
 
 From the inside of the oven, remove the racks and clean in the sink with 
soap, water, and a scrub brush. Baking racks can get pretty filthy, so 
consider taking them outside and rinsing off with the garden hose.
 
 While the oven is still slightly warm, cover baked-on food with table 
salt. After it cools, scrape away the salt and spills and wipe with a damp 
sponge.
 
 Prevent spills in the oven by using the proper size of baking pan or cook-
ware. If your food is likely to bubble or spill over, place a larger pan or 
cookie sheet underneath to catch the overflow. Washing one pan in the 
sink or dishwasher is much easier than scrubbing the inside of your oven.
 
Many modern ovens have a self-cleaning feature (no chemicals necessary): 
Essentially, it burns off the spills so that you can easily wipe out the remains. 
Check your manufacturer’s guidelines for use.

The Ins and Outs of Refrigerator 
Cleaning
The refrigerator consumes the most energy of any indoor home appliance — 
more than the washer and dryer combined. It probably doesn’t help that it’s 
also one of the most frequented places in the home! A constant open-and-close 
of the door adds dollars to your electric bill and increases opportunity for 
bacteria growth, for food inside as well as the door handle, which is a bacteria 
magnet.
A cleaning tip to reduce your utility bill
How you clean your refrigerator can also affect your monthly energy costs. 
Take a peek at the back of the fridge, and you see a rack-like attachment — 
those are the condenser coils, and they’re a magnet for dust bunnies, pet 
hair, and lint. Just as the human heart has to pump harder for the overweight 
person, the refrigerator motor must exert more effort when its coils are 
coated and clogged with dirt.
A good brushing every couple of months makes your refrigerator more 
efficient. But take some precaution when cleaning. First, follow any special 
instructions from the manufacturer. Unplug the unit and then use your vacu-
um’s crevice tool or a coil-cleaning brush. Hardware and home supply stores 
also sell appliance brushes for this purpose.
Purging and cleaning the fridge
To clean the inside of the fridge, toss any food gone bad and remove the 
remaining food items. Then, using a top-down approach, start cleaning with 
the top shelf, wiping with a sponge or rag and a bucket of warm water and 
dish soap or warm water and baking soda mixture, and work your way down. 
Finish with a good wipe-down of the outside — don’t forget the door handle.
Several times a year, remove the glass shelves and the drawers (for deli, 
meat, fruit, and vegetables) and clean in the sink using hot, sudsy water, 
rinse well, drain, and dry before putting them back in the refrigerator.
 
After the refrigerator is sparkling clean, add a box of baking soda, opened up 
to absorb odors. You can certainly use one of the baking soda air filters, with 
a replacement indicator shows when you need to change it out. But why, 
when a small box of the real stuff is so cheap and easy to use? (Less packag-
ing and plastic means less energy and resources expended).

268
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
To plug or unplug the refrigerator and freezer for an exhaustive deep clean-
ing is a choice you’ll have to make based on the condition of the appliance 
and what the manufacturer says.
Keeping Small Appliances Clean
Microwave ovens, toasters, blenders, mixers — if your kitchen is like most, 
you have a cadre of small devices that assist with food preparation, often get-
ting a daily workout. These appliances, depending upon their specific 
service, need cleaning daily or frequently.
Many appliances contain parts that you can remove from the motor. In these 
cases, treat the components as you do your dishes and cookware and wash 
by hand or in the dishwasher. Always be sure to unplug the devices before 
cleaning and follow these tips for specific appliances:
 
 Microwave ovens: All-purpose or glass cleaner works fine for the outside. 
Wipe the inside with a green all-purpose cleaner or liquid soap and water 
and dry thoroughly. Wipe the glass turntable often and put in the dish-
washer when needed. Depending on the buildup you get, you may want to 
use a baking soda or cornstarch paste.
 
 Toasters and toaster ovens: Unplug before cleaning with a glass or all-
purpose cleaner on the outside. Turn upside-down and dump out the 
crumbs into the sink. Clean the counter underneath.
 
 Blenders: Wash the container portion after every use. One method is 
to pour soapy water in and turn on the blender — some models have a 
dedicated button for this function. You can also remove the container-
and-blade portion, take it apart, and then wash pieces separately by 
hand or in the dishwasher. Wipe down the base with soap and water or 
a mild all-purpose cleaner. Clean the counter underneath.
 
 The blades can cut you, so watch your hands.
 
 Mixers: The beaters go in the dishwasher or sink. Wipe the base with 
soap and water or an all-purpose cleaner. Large, stand-on-the-counter 
models should be cleaned as recommended by the maker. You can 
hand-wash stainless steel bowls or put them in the dishwasher.
 
 Coffee makers: Check the manufacturer’s instructions. As a rule, simply 
wipe down drip coffee makers with soap and water or mild cleaner. You 
can wash the coffee pot in the sink or dishwasher.

Getting Wise to Preemptive 
Practices in Bathrooms
You can avert, postpone, or minimized major cleanup by incorporating some 
healthy bathroom habits. The bonus? Changing some of your most basic 
hygiene practices can go a long way in reducing germs and other unwelcome 
problems.
 
Close the lid on toilet spray. I’m not talking about the gender war between 
“seat up or seat down,” but keeping the bowl covered — most especially 
before you flush. Shut the lid and then flush. Thus, whatever is in there stays 
there (kind of like Vegas). Some toilets have a powerful force. Even if you 
can’t see any spray, you can trust that those bacteria are flying and landing in 
the area, on the cabinet next to the toilet and perhaps even on the sink ledge 
where your toothbrush sits.
Diving into the no-flush policy debate
Understanding that the toilet is the home’s biggest water hog, is it responsible 
to flush after every visit? What a dilemma for a person who wants to be clean 
and green. Fact is, leaving an unflushed toilet — even if only fluid waste — 
allows time for bacteria-breeding, but every flush consumes as many as 7 
gallons of water in older toilets.
If you’re living with older-model toilets or in an area that suffers from water 
shortage, “let it mellow,” as they say. But only for a few hours: Or from your 
last visit at night until your wakeup stop in the morning. If only one or two 
members of the household are using a particular john, a “reduced-flush” 
policy is probably manageable. Several household members using a single 
toilet, on the other hand, may require more frequent flushing.
 
And if you’re flushing less often, you want to clean more frequently. One 
tip is to keep a gallon of white distilled vinegar under the sink and pour a 
quarter-cup or so into the bowl or tank every other day.
Spending 20 seconds on your hands
In every restaurant restroom, you find a sign that admonishes all employees 
to wash their hands before returning to their work. Wouldn’t you be horrified 
if you saw your waitperson or chef coming out of a stall and marching right 
back into the dining room or kitchen?

270
Book III: Green Cleaning 
Research continues to prove how effective soap and warm water are at killing 
disease-carrying germs and reducing illness. Hand-washing is especially 
mportant in the bathroom.
 
Reduce opportunities to spread germs on surfaces from dirty hands: Put a 
waste can with a pedal opener in the bathroom. You can also install pedal-
operated water faucets if you wanted to take it to the next level.
Running the fan
Moisture from showering and washing lingers in the air, promoting the 
growth of mold and mildew over time. A musty odor is the least of the 
problems: Some forms of mold can aggravate and cause allergies, and they 
can spread throughout the infrastructure and framework of the home. In 
some rare cases, homeowners have had to tear out large areas of the house.
Signs of humidity problems are easy to see or smell. You may spot moisture 
stains on walls and ceilings, discover the gray tentacles of mildew spreading 
in your shower grout, or find whitish, powdery mildew on fabric or furniture 
in or near your bathroom.
 
A working bathroom fan does a lot more than remove unpleasant odors; it 
provides needed ventilation and air circulation in a wet, enclosed space. 
Turn it on as soon as you turn on the shower and keep it on at least ten 
minutes after you’ve finished your shower. If the bathroom is an interior 
room with no windows for air circulation, run it longer.
Other tips for reducing humidity and risk of mildew and mold:
 
 Leave the shower curtain or door open after your shower so that the 
bath area can dry.
 
 Keep the bathroom door open after showering or bathing.
 
 For rooms that get little circulation and seem to develop mildew quickly, 
a dehumidifier may help suck moisture from the air. There’s an energy 
cost attached, but the payoff may be worth the effort.
 
 Verify that your exhaust fan is connected correctly so that the air is 
forced outside of the house and not blasted into the attic or another 
area of the house. Have your ducts checked.
 
 Make sure that windows are well sealed: Cold air leaking into the house 
exacerbates condensation and humidity problems. Replace worn weath-
erstripping around windows.
For advice on removing mildew and mold from shower walls and bathroom 
surfaces, see the next section of this chapter.

nent damage to your home or your health. To find certified contractors who

Cleaning the Bath from Top to Bottom
While the bathroom poses some cleaning challenges, its major surfaces are 
fairly straightforward in terms of cleaning: Start with the least germy and 
easiest to clean places (mirrors and sinks), working your way from fixture to 
fixture toward the dirtiest (the toilet) area, and then finally tackle the floor.
Choosing safe, effective cleaning formulas
Bathrooms are a tough clean, to be sure, but don’t be oversold on the super-
duper germ-obliterators that the commercials insist you need. Manufacturers 
rarely list the ingredients on the label. But you know you’re in trouble when 
you see warnings such as “Danger,” “Warning,” “Corrosive.”
 
The safest and greenest course of action is to steer clear of these heavy 
hitters and stick to the recipes included in Chapter 3 or buy commercial 
products that identify themselves as plant-based. Don’t assume that you’re 
green to go just because the bottle says “nontoxic,” “all-natural,” or “biode-
gradable.” These terms aren’t regulated.
Gathering the best cleaning tools
You won’t need to grab many cleaning tools from your utility closet. Your 
toilet brush is already in place, perhaps in an attractive brush holder sitting 
unobtrusively behind the commode. (Some of the brush holders I’ve seen — 
even in the big box stores such as Target and Lowes — are decorative 
elements in their own right.) You can keep a pumice under the sink to deal 
with toilet bowl stains as needed. But otherwise, a bucket, a squirt bottle 
filled with green cleaner, and lots of cleaning cloths ought to do the job.
For tough mildew stains in the sink or tub areas, you’ll need a scrub brush or 
an old toothbrush for the grout. (For more tips on gathering your equipment, 
see Chapter 2.)

272
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
Be liberal with the number of cloths you use to avoid spreading germs from 
one surface to another. Clean more benign surfaces, such as the mirror and 
sink, first. Drop the used cloths in a bucket or laundry basket and then grab 
clean ones for the next task, whether tub or shower. When it comes to the 
toilet, change cloths often. Clean the bowl and the underside of the toilet seat 
first then deposit the dirty rag in the used pile. Then grab a fresh cloth for 
the seat itself, and another for the lid, tank, or handle.
 
Identify certain cloths solely for toilet cleaning — perhaps repurpose the 
splashy red beach towel that’s seen better days, cutting it up into workable 
squares. That way, you can easily identify these as toilet rags and keep them 
separate from your other rags.
Taking a look at the mirror
The glass cleaner recipes s included in Chapter 3 or store-bought green 
formulas are good for cleaning bathroom mirrors. Spray and wipe with a 
microfiber cloth made for glass. If you use a cleaning cloth from your rag pile, 
choose a lint-free material.
For splatters of toothpaste, soap, or cosmetics, you may want to spot-wipe 
with a damp cloth and a little liquid soap, if necessary.
Newspaper is the traditional favorite for streak-free mirrors and glass. But 
some people object to the mess the ink makes on your hands or are irritated 
by the chemically smell of the inked paper. That said, yesterday’s news is 
certainly an environmentally friendly way to clean glass. The soy-based inks 
of the black-and-white pages (don’t use the comics or the shiny color adver-
tising inserts) are benign, and, in fact, organic gardeners recommend their 
use in composting and layering under soil to prevent weeds.
Bringing sparkle to the sink
The sink and vanity area of the bathroom sees plenty of traffic. A routine 
wipe-down with a gentle cleaner is a good practice for keeping up with the 
daily toothpaste buildup and soap scum that accumulates. Whether the sink 
is made of porcelain, stainless steel, a synthetic material, or glass, a basic 
all-purpose cleaner should make short work of sink and faucet grime.
Use one of the recipes included in Chapter 3 or a good green general 
product to kill germs and shine sink surfaces and chrome fixtures to a gleam. 
For polished brass and other types of faucets, follow the manufacturer’s 
instructions, but most gentle, all-purpose cleaners are fine.

273
 Chapter 5: Bringing Kitchens and Baths to a Green-Clean Sheen
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
Use extra elbow grease, however, if you’re cleaning a vanity area used for 
hairstyling. Hairspray tends to leave a sticky coating on sinks and counter-
top, but a vinegar cleaner ought to do the trick. Grab a sponge with a scrubby 
side for especially tacky buildup or soap scum.
 
Steer clear of abrasive formulas or scrub brushes for most materials to avoid 
scratching or damage. And never use conventional toilet bowl cleaners for 
sinks, tubs, or shower areas: The chemicals in these products are too harsh 
and may ruin the materials.
Rubbing the tub and scouring the shower
When it comes to cleaning the tub and shower area, the materials you’re 
most likely to be dealing with are prefabricated tub-and-shower surrounds 
made of polyester and acrylic, or vitreous porcelain, stainless steel, tile, or 
stone. Most easily stand up to the basic all-purpose formulas included in 
Chapter 3, with a few exceptions.
Here are some tips for most bath and shower cleaning:
 
 Use an all-purpose cleaner to wipe away grime on bath surfaces and 
fixtures.
 
 For soap, lime, and scale buildup, bring in the vinegar. Soak your 
cleaning cloth and rub away on tile, porcelain, and chrome fixtures.
 
 Clean glass shower doors with the same cleaner you use on mirrors.
 
 If you have a clogged-up showerhead, simply remove it and let it soak 
overnight in a bucket with water and vinegar, at a 1-to-1 ratio. Rinse and 
put back on.
 
 To reduce soap buildup on glass doors, wipe them down with a 
squeegee after each shower.
 
 Battle mildew with hydrogen peroxide.
 
 Avoid steel wool, scrub brushes, scrub pads, and abrasive cleaners on 
any bath surfaces — they’re just too harsh for the materials and can 
scratch and damage them.
Some shower and tub materials pose more challenges than others. Stainless 
steel is prone to dings and scratches. Stone and marble may require special 
care. And tile, while in itself a breeze to keep clean, the stuff that holds it 
together — grout — is something else. Sometimes it seems like mildew is 
holding the tiles together.

274
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
A hand-held steam cleaner is handy for cleaning grout. Another approach is 
rubbing a paste of baking soda or borax on the grout, let it dry, and then wet 
and remove with a soft-bristled toothbrush.
Toilet talk
Be diligent about keeping the toilet area clean. Getting your household into 
the habit of closing the lid before flushing and washing their hands helps 
reduce the risk of spreading bacteria, but routine cleaning of the toilet — at 
least once a week — is necessary to flush out the germs.
In most cases, a non-abrasive all-purpose cleaner works well for cleaning the 
outside of the toilet, tank, lid, seat, and bowl. Choose from the cleaners in 
Chapter 3 or a commercial green product. Vinegar-based solutions help kill 
bacteria. After cleaning your toilet, remember to immediately set aside cloths 
for the wash and not use them on any other surface.
If you poured your toilet bowl cleaner first thing as you started your bath-
room clean, you’ve got a head start on a tough job. Ingredients for bowl 
cleaners are stronger than those used for the other bathroom surfaces.
 
Let the cleaner sit in the toilet for at least 10 minutes. For a really grungy 
bowl, pour in a cup of borax, which acts as a water softener, sanitizer, and 
deodorizer, and let it sit overnight. Then swish and scrub with the toilet 
brush. Don’t neglect the area you can’t see just under the rim inside the 
toilet — where ugly mildew really collects. Tackle stains with pumice, 
wearing plastic gloves to protect your hands. Then scrub, close the lid, 
and flush.
 
When using conventional cleaners with caustic chemicals, be especially 
careful not to splash when pouring in the cleaner. Ammonia, bleach, lye, and 
other ingredients can burn your skin and eyes. Even commercially available 
green toilet bowl cleaners have cautions.
After the inside of the bowl is clean, you’re ready to give the outside of the 
toilet — lid, seat, tank — a good wipe-down with your preferred all-purpose 
cleaner. Don’t forget to clean the handle!

Getting to the bottom of floor cleaning
Bathroom floors tend to be of the same types of materials as other bathroom 
surfaces: those that stand up well to water and clean with a wipe of a sponge. 
The other good news is, as a rule, bathroom floors aren’t as big as in other 
areas of the house, so keeping up with the floor cleaning doesn’t take much 
more effort than a quick zip-through with the mop. After all the above-floor sur-
faces are cleaned, vacuum the floor to pick up loose hair and dust. Then clean 
with water and a floor cleaner best-suited for your floor type. In most cases, 
any of the all-purpose cleaners or commercial green cleaners are fine. But do 
follow the manufacturer’s guidelines when choosing a cleaning product.
Other options include
 
 A store-bought mop system. Most include an ergonomically shaped mop 
with washable microfiber head and a gentle squirt-and-mop formula, no 
buckets of water required.
 
 An electric steam cleaner — skip the cleaning formula altogether. Just 
use water and steam, a great solution for tile and sealed wood floors. 
Lightweight models heat up in 60 seconds or less, and, with swivel 
heads, they can reach those corners and hard-to-reach spaces, such as 
behind the toilet. (For more on steam cleaners, see Chapter 2.)

ll the activity and traffic that goes on in living rooms (or family rooms, 
great rooms, and so on) can mean only one thing to the homeowner: 
a whole lotta cleaning. The flip side of that coin is the bedroom, a sanctuary 
that few visitors see but that certainly you have good reason to want spic-
and-span. (A third of your life takes place there, after all.) And getting to a 
whole-house clean starts outside your home.
No matter what its function, any place your family spends its time must be as 
safe and clean as possible. This chapter shows you how to maintain healthy 
spaces throughout your home
Making a Green Entrance
Whether you enter from the formal front door, sneak in the side entrance or 
garage into the mudroom, or track through a sunroom from the backyard, 
your homes entry points connect your inside space to your outside space — 
which means that one way or another, plenty of dirt gets tracked in. But each 
transitional area is used in different ways and demands unique attention.

278
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
Leaving shoes at the door goes a long way to keep outside dirt from working 
its way across your floors. Stock slippers or house shoes so that you and 
your guests can tread lightly in your home.
Crossing the energy threshold: Doors
Which door in your home sees the most traffic? Whether front, back, or side, 
give this entrance special attention in terms of weatherproofing. Make sure 
that the door shuts easily and properly and adjust as necessary to stop the 
energy leaks.
Cleaning your home’s doors is a half-inside, half-outside job. The outside 
work requires, no surprise, a little more elbow grease as it gets battered with 
rain, mud, pet paw prints, and the occasional kick from an impatient kid. 
Unless the manufacturer specifies some unusual cleaning procedure, you can 
almost always handle the job — inside and out — with a basic all-purpose 
spray and a cleaning rag.
A storm door reduces the need to clean your entry door. You can clean 
storm and sliding glass doors as you would any window, with a little vinegar 
and a lint-free cloth, newspaper, or squeegee.
 
Wash the glass on a cloudy day to reduce streaking. (Sun dries the solution 
faster than you can buff it in.) For windows that have been cleaned with com-
mercial window solutions, you may need to mix in a little liquid detergent 
with your vinegar and water to cut the buildup. (See Chapter 3 to find green 
glass-cleaning recipes.)
Putting out the welcome mat
The welcome mat is more than an expression of hospitality to guests. 
Doormats inside and outside entry doors save cleaning time. Mats on the 
outside of the door are typically of a more rugged material, often a bristly 
brushlike texture that’s great for catching grass, mud, and other gunk you 
don’t want tracked into your home.
Inside doormats don’t have to work as hard as the outdoor mats, unless you 
have kids, spouses, or friends who have to be reminded to wipe their feet. 
For both inside and outside, doormats come in several ecomaterials:
 
 Coir mats are made from coconut husk fiber. These thickly woven 
mats are extremely durable and repel insects naturally. They’re not 
recommended for outdoors, however, unless on a well-covered porch.

279
 Chapter 6: Working Outside In for a Clean and Green Home

 Flip flop doormats are made from — you guessed it — recycled rubber 
flip-flop material culled from the scraps on the manufacturing floor. 
They’re available through many sources online and start at $20. Simply 
wash down with a hose whenever called for.
 
 Rubber doormats are made from recycled car tires. Some of these 
brands are manufactured in the United States, so you’re not adding to 
the energy cost of the doormat. Mats vary in price, anywhere from $25 
to more than $100, based on size.
 
 Jute, seagrass, sisal, and hemp rugs are sold through environmentally 
oriented catalog companies, as well as some of the big box and home 
stores. Just shake to loosen soil, vacuum, and wipe clean with a damp 
sponge. Expect to find these mats in the $30-and-up range, although 
they’re sometimes less.
Rolling Out the Green Carpet
Carpet, whether area rugs or wall to wall, can be a good choice for living or 
bedroom areas. But it also presents issues both green and clean. You can 
resolve most challenges, however, with a little know-how.
Calling pests and pets on the carpet
A particular challenge with wall-to-wall carpeting is its propensity for harbor-
ing irritants that cause health problems. Dirt, dust, mold, and other allergens 
find carpeting just as cozy as humans do:
 
 Dust mites: Just as they do in bed sheets, pillows, and fabrics in the 
bedroom, dust mites are likely to burrow into your floor cover and leave 
their asthma-provoking droppings in your living room.
 
 Carpet beetles: Wool carpeting, along with leather and wood fiber, is a 
favorite feast of both the varied carpet beetle and black carpet beetle. 
Once they get into your home, they can attack carpeting as if it were an 
all-you-can-eat buffet. Prevent infestations with frequent vacuuming. Once 
they settle in, they’re hard to get rid of and may destroy the carpet.
 
 Read Carpet Cleaning Tips For Dummies by Elizabeth B. Goldsmith for 
more detail about carpet beetles.
 
 Pet odors and stains: In addition to pet hair and dander, your beloved 
four-legged family members are as likely as small children to have “acci-
dents” on carpeting — and these messes do the same damage. Carpeting 
seems to be a sponge for pet odors; more often than not, you can easily 
pick out the dog’s favorite nap corner simply by smell.

280
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 Mildew and mold: Anything from a spill to a pet accident to a humid 
house can result in carpet mold and mildew. (You can usually smell or 
see mildew and mold.) Once it takes hold, the best cure is to toss the 
carpet and the pad.
Cleaning and caring for carpeting
 
The best defense against carpet challenges is prevention: Vacuum regularly, 
keep carpeting dry, and discourage pets from sleeping directly on the floor. 
Dogs should have their own beds and area rugs.
For regular maintenance of any carpeting, a good vacuum cleaner is best for 
the job. A machine with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter removes 
tiny particles, such as pollens, dust, and, dander, relieving those who suffer 
from common allergens. A vacuum with a CRI (Carpet and Rug Institute) Seal 
of Approval/Green Label passes many tests on soil removal, carpet texture 
retention, and dust containment. CRI-approved vacuums must not release 
more than 100 micrograms of dust particles per cubic meter of air.
Getting out common stains and spills
Quick action can save you from massive cleanup jobs or hiring the profes-
sionals. Don’t ever let a stain set. Address it as soon as you spot it by follow-
ing these steps:
 
1. Absorb the spill with a dry cloth or paper towel and vacuum up solids 
(such as spilled soil from a plant or food crumbs) or pick up larger 
pieces with a towel.
 
2. Wipe or blot with a cloth saturated with a one-part-vinegar and one-
part-water mix to neutralize the smell.
 
3. Treat or spot-clean the stain with plain water applied with a sponge or 
cloth.
 
 Blot; don’t scrub.
 
4. If the stain is stubborn, try adding a little dishwashing liquid.
 
 For treating specific stains, such as blood, ink, or wine, see Chapter 4.
 
5. Blot-dry with a clean cloth and allow to air-dry.
 
Never use laundry detergent with bleach to remove carpet stains. Refer to the 
cleaning instructions from the carpet manufacturer for specific treatment.

Making time for a deep cleaning
When carpeting begins to show a traffic pattern, it’s a sign that a deeper 
cleaning may be due. Most carpeting requires a deep-clean every year or two, 
depending upon the wear the room sees.
Rather than resorting to harsh carpet cleaners, which contain the same kinds 
of toxic components that some carpet materials do, limit your deep-clean to 
a steam-vacuum process, sometimes referred to as extraction cleaning. The 
steam seeps deeper into the carpet, knocking the heck out of dust mites and 
picking up embedded dirt. If you don’t own a steam cleaner, you can find 
them for rent from many grocery stores.
 
If you want a thorough clean but don’t want to hassle with moving furniture 
and renting a steam vacuum, consider a carpet-cleaning service. These services 
use a variety of techniques, including chemicals, but most often they stick to 
deep steam-cleaning. For information about services in your area, the Institute 
of Inspection, Cleaning, and Restorations Certification (IICRC) represents more 
than 4,500 Certified Firms and more than 45,000 Certified Technicians in 30 
countries. You can visit its Web site at www.certifiedcleaners.org.
Living with pets
If your cat, dog, rabbit, ferret, bird, snake, or 
(gulp!) tarantula has the run of the house, these 
tips are sure to help you keep a leash on your 
home’s cleanliness and show your pet who’s in 
charge:
  Wash the pet bed or favorite blanket weekly. 
If your dog or cat sleeps on your bed, wash 
the bedding more frequently. If fleas or dust 
mites are a concern (and they always are), 
wash in hot water.
  Discourage your pet from sleeping or sitting 
directly on upholstery. If you can’t persuade 
Mitzy or Bruno to give up the couch, put down 
a blanket to keep your furniture from wearing 
and taking on a permanent pet odor.
  If possible, steer clear of skirting on sofas 
and chairs. It can take a lot of wear, what 
with dogs rubbing up against it or cats slip-
ping under the couch to hide.
  Try to keep pets corralled in one or two 
areas of the house and keep other rooms 
off-limits. Restricting your pets’ roam area 
reduces the amount of special cleaning 
attention you have to exert.
  Get your pets to follow the same rule as 
everyone else: “Wipe your paws before 
you come in!” Be sure a good doormat is 
at the entrances they use and give them a 
little help. Keep an old towel by the door so 
that you can wipe muddy paws before they 
head inside and jump on the couch.
  If your pet insists on communing with nature 
on a regular basis, weekly baths may be a 
good idea.
  Both dogs and cats benefit from regular 
brushing, which reduces the amount of pet 
hair that ends up on your couch and carpet.

Upholstery: The Great Furniture Coverup
Most living room furniture — at least the stuff you sit on — is padded for 
comfort and covered, or upholstered, with fabric. Use the following tips to 
keep that fabric clean and looking good:
 
 Remove pillows and cushions and vacuum with the crevice tool, reach-
ing into the dark recesses to suck up popcorn kernels along with all the 
detritus that gets lost under the cushions.
 
 Use the upholstery nozzle to go over the cushions. Fluff or punch them 
to shape up the stuffing, and set them back in place.
 
 Take care of spots or stains as soon as possible, following the manu-
facturer’s guidelines. If you don’t want to use the offensive chemical 
cleaner recommended, try baking soda and the tiniest bit of water to 
pull it out.
 
 Do not wash or soak the fabric: You may end up with a permanent water 
stain and get the stuffing wet, which can lead to mildew or mold.
 
 With natural cushion materials (feathers or wool), fluff daily — but don’t 
overdo it.
Zen and the Art of Dusting
That near-invisible whisper of sediment that’s equally happy to settle on 
houseplants, coffee tables, valuable artwork, or electronics is dust made up 
of things like pollen, lint, pet hair and dander, and teeny particles of dirt that 
drift in from outdoors or from room to room. Your living room collects more 
or less dust, depending on the activities inside and outside of your home, the 
inhabitants, and the air flow.
Because it’s light, dust floats around in the air until it settles on surfaces like 
tables and floors. You want to minimize dust inside because you don’t want 
to breathe it. Air or vacuum filters or a dust mop or cloth are the devices 
typically used to capture dust and remove it from the home environment.
Walking the labyrinth of dusting
Tables and other flat surfaces covered with knick knacks are useful for col-
lecting dust and keeping it off the carpet or other fabrics so that dust mites 
and other vermin don’t settle in.

283
 Chapter 6: Working Outside In for a Clean and Green Home
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
The last thing you want to do is whisk all that dust to the floor. Dusting is 
a mindful activity — not a mindless one. And here’s a mindful approach to 
follow:
 
 Make a microfiber cloth or a lint-free piece of fabric from your rag pile, 
your partner in dusting. (Read Chapter 2 for the inside story on microfi-
ber and its role in cleaning.)
 
 Skip the feather duster or any other aid that does nothing more than 
move dust from one place to another, stirring up irritants.
 
 As a backup — and especially if you can’t reach the ceiling — have a 
vacuum cleaner with an extension tool on hand, too.
 
 If you want, you can use a cleaning product or dampen your cleaning 
cloth just slightly so that more dust clings to the cloth. (Read Chapter 3 
for cleaning recipes for dusting.) But, remember, the act of rubbing, not 
the cleaning solution, is what picks up and traps the dust. Spray that 
table all day, and it’s not going to eat away the dust.
 
 Start dusting from top to bottom, making a circle around the room.
 
 Continue to change dust cloths frequently. As soon as one appears to 
have been grayed by a film of dust and cobwebs, exchange it for a clean 
one. Hey, you’re not using throwaways, but even though using a new 
cloth increases your wash load, it’s important to have clean cloths.
 
 Continue your circle around the room, hitting the next highest level and 
then moving lower.
Attending to the details
Each section of the room and piece of furniture deserves special attention. 
Consider this approach:
 
 Ceiling: With a vacuum and a long attachment, pick up the cobwebs 
clinging to the ceiling corners. You can use an old-fashioned ceiling 
broom if you prefer.
 
 Walls: Dust walls the same way as you would the ceiling. No direct spray 
is needed on the surface, but if you want to use a product, spray lightly 
into the cloth and wipe down. This procedure is fine for both painted 
and wallpapered surfaces. (If the wallpaper is special, particularly old, 
or hand-painted, seek advice from experts for the best way to clean.)
 
 Ceiling fans, ceiling light fixtures, and floor and table lamps: For 
safety, turn off the lights, lamps, and ceiling fans before cleaning.
 
 Artwork and framed items: To avoid damage to unprotected artwork if 
you’re using a cleaner, spray the dust cloth with the cleaner rather than 
spraying it directly on the picture frame.

284
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 Books: Again, if using a product, spray the cloth, not the item, and use 
any liquid sparingly when wiping down book covers.
 
 Mirrors and glass: You can use a microfiber cloth made expressly for 
glass or opt for a newspaper. A vinegar-and-water solution or one of the 
other recipes in Chapter 3 works well to capture dust on glass. (Pass up 
the ammonia-based commercial cleaners because of their toxicity.)
 
 Wood furniture: If you like a little bit of polish, or even scent, blend 
a few drops of a citrus essential oil and a few drops of olive oil — you 
don’t need much. Dip your dust cloth in the solution and rub furniture 
to a sheen.
 
 Plants: Use your dust cloth or take them outside to clean. Also, keep 
an eye out for moldy soil (gray on the top) and change it. Skip the leaf-
shining sprays, which may emit VOCs.
Keeping electronics dust-free
Dust is a detriment to electronics: Just look what happens when you get 
a bit stuck on a DVD or CD. When cleaning your living room, you can dust 
electronics the same as you dust other furniture and items. But leave out the 
fluid cleaners or water.
Most electronics cleaners — including computer monitor sprays and DVD 
cleaners — contain elements that you’d prefer not to spray in your home if 
you’re concerned about indoor air quality. Problem is, you don’t have many 
options for cleaning stuck-on gunk.
Start with a purpose-designed microfiber or other cloth. You can find these 
in office-supply and electronics stores. Sometimes a good rub-down does the 
trick. If not, you may have to resort to the cleaner. To reduce your environ-
mental impact, try to use a spray product with a reusable cloth rather than 
the disposable, single-use wipes.
Here are some more tips for cleaning electronic equipment:
 
 Turn off computer and TV monitors before cleaning.
 
 Avoid using water or excess liquid cleaner on electronics.
 
 Gently brush away loose dust before wiping a monitor to scrub off gunk, 
lest you scratch the screen by scrubbing in a hard piece of dirt.
 
 Clean LCD monitors with more care than glass-fronted CRT monitors. 
They can be scratched or damaged more easily. Use a soft cloth and, if 
necessary, a spray formulated for LCD monitors.
 
 Unless otherwise advised by the manufacturer, gentle green solutions, 
such as vinegar and water, are probably fine for most electronics.

285
 Chapter 6: Working Outside In for a Clean and Green Home
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
 Most cleaning products recommended by manufacturers aren’t likely 
to be green. Some even come in aerosol cans. But unless you can verify 
that another cleaning solution can be substituted, it may be best to stick 
to the recommendation.
 
 Computer keyboards seem to collect a lot of crumbs: While the com-
puter is off, turn the keyboard over and shake the loose debris. An old 
toothbrush or a cleaned and dried old mascara wand gets between the 
keys to remove whatever hasn’t shaken out.
A Green Well-Lighted Space: Windows
Rare is a living space without windows. Although I have seen them, a room 
without windows is claustrophobic and undesirable. Home is a haven from 
the outside world, yes, but it’s also your window to the world around you, 
whether rolling fields, dense forest, or urban skyline.
Enjoying the view: Keeping windows clean
A clean window is an energy-efficient window, letting in more light. Window 
sills and frames seem to attract dirt more so than many surfaces in your 
home. Dust on and around the window as you dust everything else in the 
living room, either vacuuming the loose stuff or hand-dusting.
 
Don’t forget the outside views, too. The glass and frame get dirtier, what 
with the elements, car exhaust, and outdoor activity of bugs and birds. The 
outside sill may require a heavy scrubbing. Arm yourself with a stronger all-
purpose cleaner and a damp sponge to attack it.
You can keep all your glass clean with a window cleaner made of vinegar and 
water. Look for this recipe and other glass cleaners in Chapter 3.
Choosing and cleaning drapes and blinds
When it comes to window treatments, the green home designer faces sev-
eral dilemmas: While window coverings can enhance energy-saving efforts, 
they’re often made of undesirable materials (blinds of plastic and vinyl, 
draperies covered with toxic fabric finishes), and many serve as a magnet for 
dust mites and other harbingers of allergy misery and respiratory woe. If you 
opt for window treatments, here are a few of the greener options, along with 
cleaning advice:

286
Book III: Green Cleaning 
 
 Heavy draperies provide a high insulative quality, keeping the room 
warm in cold weather and blocking solar gain when it’s hot. Seek draper-
ies made of natural, unfinished material; linen, cotton, and some wools 
and silks are machine washable, so you can avoid the cost and chemi-
cals associated with dry cleaning.
 
 Honeycomb shades are fabric coverings that fit snugly within the 
window frame. Their cell-like construction traps air, which provides 
extra insulation. The more opaque the shades, the better job they do of 
keeping out the temperature and solar gain. The fabric may be of syn-
thetic content and treated with finishes that repel dust and dirt. Dust 
or vacuum regularly to prevent dirt buildup. Use a damp cloth and mild 
detergent for spot cleaning.
 
 Traditional horizontal aluminum or plastic slat blinds provide some insu-
lation — but vertical blinds add little insulative value. Blinds can be dusted 
and vacuumed. Special brushes with “fingers” are available, though far from 
necessary to do a good cleaning job. Clean with damp cloth and mild solu-
tion or remove the entire assembly and stick it in the bathtub.
 
 Indoor shutters and blinds made of wood, are better for blocking heat 
than for lending insulation value. Clean wood or bamboo blinds or shut-
ters as other wood furniture: Simply dust with a dry or slightly damp 
cloth or use a wood cleaner.
Cleaning the Fireplace: Ashes to Ashes
The more they’re used, the more soot and ash fireplaces produce. And 
because the material can drift like dust into other areas of your home, you 
want to keep on top of it.
When you’re ready for a seasonal clean, get ready for one dirty job and follow 
these steps:
 
1. Make sure that the fire is completely out before you attempt to clean 
the fireplace.
 
 Cleaning out a place that contains frequent fires requires caution, how-
ever. Avoid cleaning out the fireplace if a fire has burned recently. Wait 
two days after the last use.
 
2. Close windows and doors to prevent any drafts from blowing around 
the ashes and soot.
 
3. Don an apron or work shirt, eye goggles, gloves, and a mask to avoid 
getting stirred-up ashes in your eyes or breathing passages.
 
4. Using your fireplace tool or another scoop, shovel all the ashes into a 
bucket.

287
 Chapter 6: Working Outside In for a Clean and Green Home
Book III
Green 
Cleaning
 
 Carry the bucket outside before dumping to minimize floating soot. 
(Wood ash may be a great addition to your compost pile if your soil 
leans toward the acidic end of the pH spectrum.)
 
5. Vacuum up the remaining ash in the fireplace.
 
 Never vacuum within two days of burning a fire in the fireplace, or 
attempt to vacuum all the ash. Most vacuums aren’t capable of handling 
that volume of debris. Be aware of outdoor conditions and warnings 
from fire departments of extremely dry conditions.
 
6. (Optional) If you want to take it to the next level, you can wash out the 
fireplace with water and a mild soap.
 
 On the walls outside the fireplace, brick can take a tougher scrubbing 
than adobe and stucco, or wallboard, which can be treated as you would 
your interior walls. With most stone, marble, slate, tile, and cement — 
baking soda and water is a safe choice.
 
7. Clean the grates, irons, and fireplace accessories.
 
 Like grilling tools, you can take the fireplace accessories outside and 
hose them down with soap and water or an all-purpose cleaner. If your 
accessories are brass, polish them with a solution of lemon juice, baking 
soda, and water and dry with a soft cloth.
 
Hiring a chimney sweep to clean out the inside of your chimney is important. 
Let the experts thoroughly — and safely — clean out your fireplace and rest 
assured that dangerous buildup inside the chimney has been cleared away. 
Choose a professional certified by The Chimney Safety Institute of America 
(www.csia.org).
Ensuring a Degree of Comfort
In precentral-air days, folks set up their sleeping quarters so that windows 
welcomed breezes and high ceilings allowed hot air to collect away from 
sleepers. When the temperatures climbed to sweltering, sleeping porches 
drew the inhabitants to bunk down in the coolest place in the house.
With the advent of air conditioning, those who live in warm-weather regions 
no longer have to suffer through sticky-hot nights. But the concerned citizen 
who wants to minimize energy use can prepare the bedroom to be a more 
comfortable and energy-efficient place to dream away a midsummer night.
 
Good air circulation in your home helps manage comfort in warm weather, 
reducing the need for an air conditioner. Cross-ventilation also reduces 
humidity, discourages mildew, and brings in clean, fresh air.

288
Book III: Green Cleaning 
To encourage good air flow and reduce energy-guzzling air-conditioning and 
heating, follow these suggestions:
 
 Install windows that you can open to let in breezes.
 
 Use floor fans or ceiling fans, which take less energy to run than an air 
conditioner.
 
 Hang blinds, curtains, or window treatments that you can open to take 
advantage of sun and breeze and that you can tightly close to provide 
insulation and privacy when needed.
 
 To reduce solar gain (when the sun heats up the interior of your home 
through your windows, making your air conditioner work harder), plant 
deciduous trees so that they shade your windows.
 
 Arrange your bedroom furniture so that the bed is positioned in the 
cross-breeze from the window to the door.
 
 Adjust your bedding instead of the thermostat: heavier blankets in the 
winter, light coverings in the summer.
Greening Your Bedding
In days of old, young girls began at an early age to fill big trunks they called 
hope chests, preparing for the time when they’d be running and furnishing 
their own homes. Bed linens, pillow cases, and blankets filled the hope chests 
as the girls readied for marriage.
If that tradition continued today, most women would have to switch to a stor-
age unit to contain all the bedding products available. With a wider range of 
bed sizes and styles and broader selection of materials, bedding must accom-
modate all sorts of options, from California king–sized beds to futons. Green-
conscious consumers choose mattresses, pillows, and bed linens not just for 
their style, but also on their environmental merits.
A firm understanding of mattress care
Size and firmness level aren’t the only considerations in choosing and main-
taining the fundamental backbone of your bed. Think natural and organic 
when selecting your mattress. Pass up the polyurethane foam and chemically 
treated products for organic-content mattresses. Available through a number 
of companies, preferred mattresses typically contain organic cotton, wool, 
and natural rubber, all biodegradable materials.

289
 Chapter 6: Working Outside In for a Clean and Green Home

Green 
Cleaning
Green mattresses are commonly wrapped in a wool outer layer. Wool deters 
dust mites, keeps its shape, wicks moisture, and is naturally flame-retardant — 
all desirable qualities in a mattress.
After you find the perfect mattress, you need to take care of it to extend its 
life. Mattresses are designed to last 8 to 10 years, although several of the 
organic brands advertise a life of 20 years. But you can extend the wear of 
any mattress by following these practices:
 
 Cover the mattress with a mattress pad to keep dust and dander from 
collecting.
 
 Recycle the mattress pad when it’s yellowed or threadbare: At that 
point, it’s no longer doing its job.
 
 When the bed is stripped, vacuum the mattress to capture loose dust, 
dirt, and dust mite residue.
 
 Flip the mattress over every few months — just like rotating your tires, 
this practices makes for more even wear. (Flipping a large mattress is a 
two-person job: Watch your back.)
 
 Clean stains or spills as soon as possible to prevent bacteria or mildew 
from developing. Use plain cool water or one of the stain remover recipes 
in Chapter 3. Let the mattress dry thoroughly before replacing bedding.
 
 Air out the mattress — at least every time you change the mattress pad 
or flip the mattress. Let the sunshine stream in and do its disinfecting 
job for a couple of hours.
Pillow talk
Bed pillows sell for $3 and up, so they’re affordable to replace often. But fre-
quent replacement doesn’t exactly jibe with a sustainable lifestyle. So invest-
ing in a longer-lasting pillow, such as wool or latex, is a wise choice, even if 
they do cost a bit more.
Whatever its content, pillows last longer when well-cared for:
 
 Use pillow covers or protectors in addition to pillowcases. These zip-up 
coverings help reduce dust mite invasion and keep other pollutants out 
of the pillow filling.
 
 Hand-wash wool pillows; machine-wash cotton and synthetic pillows. 
Follow manufacturers’ instructions.
 
 Air out pillows frequently. Strip their coverings and lay out in the sun on 
a blanket. When you make the bed, fluff and flip the pillows.
 
 Give pillows a rest. If you have extras, rotate them occasionally. But be 
sure to store in the linen closet only after washing or airing.

Book III: Green Cleaning 
Converting to green sheets
Your sheets and pillowcases come in closest contact with your skin. So the 
greener the content, the less chance you’re sleeping with unsafe chemical 
treatments. Choosing your bed linens from organically grown or cultivated 
cotton or silk is the first step. But be sure, too, that the materials aren’t 
treated with a chemical flame retardant or easy-care coating.
 
A new material choice is bamboo. Who knew that the hard, woody grass used 
to support scaffolding in China could produce such soft, luxurious fabric? 
Bamboo sheets do feel silky soft. What’s more, bamboo is a rapidly renewable 
resource. (Now, if only U.S. growers would start cultivating it, so green 
consumers don’t have to pay such a high carbon price for bamboo shipped 
from Asia!) More bamboo benefits? The material is machine-washable, durable, 
and antibacterial.
Dealing with dirty linens
The best organic materials are also easily washable. Change and wash your 
bed sheets as needed — more frequently during sweltering weather and 
certainly during illness to make sure to eliminate germs.
 
Change your pillowcases more often than you change your bed sheets, but 
at least once a week. Your pillow is where your head rests, leaving a more 
tempting feast for dust mites, which favor dead skin flakes, hair, secretions, 
oils from lotions, and residue from gels and shampoo, cosmetics, and hair-
spray.
If you or anyone in your home suffers from allergies, wash sheets in water 
hot enough to kill irritants including dust mites — some recommend 130° or 
higher. Unless pollen allergies are an issue, hang sheets outside in the breeze 
for a heavenly sun-kissed scent that no bottle of fabric softener can capture.
Letting linens out of the closet
Never store soiled linens: Dirt and perspiration attract mildew. Whether you 
stack bedding as sheet sets (bottom and top sheet plus pillowcases) or store 
them separately, place the most recently cleaned linens on the bottom of the 
stack so that you rotate usage consistently. This way, the sheets last a lot 
longer.
Linen closets serve you best if they’re dry and cool with ventilated shelves. 
Mildew can grow in warm, humid environments. If items smell musty, give 
them a good wash and dry before putting them on the bed. Don’t use sealed 
plastic bags for storage, as moisture gets trapped inside and fabric can’t 
breathe. Cotton, canvas, or muslin bags are better choices.

Covering bedspread basics
 
Because they’re not next to your skin, you can get away with less frequent 
washing for blankets, bedspreads, and their accompanying bed skirts and 
sham coverings. (Even hotels don’t wash their spreads as often as their sheets, 
which is why you’re advised not to come into contact with the covering.)
For easiest care and greenest practices at home, however, follow this advice:
 
 Use comforters, blankets, and other bed coverings that are machine 
washable. Avoid those that must be dry-cleaned, a highly toxic process 
involving the chemical perchloroethylene.
 
 If your spread must be dry-cleaned, seek out a cleaner that uses one of 
the more earth-friendly processes.
 
 If you use a comforter, slip on a duvet cover and cut down on care. You 
can button or zip on this cover and wash it separately.
 
 Air out down comforters by hanging them outdoors in the sun or at least 
toss them in the air some when making the bed to evenly redistribute 
the contents.
 
 Launder washable covers and spreads according to label instructions. 
Cold water is likely suitable for most materials. If you or someone else in 
your home has allergies, wash in hot water.

Q
uick: What’s in your walls? It’s hard telling, frankly, 
but if you’re remodeling (or building brand-new 
walls), you have a great opportunity to make sure that 
your house is as healthy, energy-efficient, and ecofriendly 
as it can be. Doing so contributes to the big picture — a 
healthy planet — but to the more immediate concern of 
keeping yourself and your family healthy.
In this part of the book, you get a wealth of ways to put 
sustainable materials into your building or remodeling 
plan and get guidance on which products to seek and 
which to avoid. You discover the latest word on ways to 
bring green flooring, countertops, and other elements 
to your design plan and what to look for in heating and 
cooling systems.

G
iven the amount of wood, concrete, and steel needed to create a new 
home, remodeling your existing home instead of building something new 
is one of the greenest things you can do. The average new home uses 13,127 
square feet of lumber; that’s about the size of three basketball courts — and a 
lot of wood — that you can save by remodeling your home instead.
If your house is architecturally sound and if it has the potential to meet your 
needs, a well-planned renovation project can transform an ordinary house into 
your green dream home. If your home is more than 20 years old, chances are, 
it’s missing important features, such as insulation, energy-efficient windows, 
and water-saving fixtures. A green remodel is your opportunity to fix these 
shortcomings, saving you money on your monthly utility bills. This chapter 
shows you how to turn those little annoyances into design opportunities.
Deciding Whether to Remodel
Remodeling has the potential to transform your home into something that 
you wouldn’t even recognize when complete. Most people aren’t aware of the 
possibilities open to them. A good architect or interior designer can help you 
uncover this potential.
To decide whether a remodel will work in solving your house issues, look at 
your current home. Do you suffer from any of the following?

296
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
 
 Clutter: You may think you need a bigger home to hide all that clutter. 
What you really need is smarter storage (and less stuff), not more space 
to fill with more clutter.
 
 Noise: People often complain that their old house has thin walls, and 
they can hear noise from the other rooms. Adding insulation to these 
walls will help make the house quieter.
 
 Limited use: If your dining room is too small to allow you to entertain, 
you may think you need a new home. An addition can convert your 
dining room into enough space for the perfect dinner party.
 
 Darkness: Even the darkest room in your home can probably be bright-
ened with a good remodel. New windows, skylights, or nice lighting can 
brighten your existing home.
 
 Problems with temperature (too hot or too cold): You might think of 
your house as always uncomfortable: too hot or too cold. Adding insula-
tion and a new heating system can greatly improve the comfort of your 
existing home.
If your main complaints focus on your personal comfort, a green remodel can 
easily turn your messy, dark, or drafty house into the perfect place to enter-
tain friends. The following sections outline some of the benefits of remodel-
ing and give you some questions to ask yourself in order to decide whether 
remodeling is right for you.
Recognizing the benefits of remodeling
Remodeling your existing home instead of building something new offers sev-
eral cost savings and environmental advantages. Consider these benefits:
 
 Remodeling greatly reduces the amount of raw materials you would use 
if you built a new home from scratch.
 
 Remodeling involves less work than building, and less work means less 
construction cost.
 
 You can put the money you save in initial construction costs (over 
what you would have spent on a new home) toward nicer finishes and 
appliances.
 
 Upgrading your appliances to energy-efficient models will lower your 
monthly utility bills.
 
 Choosing green finishes that are low in toxins or are toxin free makes 
your home healthier for your family.
 
 Green buildings may fetch a higher resale price than their nongreen 
counterparts.

Sorting comfort from structural issues
If you’re not sure whether to remodel or build a new home, ask yourself some 
questions:
 
 Are my rooms drafty?
 
 Is my home uncomfortable?
 
 Do I need more storage?
 
 Were my appliances purchased before 1990?
 
 Do I have high utility bills?
 
 Does my home contain lead paint?
 
 Do I have mold issues?
 
 Is there any minor dry rot in the wood in the home?
 
 Is my roof old and in need of replacing?
 
 Do I have ample space but find myself sick of the appearance?
 
 Do I have continual maintenance issues with my home?
Each of these questions addresses an issue of comfort — and the good news 
is that each of them can be remedied. If you answered yes to any of these 
questions, a well-planned remodeling project can correct these issues.
Now ask yourself the following questions:
 
 Does my home need major structural upgrades before work can begin?
 
 Does my home contain asbestos (in the shingles, insulation, or tiles, for 
example)?
 
 Does my lot not allow room for expansion?
 
 Is my home already overbuilt compared to the other homes in the 
neighborhood?
 
 Am I planning to move in less than five years?
Each of these questions addresses a structural or planning issue. If you 
answered yes to any of these questions, the problems with your home may 
be too costly to fix, and a remodel may not help.
 
Of course, if you’re planning on selling your home in the near future, a basic 
remodel may help it sell faster. If you see deficiencies in your home, potential 
buyers will, too.

Book IV: Green Remodeling 
Planning Your Remodel
When you’ve decided that you’re ready to remodel, you may be tempted to 
dive right in and run out to your local home improvement center. But before 
you begin, you need a plan. Part of remodeling is working with existing walls, 
ceiling heights, and window locations. Plus, you need to consider other fac-
tors, such as your budget, the resale value of your home, and the return on 
your investment that you’re likely to get when you sell.
For most people, planning isn’t much fun. But if you don’t plan, you pay for it 
with added costs — in time and money.
 
If you plan on doing any of the work yourself, make a schedule and stick to it. 
Half-completed remodeling projects are surprisingly easy to walk away from 
and never finish. Divide each task into smaller weekend projects. If you can 
finish each part over a single weekend, you’ll be more likely to get it all done.
Considering all things financial
A key part of planning your remodel is considering the cost of the upgrades 
and whether and when you’ll get your money back from a higher resale value.
Thinking about resale value
Looking at other homes in your neighborhood helps you determine where to 
focus your remodeling efforts. Look at surrounding property values and com-
parable homes in the area. If other homes in the area offer large master suites 
with walk-in closets, but yours doesn’t offer much in the way of closet space, 
consider including a master suite in your remodeling project.
Drive around the neighborhood, talk with your neighbors, and consult a real 
estate agent to assess what’s appropriate for your specific neighborhood.
 
Older homes can pose a challenge when you’re remodeling, but they also 
have an inherent charm that’s missing from most new houses. When you 
choose to recycle your existing home, you want to make sure that you don’t 
lose the allure and character of your house. Those are the traits that will 
appeal to a buyer down the road.
Knowing where to get the most bang for your buck
You can spend a fortune remodeling a home, but not every improvement you 
make will reap rewards when it comes time to sell. You need to know which 
areas to focus on to get the most for your money.

299

On average, any money you spend on a remodel should increase the value of 
your home by one and a half times. So if you spend $10,000 on a remodel, 
your home should increase in value by $15,000. But certain rooms add more 
value than others. Here are three rooms that really pay off:
 
 Bedrooms: Adding bedrooms to your home is a great way to increase 
your home’s value. Loosely speaking, a legal bedroom is any room with 
a window, access to fresh air, and a closet.
 
 Kitchen: Upgrading an old, outdated kitchen is the best investment you 
can make in your home. Although the kitchen is the most expensive 
room in a home to build, the payback in increased value is enormous.
 
 Bathrooms: Although you don’t want too many bathrooms, having well-
located bathrooms adds to the value of your home. A half bath (with just 
a toilet and sink) is less expensive than a full bathroom (with a toilet, 
sink, and shower or bathtub), but it carries the same value.
Most older homes have several areas you may have overlooked. You may be 
able to capture valuable space in the following places:
 
 Attic: If your attic is tall enough to stand in, consider adding a staircase 
from the floor below it and finishing the space to make a new room. 
Dormers are an inexpensive way to add ceiling height and windows to 
an existing roof. Rooms up that high may also offer a great view.
 
 Basement: Clear out those old boxes and take advantage of the space 
in your basement. If you have a high ceiling (or at least a ceiling of stan-
dard height — say, 8 feet), finish the space and create the perfect play 
room for the kids, a spare bedroom, or a movie room for the family.
 
 If you have to excavate the floor to get more ceiling height, the costs 
won’t be worth the added value.
Figuring out how long your payback should be
When it comes to remodeling, the length of the payback refers to how long it 
takes for you to see a return on your investment. For example, if you pay to 
install solar panels on your roof, how long will it take you to make up the cost 
of that investment and start reaping the benefits of your lower energy bills?
 
In general, for upgrades to the energy efficiency of your home, expect a payback 
of less than five years. The environment enjoys immediate, priceless effects.
Eyeing green remodeling projects
If you don’t know where to start with your remodeling and you need sugges-
tions, consider the following green projects:

300
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
 
 Remove moldy carpet. Exposure to carpet mold is one of the leading 
causes of respiratory problems. Keeping your carpets clean and dry will 
prevent the growth of mold. Remove moldy carpets and fix the source of 
the water leaks.
 
 Install dual-flush toilets. In the average home, the toilet accounts for 
approximately 30 percent of household water. High-efficiency toilets use 
at least 20 percent less water than standard toilets. Dual-flush water-
saving toilets save you money (about 20 percent on your monthly water 
bills) and reduce sewer loads, not to mention conserving water.
 
 Install efficient windows. Windows are thermal holes. An average home 
may lose 30 percent of its heat or air-conditioning energy through its 
windows. Energy-efficient windows save money on heating and air con-
ditioning every month.
 
 Install energy-efficient appliances. The typical household spends 
$1,400 per year on energy bills. And in this typical home, appliances 
account for about 20 percent of your energy bills. You can save a lot 
of money — including more than $400 per year on heating bills — with 
high-efficiency appliances, such as Energy Star appliances.
 
 Insulate your water heater. Most people tend to overlook the expense 
of heating water for their daily needs. But 25 cents of every dollar you 
spend on energy goes to heat your water. Using an insulated water 
heater, you can save $156 (or much more, depending on energy costs) 
on water heating over the life span of the water heater, which is gener-
ally around ten years.
 
 Install a low-flow showerhead. Inexpensive and easy to install, low-flow 
showerheads and faucet aerators can reduce your home water con-
sumption and your energy cost as much as 50 percent without sacrific-
ing water pressure. You could save $100 per year on water and energy 
costs.
 
 Install natural insulation in your walls and attic. Natural insulation in 
walls, such as Coler Natural Insulation (www.coler.com) and Bonded 
Logic (www.bondedlogic.com), are highly effective and have an excep-
tionally low impact on the environment. By reducing heating demand, 
both insulations significantly reduce household carbon-dioxide emissions.
 
 Use nontoxic cleaning methods. Today’s modern home is loaded with 
toxic and polluting substances. The effects of these substances range 
from long-term health concerns for the family to environmental pollu-
tion caused in manufacturing and disposal. Alternative, nontoxic clean-
ing methods are much healthier and environmentally responsible. These 
methods include baking soda, borax, white vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, 
and trisodium phosphate.
 
 Use nontoxic paints. Indoor paints and finishes are among the leading 
causes of harmful indoor gases. Recently developed low-VOC and zero-
VOC paints are durable, cost-effective, and much less harmful to people 
and the environment.

 VOC stands for volatile organic compound. VOCs are the harmful chemi-
cals in paint and the source of that new-paint smell. Not all VOCs have 
an odor, however: don’t assume that something is safe just because you 
can’t smell it.
 
 Install a programmable thermostat with a timer. To maximize your 
energy savings without sacrificing comfort, you can install an automatic 
setback or programmable thermostat. If you forget to turn down the 
heat before you leave for work in the morning, a programmable thermo-
stat adjusts the temperature setting for you. You can save 5 percent to 
15 percent per year on energy bills by using a programmable thermostat 
with a timer.
 
 Test your home for radon. Radon is a naturally occurring gas that 
comes from the decay of uranium found in nearly all soils. Long-term 
exposure to elevated levels of radon increases your risk of lung cancer. 
Testing for radon is easy and inexpensive and should only take a few 
minutes through low-cost, do-it-yourself radon test kits, which are avail-
able in hardware stores and other retail outlets.
 
 Insulate your roof. Roof insulation reduces the amount of heat that 
flows from a house through the roof to the cold outside air. By reducing 
this heat loss, roof insulation reduces the amount of energy needed to 
heat the house in the winter. You can save 13 percent per year on your 
heating bills by insulating your roof.
 
 Install solar panels. The average solar heating system pays for itself in 
four to seven years. Not only can installing solar panels save you money 
by reducing or eliminating your electric bill, but it generates pollution-
free and maintenance-free electricity. You can save $500 per year on 
energy bills by installing solar panels on your roof.
 
 Switch to a solar water heater. A solar water heater is an environmen-
tally sustainable home energy system that doesn’t produce harmful 
greenhouse gases. You can save 50 to 85 percent per year on your 
energy bills by using a solar water heater.
 
 Install sun tunnels. Also called solar tubes, these mini skylights are easy 
to install through an existing attic. Because they use flexible tubes to 
carry the light through your attic, you can place them almost anywhere 
and bring light to a previously dark corner, thereby saving money on 
your electric bill.
 
 Put in a whole-house fan. You may see up to a 30 percent savings on 
air-conditioning costs with a powered attic fan — if your home is well-
sealed. Otherwise the fan can suck out the expensive cooled air (and 
suck in hot air from outside) through the leaks in your house.
 
 Depending on the weather where you live, you may even be able to use a 
whole-house fan in place of an air-conditioning system to bring in cooler 
outside air and protect against mold or mildew caused by attic humidity.

If you’re starting on a journey, you need to know where you’re going. The 
following sections show you how you can create the ideal green kitchen, 
bathroom, bedroom, and nursery. Think of this section as a green road map.
Kitchens
Your kitchen is the heart of your home. Unfortunately, older homes have 
small, utilitarian kitchens not designed for socializing. In Figure 1-1, you 
can see a typical kitchen and the green features to include in your kitchen 
remodel:
 
 Built-in recycling center: Set aside space for recycling and composting 
bins to encourage their use.
 
 Compact fluorescent light bulbs: Energy-saving light bulbs save energy 
and money. Light the work surfaces with directional lights.
 
 Energy Star dishwasher and refrigerator: These two appliances con-
sume more energy than any other. Find the most energy-efficient models 
available.
 
 Flow reducer: Save water without sacrificing water pressure with an 
inexpensive flow reducer or aerator.
 
 Formaldehyde-free materials: Most cabinetry is made with cheap 
plywood held together with formaldehyde. Select formaldehyde-free 
wood instead.
 
 FSC-certified trim: Choose sustainably harvested wood that is stamped 
from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).
 
 Low-VOC interior paint: Stay healthy with low- or no-VOC paints.
 
 Range vented outside: Carry the cooking fumes outside to keep the air 
fresh.
 
 Recycled-content tile and countertops: Gorgeous choices in tile are 
available with recycled metals, glass, ceramics, and paper.
 
 Sustainable flooring: Cork and linoleum are among the many new 
durable and comfortable green flooring choices for your kitchen.
 
 Upgraded insulation: While remodeling your kitchen, insulate the 
existing walls.
Because most of the energy in the home is consumed in the kitchen, these 
energy-saving suggestions will significantly reduce your monthly utility bills.

You’re in your bathroom every day, several times a day, which makes it one 
of the most scrutinized rooms in a house. You may focus on those ugly pink 
tiles from the 1980s, but appearance isn’t all that matters when it comes to a 
green bathroom remodel: You can make some significant changes that won’t 
affect appearance at all, but will save energy and money while helping the 
environment.
In Figure 1-2, you can see a typical bathroom and the green features to 
include in every bathroom remodel:
 
 Water filter: If needed, filter the water coming out of the tap with an 
inexpensive filter. It will improve the taste of the water and eliminate the 
need to buy bottled water.

304
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
 
 Compact fluorescent bulbs: Save money and energy with compact
fluorescent bulbs. Look for color-corrected bulbs to light areas where 
you put on makeup.
 
 Double-paned low-E window: Low-emissivity (or low-e) windows use 
energy-efficient, insulated glass. Keep your heat from leaking out of your 
home with energy-efficient windows.
 
 Flow reducers: You can reduce the amount of water you use without 
losing water pressure by installing a simple flow reducer.
 
 Formaldehyde-free cabinetry: Most cabinetry is made from plywood 
with toxic glues. Skip the formaldehyde.
 
 FSC-certified wood: Buy cabinets using sustainably harvested wood 
stamped by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Chapter 2 tells you 
more about FSC-certified options for your home.
 
 Low-flow, duel flush, or ultra efficient toilet: You can save thousands of 
gallons of fresh water a year by choosing a “green” toilet. They look and 
cost similar as their traditional counterparts, too. Look for efficient models 
marked with the Environmental Protection Agency’s WaterSense label.
 
 Low-VOC interior paint: Paint the walls with a low or no-VOC paint to 
create a healthier room.
 
 Recycled-content tile: Dozens of manufacturers offer beautiful tiles 
made from recycled glass, stone, or ceramics.
Bedrooms
You’re not conscious of much of it, but you spend a significant amount of 
time in your bedroom, so making sure it’s a healthy retreat is important. 
Figure 1-3 shows opportunities for greening your bedroom.
For many people, their bedroom doubles as a TV room, office, and reading 
room. Avoid sleeping problems by using your bedroom only for sleeping. 
Design the room specifically for that purpose with black-out curtains and 
operable windows for fresh air.
Insulate all the walls of the bedroom with formaldehyde-free insulation to 
block unwanted noise from disturbing you. Turn the thermostat down and 
use an extra blanket instead. A timed, programmable thermostat can warm 
up your room before you wake up.
Select a mattress and linens made of natural materials. You can find an incred-
ible selection at stores like Gaiam (www.gaiam.com). Select nonvinyl carpet-
ing and low- or zero-VOC paints. Removing VOCs helps you sleep better.
Keep your electric clock away from your head. The electromagnetic field dis-
turbs dream patterns.

Nurseries
A newborn baby has not yet developed resistance to chemicals. Because 
babies can spend up to 18 hours a day in their nurseries, the finishes you 
select are even more important for their health.
In Figure 1-4, you see how to make the perfect green nursery for your new-
born baby.
Try to create a nontoxic nursery using zero-VOC paints. Pregnant women 
should avoid painting altogether — have someone else do it. Paint at least 
one month before the baby is due and open the window to flush the room 
with fresh air.
Avoid wall-to-wall carpeting because it traps dust mites and allergens. A natu-
ral linoleum floor is the best choice, but wood works just as well. Be sure that 
the floor has no toxic sealers.
A checklist for remodeling your kitchen
Finish materials:
 ❑ Use low-/no-VOC paint.
 ❑ Use low-/no-VOC adhesives.
 ❑ Use low-/no-VOC sealers.
 ❑ Use formaldehyde-free cabinetry.
 ❑ Use FSC-certified wood.
 ❑ Use finger-jointed trim, where small pieces 
of wood are joined together to form a long 
length of trim.
 ❑ Replace vinyl with rapidly renewable floor-
ing, like cork or linoleum.
 ❑ Use recycled-content glass or ceramic 
tiles.
 ❑ Vent range hood to outside.
Framing:
 ❑ Salvage materials from demolition.
 ❑ Use engineered lumber.
 ❑ Use FSC-certified wood for framing.
Energy systems:
 ❑ Install compact fluorescent light bulbs.
 ❑ Install dimmers and occupancy sensors.
 ❑ Replace appliances built before 1990 with 
Energy Star models.
 ❑ Move the refrigerator away from the sun 
and oven.
 ❑ Replace or restore windows with new 
energy-efficient glass panes.
Water systems:
 ❑ Insulate hot- and cold-water pipes.
 ❑ Add flow reducers or aerators to all faucets.
 ❑ Add a water filter to the sink or whole house 
if needed.

In order to block and control the sunlight, use wooden shutters. Use zero-
VOC paints or stains. Aluminum miniblinds work just as well as wood and 
don’t require paint.
Select naturally finished wood furniture with pure, organic cotton and wool 
linens. Avoid plastic toys; most are made in China and can contain traces of 
lead and other potent toxins. Cloth and wood toys are a better choice.
Clean your green nursery with natural or nontoxic cleaning products. You 
can find some homemade cleaners in Chapter 3 of the Green Cleaning section 
of this book.

Surviving Your Remodel
Renovating your home is a stressful process. From the cost to the dust to the 
interruption, remodeling will turn your daily life upside down. Seeing your 
family home get torn apart adds to the regular construction stress. Keeping 
the end result in mind helps you survive these traumatic times. In the follow-
ing sections, you find tips for surviving your remodel.
Living in the house during construction
Whether due to cost concerns or curiosity, you may want to live in your 
house during your remodel. If you’re doing minor work, staying in the house 
during construction isn’t an issue, but if you’re doing an extensive remodel, it 
can be like living in a war zone.

309
 Chapter 1: Thinking Sustainability When You Remodel
Book IV
Green 
Remodeling
 
Talk to your contractor about whether it’ll be okay for you to live in the 
home during construction. If you decide to stay in the house, keep in mind 
the following suggestions:
 
 Make sure that your contractor alerts you in advance of any interruptions 
to the power or water. If you know that the power or water will be turned 
off, you can plan to take showers or power down your computer 
beforehand.
 
 Plan a long vacation to coincide with the more disruptive construction 
work. You may need a vacation during the remodel just to relax!
 
 Create a backup plan for cooking and showering for those times 
when things don’t go as planned. Knowing what to do ahead of time 
will alleviate most of your construction stress.
 
The majority of the stress people feel from construction comes from having 
unrealistic expectations. Expect to have dust in your clothes, no access to 
your stuff, and early mornings when you’re awakened by all the noise. If you 
expect the construction process to be tough, you won’t be surprised by it. 
Set your expectations ahead of time, and you’ll find yourself delighted by the 
result.
Health risks: Handling surprises 
as they come
When construction begins and the demolition opens up the walls, finding 
some surprises is common. Be aware of the potential health risks described 
in the following list:
 
 Asbestos: Asbestos was commonly used in insulation, tiles, and siding 
from the 1940s through the 1970s. It’s dangerous if it’s broken and fibers 
are released into the air. Don’t sand or break up any material you sus-
pect may contain asbestos. Turn to Chapter 5 of Book I to find out more 
about asbestos.
 
 Exposure to asbestos dust is dangerous! Check with your local building 
department for more information on asbestos abatement. You may need 
a licensed abatement contractor.
 
 Mold: When moisture gets into a wall and isn’t given a chance to dry, 
mold can form. Even unseen mold can create respiratory illness and 
other sicknesses. Fix the source of the leak and remove the moldy and 
damp materials completely.

310
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
 
 Lead paint: If your home was built before 1978, you could find some 
layers of lead paint below the current paint. Originally used as a pigment 
in paint, lead was found to be hazardous, because it flakes off and turns 
into dust, which can be inhaled.
 
 Exposure to lead paint flakes or dust is dangerous! Your local building 
department can provide you with more information on removing lead 
from your home.
 
 Vinyl: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or vinyl, is one of the most common 
synthetic materials. Approximately 75 percent of all PVC manufactured 
is used in construction materials. It creeps into all sorts of unlikely 
building products. PVC is the worst plastic from an environmental 
health perspective, posing great environmental and health hazards in its 
manufacture and disposal.
 
 Chances are, you’ve got vinyl in your home. As you remodel, take out 
the vinyl and recycle it. Your local waste company can tell you how and 
where to recycle vinyl.
 
Put some extra money in your budget to pay for these unexpected problems 
as they arise. Your homeowner’s insurance may cover some of the expense 
of cleanup.

H
ow do you separate fact from fiction when it comes to the green quali-
ties of a product or material? Part of green building and remodeling is 
examining materials and products and discovering methods to reduce their 
impact.
In this chapter, you find various methods available for examining products 
and selecting materials.
Looking at Life Cycle
Everything — every material, every product — has a life cycle. A life cycle 
is the journey a material goes through during its entire life. Every material 
starts in some raw form, is processed, and is made into a finished product. At 
some point — five, ten, or dozens of years later — the material reaches the 
end of its life and is disposed of. (In fact, most construction materials end up 
in a landfill.)

312
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
A life cycle is divided into three phases:
 
 Production: Raw materials are extracted and processed into a finished 
product. This process occurs before you even get to see the product in 
your home.
 
 Use: The finished product is used and needs to be operated, maintained, 
and repaired. The length of this stage varies from one material to the next.
 
 Return: At some point, the product is no longer needed or needs to 
be replaced. It’s thrown into a landfill, recycled, or degrades back into 
some raw material.
Recognizing What Goes Into and Comes 
Out of Material Production
In looking at materials, you need to understand the notion of embodied 
energy. Embodied energy is all the energy and effort that went into the 
making of a material, including all the effort from
 
 Extraction: The material is harvested from nature.
 
 Processing: After it’s harvested, the material is processed into a usable 
form for manufacturing.
 
 Manufacturing: The processed material is fabricated into the final product.
 
 Transportation: The finished product is shipped (often long distances) 
to a warehouse or store.
 
 Installation: After it arrives on the construction site, the final product 
must be cut, fit, and installed.
People usually overlook embodied energy when they think about green 
products, but it’s a large portion of the overall impact of a material on the 
environment.
For example, the chair you’re sitting on while reading this book has energy 
in it. Sure, it isn’t plugged into the wall (unless you’re sitting in one of those 
vibrating massage chairs!), but there is energy within the chair. Energy is 
embodied within it. Most likely someone had to farm cotton, chop down 
wood, forge nails, and shear sheep just to get the raw materials together. 
Some of these materials may have even traveled a long distance to get to the 
factory. All these steps involved in making the chair required energy.
After the materials were gathered up, someone had to process them into 
fabric and cut the wood into a structure. All these steps also required energy.

313
 Chapter 2: Thinking about Building Materials in New Ways
Book IV
Green 
Remodeling
Finally, someone had to ship these products to the store. The store is 
probably located far away from the factory, so the chair had to travel by 
plane, truck, or train to get there. All these steps also required energy.
All these efforts to make your chair add up to an immense amount of energy 
and effort. The goal of examining this embodied energy is to find ways to 
reduce it. For example, if your chair were made out of salvaged scrap wood, 
no new trees would have to be destroyed to extract the wood. If when the 
wood was being cut, the leftover scraps were saved for later reuse, it would 
save future materials. If a local craftsman made your new chair, it wouldn’t 
have to be shipped long distances, saving gasoline and greenhouse gas from 
the exhaust. Repurposing and buying local are ways that embodied energy 
can be reduced to lessen the environmental impact of a product.
In addition to the energy that goes into a product, keep in mind the materials 
that come out of manufacture and production. Byproducts are all the leftover 
materials created from the material’s life cycle, stuff like the greenhouse gas 
that results from the manufacture of steel.
When you think of byproducts, you probably assume that they’re all bad. But 
that’s not necessarily the case. For the most part, byproducts are potentially 
valuable resources — we’re just not smart enough to know how to deal with 
them yet.
 
Ask product manufacturers about the byproducts they create and what they 
do with them. Many products now contain their own scrap recycled back 
into the product.
Talking to Manufacturers 
about Materials
Whenever you’re choosing among various products to use in your building 
or remodeling project, you want to find out some key information from the 
products’ manufacturers.
For example, say you’re getting ready to buy countertops. You start by 
making a list of the countertops you like best. After you’ve identified your 
favorite products, find out which companies manufacture those products. 
For each product, write down the company’s contact information alongside 
the name of the product and any other identifying information you can find 
(such as the manufacturer’s product ID number). This information is often on 
the back of the sample you see at a showroom or store.

314
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
 
Not every manufacturer will have the same identifying information for every 
product. You just want to assemble as much identifying information as possible 
so that the manufacturer knows exactly which product you have a question 
about.
After you have your list of products and manufacturers, start by calling the first 
one on your list and move through your list until you’ve found the answers you 
need from every manufacturer. Be sure to ask each manufacturer the questions 
in the following sections — you want to be able to compare the answers to 
all the questions from all the manufacturers so that you can get an accurate 
picture of how they stack up.
You can find many of the answers to these questions from the manufacturers 
themselves in the form of a material safety and data sheet (MSDS). Every 
manufacturer is required by law to produce an MSDS for every product it sells. 
The MSDS includes information about the product, such as ingredients, toxicity, 
health effects, proper storage, disposal, and special handling procedures. The 
exact contents of the MSDS will vary from product to product, but they’re 
basically the same.
 
You can request the MSDS directly from the manufacturer or find the MSDS 
online at Web sites such as MSDS Search (www.msdssearch.com). In 
addition, each sales representative should be able to provide some answers 
about the products he sells. If the sales rep doesn’t know, ask him to find out.
Where did this material come from?
From the obvious (wood comes from trees) to the obscure (linoleum comes 
from linseed oil), this question explores the source of the product. When 
looking for green materials, try to choose one of the following options:
 
 Reclaimed: Reusing materials salvaged from other uses, reclaimed 
materials offer old material quality no longer available. For example, the 
siding of an old barn can be milled into new flooring.
 
 Recycled: Unlike reclaimed materials, recycled materials are put back into 
the material production and reprocessed into new finishes. Sourced from 
various materials, recycled materials often have slight imperfections that 
add to the final appearance. For example, glass tiles can be made from 
recycled windshields.
 
 Sustainably harvested: Yielding materials without completely destroying 
the chance for future harvesting, sustainable-harvested materials will be 
around for future generations. Look for lumber certified as being grown 
in and harvested from managed forests. The Forest Stewardship Council 
(www.fscus.org) is a great resource.

315
 Chapter 2: Thinking about Building Materials in New Ways
Book IV
Green 
Remodeling
 
 Rapidly renewable: Instead of needing the 50+ years required to grow 
an entire forest, rapidly renewable materials grow back within ten years. 
These resources also offer some unique aesthetic options. For example, 
cork flooring comes from the bark of a cork tree; cork will grow back in 
less than seven years. Bamboo is another popular and rapidly renewable 
resource and great for sturdy flooring.
In addition to helping preserve our resources, these materials also offer 
finishes that are often more unusual and attractive than their traditional 
counterparts.
What are the byproducts of 
the manufacturing process?
The manufacturing of any product brings with it some unwanted results. 
These byproducts are frequently difficult to measure precisely, but they’re 
easy to identify in a general way. Deforestation, pollution, global warming, 
and landfill debris are the most common byproducts to look for.
 
Most manufacturers aren’t fully aware of the impact of their own products. 
By asking the questions in this section, you’re actually helping bring green 
issues to the attention of the manufacturer.
Look for products where the manufacturing process is low in pollution. Make 
sure that the manufacturer did not destroy something else to get to this 
material.
How is the material delivered 
and installed?
The average item on a grocery-store shelf travels over 1,500 miles to get there. 
(The traveling your groceries do to find their place in the aisles is referred to 
as food miles.) Most of the products people use trek great distances to reach 
them. Choosing locally produced materials will lessen the energy used. When 
building, select local materials that traveled less than 500 miles to get to you.
The installation of the materials may require additional finishes, such as 
sealers on a granite countertop or urethane coatings on a wood floor. These 
things add to the labor (and the cost) of using this material. Pick materials 
that don’t need these extra finishes.

316
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
How is the material maintained 
and operated?
From sealers and lacquers to paints and oils, many materials require 
continual care and maintenance. Other products require constant energy, 
even when they’re not in use. Give preference to products that are durable 
and easily repaired. Does this product need continual energy by being 
plugged in all the time, or does it use batteries? Does it need to be painted 
(and then repainted)?
How healthy are the materials?
Most people in the United States spend 80 to 90 percent of their time 
indoors, so the healthy aspects of the materials used in home construction 
is important. From the paint on the walls, to the hidden adhesives under the 
rug, most people’s homes are full of pollutants. Specifically choosing healthy 
materials will reduce these dangers.
What do you do with the materials 
when you’re done with them?
The product manufacturer should be able to tell you how to safely dispose of 
their products. Most might just tell you to “throw it in the trash,” which isn’t 
a good answer. Look for materials that are recyclable so that they can be 
reused in the future.
The typical kitchen remodel is good for 15 years. By the time your new 
kitchen is ready for a facelift, you may have moved to a new home. Designing 
with durable, recyclable, or biodegradable materials will help ensure safe 
reuse, even if you aren’t around. Look for the following traits in the materials 
you use in your home:
 
 Durability: If the product is durable, it will have a longer life, and you’ll 
use it for a longer period of time.
 
 Recyclability: If you don’t mind taking special care to recycle a material, 
then choose something that will be recyclable, which is the best choice.
 
 Biodegradability: If you think you’ll just end up throwing the product 
in the trash, at least choose a biodegradable material. Biodegradable 
means that the product can break down naturally and not spread toxins 
into the ground.

Putting Standard Materials 
to the Life Cycle Test
Buildings consume a whopping 40 percent of the world’s materials. The 
construction of a typical 2,000-square-foot home uses approximately
 
 1,397 tons of concrete
 
 13,127 board feet of framing lumber
 
 6,212 square feet of plywood sheathing
 
 2,325 square feet of exterior siding material
 
 3,100 square feet of roofing material
 
 3,061 square feet of insulation
 
 6,144 square feet of drywall
 
 2,085 square feet of flooring material (carpet, tile, or wood)
With all the materials that go into a single home, the impact on the 
environment is immense. In the following sections, you find some of the more 
traditional and common construction products put to the life-cycle test.
Concrete
From the walls of the foundation to the mortar in the tile, concrete is used in 
nearly every construction project. You can’t avoid it. Here’s a look at the life 
cycle of concrete:
 
 Where does concrete come from? Concrete is natural, made up of sand, 
Portland cement, stone, and water. Verdict: Good.
 
 What are the byproducts of making concrete? The production of the 
chief ingredient — Portland cement — requires an immense amount of 
energy, and the byproduct is greenhouse gases. Verdict: Bad.
 
 How is concrete delivered and installed? Concrete can be made locally 
or even right on the job site. Verdict: Good.
 
 How is concrete maintained and operated? Concrete is durable, can be 
left unpainted, and is virtually maintenance free. Verdict: Good.
 
 How healthy is concrete? Concrete is stable and does not release any 
harmful chemicals. Verdict: Good.
 
 What do we do with concrete after we’re done with it? Concrete is 
technically recyclable and could be reused. However, reuse and recycling 
don’t happen with concrete as often as they should. Verdict: Fair.

318
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
By asking these simple questions, you can see the only real issue with 
using concrete comes from the byproducts created from Portland cement. 
But instead of using Portland cement, you can use fly ash. Fly ash, the soot 
byproduct of coal-fired electric plants, can substitute for 15 percent to 50 
percent of the Portland cement in the concrete. This substitution saves 44 
trillion BTUs of energy annually in the United States, while preventing the 
mercury content of the fly ash from seeping into the food and water supply.
Bottom line: Fly ash concrete is the most responsible choice. After it’s mixed 
with concrete, the mercury in the fly ash is safe and completely contained. 
Any concrete contractor or structural engineer can find sources of fly ash. 
For more information, visit www.flyash.com.
Wood
Nearly all (some 90 percent) of the homes built in the United States are 
framed out of wood. Plus, if you consider trim, furniture, cabinets, and doors, 
wood is used throughout the design of a home. Here’s how wood stands up 
to the life cycle test:
 
 Where does wood come from? Wood is natural and renewable, coming 
from various species of trees. Verdict: Good.
 
 What are the byproducts of harvesting wood? Most wood is sourced 
from the clear-cutting of forests. Cutting down the forest just to get to the 
wood is like shoveling up the lawn to get the blades of grass. Verdict: Bad.
 
 How is wood delivered and installed? Most wood comes from the 
Pacific Northwest and Canada and is shipped around the United States 
and Canada. Energy is required to ship and mill the wood. Wood is 
installed easily, and the most junior person on the construction site 
knows how to work with wood. Verdict: Fair.
 
 How is wood maintained and operated? The wood itself is durable and 
easily refinished, but it’s traditionally covered with sealers and coatings 
that release harmful chemicals. Verdict: Fair.
 
 How healthy is wood? The wood itself is very healthy, because it’s a 
natural material. However, it’s often finished with chemical sealers. 
Verdict: Good.
 
 What do we do with wood after we’re done with it? Wood can be 
reclaimed and milled into other uses. It can be recycled and turned into 
particle board. Verdict: Good.
The source of wood has the greatest environmental impact. Instead of using 
wood from destructive sources, you can get sustainably harvested wood. 
Certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (www.fscus.org), this wood 
has been certified to come from well-managed sources. Expect to pay 20 
percent more for sustainably harvested wood than you would pay otherwise.

Glass
You probably couldn’t imagine your home without glass. The windows and 
doors of your home rely on glass to let in light and provide you with the 
views of your yard or neighborhood. Other products, such as glass tile and 
lighting fixtures, make glass one of the most common materials in your home. 
So how does glass stack up on the life-cycle test?
 
 Where does glass come from? Glass is made from sand, specifically 
silica. It comes from a natural and abundant raw material. Verdict: Good.
 
 What are the byproducts of producing glass? The formation of glass 
requires heat and molten tin, which requires energy and produces some 
greenhouse-gas emissions in the process. Verdict: Fair.
 
 How is glass delivered and installed? Unlike most other construction 
materials, glass is often produced locally and is available everywhere. 
Verdict: Good.
 
 How is glass maintained and operated? Except for protection from 
the occasional flying baseball, glass is durable and easily maintained. It 
requires only simple cleaning. Verdict: Good.
 
 How healthy is glass? Glass is completely inert and does not release any 
chemicals. It is also mold resistant, unlike other exterior materials like 
wood. Verdict: Good.
 
 What do we do with glass after we’re done with it? Glass is one of the 
most commonly recycled materials on the planet. Americans recycle 20 
percent of the glass we use. Verdict: Good.
Glass is already a very green material, but using recycled glass lessens 
its minimal impact further. Producing recycled glass requires less energy 
because the crushed recycled glass melts at a lower temperature. Recycled 
glass products are readily and easily available and often aren’t even adver-
tised as recycled. The costs are the same as new glass.
Steel
The high strength of steel makes it ideal for use in structural beams and 
foundations. But steel is also used in everything from cabinets, to furniture, 
to doorknobs. You find steel everywhere. Here’s how steel measures up on 
the life-cycle test:
 
 Where does steel come from? Structural steel is an alloy produced from 
iron ore. Mined out of the earth, the production of steel creates extensive 
environmental destruction. Verdict: Bad.
 
 What are the byproducts of producing steel? The steel industry is 
one of the largest energy consumers in manufacturing. The intense 

320
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
heat required in steel production comes from the burning of coal and 
releases thousands of tons of greenhouse gas as a result. Verdict: Bad.
 
 How is steel delivered and installed? Steel is produced in a relatively 
small number of plants around the United States. Due to the weight and 
size of most steel elements, it requires a great deal of energy to transport. 
Verdict: Fair.
 
 How is steel maintained and operated? The strength and durability of 
steel is unsurpassed. It requires little, if no, maintenance. Verdict: Good.
 
 How healthy is steel? Steel is inert and doesn’t release any chemicals. 
Verdict: Good.
 
 What do we do with steel after we’re done with it? Steel is highly 
recyclable. Steel has risen in price in the last decade, making it one of 
the most valuable resources to save from the demolition pile. (In fact, 
many contractors have to lock up their construction sites at night to 
prevent the steel awaiting installation from being stolen.) Verdict: Good.
The embodied energy of steel creates a great deal of environmental impact. 
Because of the cost of the energy required to mine and produce it, most 
structural steel contains up to 80 percent recycled content in order to lower 
costs. If you’re using steel in your construction project, look for the highest 
recycled content available.
Brick
Bricks add a rustic and human scale to a home. In the U.S. Northeast and 
Midwest, brick is a common finish material in buildings. Bricks also make 
attractive walkways and fireplaces. Here’s where brick comes out on the 
life-cycle test:
 
 Where does brick come from? Dating back nearly 10,000 years, brick is 
a ceramic material created from the firing of clay. It’s a natural material 
and doesn’t have the same impact as the mining or quarrying of stone. 
Aggressive clay mining can destroy farmland. Verdict: Fair.
 
 What are the byproducts of producing brick? Because of the heat 
required to fire the clay, brick production demands high energy and 
generates some greenhouse gases. Verdict: Bad.
 
 How is brick delivered and installed? Bricks are produced at locations 
across the country, meaning that in general they don’t travel far to get 
to you. Their relatively small, modular size makes them very resource 
efficient and encourages use of the entire brick. Verdict: Good.
 
 How is brick maintained and operated? The thermal mass of brick 
helps maintain the temperature of the building. The brick itself requires 
little maintenance. Verdict: Good.

321
 Chapter 2: Thinking about Building Materials in New Ways
Book IV
Green 
Remodeling
 
 How healthy is brick? Brick is inert and does not release any chemicals. 
Verdict: Good.
 
 What do we do with brick after we’re done with it? Although technically 
recyclable, most people don’t pay much attention to protecting bricks 
during demolition. If preserved, reclaimed bricks have a certain charm. 
Verdict: Fair.
The durability, strength, and natural material of brick make it a good choice 
for green building. Reclaimed bricks don’t require the embodied energy of 
new bricks.
Drywall
Drywall is one of the most common materials used in construction today. 
Walls are typically covered with drywall, making it one of the most common 
materials in a home. Here’s how drywall stacks up on the life-cycle test:
 
 Where does drywall come from? Drywall, often referred to as gypsum 
board, is the traditional wall finish for interior walls and ceilings. This 
rigid panel consists of an inner core of gypsum plaster, wrapped with 
paper. Verdict: Fair.
 
 What are the byproducts of producing drywall? The gypsum is mined 
and creates some substantial environmental impact. Verdict: Bad.
 
 How is drywall delivered and installed? Formed into wide boards, 
drywall lends itself to leftover pieces created in the course of installation. 
(Up to 17 percent of drywall is wasted during construction.) Because 
it generally comes in 4-foot widths, designing (or having your architect 
design) rooms to be some module of 4 feet reduces waste. Drywall can’t 
be left unfinished; it’s typically painted. Use a zero-VOC or low-VOC 
paint to reduce the release of chemicals. Verdict: Good.
 
 How is drywall maintained and operated? Drywall is easily patched 
and repainted. Verdict: Good.
 
 How healthy is drywall? Drywall is a relatively healthy material, 
especially when a healthy paint is used to finish it. Verdict: Good.
 
 What do we do with drywall after we’re done with it? Drywall is easily 
damaged in the demolition process, making it difficult to recycle into a 
reusable form. Scrap pieces of drywall can be recycled if separated from 
the other construction waste. Verdict: Fair.
Given the impact of gypsum mining, using recycled-content drywall is a great 
idea. Several manufacturers offer recycled-content drywall paper as well.

Vinyl
Vinyl creeps into a surprising number of construction products. It can be 
found in everything from pipes, to floor tile, to windows. Here’s where vinyl 
comes out on the life-cycle test:
 
 Where does vinyl come from? Vinyl, also referred to as polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC), is a type of plastic polymer made from petroleum, and is one of the 
most common synthetic materials. Verdict: Bad.
 
 What are the byproducts of producing vinyl? Often referred to as the 
“poison plastic,” vinyl has been linked to numerous rare cancers occurring 
in the factory workers and in neighborhoods surrounding the production 
plants. Verdict: Bad.
 
 How is vinyl delivered and installed? So toxic it is only produced in a 
handful of locations, raw vinyl is shipped to thousands of manufacturers 
around the world to be made into everything from siding to children’s 
toys. It has to travel vast distances, using immense amounts of energy. 
Verdict: Fair.
 
 How is vinyl maintained and operated? Vinyl is incredibly flexible and 
durable. It does not require additional painting or finishing. Verdict: 
Good.
 
 How healthy is vinyl? In its final state, vinyl is inert and does not 
release chemicals. In a fire, however, vinyl produces smoke fumes so 
toxic that they can kill the inhabitants in 20 minutes. The health issues 
surrounding the production of vinyl are severe. Verdict: Bad.
 
 What do we do with vinyl after we’re done with it? Although techni-
cally recyclable, vinyl is so difficult to recycle that most recycling plants 
will not accept it. Even if it does manage to find its way to a recycling 
center, it can only be made into more vinyl. Verdict: Bad.
 
When most people think of vinyl, they probably think fondly of their old 
vinyl LP records. But the truth about vinyl is less romantic. PVC appears in 
thousands of different formulations and configurations. Approximately 75 
percent of all PVC manufactured is used in construction materials. PVC is the 
worst plastic from an environmental-health perspective, posing great envi-
ronmental and health hazards in its manufacture, product life, and disposal. 
Fortunately, healthier alternatives exist. For a list of alternatives to vinyl, visit

Looking to Trusted Green Certification 
Programs When Shopping for Materials
Several wonderful green certification programs have emerged as well-
respected, trusted names. Similar to the Good Housekeeping Seal, these 
programs give you some assurance of product claims:
 
 Cradle to Cradle Certification (www.c2ccertified.com): Cradle to 
Cradle (C2C) certifies a high standard for “environmentally intelligent” 
design. C2C examines the entire life cycle of a material to ensure the 
most environmentally friendly material available.
 
 Forest Stewardship Council (www.fscus.org): The FSC seal of 
approval is something you find on wood products certifying that wood 
has been sustainably harvested, meaning the forests have been protected 
to last for future generations. Look for the FSC logo as the greenest 
choice in purchasing wood products.
 
 GREENGUARD (www.greenguard.org): GREENGUARD is an 
independent organization that has developed standards for adhesives, 
appliances, ceiling, flooring, insulation, paint, and wall-covering 
products. The GREENGUARD logo indicates interior materials with low 
chemical emissions.
 
 Green Seal (www.greenseal.org): Green Seal’s environmental standards 
for paints, household cleaners, and window products date back to the 
mid-1990s, and the products are independently tested so there’s no 
bias. The Green Seal logo indicates the product has gone through the 
rigorous Green Seal testing standards. The seal is used on paints, paper, 
cleaners, and even on hotels to certify the overall environmental quality.
 
 Scientific Certification Systems (www.scscertified.com): Scientific 
Certification Systems (SCS) has developed a certification program for 
environmentally preferable products and services, such as adhesives 
and sealants, cabinetry and casework, carpet, doors, flooring, paints, 
and wall coverings. The SCS logo is an independent certification that the 
product lives up to its environmental claims, including the amount of 
recycled content and the amount of chemicals released.

Setting Priorities and 
Goals for Your Home
Green building is riddled with contradictions. For example, should you 
choose the bamboo that was sustainably harvested but came from 3,000 
miles away? Or should you opt for the wood from trees that weren’t 
sustainably harvested but were grown locally?
Evaluate each decision on a project-by-project basis. For example, if you plan 
on remodeling again in just a few years, using the bamboo wouldn’t be the 
most environmentally correct choice. But if this floor will be around for the 
next foreseeable decade or so, bamboo may be a wise decision.
 
Here’s a recommended list of priorities when it comes to choosing products 
for your green building or remodeling project. The items at the top of the list 
in this example are more important than the ones at the bottom of the list. 
Look for
 
 Natural, nontoxic: These products are healthy, nonsynthetic, and grown 
(not mixed).
 
 Low embodied energy: These products are easy to gather and 
nonpolluting.
 
 Sustainably harvested: These products are gathered without 
completely destroying the source.
 
 Recyclable/biodegradable: These products can be reused or fed back 
into the earth.
 
 Recycled content: These products contain a high percentage of materials 
that used to be something else.
 
 Locally harvested: These products didn’t travel more than 500 miles to 
reach you.
 
 Durable: These products are built to last and don’t require ongoing 
maintenance.
Feel free to rearrange these priorities to fit your own values. The key is to set 
these priorities before you find yourself standing in your home-improvement 
store or talking about products with your contractor. That way, you’re prepared 
for all the decisions you need to make.
 
Today, you have the option of dozens of green, healthy, and more responsible 
new materials. For every traditional, unhealthy finish you normally find in a 
building, a green substitute exists. In most cases, you can play this substitution 
game on a one-for-one basis. Table 2-1 provides some examples. (Remember: 
This list isn’t exhaustive — these items are just a few examples.)

cycle, you have the opportunity to improve on the impact and save money.

Remodeling an Old Home 
with Green Materials
Older homes pose certain challenges in remodeling. But not only do older 
buildings have a certain charm that their newer counterparts can’t fake, but 
remodeling an older home can save thousands of pounds of new items.
In the following sections, you find some of the common issues that come up 
in remodeling old homes. Don’t panic! These are normal issues for you to be 
on the lookout for.
Salvaging the wood
The studs in an older home are typically old growth wood, in true size 2-x-4-inch 
studs, and they’re very easy to salvage and reuse. The walls you remove may 
be over the existing wood floor and a simple refinishing will revive those old 
floors. But watch out! You can’t simply take old wood and use it to build a 
new structural wall. Consult with your architect or structural engineer before 
doing anything structural with salvaged wood.

327
 Chapter 2: Thinking about Building Materials in New Ways

Remodeling
 
Demolishing a few old walls is minor, but you’ll probably need a permit from 
your local building department.
Being aware of asbestos
Asbestos is a durable, insulating, fire-resistant material widely used from the 
1950s through the 1970s. When certain unusual cancer cases were attributed 
to asbestos, its use was banned. Old asbestos tiles may be lurking under your 
carpet or wood floor. That old resilient sheet flooring in your home may not 
be vinyl — if it’s more than 30 years old, the floor may be vinyl asbestos tile 
(VAT). Covering the side of your home may be asbestos shingles.
 
Asbestos is only an immediate threat if the material is broken, releasing 
fibers into the air. But exposure to asbestos dust is dangerous! If you own an 
older home and you’re planning to do any remodeling, check with your local 
building department for more information on asbestos abatement (removal). 
You may need a licensed asbestos abatement contractor to do the job. 
Asbestos cannot (and should not) be recycled. The licensed abatement con-
tractor will dispose of it for you.
Looking out for lead paint
For centuries, lead was used as a pigment and binding agent in most paints. 
Banned in 1978, lead-based paints were found to cause nervous system 
damage, hearing loss, stunted growth, reduced IQ, and delayed development. 
It’s especially dangerous to young children whose immune systems are still 
developing. Lead affects every organ in the body. And children aren’t the 
only ones at risk. Adults are not immune from the dangers of lead paint; for 
example, it can cause reproductive problems in men.
 
You’ve probably heard that lead-based paint is harmful to children because 
they eat large flakes of broken lead paint. That’s true, but a more insidious 
danger is that you and anyone else in your household may unknowingly 
inhale microscopic dust.
 
The most practical method of protecting everyone in your home from lead-based 
paint is to keep any old paint intact. Do not sand, scrape, or remove any old 
paint until you’re sure it isn’t lead based. You can buy a lead testing kit at your 
local hardware store. A licensed paint contractor can also help.
A professional lead-abatement specialist can remove lead-based paint in your 
home. Your local painter can provide referrals for these professionals.

 Identifying the hidden health dangers in your home
 Finding green alternatives to traditional building finishes
 Exploring new wall, floor, and counter finishes
P
erhaps no other aspect of green building garners more attention or 
excitement than the finishes inside the home; the multitude of tile, 
paint, and counter finishes make homeowners’ heads spin. In this chapter, 
you find out about your options for covering floors, walls, and ceilings. 
You also explore the necessary adhesives, caulks, and other materials lurk-
ing behind your walls. This chapter makes the daunting task of finding and 
selecting green finishes easier.
Identifying the Dangers 
in Traditional Finishes
Most standard construction materials contain a wide array of unhealthy or 
toxic chemicals. You don’t need to put these materials in your mouth to be 
affected by them; they release harmful chemicals into the room — a process 
called off-gassing.
Figure 3-1 shows some of these common chemicals hidden in your home, 
lurking behind the walls. Because you can’t see the chemicals, preventing 
them from entering your home is more of a challenge.

Volatile organic compounds
You know that new carpet or new paint smell? Not a good thing. In fact, what 
you’re sniffing are harmful chemicals known as volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs). When you install traditional products, they begin to evaporate and 
release these VOCs into the air, which results in that familiar odor. Even after 
the odor goes away, though, these materials continue to release VOCs.
 
Just because you can’t smell anything doesn’t mean the air is clear. The 
drying of paints, stains, caulks, and adhesives all can release VOCs into 
the air.
VOCs can refer to a large number of potentially harmful chemicals. The long-
term effects of exposure to VOCs are still not fully understood. Because the 
VOCs come from dozens of sources around your house, it’s impossible to 
point to one specific chemical or side effect.
Although you can’t see VOCs, if you build or remodel your home with low 
or no-VOC finishes, you notice a difference. A healthy, green home doesn’t 
smell.

Formaldehyde
One of the most common indoor pollutants is formaldehyde — the same 
chemical scientists use to preserve dead bodies. Formaldehyde is a known 
carcinogen (cancer-causing chemical). Formaldehyde-based adhesives are 
used throughout the construction process, from kitchen cabinets, to insula-
tion, to furniture. Small particles of formaldehyde continue to be released 
into the air years after these products have been installed.
Hidden Materials: What’s 
Behind the Walls
Hidden within your home, behind the walls and under the floors, lay dozens 
of materials that you probably don’t even think about. But these materials 
can have a major impact on your health and the environment. Finding health-
ier and more sustainable substitutes for these unseen materials is important.
Insulation
Inside the walls of your home is some sort of insulation, which helps hold in 
temperature to lower your heating and cooling bills and is the best way to 
save energy in your home. Generally, insulation is like a coat on a cold day — 
the thicker it is, the more comfortable you are inside.
For a new house, you should add as much insulation as will fit into the walls. 
For an existing home, adding insulation to finished walls is much more diffi-
cult. In either case, choose the insulation best for the health of you and your 
family.
 
Many different types of insulation are available. Generally, formaldehyde is 
used as a binding agent in most insulation products. Look for formaldehyde-
free products instead:
 
 Batt insulation: Choose formaldehyde-free and recycled cotton insulation. 
Bonded Logic (www.bondedlogic.com) offers recycled cotton insulation 
made from old blue jeans, making the insulation batts blue in color.
 
 Loose-fill cellulose: Choose natural cellulose made from recycled 
newsprint. It’s treated with natural chemicals to make it fire resistant. 
Cellulose is naturally formaldehyde free.
 
 Spray-in foams: Choose natural soy-based foams. They’re healthier and 
offer all the benefits of spray foam.

Book IV: Green Remodeling 
Sheathing
No matter what type of siding you have on your home, underneath it sits a 
hidden layer of plywood called sheathing. Sheathing adds strength to your 
walls and serves as a barrier to moisture.
The typical type of sheathing used is plywood, which comes from trees and 
is glued together with a toxic formaldehyde-based binder. As a green substi-
tute, select plywood that’s certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 
and is formaldehyde free.
Oriented-strand board (OSB) is an efficient alternative to plywood. OSB is made 
of small scraps of low-grade wood. As with any wood product, choosing FSC-
certified wood with formaldehyde-free glue is a good idea. Because plywood 
adds strength to your walls, you should check with your architect or structural 
engineer to see if OSB will provide enough strength for your project.
Certified wood: A look at the 
Forest Stewardship Council
The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is an 
international agency that promotes the use of 
sustainably harvested wood, which is wood 
gathered from well-managed forests.
Not all wood is created equal. Although struc-
tural lumber is stamped to indicate the quality 
and strength, you can’t determine whether a 
forest was clear-cut in order to get the wood. 
The FSC was created in 1993 to provide an inde-
pendent certification for just this reason. The 
FSC stamp is a guarantee that the wood came 
from a sustainably managed forest.
The FSC is an independent, not-for-profit, non-
government organization. The FSC sets stan-
dards that reflect agreed-upon principles for 
responsible forest management and accredits 
organizations that certify the achievement of 
those standards by specific forests or wood-
lands. These certifiers track each company 
and their supply chains back to FSC-certified 
sources. This chain of custody certification 
assures that consumers can trust the FSC seal.
The term chain of custody refers to the path 
taken by raw materials harvested from an FSC-
certified source through processing, manufac-
turing, and distribution until it is a final product 
ready for sale to the consumer. In the case of 
a house, this includes framing lumber, trim, or 
plywood. Any product made of wood is now 
available from an FSC-certified source.
The FSC has developed the following list of the 
Ten Principles of Forest Stewardship to address 
the issues and impacts surrounding forest man-
agement:
 
 Principle #1: Compliance with Laws and 
FSC Principles: Forest management shall 
respect all applicable laws of the country 
in which they occur, and international trea-
ties and agreements to which the country 
is a signatory, and comply with all FSC 
Principles and Criteria.
 
 Principle #2: Tenure and Use Rights and 
Responsibilities: Long-term tenure and use 

333
 Chapter 3: Green Finish and Construction Materials
Book IV

rights to the land and forest resources shall 
be clearly defined, documented, and legally 
established.
 
 Principle #3: Indigenous Peoples’ Rights: 
The legal and customary rights of indig-
enous peoples to own, use, and manage 
their lands, territories, and resources shall 
be recognized and respected.
 
 Principle #4: Community Relations and 
Workers’ Rights: Forest management 
operations shall maintain or enhance the 
long-term social and economic well being 
of forest workers and local communities.
 
 Principle #5: Benefits from the Forest: Forest 
management operations shall encourage 
the efficient use of the forest’s multiple 
products and services to ensure economic 
viability and a wide range of environmental 
and social benefits.
 
 Principle #6: Environmental Impact: Forest 
management shall conserve biological 
diversity and its associated values, water 
resources, soils, and unique and fragile 
ecosystems and landscapes, and, by so 
doing, maintain the ecological functions 
and the integrity of the forest.
 
 Principle #7: Management Plan: A man-
agement plan — appropriate to the scale 
and intensity of the operations — shall be 
written, implemented, and kept up to date. 
The long-term objectives of management, 
and the means of achieving them, shall be 
clearly stated.
 
 Principle #8: Monitoring and Assessment: 
Monitoring shall be conducted — appropri-
ate to the scale and intensity of forest man-
agement — to assess the condition of the 
forest, yields of forest products, chain of 
custody, management activities, and their 
social and environmental impacts.
 
 Principle #9: Maintenance of High 
Conservation Value Forests: Management 
activities in high conservation value for-
ests shall maintain or enhance the attri-
butes which define such forests. Decisions 
regarding high conservation value forests 
shall always be considered in the context 
of a precautionary approach.
 
 Principle #10: Plantations: Plantations 
shall be planned and managed in accor-
dance with Principles and Criteria 1–9, and 
Principle 10 and its Criteria. While planta-
tions can provide an array of social and 
economic benefits, and can contribute to 
satisfying the world’s needs for forest prod-
ucts, they should complement the manage-
ment of, reduce pressures on, and promote 
the restoration and conservation of natural 
forests.

Council, go to www.fsc.org.
Caulks and adhesives
The thousands of cracks and leaks in a typical home are filled with a sealant 
called caulk. Sealing these cracks is an important part of saving energy in a 
building, but these products are typically made from chemicals containing 
VOCs and are blown in using ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 
Adhesives are also used throughout a building in hundreds of hidden loca-
tions. These adhesives typically contain toxic chemicals containing VOCs.

334
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
 
Look for products with non-ozone-depleting blowing agents. Look for the 
term ozone-safe on the label. Also, choose water-based products with low-
VOC or zero-VOC content.
Stains and sealers
The countless stains, sealers, and lacquers used in a home typically go unno-
ticed. Because they’re traditionally oil-based, when you use these products, 
you have to wear gloves and a mask. After installation, they continue to give 
off fumes for years — sometimes many years — and unless you’re wearing a 
mask 24/7, you’re breathing in those fumes.
 
Choose water-based and low-VOC or zero-VOC products instead. You’ll be 
thankful for the headache you don’t get after using them.
All-natural linseed oil (made from flaxseed) is a healthy and effective sealant 
for wall and floor surfaces. Just make sure to avoid linseed oils mixed with 
drying agents; these add unnecessary toxins to the air. Natural beeswax is a 
wonderful finish for plaster, concrete, and furniture.
Constructing and Covering Your Walls
Whether the walls of your home are constructed out of traditional wood 
framing or built green out of straw bales, all your walls must be completed 
with some protective and decorative finish. This section introduces you to 
the various types of wall finishes available and lets you know what to look for 
when you’re shopping.
Paints and coatings
Some 40,000 years ago, people covered their walls with early cave paintings 
drawn with natural pigments of red ochre and charcoal. Although we still deco-
rate our walls, paint has evolved into the ubiquitous finish for all our interiors.
Paint poses some potential health concerns because it consists of pigments 
held together with a binding agent. These binding agents contain VOCs, 
which are released into the air.
 
Nearly all the major paint manufacturers now offer a low-VOC line of paints, 
but be careful: The term low is hard to define. Check the labels for the exact 
content of VOCs. Instead of low-VOC, purchase zero-VOC paints from healthy-
paint manufacturers such as AFM Safecoat (www.afmsafecoat.com or 
Mythic (www.mythicpaint.com).

335
 Chapter 3: Green Finish and Construction Materials
Book IV
Green 
Remodeling
 
Always wear gloves and a respirator mask while painting, especially if you’re 
using a paint sprayer. After painting, open the windows and flush the home 
with fresh air for a few days. All these measures will lead to a healthier and 
happier home.
Recycle or donate all your leftover paint. Your local salvage yard or hard-
ware store may take back your remaining gallons. Never dump paint down the 
drain. You can dispose of it safely, however, by letting it dry first. After it has 
completely solidified (just leave off the lid for several days), you can put it in 
with your regular trash.
Earthen plaster
As an alternative to paint, earthen plaster is a beautiful finish for your walls. 
Made from a pure mix of clay and natural pigments, earthen plaster is also 
healthy and naturally mold resistant.
The plaster is applied directly onto drywall with a trowel and can be finished 
smooth or with a heavy texture for a variety of looks. Applying earthen plas-
ter is surprisingly easy to do yourself, and you can keep any leftover plaster 
and reuse it in the future simply by adding some water.
 
You can use plaster in a damp area such as a bathroom, but make sure that 
you seal with a water-based sealer any areas that may get splashed.
Wall coverings
For something more interesting than a solid color of paint, wall coverings 
offer a way to introduce patterns and textures into your home. Unfortunately, 
most wallpaper is made of vinyl, an environmentally harmful product.
 
Skip the vinyl and instead look at the large number of beautiful options avail-
able. Natural fibers, such as jute and raffia, create a soft texture on your 
walls. Natural paper wall coverings are available from several manufacturers, 
with an incredible assortment of colors and patterns. Old-fashioned wallpa-
per paste is already natural and healthy, so choose it over synthetic brands.
 
If you’re thinking about putting wallpaper in a damp location such as a bath-
room, you may want to reconsider. If water seeps into the wallpaper, mold 
can grow undetected under the paper, creating a health hazard.

336
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
Drywall
Drywall, also known as gypsum wallboard, is one of the most common materi-
als used in construction today. All the walls in your home are likely covered 
with drywall, which you’ve coated in paint or wallpaper. Drywall accounts for 
more than a quarter of all construction waste. Its chief ingredient, gypsum, has 
to be mined out of the earth and requires an immense amount of energy to pro-
duce. All this effort gives off carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
 
Drywall made from recycled and synthetic gypsum is readily available; 
you just have to ask for it. The backing is made from 100 percent recycled, 
unbleached paper that’s bonded without adhesives onto a gypsum core.
 
Keep in mind that the boards come in standard heights of 8 feet, 9 feet, and 
10 feet. Designing to those ceiling heights will reduce cutting and waste, and 
save you money as well.
Wood paneling and cabinetry
Wood adds a warm and visually interesting finish to any room. A thin veneer, 
or skin, of real wood is typically glued over a panel of compressed particle-
board to create wood paneling. Although this process uses less wood than 
solid pieces, the particleboard is commonly held together with urea-formal-
dehyde, a known carcinogen and health hazard.
 
Request formaldehyde-free particleboard for your panels and cabinets 
as a healthier option. For the veneer, select woods certified by the Forest 
Stewardship Council (FSC) to ensure that the wood has come from a sustain-
able source. Avoid tropical hardwoods — they come from the rain forest and 
contribute to its destruction. Panels of solid bamboo, a grass, are a greener 
and unique alternative.
Wall base and trim
The trim molding lining the walls at the floor, and possibly the ceiling, of your 
home serves two purposes:
 
 Trim adds elegance and style to any room.
 
 Trim covers the edges of the wall plaster where it meets the floor or ceiling.
Use trim made from small scraps of wood finger-jointed together. After you 
paint it, you’ll never see the joints.

337
 Chapter 3: Green Finish and Construction Materials

Avoid vinyl and fiberglass trim entirely; both are bad for your health and the 
environment.
Choosing Greener Floor Finishes
The floors of your home reflect the function and purpose of each room. A 
wood floor conveys a more formal feeling; carpet is more about comfort and 
walking around with your shoes off.
Because the floor covers such a large area, it has a huge influence on the 
indoor air quality in your home. Your kids, guests, and pets walk on your 
floors, wearing them down and breathing in the chemicals they give off. In 
this section, you find greener and healthier alternatives for flooring.
Wood flooring
Because they’re easy to clean, hardwood floors are great for indoor air qual-
ity and for people with allergies. Traditional wood flooring comes from — 
drum roll, please — trees. (Shocking, isn’t it?) Although wood is a renewable 
resource (people can plant more trees), wood used for flooring is typically 
harvested from the clearcutting of forests — removing all the trees in an area. 
More sustainably harvested options are available, coming from sources 
where no trees were clearcut or harmed to make your floor.
 
Look for wood certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Anything 
certified by the FSC came from a managed forest — not from clearcutting. 
Expect to pay 20 percent more for sustainably harvested wood.
 
If you choose floors that have been prefinished at the factory, those chemi-
cals won’t have to be brought into your home. If you do stain or seal the 
floors, choose low-VOC or zero-VOC, water-based products.
Reclaimed wood
Reclaimed wood is salvaged from unusual sources, such as old barns, train 
trestles, or bridges in the process of being demolished. Although all wood 
flooring is warm, these recycled woods add particular warmth to a room 
because of their weathering and flaws. Because it’s salvaged from older build-
ings, reclaimed wood was originally from old-growth trees, so the quality of 
the wood is far superior to anything available today. The rich wood grain of 
this old-growth wood is incredibly beautiful. Reclaimed wood commonly con-
tains old rust stains, nail holes, or patched joints, all of which add character 
and charm to the wood’s appearance.

338
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
With the rising cost of new wood, more building suppliers now offer 
reclaimed and salvaged wood options. The energy needed to salvage the 
wood is still far less than the impact of clear-cutting new trees.
Bamboo
In the past few years, bamboo has become the best known and most popular 
of the green flooring options. Technically, bamboo is not wood — it’s a grass, 
and some species can grow up to 3 feet in a day. To harvest it, the stalks are 
cut, leaving the plant intact to continue to grow. Unlike with wood, nothing 
is killed or destroyed in the process, which is what makes bamboo such an 
environmentally attractive option.
Unfortunately, most bamboo comes from Asia, and shipping it such long 
distances requires a great deal of energy. More local sources are now 
becoming available.
Although many people imagine an island hut when they think of bamboo, the 
finished bamboo floor closely resembles traditional wood flooring. It installs 
in the exact same way, and you may not even notice the distinctive knuckle 
pattern in the bamboo. The grain is incredibly durable, and it’s stronger than 
oak, one of the strongest woods.
Like most floors, bamboo flooring is available in a prefinished surface, 
reducing the need to add sealers or coatings. Be sure to select water-based 
and low- or zero-VOC sealers.
Laminated wood
Laminate flooring is a durable particleboard base covered with a plastic 
photograph of wood grain. The result is an incredibly durable, nearly 
indestructible floor perfect for high-traffic areas. The planks arrive already 
finished, so no extra sealing is required.
 
Although the particleboard is mostly compressed sawdust, it is held together 
with a binder of formaldehyde, a known toxin. Look for formaldehyde-free 
wood, sourced with wood certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). 
Seal the cut edges of the planks to prevent the formaldehyde from being 
released into the air.
Laminate flooring options made from bamboo are also available.
Carpeting
Carpeting is the ubiquitous floor covering in the United States, desired as 
much for its texture as for its ability to cover a variety of hidden sins. Carpet 
provides a soft, warm, and sound-absorbing surface. Combine all that with 

339
 Chapter 3: Green Finish and Construction Materials
Book IV

carpeting’s low cost per square foot, and you see why it’s the most-selected 
floor covering in the country, covering 70 percent of American floors.
However, in its short life span, carpet attracts dust and allergens. Once con-
sidered the status symbol of a luxurious home, carpet is now among a long 
list of related indoor air-quality problems and material-waste issues. (Nearly 
5 billion pounds of discarded carpet end up in landfills each year.)
In the 1990s, after receiving more than 500 complaints about carpet-related 
health effects, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) com-
missioned a study examining carpet chemical emissions. The landmark study 
identified dozens of toxic chemicals released from carpets, many of them 
known carcinogens. That “new carpet smell” is the smell of chemicals being 
released into the air.
 
Carpet, especially wall-to-wall carpet, has several inherent environmental issues:
 
 It is typically made from synthetic, oil-based materials. These materi-
als are considered toxic, they release harmful chemicals, and we’re 
depleting natural resources to utilize them.
 
 Carpet is typically backed with vinyl (PVC). Vinyl is harmful at every 
stage of its life cycle.
 
 The synthetic and mixed materials make carpet (nearly) impossible to 
recycle. Efforts are afoot to create recycling opportunities; however, at 
this point billions of pounds of carpet are ending up in landfills each year.
 
 Carpet requires a great deal of energy to maintain, because it must 
be vacuumed. More electricity to vacuum means more burning of fossil 
fuels, in most cases.
 
 Vacuuming alone does not clean carpet and instead creates an envi-
ronment in which pests, mold, and mildew can reside. Carpet is host 
to numerous indoor air-quality issues, including the spread of asthma.
Luckily, a select group of carpet manufacturers have addressed some or all of 
these issues. Some of these initiatives include such wonderful ideas as
 
 Carpet made from natural, renewable fibers and materials.
 
 Carpet backed with natural, healthy materials like wool.
 
 Take-back programs, where the manufacturers accept the carpet at the 
end of its use and recycle it back into their supply chain.
 
 Carpet tile, which is an environmentally preferable alternative to wall-
to-wall carpeting, because damaged tiles can be individually replaced 
without having to replace an entire floor (Although it takes more energy 
to produce the tiles, several manufacturers, such as FLOR [www.flor.
com], produce a recycled content and recyclable carpet tile in a wide 
array of interesting colors and patterns.)

340
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
Used sparingly at entranceways, you can use carpet to control pollutants 
being tracked into a building.
Cork
Harvested from the bark of an oak cork tree, cork is considered a rapidly 
renewable material, because it grows back in just five to seven years without 
harming the tree. Most people imagine a corkboard when they think of cork 
floors, but in reality, cork flooring comes in a wide array of gorgeous patterns 
and styles and has been in use for well over 50 years. (The famed architect 
Frank Lloyd Wright often installed cork in his kitchens.) Cork flooring is sur-
prisingly durable, providing an attractive, healthy, and biodegradable surface 
for your home.
The prefinished tiles provide a soft and comfortable walking surface, giving 
off a pleasant hickory smell. The cork naturally resists water, making it a 
great choice for kitchens and bathrooms.
Although all-natural cork is sustainably harvested, it typically comes from 
Mediterranean countries, requiring a lot of energy to transport it. Several 
manufacturers now offer cork flooring made in the United States from recy-
cled wine bottle corks, reducing the travel distance.
 
Be sure to avoid cork flooring backed or mixed with vinyl. Choose a zero-VOC 
adhesive to install and seal the surface with a natural wax twice a year.
Vinyl tile
At first glance, vinyl flooring seems like a great material. Inexpensive, easy to 
install, and durable, vinyl is one of the most popular flooring choices — 14 
billion pounds of it are produced each year in North America alone. But the 
reality of vinyl shows it to be a health hazard at every stage of its life: Vinyl 
releases poisonous dioxins into the atmosphere when it’s produced, gives off 
very harmful chemicals after it’s installed, and is nearly impossible to recycle.
 
Vinyl is the most environmentally destructive material used in buildings 
today. Unfortunately, vinyl is found in hundreds of building products. From 
plumbing pipes to flooring to wall base, vinyl is everywhere. Because it’s so 
bad throughout its life cycle, avoid it at all costs.
Linoleum
Invented in 1860 by rubber manufacturer Fredrick Walton, linoleum quickly 
became the floor and wall covering of choice for Victorian homes, and has 

341
 Chapter 3: Green Finish and Construction Materials
Book IV
Green 
Remodeling
been in use ever since. Though vinyl tiles replaced linoleum in popularity 
back in the 1960s, the surging interest in green materials is helping linoleum 
make a comeback.
Linoleum is a natural product made of linseed oil, pigments, pine rosin, and 
pine flour (sawdust). It’s covered with a natural jute backing. The finished 
material is thin and incredibly durable. It becomes harder in areas of high 
traffic. A linoleum floor can last 50 years.
As a green alternative to vinyl, linoleum offers numerous other advantages. 
The color and patterns are dyed all the way through to the backing, ensuring 
that the floor will not wear away. Linoleum is natural, making it biodegradable 
as well. Linseed oil is a natural antimicrobial agent, making it a great choice for 
kitchens.
Be sure to purchase only “natural linoleum,” because the term linoleum is 
sometimes mistakenly used to refer to a generic vinyl floor. Avoid installing 
linoleum in damp areas, such as basements. Use only low-VOC or zero-VOC 
adhesives to install it.
Concrete
Sometimes you don’t need to install any floor at all. Leaving the concrete slab 
exposed is a great way to save money on additional flooring. Generally, your 
contractor takes more care in finishing concrete that will remain exposed. 
In addition, numerous finishing options — from stains to pigments to acid 
etching — offer a wide variety of design flexibility.
 
In order to control cracking, a small joint is cut into the concrete every 20 
feet or so. You can arrange these cuts, called control joints, in interesting 
patterns and angles for more visual interest.
Earthen floors
Perhaps the most environmentally friendly flooring option is good, old-fash-
ioned dirt or earth. Called an earthen floor, it offers some interesting options.
Technically, a true modern-day earthen floor comes in various mixtures. 
Some are a mix of cement and earth (as in rammed-earth construction). The 
type of earth chosen makes a large difference in the durability. For example, 
the more clay content in the earth, the more susceptible it is to cracking from 
changes in water content. (The clay expands and contracts quite a bit.)
If you’re buying commercial-grade soils for this floor, you can select a plastic-
ity index to select the exact amount of clay content. Most single-family houses 

342
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
just collect soil left over from the excavation for the house. The correct soil 
will stabilize and prevent cracking — but there are no guarantees.
 
Be sure to seal the floor when it’s complete. The best sealer available is 
simply boiled linseed oil, thinned with turpentine and brushed on in several 
coats. Its odor is gone in a week.
Earthen floors are the perfect complement for radiant heat. The thermal 
mass of the earth stores the heat and maintains a nice, consistent tempera-
ture all winter long. You could also use the same system for radiant cooling, 
by running cool water through the same tubes.
Checking Out the Options 
for Countertops
No other finish seems to get people as excited as countertops. Most people 
don’t have strong feelings about toilet fixtures, roofing material, or exterior 
siding, but their eyes always light up when they talk about countertops.
People have an intimate connection with their countertops; you touch them 
and look at them every day. In recent years, countertops have become a bit 
of a status symbol for homeowners — granite, for some reason, has become 
the countertop of choice for high-end builders and, thus, for high-end kitch-
ens. Granite is both lovely and natural, but many equally beautiful alterna-
tives are out there. This section runs down the options.
Granite and stone
Stone has a natural and timeless quality. It has a reputation as being too 
expensive for the average person, but the truth is that stone comes in a wide 
range of varieties and prices. Stone also has varying degrees of environmen-
tal impact. Marble and granite are mined deep out of the earth, but other 
stones (such as sandstone, slate, and soapstone) can be locally quarried 
without the same damage to the earth.
Natural stone is an elegant and durable finish. Unfortunately, stone is nonre-
newable (we can’t make more of it), and it requires huge amounts of energy 
to quarry, finish, transport, and install. The most popular stone types — 
granite, marble, sandstone, and limestone — must be transported long dis-
tances, using large amounts of energy. The impact from quarrying, cutting, 
and polishing the stone requires even more energy. The dust from the stone 
cutting is irritating and polluting.

343
 Chapter 3: Green Finish and Construction Materials
Book IV
Green 
Remodeling
 
As an alternative, look for salvaged stone. Your local salvage yard carries 
some countertops saved from demolition. Salvaged stone is much less expen-
sive, but provides a limited choice of colors.
Stone is sold in large slabs, not in pieces. When only a part of a slab is used, 
the remaining pieces are left behind. Every stone and marble yard has what 
they call a boneyard where these leftovers are placed. These pieces save you 
money, and they offer more variety. As long as you don’t need a large amount 
of the same type of stone, the boneyard is a great place to find stone.
Seal the stone as needed with a low-VOC and water-based sealer or select 
stone that doesn’t require sealing.
Many types of stone — especially marble, sandstone, limestone, and slate — 
are surprisingly soft, and they scratch and absorb stains easily. Granite is 
stronger and more scratch- and stain-resistant.
Dispose of leftover and discarded stone by giving it to a salvage yard. Stone 
tiles can be reused or crushed into aggregate for concrete.
Terrazzo
Terrazzo is made up of small pieces of marble set into cement and highly pol-
ished. Odds are, you’ve walked on a terrazzo floor. They’re common in public 
buildings — museums, airports, hotels, and so on — so you know terrazzo 
countertops are durable. Countertops made from glass instead of marble are 
often called Vetrazzo (from vitreous glass), or glass terrazzo, and it reflects 
light in the most beautiful way. The result is a surface so beautiful you won’t 
notice that this particular glass happens to be made from recycled beverage 
bottles. You can choose the colors of the glass and the cement binder, giving 
you an endless list of possibilities. The surface is durable, heatproof, and 
easy to maintain. The cost is similar to granite, and it can be cut into shapes 
just like stone.
Paper resin
Made from paper and a resin binder, composite countertops have a warm, 
neutral look that fits well with most decorating styles. This material looks 
similar to other popular solid-surface countertops like Corian, but because 
it’s only about one-third plastic, it has a more natural look and feel. Many 
people compare paper resin to soapstone. The material is very practical — 
it’s not hard enough to dull knives, but it’s dense enough to resist slice marks 
that can harbor bacteria.

344
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
 
Companies such as Richlite (www.richlite.com/countertop) and 
PaperStone Products (www.paperstoneproducts.com) offer products 
made out of recycled paper, so ask for the highest recycled content available.
As with concrete or any formed surface, special features can be incorporated 
into the countertops, such as a drain board next to an under-mount sink, or 
casting metal rods near the stove, creating a built-in trivet.
Concrete
Concrete is a natural product and, as such, has a natural beauty. A chemical 
mixture of cement, sand, and water, concrete is durable and doesn’t release 
harmful chemicals.
Because concrete is a formed material, you can have special features incor-
porated into a concrete countertop, such as a drain board next to an under-
mount sink, or a small depression cast into the surface to create a soap dish. 
With an infinite variety of colors, shapes, and textures, concrete is one of the 
more interesting surfaces you see in a kitchen. The drawback is that it can be 
expensive, depending on the shape.
Solid surfacing
Solid surfacing is a type of acrylic epoxy plastic mixture formed into large, 
continuous surfaces. Because the entire counter can be formed at once, 
other elements are often formed into it as well, such as sinks and back-
splashes. The color runs through the entire material, so it won’t show wear. 
Inexpensive and durable, solid surfacing is one of the most popular counter-
top materials.
Because these products are made from plastic, issues around health and sus-
tainability have been raised. Every major manufacturer of solid surfacing now 
offers a line of recycled-content products. Typically, the recycled material 
comes from their own scraps that have been reground back into the mixture 
(post-industrial content). Pick the brand with the highest recycled content; 
unfortunately, even the highest is still fairly low, around 15 percent.
As an inexpensive alternative to granite, solid surfacing is now available 
mixed with chips of real stone, usually quartz. Often called engineered stone, 
the surface looks like granite but feels different to the touch and uses much 
less energy to produce. The surface has a more uniform appearance, a give-
away that it isn’t real stone. Because quartz can’t be cut into large slabs, 
crumbling bits of quartz are instead used in this mixture.

345
 Chapter 3: Green Finish and Construction Materials
Book IV

Remodeling
Although pure solid surfacing is 100 percent plastic, engineered surfaces are 
mostly stone, usually around 94 percent. (The rest is plastic.) Choose the prod-
uct with the highest amount of recycled stone available, such as those manu-
factured by Silestone (www.silestoneusa.com). Although engineered stone 
is not the greenest product available, it is greener than pure solid surfacing.
Plastic laminate
In the 1950s, plastic laminate was all the rage, but by the 1960s, it was begin-
ning to shows its age. Strange patterns, toxic glues, and frayed edges began 
to show the drawbacks of plastic laminate, but people still ask for it.
To make plastic laminate, slim layers of acrylic plastic are bonded onto a 
wood backing. This thin sheet is glued down onto a plywood base to create a 
countertop. The plastic, adhesives, and resins pose potential health risks.
 
If you must choose a laminate, abaca is a wonderful alternative. Made from 
recycled banana fibers on a hemp backing, abaca laminates have an organic, 
natural texture. Use nontoxic adhesives to glue the laminate to the plywood. 
As a nice detail, place a solid strip of wood along the edge for a more finished 
appearance.
Countertop refacing
Give the countertops you have a facelift without having to chuck the old ones 
(or suffer through time-consuming installation) by refacing them. A water-
based spray sticks to your old laminate or formica countertops, contains no 
VOCs, and takes just a few hours to apply. You can choose from a whole slew 
of colors and feel good about working with what you have instead of buying 
new. Find out more or locate a dealer at www.ecocountertopsusa.com.
Running Down Other Finishes
From accent tiles to wall panels, countless other green finishes are available 
to decorate your home.
 
Be sure to explore the life cycle impact of any product you’re considering for 
your home (see Chapter 2).

Ceramic tile
For thousands of years, ceramic tiles have been used for flooring and wall 
tiles. Although it requires a great deal of energy to produce, ceramic tile is 
durable and recyclable, made from natural clay.
Look for locally sourced quarry tiles — they require less energy. Make sure 
that natural glazes have been used; unglazed tiles are course and porous. As 
a fun alternative, ask your local tile warehouse for any damaged or dropped 
boxes. You can arrange broken tiles into a mosaic pattern for a beautiful finish.
Set the tiles into cement grout instead of adhesives to avoid adding VOCs 
into the air. Choose a colored grout instead of white to hide dirt; the grout 
lines are difficult to keep clean. Seal the completed tile and grout with a 
water-based sealer.
With careful planning, you can design the bathroom to fit the spacing of the 
tile. Doing this lets you avoid cutting, looks much better, and reduces waste. 
If you must cut tiles, do it outside to keep the dust out of the indoor air.
If properly installed, ceramic tile can last 50 years or more, and it biode-
grades after removal. Tiles can be reused if carefully removed or crushed and 
recycled into aggregate filler for concrete.
Glass
Glass is an all-natural product, made of silica (sand) and melted into a vari-
ety of shapes, colors, and types. Because glass is healthy and can be found 
locally, glass is a fairly green product. Manufacturing glass does require some 
energy, so recycled glass is an even better option.
Recycled glass tiles are gorgeous and gemlike, and they’re a great choice for 
a backsplash or shower wall. Recycled glass is produced from recycled wind-
shields, bottles, and windows crushed to a sandlike texture and mixed with 
other ingredients, including minerals that add color. This mixture is then 
heated until the glass particles soften and fuse on their edges. This process 
uses far less energy than standard glass or ceramic tile manufacturing. Made 
from a mixture of sources, these recycled tiles contain slight imperfections 
and bubbles, adding character.
 
The color of the grout shows through some of the clear tiles, so choose a 
grout color carefully.

Metal
Environmentally speaking, metal is incredibly durable and easily recyclable. 
Unfortunately, metal production is incredibly harmful to the environment. 
From mining the minerals to the energy needed to melt it down to the green-
house gases released from this process, metal has a huge negative impact.
Different types of metal vary in their impact. Copper, for example, is destruc-
tively mined using slave labor in South America. Aluminum requires mining 
of bauxite, an incredibly polluting process. Stainless steel is different from 
steel — it’s a combination alloy of steel, chromium, and nickel designed to 
resist rust, and the chromium is highly polluting and toxic.
Because of high manufacturing costs, most metals now contain some amount 
of recycled content, so just be sure to look for the highest amount available. 
Several companies produce tiles, sinks, and other finishes made of 100 per-
cent recycled metal.
Both durable and hygienic, metal finishes resist heat and staining. Using flat 
stainless steel sheeting and adding a natural wood edge reduces costs and 
eases installation.
 
Metal scratches and shows fingerprints very easily, so be sure you like that 
look before you buy.
Resins and plastics
Rigid plastic panels are typically produced from a polyester resin, made 
from oil, toxic in their production, and difficult to recycle. Several companies 
now offer greener alternatives with recycled and recyclable options. One 
company, 3-Form (www.3-form.com), refers to its product as an eco-resin to 
describe its patented, environmentally friendly manufacturing processes.
 
Choose panels with the highest recycled content available. An infinite array of 
options, colors, shapes, and thicknesses is available. Panels are a stronger and 
more colorful alternative to fragile glass, making them a great choice for kid-
proof windows, attractive shower enclosures, and unusual cabinet doors. Ask 
the manufacturer about standard panel sizes to reduce cutting and waste.
Finding Ecofriendly Furnishings
No home is complete without furniture, and several green options are avail-
able. Shop carefully and don’t be afraid to ask questions. Although finding a 
green floor may be easy, furnishings are more difficult. With so many options 

348
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
available, knowing what to ask or where to look is tough. This section points 
you in the right direction.
Furniture
Chairs, tables, and sofas are typically made of cheap particleboard, finished 
with oil-based lacquers, and stuffed with toxic foam. You can smell these 
chemicals when you unwrap a new piece of furniture.
 
With any furniture, look for the following green features:
 
 Reclaimed: Reusing materials salvaged from other uses, reclaimed mate-
rials offer old-material quality no longer available. Example: Wood from 
old wine barrels milled into chairs.
 
 Recycled: Unlike reclaimed materials, recycled materials are put back into 
the material production and reprocessed into new finishes. Sourced from 
various materials, recycled materials often have slight imperfections that 
add to the final appearance. Example: Metal tables from recycled metal.
 
 Sustainably harvested: Yielding materials without completely destroy-
ing the chance for future harvesting, sustainably harvested materials 
will be around for future generations. Example: Bamboo furniture, Forest 
Stewardship Council (FSC) certified.
 
 Natural materials: Instead of cushions stuffed with synthetic materials 
containing harmful chemicals, look for those with natural latex.
 
 Nontoxic finishes: Most furniture is finished with oil-based lacquers; 
instead, use water-based finishes and adhesives free of VOCs.
Looking for these options will also ensure a healthier home. Companies such 
as Vivavi (www.vivavi.com) and Furnature (www.furnature.com) offer 
only products with these green features.
 
The most sustainable choice is buying used furniture. Haunt garage sales, flea 
markets, resale shops, and antique stores to find your greenest furniture options.
Draperies and fabrics
The fabrics making up your drapes, curtains, and sofa coverings are typically 
dyed with polluting pigments on synthetic fabric.
Natural fabrics, such as organic cotton, hemp, linen, and natural wool, offer 
healthier alternatives. Exciting new fabrics made from polylactic acid (PLA) 
are becoming more available. PLA is a natural material made from corn; it’s 
recyclable and biodegradable. Companies like Terratex (www.teratex.com) 
offer PLA-based fabrics.

Examining Exterior Finishes and Trim
Although you don’t need to worry about indoor air issues with exterior mate-
rials, you have other issues to consider. Anything outside is exposed to the 
weather, so you need to choose durable materials. Outside, anything painted 
needs to be repainted every few years, so save yourself the work and choose 
materials that can be left exposed and unpainted.
Siding
For many people, vinyl siding is considered the best material to use in 
covering your home. After all, it’s durable and cheap, and it never needs 
painting. Unfortunately, the environmental issues with the manufacturing and 
disposal of vinyl make it a terrible choice. The following sections run down 
some alternatives.
Aluminum siding
Popular in the 1940s and 1950s, aluminum siding offered a maintenance-free 
option for your home. When less expensive vinyl siding was introduced, it 
forced aluminum siding from the market. Older aluminum siding is easily recy-
cled, but finding a source for new siding made of recycled content is difficult.
Wood siding
Both vinyl and aluminum siding are designed to copy the look of real wood 
siding. The best choice is wood certified by the Forest Stewardship Council 
(FSC) to be sustainably harvested. Instead of paint, finish the planks with a 
water-based stain to allow the beauty of the wood to show through.
Cedar shingles
Cedar shingles are an attractive and natural option for siding. Cedar forests 
are disappearing rapidly, so look for shingles made from reclaimed or FSC-
certified wood.
 
Shingles don’t need to be placed in straight lines. Arranging them in curves 
can be a fun and interesting way to cover your home.
Fiber cement boards
Fiber cement boards are rigid panels made of Portland cement, sand, wood fiber, 
and clay. They’re a durable and attractive siding option. Although they hold 
paint well, the panels can be left unfinished if you don’t mind the gray color. 
James Hardie (www.jameshardie.com/homeowner) is the largest manufac-
turer of fiber cement boards, but several other manufacturers offer fiber cement 
boards as well. The product is available in shingles, boards, and long planks for a 
variety of design options. Many manufacturers offer a wood grain or sand finish.

Book IV: Green Remodeling 
Stucco
Stucco is a cement-based product and must be applied or sprayed on by 
hand. Traditional stucco is really just cement-based plaster — a mixture of 
Portland cement, lime, sand, and water.
 
Stucco is typically applied in three coats: a rough scratch coat, a secondary 
base coat, and then a finish coat, for a total thickness of about 3 ⁄4 inch. If you 
apply the stucco over a brick or concrete wall, you don’t need a scratch coat.
 
Synthetic stucco, made from acrylic, is now typically used in place of cement-
based stucco. If you use synthetic stucco, you have to use a thin fiberglass 
mesh. Stick with the natural cement stucco instead.
Although stucco can be painted, an integral color can be mixed into the finish 
coat, making painting unnecessary. Don’t be afraid to select bright colors. 
Stucco is available in much more than tan, with a wide palette of fun colors. 
Although the cement requires a great deal of energy to produce, the long life 
and ease of maintenance make stucco a very green choice for your home.
Decking
A well-designed deck can open up a room and allow you the chance to get 
some fresh air. From staining to dry rot and splinters, traditional decks can 
be a maintenance headache. Green options can solve some of these issues. 
Encourage outdoor living with the durable, low-maintenance decking alterna-
tives in the following sections.
Certified wood
If you go with wood, be sure to use wood certified by the Forest Stewardship 
Council. The FSC stamp ensures this wood has been sustainably harvested. 
The most popular traditional decking material, redwood, typically comes 
from old-growth trees and cannot be replaced. Save these irreplaceable red-
wood trees and look for FSC-certified redwood instead.
 
Wood framing used outside is typically pressure treated with chromated 
copper arsenate (CCA) — a form of arsenic (not exactly healthy for you or 
anyone else). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has now banned 
CCA wood, but it’s still in use, especially in children’s playgrounds. Look for 
wood treated with the healthier ammoniacal copper quaternary (ACQ).
Composite lumber
Combining recycled plastic and sawdust, composite lumbers are much 
healthier and more environmentally friendly than wood. They don’t warp, 
splinter, or need staining.

351
 Chapter 3: Green Finish and Construction Materials
Book IV
Green 
Remodeling
The maintenance savings alone is reason enough to consider composite 
lumber. Composite lumber is available from dozens of manufacturers; look 
for the companies that offer the highest recycled content planks.
Ipe wood
Ipe wood is an attractive alternative to the typical redwood or teak decking. 
The strength and natural water resistance of ipe makes it a great choice for a 
durable deck. As always, FSC-certified ipe wood is the greenest option.
Reclaimed beams (railroad ties)
Salvaged ties from old railroad tracks are available and attractive, and they 
don’t require any new trees to be made.
Because they were manufactured to be used outside, railroad ties are pres-
sure-treated with CCA. Coat them with two coats of a water-based sealer to 
seal in the CCA. Sealants will keep most of the harmful chemicals from soak-
ing into your skin when you touch the wood. Maintain the coat every few 
years to stay protected.
Roofing
A roof’s job is to keep out the water, but the choice of roof can greatly alter 
the appearance and energy efficiency of your home. Here are some options 
for keeping out the rain:
 
 Asphalt shingles: Nearly two-thirds of all roofs, both new and existing, 
are clad in asphalt shingles. Each year, about 11 million tons of asphalt 
roofing shingle waste is generated in the United States. Although recy-
cled shingles are available, they aren’t the best choice. Their dark color 
absorbs heat in the summer, heating up your home.
 
 If you plan on collecting the rainwater from the roof, the oil in the 
asphalt shingles will make the water undrinkable. Opt for another type 
of roofing instead.
 
 Recycled rubber roofing: Nearly 300 million car tires are thrown away 
in the United States each year — that’s nearly one per person. Dozens 
of companies recycle these tires into rubber shingles. These durable 
and resource-efficient shingles are a good choice. However, like asphalt, 
these shingles will contaminate the rainwater as it falls on the roof.
 
 Recycled plastic and metal shingles: The large amount of recycled 
plastic and metal available has prompted manufacturers to create some 
great roofing products. Recycled plastic shingles look surprisingly like 
natural slate. Lightweight and affordable, they’re a great option for your 
roof. Recycled metal shingles are also available, offering a reflective and 
attractive pattern.

352
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
 
 When installing metal outside, never mix your metals. A copper roof 
must be installed with copper nails; a zinc roof with zinc nails.
 
 Spray-on foam roofing: Spray-on foam roofing, such as poly-isocyanu-
rate (or poly-iso, for short) is the perfect choice for flat roofs. Once dry, 
these foams provide a seamless, continuous roof surface that will never 
leak and that’s durable enough to walk on. The light yellow color of the 
foam is not very attractive, so you’ll probably only want to use it on flat 
roof locations that aren’t visible from ground level. But the light color 
does reflect heat to keep your home cool.
 
No matter what type of roof you choose, select the lightest color available. 
A dark roof absorbs heat, adding to your cooling costs in the summer. If you 
live in a warm climate, this issue is even more important.
Remodeling: Bringing Old 
Materials to Life
Remodeling your home is a form of recycling. Reusing an existing building, 
instead of building something new, saves energy and resources.
The old appliances you remove are easily salvaged or sold. The sinks and 
tubs removed can be reused. If your existing toilet is a low-flush model, keep 
it and reuse it; if not, these old fixtures can be ground up and added as an 
aggregate into concrete.
Salvage yards offer possible treasures waiting to be found. Antique light fix-
tures, claw-foot tubs, and historic fireplace mantles are common finds in a 
salvage yard.
 
While paint strippers can bring new life to old furniture and fixtures, the 
chemicals they use are typically some of the harshest you can imagine. 
Although they require more elbow grease, electric sanders and strippers are 
a healthier choice. For stubborn or hard-to-clean surfaces, new products, 
such as SoyGel (www.franmar.com), offer a natural and chemical-free alter-
native to paint strippers.
Before the remodeling work begins, seal all the existing ducts and vents, 
which prevents dirt from traveling through the home. In order to remove the 
dust and chemicals stirred up by the remodeling project, tell your contractor 
to seal off the area to be remodeled with plastic sheeting and leave it up until 
the project is finished. Finally, when the project is complete, open all the 
windows to flush the home with fresh air for a few days; doing so removes a 
large portion of the VOCs and chemicals in the home.

O
ne of the best ways to make your home healthy, comfortable, and 
energy efficient is to choose the correct heating and cooling system. 
Just keeping yourself comfortable uses up to two-thirds of the energy in your 
home. And if you’re using an inefficient or faulty mechanism to heat or cool 
your home, you’re burning through money and energy faster than you can 
say leaky ducts.
In this chapter, you find out about the pros and cons of various heating and cool-
ing systems — some tried and true, some you might well not have run into yet.
Examining Forced-Air Systems 
for Heating and Cooling
A forced-air system (also called a whole-house system) is one of the most common 
types of heaters used in homes. Gas or electricity is used to heat air, which is 
then blown around the house via metal ducts and into different rooms through 
vents on the floor or ceiling. You can use the same system for cooling your home 
as well. A thermostat controls the air flow. The vents are usually located in the 
draftiest parts of the room, typically near the windows and doors.
Although they sound simple enough, forced-air systems have some 
disadvantages:

354
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
 
 Uneven heating and cooling: Air is blown into the room, causing some 
areas to be warmer or cooler than others.
 
 Pollen and dust: Forced-air systems bring in fresh air from the outside, 
carrying with it pollen and allergens. These systems also spread dust 
around the home — especially if the home has floor vents, where dust 
and dirt are easily trapped. If you have asthma or allergies, a forced-air 
system is the worst choice for controlling the air around you.
 
 If the air coming out of the vents smells funny, consider having your 
ducts cleaned by a licensed mechanical contractor. Not only will your 
system operate more efficiently, but you’ll notice an immediate improve-
ment with dust and allergies.
 
 Noise: You can hear when the fan is on because of the sound of the air 
blowing through the vents.
 
 Inefficiency: Most homes have only one thermostat monitoring the 
system, resulting in some rooms being warmer or cooler than others. 
Plus, you typically have to heat and cool the entire home rather than 
just the room you’re using.
If your current heater was built before 1980, it’s time to upgrade to a new 
system. Even if you stick with a forced-air system, current models are much 
more efficient than older ones; the upgrade will pay for itself in energy sav-
ings in less than three years.
Finding Energy-Efficient 
Heating Systems
Most building departments require you to install a heater in your home, but a 
cooling system (or air conditioner) is not required. Even in warmer climates, 
you need to install a heater, whether it will be used or not. This section runs 
down a variety of energy-efficient heating systems for your home.
Electric baseboard heat
Individual room units can be a great alternative to a large system for the 
whole house. Small electric baseboard heaters run along the base of the wall 
and are relatively inexpensive to operate.
If your home is well insulated and doesn’t require a lot of heating, electric 
baseboard heaters may be the best option. You can control the heat in each 
room, allowing for great flexibility.

Gas room heaters
Similar to electric baseboard heating, individual room heaters are usually 
wall-mounted, self-contained units. Running on natural gas, they’re an effi-
cient option for small homes or for heating one room at a time.
 
Select a model with an automatic ignition instead of a pilot light. Pilot lights 
waste energy and often blow out, potentially leaking gas into your home.
Solar thermal water heater
A solar heater is a wonderfully simple device. This 2-x-4-foot box sits on your 
roof. It has no moving parts, just a coiled pipe entering at the bottom and 
exiting at the top. When the sun shines on the box, it heats the water in the 
pipe. The heated water rises through the coiled pipe automatically, where it’s 
stored in a standard water heater tank.
Although you can use the heated water to meet the hot water needs in your 
house (showering, dishwashing, and so on), you can also use it for heating 
your home. The hot water can be converted into heat in the form of
 
 Radiators: Pipes carry hot water to a typical radiator.
 
 Forced-air fan: A fan blows air over copper tubes filled with the hot 
water. The hot water, in turn, heats the air.
 
 Radiant heat (see the following section): The hot water is used for a 
radiant heating system.
Powered solely by the sun, the solar thermal heater provides hot water for 
free, greatly reducing the operating costs for all these heaters. Because it relies 
on the light and not heat to warm the water, the system even works in the 
winter. When the sun sets at night, the hot water is stored for later use. If care-
fully planned, this system can provide for all your hot water and heating needs.
 
Be sure your roof is strong enough to support the weight of the solar heater 
before you install it. If your home was built before 1980, ask your architect or 
engineer to confirm the strength of your existing roof.
Radiant heat
In a radiant heating system (also called hydronic), hot water flows through 
tubes hidden beneath the floor to slowly warm the room. Unlike traditional 
forced-air heating, where hot air blows to heat the air, radiant heat uses the 
principle of radiation to heat the surface. Radiant heat warms the occupants, 

356
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
not the space — an important distinction. The result is a wonderfully com-
fortable and cozy feeling of warmth.
The advantages of radiant heat have brought it to the mainstream market in 
the United States. (It’s already commonplace in Europe.) A radiant heating 
system is
 
 Comfortable: Because the heat source is under the floor, temperatures 
are warmer at floor level (where you are) and the heat rises to the ceil-
ing. Because the floor is warm, walking barefoot and sitting on the floor 
are cozy possibilities.
 
 Dust-free: No air is pushed around in radiant heating, which makes it a 
dust and pollen-free alternative particularly advantageous for anyone 
suffering from allergies or asthma.
 
 Not drying: Unlike forced hot air, radiant heating doesn’t dry out the air.
 
 Safe for kids: Children are safe from contact with hot radiators or dirty 
vent ducts.
 
 Quiet and maintenance free: A radiant heat system is virtually noise 
and maintenance free.
The hot water in the tubes can be produced through a gas or electric boiler 
or hot water heater. If you’re generating your own electricity with solar 
panels, the electric version is a better choice. The best and most energy-
efficient option is to add a solar water heater on the roof to preheat the water 
and reduce the operation of the boiler.
Although you can adapt a radiant system for any floor type, an earthen floor 
or concrete slab works best. The thermal mass of these floors holds in the 
heat from the tubes and maintains a much more consistent temperature. 
Radiant heat can be installed in both floor-joist systems and slab floors, but 
installing it into a slab is easier and therefore slightly less expensive.
 
Special products are now available to make installing a radiant heat system 
over wood floor joists easier. Products such as Warmboard (www.warm-
board.com) are plywood panels with precut grooves. The tubes are set into 
the grooves for quick installation.
As a general rule, a radiant heating system costs about $1.50 to $1.75 per 
square foot installed, not including the heat source. Although electric radiant 
heat systems are expensive to operate normally, your costs are zero if you’re 
producing your own electricity with solar panels.
For areas where tubing isn’t an option, electrical radiant heat companies, 
such as Nuheat (www.nuheat.com), provide a thin wire mesh you can install 
in the thin space under tile or carpeting. These items warm the floor slowly, 
just as with a tube system, and are a great addition to a single bathroom.

Ground source heat pumps (geothermal)
Ground source heat pumps (also called geothermal systems) are a fairly new 
and innovative method of heating and cooling a building, but the idea is 
simple: The earth below ground maintains a consistent temperature of 
around 55°F. Instead of heating the building from the freezing air outside, or 
cooling the building from the blistering air outside, you heat it or cool it from 
this 55°F. Because this geothermal temperature is much closer to people’s 
normal comfort zone, it requires much less energy to use. In Figure 4-1, you 
can see how this system works.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) credits geothermal as “the 
most energy-efficient, environmentally friendly heating and cooling technology 
available.”
The only byproduct of using a ground source heat pump is warm water. With 
this ground source water, you can heat both the air and the water for your 
building.

Geothermal systems come in two standard configurations:
 
 Vertical closed loop is the most common system. In this system, loops 
of piping are fed several hundred feet into the earth, which requires a 
great deal of boring. Given the depth, the ground source temperature 
remains consistent throughout the year. On a site with expansive soils 
or bedrock, vertical systems are too expensive.
 
 Horizontal closed loop systems are installed in trenches only 5 feet 
below the surface of the earth. This shallow installation means the 
system is affected by seasonal ground temperature changes. Although 
horizontal loops are much easier to install and work with for bedrock 
sites, they do require significantly more surface area (approximately 
2,500 square feet of surface area per ton of cooling) in order to work 
effectively.
The advantages of geothermal include the following:
 
 Cost savings: Homeowners with geothermal units typically realize 
energy savings of 25 to 50 percent over conventional gas, oil, or above-
ground heat pump systems (which work much like an air conditioner in 
reverse). As a general rule, a 2,000-square-foot house can be heated or 
cooled for as little as $1 a day. Because a geothermal system also pro-
duces hot water as a byproduct, it’s up to 30 percent less expensive to 
operate than a traditional gas or electric water heater.
 
 Absence of pollen and dust: A geothermal system doesn’t draw spores 
and pollen into the building as a forced-air heating system does. If you 
have allergies or asthma, this relief is a welcome change, and you’ll 
notice a marked improvement in your indoor air quality.
 
 No fumes: Because the geothermal system doesn’t involve combustion, 
a pilot light, or a chimney, it doesn’t add an odor or fumes to the house.
For smaller buildings, installation cost is the main drawback. Drilling holes 
for the vertical system can be prohibitive for single-family homes. Another 
possible roadblock is the lack of qualified contractors who know how to 
properly design, install, and service these systems.
 
Look for equipment certified by the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration 
Institute (www.ari.org), a nonprofit organization that rates residential and 
small commercial systems.
Fireplaces
No other feature provides as strong an image of home as a fireplace does. 
When they think of holidays and family gatherings, many people picture 
people sitting around a hearth. For centuries, a fireplace was the sole source 
of heat in a home; today, it’s used only occasionally.

Be sure to close the chimney flue of your fireplace when you aren’t using it. If 
you don’t, valuable (and expensive) heated or cooled air will fly right up and 
out of your home, wasting money.
Here are your fireplace options:
 
 Wood: Wood-burning fireplaces have long been a sentimental vision of 
home. The sounds of the crackling fire and the warmth of the hearth are 
comforting and romantic. But in recent years, local building codes have 
banned their use, in favor of cleaner-burning gas fireplaces.
 
 According to the U.S. Department of Energy, wood-burning fireplaces 
emit nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, organic gases, and particulate 
matter. These pollutants can cause serious health problems for children, 
pregnant women, and people with respiratory problems. Some of these 
are even known carcinogens.
 
 If you have an existing wood-burning fireplace, an EPA-certified clean-
burning fireplace insert and a glass screen will protect your family from 
the gases entering the room. Instead of using petroleum-based premanu-
factured logs, look for ecofriendly versions, like a fire log made from 
recycled, dried coffee grounds. You can buy them from Java-Log (www.
java-log.com).
 
 Gas: Gas fireplaces are cleaner burning and mean you don’t have to 
clean up ash from the bottom of the fireplace. The burners can be set 
into sand, stones, or glass for a modern, high-tech look. Most models are 
even available with remote controls. However, gas fireplaces still use a 
fossil fuel as their energy source, making them less than ideal.
 
 Pellet stoves: The most efficient fireplace available is a pellet stove, 
which uses small cylinders of compressed sawdust as a fuel. The com-
bustion chamber is sealed, so instead of a crackling fire, you see a flame 
behind glass. Though not as romantic as a wood fireplace, pellet stoves 
provide the most heat with the least amount of fuel.
 
 Open fireplaces: If you don’t like the sterile flame or fake wood inserts 
of gas fireplaces, EcoSmart Fire (www.ecosmartfire.com) has intro-
duced an environmentally friendly open fireplace. Fueled by renewable 
methylated spirits (fermented sugar cane), the EcoSmart doesn’t require 
a flue. Imagine having a fireplace in the center of your dining room table.
Cooling Options for the Hottest Months
On a hot day, nothing beats walking into a nice, cool, air-conditioned home. 
Unfortunately, running your air conditioner is expensive and eats up energy. 
Fortunately, some simple decisions can help you reduce the amount of 
energy you use to cool your home, even on the hottest days.

360
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
Air conditioners
Central air conditioning is the biggest single user of energy in your home, 
and the most wasted one as well. Most people set the thermostat lower than 
necessary, because they think it’ll make the cold come out faster. (It won’t.) 
Compare your utility bills from March with those in August, and you can see 
firsthand how much air conditioning is costing you.
 
Ironically, air conditioning produces more heat outside than it relieves 
inside. During the summer, it’s estimated that air conditioning is responsible 
for nearly half the electricity used in the United States.
 
Although you may think you can’t live without your air conditioner, in truth, 
a home can be built to never need air conditioning. If you’re still considering 
a central air-conditioning system, purchase an Energy Star–rated unit, with a 
Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) of 12 or higher. Also, look for units 
with a fan-only option and a replaceable filter.
The following list details your air-conditioning options.
 
 Individual window units: Instead of installing central air (see “Forced-
Air Systems: Heating and Cooling,” earlier in this chapter), consider indi-
vidual window units. They cost less to operate and cool only the areas 
you need.
 
 Be sure to properly size the unit for the room; people tend to buy the 
biggest air conditioner they can find, wasting money and energy. Place 
the unit in a window away from direct sunlight or plant a tree outside to 
shade that window.
 
 Ductless units: A more attractive and less noisy option, ductless air con-
ditioners use a simple outdoor condenser unit to run power and refriger-
ant to small, wall-mounted fans. Instead of filling a window, the ductless 
unit can go anywhere on the wall. Because the refrigeration takes place 
outside, ductless units are much quieter than a central or window unit 
system. But expect to pay double the cost of a simple window unit for a 
ductless unit.
 
 Ice energy: Ice energy is an innovative and cost-effective system for cool-
ing a building. A large box in your yard produces a block of ice at night, 
when the temperature is cool and electricity costs are lower. During the 
day, a fan blows air over the ice, creating air conditioning. By time-shifting 
most of the energy use to night, an ice energy system can save you hun-
dreds of dollars on your utility bills. Commercial units have been around 
for some time, and smaller residential units are now finally available as 
well from companies like Ice Energy (www.ice-energy.com).

Ceiling fans
When it’s warm, most people really just need to feel comfortable. Air condi-
tioners blow cold air, taking a long time to cool the entire home. A ceiling fan 
offers the same level of comfort, but costs must less to operate. It circulates 
the air, generating a feeling of comfort and carrying cooling breezes through 
the home. Save the air conditioner for the really hot days and use the ceiling 
fan instead.
 
Because warm air rises and collects around the ceiling, ceiling fans have two 
settings: winter and summer. That little switch on the side of the fan controls 
the setting. The default summer setting pulls air upward, sucking in breezes 
from open windows and cooling things down. The winter setting pushes the 
warm air gathered at the ceiling down onto you. Make sure that you have 
your fan on the correct setting.
Whole-house fans
A whole-house fan is installed in the ceiling of the top floor of your home. The 
fan sucks air into the attic, drawing in cool air from the outside. Open the 
windows of the rooms you want to cool and close the doors of unused rooms 
to help the system work most effectively.
Highly effective and much less expensive than central air conditioning, a 
whole house fan can keep you cool through the summer.
Solar attic fans
If your home has an attic space, install a solar-powered attic fan. These inex-
pensive fans turn on automatically when the attic gets too hot, siphoning 
hot air out of the attic. Using an attic fan lowers the temperature of the attic, 
reducing strain on your air conditioner and saving you money.
Using Nonmechanical Methods to 
Keep Your Home Comfortable
Believe it or not, nature provides its own methods of maintaining a regular 
temperature. For thousands of years, human beings used the systems of 
nature to stay comfortable. But in traditional modern homes, when the tem-
perature gets too hot or cold, people just pump in energy. Before consuming 
energy to heat or cool your home, consider the following methods.

362
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
Insulation
A well-insulated home holds in temperature, lowering your heating and cool-
ing bills. Insulation keeps your heat from leaking out through the walls. The 
more you have, the better it works, and the lower your heating and cooling 
bills will be.
 
Nothing you do has as big an impact on your monthly utility bills as insulat-
ing your home sufficiently. When it comes to insulation, if some is good, more 
is definitely better. (Check out Chapter 2 of Book II for more on insulation.)
 
Insulation doesn’t just go in the walls. Be sure to insulate the following 
places, too:
 
 Attic: Insulate the floor and roof of your attic.
 
 Foundation: More than half of the heat in the average home leaks out of the 
edges of the foundation slab. Insulate the edges prior to erecting the walls.
 
 Crawl space: An average of 80 percent of the air in a home’s moldy, 
dank, cold crawl space will end up in the house. Insulate your home’s 
floors to prevent air from creeping in.
 
 Hot-water pipes: Adding insulation wrap to the hot-water pipes is simple 
and especially important for pipes in crawl spaces. Try to avoid running 
ducts and pipes through unheated attics or crawl spaces.
Thermal mass
If insulation is the ability of a material to hold in temperature, thermal mass is 
the ability of a material to absorb and store temperature. Sometimes referred 
to as a heat sink, this characteristic can keep a building cool in the summer 
and warm in the winter in one of the simplest methods to reduce heating and 
cooling costs.
If you’ve ever gone swimming at night, you’ve experienced thermal mass. The 
sun heats up the pool water all day, and the water stores that heat. At night, 
when the surrounding temperature drops and the water releases this heat, the 
pool feels like bathwater. You’re feeling the stored heat being released in the 
water. This is thermal mass in action. (Water has a very high thermal mass.)
Heavy, massive materials, such as concrete, brick, and stone, have a high 
thermal mass. Thermal mass is why your basement is always so cool in the 
summer, and why your dog sleeps on the tiles. The mass of the concrete base-
ment and tile floor store the cold and release it when the air around it is warm.

363
 Chapter 4: Exploring Options for Heating and Cooling Systems
Book IV
Green 
Remodeling
 
An exposed concrete slab is a simple way to utilize thermal mass. In the 
winter, let the sun come through the windows and warm up the concrete. In 
the summer, use curtains or overhangs to block the sun from coming in, 
keeping the concrete cool. This simple method helps your home maintain a 
consistent temperature year-round.
Utilizing thermal mass is ideal in a climate where it’s warm during the day 
and cool at night. Build the south-facing walls of your home out of adobe, 
rammed earth, or concrete. The sun warms the walls all day and keeps the 
house warm at night.
You can use thermal mass to maintain a consistent temperature in your 
home. Materials with a high thermal mass aren’t affected by sudden tempera-
ture swings; they take a long time to heat up and cool down. Using thermal 
mass in the winter requires positioning a mass wall so that the sun warms it 
all day). At night, after the temperature drops, the wall will release heat and 
keep you warm.
Because thermal mass requires changes in temperature in order to work, it 
won’t work in areas that are always hot or always cold. In fact, thermal mass 
works against you in these areas. For example, a concrete building in a hot 
desert, where it’s hot all day and night, never has the chance to release heat. 
This building will be even hotter inside from the saturated thermal mass.
Passive cooling
Through the physics of convection, heat rises. Warm air is lighter than cool 
air, and as the warm air rises, cooler air rushes in to take its place. Passive 
cooling uses this principle to create ventilation.
You can use this idea to keep cool in the summer by funneling air through 
your home. Using something called a thermal chimney (a tall, vented space), 
this rising heat is directed up and out of the house. As wind passes over the 
building, it pulls more air through the chimney. Cool air from the outside is 
pulled into the lower part of the house.
 
A tall, open stairwell can function as a thermal chimney. Place operable sky-
lights at the top of the stairwell to allow the heat to escape on warm days. 
You can create air movement even if there is no breeze.

364
Book IV: Green Remodeling 
Ventilation
The movement of air, even slightly warmer air, across your skin causes a 
cooling sensation. The air removes heat and evaporates perspiration, creat-
ing the illusion of a comfortable temperature. By simply moving air through 
your home, you can reduce the need for air conditioning.
 
Here are three simple ways to move air through your home:
 
 Operable windows: The easiest way to create natural ventilation is to 
install operable windows. Locate windows at different heights and on 
opposite walls to encourage cross-ventilation. Windows placed at the 
same height allow air to pass only straight across the room.
 
 Bathroom fans: Bathroom fans exhaust the hot, steamy air from your 
bathroom to the outside. Not only do fans lessen the need for air condi-
tioning, but it reduces potential problems with moisture and mold.
 
 Switch boxes for clothes dryers: Install a switch box on the hose of 
your clothes dryer. In the summer, the hot air is pumped outside, as it 
normally would be. In the winter, flip the switch box to redirect the heat 
back into the room. These inexpensive boxes are available at any hard-
ware store.
Earth berms
Earth sloped near or against the house protects it from cold winters and hot 
summers. Called berms, these mounds use the high thermal mass of the earth to 
keep your building cool. Berms can be an attractive addition to your landscape.
Passive solar
Passive solar integrates insulation, thermal mass, and passive cooling into 
one cohesive approach. When used correctly, a passive solar home can 
use the sun to provide the heating, cooling, and daylighting of most of your 
needs.
The process is simple: Passive solar design takes advantage of the fact that 
the summer sun is higher than the winter sun. Overhangs shade the building 
from the summer sun, keeping it cool. The same overhangs allow the lower 
winter sun to enter the building and heat an interior thermal mass wall.

365
 Chapter 4: Exploring Options for Heating and Cooling Systems
Book IV
Green 
Remodeling
Passive solar design works in most climates, but it works best in areas with 
seasonal changes in weather. When a sun-facing, thermal mass wall is placed 
behind some glass, it’s called a trombe wall. The space between the glass and 
the wall fills with hot air. Vents at the top and bottom of the wall control this 
hot air, allowing it to be used to heat the building.
The best approach to passive solar is to use the principles to influence and 
shape the design of your home. Although considering passive solar during 
the initial design of your home is best, even an existing building can benefit 
from these ideas. Passive solar systems don’t add to the cost of the building, 
and you’ll see an immediate improvement in your energy use.
Active solar
Active solar is a strategy for designing high-performance, ultra-energy-
efficient buildings. Active solar incorporates all the elements of a passive 
solar design (see the preceding section), but with additional mechanical 
equipment, such as pumps or fans, to take advantage of the heat from the 
sun. This equipment can include some elaborate technologies such as:
 
 Motorized shades: Timers and sensors control when window shades are 
raised and lowered, which controls heat gain from the sun.
 
 Solar trackers: Solar panels are turned throughout the day to follow the 
path of the sun. This increases the output of the solar panels.
 
 Vents: Thermostats and sensors control vents, which open to allow 
warm air into the house.

hat’s your dream garden like? Is it a place of frantic activity, pollu-
tion, noise, constant struggle, endless expense, butchered and dying 
plants, and menacing weeds? Or do you imagine a peaceful retreat: serene, 
wholesome, bursting with color and thriving with little effort?
Sadly, most gardens are dependent on adversarial horticulture: the war-like 
practices of hacking, decapitating, shearing, poisoning, ripping, tearing, and 
swearing that characterize many homeowners’ relationship with landscaping. 
In fact, the American culture seems to encourage the false idea that a garden 
is a battleground, a place where special skills and violent activities are nec-
essary to keep things in line. What a shame. You shouldn’t have to become 
a weed warrior or an herbicide-wielding killer just to have a nice yard. Who 
thought up this crazy mess, anyway?
Nobody gardens nature. Nature quietly thrives while down in town everyone 
takes up arms every Saturday morning. What’s the difference, and where 
did we go wrong? And most importantly, how can we change things so that 
this doesn’t happen again? This chapter shows you how to develop your 
landscaping along natural models that have proven themselves over tens of 
millions of years. When you do things the right way, you enjoy lovely, envi-
ronmentally friendly surroundings and you get a break from the battle.

Getting Up to Speed on Sustainability
At one time, all gardens were simple. They were made up of plants, soil, and 
natural building materials. They didn’t cost much to create or care for. Their 
impact on the environment was positive because they didn’t cause strip 
mining, release poisons into the atmosphere, or consume huge quantities of 
fossil fuel. They were sustainable before the word was popular because they 
could go on essentially forever.
Gardens can be that way again. All over the world people are getting wise 
to the fact that they have an alternative to the dysfunctional industrial/com-
mercial landscaping model that’s been jammed down our throats by advertis-
ing and ignorance. There is a better way. It’s not 100 percent perfect, but by 
doing things the sustainable way, you’ll make a huge and important differ-
ence. Your land is your opportunity to help create a better future.
What the heck is sustainable 
landscaping anyway?
A few key ideas describe how sustainable landscaping works. They’re simple 
and easy enough that you can put them into practice in your home landscape 
without an advanced degree in botany.
A sustainable landscape includes the following features:
 
 A living, integrated system: Nature is a system of interrelated subsys-
tems that work together to form a smoothly operating whole — like your 
body, for example, made up of its various organs, or a forest filled with 
many kinds of plants and animals, or the ocean teeming with millions of 
interdependent life forms. By making your landscape a highly function-
ing system patterned after the ways of nature, it will operate like nature: 
without the need for much control or intervention and without harming 
any other living system.
 
 Homeostasis: Homeostasis is a fancy word for stability. It’s the balance 
of forces in a living system, with no force getting out of control to cause 
harm. Consider your body, which more or less functions automatically. 
You don’t need to will your heart to beat or your eyes to see; it just hap-
pens. A little care from you, and everything is groovy. The landscape 
system can work this way, too, if you set it up right.
 
 Deep design: Homeostasis in the garden doesn’t happen by accident. It’s a 
product of good design. Not the too-common kind of superficial design that 
creates pretty but dysfunctional gardens, but design that looks beneath 
appearances to develop a beautiful landscape that also really works. It 
takes special skills to create a sustainable design, but you can discover 
those skills booking this chapter. (Here’s a tip: They’re not hard at all.)

 Cyclical: Nature recycles everything. There’s no waste in nature. As the 
Buddhist master Thich Nhat Hanh once said, “When I look at a rose I see 
compost; when I look at compost I see a rose.”
 
 Conventional manmade systems are linear: Get a virgin material from 
nature (usually with disastrous effects at the source), use toxic and 
energy-intensive processes to alter it so much that it will never go back 
to nature again, use it one time, and when its usually too-short useful life 
comes to an end, dispose of it in a landfill where it plugs up the works of 
yet another formerly living system.
 
 Nature has been very patient with us, but this linear game is just about 
up. She hates it, and besides, she’s nearly out of merchandise. By going 
back to the infinite and ancient cyclical way of life, our gardens become 
one with nature, less troublesome, and more enduring.
 
 Harmony with local environment: Your property is unique in all the 
world, with a particular soil type, microclimate, exposure, vegetation, 
and other factors. By choosing plants and other elements that are well 
suited to these particulars, you’re setting up a robust ecosystem that 
will be happy with its lot in life.
 
 Conventional gardens rely on ill-adapted plants and other elements and 
then depend on a constant input of resources to keep them from failing.
 
 Careful management of inputs and outputs: The sustainable landscape 
thrives on what nature offers. It makes efficient use of resources, such 
as building materials, water, fertilizer, fossil fuels, and others. What goes 
into it and what comes out are minimized so that as many impacts as 
possible are beneficial.
 
 On-site impacts: What happens on site is carefully considered at the 
design stage. Natural features, such as soil, native plants, and animal 
habitat, are preserved. All improvements must meet the test of being 
a good player. Each element in the newly formed ecosystem must play 
a beneficial role: making oxygen, sequestering carbon, providing food, 
improving the climate inside dwellings, preventing erosion, protecting 
against wildfire, to name a few. To minimize negative impacts, toxic 
materials aren’t part of the scheme, nor are energy-intensive processes, 
noise-generating machinery, or thirsty plantings.
 
 Off-site impacts: What happens off-site is important, too; your landscap-
ing practices should cause no damage at the source of materials. Your 
landscape won’t be truly sustainable unless it leaves forests intact, 
mountains unmined, oil unburned, and workers safe and happy.
Work toward taking your landscape beyond mere sustainability. As visionary 
architect William McDonough has observed, we shouldn’t just be less bad, 
we should be good. Landscapes offer so many benefits to users and to nature 
that it’s easy to use the power of the sun and rain and soil to create a para-
dise for all living beings. You, too, can do that, and there’s no reason not to.

Why sustainable landscaping 
matters to the environment
The traditional landscape is an environmental train wreck. Some of the ways 
that it damages the environment include the following:
 
 Fragmenting and destroying native habitat.
 
 Consuming natural resources.
 
 Strip mining, clear-cutting of forests, and other impacts at the source of 
materials.
 
 Introducing non-native plants that invade and devastate wild ecosystems.
 
 Wrecking waterways and groundwater through leaching of pesticides, 
herbicides, and fertilizers. (Much — to the tune of 40 to 60 percent — of 
the nitrogen applied to lawns ends up in the water.)
 
 Increasing runoff, which results in further damage to waterways and 
also causes urban flooding.
 
 Filling canyons and landfills with waste.
 
 Increasing global warming through the use of fossil fuels.
 
 Wasting precious water to keep useless ornamental plants and lawns alive.
 
 Decreasing the peace; outdoor power equipment creates noise in every 
neighborhood.
 
 Harming living soil with heavy machinery and toxic chemicals.
 
 Disturbing the natural animal order. Pesticides kill 60 to 70 million birds 
each year, not to mention its impacts on beneficial insects and other 
wildlife. And, get this: U.S. landscape pesticide use is applied at a rate of 
ten times more per acre than that of agriculture.
What does a sustainable landscape look like?
Sustainable landscaping isn’t about a look. 
A Japanese garden can be sustainable. So 
can an English garden or a desert garden or a 
woodland garden. A sustainable landscape can 
be formal or informal, geometric or naturalistic, 
simple or complex.
Other than planting vast swaths of mowed 
lawn in a dry climate, you’re pretty much free 
to choose whatever look you want as long as 
you follow the principles of sustainability, set-
ting up a smoothly functioning ecosystem that 
makes minimal demands and creates minimal 
problems.

Human well-being doesn’t escape the effects of traditional landscaping, 
either. The health of one in seven people is affected by pesticides. Air pollu-
tion caused by pesticides and fossil fuel use damages the health of everyone. 
Between 60,000 and 70,000 severe accidents and fatalities occur each year 
just from lawn mowing. We can do better!
Sustainable landscaping addresses all these issues by cleaning up the 
system, making these impacts unnecessary, and respecting the environment.
What’s in it for you
The case for taking sustainable action to preserve our planet is strong, but 
if you need even further reason to pursue a sustainable landscape, go ahead 
and think of yourself: A sustainable landscape is cheaper, easier to care for, 
more satisfying to live with, and much more interesting.
You save money because your inputs are significantly reduced. You spend 
less on materials, water, fertilizer, gasoline, labor, dump fees — the works. 
Compared with traditional landscaping practices, sustainable landscaping is 
a penny pincher’s delight.
Busting some sustainable myths
As with anything new, concerns come up about 
sustainable landscaping practices. You’ll be 
making a big, expensive, long-term commitment 
to your landscaping, and you need to know sus-
tainable landscaping isn’t some goofy new-age 
idea that doesn’t really deliver the goods. Here 
are some facts to set your mind at ease.
  MYTH: Sustainable landscapes are ugly.
 
 TRUTH: Plants in a sustainable landscape 
are healthy and vigorous, and they have 
room to grow into their beautiful natural 
form. Structures are made from natural 
materials with their inherent beauty show-
ing through. Sustainable landscapes are 
green, flowery, fresh, and lovely.
  MYTH: Sustainable landscapes are expen-
sive.
 
 TRUTH: All landscaping takes some cash, 
but sustainable landscaping is less expen-
sive than traditional landscaping for a 
couple of reasons. First, because the 
sustainable approach emphasizes plants 
over hardscape, you save money on the 
installation. Plants are cheaper than con-
crete. Second, and even more important, 
the ongoing care of the landscape will be 
much less because it’s undemanding of 
resources and labor.
  MYTH: Sustainable landscapes don’t work.
 
 TRUTH: The whole point of developing a 
landscape sustainably is to create an eco-
system that functions smoothly without 
much effort from us. When you look at what 
you need to keep a conventional landscape 
in one piece — the mowing, watering, pest 
control, pruning and all the rest — you can 
easily see that it’s conventional landscap-
ing that doesn’t work.

374
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Because your landscaping will make so few demands on you, you’re able to 
spend less time keeping it from falling apart and more time enjoying it (or enjoy-
ing something else you love). If you’ve busted your chops on a conventional 
landscape for a while, you know how much work it can be. Imagine that work not 
happening. That’s what converting to a sustainable landscape can do for you.
Finally, after you see how beautifully everything works, you’ll come to admire 
the elegance of a finely tuned system. It’s soothing to know that things are 
working smoothly without much help from you.
Doing Your Part: What It Takes to 
Make a Sustainable Landscape
Sustainable landscapes occur naturally all around you, but taking over 
Nature’s job requires some thought and effort on your part. The following 
sections provide some tips on how to take your sustainable landscaping 
project from good idea to beautiful, low-maintenance retreat.
Taking the time to do it right
Slow down. Creating a sustainable landscape is a big project. And more 
important, the practice of deep design demands careful observation and 
attention to detail.
In ancient times, Japanese garden designers would sit on the site every day, 
all day, for a year, carefully noticing the way the sun moved, how the trees 
responded to wind, what animals visited, and many more subtleties that can 
be grasped only by quiet, intense scrutiny. As the seasons changed, they 
learned in summer what they could never learn in spring, and so on through 
the full annual cycle. Only after that apprenticeship would they dare to begin 
the design process.
 
Consider taking a year of your own to develop a deep bond with your property. 
You’ll discover quite a lot, and your work will be enriched by your understand-
ing. Plus, you’ll get to put off all that hard physical work a while longer.

Getting buff: Your sustainable 
DIY fitness course
If you’re planning to do the work of building your new landscape, you can 
look forward to a lot of very hard physical effort. Building a landscape isn’t 
crocheting doilies. You can end up in the best physical condition of your life 
or in the chiropractor’s office.
First, take stock of your ability to dig ditches all day, lift heavy stuff, and 
generally grunt out, weekend after weekend. Balance that against the cost 
of paying someone to do some or all of the work. If you do want to tackle it, 
be sure that you know how to work safely and check with your doctor if you 
have any qualms about your fitness level. Stay safe, OK?
Skills that lower your bills
Doing the work yourself can save up to half the total cost of the project. 
But before you leap in, assess your abilities. You can learn new skills, true 
enough; but you can also get in over your head and end up with a really 
crummy job because you didn’t actually know what you were doing.
Tackle work that you’re experienced with and stretch yourself to learn some 
new things. The rest? Hey, don’t let your ego get in the way of hiring an 
expert. It’s cheaper than doing it all over.
Setting a budget
Developing a good tight budget is tough when you’re not exactly sure what you’ll 
be doing. You have a lot of variables to consider, and costs vary wildly depend-
ing on the kinds of improvements you’ll be making. For example, a flagstone 
patio can cost 20 or 30 times what a ground cover would for the same area.
Generally speaking, landscaping an entire yard front and rear can set you 
back the price of a new car or two, but the sky’s the limit. (Conversely, you 
can save tons of money by doing the work yourself and by tapping the waste 
stream for materials whenever you can.) Develop a rough budget by talking 
to contractors, shopping for materials, and also considering the value of your 
own time. Don’t get too detailed at this stage.

376
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Scheduling your project
Consider the scope of the work and how much time it will take you to do it or 
have it done. If you’ll be getting professional help with some or all of the job, 
talk to your contractor about the timing from their perspective. And remem-
ber that many landscaping tasks are dependent on the time of year. Think, 
too, about your cash flow if that’s a consideration. Develop a project calen-
dar using the sequencing information in Table 1-1. Of course, things can get 
off track, but at least you’ll have an action plan to work from.
Some steps are done concurrently with others. For example, you may (and 
probably will) still be designing certain aspects of the project while you’re 
building others. Whatever the particulars of your project, Table 1-1 can help 
give you an idea of how things usually go.
Certain sequences are pretty hard to argue with. You have to do your demoli-
tion before you build anything new. And it’s a whole lot easier to do the grading 
before the plants are planted and the irrigation is in. Others are more flexible. 
You may be installing a patio in one corner of the yard before you even touch 
another corner. And as for design, it can be a continuing process of thinking, 
learning, and reconsidering throughout the course of the entire project. Overall, 
though, if you follow the chain of events in Table 1-1, you’ll do okay.

Planning and Design: The Key 
to a Sustainable Landscape
When it comes to making your landscaping work properly, good design is 
everything. It determines once and forever how the system will work. It’s 
important, it’s detailed, and it’s a lot of fun.
Getting to know the site and your needs
Responding appropriately to conditions is essential to developing the kind 
of finely tuned landscape that’s easy to live with. The first step is to make 
friends with the site so that you understand what you’re dealing with.
 
But understanding the site isn’t enough. You have to learn what you want 
and need, too. Rushing into the design phase without going through this pro-
cess will leave you without the information you need to make good decisions.
First, plan on spending some quality time with your yard. Go outside when you 
have the time to just hang out, quietly observing the many characteristics of 
your property: the path of the sun, the condition of the soil, the health of existing 
plants, good and bad views, and so on. Take photos, make notes, move around 
to see things from as many perspectives as possible. Get professional advice if 
you have special concerns, such as an unstable hillside or soil problems.
Make a simple list that details what you want from a finished landscape. 
Include your family in the process. Create this list while outdoors so that 
you can better imagine the possibilities. For example, suppose that you were 
to stand in your back yard and dream about what you need. You might list 
privacy, a shady place with a hammock or a patio, a play space for the kids, a 
vegetable garden, a few fruit trees, secure fencing, a butterfly garden, a wild-
life habitat, and a water feature. Take the time to get it all down on paper and 
be sure everybody gets heard.

378
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Developing a design
Design deserves your best thinking because it determines the outcome of the 
project and how it will function over time. Design goes from the general (“I 
think I want a vegetable garden”) to the specific (“I want four 4 x 10-foot raised 
stone beds in the northeast corner of the back yard with 6 kohlrabi plants and 
5 Bad Boy tomatoes.”). It’s a rigorous process, but anyone can do it.
Here’s an overview:
 
1. Develop the conceptual design.
 
 After you’ve learned about the site and about your own needs, you’re ready 
to take a first pass at putting it all together. This step is called a conceptual 
design because it looks at the general approach to laying things out.
 
2. Refine your design.
 
 After you have a good understanding of how the elements fit together, 
you can begin to work on all the little details. What will that patio be 
made of, and precisely what will its shape and location be? Exactly 
which tree will go on the east side of the house and what size will it be 
at planting time? What species of perennials will go in the front border, 
how many of each kind, and what size? You’ll develop a series of plans 
to detail the construction, planting, irrigation and other phases of the 
work. These plans help you refine your ideas and also guide you through 
the long process of constructing the landscape.
 
3. Revisit the budget.
 
 After you know exactly what you’ll be doing, it’s time to crunch hard 
numbers, adding up all the materials, equipment, outside labor, and 
other costs to determine your total budget. If you’ll be doing an entire 
property, this number will be big. If it’s too big, consider how you can 
lower costs without compromising quality (by using smaller plants or 
less hardscape, for example) or how you can break up the project into 
phases that you’ll spread out over a few years.
Starting with Simple, 
Sustainable Projects
Designing a sustainable landscape from scratch takes time, but you can do 
several things right away to improve your landscape’s environmental record. 
They require little or no money, are easy, and don’t require the use of heavy 
equipment, chiropractors, or bad language.

Axing your overgrown plants
Take note of how many hours per month you spend keeping plants from 
growing too big for the space they’re in. This is time you could be enjoying a 
nice sustainable activity like loafing.
 
Plants never, ever figure out (much less obey) how big you want them to be. 
When they’re programmed to get 100 feet tall, they always try to do so. If you 
want an 8-foot-tall plant, you need to choose one that gets 8 feet tall at matu-
rity. You will never have to trim it. It will look better and be healthier for 
being left alone. And you’ll look so relaxed in that hammock.
Getting rid of the weaklings
Sorry, rose lovers, but hybrid tea roses really stink when it comes to taking 
care of themselves. It hurts sustainability-minded landscapers to ponder the 
rust and the leaf spot and the bugs and all the other ills and ailments these 
pitiable creatures suffer from — and all the chemicals homeowners use to 
keep these ills and ailments under control.
Consider putting the roses out of their misery and replacing them with some-
thing a little more durable.
Go around your yard with a shovel, swiftly and mercifully ending the lives of 
namby-pamby plants of whatever kind. Or, if they just need a better location 
to thrive (if they aren’t getting enough sun, for example, or are too exposed 
to wind), move them to a spot where they’ll do better. Probably 80 percent 
of gardening problems are caused by 20 percent of the plants. You know who 
they are. Go get ’em.
Dumping your chemical arsenal
Exactly what excuse does anyone have for holding on to that smelly collec-
tion of gummy bottles of insecticide and scary containers of weed killer and 
leaky bags of fert-n-hurt? C’mon. You know you’ll never use that stuff again. 
You’re a sustainable gardener now! Put those old jugs into a sealed container 
and take it to your local hazardous waste collection center. They’ll safely dis-
pose of it for you.
 
Some herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers are truly treacherous, so be sure 
and wear protective gear and be very careful not to spill anything as you purge.

Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Trading your power tools for hand tools
The thing about power tools is that they don’t actually save that much effort. 
First of all, you had to work pretty hard to earn the money to buy them, 
right? Then you have to store them somewhere. And do tune-ups and repairs. 
And fuel them and oil them and wipe them down and sharpen the blades and 
adjust the dang carburetor over and over again because nobody but the high 
priests of internal combustion can get it right the first time.
And think about the number of times you’ve pulled the starter cord with no 
results. Must be in the thousands, right? Remember how frustrating that is? 
And the language! Shoot, you could have had the lawn mowed with a simple 
push mower by the time you got that wheezy old putt-putt running and 
regained your composure. Power tools are a heck of a lot of work.
Shop around for some truly good, lifetime-quality hand tools and then leave 
the power ones out at the curb for some other fool to struggle with. You’ll be 
glad you did.
Mulching
Naked beds don’t work. The soil dries out too quickly, root systems suffer heat 
and cold, weeds come up everywhere, rain washes earth away, beneficial soil 
microorganisms suffer, mud sticks to your boots. In nature, organic material 
constantly rains down from the plants, creating mulch while also returning 
valuable nutrients to the soil. The sustainable landscaper mimics this elegant 
system by practicing chop-and-drop pruning (let the pieces fall where they 
may) and by spreading some form of organic mulch on the surface of the soil.
Be sure you use an organic mulch (in most situations), not crushed rock or 
other nondegradable material. Many communities offer mulch made from 
green waste for free or very cheap. You can also purchase mulch made from 
many different local materials, many of them from the waste stream.
 
According to the ASPCA, cocoa mulch is toxic to dogs. If you have a dog, use 
an alternative material.
Growing food
What better thing to use your land for than growing your own food? Home-
grown food offers the following advantages over supermarket food:

381
 Chapter 1: Pursuing a Smart, Sustainable Landscape
Book V
Sustainable 
Landscaping
 
 It’s stunningly fresh.
 
 It didn’t get shipped from far away.
 
 It’s organic (assuming that you grow it that way).
 
 It’s made use of few resources (assuming that the crop is adapted to 
your local conditions).
 
 It’s not dependent on fossil fuel.
 
 You can share it with your friends and neighbors.
 
 It tastes really, really good.
Some food is easier to grow than others. Once established, most fruit trees 
and perennial crops, such as asparagus, strawberries, and rhubarb, are less 
work than annual crops like broccoli, tomatoes, and onions.
 
Look for crops that are easy to grow in your area. If you live in a cool micro-
climate, you may find that it makes most tomato plants unproductive. Buy 
your tomatoes at the farmer’s market and use your land to grow potatoes, 
leaf crops, asparagus, artichokes, and other climate-adapted varieties. It’s so 
much easier than struggling to make something happy that’s really out of its 
element. Book VI tells you much more about growing your own food.

Making Sustainable Decisions for 
Your Landscape Design
In This Chapter
 Cutting down on waste
 Trimming down your resource use
 Creating a satisfying, sustainable landscape
O
ne of the coolest things about landscaping your property sustainably is 
that you, personally, benefit from it. Heck, even if you don’t give a hoot 
about the environment, you’re going to save big bucks and a whole lot of 
hard work that you don’t really want to do anyway. Sustainable landscaping 
is good for your lazy side, and the planet still gets what it needs.
In this chapter, you find out how to make good decisions about what to 
include in your landscape and how to select materials and features that make 
sense for you and the environment and create a dream landscape that’s beau-
tiful and easy to live with. And then you get tips for putting it all together in a 
landscape design that delivers.
Maximizing Materials, Minimizing Waste
When you create a garden that minimizes the need for inputs (whatever you 
bring into it, like building and maintenance materials) and makes use of the 
most efficient and earth-friendly inputs, and that also generates few or no out-
puts (what we erroneously call “waste”), you get a highly tuned, very efficient 
system that rewards you with decades of pleasure and beauty. (This section 
talks about inputs. Check out the “Generating few (or no) outputs” section, 
later in this chapter, for more info about minimizing outputs.)
The following sections explore, on an item-by-item basis, how you can 
optimize inputs.

384
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Building material inputs: Turning so-
called trash into landscaping treasure
You need to build the landscape out of something, of course, but there are 
huge differences in materials and many really great sustainable options.
When trying to minimize building material inputs, first consider how much 
hardscape (stone, wood, or other nonplant parts of your landscape) you 
really need. Don’t build a huge deck that you’ll never actually use or pour 
a patio that would accommodate a wedding reception when you really just 
need someplace for the family to have dinner. Ask what you need, not what 
you want. Get into the habit of self-restraint. When you do, you give the poor 
old planet a break and save big bucks.
The first place to look for materials is in your own backyard, where what 
you have is free, doesn’t need to be transported from elsewhere (burning up 
fossil fuel in the process), and isn’t doing much just sitting in your side yard 
by the trash cans.
Do you have native stones, undesirable trees that can be harvested for 
lumber, an old patio that could be broken up and turned into stepping 
stones? Go look around your property and make a list of anything that you 
could possibly transform into a landscape feature. If nothing else there’s 
always soil, which you can turn into handsome earthen walls and benches. 
And don’t overlook the neighbors either — their so-called trash may be just 
what you need for your garden.
Consider re-using things that come from the community’s waste stream, 
such as broken concrete (now called urbanite, a brand-new mineral!), which 
you can easily turn into a lovely patio or handsome dry-stacked low retain-
ing wall. Try turning old timbers on their way to the landfill into edging for a 
raised bed or a handsome footbridge.
The following sections provide a sampling of waste-stream landscaping mate-
rials that you can probably find floating around your community
Salvaged and reclaimed materials
Salvaged and reclaimed materials aren’t really waste because people recog-
nize that they have value. They’re resources that could have been wasted but 
are instead carefully saved and sold to willing buyers.
Look for redwood that’s been taken out of old barns (with the barn owner’s 
permission, of course), for example, or even logs dredged up from underwa-
ter where they sank a century ago and were left behind.

385
 Chapter 2: Making Sustainable Decisions for Your Landscape Design
Book I
Sustainable 
Landscaping
Modern portable lumber mills are circulating around some communities, 
making usable lumber out of urban trees that had to be cut down for one 
reason or another. You can find used bricks in nearly any community. A 
search of the Web can often turn up amazingly cool things for sale that you 
can use to create a one-of-a-kind refuse-chic landscape feature.
Recycled content materials
The difference between waste-stream or reclaimed materials and recycled ones 
is the degree of processing involved. You can use a waste-stream material, such 
as urbanite, as-is, with no special alchemy to make it into something else. It’s 
still just concrete when you’re done with it: concrete then, concrete now. But 
a recycled material, such as plastic lumber, goes into a factory as a big load of 
sticky pop bottles and comes out looking like a 2 x 4 — you’d have a hard time 
guessing what it’s made from.
 
Recycling often isn’t actually recycling. Some people call it downcycling or 
remanufacturing because the end product is so different from the ingredients 
that went into it, and because in most cases you can never take it in the 
other direction — for example, you can’t make soda bottles out of old plastic 
lumber. A few materials, such as aluminum and steel, are truly recyclable, but 
their use in the landscape is minimal.
Despite these imperfections, using recycled materials is a big improvement 
over buying new ones, because it makes use of what had been considered 
trash and reduces the need to cut down trees, strip-mine raw materials, and 
do other environmentally nasty things.
Some recycled content materials, such as plastic lumber, may cost somewhat 
more than conventional products. Others, like wood chips, are free or avail-
able at a very low cost.
Low-impact materials
If you have to go with a virgin material, be sure it’s produced in an environ-
mentally sustainable way. Look for lumber that’s been certified as having 
been sustainably grown and harvested by an independent organization (such 
as the Forest Stewardship Council or The Sustainable Forestry Initiative). Or 
consider straw bale or earthen construction instead of using lumber. Grow 
your own wood or bamboo for a truly low-impact and ultra-local resource. 
Substitute high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or galvanized piping for PVC. 
(Avoid copper because it is strip mined.) If you must use paint and finishes, 
choose low-VOC ones that don’t emit as much junk into the atmosphere.
Renewable materials
Simply put, a renewable resource is one that you can keep going back for 
more of. Trees are a renewable resource; oil is not. By choosing renewable 
materials, you can be sure that future generations will be able to enjoy them, 

386
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
too. Renewable materials are those that come from living sources, because 
they’re the only things that replicate themselves. Here are some examples:
 
 Animal manures
 
 Bamboo
 
 Lumber and other wood products
 
 Organic fertilizers such as bone meal, fish emulsion, kelp
 
 Straw
You can expedite the renewal process by planting trees after you purchase 
lumber or by donating to tree planting through a carbon-offsetting organi-
zation, such as Carbonfund.org Foundation (www.carbonfund.org) or 
TerraPass (www.terrapass.com).
Heritage materials
Heritage materials are produced so that they can be re-used over and over 
again as circumstances change. An example is the interlocking concrete 
paver block systems that are popping up in driveways all over the place. 
Because they can be taken up and re-used, your driveway could become 
a neighbor’s driveway 40 years from now and then end up, another few 
decades out, in the next block as a patio in the back yard of somebody who 
wasn’t even born when you first built your driveway.
When you create things that last and then make them modular so that they 
can be used again or repurposed, you’re doing something very sustainable 
indeed because the initial environmental impact can be spread over many 
decades of use. Any durable and movable item — bricks, stones, paving 
blocks, segmental retaining walls — can fall into the category of heritage 
material, as long as you understand their long-term potential and avoid 
cementing them into place so that they can’t be re-used.
Pseudo-sustainable materials busted
 
As with so many things these days, some of what passes for “green” materi-
als is anything but. For example, phony plastic lawns are all the rage in some 
circles. Some communities even give rebates to homeowners who replace 
their living lawns with artificial ones. Manufacturers point out that a fake 
lawn uses no water and needs no mowing, fertilizer, or pesticides. But they 
ignore the fact that nonliving turf worsens the urban heat-island effect, uses 
materials that are made from fossil fuels and in some cases may contain toxic 
elements, eliminates even the paltry life-giving benefits of real grass, and cre-
ates a potential waste-stream nightmare at the end of its service. Add to that 
the fact that synthetic turf does require some water to keep it clean and con-
tributes to stormwater pollution because it offers no biofiltration, and you 
can see that plastic lawns are a bad idea.

387
 Chapter 2: Making Sustainable Decisions for Your Landscape Design
Book I
Sustainable 
Landscaping
Real lawns are a huge part of the negative environmental impact of landscap-
ing, but substituting a sea of plastic is going in the wrong direction. Far better 
is to install a meadow of native grasses or other perennials. Better yet, put 
in a diverse garden of useful plants that will be appreciated by wildlife and 
enjoyed by you for food, with far fewer problems.
Maintenance inputs: Planning ahead 
to reduce the need for upkeep
There is no such thing as no-maintenance landscaping, but by designing for 
sustainability and building things so that they last, you greatly reduce the 
materials, effort, and money that go into keeping the place looking good and 
functioning well. The upcoming sections give you ideas for making the most 
of the materials that your landscape may require.
Water
We think of water as being abundant, yet out of the 326 million cubic miles 
of water on the planet, only about .03 percent is usable by humans. Overall, 
that’s not much.
Water is a renewable resource, of course. In fact, the water that falls from the 
sky in the form of rain and snow is about as renewable as you can get — plus, 
it’s free. Rain even picks up nitrogen on its way down, delivering nice organic 
fertilizer right to your plants and then watering it in, all at no charge. But 
water is in short supply in most places now, and it’s not right to use potable 
water to irrigate lawns and decorative plants when people are going thirsty. 
Fortunately, you can greatly reduce your landscape water use without mate-
rially compromising the appearance and function of your garden.
 
Here are some simple strategies to set up your landscaping so that it’s 
water-thrifty:
 
 Design smart. Group plants into hydrozones, which are areas containing 
plants with similar water needs. (Chapter 4 tells you more about choos-
ing plants for a sustainable landscape.)
 
 Choose drought-tolerant plants. Select species that are climate-
appropriate and that will thrive on rainfall alone, or with very little 
supplemental irrigation.
 
 Downsize your lawn. The lawn is the big water-sucker in the land-
scape. Try reducing the size of your lawn to just what you actually 
use. Consider a long, skinny lawn that’s great for throwing a Frisbee or 
running around on but that eliminates the excess turf you never use 
anyway.

388
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
 
 Mulch. Mulch is a layer of organic matter — usually wood chips or 
bark — that you put on top of the soil. It conserves water by reducing 
evaporative loss from the soil surface, keeping the roots of the plants 
cool, and reducing weeds that compete with desirable plants for water.
Fertilizer
Nobody fertilizes the mountains or the forests, yet they grow perfectly well 
century after century. If you suspect that there must be something haywire 
about the constant need for “feeding” garden plants, you’re right.
 
If a plant is well adapted to local conditions, it’s going to be satisfied with 
the nutrients that are naturally available in the soil. And if you can manage 
to resist raking up all the leaves, you allow valuable nutrients to remain in 
place, which means you don’t have to replace them with expensive, imported 
fertilizer.
If you just can’t stand to see leaves lying on the ground, then compost them 
and return them to the soil. (But hey — they call them leaves because you’re 
supposed to leave them there.) Oh, and when you do fertilize, be sure to 
use organic fertilizers, which come from natural, renewable, nonpetroleum 
sources, are less likely to burn plants, and are a lot kinder to the soil.
Pesticides
Plants in nature get pests and diseases just the same as the ones in your 
garden. In nature, though, there’s a better balance of pests and predators, 
and because the system is in a state of equipoise things are less likely to go 
wildly out of control. And, of course, nature doesn’t have the same attitude 
about pests and diseases as the average gardener. Humans tend to judge 
roses as beautiful and aphids as unbeautiful.
Even if you want to stay within the bounds of proper suburban order, you 
can control most pests pretty easily without resorting to wicked chemicals 
and warlike ways. Refer to Chapter 3 of Book VI for complete details on pest 
management.
Herbicides
Herbicides kill weeds. Weeds are plants that are both undesired and inclined 
to self-replicate to a troublesome degree. A lot of them are imported, but 
opinion makes a plant a weed, so natives don’t escape the designation.
Despite decades of herbicide use, you may have noticed that you still have as 
many weeds as ever. Something’s not working. Although you’ll never entirely 
get rid of weeds, there are some simple, sustainable strategies that work 
at least as well as the big chemical guns. See Chapter 3 of Book VI tells you 
more about this important subject.

Fossil fuels
Petroleum products (oil, gasoline, natural gas) are used everywhere in the 
garden. The first thing that comes to mind is gas-powered lawn mowers and 
other power garden equipment.
 
According to the EPA, Americans use over 800 million gallons of gas a year 
just mowing their lawns. Incredible. But there’s a whole lot more oil in those 
gardens. Have a look:
 
 Transportation of imported materials
 
 Transportation of tools, equipment, and workers
 
 Manufacturing of nearly everything used in the landscape
 
 Pumping water from its source to your house
 
 Chemically based fertilizers
 
 Many pesticides
 
 Plastics of all kinds, including irrigation pipe and materials, garden 
structures, furniture, and plant containers
 
 Construction processes that require power tools and heavy equipment
 
 Maintenance, including the use of power equipment
 
 Disposal, including trash hauling, green-waste processing and landfill 
management
By using hand tools, organic fertilizers, natural materials, and other low-
impact inputs, you can significantly reduce your garden’s dependence on 
fossil fuels. And if you use some of your property to grow food, you’ll reduce 
your own dependence on fossil fuels for food production and shipment.
 
In fact, many sustainable processes don’t just make things less bad, they 
make them a lot better than they were. Take this approach far enough, and 
your landscaping will go beyond sustainability to become a net producer of 
great stuff — food, fresh air, cooler homes, more wildlife, happier people and 
more. That’s when things get really good.
Time
Sustainable landscaping is stable landscaping, which means it isn’t always 
trying to blow itself to pieces if you leave it alone for a few days. With its own 
elegant system of checks and balances, it doesn’t really need much from you. A 
little benevolent nudging now and then is sufficient for the routine care of the 
landscape, with perhaps a long day in the garden once or twice a season. Know 
what that means? You have time to enjoy the garden instead of working in it 
every weekend!

Money
When you construct your landscape sustainably and maintain it sensibly, 
you spend less money on it over time. It may or may not cost you less to put 
in, but certainly it will cost less to care for because it makes fewer ongoing 
demands. Table 2-1 gives you a rough idea about how the costs differ.

Generating few (or no) outputs
Outputs — the so-called waste products of the landscape — occur because 
of inefficiencies in the design of the system. When a landscape is designed 
as a linear system (like an industrial process where materials are taken 
from nature, used once, and then thrown away), a lot of waste is inevitable. 
Nature is a cyclical system. Each element in a cyclical system stays within that 
system, eliminating the need for both inputs and waste.

391
 Chapter 2: Making Sustainable Decisions for Your Landscape Design
Book I
Sustainable 
Landscaping
 
You can minimize or even eliminate most outputs by optimizing your inputs. 
This give-and-take is the synergy of a finely tuned system at work. The follow-
ing sections focus on less desirable outputs, but, of course, some outputs are 
good — the oxygen given off by living plants, for example, or the food you 
grow in your garden. Never forget that a sustainable garden is a very fine 
thing to have around.
Green waste
Green waste is a fancy term for the plant parts we cut off and send to that 
magical place called “away.” Sometimes green waste ends up in a landfill, and 
sometimes it comes back to us as mulch.
Excess growth that just needs to be cut off and thrown away creates problems 
without any attendant benefits. Putting the wrong plant in the wrong place is 
one common cause of green waste — so much trimming to try to overcome a 
plant’s genetically determined size. Overwatering and overfertilizing both make 
plants grow faster and bigger (and lead to more green waste).
 
When you design your garden, carefully check the ultimate size of the plants 
you select and then locate them so that they have enough room to grow. 
Consider how much time you may be spending now just keeping overly large 
plants in place and then imagine a garden that required little or no pruning to 
control the size of things.
Polluted runoff
Polluted runoff is caused by rainfall or irrigation water moving pesticides, her-
bicides, fertilizers, dog poo, and other nasty stuff into streets, storm drains, and 
eventually bodies of water. Polluted runoff is a major problem all over the world, 
and you can correct it by simply not using all that junk in the first place. Nothing 
in, nothing out. You can deal with what little remaining pollution there might be 
on your property, mainly in the form of atmospheric pollution that settles on 
your land and rooftops in between rains, by keeping rainwater on site when it’s 
safe and practical to do so. You can use dry streambeds, underground percola-
tion chambers, bioswales, green roofs, pervious paving, and other strategies that 
allow water to soak in rather than run off and bioremediate pollutants through 
the natural action of plants and soil microorganisms. Sustainable Landscaping For 
Dummies (Wiley) gives you information on all these techniques.
Air pollution
Also consider the emissions produced by humans engaged in pernicious 
gardening activities, such as operating power lawn and garden equipment, 
spraying volatile pesticides and herbicides, and so on. In fact, the small 
engines used in powered outdoor gear emit enough hydrocarbons, carbon 
monoxide, and nitrogen oxides to qualify as the largest single contributor 
to nonvehicle hydrocarbon emissions. Not only that, 17 million gallons of 
gasoline are spilled each year by people trying to refill their lawnmowers; 
that’s more than was spilled in the Exxon Valdez incident!

392
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
 
Here’s what you can do to cut back your landscape’s contributions to air 
pollution:
 
 Reduce lawn areas and oversized plants so that you don’t have to trim 
and mow as much.
 
 Use hand tools whenever you can.
 
 If you must use power tools, use electric ones.
 
 Trade in your old gas mower on a newer, less polluting one. The same 
goes for other power equipment.
 
 Keep equipment in proper operating condition.
 
 Stop using pesticides and herbicides.
Reconsidering Your Sources
 
One of the best ways to mess up your sustainable game plan is to mindlessly 
drive over to Home World and get a bunch of the same old stuff without 
asking yourself or the clerks where it came from and what the impacts of the 
purchase will be, both in your landscape and at the source of the materials. 
There’s such a wide range of impacts that it’s essential to consider where all 
your materials and supplies will be coming from.
Suburban lawns and gardens receive more pesticides per acre than agricul-
ture. Some of the unfortunate outcomes include cancer, birth defects, repro-
ductive effects, neurotoxicity, liver and kidney damage, endocrine disruption, 
and others. Children are especially susceptible because they absorb more 
pesticides in relation to their body mass. This effect is in addition to the 
harmful effects on birds, fish, bees, and other wildlife. Amazingly, only a tiny 
percentage of the lawn and garden chemicals sold are tested for safety or for 
the environmental side effects of their use.
Additionally, some of the building materials common to landscaping projects 
offer their own toxicity problems. Table 2-2 shows some toxic and harmful 
landscape materials and nontoxic alternatives.

Building Your Sustainable Landscape: 
Concepts for Design
 
A sustainable landscape can also be a fun landscape. There’s no reason to 
give up the things you love or become the eyesore of the neighborhood in 
order to be sustainable. You just have to make sensible choices and design 
for sustainability as well as for the other aspects of the landscape.
Chances are that you already understand good design on some level. It’s not 
that much of a leap from appreciating a well-designed landscape to creating 
one. Apply these principles to your project, and you’ll soon see a wonderful 
garden emerge.
Unity
Any garden that’s a chaotic mish-mosh of all sorts of plants, ten kinds of paving 
materials, and a zillion different colors is more disconcerting than relaxing. 
Conversely, a space that’s composed of harmonious elements, with a consis-
tent and comprehensible color scheme and an overall sense of hang-together, 
is pleasing to both the eye and the mind — a place where one wants to linger.
How do you create unity? First, decide on a style for the garden: formal, natu-
ral, geometric, curvy, rectilinear — whatever you like and whatever is appro-
priate to the surroundings. Then pick plants and hardscape elements that 
look good together and use them repeatedly throughout the design. Choose a 
suitable color scheme — more on that in the upcoming “Color” section.
 
Unless you’re a master of design, keep the number of elements in your plan 
fairly minimal — a few kinds of plants, one or two hardscape materials, not 
too many precious trinkets. Think Zen.

394
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Balance
Nobody likes a loudmouth. Yet some landscapes have one or more elements that 
scream at you and overshadow their counterparts instead of working in concert 
with them. If the purpose of your garden is to create a sense of anxiety, go ahead 
and color your patio hot pink. Sometimes an outrageous approach can be won-
derful. But most of us want a soothing place to hang out, which means keeping 
the rude surprises to a minimum. Unity and balance go hand in hand.
In a formal garden, balance is achieved through right-left symmetry: one lilac 
on the left and an identical lilac on the right. In an informal garden, balance is 
asymmetrical, with varying elements skillfully combined into a composition 
that has overall balance without being rigid.
Repetition
Don’t be afraid of repeating strong design elements; doing so makes the 
design that much stronger. Think of a forest with a million of the same kind 
of tree, each with the same understory vegetation. We find this beautiful, yet 
most people seem timid about using repetition in their landscaping.
 
Of course, each of these principles depends on sensitive application to be 
successful. Repetition carried too far creates a tedious scene, while lack of 
repetition works hard against unity. Think about a piece of music, how it 
keeps coming back to a refrain and how phrases repeat throughout the piece 
but only at the appropriate moments and within a comprehensible, pleasing 
pattern. That’s how a well-designed landscape should work. The idea is to 
keep it interesting, intriguing, and understandable.
Contrast and variety
The dance between repetition and variety is a delicate one. Including elements 
that contrast with one another in color, form, shape, and overall character can 
add a lot of life to the composition. Light-colored foliage against a dark back-
ground, rough natural stones abutting very refined smooth concrete, patterns 
of sun and shade — all these combinations contribute to a lively scene.
Scale
Keep things in proper proportion. An overly large tree can dwarf a house, 
dominating the whole environment (and also perhaps making the house dank 
and gloomy, as well as using a lot of water, needing very costly professional 

395
 Chapter 2: Making Sustainable Decisions for Your Landscape Design

Landscaping
care, and maybe even presenting the danger of falling over). Similarly, a patio 
that’s too small looks silly and probably doesn’t meet the needs of its users.
Shape
Decide on a shape family for your layout — rectilinear, curvilinear, angular, 
or free-form. A landscape made up of strongly geometric shapes can be very 
formal (if it’s symmetrical) or elegantly restful (such as a Japanese garden). 
On the other end of the spectrum, a free-form approach is best suited to the 
naturalistic garden. But even the free-form is not free of form, it’s just more 
subtle. Study wild natural areas to see how this works.
Line
Lines in the garden are created by plantings, hardscape, and other elements. 
Lines can be very explicit, such as an allée (long double row) of trees, or 
subtle, such as a gently curving path. Line leads the eye through the scene 
and helps make sense of the elements it contains.
Lines can run parallel or perpendicular to buildings and other existing struc-
tural elements, or you can place them at angles. This latter approach usually 
has more visual energy and creates a feeling of movement and depth. It’s 
especially useful in making small spaces seem bigger. Curves are also quite 
lively and can make for a delightful sense of movement.
Focal points and vantage points
Imagine sitting out in the back yard on a balmy summer’s evening, watching 
the water dance in your fountain. Or coming around a corner and seeing a 
gorgeous persimmon tree laden with fruit, its leaves starting to turn color. 
Those attention-grabbing elements are called focal points. Any strong and 
striking visual element, such as a piece of sculpture or a particularly stunning 
plant, can be a focal point in your composition. Without good focal points, 
the eye searches in vain for a place to rest.
Every focal point has at least one vantage point — that is, a place from which 
it is viewed. This spot may be your patio, the living room sofa, or a bench. 
When you design, make the creation of focal points and vantage points one of 
the first things you think about.
 
Too many focal points weaken the design and create the same confusion as 
having none at all: The eye has no place to land.

396
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Form
Think of shape as the two-dimensional arrangement of the elements of the 
landscape when viewed from above and form as the three-dimensional space 
that things occupy when viewed from ground level.
For example, a sheared boxwood hedge has a strict rectilinear form, whereas 
an Italian cypress or poplar tree will have an upright columnar form, and a 
spreading oak tree grows in the form of a broad canopy. Each form has a par-
ticular role to play. The boxwood leads one along a path, the upright cypress 
is like a giant exclamation point, and the oak embraces and shelters the area 
beneath it. Study plants and books about plants to learn the vocabulary of 
forms you can use.
 
Be sure to include some plants with strap-shaped leaves, such as Iris, or 
some bold succulents like Agaves in your plantings. Strap-shaped plants act 
as points of emphasis, and their contrast to leafier textures and shrubbier 
forms really enlivens a planting.
Texture
A tropical Philodendron with leaves 6 feet across is said to have a coarse 
texture. A tiny-leaved thyme plant has a very fine texture. Designers contrast 
textures for appealing combinations, playing coarse against fine, and repeat-
ing the play of textures using different plants. Different textures, when com-
bined skillfully with nicely partnered colors, is a key element in what makes 
plantings work well.
This principle also applies to hardscape. Sometimes a surface made of large 
tiles looks great in a small space because the texture is unexpected and 
makes the area seem roomier than it is. The texture of paving, walls, wood-
work, and other manmade elements contributes much to the overall effect.
 
You can use texture to create a sense of depth by placing finer textures in the 
background, or to create drama by purposely placing a coarse-textured plant 
in an unexpected location.
Color
Color works to create many different effects. A multicolored planting is 
upbeat and happy — or chaotic, if handled poorly. A monochromatic color 
scheme can be elegant or boring, depending on the context. Contrasting 
colors create an assertive look, and harmonizing colors make for soothing 
surroundings. Bright colors advance, and cool ones recede. Hot colors are 
stimulating, and pastels are restful and calming.

397
 Chapter 2: Making Sustainable Decisions for Your Landscape Design
Book I
Sustainable 
Landscaping
Don’t forget that foliage colors play a strong role, too. And don’t overlook the 
seasonal changes that can be challenging to a novice designer but that can 
also reward with interesting color shifts as the year progresses from spring 
through summer, fall, and winter. Match the fresh green leaves of spring 
with brightly colored flowers and then later in the year key the autumn foli-
age to more somber autumn colors by using fall-blooming plants. The tricks 
you can play are endless. Use the plant lists in gardening books to plan your 
color schemes by season. And visit nurseries and gardens to see real plants 
in bloom.
Hardscape has a color scheme, too. Sometimes it’s really fun to use an outra-
geous bright red or purple or yellow piece of art in a focal point where it will 
have a stunning impact amid subtle plantings.
 
From a sustainability perspective, the color of pavement can affect the liv-
ability of the area. The relative reflectivity (or albedo, as fancy-pants land-
scape architects like to call it) of a surface can make it hot or cool, pleasant 
or otherwise.

ardscape is a fancy term for parts of the landscape that are not plants 
or irrigation. Patios, decks, and fences are hardscape. So are lighting 
systems, art, retaining walls, ponds, and plaster lawn squirrels.
Sustainable hardscape is a part of a living landscape, emphasizing plants 
and biological elements over industrial elements made of concrete, steel, 
plastic, and other manmade materials. Conventional hardscape, on the other 
hand, can be needy and troublesome. It’s made up of materials that are taken 
from the planet in often abusive ways, leaving behind a trail of devastation. 
Hardscape materials are often toxic, nonrenewable, and high in embodied 
energy and transported from far away using climate-wrecking fossil fuels. 
Their operation and upkeep can require toxic finishing substances and 
energy-intensive processes. Finally, hardscape is not self-renewing like 
plants; you can’t grow a patio from seeds.
Despite all the negatives, hardscape can be done in less damaging ways, and 
it certainly has its place in the sustainable landscape. Every garden needs 
basic hardscape features, such as paths, places to sit and entertain, safe 
ways to get up and down hillsides, and enclosures. Hardscape adds so much 
to the visual quality of the landscape as well. With the right approach, you 
can have great hardscape features without all the environmental problems.

Preparing Your Site
If you take the time to design a truly sustainable landscape, you’re selling 
your yard short by taking shortcuts when the time comes to get down and 
dirty. To get your landscape ready for the changes ahead, you need to keep 
your own safety in mind and — as in all matters sustainable landscape — 
stay alert to how you’re treating the earth.
First, make a mess: Demolition
The old-school approach to demolition was to push the old yard into a dump-
ster and send it away to the landfill. But there is no “away”: Everything we 
dispose of causes problems somewhere. Instead of treating the unwanted 
parts of your existing landscaping as waste, look for ways to use it in con-
structing your new landscaping. Set aside soil, trees, broken concrete, useful 
plants, and even artsy junk for later use. Find homes for re-usable castoffs, 
such as the bricks from your old patio or excess soil. Recycle where appro-
priate, sending green waste to the local composting operation instead of 
mixing it with other materials in a dumpster.
 
Keep nature safe, too. Don’t park equipment or store heavy materials under 
trees where it will compact soil in the root zone. Protect against erosion by 
installing straw wattles or silt fencing at the base of piles of soil that might 
wash away in the rains. Avoid working in wildlife habitat or nesting sites. 
Keep soil out of waterways.
Locate utilities
Utilities come into your property underground as well as overhead. Before you 
start digging, you need to determine the exact location of gas and water mains, 
power lines, telephone and television cables, sewer pipes, and any other utili-
ties serving the site. You may also have utility easements running through your 
property and transmission lines or pipes within those easements.
 
Why call the utility company to locate your utility lines before you get started? 
Umm . . . well . . . is the potential for death enough reason for you? A lot of nice 
folks have blown themselves up hitting gas lines, fried themselves poking into 
underground electric wires, disrupted phone service to whole neighborhoods, 
and had other highly humbling misadventures. Don’t be one of them.
Fixing damaged utilities is incredibly expensive, and so is paying the fines for 
not following the law that says you have to find your utilities with something 
other than a backhoe or pickaxe.

You need to locate underground items, including water and gas lines, drain 
pipes, sewer lines, and possibly electric or phone lines. To ease the process, 
look up your state’s free One Call service (dial 811 or visit www.call811.
com); with one call from you, it contacts all the utility providers serving your 
property and arranges to have them come out and flag everything. Within a 
couple of days, everything will be identified, and you can dig with confidence.
Earthwork: Grading and drainage
Grading determines how long water remains on the land, its path across the sur-
face of the ground, and whether it soaks usefully into the ground or runs off to 
cause erosion, flooding, and pollution. Grading keeps the house safe from flood-
ing, creates usable areas, and sculpts dull terrain into elegant, sensual forms.
 
You do grading just once, and you need to do it properly because you can’t 
change it unless you remove all the plants.
The sustainable approach is to do as little grading as possible because soil is 
damaged when it’s moved around, and the heavy equipment that’s required 
compacts soil and may damage tree roots. You should also only grade for 
good reason, such as conserving water on site, preventing erosion, or keep-
ing the house from flooding.
 
Avoid bringing soil in or taking it away if you can. Both can be disruptive to 
off-site locations and involve the usual pollution and fossil-fuel dependency 
of trucking and heavy equipment use. In addition, when you import topsoil, 
you run the risk of also importing new kinds of weeds, diseases, and even 
toxic substances.
Sometimes you can’t avoid moving soil on or off the site. In those situations, 
try to find a good home for your soil so that it can used to repair a dam-
aged site rather than to create new problems. And ask about the source of 
imported soil, perhaps even requesting a complete soil test as a condition of 
purchase. You probably won’t get far with this tactic, but it’s worth a try.
Control weeds the safe way
Pretty much every site has weeds. Weeds are hard to control because they’ve 
evolved to be aggressive, sneaky, virile, and just plain annoying. If you don’t 
get the weeds under control before you install your landscaping, they’ll come 
right through and make a mess of your lovely work. Annual weeds come back 
from seed, and perennial weeds poke up from old root systems.

Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
 
We won’t mention any names, but certain herbicides have been applied to our 
poor suffering planet for decades now, and yet there seem to be just as many 
weeds as ever. Seems like we’re losing the battle despite all the poisons. It’s 
just another example of how conventional methods don’t really work.
Sheet mulching is the practice of killing weeds by smothering them. Hoe out 
any surface weeds, cover the soil with two or three layers of corrugated 
cardboard salvaged from the waste stream, overlap the cardboard and wet 
it down thoroughly, and then cover the whole funny-looking mess with at 
least 4 inches of organic mulch, such as wood chips. Leave it there for a few 
months if you can. Sheet mulching has proven to be more effective than her-
bicides, which can also take months to fully kill weeds.
Horticultural vinegar is another keen way to kill weeds without nasty chemi-
cals. It works best on young weeds and doesn’t kill every weed in the book, 
but it’s pretty effective on many. Horticultural vinegar is stronger than the 
vinegar you cook or clean with, so treat it with care as you would any other 
strong acid. Weeds will often die within a couple of hours. Your yard will 
smell like a salad for a short while, but other than that, it’s utterly harmless.
 
A 3 to 4-inch thick layer of organic mulch, such as shredded bark or wood 
chips, will create the conditions to keep most weeds out and will weaken 
the ones that make it through so that they’re easy to pull by hand. Turn to 
Chapter 3 of Book VI to find out more about the wonders of mulching.
 
Low ground covers and bare ground attract weeds like crazy. Choose plants 
that grow tall and provide a dense canopy of foliage, and weed seeds never 
make it to the light. I call these knee-high plants, and they’re the most sustain-
able way to keep the weeds down without using herbicides.
Trim the trees
Get your big trees in shape before you start any landscaping. Your project 
will be easier and cheaper if workers don’t have to pussyfoot through new 
plantings. Choose your tree care company carefully. A hundred years of 
growth can be destroyed in minutes by improper care.
 
Invest in the expertise of an arborist certified by the International Society of 
Arboriculture or the American Society of Consulting Arborists. An arborist 
really knows how to look at trees and can identify health or safety problems 
that you’d never see on your own.

Using Sustainable Hardscape Features 
to Build an Outdoor Room
The idea of the outdoor room goes far back in the history of landscape design. 
Cro-Magnon cave owners in the Paleolithic Era had spacious outdoor rooms 
that they used for eviscerating woolly mammoths and entertaining visit-
ing troglodytes. Over time, the idea evolved into the modern outdoor room 
equipped with 50 square feet of barbecue grill surface, two convection ovens, 
a big-screen TV, spa, fitness center, and maid’s quarters. Somewhere between 
these two extremes lies the sensible, sustainable Outdoor Room of the Future.
Just as the rooms in your house are specialized for certain activities — 
eating, entertaining, bathing, sleeping, storage — so can the landscape be 
divided into areas with particular functions. Many outdoor rooms are more 
versatile than indoor ones, combining functions that you’d never pair up 
indoors, such as providing a place for lounge chairs, bouncing light into the 
house, and soaking up rainwater. (Permaculture, a methodology of holistic 
design, calls this multiple-use approach stacking functions, and it’s a hallmark 
of sustainable design.)
 
The ideal outdoor room should feel like it’s a part of nature. An overabun-
dance of manmade structures and appliances is not only environmentally 
unsound, it creates a setting that’s too much like the indoors. The whole 
appeal of having landscaping in the first place is to be closer to natural 
things, so why muck it up with a lot of hardware? After all, the Garden of 
Eden didn’t have a spa and an 8-burner barbecue.
Coming home: Entry space
Getting to your front door is an important daily act for your family and 
others. The experience should be comfortable, safe, and welcoming. You 
want a pathway that leads unambiguously to the house, that’s wide enough 
to accommodate two people walking side by side (so at least 4 feet, 6 inches), 
and is smooth, safe, and well lit. Sidewalk pavement must be durable and free 
of hazards, which means a solid, smooth path of concrete, brick, tile, grouted 
flagstone or some other permanent, hard-wearing surface.
 
To reduce the environmental impact, use bricks or paver blocks securely set 
on sand (so that they can be re-used), or high-volume fly ash concrete (which 
makes use of a waste stream product and reduces production of CO2).

404
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Here are some other tips for entries:
 
 Provide safe paved landings in the planter space between the curb and 
sidewalk so that passengers can alight onto a passable surface and not 
have to step on your flowers or leap over stickery junipers.
 
 If possible, avoid making people walk up the driveway. Provide a com-
pletely separate entry path, or at the very least widen the driveway to 
accommodate pedestrian traffic, using a contrasting and classier-looking 
material for the paths.
 
 Consider using shrubs and trees to partially screen the view of the 
street from the front door and create a gentle transition between outside 
and in.
 
 Avoid an excessively direct or indirect path to the front door. Change 
directions a couple of times, providing wider landing spaces at turning 
points and offering an attractive focal point or two such as a fountain, 
piece of art, or special plant.
 
 If your situation and zoning regulations permit it, incorporate outdoor 
living space, such as a patio, in the front yard. Use fencing or shrubbery 
to conceal it from the street. A front-yard patio works especially well 
where the back yard is small or when the front yard offers a pleasant 
microclimate.
 
 Keep grades gentle (no steeper than 5 percent) or provide safe, well-
designed steps.
 
 The landing at the front door should be large enough for a small group 
of people to gather briefly when coming or going and be free from steps 
or level changes. The landing should be just a couple of inches lower 
than the floor inside the house.
 
 If you’re part of a homeowners association, check to see what you’re 
permitted (and required) to do in the front yard. Also check zoning regu-
lations and setback requirements.
Keeping the cars happy: Parking
The automobile is with us for the foreseeable future, and both yours and 
those of your guests need to be parked somewhere. Your driveway is prob-
ably already in place, but ponder the possibilities of reorienting it or making 
it smaller or more environmentally friendly. Here are some tips:
 
 Make your driveway pervious, meaning that water can find its way 
through. Runoff from driveways causes flooding and pollution. Use 
pervious concrete, pervious paver blocks, gravel, or a vegetated paving 
system so that water soaks in and is used by plants rather than going 
into the gutter.

405

Landscaping
 
 Mulch or gravel guest parking and turn-around space instead of paving 
it. Mulch and gravel are permeable and much lower impact than con-
crete or other formal paving (but gravel attracts weeds).
 
 Allow at least a 9-x-18-foot space for each car and also allow room beside 
parking spaces so that doors can be opened and people have a place to 
alight when getting out of the car.
Living and entertaining space
The patio is usually the heart of the garden and can serve many purposes. 
Here are a few things to keep in mind when planning a patio:
 
 Your main patio should be large enough to accommodate whatever 
size group will be using it frequently. Don’t make it big enough for 
your largest parties; those happen only once in a while, and you can 
accommodate them by setting up tables and chairs in lawn or meadow 
space. A couple of lounge chairs require a space at least 8 feet by 8 feet. 
Generally, a family-sized patio should be around 12 feet on each side. 
Breaking up the patio into subspaces is okay — for example, dining in 
one area, sitting area nearby, cooking not far away, and so on.
 
 Look for places other than right outside the house to put your patio. 
Outdoor furniture isn’t usually so attractive that you want to make it the 
focal point of the yard from inside the house, so if the furnished area is 
off to one side, you’ll have a clear view (and clear passage for foot traf-
fic) into the back yard. Think about making the main patio an “away” 
place, somewhat distant from the house, so that you feel you’re more 
immersed in the garden and less connected to the hubbub of indoor life.
 
 Place smaller patios at other locations: a spot for a couple of chairs out-
side the master bedroom, a meditation nook half-lost in the back of the 
property, a zone for the teenagers to hang out.
 
 Think about microclimate when you choose the location for your patio. 
If you’ll be using it mainly on summer afternoons, and if your climate is 
a hot one, place your patio on the north or east side of the house away 
from the scalding sun. If you plan to use the patio for breakfast in a cool 
climate, put it on the east side of the house where morning sun will 
warm chilly bones.
 
 Evaluate wind conditions, sheltering the patio from prevailing winds by 
locating it in the lee of existing structures or vegetation, or by creating 
new fences, walls, or plantings to provide a windbreak.
 
 Consider proximity to neighbors, street noise, trash cans, and other 
odor sources, traffic patterns, and immediate and distant views.
 
 Take the relationship to indoor rooms into account. Locate the dining 
patio fairly close to the kitchen and not so close to the bedrooms, for 
example.

406
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
 
 Decide whether you want to surround your patio with walls or vegetation 
or have it covered by a canopy of manmade structures or overhanging 
trees. Enclosed spaces are intimate and room-like; if there are no views or 
they’re unpleasant, then the enclosed approach works well. If you have a 
great view, locate the patio to take advantage of it. An overhead covering 
can be dense or open, rainproof or not, and it can extend over all or only 
part of the patio space to allow for shady and sunny areas.
 
 Patio surfaces are usually made of solid material, such as concrete, 
tile, or flagstone, or wood decking where the terrain is too steep for 
a masonry surface. But consider lower impact (and also less costly) 
materials, such as mulch, gravel, or other pervious materials where 
use will be light.
Dining areas
This function is often accommodated by the main patio, but a separate area 
is tidier and can be near the main patio area, which you can use as temporary 
overflow dining space for large parties. Here are some planning tips:
 
 A dining table and chairs takes up a minimum 10 feet by 10 feet space.
 
 Make sure that the patio surface is smooth and nearly level.
 
 Allow room for a counter or side table to use as a buffet.
 
 Overhead lighting makes evening dining easier.
 
 Conceal the dining area from view of neighbors and the public.
 
 Screen to keep out bugs if they’re a problem in your area.
Recreation and sports
Kids, adults, and pets all need recreation spaces. Generally, these areas 
should be on level ground, on safe surfaces, and away from quiet spaces or 
fragile plantings.
 
Formal recreation courts (tennis, basketball, and so on) are not all that sus-
tainable, using up lots of resources and requiring impermeable surfaces and 
regular maintenance. Similarly, swimming pools are pretty over-the-top, with 
their immense demands for energy and water. Why not save yourself big 
bucks by enjoying the local public facilities and use your yard to grow food 
instead?

Work spaces
Garden work space can be as simple as a potting bench or as complex as a 
greenhouse for getting a head start on the veggie season. Work spaces include 
storage areas, an outdoor extension of a garage workshop, vegetable prep 
areas, or a spot for a special hobby. Try these tips for setting up a work space:
 
 Work areas aren’t always so tidy looking, so site them for both 
convenience to related indoor rooms and concealment from the rest of 
the garden.
 
 Keep them away from living areas and neighbors if they’re sources of 
noise.
 
 Provide enclosed storage that blends with the surroundings; add a 
lean-to storage compartment onto the side of a building, for example.
 
 Provide power, water, and other utilities. If you include a sink, have it 
drain into an underground soak zone in the garden (assuming that you 
won’t be using any toxics but just washing off pots and veggies).
Floors: Patios and Decks
Unlike the other elements of the hardscape system, floors get walked on and 
stuff gets dragged across them, stored on them, and displayed on them. They 
need to withstand traffic, but they don’t necessarily need to be solid to do so. 
A resilient floor of mulch is quite suitable for many uses, and it’s natural and 
sustainable and cheap. Other situations demand something more durable. 
Each of the many available materials has its own characteristics, uses, and 
degrees of sustainability. They vary from the extremely natural (mulch, 
gravel, flagstone, wood) to the clearly manmade (tile, concrete). They can be 
loose and re-usable (brick or pavers on sand) or permanent (the not-very-
sustainable poured concrete).
Individual pieces, such as bricks or paving blocks, are referred to as unit 
pavers. You can often install unit pavers many different patterns. Living 
paving materials, such as turf and ground covers, vary in their ability to with-
stand foot and vehicle traffic and in their maintenance requirements.
 
From a sustainability point of view, many paving choices have unacceptable 
negative impacts. Concrete used to make paving comes from materials that 
are strip-mined, the processes used to convert raw materials to cement are 
energy-intensive and generate gobs of CO2, and transport of the material 
to the site depends on big trucks that get lousy gas mileage. Even things as 
simple as crushed rock, decomposed granite, and mulch create damage at 
their sources and use petroleum for processing and transport.

408
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Some aspects of hardscape production are improving. The manufacturing of 
cement for concrete production is incredibly energy-intensive and generates 
5 to 10 percent of the world’s CO2 emissions, but improvements in the pro-
cesses are dramatically lowering that figure. Newly developed technologies 
like nano-concrete are very promising, and a new type of concrete actually 
absorbs huge amounts of air pollution.
 
There are also some pretenders to sustainability — materials with question-
able or fraudulent environmental credentials. These materials include (per-
haps debatably) plastic lumber and (not at all debatably) mulch made from 
ground-up tires and phony plastic lawns.
Stick with materials that are as close to a state of nature as possible and ones 
that require a minimum of processing and maintenance. Build something that 
lasts, because durability is a supremely sustainable strategy, dividing the ini-
tial inputs over many decades of usefulness.
Don’t forget heritage materials, ones that can be re-used over and over again. 
These items include bricks, concrete pavers, or flagstone — as long as 
they’re laid on sand and not permanently mortared in place. And, of course, 
tap the waste stream for urbanite (broken concrete) and other materials that 
can be rescued from an eternity in landfill hell.
 
Because solid paving sheds water, it can be an unfriendly part of the water-
shed, causing flooding and pollution from runoff. Choosing pervious surfaces 
is one way to deal with that concern, but you can also use (and even pur-
posely choose) impervious surfaces to act as water catchment zones that 
spill their captured water into a bioswale, planted area, or other spot where 
it will be put to use.
Safe, sustainable surfaces
Here are some surfaces that you can feel good about. None is perfect, but 
they all get you a floor with less impact than many materials.
 
 Living ground covers: Making a living floor follows the key principle of 
choosing biological solutions before technological ones. Options include 
low-growing plants, such as thyme, chamomile, or yarrow, as well as 
conventional turf. Unmowed, these plants make a gorgeous natural 
meadow; mowed, they form a walkable, playable turf. Nearly all require 
some watering and fertilizing, but almost any ground cover is less needy 
than turf. Of course, living plants won’t take the kind of abuse that a 
harder surface will, and they can be troublesome to walk on, especially 
when wet. Reserve them for low-traffic and play areas.

 Mulch: Biodegradable, and beneficial for the soil beneath your feet, 
mulch is the daddy of all sustainable pavements — so darn natural it 
could have come from your own back yard (and if you got the chips 
from tree trimming, perhaps it did). It looks good, smells good, and 
lets water through. It also keeps the weeds down and the roots of your 
plants happy.
 
 Mulch does have some shortcomings: It isn’t the best for sitting chairs 
on, as the legs can sink, and it’s not so great for handicapped access.
 
 Gravel or crushed rock: Taken from riverbeds or quarries, gravel or 
crushed rock do come at an environmental price. And surfaces covered 
with them tend to attract weeds. Use them sparingly, where their sim-
plicity, perviousness, and nice crunchy sound underfoot are welcome.
 
 Urbanite: This newly discovered “mineral” is nothing more than old 
broken concrete paving, used like flagstones to make what the British call 
crazy paving. Urbanite is the ultimate waste-stream material, with no envi-
ronmental impact other than transport. It can be stained or used as is, 
and it makes a lovely surface. Urbanite is available nearly everywhere.
 
 Pervious concrete: This one’s great for driveways and other heavy-
traffic surfaces. It’s regular concrete without the sand; just crushed 
rock, portland cement, and water. It comes out looking like a giant rice 
cake, and the voids between the bits of rock slurp up water at up to 350 
inches per hour — that’s hallelujah! level. Pervious concrete can take 
plenty of weight. It can be colored. The top can be ground for a more 
attractive and smoother surface. (Visit www.perviouspavement.org 
or www.concretenetwork.com for details.)
 
 Vegetated paving systems: Imagine a honeycomb of recycled plastic 
panels supporting the weight of a vehicle, with turf or wildflowers grow-
ing out of the soil-filled, open-topped cells or a similarly open concrete 
grid. Vegetated paving systems go by many names and offer a wonderful 
solution for driveways, overflow parking areas, and fire lanes. Because 
of their open surface they’re not suited to patios, but they make your 
driveway look totally rad.
 
 Paver blocks: All the rage for the past few years, paver blocks aren’t 
very permeable, but specially designed ones absorb rainfall at the rate 
of around an inch per hour. This level isn’t even close to the pervious-
ness of pervious concrete, but it’s better than a solid surface. Paver 
blocks are good for driveways, paths, and patios, and re-usable.
 
 High-volume fly ash concrete: This concrete looks and acts like regular 
concrete but is made with a waste product of coal-burning power plants. 
Fly ash makes concrete stronger and taps the waste stream. Specify high 
volume fly ash concrete for nearly any concrete application.

410
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Considering maintenance
Most paved surfaces require little maintenance as long as you don’t make the 
mistake of painting them. For most applications, don’t waste your money on 
sealers and stains; leave surfaces to age naturally and gracefully. If you start 
applying finishes, there’s no end to the scraping, sanding, sandblasting, prim-
ing, and painting that you have to do.
Of course, living surfaces require weeding, watering, and other normal plant 
care. Choose species that are adapted to your area and learn their needs 
before your make your decision.
Choosing between a patio and a deck
Decks are made from renewable natural materials, for the most part, or from 
plastic lumber made from soda containers, grocery bags, and wood waste. 
Their embodied energy is fairly low, and if you avoid toxic finishes, a deck 
can be a reasonable addition to your landscaping.
Still, decks come with environmental problems. They’re made from wood, 
and trees generally have to be cut down to get the wood out. That means 
partial or total destruction of a forest somewhere. If you use wood for a 
deck (or for any other garden structure), be sure it’s certified as sustain-
ably harvested by the Forest Stewardship Council in the United States. The 
other approach, the plastic wood route, can set you up for a smelly deck on 
hot days (and for hot feet if the wood is dark), and for potential off-gassing 
issues (though no one seems to know whether the stuff is bad for you or not). 
Finally, being made of wood, decks don’t last very long.
 
If you live in a high fire hazard area, check with local authorities about spe-
cial regulations for decks, which can be a fire magnet if not built right.
Patios can have nasty impacts, too, but generally speaking, they’re easier, 
more durable, and cheaper. The rub comes when you have a hillside that has 
to be leveled and stabilized before it will support the weight of a patio. That 
can mean a very costly retaining wall system and still more environmental 
impact. That’s when decks start to look good.
 
The bottom line? If you have a steep slope, consider a deck. If your ground is 
stable and close to level, stick with a patio.

Walls: Free-Standing and Retaining
Walls come in two basic flavors: Free-standing walls enclose space to create 
privacy, make an area secure, or improve the microclimate; retaining walls 
do the hard work of holding back slopes.
Creating privacy with walls and fences
Use walls or fences to block views of neighbors, creating an enclosed court-
yard or walled garden. For complete privacy, make your enclosure at least 6 
feet high and solid. Lower, more open walls may be suitable where you want 
to feel less boxed-in or where regulations prevent you from building a taller 
wall. Walls don’t have to be out at the boundaries; use interior walls to create 
outdoor rooms and break up the space into interesting subspaces.
 
Solid enclosures change the microclimate. They create shade on one side and 
sun on the other, block or channel winds, and sometimes absorb or reflect 
heat. Handled properly, these characteristics can be desirable, but if you 
aren’t aware of the changes you’ll be creating, you may end up with trouble.
Adding walls and fences 
for security and safety
Keeping people and animals in or out of your property requires sturdy bar-
riers. The most sustainable of these is thorny or otherwise impenetrable 
shrubs, but small or determined interlopers can still make their way through. 
For complete security, choose a solid wall of masonry, adobe, or other truly 
impenetrable material or use chain-link fencing, which is made of recyclable 
steel. Don’t forget secure gates.
Windy sites call for something to intercept or divert the wind from use areas, 
which not only increases comfort but reduces heating and cooling needs. 
Trees and shrubs are good at blocking wind because they’re noncontiguous 
and flexible, absorbing energy efficiently. Solid fences and walls can actually 
worsen wind on the lee side by creating an eddy effect. Slatted or louvered 
fencing does a better job, as does a fence with an angled top to change the 
flow characteristics. If you choose a wooden fence, try to find certified sus-
tainably harvested lumber, which still lessens the impact considerably, and 
avoid using posts that have been pressure- treated with arsenic; nontoxic 
treated wood is commonly available these days. Earthen berms or mounds 
can also direct wind. And, of course, there’s nothing more sustainable than 
simply piling up earth that’s already on the site.

412
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Using walls for retaining slopes
Retaining walls are really in a category of their own. Because they support 
impressive loads, they need to be treated as a structural element as well as 
a visual and functional one. Cutting and filling soil to create level ground on 
a slope may call for retaining walls on the high and/or low sides to hold the 
disturbed soil in place. This can be a wonderful, if expensive, way to increase 
the usable space on your property.
The most basic kind of retaining wall is the gravity wall, which is simply a 
mass of solid material, such as concrete or dry-laid stone. Gravity walls are 
suitable for level changes of up to 3 feet in height and are a good DIY project. 
Sustainable materials include dry-stacked urbanite, stones from the site or 
nearby, or rubble. The newer mortarless individual stacking block systems, 
called segmental retaining walls, are made from concrete but can be re-used, 
making them a good heritage material.
You can also fashion gravity walls from wooden timbers, landscape ties, 
reclaimed redwood, or logs. You can use treated wood as well, but be sure to 
choose the kind that is free of arsenic. Adobe can be used for very low walls 
with little pressure on them, but keep in mind that holding back soil with 
more soil isn’t going to be all that much stronger than no wall at all.
For taller walls, and where there is a surcharge above the wall (that is, a slope 
rather than level ground), you need to use a cantilever wall, which is made up 
of two parts: a big flat concrete foundation called a base, and the vertical, vis-
ible portion called a stem. Together they form a T or L shape that’s very good 
at resisting the pressure of the soil it’s holding up.
 
For any cantilevered wall, any wall taller than 4 feet (including the base or 
footing), or any instance where there is a surcharge of soil behind the wall, 
get the help of a civil engineer to be sure the wall is designed properly — and 
don’t forget to look into building permit requirements.
Ceilings: Topping Off Your Room
The sky is a nice ceiling: It’s time-tested, colorful, attractive, durable, made 
from local materials, goes well with nearly any architectural style, and is very 
inexpensive. Consider sky for an expansive, interesting overhead.
Still, sometimes sky isn’t quite what you want. It doesn’t keep out the sun or 
rain, modify the microclimate, or give you that cozy, snuggly feeling of being 
sheltered by a room-height ceiling. That’s when you turn to other alternatives.

413

Book V
Sustainable 
Landscaping
Ceilings, living or manmade, offer shelter, shade, enclosure, privacy, 
architectural interest, and a place to hang your wind chimes. Take into 
consideration the following factors when pondering what kind of ceiling to 
include in your plans:
 
 Be sure you really need one. A very cool or foggy climate calls for 
openness to let in light and heat, not a shade-casting overhead.
 
 Check local zoning ordinances to be sure that you don’t put an overhead 
structure in a location on your property where it isn’t permitted. And 
ask whether you need a building permit for your structure.
 
 Choose a rainproof roof if you live in a wet climate or enjoy being out-
side during wet weather. Select a shady but open overhead to protect 
against heat and allow breezes to move through the area.
 
 Determine how much shade you want, because you can use the density 
of the structure to control the amount. If you use parallel louvers to cast 
shade, place them perpendicular to the rays of the sun; this placement is 
especially important for overheads located in the path of the setting sun.
 
 Take the path of the sun into account in placing your structure and 
don’t forget to estimate where the sun will be at different seasons as 
well as different times of the year.
 
 Think about leaving part of the area open to the sky so that you have a 
choice of sun or shade.
 
 Set the height of your ceiling so that it’s in scale with surrounding ele-
ments, and so that it creates the kind of feeling you want: tall ceilings 
feel open, low ones cozy.
 
 Don’t paint overhead structures. It costs money, uses resources, and, 
worst of all, is a huge pain to re-paint when the time comes, especially 
if you have to remove a covering of mature vines first. Stains are okay, 
as they’re water-based or made from an ecofriendly material like soy or 
beeswax.
 
 If you want a vine on your overhead, choose something that looks good 
from underneath, not just on top. (Most vines carry a lot of dead stuff 
beneath them.) Make sure that they don’t drop litter on your dinner. 
Use a deciduous vine if you want the sunlight to penetrate in winter. Try 
something edible, like grapes, to get more use out of the structure.
Living ceilings: trees
What’s more sustainable, durable, or beautiful than a tree? Name another 
overhead that creates oxygen, sequesters carbon, cools by evaporation, 
operates by solar power, costs practically nothing, provides habitat for birds 
and other organisms, is fun to climb, and makes flowers and fruit.

Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Avoid messy or weak-wooded trees, ones that might blow over, and certainly 
trees with root systems that lift pavement. As with all plantings, be sure that 
the tree you choose is adapted to your climate, soil, and other conditions 
and place it carefully so that it casts shade where you want it.
 
Deciduous trees (ones that lose their leaves in winter) automatically provide 
shade during summer and allow sunlight to penetrate in winter. Evergreen 
trees can make a good overhead, too, as long as you can use the shade all year.
Constructed ceilings
Attractive, sustainable overhead structures can be made of salvaged wood, 
driftwood, tree branches, canvas, or metal (especially good in high fire 
hazard areas). Unlike trees, constructed ceilings require skill to design and 
build and are usually subject to building codes in order to make them safe.
Making a living ecoroof
One of the coolest sustainable landscape elements is the living ecoroof, also 
known as a green roof. Made of drought-tolerant plants growing in a shallow 
layer of lightweight soil held in place by a waterproof membrane and sup-
porting structure, or by individual recycled plastic bins, the ecoroof turns 
your roof into a beautiful living ecosystem.
Ecoroofs are showing up all over the place, from tiny sheds covered in suc-
culents to the world’s largest, which covers 10 acres over a Ford Motor 
Company plant in Michigan. Some areas even offer tax credits for ecoroofs.
Ecoroofs offer any number of environmental advantages in addition to their 
special quirky charm. They
 
 Absorb rainwater, keeping it off the streets.
 
 Trap and bioremediate 70 percent of pollutants that fall on the roof.
 
 Produce oxygen and sequester carbon.
 
 Provide wildlife habitat, especially where native species are used.
 
 Reduce the urban heat island effect, which is the overheating of cities 
because of the huge expanses of dark pavement and rooftops.
 
 Lower temperatures inside the building.
 
 Increase the life of the roof.
 
 Can even produce food as well as ornamental plants.
 
 Offer positive benefits for human users: tranquility, delight, comfort, and 
improved mental health.

Sustainable 
Landscaping
There are two types of ecoroofs: extensive and intensive. The extensive 
ecoroof is planted with very drought-tolerant plants, such as Sedums and 
other succulents, and is rarely watered or managed. The extensive ecoroof 
is on its own, undemanding, and environmentally optimum. The intensive 
ecoroof is more of a roof garden, with a wider variety of plants, often watered 
and highly groomed, and producing flowers and possibly even food.
 
Before you go dragging a bunch of plants up to your roof, here are some 
important considerations:
 
 Ecoroofs aren’t a do-it-yourself project. Hire an expert to help you, 
because they require a lot of know-how.
 
 Ecoroofs are heavy, and so first you need to be sure your house can 
handle the extra weight. A structural engineer can help you; don’t 
scrimp on this step because nothing will spoil your day like a squashed 
house, especially if you’re in it.
 
 Ecoroofs can slide off if not properly anchored in place. This issue is not 
quite as bad as a squashed house, but it’s still no picnic.
 
To decide whether an ecoroof is for you and to find qualified ecoroof profes-
sionals in your area, visit Green Roofs for Healthy Cities at www.green
roofs.org or Greenroofs.com at www.greenroofs.com.
Creating Paths and Steps
Moving from one part of the landscape to another should be as close to 
effortless as possible. Yet, paths can also be an exciting element, leading you 
on a journey that’s full of interesting focal points and discoveries.
Practical paths should be straight or gently curved and as level as possible. 
Locate paths along natural lines of travel so that passage is comfortable and 
people don’t cut corners. For high-traffic areas, choose solid, wear-resistant 
paving; for secondary and occasionally used paths select something inexpen-
sive and organic, such as wood chip mulch.
For a good-looking design, keep your materials simple and avoid mixing too 
many kinds of materials. Match the material for the paths to those of other 
paved surfaces.
You can build steps from stone, reclaimed wood, landscape ties, or concrete. 
Proper steps should be wide (at least 3 feet), even, and well marked. Ramps 
are handy when the slope is gentle enough that steps aren’t necessary. The 
ideal slope for ramps is 5 to 8 percent, which is 6 to 10 inches of rise for 
every 10 feet of run.

416
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
 
Level changes can be treacherous if you don’t handle them properly.
Here are some tips for creating safe transitions between one level and 
another:
 
 Never have a single step. It’s hard to see just one step and therefore 
easy to trip on it. Group steps together or eliminate them entirely by 
gently ramping your path from one level to the next. Nobody ever 
caught his toe on a ramp.
 
 Use handrails wherever you have four or more steps.
 
 Make stairs visible by changing materials, placing distinctive plants 
nearby, and providing ample lighting.
 
 All steps must be perpendicular to the direction of travel and evenly 
spaced.
 
 Make the surface of the treads textured to prevent slipping and slope the 
treads slightly towards the front of the steps so that they shed water.
 
Special standards apply for wheelchair and walker use. Naturally, paths need 
to be smooth and level or gently sloping, without steps or sudden grade 
changes. Avoid sharp curves and drop-offs alongside the path. Paths need 
to be at least 4 feet wide, and slopes should be no steeper than a 5 percent 
grade. See the Americans with Disabilities Act site at www.ada.gov/std
spdf.htm for the official standards.
Considering Water Features
People gravitate to water. Maybe it’s because our lives depend on it. Maybe 
it’s because we ourselves are mostly water. Or perhaps it’s just because it’s 
so darn beautiful. Nothing can really substitute for water in the garden.
 
Water features use resources for their construction, require regular topping 
off with fresh water (at about the same rate as a lawn), and consume electric-
ity for pumping. Water features may seem like an unsustainable indulgence, 
but another look reveals some real benefits to the environment that compen-
sate for at least some of the impacts. After all, water is the source of life, and 
soon after you put a water feature into service, you can expect to find it used 
by dragonflies, thirsty honeybees, and native insects of all kinds, as well as 
native animals, and many species of birds. In fact, manmade water features 
are often the only source of life for miles around because natural bodies of 
water have often been destroyed to create neighborhoods.

Elements of landscape water features
Water features are simple: You need a vessel of some kind to hold the water 
or a running streambed. Some water features are kept free of plants and fish, 
but the sustainable garden is about nurturing life, so do consider populat-
ing your water feature. Plants and fish provide for each other and keep the 
system in balance so that it requires little input from you.
An active water feature is one that uses a pump to move water for filtration 
purposes or for the beauty of sound and movement of water. A passive water 
feature is still and pumpless, such as a lovely urn with standing water and a 
plant or two. Naturally, passive water features are the more environmentally 
friendly choice, and they create a serene mood without any negative impacts 
and for very little money.
Water features can be formal or informal, manmade looking or naturalistic, 
simple or complex. A bubbling spring can spill into a small running stream 
that runs down into a still pond reflecting the sky and overhanging tree 
branches. A waterfall can create pleasant sounds to screen traffic noise. A 
tiered fountain can be the centerpiece of a courtyard. The possibilities are 
endless.
Working with and around 
natural water features
 
If you’re fortunate enough to have a real stream or pond on your property, 
you have some special responsibilities. Generally speaking, you don’t have 
legal or ethical grounds to mess around with natural waterways. It’s usually 
against federal and local laws to modify, pollute, excavate, harass, fold, spin-
dle, or mutilate natural bodies of water and the life in them. Be content with 
enjoying them as they are.
If a natural waterway has been damaged and you want to restore it, first check 
with your local flood control agency to see what regulations apply. You’ll prob-
ably have to work with numerous agencies, such as the Department of Fish and 
Game, Army Corps of Engineers (bet you didn’t know they were looking after 
your little creek!), flood control, as well as biologists and other professionals. 
Sometimes the government even helps pay for restoration work.
Natural waterways are delicate, complex, and deserving of the very best of 
care. Take advantage of your awareness to do the job right.

418
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Pumping, filtering, and other 
mechanical considerations
The most effective water filter is a 10-inch deep layer of coarse (1 to 2 inches 
in diameter) gravel in the bottom of the pond, with a set of suction lines on 
the very bottom to draw water down through the gravel and return it to the 
pond via a jet of water or waterfall. Bacteria come to live in the gravel — 
good bacteria that eat gunk for breakfast and keep the water nice and clear.
Use a small, low-volume, high-efficiency pump and run it all the time to keep 
the bacteria alive. Naturally, running a pump constantly uses some electric-
ity, but a 50- to 100-watt pump usually moves enough water for a small pond. 
Larger ponds and thundering waterfalls require larger pumps, of course, 
which is a good reason to keep your pond small. The benefits are the same 
no matter what the size. Ideally, you use solar power so that operating the 
pump isn’t a drain on the power grid. Some small pumps have their own solar 
panels; these pumps are fine for moving tiny quantities of water but not for 
running an under-gravel filter or powering a rushing stream.
Caring for your water feature
Bringing a new water feature into balance takes a little time. High nutrient 
levels and alkalis leaching from the pond shell must dissipate before you 
introduce permanent organisms. You’ll have a big algae bloom at first, but 
that should diminish with time.
 
You have many plant species to choose from and be sure to include some 
mosquito fish or goldfish to keep the mosquitoes from breeding. Over time, 
your little ecosystem will become nearly self-reliant.

eginning gardeners are often overwhelmed by the huge variety of trees, 
shrubs, and plants and the mysteries of creating and managing the 
living portion of the landscape. You’re smart to take this responsibility seri-

but doing right by your landscape isn’t surgery. This chapter shows you how 
to choose plants and trees to create a sustainable, attractive, and healthy 
landscape.
 
If you’re a “green” person, you’ve probably heard that food travels 1,500 miles 
from farm to plate, and you’ve read about the 100-mile diet, re-localization, and 
permaculture. But sustainable landscaping has more to it than just the environ-
mental benefits. Growing food gets you and your family outside, provides great 
exercise, teaches valuable lessons about life, nature, and patience to kids and 
adults alike, builds community through sharing the food you grow, and makes 
you a little more secure and a little less dependent on the supermarket and 
corporate food. It’s a heck of a lot of fun, too. Chapters 4 and 5 of Book VI give 
you details about growing fruits and vegetables.

Choosing Perfect Plants
If you pick plants well, and combine them skillfully, they’ll be an asset and 
a delight for decades, even centuries. Choose poorly, and they’ll torment 
you forever, growing too large, becoming invasive or hazardous, or suffering 
from poor growing conditions. Awkward combinations will make the place 
look busy and unkempt no matter how well the plants do or how much love 
you give them. The selection of plants should be given the utmost attention. 
Choosing the perfect plants for your space means learning plants well, visit-
ing them in real-life situations, reading about them, talking to experienced 
gardeners, and getting advice from pros when necessary.
Size does matter: Give them room to grow
 
This section may just be the most important thing you read in this book, so 
listen up. Plants aren’t just pretty things to put around the yard; they’re living 
organisms with their own way of getting along in the world. They have a very 
specific destiny – a set of genetic instructions that determine their height, 
width, growth rate, and many other characteristics. Plants are indifferent to 
our needs. That’s hard for a plant lover to accept, but there it is. Plants don’t 
give a hoot about you and your landscaping. Sorry.
This indifference on the part of plants means that your job as a landscaper is 
to figure out what plants need and to make sure that they get it. For example, 
suppose that you put a 20-foot wide shrub where you actually wanted a 4-foot 
one. The shrub, in its blissful ignorance, will keep trying to grow to 20 feet 
wide, and you’ll have to keep cutting it back. Now, a plant can’t be trained 
as if it were a dog, and your relationship with it will go on unchanged, with 
much labor on your part, until you finally take it out and put in something 
that grows to the proper size and no more.
The implications of not giving plants room to grow are many. You work 
harder, the plants always look cut back instead of natural, some plants may 
never flower under these conditions, they’ll often suffer from the abuse nec-
essary to keep them in bounds, your green waste can will be full of clippings 
all the time, energy use and noise from power tools and hauling clippings 
away will be troublesome, and you’ll find yourself in a constant battle with 
your yard that’s worse the more oversized plants you have. I (Owen Dell) call 
this adversarial horticulture, and believe me, it’s an epidemic. In some gar-
dens, 80 percent of the work consists of cutting things back all the time. It’s 
unnecessary, and it’s a sign of terrible, unsustainable planning.
 
The remedy, of course, is simple. Believe the gardening books when they list 
sizes. Choose plants that grow to the size you want for any given application. 
Then enjoy watching the garden develop into a graceful state of equipoise, 
getting easier to live with rather than harder.

Choosing healthy plants: What to 
look for when shopping for plants
Suppose that you had to choose between three plants at the nursery, all the 
same variety and in the same size containers. One is huge and in luscious 
bloom, the second is mid-sized, and the third hasn’t even grown out to the 
edges of the pot. Which would you pick? Most people would pick the first 
one, thinking it was the better deal because it was already fully grown. That 
would be the very worst choice in most cases, because it’s probably root-
bound. Roots that circle in the pot, as they do when confined for too long, 
will continue to circle in the ground and will never grow out into the soil. The 
plant that looked so great at the nursery will slowly decline, and when you 
pull it out after a couple of years, you’ll find little or no root development.
 
The best choice in most cases would be the mid-size plant: not too big and 
not too small. If you were to carefully remove such a plant from its container, 
you’d find roots that are just beginning to emerge from the root ball and 
touch the sides of the container. There would be no circling roots, but the 
soil would be solidly knitted together and wouldn’t fall apart as it would with 
a younger plant.
Consider also the following plant-buying guidance:
 
 Check out the crown of the plant, which is where the stem enters the soil. 
There should be no circling roots there either. (In that case, they’re called 
girdling roots because they can choke one another out as the plant grows.)
 
 Beware of plants with roots growing out of the drainage holes in the 
bottom of the pot; these plants belong on the compost heap.
 
 A plant should have no broken, crossing, or rubbing branches, and the 
overall shape of the plant should be roughly symmetrical in most cases.
 
 Be sure there are no pests or diseases evident and watch out for yellow-
ing of the tissue between the veins or any other abnormal coloration 
that could indicate nutrient deficiencies or other problems.
 
 Look for an abundance of growth buds, indicating vigor.
Select problem-free varieties
Buying a right-sized, healthy plant is a good start, but choosing varieties that 
are strong and well adapted to your growing conditions is also important. 
Some species, and even entire genera, of plants are going to be weaklings, 
either because they’re so far out of their element in your climate that they’ll 
never get what they need to thrive, or because they’ve been hybridized for 
appearance at the expense of performance. (Like some exotic breeds of dogs, 
these poor plants don’t have a chance of a long, happy life.) Some people 

422
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
love to challenge themselves by trying to grow difficult plants, but that’s not 
for the sustainable landscaper, who knows better than to throw resources at 
plants for years when suitable plants demand so little.
 
If you want a truly sustainable landscape, find out which species of plants 
really work in your neighborhood. Start with those types and move on to 
experimental things in small quantities if you’re so inclined. But make sure 
that the backbone plants in your yard are survivors, not wusses. Walk your 
neighborhood to see what does well and talk to nursery people and others 
who really know plants. Don’t give yourself an uphill battle by choosing 
plants that will never thrive. What’s the point of that?
Native plants versus exotic plants
Which is better, native plants or non-native plants? Like so many aspects of 
landscaping, there isn’t always a simple answer. It depends.
What’s a native plant, anyway? Here are a few key points to understand:
 
 Natives are plants that have evolved in place and, in the case of North 
America and other colonized areas of the world, were present prior to 
European settlement. Native plants weren’t introduced or dispersed by 
humans; they developed on their own.
 
 A native species doesn’t exist in a vacuum; it’s part of a plant commu-
nity of interconnected species that have all grown up together. In turn, 
the plant community is part of a larger ecosystem made up of plants, 
animals, insects, bacteria, fungi, bodies of water, soil, and even weather 
patterns and other nonmaterial things. Ecosystems are highly complex 
and even contain sub-ecosystems, such as streams, hilltops, and valleys.
 
 Native plants are highly adapted to local conditions. In fact, in many 
cases, they’re adapted to very specific parts of the local ecosystem, 
growing in a wet spot or on a sunny slope.
 
 Because of their specificity to a particular environment, they’ll gener-
ally work well in similar environments in the region, but may be touchy 
about being moved to a different environment.
 
 Because they’re so well adapted to local conditions, they’ll thrive under 
those conditions with little or no tending by humans. Properly located, 
they won’t need supplemental watering, fertilizing, or other special 
treatment. A plant’s easygoingness is important in developing a sustain-
able landscape because sustainable is all about minimizing inputs.
 
 The destruction of ecosystems makes it important to restore as much 
as possible. Therefore, using natives in a landscape setting (although it 
may not be an exact replica of nature) will help bring things back into 
balance. Native plants provide food for native animals and insects, so 
inviting those plants into your garden will benefit many species.

423
 Chapter 4: Selecting Plants for a Sustainable Landscape
Book V
Sustainable 
Landscaping
So does this information mean that you should plant only native plants in 
your sustainable landscape? In many cases, an all-native garden is an excel-
lent option. If you’ve come to love the wild areas in your region, by all means 
consider planting natives. Bring in the whole ecosystem or just the parts that 
meet your needs. Every little bit helps. If your design is well handled, the 
natives will make gardening much easier than using ill-adapted non-native 
plants.
 
On the other hand, in an urban or suburban area that’s far from a wild con-
dition, you can feel free to mix in well-adapted plants from regions with a 
climate similar to yours. These exotic plants (another word for non-natives), 
if they’re accustomed to similar conditions, will be very sustainable and will 
mix well with natives. Incorporating non-native plants can add diversity and 
interest to the plant community you’ll be creating. (We all call it a landscape, 
but it’s really an ecosystem, isn’t it?) And when there just isn’t a native plant 
that will do what you want, a well-adapted exotic is particularly appreciated.
Working with native plants
If you’re considering natives for some or all of your project, first learn about 
them. Visit a local botanic garden that features natives, take a class in native 
plants, read up on natives, or join a local native plant society.
 
And above all, spend time in truly wild places in your region to understand 
what a native plant community is, what makes it tick, and what plants are 
associated with one another and to find out whether it’s really something 
you want on your property. Next, check to be sure that the conditions on 
your property are really right for the plants you’re considering. Soils, expo-
sure, water, and other elements often have to be just so, and not all sites are 
suitable for natives. If you’re not sure how to proceed, consult with a profes-
sional who specializes in native landscaping.
When you plant natives, do so in the proper season (often fall, but it will vary 
depending on location) and be careful to avoid fertilizers, soil amendments, 
and other modifications unless you know that the plants you’ve chosen really 
need them. During the establishment period, keep an eye on watering and 
other care because even native plants need a little babying when they’re 
pups. Over the long haul, avoid killing your natives with kindness, keeping in 
mind that they’re quite happy with what nature delivers.
 
If you live near wild land, be careful about introducing natives that aren’t 
present in the immediately local plant community. If such plants are geneti-
cally similar to the truly local natives, they can hybridize with the locals and 
cause genetic pollution.
 
Never dig plants from wild places, even on private property, unless you’re 
sure that it won’t disrupt a native ecosystem or if you’re saving them from 
approaching bulldozers. Buy natives from reputable growers who propagate 
them in their nursery and can guarantee that they’re not dug in the wilds.

424
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Avoiding invasive plants
Some plants are so nasty that they should never show up in your garden. A 
particular species may be just fine in its native habitat where competition, 
browsing animals, or insects keep it under control, but taken elsewhere it 
runs everything else out of town. Many are the instances of this happening 
worldwide, and if you’re already a gardener, then the names of the locally 
accursed plants in your area may come easily to your lips. People have been 
moving plants around the globe for centuries, and while most introductions 
are benign, quite a few have made a mess of things, out-competing native 
plants, increasing fire danger, destabilizing slopes, ruining habitat for indig-
enous animals, and more.
Look to your local native plant society, botanic garden or university, or visit 
The United States National Arboretum at www.usna.usda.gov/Gardens/
invasives.html for information on troublesome plants in your area. Many 
plants are actually outlawed because they’ve created so many problems.
 
Some invasive species are still sold at nurseries. Just because you see a plant 
for sale doesn’t mean it’s been tested for good behavior. Learn which species 
are invasive and never plant them, no matter how cute they look in the pot.
Getting to the Root of a Tree’s 
Purpose and Placement
Trees and shrubs form the basic structure of the landscape and can live for 
decades or even centuries. As the biggest living things in the garden, trees 
and shrubs can demand more than their share of attention and resources if 
they’re ill-suited to your growing conditions, too big for the space they’ve 
been given, or susceptible to problems. Choose trees and shrubs carefully, 
give them a good home, and provide the minimal care they need to thrive. 
They’ll reward you with an abundance of valuable services.
 
A tree is here for — well, not forever, but for a very long time. Choosing and 
placing it wisely is important to you and to future generations.
Make sure that you run through these points before you buy any tree:
 
 What’s it gonna do? Are you looking for shade, privacy, wildlife habitat, 
flower or foliage color, wind protection, food, or what? Of course, one 
tree can conceivably fulfill all those functions and more. Make a list of 
your needs and then pick a tree that meets them.
 
 Where’s it gonna go? Do you have a spot picked out? Why did you pick it? 
Will shade be desirable there at all seasons and times of the day? Is there 

425

actually room for a tree in that location, and is the tree you’re considering 
the right size at maturity? If it will grow over a driveway or into the street, 
will there be clearance for vehicles? Does it work well with the architec-
ture of your house? Does it fit with other trees and the overall landscaping 
in the neighborhood? Is it compatible with other plants in the landscape?
 
 What’s it gonna mess up? Are you sure a tree in that location won’t 
create more problems than it solves? Will there be adequate clearance 
from power lines, underground utilities (never plant a tree directly over 
water mains, sewer lines, or other plumbing), pavement, and founda-
tions? Avoid trees with aggressive or lifting roots anywhere near any 
improvements that may be damaged. Don’t plant a tree that drops a lot 
of leaves, flowers, and fruits over pavement, especially if it creates a 
hazard, such as slippery things on the sidewalk. Think about the effect 
of the tree on your view and on the views your neighbors enjoy; some 
communities outlaw trees that grow into a neighbor’s view.
 
 What’s it gonna look like? Trees are a big visual presence, and the right 
tree can really make a property swing. Ponder the many shapes of trees: 
broad crown, spreading, narrow crown, pyramidal, vase, columnar, fasti-
giate (very tall and narrow), and, of course, the distinctive shape of palm 
trees. Each has a place. Go look at the shapes of some trees and imagine 
how they’d fit in your yard. Think about foliage texture and color, flower 
color and season, branching habit, and even wind movement; all these 
have a strong visual presence.
 
 What’s it gonna need? What’s the water requirement of the tree? 
(Remember that a tree is a huge plant, and a thirsty one will run your 
water bill sky high.) Is it a heavy feeder? How much will it cost to prune? 
Does it have to be treated regularly for pests and diseases (not sustain-
able!)? Will it get the kind of soil and weather conditions it needs?
 
How do you find out enough about a tree to answer all these questions? Read 
up on it in a good gardening book, check it out at a local botanic garden, 
or visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture at www.csrees.usda.gov/
Extension/ to find a local extension office. One of the professionals at the 
extension office can give you great information on choosing the right tree. 
And visit real, mature trees to get to know them better.
Making Trees Happen
Plant a perennial in the wrong spot, and it’s no big whoop to move the plant 
somewhere that’s better suited — or to get rid of it entirely. Trees are not 
quite so easy: Selecting the right tree, planting it correctly, and giving it good 
followup care are essential to any tree’s success. Messing up a tree means 
years of lost time or a permanently disfigured or inappropriate (and very 
large) element in the landscape. Choose, plant, and care for your trees with 
the utmost loving attention.

426
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Bigger is not always better
Unless you have a huge budget and a genuine need for instant shade, plant 
a relatively small tree. You can buy trees in all sizes, from a 1-gallon pot (or 
even a seed) up to a fully mature giant specimen in a huge wooden box that 
has to be planted with a crane. Costs run from a few dollars to thousands.
In terms of the actual size of the tree, what we in the biz call a one (which 
refers to the size of the container, as in 1-gallon) is a foot or two tall — not 
too impressive a start but a good way to go if you want fast growth and low 
cost. A fifteen is 5 to 8 feet tall in most cases and has a caliper (the diameter 
of the trunk) of between 11/2 and 2 inches; it’s a great choice for a reasonably 
sized and still pretty inexpensive tree that will grow well when planted. (Of 
course, the size can vary a lot, depending on the species of tree.)
Larger containerized trees come in tapered wooden boxes running from 24 
inches to 72 inches and even bigger. Boxed trees need to be planted with 
heavy equipment and are stunningly expensive. A tree in a 24-inch container 
isn’t a bad way to go, planting out at around 12 to 15 feet tall and still young 
enough to establish well.
 
The smaller tree won’t give you instant gratification, but in the long run, it’ll 
be the fastest growing. You see, those big specimen trees are way past the 
age for travel. Their roots are old and set in their ways, and in many, if not 
most, cases, a big tree will just sulk in your yard, showing little vigor and 
growth. Some of them die after a number of years. Compare that with a young 
tree in, say, a 15-gallon container, which will take off and grow like a puppy, 
rooting vigorously into the soil and developing like you’d hoped. The bottom 
line: Save your money and buy a smaller, better tree.
Finding a healthy specimen
Trees are sold in several forms. Popularity of different tree “packages” varies 
from region to region. There is no one right way to buy a tree; it just depends 
on what’s available in good condition.
Here’s what you’re likely to find:
 
 Containers: Trees are often planted in plastic pots of varying sizes, 
expressed in gallons (though the containers don’t seem to reflect actual 
capacity). The smallest are 1-gallon size, and the largest are 15-gallon size.

 Balled and burlapped: In many regions, trees are grown in the ground 
and dug up at the time of sale. The root ball is then swathed in burlap 
and fastened with twine or cradled in a wire basket. B&B trees (the land-
scaper’s affectionate term for them) come in various sizes, starting at 
about the size of a 15-gallon container tree. B&B trees are most often of 
the deciduous kind, dug in the dormant season when they’re leafless, and 
planted as soon as possible after purchase.
 
 Bare root: Deciduous fruit and ornamental trees are often sold as bare 
root trees in winter when they’re dormant and leafless. Bare roots are dug 
and sold to you naked as a fish, with their roots hanging out for all to see. 
Needless to say, they need to be planted very quickly. Bare root trees 
tend to be small (no more than 8 feet), a snap to evaluate for condition 
because of their exposed roots, lightweight and therefore easy to plant, 
and quite vigorous after they’re in the ground. They’re inexpensive, too.
 
 Transplanted: Using ordinary hand tools or huge tractor-mounted tree 
spades for larger trees, you can dig up established trees and move them 
from one place to another. The best practice is to pre-dig around part 
of the root system 6 months to a year in advance, to allow new roots to 
develop within the future root ball. Transplanted trees are at a high risk 
for loss, but can be a good way to go if you or a neighbor has a good tree 
in an undesirable location.
 
A few nurseries grow stocky, robust real trees, but most commercially avail-
able trees suck. They’re grown too tall and skinny, placed too close together 
in the nursery, trained to be top-heavy (big canopy on a feeble little trunk), 
and are nothing like what a young tree looks like if it’s grown naturally in the 
ground from seed. It’s an unfortunate reality that we have to put up with gar-
bage trees. Bare root and B&B trees tend to be better than containerized ones.
Here are some things to look for in a healthy tree:
 
 Good roots: The root system should be proportional to the canopy, well 
branched (looking similar to the canopy in form and extent), and free of 
broken, twisted, or girdling roots. The roots should be fresh and juicy 
and show a lot of young root shoots. You can easily see all these details 
with a bare root tree, and impossible otherwise. For containerized trees, 
avoid ones with roots coming out the drainage holes in the bottom of 
the pot. The root ball of a B&B tree should be firm.
 
 With all trees, grab the trunk and push it back and forth; a well-rooted 
tree will be immovable, while a poorly rooted one will wiggle around in 
the soil. Finally, examine the trunk where it enters the soil to be sure 
that it doesn’t have girdling roots, which circle around one another (a 
sure sign the tree has problems).

428
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
 
 Trunk flare: The trunk of a healthy tree widens out as it enters the 
ground. If you see a trunk that plunges straight into the soil like a tele-
phone pole, that tree has been planted too deeply to ever do well.
 
 Happy branches and good crotches: The canopy of the tree should be 
nicely proportioned, with evenly spaced branches that are attached to 
the trunk at nearly right angles rather than pointing upwards. Examine the 
crotches where branches come together; they should be wide and strong. 
V-shaped crotches with included bark (bark that wedges into the crotches) 
indicate weak attachment and the probability of catastrophic failure in 
some future windstorm. Avoid trees with wounds and clumsy pruning cuts 
that left stubs, and with cracks where branches meet the trunk. Finally, if 
the tree is tied to a stake, be sure the ties aren’t girdling the trunk.
Caring for established trees
Trees quickly grow beyond the ability of a home gardener to care for them 
safely and effectively. It’s best to hire a professional to perform an annual 
tree health and safety inspection, which identifies any signs of damage, 
health problems, dangerous limbs, and poor growing conditions. If your trees 
need work, let the pros handle it rather than trying to save a little money by 
doing it yourself. Stay on the ground where you belong.
 
Anyone with a chainsaw can claim to be a tree expert, but real professionals 
are certified by the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA), the Tree Care 
Industry Association (TCIA), or the American Society of Consulting Arborists 
(ASCA). Don’t jeopardize your trees by putting them in the hands of a self-
appointed expert or a gardener. That’s like letting your hair stylist do brain 
surgery. Real arborists have to pass rigorous exams for their certification. 
Ask to see their credentials, get a certificate of insurance so that you’re pro-
tected if there’s an accident, and, of course, get a written estimate. If a tree 
expert advises you to top a tree, send them packing.
Tree care myths
People believe a lot of nonsense about trees, and unfortunately much of it is 
started or perpetuated by incompetent tree trimmers. Get a limb up on the tree 
experts so that you can spot the phonies. Here are the most common myths:
 
 Trees can be topped to control their size. Topping is the practice of 
whacking the upper portion of limbs off to make the tree smaller. It has 
been discredited and will never be proposed by any qualified profes-
sional. Topping trees ruins their structure and creates the danger of 
falling limbs. A tree that has grown too big can be controlled by crown 
reduction, careful and correct pruning that removes branches around 
the tree’s top, or it can be replaced with a right-size tree.

429
 Chapter 4: Selecting Plants for a Sustainable Landscape

 Newly planted trees should be heavily pruned. Poppycock. A young 
tree needs every leaf in order to develop a healthy root system.
 
 Trees should be staked at planting time. If the tree is robust and well 
grown, it won’t need staking unless there are extreme wind conditions.
 
 Pruning cuts should be covered with tree sealer. Wrong. Sealing cuts is 
ineffective and can even seal in problems. Leave ’em naked.
 
 The roots of a tree are equal in size to the crown. Actually, the 
majority of roots of most trees are in the top 18 inches of soil (where all 
the good soil, beneficial microorganisms and oxygen are) and spread 
much farther than the extent of the canopy. Imagine a wine glass sitting 
on a dinner plate and you have an idea of the geometry of a typical tree.
Shrubs in the Sustainable Landscape
Shrubs are long-lived and often one of the easiest groups of plants to care for, 
assuming that you choose varieties that aren’t pest-susceptible or too big for 
the space you give them. (All that cutting back will drive you nuts — and it 
will never end.) Properly used, shrubs demand little in the way of fertilizer, 
water, or other resources. In fact, a good shrub will be as sustainable as any-
thing you could ever imagine, getting all it needs from sun, soil, and rain.
What shrubs can do for you
Shrubs can screen out undesirable views, create private spaces, exclude 
unwanted visitors, block wind, define boundaries, subdivide large spaces, 
create a stunning accent, soften the lines of your house, provide a back-
ground for smaller plants, act as erosion-controlling ground cover, provide 
food and concealment for wildlife, and bear fruit and other food for you.
Here are tips on a few key uses of shrubs:
 
 Screens and hedges: Using shrubs as untrimmed screening plants is a lot 
less work than planting a sheared hedge. If you have the space, choose 
evergreen shrubs of the proper size for boundary plantings and let them 
do their thing unmolested by hedge clippers. If space is limited or if you’re 
looking for a formal effect, a clipped hedge is the way to go. Unfortunately, 
Mother Nature didn’t make very many plants that are 2 feet wide and 8 
feet tall, so the gardener is forced to try to train larger plants into that 
form — a losing battle. If space is really limited, try a fence covered with 
vines; you get the effect of a hedge with much less width and less care.
 
 Specimen shrubs: A striking plant, when used individually at a focal 
point in the landscape, is called a specimen. Choose something with 
an open habit, interesting branch structure, fabulous flowers, or some 

430
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
other attention-getting characteristic. Keep it separated from adjacent 
shrubs, and place compatible perennials at its feet for a lovely scene.
 
 Massing: To cover large areas with tall, easy plants, use masses of 
shrubs, mixing a few different varieties that vary in texture, foliage color, 
flower color and season, and habit. Consider the year-round appearance 
of the planting and make sure that you have something for every season, 
whether it be foliage, flowers, fruit, or attractive bare branches. Avoid 
random one-of-each plantings; repeat varieties through the area.
 
 Foundation plantings: The old idea of planting shrubs all around the 
house, popularized in Victorian days when the bottoms of houses didn’t 
always look so cute, has been out of fashion for quite a while. But shrubs 
located strategically to soften or accent the lines of the house are still 
welcome. Try planting shrubs far enough away from the house that they 
you can enjoyed them from both inside and out.
Buying quality shrubs
Shrubs are long-lived plants and, along with trees, form the backbone of the 
garden. For that reason, choosing well is important. Buy shrubs in smaller 
container sizes unless you need mature plants immediately for a party or a 
wedding. A 1-gallon shrub will often overtake a 5-gallon or 15-gallon shrub of 
the same variety in just one or two growing seasons.
 
Choose varieties that are well adapted to your climate, that will thrive with-
out any inputs of water and fertilizer, and that are the right size for the space 
you have.
 
Make sure that your shrubs aren’t poisonous, especially if little kids are 
around. Some shrubs, such as yew, rhododendron, and oleander, are highly 
toxic.
Enhancing Your Landscape’s 
Sustainability with Smaller Plants
You could create a lovely planting of just trees, shrubs, and mulch (done 
right it would be almost zero maintenance, by the way), but small-scale com-
panion plants add a lot to the personality of the garden. If you’re interested 
in the many charms of plants, you’ll quickly tire of just trees and shrubs and 
yearn for something more interesting. Many kinds of nonwoody plants serve 
practical functions in addition to being ornamental. Perhaps most important 
of all, diversity increases stability and therefore sustainability.

Perennials
Perennial plants are those that live for more than two years. They’re gener-
ally nonwoody, and most of them die back in winter, at least in colder areas. 
You grow perennials mainly for their colorful flowers, but many are valuable 
for foliage interest, as well. Perennials sit at the feet of trees and shrubs, 
covering the ground, and attracting the eye to the lower levels of the garden. 
Perennial plants offer waves of color throughout the growing season and a lot 
of interest in exchange for very little care.
Perennials are perfectly attuned to the low-impact, low-maintenance philoso-
phy of sustainable landscaping. They’re among the easiest of flowering plants, 
requiring only occasional deadheading (removing the dead flowers) and an 
annual hard pruning to remove old foliage at the end of the season. And, of 
course, the well-chosen perennial planting will be adapted to your climate and 
soil, so it will require little supplemental watering or fertilization and will be 
resistant to attacks from pests and diseases. Finally, if given adequate space to 
grow, perennials won’t need to be pruned to control their size.
What do you get in exchange for so little input? Tons o’ color, beneficial 
insects, honeybees, hummingbirds, fragrance, cut flowers, and lovely beds 
full of interesting plants.
Considering color
Perennials are the color kings of the garden. Color is what they’re about, and 
they do it well. To get the most from your perennial plantings, be extra care-
ful with your arrangement of colors. A meaningless mish-mosh of flower and 
foliage color isn’t satisfying; a controlled and purposeful color scheme is a 
delight to behold.
 
Choose an overall approach to color. Decide whether your colors will be 
harmonizing (a mixture of similar colors, such as yellows, oranges, and reds), 
contrasting, also called complementary (opposite colors, such as blue and 
yellow), or monochromatic (subtle variations on one basic color). Consider a 
white scheme for a simple, soothing effect. Contrasting color schemes can be 
intense, which is useful in small doses to counterbalance an overall soft color 
scheme, or use darker values of contrasting colors for a gentler effect. Try 
kicking in a little contrast here and there, such as a dollop of bright red or 
yellow, in an otherwise subtle planting.
Choosing and using perennials
As with any plants, perennials vary widely in their tolerance for sun or shade, 
wet or dry, cold or mild climate, and soil type. They also come in a wide 
range of sizes from creepy crawly ground covers to big guys that grow higher 
than an elephant’s eye. Finally, they have a range of flowering periods, from 

432
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
spring through fall, and some varieties even bloom in fairly cold winters. If 
you live in a mild Mediterranean or other semitropical climate, you can enjoy 
perennial flowers all year long.
 
Avoid Saturday Morning Syndrome — choosing plants impulsively because 
they look cute at the nursery. Even though relocating most perennial plants 
is easy if you don’t get the size, location, or color scheme right, why not nail 
it the first time around? Take the time to make a plan before you run off to 
the nursery:
 
 Decide on a color scheme. (For ideas, see the previous section.)
 
 Research climate-adapted varieties that might work. Make a long master 
wish list and then choose the most compatible plants from that list, 
being sure that they combine well culturally (not whether they read the 
same books but whether they have the same growing requirements) as 
well as aesthetically.
 
 Repeat varieties throughout your planting so that you don’t get the one-of-
each look. For example, compose a 4 x 20-foot bed of six to ten varieties, 
using at least three plants of each variety, spread throughout the bed.
 
 Mix varieties with contrasting foliage color and texture and also take 
into account the overall form (mounding, spiky, and so on) of the plants 
and season of bloom.
 
 Vary the height and width of the plants you choose. Keep it lively, but 
not too busy.
 
Mail-order nurseries are a great source of unusual perennials and other non-
woody plants. Specialty growers ship right to your door. The plants often 
cost more than what you’d find locally, but it’s the only way to obtain some 
of the thousands of hard-to-find species, including natives, that you’ll never 
run across at Vern’s Plant World.
Annuals and biennials
Annuals live one year, set seed for the next generation, and croak. Live fast, 
die young is their philosophy. Some examples of annual plants are petunias, 
cosmos, and pansies. Biennials take a slightly different tack, hanging around 
for one year as somewhat unimpressive green blobs and then doing the 
flower-and-kick-the-bucket thing the second year. Examples are sweet William 
and foxglove. Annuals and biennials are grown for three reasons: color, color, 
and color. Unlike perennials, which pick a (usually short) window during the 
season to show off their stuff, most annuals and biennials continue blooming 
all summer long.

433
 Chapter 4: Selecting Plants for a Sustainable Landscape
Book V
Sustainable 
Landscaping
 
Many plants considered annuals in cold winter climates are actually peren-
nial where winters are mild. That doesn’t make any real difference unless 
you’re uptight about botanical accuracy. After all, a dead plant is a dead 
plant. So whatever they call annuals in your neck of the woods can be treated 
as such, even if they’re not technically annuals per se.
Are annuals sustainable?
When you think about those massive beds of marigolds and petunias that are 
laboriously renewed every spring with robotic devotion by some gardeners, 
you may conclude that annuals are about as far from a sustainable landscap-
ing element as you can get.
But there are all sorts of annual plants, and some of them are most welcome 
in the sustainable landscape.
Many native wildflowers are annuals; they come up on their own, thrive on 
natural rainfall, and reseed themselves to come back year after year. You 
can’t get more sustainable than that. In fact, the whole annual strategy is 
about exploiting current resources to the max and then getting out of the way 
when conditions change.
 
Choose appropriate annuals, ones that fit with your overall planting scheme 
and can take care of themselves. Check the hardiness and earliest planting 
date information on the seed packet if you’re planting from seed (the most 
sustainable way to go). Hardy annuals (ones that are cold tolerant) can over-
winter as seeds in the ground; tender annuals that can’t take freezing winters 
should be planted in spring whether from seed or plants. There are also half-
hardy annuals that put up with yucky cold weather but not frost.
The true story behind meadow magic
No doubt you’ve seen the ads: An elegant woman in a long gown is sashaying 
through a stunning alpine meadow, leisurely shaking wildflower seeds from 
what looks like a parmesan cheese container, and a blindingly colorful carpet 
of wildflowers of every description is popping up behind her as she walks. 
You, too, can have this bliss, the ads imply, and you don’t even have to get 
your hands (or gown) dirty. Sounds great, doesn’t it? If only it were true!
 
A wildflower meadow is one of the most daunting challenges in all the gar-
dening world. Yes, you can sow those seeds, but if you haven’t eliminated 
the weed seeds first, and if you don’t follow up with diligent weeding and 
protection from browsing animals and other pests as the young meadow 
develops, you’ll end up with something fit only for a pass with the rototiller. 
Many is the disappointed gardener who has fallen for this tempting illusion. 
Adding insult to injury, most of the so-called wildflower mixes available for 
sale aren’t remotely true to the mix of species found in any real meadow and 
certainly aren’t tuned to your particular location.

434
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
That doesn’t mean that you can’t succeed with a small wildflower meadow. 
Make sure that you choose a custom mix of truly local wildflowers; see a 
reputable local seed dealer for this and spend at least several months sheet 
mulching (see Chapter 3 of Book VI) before you sow your seed. Plant the 
meadow at the right time of year for your location; this timing will vary 
depending on climate and the type of plants you’ll be introducing. And plan 
on spending some time on your knees handpulling tiny weeds out of tiny 
wildflower seedlings.
If you’re successful, you’ll have a great display of color in spring, and maybe 
some plants will come back the following spring. But it’s an awful lot of work 
for a dicey outcome.
 
Instead of going for the carpet-of-color effect, try sowing smaller quantities of 
wildflowers into established perennial borders and turf-type meadows. This 
approach is more akin to what nature would do, making a plant community 
of a diverse mix of permanent and annual plants. Remove little patches of 
mulch to expose bare ground, loosen it up a bit with a cultivating fork, sow a 
few seeds (just a few, okay?), and top-dress with a quarter-inch thick layer of 
fine compost or similar organic matter. Nature will do the rest.
Bulbs and bulb-like plants
Not all the things we call “bulbs” actually are. To most gardeners, anything 
with strap-shaped leaves and colorful flowers is a bulb, whether it’s a true 
bulb, such as onions or daffodils, rhizomes like iris, tubers like tuberous 
begonias, corms such as gladiolas, or tuberous roots like Dahlias. These 
botanical differences are of little interest to the gardener because they don’t 
really change how you use or care for the plants.
Whatever their strict botanical classification, “bulbs” are among the loveliest 
and easiest garden plants. Their vertical, strap-shaped foliage and stunning 
flowers add a lively bit of punctuation (think exclamation point) to perennial 
beds and meadows.
Bulbs are easy. Here are some tips for using them successfully and enjoying 
them without a lot of effort.
 
 Use bulbs in drifts and masses for a stunning effect or salt them amongst 
other small plants or in low-growing ground covers. Bulbs belong in 
meadows, where they’ll co-exist happily with typical meadow plants and 
add diversity.
 
 Many bulbs are among the first plants to bloom in spring. You can plant 
bulbs in mixed borders for an early show before the perennials get going.
 
 Plant bulbs with other low-growing plants so that there’s something to 
look at when the bulbs are dormant.

435
 Chapter 4: Selecting Plants for a Sustainable Landscape
Book V
Sustainable 
Landscaping
 
 Many bulbs will naturalize, increasing their numbers annually until they 
form sizable, dense populations that need no care from you other than 
an annual cutback of dead foliage and flowers.
 
 Most bulbs can remain in the ground; you don’t need to dig them up and 
put them in storage every year as people sometimes do. If a bulb needs 
that kind of treatment, it’s not adapted to your climate.
 
 Follow package instructions on the depth to plant your bulbs; it can be 
critical to their success. Ask at the nursery if you’re not sure which part of 
the bulb should be up when you plant them; it’s not always easy to tell.
 
 Plant in chicken wire baskets and cover the soil with wire as well, to pro-
tect the bulbs from squirrels, gophers, and birds.
 
 The foliage of most bulbs needs to die down naturally in order to feed 
the bulb for the following year’s performance. Curb your impulse to cut 
back the leaves until they turn yellow.
Ground covers
In some ways, “ground cover” is a dubious term. Many plants cover the 
ground, after all. But ground cover as commonly used means a low, often 
creeping herbaceous (that is, not woody) plant that will sprawl across a wide 
area. The idea of ground covers seems to be twofold:
 
 Playing the role of lawn, visually and sometimes functionally by using 
ground-cover plants that you can walk on. In this task, the ground cover 
makes a sort of living wall-to-wall carpet.
 
 Outcompeting weeds for a low-maintenance sward of greenery and flowers.
Both of these ideas are lovely, and they actually work in some situations. 
Other times the solution becomes the problem because of poor plant selec-
tion. Tread carefully in the world of ground covers and learn what really suc-
ceeds before committing to a plan of action.
The main pitfalls of the ground-cover approach have to do with the nature of 
the chosen plants. Following the “right plant, right place” dictum can result 
in a successful planting. But a careless choice can create a disaster. Here are 
the major ills of common approaches:
 
 Weeds: Nature is competitive, always pitting one force against another, 
flinging the seeds of opportunistic plants into every open space. Weeds 
show up in two ways: via underground or above-ground runners and, 
most commonly, by way of seeds. If the ground-cover planting is too low 
to the ground, or if there are bare spots in it, weeds and germinating 
weed seeds are able to get right to the sunlight and quickly take control. 
At that point the gardener is faced with laborious hand weeding or the 

436
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
use of herbicides (which may kill the desirable plants as well as the 
weeds). At some point, despair sets in, and the whole thing tanks.
 
 The sustainable approach is to plant things that are at least a foot tall 
(preferably taller, ideally around knee-high) so that they shade the soil. 
The other strategy is to use a soaker hose to irrigate rather than keep-
ing the soil surface constantly moist with an overhead sprinkler system, 
which creates a perfect environment for seed germination. Of course 
it helps to have drought tolerant plants and to water little or not at all; 
then seeds will germinate only during the wet season.
 
 Invasiveness: Many ground covers are viney by nature and try to grow 
out of bounds. Some, like ivy, are so aggressive that you’d swear they’re 
going to grow into the next zip code. With invasive plants, you can’t do 
anything except keep cutting them back.
 
 The obvious solution is to replace invasive varieties with plants that 
have a determinate growth habit, meaning that they grow to a certain 
relatively predictable size and stay there. (Your county extension office 
can give you plant suggestions.) Be sure to keep them far enough from 
the edges of the space so that they don’t grow beyond it despite their 
limited size. In other words, keep a plant that grows to 4 feet in diameter 
at least 2 feet from the edge of the bed it’s in.
 
 High water use: Many ground covers achieve their verdant good looks 
by sucking up literally tons of water. There’s rarely any need for high 
water use when so many drought tolerant ground covers are available. 
Pick one.
 
 Bees: Bees are good. They pollinate crops and make honey and are 
smart and cute and utterly essential to life on this planet. Really. 
However, stepping on bees is good for neither man nor bees, and if you 
happen to be allergic to them, it can be very nasty indeed. Avoid bee-
attracting varieties like clover or Lippia for walk-on ground covers.
Ornamental grasses
Time was when grasses in the yard were either lawn or weeds. Then some 
folks in Europe began growing grasses for their beauty, not perpetually 
crew-cut and indistinguishable from one another as in a lawn but placed as 
individual plants in flower beds and allowed to grow into their full glory. This 
idea came as a shock to a lot of people, and it took a while for gardeners to 
get used to seeing a fully grown grass plant without having the urge to walk 
over and yank it out by the roots. But their charms prevailed and eventually 
ornamental grasses came to be loved by many gardeners.
Ornamental grasses range in size from 6-inch tall Fescues to clumps of 
Miscanthus 8 feet or more in height. Even bamboo is technically a grass. 
Grasses can be a sustainable element in the landscape if they’re climate-
adapted, non-invasive, and right-sized. In fact, many grass species tolerate or 

437
 Chapter 4: Selecting Plants for a Sustainable Landscape
Book V
Sustainable 
Landscaping
prefer poor soil, require little or no fertilizer, and — unlike lawn grasses — 
they don’t need much in the way of water. Grasses are generally pest-free, too.
Grasses sequester a lot of carbon, which helps to mitigate global warming. 
They’re fast-growing, live a long time in most cases, and even resist browsing 
by deer and other animals. (Grasses grow from the base rather than the tops, 
and so they recover well from being gnawed on. That’s why they’re tolerant 
of grazing and lawn mowing.)
On the other hand, grasses have some problems. The most vexing is what 
happens when weeds, especially undesirable grasses, get into them. If you’ve 
ever tried to pull two grassy plants apart, you know it’s like trying to break 
up a dog fight. Multiply this task by a whole yard full of grasses, and you’ve 
got yourself a hobby. The answer is to choose drought-tolerant varieties and 
be very diligent about not letting weeds go to seed or creep into the grass.
 
Certain ornamental grasses should be avoided at all costs because of their 
invasive tendencies. They become garden weeds, and some can even harm 
wild ecosystems. After they’re introduced, they can be nearly impossible to 
get rid of. What’s harmless in one area can be pernicious in another, so you 
need to check for locally troublesome species. Your county extension office 
keeps a list of plants you should avoid in your area, and they’d be thrilled to 
know you’re taking it seriously. Check in with them.
Some grasses can be highly flammable. In fact, most wildfires start in dry 
grasses and move on to larger plants. Irrigate enough to keep them green and 
periodically use your hands to remove the dead foliage or cut the plants back 
hard in early spring.
Integrating grasses into the landscape
Ornamental grasses make great specimen plants, ground covers, and mass 
plantings. They even grow in containers. Mixing grasses with perennials and 
shrubs gives a natural feel to your landscaping. (Most wild plant communi-
ties have a grassy element.)
Here are some basic considerations for working grasses into your plantings:
 
 Cool and uncool grasses: Grasses fall into two categories: cool season 
(which are most active when temperatures are low) and warm season 
(which do better in that other time of year). Mix cool and warm season 
grasses for year-round interest. Winter brings a fourth season of beauty 
to many grasses if you wait until spring to cut them back.
 
 Runners and clumpers: Running grasses spread, often vigorously, by 
underground shoots; they can be handy for erosion control, but many 
of them can get out of hand quickly and become a nuisance. Clumping 
grasses hang out in one place and don’t get in anybody’s face; they’re 
easier to live with.

438
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
 
 Light: With a few exceptions, grasses like full sun, so plan on using them 
in open areas where they get at least half a day of the stuff. In shadier 
areas, try grass-like rushes and sedges.
 
 Special effects: Exploit the unique charms of grasses — their fountain-
like growth habit, the graceful way they move and rustle in the wind, the 
way morning and afternoon light settles in the foliage. Plant grasses to 
the west of a bench or patio for a wonderful back-lit sunset show. Use 
the showy blooms in flower arrangements. Plant a tall specimen grass 
where you want an eye-catching vertical element.
 
 Soil stabilization: Take advantage of the extensive root system of 
grasses to knit unstable soil together.
Maintenance: Avoiding a pain in the grass
Choose your grasses well and give them an appropriate home, and you 
shouldn’t have much trouble with them. Here’s a rundown of tasks:
 
 Watering: Know the water needs of your grasses. Many are quite 
happy with rainfall alone, but some need supplemental irrigation. Even 
drought-tolerant grasses can take wet soils if need be, but they often 
grow too lush and floppy and lose much of their charm in wet soil. 
Overwatered grasses may end up being short-lived, too. Wet the soil to 
a depth of 12 to 18 inches at each irrigation, and water as seldom as you 
can get away with.
 
 Fertilizing: Most grasses don’t need to be fertilized, and, in fact, overly 
fertile conditions encourage weak growth. Especially avoid excess nitro-
gen, which produces lush foliage to the point where it can be a problem.
 
 Pests and diseases: Overwatering and overcrowding can encourage 
diseases, but absent those conditions, you should have no problems. 
Gophers eat grasses from below ground, and other critters will browse 
on your grasses from time to time; remember that grasses are here for 
just that purpose and can’t be hurt by a little grazing, so chill out and let 
the other species have their fun, too.
 
 Weed control: Pull young weeds, roots and all, carefully out of the grass 
clump. Wetting down the ground first helps a lot. Don’t let the weeds get 
too big or you end up lifting and dividing the grass just to get the weeds 
out, or removing it altogether.
 
 Cutting back: Some grasses can go along for years with no pruning, but 
most look better (and be safer in a fire) if you cut them back hard annu-
ally in early spring. You may also want to try combing dead foliage out 
with the hands (wear gloves). Meadows can be mowed — or grazed if 
you happen to have a few head of cattle around.

Walking a vine line
Vines have a special place in the landscape. The form they take can be useful, 
especially when you need plants for small or narrow spaces. But they can 
also be problematic, growing into trees and invading spaces not meant for 
them. Using vines well can result in a richer garden environment; misusing 
them can cause grief.
 
Vines developed as a way to exploit limited sunlight in forested, mostly tropi-
cal, environments where trees beat small plants to the light. Vines tolerate 
shade when young and scramble quickly to the tops of the trees to get to the 
sun, spreading out as soon as they reach the canopy. All vines compete with 
their host trees, and some, like the strangler fig of tropical rainforests, ulti-
mately kill the tree and become one themselves by developing huge trunks 
and branches. Some introduced vines, such as the famous kudzu in the 
southern United States, have become a severe problem with no solution in 
sight. If all this domination by vine sounds kind of violent, or at least rude, it 
is. “Natural” isn’t always gentle.
Properly chosen and planted in a suitable location, the right vine can be just 
the ticket for special garden needs. Vines need more trimming than other 
plants, but sometimes that’s a small price to pay to get a lot of function. Here 
are some tips for using vines without risk:
 
 Conceal and cover: Make use of vines to cover fences where you don’t 
have space for a hedge. Plant them on walls to help insulate the house 
and conceal bad architecture. Send them over the hill to control erosion.
 
 Climbing styles: Some vines twine around their support, others hold on 
using small tendrils that wrap around wire or the stems of other plants, 
and still others stick to the side of your house with little holdfasts that 
look like teeny lizard’s feet. Some just sprawl. Choose a vine type that 
will grow on the support you plan to offer it. Holdfasts, by the way, are 
well named; they can be nearly impossible to get off if you want to paint.
 
 Evergreen or deciduous: Some vines hold their leaves all year; others 
lose them in winter. Choose one of the former kinds if you need consis-
tent coverage for screening purposes.
 
 Speaking of support: Make it strong, since mature vines can be surpris-
ingly heavy. A building will do, as long as you’re willing to keep the vine 
trimmed away from eaves and openings where it may cause damage. 
Install horizontal stainless steel wires on fences and hand-train the vines 
onto them. Make trellises out of natural materials, such as the whip-like 
branches pruned from deciduous fruit trees.

Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
 
 There’s always the temptation to grow big vines on overhead pergolas. 
What usually happens is that all the leaves and flowers are on top where 
all the light is, and you end up sitting underneath looking at dead leaves 
and wondering when the rats are going to start jumping on your head. 
And when the time comes to paint it, you wish you’d never heard the 
word “vine.” If your pergola is ugly, tear it down. Don’t make things 
worse by trying to hide it with a vine. Another thing: Go ahead and let a 
vine climb up to the second story if you like spending your weekends 
teetering high on a ladder with electric hedge clippers in your face.
 
 Avoid growing vines on power poles. It draws attention to the pole and 
makes the utility companies unhappy because they have to constantly 
cut them back. Keep them out of trees, too.
 
 Vines and wildlife: Many vines attract and nurture butterflies, birds, 
and bees. This is good (unless you’re allergic to or afraid of bees). They 
also provide rodents food, shelter, and a handy ladder into your house, 
which is not so good unless you happen to love rodents.
 
 Vine combinations: Try planting two vines that bloom at different sea-
sons for a longer display of color.
Everyone knows the grape vine, but many other vines produce edible fruits, 
including passion fruit, kiwi and cold-hardy arctic kiwi, berries, hops, and 
chayote. Don’t forget annual vines, such as peas, beans, squash, and melons. 
Food-bearing vines can grow in places where fruit trees and vegetable beds 
would never fit, and they often put the fruit at a nice pickable level to elimi-
nate stooping and climbing.
Succulents and cacti
You either love or hate succulents and cacti — the fleshy, water-storing plants 
that thrive in drought conditions. If you hate them, you don’t have to read 
this section; you’ll still be welcome in the sustainable landscaping club. We’ll 
see you at another chapter of the book.
Okay, now that they’re gone — hey, how ’bout those succulent plants, huh? 
What an amazing array of shapes and forms! And they can’t be touched when 
it comes to sustainability.
Getting to know succulents and cacti
Generally, succulents and cacti like sun, but there are some shade-tolerant 
ones as well. They prefer warmer climates (USDA zones 8 to 10), but some 
can grow as far north as parts of Canada. Because they hold water in their 
tissue, they’re very drought-tolerant, though many can accept limited regular 

441
 Chapter 4: Selecting Plants for a Sustainable Landscape

Landscaping
watering under otherwise good growing conditions. They use one third to 
one half less water than turf. Pests and diseases are fairly rare. And there are 
few, if any, invasive varieties. Overall, succulents and cacti are among the 
easiest, most bulletproof plants for the landscape.
Choose and use succulents effortlessly with a few guidelines:
 
 Placement: Especially if you get frost, locate succulents on the sunny 
south side of a house or building where reflected heat and the warmth 
retained in the walls helps them endure cold nights. Choose a location 
with good air circulation as well. Place thorny plants away from paths 
and other traffic patterns.
 
 Arrangement: Use succulents and cacti in contrast to leafier drought-
tolerant plants, keeping in mind that they rarely grow only with others 
of their kind in nature. It’s okay to have an all succulent/cactus garden, 
but it’s okay to mix plants, too. Just be sure to group them with plants 
that have similar water needs. Use the bold forms as specimen or accent 
plants. Silhouette them against walls. Play with the many foliage colors.
 
 Drainage: Without good drainage, succulents drown. They grew up in 
places with gravelly soil and fast internal soil drainage. Give it to them. 
Give them drought. Give them sun. Leave them the heck alone. They’ll 
love you for it. If you’re one of those people who waters everything 
every day, stay away from succulents; they hate that kind of attention.
 
 Feeding and watering: Go easy on the fertilizer and apply it only during 
the active growing season and in small doses. Use none unless you 
see actual nutrient deficiencies. Keep in mind the required rest period 
during fall and winter and withhold fertilizer and water then.
Handling thorny plants
Work with thorny plants carefully! Wearing thick leather gloves! Try wrap-
ping them in the Sunday newspaper or a piece of old carpeting. Wear a heavy, 
long-sleeved shirt or jacket even if it’s hot out. Oh, and no flip-flops; heavy 
boots are de rigueur. Eye protection isn’t a bad idea, either.
Keep in mind that spines can cause infections or painful injuries that take a 
surprisingly long time to heal. Clean all wounds promptly and thoroughly. 
(How’s your tetanus booster doing?) Succulents are much heavier than other 
plants because of the water in their tissue, so they can be top-heavy. Many 
are also brittle and need to be handled with care. This is extreme gardening.

Finding Greener Ways to Work 
Around (or with) Lawns
In This Chapter
 Accepting the many downsides of lawns
 Creating landscapes without lawns (hello, meadows!)
 Keeping up your lawn with less damage to the earth
T
oday, lawns are a major industry — $30 billion a year is spent just on 
professional lawn care. That figure doesn’t include the efforts of home-
owners themselves and the vast array of technologies that are thrown at 
modern lawns. Devotion to lawn technologies wouldn’t be so bad if it weren’t 
for the negative impacts of all this lawn care: global warming, noise, cancer 
and other diseases, water and air pollution, fossil fuel use, habitat destruc-
tion, soil degradation, excess water consumption, mountains of clippings, 
and golf.
Lawns have become a symbol of consumerism gone mad, and they pretty 
much deserve their bad reputation. Still, how many people can resist the lure 
of the lawn? In this chapter, you find good reasons to try to resist, anyway, 
along with lawn substitutes and — if you can’t give the sucker up — ways to 
maintain your lawn with less environmental impact.
What’s So Bad about Lawns, Anyway?
If you have a lawn, you’re not exactly alone. In the United States, lawns take 
up 50,000 square miles, which is nearly twice the size of the 100 largest U.S. 
cities put together. If only turf were a truly beneficial element of gardening, 
Americans could be proud of the accomplishment. Unfortunately it hasn’t 
worked out that way. Here’s a look at some of the downsides of lawns:

444
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
 
 Effects on air quality: Lawn-care equipment (mowers, edgers, and so 
on) account for 2 percent of American fossil fuel use, and because they 
operate without smog devices, they’re responsible for at least 5 percent 
of U.S. air pollution. In fact, a lawnmower emits the same amount of 
pollution as eight new cars driving 55 miles an hour. Each mower emits 
80 pounds of CO2 per year, generously contributing to global warming. 
Pesticides also evaporate into the air, causing still more pollution.
 
 Water use: Lawns suck water like crazy. Between 30 percent and 60 per-
cent of household water in the United States is used to keep lawns alive. 
If every American lawn were watered optimally, it would use 200 gallons 
per person per day. (To put that number in perspective, you probably 
use around 40 to 80 gallons per day for all personal uses, such as cook-
ing, laundry, bathing, drinking, and so on.) Lawn water use amounts to 
270 billion gallons per week, which is three times what is put on irri-
gated corn and enough to grow 81 million acres of organic food. So is it 
better to have 31 million acres of lawn or 81 million acres of pure fresh 
food? Well, go graze on your lawn and then you tell me which is better. 
Oh, and by the way, that’s water that people could be drinking.
 
 Fossil fuel consumption: The EPA says 800 million gallons of gas are 
burned in lawn mowers each year, and mower operators spill 17 million 
gallons just fueling those suckers — more than was spilled in the Exxon 
Valdez disaster.
 
 Pesticides: Sixty-seven million pounds of synthetic pesticides go on 
American lawns each year, at a cost of $700 million. That’s ten times 
more per acre than U.S. farmers put on their crops. This pesticide use 
leads to water and air pollution, global warming, loss of wildlife and ben-
eficial insects, and numerous diseases (cancer, birth defects, and heart 
disease, to mention a few).
 
 Only 35 percent of those pesticides actually reach the plants; the rest 
drifts off to do harm. One in seven people are negatively affected by pes-
ticides. In fact, according to the National Academy of Sciences, a 5-year 
old has already absorbed half his lifetime dose of pesticides. And yet 
some people still believe that a poisoned yard is a better yard. (Check 
out www.beyondpesticides.org for more info.)
 
 Fertilizers: Chemically based fertilizers are made from nonrenewable 
fossil fuels and other environmentally hazardous ingredients. They leach 
into the water supply, and they kill lakes by nourishing algae blooms 
that suck all the oxygen out of the water. A substantial percentage of the 
fertilizer applied to lawns ends up leaving the area, but even the por-
tion that stays in the root zone is troublesome, killing the beneficial soil 
microorganisms on which the grass depends for its health.
 
 Unlike natural fertilizers made from organic sources, chemical fertilizers 
are salts that have a negative effect on soil well-being. Most fertilizers 
applied by spray are fast-acting and disperse quickly; this boom-and-
bust cycle is just as hard on a lawn as living on candy bars and whiskey 
would be for you.

445
 Chapter 5: Finding Greener Ways to Work Around (or with) Lawns
Book V
Sustainable 
Landscaping
 
 Lack of biodiversity: Chemically treated lawns are dead zones for wildlife. 
Compared to a mixed planting of trees, shrubs, perennials, and annuals, a 
lawn contains almost no biodiversity and offers little or no habitat value. 
Add in the fact that 11 of the 30 common lawn chemicals are toxic to bees, 
24 are toxic to fish, and 16 to birds, and you’ve got a bright green desert 
(except that’s an insult to the highly diverse and lively deserts). Even the 
family dog isn’t safe; a study of Scottish Terriers by Purdue University 
determined that four to seven times the incidence of lymphoma and blad-
der cancer occurs in those dogs that lived around pesticide-treated lawns.
 
 Green waste production: A typical American one-third acre lawn generates 
almost two tons of clippings a year. That’s just shy of 190 million tons, just 
in the United States. Depending on where you live, a good portion of that 
green waste may be taken away in a fossil fuel-consuming truck and put in a 
landfill where it will never again be part of a living system.
 
 Injuries: There are between 60,000 and 70,000 severe lawnmower acci-
dents per year in the United States alone. A rotary mower can fire rocks 
at 200 miles per hour. Not to mention what happens when you try clean-
ing out the chute while the mower is still running.
 
 Noise pollution: Stop already with the racket! Imagine your neighbor-
hood on a Saturday morning without all the lawnmowers going at once. 
How peaceful that would be. It’s not an impossible dream.
 
 Cost: Suppose that you pay a gardener 50 bucks a visit to mow your lawn. 
Suppose that you live in a mild climate where mowing is a year-round 
job. If you do that for 20 years, you’ll spend $50,000 — not accounting for 
inflation (or if you’re just very cheap and never give the poor gardener a 
raise). And that’s just for the mowing. Factor in also the water, fertilizer, 
sprinkler repairs, replacement, weed control, and all the rest.
Finding some good news about lawns
A lawn does have some advantages. A recent independent study found 
that if lawn clippings are left on the lawn after mowing (see the upcoming 
“Grassscycling” section), lawns can sequester significant quantities of carbon, 
which helps mitigate global warming. That’s a big plus. Here are a few more:
 
 Grassed areas absorb water readily and so can soak up some of storm 
water in a rain, reducing urban flooding and allowing groundwater 
recharge.
 
 They produce oxygen, cool the air, and trap dust and crud.
 
 They’re soft and safe to play on.
 
 They reduce glare.
 
 And, sure, they’re pretty. (But mostly because we’re conditioned to think 
so. A meadow is darned pretty, too, and a more sustainable option.)

446
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
The question is, are these benefits justified in light of the problems that lawns 
create? There are differing schools of thought on this question, and there is no 
solid data that takes into account the mitigating effects of organic lawn care.
Does a truly sustainable lawn exist?
 
If the test of sustainability is that a lawn could maintain itself with no water-
ing, feeding, mowing, weeding, or pest control — no inputs of any kind — 
then, no, lawns aren’t sustainable. If the test is whether the lawn gives back 
more than it takes, then the answer also is probably no.
Not having a lawn is preferable for a green home, and the upcoming section 
“Exploring Lawn Alternatives” shows you ways to make your land greener, in 
the figurative sense.
But the reality is that lawns are here and probably not going away any time 
soon — if at all. (For crying out loud, some homeowners associations require 
them.) If you do have a lawn, maintaining it with a minimum of destructive 
effects at least takes some of the ecological sting out of it. You get tips for 
doing just that in the next section.
Minimizing the Negative 
Impact of the Lawn
 
If you’re not ready to go lawn-free, you do have options. You can change 
your lawn, and the way you manage it, with significant positive results for the 
planet. Most of the changes are simple and inexpensive. Some of them are 
even free and result in immediate savings in water and labor. None of these 
improvements is rocket science.
Reducing lawn size
How much lawn do you really need? Assuming that you have an actual need 
for lawn, such as playing on it, a third of an acre usually is plenty unless you 
host regulation tackle football games on weekends.
 
Figure out how much lawn you really need (for a badminton court, if that’s 
what you’re into, or maybe just a lane for cut-throat bocce ball games) and 
then whittle down your lawn as much as possible. Shoot for reducing your 
lawn area by half.

447
 Chapter 5: Finding Greener Ways to Work Around (or with) Lawns
Book V
Sustainable 
Landscaping
You don’t necessarily have to get rid of your lawn. But if you could please, 
please, please just make it a teeny bit smaller, Nature would be awfully grate-
ful! And so would your bank account.
Changing to a low-maintenance variety
You find many kinds of lawn grasses, some less troublesome than others. 
Choose a low-care variety suited to your region, one that’s resistant to pests 
and diseases, and maybe even uses less water. Hybrid tall fescues are the 
current candidate in many areas, but the best choice for your lawn depends 
on where you live. Talk to one of the professionals at your local cooperative 
extension service; they’re amply familiar with local conditions.
Many of a lawn’s problems stem from its being a monoculture — that is, com-
posed of only one type of plant. Adding a mix of native plants is a much more 
sustainable option that cuts back tremendously on the effort and mainte-
nance products your lawn requires. And it creates a more attractive environ-
ment for birds and frogs and other visitors.
Clover, for example, brings a wealth of benefits to a lawn but is regarded as a 
weed by many homeowners. Mix in clover with your grass, and you not only 
draw a wider range of beneficial insects (including bees, so watch your step) 
but practically ensure that you’ll have some green in your lawn during even 
the driest seasons when the grass dries out.
Improving water management
Most people are overwatering their landscaping, and lawns are the biggest 
culprit. Managing water better involves a bit of learning and some careful 
attention to changing conditions rather than watering on a fixed schedule 
that ignores actual water need. But it doesn’t cost a penny, and you’ll start 
seeing lower water bills right away.
 
Lawns do best when they’re watered deeply but infrequently; err on the dry 
side. If your grass takes on a blue or gray tint and starts showing footprints, 
the time to water is now. Water too much, and you encourage fungal disease.
 
So much of the water applied to lawns is wasted that you have a huge oppor-
tunity to save water (and money) just by tuning up your irrigation system. 
Simple adjustments, such as re-aiming heads, cleaning plugged nozzles, and 
moving heads to improve coverage and eliminate overspray onto pavement, 
can make a big difference. As you delve further into sustainability, you’ll 
most likely want to give up your irrigation system, but in the meantime, at 
least make sure that it’s functioning at its most efficient.

448
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
Grasscycling
Bagging grass clippings is unnecessary and wasteful. It removes valuable 
nutrients and organic matter from the system for no reason.
Grasscycling, also known as mulch mowing, is the practice of leaving the 
clippings on the lawn so that they return to the soil through the process of 
decomposition. Special mulching mowers cut the grass blades more finely 
than regular mowers, helping them to break down faster, but any mower will 
work. Grasscycling can reduce the need for nitrogen (the key element in lawn 
fertilizer) by 30 to 50 percent. You’re basically giving your lawn a free fertil-
izer treatment just by leaving the clippings on the lawn.
By the way, it’s a myth that leaving the clippings on the lawn causes thatch 
(the thick, spongy layer of dead material that sucks up water before it gets to 
your grass’s roots), so cross that one off your worry list. Thatch’s real culprit 
is overfertilizing and overwatering.
Using a reel mower
Reel lawnmowers use no fuel, unless you count what you had for breakfast. 
They’re quiet. They always start. They let you mow the lawn and get your exer-
cise at the same time, which is perfect for busy people. They work great for the 
small urban lawn as long as you don’t let it grow too long before mowing.
 
If you must use a power mower, choose an efficient electric model. They are 
just right for the average suburban lawn, and they reduce fossil fuel con-
sumption, are quieter than gas mowers, and cost one-tenth as much to oper-
ate as a gas mower. Or try sheep; they’re a classic solution.
Exploring Lawn Alternatives
Suppose that you’re ready to 86 your lawn and do something more sensible. 
Bravo! It’s a smart move, especially considering that so many better alterna-
tives are out there. First, consider how much turf-like area you actually need. 
Use a lawn substitute in that area and integrate the remainder into your over-
all landscape design, creating perennial beds, an orchard, vegetable gardens, 
native plants, or some other appropriate use. Your costs will go down, ben-
efits will go up, and the environment will love you.
The following sections detail some great ideas for antilawns.

The meadow idea
Everywhere you look, people are taking out their lawns and replacing them 
with meadows. The transformation has been described as a revolution, and 
it’s surely one of the bright spots in modern horticulture.
Instead of fertilizing and watering to make grass grow and then ruthlessly 
decapitating it every week with snarling fossil-fuel-powered lawnmowers, the 
meadow owner enjoys a more tousled, natural-looking turf made up of native 
or climate-compatible non-native grasses, sedges or herbaceous plants such 
as yarrow.
Better yet, meadows need mowing only rarely — or never. For example, a 
sedge meadow can be mowed a couple of times a year to freshen it up or left 
to its own devices. (And if you do want a clipped look, many meadow plants 
can take regular mowing.)
Meadows in general require much less water than lawns and need very little 
fertilizer. Properly chosen plants, put in favorable locations, will have little 
if any trouble with pests and diseases, so their overall impact is very low. 
(Chapter 4 tells you more about choosing plants.) Yet after they’re established, 
they offer a tough, playable, beautiful surface. Finally, meadows can be more 
diverse than lawn, providing habitat for beneficial and native insects.
Meadow plants
Meadow plants fall into three basic categories:
 
 Grasses have an attractive unmowed appearance and overall low main-
tenance. You can choose grasses that are native or otherwise, as long as 
they’re easy to live with.
 
 Sedges look like grasses but are in a different family of plants. They’re 
handsome and fresh-looking, tolerant of a wide range of conditions and 
easy to live with. A few species can be moderately invasive and should 
be surrounded by an underground plastic root barrier to keep them 
where you want them.
 
 Perennials, such as yarrow, clover, violets, and roman chamomile are 
flowering plants that develop a tight covering of foliage; many of them 
are very showy. Don’t forget that you can (and really should) use a mix-
ture of several different kinds of plants in your meadow to make it more 
adaptable to varying conditions, create a richer habitat, and provide a 
more interesting look.
How to make a meadow
Creating a meadow isn’t that much different from putting in a lawn. Soil prepara-
tion is the same, and depending on the species you choose, you can plant from 
seed or small pots. In some regions, certain meadow mixes are available as sod.

450
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
If your climate is dry during the growing season, you may need to water a few 
times until the plants are established.
Establishment of some meadow species can involve more work than a lawn 
because the plants are slower to mature, meaning you’ll have to pull weeds 
for a while longer than usual. But that’s a small price to pay for a lifetime of 
easy care and low impact.
Meadow management
Living with a meadow is pretty easy, given that they don’t care whether you 
pay much attention to them or not. Mowing can be challenging if the plants 
are very overgrown; using a weed whacker or hand shears can work better 
than a mower in some cases.
As for watering, try letting it go until you see signs of stress (slowing of 
growth, change in color, droopiness) and then water. Chances are, the inter-
val will be longer than you think. Fertilize once or maybe twice a year but 
only if growth is slower than you like — meadow plants are tough and, after 
they’re established, under normal conditions you don’t need to fertilize. It’s 
supposed to be easy and is.
Walk-on ground covers
You can use various kinds of ground covers in place of a lawn. The main dif-
ference between a ground cover and a meadow is the degree of traffic the 
plants can tolerate: Meadows are okay with normal lawn use, and ground 
covers are better off with only occasional foot traffic because they’re more 
easily injured or recover more slowly. Ground covers provide the look of a 
lawn where you want a broad swath of something low to set off other, taller 
plantings and can tolerate limited access and use.
As a general rule, ground covers offer fewer benefits and take more care than 
meadows, but how well they function in your yard depends on which ground 
cover you choose. As with other plants, look into varieties that are suited to 
your region and then choose ones from that list that will thrive in your par-
ticular conditions. Your local cooperative extension service can direct you to 
plants that meet your needs and thrive in your area. Chapter 4 tells you more 
about choosing ground covers.
Making use of mulch
Organic mulch is an ultra-low care surface that’s well suited to paths and 
open areas where you don’t need a living element. Sometimes mulching is 
a temporary solution while you’re killing weeds or waiting to decide how to 
develop a space. Other times, it’s a great permanent element in the 

451

landscape, offering weed control, water conservation, soil improvement, ero-
sion protection, and a nice natural appearance. Cheap, too.
What about artificial turf? (Yecch!)
Maybe you’re starting to see your resource-greedy lawn as more of a thorn in 
your side than a benefit, but you’re not ready to commit to a meadow. Could 
artificial turf be the answer to your problems? A resounding no answers that 
question.
Sure, phony plastic lawns require no fertilizer, water, or mowing, but they 
originate from fossil fuels and may include toxic ingredients. Because they 
soak up no water, they contribute to runoff problems.
 
Nonliving turf worsens the urban heat-island effect — any densely populated 
area is hotter than a wide-open rural area, partly because of all that concrete.
Check out Chapter 2 to find out further reasons to avoid artificial turf, in case 
you’re not deterred by the stink-eye you get from your neighbors after you 
install the stuff.
Reducing Your Lawn’s 
Environmental Impact
The shift to organic lawn care has been huge. People are fed up with spread-
ing poisons all over their yard. According to Popular Mechanics magazine, 
the number of U.S. households purchasing natural fertilizers increased from 
2.5 million to 11.7 million between 1998 and 2003. During the same period, 
households practicing natural pest control went up from 1.8 to 10.9 million. 
That’s a revolution!
People wouldn’t be taking the natural approach if it didn’t get results. 
Organic lawn care isn’t just for hard-core enviros; it’s a well-developed 
system with a lot of great science behind it. Organic lawn care saves you time 
and money and delivers a great-looking, robust lawn. The upcoming sections 
show you how to make that happen in your yard.
Smart mowing means good growing
Mow high. No, not you — the mower. Set your mower to keep the grass at least 
3 inches high for most cool season grasses like fescues, bluegrass, and rye (1 
inch or less for warm-season grasses like Bermuda grass; they’re a 

452
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
special case). Not cutting your grass too short is the Most Important Lawn 
Care Practice. Maintaining grass at the proper height preserves plenty of leaf 
surface so that photosynthesis is maximized and plenty of sugars go into the 
roots to strengthen them (plants are sugar junkies, too); it helps shade out 
weeds, encourages grass to spread by sending underground runners, discour-
ages pests, and keeps diseases at bay. Mowing high is the right thing to do.
 
Keep in mind the following tips for mowing:
 
 Never cut more than one-third of the total height at any one time; losing 
too much off the top is shocking to the grass. If your grass is 4 inches 
high, for example, don’t cut more than 1.33 inches.
 
 Keep your mower blades sharp to avoid damage to the grass.
 
 Mow in late afternoon when the lawn is dry so that the clippings don’t 
clump.
 
 Cut in a different direction each time you mow to prevent wear and to 
keep grass blades upright.
 
 Mow when the grass needs it, not just because it’s Saturday morning.
 
 Use a mulch mower or mulching blade to return the clippings to the 
lawn. You can also mow right over fallen leaves and they too can return 
to the soil.
Lawn watering secrets
Nearly everybody waters too much. A few people water too little. Very few 
people water just the right amount. Remember the following key points to 
water your lawn properly:
 
 Most lawns need about an inch of water per week, including rainfall. 
That inch will penetrate 6 to 12 inches depending on your soil type 
(deeper in sandy soils than in clay soils).
 
 Brown grass isn’t necessarily dead grass. Cool season lawn grasses go dor-
mant and turn brown during hot, dry summer weather. You don’t need to 
water these lawns to keep them alive, and when they do get adequate water 
again (from rain, preferably), they green back up and start growing again.
 
 Watering should replace what’s been used and no more.
 
 Use a soil probe to examine soil moisture. If the root zone is damp, 
there’s no need to irrigate. If you step on the grass and it doesn’t spring 
back when you remove your foot, you might want to water.
 
 Water in early morning. Never water at night or in the heat of day.
 
 Among cool season grasses, fescues are the most drought tolerant; blue-
grass and rye are the least. Warm season grasses tolerate more drought 
than cool season ones.

Book V

Landscaping
Fertilizing the sustainable way
The major nutrient required by lawn grasses is nitrogen, followed by phos-
phorous, potassium, and some trace elements like iron in certain situations. 
Many soils are abundant in everything except nitrogen, which is volatile and 
needs to be applied regularly in any soil to keep grass vigorous. However, 
many people overapply lawn fertilizers thinking that more is always better. 
The smart approach is to test soil to find out exactly what yours needs. 
Chapter 2 of Book VI tells you more about soils tests and about fertilizing.
Proper fertilizing replaces what your grass has used up rather than dump-
ing on a set amount each time. Overfeeding your lawn can result in damage 
to waterways and ground water through leaching of nutrients, and it means 
more watering and mowing — unfortunate outcomes all around.
 
Be sure to use only organic fertilizers, not chemical ones.
Aeration and dethatching
Aeration is the practice of removing plugs from the root zone of turf to 
reduce compaction and allow air and water to penetrate. Clay soils are espe-
cially susceptible to compaction. Dethatching is a method of combing thatch 
(built-up dead grass) from the turf. Thatch inhibits the penetration of water, 
organic fertilizer, and air, and it can encourage certain diseases and pest 
problems. Thatch is most prevalent in overfertilized and overwatered lawns, 
especially those that are Kentucky bluegrass.
 
If the soil food web (the balance of organisms that make their home in your 
soil) is in good shape, the beneficial microbes, including bacteria and fungi, 
insects, and earthworms will consume thatch and keep the soil open, and 
you won’t have to bother with the relatively laborious practices that are aera-
tion and renovation. But even with the best of care, conditions are sometimes 
less than ideal because of inherent soil conditions, such as heavy clay, com-
paction due to heavy use, or regrettable lapses of good practice. That’s when 
you’re prudent to step in and fix the situation.
Dealing with weeds
The best way to head off the weed problem at the pass is by doing all the 
right things to make your grasses dense and vigorous so that they out-
compete the weeds:
 
 Plant the right varieties for your area.
 
 Provide great soil and growing conditions.

454
Book V: Sustainable Landscaping 
 
 Mow high and as needed (when grass is tall enough that you’ll cut down 
only a quarter of its height — 4 inches if you’re mowing to 3 inches) to 
prevent seed set on annual weeds.
 
 Water deeply when necessary.
 
 Reseed bare spots quickly with disease and drought-resistant varieties. 
Any vacancies will be likely fill up with weeds, not desirable grasses.
 
 Monitor weed development and eradicate newcomers early.
 
Of course, you’ll still get some weeds. This ain’t the Garden of Eden. 
Outsmart them. For example, dandelions like a pH of around 7.5 (slightly alka-
line soil), so if you adjust the pH, the dandelions will diminish.
Clover absorbs nitrogen from the air and puts it into the soil where grasses 
can use it. It was a common feature of lawns until chemical company propa-
ganda convinced people it was a weed.
Turn to Chapter 3 of Book VI to find out more about green methods of weed 
control.
Working with a lawn-care company
Choose a lawn-care company that has a genuine commitment to sustain-
ability. Some of them use the same equipment for chemical and organic lawn 
care, resulting in contamination. Others don’t really understand the prin-
ciples behind organic lawn management and won’t deliver good results. The 
organic approach has been around long enough and enough training is out 
there that there’s no excuse for poor performance.
Ask questions about the program the company is proposing. Get specifics 
about the materials they’ll use and the strategies they recommend for your 
particular situation. Get a detailed written management plan and a fixed price 
as well as the usual references and written contract.
Maintain open communication with the workers to be sure you understand 
what they’re up to and are aware of any problems that come up. Remember 
that no gardening service — organic or otherwise — can keep things 100 per-
cent perfect all the time; nature isn’t perfect, but it does provide a heckuva 
strong system when you work with it instead of against it.

 Finding methods for gardening organically
O
rganic gardening means different things to different people. All agree 
that it means avoiding synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. But the phi-
losophy and practice of organic gardening often goes far beyond that simple 
concept. Growing organic food, flowers, and landscapes represents a com-
mitment to a sustainable system of living in harmony with nature. For many 
people, organic gardening is a way of life.
The way that people use — and misuse — soil, water, and air affects the lives 
and habitats of plants, insects, birds, fish, and animals, as well as humans. 
Dedicated organic gardeners adopt methods that improve soil health and fer-
tility, decrease erosion, and reduce pests and diseases through cultural and 
natural biological processes. They encourage plant and animal diversity in 
their landscapes.
Tuning in to Organic Methods
Observing your natural environment — watching the weather or noting the 
arrival of migrating birds and emerging insects — helps you choose the most 
appropriate ways to plant and nurture your vegetables, flowers, and land-
scape plants. When you see white butterflies fluttering around your garden, 
you know it’s time to protect your cabbages, broccoli, and cauliflower from 
cabbageworm. Instead of sprinkling on a pesticide after the caterpillars 
hatch, you can cover the plants with a special fabric to prevent the butter-
flies from laying eggs in the first place.

Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
Organic gardening is about preventing and treating problems in the least toxic 
and least invasive ways.
Working with nature’s cycles
Plants and animals live in ecosystems — communities in which each part con-
tributes to and affects the lives of the other parts. In a balanced ecosystem, 
each plant and animal species has enough food, water, and habitat (place to 
live). The predators have enough prey, and the prey have enough predators.
When one part of an ecosystem dies out or becomes too scarce, the plants 
and animals that depend on its function in the environment get out of bal-
ance, too. If honeybees disappeared, for example, the plants that need bees 
for flower pollination wouldn’t be able to produce seeds. If predators, such as 
ladybugs, become scarce, the insects they normally prey upon — aphids — 
could become so numerous that they would seriously injure or even kill the 
plants upon which they feed.
Some call this cycle the web of life, but ecosystems contain important nonliv-
ing parts, too. Soil nutrients, sunlight, water, and decaying plants and animals 
also contribute to the community health. When decayed organic material, 
called humus, becomes scarce, the soil microorganisms that feed on it die. 
Many of these microorganisms help release soil nutrients that plants need for 
growth. Without them, plants starve. Humus also holds moisture in the soil 
and helps soil particles stick together. When humus becomes depleted, the 
soil dries out too quickly, parching the plants and risking erosion.
 
Organic gardeners observe and use these natural relationships to grow 
healthy crops and landscape plants. For example, a gardener might shred 
the leaves that fall from his landscape trees and use them to mulch perennial 
flowers. The leaves suppress weeds and, as they decompose, they release 
plant nutrients and feed earthworms, which loosen and aerate the soil. When 
plants grow in such a balanced ecosystem, they receive all the nourishment 
they need from the soil and sun, and they bear plentiful flowers, fruits, and 
seeds. Insect pests and diseases do little long-term damage.
Taking from the soil without giving anything back breaks that natural cycle. 
Harvesting crops, bagging the lawn clippings, and raking fallen leaves 
removes organic material that’s ordinarily destined for the soil on which it 
falls. If the organic material isn’t replenished, the soil loses humus and its 
natural fertility. Substituting synthetic chemical fertilizers for naturally occur-
ring nutrients may feed plants, but it starves the soil.
 
Pesticides also upset the natural balance. Using pesticides to kill insects 
deprives the pests’ natural predators of food, which causes the predators to 
decline, necessitating more pesticides to achieve pest control. It’s a vicious 
cycle. In addition, pesticides often kill more than their intended targets. 

459
 Chapter 1: Sowing the Seeds of Organic Gardening
Book VI

Gardening
Beneficial insects and spiders that prey on plant pests and pollinate flowers 
die, too. And if pesticides drift on the wind or water away from their target, 
fish and birds may become poisoned, as well.
Gardening for the future
Depleting soil fertility, damaging and polluting ecosystems, and consuming 
excess water threatens the future of earth’s safe and abundant food supply. 
The way that farmers and individual gardeners and homeowners choose to 
farm, garden, and maintain their landscapes makes a difference in whether 
our land can continue to house, feed, and clothe us.
Organic gardeners grow plants using sustainable methods. According to 
Webster’s dictionary, sustain means “to keep in existence, to provide suste-
nance or nourishment.” Sustainable gardening practices, such as compost-
ing, conserving resources, and using nontoxic pest controls, ensure safe and 
plentiful food for future generations.
Organic doesn’t always equal nontoxic
Organic pesticides are derived from plant, animal, and mineral sources. 
Synthetic chemical pesticides come from petroleum and other chemical 
sources, and that’s the main difference between the two types.
Traditional farmers worldwide have used plant, animal, and mineral-based 
pesticides for centuries. Indeed, home gardeners continue to use concoc-
tions of garlic, hot peppers, onions, and other plants and substances to dis-
courage pests.
 
Many people assume that organic means nontoxic, but that definition isn’t 
really correct. Some commonly accepted organic pesticides are just as toxic, 
if not more so, than some synthetic chemical pesticides. Although organic 
pesticides generally have far fewer health side effects than synthetic pes-
ticides, that’s not always the case. Nicotine, for example, although derived 
from a plant and used as an organic pesticide, is highly toxic to humans and 
many other species.
Pesticides pose another problem. Some hang around in the environment 
long after their job is done. Chemists measure this persistence of chemicals 
by their half-life, or number of days it takes for half of the original quantity 
to break down into its components. Sunlight, water, soil microorganisms, 
and composition of the pesticide influence the half-life of these chemicals. 
Organic pesticides, and some synthetic ones, have half-lives of only a few 
days. Others, however, remain toxic in the environment for months, or even 
years, after the farmer or homeowner uses them.

Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Going Organic for Land’s Sake
The earth’s population continues to grow, but the amount of land available 
for growing food is rapidly disappearing. Erosion, development, pollution, 
dwindling water supplies, and other human-induced and natural disruptions 
threaten safe food and water supplies. Plant and animal species continue to 
disappear at alarming rates as humans damage and encroach upon their hab-
itats. Many gardeners work to improve this grim picture by making personal 
choices that, at the very least, do no harm to the environment.
 
The way you choose to grow flowers and food and maintain the landscape 
can actually improve the quality of the soil, air, water, and lives of the organ-
isms that depend on it. Organic gardening is based on the principle of work-
ing with nature instead of against it.
Erosion
It takes 500 years to produce one inch of natural topsoil, the rich matrix of 
humus, minerals, and microorganisms that plants depend on for growth. 
Plants, in turn, hold the topsoil in place with their roots and shelter it with 
their leaves. Soil without plants erodes easily — washing away with runoff 
from rain and snow or blowing away in the wind.
When soil washes into streams, rivers, and lakes, it significantly disrupts 
those ecosystems and pollutes the water. In fact, sediment accounts for 
nearly half of all lake pollution and 22 percent of river pollution, according 
a 1991 United States government report. Erosion devastates farmland, play-
ing a major role in the 2 million acres of arable land (land that’s suitable for 
growing crops) that the United States loses each year. The Iowa Department 
of Agriculture reported that half of that state’s topsoil had eroded by the 
early 1980s. Experts report that 30 percent of arable land was lost worldwide 
in the past 40 years of the 20th century due, in part, to erosion.
 
What happens in your own small garden plot may seem insignificant com-
pared to these mind-numbing statistics, but how you garden does play a role 
in the bigger picture. Gardeners can help reduce erosion by keeping plants 
growing on or covering the soil throughout the year, preserving and encour-
aging humus formation, and avoiding excessive tilling, disruption, or com-
pacting of the soil.
Wildlife and habitat
Pesticides kill pests, but unfortunately they harm innocent bystanders, as 
well. Some pesticides are highly toxic to fish and aquatic organisms, birds, 
and beneficial insects, such as bees.

461
 Chapter 1: Sowing the Seeds of Organic Gardening
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
Poisons harm innocent animals in two ways — either immediately or slowly 
over a period of time. A fast-acting pesticide, such as pyrethrum, kills bees 
and fish, as well as pests, on contact, but it breaks down rapidly in the envi-
ronment. Within a few days, it’s harmless.
Other pesticides, such as the infamous DDT, accumulate in the bodies of ani-
mals, harming them over a long period of time. In the case of DDT, which was 
banned in the U.S. in 1972, the chemical accumulated in fish, rodents, and 
other animals. When predators, such as hawks and eagles, ate the animals, 
they accumulated increasingly larger quantities of DDT, too. As a result, they 
laid eggs with thin shells that broke before they hatched, destroying genera-
tions of birds and sending many species to the brink of extinction.
 
Pesticide contamination of wildlife has serious implications for humans, too. 
In its report, Chemicals in Sportfish and Game Health Advisories 2000–2001, 
the New York State Department of Health lists 73 bodies of water within the 
state from which fish shouldn’t be eaten at all by women of childbearing 
age and children under the age of 15. At most, the department recommends 
eating no more than a half pound of fish per month from the least contami-
nated of these waters. You can find the full report at www.health.state.
ny.us/nysdoh/environ/fish.htm or call 800-458-1158, extension 27815. 
Sadly, advisories such as this one exist throughout the United States. The 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gathers all state fish advisories at 
www.epa.gov/waterscience/fish.
Pollution
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports pesticide contami-
nation of groundwater in 39 states. Groundwater flows below ground in the 
cracks in bedrock and between soil particles where it collects in large, satu-
rated areas called aquifers. The EPA estimated that, as of 1994, 1 percent of 
the country’s groundwater was already contaminated, and that the percent-
age was increasing rapidly. A 2006 report by the United States Geological 
Survey found at least one pesticide in about half of the wells in urban areas.
Half of the U.S. population uses groundwater sources for their drinking 
water — the other half gets their drinking water from surface water, such as 
rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Surface waters are even more vulnerable to 
pollution than groundwater and become polluted from runoff — water that 
runs over the ground, carrying pesticides, fertilizers, and soil with it.
Excess nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers from lawns, farms, and gardens 
wash into streams, lakes, and oceans where they contribute to excess algae 
growth. Densely growing algae depletes the oxygen in the water, which can 
kill fish and suffocate the native plant species. Nitrogen, the main element in 
most fertilizers, also moves easily through the soil, especially when mixed 
with water from rain, snowmelt, or irrigation. Depending on soil conditions, 

462
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
nitrogen percolates down through the soil and enters the groundwater, con-
taminating wells and other sources of drinking water. High concentrations of 
nitrate — a common nitrogen compound — can be toxic to children under 
the age of 6 months and to other mammals, including horses.
Disease
One of the main reasons to garden organically is to provide safe, wholesome 
food and a toxic-free environment. Despite extensive testing by chemical 
companies in controlled trials, it’s hard to know exactly what pesticides 
will do in the real world. It seems that every time you turn around, another 
pesticide is making headline news and hastily being pulled off the market. 
Chlorpyrifos is the sixth most commonly used pesticide in the United States. 
Although used extensively in homes, yards, and farms to kill fleas, roaches, 
ants, termites, lice, and agricultural pests, the chemical is now banned for 
home use because of its effects on humans. Agricultural use of chlorpyrifos 
also is being curtailed. As it turns out, chlorpyrifos harms the central ner-
vous system, cardiovascular system, and respiratory system. Children are 
particularly vulnerable because they crawl around and play on the floor and 
soil where the chemical is sprinkled and sprayed.
Ponder this: The EPA now considers 60 percent of all herbicides, 90 percent of 
all fungicides, and 30 percent of all insecticides to be potentially carcinogenic, 
or able to cause cancer. A study conducted by the National Cancer Institute 
found that farmers exposed to chemical herbicides had six times greater risks 
of developing cancer than farmers who were not exposed. Scary stuff.
Strategies for Organic Gardening
The most successful organic gardeners use a combination of strategies to 
grow healthy food and ornamental plants. They monitor and increase soil 
fertility, observe and emulate nature, and make planting decisions based on 
the needs of the plants and opportunities of their site. Organic gardeners see 
their gardens as a small part of the larger natural world and understand that 
their gardening practices have an impact that goes far beyond the borders 
of their yards.
If you’re just getting started, though, all these practices can seem daunting — 
even discouraging. Keep in mind that gardening is a process and take it one 
step at a time. Here’s a rundown of important strategies for making your 
garden organic:

463
 Chapter 1: Sowing the Seeds of Organic Gardening
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Enrich your soil. Enriching your soil instead of pouring on fertilizer is sim-
ilar to eating healthy foods instead of popping vitamin tablets. Get your 
diet and soil right, and many other potential problems are apt to be less 
troublesome. Organic matter, which decomposes into humus, increases 
soil’s ability to hold moisture and drain efficiently, feeds the beneficial 
soil organisms, and adds important plant nutrients. You can increase the 
amount of organic matter in your soil by adding compost and using plant-
based mulches, such as shredded leaves, bark, and straw.
 
 Let nature do the weeding. Preventing weeds is so much easier than 
getting rid of them when they’re all grown up. Weeds flourish on open 
ground, but mulch can slow them down — even stop them in their 
tracks. Surround your garden and landscape plants with bark, pine nee-
dles, grass clippings, shredded leaves, straw, and other organic materi-
als to shade the ground and keep weeds from sprouting. Use landscape 
fabric — not plastic — or newspaper in paths and around trees and 
shrubs, covering them with loose mulch materials.
 
 Starting a new garden or reclaiming an old one usually involves ridding 
the land of weeds. Instead of reaching for a bottle of herbicide, use the 
power of the sun to solarize your soil with weed-killing heat. See Chapter 
3 of this book for step-by-step instructions.
 
 Choose healthy and disease-resistant plants. Your plants won’t get sick 
if they’re immune to or at least tolerant of the nastiest diseases. Plant 
breeders work long and hard to develop varieties of your favorite fruits, 
vegetables, flowers, and landscape plants that fight off devastating dis-
eases. Read catalog descriptions and plant tags to find resistant plants 
whenever possible.
 
 Buying and planting only healthy plants also pays off. Struggling plants 
attract diseases and insects, but thriving plants fight them off. Take time 
to examine trees and shrubs and look for virus-free fruits. Don’t bring 
home any insect-infested plants, either. If you have any doubts about a 
plant’s health, quarantine a new plant in a separate area before adding it 
to your landscape or garden.
 
 Put plants in the right place. Give your plants the soil, sun, and mois-
ture conditions they prefer to keep them healthy and thriving. That 
advice is especially important for long-term landscape and fruit plants.
 
 Encourage beneficial insects. Most bugs are good bugs for your garden. 
Each harmful insect has a predator or parasite that attacks it, making your 
work easier. You can cheer these helpmates by planting flowers and other 
plants that they’re attracted to and by avoiding the use of pesticides.
 
 Practice integrated pest management. These big words describe a 
simple concept. Integrated pest management (IPM) is the practice of look-
ing at all the costs and options before deciding on a course of pest treat-
ment. Instead of merely eradicating pests, you manage them. (For more 
on this approach, see the sidebar “Practicing IPM in everyday life.”)

464
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Use companion planting. Some plants naturally grow better in the 
company of another species. In some cases, one plant repels the pests 
that affect the other, or it attracts beneficial insects that attack its com-
panion’s pests. Other plants add nitrogen to the soil that benefits their 
neighbors. Deep-rooted plants bring nutrients closer to the soil surface 
where shallow-rooted plants can reach them.
 
 Add traps and barriers to your arsenal. Sometimes, protecting your 
crops from insects is as easy as throwing a fabric row cover over them. If 
the cabbage moths can’t reach your broccoli to lay their eggs, for exam-
ple, you won’t find caterpillars in your vegetables. A strip of newspaper 
wrapped around the tender stem of a seedling can prevent a cutworm 
from chewing through it. You can foil many common pests with specially 
colored, sticky-coated traps. You can also use insects’ own attractants 
against them. Pheromones, which are scents secreted by insects to attract 
a mate, are among the most powerful tools in your pest-control kit.
 
 Pheromone baits combined with traps are the downfall of millions of 
Japanese beetles and other pests every year. They attract only the pest 
you want to eradicate, so they’re safe to use around beneficial insects.
 
 Promote diversity. Natural plant populations contain many species 
scattered over a large area, making them less vulnerable to insect and 
pest eradication. Plants also benefit their neighbors in a number of 
ways. Use the same concepts in your garden by mixing crops within a 
row and avoiding large patches of the same variety.
Practicing IPM in everyday life
Most of the time, reaching for pesticide to 
eradicate pests isn’t the best move. In fact, you 
should focus on managing the pests instead 
of annihilating them. For example, in an apple 
orchard, several serious pests and diseases 
affect the quality and quantity of the harvest. 
An orchard manager who practices IPM deals 
with them in several ways:
  Monitors the weather carefully: The 
appearance of many insects and diseases 
is tied closely to the temperature, humidity, 
and time of the year. Anticipating a problem 
gives you more options than does reacting.
  Monitors pests: Keep a sharp eye out for 
trouble. It doesn’t make sense to treat 
for pests unless they’re causing serious 
damage. A few pests may be insignificant 
and tolerable in the big picture.
  Keeps it clean: Good plant managers dis-
courage problems by practicing good cul-
tural techniques, such as rotating crops 
from one part of the garden to another, 
destroying harmful weeds, and cleaning up 
infested plant debris.
  Uses the least invasive and least toxic con-
trol methods first: For persistent problems, 
first use a nontoxic control, such as a weed 
flamer (a device that burns weeds; see 
Chapter 3) or strong blast of water. Move to 
traps and barriers and then as a last resort 
to pesticides that affect only the particular 
pest.

B
uilding healthy soil is the single most important thing you can do to 
ensure the success of your garden and landscape plants. Healthy soil 
is alive with microorganisms that feed upon and decompose organic matter 
and release nutrients for plants to use. Beneficial microorganisms in the 
soil prey on harmful ones and protect plant roots from diseases and pests. 
Earthworms and other soil creatures tunnel through the soil, opening up 
spaces for oxygen, water, and nutrients to move freely. Many pesticides and 
synthetic fertilizers destroy that subterranean life, while organic gardening 
practices promote it. In this chapter, you find out how to provide the best 
growing medium for your plants and how to keep them going strong with 
compost and organic fertilizers.
Getting to Know Your Soil
Several factors contribute to soil health, including pH, organic matter and 
nutrient levels, drainage, and soil type, and you need to understand a little 
about each of them.
 
Soil health is so important that before you start a vegetable, perennial, or 
annual flower garden, consider spending one growing season just building 
the fertility of the soil — before planting. One season spent adding organic 
matter and nutrients and adjusting the pH may save you years of struggling 
to produce healthy plants.

466
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Identifying soil type
The most basic factor you need to know about is soil type, which is the com-
position of the soil’s particles you inherit in your garden. Knowing your soil’s 
type helps you determine what you need to do to build healthy soil.
Soil comes in three main types, each with its own strengths and weaknesses:
 
 Clay: Clay soil has the most potentially high natural fertility but can be 
difficult to work with. Clay’s individual soil particles are so small that 
water and air have little room to squeeze between them. Clay soil stays 
wet longer, contains little oxygen, and dries as hard as concrete.
 
 Sandy: Sand particles are large, leaving plenty of room for water and 
air to move between them but allowing sandy soil to dry out quickly. 
Nutrients leach through sandy soils quickly, too, making them naturally 
less fertile and more prone to drought.
 
 Silt: Silt soils have moderate-sized particles that hold some water and 
air but also allow the water to drain. They have moderate amounts of 
fertility, are easy to work with, and make life easy for the gardener.
You may have heard some gardeners singing the praises of loam — soil that 
consists of roughly the same amounts of sand, silt, and clay. It holds opti-
mum amounts of water, oxygen, and nutrients for most plant growth. If you’re 
lucky, it’s in your yard already. More likely, you need to amend your soil to 
work toward loam’s balance.
 
Your soil is probably a mixture of sand, silt, and clay, but to find out the 
predominant type of soil in your garden, reach out and touch it. Take a small 
handful of damp soil in your hand and rub a pinch of it between your thumb 
and pointing finger. If it feels gritty, it’s mostly sand; if it feels slick and slimy, 
it’s mostly clay. If it feels like something between those two, it’s mostly silt.
For a more accurate measurement of the amounts of clay, silt, and sand in 
your soil, do the jar test. Here’s how:
 
1. Collect soil from several places in your garden.
 
2. Mix the samples thoroughly and measure out 1 cup of the mixture.
 
3. Let the soil air-dry on a sheet of paper until crumbly.
 
4. Crush chunks until the soil is very fine, removing any stones and 
debris as you do so.
 
5. Place soil in a narrow glass jar, such as a pint-sized canning jar, and 
add 1 teaspoon of nonsudsy dishwasher detergent.
 
6. Fill jar 
2⁄3 full of water, seal, and shake vigorously to mix the contents.

7. Put down the jar and start a timer.
 
8. Measure and mark the level of settled soil after 1 minute.
 
 This soil is sand.
 
9. Measure again in 2 hours and subtract the sand layer to find the 
amount of silt.
 
 After several days, the clay settles out on top of the sand and silt.
 
10. Measure this top layer, subtracting the sand and silt to find the 
amount of clay.
 
11. Divide the height of each level by the total height of the settled soil 
and multiply by 100 to find the percentage of each.
 
 For example, if the total settled soil is 6 inches high and the sand portion 
is 3 inches, the percent of sand is 50 percent:
 
 3⁄6 × 100 = 50%
Evaluating drainage
Knowing  your type of soil helps you determine how well water will drain 
through it. What’s the big deal with drainage? Well, certain plants, such as 
lavender, need soil that drains quickly to thrive, while other plants, such as 
willows, can survive and flourish in wet soils.
Sometimes drainage is obvious. Puddles in your lawn a day or two after heavy 
rains certainly indicate poor drainage. But, sometimes a layer of clay lurks 
underneath a loamy or sandy soil, which causes water to linger in otherwise 
well-drained soil. So, before you plant — especially trees and shrubs — dig a 
hole to check what lies beneath the surface.
 
Here’s how to check for percolation, or soil drainage:
 
1. Dig a hole 1 foot in diameter and 1 foot deep.
 
2. Fill the hole with water.
 
3. Time how long it takes for the water to drain.
 
 If the water drains in
 
• 10 minutes or less, your soil drains too fast and probably dries out 
too quickly.
 
• 10 to 30 minutes, your soil is well-drained.
 
• Less than 4 hours, the drainage is okay for most plants.
 
• More than 4 hours, the soil is poorly drained.

Use this information to help choose the most appropriate plants for your 
soil. Keep in mind that adding organic matter, such as compost, to the soil 
can improve the drainage of both sandy and clayey soils. See the section 
“Organic Matter: The Soul of Soil,” later in this chapter.
Finding soil pH and nutrient content
After you know the type of soil you have and how well it drains (see the pre-
vious section), you need to know its pH and nutrient levels. The soil pH mea-
sures the alkalinity (sweetness) or acidity (sourness) of the soil.
 
Soil is acidic if it’s below pH 7 on a scale from 0 to 14 and alkaline if it’s above 
pH 7. Knowing your soil’s pH is important because some nutrients are avail-
able to plants only within a specific pH range. Most plants prefer soil that’s 
between pH 6.0 and 7.0.
A simple rule is that if your plants are growing, flowering, and fruiting well, 
the levels of nutrients your plants need are fine. If you’re just starting out or 
if you aren’t satisfied with the growth of your plants, a little testing can help 
you get to the root of the matter. Too high or too low pH or unbalanced nutri-
ent levels can result in yellow, stunted, and unproductive plants. Unhealthy 
plants are more prone to insects and disease attacks, which translates into 
more work for you and less satisfaction from your garden. And that’s not 
what you want!
Using a home soil test kit is simple and gives you a basic pH reading and an 
estimation of the major nutrients in your soil. You can buy a range of test kits 
at nurseries and garden centers. The more sophisticated tests cost more but 
give you more accurate results.
You can also send  a soil sample to a lab for testing. You simply take a repre-
sentative sample of the soil from your garden, fill out a form, and mail or take 
it to the lab. The results are more accurate and detailed than if you do the 
test yourself with a home kit, plus testing labs can look for things that home 
kits can’t, such as organic matter and micronutrients.
Lab reports give you the current levels of nutrients and soil pH and also offer 
specific recommendations about which nutrients to add to your soil and 
in what quantity for your plants’ optimum growth. Lab tests can get costly, 
however, especially if you have many different types of plantings, such as 
perennial flowers, vegetables, and lawn, and you do separate tests for each 
type. Run a Google search or check the phone book under “Soil Testing” for 
private soil labs in your area or contact your state university’s extension 
service. Many state universities test soil for a small fee or can recommend a 
private testing lab.

pH test results
Soil tests measure two components: your soil pH and its major nutrients. 
Most plants grow best in the range between 6.0 and 7.0. Some plants, how-
ever, such as blueberries and rhododendrons, like a highly acid soil (pH 
below 5.0), so you may need to adjust the pH to individual plants.
In general, you add lime or limestone to raise the pH and sulfur to lower it. 
How much lime or sulfur you need to add depends on the type of soil you 
have and its current pH. A soil-testing lab can make a specific recommenda-
tion based on that information.
You can spread the material by hand or use a drop spreader made to spread 
grass seed on a lawn. In the garden, work the lime or sulfur into the top few 
inches of soil with a rake or shovel after spreading.
 
When adding lime or sulfur to your soil, remember to wear gloves and a dust 
mask because this material can be very dusty and irritating if you inhale it.
Don’t expect results right away. Most limestone or powdered sulfur prod-
ucts take a few months to react with the soil enough to change the pH to the 
desired levels — another good reason to prepare your soil a season before 
you plan to plant. Keep tabs on your pH with an annual test and make adjust-
ments as necessary.
Nutrient test results
Soil tests also show the quantities of soil nutrients that are available to plants, 
especially the three nutrients that plants use in the greatest amount — nitro-
gen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). These three nutrients are the 
ones you see listed on the front of fertilizer or compost bags. Soils also contain 
many micronutrients, such as magnesium and calcium, that plants need in 
smaller amounts. If any nutrient is insufficient, plants don’t grow to their maxi-
mum potential.
The balance of nutrients is more important for the proper functioning of your 
plants than the actual levels of the nutrients. For example, too much of one 
nutrient may create a situation where other nutrients, though plentiful in the 
soil, aren’t taken up by the plants.
Organic Matter: The Soul of Soil
Organic matter is basically material that was living or was produced by a 
living thing, including grass clippings, leaves, hay, straw, pine needles, wood 
chips, sawdust, manure, and anything else that used to be alive. It’s a miracle 
worker that improves soil by

470
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Feeding microorganisms and other soil life
 
 Improving the soil structure
 
 Increasing soil’s reserve of nutrients
 
Add organic matter to your plantings any time you can — whether it’s straw 
mulch between vegetable garden beds, compost around perennial flowers, 
or bark mulch around trees or shrubs. Try adding a 3- to 4-inch layer of dead 
leaves to your garden, either in the fall or up to one month before you start 
your vegetable or annual flower garden, and work it into the soil.
 
Soil microbes, such as fungi and bacteria, don’t work efficiently when soil is 
cold and wet, such as in early spring. They also use nutrients in the soil to 
fuel their eating, so if you give them too much material to work with at once, 
they tie up the nutrients, creating a deficiency for the plants. If you live in a 
cold-winter climate, add straw, leaves, and other raw organic matter in the 
summer or autumn when the soil is still warm to allow them plenty of time to 
decompose before plants need the nutrients.
Dung ho!
Few things get organic gardeners as excited as a good pile of aged animal 
manure. If you’re not yet a connoisseur of manure, think of it as processed 
organic matter that has already begun decomposing. It does wonders for soil 
health and plant growth.
 
You can add the droppings of many different farm (and sometimes wild) ani-
mals to your garden, giving the soil all the benefits of organic matter plus a little 
higher boost of the N-P-K nutrients. (See the “Nutrient test results” section, 
earlier in this chapter.) Like a fine wine, however, manure is best aged. Fresh 
manure may be too potent for tender plants and can contain bacteria that make 
people sick. It’s a good idea to let manure age for six months to a year before 
using, or you can compost it. (See the “Compost: The prince of organic matter” 
section, later in this chapter). If you add fresh manure to your garden in the fall 
and mix it into the soil, it will be ready for planting in the spring.
 
Keep these rules in mind when using manures:
 
 Compost fresh manures before using. Mix into a compost pile and age 
before using or spread on the garden and work into the soil at least a 
month before planting.
 
 Select manure from the oldest pile at the farm. Many farm manure piles 
contain a lot of additional organic matter such as sawdust from horse 
or chicken bedding. Manure from the oldest pile probably has naturally 
decomposed this bedding the most and can be used directly on your 
garden.

471
 Chapter 2: Improving Your Soil and Feeding Your Plants Organically
Book VI

Gardening
 
 Use bagged manures. They’re usually composted and ready to use. If 
you need a lot of manure, however, buying bags can be costly.
 
 Apply composted manure annually. In general, add a 2- to 3-inch layer 
of manure to garden beds and around perennial plants at least once a 
year.
 
Cat, dog, pig, and human manures have no place in composting. They can 
carry diseases that affect humans, and so you should never use them in your 
garden.
Green manure
Another great way to get organic matter into your garden is to grow your 
own. Green manures are plants that you grow specifically to cut down and 
mix into the soil to add organic matter and nutrients. Farm-supply stores and 
mail-order catalogs usually offer the widest selection of green manures, but 
many garden centers sell the common ones. The following plants are some of 
the valuable green manures that you can grow in your garden:
 
 Alfalfa
 
 Annual ryegrass
 
 Barley
 
 Buckwheat
 
 Cowpeas
 
 Crimson clover
 
 Fava beans
 
 Hairy vetch
 
 Oats
 
 Winter rye
 
 Winter wheat
To grow green manure, broadcast (apply uniformly) the seed as you would 
for a lawn and let the crop grow through the gardening season. If you want 
to prevent the plants from returning next season, turn the plants under the 
soil before they produce seeds,. In addition to adding organic matter, green 
manures
 
 Control erosion: Hardy crops, such as winter rye and wheat, cover the 
soil over the dormant season, preventing wind and rain from eroding 
precious topsoil.

472
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Loosen compacted soils: Some green manures, such as alfalfa, have 
aggressive roots, which can grow 3 feet deep into the soil. They break 
up compacted soils and even “mine” nutrients deep in the soil, bringing 
them to the surface where other plants can use them.
 
 Balance nutrients: Some green manures, such as clover, vetch, peas, 
and beans, are legumes, which means that they have the unique ability 
to take nitrogen from the air and make it available to plants — often in 
the same year. These crops are great to grow right before you grow a 
heavy nitrogen-feeding crop, such as sweet corn.
 
 Control weeds: Some green manures, such as buckwheat, grow so 
quickly and aggressively that they can shade or crowd out weeds grow-
ing in the same ground.
 
 Maintain high levels of soil microorganisms: When the plants are 
incorporated into the soil, they feed the essential microbes that make 
nutrients available to plants. The plant residues also provide surfaces 
on which the microbes can live.
 
 Attract beneficial insects: Some green manures, such as clover, have 
flowers that beneficial insects love. These insects help with pollination 
and insect pest control in your garden.
Compost: The prince of organic matter
The best and most refined of organic matters is compost, which is organic 
matter and/or manures that have decomposed until they resemble loamy 
soil. Thoroughly decomposed compost contains a lot of humus — the ben-
eficial, soil-improving material your plants need. Whether the original source 
was grass clippings, sawdust, animal manure, or vegetable scraps from your 
kitchen, all organic matter eventually becomes compost.
Whether you make your own compost (see the “Composting: Turning Waste 
into Garden Gold” section, later in this chapter), or buy it ready-made, you 
can add finished compost anytime to the garden or around plants. Pile on a 
2- to 3-inch layer annually around plants and on garden beds.
Why not just add raw organic matter to your garden instead of composting 
it? By composting the materials first, the final product is uniform in color, 
nutrients, and texture; is odor free; and contains fewer viable weed seeds 
and potential disease organisms (depending on how it was composted). Your 
plants will be happy with you for treating them so well.
You can buy compost from a number of sources either in bulk or bagged, 
depending on where you live. Bagged compost is the easiest way to go, espe-
cially if you have a small yard or container garden. The down side is that you 
don’t really know the quality of the compost until you get it home.

473
 Chapter 2: Improving Your Soil and Feeding Your Plants Organically
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
For larger quantities of compost, buy in bulk. The price is lower, and you can 
check the quality of the compost. Many private companies, municipalities, 
and community groups make and sell compost. Often, they even deliver the 
compost to your yard for a fee.
 
Use these tips to evaluate bulk compost:
 
 Consider the source. Before buying the compost, ask about the primary 
organic matter sources that were used to make the compost. Compost 
made from yard waste (leaves and grass clippings) is usually considered 
the safest and best. Other compost may contain ingredients that had 
contaminants, such as herbicides from agricultural crop residues and 
heavy metals from municipal wastes, which may affect the growth of 
your plants or accumulate toxins in your soil.
 
 Look at the color and texture. Finished compost should look dark and 
have a crumbly texture without any large pieces of undecomposed 
organic matter, such as branches or pieces of wood.
 
 Squeeze it. If water oozes out when you squeeze a handful of the 
material, it’s too wet; if it blows away easily, it’s too dry.
 
 Give it a whiff. The smell should be earthy without a strong ammonia or 
sour smell.
Making your own compost is probably the simplest way to ensure high qual-
ity compost and save some money. (To find out how to make your own com-
post, see the next section.) It’s really not as complicated as you may think: 
The many commercial composting bins and containers on the market make it 
a mess-free and hassle-free process.
Composting: Turning Waste 
into Garden Gold
At least two schools of thought exist on building composting piles:
 
 The active school makes uniform piles, mixes materials thoroughly at the 
correct ratios of carbon (brown stuff) and nitrogen (green stuff) — see the 
“Getting ratios right” section for more on carbon/nitrogen ratios — and 
keeps the pile watered just enough to keep it moist, but has enough air to 
breathe. They enjoy finished compost a month or two from the start.
 
 A second school says, pile it in the backyard somewhere, and eventually 
(within six months or so) it’ll turn into usable compost. After all, every-
thing rots doesn’t it?

474
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Although the second school of thought is technically correct, you may find 
advantages to building a pile by the rules espoused by the first school. A 
well-constructed pile — built with the proper dimensions and maintained 
correctly — heats up fast; decomposes uniformly and quickly; kills many 
diseases, insects, and weed seeds; doesn’t smell; and is easy to turn and 
maintain. Conversely, a pile just thrown together rarely heats up and, there-
fore, takes  longer to decompose. This type of cold composting doesn’t kill any 
diseases, insects, or weed seeds; may smell bad; and definitely looks messy. 
Still, it’s far better than not composting at all, so if cold composting is all you 
care to do, by all means go for it.
 
Containing   your compost pile makes it look neater, helps you maintain the 
correct moisture, and prevents animals from getting into it. You can build 
your own, as shown in Figure 2-1, or buy a commercial home composting 
unit. The advantages of a commercial composter include the availability of 
a wide range of attractive sizes and shapes and ease of use. Choose from 
box-shaped plastic and wooden bins and barrels or elevated and easy-to-turn 
tumblers, as shown in Figure 2-2. Buying bins is costly, however, and most 
bins produce only small quantities of compost at a time, especially compared 
to a homemade bin that’s built from scrap lumber or wire.

Here’s what  you need to know to build a good compost pile:
 
1. Choose a well-drained, partly shady location, out of the way, but still 
within view so that you don’t forget about the pile.
 
2. Make or buy a bin.
 
 Create a wire cylinder that’s 3 to 4 feet in diameter or build a three-sided 
box (similar to the one in Figure 2-1), that’s 4 to 5 feet high and wide.
 
3. Add a 6-inch layer of “brown” organic matter, such as hay, straw, old 
leaves, and sawdust, to the bottom of the container.
 
4. Add a 2- to 3-inch layer of “green” organic matter, such as green grass 
clippings, manure, table scraps, or even high-nitrogen fertilizer, such 
as cottonseed meal, on top of the brown layer.
 
5. Repeat these layers, watering each one as you go, until the pile is 4 to 
5 feet tall and fills the bin.
 
 A smaller pile won’t heat up well, and a larger pile can be difficult to 
manage.
 
6. Within two days, mix the layers together thoroughly.
 
7. Cover the pile with a tarp to keep rain away and preserve moisture.
 
 If the pile gets too soggy or too dry, it won’t heat up.

Good additions for great compost
What you put in the compost pile is up to you — just remember that it needs 
to be from an organic material. Here’s a short list of possibilities:
 
 Hay
 
 Straw
 
 Pine needles
 
 Leaves
 
 Kitchen scraps (egg shells, old bread, vegetable and fruit scraps)
 
 Animal manure, except for dog, cat, pig, or human
 
 Old vegetables, flowers, or trimmings from trees and shrubs
 
 Sawdust
 
 Wood chips
 
 Weeds
 
 Shredded black and white newspaper
Poison for compost piles
 
Some items don’t belong in your compost pile. Hot compost piles can kill off 
many diseases, weed seeds, and insects, but it’s not a sure thing; some of 
these unpleasant guests may survive to invade your garden again. Certain 
materials can also invite unwanted wildlife to the pile or spread human 
diseases.
Avoid adding the following to your compost bin:
 
 Kitchen scraps like meats, oils, fish, dairy products, and bones. They 
attract unwanted animals, such as rats and raccoons, to the pile.
 
 Weeds that have gone to seed or that spread by their roots, such as 
quackgrass.
 
 Diseased or insect-infested vegetable or flower plants.
 
 Herbicide-treated grass clippings or weeds.
 
 Dog, cat, or pig feces.

Getting ratios right
In composting  corners, you often hear about the C/N ratio or carbon to nitro-
gen ratio. Basically, all organic matter can be divided into carbon-rich (brown 
stuff) and nitrogen-rich (green stuff) materials. Using the right mixture of 
brown to green stuff when building a compost pile encourages the pile to 
heat up and decompose efficiently. Although nearly any combination of 
organic materials eventually decomposes, for the fastest and most efficient 
compost pile in town, strike the correct balance (C/N ratio) between the two 
types — usually 25 to 1.
Table 2-1 shows which common compost materials are high in carbon and 
which materials are high in nitrogen. Notice that the softer materials, such as 
fresh grass clippings, tend to be higher in nitrogen than hard materials, such 
as sawdust. Mix these together to form a pile with an average C/N ratio of 
25:1 to 30:1, and you’ll be well on your way to beautiful compost.
 
Use the ratios in Table 2-1 as guidelines. Actual ratios vary depending on the 
sources of the materials and other factors. And speaking of sources — be 
sure that your compost materials haven’t been contaminated with   pesticides 
or other chemicals.

Keeping your pile happy
A hot pile is a happy  pile: Heat makes the ingredients break down faster 
and kills weed seeds and diseases. If you follow the method of just throw-
ing everything together, the pile rarely heats up. If you follow the method of 
building the pile carefully with the recommended C/N ratio, as you find in the 
“Getting ratios right” section, the pile will start to cook within a week. Now 
you need to keep it cooking. Here’s the procedure:
 
1. Keep the pile moist by periodically watering it.
 
 Dig into the pile about 1 foot to see whether it’s moist. If not, water the 
pile thoroughly, but not so that it’s soggy. The pile needs air, too, and 
adding too much water removes air spaces. If you built the pile with 
moist ingredients, such as kitchen scraps, it won’t need watering at first.
 
2. Turn the pile when it cools down.
 
 Using a garden fork, remove the outside layers and put them aside. 
Remove the inside layers into another pile and then switch. Place the 
outside layers in the center of the new pile and the inside layers along 
the outside of the new pile.
 
3. Let it cook again.
 
 How hot it gets and how long it cooks depends on the ratio of C/N mate-
rials in the pile and whether you have the correct moisture levels.
 
4. When it’s cool, turn it again.
 
 You should have finished compost after two to three turnings. The fin-
ished product should be cool, crumbly, dark in color, and earthy smelling.
Sometimes,  a compost pile smells bad, or contains pieces of undecomposed 
materials, or never heats up. Chances are that one of the following conditions 
occurred:
 
 The pile was too wet or dry.
 
 You added too many carbon materials and not enough nitrogen materials.
 
 The pieces of material were too big or packed together. Shred leaves, 
branches, and pieces of wood to decompose more quickly.
 
 The pile was too small.
 
You can find a lot of compost aids  on the market. Bioactivators — packages 
of concentrated microbes — are one of the most popular because they can 
speed the decomposition process. These microbes occur naturally, however, 
and many are already present in a well-constructed compost pile. Save your 
money and use microbe-rich compost materials or add a scoop of healthy 
soil instead.

Addressing Plants’ Nutrient Needs
Plants need 16 essential elements  or nutrients for proper growth. The nutri-
ents that plants need in the largest quantities are carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen, which plants get from the air and from the water in the soil. Others 
come from minerals in the soil. Even if the soil contains enough  nutrients, 
environmental conditions, such as soil temperature, nutrient imbalance, and 
high or low pH, can make some of them unavailable for plants. For example, 
if the pH is below 5.0, phosphorus combines with iron, aluminum, and man-
ganese to form compounds that plants can’t use. Most nutrients are available 
when soil pH is in the ideal 6.0 to 7.0.
 
Before you add fertilizer to your soil, take a soil sample to a   soil testing lab 
or farm and garden store or use a home test kit to find out the soil pH and 
exactly which minerals your plants need and in what quantities. (For more on 
this topic, see the section “Identifying soil type,” earlier in this chapter.)
The big three nutrients
Nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium are often called macronutrients or pri-
mary nutrients because plants need them in the largest quantities. Healthy, 
fertile soil naturally contains these three elements and plants can easily take 
them up. But in many cases, you must supplement the soil with fertilizers, 
especially if you’re growing vegetables, fruits, or other demanding crops.
Complete fertilizers contain all three macronutrients — nitrogen (N), phos-
phorous (P), and  potassium (K) — but don’t let the term “complete” fool you. 
It doesn’t mean that the fertilizer has all the nutrients that plants need, just 
that it contains all three of the major ones.
 
Bags of complete fertilizers contain three numbers, such as 5-3-3, for exam-
ple. Each number represents a percentage of N-P-K in that bag, as measured 
by weight. In this case, a bag of 5-3-3 fertilizer contains 5 percent nitrogen, 3 
percent phosphorous, and 3 percent potassium. To determine the amount 
in pounds of each nutrient in the bag, multiply the weight of the bag (say 50 
pounds) by the percentage of each nutrient: 50 pounds x .05 = 2.5 pounds of 
nitrogen. You need to know the actual amount of nutrients in the bag because 
a soil test often recommends pounds of actual N-P-K to add per square foot to 
your garden.
Each of these nutrients plays a critical role in plant growth and development. 
Here’s what they do and their deficiency symptoms to watch for:

480
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Nitrogen (N): This   critical element is responsible for the healthy green foli-
age of plants, as well as protein and chlorophyll development. (Chlorophyll 
is the pigment that makes plants green and is a vital component in photo-
synthesis.) Nitrogen moves easily in the soil and leaches out rapidly, espe-
cially from sandy soils and in high rainfall areas or irrigated gardens. Plants 
use a lot of nitrogen during the growing season, so it’s commonly the most 
deficient element. If you add too much nitrogen, however, plants will have 
dark green, leafy growth but less root development and delayed flowering 
and fruiting. Symptoms of nitrogen deficiency include slow growth and yel-
lowing leaves, especially on older foliage. Animal manures, soybean meal, 
and cottonseed meal provide high levels of nitrogen.
 
 Phosphorous (P): Plants  need phosphorus for strong root growth; fruit, 
stem, and seed development; disease resistance; and general plant vigor. 
Phosphorous doesn’t move in the soil as easily as nitrogen does so you 
don’t have to add it as frequently. Depending on where you live in the coun-
try, your soil may have plenty of phosphorous, but it may be unavailable 
to plants. Phosphorus availability depends on warm soil temperatures, pH 
range, and the levels of other nutrients, such as calcium and potassium, in 
the soil. Maintain the soil pH between 5 and 7 to keep phosphorous avail-
able. (For more on pH levels, see the section “Finding soil pH and nutrient 
content,” earlier in this chapter.) Work phosphorous-rich fertilizers into the 
soil around the root zone at planting time to make them readily accessible 
by the plant roots. Deficiency symptoms include stunted plants with dark 
green foliage, reddish-purple stems or leaves, and fruits that drop early. 
Rock phosphate and bone meal are good sources of phosphorous.
 
 Potassium (K): This  nutrient, sometimes called potash, is essential for 
vigorous growth, disease resistance, fruit and vegetable flavor and 
development, and general plant function. Potassium doesn’t move 
around in the soil, so work the fertilizer into the root zone. Potassium 
also breaks down slowly, so you won’t need to add it often. Annual appli-
cations of organic matter may supply enough potassium fertilizer, but 
a soil test is the surest way to determine need. Avoid adding too much 
potassium fertilizer because it can upset the N-P-K balance in the soil 
and make other nutrients, such as magnesium, unavailable. Deficiency 
symptoms include yellow areas along the leaf veins and leaf  edges, 
crinkled and rolled up leaves, and dead twigs.
Secondary nutrients
Calcium, magnesium, and sulfur are called secondary nutrients. They’re 
essential not only for plant growth but also for adjusting and maintaining soil 
pH. Calcium and magnesium, found in dolomitic limestone, help raise the pH 
of acid soils toward neutral where most plants grow  best. In alkaline soils, 
sulfur helps lower the pH to the optimum level. These nutrients are also vital 
to plant functioning and, if excessive or deficient, can upset plants’ ability to 
use other nutrients in the soil.

481
 Chapter 2: Improving Your Soil and Feeding Your Plants Organically
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
Although home garden soils rarely are deficient in these nutrients, keep your 
eye out for these deficiency symptoms:
 
 Calcium: Twisted, dark green new leaves and leaf tip burn. Flowers  may 
have weak stems, and fruit may develop rotten spots on the bottom 
(opposite from the stem end).
 
 Magnesium: Curled leaf edges and discolored older leaves.
 
 Sulfur: Slow growth and small, spindly plants.
Micronutrients
The essential nutrients that plants need  in the smallest quantities are called 
micronutrients, and they include iron, manganese, copper, boron, molybde-
num, chlorine, and zinc. Adding too much of any one of these micronutrients 
can cause more problems than adding none at all. Luckily, organic matter 
usually supplies adequate amounts of these nutrients.
Micronutrient deficiency is often hard to spot because plants vary in their 
specific needs and symptoms. Maintaining the pH between 6.0 and 7.0 and 
adding manures and compost often is enough to make micronutrients avail-
able for plant use. (For more on pH levels, see the section “Finding soil pH 
and nutrient content,” earlier in this chapter.) The microorganisms that feed 
on organic matter help plants take up these and other nutrients — another 
good reason to use compost and other organic fertilizers! Other micronutri-
ent sources include kelp/seaweed, bone meal, and blood meal.
Considering Sources of 
Organic Fertilizers
Organic fertilizers generally come  from plants, animals, or minerals. Soil 
organisms break down the material into nutrients that plants can use. Some 
organic fertilizers contain significant amounts of only one of the major nutri-
ents, such as phosphorus in bone meal, but they often have trace amounts of 
many other beneficial nutrients. As a general rule, organic fertilizers release 
about half their nutrients in the first season and continue to feed the soil 
over subsequent years.
Commercially formulated fertilizers list specific nutrients levels on the pack-
age, but bulk products, such as compost and manure, have widely variable 
contents. The nutrient levels for each fertilizer in this section are approxi-
mate because they vary depending on the product and supplier.

Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Plant-based fertilizers
Fertilizers made from plants  generally have low to moderate N-P-K values, 
but their nutrients quickly become available in the soil for your plants to use. 
Some of them provide an extra dose of trace minerals and micronutrients. 
If you don’t find plant-based fertilizers at the garden center, check out your 
local feed store. The most commonly available plant-based fertilizers include
 
 Alfalfa meal: Alfalfa meal is beneficial for adding nitrogen and potassium 
(about 2 percent each), as well as trace minerals and growth stimulants. 
Roses, in particular, seem to like this fertilizer and benefit from up to 5 
cups of alfalfa meal per plant every ten weeks, worked into the soil. Add 
it to your compost pile to speed up the process.
 
 Compost: Compost  is mostly beneficial for adding organic matter to 
the soil. It doesn’t add much in the way of fertilizer nutrients itself, but 
it does enhance and help make available any nutrients in the soil. (For 
more on compost, see the section “Composting: Turning Waste into 
Garden Gold,” earlier in this chapter.)
 
 Corn gluten meal: This powder contains 10 percent nitrogen fertilizer. 
Apply it only to actively growing plants because it inhibits seed germina-
tion. Use it on lawns in early spring to green up the grass and prevent 
annual weed seeds from sprouting.
 
 Cottonseed meal: This granular fertilizer is particularly good at supply-
ing nitrogen (6 percent) and potassium (1.5 percent). Look for organic 
cottonseed meal because traditional cotton crops are heavily sprayed 
with pesticides, some of which can remain in the seed oils.
 
 Kelp/seaweed: You can find this  product offered in liquid, powder, or 
pellet form. Although containing only small amounts of N-P-K fertilizer, 
kelp meal adds valuable micronutrients, growth hormones, and vitamins 
that can help increase yields, reduce the plant stress from drought, and 
increase frost tolerance. Apply it to the soil or as a foliar spray.
 
 Soybean meal: Used in pellet form, soybean meal is prized for its high 
nitrogen (7 percent) content and as a source of phosphorous (2 percent).
When looking  at organic fertilizer products, you’ll invariably come across 
those containing humus, humic acid, or humates — organic compounds often 
found in compost. These products have no fertilizer value, but rather are 
used as stimulants to support soil microbial life that, in turn, supports the 
plants. Use them as supplements,  not to replace proper soil building and 
nutrition.

Animal-based fertilizers
Animals, fish, and birds all provide organic fertilizers that can help plants 
grow. Most animal-based fertilizers provide a lot of nitrogen, which plants 
need for leafy growth. Here are some of the most commonly available ones:
 
 Manures: Animal manures provide a lot of organic matter to the soil, but 
most have  low nutrient value. A few, such as chicken manure, do have 
high available nitrogen content but should be used only composted 
because the fresh manure can burn the roots of tender seedlings.
 
 Bat/seabird guano: The poop from bats and seabirds, guano comes in 
powdered or pellet form and is actually high in nitrogen (10 to 12 per-
cent). Bat guano provides only about 2 percent phosphorous and no 
potassium, but seabird guano contains 10 to 12 percent P, plus 2 percent 
K. The concentrated nitrogen in these products can burn young plants 
if not used carefully. Use them to make manure tea, as described later in 
this section. They tend to be more expensive than land-animal manures.
 
 Blood meal: It’s a  bit gruesome, but blood meal is the powdered blood 
from slaughtered animals. It contains about 14 percent nitrogen and 
many micronutrients. Leafy, nitrogen-loving plants, such as lettuce, grow 
well with this fertilizer. It also reportedly repels deer, but may attract 
dogs and cats.
 
 Bone meal: A popular source  of phosphorous (11 percent) and calcium 
(22 percent), bone meal is derived from animal or fish bones and com-
monly used in a powdered form on root crops and bulbs. It also contains 
2 percent nitrogen and many micronutrients. It may attract rodents.
 
 Fish products: Fish  byproducts make excellent fertilizers. You can buy 
them in several different forms. Fish emulsion is derived from fermented 
remains of fish. This liquid product can have a fishy smell (even the 
deodorized version), but it’s a great complete fertilizer (5-2-2) and 
adds trace elements to the soil. When mixed with water, it’s gentle, 
yet effective for stimulating the growth of young seedlings. Hydrolyzed 
fish powder has higher nitrogen content (12 percent) and is mixed with 
water and sprayed on plants. Fish meal is high in nitrogen and phospho-
rus and is applied to the soil. Some products blend fish with seaweed or 
kelp for added nutrition and growth stimulation.
 
You can use  animal manures and compost to make liquid fertilizers called 
manure tea or compost tea. The nutrients in these teas are readily available 
for plant use; the teas are gentle enough to use on young plants or spray on 
the plant foliage to give them a quick boost.

484
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Here’s how to make manure or compost tea.
 
1. Place a shovelful of composted manure in a burlap or other porous 
cloth bag and secure the top.
 
2. Submerge the bag in about 10 to 15 gallons of water.
 
3. Let the liquid steep for one week or until the water takes on the color 
of brewed tea.
 
 Pour off the manure tea as needed.
 
4. Dilute the liquid until it resembles the color of weak brewed tea.
 
5. Use the diluted tea to water around plants.
 
 Dilute it some more to half-strength tea for young seedlings and as a fer-
tilizer spray.
Rock on with mineral-based fertilizers
Rocks decompose  slowly into soil, releasing minerals gradually over a period 
of years. Organic gardeners use many different minerals to increase the fertil-
ity of their soils, but it’s a long-term proposition. Some take months or years 
to fully break down into nutrient forms that plants can use, so one applica-
tion may last a long time.
Rock on with these fertilizers:
 
 Chilean nitrate of soda: Mined  in the deserts of Chile, this highly solu-
ble, fast-acting granular fertilizer contains 16 percent nitrogen. It’s also 
high in sodium, however, so don’t use it on arid soils where salt buildup 
is likely or on salt-sensitive plants.
 
 Epsom salt: Containing magnesium (10 percent) and sulfur (13 percent), 
Epsom salt is a fast-acting fertilizer that you can apply in a granular form 
or dissolve in water and spray on leaves as a foliar fertilizer. Tomatoes, 
peppers, and roses love this stuff! Mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom salt in a 
gallon of water and spray it on when plants start to bloom.
 
 Greensand: Mined in New Jersey from 70 million-year-old marine depos-
its, greensand  contains 3 percent potassium and many micronutrients. 
It’s sold in a powdered form but breaks down slowly.
 
 Gypsum: This powdered  mineral contains calcium (20 percent) and 
sulfur (15 percent). Use it to add calcium to soils without raising soil pH.
 
 Hard-rock phosphate: This mineral  powder contains 20 percent phos-
phorous and 48 percent calcium, which can raise soil pH — avoid it if 
your soil is already alkaline. It breaks down slowly, so use it to build the 
long-term supply of phosphorous in your soils.

485
 Chapter 2: Improving Your Soil and Feeding Your Plants Organically
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Soft-rock phosphate: Often  called colloidal phosphate, soft-rock phos-
phate contains less phosphorus (16 percent) and calcium (19 percent) 
than hard-rock phosphate, but the nutrients are in chemical forms that 
plants can use more easily. This powder breaks down slowly, so one appli-
cation may last for years in the soil. It also contains many micronutrients.
 
 Limestone: This  mined product has various nutrient levels, depending 
on its source. It’s used primarily to raise pH, but dolomitic limestone, is 
high in calcium (46 percent) and magnesium (38 percent). This powder 
also comes in an easier to spread granular form. Calcitic limestone is 
high in calcium carbonate (usually above 90 percent). Conduct a soil 
test for pH and for magnesium to find out which kind of lime and how 
much to add to your soil.
 
 Rock dusts: Mined from various rocks, these powders often contain few 
major nutrients but are loaded with micronutrients and other essential 
elements needed in small quantities by plants. Use them as supplements 
to regular soil building and fertility programs.
 
 Sul-Po-Mag: Also known  as K-Mag, this mineral source provides plants 
with readily accessible potassium (22 percent), magnesium (11 percent), 
and sulfur (22 percent). Use it to add magnesium to high pH soils with-
out raising the pH.
 
 Sulfur: This yellow  powder contains 90 percent elemental sulfur, which 
is used not only as a nutrient for plant growth, but also to lower the pH. 
Go easy on the application, however, because overuse can decrease soil 
microbe activity.

Controlling Weeds, Pests, 
and Disease
In This Chapter
 Battling weeds without harming the environment
 Organically addressing insect troubles
 Dealing with pesky garden invaders
 Staying safe when you use pesticides
 Preventing plant diseases
W
eeds, pests, and disease set a challenge for gardeners that the good 
health of their plants depends on. Weeds compete with your lawn and 
garden plants for food, water, and sun; they harbor injurious pests and diseases; 
and they run amok, making the yard look unkempt. Insects are a mixed bag; most 
of the insects in your garden and yard won’t harm your plants, but the ones 
that do cause damage accomplish more than their share to keep gardeners on 
their toes. And pests like rabbits and deer harvest your plants before you get a 
chance. Disease may prevent that harvest from even getting started.
This chapter introduces you to common garden invaders and shows you how 
to fend them off without doing damage to the environment — and how to 
make your garden unattractive to them in the first place.
Winning the Weed Wars
Weeding is not a favorite gardening activity — it’s just not glamorous. Most 
gardeners prefer almost any other chore to crawling around on their knees 
in the dirt and pulling weeds. A better approach is to prevent weeds from 
sprouting in the first place.
Use the techniques in the following sections to prevent and control weeds 
in your landscape and garden. Choose the methods that match your needs, 
whether you’re starting a new garden or maintaining an established planting.

488
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Mulch
Just like other plants, weeds and their seeds need air and light to grow, and if 
you deprive them of these crucial requirements, they will die or fail to sprout. 
One of the best ways to keep weeds in the dark is to put mulch over them. Mulch 
is anything that covers the soil for the purpose of preventing weeds, conserving 
moisture, or moderating the soil temperature. Many materials make good mulch: 
The ones you choose really depend on what’s locally available, how much you 
want to spend, the appearance factor, and where you plan to put it.
The best mulch materials for organic gardens and landscapes also feed the 
worms and add organic matter to the soil as they decompose. Usually, 2- to 
4-inch layers are sufficient to do the job, depending on the density of the 
material. Take a look at the following popular mulches and their uses:
 
 Tree bark: Bark is the ubiquitous landscape mulch. Available in 
shreds or various-sized chunks, bark lasts a long time, depending on the 
particle size, and gives your landscape a finished look. Be sure you’re 
buying real bark, however, by checking the bag label or asking the seller 
for the content. Wood chips that are dyed to look like bark are becoming 
prevalent in some areas.
 
 Wood chips, sawdust, and shavings: Although suitable for mulch, these 
products break down more quickly than bark and compete with your 
plants for nitrogen as they decompose. If you use these around food and 
landscape plants, be sure to add another nitrogen source.
 
 Never use materials from chemical- or pressure-treated wood, which 
contains pesticides that may cause cancer.
 
 Shredded leaves and pine needles: These items are among the best 
sources of free, attractive, and nutrient-rich mulch for flowerbeds, fruits, 
and vegetables. Be sure to shred leaves before using to prevent matting 
in the garden. In fact, I run over fallen leaves with the lawn mower, 
discharging them into easy-to-rake mounds.
 
 Pine needles and leaves of oak and some other trees acidify the soil. Use 
them freely around acid-loving plants, but monitor the soil pH around 
less tolerant plants. Some plants are sensitive to the chemicals in certain 
tree leaves. Cabbage-family plants, for example, don’t like oak leaves. 
Many plants are incompatible with walnut leaves.
 
 Seed hulls and crop residue: These attractive, locally available, light-
weight materials include cocoa bean, buckwheat hulls, ground corncobs, 
and other materials left over from processing an agricultural crop. Use on 
top of newspaper or other sheet mulch to increase suppression of weeds.

489
 Chapter 3: Controlling Weeds, Pests, and Disease
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Straw and hay: Be wary of these traditional vegetable garden and 
strawberry mulches. Hay contains weed seeds that add to your prob-
lems. Straw from grain crops, such as oats and wheat, may contain some 
crop seeds but is a better choice as weed-suppressing mulch. Allow the 
soil to warm up in spring before putting mulch around tomatoes and 
other heat-loving crops because straw keeps soil cool.
 
 Lawn clippings: Clippings cost nothing and work best in flower and 
vegetable gardens where they decompose quickly. Allow the clippings 
to dry on the lawn and then rake them up before using. Fresh clippings 
may mat down and become slimy as they decompose. If you’re getting 
clippings from a well-meaning friend, be sure the clippings don’t come 
from a chemically treated lawn.
 
 Newspaper and cardboard: Use cardboard or several layers of whole 
newspaper sheets in pathways or around landscape plants to smother 
weeds. (Avoid the colored glossy pages.) Cover with a thick layer of 
loose mulch, such as bark, shredded leaves, or straw. Depending on 
rainfall, you may have to replace newspaper during the growing season.
 
Some organic mulches can go sour if they get too wet and packed down and 
begin to decompose without sufficient air. If your mulch smells like vinegar, 
ammonia, sulfur, or silage, mix and aerate it with a garden fork. Don’t apply 
sour mulch around flowers, vegetables, fruits, or young shrubs and trees — 
its acidity can damage or even kill the plants. Cover unused mulch piles with 
a tarp to keep them dry.
No matter what kind of organic mulch you use, keep it away from direct 
contact with plant stems and trunks. Pull it several inches away from the 
plants to prevent moisture buildup around the trunks and to deter insects, 
slugs, rodents, and diseases. Be sure to loosen the mulch with a rake 
periodically to allow water to penetrate easily.
Some mulches don’t decompose but are useful in some situations:
 
 Gravel and stone are best for landscapes in fire-prone areas and 
around buildings where termites and carpenter ants pose problems. 
They don’t add significant nutrients to the soil, however, and usually 
need landscape fabric under them to prevent weeds. Avoid sand, which 
attracts cats, ants, and weed seeds.
 
 Landscape fabrics allow water to pass through but shade the ground 
and prevent weeds from coming up. They also prevent organic material 
from reaching the soil, however. While the fabric will last for a long time, 
it may need to be replaced at some point. Shallow-rooted plants, such as 
blueberries, grow roots into the landscape fabric, making it difficult to 
remove later. Use it around trees and shrubs or under decks where you 
don’t want weeds, but avoid using landscape fabrics in gardens.

490
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Plastic sheeting is useful mainly in rows because clear and colored plastics 
heat the soil, while white plastic keeps it cool. Don’t use plastic sheeting 
around landscape plants because it prevents water from reaching roots.
 
 IRT (infrared transmitting) plastic lets in the warming rays of the sun 
but blocks the rays that stimulate seed growth. SRM (selective reflective 
mulch) is a special red plastic that warms the soil, increases some crop 
yields, and may repel some pests but doesn’t prevent weeds as well as 
other plastics.
Solarization
One of the niftiest ways to beat the weeds is to solarize or use the heating 
power of the sun. The concept is simple: Capture the sun’s heat under a 
sheet of clear plastic and literally bake the weeds and waiting seeds to death.
 
Use solarization to clear existing plants from new gardens. (Clear plastic 
works best for this endeavor.) This technique takes several weeks in warm, 
sunny climates. If you garden in a cool, cloudy climate, try it during the 
warmest or sunniest times of year and allow up to eight weeks for the 
process to work.
Here’s how to solarize:
 
1. Mow closely or till the ground to remove as much of the existing 
vegetation as you can.
 
2. Dampen the soil.
 
 Moisture helps speed the process.
 
3. Spread a sheet of heavy-gauge clear plastic over the area.
 
 Stretch it tautly to keep it close to the ground.
 
4. Anchor with stones.
 
 Place a few stones or other weights on the plastic to keep it from 
blowing around and to hold it near the soil.
 
5. Seal the edge of the plastic to hold in the heat by covering it all the 
way around with soil or boards.
Avoid tilling the soil after solarization, or you may bring new seeds to the 
surface. If the soil gets hot enough, solarization also eliminates some 
soil-dwelling pests and diseases.

Cover cropping
Open ground is an open invitation for weed seeds to take root and for 
creeping plants to expand their territory. You can prevent and smother 
weeds, protect the soil from erosion, and enrich it at the same time by 
planting crops that you can till into the soil later. Thickly planted cover crops 
prevent weed seeds from sprouting and crowd out the ones that do. When 
the cover crop has done its job, you simply rotary till it into the soil, where it 
decomposes and adds organic matter.
Cover crops fall into two broad categories. Within each group, some live for a 
single season, and others are perennial, coming back year after year.
 
 Legumes: Plants that have the ability to convert nitrogen from the air 
into nitrogen in the soil are called legumes. These plants increase the 
fertility of the soil while they grow and add rich organic matter when 
rotary tilled under. Some of them, especially alfalfa, have deep roots 
that bring water and other nutrients to the surface. Legumes provide 
an excellent source of nectar for bees as well as habitat for numerous 
beneficial insects. Legumes for cover crops include several types of 
clover, hairy vetch, soybeans, and alfalfa.
 
 Grasses and buckwheat: These cover crops grow quickly, allowing 
you to till under some of them just a few weeks after planting; others 
can remain in place for months. Either way, they add large amounts of 
organic matter to the soil. Buckwheat flowers are also valuable for bee 
nectar. Other cover crops in this group include annual ryegrass, oats, 
winter rye, and sudangrass.
Cover crops can serve your garden needs in different ways, depending on 
your goals and time frame, but unlike some other weed-control measures, 
you do have to plan ahead when using them:
 
 New garden preparation: The year before you intend to plant a 
vegetable, fruits, or flower garden, turn over the soil and sow a thick 
cover crop. Depending on the crop used and on whether you have 
time, turn under the first cover crop and grow another before tilling the 
garden for food or flowers.
 
 Between gardening seasons: After you harvest the last of your 
vegetables and remove the crop residue from the garden, sow a cover 
crop for the winter. If you live in a cold-winter climate, choose a 
fast-growing grass and plant it at least several weeks before the ground 
freezes. Turn it under in the spring. In warmer climates, prevent the 
cover crop from going to seed. Otherwise, it may become a weed itself.
 
 During the garden season: Some cover crops, especially white clover, 
are useful as permanent ground covers in orchards and in the aisles 
between permanent planting beds. Clover encourages beneficial insects 
and adds nitrogen to the soil while preventing noxious weeds.

492
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Flaming
One of the latest and most effective weed killers to hit the market, propane-
fueled flamers make quick work of weeds. Instead of setting plants on fire, 
they have special nozzles that work by literally boiling the sap inside the 
plants and bursting their cells. The least expensive flamers cost little more 
than a high quality rake and are a worthwhile investment for large gardens, 
yards, and orchards. Expect to pay from $30 to more than $100 for a flamer 
hose, fittings, nozzle, and valves. They attach to any standard propane tank. 
The most expensive models allow the fuel tank to be worn as a backpack and 
include convenient squeeze-control valves.
For the most effective control, use your flamer when weeds are small. Large 
weeds and tough perennials may need repeat treatments. You can purchase 
flamers at farm- and garden-supply stores and mail-order companies.
 
Avoid using flamers in windy or dry conditions, especially if you live in an arid 
region. Keep a hose or other water source handy to douse unexpected flames.
Cultivating
Good old-fashioned hand-pulling and hoeing aren’t among gardeners’ favorite 
garden chores, but they work — especially if you follow these two basic rules:
 
 Disturb the soil as little as possible. This first rule is really important 
because many weed seeds lie dormant in the darkness just under the 
soil surface. When you churn up the soil, you expose them to the light 
and air that they need in order to sprout and attain pest status.
 
 Get them while they’re small. Little weeds with fragile roots and stems 
take little effort to destroy. Large weeds take more work, disrupt more 
soil, and potentially contribute to the seed population in your soil, if you 
leave them long enough. Also, the longer the weeds live, the more water 
and nutrients they rob from your food and landscape plants.
The most effective and all-around useful weeding tools disturb very little soil 
as they work. The best hoes for weeding have sharp blades that slice the 
plants just below the soil surface, as shown in Figure 3-1:
 
 Collinear hoe: The collinear hoe, designed by organic farmer Eliot 
Coleman, allows you to stand up straight as you weed.
 
 Stirrup hoe: I use the stirrup hoe frequently because it cuts both on the 
push and pull action.
 
 Swan neck hoe: The swan neck hoe gets into tight spots easily.

Smaller hand tools and those with shorter handles exist, too, and let you 
weed raised beds or weed from a sitting or kneeling position.
 
All weeding hoes need occasional touching up with a sharpening stone.
Organic herbicides
When all else fails, gardeners turn to herbicides to kill the weeds. Sound like 
blasphemy? Take a look at some organic weed control chemicals. As with any 
chemical treatment — organic or synthetic — use the most powerful ones 
only as a last resort.
Herbicides work in several different ways that depend on a particular plant 
life stage or characteristic to be effective:
 
 Sprouting seeds send out roots first and then the stem and first leaves. 
This vulnerable time is the best and easiest stage to knock them out. Pre-
emergent herbicides kill these tiny seedlings as they sprout and are espe-
cially useful on lawns and other places where mature weeds are difficult 
to remove. The timing of application is critical, however. If you put them 
on too early, they may wash away before they have a chance to work. 
Put them on too late, and the seedlings will be too big to be affected.

494
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 The most promising organic pre-emergence herbicide is corn glutenmeal, 
a highly concentrated corn protein extract. It can control weeds for up 
to 6 weeks, if applied in early spring and again in late summer, and, as 
a bonus, is high in nitrogen. Trade names of the product include Safe 
Lawn and WOW!.
 
 Plants have a waxy coating on their leaves, which prevents moisture 
loss. Herbicidal soap damages the waxy layer, allowing the plant to dry 
out and die. This type of herbicide works best on young, tender, actively 
growing weeds in hot, dry weather. Herbicidal soap is less effective on 
mature plants and perennial weeds. Safer’s Superfast Weed Killer is a 
commonly available product.
 
 Plants are sensitive to changes in pH. Some products use vinegar, which 
is acetic acid, or pelargonic acid, which is derived from fruit, as their 
active ingredient. These acids lower the plant’s pH dramatically, killing 
the sprayed plant parts in a matter of hours. For best results, remove 
as much of the plant top as you can before treating with the herbicide. 
Don’t use these products where you intend to grow plants again for 
a few months because they can sterilize the soil. One product that 
contains pelargonic acid is Scythe. Bradfield Natural Horticultural 
Vinegar is a product with 20 percent vinegar.
Managing Pests
Sharing your vegetables, flowers, trees, shrubs, and lawn with insects is a 
balancing act. On the one hand, you want a safe, attractive landscape and 
bountiful, pesticide-free harvest. On the other hand, armies of marauding 
insects and other pests may seem intent on destroying your dreams. What’s 
an organic gardener to do?
The answer is integrated pest management, called IPM for short. Success with IPM 
depends on careful and regular observation of your plants, the weather, soil con-
ditions, and other factors that influence plant and insect growth. You also have 
to get very familiar with each important pest. Here’s what you need to know:
 
 Pest identification: You have to know exactly which insect(s) you’re 
dealing with. Capture a few in a jar to get a good look at them. Use a 
magnifying lens for small pests. Ask your local extension office for a 
color guide to common pests and their symptoms for your particular 
crop or ornamental plants. Extension entomologists (people who study 
insects) can also identify pests for you.
 
 Understand the pest: Learn as much as possible about when the pest 
appears, on which plants, what factors contribute to its abundance, 
what kind of damage it does, at what life stage it is easiest to control, 
where it lives when it’s not on your plants, and what controls it naturally 
(beneficial insects or disease, for example).

495

 Population size: Knowing whether you have just a few aphids or a cast of 
thousands makes a difference in how you deal with them. After you spot a 
particular pest or symptoms of its damage, examine as many similar plants 
in your garden as you can to determine the extent of the population and its 
distribution. Traps can help you evaluate the population of some pests.
Deciding whether to control 
the pest or let it be
After you identify and profile a pest, you have a choice about how to control 
it — and whether to control it at all. Consider the following factors when 
making your decision:
 
 Crop value: Are you looking at a small planting of annual zinnias or your 
family’s strawberry patch? Obviously, a valuable fruit crop warrants 
more intervention than an easily replaced ornamental.
 
 Extent of the damage: Is the pest confined to a single plant, to the one 
end of one row, or to the entire crop? Is the damage mostly cosmetic, 
will you lose a significant percent of the harvest, or will the tree’s or 
shrub’s health be significantly reduced?
 
 Your tolerance threshold: Can your family live with blemished apples, 
using them for sauce and cider? Or do you plan to sell them for fresh 
eating at a roadside stand? Are your roses going to be entered in a 
contest, or will they simply grace your own house and garden?
 
You have many control methods from which to choose. Organic gardeners 
choose the least invasive and least toxic methods first and graduate to harsher 
steps as necessary.
Making the garden less inviting to pests
Your garden may be unintentionally rolling out the red carpet for insect 
pests. Bugs are opportunists that take advantage of weak or stressed plants. 
They also take up residence where the eating is easy. Keep pests at bay with 
the following prevention strategies:
 
 Give plants the advantage. Choose the right location for each plant, 
taking into account its particular needs for water, sunlight, and nutrients. 
When plants don’t get their needs met, they become stressed, and the 
longer the stressful situation continues, the greater the decline in plant 
health. Think of insects as opportunists waiting for a weakened plant 
host to hang out the welcome mat. Of course, even a healthy plant can 
fall prey to insects and diseases, but it will be better able to survive the 
attack than will a plant that’s already weakened.

496
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Damaged bark or leaves are ideal entryways for insects and diseases. 
You can’t lessen the ravages of weather, but you can protect plants from 
mechanical damage from lawn mowers, trimmers, and rotary tillers. 
Encircle trees, shrubs, and perennial beds with a wide band of mulch to 
keep equipment away from plants.
 
 Confuse insects by mixing plants. Insects have chemical receptors 
that help them zero in on their favorite foods. If you mix different types 
of plants instead of planting each type in large blocks, insects have a 
harder time finding all of them. Plant smaller patches of each crop and 
scatter them throughout the garden or yard.
 
 Keep time on your side. Young plants, with their tender, succulent stems, 
are easy prey for pests. As plants grow and become more vigorous, their 
tissues become more fibrous and less prone to damage. Plant a crop so 
that it’s growing strong by the time its predominant pest insect hatches. 
In some northern regions, for example, early plantings of corn can protect 
against corn earworm and fall armyworm, which migrate from the south 
and arrive in the north later in the season. You can also time your plantings 
for a couple of weeks after the pest eggs hatch so that the young larvae 
will die from lack of food before your plants are up and growing. Talk to 
local growers and your local extension office about pest emergence 
predictions and recommended planting times.
 
 Rotate crops. Moving each vegetable crop family (the Solanaceae family, 
for example, includes tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, and potatoes) to 
a new location in the garden every year can help foil pests. At the end 
of the season, many insects leave eggs or pupae in the soil near their 
favorite host plants. If the young emerge in the spring looking for food 
and find their favorite crop is nearby again, they’ll have a feeding frenzy. 
If, on the other hand, their food is on the other side of the garden, they 
may starve before they find it. Use this technique especially with annual 
flowers and vegetables that you replant each year.
 
 Don’t overdo a good thing. An excess of nutrients is as harmful to 
plants as nutrient deficiency. In fact, excess nitrogen causes stems and 
leaves to grow rapidly and produce juicy growth that’s a delicacy for 
aphids and spider mites because it’s easy to puncture and consume. 
Aphids, as well as other pests, also are attracted to high levels of amino 
acids in plants, which can be caused by too much nitrogen in the soil. 
Similarly, an imbalance of phosphorus encourages egg production in 
spider mites. The easiest way to avoid nutrient imbalances is to provide 
nutrients in the form of organic matter and organic fertilizers, which 
make nutrients available gradually.

Encouraging beneficial insects 
and other predators
The average square yard of garden contains over a thousand insects. For the 
most part, that’s a good thing. Some pollinate plants, some help break down 
organic matter, and some prey on other more damaging pests. Most of the 
insects in your gardens help — not hurt — your plants. Only a small fraction 
cause much damage.
The following sections help you sort out the predators from the pests and give 
you tips for keeping the good bugs where you want them — in your garden.
Identifying the good guys
Those insects that prey on, or parasitize, insect pests are called beneficial 
insects. You rely on these allies to help keep the insect balance from tipping 
too far in the destructive direction. If you familiarize yourself with these good 
guys, you can encourage their presence in the garden and avoid killing these 
innocent bystanders just because they happen to be the insects you spy on 
your favorite dahlias.
 
You can buy many of these beneficial insects from mail-order catalogs to 
increase your local populations.
The following are some beneficial insects worth befriending:
 
 Beneficial nematodes: These microscopic, worm-like creatures live in 
the soil and are effective against the scourge of many gardens: Japanese 
beetles. Nematodes prey on the grubs, the larval stage of the beetle, 
as well as on armyworms, cutworms, onion maggots, raspberry cane 
borers, and sod webworms. Mix nematodes (available by mail order) 
with water and apply them to your lawn and garden soil. According to 
Ohio State University, beneficial nematodes are most effective in moist 
soil and at soil temperatures between 60°F and 90°F. They can be killed 
by exposure to the sun, so they’re best applied in early evening or on 
cloudy or rainy days when the soil temperature is at least 55°F.
 
 Big-eyed bug: These fast-moving, 
1⁄8- to 
1⁄4-inch bugs have tiny black 
spots on their heads and the middle part of their bodies, as shown in 
Figure 3-2. They resemble the pesky tarnished plant bugs, which are 
a favorite food of the big-eyes. They also dine on aphids, leafhoppers, 
spider mites, and some small caterpillars. Because these bugs aren’t 
commercially available, look for them on nearby weeds, such as 
goldenrod or pigweed, and relocate them to your garden.

 Braconid wasps: Several species of braconid wasps, shown in Figure 3-3, 
parasitize pest insects. Both the slender adults and tiny, cream-colored 
grubs feed on a range of pests, including aphids, cabbageworms, codling 
moths, and corn borers. Purchase these 
1⁄10- to 
1⁄2-inch wasps from suppliers 
and plant some parsley-family flowers to help keep them around. Adults 
require carbohydrate food, such as the honeydew secreted by aphids, 
tree sap ooze, or flower nectar.
 
Figure 3-3:

 Centipedes: Indoors and out, multilegged centipedes feed on many 
insect pests. Most species don’t bother humans, and while some 
southwestern species inflict a temporarily painful bite, none are 
dangerous. You can’t do much to encourage their presence, but if you 
leave them alone to do their job, you’ll have fewer insects.
 
 Damsel bugs: These slender, 
3⁄8- to 
1⁄2-inch bugs have strong-looking front 
legs, and they prey upon aphids, caterpillars, leafhoppers, and thrips. 
They’re common in unsprayed alfalfa fields, where you can collect them 
in a net and relocate them to your yard. Plant flowers in the sunflower 
family, goldenrod, or yarrow to keep them around.

 Ground beetles: Many beetle species live in or on the soil where both their 
larval and adult stages capture and eat harmful insects. They vary in color — 
black, green, bronze — and in size. Most live close to the ground, feeding on 
aphids, caterpillars, fruit flies, mites, and slugs; the 1-inch-long caterpillar 
hunter climbs trees to feed on gypsy moths and other tree-dwelling 
caterpillars. Because these beetles aren’t available commercially, the best 
thing you can do to encourage their presence is avoid using herbicides and 
insecticides and learn to distinguish them from other unwanted insects. 
Ground beetles bear an unfortunate likeness to cockroaches, but the latter 
have longer antennae and a different overall shape. Most of the helpful 
ground beetles are large, dark, and fast moving. They often have nasty-
looking mandibles and eyes on or near the fronts of their heads.
 
 Hover flies: Also known as flower flies or syrphid flies, hover flies got 
their most common name from the adults’ habit of hovering around 
flowers. The adults, resembling yellow jackets, are important pollinators, 
while the brownish or greenish caterpillar-like larvae have an appetite 
for aphids, beetles, caterpillars, sawflies, and thrips. If you grow an 
abundance of flowers, you’re likely to see hover flies.
 
 Ichneumonid wasps: Ichneumonid wasps are a valuable ally in controlling 
many caterpillars and other destructive larvae. The dark-colored adult 
wasps (see Figure 3-4) vary in size from less than 1 inch to 1½ inches, 
and they have long antennae and long egg-laying appendages — called 
ovipositors — that are easily mistaken for stingers. The adults need a 
steady source of nectar-bearing flowers to survive.

 Lacewings: The delicate, green or brown bodies and transparent wings 
of these ½- to -¾-inch insects, shown in Figure 3-5, are easily recognized in 
the garden. Adults live on nectar, while the spindle-shaped, alligator-like, 
yellowish or brownish larvae feed on a wide variety of soft-bodied pests, 
such as aphids, scale, thrips, caterpillars, and spider mites. The distinc-
tive, pale green oval eggs each sit at the end of its own long, thin stalk 

500
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
on the undersides of leaves. You can purchase lacewings as eggs, larvae, 
and adults. To keep the welcome mat out for the adults, allow some 
weeds to flower nearby.

but have

 Lady beetles: You may be surprised to learn that not all lady beetles 
(also called ladybugs) are beneficial — the damaging Mexican bean 
beetle is a type of lady beetle! The convergent lady beetle, however, 
is what most people think of when they praise lady beetles’ appetite 
for aphids. (This species is distinguished from her pest cousin by two 
converging white lines on its thorax — the segment between the head 
and the abdomen. The number of spots varies widely.) Both adults and 
larvae prey on soft-bodied pests, including mealybugs and spider mites. 
The convergent lady beetle larvae look like small black, segmented 
pillbugs with rows of knobby or hairy projections and four orange spots 
on their backs. Although lady beetles are commonly purchased and 
released into the garden, they often do like the song says and “Fly away 
home.” You can help keep them around by setting out another food 
source, such as an artificial yeast/sugar or honeydew mixture, which is 
commercially available from lady beetle suppliers.
 
 Minute pirate bug: These bugs, which are available for purchase, have 
an appetite for soft-bodied insects, such as thrips, corn earworms, 
aphids, and spider mites. A single bug can consume 30 or more spider 
mites a day! The adults are 
1⁄4-inch long, somewhat oval-shaped, and 
black with white wing patches. The fast-moving, immature nymphs are 
yellow-orange to brown in color and teardrop-shaped.
 
 Predatory mites: Similar in appearance to pest mites, such as the two-
spotted spider mite, predatory mites are tiny (smaller than 
1⁄2 inch) and 
quick. They feed primarily on thrips and pest mites and are widely used 
to control these insects in commercial orchards and vineyards. They’re 
available to home gardeners, too.
 
 Rove beetles: These beetles, which resemble earwigs without pincers, 
have the distinctive habit of pointing their abdomens upward as they 
walk. Decaying organic matter is their home, where they feed on soil-
dwelling insects, such as root maggot eggs, larvae, and pupae, especially 

501
 Chapter 3: Controlling Weeds, Pests, and Disease
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
those of the cabbage and onion maggots. In mild, wet climates, they also 
eat slug and snail eggs.
 
 Soldier beetles: The favorite diet of both adults and larvae of these 
common beetles consists of aphids, caterpillars, corn rootworms, 
cucumber beetles, and grasshopper eggs. The adults, shown in Figure 3-6, 
are slender, flattened, 
1⁄3- to 
1⁄2-inch long. The larvae have the same shape 
and are covered with hairs. They spend much of their life cycle in the soil, 
so they’re more prevalent in areas where the soil is undisturbed.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Soldier 
beetles live 
in the soil 
where they

lars and

larvae.
 
 
 Spiders: All spiders are predators, ridding the garden of many common 
pests. You can provide a good habitat for spiders by mulching with hay 
and straw, which has been found to reduce insect damage by 70 percent 
due solely to the numbers of resident spiders. Just make sure that you 
use old hay: Fresh bales tend to contain a whole lotta weed seeds.
 
 Spined soldier bugs: Adult spined soldier bugs dine on the larvae of 
Colorado potato beetles, Mexican bean beetles, and sawflies, as well 
as European corn borers, cabbage loopers, and tent caterpillars. The 
adults, shown in Figure 3-7, resemble tan, shield-shaped stinkbugs with 
prominent spurs on their shoulders immediately behind the head. They 
pierce their victims with a harpoon-like mouth. You can purchase them 
for release in your garden.

Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Tachinid flies: These large flies feed on tent caterpillars, armyworms, 
corn borers, cutworms, stinkbugs, and other pests. The adult fly is 
about the size of a housefly and may hover above squash plants in 
search of prey. It has a bright orange abdomen, black head and thorax, 
and a fringe of short black hairs on its hind legs. Coriander, coyote 
brush, evergreen euonymus, fennel, goldenrod, and white sweet clover 
attract these flies to your yard.
 
 Tiger beetles: A variety of brightly colored and patterned 
1⁄2- to 
3⁄4-inch 
beetles fall into this group, and they all have distinctively long legs. 
Some have shiny metallic green bodies and run fast when disturbed. 
They feed on a wide range of soil-dwelling larvae. If you use an electric 
bug zapper light, you’re inadvertently killing these garden allies.
 
 Trichogramma wasps: Tiny as a pencil point, these parasitic wasps 
inject their eggs inside the eggs of more than 200 species of moths, such 
as cabbageworms, codling moths, corn earworms, and cutworms. Their 
developing larvae consume the host. Buy these wasps commercially and 
release them during their hosts’ peak egg-laying times. Suppliers can 
give you more specific directions on release times.
 
 Yellow jackets: It’s hard to think of these annoying insects as beneficial, 
but they do help rid your garden of flies, caterpillars, grasshoppers, 
and many larvae by taking them home to their young. Yellow jackets 
are fond of white sweet clover and ivy, so expect to see them near your 
house if you have either nearby.
Attracting beneficial insects
You can take important steps to welcome beneficial insects to your yard and 
encourage those you purchase to stick around. To keep the good guys from 
flying the coop, try these tips:
 
 Wait to release beneficial insects until you’ve seen their favorite prey 
in the garden. If beneficial insects don’t find any food in your garden, 
they move elsewhere. You can even purchase food for lady beetles 
(from the companies that sell the beetles) to encourage them to stay 
even after aphid populations decline.
 
 Grow some plants that attract beneficial insects. With a constant supply 
of nectar, adult beneficial insects can live much longer than they would 
without it. Shallow-throated flowers are easier for many of the tiny 
beneficial insects to feed from than deep-throated flowers. Goldenrod is 
a favorite, attracting more than 75 different species of beneficial insects. 
Include this and other plants from the parsley and sunflower families, 
such as artemesia, aster, coriander, cumin, daisy, dill, Florence fennel, 
gazania, goldenrod, marigold, alyssum, sunflower, yarrow, and zinnia.
 
 Include a diversity of plants in your yard to attract a diversity of 
insects. Plant different species, including evergreens, and plants of 
different sizes and shapes. A mixture of trees, shrubs, perennials, and 
annuals in the yard provides lots of options for food and hiding places.

503
 Chapter 3: Controlling Weeds, Pests, and Disease
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides, which kill a wide range of 
insects, including beneficial ones. Even some organic insecticides, such 
as pyrethrin and rotenone, are toxic to beneficial insects. Often, these 
insects are even more susceptible to the insecticide than pests because, 
as predators and parasites, they must move quickly over leaf surfaces 
and thus they come into contact with insecticides more readily. Many 
insecticides are also toxic to bees. If you must use a chemical as a last 
resort, spray only in the evening when bees have returned to the hive.
 
 Provide a water source for beneficial insects by filling a shallow 
birdbath or bowl with stones and water and placing it near the 
garden. Change the water frequently to discourage breeding mosquitoes.
Attracting other insect predators
Many creatures depend on insects for food, and you can enlist them in your 
pest-control efforts. Birds, bats, frogs, toads, lizards, and even small mammals 
can eat surprisingly large numbers of insects. Offer them the habitat they 
enjoy and let them get to work.
Keep in mind the following points:
 
 Bats are beneficial, too. Bats are often underappreciated. Their steady 
diet of insects — beetles, moths, and, of course, mosquitoes — makes 
them worth a gardener’s tolerance. Some gardeners put up bat houses 
to help keep bats nearby. Bat houses look like birdhouses with entrance 
slots in the bottom and are available at many garden-supply outlets.
 
 Welcome your fine, feathered friends: Granted, birds do snare valuable, 
soil-enriching earthworms, but they also consume huge numbers of 
insects. A house wren, for example, can gobble more than 500 beetles, 
grubs, and insect eggs in an afternoon. Welcome birds to your yard 
by providing food, such as fruiting trees and shrubs, bird seed, suet, 
water from bird baths, and shelter that includes a diversity of trees and 
shrubs, including evergreens. Put up birdhouses to encourage your 
favorite feathered friends to raise their families nearby.
 
 Tolerate toads and lizards: If you’re lucky enough to have a resident toad 
in the garden, consider him an ally. He’ll consume up to 100 insects — cut-
worms, grasshoppers, grubs, slugs — every night during the gardening 
season. He may even hang around for years if you make your yard hospi-
table. Toads lay their eggs in water, so a water garden or pond will ensure 
future generations. You can easily provide drinking water by setting a low 
dish or birdbath on the ground near some tall plants that offer shelter.
Practicing good outdoor housekeeping
Getting rid of insects can be as simple as handpicking or even vacuuming 
them. Incorporate these easy techniques into a stroll around your yard:

504
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Handpick insects: When you go out to tend your plants, take along a 
can of soapy water — the future final resting-place for any Japanese 
beetle you encounter. In the early morning, beetles are sluggish and can 
be easily picked or knocked off your plants into a can. You can make 
this habit an after-dinner routine as well, when the beetles have slowed 
down and settled in for the night.
 
 Use this technique on many other insects, as well. As an alternative to 
the catch can, spread plastic under plants and shake them to dislodge 
insects. Then pour the insects from the plastic into a pail of soapy water.
 
 Tiny insects are difficult to pick off, but a little judicious pruning can 
remove masses of them. Aphids tend to cluster near flower buds and 
growing tips, so cutting off those portions will help reduce the population 
and control damage spread. Pick off leaves that have leaf miners and other 
insects and remove portions of branches infested with tent caterpillars.
 
 Vacuum the leaves: You can use your hand vac to bust more than dust. 
Pest insects tend to congregate on the upper portions of plants, while 
beneficial ones frequently hide on the lower leaves and branches. You can 
use these tendencies to your advantage by vacuuming the upper leaves 
with a low-suction vacuum (you don’t want to lose the leaves, too) when-
ever you see pests accumulating. Afterward, dispose of the vacuum bag in 
a sealed bag or covered container so that insects can’t crawl back out.
 
 Give plants a brisk shower: You can deter many an aphid and spider 
mite (and other crawling insects) from feeding on your plants with a 
strong blast from the garden hose. Simply knocking the insects off onto 
the ground can greatly reduce their damage, especially if you spray 
plants every day or two, before the insects have time to make the 
journey back up. Avoid spraying leaves in the evening because wet 
foliage at night can encourage disease organisms to spread.
 
 Clean up debris: Fallen leaves, dropped fruit, and other debris can harbor 
insects, so at season’s end, pick up and destroy fallen fruit and till plant 
residues into the soil or add them to your compost pile. Burn diseased 
plants, dispose of them in trash bags, or add to a compost pile that 
reaches 160°F degrees. Even if you compost your spent plants, cultivate 
the soil to work in any debris that can shelter insects through the winter. 
Cultivating also exposes pests to cold temperatures and predators.
Outwitting Critters
A discussion of garden pests wouldn’t be complete without considering the 
animals that may plague your gardens — birds, deer, rabbits, ground hogs, 
gophers, and moles. While insect feeding is subtler and causes incremental 
damage over time, some of these larger critters can eliminate an entire 
plant — or row of plants — almost right before your eyes. You can, how-
ever, keep damage to a minimum by getting to know their habits:

505
 Chapter 3: Controlling Weeds, Pests, and Disease
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Birds: Birds in the yard are a mixed blessing. You appreciate their 
appetite for insects, but when they nibble on the tomatoes and devour 
the ripe blueberries, they cross the line into nuisance territory. You can 
keep birds away from your plants by draping bird netting or row covers 
over them, but this practice isn’t always practical.
 
 Fortunately, birds can be startled by noise, fluttering objects, and, of 
course, anything resembling a predator. Try bordering your garden with 
string tied to stakes and fastening aluminum pie plates or unwanted CD 
disks to the string. The noise and flashing of the sun on the shiny surfaces 
can scare birds away. Or instead of string, use only a thin nylon line, 
which will vibrate and hum in the breeze. You can even use the modern 
version of the scarecrow — balloons and kites with images of predators, 
such as owls and hawks. Place them in the garden to convince birds that 
their enemy is on guard. Birds catch on quickly, though, so change your 
scare tactics regularly.
 
 Deer: Deer tend to travel the same routes day after day. If your yard is 
in the path of their customary travels from sleeping quarters to a water 
source, you’ll be spending some evenings discussing deer-repellent 
strategies. Deer do, however, have some quirky tendencies that 
gardeners can use to their favor. Try some of the following remedies:
 
• Fencing: Deer have been known to jump a 10-foot fence, but 
apparently, they’re intimidated about jumping when they can’t tell 
how much distance they have to clear. Deer are less likely to jump 
a fence over a narrow, long garden than a fence that surrounds a 
large, wide garden. The two long sides appear too close together 
for the deer to see a place to land. You can create the same 
illusion by installing a fence so that it slants outward away from 
the garden. This technique can intimidate the deer by making the 
fence appear wider than it really is. You can even make a 5-foot-fence 
more deer proof by using taller posts and attaching strands of wire 
above the fence.
 
 If all else fails, you may need to resort to low-voltage electric 
fencing. Bait the strands of wire with peanut butter to encourage 
the deer to take a taste and get the message.
 
• Row covers: In early spring, spread fabric row covers over tender 
new growth, supporting the covers with wire cages or hoops, if nec-
essary. This trick can deter the deer long enough to give your plants 
a head start and allow time for wild food plants to become plentiful.
 
• Repellents: Hang bars of soap from low tree branches or from 
stakes so that the bars are about 30 inches off the ground. Tallow-
based soaps work best. Or spray plants with hot pepper solutions 
made from Tabasco pepper sauce or another hot sauce mixed 
with water and a little insecticidal soap or nonsudsing dishwasher 
detergent (to help the spray stick to the foliage). Another spray 
worth trying consists of three raw eggs in one gallon of water, 
which apparently smells worse to the deer than it does to you.

506
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 You can purchase repellent sprays, such as Hinder, Deer-Away, 
Repellex, and Tree Guard, to spray on foliage. For best results, 
spray plants before the deer develop their feeding habits. You 
need to reapply most sprays after heavy rain. Avoid spraying fruit 
and vegetables — you don’t want to eat the stuff yourself. Follow 
label instructions on commercial repellents carefully.
 
 Rabbits: Rabbits are homebodies. They tend to stake out a territory of 
10 acres or less and not wander elsewhere. They make their homes in 
natural cavities in trees, other animals’ abandoned burrows, brush piles, 
and under buildings. They nibble foliage of almost any plant, returning 
again and again — day and night — to finish off the job. Here are some 
techniques to foil their feeding:
 
• Fencing: The best way to keep rabbits away from your plants is 
to fence them out. Because they burrow, a fence must also extend 
underground. Choose a 4-foot-high chicken wire fence with 1-inch 
mesh. Bury the bottom foot of the fence, bending the lowest 6 
inches into a right angle facing outward.
 
• Repellents: Try repelling rabbits with hair gathered from hair salons 
and dog groomers. Sprinkle it around the boundary of your garden 
and replenish it every few weeks. You can also purchase commercial 
repellents made to spray on the ground or directly on plants.
 
 Groundhogs: These slow-moving rodents, also called woodchucks, live 
in an extensive system of underground dens and tunnels, and they defy 
you to find all their tunnel entrances. A tunnel can extend nearly 70 feet. 
Groundhogs generally stay within about 100 feet of their dens, venturing 
out to find food — your tender veggies — usually in the morning and 
evening. To deter them, try
 
• Fencing: Groundhogs can climb up almost as well as they can dig 
down, so use a sturdy 4- or 5-foot fence and bury the bottom 18 
inches underground. Bend the top of the fence outward so that the 
groundhog will fall over backward if it attempts to climb over.
 
• Repellents: Spray plants with hot pepper solutions, such as the 
one recommended in the Deer listing, earlier in this list.
 
• Traps: You can use a Havahart trap to capture a live groundhog 
and then release it into the wild. Be sure to check with local and 
state ordinances about restrictions on live trapping and releasing 
of wild animals.
 
 Gophers: These burrowing rodents live in underground tunnel systems 
extending as far as 200 yards. They feast underground on plant roots 
and bulbs, occasionally emerging to eat aboveground parts of those 
plants located near the tunnel openings.
 
 You can plant gopher spurge (Euphorbia lathyrus), a natural repellent, as a 
protective border around the garden. Castor oil sprayed on the garden also 
repels them. Vibrating devices, such as large whirligigs, stuck in the ground 
near tunnels can send them packing. If gophers are a serious problem, you 

507
 Chapter 3: Controlling Weeds, Pests, and Disease
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
may want to go to the trouble of lining the sides and bottom of your 
garden (at a depth of 2 feet) with hardware cloth to keep the gophers out. 
Gopher-resistant wire baskets, which you can place in planting holes prior 
to planting, are commercially available. For persistent problems, use traps.
 
 Mice: Mice cause the most damage to plants in the wintertime, when 
food is scarce and the bark of your favorite tree makes an easy meal. 
Even during the summer, if you have a thick layer of mulch surrounding 
the tree right up to the trunk, a mouse can hide in the mulch and feed 
undetected. To guard against this problem, leave a space of several 
inches between the trunk and the mulch to deter feeding. During winter, 
the snow cover provides a similar hiding place, so wrapping the trunk 
with a tree guard made of wire or plastic provides the best protection.
 
 Moles: These critters are the innocent bystanders or innocent burrowers 
of the garden pest realm. They simply love to burrow in search of grubs, 
earthworms, and other insects. In the process, they inadvertently expose 
plant roots to air or push the plants out of the ground, both of which kill 
plants. Field mice or voles also use the mole tunnels to reach plant roots 
and flower bulbs, which they eat. Traps are the most reliable method for 
getting rid of moles. Use them in the spring or fall, when moles are busiest, 
and make sure that you place them directly into a runway.
 
 Cats: Roaming cats enjoy loose soil and mulch and frequently use 
gardens and landscaped areas as litter boxes. Laying rough-textured 
or chunky bark mulch or ornamental rocks on the soil may repel them 
because these materials are uncomfortable to soft paws. You can also 
lay chicken wire on the soil and cover it with mulch. Cats also don’t like 
the smell of dog hair or anise oil, so try spreading these items on the 
soil. Shredded lemon or grapefruit peels also deter cats. Look for a 
commercial product, such as Bad Cat, that contains citrus oils.
Running Down Pesticide Types
An insecticide is any pesticide used to kill insects. Some are nontoxic to all 
but the intended pest, while others affect any insect that comes in contact 
with it. Insecticides that kill a wide range of insects are called broad-spectrum 
insecticides, and they should be used only as last resort because they kill 
beneficial insects as well as the harmful ones.
The easiest way to classify all the different kinds of pesticides is to put them into 
groups based on how they work and, to some extent, where they come from. 
Organic pesticides come from plants, animals, minerals, and microorganisms, 
such as bacteria and fungi. Each of these pesticide groups — and individual 
products — kills pests in different ways. Some are more effective against insect 
larvae; others affect adults, for example. To get the best result from any product, 
you have to know as much as you can about the pest you hope to control: its life 
cycle, where it lives and at what times of the year, and when it’s most vulnerable.

508
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
Many people mistakenly believe that organic and nontoxic mean the same 
thing. Organic simply means that the product came from naturally occurring 
sources, such as plants, animals, and soil minerals. But some organic 
pesticides — nicotine, for example — are highly toxic and every bit as 
dangerous to humans and other animals as they are to insect pests. Whether 
you grow plants organically or not, avoid the most toxic pesticides whenever 
possible.
Dust to dust
Insects don’t have skeletons and skins like animals. Instead, a waxy cuticle 
covers their bodies, holding in moisture. Some insects have hard plates 
covering some of their body parts; others have almost entirely soft bodies. 
Dusts work by disrupting the waxy cuticle, which causes the insects to dry 
out and die. Unfortunately, these dusts harm beneficial insects, too. Although 
they’re not toxic to humans, use the following dusts with caution to avoid 
harming the innocent bystanders of the bug world.
 
 Diatomaceous earth: Called DE for short, this well-known and widely used 
white powder consists of the fossil remains of microscopic water creatures, 
called diatoms, and is mined from areas where ancient oceans or lakes once 
existed. DE resembles microscopic shards of broken glass, which pierce the 
soft bodies of insects, slugs, and snails. DE kills beneficial as well as harmful 
insects, so it may not be the best choice in all situations. Some DE products 
contain nontoxic bait that attracts pests and induces them to eat the dust, 
which is also fatal.
 
 Iron phosphate: This mineral product, when mixed with bait, attracts 
and kills slugs and snails. You apply it to the soil in pellets and, although 
it won’t hurt people or animals, it interferes with calcium metabolism in 
slugs, causing them to stop eating and die within days.
 
 Boric acid: For cockroaches, ants, and silverfish, look for boric acid 
powder. If kept dry, the powder remains effective for years without 
harming animals, people, or the environment.
 
The pesticides in the preceding list are very low in toxicity, but you still need 
to use them judiciously and keep them out of reach of children.
Watching the soaps and 
other oily characters
Insects breathe through pores in the cuticle that surrounds their bodies. If you 
plug up the pores, the insects suffocate and die. That’s where horticultural 
oils enter the picture. Disrupt the cuticle with special soaps and poof! — the 
insects can’t maintain their internal moisture. Soaps and oils kill a wide range 

509
 Chapter 3: Controlling Weeds, Pests, and Disease
Book VI

of pest insects, but affect beneficial insects, too. Use them with caution to 
avoid harming beneficial insects.
 
 Horticultural oils: These oils are made from refined mineral or vegetable 
oils. Although oils effectively kill any insect that they cover, including 
eggs, larvae, pupae and adults, they don’t differentiate between good and 
bad bugs.
 
 Use horticultural oils in the winter to suffocate over-wintering pests, 
such as aphids, mites, and scales, on dormant fruit and ornamental trees 
and shrubs. During the growing season, horticultural oils work against 
aphids, mites, lace bugs, corn earworms, mealybugs, leafminers, scale, 
and many others.
 
 Citrus oils: The oils from the skin of citrus fruits kill a broad range of insects 
on contact by poisoning them. The oils continue to repel pests, such as 
fleas, ants, and silverfish, for weeks and are safe around people and pets. 
The active ingredient — chemical that does the damage — is d-Limonene. 
Look for it on the label or try the commercial product Orange Guard.
 
 Plant extracts: Many herbs, spices, and plants, including tansy, nastur-
tium, garlic, onions, marigolds, rue, mint, rosemary, sage, and geranium, 
contain chemicals that repel or kill insects. Garlic is one of the most 
well-known and effective extracts against thrips and other leaf-eating 
insects: The strong odor disguises the true identity of the host plant, so 
pests pass them by. Look for the commercial product Garlic Barrier.
 
 Insecticidal soaps: The active ingredient in insecticidal soap, called 
potassium salts of fatty acids, penetrates and disrupts the cuticle that 
holds moisture inside insects’ bodies, causing soft-bodied pests like 
aphids to dry out and die. Some pests, however, especially beetles 
with hard bodies, remain unaffected. To make soaps more effective, 
products such as Safer’s Yard & Garden Insect Killer, combine soap 
with pyrethrins, a botanical insecticide that’s covered in the “Becoming 
botanically correct” section, later in this chapter.
Getting small with microbes
Everybody gets sick at one time or another — and that includes bugs. You 
can help them along the path to their destruction with a variety of infectious 
microorganisms or microbes that target specific pests. The beauty of these 
disease-causing microbes is that they’re completely harmless to most 
beneficial insects, humans, and other animals. Microbes take time to work 
but often remain active in the environment long after you apply them.
 
 Bacteria: Several insect-infecting bacteria, or Bacillus species, that exist 
naturally in most soils have become important tools in the battle against 
damaging caterpillars, beetles, and other pesky bugs. In the 1960s, 
scientists began using the bacteria Bacillus popilliae, also called milky 

510
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
spore disease, to control the Japanese beetle and other closely related 
beetles. The disease affects the soil-dwelling larvae or grubs. After the 
grubs eat the bacteria, they become ill and stop feeding, dying within 
days. They often darken in color when infected. When the insects die, 
the disease organism spreads in the soil where it can infect others.
 
 It takes several years for the bacteria to spread and achieve good 
control, however, and it is less effective in very cold-winter climates. 
In warmer climates, one treatment can remain effective for at least ten 
years. For best results, entire neighborhoods should participate in 
spreading the milky spore product.
 
 Another very important group of bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis, known 
as B.t. for short, infects many insect pests, especially their larval stages. 
Different strains or varieties of the bacteria affect different kinds of pests. 
One of the most widely used products contains the strain B.t. ‘Kurstaki’ or 
‘Aizawai’, which infects and kills young caterpillars, including many major 
pests of vegetables, ornamentals, and trees. Product names to look for 
include Dipel, Thuricide, Javelin, and Safer Caterpillar Killer.
 
 The strains B.t. tenebrionis and san diego infect leaf-eating beetles, such 
as Colorado potato beetle. The bacteria are most effective against young 
larvae because the bacteria more easily rupture their stomach linings. 
Colorado Potato Beetle Beater is a B.t. tenebrionis product. Another 
strain, B.t. israelensis, is effective against mosquitoes, fungus gnats, and 
blackflies. Products include Mosquito Dunks and Mosquito Attack.
 
 All bacteria-containing pesticides degrade when exposed to sunlight 
and high storage temperatures. Also, insects must eat the pesticide to 
become infected.
 
 Fungi: Many naturally occurring fungi infect and kill insect pests, and 
one of the most promising for farm and garden use is Beauveria bassiana, 
commonly known as the white muscadine fungus. The fungus lives in the 
soil and affects aphids, caterpillars, mites, grubs, whiteflies, and others. 
Insects don’t have to consume the fungus — mere exposure can lead to 
infection. For this reason, avoid using it whenever bees and beneficial 
pollinators could be affected. It may also be toxic to fish and shouldn’t be 
used around fish-containing waters. To encourage the native Beauveria 
population in your garden, avoid using fungicides. Products that contain 
Beauveria include Mycotrol O and Naturalis H & G.
 
 Viruses: Two other groups of promising microbes include granulosis 
virus and nuclear polyhedrosis virus, which infect many caterpillar pests. 
Although still unavailable for home gardeners, granulosis virus is prov-
ing to be an important tool for commercial orchardists. These viruses 
can control codling moths, armyworms, gypsy moths, oriental fruit 
moths, and cabbageworms.

Becoming botanically correct
Insect and disease killers that come from plant extracts are called botanical 
pesticides or botanicals. Although derived from natural sources, botanicals 
aren’t necessarily safer or less toxic to nonpest insects, humans, and animals 
than synthetically derived pesticides. In fact, most botanicals are broad-
spectrum insecticides, which kill both good and bad bugs indiscriminately.
 
Some botanicals cause allergic reactions in people, others are highly toxic 
to fish and animals, and some may even cause cancer. All pesticides — 
including botanicals — should be used only as a last resort after thoroughly 
reading the label on the package. See the “Using pesticides safely” section, 
later in this chapter.
The following pesticides are listed from least to most toxic to humans:
 
 Hot pepper wax and powder: The chemical capsaicin causes the heat in 
hot peppers, and it’s the active ingredient in these useful botanical prod-
ucts. In low doses, hot pepper wax repels most common insect pests, from 
vegetables and ornamental plants. It doesn’t cause the fruit or vegetables 
to become spicy hot but stays on the surface of the plant where it remains 
effective for up to three weeks. Stronger commercial formulations kill 
insects as well as repel them. Hot pepper wax is even reportedly effective in 
repelling rabbits and tree squirrels. You can find it at garden centers.
 
 Neem: This pesticide is made from the seeds of the tropical neem tree, 
Azadirachta indica, and it comes in two forms — azadirachtin solution 
and neem oil. Unlike the other botanical insecticides in this section, 
neem doesn’t poison insects outright. Instead, when insects eat the 
active ingredient, it interrupts their ability to develop and grow to their 
next life stage or lay eggs. It also deters insects from feeding and is 
effective against aphids, thrips, fungus gnats, caterpillars, beetles, 
leafminers, and others. Amazingly, plants can absorb neem so that any 
insects that feed on them may be killed or deterred from feeding.
 
 Neem oil, the other seed extract, also works against some plant leaf 
diseases, such as black spot on roses, powdery mildew, and rust 
diseases. Mix the syrupy solution with a soapy emulsifier to help it 
spread and stick to the plants.
 
 Neem has very low toxicity in mammals.
 
 Pyrethrins: These insecticidal compounds occur naturally in the 
flowers of some species of chrysanthemum plants. The toxins penetrate 
the insects’ nervous system, quickly causing paralysis. In high enough 
doses or in combination with other pesticides, the insects die. Powerful 
synthetic compounds that imitate the natural chrysanthemum compounds 
are called pyrethroids. Pyrethroids aren’t approved for use in organic 
farms and gardens. Also avoid any pyrethrins that list “piperonyl 
butoxoid” on the label. This additive isn’t approved for organic use.

512
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Pyrethrins have low toxicity, but can induce some serious sneezing, 
headaches, and even nausea if you inhale too much of an insecticide 
that contains them.
 
 Ryania: This pesticide comes from the tropical Ryania speciosa plant. 
Although it controls fruit and codling moths, corn earworm, European 
corn borer, and citrus thrips, it’s also moderately toxic to humans, fish, 
and birds. It’s very toxic to dogs. Seek other botanical pesticides before 
considering ryania.
 
 Sabadilla: Made from the seeds of a tropical plant, sabadilla is a power-
ful broad-spectrum insect killer especially useful for controlling thrips, 
aphids, flea beetles, and tarnished plant bugs, but it also kills bees and 
other beneficial insects. Some people have severe allergic reactions to 
the chemical. Use it only as a last resort.
Using pesticides safely
As an organic gardener, you have already made the commitment to eliminate 
synthetic chemical pesticides from your garden and yard. Many of the insect, 
weed, and disease controls that organic gardeners use, however, are still 
toxic, especially if improperly used. Broad-spectrum botanical insecticides, 
such as pyrethrins and sabadilla, kill beneficial insects, destroy aquatic 
animals, and can injure pets and people. Knowing when, where, and how to 
apply these chemicals is part of responsible gardening.
Before you grab that spray bottle or can of dust off the shelf and head out to 
the garden, pause to check your personal attire. No matter how innocuous 
the pesticide, you must protect yourself from potential harm. Here’s what 
you need:
 
 Long sleeves: Cover your arms and legs completely. If you’re spraying 
trees, wear a raincoat with a hood for extra protection.
 
 Shoes: No sandals, please, and don’t forget the socks.
 
 Hat: Your scalp easily absorbs chemicals. Also, remember to cover your 
neck.
 
 Gloves: I use disposable rubber gloves, especially when measuring and 
mixing concentrated pesticides with water.
 
 Goggles: Eyeglasses aren’t enough. Use safety goggles that enclose your 
eyes and protect them from spray.

513
 Chapter 3: Controlling Weeds, Pests, and Disease

Gardening
 
 Dust mask or respirator: Protect your lungs and sensitive membranes 
from damage. Use a special respirator with filters (available from garden 
centers, farm-supply outlets, and mail-order catalogs) when spraying 
pesticides. A dust mask is only helpful when applying nontoxic dusts to 
prevent inhalation.
 
Most pesticide injuries occur during mixing while you’re preparing to spray. 
Put on your gear before you get started. Always mix and pour chemicals, 
including organic pesticides, in a well-ventilated area where accidental 
spillage won’t contaminate or damage food or personal property. Even 
something as nontoxic as diatomaceous earth can irritate your lungs, while 
spilled oil can ruin your clothes. Don’t use your kitchen measuring cups and 
spoons, either — buy a separate set for garden use.
 
Clear all toys and other stuff out of the area you plan to spray, including the 
areas where the spray may drift. (Check wind direction.) Don’t allow pets or 
other people into the area while you’re spraying, and keep them out for the 
duration recommended on the product label.
 
Read the pesticide label carefully and apply the chemical only to listed 
plants. Relatively harmless pesticides can injure some plants. For example, 
horticultural oil isn’t safe to use on Colorado blue spruce and many thin-
leafed plants. Protect them from harm if you spray other nearby plants.
Consider weather and overall plant health, too. Some chemicals more easily 
injure drought-stressed and insect- or disease-weakened plants. High temper-
atures or intense sunlight can also increase the chances of plant damage.
Some botanical pesticides, such as pyrethrins, are very toxic to fish and 
beneficial insects. When you apply chemicals, follow the label directions very 
carefully. Never spray or dump pesticides near bodies of water or pour them 
into the sink or down the storm drain. Mix up only as much as you need.
Check the weather, too. Don’t spray or apply dust in breezy conditions 
because the chemical may drift away from the target area and harm nearby 
plants or animals. If you expect rain, don’t bother to apply pesticides that will 
wash off before doing their job.
 
Use a calendar with plenty of space on it to write notes and record everything 
that affects your garden. Seed planting and first harvest dates, rainfall amounts, 
unusual temperatures and weather events, the appearance of pests and 
diseases — everything goes on the calendar. Note the fertilizers and pesticides 
you use and on which plants. After keeping calendars for a couple of years, you 
may see patterns emerging that help you anticipate problems and keep them 
from becoming too troublesome. Good records show you what works and what 
doesn’t, allowing you to make informed changes to your gardening practices.

Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Addressing Common Plant Problems
Sorting out what ails your plant can be difficult, but the following sections 
give you a good place to start. Compare your observations to the disease and 
environmental problems in the sections that follow to narrow your list of 
suspects.
Recognizing dastardly diseases
Several different kinds of organisms cause plant diseases, just as they do in 
people. Viruses are the toughest ones because they’re incurable — all you can 
do is try to prevent them. Bacteria are nearly impossible to eliminate, too, after 
the plant is infected. Fortunately, fungi cause most plant diseases, and effective 
control chemicals exist, although prevention is still the best course of action.
The following list describes some of the most common diseases of trees, 
shrubs, vegetables, flowers, and fruits:
 
 Anthracnose: This group of fungi can attack many plants (beans, 
vine crops, tomatoes, and peppers) and trees (dogwoods, maples, ash, 
and sycamores). Look for small, discolored leaf spots or dead twigs, 
especially on the youngest ones. The disease can spread to kill branches 
and eventually the whole plant. Many plant varieties are resistant to 
anthracnose fungi — choose them whenever you can. It spreads easily 
by splashing water and walking through wet plants. Prune off affected 
plant parts, if possible, and dispose of the debris in the trash, not the 
compost pile. Fungicides containing copper can help.
 
 Apple scab: This fungus attacks apple and crabapple trees, producing 
discolored leaf spots and woody-brown scabs on the fruit. The leaf spots 
start out olive colored, eventually turning brown. Plant scab-resistant 
varieties. Rake up and destroy fungus-infected leaves to prevent the 
fungus from reinfecting the trees in spring. Spray with copper- or 
sulfur-based fungicides during wet spring and summer weather.
 
 Armillaria root rot: This fungus infects and kills the roots and lower 
trunk of ornamental trees, especially oaks. Symptoms include smaller 
than normal leaves, honey-colored mushrooms growing near the base 
of the tree and declining tree vigor. Trees may suddenly fall over when 
the roots weaken and decay. Keep trees growing vigorously and avoid 
damage to their roots and trunks. If you live in an area where the disease 
is prevalent, plant resistant tree species. Consult local nursery or local 
extension office experts.

515
 Chapter 3: Controlling Weeds, Pests, and Disease
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Black spot: This fungus causes black spots on rose leaves. Yellow rings 
may surround the spots, and severe infections can cause the shrub 
to lose all its foliage. The disease spreads easily by splashing water 
and overwinters in fallen leaves and mulch around the plant. Remove 
old mulch after leaf fall in the autumn and replace it with fresh mulch. 
Prevent black spot by choosing disease-resistant roses and cleaning up 
and destroying any diseased leaves that fall to the ground. Avoid wetting 
the foliage when you water.
 
 Neem oil (not neem extract) is the best organic fungicide against black 
spot. Use it at the first signs of the disease, but spray either early or late in 
the day to avoid harming beneficial insects. Fungicide sprays containing 
copper or sulfur or potassium bicarbonate can also offer some protection.
 
 Botrytis blight: This fungus attacks a wide variety of plants, especially 
in wet weather. It causes watery-looking, discolored patches on foliage 
that eventually turn brown. Infected flowers, especially roses, geraniums, 
begonias, and chrysanthemums, get fuzzy white or gray patches that 
turn brown, destroying the bloom. Strawberry and raspberry fruits, 
in particular, develop light brown to gray moldy spots and the flesh 
becomes brownish and water-soaked. Discourage Botrytis by allowing 
air to circulate freely around susceptible plants and avoid working with 
wet plants. Remove and destroy any infected plant parts.
 
 Cedar-apple rust: Rust diseases, including this one, often have 
complicated life cycles in which they infect different plant species and 
exhibit very different symptoms on each, depending on their life stage. 
Cedar-apple rust fungus appears as bright orange spots on the leaves 
and fruit of apples and crabapples. On its alternate hosts — juniper and 
red cedar — it develops yellow to orange-colored jelly-like masses in 
the spring. The fungus needs both hosts to reproduce and spread. 
Prevent the disease by planting resistant apple varieties and keeping the 
alternate hosts several hundred yards away from susceptible trees. A 
related fungus, western pear rust, affects pears similarly.
 
 Club root: This fungus mainly infects cole crops, such as cabbage, 
broccoli, and collards, and grows best in acidic soils. Symptoms include 
stunted growth, wilting, poor development, and swollen lumps on the 
roots. Practice good garden hygiene by keeping tools clean and picking up 
plant debris. Raise the soil pH to 7.2 and avoid planting susceptible crops 
in infected soil for at least 7 years. Some vegetable varieties are immune.
 
 Corn smut: You can’t miss this fungus disease because it causes 
large mutant-looking, white to gray swellings on corn ears. When the 
swellings burst open, the fungus spreads. Prevent the disease by 
planting resistant corn varieties and rotating crops so that you don’t 
grow corn in the same place year after year. Dispose of infected plant 
parts in the trash. Or, go with the flow and work corn smut into your 
recipes — chefs have been making use of its earthy flavor since 
pre-Columbian times, especially in Mexico.

516
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Cytospora canker: Cankers appear as oozing, sunken or swollen areas 
on the bark of susceptible trees, such as peaches, apples, maples, 
spruces, and willows. The new shoots turn yellow and wilt and then die 
back. The disease attacks woody stems on susceptible plants, such as 
fruit trees, spruces, and maples, forming cankers that can kill infected 
branches. Plant resistant or less susceptible plants and keep them grow-
ing vigorously. Avoid bark injuries that provide an entrance for infecting 
fungus. Remove and destroy infected branches, cutting back to healthy 
wood that doesn’t contain any black or brownish streaks.
 
 Damping off: Mostly a problem in young plants and seedlings, this 
fungus rots stems off near the soil line, causing the plant to keel over 
and die. Prevent damping off by planting seeds and seedlings only in 
pasteurized planting soil and avoiding overwatering. Air circulation 
helps prevent the fungus, too. Clean your tools in isopropyl alcohol to 
prevent the spread.
 
 Fusarium wilt: This fungus is fatal to many vegetable crops. The first 
symptoms are yellowing leaves and stunted growth, followed by wilting 
and plant death. In melons, the stems develop a yellow streak, which 
eventually turns brown. Choose Fusarium-resistant varieties. After 
plants are infected, there’s no cure. If you build your soil’s health so that 
it contains lots of beneficial microorganisms, you should rarely be 
bothered with this disease.
 
 Galls: These appear as swollen bumps on leaves, stems, and branches. 
Gall wasps, aphids, and mites infest oaks and other landscape trees and 
shrubs, causing unsightly swelling on leaves and twigs. In other cases, 
bacteria and fungi are the culprits. Usually the damage is simply cosmetic 
and not life-threatening to the plant. Control depends on what’s causing 
the problem. Take a sample of the damage to a plant expert at your local 
extension office or contact your local master gardener program.
 
 Leaf spots and blights: Several fungi show up first as circular spots on 
leaves of tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, and other vulnerable vegetables, 
flowers, and ornamental plants. The spots increase in size until the 
leaves die and fall off. The fungi spread easily in damp weather and in 
gardens where overhead watering wets the foliage, especially late in 
the day. The best control is to remove all plant debris at the end of the 
gardening season, clean tools between uses, practice crop rotation, buy 
disease-resistant varieties, and avoid contact with wet plants. Copper-
based fungicides offer control as a last resort.
 
 Mildew (downy and powdery): These two fungi produce similar symp-
toms: white, powdery coating on leaves. They infect a wide variety of 
plants, including roses, vegetables, fruit trees, strawberries and raspber-
ries, and lilacs. A different species of mildew attacks each kind of plant. 
A mildew that attacks lilacs, for example, won’t harm roses. The fungi 
disfigure plants, but may not kill them outright. Instead, they weaken their 
hosts, making them unattractive and susceptible to other problems. Downy 
mildew attacks during cool, wet weather. Powdery mildew appears during 
warm, humid weather and cool nights, especially when the soil is dry.

517
 Chapter 3: Controlling Weeds, Pests, and Disease
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Many vegetable and flower varieties are resistant to mildew — read 
package and catalog descriptions carefully. Remove infected plant 
debris from the garden and avoid getting the leaves wet. Use superfine 
horticultural oil or neem oil to treat infected plants. Use copper- and 
sulfur-based fungicides as a last resort.
 
 Root rots: This broad term covers a number of fungal root diseases, which 
cause susceptible plants to turn yellow, wilt, and sometimes die. Nearly all 
plants are susceptible under the right conditions, such as excessive soil 
moisture, poor soil aeration, and wounding. The fungi can survive in the 
soil for many years without a host. Prevent root rot by building healthy, 
well-drained soil. Microbial fungicides can help foil many root rot diseases.
 
 Rust: Many different fungi cause rust, and the symptoms of this 
disease vary widely, depending on the kind of plant they infect. Usually, 
the symptoms include yellow to orange spots on the leaf undersides, 
with white or yellow spots on the upper leaf surface. Susceptible 
plants include brambles, hollyhocks, roses, pines, pears, bluegrass and 
ryegrass lawns, wheat, barberry, beans, and many more. Each rust 
species infects a specific plant species, so that the rust on roses can’t 
infect beans, for example. Some rusts, such as white pine blister rust, 
have complicated life cycles and must infect two different plants — in 
this case, white pines and Ribes species, such as currant and gooseberry. 
Symptoms of this disease include yellow, orange, reddish-brown, or 
black powdery spots or masses on leaves, needles, or twigs.
 
 Rust fungus is most prevalent in humid and damp conditions. Provide 
good air circulation to keep foliage as dry as possible, remove and destroy 
infected parts, and keep your tools clean. Plant disease-resistant varieties.
 
 Slime flux: This bacterial rot inside infected trees, usually elms, maples, 
and poplars, causes oozing and often bad-smelling sap to run from old 
wounds or pruning cuts. There’s no control after the symptoms appear.
 
 Verticillium wilt: This fungus affects many plants, including tomatoes, 
eggplant, potatoes, raspberries, strawberries, roses, Japanese maples, 
olives, and cherries. Look for wilting and yellow leaves, especially older 
ones. In some plants, the leaves curl up before falling off. Prevent future 
infections by cleaning up all garden debris, cleaning tools thoroughly 
with disinfectant, and avoiding susceptible species. Choose resistant 
varieties and practice crop rotation.
 
 Viruses: This group of incurable diseases infects vegetables, brambles, 
strawberries, trees, and flowering plants. Usually the leaves develop mot-
tled yellow, white, or light green patches and may pucker along the veins. 
Flowers may develop off-color patches, and fruit ripens unevenly. Aphids, 
leafhoppers, nematodes, and whiteflies spread the virus as they move from 
plant to plant. Viruses often live in wild bramble plants and weeds. Smoking 
or handling tobacco products around susceptible plants can spread 
tobacco mosaic virus, which infects tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, petu-
nias, and other plants. Prevention is the only strategy. Buy only virus-free 
plants and keep pests in check. Eradicate wild brambles near your garden.

518
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Preventing problems
Your gardening methods can go a long way toward keeping diseases out of 
your vegetable and flower patch and away from your fruits and landscape 
trees:
 
 Choose disease-resistant plants. Many popular flowers, vegetables, 
perennials, turf grasses, trees, and shrubs have varieties available that 
resist common diseases and even some pests.
 
 Mulch to reduce insects, weeds, and diseases. A thick layer of organic 
mulch around your garden plants and shrubs keeps weeds from gaining 
an upper hand. It also helps to maintain consistent soil moisture and 
temperature, which keeps plant roots healthy and better able to resist 
disease.
 
 Choose plants that are adapted to your climate and site. If your soil 
drains poorly, for example, don’t plant shrubs that require well-drained 
soil.
 
 Space and prune plants to provide good air circulation. Fresh air helps 
leaves dry quickly and thwarts diseases.
 
 Water the soil, not the plants. Early-morning watering is best because 
the sun will evaporate any water on the leaves. Avoid evening watering 
because the foliage will stay wet all night, giving fungus spores a chance 
to grow and infect plants.
 
 Avoid working with wet plants because diseases spread easily when 
the foliage is wet. Many diseases spread through splashed water. Beans, 
strawberries, raspberries, and other plants are particularly susceptible.
 
 Avoid excess nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrogen makes plants grow fast and 
juicy. As a result, the outer layers of the leaves and stems (similar to 
human skin) that protect the plant are thinner than usual and more 
susceptible to insect damage.
 
 Keep your yard clean. Dispose of diseased leaves, fruit, and wood in the 
garbage, not the compost pile. Keep your yard tidy to discourage pests 
that live in dead plant debris, log piles, and other hidden places. Some 
insect pests — such as aphids, bark beetles, and tarnished plant bugs — 
can spread diseases between plants. Keep them under control, and you’ll 
help prevent disease.
 
 Inspect plants frequently. You have a better chance of preventing a 
serious outbreak if you catch it early. Look for stem and leaf wounds and 
damage, off-color foliage, wilting, leaf spots, and insects whenever you 
work among your landscape and garden plants.
 
 Practice crop rotation. Many insects and diseases live in the soil from 
one year to the next, waiting for their favorite host plants to return. Foil 
them by planting something different in each spot each year.

Understanding disease-control methods
Preventing plant stress and environmental imbalances are the most important 
first steps in controlling disease. Beneficial microbes, especially in the soil, 
usually keep the populations of plant-disease-causing organisms in check, 
but environmental factors can tip the balance in favor of the bad guys. High 
humidity and soil moisture, as well as temperature extremes, encourage fungi 
to grow. Stress from transplanting, pruning, and insect infestation can weaken 
plants and make them more vulnerable to infection from fungi, bacteria, and 
viruses. And sometimes the pesticide you choose to use against one problem 
can make another problem worse. Broad-spectrum fungicides, such as copper 
and sulfur, for example, kill beneficial fungi as well as harmful ones.
The only plant diseases you can effectively control after the plants become 
infected are those caused by fungi. Except for solarization and copper, the 
following control methods target mainly fungi. The treatments are listed in 
order of toxicity, starting with the least toxic method.
 
 Solarization: Heating the soil with the rays of the sun works to kill fungi 
and bacteria. Unfortunately, it kills both good and bad microbes. Use 
this technique in gardens where disease has been a problem in the past; 
find out how in the solarization section earlier in this chapter.
 
 Antitranspirants: These waxy or oily materials are designed to help 
evergreens maintain leaf moisture during winter months. By coating 
the leaves, they also prevent fungus spores from attacking. Look for 
Wilt-Pruf and similar products and follow the instructions on the label.
 
 Potassium bicarbonate: This natural chemical controls powdery mildew 
on roses, grapes, cucumbers, strawberries, and other plants. It also 
supplies some potassium fertilizer when sprayed on foliage, which 
strengthens plant cell walls and makes them harder for pests and 
diseases to penetrate. Look for the products called Kaligreen by 
Toagosei and Remedy by Bonide Company. Mix the powder with water 
and spray all leaf surfaces thoroughly to ensure contact with the fungus. 
Note that repeated applications can burn or stunt the leaves.
 
 Microbial fungicides: Some of the newest fungicides are fungi themselves. 
These good guys grow in the soil on plant roots and protect the plants 
from harmful root-rot fungi. Apply them to the soil before planting or water 
them into lawns and gardens. Products to look for include Mycostop, 
Serenade Garden Disease Control, RootShield, PlantShield, and TurfShield. 
These products contain viable fungi and must be stored properly and used 
carefully according to label instructions for best results
 
 Neem oil: This multipurpose pesticide thwarts black spot on roses, 
powdery mildew, and rust fungi as well as insects and mites. Look for 
a product called Trilogy and others that contain neem oil, not neem 
extract. Warm the syrupy solution to make it easier to mix.

 Sulfur: Useful for controlling nearly all fungus diseases on leaves and 
stems, sulfur is one of the oldest pesticides known. You can dust the 
powder directly on leaves or mix finely ground dust with water and a 
soapy wetting agent that helps it adhere to leaf surfaces. It can cause 
leaf damage if applied within a month of horticultural oil, however, or 
when temperatures exceed 80°F. It also lowers soil pH and harms many 
beneficial insects. Inhaled dust can cause lung damage. Take precau-
tions to protect yourself. Products include Bonide Sulfur Plant 
Fungicide, Safer Garden Fungicide Liquid and Britz Sulfur Dust.
 
 Copper: Copper sulfate is a powerful fungicide that controls a wide 
range of leaf diseases, including fungal and bacterial blights and leaf 
spots, but it’s much more toxic to humans, mammals, fish, and other 
water creatures than most synthetic chemical fungicides. Use copper-
containing products only as a last resort and take full precautions to 
avoid poisoning yourself and others. It can also build up in the soil and 
harm plants and microorganisms.

A
s more and more news comes out about the dangers of chemical 
pesticides and fertilizers, more people are choosing to grow their own 
food — and in the process are discovering that homegrown vegetables and 
herbs are fresher and taste better than store-bought. Nothing tastes better 
than a sliced red, ripe, sun-warmed tomato in a leafy salad with sweet basil or 
your own fresh peas picked right off the vine.
In this chapter, you find out about designing and starting your vegetable 
garden. You get tips to make your garden more productive and information 
about growing and harvesting the most popular home garden vegetables and 
herbs.
Planning Your Vegetable Garden
When you’re starting your first garden, you may have more questions than 
answers — where to put the garden, when and how much to plant, which 
vegetables to choose. It’s no wonder that problems can pop up before you 
know what’s happening! This section shows you how to get off to a good 
start and how to prevent troublesome pests, diseases, and other plant 
stress-related problems along the way.

Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Finding a place to grow
You may dream of a big garden filled with all types of fresh and inviting 
vegetables, but getting to that stage takes experience and preparation. For 
the first timer, small is beautiful — take time to get it right on a small scale 
before launching a market-garden-sized project. Keep the following ideas in 
mind to save yourself a lot of work and frustration later in the season:
 
 Start small. Little plants and seeds turn into a big commitment as they 
grow. A 10-feet by 20-feet garden is plenty to grow a variety of vegetables 
such as lettuce, beans, carrots, tomatoes, and peppers. If you want to 
grow vining crops or space hogs, such as corn or pumpkins, you can 
expand it to 20 feet by 30 feet. Planting more space than you can keep well 
tended is probably the No. 1 cause for gardener frustration and burnout.
 
 Make it convenient. Place the garden in a location where you see it every 
day. Your garden is more likely to thrive when you visit it regularly.
 
 Put the garden in full sun. Vegetable plants need at least 6 hours of 
full sun each day. Plan the garden so that tall plants, such as corn and 
tomatoes don’t cast shade on shorter plants, such as beets and cabbage.
 
 Choose a well-drained spot. Vegetables are more prone to disease in 
soggy soil.
 
 Grow a variety of crops. Planting a number of different vegetables 
ensures that something will produce. Plus, diversity in the garden 
encourages good insects and helps to reduce problems from harmful 
ones.
Preparing the soil
Healthy soil is the key to the success of your vegetable garden. Soil rich with 
fertile organic matter, beneficial microorganisms, nutrients, and air spaces 
produces the most vigorous and productive vegetable plants. Keep the soil 
pH between 6.0 and 7.0 and work a 3- to 4-inch layer of compost or compos-
ted manure into the soil before each planting season. Compost adds organic 
matter, and it’s the organic gardener’s mantra (see Chapter 2)!
 
For all but the sandiest soils, raised beds are the best way to grow vegetables. 
Raised beds are plots of soil that has been mounded to form a large flat 
surface usually 3 to 4 feet wide, 6 to 12 inches tall, and as long as needed. 
Raised beds offer many advantages, especially if you have poorly drained or 
clay soil:
 
 Soil drains faster.
 
 Soil warms up faster in the spring. Drier soil warms more quickly than 
water-saturated soil.

523
 Chapter 4: Raising Organic Vegetables and Herbs
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Because you don’t step on raised beds, the soil doesn’t compact as 
much, and plant roots grow better — especially on root crops, such as 
carrots, beets, and radishes.
 
 They enable you to concentrate and conserve fertilizer and water in the 
growing zone.
 
 More ideal growing conditions enable you to plant a little closer 
together than normal, which reduces watering and weeding and gives 
you more productive plants.
You can build two types of raised beds:
 
 Contained raised beds have permanent walls around them made from 
wood, bricks, or stone. These beds look neat and tidy and don’t have to 
be reformed each year.
 
 You make freestanding raised beds from soil in the garden each year. 
They don’t have walls made from other materials, so they tend to flatten 
and lower with time. Freestanding raised beds are good for flexibility 
and changing garden designs each year and to rotate crops.
 
Regardless of the type you make, amend the soil in your raised bed each year 
with several inches compost. Work it into the top 12 inches of soil with a 
garden fork. Smooth the top of the beds with a garden rake.
Designing your vegetable garden
You can be as creative or traditional as you like in your vegetable garden 
design. Plant everything in straight rows or create imaginative curved raised 
beds. Make a heart-shaped garden plot or whatever else strikes your fancy.
 
Draw a diagram of your garden plan on graph paper, laying out rows and 
raised beds with a ruler and pencil. To figure out how many plants will fit 
into a row or bed, follow the guidelines on the seed packets and make little 
dots or circles to indicate the larger veggies, such as broccoli, tomatoes, and 
squash. Leave room for walking paths at least 24 inches wide to harvest and 
work the beds, and don’t be afraid to mix in herbs and flowers. The more 
color and variety, the more beautiful the garden, and the more likely you’ll 
strike an ecological balance with birds and beneficial insects, helping to keep 
harmful pests in check.
For even more garden success, try a few of the following techniques:
 
 Be creative with the garden design. Don’t plant all the same type of 
vegetables in one spot. For example, plant two small patches of beans 
in different spots in the garden. Even if animals or insects destroy one 
patch, they may not find the other.

524
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Rotate crops every planting season. Follow crops that use a lot of 
nitrogen, such as sweet corn and tomatoes, with crops that add nitrogen 
to the soil, such as beans and peas. Avoid planting crops from the same 
family, which tend to share the same insect pests and diseases, in the 
same spot. Allow at least 3 years before planting a vegetable family in 
the same spot again.
 
 Plants have family trees, too. Check out http://vegetablesonly.com/
VegFamilies.pdf to find out which plants have the same genetic roots — 
pun totally intended — and therefore share susceptibilities to disease.
 
 Use succession planting. Crops, such as lettuce and beans, are quick 
to mature, so you can plant them several times throughout the growing 
season for a constant supply of tender new vegetables. This technique 
works best when you plant small patches of each vegetable every two 
weeks. That way you won’t ever have a glut of lettuce, and you enjoy a 
longer growing season.
 
 Try companion planting. Plants may benefit another plant by repelling 
certain insect pests, making nutrients more available, giving shade, or 
providing a habitat for beneficial insects. Table 4-1 shows some favorable 
and unfavorable combinations. Keep in mind, most of this theory isn’t 
scientifically proven, so experiment in your garden and see what happens.

Planting the right seed at the right time
Most vegetables are annual plants, which die after one season of growth. 
These plants generally fall into two groups:
 
 Cool-season vegetables grow best during cool weather and include 
broccoli, spinach, lettuce, carrots, peas, and potatoes. You can usually 
plant them in the garden 1 to 2 weeks before the last frost date. Not only 
can they tolerate cool weather, they need cool weather to grow and 
mature properly. If you plant these crops too late in spring, they won’t 
thrive in the heat of the summer. You can even plant some, such as peas 
and lettuce, in mid to late summer for a fall harvest.
 
 Warm-season crops, such as tomatoes, squash, peppers, sweet corn, 
melons, and cucumber, grow best in hot weather. Plant them 1 to 2 
weeks after the last frost date for your area or when the soil is at least 
60°F. These plants don’t like the cold, so don’t rush to plant them before 
the soil warms up. Contact your local weather service to determine your 
average last frost date, if you aren’t sure when it usually occurs.
Winter is the quiet time between gardening seasons in most parts of the 
country. But in mild winter and hot summer areas of the country, such as 
southern California, Texas, and Florida, the cycle is reversed. There, you 
plant warm-season crops in spring and fall and cool-season crops in winter. 
Summer is the time for you and the veggies to take a break from the hot 
weather. In rainy, mild areas, you can grow some crops, especially those 
that enjoy cool weather, year ’round. Plant warm-season crops so that they 
mature during the warmest months of the year.

526
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
Some crops, such as beans, peas, carrots, and squash, are normally sown 
directly in the garden soil where they’ll grow. Other plants, such as tomatoes, 
peppers, and eggplants, which take a long time to mature, grow best if they 
get an early start in greenhouses or indoors in your house 4 to 6 weeks 
before you set them in their permanent garden location. This head start is 
critical in cold areas with short summers.
Some vegetables, such as cucumber, broccoli, onion, and lettuce, go either 
way. You can find already started transplants (seedlings) at local garden 
centers, or you can sow them directly in the garden. Base your decision on 
how much time you have and whether your favorite varieties are more 
readily available as transplants or seeds.
Sorting out seed types
When choosing vegetable varieties to plant, 
you may come across the terms hybrid, open 
pollinated, and genetically modified. The first 
two are important for home gardeners, while 
the third is a new type of plant that, to date, 
applies mainly to commercial farmers.
  Open-pollinated or heirloom varieties are 
those that produce offspring similar to the 
parents. The flowers are naturally pollinated 
in the fields with little or no interference 
from the farmer. Some classic open-polli-
nated varieties include Brandywine tomato, 
Kentucky Wonder bean, and Golden 
Bantam sweet corn. Many of these variet-
ies are locally adapted and have unusual 
colors, shapes, and flavors. Gardeners 
have relied on these varieties for genera-
tions because they can save the seeds and 
grow the plants easily.
  Hybrid varieties have been around since 
the 1900s. Researchers found that breeding 
different corn varieties together resulted 
in offspring with better traits than either 
parent, plus they grew vigorously and more 
uniformly. Although you can’t successfully 
save seeds from hybrids, many varieties 
exhibit important characteristics, such as 
improved disease resistance, vigor, and 
consistent quality. Some classic examples 
of hybrid varieties include Big Boy tomato, 
Gypsy pepper, and Premium Crop broccoli.
  Genetically modified plants are those bred 
through gene splicing where certain char-
acteristics are taken from unrelated plants 
or even other organisms and inserted in 
the vegetable. Most of these varieties are 
in the corn, soybean, cotton, and potato 
groups, and most are available only for 
farmers to purchase. While genetically 
modified plants offer many benefits, such 
as decreased dependence on pesticide 
sprays due to inserting an insecticide into 
the plant, many questions still exist about 
the long-term health risks and environmen-
tal safety of manipulating the gene pool so 
dramatically and quickly.
Which type of vegetable variety you grow is a 
personal decision based on trial and error and 
recommendations from fellow gardeners. The 
key is to experiment in your garden with a range 
of varieties to find the right ones that grow, pro-
duce, and taste best to you.

Growing Veggies 101
Growing a garden is like learning to run a marathon — start one step at a 
time, take it slowly at first, and build on your successes. The following 
sections outline the steps that create a successful and abundant garden.
Sowing seeds
After your raised beds and garden soil are raked and ready (see the 
“Preparing the soil” section, earlier in this chapter), it’s finally time to plant. 
The general rule for planting seeds is to plant them twice as deep as the 
seeds are wide. For big seeds, such as beans and corn, that means about 1 to 
2 inches deep, while small seeds, such as lettuce, may be planted only ¼-inch 
deep. After they’re in the soil, keep the soil evenly moist, especially the soil 
surface. If the surface dries out, it can form a crust that prevents seedlings 
from emerging.
You should see signs of life within a few days for quick sprouters, such as 
radishes. Slowpokes, such as carrots, may need a week or two to germinate. 
Be patient — as long as you use fresh seed, labeled for the current year, they 
should come up eventually.
 
In unusually wet and cold or hot and dry soil, however, seeds may rot or fail 
to sprout. Replant, if necessary, when the weather improves.
When you put transplants into the garden, you can set them a bit deeper in the 
soil than they grew in their pots. Try planting peppers, eggplants, tomatoes, 
and cabbage-type plants right up to their first set of true leaves, the ones that 
look like miniature adult leaves and grow above the fleshy seed leaves. Planting 
more deeply gives plants stability and, in some cases, a stronger root system. 
Loosely wrap a 2- to 3-inch-wide strip of newspaper around each stem before 
planting to prevent cutworms from chewing through the tender stem. The 
paper should extend at least an inch above and below the soil.
Starting plants with a hearty meal
When seeds are up and growing and the transplants are   planted, give them 
a dose of fertilizer. Mild, liquid organic fertilizers, such as fish emulsion and 
seaweed mix, provide nitrogen and other essential nutrients for early growth. 
Water your plants with 1 tablespoon each of liquid fish emulsion and liquid 
seaweed fertilizers mixed into 1 gallon of tepid water one week after seeds 
sprout and at planting time for transplants.

528
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
You may also consider applying a complete organic fertilizer, such as 5-3-3, 
to keep them growing strong. (See Chapter 2 for more on organic fertilizers.) 
Heavy-feeding vegetables, such as corn, tomatoes, and broccoli, may need 
monthly doses of fertilizer, while light feeders, such as beans, radishes, and 
peas, may need little or no additional fertilizer.
How much you use depends on the size and type of plants. (Follow package 
instructions.) Sprinkle it 6 to 8 inches from the stems and scratch it gently 
into the soil. Water the soil to dissolve and disperse the fertilizer. If you use 
liquid fertilizer, follow the recommended dosage on the label and apply it 
with a watering can around the bases of the plants.
 
Don’t go overboard on the fertilizer. Even organic fertilizers can accumulate 
in the soil, causing a salt buildup that harms plant roots. And excess fertilizer 
can run off into streams, causing water pollution. If you give plants too much 
nitrogen at the wrong time, you may even prevent some vegetables from 
forming fruit. Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants, for example, grow loads of 
lush foliage, but few flowers or fruit.
Battling weeds
Almost as soon as you see signs of vegetables germinating, you’re probably 
going to see weeds, too. Get familiar with what your vegetables look like when 
they’re small so that you don’t pull them out instead of the weeds. The best 
way to control weeds is to hand pull or slice them off with a hoe when they’re 
young because you disturb less soil and they’re easier to pull at that time than 
when they’re more mature. Then mulch around the vegetables, as follows:
 
 For heat-loving crops, such as tomato, cucumber, and squash, use black 
landscape fabric mulch to stop weed growth, heat the soil, and conserve 
moisture. Lay the fabric down on the planting bed before planting, 
and then poke holes in the fabric with scissors or a knife to plant your 
transplants or seeds.
 
 For cool-loving crops, such as lettuce, broccoli, and spinach, mulch 
with organic materials, such as hay, newspapers, grass clippings, or 
pine straw, after planting. A 3- to 4-inch layer keeps most weeds at bay 
throughout the summer, keeps the soil cool, and conserves moisture. In 
warm summer areas, you may need to reapply the organic mulch in 
mid-summer because it does degrade quickly in heat and moisture.

529
 Chapter 4: Raising Organic Vegetables and Herbs
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
Keeping plants well-watered
Watering is critical during the early stages of plant growth, but it’s also 
essential when the plants are forming and ripening fruits. Mulching is an 
excellent way to keep the soil moist throughout the summer, but you may 
need to do some supplemental watering, depending on your weather and 
where you live. Lack of water can cause small, deformed fruits. Also, some 
conditions, such as blossom end rot on tomatoes, are due to fluctuating soil 
moisture, so be consistent about watering and mulching.
Vegetables from Allium to Zucchini
Seed catalogs have so many delicious veggies to choose from that you may 
have a tough time knowing where to start — and stop! If you’re growing your 
first garden, grow just a few different vegetables from among your favorites 
and stick to one variety of each. As you gain experience, add more kinds and 
experiment with one or two different crops each year. If something doesn’t 
work out the way that you expected it to, try a different variety or growing 
method or abandon it and give the garden space to another crop. That’s one 
of the beautiful things about vegetables gardens: You get to start with a clean 
slate each year and have a chance to improve and change your garden based 
on last year’s experiences.
In the following descriptions of each vegetable, you find choice varieties, 
planting and care recommendations, harvest tips, and specific pests you 
need to watch out for. Many organic gardeners prefer to buy seeds and 
young transplants that were produced organically. Although many seed 
companies don’t grow organic seeds, some specialize in them, and others 
offer them in addition to non-organically grown seeds. See the “Organic seed 
sources” sidebar in this chapter.
Alliums: Onions, shallots, garlic, and leeks
Onions, shallots, garlic, and leeks all belong to a group of pungent plants called 
alliums. These plants generally form bulbs or enlarged below-ground stems. 
Many members of the allium family make lovely additions to the flower garden.
 
Choosing an onion variety is more complicated than choosing most other 
vegetables because they fall into different groups based on sulfur content 

530
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
and the day length they need to form bulbs. Pungent varieties contain more 
sulfur, which makes them keep longer in storage and produce more tears 
when you cut them. Sweet varieties don’t have as much sulfur and need to 
be used sooner after harvest. Adverse growing conditions, such as weed 
competition, drought, and poor fertility, can increase onions’ sulfur content, 
even in the sweet varieties.
Onions are also referred to as short, long day, or intermediate. Short-day 
varieties form bulbs when they receive 11 to 12 hours of daylight. Long-
day varieties need 14 to 16 hours of daylight to form bulbs. Choose long-
day varieties, such as Walla Walla (sweet) and Copra (pungent) for northern 
climates. Go with short-day varieties, such as Granex (sweet) and White 
Bermuda (sweet) if you live south of 35 degrees latitude, which runs from 
northern South Carolina through Oklahoma and Arizona to central California. 
When in doubt, try an intermediate variety, such as Candy (sweet). You can 
start onions from seeds, transplants, or sets, which are small dormant bulbs.
Garlic varieties come in two types — soft-neck and hard-neck. Soft-neck kinds 
produce 12 to 18 small cloves and are best for long-term storage. Hard-neck 
types produce 6 to 12 cloves and don’t keep as long in storage. Some favorite 
soft-neck varieties include Silverskin, while a good hard-neck variety is German 
Red. Ask around at farmers’ markets for advice and choose a variety that suits 
your climate and soil type.
Shallots are mild  tasting, small onions and the easiest to grow of all the 
edible alliums. Try Gray or Brittany varieties. Another onion relative, leeks, 
are indispensable in European cooking and are easy to grow in raised beds. 
Varieties include King Richard and Winter Giant.
Here are the basics about alliums:
 
 Planting and care: Alliums like well-drained, fertile, loose soil and 
appreciate raised beds. They grow well in cool weather and can take a 
light frost. Sow onion seeds indoors a few months before transplanting 
into the garden and keep the tops trimmed to about 3 inches high until 
transplant time. In moderate climates, sow seeds in fall for a spring 
harvest. In colder climates, sow seeds in early spring for a summer 
harvest. Plant shallot and onion sets in the spring. Cloves of garlic are 
best planted in fall, even in cold climates, to overwinter and mature the 
following summer. Start leeks indoors in spring 8 to 10 weeks before 
setting transplants into the garden. They mature in fall.
 
 Keep your alliums weed-free, well watered, and fertilized with a high 
phosphorous fertilizer, such as bone meal, to promote large bulb 
growth.

531
 Chapter 4: Raising Organic Vegetables and Herbs
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Harvesting: When the tops begin to yellow, the bulbs are usually ready 
for harvest. After pulling them out of the ground, either use fresh or 
allow them to cure in a warm, airy room for a few weeks before storing in 
a cold basement. Use sweet onion varieties within a few weeks. Shallots, 
pungent onions, and some garlic varieties, however, can last for months 
in storage. Pull leeks as needed in fall, after cool weather “sweetens” 
their taste. Many varieties can withstand 20°F temperatures.
 
 Pests and diseases: Onion maggots are probably the worst pest of the 
allium family crops, feeding on onion roots and bulbs. Mulching, crop 
rotation, including carrots as a companion plant, and row covers help 
reduce the risks from these pests.
Asparagus
Asparagus plants are either female or male, and the best varieties of asparagus 
are the ones dubbed all-male. The female plants produce seeds, which reduce 
the amount of spears they produce. The males don’t produce seeds and, 
therefore, produce more edible-sized spears. Good all-male varieties include 
Jersey Giant, Jersey King, and Jersey Knight. UC 157 is a good one for 
California.
Keep in mind the following asparagus-growing guidelines:
 
 Planting and care: Asparagus is a perennial vegetable that can live for 
20 years, so take special care to create a proper planting bed. Choose a 
sunny location with well-drained soil. Dig a 1-foot-deep trench and add 6 
inches of compost or well-rotted manure. Form 8-inch-high mounds, 18 
inches apart, in the trench and lay the spider-like asparagus roots over 
the mounds, as shown in Figure 4-1. The crowns, where the roots meet 
the stems, should be about 5 to 6 inches below the soil surface. Cover 
them with 2 inches of soil and gradually backfill the trench, an inch or 
two at a time, as the asparagus spears grow until the trench is level with 
the surrounding soil. Fertilize the bed each spring with compost and a 
complete fertilizer. Keep the bed weed-free and well watered.
 
 Harvesting: Don’t harvest any asparagus spears for the first year after 
you plant them. Let the crowns build up strength. The second year, 
harvest in spring only those spears larger than a pencil diameter for 3 to 
4 weeks. In subsequent years, harvest pencil-diameter sized spears for 
up to 2 months. Let the remaining spears grow to rejuvenate the crown.
 
 Pests and diseases: Asparagus beetle is a hard-to-kill pest of asparagus. 
The adults damage the spears, and larvae eat the fern-like asparagus 
leaves. Control them by removing the ferns in late fall and spray with 
pyrethrins (see Chapter 3) in spring at first signs of this pest.

Cole crops: Broccoli, cauliflower, 
cabbage, and company
These closely related plants share the same growing requirements, diseases, 
and pests. All thrive in cool spring and autumn weather and tolerate frost. 
Some of the best broccoli varieties include Premium Crop, Packman, and 
Green Comet. For good cauliflower, try Snow Crown and Fremont.
Cabbage varieties that perform well include Red Acre, Savoy Ace, Stonehead 
and, Dynamo. Some favorite kale varieties are Red Russian, Lacinato, and 
Vates Dwarf Blue Scotch Curled. Other not-so-common cole crops to try 
include Bubbles Brussels sprouts and Winner and Superschmeltz kohlrabi.
Heed these pointers when growing cole crops:
 
 Planting and care: Sow seeds directly into the ground or start transplants 
indoors 4 to 6 weeks before transplanting them outside. Cole crops need 
a moderate amount of fertilizer and water throughout the growing season 
to grow well but also like well-drained soil. Fertilize at planting and one 
month later with a complete fertilizer. Organic mulch, such as straw, placed 
around plants after transplanting helps keep the soil cool and moist.
 
 Take advantage of cool weather by sowing cole crops in early spring for 
an early summer harvest or late summer for a fall harvest. You can grow 
some varieties of broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower through the winter 
in mild winter areas for harvest in spring.
 
 Be patient when planting Brussels sprouts. You want to plant them late 
enough (late May or even June) so that they don’t mature until late fall. 
For best flavor, Brussels sprouts need to mature through several frosts.
 
 Harvesting: Harvest broccoli when the heads (clusters of flowers) are 
tightly packed and still green by cutting just below the head. In most 

533
 Chapter 4: Raising Organic Vegetables and Herbs
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
cases, new, but smaller broccoli heads will grow further down the stem. 
If the yellow flowers begin to open, the taste becomes bitter and the 
plant will stop producing more heads. Harvest cabbage when they’re 
firm when squeezed. Cut them as described for broccoli. To harvest 
white or blanched cauliflower, wrap the upper plant leaves around the 
developing, 3- to 4-inch heads. Harvest within 4 to 10 days. Harvest 
Brussels sprouts after cool weather in fall when the sprouts are still firm 
by twisting them off the stem. Pick kale leaves as needed.
 
 Pests and diseases: Cabbageworms and cabbage loopers are the two pri-
mary pests of cole crops. The larvae feed on the leaves, decimating the 
plant quickly. Handpick the caterpillars or spray B.t. (see Chapter 3) to 
control them. Cabbage maggots attack the roots of cole crops. Place row 
covers over the plants to prevent the fly from laying eggs at the base of 
the plant. Black rot and club root damage the roots and heads of cole 
crops — crop rotation is the best control for these diseases.

Eggplant, like its cousins, peppers and tomatoes, loves hot weather, plenty 
of water, and full sun. Eggplants come in many size and color varieties. A 
few favorites include the large, oval shaped Black Beauty (purple), and Rosa 
Bianca (lavender streaked). Long, narrow varieties include Ichiban (purple) 
and Thai Long (green). For small, round eggplants try Easter Egg (white) and 
Turkish Orange (orange).
Check out these eggplant-growing points:
 
 Planting and care: Start seeds indoors 8 weeks before transplanting 
outside. Wait until the soil has warmed to at least 60°F before 
transplanting. In colder climates or in small space gardens, consider 
planting eggplant in large containers to save space and get them to grow 
faster. Eggplants in containers also are very ornamental and look great 
as a decorative plant as well.
 
 Eggplants like moderate fertility and water, so fertilizer monthly and 
mulch with black landscape fabric, but go easy on the nitrogen fertilizer 
or you’ll have all foliage and few flowers and fruits.
 
 Harvesting: Harvest eggplant when they’ve reached the desired size for 
eating. Harvest before the skin color becomes dull-looking — a sign of 
over maturity and mushiness.
 
 Pests and diseases: Verticillium wilt disease is a main problem for 
eggplant and causes the entire plant to wilt and die in summer. The 
easiest solution to this soil-borne disease is to plant in containers filled 
with sterilized potting soil. Colorado potato beetles also love eggplant 
leaves. Handpicking adults, crushing eggs, and spraying with B.t. San 
Diego will control the larval stage of this pest.

Leafy greens: Lettuce, Swiss chard, 
spinach, and friends
Leafy greens are easy crops to grow because you don’t have to wait for the 
flowers or fruits as with cucumbers or tomatoes — you just eat the leaves! 
Lettuce varieties are categorized by the way their leaves grow. Head lettuces, 
such as iceberg types, form compact balls of leaves. Looseleaf lettuces, at the 
other end of the spectrum, have loosely arranged leaves that don’t form tight 
heads. Other types, such as butterhead, romaine, and oakleaf, fall somewhere 
in between. Popular varieties include Buttercrunch looseleaf, Rosalita red 
Romaine, Summertime crisphead, and Red Salad Bowl looseleaf.
Other leafy vegetable garden staples include Swiss chard, spinach, and an 
array of less well-known salad and cooking greens. Swiss chard varieties include 
Ruby, Bright Lights (with an array of multicolored stems) and Fordhook 
Giant. Good spinach varieties are Space, Tyee, and Bloomsdale Longstanding.
In the specialty greens category, grow arugula, dandelion, cress, chicory, 
mache, and mustard to give salad a zippy flavor. Many of these greens are 
blended together in mixes called mesclun.
For Asian cooking, grow pac choi, tatsoi, and mizuna. You can add these 
leafy vegetables to stir-fries or mix them into the salad bowl. Pac choi forms 
a loose cluster of juicy stems and dark green leaves. Tatsoi grows in a low 
rosette of spoon-shaped leaves that will regrow if you cut the leaves. Mizuna 
has slender stalks and fringed leaves.
Here are the basics of growing leafy greens:
 
 Planting and care: Most are cool-season crops, so you want to sow 
seeds or set transplants outdoors a few weeks before the last frost date. 
You can start some leafy greens, such as lettuce, indoors 3 to 4 weeks 
before setting them outdoors, giving plants a jump on the growing 
season. Stagger your crops of greens by planting small patches a couple 
weeks apart throughout the season: These plants mature quickly, and 
you’ll want a consistent harvest of greens.
 
 Leafy greens need nitrogen first and foremost. Add compost before 
planting and add a supplemental nitrogen fertilizer, such as fish 
emulsion, every few weeks. Mulch the plants after they’re established 
with an organic hay or straw mulch to keep the soil cool and moist. Keep 
the plants well watered to help prevent leaf-tip burn on lettuce.

535
 Chapter 4: Raising Organic Vegetables and Herbs
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Harvesting: Harvest lettuce and greens when you’re hungry and 
whenever leaves are big enough to eat. Pick off the lower leaves first so 
that new, younger leaves will continue to grow from the center of the 
plant. When greens such as arugula and lettuce bolt (send up a flower 
stalk), the leaves are probably too bitter tasting for most tastes, and you 
should pull up and compost them.
 
 Pests and diseases: Snails and slugs can devour a patch in no time. You 
can trap them, set up barriers, bait them, and, of course, handpick them 
to keep the populations low. Rabbits and woodchucks can also be a 
problem and fencing is the best cure for them. Leaf miner insects, 
especially on spinach, can ruin individual leaves. Just pick off and 
destroy the damaged leaves and the plant will be fine. (See Chapter 3 for 
more about how to discourage and prevent pests.)
Legumes: Peas and beans
Legumes have a unique ability to make their own nitrogen fertilizer through 
a relationship with soil-dwelling bacteria called rhizobia. Beans enjoy warm 
weather, but peas produce better in cool weather.
You can eat beans fresh or allow the pods to mature for dry beans used in 
cooking. Popular dry bean varieties include Pinto, Yellow Eye, Midnight black 
turtle, and Red Kidney. Bean plants grow two different ways, either forming 
low bushy plants or climbing up a pole or trellis. In some cases, you can find 
pole and bush versions of the same variety. Good varieties include Blue Lake, 
Kentucky Wonder, Romano, and Improved Golden Wax bush beans and Blue 
Lake, Kentucky Wonder, Purple Pod, and Goldmarie pole beans.
Pea varieties also fall into two camps — those with edible pods and those 
grown just for fresh or dried seeds, called English peas. Good English pea 
varieties include Alderman, Daybreak, Lincoln, and Green Arrow. Peas with 
edible pods either have flat pods, called snow peas, or fat, juicy pods, called 
snap or sugar peas. Try Sugar Snap and Sugar Ann snap peas and Dwarf Gray 
Sugar for the classic snow peas used in stir-fries.
Check out the following tips for successful legume-growing:
 
 Planting and care: Legumes are easy to grow; sow them directly in 
well-drained soil. Plant beans when the soil has warmed to at least 60°F. 
Peas, however, need to be planted as soon as the soil has dried out in 
spring because they grow best before the summer heat arrives. Pole 
beans need poles for support, while tall pea varieties such as Sugar 
Snap, need a fence to climb. Keep the beds well weeded and watered. 
They generally don’t need supplemental fertilizer.

536
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Harvesting: Harvest bush and pole beans when the pods are about 6 
inches long and before the pods get bumpy from the seeds forming. 
Harvest dry beans after the pods have yellowed and withered. If they 
don’t dry in the garden, you can pull up the whole plants and hang them 
to dry in an airy garage.
 
 Harvest snap and English peas when the pods fill and are firm to the 
squeeze. Keep checking and tasting when the pods begin to size up to 
be sure you harvest at the peak of sweetness. Harvest snow peas at any 
point after the pods form.
 
 Pests and diseases: The Mexican bean beetle causes the most trouble. 
The adults are ladybug look-alikes, but they produce yellow colored 
young that love eating bean leaves. Handpick or use predatory insects, 
such as soldier bugs, to control them. Pea aphids attack pea plants and 
are easy to kill with just a stream of water from a hose. Watch out for 
rabbits and woodchucks — fences work best.
 
 Rust fungal disease attacks beans and spreads quickly, especially if you 
work in the bean patch while the leaves are still wet. The plants and 
beans will develop yellow colored spots, which can kill the plant. Clean 
up plant debris in fall and stay away from the bean patch in wet weather.
Peppers
Peppers are warm-weather crops and are generally grouped according to 
their taste — sweet or hot. Hot peppers contain a chemical, especially in the 
seeds and ribs, called capsaicin, which makes peppers hot. This chemical can 
get on your hands during harvesting and processing and, if you rub an open 
wound or your eyes, can cause a painful burning. Harvest hot peppers with 
gloves and wash your hands after preparing to remove any capsaicin. Some 
hot pepper varieties to try are Ancho, Hungarian Hot Wax, Super Cayenne, 
and Super Chili.
Sweet peppers lack the bite of their hot-seeded brethren. Both hot and 
sweet varieties come in a rainbow of colors when mature. Some sweet pepper 
varieties to try include bell-shaped Arianne, California Wonder, Golden 
Summer, and North Star. Some elongated-shaped sweet pepper varieties are 
Corno di Toro, Gypsy, and Sweet Banana.
 
Peppers are great plants for container growing. Some varieties, such as 
Pretty in Purple with its colorful purple to red fruit and purple-tinged stems 
and leaves, are very ornamental.
Follow these guidelines for perfect peppers:

537
 Chapter 4: Raising Organic Vegetables and Herbs
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Planting and care: Start seeds indoors 6 to 8 weeks before setting plants 
outside. Wait until the soil has warmed to 60°F before transplanting. 
Peppers need fertile soil and plenty of water to grow well. In cool areas, 
consider growing them in black fabric mulch to heat the soil and keep 
weeds away. Fertilize monthly with a complete fertilizer and add 1 
tablespoon of Epsom salts to the water to help the peppers grow better. 
However, don’t overfertilize peppers with nitrogen fertilizer, or you’ll 
have all foliage and few flowers and fruits.
 
 Harvesting: Pepper fruits turn a rainbow of colors, depending on the 
variety, as they mature. You can pick them at the green stage or let them 
mature, when they reach their sweetest flavor. Hot peppers also can 
be harvested at any stage, but the flavor is hotter and better developed 
when you allow the pepper to mature on the plant.
 
 Pests and diseases: The pepper maggot is one of the more frustrating 
pests on sweet peppers. The adult fly lays an egg on the developing 
fruits; the egg hatches into small, white worms that tunnel into the fruit 
and cause it to rot. Cover the plants with row covers early in the season 
to discourage the adult from laying eggs. Sprays are of little use because 
the worm is inside the fruit. Fruitworms (see the “Sweet corn” section) 
and wilt disease (see the “Eggplant” section) also cause trouble.
Root crops: Carrots, beets, and radishes
Root crops provide good eating well into the fall and winter and are easy to 
grow. Raised beds filled with loose, fertile, stone-free soil provide just the right 
environment. Some great carrot varieties to try include Scarlet Nantes, Danvers 
Half Long, Sweetness II, and Sweet Sunshine. Some good beet varieties include 
Detroit Dark Red, Ace, and Chioggia. A few choice radish varieties to grow 
include Easteregg, Cherry Belle, and French Breakfast.
Grow great root crops with these tips:
 
 Planting and care: To thrive, root crops generally need loose soil that’s 
well-amended with compost, weed-free growing conditions, and water. 
Directly sow root crop seeds a few weeks before the last frost date for 
your area. Sow them lightly and cover with sand, potting soil, or grass 
clippings and keep moist. Radishes germinate within a few days; carrots 
may take 2 weeks. Try mixing radish and carrot seeds to help mark the 
row and harvest the radishes before the carrots need the space.
 
 Thin seedlings so the eventual spacing is about 2 to 4 inches apart, 
depending on the crop. If you don’t thin root crops when they’re young, 
they won’t get large enough to eat. You can eat the thinned beet greens.

538
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Harvesting: Pull up radishes when the roots get large enough to eat. 
Leave carrots and beets in the ground to harvest as needed. Their flavor 
gets sweeter after the soil cools. You can even cover carrots in late fall 
with a cold frame, fill it with hay mulch, and harvest carrots all winter.
 
 Pests and diseases: Other than four-legged critters such as rabbits, 
which love to eat the carrot and beet tops, the biggest pest of carrot 
is the rust fly. The adult fly lays an egg near the carrot, and the small 
larvae tunnels into the carrot root. Cover the crop with a row cover to 
prevent the fly from laying an egg. Swallowtail butterfly larvae also like 
to munch on carrot tops, so try to grow enough for both of you!
Potatoes
Look for early-, mid-, and late-season potato varieties to stretch out your 
harvest. Early potatoes are ready to harvest about 65 days after planting — 
perfect for summer potato salads. Midseason varieties mature in 75 to 80 
days, and late ones take 90 days or more to harvest. The later varieties keep 
longer in storage. Potatoes are also roughly divided into baking and boiling 
varieties. Baking potatoes, such as Butte and Yukon Gold, have drier, more 
mealy-textured flesh, while boiling potatoes, such as Kennebec, Carola, and 
Red Norland, are moist and waxy.
If you’re looking for something new to try, plant fingerling potatoes. These 
varieties produce long, slim, tasty tubers and tend to yield more per pound 
planted than regular potatoes. Favorites include Russian Banana, which has 
yellow flesh and skin, and French Fingerling and Rose Finn Apple, which have 
pink skin and yellow flesh. Colorful varieties of regular potatoes include All 
Blue, All Red, and lavender-skinned Caribe.
Here’s the lowdown on growing potatoes:
 
 Planting and care: Potatoes are another cool season root crop that can 
be planted a few weeks before your last frost date. They grow rather 
unpretentiously and without much maintenance until late summer when 
you dig the roots. Potatoes grow best in loose soil that hasn’t been 
amended with fertilizer. Too much nitrogen fertilizer in particular can 
lead to poor tuber formation. Keep the soil moist by watering or applying 
organic mulches, such as hay or straw.
 
 Purchase potato tubers or seed potatoes and cut large potatoes into 
smaller pieces with at least one “eye” or bud. Place them in 1-foot deep 
trenches about 1 foot apart. Fill in the trench with soil as they sprout and 
grow, eventually mounding or hilling around the plants with soil. Hilling 
the soil around the plants allows the roots to form more potatoes, kills 
weeds, and protects the tubers from the light. Tubers exposed to light 
turn green (and in doing so produce mild toxins that can hurt you if you 
make a steady diet of green potatoes) and have an off flavor.

539
 Chapter 4: Raising Organic Vegetables and Herbs
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Harvesting: When the potato tops turn yellow and begin to die back, 
it’s time to dig up the tubers. With a shovel or iron fork, carefully dig 
around the potato plants and lift up the tubers. Let them cure in a dark, 
airy, 50°F-room for a few weeks, and then store them in a cool basement 
at about 40°F. Eat any damaged potatoes immediately and never store 
potatoes and apples near each other because apples give off ethylene 
gas, which causes potatoes and other vegetables to spoil.
 
 Pests and diseases: The Colorado potato beetle is the most famous pest. 
This yellow and black-striped beetle lays orange eggs on the undersides 
of leaves, which hatch into voracious orange-red larvae that devour 
potato and eggplant leaves. Handpick the adults and crush the eggs. 
Spray B.t. SanDiego to control the larvae. Wireworms attack potato 
tubers under ground, causing tunneling and rotting. They’re mostly a 
problem in new gardens created from lawns.
 
 Fungal diseases, such as potato scab and blight, can ruin a crop. Your 
first defense is to buy resistant varieties. Control potato scab by lowering 
the soil pH to below 6 and avoid using manure fertilizer. Control blight 
by planting your potato crop in a new place every year, buying certified 
disease-free tubers, mulching, and keeping weeds under control.
Sweet corn
As soon as you harvest corn, the sugars in the kernels begin to turn to starch, 
making the corn less sweet as time goes by. But many new sweet corn varieties 
stay sweeter longer after harvest because plant breeders breed them to contain 
supersweet characteristics. These varieties, which include Bodacious (yellow), 
Honey NPearl (bicolor), and How Sweet It Is (white), must be planted at least 
25 to 100 feet from other, nonsupersweet varieties. If another variety pollinates 
a supersweet variety, the kernels may be tough and starchy.
If you’re satisfied with regular, old-fashioned varieties, choose from those 
with yellow, white, or both-colored kernels called bicolor. If you plant yellow 
and white varieties near each other, you may get bicolor corn, anyway. Some 
favorites include Silver Queen (white) and Early Sunglow (yellow).
Corn requires the following care:
 
 Planting and care: Sweet corn needs a well-drained, highly fertile soil and 
warm weather to grow well. Sow seeds in blocks of 4 to 5 short rows after 
the soil has warmed to 65°F. Separate blocks of different corn varieties from 
each other by at least 25 feet so that no cross-pollination occurs. Hoe soil 
up around the plants when they’re 8 inches tall to support them during 
windy days and to destroy young weeds that compete with the corn plants. 
Fertilize at planting (with compost) and again when the corn is knee-high 
(with a high nitrogen fertilizer, such as soybean meal). Fertilize a final time 
with the same fertilizer when the silk emerges at the tips of the ears.

540
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Harvesting: Start checking for maturity when the corn ears feel full and 
the silks are brown. You can take a peek under the husks at the corn ear 
tip to see whether the kernels have matured. The kernels should still 
appear glossy, not dull, and any juice from pricking the kernel should be 
milky. Pick the ears on the young side for the sweetest and most tender 
flavor.
 
 Pests and diseases: Major corn pests include the corn earworm and 
corn borer. The earworm larvae tunnel into the tip of the corn ear, 
causing only cosmetic damage. The ear is still edible. Spray B.t. on the 
silks or apply a few drops of mineral oil when ears are young to kill the 
earworm larvae. Varieties with extra tight husks, such as Tuxedo, resist 
damage.
 
 The corn borer larva causes more major damage to a plant by tunneling 
into the leaves and stalk. B.t. sprays and crop rotation can lessen the 
problems from corn borers. Raccoons are the other major corn pests. 
An electric fence is the best — and maybe the only — defense against 
these clever animals.
Tomatoes
Tomato, easily the most popular garden vegetable, boasts varieties with fruit 
available in many sizes, shapes, and colors. The plants, however, fall into 
two categories. Determinate varieties stop growing taller when they reach 
a certain height and need minimal support, making them ideal for containers. 
Indeterminate varieties just keep on growing taller and taller, like Jack’s 
beanstalk! Indeterminate tomatoes require trellising, but yield more fruit per 
square foot of garden space.
Most gardeners grow tomatoes for three main purposes — slicing, snacks, 
and sauce. Some of the popular standard, round-shaped, slicing tomato 
varieties include Celebrity and Early Girl (red), Brandywine (pink), Lemon 
Boy (yellow), Big Rainbow (striped yellow and red), and Big Beef (red). For 
snacking, try cherry tomato varieties Sun Gold (gold), Super Sweet 100 (red), 
Sweet Million (red), and Yellow Pear (yellow). Great plum-shaped tomatoes, 
which gardeners use to make sauce, include Amish Paste, Roma, Bellstar, 
Heinz 2653, and Viva Italia.
Use the following guidelines for growing tomatoes:
 
 Planting and care: Tomatoes grow best when transplanted into 60°F soil 
and kept warm. Mulching with black landscape fabric in cool areas helps 
speed along their growth. They need fertile soil, so amend the soil with 
compost before planting and then side-dress plants monthly with a 
complete fertilizer. Keep plants mulched and well watered to avoid 
blossom end rot (rotting of the end of maturing tomatoes) as fruits 
mature.

541
 Chapter 4: Raising Organic Vegetables and Herbs
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Plant tall and leggy tomato transplants up to within 4 inches of their 
tops in a deep hole or lay them on their side in a trench, as shown in 
Figure 4-2, and the stem will root. Place a tomato cage or trellis support 
around the plants at planting time. Tie or wind indeterminate varieties 
around their supports as they grow and prune off extra side shoots to 
keep the plant from getting too bushy.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Plant leggy 
tomato 
transplants 
horizontally 
in a trench.
 
 
 Harvesting: Let the fruits turn red (or whatever color was intended). 
The longer you leave them on the vine, the deeper the color and sweeter 
and fuller the fruit flavor. However, even if you pick too early, fruits con-
tinue ripening indoors if you put them in a warm, airy room.
 
 Pests and diseases: The main insect pests are tomato hornworms and 
tomato fruitworms. You can control both of these caterpillars with B.t., 
although you can easily handpick hornworms. Nematodes can also 
attack tomato roots, causing the roots to be deformed and the plants 
to be stunted and unproductive. Choose nematode resistant varieties if 
these microscopic soil pests are a problem in your area.
 
 Leaf blight diseases often start as small spots on leaves and then 
expand to yellow areas, killing leaves and the plant if unchecked. To 
control these diseases, clean up crop debris at the end of the growing 
season, rotate crops and mulch to prevent the disease spores from 
splashing onto leaves during rains. Wilt diseases, such as Verticillium 
and Fusarium, can cause plants to suddenly wilt and die in midseason. 
Purchase plants that are wilt resistant (usually indicated in the variety 
description) and remove and destroy infected plants as soon as you can 
to prevent the disease from spreading.

542
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Vining crops: Cucumbers, squash, 
pumpkins, and melons
All these crops share the common trait of growing their fruits on long, trailing 
vines, although some varieties now grow more compact and bush-like. Many 
of these species can pollinate each other, too, making it nearly impossible to 
get seeds that grow fruit resembling the original varieties.
Cucumbers are classified as either slicers (long and thin) or picklers (short 
and prickly). Good slicing varieties include Fanfare and Suyo Long. For 
pickles, try Bush Pickle or Calypso.
Squash are grouped as either summer squash (for example, Black Zucchini, 
Sunburst patty pan, and Yellow Crookneck) or winter squash (Table King 
[acorn], Burgess Buttercup, and Waltham Butternut). Winter squash fruits 
develop hard skin and dense flesh, making them good for storing through the 
fall and early winter.
Pumpkins range in dimension from apple-sized to something resembling a 
small Volkswagen Beetle. Some are used for cooking, while others are better 
Organic seed sources
One way to support organic farming is to pur-
chase organically grown vegetable seeds for 
your garden. Some seed companies and mail-
order catalogs specialize in organic seeds or 
at least offer as many organically grown seed 
varieties as they can. Here are a few sources 
to get you started:
  Abundant Life Seed Foundation works 
to preserve heirloom seeds and promote 
sustainable agriculture worldwide. It offers 
seeds through its Web site and a mail-order 
catalog. Visit ALSF at its Web site (www.
abundantlifeseeds.com) for more 
information about its mission.
  Seeds of Change sells only organic, open-
pollinated seeds and plants and is dedi-
cated to preserving sustainable agriculture. 
Visit its informative Web site at www.seed
sofchange.com.
  Seed Savers Exchange is a not-for-profit 
organization that preserves and offers 
over 11,000 varieties of heirloom seeds 
through its membership exchange pro-
gram. Nonmembers can also order seeds 
through its catalog. Visit its Web site at 
www.seedsavers.org.
  Fedco Seeds is organized as a cooperative 
with workers and customers sharing in their 
profits. It sells seeds, potato tubers, and lots 
of gardening supplies. In its very informa-
tive and extensive catalog, it discloses the 
sources of the seeds it offers, some of which 
are grown specifically for the coopera-
tive. Download a catalog from the co-op’s 
Web site, www.fedcoseeds.com.

for carving and ornament. For pies and soup, grow New England Pie, Baby 
Pam, or Small Sugar. For carving, Howden and Connecticut Field are among the 
standards. Grow Atlantic Giant or Big Max for the big pumpkin contest at the 
county fair.
And finally, a few good melons include Earli-Dew and Burpee Hybrid 
muskmelon, Crimson Sweet and yellow-fleshed Yellow Doll watermelon, and 
French Orange, a muskmelon/Charentais cross. Cantaloupes, by the way, 
have smoother skins and smaller seed cavities than muskmelons, but they 
taste pretty much the same. Charentais are orange-fleshed French melons 
that resemble muskmelons. For something delicious and unusual, grow 
green-fleshed Passport cantaloupe.
Here are tips for vining crops:
 
 Planting and care: These warm-weather crops need heat, water, and 
fertility to grow best. Directly sow these vegetables 1 to 2 weeks after 
your last frost date when the soil is at least 60°F. In colder areas, start 
seedlings indoors 3 to 4 weeks before setting them outdoors.
 
 Even though many bush varieties are available, most squash-family 
plants need room to spread their vines, so space them according to seed 
packet instructions. Amend the soil at planting with a layer of compost 
and side-dress the plants with a complete fertilizer when they start 
vining. Keep the plants well watered.
 
 Squash-family crops need bees to pollinate the flowers in order to get 
fruit. Plant bee-attracting flowers around the garden to ensure fruit 
pollination. If fruits form but rot and drop off before enlarging, it’s 
probably due to poor pollination.
 
 Harvesting: Pick cucumbers when they are 4 to 6 inches long, before 
the seeds enlarge. Harvest summer squash when they’re small and the 
flowers are still attached for best flavor and to keep the plants producing 
well. Harvest winter squash and pumpkins when the varieties turn the 
desired color and your thumbnail can’t puncture the skin when pressed.
 
 Harvest muskmelons when they easily slip off the vine when lifted. 
Watermelons are harvested when the skin color turns from shiny to dull 
and the spot where it rests on the ground turns from white to yellow. 
Also, check the last tendril (curlicues coming off the stems) before the 
fruit. When it turns brown, it’s harvest time. Protect all squash family 
plants and fruits from frost.
 
 Pests and diseases: Squash-family vegetables have their own whole set 
of insects and diseases — many named after the plants they attack. The 
most prominent ones include
 
• Cucumber beetles, which are yellow and black-striped
 
• Spotted beetles, which feed on young cucumbers, melons, and 
squash

544
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
• Squash vine borers, which attack mostly squash and pumpkins
 
• Squash bugs (turn to Chapter 7 for more detailed information on 
these bad guys)
 
 Bacterial wilt disease attacks mostly cucumber and melons. The plants 
wilt during the day and are slow to recover even if well watered. Control 
this disease by planting resistant varieties and controlling cucumber 
beetles that spread the disease.

Dummies by Charlie Nardozzi and the Editors of the National Gardening 
Association (Wiley).
Growing and Using Herbs
How and where you choose to grow herbs is limited only by your imagination 
and, of course, the needs and characteristics of the plants themselves. Most 
herb plants aren’t too fussy about the soil they grow in as long as it’s well 
drained. Soggy soil spells trouble for herbs, but young plants need moisture 
after transplanting until they begin growing vigorously. Water mature plants 
during times of drought to prevent wilting and stress. If you’re growing herbs 
simply for their ornamental flowers or foliage, give them fertile garden soil. 
Herbs grown for fragrance and flavor, however, are more pungent if grown in 
less fertile soil, so go easy on the fertilizer.
You can fit herbs into your garden and landscape in myriad ways. Tuck herbs 
into your flower garden, plant them among your vegetables, or give them a 
special garden of their own. Take advantage of their flowers or leaves to add 
spark to container gardens and window boxes. Use creeping kinds between 
paving stones or let them trail over retaining walls. Even if you’re challenged 
for space, you can grow some herbs on a sunny windowsill as houseplants. If 
you need a few ideas on where to grow herbs, here’s a list for inspiration:
 
 Herb garden: Take an herbs-only approach and design an intricately 
patterned garden. A typical arrangement consists of a geometric border 
of tidy, compact plants, such as basil or lavender, which surrounds 
groupings of herbs with contrasting foliage colors and textures. For a 
simple, utilitarian herb garden, try a four-patch design that features four 
same-size triangles, squares, or rectangles separated by 2-foot walkways.
 
 Ground cover: Creeping herbs, such as thyme and mint, can cover large 
areas quickly or fill in the gaps between stones in a path. Let them trail 
over a wall to add color and soften the effect of the stone.

545
 Chapter 4: Raising Organic Vegetables and Herbs
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 Vegetable gardens: Some herbs make natural companions for vegetable 
plants. Basil, for example, is said to improve tomatoes, while dill and 
cabbages complement each other. Stick to well-behaved herbs that don’t 
spread by roots or rhizomes, however, or else your garden may be 
overrun by too much of a good thing.
 
 Flower gardens: Many herbs have beautiful flowers or foliage that add 
color and texture to flower borders. As a bonus, some attract butterflies 
and provide food for their larva. Good additions to your flower garden 
include catnip, lavender, chamomile, borage, and oregano.
 
 Containers: Treat them as ornamental plants or bring your culinary 
herbs closer to the kitchen by planting them in pots, tubs, or baskets. Use 
trailing thyme or rosemary to hang over the side and add colorful sages, 
parsley, oregano, and chives. In cold climates, grow tender herbs, such as 
rosemary and bay, in pots that you can bring indoors for the winter. Be 
sure to give these Mediterranean-climate plants 14 to 16 hours of bright 
light year ’round to keep them happy. Be careful to keep the soil moist, 
but never soggy.
Although many herbs are ornamental,  most people grow them to harvest. 
Most herbs have fragrant or pungently flavored leaves or flowers that make 
them useful for cooking, crafts, and potpourri and adding aroma to cosmetics. 
Some have attractive stems, leaves, or other plant parts that can be dried or 
preserved for wreaths and arrangements. Consider the following ways to use 
harvested herbs:
 
 Food and drink: Herbal teas, from soothing chamomile to refreshing mint, 
offer alternatives to stronger brews, and no supper is complete without 
seasonings for soup and salad, meat, and vegetable. Indispensable edible 
herbs include basil, chives, coriander, dill, horseradish, marjoram, mint, 
oregano, parsley, sage, and thyme.
 
 Fragrance: Homes and people haven’t always smelled as pleasant as 
they do today. In the days before frequent bathing, central vacuum 
cleaners, and indoor plumbing, herbs played a large role in odor control. 
Sweet Annie, peppermint, chamomile, and lavender, for example, can 
scent a room or a closet, masking the odors of cooking, wet dogs, or any 
other smelly aroma. Aromatherapy, the art and science of affecting mood 
with scent, makes liberal use of dried herbs in little pillows and bowls of 
potpourri.
 
 Crafts: Dried wreaths, arrangements, and other crafts depend on herbs 
for color, structure, and fragrance. The long silvery stems of artemesia, 
for example, make excellent wreath foundations. Dried lavender flower 
spikes add elegance to everlasting arrangements. Some herbs lend their 
colors to fabric and paints.

 Medicine: People have used herbs to treat every ailment known to 
mankind. Many herbs do contain chemicals, such as those used for 
heart medicine and to treat pain. Laymen can safely use aromatic herbs 
to add zip or tranquilizing effects to ointments, massage oils, and baths. 
Check out Herbal Remedies For Dummies (Wiley) by Christopher Hobbs 
to find more ways to use herbs as medicines.
Another, often overlooked way to use herbs is as landscape and garden 
plants. They serve several important functions:
 
 Ornament: Flowers, attractive leaves, and shapes from sprawling to 
towering give herbs a place in any garden. Several varieties of sage, for 
example, have colorful golden, purple, white, or gray-green leaves. Rue 
and compact artemesia varieties with silvery leaves are prized in 
decorative herb gardens.
 
 Companion plants: Some herbs reputably aid the growth of other plants 
by repelling insect pests, discouraging disease, and helping nutrients 
become more readily available. Members of the onion family, such as 
chives, for example, may keep bugs away from roses and other flowers.
 
 Insect habitat: Most insects are good for your garden, so it pays to 
encourage them to come on in and stay awhile. Herbs with small, 
nectar-rich flowers, such as dill, fennel, thyme, caraway, and parsley, 
attract some of the most important beneficial insects.
Planting Popular Herbs
Useful herbs number in the hundreds, at least. This section highlights a few 
of the most commonly grown herbs, providing tips for tending and using 
herbs from basil to thyme.
Basil
Easily one of the most popular culinary herbs grown, basil is an annual that 
comes in more than 30 varieties that include both ornamental and tasty 
forms. For plenty of pesto, grow sweet basil varieties, such as Mammoth or 
Large Leaf, in your vegetable garden. Or try some with unusual foliage, such 
as purple-leafed Dark Opal and Purple Ruffles or frilly Green Ruffles. To edge 
a garden or spice up a patio planter, grow compact, small-leafed varieties, 
such as Spicy Globe or Green Globe. For an alternative taste sensation, grow 
lemon, anise, cinnamon, and Thai basil varieties.

 Planting and care: Give basil moist, fertile, well-drained soil and space 
plants about 1 foot apart in full sun. Water them in dry weather and 
pinch off young flower buds to prevent bloom and encourage more 
leaves. Sow seeds directly in the garden or start indoors and protect 
from frost, which will kill basil.
 
 Special uses: Plant with tomatoes to discourage tomato hornworms. Dry 
the leaves or use fresh to flavor food.
Chamomile
Choose from 2- to 3-foot-tall German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) or 
creeping, 9-inch Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile), depending on 
your garden desires. The perennial Roman species is hardy through Zone 3 
and thrives in cool, damp climates. German chamomile is an annual. Both 
plants have lacy, aromatic, apple-scented foliage and small, daisy-like flowers.
 
 Planting and care: Sow seeds directly in the garden and keep moist until 
well established. Chamomile can tolerate some drought after that and 
appreciates full sun. Harvest the flowers when fully open and dry them 
on screens in an airy place. Plants self-sow prolifically, so after you plant 
some, you’ll have chamomile for a long time.
 
 Special uses: The dried flowers make a popular tea for relieving stress 
and heartburn. They’re also used in many cosmetics and toiletries. 
Roman chamomile makes an excellent ground cover or mowed lawn in 
mild, moist climates similar to England or the Pacific Northwest.
Chives
Grassy, onion-flavored foliage make  chives popular in the culinary arts, 
but this perennial plant makes a good 1-foot-tall addition to the ornamental 
landscape and vegetable garden, too. The dense tufts of lavender-purple 
flowers bloom in early summer. The related species, garlic chives, grows 
about 2 feet tall and has starry white flowers in late summer to early fall. 
Both species self-sow freely.
 
 Planting and care: The best way to obtain chives is to divide a clump 
into groups of slender bulbs and plant in any well-drained garden soil. 
It prefers full sun, but isn’t fussy. If you sow from seed, cover the seeds 
lightly with soil, keep moist, and be patient — they may take 2 to 3 
weeks to sprout. Keep weeds away to make harvesting easier. Harvest 
by shearing the stems to within a few inches of the ground.

548
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Special uses: The pungent foliage reportedly repels some injurious 
pests, especially around roses, tomatoes, carrots, grapes, and apples. 
Puree the leaves in the blender with water, strain, and use as a spray to 
prevent powdery mildew. The flowers attract beneficial insects. Use in 
cooking as you would onions or serve fresh in salads, dips, and sauces.
Coriander and cilantro
This herb is so versatile that it bears two names — cilantro for the roots and 
leaves and coriander for the seeds. The flat, parsley-like leaves add pungency 
to Latin American and Asian dishes. The seeds play a major role in curry and 
other Middle Eastern fare. It’s an annual herb that ancient Mediterranean 
people prescribed for many medical ailments.
 
 Planting and care: Sow directly into fertile garden soil where seeds will 
sprout in a couple of weeks. Plant every 2 to 3 weeks for continuous 
harvest because the plants tend to set seed quickly, especially in hot 
weather, and stop producing new foliage. Harvest young tender leaves 
before the plants send up flower stalks. Harvest seeds when seed heads 
turn brown, but before they scatter, and dry thoroughly before using for 
best flavor.
 
 Special uses: Use leaves and seeds in cooking. Plant near aphid-prone 
crops to help repel pests. The flowers also attract beneficial insects.
Dill
Another member of the  aromatic carrot family, dill’s seeds are an essential 
ingredient in pickles, breads, and other savory dishes. The fine, thread-like 
foliage is rich in vitamins and flavor for fish, sauces, and dips. Tall, narrow 
plants of this annual herb grow 2 to 3 feet tall. Choose the variety Bouquet 
for seeds or Dukat or 18-inch-tall Fernleaf if you want mainly leaves.
 
 Planting and care: Sow seeds directly into fertile, sunny garden soil. 
Barely cover the seeds and sow again every few weeks for continuous 
harvest. Protect from strong winds.
 
 Special uses: Flowers attract beneficial insects and the foliage is a 
favorite of swallowtail butterfly larvae. It reputedly makes a good 
companion for cabbage crops and can be planted with low-growing 
lettuce and cucumbers. Use seeds and leaves in cooking.

Fennel
Useful in cooking and in the garden, 4- to 8-foot-tall fennel has a tropical 
look and resembles giant dill plants. The common fennel is hardy in Zones 
6 through 9, but you can grow it as an annual in cooler climates. It self-sows 
and can become a nuisance weed in warm climates. Try the bronze-red-leafed 
variety Purpureum as an ornamental plant. If you want to eat the root, look 
for the annual or biennial plant called finocchio or Florence fennel.
 
 Planting and care: Sow directly in fertile, sunny soil where you want it 
to grow. Its long taproot makes it difficult to transplant. Protect from 
strong wind.
 
 Special uses: You can use all parts of fennel — from the bulb-like root 
to the leaves, stalks, and seeds. Harvest seeds when they turn brown 
and snip leaves and stems as needed and use fresh or cooked lightly in 
soups and sauces. Flowers attract many beneficial insects.
Lavender
One of the most recognized and popular scents for cosmetics, toiletries, and 
aromatherapy, lavender also adds drama to your flower garden. A number of 
different species exist, but all have needle-like foliage and spikes of purplish 
blue flowers. The English lavender varieties, such as purple Hidcote and 
Munstead, grow up to 24 inches high and are hardy through Zone 5. Pink-
flowering varieties include Hidcote Pink and Miss Katherine. Other species 
are less hardy, but equally appealing and include spike, French, and fringed 
lavenders.
 
 Planting and care: Start from stem cuttings because seeds may not 
give you plants of uniform quality. Plant in compost-enriched, very 
well-drained, even gravelly soil in full sun. Space plants 2 to 3 feet apart 
for a low hedge or mass planting. Prune in early spring to encourage 
bushy growth.
 
 Special uses: Harvest flowers as they begin to open. Dry them in bundles 
hung upside down in an airy place. Flowers attract bees and beneficial 
insects.

550
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Mint
With 20 or so species and more than 1,000 varieties, you should find a mint 
to suit any taste. Peppermint and spearmint are the most popular, but other 
fruit-flavored varieties exist. Some also have variegated foliage, including 
pineapple mint Varieagata. Some mints creep along low to the ground, such 
as Corsican mint, and others grow 2 to 3 feet tall. Hardiness varies with the 
variety and species.
 
 Planting and care: Start new plants from stem cuttings of the varieties 
you want so that you’re sure to get the flavor or scent you expect. Plant 
just below the soil surface and keep them moist until they begin to grow. 
Mints can be invasive, so contain them or plant where you don’t mind a 
carpet of fragrant foliage.
 
 Special uses: Harvest the fresh leaves and add them to Middle Eastern 
dishes, soups, vegetables, and beverages. Mint flowers attract beneficial 
insects, and the fragrant plants reportedly repel some damaging insects 
and improve the health and flavor of nearby cabbages and tomatoes.
Oregano
Small fragrant leaves on sprawling 1 to 2-foot stems topped by loose  spikes of 
white to pink flowers give oregano a casual appeal for planting in vegetable 
and flower gardens or trailing over a wall or basket. Choose plants care-
fully by pinching a leaf to test flavor and pungency. Some varieties, such as 
Aureum Crispum and Compactum are more ornamental than edible. It’s a 
hardy perennial in Zones 5 and warmer.
 
 Planting and care: Start new plants from stem cuttings to guarantee the 
best flavor. Seed-grown plants may lack their parents’ pungent flavor. 
Any average, well-drained soil in full sun will do. Harvest leaves as 
needed or cut the plant down to a few inches from the ground and hang 
the sprigs to dry.
 
 Special uses: The tiny flower clusters attract bees, butterflies, and other 
beneficial insects. The fresh and dried leaves add classic flavor to many 
Latin American and Mediterranean dishes. Some varieties look good in 
hanging baskets, patio containers, and flower gardens.

551

Parsley
A common garnish on restaurant plates, parsley is probably the most 
recognized herb. The leaves contain loads of vitamins A and C and help 
sweeten garlic breath. Although both varieties are edible, the flat-leafed 
variety has stronger flavor while the curly-leafed kind is more commonly 
used as garnish. Plants are biennial, hardy through Zone 5, and bloom only 
in their second year. The 1-foot-tall plants form tidy bright green mounds of 
ornamental foliage. Plant in vegetable and flower gardens or in container 
gardens.
 
 Planting and care: Soak seeds overnight before sowing and plant 
directly in the garden. If you start seeds indoors, plant them in peat pots 
(biodegradable compressed peat moss containers) so that you don’t 
have to disturb their taproot when transplanting them later. Give the 
plants fertile garden soil and a cool, slightly shady spot in hot summer 
climates. Snip fresh leaves as needed or cut the whole plant to a few 
inches high and dry the leaves on screen.
 
 Special uses: Use for cooking, especially in Greek and Middle Eastern 
dishes. Makes an attractive ornamental garden plant and serves as food 
for swallowtail butterfly larvae. Flowers attract beneficial insects.
Rosemary
Two species of this tender perennial evergreen shrub exist — upright and 
prostrate — and both are fragrant and edible. The short, needle-like foliage 
gives off a heady, distinctive aroma when lightly bruised. Ornamental varieties 
include those with golden or variegated leaves, pink or bright blue flowers, and 
especially sprawling or upright forms.
 
 Planting and care: Start from rooted stem cuttings and plant in well-
drained garden soil. Rosemary doesn’t tolerate soggy soil or complete 
drought. Although hardy only to Zone 8, you can grow rosemary in a 
greenhouse or indoors under strong light. Plant it in a pot at least 1 foot 
deep to accommodate its taproot and maintain humidity by setting it 
over moist pebbles or misting the plant a few times a week.
 
 Special uses: As an ornamental, rosemary excels in the low shrub 
border or trailing over a low wall. Its aromatic foliage is said to repel 
flying insects from cabbages and other vegetables. Use fresh sprigs 
in meat stews; use dried rosemary for either culinary use or to scent 
rooms and linens.

552
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Sage
In Zones 5 and warmer, sage is a perennial that grows into a shrubby mound 
of fragrant leaves. It can grow up to 2 feet tall. The 2- to 3-inch-long leaves are 
fuzzy and oval and range in color from silver-green, purple, golden to mixed 
white, green, and pink, depending on the variety. Sage is equally at home in 
the herb garden and amongst the ornaments in a container or flowerbed. In 
late spring, sage has spikes of blue flowers, although some varieties have 
white flowers. A number of different sage species exist and they range in 
hardiness, pungency, and size. A favorite, pineapple sage is only winter hardy 
to Zone 8, but its soft-textured, fruity pineapple-scented foliage and red 
flowers make a beautiful addition to a flower garden.
 
 Planting and care: Starting sage from stem cuttings is easier than 
starting from seeds. Plant in organically rich, well-drained garden soil 
and give it full sun. Avoid soggy soil. Prune to keep the growth compact.
 
 Special uses: The spiky flowers attract bees and other beneficial insects 
and look great in the garden. Use it to scent dresser drawers and to help 
prevent damaging clothes moths. Use the leaves, either fresh or dried, in 
poultry and meat dishes.
Thyme
Hundreds of thyme species and varieties exist and they range in height from 
creeping, 1-inch-high mats to 18-inch shrubs. They all have tiny, roundish 
leaves, and their colors range from wooly gray to smooth green to golden 
to white-edged. Even their fragrance varies from very mild to pungent and 
includes lemon, caraway, coconut, and more. Creeping thyme makes a 
fragrant and attractive groundcover and excels between paving stones, while 
shrubby types are useful low hedges. Clusters of tiny white, pink, or crimson 
flowers bloom in summer, sometimes covering the plants. The creeping 
thymes are the hardiest and survive in Zone 4.
 
 Planting and care: Start with rooted stem cuttings to guarantee the 
flavor and appearance of your thyme. Plant in organically enriched, 
well-drained soil in full sun. Divide the plants every few years and keep 
them pruned to encourage dense growth.
 
 Special uses: Flowers attract bees and many beneficial insects. Much 
folklore exists on the use of thyme as a helpful companion plant for 
roses and vegetables. Use between patio and walkway stones or plant 
as a groundcover to replace lawn in small areas. The trailing kinds look 
good in hanging baskets and planters. Harvest the leaves and young 
stems for cooking.

F
ew plants give  you more bang for your buck than berries. Homegrown 
raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and grapes take little space and 
return months of mouthwatering fruit salads, pies, pancakes, and fresh-eating 
goodness. Some of these berries are easy to grow organically, while others 
present a real challenge. Choosing disease-resistant varieties, using pest and 
disease control methods, and planting correctly goes a long way toward pro-
ducing healthful, pesticide-free berries.
Freshly picked fruit  from your own trees and shrubs is juicy joy — and easier 
to grow than you may think. Sure, some fruit trees need more attention than 
many other plants, but the harvest is worth the effort. Many fruit varieties 
that you can grow at home taste far better than supermarket fruit.
Better flavor is reason  enough to grow your own fruit. But if you’re concerned 
about pesticides, you have another compelling reason, as well. Cherries, 
peaches, apples, strawberries, and apricots are among the 12 most pesticide-
contaminated foods, according the Environmental Working Group, compiled 
from FDA and EPA data (www.njenvironment.org/organicproduce.htm).
Even if you have nothing more than a large patio planter, you can grow your 
own fruit; on a half-acre lot, you can plant an orchard large enough to pro-
vide fruit for yourself and half the neighborhood. As a bonus, most fruit trees 
and shrubs are ornamental, too, especially when blooming.

554

Finding Your Zone
Unlike vegetables, most fruit plants come back year after year, which means 
you need to choose the right plant for where you live. (Forget about growing 
pomegranates in Vermont, for example.)
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) divided North America, 
Europe, and China into 11 zones based on each area’s expected aver-
age annual minimum temperature — its hardiness zone. The USDA Plant 
Hardiness Zone Map for North America (see Figure 5-1) enables you to find 
your hardiness zone, which you can find on plant tags and in the information 
throughout this section.

Discovering Berry Patch Basics
 
Site selection and preparation are more  critical with berries than with nearly 
any other food crop you may grow because most of these plants stay in place 
for years. The varieties you choose, where you plant them, and how you 
prepare and maintain the soil determine whether your berry patch produces 
bumper crops or becomes a disappointing chore.

555
 Chapter 5: Finding Organic Success with Fruit
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
As you make decisions about where to plant your berry patch, keep in mind 
the following requirements:
 
 Sun: All fruits need at least 6 hours — preferably more — of full sun 
each day to produce large, flavorful crops.
 
 Air circulation and drainage: Moving air helps prevent disease organ-
isms from settling on vulnerable fruits and leaves, so choose a slightly 
breezy site, if possible. High winds cause damage, however, so protect 
crops with a windbreak, if needed.
 
 Cold air settles at the bottom of slopes, where it may damage early 
blooming flowers in the spring or ripening fruit in the fall. Plant your 
fruits on the slope of a hill instead of at the bottom.
 
 Soil moisture and drainage: With the exception of elderberry, all small 
fruits need well-drained soil. Soggy soil encourages root diseases, which 
are among the most serious problems for fruits. If your soil drains 
poorly, however, you can still grow fruits in raised beds. Make beds 6 to 
10 inches high and 4 feet wide and amend with plenty of organic matter.
 
 Soil amendments and fertility: Fruiting plants need fertile, moist, richly 
organic soil to produce the best crops. Improve the soil with several 
inches of compost or composted manure and any needed pH amend-
ments and nutrients before planting. If you must significantly alter the 
soil pH, allow several months to a year before you plant. Do a soil test 
for pH and fertility before you plant and again each year, especially if 
fruits fail to produce well or plants look stressed. See Chapter 2 of this 
book for more on soils and drainage.
 
 Locally adapted varieties: Some  plant varieties grow better in particular 
situations than other varieties. Check with your local extension office 
(find yours at www.csrees.usda.gov/Extension/) or nurseries in 
your area for recommendations.
 
Plant your fruits close to the kitchen door, garage, or some other place that 
you visit daily. Frequent inspection helps you see potential pests and dis-
eases before they become a problem. Picking and maintenance feel like less 
of a chore, too, when the patch is just outside the door. Many of these plants 
can also do double duty as landscape specimens — use them in mixed bor-
ders and foundation plantings whenever you can.
Controlling weeds
Controlling weeds  is critical for small fruits because they have shallow roots 
that can’t compete for water and nutrients with more aggressive weeds. 

556
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Weeds also harbor insect pests that feed on your fruits. Weed control needs 
a double-barreled approach to succeed:
 
 Before you plant: Get rid of weeds completely before you plant your 
fruits and allow yourself plenty of time. If you have a year to prepare, 
grow weed-smothering cover crops and till them into the soil. Got only a 
few months? Use soil solarization with clear plastic.
 
 After planting: Mulch, mulch, and mulch again. Use materials that add 
organic matter to the soil as they decompose. Pull individual weeds by 
hand and hoe only in footpaths.
Weeding a mature berry patch is a strenuous chore because most of these 
plants have shallow roots that don’t allow cultivation or grow in such a way 
that handpulling each weed is the only solution. Weeding thorny brambles is 
an especially onerous job. Using a propane-powered flame weeder can make 
this job easier. See Chapter 3 of this book for details.
Buying plants
Buying the best quality plants  that you can find really pays off. If you’re for-
tunate enough to have a local nursery that grows its own fruit plants, by all 
means, pay them a visit. They usually offer the best varieties for your area 
and can give you valuable advice on growing them in your particular situa-
tion. Local nurseries usually sell potted plants, which transplant well, pro-
vided that they’ve been well cared for and not allowed to dry out before you 
buy them.
Specialty mail-order nurseries are often the best source of virus-free, disease-
resistant fruits in many parts of the country. They carry the widest selec-
tion and usually offer the most complete description of each variety and its 
requirements. When shopping for virus-prone fruits, such as raspberries and 
strawberries, buy only those guaranteed to be virus-free. Read the catalog 
carefully to find varieties that resist common diseases. Your local extension 
office can give you a list of recommendations.
 
A last piece of advice from someone who’s been there and done that — don’t 
plant more than you have time to harvest and maintain. It’s easy to get 
excited about all the promising fruits that you can grow and end up buying 
more plants than you need.

Presenting Popular Small Fruits
Growing berries is one of my most rewarding gardening activities. The season 
begins with strawberries. Then, raspberries, blueberries, and grapes ripen in 
succession through the summer and early fall. Pick your own favorites from 
this chapter and get growing!
Beautiful blueberry
As an ornamental plant, blueberry (Vaccinium species) offers small white 
flowers in spring, glossy green leaves in summer, and spectacular crimson 
fall foliage. As an edible fruit, it can’t be beat for fresh eating, pies, pancakes, 
dessert sauce, and jam. Blueberries grow in Zones 3 to 10, but the species 
and best varieties vary from one extreme to the other:
 
 Lowbush blueberry (V. angustifolium) is the hardiest  for Zones 3 to 6. 
These 8- to 18-inch tall plants form spreading mats and produce small, 
intensely flavored berries. Grow them as ground-covering landscape 
plants in well-drained acidic soil and enjoy the fruits as a bonus or leave 
them for wildlife. Prune only to remove dead, damaged, or diseased 
plants. Varieties include ‘Northsky’ and ‘Putte’.
 
 Highbush blueberry (V. corymbosum and hybrids) can grow from 
Zones 4 to 10, but  some varieties are better suited to either extreme. 
Choose highbush blueberries for plenty of large, flavorful, easy to pick 
fruit. Shrubs grow 2 to 6 feet tall and produce more fruit when you 
plant at least two different varieties. In the northern United States, try 
‘Bluecrop’, ‘Blueray’, ‘Earliblue’, ‘Northblue’, ‘Patriot’, and ‘Northland’. In 
the south, plant ‘Gulf Coast’, ‘Misty’, ‘O’Neill’, and ‘Reveille’.
 
 Flower buds, which appear larger and rounder than leaf buds, form in 
the summer the year before they bloom. Prune in late winter to remove 
unproductive canes, leaving the most vigorous 15 to 18 canes.
 
 Rabbiteye blueberry (V. ashei) grow in the warmer Zones 7 through 
9. Growing up to 10 feet tall, the  varieties of this species have thicker-
skinned berries. You need to plant two different but compatible varieties 
to get fruit. Good  companions include ‘Beckyblue’ and ‘Bonitablue’ or 
‘Powderblue’ and ‘Tifblue’.

558
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
Blueberries  belong to a group of plants that have very specific soil needs, 
including a lot of decomposed organic matter and an acidic pH of 4.5 to 5.2. 
They grow where azaleas and rhododendrons naturally thrive, but you can 
also alter your soil with acidifying peat moss and sulfur to accommodate their 
needs. It takes at least six months to a year or more for amendments to signifi-
cantly lower soil pH, so plan ahead and test the soil before planting. Test on 
an annual basis and amend your soil as necessary to maintain the pH level you 
want. See Chapter 2 of this book for more on soil amendments and pH.
All blueberries have shallow roots and need moist, well-drained soil. Mix ½ 
cubic foot of peat moss per plant into the soil at planting time. Cover the soil 
around the shrubs with organic mulch, such as pine needles, shredded oak 
leaves, or hardwood bark, to maintain the soil moisture and prevent weeds. 
Keep the soil moist throughout the growing season. Avoid deep cultivation.
 
Blueberries have relatively few serious pests  or diseases, but good sanitation 
practices are a must. Mummy berry fungus causes trouble in some areas and 
spreads from fallen fruit. You can avoid other fungus diseases by pruning to 
encourage air circulation through the plant and keeping the foliage dry. Birds 
are the most serious pest — cover the plants completely with bird netting 
before the  berries turn blue.
Ramblin’ brambles
If you love fresh raspberries or blackberries, you’ll be glad to know how   easy 
they are to grow. These delicate and perishable fruits are expensive in the 
market, but you can plant your own small patch and produce enough for 
fresh eating and freezing, too.
When planning your patch of brambles (as these fruits are known), follow 
the instructions in the “Discovering Berry Patch Basics” section, earlier in 
this chapter. Pay special attention to air circulation and soil drainage. Taking 
weed-control precautions before you plant is also important because most 
brambles sport hooked thorns that make weeding the mature plants difficult 
and shallow roots that hoes easily damage. Raised beds work well with bram-
bles. Allow at least 8 feet between rows of plants. Don’t plant where other 
brambles or potatoes, tomatoes, or eggplant have grown in recent years due 
to risk of Verticillium root disease infection. It’s also best to eliminate nearby 
wild brambles, if possible, because they often spread disease. (For more on 
plant diseases, see Chapter 3 of this book.)
Brambles range in growth habit from upright to sprawling — some stand up 
on their own, but most need trellis supports to keep the fruiting canes off the 
ground. A typical arrangement consists of a T-shaped post and crosspiece at 
either end of the row with taut wires or heavy twine running between them 
down the length of the row. You can also tie trailing varieties of blackberry to 
wire fence or other flat support.

559
 Chapter 5: Finding Organic Success with Fruit
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
Shoots called canes grow from either the roots or crown  of the plant. 
Brambles are biennial, which means that plants flower on second-year canes, 
which subsequently die. Canes are called primocanes the first year they 
sprout and floricanes in their second year. Floricanes die after fruiting and 
should be pruned out. Most raspberries and blackberries produce fruit only 
on the floricanes and are called summer-bearing, but some raspberry variet-
ies, often referred to as everbearing, also produce on primocanes in the  fall. 
Although most raspberries produce red berries, some varieties have yellow 
or purple fruit.
Depending  on your personal preference and climate, you can choose from 
several bramble types and many different varieties for your garden:
 
 Red raspberries: This  delicate fruit grows best in cool climates. Most 
varieties bear one crop per year, but others produce  two.
 
 Prune summer-bearing raspberries twice a year. After summer fruiting, 
remove all the floricanes. In early spring, prune out winter-damaged 
and weak canes, leaving about 3 to 4 vigorous canes per square foot or 
roughly 6 to 9 inches between canes. Cut these remaining canes back to 
about 3 to 4 feet high, as shown in Figure 5-2. You can treat the everbear-
ing types similarly or prune all the canes to the ground in late autumn or 
early spring. This severe pruning forfeits the summer crop, but yields a 
bumper crop in autumn.
 
 Summer-bearing  red varieties include ‘Latham’, ‘Boyne’, ‘Killarney’, 
‘Milton’, ‘September’, ‘Canby’ (nearly thornless), and ‘Nordic’. 
Everbearing varieties include ‘Heritage’, ‘Autumn Bliss’, and 
‘Indian Summer’. Yellow varieties include ‘Fall Gold’, ‘Amber’, and 
‘Honeyqueen’. Purple varieties share red and black raspberry parentage 
and may resemble either one. ‘Royalty’ is the most common variety.
 
 Black raspberries, black caps: The  fruits of this plant have a rich flavor 
and lack the core that characterizes blackberries. Plants grow new pri-
mocanes from the crown instead of the roots, and thus are easier to con-
tain within a row because they don’t grow shoots several feet from the 
mother plant as red raspberries do. Plant 3 feet apart in raised hills.
 
 To control their length and encourage lateral branches or side shoots to
form, prune 3 to 4 inches off the primocane tips when they reach 24 
to 30 inches high in mid-summer. The following spring, prune the lat-
eral side branches to about 6 to 10 inches in length. At that time, also 
remove all but the strongest 4 to 6 canes. Black raspberry varieties 
include ‘Black Hawk’, ‘Mac Black’, ‘Bristol’, and ‘Jewel’.
 
 Purple raspberries result from crosses between red and black raspberry 
varieties, but they are much less commonly grown. Their growth habit is 
similar to black raspberry and the fruit is excellent for jams. ‘Royalty’ is 
the most common variety.

 Blackberries: Preferring hot southern summers, blackberries grow in 
Zones 6 and warmer, although some varieties make it into Zone 5 and 
warmer parts of Zone 4. Prune blackberries as described for summer-
bearing raspberries, but leave the floricanes about 4 to 5 feet high.
 
 Blackberries fall into two main categories: bush or upright types and trail-
ing. The trailing varieties make less appealing plants for most home gar-
deners because they require more trellising and maintenance, have more 
thorns than the uprights, and are less cold hardy. Thornless blackberries 
are now available, including ‘Arapaho’, ‘Black Satin’, ‘Chester’, ‘Navaho’, 
‘Hull’, and ‘Triple Crown’. Of the thorny upright varieties, ‘Illini Hardy’, 
‘Darrow’, ‘Lowden’, and ‘Ebony King’ are among the cold hardiest.
 
Some diseases  cause serious damage to raspberries and blackberries, lead-
ing to their decline and reduced fruiting. Root rots, Verticillium wilt, and leaf 
rust are among the worst, but some varieties are less susceptible than others 
to disease. Choose a resistant variety whenever possible, such as the ones 
listed in this section. Another way to prevent the spread of disease is to plant 
the different kinds of brambles away from one another. Black and purple 
raspberries, for example, can get mosaic virus from red raspberries, which 
can get it from blackberries. If possible, burn or shred prunings and remove 
them from the site to prevent the spread of diseases and pests. Don’t prune, 
harvest, or walk among plants when the foliage is wet.

Going ape for grapes
Growing organic grapes (Vitis species) successfully  depends on your climate, 
cultural strategies, and the varieties you choose. Arid climates provoke 
fewer diseases than humid climates. You can grow grapes nearly anywhere 
in Zones 3 through 10, and they tolerate a wide range of soil conditions; well-
drained soil in the pH range of 5.5 to 7.0 is best. Grapes need full sun and 
very good air circulation to hamper diseases.
At least three different grape species and countless varieties exist in North 
American gardens and vineyards. The European grape, V. vinifera, grows best 
in a Mediterranean climate, such as California and parts of the southwest-
ern United States. In hotter, humid climates, many people grow muscadine 
grapes, V. rotundifolia, which thrive in Zones 7 through 9. The native North 
American species, V. labrusca, and its hybrids are the hardiest and best for 
most other regions of the country.
To sort out the complicated lineage, divide grapes into two broad categories: 
table grapes and wine or juice grapes. Table grapes have tender skins suit-
able for fresh eating and may contain seeds or be seedless. Wine and juice 
grapes may have tougher skins, but plenty of sweet juice for liquid consump-
tion or making into jelly. Ripe fruit colors range from green to pink and red to 
deep purplish black.
Before planting young grapes, prepare the soil thoroughly as described in the 
“Discovering Berry Patch Basics” section (earlier in this chapter) and install 
a sturdy trellis consisting of 2 or 3 heavy wires strung 24 inches apart on 
sturdy posts. Brace the end posts.
Several pruning and training systems exist, but the basic idea in all   of them is 
to establish 1 or 2 main trunks per vine. Each trunk grows horizontal lateral 
branches, which you attach to the wires. The flowers and fruit appear on 
wood that grows in the current year from the laterals that grew in the previ-
ous year. Starting in winter after the first growing season, begin the pruning 
and training as follows:
 
1. In the first winter, choose two healthy, vigorous canes to keep and 
remove the rest.
 
 Prune these main trunks back to 3 or 4 buds each.
 
2. The next summer, select the most vigorous shoot from each trunk and 
remove competing shoots.
 
 Train the shoots on a string until they reach the top wire and then pinch 
them to encourage lateral branching, as shown in Figure 5-3.

562
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
3. In the second winter, remove all growth from the trunk and lateral 
branches.
 
 Cut laterals back to 10 buds. Let vines grow unpruned through the 
summer.
 
4. In the third winter and subsequent years, choose the laterals for the 
current year as well as replacement laterals for next year.
 
 Leave 10 buds on the current year laterals and 2 buds on the replace-
ments. Remember that grapes grow fruit on wood that grows in the cur-
rent year from last season’s laterals. Prune off all other wood, removing 
as much 90 percent of the previous year’s growth.
Prevalent  diseases and pests include berry moth, mites, leaf hoppers, and 
Japanese beetles, as well as Botrytis bunch rot, powdery mildew, and black 
rot. Some varieties are less sensitive to infection than other varieties. Grape 
varieties often grow best in specific regions of the country. Consult your local 
extension office or reputable nursery for recommendations.

Sublime strawberries
Probably  the most popular small fruit for the home garden, strawberries are 
also among the hardest to grow organically. Strawberries have many insect 
pests and diseases that damage plants and berries alike. Establishing your 
planting in well-drained, fertile soil, and maintaining a weed-free patch is 
essential for success.
You can choose from three kinds of strawberries, depending on when you 
want fruit. Consult your local extension office or nurseries for the best variet-
ies for your area. Here are the options:
 
 June-bearing varieties produce one large crop of berries in late spring 
to early summer.
 
 Everbearing varieties produce two smaller crops — one in the early 
summer and another in early fall.
 
 Day-neutral berries, the newest type, can produce fruit continuously 
throughout the growing season.
Plant dormant, bare-root strawberry plants 18 to 24 inches apart in 3- to 6-inch 
high, 3- to 4-foot wide raised beds. Set the plants so that soil covers the 
roots, but the crown remains above the soil, as shown in Figure 5-4. Keep 
the soil moist, but not saturated. Pinch off all flowers until midsummer for 
the first season to encourage strong root and top  growth.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Plant straw-
berry plants 
so that 
crowns are 
just above 
the soil.
 

564
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
The plants that you set out are called the mother plants. They send out run-
ners that take root and develop new daughter plants in mid to late summer. 
Space the daughter plants evenly around the mothers to give each plenty 
of space to grow. Daughter plants flower and fruit the year after they grow. 
In the second summer, you can remove the original mother plants to make 
room for new daughter plants. Another method is to rotary till the sides of 
the bed in midsummer of the second or third year, leaving plants only in the 
18- to 24-inch wide center strip. Train new daughter plants into the tilled soil. 
Plan to replace your strawberry planting every 3 to 5 years. Cover the plant-
ing with straw mulch after the ground freezes in cold-winter climates and 
remove as the weather warms in spring.
 
One of  the most serious insect pests that affect strawberries is the tarnished 
plant bug, which can severely damage the developing fruit. These insects 
spend the winter in plant debris and live on weeds in and around your yard. 
Covering the strawberry plants in the fall with a floating row cover can offer 
some, but not complete, protection from the bugs in the following spring and 
early summer. Early ripening varieties often suffer less damage than late-
season berries.
The strawberry clipper or bud weevil is another significant pest in some 
areas. This insect flies into the planting from neighboring woodlots and 
hedgerows about the time that the flower buds swell. Adults destroy the 
developing buds by laying eggs in them. Many other insects, slugs, mites, and 
nematodes attack strawberry fruits and plants, reducing vigor and produc-
tion and introducing disease. Birds and ground squirrels will also take their 
share.
Strawberries are also subject  to many fungus, bacteria, and viral diseases. 
Fungal infections include leaf spot, leaf scorch, leaf blight, powdery mildew, 
red stele, Verticillium wilt, root rot, and several berry rots. Avoid planting 
strawberries where tomatoes, eggplants, or potatoes previously grew to 
avoid wilt diseases. Buy only virus-free plants from a reputable nursery.
Choosing and Caring for Fruit Trees
Most people grow fruit trees primarily to produce food. To make these fruit 
factories more and more efficient, plant breeders continue to develop special 
techniques, such as reducing the size of the trees, to make trees produce at an 
earlier age and yield more fruit per acre. That’s good news for home gardeners.

565
 Chapter 5: Finding Organic Success with Fruit

Size does matter
Trees are easier to harvest and  maintain when all the branches are within 
arm’s reach. Unfortunately, many fruit trees can grow up to 40 feet tall or 
even higher when left to their own devices. To keep them in bounds and to 
produce more high quality fruit, most fruit varieties are grafted onto roots 
of smaller-growing varieties. Tree nurseries slip a bud, called a scion, from a 
desirable fruit variety, such as ‘Delicious’ apple or ‘Bing’ cherry, under the 
bark of a dwarfing rootstock variety in early spring. Plant breeders and tree 
nurseries graft fruit trees for  a variety to
 
 Reproduce exact copies of desirable trees.
 
 Reduce the mature size of the tree.
 
 Encourage fruit bearing at an earlier age.
 
 Increase disease and pest resistance.
 
 Adapt to different soils.
 
 Determine hardiness to particular climates.
Roots are one of the most cold-sensitive parts of a tree. Some rootstocks 
increase the trees’ hardiness to cold temperatures.
Some rootstocks  influence the size that the tree will ultimately attain, 
although the mature size of the tree also depends on the standard height 
that’s normal for the scion or main variety. Dwarfing rootstocks are catego-
rized by the amount of dwarfing they provide. Apple tree sizes, for example, 
fall into several categories:
 
 Standard-sized apple trees, grown on seedling or nondwarfing roots 
may reach 25 feet.
 
 Semi-dwarf is about 75 percent of the standard height or about 18 feet 
at maturity.
 
 Dwarf trees are about 50 percent as high as standard or 12-feet tall.
 
 Miniature trees are only about 15 percent of the standard size. At a mere 
4 feet in height, these trees are the best ones for growing in containers.
 
As an organic home  gardener, consider dwarf to semi-dwarf size trees for 
several reasons. Monitoring and controlling pests is easier to do when you 
can reach the top of the tree. On very small trees, you can even use a barrier 
fabric to help prevent insect infestations. You can also harvest fruit years 
sooner and pick the fruit more easily.

566
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Whether you have a large yard or a half whiskey-barrel container, you can 
find a fruit or nut variety that fits your available space, soil, and climate by 
choosing the right rootstock. Specialty nurseries that ship by mail have the 
largest selection of varieties and rootstocks, while local garden centers usu-
ally offer only dwarf or semi-dwarf trees in a handful of popular varieties.
Sex and the single tree
Many fruit species, such as  apples, sweet cherries, European pears, and 
Japanese plums, require cross-pollination to bear fruit. That means that you 
need two different but compatible varieties planted near one another so that 
the pollen of one fertilizes the flowers of the other.
 
The trees must bloom at the same time for cross-pollination to occur, and 
some varieties are fussy about  who they mix with. Other fruit species are 
self-fruitful, which means that they can pollinate their own flowers, but even 
those trees often produce larger crops when they mix pollen with a friend. 
Reputable nurseries or your local extension office can tell you which variet-
ies can pollinate each other.
Feeling the chill factor
Fruits have  another peculiar requirement — most need a certain number of 
hours below 45°F — called chill requirement or chill factor — in order to pro-
duce plenty of flowers and fruit. As you may guess, fruits, such as oranges, 
that grow mostly in the warm climates have lower chilling requirements than 
some cold-climate fruits, such as apples. The chill factor isn’t related to cold 
hardiness, however. Even some frost-tender plants, such as fig trees, need 
some time below 45°F to bear fruit properly.
Crops fall into several  categories, depending on how many hours of chilling 
that they need. Each variety is different, however. Some peach varieties need 
only 200 hours, while others require more than 1,000. Look for specific variet-
ies that match your climate:
 
 Low chill fruits need fewer than 400 hours below 45°F. In the United 
States, warm pockets in California, southern Texas, and Florida fall into 
this category.
 
 Moderate chill fruits need between 400 and 700 hours of chill. Look for 
varieties with this requirement if you live along the Gulf coast, south-
eastern seaboard, or Pacific coastal areas.
 
 High chill varieties need more than 700 hours and often more than 1,000 
hours of temperatures below 45°f. Most of the United States and Canada 
easily fall into this range.

567
 Chapter 5: Finding Organic Success with Fruit

Low winter temperatures and timing of autumn and spring frosts play impor-
tant roles in your selection of fruit species and varieties for your organic 
orchard. Local nurseries generally sell plants best suited to your local cli-
mate. Reputable mail-order nurseries and your local extension office can also 
steer you toward appropriate varieties.
Budding genius
Fruit trees grow different  kinds of buds: The terminal bud grows at the end of 
branches, and that’s where new branches and twigs grow from each spring. 
When the terminal buds expand, they leave bud scars, which look like slightly 
raised rings around the twig. You can measure how much a tree has grown 
each year by looking at the distance between bud scars. Leaf buds appear 
along the twigs and expand into leaves. Flower buds are usually fatter than 
leaf buds and swell first in the spring. Some trees, such as most apples, 
pears, cherries, plums, and apricots, produce their fruit on spurs, which are 
short, modified twigs. Spurs usually live and produce flower buds for several 
years or longer before becoming unproductive. See Figure 5-5 for examples of 
these bud types.

ferent kinds

568
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
For the best-quality apples and pears, leave only one fruit on each spur and 
 pinch off the others in early summer. Spurs and flower buds develop best on 
limbs that are angled slightly above horizontal. Branches that grow upright 
and those that dangle below horizontal produce little, if any, fruit.
Planting for success
All fruits need  moisture-retentive but well-drained soil. Soggy sites spell 
doom for these species. Adequate water is also critical, especially when the 
fruit is developing and expanding. If you live in a drought-prone area, con-
sider irrigating your fruit trees for the best yield. Drip tubes, which deliver 
water directly to the soil around the trees, are best. Avoid sprinklers that 
spray water on the leaves and contribute to disease.
Professional fruit growers also consider air movement when they plan their 
orchard placement and layout. Air affects fruit and nut plants in several ways:
 
 Wind: Too much wind can keep pollinating insects, such as bees, from 
flying and pollinating the flowers at critical times. It also knocks fruit off 
the tree and can damage the branches. Plant a windbreak, if necessary, 
or put the trees where a building shields them.
 
 Frost pockets: Cold air flows downhill and collects at the bottom of a 
slope. Trees that bloom in early spring are especially vulnerable to cold 
temperatures at that time, and the flowers may be severely damaged if 
planted where cold air collects. Plant fruit trees and shrubs on the slope 
instead of near the bottom, but avoid the windy top of a slope.
 
 Circulation: Constantly but lightly moving air helps prevent disease 
organisms from getting a foothold on your trees. Many fungus diseases 
that infect leaves need water and moisture to spread and grow, so keep-
ing the leaves dry is important.
If you buy your plants locally, they’ll  usually be already growing in a con-
tainer. If you order them from a mail-order nursery, however, they’ll arrive 
in a dormant or nongrowing state and bareroot, without any soil around their 
roots. Be sure to plant bareroot trees and shrubs right away.
 
After planting, establish a wide ring of organic mulch around your trees to 
conserve soil moisture, prevent grass and weeds from competing with the 
tree roots, and reduce insect pests. See Chapter 3 of this book for the low-
down on mulch.
Because producing heavy crops of fruit stresses trees and shrubs, fruit-
bearing species need additional nutrients. The texture of your soil, its cur-
rent nutrient levels, plant age and type, climate, and amount of fruit your 
tree bears all have an effect on the amount of additional nutrients you need 

569
 Chapter 5: Finding Organic Success with Fruit
Book VI

Gardening
to add to the soil. Soil tests and leaf analyses are the most accurate methods 
used to determine which nutrients your trees need. Consult your local exten-
sion office for information on taking leaf samples and where to send them.
Pruning fruit trees and shrubs
Producing bushels of high-quality  fruit and developing a sturdy tree that can 
support the crop are the twin goals of pruning and training fruit trees. If you 
end up with an attractive landscape specimen, too, that’s a bonus! Although 
you use the same basic pruning techniques on all fruit trees, each kind of 
fruit tree has unique timing and methods for reaching your goals.
You need to prune fruit trees regularly for several reasons. Keep these goals 
in mind as you make decisions about which limbs to remove:
 
 Removing dead, damaged, and diseased wood: Do this step before any 
other pruning and whenever necessary.
 
 Controlling tree and shrub size: Keep fruit down where you can harvest 
and care for it without a ladder.
 
 Providing air circulation: Circulation helps ward off pests and diseases. 
Crowded limbs invite fungus diseases and provide habitat for damaging 
insects.
 
 Increasing exposure to sunlight: Sunlight makes fruit develop a sweeter 
flavor and deeper color. Fruit that’s exposed to direct sunlight tastes 
better than fruit shaded by leaves and branches.
 
 Increasing the quality and quantity of fruit: Branches trained to 
60-degree angles where they meet the trunk develop the most flower 
buds. Spacing the limbs up and down and around the trunk provides the 
best conditions for the fruit to mature.
Professional fruit growers use several different pruning and training meth-
ods, depending on the type of fruit they grow. The following styles apply 
mainly to temperate-climate fruit — tropical fruits, such   as citrus, are trained 
differently. See Figure 5-6 for examples of each style.
 
 Central leader: Used  mainly with apples, European pears and plums, 
and dwarf cultivars, this method yields trees with single, upright trunks. 
The main limbs should be spaced about 8 inches apart and extend in all 
directions around the trunk so that no limb is directly above another. 
If you looked straight down from the top, the limbs should resemble 
a spiral in which no two branches are at exactly the same level on the 
trunk. To maximize sunlight penetration, prune the limbs so that those 
at the top of the tree are shorter than branches under them.

570
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
 
 Modified central leader: In this system, trees are trained to a single, 
upright trunk with evenly spaced limbs until they reach a desired height, 
usually 6 to 10 feet. At that point, you prune out the leader and maintain 
the tree at that height. All fruit trees can be trained to this form, and it’s 
especially useful for keeping fruit within picking distance of the ground.
 
 Open center (also called vase shape): Peaches,  nectarines, sour cher-
ries, apricots, Asian pears, and Japanese plums produce easy-to-reach, 
high quality fruit when pruned to this form. In this style, you select four 
or five well-placed main branches and then prune out the central leader. 
This technique limits the height of the tree and creates a spreading 
crown. You can use this method with any fruit tree, especially those that 
normally grow too tall to harvest comfortably.
 
Choose young deciduous fruit trees — trees that lose their leaves in the 
autumn — with good structure to start with and shape them as they grow.

The first few years are the most critical time to develop a healthy tree struc-
ture that will provide years of tasty fruit. Here’s how to get your trees off to a 
good start:
 
 At planting time: Remove damaged and dead limbs, those under 25 
inches from the ground, and any with narrow crotch angles of less 
than 45 degrees. Leave branches with crotch angles between 45 and 80 
degrees. If the tree has two shoots competing to be the leader, choose 
one and remove the other.

571
 Chapter 5: Finding Organic Success with Fruit
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 First winter: In late winter, select three to four limbs to keep as main 
branches. They should be about 8 inches apart vertically, be well spaced 
around the trunk, and have approximately 60-degree angles at the trunk. 
Prune off all other limbs. Prune remaining limbs back by one-third of 
their length to encourage side branching. Prune the central leader to 24 
to 30 above the uppermost limb for a central-leader-style tree. If pruning 
for an open center or vase shape, remove the central leader just above 
the top branch.
 
 Second summer: In midsummer,  remove water sprouts that grow upright 
from the branches and suckers, which grow up from the base of the 
tree. In central-leader trees, choose the strongest, most upright leader 
and remove competing ones. Using the criteria mentioned for the first 
dormant season, choose the next tier of limbs beginning about 15 to 
18 inches above the top branch of the lower tier. Remove undesirable 
limbs. In open center trees, remove competing, crowded, and upright 
shoots.
 
 Second winter: Remove undesirable  limbs, competing leaders, water 
sprouts, and suckers and prune the new growth of side branches back 
by one-third. Use notched sticks, called spreaders, to spread the remain-
ing limbs to 60-degree angles where they meet the trunk. Leave the 
spreaders in place until mid to late summer. In open center trees, prune 
new shoots by one-third to outward-facing buds — buds that face away 
from the trunk — to encourage branching. Thin out crowded shoots by 
removing the weakest ones.
 
 Continuing care: Continue to follow the directions for the second 
season year after year. To develop a modified leader tree, remove the 
central leader just above the uppermost branch you wish to   keep. Do 
this step in the summer to inhibit vigorous sprouting.
Picking Temperate-Climate 
Trees and Shrubs
Popular and  easy-to-grow in USDA Hardiness Zones 8 and northward, these 
fruits find their way into lunch boxes, fruit salads, and pies from coast to 
coast. All require some dedication to their cultural needs, but richly reward 
your efforts.
 
If you have limited space or just don’t need bushels of fruit, try growing 
dwarf or even miniature versions of these trees.

572
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Apples
With hundreds of varieties available, at  least one apple (Malus sylvestris) 
is available to match nearly any climate and set of taste buds. Apples are 
among the most popular fruit trees to grow, but to harvest high-quality fruit, 
you must be prepared to regularly prune them, feed them, and deal with 
pests. Apples require cross-pollination, but some nurseries offer trees with 
two or more varieties grafted onto one rootstock. You can also use ornamen-
tal crabapples to pollinate apple trees.
 
Several serious pests make apples a challenge to grow  organically. Plum 
curculio, apple maggot, and codling moths damage the developing fruits, 
frequently making them inedible. (For more on pest control, see Chapter 3 of 
this book.)
As trees increase in size, they become harder to prune and spray, so choose 
trees on semi-dwarf and dwarf rootstocks that reach only 8 to 12 feet tall. You 
can also use pruning techniques to control tree height. Prune apple trees in 
late winter, while they are dormant, and follow up in midsummer to remove 
overly vigorous sprouts.
 
Disease resistance is key when choosing apple varieties for organic orchards. 
Apple scab, cedar apple rust, powdery mildew, and fire blight devastate 
many common and older varieties, which makes them unsuitable for home 
orchards. Although the names of improved varieties may be unfamiliar, the 
fruit is just as flavorful. Some disease-resistant apple varieties worth seek-
ing out, listed from those that ripen earliest (late summer) to latest (mid to 
late autumn), include ‘Redfree’, ‘Prima’, ‘Novamac’, ‘JonaFree’, ‘Priscilla’, 
‘Freedom’, ‘Liberty’, ‘Nova Easygro’, ‘Enterprise’, and ‘GoldRush’.
Apples ripen from late summer through late autumn, so choose a variety that 
ripens its fruit before freezing temperatures in your area have a chance to 
damage the crop. Varieties also vary considerably in their chill requirements, 
with some better suited to colder climates and others to milder seasons.
European and Asian pears
Pears (Pyrus species) share  many of apples’ quirks and characteristics, and 
they grow in similar climates. Like apples, pears are usually sold as grafted 
trees and require similar pruning and training. Pears, with their glossy dark 
green foliage, make especially good landscape specimens in addition to pro-
viding delicious fruit.

573
 Chapter 5: Finding Organic Success with Fruit
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
Unfortunately, pears also share many of apple’s diseases and insect pests. 
Fireblight is its most devastating disease, while pear scab can render the 
trees and fruit unsightly. Avoid planting fireblight-prone varieties and keep 
insect pests, which spread the disease, under control. Pear psylla, an insect 
that resembles a winged, yellow- to orange-colored aphid, sucks the juice out 
of new foliage and excretes sticky droppings that support a black, sooty look-
ing fungus. You can control it with dormant spray oil.
You can choose from two kinds of pears — European and Asian. They share 
most cultural attributes, but differ in some other ways:
 
 Pollination: Most European pears require another variety planted 
within 50 feet for cross-pollination. Asian pears are mostly self-fruitful, 
but produce heavier crops when cross-pollinated.
 
 Shape: European pear fruits have the traditional pear shape — a wide 
bottom and narrower top. Most Asian pears resemble round apples.
 
 Texture: European pears have soft, melting flesh when ripe. Asian pears 
have crisp, apple-like flesh.
Fireblight-resistant varieties of European pear, listed in order of ripening, 
include ‘Harrow Delight’, ‘Harvest Queen’, ‘Starking Delicious’, ‘Moonglow’, 
‘Stark Honeysweet’, ‘Magness’, ‘Seckel’, and ‘Harrow Sweet’. The earliest vari-
eties begin ripening in mid-August in Zone 5, with the latest finishing up in 
late September.
Disease-resistant Asian varieties include ‘Shinko’, ‘Shinseiki’, ‘Large Korean’ 
(also known as ‘Dan Beh’), ‘Korean Giant’, and ‘Olympic’, all of which ripen 
from September through October. Ripening begins earlier in Zones 6 and 7.
 
Pears are best picked when still  somewhat hard and allowed to ripen at room 
temperature or in the refrigerator. Fruit that overripens on the tree develops 
hard, gritty spots in the flesh and may turn brown and mushy near the core. 
Asian pears and late-season European pears keep for months in the refrigera-
tor if picked just before ripeness.
Sweet and sour cherries
Cherries are glorious in their   spring bloom — the fruit seems just like a bonus. 
In Zone 5, cherries ripen from June into July, providing the first tree fruit of 
the season. Most cherries are red when ripe, but some sweet cherries are 
yellow. Cherries belong to the Prunus genus along with peaches and plums.

574
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Although sweet and sour or tart cherries are similar in many respects, they 
differ from each other in significant ways.
 
 Pollination: Sweet cherries need cross-pollination, except for the variety 
‘Stella’, so you need two compatible varieties. Sour cherries, also called 
pie cherries, are self-pollinating. Sour cherries can pollinate sweet cher-
ries, but may not bloom at the same time. Trees must bloom at the same 
time for them to cross-pollinate.
 
 Hardiness: Sweet cherry trees grow reliably only in Zones 5 to 8, but 
some sour cherries thrive in Zone 4.
 
 Culinary use: Sweet cherries, common in supermarkets in early 
summer, are best when eaten fresh. Sour cherries make the best pies 
and jams, but you have to grow your own — markets rarely offer them. 
Some varieties are sweet enough to eat fresh, too.
The pests that plague apples, including plum curculio and apple maggot, also 
infest cherries, as do the cherry fruit fly and Oriental fruit moth. Birds will 
also take a portion of the crop, if not the whole thing, unless you cover the 
ripening fruit with a net. Birds tend to bother tart cherries less than sweet 
cherries, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. Fruit of some varieties tend to 
crack in the rain as they ripen, but others resist this bad habit. Of the dis-
eases that affect all Prunus species, black knot fungus, bacterial canker, and 
leaf spot are the most serious. Practice good sanitation by raking up foliage 
and dropped fruit and prune out any infected wood immediately.
 
For best flavor, let sweet and sour cherries  fully ripen on the tree before pick-
ing, but keep them covered to prevent bird theft!
‘Montmorency’ is the most widely grown commercial sour cherry, but other 
varieties, such as ‘Morello’, ‘Meteor’, and ‘Northstar’ are good choices for 
home orchards.
Good sweet cherry varieties for home-grown fruit include ‘Stella’, ‘Lapins’, 
‘Glacier’, ‘Surefire’, and ‘Sunburst’, which are self-pollinating. ‘Bing’, which is 
the most common commercial variety, is susceptible to canker and fruit split-
ting. Good varieties that require cross-pollination include ‘Van’ and yellow 
cherries ‘Emperor Francis’, ‘Stark Gold’, and ‘Rainier’.
Peaches and nectarines
Peaches and nectarines are actually the same species (Prunus persica), but 
 peaches are fuzzy and nectarines are smooth-skinned. They share the same 
diseases and pests as cherries, but are worth growing for the juicy flavor and 
aroma that comes only from freshly picked, sun-ripened fruit. They are self-
pollinating, so you need only one tree.

 Chapter 5: Finding Organic Success with Fruit
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
Peaches, nectarines, apricots, and plums are called stone fruits after the seed 
pit in their centers. These  fruits fall into one of two camps, called freestone 
and clingstone, depending on whether or not the flesh separates easily from 
the seed. In general, freestone fruit has softer, melting flesh and is best for 
fresh eating, while clingstone fruit has firmer flesh that holds up well in 
baking and canning. Generally, fruits ripen from mid-July through August, 
depending on the climate and variety.
 
Geography and climate influence peach growing rather significantly. Diseases 
and pests that are prevalent in some parts of the United States cause little 
concern in other areas. Plum curculio, bacterial leaf spot, and fungus dis-
eases, for example, present problems for peaches in the eastern part of the 
United States from a line that runs approximately from Fort Worth, Texas, to 
Fargo, North Dakota. Gardeners west of that line have an easier time growing 
peaches organically, except in the Pacific Northwest where the damp climate 
encourages diseases. If you’re in the eastern United States, vigilant house-
keeping, pruning, and choosing a site that encourages air circulation, as well 
as using natural pesticides, can help you grow this problem-prone crop.
Peaches and nectarines grow reliably  only in climates with mild winters and 
fairly dry summers, preferably Zones 6 to 9, although some varieties produce 
fruit in warmer parts of Zones 4 and 5. The hardiness of their overwintering 
flower buds is the limiting factor in cold-winter climates — several consecu-
tive nights of –13°F will kill them. Mild weather in winter or early spring fol-
lowed by a return to freezing weather also spells disaster for their blooms. 
Plant breeders have developed varieties, such as ‘Reliance’ and ‘Veteran’, 
that withstand temperatures as low as –25°F, but they’re usually less flavorful 
than peaches grown in warmer climates. If you want to try growing peaches 
in Zones 4 or 5, choose varieties with high-chill requirements because they 
bloom later in the season.
Gardeners in Zones 9 and 10 can successfully grow peaches if they choose 
varieties with low chill requirements. Some varieties developed for Florida, 
for example, need only 150 to 400 hours below 45°F to bear fruit.
 
Peaches and nectarines bloom on wood that grew in the previous year, 
so prune them in June after flowering. Maintain an open-centered form 
and encourage lots of new growth each year. Maintain a vigilant pest- and 
disease-control program, too, because peach and nectarine trees are among 
the most susceptible to attack of all fruit trees. Peach leaf curl — a serious 
fungus disease — causes leaves and fruit to drop prematurely. Look for 
varieties that resist canker, brown rot, bacterial leaf spot, and pit splitting. 
Catalog or plant-tag descriptions will usually tell you whether a variety is 
resistant to particular diseases.

576
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Peach varieties that resist bacterial leaf spot  include ‘Harrow Diamond’, 
‘Harrow Beauty’, ‘Delta’, ‘Southern Pearl’, ‘Desert Gold’, ‘Candor’, 
‘Sweethaven’, ‘Redhaven’, ‘Reliance’, ‘Harbrite’, ‘Harken’, and ‘Veteran’. 
Nectarine varieties include ‘Sunraycer’, ‘Fantasia’, ‘RosePrincess’, ‘Mericrest’, 
‘Hardired’, and ‘Harko’.
European and Asian apricots
Members of the Prunus genus,  European and Asian apricots enjoy the same 
mild climates and well-drained soils as peaches and sweet cherries. Although 
plum curculio, codling moth, and brown rot can infest the fruits, the trees are 
more vigorous and resistant to disease than peaches. Prune apricot trees to 
a modified central leader or open-center form. If you can grow them in your 
climate, give apricots a try because they have beautiful early spring flowers 
followed by luscious fruit that supermarkets just can’t match. Unfortunately, 
spring frosts damage the tender blooms in cold regions.
 
European apricots that you may see in your grocery’s produce section grow 
on 10- to 30-foot trees that thrive in the warmer, drier parts of Zones 6 to 8. 
Trees grown in cool, humid climates produce less fruit, and it tends to be of 
poorer quality. Choose varieties that are suitable for your specific climate. 
Local nurseries and your local extension office can make knowledgeable rec-
ommendations. Choose a freestone variety (discussed in the “Peaches and 
nectarines” section), if you wish to dry the ripened fruits for storage. Good 
varieties include ‘Harcot’, ‘Harglow’, ‘Hargrand’, ‘Harlayne’, ‘Puget Gold’, 
‘Veecot’, and ‘Goldcot’. For best flavor, allow the fruits to ripen on the tree 
before picking in July and early August.
Plums
Plum is one of the most genetically complicated  fruits in the Prunus group 
because it has a number of species, all which are commonly interbred. 
The resulting fruits fall into several broad categories, including European, 
Japanese, and prune plums. They differ in important ways:
 
 Japanese plums are round, usually require cross-pollination to set fruit, 
and are pruned to an open-centered shape. They’re generally hardy to 
Zone 6 and warmer parts of Zone 5, although some hybrids are hardier. 
Varieties include ‘Shiro’, ‘Early Golden’, ‘Burbank’, ‘Redheart’, ‘Santa 
Rosa’, ‘Methley,’ and ‘Beauty’. Hybrids ‘Elite’, ‘Superb’, ‘Tecumseh’, 
‘Perfection’, and ‘Brookgold’ are hardy through Zone 4.

577
 Chapter 5: Finding Organic Success with Fruit
Book VI
Organic 
Gardening
 
 European plums are oval, and most don’t need a second variety for pol-
lination. Train these trees to a modified leader form. Most varieties are 
hardy through Zone 5, and some produce fruit even in Zone 4. Varieties 
include ‘Damson’, ‘Seneca’, ‘Verity’, and ‘Green Gage’.
 
 Prune plums are European plums with drier flesh and a high sugar 
content that makes them suitable for drying. Common varieties 
include ‘Stanley’, ‘French Prune’, ‘Fellenberg’ or ‘Italian Prune’, ‘Valor’, 
‘Earliblue’, ‘Sugar’, and ‘Mount Royal’, which is hardy in Zone 4.
Japanese and European plums can’t pollinate each other, so if your trees 
require cross-pollination, be sure to choose compatible varieties. Thin the 
fruits to hang 4 to 6 inches apart, 5 to 8 weeks after bloom. Fruits ripen from 
July through September, starting with Japanese plums and ending with prune 
plums, depending on the variety.
Plant breeders have also crossed apricots with plums to create hybrids 
called apriums, plumcots, and pluots. These are hardy wherever European 
apricots grow, require cross-pollination, and have characteristics   of both 
parents.
Growing Warm-Climate Fruit Trees
These trees grow  where winter temperatures remain mild — generally in 
Zones 8 and warmer. Evergreen species, such as citrus, perish when the ther-
mometer reaches or goes more than a few degrees below freezing, although 
some citrus varieties can grow in colder climes. Deciduous fruits, such as figs 
and persimmons, are somewhat hardier, especially if you give them a favor-
able site. Gardeners in colder climates can grow some of these fruits success-
fully in containers, moving them to sheltered places in the winter or growing 
them as houseplants.
Citrus
This large tropical and subtropical group covers a  wide range of juicy fruits 
that require almost frost-free climates to produce fruit (most can take 25°F to 
28°F for several hours) and hot summers to help ripen and sweeten the fruit. 
These trees need temperatures between 70°F and 90°F for best growth. In the 
United States, the citrus-growing region is limited to Florida, coastal areas of 
the Gulf coast states, and parts of Arizona and California.

578
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Citrus trees have evergreen foliage, and most have thorny limbs. Trees are 
usually grafted. (See the “Size does matter” section, earlier in this chapter.) 
Most species bloom in early spring and don’t require cross-pollination. Fruit 
ripens from autumn to spring, but some everbearing trees produce fruit year 
’round. Allow fruit to ripen on the tree for best flavor. Here’s a look at some 
of the popular citrus fruits:
 
 Grapefruits: Grown primarily in Florida and southern Texas, the trees 
reach 30 feet in height. Varieties include both seeded and seedless types 
and those with red, pink, or white flesh.
 
 Kumquat: A bit hardier and smaller than most citrus trees, kumquat can 
tolerate temperatures as low as 18°F to 20°F and also make good house-
plants. You can eat the small fruit whole — rind and all.
 
 Lemons and limes: Among the most cold-sensitive citrus, this group 
grows best in frost-free climates. Some varieties do well as houseplants, 
producing the sour fruit indoors.
 
 Mandarins: Members of this large group have somewhat flattened 
shapes and loose, easy-to-peel skins. Varieties include tangerines, 
clementines, and tangelos. The ‘Calamondin’ variety makes a good 
houseplant or container shrub and produces loads of small fruit with 
edible rinds. Most mandarin varieties need Zone 9 and warmer, although 
‘Calamondin’ and ‘Satsuma’ varieties tolerate temperatures down to 
20°F.
 
 Oranges: You can choose from many varieties, which vary in ease of 
peeling, sweetness, number of seeds, hardiness, quality of the juice, 
color, and time of ripening. Although most types ripen during December 
and January, some are ready to pick in November, while others, such 
as juicy Valencia varieties, don’t ripen until late winter to spring. Navel 
oranges are among the hardiest varieties.
 
Annual pruning  isn’t necessary for citrus trees — a good thing, given that 
most of these trees sport long, sharp thorns. They require pruning just 
to keep the centers of the trees open to light and air and to remove dead 
branches. If trees get too big to pick easily, you can cut back the limbs with 
thinning cuts every year or two. Wait to prune frost-nipped trees until new 
growth shows the extent of damage. To prevent sunburn after pruning, paint 
exposed branches that were previously shaded by foliage with whitewash 
made from a 1:1 mix of water and a white, water-based paint.
Citrus demands moist but well-drained soil and regular applications of nitrogen 
fertilizer beginning in January and ending in late summer. Make sure that trees 
have adequate water when they’re actively growing and developing fruit. Pests 
and diseases infrequently cause problems, except when trees are stressed 
from drought or other weather-related factors. Scale, mites, thrips, and white-
flies may infest these trees, and so can cankers that infect the wood.

Figs
These attractive trees have  smooth, gray bark and large, lobed, tropical-
looking leaves. Figs (Ficus carica) can take winter cold down to 15°F, but 
freezing temperatures kill the upper branches and even the trunk of the tree, 
after which the tree sprouts up from its roots and forms a shrub with several 
stems. Following such a freeze, the plants may not produce fruit in the follow-
ing season, depending on the variety. Figs grow best in subtropical climates 
with mild winters and long, hot summers to ripen their fruit. They need well-
drained soil.
Figs make good container specimens for climates where they can’t survive 
outdoors year ’round. Move the containers into a cool, protected location 
where temperatures remain above freezing. Bring the plants into a warm, 
sunny location in early spring when the buds begin to swell.
Figs typically ripen two crops per year in warm climates. Leave the fruit on 
the trees to fully ripen before picking, but protect them from hungry birds. 
Prune to encourage new shoots, prevent branch crowding, and remove dead 
wood. Encourage the plant to form 3 to 5 main stems. If you prune when the 
trees are dormant, you decrease or eliminate the first crop but increase the 
second crop of the year.
Fig trees have no serious pests except for fruit flies and ants, which attack 
the fruit in some climates. In some areas, the trees are prone to fig rust, 
which can be controlled with Bordeaux mix sprayed on the leaf undersides 
every 2 to 3 weeks from June through August. ‘Brown Turkey’, ‘Celeste’, 
‘Magnolia’, and ‘Mission’ are common  varieties.
Persimmon
This lovely  landscape tree grows up to 25 feet tall and wide, with bright 
yellow, red, and orange fall foliage and gracefully drooping branches. Its 
orange fruit dangles from the ends of the limbs as it ripens. Although this 
tree can withstand winter temperatures to 0°F, in colder regions, it tends 
to break dormancy and begin growing before the cold weather has fully 
departed. Plant persimmons in well drained, acidic soil, but keep the soil 
moist, especially during the summer when the tree is carrying fruit. Prune 
only to establish a modified central leader branching structure of young trees 
and to remove dead and damaged limbs from mature trees.
Persimmons have few serious pests or diseases, although fungus disease can 
affect the fruit late in the season and trees are susceptible to wilt disease in 
some areas. Control scale insects with dormant oil spray in late winter. They 
need little pruning.

580
Book VI: Organic Gardening 
Japanese persimmon (Diospyros kaki) fruit fall into two different categories — 
astringent and non-astringent. Fruit of the astringent varieties are eaten when 
the flesh is soft and almost jelly-like, while non-astringent varieties can be 
eaten when firm. Some varieties have seeds, and others are seedless. The best 
astringent varieties include ‘Saijo’, ‘Tanenashi’, and ‘Yomato Hyakume’. Good 
non-astringent varieties include ‘Fuyu’, ‘Hanagosho’, and ‘Hana Fuyu’. Female 
trees don’t need male trees to set fruit and, in fact, produce seedy fruit with 
dark streaks in the flesh when pollinated. Harvest in autumn when the fruit 
feel slightly soft. Protect from birds.
The American persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), which is native to the 
United States, grows vigorously from Zones 4 to 9 and spreads easily from 
seeds eaten by birds and animals. The trees tend to form thickets of suck-
ers. Fruits measure 1 to 2 inches across and are sweet and edible after they 
mature, especially after a frost. Some varieties have larger fruit.

 Investing in solar energy
 Looking at the benefits of solar power
 Solving for challenges
P
roducing energy can be dirty work. Carbon emissions, coal slurry, 
nuclear waste, and other pollutants can wreak havoc on the environ-
ment, cause health problems, and make people hopping mad. And many 
energy sources are in limited supply. Not only these conditions drive up 
prices, but they also lead to political conflicts when people decide they’re 
not willing to share. You’re probably not ready to go completely unplugged, 
but you do want to play your humble part to save the environment, help the 
country become less dependent on outside energy sources, and save money. 
Tall order? Maybe not. Of all the energy sources in use today, solar shows 
the most long-term promise for solving the world’s energy problems.
On any given day, 35,000 times the total amount of energy that humans use 
falls onto the face of the earth from the sun. If people could just tap into a 
tiny fraction of what the sun is providing each day, society would be set. Of 
course, some problems do crop up, but they’re solvable, and going solar can 
be well worth the effort.
To understand the role solar energy can play in your home, you need to 
have a good understanding of where your own energy comes from, where it’s 
used, and how much pollution each of your energy sources generates. In this 
chapter, you find out how solar fits into your day-to-day life — and why it’s 
such a good energy option.

584
Book VII: Solar Power 
Looking for Sustainable Energy
The words renewable and sustainable are being knocked around quite a bit, 
and both are strongly associated with energy conservation. Renewable forms 
of energy constantly replenish themselves with little or no human effort. 
Solar energy is just one example — no matter how much you use, the supply 
will never end. (Okay, it may end after billions of years, but your using solar 
power won’t make the sun burn out any faster.)
Other examples of renewables include firewood, water (through hydroelec-
tric dams), and wind power. Note, however, that firewood is notoriously pol-
luting; the term renewable doesn’t necessarily imply good environmentalism. 
Firewood also has another potentially severe drawback in that people go out 
into forests and cut down trees, often without much thought to the overall 
health of the forest (a good example of not seeing the forest from the trees).
 
To make sure that resources last, humans need to focus on conservation, 
recycling, environmental restoration, and renewable energy sources. 
Sustainability is commonly associated with such a holistic approach to 
personal lifestyle. Not only are sustainable forms of energy renewable, but they 
also have the ability to keep the planet earth’s ecosystem up and running, in 
perpetuity. Sustainable energy, such as solar, is nonpolluting to the greatest 
extent possible.
 
The basic notion behind sustainable energy sources is that by their use, 
society is not compromising future generations’ health and well-being, nor 
their ability to use their own sustainable resources to any less capacity than 
we have.
Understanding Why Solar Is King
Solar power has historically been more expensive than other energy options, 
but that’s changing fast because of government investment in technologies, 
as well as the simple fact that many more people are investing in solar, which 
results in economies of scale. Solar energy equipment increases your financial 
standing in basically two ways:
 
 Savings on your monthly bills
 
 Appreciation of your home’s value
The following sections cover reasons why solar is a great investment, both 
financially and environmentally.

Reaping financial rewards
Solar is an investment; you must actively go out and purchase solar equipment 
and install it at your home. However, after the initial costs, not only do you 
save money from lowering your energy bill, but you also may see the value of 
your home increase.
So how does investing in solar compare to other investments, such as the 
stock market, a savings account, or a new kitchen?
 
To compare, you need to calculate your payback period. Payback period is 
a measure of how long it takes to recoup your upfront investment with the 
costs you save. If you install a solar water heater system for $4,000 and it 
saves you $50 a month on your power bill, the system will pay for itself in 80 
months, or 6
2⁄3 years. (Though you may easily cut that time in half if the price 
of oil skyrockets and utility rates double, for example, during a war in the 
Middle East.)
Now consider other ways you can spend that money. With investments in 
remodeling, such as a new kitchen, you get no monthly cost reductions at all 
unless you’re installing new appliances that are more energy efficient. If you 
put the same $4,000 into an interest-bearing bank account, you may get $20 a 
month in interest. After 80 months, you’d make $2,000 in compounded interest, 
or half your investment. And if you put the same money into the stock market, 
you may enjoy a return of $3,400. Of course, you can also lose the entire thing 
and drive yourself nuts with regret!
When you go solar, your home appreciates. Realtors can give you statistics 
that estimate how much the value will go up, given the type of investment 
and the area you live in.
According to the National Association of Real Estate Appraisers (NAREA), 
for every dollar you save annually in energy costs with solar equipment, 
the value of your home increases by up to 20 times your annual energy 
savings, depending on the type of system you install. For a solar water heater 
investment of $4,000, the value of your home may increase by at least that 
much! How can this be? Solar is catching on, and homebuyers are willing to 
pay more for solar homes that promise energy savings.
 
Right now, a wide range of government and industry programs are available 
to help you finance your solar investments. Governments are giving out tax 
breaks, utilities are offering rebates, and low-interest loans are available for 
solar investments. The net effect is to make your solar projects less expensive 
and more attractive on the bottom line.

Book VII: Solar Power 
Erasing your carbon footprint
Most energy resources are burned. The worst offender is coal, and the United 
States gets around 50 percent of its electrical power from coal-fired plants. 
Your carbon dioxide footprint is a measure of how much carbon dioxide 
you’re releasing into the environment by virtue of your energy-consuming 
habits. A typical carbon dioxide footprint is around 36,000 pounds (18 tons) 
per year. That’s a lot!
 
Solar, however, has no carbon footprint. For each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of 
energy-generating capacity you install with solar, you save that much from 
other sources, most likely the electrical power grid. Among other alternative 
energy resources, only wind power and hydro can offer this impact, but solar 
is far more versatile and widely available.
These numbers are valuable for calculating cost versus gain for installing 
solar systems because — face it — even though pollution isn’t costing you 
directly in your wallet, you need to factor it into your thinking.
When you generate solar electricity, you don’t need transmission lines and 
all the associated inefficiency. Solar is right there, where you use it. When 
you install a 3kWh active solar system, you’re offsetting the need for that 
much power from your utility company. But you’re saving about 9kWh of 
total power consumption because of inefficiencies. Therefore, you’re actually 
saving much more than 3kWh, as well as the associated carbon footprint.
Table 1-1 can help you calculate your own carbon footprint. Table 1-2 
provides an example of a calculation.

To find how much carbon dioxide you produce by using home fossil fuels, 
multiply the amount of fuel you use by the value in the second column, the 
pounds of CO2 per unit. For example, suppose you use 400 gallons of home 
heating oil; you produce 8,960 pounds of carbon dioxide per year:
400 gal/yr × 22.4 lbs. CO2/gal = 8,960 lbs. CO2/yr.
And here’s your carbon emissions for the 50 gallons of liquid propane you 
may use for your barbecue:
50 gal./yr × 12.7 lbs. CO2/gal = 635 lbs. CO2/yr
And here’s the footprint for using 1 ton of firewood in a year:
1 ton/yr × 3,814 lbs. CO2/ton = 3,814 lbs. CO2/yr
Add those together, and your home fossil fuel consumption produces 13,409 
pounds of carbon dioxide per year. You can cut way down on that if you 
switch to solar heating and cooking.
Calculate also your carbon emissions from electricity use. This number 
depends on how your local power generators operate. Nuclear reactors emit 
very little carbon, and coal-fired generators emit quite a bit. The average 
North American value is 1.33 pounds of CO2 per kWh. If you’re using nuclear 
energy, you can reduce this number to about 1.0 or less. If you’re strictly 
relying on coal-fired electricity, the number could go as high as 2.0.
Here’s how you find out the carbon dioxide output if you use 10,000 kWh of 
energy:
10,000 kWh/yr × 1.33 lbs. CO2/kWh = 40,000 lbs. CO2/yr (Youch!)

Book VII: Solar Power 
Enjoying solar’s unlimited supply
At sea level, on a sunny, clear day, 1 kWh of sunlight power is falling onto a 
1-square-meter surface. Over the course of a sunny day, you can realistically 
expect to capture around 6 kWh of total energy from this same surface area. 
That’s 180 kWh per month. Five square meters is enough to completely replace 
a typical monthly power bill! If only it was so easy.
 
If you were to build an active solar panel measuring 100 miles by 100 miles 
in sunny Nevada, you’d be able to produce enough power to handle all the 
United States’ electrical requirements (except when it rained a lot!).
Exercising your legal rights to sunlight
You have legal rights to your sunlight; nobody can build up so that your solar 
exposures are affected. Government acknowledges value in the amount of 
sunlight that hits your home.
 
You have a legal right to demand that your neighbors remove trees and other 
impediments to your solar access. If a neighbor’s trees are shading your 
property, you can do something about it. Remember, though, this right goes 
both ways. If you’re shading somebody else’s property, he can force you to 
remedy the situation. Check with your local governments to see what sorts of 
laws apply to your specifics.
Appreciating solar energy’s versatility
You can use solar energy in many ways, each with different costs and 
complexity. Solar power enables you to do any of the following:
 
 Generate electricity for general use: You can install a solar electric 
generating system that allows you to reduce your electric bills to zero.
 
 Cook: Using the sun and your vivid imagination, along with a few 
easy-to-build ovens and heaters, solar power can help you put dinner 
on the table.
 
 Practice passive space heating: The sun can heat your house by strategic 
use of blinds, awnings, sunrooms and the like.
 
 Heat water: Use solar energy to heat your domestic water supply — or 
let sun-warmed water heat your house. You may need no electrical 
pumps or moving parts other than the water itself.
 
 Pump water: You can slowly pump water into a tank when the sun is 
shining and then get the water back anytime you want. You can also 
make your tank absorb sunlight and heat the water.

 Heat your swimming pool: A solar blanket heats your pool cheaply and 
efficiently. Or you can install solar hot water heating panels on your roof 
that can heat your pool year-round.
 
 Light up your landscape: You can put small, inexpensive solar lights 
around your yard and eliminate the need for high-priced overhead light-
ing powered by the utility company. With advances in technology, these 
lights actually look and work better than hard-wired versions.
 
 Provide indoor lighting: The technological boom in light-emitting 
diodes (LEDs) — small, electronic lights that take very little current 
and provide long lifetimes — has enabled a number of effective solar 
lighting systems for in-home use with very low power requirements. 
You can light your porches and even rooms in your house with a small, 
off-grid photovoltaic system connected to a battery. During the day, the 
battery charges so that you have enough juice at night to do the job.
 
 Power remote dwellings: You can completely power a remote cabin, 
RV, or boat with solar.
Acknowledging the Dents in the Crown
Solar sounds great! You’re ready to go! But solar isn’t all fun and games. The 
pros outweigh the cons — especially when you look at the big picture — but 
you should still understand the drawbacks. This section explains a few things 
to remember when working with solar energy.
Initial costs and falling prices
Going solar requires an upfront expense. When you go solar, you get a good 
payback on your investment, but you do have to put out cash upfront. Most 
people don’t want to bother, and many don’t have the cash. (Chapter 4 of 
this book gives you ideas for financing your solar investments.)
Reliability and timing
Solar works only when the sun is shining. If you want energy at night or on a 
dark day in the winter, you need either batteries or other energy resources. 
What makes sense in Phoenix doesn’t necessarily make sense in Seattle. 
Ultimately, solar relies on Mother Nature’s generosity, and this varies from 
region to region. In fact, it even varies over different locations at your home.
Also, timing of energy use is everything. In a typical scenario, solar energy 
availability is often at its peak when the household power demands are minimal.

Book VII: Solar Power 
It’s out of phase with need. This scenario isn’t much of a problem with solar 
water heaters because they inherently store the energy for later use. But 
solar electric requires either batteries for energy storage or a special system 
called an intertie, which connects to your public utility.
On a typical winter day, for example, the heater is on all night but turned low, 
and the lights and appliances are off. In the morning, the family turns up the 
heater, turns on lights, takes hot showers, cooks breakfast, and gets ready 
for school and work. Then everybody leaves, and the day warms up so the 
heater shuts down. At the end of the afternoon, when the sun is on its way 
down, everybody returns. Lights are turned on, the heater’s turned up, a log 
is tossed into the fireplace, cooking begins in earnest, the kids play video 
games and make a big mess, the vacuum is run, and so on.
Red tape and aesthetically 
minded neighbors
You may have to work around building codes. Bureaucrats are a big hassle, 
and interfacing with government agencies is frustrating. In addition, only 
qualified contractors should install complex electrical systems.
Also, most solar panels are ugly. Nobody wants to look at them. If they’re your 
own and you’re benefiting, it’s acceptable. If they belong to your neighbors, it’s 
a different story. In some communities, solar panels are forbidden. Many 
homeowners associations have covenants that prohibit solar panels altogether, 
but this situation is changing; in fact, most legal challenges to solar panels are 
being stricken by the courts in favor of environmental conscience. At some 
point, the federal government will likely enter the picture and prohibit all 
banning of solar panels. Several ongoing efforts are working to make solar 
panels less obtrusive, so this problem will become less important over time.
Effort and upkeep
Going solar takes work. Making good decisions about solar power can be 
difficult unless you’ve done your homework. And not only do you have to do 
some research, but you also have to work with the equipment itself. Here are 
some issues to consider:
 
 You face some dangers. Active systems can shock you if you don’t know 
what you’re doing. Water heating systems can scald you. You’re much 
safer sitting in front of your TV than climbing around installing solar 
equipment.

 You face equipment challenges in freezing weather. Solar water heat-
ing panels can freeze up in the winter. You have to pay attention to how 
they’re working. Most new solar thermal heating systems get around the 
freezing problem by using some form of anti-freeze, but a good number 
of existing and new systems still use water. The antifreeze systems are 
more expensive. If you don’t need one, you don’t want to pay the extra 
cost, so water-based systems will always be available.
 
 You’re on your own for upkeep and repairs. If you get your power 
from the power company, keeping things maintained and running is 
its problem. If you have a big array of solar panels on your roof, it’s 
your problem. If they break, you pay. When they get old, you update.
Small to Supergiant: Choosing 
Your Level of Commitment
No matter where you start, you can always expand your solar system. For 
example, you can invest in a small photovoltaic system for your rooftop and 
then expand it as you go, spreading the investment costs over a long period 
of time. The following sections show you ways to get involved.
Small- to midsized projects
From installing landscape lighting to a stand-alone photovoltaic powered attic 
vent fan, you can begin investing in solar today with minimal cost and effort. 
The small-scale projects feature safe operating levels. (Typical voltages in a 
photovoltaic system are so low that you won’t be able to get a shock.) And 
if you’re no good with tools, have no fear. Some of the projects don’t even 
require a screwdriver — you can buy off-the-shelf solutions that you can use 
out of the box.
You can also do a number of things in your yard to improve the solar 
exposure of your home. Deciduous trees (which shed their leaves in the fall) 
planted strategically about your house can ensure summertime cooling while 
allowing solar energy to help warm your house in the winter. Planting bushes 
in the right spots can reduce the cooling effect of wind, especially around 
your pool. And you can also increase the breezes flowing through your house 
by strategically arranging trees and bushes.

DeGunther for instructions on tackling a range of solar projects and to find 
out about some of the larger projects you might want to hire a specialist to 
add to your home.

Book VII: Solar Power 
 
If you’re intending to install a full-scale solar energy system in your home, a 
great way to find out about the character of solar energy is to start with the 
simpler projects. You discover the importance of good solar exposure, and 
you determine when and how solar works the best — as well as the worst. 
You’ll be in a better position to make good decisions on how to invest the big 
bucks when the time comes.
Large projects
Full-scale photovoltaic energy generators are the king of the mountain these 
days. You probably won’t be able to install one of these systems on your own.
Greenhouses are attractive, and you can grow your own food in them, 
year-round in some climates. But you can also use a greenhouse or sunroom 
to provide a warm room in the winter.
Off-grid living means there’s no utility company power coming into your home 
at all. You can use a solar power system, backed up with a gasoline-powered 
generator, to provide all the power you’ll ever need. It’s not for everybody, 
and it really doesn’t make much sense unless you’re living so far away from 
the utilities that just running the lines to your house would cost a ton. But for 
some of the more independent-minded readers, it’s the only way to go.
Designing a solar home from scratch
Designing a solar home from scratch is clearly the most efficient way to 
achieve solar energy advantages. Most existing homes are inefficient in 
a number of ways. Insulation may be lacking. Sunlight exposure was not 
thought out — it’s just what happened when the house was built on the lot. 
But when you design your own home, you can control all the variables. You 
can achieve excellent sunlight in the morning, for example, while blocking off 
the afternoon heat.
You can shelter for wind by taking advantage of existing trees and cover. Best 
of all, you can build your roof to achieve perfect solar exposure.
You can also ensure energy efficiency by using the right materials and building 
techniques. The fact is, a good house design can make it so that you don’t need 
much energy at all. What could be better for the environment?

o matter how giddy the possibilities of solar make you, no matter how 
desperately you might want to run out and get started on bringing 
cleaner, cheaper energy into your life, careful thought is warranted before you 
take your green self down to the showroom to start picking out equipment. 
This stuff is expensive, in a lot of cases, and you may be entering into extensive 
changes to your biggest investment — your home. All that’s worth careful 
consideration, eh?
In this chapter, you find out a little bit about how solar works and a lot about 
how your location might limit your possibilities and how you can ascertain 
the potential benefits of your investment.
Using Sunlight Converted into Heat
When a photon (light particle) strikes a surface that absorbs light, the pho-
ton’s energy is transformed into heat. Heat, or thermal energy, is simply 
motion. A hot surface has a lot of molecular motion, and hot objects can burn 
you because they pass their excessive energy right into your skin.
Many solar applications require sunlight to be converted into heat. Then you 
want to transfer that heat and change it into a usable form, usually in a loca-
tion removed from where the heat is captured. Heat can move from one spot 
to another in several ways:

594
Book VII: Solar Power 
 
 Conduction: In conduction, energy is transferred between molecules 
within a substance. Only heat moves, not the molecules. (Well, mol-
ecules are always moving, but the molecules tend to vibrate in place 
rather than switch places.) Heat always moves from a hotter surface to 
a cooler surface. (Technically speaking, heat moves in both directions, 
but statistically the most movement occurs from hotter to cooler.) 
Copper is an excellent conductor of heat. In fact, most good conductors 
of electricity are also good heat conductors. Glass is a poor conductor 
of heat and electricity and is therefore considered an insulator.
 
 Convection: Convection is the transfer of heat between a fixed, rigid surface 
and a moving fluid in contact with that surface or the transfer of heat as 
molecules move from one point to another within the fluid. A fluid is any 
substance that can flow, so air is also considered a fluid. As opposed to 
conduction, the hot molecules themselves move and switch places.
 
 Water flowing over a hot surface becomes hot. In a tank of water, the 
hotter molecules expand and weigh less and move upward while gravity 
draws the colder, heavier molecules down. This heat exchange is called 
thermosiphon, and it’s a type of convection.
 
 Radiation: A hot object emits infrared radiation. The sun is a perfect 
radiator. Fires radiate heat, a lot of which you can see. A really hot fire 
glows white; all wavelengths in the spectrum are present. As the fire cools 
down, the color changes to orange, then to red, and finally, when you 
can’t see the embers anymore but can still feel the heat, the radiation is 
entirely infrared. The colors reflect the energy content of the fire.
Keeping the heat where you want it
Solar heat collectors are designed to collect as much solar radiation as 
possible. Not only do you want to maximize surface area, but you also want 
to orient the collector in a way that maximizes the amount of solar radiation 
gathered over the course of a day. Solar heat collectors also ought to do the 
following, all of which affect what kind of materials go where in your solar 
collector:
 
 Convert that radiation into heat as efficiently as possible. This 
conversion almost always entails the use of a black surface, which 
absorbs radiation efficiently.
 
 Transfer the heat into a usable medium. In most cases, you want to 
heat water. If you collect the heat in a black tube, you can simply run 
water through that tube, and the heat naturally transfers into the water. 
You can also use other fluids, such as antifreeze fluid.
 
 To move heat effectively, a material needs to be a good conductor (or as 
physicists like to say, it needs to have high thermal conductivity).

595
 Chapter 2: Preparing for a Switch to Solar
Book VII
Solar 
Power
 
 Insulate to prevent heat loss. For insulators, you want to use materials 
that make for poor conductors. Converting radiation into heat in the 
wintertime is easy, but then the cold weather and wind simply steal the 
heat right back. In order to prevent this loss, people insulate the collector 
from the outside world with materials, such as fiberglass insulation, or 
double-pane glass windows.
 
 Store a sufficient amount of heat. Heat capacity is a measure of how 
much heat energy (in British thermal units, or Btus) is required to raise 
the temperature of a given volume of a material by 1°F. To be effective 
at storing heat, a material needs a high heat capacity. Table 2-1 shows 
some materials of interest.

Heat Capacity of Common Materials

So the ideal material for storing and moving heat needs to have a high heat 
capacity and also has to be a good conductor. Although wood and concrete 
store a lot of heat, you can’t move it into or out of these materials very easily. 
Steel is very good, but it rusts. Of course, water is the cheapest, so it’s used 
to store and transfer heat, but the problem is that it doesn’t absorb radiation 
because it’s clear. Copper painted black absorbs, stores, and conducts heat 
extremely well, so copper is used extensively in solar heat collectors.
Converting sunlight into electricity: 
Photovoltaic cells
Most people are familiar with photovoltaic cells (PV cells). You see them 
on calculators, the kind that don’t require batteries. You see PV panels on 
people’s roofs and on businesses and schools and government buildings. 
Remote telephones along the interstates have PV panels poised overhead.

596
Book VII: Solar Power 
A standard PV cell, shown in Figure 2-1, is a thin semiconductor sandwich, 
with two layers of highly purified silicon. A semiconductor is a crystal that 
is constructed in such a way as to yield certain specific properties that 
can be used in electrical circuits. Transistors are made of semiconductors. 
Microprocessors are as well. In fact, the entire field of modern electronics 
uses various forms of semiconductors, so the implications are worldly. If you 
connect an electrical circuit to your semiconductor sandwich when sunlight 
is shining on it, electricity flows.

voltaic cell

Junction
Photovoltaic arrays are nothing more than huge matrices of interconnected 
semiconductor sandwiches. The color appears shiny blue. Usable PV sys-
tems are comprised of all sorts of equipment that protects the user from 
electrical shock, stores the electricity in battery banks, and converts the 
direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC), which is what people use in 
their houses. But at the heart of each system is a simple conversion process 
like that shown in Figure 2-1.
Evaluating Your Solar Potential
Depending on where you live geographically — and the orientation and expo-
sure of your particular house or business — you get more or less usable sun-
shine. Even within small, localized regions, weather patterns vary because of 
topography and landscape details like trees and ponds. So two identical solar 
systems separated by a few miles but otherwise built and operated identi-
cally may yield different energy outputs averaged over a period of time.
Weather is today’s phenomenon, but climate is a description of the general 
weather patterns over a long period of time. It may be cold and rainy in Los 
Angeles today, and that’s the weather, but the climate is warm and temperate. 
Good solar designers assess climate particulars to enhance system performance. 
Climate includes elements such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed.
Here’s a look at how climate can affect your solar system:

597
 Chapter 2: Preparing for a Switch to Solar
Book VII
Solar 
Power
 
 Sunlight: Climate dictates how much sunlight you can expect annually. 
That the Southwest gets the most sunshine per day — and that Canada 
and the northern states get the least — should come as no surprise. The 
sun is higher in the sky in the southern states, so the days are longer.
 
 Snowfall: You want to locate your panels so they avoid being inundated 
with heavy layers of snow. For example, some locations on your roof will 
experience very shallow snow buildups as compared to other parts of 
your roof. Also, some parts of your roof may be warmer than others due 
to proximity to heaters, exhausts, chimneys, and so on.
 
 Cloud cover: If you’re living in a cloudy region, you still have solar 
energy, and it’s generally diffused (spread out). As a result, collector 
panel orientation isn’t so critical because light will be coming in at many 
different angles rather than just directly overhead from the sun.
  
 Smog: Air pollution and smog affect the amount of sunlight you can 
expect to receive. If you do live in an area with heavy air pollution, 
expect less system output over an extended period of time.
 
 Air density: You get better solar exposure in the mountains than near sea 
level simply because the air is thinner and scatters less sunlight. You can 
make an approximate estimate of how clear your air is by simply observing 
how blue the sky is on a clear day. Thick air scatters more red light, and so 
the appearance of the sky is less blue and more white.
 
 Temperature: With PV systems (not solar water heaters), the lower 
the temperature, the happier the semiconductors, and the greater the 
output. You can get more system output on a cold, clear day than a 
warm, sunny day.
 
 Frequent fog: If you’re living in an area that’s foggy and misty in the morn-
ing (in the San Francisco Bay Area, for example) but the mist burns off into 
a clear sky by noon, you want to orient your solar panels more westward to 
optimize the amount of sunlight you can achieve over the course of a day.
 
 Wind: If you have a lot of wind, you need to consider where you mount 
your solar equipment for a couple of reasons:
 
• Wind can tear equipment off of its mounting hardware and result in 
expensive repairs, not to mention dangerous conditions. If you’re 
in a windy climate, you need to make sure that you specify heavy-
duty mounting equipment. Mounting schemes all have wind speed 
specifications; pay close attention because mishaps are expensive.
 
• Wind cools surfaces very efficiently. If you have a swimming pool, 
one of your best bets is to install landscaping that breaks the rush 
of wind that will cool the pool water much more than your intuition 
would indicate. Solar water heating panels may heat the water very 
effectively, but it doesn’t make much sense to install expensive solar 
panels without addressing wind cooling first, because adding a few 
bushes and trees will be much cheaper than adding extra collector 
capacity. Plus, living things frankly look nicer than solar equipment 
and good for the environment, to boot.

598
Book VII: Solar Power 
 
You can obtain generalized information and maps about the nation’s solar 
resources from the following The National Renewable Energy Laboratory 
(www.nrel.gov), which has a solar resources section on its Web site, and 
from National Climatic Data Center (www.ncdc.noaa.gov).
Analyzing Solar Investments
An important factor to consider when deciding how much money to earmark 
toward each investment is the risk profile. Some investments entail more risk 
than others. A bank is much safer than the stock market, for example. When 
an investment entails more risk, it needs to offer more of a chance for gain to 
offset the increased risk.
The following sections outline a system for analyzing solar investments. The 
goal is to compare different investment options using the same criteria of 
costs, gains, and risks and then choose the best one.
Calculating net costs
The first step in calculating payback is to calculate costs. Here you find out 
how to calculate net costs, the total net amount that you’re paying for your 
solar investment. These days, most solar investments are eligible for rebates 
and tax advantages, which are subtracted from the “retail” cost of a system.
Collecting cost data
The typical solar system has many cost components, and the sum total of 
all the individual costs must be added up to yield the total cost. Note also 
that the timing of the costs is important, as well as the timing of the rebates 
and tax advantages. Timing is important because of the basic idea that a 
dollar today is worth more than a dollar in one year, the difference being 
given by current interest rates. So the result of a cost compilation will usu-
ally be a timeline rather than a single number.
 Consider the following factors:
 
 Equipment: Sometimes equipment costs are spread out over time — 
for example, if you get financing from a supplier or different parts of a 
system are delivered at different times. You need to specify the timeline, 
as well as the dollar value of each outlay.
 
 Installation costs: If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, you won’t have to worry 
about installation. If you hire out, installation costs may be either fixed 
or an hourly rate, depending on the complexity of the job.

599
 Chapter 2: Preparing for a Switch to Solar
Book VII
Solar 
Power
 
 Refuse: Add in costs if you’ll pay to have project trash hauled away.
 
 Maintenance: Consider the likelihood that you’ll have to pay for 
servicing — and when that may occur, so you know whether it’s likely to 
be covered by warranty.
 
 Taxes, permits, fees: Note when such charges are due.
 
 Interest: If you finance your equipment, the interest is a cost.
 
 Taxes: Many states have legislation that lets you install solar equipment 
without paying higher property taxes, but you should find out whether 
it applies to you. (See Chapter 4 for details on state incentives.) In rare 
cases, property taxes may go up as a result of a solar investment.
Subtracting estimated gains and discounts
You recover some of your expenses right away, so you can subtract that 
amount from your costs. For example, you may be able to take advantage 
of rebates and subsidies offered by utilities, state and federal governments, 
manufacturers, and so on. Or if you’re installing equipment for your home 
business or office, you may be able to depreciate certain items. (See Chapter 
4 of this book for details.)
You also need to consider both salvage (if you can sell some of the old 
equipment you’ll be taking out) and appreciation — the value of your home 
goes up when you install solar. The appreciation amount depends on the 
following:
 
 The cost for a homebuyer to put in new equipment personally: Don’t 
expect to get much more than that. However, if the cost of new solar 
equipment increases, the value of your equipment can also go up. 
Equipment can increase in value if inflation becomes significant or if the 
demand for solar equipment increases (supply versus demand).
 
 The amount of documentable energy savings achieved with the 
equipment: Your energy bills provide proof of the energy savings 
achieved.
 
 Changes in energy costs: The more energy costs rise (all energy), the 
more your equipment — and thus your property — is worth.
 
 Popularity: Some things sell because they’re trendy. In some real estate 
markets, a solar home is worth a lot more than the same model with 
conventional energy.
 
Giving a ballpark about how much appreciation you can expect is impossible, 
but the most likely case is that you’ll get around 25 percent more than new 
equipment costs. Best case, you may double your original investment after 
five years. Worst case, you may not get anything at all if the equipment is old 
and obsolete.

600
Book VII: Solar Power 
Figuring out monthly savings
With most solar investments, lowering monthly utility bills is the ultimate 
goal. Here’s how to calculate your potential savings:
 
1. Look at your power bills and determine your average monthly energy 
use (gas or electric).
 
 Use the electric bill if the new system will reduce your use of electricity, 
the gas bill if it’ll reduce your gas use.
 
 Suppose, for example, that you want to replace an electric water heater 
with a solar one. You look at your power bills and find that you use an 
average of 1,000 kWh of electricity per month.
 
2. Out of that number, estimate how much energy the system you’re 
replacing uses or how much energy the new system produces.
 
 In the example, perhaps an energy audit tells you that water heating 
makes up 20 percent of your total electric bill. (See Chapter 2 of Book II 
for more on energy audits.)
 
 To estimate output of a PV system, use the specifications given for the 
proposed equipment and modify them up or down depending on your 
solar exposure. Ultimately, you’re going to be making an educated 
guess. The best way to get a good estimate is to ask your professional 
contractor because he has experience and local empirical data. If you’re 
a do-it-yourselfer, the problem is more difficult. The best way to account 
for the inescapably hazy nature of projections is to be conservative and 
see how the economics come out. Then redo the calculations with opti-
mistic numbers and see how the payback calculations turn out.
 
3. Multiply your average monthly energy costs by the percentage you 
found in Step 2 to figure out how much you save per month.
 
 At $0.15 per kWh, suppose the total monthly bill is $150:
 
 $150 × 20% = $30
 
 The solar water heater therefore saves you $30 per month.
 
As energy costs rise, your savings increase even more. The Energy 
Information Administration reported that from 1996 to 2007, electricity 
energy costs increased an average of 2.2 percent per year (www.eia.doe.
gov/emeu/steo/pub/contents.html), and the change may be even 
greater in the future — or in your region of the country.

601
 Chapter 2: Preparing for a Switch to Solar
Book VII
Solar 
Power
Figuring payback
Payback is the amount of time you need to hold on to your investment for it 
to pay for itself. In the case of solar, almost the entire investment is upfront, 
meaning you have to invest cash before you see a single dime of savings.
Payback is measured in years or months. You simply take the net costs of 
your solar system (costs minus discounts and appreciation — see the earlier 
“Calculating net costs” section) and divide it by your anticipated monthly 
savings (see “Figuring out monthly savings”). For example, if you invest 
$2,000 in a solar water heater that saves $30 a month in electric costs, here’s 
your payback period:
$2,000 ÷ $30/month ≈ 67 months, or 5.6 years
Analyzing risk
No investment is risk-free. The following elements can affect the returns you 
get on your investment:
 
 Repairs and maintenance: Solar equipment is not simple when it’s 
doing a big job. And being outdoors all the time is wearing, especially in 
extreme climates. (How’d you like to be strapped to a roof 24/7?) You 
can’t always anticipate when something will break down, and if your 
equipment has problems after the warranty expires, your costs go up.
 
 Efficiency decreases over time, just as it does for autos and humans 
and pretty much everything. PV panels may see a 15-percent decline in 
ten years. It’s harder to estimate the decline in water systems, but it’s on 
the same order, unless you’re using hard water or have well water with 
a lot of sediment. Use 15 percent per ten years in your calculations for a 
good approximation.
 
 Lifetime: Eventually, every system will simply not be worth running 
anymore. PV systems are warranted up to 20 years, water systems for 
up to 15. However, it’s not as bad as that, because what the warranties 
really cover is guaranteed performance. You will probably be able to 
run your systems for much longer than the warranties, but they simply 
won’t be putting out the same performance.

602
Book VII: Solar Power 
 
 Inexperience: If you design and install a system yourself, the perfor-
mance may not be as good as you planned. The experts know all the 
little tricks, but you don’t. Savings can suffer, and you may have to pay 
an expert to come in and set things straight.
 
 Newer, more efficient technologies: People like new things because 
they’re new. The bottom line with a solar system is the performance it’s 
putting out, but it may be true that a homebuyer simply doesn’t like a 
system that’s 10 years old simply because it’s 10 years old. Newer equip-
ment is always more efficient as well. This increased efficiency rarely 
results in a situation that merits tossing out old equipment that is still 
working, but it may make a difference to a prospective buyer.
Accounting for the intangibles
Good decisions aren’t just predicated on dollars and cents. You also need to 
consider the intangibles, such as aesthetic beauty and pollution mitigation, 
among others. Not everything comes with a price tag, but you certainly need to 
factor in how much these elements are worth to you. You can do this calculation 
by either assigning dollar values, as best you can, or making a list of priorities 
so that if two potential options have the same numerical score (payback 
calculation), one option will win over the other based on the intangibles.
Allowing for drawbacks
You should account for any inconvenience. Note whether your system is going 
to require more work on your part. Solar water heaters, for example, take 
maintenance. Decide whether you’re going to do it or hire someone else to do it 
for you. In addition, when you install a solar system, you’re introducing dangers 
into your house: electrical shocks. Scalding water. Falling off a roof. Discovering 
stepladder malfunctions. Think about whether you’re okay accepting these risks.
Also factor in your feelings about the look of your house and how that may 
affect resale value. Some solar equipment can be ugly. Do the pipes running 
up the side of your house look industrial? Do photovoltaic panels make your 
house look unearthly?
Considering priceless benefits
Think about visual improvements. For example, if you invest in a maple tree, 
you get shading in the summer, which is a form of solar system performance, 
but the greater pleasure is having a nice tree near your house. When you 
invest in window coverings, you enjoy better insulation by virtue of the fact 
that you can shade your home’s interior from solar radiation, but the greater 
gain is probably in the remodel.

Don’t forget environmental improvements: When you invest in solar, you’re 
saving a lot of carbon dioxide, and you’re also helping with national energy 
independence.
Examining Real-Life Scenarios
Compare your own solar investment decisions with these examples and you 
can get a good idea of how your investment stacks up. In most cases, just 
substitute in your own numbers. In some cases, you may have to adjust the 
model to fit your exact situation.
 
Decisions often come down to the details of your rate structure. You can find 
it on your power bill. You may be able to change your rate structure with a 
simple call to the utility. Some allow for choices. In fact, you may be able to 
save some money simply by changing your rate structure.
Supplementing an existing 
water heater with solar
To calculate payback, first find the monthly energy savings. Suppose 
Household X uses an average of 1,000 kWh of electricity per month. At $0.15 
per kWh, the monthly cost is $150. An energy audit determines that water 
heating makes up 18 percent of the total electric bill, at a cost of $27 per 
month. (See the earlier “Figuring out monthly savings” section for details on 
such calculations.) With the solar water heater, that amount drops to zero, 
so $27 is its monthly savings.
Then determine the net cost of the equipment. A solar water heating system 
costs $2,000, including parts and installation. A federal government tax credit 
of 30 percent is available, for a total of $600. The net cost is $1,400. The 
warranty is for five years, so the homeowners won’t have to pay maintenance 
costs for the first 60 months.
To recover the initial investment of $1,400, Household X will need
$1,400 ÷ $27/month ≈ 52 months
That’s a good investment. A solar water heater may last about 20 years, and 
Household X is making a profit within the first 5 years.

Putting money in a bank or stock market
Here’s how some other investments stack up: Put $1,000 in a savings account 
at 6 percent, and you gain compounded interest. You have $1,000 in interest 12 
years after you make your original investment, which is the payback period. At 
any point in time, you can pull your money back out of the bank, with zero risk.
If you put your money into the stock market and get a return of 12 percent, 
the payback period is only six years. But the value of your stock could also 
go down in value, maybe all the way to zero. Because the risk is much higher 
in the stock market, you insist on a higher potential gain or else you’ll just 
put your money into a bank.
A good general rule is the Rule of 72: To find the number of years required to 
double your money at a given interest rate, just divide the interest rate into 
72. For a 12-percent return:
72 ÷ 12 = 6 years
Accounting for pollution
Suppose that you’re installing a solar water heater in an area where the climate 
is northern. There isn’t as much sunshine, and the winters are colder. Cost 
savings are $13.50 per month (or half as much as in the preceding section). For 
this example, assume constant energy costs, which is probably a simplification. 
(The point here is to illustrate how you can account for pollution.) When the 
monthly savings are cut in half, the payback period for a $1,400 water heater is 
twice as long — about 104 months. This number isn’t much different from the 
return (or payback) you can get at a bank, where there’s zero risk and you can 
take your money back out whenever you want. When you invest in solar, you’re 
stuck with what you’ve got. This is a bad investment.
But how much is it worth to reduce pollution? Ten dollars a month? Twenty? 
How much would you pay to completely eliminate your carbon footprint 
altogether? $1,000 a year?
Out of your total carbon footprint (see Chapter 2 of this book), figure out 
how much CO2 the old water heater contributes. The typical carbon foot-
print is around 40,000 pounds per year. The typical footprint from a water 
heater is 3,000 pounds per year, or 7.5 percent of the total.
If you’re willing to spend $1,000 a year on pollution mitigation, you’d spend 
7.5 percent of this on heating water. That’s $75 per year, or $6.25 per month. 
Add this amount to the savings column, and instead of only $13.50 per 
month, the real savings is $19.75. This number makes the payback 71 months, 
which is a better proposition:

605
 Chapter 2: Preparing for a Switch to Solar
Book VII
Solar 
Power
$1,400 ÷ ($13.50 + $6.25) ≈ 71 months
If you’d spend $2,000 a year eliminating pollution, total cost savings are $27 
per month, which is all the way back to the original example with a payback 
of 52 months (see the preceding section). This is a good investment.
Reaping rewards of rising energy costs
What if energy costs rise 12 percent per year instead of staying flat? That 
percentage is higher than historical norms, but it’s not difficult to imagine 
how this might come to be, with all the pressure coming to bear on the 
energy markets. When energy costs rise, each year the savings grow. Perhaps 
your $1,400 solar water heater saves you $27 per month the first year. But 
the next year the savings grow to $30.24 per month ($27 × 1.12). Then $33.87 
($30.24 × 1.12), then $37.93, then $42.49, and so on. Look at the yearly savings 
to see how they add up:
Year 
Monthly Savings 
Annual Savings 
Cost Left to Recoup
1 
$27 
$324 
$1,076
2 
$30.24 
$362.88 
$713.12
3 
$33.87 
$406.43 
$306.69
4 
$37.93 
$455.20 
–$148.51
The payback in this case is 44 months (down from 52 months if the energy 
costs were to stay the same).
 
Regardless of how high energy costs go, the amount that you spend on 
heating water is locked in at zero. This is a form of hedging, or making an 
investment that reduces risk.
Thinking about tiered rate structures
In a tiered rate structure, the more energy you use, the more you pay per kWh. 
So in California, for example, not all watts are created equal. Some tiered rate 
structures are very punitive, with the highest rates three or four times the 
base rate. Solar system savings come from the highest tier first. In such a rate 
structure, cost savings can easily be twice as much. Payback is therefore half 
as long.
A solar water heater may offset 18 percent of the household energy use, but 
this may account for more like 35 percent of the total dollar value in a typical 
tiered rate structure.

606
Book VII: Solar Power 
In a tiered rate structure, small investments work best. As the size of your 
investment grows, the payback gets worse because you get less and less 
return on your investment.
Appreciating a solar home’s 
increase in value
Suppose that some homeowners decide to sell five years after installing a 
solar water heater. Energy costs are rising, and monthly savings from the 
solar water heating system are now $48 per month, or $600 per year. A home 
buyer will pay more for the home because of this built-in cost reduction.
How much more? New systems cost $2,800, and tax rebates are a thing of the 
past because everybody and their brother are now in the market for solar. A 
lot of work is involved, and most buyers don’t want to do it. They’d have to 
read some highly technical books, for example. (Unfortunately, they didn’t 
know about this handy guide.)
Even more importantly, most homebuyers use mortgages, where balancing 
monthly payments with a fixed income is the game. Forty-eight dollars per 
month in cost-savings translate into $48 that can be spent somewhere else. A 
buyer could get a larger mortgage, for example. For $50 a month, after taxes, 
you can borrow $14,000. So although putting in their own solar system may 
be an option (after the purchase) for homebuyers, they also have a strong 
incentive to purchase existing solar equipment with their mortgage.
In terms of appreciation, the homeowners are likely to get about 125 percent 
of the price of new equipment. For the example, a 25-percent appreciation 
would be $3,500 (that is, $2,800 times 125 percent). Suppose that with rising 
energy costs, the original investment of $1,400 paid for itself in 44 months 
(see the preceding section). After that, the cost savings were all pure profit. 
At 60 months, the sellers get a further profit of $2,100 at the sale of the house.
Financing solar investments 
with a home equity loan
 
Many solar investments end up saving their owners more on energy costs 
than the payments on a mortgage equity loan used to purchase a solar 
system. You pay no upfront cost when you finance an investment. You do 
have to pay off the loan at some point, but from day one, you save more than 
you pay. Your cash flow is in the black.

607
 Chapter 2: Preparing for a Switch to Solar
Book VII
Solar 
Power
Suppose that you borrow $1,400 for a solar water heater with a promise of 
$27 per month in savings. An interest-only home equity line of credit at 6-
percent tax-deductible interest for the $1,400 is only $8 per month (from 
mortgage payment tables). That’s a net gain of $19 per month.
Here’s the payback period for this scenario:
$1,400 ÷ $19/month = 74 months
At some point the loan is repaid (principal payments usually kick in after five 
to ten years), although most equity loans get paid off when the house is sold 
or refinanced. When it’s sold, you often get more for your solar equipment 
than what you paid. (See the preceding section for details.)
Replacing broken water heaters
When your water heater crashes, doing nothing is not an option. Now you must 
spend money, probably a good chunk. How much more do you have to spend 
for a solar system? Probably not much. Now’s really the time to go for it.
For example, a solar water heating system costs $3,000, and a conventional 
water heater costs $1,400. The difference is only $1,600 (And if you factor in 
rebates and subsidies, the difference may be zero.), whereas if you take out a 
working water heater in order to upgrade to solar, the real investment is the 
entire $3,000.
Diving in to swimming pool solar heaters
A solar pool heater does not save money — except when you compare it 
to all the other options. Solar collectors load the filter pump (make it run 
harder) so it costs more to run — sometimes a lot more. If you want a lot of 
heat, you have to run the filter pump for upwards of 8 hours a day. This extra 
pump time is solar-system cost, and if you’re in a tiered rate structure, it can 
add up to quite a bit. If you’re in a time-of-use structure (pricing that varies 
according to when you use electricity), you also get dinged because you need 
to run your pump at peak times (midafternoon, when it’s sunniest).
When you invest in a solar pool heater, the only gain is comfort, and that’s 
hard to value. But people pay a lot for solar pool heaters. In some areas, 
they’re on every roof. Ask an owner, and he’ll probably tell you they’re great. 
Pools cost upwards of $25,000. Another $3,000 to make it much more enjoy-
able isn’t a bad investment. Your swimming season will be extended — a solar 
heater may triple the amount of time swimmers actually spend in the pool, as 
opposed to around it.

608
Book VII: Solar Power 
The other options are insane: a big, gas heater that gobbles propane, or 
electric, with a 24/7 spinning power meter. (You could light a big fire and boil 
water, but that’s labor intensive.) A solar pool heater not only heats your 
pool much cheaper than the other options, but the pollution effects are 
infinitely better.
Blowing hot air
The investment: an attic vent fan powered by PV panels. Equipment costs 
$350, and installation takes two hours and requires brains, ladders, roof 
climbing, and decent tools.
An energy audit determines that the fan will save $25 per month in air-
conditioning costs over a four-month summer period. At $100 per year, the 
payback is only 3.5 years.
You also boost your comfort. The house is a lot more comfortable on the 
days when it isn’t hot enough to turn the AC on. And because the fan lets hot 
air escape, you get more of these days.
The alternatives to installing a solar fan? Not installing anything at all and 
paying for all that extra air conditioning or installing a hard-wired fan for more 
than $1,500 because you need a licensed electrician to do the installation, as 
well as county inspections and permits.
Working with solar in your home office
You can go off the power grid with a home office. A remote cabin solar 
power kit costs $1,000, with 12 volts DC (direct current) output and a battery 
so power is always available. You can use the system to run DC lights, a 
vent fan, coffee maker, radio, and a PC laptop computer with printer. A small 
inverter provides minimal 120 volts AC (alternating current) power for 
telephones and other support gear.
The total investment, including wiring and DC equipment (lights, fans, and an 
AC voltage adaptor), is $1,500. Installation is extra, but with the kits available, 
a do-it-yourselfer can tackle the job. And because the solar equipment is used 
for a business, it’s depreciated, which reduces taxes.
The system saves around $30 per month in utility-provided electricity, so the 
payback is 50 months. When all taxes are taken into account, the payback 
can be as low as 30 months.

609
 Chapter 2: Preparing for a Switch to Solar
Book VII

Power
Investing in a full-scale PV system
Suppose that some homeowners have good roof exposure for solar equipment, 
and they want to install a full-scale, intertie (connected to the grid so that extra 
generated power is credited to your power bill) PV system in a three-bedroom, 
two-bath house. Their monthly average electric bill is $240, and energy 
consumption is 1,600 kWh’s per month. The home is all electric.
After an audit, they employ conservation measures to decrease the bill 15 
percent to 1,360 kWh’s per month, or $204. (Chapter 1 of Book II discusses 
energy audits.) The goal is to reduce the average monthly electric bill to zero.
A TOU rate structure will apply when the system is in place. The owners 
believe they can use 90 percent of their electricity in off-peak hours, so they’ll 
be selling most of their solar production back at the top rate and using it at a 
much lower rate. In California, utilities are required by law to pay you for your 
excess generated power the same rate they charge you. In some states, the 
utilities pay you only a percentage of the rate they charge. Look for this scenario 
to change in the future, because it’s a way to encourage solar investment.
A 5 kWh system that’ll do the job costs $40,000. The state will give a rebate 
of $10,000 directly to the PV system contractor so it’s not even billed to the 
homeowners. The total out-of-pocket cost is $30,000. On top of that, the feds 
will give a $2,000 tax credit for the system, which now costs only $28,000.
The warranty is 20 years on the panels, less for some of the other equipment. 
Reliability is good on the brand chosen, which isn’t the cheapest. In theory, 
maintenance and repair costs should be very low.
The owners finance this with an equity loan at $140 per month, tax deductible. 
They’re immediately saving the difference between the power bill they’ve erased 
($204) and the cost for the loan — in this case, $84 per month after taxes. From 
day one, this deal is in the black.
Using 7 percent as the energy inflation rate, the payback is 11 years, but this 
doesn’t account for the fact that the value of the equipment is also rising 
because demand is rising. With this factor included in the equation, the 
payback goes down to 7 years.
The potential savings in carbon footprint are 13,000 pounds per year. Not bad!
What will happen to the value of your equipment if rebates and subsidies dry 
up? Homebuyers will have to pay a lot more if they choose to install their 
own equipment. The seller providing that equipment with the house has 
become much more attractive.

610
Book VII: Solar Power 
Installing both a water heater and PV
Household Y uses 12 kWhs of electricity per month. A solar water heater 
supplement costs $4,000 and will save 18 percent of the power consumption. 
A full-scale PV system will offset the entire electric bill for a cost of $30,000. If 
both systems are installed, the capacity of the PV system can be 18 percent 
less, for 18 percent less cost.
Here’s what installing both a water heater and a PV system will cost:
$4,000 + 82% of $30,000 = $28,600
Going with the PV option costs only $30,000. That’s a savings of $1,400.
But is it worth it? Maybe not. Water heaters need maintenance. Some water 
heaters are very reliable and work for decades, but PV systems are relatively 
trouble-free. You also have two investment projects to contend with instead 
of one. With these numbers, you might want to install only the PV system. 
Your calculations may indicate a bigger divergence, in which case your 
decision may be different. This decision may also depend on financing. For 
example, you may be able to finance a big PV system, but not both, so your 
decision may be to install only PV for this reason.
When does it make good sense to install a solar water heater? A $4,000 
investment is reachable in cash for most homeowners. You get a good payback, 
especially if you’re in a tiered rate structure. You can always add PV later, after 
you’ve determined how much cost savings you’ve achieved with the water 
heater, or when your finances allow for a larger investment.
Or perhaps you can get a solar tax credit of 30 percent of the cost of your 
system, at a maximum of $2,000. This credit means you get a $1,2000 tax 
credit for a $4,000 solar water heater, as well as a $30,000 PV system. The 
percentages are a lot better for the water heater, making its payback much 
better.
 
If tax credits or rebates are limited in any given calendar year, you’re better 
off installing hot water and PV in different years.

Installing Sunscreens for Summer
Installing sunscreens is the cheapest way to prepare a window for the 
summer season, and it’s also one of the best. Sunscreens reflect a lot of 
sunlight and create an insulation barrier on the outside.
Most sunscreens are dark, heavy-duty fabric screens with a shiny surface. 
Some are a flexible, tinted plastic film. They can reflect up to 90 percent of all 
sunlight.
 
Only windows that get more than a few hours of direct sunlight a day benefit 
from sunscreen installation. The best candidates are tall windows facing 
south, but east and west can also get very hot. Of course, part of the effect is 
the psychological comfort of shading, and you may want that anywhere.
You don’t want sunscreens in the winter, so they’re only temporary, which 
means you need to mount them in removable frames or tack them up. You 
can also roll them up like a blind or buy a finished blind that has solar 
screen. Or get automatic, electric controllers so that with the push of a single 
button, you can command every solar screen in your house.

612
Book VII: Solar Power 
 
Call a screen shop directly for tools, materials, and advice on how to install 
sunscreen. Sunscreens come up to 8 feet wide, in huge rolls, so that you can 
get as much length as you want. You can do the installation with nothing 
more than tacks, a hammer, and a box cutter, but a good stapler ensures a 
quality, consistent job and is much easier.
Getting framed
You can buy frames for sunscreens in a range of colors, and they come either 
loaded with screen or empty. Most are aluminum. Easy-to-use mounting 
hardware is an essential. Buy that when you get the frames because it’s one 
and the same problem; the frames are useless without mounting hardware.
Houses with wooden window frames work the best because they accept nearly 
every mounting scheme. If your house is stucco or you don’t have wood 
around your windows, you’re limited to prefabricated frames with appropriate 
mounting hardware. The job is more expensive but still potentially worthwhile. 
Calculating the cost savings is difficult, so use your budgetary constraints to 
decide whether it’s worthwhile.
 
To find out what the effect will be, get some cheap screen and tape it up to 
see how it changes your room; you may not like the effect, which will govern 
how much you’re willing to spend.
If the frame is wood, the fastest and cheapest way to cover a window is to 
tack the screen right onto the window frame by using a hammer and tacks. 
Cut the piece of sunscreen down to a few inches bigger than what you need, 
tack it up, and then trim it with a scissors or a box cutter.
If you want a better look, consider cutting some planks of wood to frame 
the window, painting them, tacking them up over the screen (the screen is 
already tacked up over the window — the frames are only for appearance, 
not functionality), and trimming the excess screen to match.
Get the wood from a lumber store — you can probably find a store that cuts 
the wood for you, and the pieces will be exact and square. (Cabinet shops are 
usually willing to do a small cutting job if you can’t find a lumber store that 
does it.)
Using screws for installation is best because taking the screens down and 
then putting them back up next year is easier. You need a drill to predrill 
holes for the screws and a screwdriver. The lumber store staff can show you 
the best screws and drill bits to use.

Creating a manual screen retractor
Figure 3-1 shows a way to make a manually operated screen retractor that 
works reliably, is easy to use, and costs very little.
You need a wooden mount that’s slightly wider than your window; three 
eyelets; a sunscreen; tacks; a dowel rod as long as the mount; and screws or 
nails (to install).
Here’s how to create a manual screen retractor:
 
1. Drill three holes in the mount and attach the eyelets.
 
 The first two holes are 6 inches from each end of the mount; the remaining 
hole should be 1 inch from the end. Screw in the eyelets, making sure that 
all three holes are lined up, facing the ends of the mount.
 
2. Using a box cutter, cut the sunscreen to size.
 
 You want to make the sunscreen larger than the window by about 4 
inches, although if you don’t have the room, any size will work, even if 
it’s smaller than the window. A size smaller than the window will just be 
unsightly from inside, looking outside.
 
3. Tack the sunscreen onto the roll-up rod (dowel) and the mount.
 
4. Put the cords in place.
 
 Tie a cord to an eyelet that’s 6 inches from the end, loop the cord over 
the top of the mount and under the rod, and go back up through the 
eyelet. Repeat on the other side. Then thread both cords through the 
end eyelet, the one that’s 1 inch from the end of the mount.
 
5. Screw or nail the mount onto the window frame.
 
 To retract the screen, simply pull the cords.
If you like, paint the wood to match your house. You can use pulleys instead 
of eyelets and get smoother performance. If wind is an issue, get some fishing 
weights (the kind with holes so that you can get a nail through) and nail them 
into the ends of the roller dowel, equal weight on each side.

Securing Your Home
You can make some easy, solar-powered security systems for very little cost. 
You can also have a lot of fun at somebody else’s expense.
By using strategic combinations of motion-activated sprinkler heads and 
security lights, you can keep just about anything or anybody away from your 
house. The great news is that both of these products come solar-powered, so 
they work even in a power outage. These security devices are far from foolproof, 
but they deter 99 percent of potential offenders. The trick is placement. Plan 
for maximum surprise and dramatic result.
Hosing down your problems
The idea is simple: Aim a stream of water into a region being sensed by a 
motion detector — upon detection, the water triggers on. The entire thing is 
powered by a solar panel, so you can set it up anywhere you have a hose.
Here are some intriguing applications:
 
 Security: A burglar stalking a house who suddenly is hosed is likely to 
leave.
 
 Pest deterrence: Neighbor’s dog like your yard late at night? Deer eating 
your landscape? Daughter’s boyfriend pushing it? Not if they have to 
take an unplanned shower.
 
 Practical jokes: You can get some laughs out of this one, but you better 
make sure that the intended victim has a sense of humor and is dressed 
appropriately. Set up your video camera first.
Blasting the bad guys with light
The device is called a security light, but you can find other applications. A PV 
module connects via a length of wire to a battery, a spotlight, and a motion 
detector. The module needs to be mounted in direct sunlight — the more the 
better — but you can mount the light itself anywhere. Wire lengths of 15 feet 
are common, but you can go a lot longer if you need to. The typical price is 
around $80.
On the other hand, if you pay an electrician to install an electric junction 
box, you’re looking at over $400, easy. And that location may not really be 
the best location after all. With solar, you can position anywhere, easily and 
quickly. And you can hang one of these inside your house just as well as out. 
The trick is to get the PV panel in the sun — that’s all that matters.

616
Book VII: Solar Power 
Engaging in Small Power Projects
You can run just about anything off of PV panels. The biggest questions are
 
 Whether you need a battery: A battery is required whenever you’ll be 
using a device when the sun is not shining, such as night.
 
 Whether you need an inverter: PV panels put out DC voltages only; if 
you need AC voltages, such as the kind that appliances take, you need 
an inverter.
Battery power: Charging up your life
PV modules are ideal for charging batteries. The electronics are minimal, and 
the costs are low because of it.
Leaving dead car batteries behind
Got an old truck, car, or RV that sits around and doesn’t get started very 
often? How about a boat? If they’ve been giving you problems starting, a 
solar charger may be a very cheap and effective solution. When a vehicle sits 
around without being started up for a while, its battery grows weak. If the 
battery is old, it’s even worse.
For $40, you can get a solar battery charger. A PV module plugs in to the car’s 
power outlet, and you lay the module out on the dashboard in the sun. While 
you’re gone, it trickle charges your battery. A solar charger won’t overcharge 
your battery, so you don’t have to worry about removing it, even when the 
vehicle is running. It probably won’t revive a dead battery, although it won’t 
hurt anything to try.
Auto batteries cost around $80. With the $40 solar charger, you get more 
lifetime, up to 50 percent more, so you get a reasonable payback. But how 
much is it worth (in peace of mind, not to mention the costs of a tow-truck 
visit) not to get stranded when you can’t get your car started?
Charging your electronics batteries with the sun
Standard, off-the-shelf batteries cost around $0.75 apiece. The cost for 100 
throw-away alkaline batteries is $75, plus trips to the store to buy them. And 
batteries have nasty chemicals, such as lead and acids. You run across an 
environmental issue with 100 batteries.
Rechargeable batteries cost $4 apiece, and the good ones issue the same 
charge as a throw-away. A solar charger costs $40, but the charge cycles are 
free. You can charge a good rechargeable battery over 500 times. (Note that 

617
 Chapter 3: Jumping In to Small Projects with Big Results
Book VII
Solar 
Power
the number 500 applies to devices like remote controllers, which don’t take 
much current; if you’re drawing a lot of current and running the batteries 
down to their minimum, expect more on the order of 200 times.)
The cost for a rechargeable battery and 100 charges is $44, which is already a 
better deal than alkaline. But here’s the best part: The cost to charge the next 
100 times is zero. And the next, and the next. After 500 free charges, you may 
need a new battery, but that’s only $4.
Alkalines cost about 20 times as much as quality rechargeables to operate. 
(Cheap rechargeables have much worse payback, so avoid them.) Spend 
some extra money on quality batteries, and it’s a good investment.
The time to charge batteries (most devices charge four at a time) depends on 
how much direct sunlight you receive. Setting up near a window is often good 
enough if you don’t need a lot of batteries. If you use a lot, you need direct 
sunlight. Kitchen bay windows are convenient candidates.
 
Keep a reserve of charged batteries. Buy twice as many as you need — it 
doesn’t cost more because you go twice as long before you need to buy new 
batteries.
Small-scale PV systems: Using just a 
modest amount of power
For $1,000, you can get a solar power system big enough to run anything in 
your house aside from the major appliances. You can power a home office, 
where you may be able to write off some costs as a business expense. Or use 
a solar power system in a remote cabin or a boat cabin or an RV.
About $1,000 can get you 500 watt hours, or 1/2 kWh, or a 60-watt light bulb 
for 8 hours — plenty of power to run an office or all the equipment other 
than power tools at a construction site. At this size (on the order of a small 
end table), you won’t be toting your solar system around in a case, although 
you can find units on sturdy wheels.
Working with RV appliances
Small appliances for RVs, boats, and camping are widely available, and any of 
these appliances work with 12VDC solar power systems.
You may even be able to run some appliances without batteries, which 
makes things a lot cheaper and easier. Heaters don’t care how the power 
looks (it can fluctuate, the voltages and currents can change, there can be 

618
Book VII: Solar Power 
ripples galore); how much heat you can generate is all that matters. Fans may 
blow directly from a PV module; the more sun, the harder the fan pushes. 
Water pumps don’t need batteries, and some portable coolers are made to 
connect directly to solar panels.
You can also get a power system with a 120VAC outlet so that you can use 
your existing household electrical devices. You give up efficiency, but it may 
be worth it. If you have a 12VDC system, you can buy a really cheap 120VAC 
inverter from an auto-supply store. The AC power is dirty, but it works for 
certain things just fine. It’s difficult to specify a list for what will work and 
what won’t without giving it a try. Radios may be noisy, as well as TVs, but 
some have good internal power regulators. Anything with an internal battery 
won’t mind the noisy AC power.
Going Off-Grid on a Piece-by-Piece Basis
You can go off-grid with small functions — you don’t need to go off-grid with 
your entire home. You’ll save on your power bill, plus enjoy some interesting 
independence and help save the environment — all in one.
Making your reading lamp go off-grid
If you like to read, you can spend $50 to get a small, battery-charged light (LED) 
that works for four hours on a four-hour charge. A PV module with a length 
of wire attaches to a battery/light/switch housing with Velcro backing. Apply 
the matching Velcro anywhere you may want light. During the day, plug in the 
PV module and set that in the direct sunlight. At night, press the light into the 
Velcro and use it.
Solar lamps put out a lot of light, but it’s focused on a spot. The trick is to get 
that spot on your book, and you find you have plenty of light. For reading, 
you want a lamp with an arm that extends out, over your book.
 
Stick Velcro onto the bottom of a conventional lamp head employing a 
gooseneck adjustment arm and press the solar light into that. You’ll be able 
to position it directly over your book, about a foot and a half away.
If you’re using the solar lamp only in one location, run a cord over to a 
window and tape the solar module flat onto the inside, facing out. You’ll 
probably get enough sunlight to meet your needs. If not, look for more direct 
sunlight. If the lamp isn’t bright enough, use two. You can also buy more 
expensive designs with better lights, color, focusing, and battery.

Installing solar light tubes 
(tubular skylights)
A solar tube lighting system collects sunlight on the roof and transmits it 
down a shiny, silver pipe into the diffuser, which broadcasts the light into the 
room below. You can make most rooms bright enough to work in, and they 
stay a lot cooler.
Solar light varies with the clouds and weather, changing the intensity of light 
in the room quite a bit. You’re much more conscious of the outdoors. When 
the sky is partly cloudy, you can get a lot of fluctuation. Personally, this is my 
favorite aspect of solar tubes.
The light creates a certain cool mood due to the silver color. Some light 
tubes come with filters for creating moods, but they cut out light as well. You 
can change the nature of a room very dramatically with a filter.
Costs and payback
The typical price (uninstalled) is $230 for a 4-foot pipe length. After that, you 
need to buy extensions for $20 a foot.
Large-diameter units can output as much light as a dozen 100-watt light bulbs 
at one-tenth the heat. If a $250 solar tube displaces only three 100-watt light 
bulbs for eight hours a day, it pays for itself in 19 months. If you factor in the 
cooling effect, payback is even faster.
Location
 
The best locations are dark corners in family rooms. That way, the light gets 
used the most and has the most dramatic affect. They’re also good for dark, 
isolated bathrooms. The natural light is comforting, and you never have 
to flip a light switch during the day. Beware, though. They can drastically 
change the way decor looks, maybe making the existing facades obsolete. Be 
prepared for a much different bathroom.
If you have a dark kitchen, a solar tube may be the perfect solution, especially 
if a lot of people come and go during the day. The cool tone of the light goes 
especially well in a stainless steel kitchen.
Installation
You need a jigsaw, a sheetrock saw, screwdrivers, and basic tools. You also 
need the requisite nerve to saw a hole through your roof; if you don’t know what 
you’re doing, you can hire experts to install solar tubes. Chin up, however — 
solar tubes come with very good installation instructions and the appropriate 
sealing materials. The manufacturers rely on the do-it-yourselfers, so they bend 
over backwards telling you how to do it (as well as how not do it, which is just as 
important).

620
Book VII: Solar Power 
 
Here are some tips for handling some of the installation challenges:
 
 Don’t try to buy separate parts; get a complete kit, with however many 
extension tubes you think you need. You may want to get an extra and 
leave it in the box for return. Otherwise, when you find that you don’t 
have enough extension tube, you’ll probably have holes cut in ceilings 
and roofs, and you won’t want to stop everything and go to a store.
 
 The hardest part of the job is probably in the attic space, so plan your 
route up and then over to where the work is going to be done and then 
how you’ll sit and stand when you get over there. Also, realize that you’ll 
be toting tools with you; the best bet is a tool belt, but if you don’t have 
one, use a sturdy bag.
 
 You may want to look at the installation instructions before you buy a 
unit for a list of tools you’ll need. If you’re going to have to buy one or 
rent one, add that to the cost of the project.
 
 Cutting through a typical roof takes more than a toy saw, so use a good 
jigsaw. Composite shingles eat jigsaw blades, so get extra.
 
 Take extra precautions to seal against the weather. (Use a good sili-
con sealant, although most kits will come with appropriate sealant.) If 
the elements can possibly get in, they will — maybe not this year, but 
Mother Nature has infinite patience.
 
 You can botch a few things on this job and nobody will ever notice, but 
you need to get the hole in your ceiling right. Measure twice; cut once.
 
 The key to a successful project is to locate the hole properly in your 
ceiling before you start cutting. Installation instructions are very explicit 
for this step, so follow them closely.
 
 You’re going to want to make sure that you have enough extension tube. 
(Most solar tubes come with 4 feet of extension tube, with 2-foot exten-
sions as options.) Get more than you think you need, save the receipt, 
and take back the extra. The last thing you want is to get halfway 
through the job, with holes in your ceiling and roof and discover you 
don’t have enough extension tube.
Using tabletop solar fans
Simply take a small 12VDC room fan and a suitable PV panel and wire them 
directly together. The hotter the sun, the more the air moves — no need for 
batteries. At $150, a solar fan isn’t a cheap option, but it may be reasonable 
if your energy costs are high enough. Plus, you can use one anywhere; you 
don’t need a plug.

621
 Chapter 3: Jumping In to Small Projects with Big Results
Book VII
Solar 
Power
These fans work nicely on porches, where you can position the panel right 
outside to catch the most sunlight. They’re great for RV or even tent camping 
when the weather’s hot enough. Solar fans are perfect for a pleasure boat in 
the hot sun. Pool houses, as well as remote casitas (small guest houses), 
likewise benefit.
Purifying Your Drinking Water
Not only can you build a solar water-purification system, such as the one in 
Figure 3-2, but you can also design it. Designing is just as much fun as build-
ing, and it’s more rewarding because the system’s entirely yours (unless it 
doesn’t work, of course — then you need to figure out how to blame some-
body else).
The system uses distillation, a process that can remove salts, microorgan-
isms, and even chemicals such as arsenic, leaving you with pure H2O. Here’s 
how it works: If you leave salty or contaminated water in an open container, 
the water evaporates and leave the contaminants behind. If you heat the 
water, the process speeds up considerably.
After the water evaporates, the water vapor condenses on the glass window 
and drips down into the catch trough. Tilt the catch trough just slightly and 
put a bottle or other container underneath the low end, and you have puri-
fied water.
You can make a purification system as cheaply or as expensively as you 
want. People in Third World countries use large, efficient versions of this 
same exact device that are capable of purifying hundreds of gallons a day. 
A system the size of a microwave oven can yield up to 3 gallons of purified 
water on a sunny day.
Here’s what you need for a basic solar still:
 
 A wooden (or even better, sheet metal) enclosure, as shown in Figure 3-2; 
if you want to get imaginative, find a good metal box and cut a hole for 
the glaze cover
 
 Reflective material such as aluminum foil (shiny side out)
 
 Black paint (the kind used for barbeque pits works best)
 
 Glass (you don’t need glazed glass; just use plain old window glass if you 
like — you can get pieces of discarded glass from window shops for little 
more than a smile)
 
 Insulation (the white foam stuff is cheap, effective, and easy to work with)

622
Book VII: Solar Power 
 
 Glue (silicon sealant or similar weather-resistant material)
 
 A tray that’s black or has some other quality that absorbs heat

Now take a look at the assembly:
 
1. Paint the exterior of the box black to enhance absorption.
 
2. Install the reflective surface at the back and side walls of the enclo-
sure and glue the insulation to the bottom.
 
3. Put a tray of contaminated water inside the enclosure, place the glass 
on top, and aim toward the sun.
 
 That’s it — you’re done!
The first few times you use this device, the water may taste a little odd. Let 
the system “sweat” for a few weeks, and the bad taste will go away.
When designing or improving your unit, make filling the inner tray with water 
convenient. Position it by a hose, for example. Then you don’t have to carry 
water to your system. Configure some kind of funnel through the sidewall so 
that you can pour the water right into the tray without spilling. Make the unit 
so that you can remove the glazing top and clean out the tray because the 
contaminants are going to remain behind.

Financing Your Solar Investments

 Using loans to finance your solar projects

T
he fact is, solar power is not a cut-and-dried winner in terms of invest-
ments. (Chapter 2 details payback analysis techniques that you can use 
to calculate the value of a solar investment to compare it with other types of 
investments.) The bottom line for a solar investment depends on three things 
in particular: cost of energy (which will rise); amount of sunlight available 
(which varies greatly from region to region); and cost of solar equipment
Although basic equipment costs don’t vary much between regions, one thing 
that does affect how much you pay for your system by region is government 
subsidies. This chapter details the basic ideas behind subsidies and then 
shows you how to do your own research to determine how best to obtain 
and use them. You also discover other ways to finance your solar projects.
Exploring the Different 
Types of Subsidies
Governments have recognized the value of solar energy, especially in 
achieving a more pollution-free energy consumption. Plus, solar power has 
the potential to free North America from reliance on foreign oil, which is 
desirable from a political stability standpoint. (Getting oil from the Mideast 
creates a lot of problems.) Governments also recognize the marginal nature 
of a solar investment, and they’ve resolved to do something on the cost end 
of the equation. (Some politicians may claim to be able to do something on 
the sunshine supply end, but as usual they’re just blowing hot air.)

624
Book VII: Solar Power 
Subsidies, where the government helps you pay for part of the cost of your 
solar system, are very powerful incentives to invest in solar, and a solar cus-
tomer can see up to a 50-percent cost reduction by using all the subsidies 
available. However, the subsidies scene is constantly changing, so it’s impos-
sible to specify the precise details of subsidies and rebates simply because 
they’re apt to change without notice.
The following sections describe the types of subsidies available.
Rebates
A rebate is money given back to a customer after he or she makes a purchase. 
Manufacturers’ rebates work the same as they do for other products. You buy 
a solar system or component, and the manufacturer gives you either an instant 
rebate at the checkout or one that you need to mail in with proof-of-purchase.
Government solar rebates operate basically the same way. The rebate is paid 
directly to the professional solar contractor, so the customer doesn’t need to 
finance the entire investment and then wait to get the rebate back. This is, in 
effect, a secondary rebate because it allows solar customers to more easily 
purchase their systems. But because these rebates come from government 
sources, they’re also laden with overwrought details generally incomprehen-
sible to the average layperson.
For example, here’s how rebates work in California. For a PV system, you 
can get up to 25 percent of the cost of a system in rebates, but the amount 
depends on the system’s productivity. So the state has a very specific com-
puter program that potential customers use to predict system performance. 
Inputs are the following:
 
 Your geographical area: Data banks show your area’s statistical 
weather patterns, including cloud density and frequency, average tem-
peratures, air density, and the like. Your latitude also gives an indication 
of sunlight exposure. All these numbers combined yield a measure of 
how much sunlight you can expect in a given year. Some microclimates 
(a climate that, because of terrain, landscaping, and other factors, may 
differ from a climate only a mile away) may have much less sunshine 
than a nearby area, so be prepared for some surprises here.
 
 The size and orientation of your solar collectors: The greatest solar 
exposure comes from a specific roof angle (depending on your latitude) 
and a specific azimuth angle, namely true south. For any other angles, 
you get a lower rebate. If your roof is all wrong, not only do you get a 
lower rebate, but you also get less productivity as well.

625
 Chapter 4: Financing Your Solar Investments
Book VII
Solar 
Power
 
 To maximize your rebate, you may be able to mount your solar collec-
tors on the ground and get all the angles just perfect. You can also get a 
higher rebate by employing adjustable mounts that track the sun over 
the course of a year — and result in greater productivity.
 
 Any shading issues inherent to the collector location: A special hemi-
spheric reflector device is used to measure the relative location and shad-
ing effects of trees, mountains, chimneys, other buildings, and so on. The 
device can tell whether these impediments will affect your solar exposure 
at any time of the year. A computer program translates this data into a 
single number that tells how much solar potential your collector site has.
 
 The efficiency of your system: This is also related to a system’s produc-
tivity. Manufacturers must define a system’s efficiency, but this number 
also depends on where the collectors are located. (If they’re on the 
northern side of your roof, the score goes down.) The overall system 
productivity is what’s of interest; this is the total amount of energy a 
system will produce in a given year. The government is subsidizing 
energy production, not a system. It’s a fine point of distinction, but it 
makes sense. (As a matter of interest, in California, you may choose 
to get your subsidy after the system is installed instead of using forms 
and paperwork to calculate a theoretical efficiency when the system is 
installed. In this way, the actual performance is used to gauge how big 
the subsidy will be, which often results in a larger subsidy than the nec-
essarily conservative theoretical.)
For a perfect solar location, the state rebates 25 percent of the cost of your 
solar system. (Acceptable market costs are specified so that you can’t get a 
higher rebate for a system that’s out of market pricing guidelines.) In actual-
ity, 25 percent is rare. Most numbers come in around 20 to 24 percent. When 
they come in much lower, your solar investment quickly loses allure.
You may run into a buy-down caveat: As time progresses, the rebates are 
scheduled to decrease, which encourages solar customers to buy now 
instead of later. The reason is reasonable: The basic idea with subsidies is 
that they’ll force the cost of solar to come down over time, so why invest 
now? Why not just wait until prices do come down? But if everybody were 
to have this philosophy, prices would never drop. Ideally, as the rebates 
diminish, prices will come down, so the net cost of a system won’t change 
over time. (Well, okay, but when do government programs ever work the way 
they’re supposed to?)
The effect of this rebate has been wildly popular in California, which has some 
of the highest power rates in the country, plus the prospect of seeing greater 
increases in energy rates than the rest of the country due to the robust envi-
ronmental laws that the state legislature is passing. In addition, Californians 
remember (not fondly) the energy price spikes that resulted in companies like 
Enron playing with energy prices, resulting in higher profits for the company 
at the expense of the energy consumers. There were blackouts and brownouts 
and power outages in the middle of steamy, sunny afternoons.

626
Book VII: Solar Power 
Tax credits
Tax credits, which are subtracted from the amount you owe on your state or 
federal taxes, are an increasingly common form of subsidy. You must buy a 
certain type of system to qualify, and the credit is taken on your tax return, 
either state or federal. As a result, you must carry the cost until your return 
is filed, and any refund comes back to you. This wait can take more than a 
year, depending on when you buy a system.
A tax credit is far better than a tax deduction because a tax deduction is sub-
tracted from your taxable income. So if you’re paying a marginal tax rate of 
28 percent and you get a deduction of $1,000, you save $280. But tax credits 
come out of the amount you owe, so a $1,000 tax credit saves you $1,000.
Both tax deductions and tax credits may be available for a solar system. 
Many times, both the federal and state governments are offering programs, 
and the terms will vary. You need to understand the distinction between 
credits and deductions because they make a big difference on the bottom 
line.
Here’s an example. The U.S. federal government allows a 30-percent tax credit 
for both solar PV systems and solar water heating systems, up to a maximum 
of $2,000 per year. If your solar water heater system costs $6,000 to install, 
you get $1,800 off the price. If your solar PV system costs $30,000, you get 
only $2,000 off the price. This savings encourages smaller solar investments 
because you save a greater percentage.
 
To maximize your tax credits, spread your solar investments out over time. 
Install a solar water heater this year and a PV system the next. And if pos-
sible, install two smaller systems instead of one larger.
No property tax increases
Many states have laws that prevent your property taxes from rising due to 
the increase in value of your home from a solar investment. So if you install 
a $40,000 PV system, your county can’t reassess your property and charge 
you extra taxes for having a home that’s worth $40,000 more. Very few other 
investments qualify for this exemption, and because it’s basically being paid 
for by the government, it’s a tax break.

627
 Chapter 4: Financing Your Solar Investments
Book VII
Solar 
Power
Net metering
Utilities aren’t particularly enthusiastic about offering rebates, nor do they 
really want residential customers to hook solar equipment up to the grid. 
Recognizing this issue, the 1978 federal Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act 
(PURPA) mandates local utilities to pay “avoided” or wholesale costs to enti-
ties that want to sell it. This is the basis for net metering. It makes solar PV 
investment very viable. Without net metering, solar PV would be no more 
than a rare novelty.
States often have even more stringent net metering rules. In California, the 
utilities must pay you the same rate that they charge for power. For example, 
if you’re on a TOU (time of use) rate schedule, the utility must pay you the 
same rates it’s charging its customers at different times of the day.
 
This arrangement is a very strong incentive for using solar power because 
the highest power rates always apply in the middle of the afternoon. 
Midafternoon is the highest demand period because businesses are all using 
air conditioners at the same time, but it’s also the time when solar PV sys-
tems are outputting at the maximum rate. So if you have a PV intertie system, 
you can plan your power consumption to take advantage of the non-symmet-
ric exchange of energy.
Incentives for home-operated businesses
The incentives for businesses are even greater than those for residences, so 
if you have a home business or office, you may qualify for higher tax credits 
and rebates. Why? One reason is that businesses use most of their energy in 
the middle of the afternoon, so they’re less apt to go for solar energy when 
there’s net metering (a system that lets you sell your excess power back to 
the utility company). Another is that the green spirit that motivates many 
solar investments (thereby making the investment more attractive than mere 
numbers would imply because you save pollution as well as money) doesn’t 
exist for businesses.
Businesses can also take advantage of accelerated depreciation schedules 
for solar equipment. This stuff can get complex; ask your tax preparer for the 
details.

628
Book VII: Solar Power 
Tax-deductible home equity loans
Although they may not be a direct subsidy of solar power systems, tax-
deductible home equity loans are akin to a government subsidy. If you take 
out a second mortgage to pay for your solar equipment, the government lets 
you deduct the interest on that loan from your taxes. So if you’re making a 
monthly payment of, say, $300 for a second mortgage, your net cost may be 
only $200. The tax-deductible home equity loan works exactly like a subsidy, 
but it’s called something else.
Researching All the Subsidy Options
 
Things are changing so fast that it’s impossible to keep up with all the 
government programs. This chapter can only nudge you in the right 
direction. Your job is to poke around and get all the details for yourself.
Here’s how to research the subject further:
 
 Talk to your tax preparer. Tax preparers should be versed in the details 
of solar tax credits, but if not, they can still access the information sources 
they need to process your rebates and tax credits. Solar is relatively new, 
so give preparers a break if they don’t know the details upfront, but keep at 
them to find out if they don’t. Expect to pay more for your tax preparation 
because your tax preparer will have to complete more forms. (These forms 
are practically indecipherable to the average layperson, so if you’re 
thinking about preparing your own, be forewarned.)
 
 Ask contractors. Solar contractors need to know about subsidies because 
they help sell systems. PV contractors are experts at tax credits and 
rebates, and they’ll usually help you process them as well. Even if you’re 
going to do the installation yourself, you can get good information from 
contractors when you ask them for competitive quotations.
 
 Contact utility companies. Utilities will give you information, although 
they don’t necessarily want to. But they have to — it’s required by 
law — so if you push a little, you can get all kinds of information, and 
it’s almost always free. You can find a customer service number on 
your utility bill. When you call, ask whether a particular department is 
dedicated to subsidies.
 
 Search online. Of course, the Internet is a great source of information. Use 
a search engine to look up key words like “solar energy tax incentives,” 
“solar power rebates,” and so on. One thing will lead to another, and who 
knows where you’ll end up?

629
 Chapter 4: Financing Your Solar Investments
Book VII

Power
 
When doing research, keep in mind that you can find subsidies for all kinds of 
other systems besides solar. For example, if you install an energy-efficient 
front door, you may qualify for a 10-percent tax credit. Gas fireplaces may get 
you a credit. Be expansive in your search, and you can find all kinds of little 
goodies.
Financing through Loans
The government is interested in promoting solar power, so it has a wide 
range of loan subsidies available. In essence, the government accepts part of 
the risk of a loan, so a bank can offer you a lower interest rate. It’s worth your 
while to spend some time looking into the various government programs 
because you can often get a loan for better terms.
Borrowing money the old-fashioned way
When people need large amounts of money, they either look to a bank or 
whip out their credit cards. To finance your big solar projects, you can 
pursue several types of loans:
 
 Home equity loans are the most common loans and the best options. If 
you’re contemplating a large solar project, you probably own your own 
home. (Why would anybody install a big solar system on a home she’s 
renting?)
 
 Home equity is the difference between what a homeowner owes in mort-
gages on the home and the home’s market value (or appraised value, 
which should be the same but rarely is). You can use your equity to get 
a loan at a much lower interest rate because the bank’s risk is greatly 
reduced by using real estate as collateral (the goods the bank will take 
if you don’t pay on your loan). The bank won’t need to come after the 
equipment you’ve financed because the bank can go after the house 
itself. (Banks generally don’t care what you do with the money, so they 
may not even know about your solar equipment.) Homeowners plan 
to pay off their debt long before they let a bank take their home away. 
Home equity loans are generally tax deductible. (Consult your tax pre-
parer for details.)
 
 Supplier loans are available from manufacturers and suppliers who pro-
vide solar equipment. However, solar vendors generally sign up with an 
equity loan broker and simply act as the sales outlet for somebody else’s 
loans. You can probably find a better interest rate if you go directly to 
a bank, but the convenience may offset the cost. Or solar vendors may 
actually offer better terms because they have a strong incentive to close 
a sale, and making inexpensive financing available helps considerably.

630
Book VII: Solar Power 
 
 These companies use the equipment itself as collateral for the loan. 
Supplier loans are similar to automobile loans that dealerships offer 
when you buy a vehicle. The car is collateral, and if you don’t pay the 
loan, a repo man (or woman) comes to your house late at night and 
takes back the car — perfectly legal. If you default on a supplier loan for 
your solar equipment, the company may send someone in the middle of 
the night to grab the collectors off your roof — you probably won’t mis-
take him for Santa Claus!
 
 Consumer loans don’t require any collateral, so the lender’s risk is high. 
You can get a credit card with a $30,000 credit limit far more easily than 
should ever be possible. The reason it’s so easy? The interest rate is sky 
high; the bank expects a number of defaults and lets the customers who 
don’t default cover the losses from the ones who do. Plus, you don’t get 
any sort of tax deduction on the interest.
 
 Consumer loans are the modern version of loan shark products, 
although the creditors no longer break your fingers when you default. If 
you’re a good credit risk, avoid consumer loans like the plague.
Exploring home energy ratings
A less traditional option of financing your major solar project is through 
an energy-efficient financing program, but your home has to qualify for the 
program. To qualify, you need to have your home audited and rated by a 
licensed expert. He will do an energy audit (see Chapter 2 of Book II) and 
write a report that estimates annual energy use and costs. You can also 
expect some recommendations for improvements that you’ll have to imple-
ment as a loan-approval condition. To get the best loan terms, you have to 
convince the financing institution that the improvements you plan to fund 
with the loan proceeds make sense in the grand scheme of things. That’s 
reasonable.
 
If things look good, you can get special energy-efficient financing programs 
that have lower interest rates than conventional loans. Keep in mind, how-
ever, that with these loans, you’ll be required to pay for the energy audit and 
deal with government agencies.

Pursuing energy-efficient mortgages
Energy-efficient mortgages (EEMs) give you credit for the energy efficiency of 
the home you’re buying, and you also can use it to refinance so that you can 
improve your home’s energy efficiency. The first step toward getting this 
type of mortgage for an existing home is to have a home energy rater evalu-
ate the home. You get credit for the savings the home will provide through 
its efficiencies. If you’re planning to upgrade, you use the rating to show how 
your planned improvements will affect your home’s energy usage.
An EEM takes into account the money that an energy-efficient home saves a 
homeowner and therefore enables you to get a bigger loan than you other-
wise could. You also can use it to refinance and get money that you can put 
toward energy-efficiency improvements in the home you already own. You 
apply for an EEM just as you would a conventional mortgage (and most of the 
same companies and government agencies are involved).
Thinking about other mortgage options
Here are some other potentially useful government agencies when you’re 
looking for a mortgage:
 
 Federal Housing Administration at www.fha.com
 
 Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at www.hud.gov
 
 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at www.homeloans.va.gov
State agencies often provide subsidized loans as well. Check out the prospects 
at www.naseo.org, the Web site for the National Association of State Energy 
Officials.
Considering Alternative Financing
You also may want to look at some other financing programs. In the following 
sections, you find out more about a couple of your options: leasing equip-
ment or buying remote parcels of land so that you can generate power and 
sell it back to the power company.

632
Book VII: Solar Power 
Leasing solar equipment
In one new idea that’s taking hold, companies install solar equipment on 
your roof, but they retain ownership of the equipment. You lease the equip-
ment from them for a fixed monthly cost or a percentage of the system’s 
production, which works nicely if you save more on your power bill than the 
monthly cost of the lease. Or alternatively, you can use these programs to 
lock in the cost of your energy so that when it rises, you won’t be bitten like 
everyone else. You don’t have to have any cash upfront, and leasing is often 
a very popular way to finance a big purchase, as evidenced by how many 
vehicles are leased on the same basic principle.
 
Ultimately, it’s almost always a better investment to finance the equipment 
yourself and purchase it rather than lease it. But many people simply don’t 
have the cash, they want to put their money into something else, or they 
don’t want to sign up for a loan that appears on their credit report.
 
Be aware that, just as with cars, solar equipment has a residual value (the 
defined value that is estimated at the beginning of the lease; this amount may 
or may not be the actual market value) at the end of the lease. If your solar 
equipment has decreased in value for some reason (not super-likely, but it 
can happen), you may have to pay a big chunk of change to get out of the 
lease.
Buying an energy-producing plot of land
Another concept that’s likely to grow in the coming years is an ownership 
concept in which you don’t actually install your solar equipment at your resi-
dence. Instead, a company buys land in Nevada or somewhere really sunny. 
The company divides the parcel up into small plots, each around 40 feet x 
40 feet. Using cash or some other kind of financing package, you buy the plot 
of land and a solar PV system that’s installed on your plot and connected to 
the grid. The energy production belongs to you, and the equipment belongs 
to you. In practical terms, using offsite solar equipment is really no different 
than if the equipment were at your house, except nobody can see it, and you 
don’t have to maintain it. Plus, the equipment is probably in a sunnier loca-
tion without any shade hindrances.
Whether this concept works or not in your area depends on whether a utility 
company will allow it. Most won’t pay you for excess power averaged over 
the course of a year. When you install an intertie system at your house, if you 
generate more power than you use, you’ve wasted that power because you 
won’t get anything for it. Obviously, with this remote location setup, there’s no 
power use, only generation, so the entire thing earns credit. The good news is 
that the idea makes so much sense that governments are beginning to require 
utilities to accept the program, whether they want to or not. (Okay, they don’t 
want to; why would any business agree to reduce its market?)

633
 Chapter 4: Financing Your Solar Investments

Remote ownership plans have plenty of advantages for the average home-
owner. You can buy your solar equipment for much less. The company 
doesn’t have to come to your residence to install the panels. All the systems 
are basically the same construction but in different sizes. Maintenance is 
straightforward and cheap, and the land is cheap. The productivity is high, 
and because the electric circuits are conjoined centrally, efficiency is much 
better. It’s estimated that if 100 square miles of Nevada desert (of which 
there’s no shortage) were covered with solar PV panels, the nation’s electri-
cal needs would be met with almost zero carbon emission.
Considering the Best Overall Investments
You want the most return for your investment. Or maybe you’re looking for 
the quickest payback for the least amount of effort and cost. These projects 
are the winners in this category. And in a stroke of good luck (unless you’re 
not the hands-on type), many of them also show up Chapter 3 of this book.
 
Perform an energy audit and perform all the energy conservation measures 
that your audit suggests. Energy conservation saves money, reduces pollution, 
and helps make going solar much more practical. See Chapter 1 of Book II.
Nurturing Mother Nature 
with landscaping
Okay, landscaping isn’t strictly solar if what you’re looking for is technology 
that grabs sunlight and puts it to work in a constructive way. But you don’t 
always need to grab photons and train them to get the most benefit out of the 
sun. Landscaping is the hands-down winner of the best solar project because 
you get so much in return.
Planting hearty, healthy, happy deciduous trees in the right location around 
your house gives you cooler summers and warmer winters, but most of all, 
you can look out your windows and be reminded of why we care so much 
about our planet earth.
Planting bushes, shrubs, and trees as windbreaks allows you to enjoy natural 
breezes in your home, without the sound of whirring fan blades to remind 
you of technology.
Plants create oxygen out of carbon dioxide, the modern bugaboo of 
environmentalism. If the world had enough trees, global warming wouldn’t be 
such an imposing issue.

634
Book VII: Solar Power 
And finally, you get yourself outdoors, and you get exercise when you do your 
own landscaping. There’s a certain simplicity to digging a hole. It’s about as 
close to nature as you can possibly get, and that in itself is justification.
Installing PV systems to offset 
the most carbon pollution
Photovoltaic (PV) is the grand dame of solar investments and is going to 
experience hyper growth over the coming years. In Chapter 1 of Book I, you 
find out how to calculate your carbon footprint, and the results generally 
shock people. You can get a feel for just how much humans affect the 
environment when you realize that, on average, economically active 
Americans are responsible for nearly 40,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per 
capita.
When you install a large PV solar system, you cut out a tremendous amount 
of pollution because our electrical power grids are extremely inefficient. For 
each kWh of energy you create with a PV system, you save five or six times 
that much utility-generated power, most of which comes from coal-fired 
plants in North America. PV systems allow for tremendous environmental 
leverage, and that will never change.
Strictly from a monetary standpoint, PV systems are becoming more 
competitive, and as energy rates rise, they will become good investments. 
In addition, when you install a PV system, you lock in your energy rates 
for a long time, namely at zero. If you think energy rates are going to rise 
precipitously, PV is almost always a great investment. And really — what else 
is going to force America off its oil addiction than high energy rates?
Harnessing the sun to heat your water
Solar water heaters, when properly designed and installed, are great invest-
ments because they’re much cheaper than PV systems, which are often out 
of the average person’s financial range. Most homeowners can afford a few 
thousand dollars for a solar water heater system without taking out loans.
From a pollution standpoint, heating water typically makes up around 18 
percent of your power bill, so you can save exactly that much from your 
carbon footprint.
As far as utility costs, if you’re on a tiered rate structure, a solar water heater 
cuts into the most expensive part of your power bill first. For example, if you 
save 18 percent of the electrical energy you use, you may be able to save 
about 30 percent of your total power bill.

Lighting your yard all night long
For little cost, you can put a range of fun and interesting lights around your 
yard. They charge during the daylight hours and come on at night. They need 
little sunlight, given the amount of light they put out.
The alternatives are awkward, clumsy, and demanding. Low-voltage systems 
have thick-gauge wires that you need to run around your yard, tripping 
people and getting chewed up by the dog. And the lengths of runs you can 
get away with are limited because the wire is so expensive.
Putting in solar lighting is as simple as one, two, three. And if you don’t like 
the way things look, changing the layout is as simple as four, five, six. Try the 
static lights and the changing-color decorative lights. You can get a whole 
range of different mounting schemes, so you can place the lights anywhere.
The lights don’t even need to be in direct sunlight. Put them under a tree, and 
they work. You also can get ones that have the PV panels connected to the 
light by a wire, so you can put the PV panel in direct sunlight and the light 
under your porch roof.
Redecorating for functionality 
and appearance
Window blinds make a big difference in the overall look and comfort level of 
your home. Windows attract a lot of attention (they break up walls, which are 
monotonous), and they’re a source of natural sunlight. The eye is naturally 
drawn to a window, particularly a big one in your family room or living room.
However (and this is a pretty big however), windows are a major source of 
heat transfer. In the summer, windows let in too much heat energy by both 
radiative sunlight and conductive movement. In the winter, windows allow a 
lot of heat to escape by conduction. Your house would be much more energy 
efficient if it didn’t have any windows at all, but this setup is absurd. The 
solution? Put in window blinds that have good insulation and reflective 
properties.
With the right blinds, you can significantly reduce heat transfer as well as 
reflect most incident sunlight. The functional effect is dramatic. The aesthetic 
is even more so, if you choose the right ones. Large windows in family rooms 
and living rooms are the best candidates for installing blinds. You get the 
most bang for the buck when you cover these large areas of glass.

636
Book VII: Solar Power 
Putting up overhangs to make 
your home more comfortable
By using overhangs to shade your southern windows appropriately, you 
can increase natural warming in the winter and prevent overheating in the 
summer. You also can improve the natural light in your home by increasing 
the amount of sunshine you let in during the winter, when you want as much 
light as possible (it makes you feel warmer, and perception is half the game), 
and by decreasing it in the summer, when a lot of light makes you feel hot.
Controlling the sun as it shines into your house lets you regulate the 
temperature variations. Nobody likes a home where the temperature swings 
wildly over the course of a day. And temperature variations tend to make 
materials swell and shrink, which causes cracking and premature wear. When 
you install a well-designed overhang over a porch or sunroom, you minimize 
temperature variations.
Overhangs are very reasonable do-it-yourself projects. You don’t need electrical 
experience or plumbing know-how. There are usually no extraordinary weight 
requirements that entail consulting a professional engineer. And if you keep 
things modest, you don’t need to get a county building permit or permission 
from an association design committee.
Increasing your living space
You can add a solar room onto your home for far less cost than a conventional 
room. You can put in nearly any size you want, and do-it-yourself kits are 
straightforward and well designed. You can build a solar room out of aluminum 
or wood, and you can put in however many and whatever size windows you 
want. You can incorporate a concrete floor (for maximum thermal mass), or 
you can use an existing wooden or synthetic deck.
If you do it right, you can build a solar room without getting a building 
permit. (Forego electric power and don’t connect it permanently to your 
house.) You can build a solar room out of plastic corrugated materials that 
cost very little. You can grow plants in a greenhouse year-round, or if you 
want to get really exotic, you can grow fruits, flowers, or vegetables. If you 
choose to build a sunroom, you can use it as extra living space when it’s not 
too hot.

Banishing hot air with a solar attic fan
If you’ve ever gone into your attic on a hot summer day, you know what real 
heat is all about. It can get so hot that it’s dangerous. Temperatures over 
160°F are not uncommon. All that heat stays up there all night, and it tries to 
sink into your house through the insulation in your ceiling. Most homes have 
passive, natural venting schemes in the attic, but that doesn’t do much to get 
the hot air out of your house.
A properly designed solar attic vent fan can move a lot of air over the course 
of a day. The system works hardest when there’s a lot of sunshine. You don’t 
need to run expensive electrical power up to the fan, which means you can 
install one just about anywhere you want.
As a do-it-yourself solar project, a solar attic vent fan is ideal because you get 
to use some PV panels, which is fun (if your definition of fun is cool hardware). 
You won’t get any electrical shocks from the low voltages, and the tools required 
are minimal. You can complete the project in one day, and you’ll discover a lot 
about your house by studying the layout and functionality of your attic.
Using a solar swimming 
pool heater or cover
Swimming pool covers basically accomplish the same thing as solar pool 
heaters but cost about 3 percent as much (they’re about $150). They keep a 
pool cleaner, so you save on chemicals as well.
You can attach the cover to a retracting mechanism so that you won’t hate 
your cover like you would if you had to fold it by hand every time you swim. 
The cheapest manual retractors cost around $300. You also can install an 
electric retractor, but now you’re talking about the kind of money you’d 
spend on a solar water heater, so you might as well put in one of those 
instead.
