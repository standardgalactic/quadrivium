Dedication
To Molly, who never misses a meal, but who often has to wait for dinner while
her mom is helping other people find better ways to eat.
Author’s Acknowledgments
First, I must thank my acquisitions editor, Mikal Belicove, who recommended
that I write this book and then worked very hard to get it off the ground. My
project editor, Georgette Beatty, was my best motivator throughout this pro-
ject, showering me with words of praise and encouragement at every turn.
Thank you, Georgette! Many thanks also to Chad Sievers, copy editor extraor-
dinaire, for ensuring clarity and adding a touch of humor, and to Emily Nolan
and Patty Santelli, for double-checking the accuracy and taste of the recipes
and making sure my calorie counts were correct.
I’m in great debt to every dieter who has ever shared his or her weight-loss
story with me and every weight-control expert who understands that it’s not
just about the food. Your contributions are invaluable.
Much gratitude goes, as always, to the ever-growing list of people who pro-
vide me with such generous amounts of friendship and support. Special
thanks to David Ricketts, Dui Seid, Ray Robbenolt, Lorraine Kenny, Sally
Xuereb, Juliette Knight, Andrea Sperling, Esther and Jaimie Meyers, and last,
but never least, my mother, Irene McQuillan.

Introduction
I
f your love affair with food is out of hand or if you’ve developed a love-
hate relationship with food that makes eating an unpleasant experience,
you have the right book in your hands. I’ve been a dietitian, and a food and
nutrition writer and editor, for almost 20 years. I’ve seen it all when it comes
to weight control — every diet, every gimmick, every scheme devised to trick
people into thinking that weight loss will come easy if you just buy the right
product or read the right book. I’m here to convince you that the only real
solution to weight control is to eat right, exercise regularly, and stay away
from fad diets. I offer no gimmicks, but I can make this promise: If you’re
ready to give up on quick-fix diets and commit to a low-calorie lifestyle, you’ll
shed pounds and maintain a healthier weight for good.
Whether you’re trying to lose 15 pounds or 150 (or some number of pounds
in between), there’s only one sure way to do it. You must eat less and exer-
cise more. If that’s all you need to know, then you can close this book and
start losing weight. If you need a little more guidance, read on.
About This Book
In this book you can find a low-calorie diet plan, complete with weeks and
weeks of calorie-controlled menus and more than 60 optional recipes.
(Optional means that the recipes fit right into menu plans, but you don’t have
to use them if you don’t feel like cooking.) You can skip the first five chapters
of this book, if you prefer, and go straight to the plan. Or, if you need some
time to prepare yourself, you can start reading anywhere in this book and
pick up plenty of weight-loss advice and inspiration.
I like to think that as soon as you start reading, you won’t be able to put this
book down; you’ll want to consume every word (so to speak) from cover to
cover. Every chapter is an independent, self-contained unit. If one chapter
has something that needs explanation or information found in another chap-
ter, you find a reference. You know where to go for more information.
Much of what’s in this book may not apply to you right now. Weight loss hap-
pens in stages, and this book covers all those stages, so you probably want to
find out what you need to know to get through the stage you’re in right now.
Then, when you’re ready to move on to the next stage, you can flip to the
appropriate chapter and read more.

That’s the great thing about For Dummies books. You can open them up to
any chapter and start reading; you don’t have to start at the beginning and
end at the end. In fact, For Dummies books never really end. They’re refer-
ence books that you can keep on your bookshelf to refer to again and again.
Conventions Used in This Book
This book contains more than 60 recipes and several conventions hold for
them. The best way to prepare any dish from a recipe, by the way, is to read
the recipe through before you begin, gather all the required equipment and
ingredients, and measure and prepare any ingredients as indicated in the
ingredient list before moving on to the general directions.
For successful cooking, follow the recipe directions in step-by-step order and
be aware of the following conventions:
 Ingredients are listed in the order in which they’re used. Arranging them
in this order on your work surface can be helpful.
 All measurements are level. Flour, sugar, and other dry ingredients are
measured in graduated metal or plastic cups that can be filled to the top
and leveled off with a metal spatula or the dull side of a knife. Liquid
ingredients are measured in a spouted glass or plastic measuring cup
with extra room at the top to prevent spilling. Place the measuring cup
on a flat surface and fill with liquid, bending to read the measure at eye
level, if necessary.
 Dairy products are usually reduced-fat or fat-free varieties unless other-
wise specified.
 Eggs are large.
 Onions are yellow unless otherwise specified.
 Salt is table salt.
 Pepper is freshly ground black pepper unless otherwise specified.
 Preheating directions are included in all recipes that call for the use of
an oven, grill, or broiler. Allow at least 15 minutes for the oven to come
to the correct temperature.
 All temperatures are Fahrenheit. (Check out Appendix C for information
about converting temperatures to Celsius.)
 A recipe that yields 4 servings may serve four people or it may serve
only two or three, depending on the eating habits of your fellow diners.
For you and anyone else who is following a low-calorie diet plan, a single
serving fits the parameters of this diet.
2
Low-Calorie Dieting For Dummies 

 The nutrition information at the end of each recipe is based on the ingre-
dients called for in that recipe. If you change the ingredients, the nutri-
tion information will change too.
T If you need or want vegetarian recipes, scan the list of “Recipes in This
Chapter” on the first page of each chapter in Part IV. A little tomato in
front of the name of a recipe marks that recipe as vegetarian. (See the
tomato to the left of this paragraph.)
Here are some other nonrecipe conventions you find in this book:
 Italic emphasizes and highlights new words or terms that are defined in
the text.
 Boldfaced text indicates the action part of numbered steps.
 Monofont identifies Web addresses.
When this book was printed, some Web site addresses may have been broken
across two lines of text. If you come across one like that, rest assured that I
didn’t put in any extra characters (such as a hyphen) to indicate the break.
When you go to find the site, you can type in exactly what you see in this
book, as if the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
In a handful of instances in this book, you may find text preceded by a
Technical Stuff icon. You can ignore this information if you’re not interested
in knowing more about the topic at hand. If you’re in a hurry, you can also
ignore the few sidebars (those shaded gray boxes) you see throughout the
book. Although the information in these sidebars is topical and interesting,
it’s not essential to understanding the subject. Sidebar material and anything
marked Technical Stuff both fall into the category of information that is
merely nice to know.
Foolish Assumptions
I make very few assumptions about my readers, but I do know that some of
you have been down this road before. Using this book may not be your first
attempt at losing weight. If that’s true, I can assume that you already know a
lot about the basics of low-calorie dieting, so I try to keep everything as inter-
esting and eye-opening for you as it is for first-timers.

Introduction

Regardless of how many diets you’ve been on in your life, I can assume that
right now you’re looking for motivation and a good weight-loss plan because
you’re holding on to a strong vision of a leaner, healthier, you. Rest assured;
this plan can help turn your dream into a reality.
How This Book Is Organized
This book contains 17 riveting chapters that have been organized into six
parts, including the three appendixes. What follows is a summary of what
you can find in each part.
Part I: Understanding the Basics 
of Low-Calorie Dieting
This part of the book helps you start a low-calorie diet plan by introducing
you to easy-to-read weight charts and simple formulas so you can figure out
how much weight you can realistically expect to lose and how many calories
you need to cut from your diet in order to lose them. This part assists you to
evaluate your weight-loss history, understand your metabolism, and see why
eating well is so important on a low-calorie diet.
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week
Plan and Beyond
In this part of the book, you establish your diet and fitness goals and dis-
cover how to prepare yourself (and your kitchen) for living a low-cal lifestyle.
This part provides the actual diet plan, including four weeks of calorie-
controlled daily menus you can follow strictly or use as guides to low-calorie
eating. You can find food shopping tips and “alternative” menu plans to help
keep your diet interesting. One of the most important chapters in this part
helps you examine your attitude and see how it affects both your behavior
and your ability to lose weight and maintain a healthier weight. You also find
tools to help you improve your eating habits, increase your physical activity
to burn more calories, find the motivation you need to stick to your plan, and
track your progress.

Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and
Moving On
Even though food is a central theme for dieters, it’s really only one piece of
the weight-loss puzzle. Losing weight and living a low-calorie lifestyle is also
about facing the issues that drive you to overeating and finding nonfood ways
to cope with stress, boredom, and other day-to-day frustrations that may or
may not have something to do with your diet. In this part, you discover how
to deal with situations that trigger overeating in and away from home. You
figure out how to stick to your low-calorie lifestyle, prevent weight gain, and
maintain your new, healthier weight after you’ve reached your goals. You also
find resources for helping yourself and getting outside help when self-help
isn’t enough to keep you on your diet.
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested 
Low-Calorie Recipes
This part of the book is what my friends like best because here is where the
food is, and my friends are the ones who get to taste most of the recipes
before the book goes to print. Besides recipes and good ideas for low-cal
breakfasts, lunches, and dinners, you also find plenty of treats and sweets.
Along the way, this part helps you figure out just how to fit all this fabulous
food into your low-cal diet plan.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has this part, which gives the author an opportu-
nity to highlight important information. My favorite chapter in this part is the
one that contains weight-loss inspirational stories from men and women who
shared their own success stories. In this part you also find the “best of the
best” reasons for losing weight and living a low-calorie lifestyle.
Part VI: Appendixes
Here you find two ways of counting calories — by individual foods and by
food groups — plus a useful metric conversion guide.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, in the left margins, you find icons, or symbols, that
serve as a guide to the type of material you’re about to read. Here’s what
those icons mean:
The Remember icon points out information that has been summarized to
make an important point. All information marked with a Remember icon is
worth remembering!
The Tip icon marks helpful or practical information. It’s not just reading
material, it’s news you can use. Wherever you see this icon, you can find
advice, tips, and shortcuts for eating leaner, thinking smarter, moving more,
and feeling better about yourself and your weight-loss plan.
When you see a Warning icon, it doesn’t mean you’re about to hear bad news
or that anything scary is about to happen or that you need to avoid that par-
ticular paragraph. Au contraire! Warning icons point out information that can
help prevent bad and scary things from happening, so don’t step around that
paragraph; read it just in case it applies to you.
Any information marked with the Technical Stuff icon is material that is a bit
more academic than the rest. You can read it or skip it. It’s not essential infor-
mation, but if you do read it, you may find out something new.
Where to Go from Here
Every dieter is different, so a book like this one has to include a wide breadth
of information and a variety of suggestions to help satisfy many needs. Many
of the tips and advice in this book can help you. Depending on how long
you’ve been trying to lose weight, you may have heard some of them before.
Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to decide, while you’re losing weight,
what will and won’t work for you in the long run. Start wherever you want
and work your way through this book to see what’s in it for you. Regardless
of where you begin, you’ll end up knowing just what it takes to stay at a
healthier weight.

eading this part can help you ease into your low-

out how overweight you are, how much weight you need

hope you come away with a better understanding of how
your metabolism works, the role of calories in weight con-
trol, and how important planning a nutritious diet at any
calorie level is.

Living a Low-Calorie Lifestyle
In This Chapter
 Making initial decisions about how much weight to lose
 Experiencing a new low-calorie way of life
 Winning at losing weight with great tools and techniques
 Sticking with the plan through trials and tribulations
O
n any given day, one out of four Americans is doing something to try to
lose weight. They change their diets, join gyms, swallow pills, and even
undergo elective surgery in a never-ending attempt to shed those excess
pounds. In spite of all these efforts, relatively few people are successful at
losing weight and keeping it off. Most diets and weight-loss gimmicks are, at
best, short-term solutions for weight control, and short-term means it’s only
for now, not forever.
By definition, your diet is simply the food you eat from day to day. With or
without a plan, you could be following a vegetarian diet, a low-fat diet, a high-
fiber diet, or a low-carbohydrate diet. Whatever it is, your current diet is how
you choose to eat. A low-calorie diet is another story, though, with an alto-
gether different meaning. To some people, it implies deprivation, suffering,
and hunger. I’m here to change that point of view.
To say you’re going on a diet implies that, at some point, you’ll come off that
diet and eat differently. It’s temporary, and a temporary way of eating only
has temporary effects. Look at it this way: If you have heart disease, your
doctor or dietitian will probably recommend a low-fat diet. You can’t follow
that diet for just six months and expect it to keep your arteries clear forever.
You must cut calories to lose weight and, at the same time, develop healthier
eating habits. You can’t turn back to your old habits if you expect to maintain
a healthier weight for the rest of your life.
This chapter introduces the idea that the key to successful weight control is
developing a low-calorie lifestyle plan. This chapter also explores the many
facets of living a life devoted to lighter eating and better health. In this chap-
ter you can find an overview of the tools you need, the plan’s details, and the
resources available to help you lose weight without fear of gaining it back. I
discuss everything in greater detail throughout the book.

Deciding How Much Weight to Lose
Think about a time when you were at a comfortable weight. Now, think about
how much you weigh right now. The difference between the two is probably
the number of pounds you’re aiming to lose. That’s probably your long-term
goal (which means you don’t expect it to happen tomorrow, this week, or
even this month, but you do expect it to happen eventually). Of course, you
can rely on much more scientific ways to determine how much weight you
can or need to lose. In fact, government health experts have established stan-
dards for healthy weights that you can use to gauge your own weight.
Check with your doctor before you start any weight-loss program to be sure
that your weight-loss goals and strategies are appropriate for your age and
state of health.
In this book, you can find six easy steps to help you figure out how much
weight you need to lose, whether or not your weight is putting you at risk for
serious health problems, and how to calculate a safe and effective calorie
range within which you can lose excess weight. You can find more info on the
first three steps in Chapter 2 and the last three steps in Chapter 3.
1. Consult the healthy weight range chart in Chapter 2 to figure out how
far you are from a healthy weight for your height.
Using charts and formulas for figuring out how much weight you need to
lose, or how much you need to weigh after you lose the weight, helps
keep your expectations within realistic limits. Your healthiest weight
isn’t necessarily the same as someone else’s, even if that person is the
same height. You may be built differently. That’s why, when you look at a
healthy weight range chart, you can see a range of acceptable weights
for each height listed.
2. Figure out your Body Mass Index (BMI) from the chart and formula.
This step helps you figure out whether or not your weight puts you at
risk of developing or worsening chronic medical conditions such as high
blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease.
3. Determine your waist-to-hip ratio.
This ratio tells you if the way your weight is distributed on your body
puts you at higher risk of developing chronic medical conditions.
4. Figure out your basic calorie needs.
Knowing this information can help you figure out the minimum number
of calories you need in your diet every day.
5. Calculate the number of calories you can eat and still lose weight.
This information is vital because it tells you the maximum number of
calories you can allow in your diet every day.
10
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

6. Give yourself a range of calories within which you can eat and still
lose weight.
If you know this information, you can try to stick to the bottom of the
calorie range and on days when you feel you need to eat more food, you
can go as high as the top of the calorie range.
Many dieters aim for an unrealistic weight. If you have a tendency to compare
your weight and shape to other people, you may find yourself wanting to lose
more weight than is reasonable. Don’t compare your size and shape to others.
The combined effect of your age, rate of metabolism, body type, genetic pre-
dispositions, exercise habits, dieting habits, and the number of fat cells you
carry in your body ultimately determine how much weight you can lose and
what your body will look like at any weight. That package of factors belongs to
you and nobody else and that’s what makes everyone’s body different. You
can’t stretch yourself any taller, change your bone structure, or borrow some-
one else’s genes. Be realistic in your expectations and goal setting and spend
your time planning to get into your own best possible shape.
If you’re a control freak, you’re not going to like the fact that even though you
can control the amount of food you eat, and the amount of exercise you do,
and even the way your mind works when it comes to losing weight, you may
not have as much control as you want over how much you actually weigh.
You can make every effort in the world to get down below, say, 120 pounds,
but nothing short of starvation will get you there or keep your there if it’s not
a reasonable weight for you.
11
Chapter 1: Living a Low-Calorie Lifestyle
If you’ve overweight, blame your fat
When you’re overweight, you’re also overfat.
Otherwise, being overweight would mean that
your excess weight is coming from muscles,
bones, skin, and water. That’s not likely unless
you’ve built up so much muscle from strength
training that you’ve gained weight from it, or
you’re retaining fluids for some reason, or you
have impossibly dense bones that are adding to
your normal weight. At most, you may be a few
pounds over your usual weight if your extra
weight is muscle from working out or water
retention from hormone fluctuations. But nei-
ther of these are weight concerns.
Being overweight from extra fat, however,
means that losing weight will probably be ben-
eficial to your health. If you have a family history
of high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes,
high cholesterol, or certain types of cancer,
losing weight by cutting calories and getting
more exercise can lower your risk of develop-
ing these conditions. If you already have these
conditions, losing weight may improve them.
(You can find more information about weight-
related medical conditions in Chapter 16.)

Understanding How to Live a Healthy
Low-Calorie Lifestyle
Living a low-calorie lifestyle means adopting healthier eating and exercise
habits for the rest of your life. It starts with a diet plan that cuts back on the
number of calories you’ve been consuming so that you can achieve a health-
ier weight. Your new diet plan is designed to help you lose weight safely and
effectively, and to grow into a lifelong plan for weight maintenance.
A safe low-calorie diet not only supplies enough energy to get you through
each day, but it also provides the essential nutrients you need to get from
food to stay healthy. The fewer calories you consume, the harder it is to get
enough of those essential nutrients. The way to get the most nutritional value
from your diet at any calorie level is to eat a well-balanced diet that contains
a wide variety of foods. In Chapter 3, you find more information about the
nuts and bolts of a nutritionally sound low-calorie diet.
Knowing exactly how many calories actually go into a low-calorie diet is also
crucial. Chapter 6 contains four weeks of daily menu plans that contain from
1,000 to 1,500 calories a day. You may be thinking these menus contain the
maximum number of calories you need to consume on a low-calorie diet, but
in fact, I call them minimum-calorie menus. Yes, you need to put a top limit
on your daily calories when you’re on a low-cal diet to lose weight. But you
need to put a bottom limit on your calorie count too, because if you go too
low, you’ll just trip yourself up. You’ll find yourself caught in the type of
starve/binge cycle that sabotages many a dieter’s best intentions. When you
start cutting calories, you can work within this range of 1,000 to 1,500 calo-
ries because most people can lose weight in this range. The top of this range
(1,500 calories) may even be too low for you. If that’s the case, you can add
calories back in until you get to a point where you’re more satisfied with the
amount of food you’re eating and still able to lose weight. You can always cut
back again if you stop losing weight before you reach your goal.
You never want to go lower than 1,000 calories on a self-help diet plan. Just
about anyone who needs to lose weight can lose it on a diet that allows
between 1,000 and 1,500 calories, so you don’t need to deprive yourself and
eat less. Keep in mind that the closer you get to your goal weight, the more
you may have to cut calories in order to keep losing. So first start your diet at
the highest calorie count that, combined with enough physical exercise,
allows you to lose about a pound or two a week.
Two things happen when you don’t consume enough calories.
12
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

 Your body puts the brakes on your metabolism and you start burning
calories less efficiently. That’s your body’s way of saving itself when it’s
afraid you’re going to starve. If you don’t give your body enough food, it
has no way of knowing whether or not you’ll be giving it more and so it
prepares itself for living on less by slowing down the rate at which it
uses food to produce energy.
 The other thing that happens when you don’t eat enough is more imme-
diate and more obvious: You get very hungry. If you allow yourself to get
too hungry, guess what happens? You overeat. And there goes your diet.
Getting Started on Your Low-Calorie Plan
Living a low-cal lifestyle means putting your all into it — setting your life up
in ways that accommodate your diet, such as stocking your kitchen with low-
calorie cooking equipment, discovering new cooking techniques, if necessary,
committing to an exercise program, and taking the time to find out as much
as you can about food, nutrition, and fitness.
The very first step in a self-help weight-loss plan, though, is to look inward
and figure out everything you can about yourself and about your eating and
exercise habits. Then you can begin to change your bad habits and practice
healthier new ones. Awareness is the first step because you have to know
what you’re doing wrong before you can make it right. (See Chapter 4 for
more about looking inward.)
Psyching up with goals, tools, and more
Planning and record keeping are essential tools for weight loss because they
provide both structure and a way of monitoring whether your program is
working for you. I treat the following tools of the trade separately in this
book, but you can keep these records in one journal. That way, you always
know exactly where to find each one when you need it.
 Establishing short-term, intermediate, and long-term goals (Chapter 4)
 Keeping a food diary (Chapter 4)
 Filling in a weight change chart (Chapter 4)
 Maintaining an exercise log (Chapter 8)
13
Chapter 1: Living a Low-Calorie Lifestyle

You can also use this same journal to write down all your thoughts and feel-
ings while you’re trying to commit to a low-calorie lifestyle. If your journal is
large enough, you can write down any interesting tips or advice you pick up
along the way or even store a special low-calorie recipe that you don’t have
time to prepare right now but hope to use in the future. If you want to be
ultraserious with your notebook, a three-ring binder with pocket inserts and
tabbed dividers may not be a bad investment.
Setting up a low-calorie kitchen
People who are successful at weight loss often cook many of their own meals
as a way of controlling the types and amounts of food they eat. You can find
everything you need to know to get cooking in Chapter 5, which discusses
healthy eating guidelines and shows you how to use those guidelines to create
a nutritionally balanced low-calorie diet plan.
Chapter 5 also contains plenty of aisle-to-aisle advice on the best foods to buy
in the supermarket to create healthful, low-calorie meals, how to stock your
cupboards with the most healthful convenience foods, and how to equip your
kitchen with a good selection of cookware and tools for steaming, poaching,
and other great low-cal cooking methods.
Planning marvelous meals
The daily menu plans in Chapter 6, and the alternative “theme” menu plans in
Chapter 7, are all designed to keep your diet life interesting by including differ-
ent types of foods at every meal. If you’re a creature of habit, you’ll probably
pick two or three menu plans at first and repeat them day after day. That’s
perfectly okay, as long as you don’t get bored. And if you do eventually get
bored, you have plenty of other menu plans to choose.
I developed the recipes in Chapters 12, 13, 14, and 15, covering breakfast,
lunch, dinner, snacks, and desserts, to fit right into the menu plans in Chapter
6. I also designed them to be appealing to friends and family who aren’t watch-
ing their weight. In other words, they taste good. They don’t taste like “diet
food,” which is the beauty of preparing your own low-calorie meals from
scratch, rather than relying entirely on calorie-controlled frozen dinners or
liquid meal substitutes from the supermarket. After you’ve lost weight, you
won’t have to make a huge transition from “diet” food to “real” food because
you’re already eating real food every day.
14
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

When you cook, pay attention to the serving sizes of the dishes you prepare.
If a recipe yields 4 servings, then one-fourth of the dish is the amount of food
you can eat. By taking a good look at the portioned-out foods you prepare at
home, you can figure out how to eyeball portion sizes when you eat out, and
you can develop a good sense of approximately how many calories are on
your plate, regardless of where you eat.
Exercising to burn calories 
and improve your health
As a dietitian, I focus mainly on food and nutrition, so to tell you the truth, it
was years before I really understood just how important physical activity is
to losing weight, maintaining weight, and staying as physically and mentally
fit as possible. In fact, many people focus on food more than anything else
when it comes to healthier living. You can only make so many changes at
once and when the issue is weight control, it’s natural to look at your diet
first. But I’m here to tell you now that food is one half of the calorie equation
and exercise is the other half. They carry equal weight, so to speak.
In Chapter 8, you find out that strength training is just as important as aero-
bic exercise. This chapter also discusses the many benefits of mind-body
exercises, such as yoga, pilates, and t’ai chi. Make sure you check out the
long list of ailments that exercise can help prevent and cure, because it’s
good motivational material for sticking to an exercise program for life.
Even if you already recognize the benefits of exercise in a low-calorie lifestyle,
you may have trouble actually fitting it into your daily routine. Fear not; in
Chapter 8, there are plenty of tips for finding your motivation to exercise,
choosing the type of exercise that’s right for you, and fitting exercise into
your already crowded schedule.
As you age, staying the same shape and weight you were when you were
younger becomes more difficult. For many, it’s a never-ending battle trying to
stop your various body parts from getting thick and baggy. Although some
health experts say gaining some weight in midlife is normal, you may not like
the direction in which your body is moving. I’m with you on that one! Eating
light is important for both your weight and health as you get older, but exer-
cise is the real weapon against the stalling metabolism and thinning muscle
tissue that causes your weight to creep up with age.

Chapter 1: Living a Low-Calorie Lifestyle

Staying on the Low-Calorie Track
Food isn’t everything when it comes to weight control. Sure, excess food
packs on the pounds, and a lack of food helps you shed them, so food plays
an extremely important role. And you absolutely have to know how to eat
better in order to lose weight and maintain a healthier weight for life.
But consider this point: Everyone eats, but not everyone becomes overweight
from eating. Some people seem to live on junk food but never gain weight. So
there must be something else to this weight stuff, right? Right. And that some-
thing else may have more to do with what’s happening in your mind than
what’s happening on your plate.
If you’ve been on weight-loss diets before, one of your first steps at this point
is to look back over your previous diets and see what worked and what
didn’t. Focus on the time period when you started gaining back the weight
you’d lost. What was going on? Why did you start overeating again? Or did
you just stop going to the gym? Remembering what went wrong with your
past diet plans helps prevent the same thing from happening again.
Even if this time is your first attempt at weight loss, read on, because it pays
to be prepared for the challenges faced by most dieters. In the following sec-
tions, I discuss the roadblocks you may face, explain when and how to
reassess your plan to be sure it continues to work for you, and give you tips
for seeking extra help.
Working through challenges
What happens when you’re trying to stick to a low-cal diet and you find your-
self in the midst of an office party or your parents’ 25th wedding anniversary
celebration? One thing is for sure: You need a plan. For instance, you can
bring a very light lunch the day of the office party and plan in advance to
have a light dinner waiting at home. You can spend an extra 20 minutes at the
gym the morning of the event.
You can find more ideas for dealing with special circumstances in Chapter 9,
but remember that you’re not going to blow your diet with one evening of cel-
ebratory overeating. The best advice anyone can give you is simply to enjoy
yourself, try not to go overboard, and get back on your plan the next day.
Every day can’t be a party when you’re on a low-calorie plan to lose weight,
but when you’re watching what you eat on a regular basis, you do have room
in your calorie budget for occasional excess.
16
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

The challenges you face when you’re trying to lose weight also include the
daily events in your life that trigger you to eat in response to your emotions or
to eat when you’re not really hungry. The “cure” is to recognize and address
these situations so you can eliminate eating triggers that have nothing to do
with real hunger. Some of these triggers, such as boredom, loneliness, and
anxiety, come from within you; others, such as dealing with an unpleasant
work situation or an angry spouse, come from outside.
Regardless of where your overeating triggers come from, you have to figure
out how to resist them before you can move on to a healthy weight. Otherwise,
you’ll continue to turn to food whenever you’re coping with emotional situa-
tions. Chapter 9 discusses the many forms of emotional eating and offers solu-
tions for dealing with trigger situations head on.
Assessing your progress from time to time
When you take the self-help approach to weight loss, you have to monitor
yourself because you’re the only one who can do it. (If you have a diet buddy,
then you can monitor each other; see Chapter 11 about finding a diet buddy.)
Even with a diet buddy, self-monitoring is important. Basically, you’re both
the dieter and the diet counselor. After you set up the diet plan, the dieter
has to check in periodically with the diet counselor to make sure it’s working.
To self-monitor, stop occasionally and ask yourself the following questions:
 Are you happy with your program?
 Are you losing weight at a steady pace?
 Are you reaching your short-term goals?
 Is your support system working for you?
 What can you do to improve your low-calorie lifestyle?
 Does your food plan need revision?
 What’s your next step?
Some of the tools you use to assess your diet include your scale (for weekly
weigh-ins), your weight change chart (from Chapter 4), and any other logs
and journals you use for keeping track of the food you eat, the calories you
consume, the exercise you do, and any other information that may change as
you progress from a low-calorie diet into a low-calorie lifestyle.
After you start your low-calorie plan, you can check out Chapter 7 for tips on
reviewing your initial progress to make sure you’re taking your plan in the
right direction to ultimately reach your goals. When you’ve reached your goal

weight and begin a weight-maintenance phase, Chapter 10 is a great resource
for advice on adjusting your food and exercise plans and making a lifelong
habit of using the weight-control techniques that have worked for you.
Looking for help
Presumably, you bought (or borrowed) this book because you’re looking for
help losing weight. Good idea! This book can help you figure out everything
you need to know about losing weight and keeping the weight off. But that
doesn’t mean you won’t, at some point, need additional help. Don’t worry;
help is everywhere!
If you’re doing everything you know how to do to lose weight but you’re just
not losing anything, then seek help. Your network of family and friends is the
first place to start. Successful dieters have a solid support system in place to
cheer them on and help them build and maintain a healthier lifestyle. Most
people can’t do it alone.
At some point, you may want to look outside your immediate circle of family
and friends for additional support and advice. Depending on what type of
help you need, you can look in the following places:
 You can find local branches of commercial weight-loss centers in cities
and towns throughout the United States and Canada.
 Many hospitals have their own in-house weight-loss programs.
 Some physicians specialize in weight control. Be sure to get a referral
from someone you trust.
 Peer-led groups such as Overeaters Anonymous meet in churches, 
clinics, and other community centers in most cities and towns.
 A registered dietitian or state-certified nutritionist is qualified to help
you formulate a weight-loss plan.
 Psychologists who practice cognitive-behavioral therapy sometimes
specialize in weight issues.
Chapter 11 provides more information about how to know when you need
outside help and how to go about finding it. Chapter 17, which contains ten
stories from men and women who’ve battled their own bulges in a variety of
ways, may also be helpful.
If your eating behavior is out of control and you suspect you have a full-fledged
eating disorder, you can find a list of eating disorder treatment programs at
www.addictionresourceguide.com.

Figuring Out the State 
of Your Weight
In This Chapter
 Comprehending calories and your metabolism
 Looking at your dieting past
 Determining your next dieting move
 Taking measures to get to a healthy weight
T
he health and fitness business is booming, and more information about
diet and nutrition is available than ever before. However, government sta-
tistics show that at least 30 percent, or almost one-third, of American adults
are overweight. Translated to real numbers, approximately 60 million people
in this country may improve their health prospects if they lose some of their
excess weight. And that figure doesn’t include the one out of five American
children who are also carrying around more fat than medical experts believe
is healthy.
Assessing your current weight situation and figuring out how you arrived in
this state of being overweight are important first steps toward permanent
weight control. This chapter can help you uncover this information as well as
provide many helpful charts and formulas for figuring out just how far you
are from your healthiest weight.
This chapter also contains plenty of food for thought to help you examine
your weight history and understand its relevance to your current weight-loss
goals. This information is necessary for success because you have to know
where you are now before you can figure out where you’re going next. And
you also need to know how you arrived at the weight you are now, so that it
doesn’t happen again!

Ups and Downs: Discovering How People
Gain and Lose Weight
Everyone who struggles with weight control knows at least one person who
appears to eat truckloads of food but never gains a pound. It’s maddening,
isn’t it — especially when that other person eats so much of your favorite
junk food! Pinpointing the exact reasons why one person gains weight at the
mere sight of a doughnut while another person can freely indulge is difficult,
but the personal food choices you make and exercise habits you practice on
a regular basis greatly impact it. Furthermore, you may not know enough
about someone else’s habits to judge. But differences in the less obvious, and
less controllable, metabolism, basically how the body uses food to create
energy, also greatly affect how a person loses or gains weight.
In the following sections, I define metabolism, describe its relationship to
calories, and explain why some people gain (and lose) weight more easily
than others.
Understanding the basics: 
Metabolism 101
Your metabolism is the sum total of all the chemical reactions and changes
that are constantly going on in your body. These processes include fat produc-
tion, protein breakdown, toxin removal, and the general growth, replacement,
and repair of body cells that’s necessary for overall good health. Concerning
weight control, however, the focus is on energy metabolism, the process by
which your body breaks down nutrients from food and converts them into
energy.
Energy metabolism begins as soon as your body digests food and breaks it
down into its respective nutrients. Your body can use three different nutri-
ents for energy: carbohydrates, fats, and protein. (Alcohol also supplies
energy, but because it contains no nutrients and can potentially damage your
health, it’s not considered a good source.) Together, carbohydrates, fats, and
protein are known as macronutrients. (Check out Chapter 3 for more about
these and other nutrients.) Your body metabolizes each of these macronutri-
ents differently from the rest.
 Carbohydrates make energy.
 Proteins renew body cells in muscle, skin, and other organs, and pro-
duce energy if no carbohydrates are available.
 Fats make energy, or if not used, your body stores them directly as 
body fat.
20
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

In general, your metabolism works the same way as everyone else’s, but the
rate at which you metabolize nutrients is unique to you. How your body uses
the food you eat to create energy, and how the different foods you eat affect
your weight and your overall health, is a very individual matter. If you have a
fast metabolic rate, you’re able to burn calories more efficiently than some-
one with a slower metabolic rate. Many factors — age, gender, hormones,
body composition, body temperature, and your current state of health —
affect energy metabolism and help determine how effectively your body uses
food to generate energy.
Identifying calories and why they matter
You can’t see calories. You can’t hear them. You can’t even taste them. Even if
you had a high-power microscope, you couldn’t identify the calories in a
sample of food. That’s because a calorie isn’t a “thing.” It’s a measurement,
like an inch or an ounce or a mile. A calorie measures the amount of energy
produced when your body metabolizes foods — or more accurately, the
macronutrients in foods.
When a certain type of food contains a certain amount of calories, what that
really means is that as soon as your body metabolizes a certain amount of
food, that food can provide a certain amount of energy. How many calories
are in a particular food depends on how much carbohydrate, fat, or protein
the food contains. (You can find the calorie content of these individual
macronutrients in Chapter 3.)
If the number of calories you consume equals the number of calories you
burn, you’ll maintain your current weight. If you consume more calories than
your body uses on a regular basis, you gain weight and store those extra calo-
ries as fat. I’m sorry, but you can’t avoid it. If you consume fewer calories than
your body burns on a regular basis, you lose weight. There’s no other way.
To lose weight and keep it off, you have to find your own individual balance
between the calories you consume and the calories you burn. Exercise does
boost your metabolism so that you burn calories more efficiently. The more
you exercise, the more calories you’ll burn. Even when you increase your
exercise, however, you only lose weight if you’re consuming fewer calories
than your body needs to fuel all that additional activity. It’s that simple. If
your exercise routine is very intense, you may find yourself ravenous after
your workouts and, as a result, consuming too many extra calories to lose
weight. The solution is to keep an eye on your total daily calorie intake and
be sure to factor in some snack calories every day. That way, if your exercise
routine leaves you hungry, you can use your snack calories to tide you over
until it’s time to eat a regular meal.
21
Chapter 2: Figuring Out the State of Your Weight

As you age, your metabolism starts slowing down and the rate at which you
burn calories drops by about 2 percent every ten years. If you’re still consum-
ing the same number of calories at age 40 that you did at age 20, and you’re
not exercising more, you can easily start putting on 10 or more pounds a year.
Figuring out why gaining weight 
is so easy for some people
Gaining weight is easy — many people do it! All you have to do is get into the
habit of eating the types and amounts of food that contribute more calories
than you can possibly metabolize as energy. That’s all it takes. The years go
by, and your eating habits catch up with you. Just 100 excess calories a day
(the number of calories in a handful of pretzels or a couple of mini muffins)
adds up to 36,500 excess calories at the end of a year and those calories
result in a 101⁄2 pound weight gain. After just a few years, you have a big
weight problem.
You may be the type of person who gains weight just looking at a cheese plat-
ter, while your coworker can devour second and third helpings without putting
on an ounce. Her metabolism is different from yours. It’s probably faster.
Chances are, though, her attitude toward food and exercise is different too. She
may dislike exercise as much as you do, but she may have figured out what she
needs to do in terms of exercise because she feels the payoff is worth it.
Some people simply move more than others throughout the natural course of
their day, which helps them maintain a healthier weight. Thanks to a docu-
mented phenomenon known as the “fidget factor,” these people burn several
hundred calories a day just by their use of body language. They often walk fast
and talk fast, and they can’t sit still for long. Even if their jobs keep them in
front of a computer all day, they have to get up frequently and move around. If
you know someone who frequently fidgets, you’ve probably noticed that he or
she can get away with eating more food than someone with a calm demeanor.
Everyone who has ever tried to lose weight knows that losing weight isn’t
always as simple as balancing eating and exercise. Other factors are involved
in weight gain. For instance, if being overweight or obesity runs in your family,
then you may have a genetic predisposition to easy weight gain. On the other
hand, even if your parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles are
mostly overweight, it may not be in your genes. It may just be that you picked
up bad eating habits.
Many of your diet routines — the times of day you eat, the types of food you
choose, the reasons why you eat, and even your habits of eating slowly or
quickly, reading the newspaper, or watching television while you eat — prob-
ably came from your parents, who “inherited” them from their parents, and
so on. See “Examining your family history” later in this chapter for more
about taking your family history into account.
22

Recognizing why losing weight 
is so hard for some people
Unlike gaining weight, losing weight when you’re healthy is rarely easy. Why?
Losing weight just isn’t as simple as gaining weight. To gain weight, you don’t
have to understand all the different reasons why you’re doing it. You just have
to overeat or underexercise. To lose weight, and lose it for good, however, you
need to have a better understanding of how and why you gained weight so
you don’t just keep on repeating the behavior. (See the next section to figure
out how you reached your current weight.)
For some people, being overweight becomes a chronic condition, just like
heart disease or osteoporosis. It won’t go away by itself and no quick-fix diet
can resolve it. You need a lifetime plan that includes a calorie-controlled diet
and exercise program you can comfortably stick with.
Hundreds of strategies for losing weight are available, but not every plan
works for every person. Everyone has a different build, metabolism, genetic
makeup, and tolerances and preferences for diet and exercise plans. That’s
why no one-size-fits-all diet exists. You have to participate in the develop-
ment of your own personal weight-control plan to be successful. Your plan
must be flexible, and it has to keep you feeling happy and satisfied or you
won’t feel motivated to stick to it.
Gaining weight is something you can do by yourself, but to lose weight, most
people need the support of family, friends, and, often, strangers in the form of
professionals and members of support groups. In the past, if diets have failed
you, your support system may have been weak. If so, you may have given up
and gone back to your old habits.
Although asking others for help may be difficult, now is most certainly the
time to do it! If you don’t have much of a built-in support system by way of
family and friends, search for a weight-loss support group that you feel com-
fortable with. Flip to Chapter 11 for more handy tips on asking for help and
using outside resources.
A Trip through Time: Taking Stock 
of How You Arrived Here
What’s your weight story? Have you lost and gained weight over the years or
is reading this book your first attempt at losing weight? Have you been over-
weight most of your life or did you put on the “freshman 15” in college and
watch your weight story go downhill from there? Maybe you gained weight
23
Chapter 2: Figuring Out the State of Your Weight

when you settled down and got married or after you had a baby. Or, maybe
you’ve been watching your weight for quite a while but just can’t knock off
those last 10 pounds.
Whatever your story is, you need to examine your own weight history to 
see how you reached your present weight. At the same time, take a look at
your family history — your parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins,
and siblings — to identify any pattern you may be following.
Reviewing your weight history
Looking back can be good when you’re trying to lose weight. I don’t mean look-
ing back and regretting every cookie you ever put in your mouth or remember-
ing all the times you tried to lose weight and failed. Rather, take the time to
look back for clues that can help you figure out when and how you became
overweight so you can move forward without making the same mistakes
you’ve made in the past. (For ideas about how to deal with old challenges in
new ways, see Chapter 9.) If you’ve tried to lose weight in the past, figure out
what worked and what didn’t work for you so you can focus on any tips and
advice that helped you stay on track (see “Evaluating your diet history” later in
this chapter to get started).
24
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 
The skinny on fat cells
You may be overweight because you have extra
fat cells in your body, or because the fat cells
you have are jumbo size. When you overeat,
you’re essentially feeding your fat cells. When
you gain weight, each individual fat cell gains
weight. When fat cells get to be around three
times their normal size, they can split and you
end up with more fat cells than you had before.
(The point at which a fat cell actually divides
varies from person to person.) This process of
cell division wouldn’t be so terrible if fat cells
died the way other old body cells do, but no.
Your fat cells live as long as you do.
Researchers once thought that people could
only grow new fat cells during specific stages
of growth, such as the first year of life and
puberty. But it turns out, people can grow them
as adults, too. If you’ve gained a lot of weight as
an adult, you may be carrying around many
more fat cells than you did when you were
younger.
When you lose weight, your fat cells shrink and
lose weight, too, but they don’t go away. Fat
cells are evil. They hang around in your body,
just waiting to fill up on more fat. They want
nothing more than to sabotage your attempt to
lose weight. Don’t give in! Don’t let them win!
The only way to come out on top is to stop
overeating and get enough exercise to burn
away spare calories from excess food that may
find its way into your fat cells.

Overweight babies often turn into overweight adults. If you were a chubby
baby who turned into a chubby kid and grew to be an overweight teenager,
then you’re probably an overweight or obese adult. If you were an overweight
child, odds are that you may struggle with your weight as an adult. Don’t fret
though. You have hope. The best thing you can do is be realistic. Accept the
challenge you’ve been given and move on. (Check out the next section about
how your family history can affect your weight.)
If you didn’t have weight problems growing up, losing any excess weight
you’ve accumulated in your adult years may be easier, because your weight
gain is probably circumstantial. You may have gained weight because you left
home and freed yourself from your parents’ strict rules about what you could
and couldn’t eat and started eating more junk food. Now you need to get back
on track and make healthier choices. Or you may just need to discover a little
more about how your metabolism naturally slows down as you get older and
what you can do about it.
Examining your family history
If being overweight is a part of your family history, the bad news is that you
may have inherited a genetic tendency to become overweight yourself. That’s
the sad truth. When you inherit a tendency toward being overweight, it’s the
same as having a family history of any medical problem. Although you may
or may not be affected, you have to be careful and do what you can to pre-
vent the same thing from happening to you. The good news: If you see that
you’re starting to resemble the heavyweights in your family, you can do
something about it. You didn’t inherit any actual fat, you only inherited a ten-
dency to collect it. To a certain degree, you can control your tendencies and
change your destiny.
If being overweight runs in your family, losing weight is probably going to be
harder for you than for someone with leaner relatives. If you inherited bad
eating habits along with a genetic tendency to gain weight, losing weight is
even more of a challenge. You’ll be fighting your genes and trying to break a
lifetime of bad habits at the same time. You can do it! (Check out Chapter 4
for info and tips on breaking bad habits.)
If you’re not the only overweight family member, you may be able to enlist
the help and support of other relatives who are struggling with similar issues.
If you live with family members who are overweight, you can follow these
suggestions and make it a family effort:
25
Chapter 2: Figuring Out the State of Your Weight

 Figure out how your immediate family members can help you and per-
haps help themselves at the same time. The best thing you can do is
employ practical solutions. Reading this book is a good start. No lectures,
please!
 Cook together or share what you know about low-calorie cooking. If
your mother or significant other does the cooking in the house and you
want it done differently, share a few low-calorie cooking tips. You can
also spend time and discover tips together. (Chapter 5 is a great place to
start.)
 Go food shopping together. Make grocery shopping a family affair.
While shopping, monitor each other’s choices as you walk up and down
the aisles.
 Exercise together. Get the family together for group exercises or at the
very least, a family walk after dinner (instead of dessert).
A New Beginning: Altering 
Your Diet Plan
Getting yourself into better shape can start today. It isn’t too late. You’re
never too fat or too old to start eating better, and only certain people with
certain medical restrictions have valid excuses for not eating better or get-
ting more exercise. Even people with medical problems usually have alterna-
tive solutions.
If you’re older, or even if you’re young but you’ve been dieting unsuccessfully
for many years, you first may need to undo some extra damage. The longer
you indulge in unhealthy eating habits, the more ingrained they become and
the harder they are to change. The more times you go on a temporary diet,
lose weight, and then gain it back again, the more total weight you’re likely to
gain. After a number of years, you may be heavier than if you hadn’t gone on
any diets at all.
The trick now is to never give up hope and play an active role in developing a
healthful, lower-calorie eating plan you can stick to for your lifetime. The fol-
lowing sections provide advice for folks who are new to healthy eating and
for those of you who are weight-management veterans. You have the benefit
of diet wisdom now. Use it!

Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

For beginners only
You may encounter more weight-loss misinformation floating around than
reliable advice. If you’re new to the weight-loss game — and it is something of
a game — you’re going to hear and read all types of tips and advice on how to
do it, what foods to eat and not eat, and what works and what doesn’t. Listen
selectively! Listen only to true experts, including seasoned dieters who’ve
been there, tried that, and can tell you the truth about fad diets and other
weight-loss gimmicks. Remember that in the diet industry, everyone has
something to sell, so spend your money wisely!
The following sections separate dieting myths from truths and give you tips
on how to start living your low-calorie lifestyle.
Deciphering weight-loss fact and fiction
Weight-loss myths abound and this section for “newbies” is a good place to
dispel as many of them as possible. Experienced dieters have heard these
myths before, though some of you old-timers who are reading this info may
appreciate the reminders.
Here are six popular diet myths, debunked:
 Eating in between meals makes you fat. The truth is, snacking can actu-
ally help you lose weight. The purpose of a snack is to prevent you from
getting so hungry that you overeat at your next meal. (For more about
healthy snacking, see Chapter 15.)
 You must stick to a strict number of calories to lose weight. In fact, 
you can lose weight with a range of calories (for more info, check out
Chapter 3). Also, you’ll be more successful at weight loss if you give in
and cheat a little (with an emphasis on “little”) once in while, especially if
you feel hungry, than if you allow yourself to get too hungry and end up
binge eating.
 Eating certain specific foods helps you burn calories. Have you ever
heard that you can lose weight by eating only cabbage soup? How about
the grapefruit diet? Has anyone ever told you that it takes more calories
to digest an apple than the apple itself contains? If you haven’t heard
any of these stories yet, you will. Unfortunately, none of them are true.
Sure, digesting your food does take some energy, and it involves burning
calories, but there’s no such thing as a “digestion diet.” No matter what
type of food you eat, the digestion process could never use up enough
calories to make any difference in your weight.
27
Chapter 2: Figuring Out the State of Your Weight

 Eating late at night causes you to gain more weight than eating during
the day. Not true. The total amount and type of food you eat is what
matters, not when you eat it. Many people often eat after dinner as a
form of entertainment or a way to alleviate boredom, not to satisfy
hunger, so the food choices tend to be higher calorie snack foods. If food
is a form of entertainment for you, the more you feel bored, the more
you’ll eat. (Chapter 9 talks more about why people eat when they’re not
really hungry and how to battle this problem.)
 Reduced-fat and fat-free foods can help you lose weight. Certain natu-
rally fat-free foods, such as vegetables and fruits, can help you lose
weight because you can fill up on larger quantities of these foods for
fewer calories than if you were to choose food higher in fat. Fat-free con-
venience food products, however, are another story. Many of these
foods contain so much added sugar or other ingredients that they con-
tribute just as many, if not more, calories to your diet.
 Using sugar substitutes helps you lose weight. As I write, a new wave of
diet products is pushing its way onto supermarket shelves. These prod-
ucts all contain the most recently approved sugar substitute that
slashes their calories in half. The sudden appearance of these products
coincides with a rising trend of eliminating sugar from the diet to lose
weight and the release of new dietary guidelines from government
health experts, advising overweight people to cut calories to lose
weight. How convenient for food manufacturers!
Over the years, I’ve seen just about every weight-loss trend and gimmick
come and go and come back again. You may not have seen it all yet, but
you have access to the same facts I do and you can probably put two
and two together as well as I can. Check out these two facts:
• On the whole, Americans have gotten fatter and fatter over the
past 100 years.
• Sugar substitutes, also known as artificial sweeteners and low-
calorie sweeteners, have been around for more than 125 years.
Put two and two together and the answer is that sugar substitutes are
not the answer to weight control! (Check out Chapter 5 for more informa-
tion on sugar substitutes.)
Using sugar substitutes is a matter of personal choice. If you’re comfort-
able with the products and you want to use them in your low-calorie
plan, it’s entirely up to you. The problem with sugar substitutes is that
they may lead you to believe you can eat more food because you’re not
getting as many calories from sugar. Sugar substitutes don’t teach you
how to eat less food overall, and that’s why, in the bigger picture, they
don’t work as a weight-loss tool.
Starting from scratch
If this diet is your first attempt at losing weight, then you’re in luck. Although
it’s never too late to shape up, doing so is much easier if you aren’t already
frustrated by years of failed attempts.

Keep an open mind when you set out to lose weight. Initially, you have a big
job ahead of you. Sure, you can skip all the reading, journaling, calculating,
and planning suggested in Chapters 3, 4, and 5 and just head straight for the
actual diet plans in Chapter 6. But chances are, if you do that, you’ll be back
to this chapter in no time, trying to figure out what went wrong.
The more research you do upfront to understand how you arrived in your
state of being overweight and to develop a personal plan for yourself to lose
weight, the more successful you’ll be in the long run. This first diet may be
your last if you approach it somewhat cautiously, rather than diving in head-
first. Yes, you want to feel confident, but you also need to know what you’re
doing in advance. Almost every success story starts with a well thought-out
plan, and every chapter in this book counts as part of a bigger plan to help
you lose weight once and for all.
For pros
Expectations have a lot to do with success. Your expectations also have every-
thing to do with how confident you feel about yourself and about your ability
to lose weight. Your expectations must be realistic, of course, or you’ll be dis-
appointed early on. This book isn’t designed to help you lose 10 pounds by
the end of next week. This book’s intention is simple: to show you the only
surefire way to lose weight and help make the path to permanent weight loss a
little easier to follow.
If you have plenty of experience with dieting, you’re probably more receptive
to ideas that worked for you in the past, and skeptical about advice that
didn’t work or that you didn’t enjoy following. That’s okay; just remember to
be open-minded concerning weight-loss ideas. This book helps you get as
much pleasure as possible out of food while you’re discovering how to live a
low-cal lifestyle. I hope you can find some new ideas in this book that work
for you, that make low-calorie dieting as satisfying as possible, and that hold
your interest long enough that you can follow through on your goal to main-
tain a low-cal lifestyle and feel good about the way you look and feel.
In the following sections, I ask you to look at the diets you’ve tried, and I
explain how to move on to a new low-calorie lifestyle.
Evaluating your diet history
Are you a weight cycler? If you’ve gained and lost weight repeatedly through-
out your life, then you probably fit the bill. If you’re a weight cycler, you’ve
probably been on numerous diets. You lose weight while you’re on the diet,
and then gain it back soon after you stop dieting. So you go on another diet,
lose some of the weight you gained last time around, and then gain it all back
again. Sometimes you even gain back more than you originally lost. Sound
familiar?
29
Chapter 2: Figuring Out the State of Your Weight

This up-again, down-again weight cycling is called yo-yo dieting. Some medical
experts say that yo-yo dieting is more dangerous to your health than being
overweight. They say that you’re better off staying at the same weight, even if
it’s higher than your ideal weight, than you are to repeatedly lose weight and
gain it back again. Not all experts agree, however, because plenty of scientific
evidence shows clear associations between being overweight and a number of
medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.
So finding a diet plan that helps you stay as close to your ideal weight as pos-
sible still makes good health sense. The clue to success is to stick with that
plan for the rest of your life. That’s why choosing the right plan is essential.
Moving on
If you’ve been on more diets than you can count and never managed to main-
tain a healthy or comfortable weight, then the thought of dieting probably
aggravates you. You’re probably frustrated because every diet you ever went
on was somehow about deprivation. Don’t eat this food. Don’t eat that food.
After a while you felt deprived and never satisfied about what you were
eating. Are you really surprised that you became discouraged along the way
and gave up? No diet will ever work if the focus is on deprivation.
Think realistically about the different diets you’ve followed in your lifetime
and why they didn’t work in the long run. Make a list of what you liked and
didn’t like about all the diets in your life. Reject anything you didn’t like
because it’s probably not going to work any better for you the second time
around. Incorporate what you liked and what you found helpful into this plan.
You can probably live comfortably on fewer calories than you’re now eating,
but what’s most important for long-term success is that the calories you do
eat come from foods you enjoy and that you don’t feel unnecessarily deprived.
Low-calorie dieting to lose weight means eating fewer calories than you’re cur-
rently eating, but you don’t have to deprive yourself. You can cut calories and
still fill yourself up with plenty of good food. A low-calorie diet that works is
one that is flexible enough to allow you to eat any food you want and still stay
within your calorie allowance. On this type of diet, you have the choice of
eating larger quantities of low-calorie foods or smaller quantities of higher
calorie foods, or a combination of both. You have choices and you can change
your mind from day to day about how you want to eat to stay motivated and
stick to your plan.
Tools of the Trade: Figuring Out 
How Overweight You Are
When you’re overweight, you usually know it. Your clothes feel tight and your
body bulges where it didn’t before. You feel like you’re jiggling when you walk
down the street. You look in the mirror and your excess weight is staring
30
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

right back at you. Ignoring it is difficult because half of your total body fat lies
just beneath your skin.
Being overweight means different things to different people. The following
definitions clarify it so you clearly understand when health experts use the
terms overweight and obese.
 Overweight means you’re 10 to 20 percent higher than your normal,
healthy weight. (You can determine your healthy weight in the next sec-
tion.) For instance, if a healthy weight for you is 125 pounds, you’re
overweight if you weigh 13 to 26 pounds more than that, or between 138
and 151 pounds.
 Obese means you weigh 20 percent or more than your normal, healthy
weight and your excess weight comes from body fat.
If your extra weight is from muscle you’ve developed by lifting weights
or doing other exercises, you may be several pounds overweight by any
of the usual standards. This type of overweight is different from the type
of overweight that results from excess fat, and the usual standards don’t
apply to you. The standards only apply if you’re “overfat,” which means
your excess weight is coming from excess fat and may be a threat to
your health.
 Morbidly obese means you’re 50 to 100 percent above your healthy weight
or you’re sufficiently overweight to have serious health problems.
The following sections are devoted to different ways you can measure your-
self and compare yourself to standard weight charts to see just how far you
are from your healthy weight. This information can help you establish your
long-term weight-loss goal in Chapter 4.
Interpreting a healthy weight range chart
Nutrition experts developed the weight range chart in Figure 2-1 to provide
weight-loss professionals and dieters with a quick and simple way to deter-
mine healthy weights according to height, for men and women alike.
Find your height in the first column on the left side of the chart, and then
move your finger across the graph to a midway point in the healthy weight
section to find out approximately how much you should weigh when you’re
at your healthiest weight.
31
Chapter 2: Figuring Out the State of Your Weight

Most importantly, this chart shows you a 25-pound weight range for different
people who are the same height. Even if you and I are the same height, we
may have different amounts of bones and muscles. If you have more muscle
and denser bones than me, you may weigh more than I do, but you’re not any
more overweight than I am. A higher weight within the range probably applies
to you, and a lower weight probably applies to me. Men, for instance, often
have a higher percentage of muscle tissue and bone mass than women. A
younger woman probably has more muscle and bone than an older woman of
the same height. Your healthiest and most comfortable weight probably falls
somewhere midway in the range for your height.

Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

Just because a healthy weight range chart provides a wide range of healthy
weights for your height doesn’t necessarily mean gaining weight to the top of
your range is healthful. Higher weights are generally considered the norm for
men, very athletic women, and anyone else who has a larger frame and more
muscle weight.
Computing your BMI
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a slightly more accurate way of measuring yourself
than simply looking yourself up on a healthy weight chart. In combination
with your waist measurement (which I cover in “Determining your waist-to-
hip ratio” later in this chapter), BMI can tell you if your weight is putting you
at risk of developing chronic medical conditions.
You can use either the formula or the chart in the following sections to deter-
mine your BMI. The formula is just slightly more precise than the chart; I pro-
vide the formula for those of you who like doing diet math. The chart is an
easy way out for the rest of you!
Using the formula
To compute your BMI mathematically, use the following formula:
(Your weight in pounds) × 704
divided by (your height in inches)
divided again by (your height in inches)
If your weight is within a healthy range, your BMI will be between 19 and 24.
A BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight, and a BMI greater than 30
means you’re obese and may be at risk of developing weight-related health
problems. If your excess body weight is from muscle, however, a high BMI
may not be indicative of health problems.
For instance, if you weigh 153 pounds and you’re 63 inches tall:
153 × 704 = 107,712
107,712 divided by 63 = 1,709.7
1,709.7 divided by 63 = 27.1
In this case, your BMI is 27.1, and you’re considered overweight.
Checking out the chart
To use the chart in Figure 2-2, find your height in the first column, and then
move your finger along that row until you find your weight. Move your finger
straight up that row until you hit your BMI.

Chapter 2: Figuring Out the State of Your Weight

Determining your waist-to-hip ratio
If you own a measuring tape, you can measure yourself to determine where
you carry most of the excess fat on your body. Calculating your waist-to-hip
ratio helps you determine not only where you carry most of your fat, but also
how much of a threat your fat actually poses to your health.
Inch by inch
Do you want to figure out where your extra weight is (if you don’t already
notice it in a mirror?) and if that makes you an apple or a pear? If so, this sec-
tion can help. Use a tape measure and take the following steps to figure out
your waist-to-hip ratio:

1. Stand in a relaxed position with your feet together and your belly
hanging out.
(You don’t necessarily want to be standing in front of a mirror when you
take this measurement.)
2. Measure your waist at its narrowest point.
Write down that number.
3. Measure your hips at their widest part (midway around your butt).
Write down that number, too.
4. Divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement.
The resulting figure is your waist-to-hip ratio.
Your weight is considered healthy if your waist-to-hip ratio is less than 0.8 for
women and less than 0.9 for men. If you’re a woman and your ratio is between
0.8 and 0.85, or a man with a ratio between 0.9 and 1.0, you may be at moder-
ately high risk of developing health problems associated with being over-
weight. Higher ratios indicate higher risk.
Nowadays, your waist size gets more attention from health experts than its
relationship to your hips. One of the most significant predictors of health
problems is a large waist size coupled with a high BMI. If you’re a man with a
waist size more than 40 inches or a woman with a waist size more than 35
inches, and your BMI is higher than 25, you’re at an especially high risk for
developing health problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.
Apples and pears
So after you know your waist-to-hip ratio, you can determine what type of
fruit shape you are. Apples and pears exemplify two very specific body types.
 An apple-shaped person carries his excess weight on the upper half of
his body, around the waist. If you’re an apple-shaped person, your waist-
to-hip ratio is less than 0.8 if you’re a woman and less than 0.9 if you’re a
man. (The formula for figuring out your waist-to-hip ratio is in the previ-
ous section.)
 A pear-shaped person carries most of her weight below the waist, on the
hips and thighs, and in the rear. If you’re a pear-shaped person, your
waist-to-hip ratio is higher than 0.8 if you’re a woman and higher than
0.9 if you’re a man.
35
Chapter 2: Figuring Out the State of Your Weight

Apples are at greater risk of developing high blood pressure, heart disease,
diabetes, and certain cancers than pears. But if you’re an apple, never fear!
You can eat less and exercise more to reduce your belly fat and possibly
reduce your risk of developing any of these medical problems.
You inherit your basic body shapes, for the most part, and men are more
likely to be shaped like apples while women are more likely to be shaped like
pears. But no hard-and-fast rule dictates a person’s shape because shapes
change, and factors like age and alcohol consumption have been known to
turn pear-shaped women into apples, with all the associated health risks.

Working with Guidelines for
Healthy Low-Calorie Living
In This Chapter
 Doing your diet research
 Figuring out your calorie counts
 Getting the scoop on low-calorie nutrition
 Exploring ways to cut calories
M
edical doctors and dietitians have proven again and again that cutting
calories and adopting a low-calorie lifestyle, one that includes plenty
of physical activity to burn calories, is the only sure way to shed extra
pounds and keep them off.
This chapter explains why you need to commit to a low-calorie lifestyle to
lose weight, gives you formulas for figuring out your calorie needs, and lays
the groundwork for making healthy food choices on a low-calorie diet plan.
Cutting Calories for Weight-Loss Success
Before you start a low-calorie diet, you may want to know why cutting calories
is the only surefire way to lose weight and why you need to commit yourself
to low-calorie living for long-term success. Understanding the reasons behind
what you have to do is a surer road to success than blindly jumping in. In the
following sections, I compare past diet trends and explain how you can suc-
cessfully incorporate a low-calorie diet into your life.
Registered dietitians, licensed nutritionists, doctors with an active practice in
weight control, exercise physiologists, and licensed or certified psychothera-
pists who specialize in compulsive overeating are all in a position to provide
sound weight-loss advice or refer you to another expert who can. In addition
to having the appropriate educational background and experience with

weight loss and weight maintenance, these experts generally stay up-to-date
with the latest research and developments. You don’t have to get your guid-
ance directly from any of these experts, but you need to be sure that what-
ever weight-loss advice you follow comes from a reliable source.
Comparing low-calorie diets to other diets
If you’ve been around for a few years, you’ve probably seen a ton of popular
diets come and go. Even if you’re new to the diet scene, you’re probably well
aware of the many magazine articles, books, infomercials, and Internet pop-
ups that bombard you every day with promises of easy new ways to lose
weight. If you live long enough, most of these diets and promotions will sur-
face again in some form, making the same old promises to a new audience of
overweight people looking for that one magic diet that really works.
Unlike a low-carbohydrate diet, a low-fat diet, or a high-fiber diet, a low-
calorie diet focuses strictly on limiting the number of calories you consume.
Here’s a secret, though: All diets, no matter what nutrients they’re high or
low in, must restrict calories if they help you lose weight.
Counting calories is the oldest method of intentionally losing weight, going
back at least as far as 1918, when Dr. Lulu Hunt Peters defined calories and
showed dieters how to count them in her book Diet and Health with Key to the
Calories. Peters recommended a diet low in fat and high in carbohydrates,
and one that averaged 1,200 calories. Calorie counting has gone in and out of
fashion since that time, but now, almost 100 years later, it’s back. Calorie
counting is the only weight-loss method that has stood the test of time.
In the mid-1980s, counting fat grams became the new way to lose weight. The
message that dieters heard was that calories don’t matter as much as fat. I
actually heard people say that you could only get fat from eating fat, or that if
you stick to a low-fat diet, you can eat 200 extra calories a day. Of course,
these statements may be true if you plan your menus very carefully, but many
dieters forgot to factor in calories they were consuming from other sources.
Eventually, dieters tired of counting fat grams, seeking out lowfat foods, and
gaining weight as a result of all their efforts. The fat-free fad faded away, and
high-protein diets moved in as the new wave in weight control. High-protein
diets became very popular when dieters discovered that they could lose
weight if they cut back on carbohydrates and ate more high-protein foods at
every meal. Increasing the amount of lean protein foods you eat and cutting
back on carbs usually does help with initial weight loss. One reason why is:
Your body needs extra water to digest and metabolize foods that are high in
carbohydrates, especially high-fiber foods. When you start cutting back on
these foods, your body no longer holds onto that extra water. So along with
any weight you lose by cutting calories the first few weeks of your diet, you
lose water weight, which can be motivating when you first start dieting.
38
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

However a high-protein diet has some serious downsides. You don’t eat much
bread on a high-protein diet. No bagels, no muffins, no waffles, certainly no
cookies, cakes, or pastries. Some high-protein diets say you can’t even have a
potato. As a result of these limitations, most people can only stick to a low-
carb diet for several months at most.
If you’re considering a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, you need to know
this valuable piece of information. A sugar called glucose, which comes from
foods high in carbohydrates, is the only fuel your brain can use for energy.
Lowering or even eliminating carbs (and not getting enough glucose) affects
your body in several ways:
 Your brain could be in trouble. Your brain can only use glucose for
energy, so it can’t work without it.
 In order to protect your brain, your body turns to its muscles, breaking
them down to provide your body with substances it can use to make its
own glucose.
 Meanwhile, as your body starts using fat stores for energy (because not
enough carbohydrate is available), you develop a condition known as
ketosis.
When your body is in a state of ketosis, you’re not eating enough food,
especially carbohydrates. In response to the ketosis, your metabolism
slows down and you stop burning fat. As a result, you only want to view
this type of diet as a short-term solution for kick-starting a more bal-
anced diet plan.
Any diet that emphasizes one food group over another or virtually eliminates
a whole category of foods is bound to throw your body chemistry out of
whack. That’s why a nutritionally balanced, reduced-calorie diet that pro-
motes normal, healthy eating habits is the best route to weight control.
For most people, the goals and benefits of following a low-calorie diet are to
lose weight, to develop better eating habits, and to maintain weight loss in
hopes of reducing the health risks that come with being overweight. Chap-
ter 16 describes these benefits — which include more energy, better sleep,
and lower risk for developing medical problems such as high blood pressure
and heart disease — in greater detail.
Some experts say that weight cycling — losing weight and gaining weight
repeatedly over time — is bad for your health and that it’s better to stay at
one higher weight than to suffer the ups and downs. The jury is still out
though. No one knows for sure if weight cycling is bad for you. (Check out
Chapter 2 for more info and how weight cycling affects your overall health.)
39
Chapter 3: Working with Guidelines for Healthy Low-Calorie Living

Figuring out what a “low-calorie” diet
means to you
A low-calorie diet can take different forms for different people, but the one
thing common to all successful low-calorie diets is commitment. In the follow-
ing sections, I explain how you can personalize your low-calorie diet while
maintaining a full commitment to your new lifestyle.
Maintaining flexibility
On first glance, a low-calorie diet may seem very rigid, but cutting calories
may not be as hard as you think. Sure, you’re limited to a rather exact number
of calories, which can limit the amount of food you’re allowed to eat. But actu-
ally, if you choose to eat mostly low-calorie foods, you can eat plenty of them!
If you choose to eat higher calorie foods, you have the flexibility of eating
whatever type of food you want. You may have to eat smaller portions than
you’re used to, but no one’s going to tell you that you can’t have a bagel, a
bowl of pasta, or a chocolate cookie.
Most weight-loss experts believe that some rigidity is good when you really
want to lose weight because the closer you follow a strict diet, the better
chance you have of mastering new eating habits and seeing quicker results.
Don’t worry; you don’t have to eat exactly the same number of calories each
day or include any foods in your diet that you don’t like, just because you
think they’re good for you. It simply means that the more committed you are
to your low-calorie lifestyle, the better it will work for you.
Even though this book contains one, straightforward, low-calorie diet plan,
it’s a flexible plan. This plan has plenty of room for personalization because 
I know that no one-size-fits-all diet plan can work for everyone who wants to
lose weight. You have to be happy with your diet or you’ll never stick to it.
No matter if you like to cook most of your meals from scratch, if you prefer
stopping at a deli or restaurant for take-out on your way home from work
each day, or if you keep your cupboard and freezer stocked with convenience
foods, you can work any of these eating styles into a low-calorie diet plan that
suits your particular lifestyle.
Adopting your new dietary lifestyle
The concept of “going on a diet” fell out of fashion years ago, when both
weight-control experts and those who struggle with their weight began to
agree that weight-loss diets don’t work because they don’t keep the weight
off in the long run. Diet was recognized for what it had become to so many
overweight people: a four-letter word.
40
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

The reason is simple. If you “go on a diet,” the implication is that, at some
point, you’ll go off the diet. And that’s what most people do. As soon as
they’re off the diet, their excess weight usually returns because they’re no
longer doing what they did to keep it off.
The new way to diet is to adopt a dietary lifestyle and embrace it as your
own. Instead of going on a diet, practice healthier living by eating better,
eating less, making sure you get enough physical activity, and reprogramming
your thinking so that you can continue these healthier habits for a lifetime.
If ever there was a commitment you need to take seriously, it’s the commit-
ment you’re making when you follow this low-calorie diet plan. Let it lead you
into a healthier lifestyle that can keep you at a healthy weight for the rest of
your life. This “diet” is a commitment to never give up on yourself.
Focusing on Formulas for 
Low-Calorie Living
The first thing any dieter wants to know is “How much food can I eat?,” which
is the same as asking, “How many calories can I have?” The answer is simple:
To lose weight, you have to eat fewer calories than you’re eating now. Yes,
you can burn some of your extra calories off through physical activity, and in
fact you can burn off a lot of extra calories if you’re an avid exerciser or plan
to become one. But to lose weight, most people also have to cut some, and
often, many, calories from their diet.
If you like math, then the formulas you find in this section are for you.
Dietitians and other weight experts sometimes use these formulas to help
dieters determine a sensible range of calories within which they can safely
lose or maintain weight.
You can use these formulas to figure out approximately how many calories
you can eat every day to prevent further weight gain or to get to a healthier
weight. After you establish your calorie allowance, you can work with the
menu plans in Chapter 6, which are also designed to help you work within a
range of calories to start losing weight right away. All weight-loss formulas
are limited, however, and the results they give are very general guidelines,
not absolute numbers to live by every day.

Chapter 3: Working with Guidelines for Healthy Low-Calorie Living

Determining the number 
of calories you need
Your body needs a minimum number of calories to have enough energy to be
healthy, which is called your resting metabolic rate. By figuring your resting
metabolic rate, you can determine the amount of calories your body needs
just to keep your heart pumping, your brain thinking, your kidneys clearing,
and all your other body systems operating properly.
1. Calculate your body’s basic calorie needs.
To do so, take your healthy weight (if you don’t know it, choose a
midrange weight from the healthy weight range chart in Chapter 2), or
the weight you want to be, and multiply it by 10 if you’re a woman or 11
if you’re a man. (Men get more calories in their calculations because
they tend to be taller and have a higher ratio of muscle to fat than
women.)
(Healthy weight) × (10 or 11) = Your basic calorie needs
So, for example, if you’re a woman who is 5-feet, 5-inches, your weight
goal may be 140 pounds. Using the formula, 140 × 10 = 1,400, which
amounts to your basic calorie needs for a day.
Along with your basic calorie needs, the next three steps can help you
figure out the maximum number of calories you can eat while you’re
trying to get to your goal weight.
2. Figure out how many calories you need for the amount of exercise
you get.
Read the following descriptions and then multiply your basic calorie
needs from the previous section by the percentage that matches your
activity level.
Sedentary (20 percent): You sit, drive, lie down, or stand in one
place for most of the day and don’t do any type of formal exercise.
Multiply by 0.20.
Light Activity (30 percent): You walk for exercise, up to two hours
every day. Multiply by 0.30.
Moderate Activity (40 percent): You take exercise classes, dance,
do a lot of housework, swim, or ride a bicycle most days. You do
very little sitting. Multiply by 0.40.
Heavy Activity (50 percent): You play physical sports, have a
labor-intensive job, or engage in heavy workouts at the gym almost
every day. Multiply by 0.50.
(Basic calorie needs) × (Percent activity level) = Activity calorie needs
42
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

To continue with the example, take your basic calorie needs (1,400) and
multiply that figure by .40. (Just suppose that you take a couple exercise
classes a week and go with your kids for a couple of bike rides a week.)
Your activity calorie needs are 560.
3. Figure out how many calories you need for normal digestion and
metabolism of food.
Yes! It’s true! You burn calories digesting and absorbing the food you eat.
Add your basic calorie needs from Step 1 and your activity calorie needs
from Step 2, and then multiply the total by 10 percent (0.10).
(Basic calorie needs) + (Basic activity needs) × 0.10 = Calories for 
digestion
With the example, your basic calorie needs (1,400) plus your activity
needs (560) equals 1,960 calories. Multiply that by 0.10 and you get the
calories you burn for digestion: 196.
4. Add your basic calorie needs, your activity calorie needs, and your
calorie needs for digestion.
The resulting figure represents your total energy needs in calories.
(Basic calorie needs) + (Activity calorie needs) + (Digestion calorie
needs) = Total calorie needs
To finish the previous example, your basic calorie needs (1,400) + your
activity needs (560) + your calorie needs for digestion (196) = your total
calorie needs (2,156).
This number — your total calorie needs — represents the number of calories
you can eat every day to maintain a healthy weight at the activity level
you’ve chosen. When you’re trying to lose weight to get to a healthy weight,
this number is a good guide to the maximum number of calories you can eat
on any given day while you’re dieting. But remember: This number is just a
guide. The actual number of calories that works for you depends on how
much you exercise as well as other individual factors, such as your age and
your individual metabolic rate.
Using another formula for weight loss
If you know exactly how many calories you normally consume each day (and
you can figure that out by keeping track of your calories in a food diary, as
demonstrated in Chapter 4), use this shortcut to find out how many calories
you need to cut from your daily diet. To lose a pound of body weight in a
week without doing any additional exercise, you have to cut 3,500 calories
from your diet that week, or an average of 500 calories a day. So, if you cur-
rently consume about 2,000 calories a day, you have to cut your daily calorie
allowance by 500 calories, to 1,500, to start losing a pound a week.
43
Chapter 3: Working with Guidelines for Healthy Low-Calorie Living

At some point, the number of calories you can eat and still lose weight will
get too low and you’ll have to stop cutting calories. Your only option at that
point is to exercise more. That’s why losing weight initially is much easier
when you have a lot to lose and much more difficult when you’re down to
those last 10 pounds and you don’t have many calories left to cut.
In the following sections, I give you a couple of strategies, based on the for-
mulas in this chapter, for choosing a calorie range that can help you lose
weight or maintain your current weight and prevent more gain.
Finding your weight-loss range
Everyone has a range of calories within which they can lose weight. If, through
your calculations, you determine that you can lose a pound or two a week if
you stick to a 1,500-calorie diet, you’ll find that you can lose that same amount
of weight on a 1,400- or 1,600-calorie diet.
Sometimes the best way to find your personal calorie range for losing weight
is by trial and error. If you want, you can skip all the formulas and calcula-
tions in this chapter, go right to Chapter 6 (featuring a variety of menu plans),
and put yourself on a 1,500-calorie-a-day diet plan. That level may or may not
help, but it won’t hurt you. If you find it impossible to stick with, or if you
stick with it and lose more than 2 pounds the first week, you may consider
adding 100 or more calories to your days. (A safe limit when you’re losing
weight is 2 pounds a week. If you lose more than 2 pounds, you’re losing too
quickly. If you lose too much weight early on, you’re more likely to gain back
some or all of it.) If you don’t lose any weight at all, skip down to a 1,200-
calorie plan and see what happens at the end of a week.
After you master the art of eating low-calorie meals and sticking to a pre-
scribed number of calories every day, you may see that you can “cheat” a
little on your diet by occasionally indulging in some of your favorite higher
calorie foods and still lose or maintain weight. Eventually you can figure out
how to balance your calorie intake over the course of several days, or even a
week, rather than focusing on one day at a time.
Preventing weight gain
If you’ve recently been gaining weight, or you’re not quite ready to commit to
the lifestyle changes required to lose weight, you first want to avoid any fur-
ther weight gain. Doing so can be a huge accomplishment in and of itself.
After you stop gaining and your weight levels off, you can move on to the
next stage of your plan, which is to start losing weight.
To stop weight gain in its tracks, use the quickest formula for figuring out
how many calories you need to stay at your current weight and possibly start
losing weight: Multiply your weight times ten. Stick to within 100 calories of
that amount on most days so you can stabilize your weight until you’re ready
to embark on a sensible, long-term plan.

Understanding the Nutritional Nuts and
Bolts of a Low-Calorie Diet
Right now, you’re probably thinking more about losing weight than you are
about protecting your health while you’re following a low-calorie diet. As a
dietitian, I have to look at you more holistically. I have to look at the effects of
the food choices you make on your current and long-term health. That’s why
I’m including this primer on all the important nutrients you need in your diet
and the foods that provide them. Think of this section as a freshman level
course in basic nutrition with an emphasis on calorie control.
Getting the nutrients you need
In the old days, dietitians were trained to say “There are no good foods and no
bad foods, just too much of some foods.” That’s still true to a certain extent,
but dietitians know better now. Some foods are much better for you than
others and, for many people, some foods seem to have an addictive quality
that makes it impossible to resist eating more, after you’ve had a taste. That
quality doesn’t make them bad foods, but those foods aren’t good for you
until you gain better control over the amount you eat.
This section discusses good food sources of all the nutrients that are essen-
tial to a healthful low-calorie diet. You also figure out how to make smarter
choices with treats and sweets, and how some junk food can still play a role
in a healthy low-cal diet.
Carbohydrates
The bulk of your calories — a little more than half, or 55 to 60 percent —
should come from foods high in carbohydrates. You may have heard about
the two types of carbs — good carbs and bad carbs. The following bulleted
list explains each more in-depth and tells you why most of your carbohydrate
calories should come from good carbs.
 Simple carbohydrates: Foods high in “bad” or simple carbohydrates are
candies, cookies, chips, cakes, pies, sodas, and many of your other
favorite foods that supply plenty of calories from sugar and refined
flours, but not much in the way of good nutrition.
Simple carbohydrates are just that: simple. They’re not as complicated,
chemically speaking, as complex carbohydrates. Foods high in simple
carbohydrates, for the most part, supply mostly calories and little or
none of the good stuff. That’s why dietitians refer to these foods as
“empty calorie” foods.
 Complex carbohydrates: Foods high in “good” complex carbohydrates
include whole grains, beans, and vegetables.
45
Chapter 3: Working with Guidelines for Healthy Low-Calorie Living

Foods high in complex carbohydrates are better for you because they
contain vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals (substances found
in plant foods that are neither vitamins nor minerals, but are thought to
convey health benefits).
Fruit is the exception to the rule. Fruit contains plenty of simple sugars, but it
also contains valuable nutrients, including many of the disease-fighting antiox-
idant vitamins and phytochemicals. Dietitians and other nutrition experts
always put fresh fruit in the “good” carb group.
If you’re eating simple carbohydrates such as cookies, pastries, and fried
chips in place of healthier foods, or if you’re simply eating so many of these
foods in addition to healthier foods that you’re gaining weight, then junk food
is a problem for you. Eating these foods is okay, however, if you only eat them
some of the time and in small amounts. In Chapter 15, you can find tips and
recipes for fitting simple sugars into a healthful low-calorie diet.
Protein
When discussing protein, you first need to know about amino acids, which
are the chemical “building blocks” of protein found in food. After you eat the
amino acids in say, a hamburger, your body absorbs them via your blood-
stream where they spend most of their time connecting and reconnecting
with each other to form thousands of different proteins that do thousands of
different jobs in your body. Some of the most important roles amino acids
and proteins play in your body include
 Antibodies: These proteins protect you from bacteria, viruses, toxins,
and allergens.
 Hormones: Protein is an essential component of many of your body’s
most important regulating hormones, including those that regulate food
intake and metabolism, such as insulin and leptin.
 Repair: Protein is essential for mending muscles, bones, and skin, and
for pregnancy and growth.
 Replacement: When you wash your body, comb your hair, or clip your
fingernails, you’re losing body cells that contain protein that needs to be
replaced so that new skin cells, hair, and nails can grow.
Adult women who are at a healthy weight need approximately 45 to 60 grams
of protein in their daily diets; most men who are at a healthy weight need at
least 60 to 65 grams. Because most foods contain some protein, reaching or
exceeding those amounts from day to day is easy. Meat, poultry, fish, egg
whites, and reduced-fat dairy products are all especially good sources of
high-quality protein in a low-calorie diet, but vegetarians and near-vegetarians
have nothing to fear about getting enough protein. Legumes, nuts, breads,
pastas, and soy foods are also good sources, and even most fruits and vegeta-
bles, which are almost pure carbohydrate, contribute a gram or two.

Fat
There are many different types of dietary fats and some act very differently in
your body than others. If all you care about are calories, then the type of fat
or oil you use to prepare or flavor food doesn’t matter, because they all con-
tain 9 calories per gram or approximately 100 calories per tablespoon. But if
you’re concerned about your overall health, and I hope you are, then the type
of fat you use matters very much.
The most healthful fats are in liquid form. Olive oil, canola oil, corn oil, and
other liquid fats are thought to be best because they can help keep your
blood cholesterol and blood fats at acceptable levels. The fats to watch out
for are the hydrogenated fats (oils that have been chemically converted to
solid fats), which are listed on the ingredient labels of many processed foods
such as crackers and pastries, and the saturated fats found mainly in animal
products such as meats, butter, and whole-milk dairy products. In the case of
animal foods, you can easily trim away excess fat from meats and choose
leaner cuts of meat and reduced-fat dairy foods.
47
Chapter 3: Working with Guidelines for Healthy Low-Calorie Living

Your body needs some fat (at least 20 grams) to help absorb and transport fat-
soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A and E; your skin and hair need fat to look
alive; and your brain and nervous system need fat to function effectively. But
eating too many foods that are high in any type of fat can, and probably will,
cause you to gain weight and affect your health. Medical experts say that no
more than 30 percent of your daily calories should come from fat and many rec-
ommend even less. On a 1,500-calorie diet, 30 percent is about 50 grams of fat.
The smart thing to do, overall, is to eat small amounts of the right types of fat.
Don’t be fooled into thinking that all lowfat foods are low in calories. Some
are, but many aren’t. Check and compare the calorie counts on the labels of
similar products to be sure you’re getting a lower-calorie food. For instance,
many reduced-fat cheeses contain one-third to half the amount of calories of
their full-fat cousins. But the same can’t be said for some flavored yogurt
products and other foods, like peanut butter or cookies, that may have the
fat removed but are sweetened with enough sugar to make up the calorie 
difference.
Vitamins and minerals
Each and every known vitamin is essential to good health and you need them
all in your diet, but you only need them in small amounts. That’s good news
for low-calorie dieters who are only eating small amounts of food!
Vitamins comprise the two following categories:
 Water-soluble vitamins: These include vitamin C, all the B vitamins, and
beta carotene, which your body converts to the fat-soluble vitamin A. 
To ensure you get plenty of vitamin C and beta carotene, eat a variety 
of fruits, veggies, and whole-grains. Meat and dairy products supply the
B vitamins.
 Fat-soluble vitamins: These include vitamins A, D, E, and K. You get D
from egg yolks and dairy foods, E from vegetable oils, nuts, and wheat
germ, and K from leafy green vegetables such as spinach and broccoli.
You get vitamin A from yellow, orange, and dark green vegetables.
You don’t get energy from vitamins; you can only get energy from carbohy-
drates, fats, and proteins. But your body uses vitamins, specifically the B vit-
amins, to metabolize carbohydrates, fats, and proteins and produce energy.
Like protein, vitamins also play a huge role in the growth, maintenance, and
repair of most of your body cells.
Like vitamins, minerals help keep your body healthy by keeping your bones
dense, your heart pumping, your immune system strong, and all other body
systems functioning properly. Scientists know of 22 minerals that are essen-
tial for good health. You can find some minerals, such as iron and zinc, in
meat and seafood, others such as calcium and magnesium in dairy products,
and still others, such as potassium and selenium, from fruits, vegetables, and
grains. Minerals are just another reason to eat a varied diet!
48
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

Fiber
Fiber is a carbohydrate found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, but it’s
a unique type of carb that your body can’t digest. You eat it and it passes out
of your body unchanged. Because of the way fiber works (or doesn’t work) in
your body, it keeps your digestive system healthy and also helps regulate
blood cholesterol and sugar levels. Those contributions are noteworthy for a
substance that, technically, isn’t even a nutrient.
Fiber also has other benefits. It can help you shed excess pounds. And as
soon as you lose weight, fiber can help you maintain the loss. It’s sounding
better and better all the time, isn’t it? High-fiber foods can help you stick to a
low-calorie diet and make that diet work for you. Do you want to know how?
Read the following list:
 High-fiber foods are bulky so you feel satisfied after you eat them.
 High-fiber foods take longer to digest than other foods, so they stay in
your stomach longer, helping to prevent hunger from striking too soon
again.
 High-fiber foods are naturally lowfat, and fat contains more calories than
carbohydrates and protein.
Nutrition experts recommend that adults get at least 25 grams of fiber each
day. In Table 3-2, you see how some foods stack up in terms of their fiber con-
tent. In Chapter 7, you can find a full-day’s menu that emphasizes fiber at
each meal. In Chapter 12, you can find a list of high-fiber foods commonly
eaten for breakfast.

Chapter 3: Working with Guidelines for Healthy Low-Calorie Living

If you plan to increase the amount of fiber in your diet, do it slowly! Adding
too much, too soon, can wreak havoc on your digestive system in the form of
gas, cramping, or diarrhea. Your best bet is to add a gram or two of fiber at a
time, every few days over a period of several weeks, and be sure to drink
plenty of extra water as you go along. Fiber soaks up liquids like a sponge in
your stomach, and if you don’t have enough extra water to help move it
along, your plumbing will jam up.
Water
Water is calorie-free. No other natural substance can make that claim, so
drink up! When you’re trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight, you
certainly don’t want to waste precious calories on other drinks.
Of course you also need to drink plenty of water for other reasons. For one
thing, you can’t live long without it. You need a constant flow of water coming
in to replace the water that goes out through breathing, perspiration, and
excretion. Water keeps your muscles moving, your blood flowing, and your
joints bending. Even your bones need water to stay healthy.
Drinking more water is a matter of developing new habits. The following are
just a few ways to bring more water into your life on a regular basis:
 Keep a bottle of water nearby at work.
 Carry a water bottle with you wherever you go.
 Whenever you see a water fountain, take a sip.
 Always ask for water when you sit down at a restaurant. Not only does
asking help you fill your water needs, but it also can help fill your tummy
and curb your appetite as well.
Most people need to aim for 8 to 10 cups of water a day. If your diet is high in
fiber or sodium (salt), you may need more. If your diet is high in watery foods
like lettuce, tomatoes, oranges, watermelon, milk, and yogurt, you can proba-
bly drink less because the water from these foods counts toward your daily
requirement.
Phytochemicals
When phytochemicals first came on the nutrition scene in the early 1990s,
many people thought they were miracle substances. They weren’t vitamins or
minerals. Health experts described phytochemicals as non-nutrients found in
fresh foods that could help prevent and fight cancer and other life-threatening
diseases. Scientists estimate that hundreds, if not thousands, of them exist in
foods, most commonly in fruits and vegetables.
50
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

Researchers still have a lot to discover about phytochemicals and their spe-
cific roles in fighting disease. The jury is also out as to whether or not phyto-
chemicals work when they’re isolated from foods and put into a capsule or
pill and sold as supplements. What experts do know is that many health-
promoting substances are found in foods, some with rather unnatural sound-
ing names like lycopene, flavanoid, indole, genestein, and carotenoid, that
may save or extend your life. When you’re following a low-calorie diet, eating
a wide variety of fruits and vegetables is important to ensure you get as many
phytochemicals into your diet as you can.
Keeping your energy high and 
your diet interesting
What’s different about low-calorie nutrition and regular nutrition, you may
ask? When you’re on a low-calorie diet, you need to make smart food choices
because getting all the energy and nutrients you need from food is more diffi-
cult than when you’re consuming more calories.
Creating balance
A nutritionally balanced meal contains mostly carbohydrates from grains,
fruits, and vegetables; some protein from meat, poultry, fish, dairy products,
beans, nuts, or eggs; and a small amount of fat. With the exception of most
fruits and vegetables, most foods have at least a little bit of fat, so you’re
automatically getting some fat in a balanced meal. Small amounts of added fat
also help balance the meal.
You can easily determine if you’re eating a balanced meal. When you look at
your plate, more than half needs to be covered with foods that are high in
carbohydrates, and less than half with foods high in protein.
Balance is particularly important in a low-calorie meal plan because a balanced
diet helps ensure sustained energy as your body absorbs different types of
foods and different combinations of foods and converts them to energy at dif-
ferent rates. Foods that are high in simple sugars move more quickly into your
system and are metabolized and converted to energy more immediately. Foods
that are digested more slowly, such as some complex carbohydrates and fats,
provide energy later in the day.
Eating a variety of foods
After you balance the major food groups, choosing a variety of different foods
within those groups helps ensure a good balance of vitamins, minerals, and
other substances in food that keep you healthy.
51
Chapter 3: Working with Guidelines for Healthy Low-Calorie Living

One way to know whether or not your diet contains enough variety is to look
at the colors on your plate. The more colors you see, the better variety of
nutrients you’re getting from your meal. Eating a variety of foods also helps
keep your low-calorie diet more interesting and more appealing so that you
stick with it.
Using Proven Strategies 
for Cutting Calories
When it comes to healthy weight control, how you eat is just as important as
what you eat. The “what” is all about the actual food that’s on your plate and
in your mouth. The “how” is all about how much you actually eat, how many
calories are in the types foods you choose, and how to make low-calorie
choices within different food groups to ensure a nutritionally sound diet.
Controlling portion size
If you can control the portion sizes of the foods you eat, you can eat anything
you want. For example, if you can eat one small piece of chocolate or one
small scoop of ice cream or one handful of chips, you can eat those foods
every day and not worry about gaining weight from them. Right now, you’re
probably saying, “Yeah, right!” because you can’t imagine being able to eat
such small amounts of your favorite indulgence foods and feeling satisfied.
Don’t worry. It’s a process you have to discover; it doesn’t usually happen
overnight.
The menu plans in Chapter 6 call for very specific amounts of foods, or in
other words, portion control. When you prepare meals using these menus for
guidance, you figure out how to eyeball a specific amount of food and know
that it’s an appropriate amount to eat on a calorie-controlled diet. The portion
sizes represent an average number of calories for each food group. In other
words, you may see 1 cup of broccoli on one menu and 1 cup of mini carrots
on another. You’re free to ignore both suggestions and substitute a cup of
snow peas or a cup of asparagus. That’s because, as a group, a portion of one
vegetable contains approximately the same number of calories as the same
portion size of another vegetable. For more information on calorie counts by
portion size within the different food groups, check out Appendix B.
In addition to helping you lose weight, a good weight-loss plan shows you
how to eat in a way that you’ll eventually be able to maintain your weight
loss without being on such a strict diet. You won’t always have to struggle
with concepts like portion size, after you figure out what eating a reasonable
amount of food means. The plus side to controlling your portion sizes is that
52
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

by limiting the amount of each individual food you eat, you can eat several
different types of foods. Eating different types of foods not only helps ensure
you’re getting a balance of essential nutrients, but it also helps keep your
low-calorie diet from getting boring. (See “Keeping your energy high and your
diet interesting,” earlier in this chapter, for more about balance and variety in
a low-calorie diet.)
However, you can go overboard, even with the good stuff. On a low-cal diet,
you can eat too much of the good stuff, such as fruit and vegetables, because
all foods supply calories and even the most nutritious foods add excess calo-
ries to your diet if you eat too much of them. As a result, you need to know
how to control your portions when you’re on a mission to lose weight.
When you’re home, you can portion out your food with measuring cups and
spoons as a way of teaching yourself what a serving size looks like. When
you’re eating out, the easiest way to figure out portion control is by using
visual aids for standard serving sizes. Picture this:
 A 3-ounce serving of meat or poultry is about the size of a deck of cards
or the box that holds a cassette tape.
 A standard muffin is about the size of a tennis ball (not a softball!).
 An ounce of cheese is about the size of a pair of dice.
An even easier strategy for measuring just about any type of food is to count
on your fingers. You can use your hand to measure your favorite foods at home
and to gauge your portion sizes when you’re away from your own kitchen. For
instance, a standard portion of meat is about the size of the palm of your hand.
Make a fist, and you’re looking at a cup of vegetables or pasta. From the tip of
your thumbnail to its second joint is about the size of an ounce of cheese. The
more average-size your hand, the more accurate these measurements are. But
if you’re a large person, with large hands, you need to eat a little more food
anyway, so this strategy still works for you. See Figure 3-1 for an illustration of
this hands-on approach.
Eating “free” foods
On a low-calorie diet, you don’t always have to eat low-calorie foods. But if you
want to eat large quantities of food, then you have to make low-cal choices.
That’s the premise behind any diet that says you can eat great volumes of food
and still lose weight. After all, if I give you permission to eat all the spinach or
romaine lettuce you want on this diet, you couldn’t possibly eat enough of
either of those foods to make a dent in your diet. At the same time, you could
fill up on them or other leafy greens to cut your appetite and to make sure
there’s not enough room left in your stomach to fill up on too much of anything
else. That’s why eating a big salad (with just a little light dressing) at lunch and
dinner works as a weight-loss strategy for so many people.
53
Chapter 3: Working with Guidelines for Healthy Low-Calorie Living

The same basic concept applies when you’re choosing foods for meals and
snacks and you want to eat larger quantities of food. That’s when you have to
make low-calorie choices at the level of individual foods. You can choose to
use up your 100-calorie snack allotment by eating a small handful of fruit-
flavored gum drops or jellybeans, or, for the same number of calories, you
could eat half of a pineapple, five plums, or two cups of steamed green beans
with a spoonful of light salad dressing for a dip.

Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

Of course, if what you want to eat is a handful of jellybeans, then don’t force
yourself to eat fruit or vegetables. But these examples serve to show how
choosing lower calorie foods on a regular basis can make room for those
occasional indulgences.
When you’re dieting to lose weight, sitting down to a large quantity of food is
certainly more satisfying and less discouraging than sitting down to a plate
that contains only small portions. Whenever you need more than your calorie
limit allows or you need to “cheat” on your diet for any reason, feel free to
choose foods from this list to help fill up your plate:
 Bouillon or fat-free broth
 Cabbage
 Celery
 Cucumber
 Green or red onions
 Greens: escarole, mustard, collard, dandelion
 Lettuce (any kind)
 Mushrooms
 Plain coffee or tea, including herb teas
 Radishes
 Seltzer, club soda, sparkling water, or other calorie-free drinks
 Spinach
 Unsweetened pickles, such as dill, “new,” or half-sour
 Zucchini or yellow summer squash
To add flavor to “free” foods, use “free” condiments such as mustard, horse-
radish, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, lemon juice, lime juice, or
vinegar, or sprinkle your free foods with fresh or dried herbs and spices.
Garlic, onion, and hot peppers go a long way toward seasoning steamed veg-
etables without adding any notable calories.
Watching calories from carbohydrates,
proteins, and fats
After you decide a low-calorie diet is for you, you probably need to cut calories
where you most indulge. For example, do you eat a big bowl (or container) of
ice cream every night? Are you snacking too often on crackers and chips
between meals? Does your sirloin steak take up your entire plate? Your excess
calories probably aren’t coming from big bowls of salad, unless you’re filling
55
Chapter 3: Working with Guidelines for Healthy Low-Calorie Living

your salad bowl with cold cuts and topping it off with gobs of dressing. And
you’re probably not gaining weight from vegetable side dishes, unless the
only vegetables you choose are the starchier, more caloric ones like French
fried potatoes and buttered corn.
Look at your diet to examine your food preferences and figure out if you
overindulge when it comes to a particular food group. Keeping a food diary
(see Chapter 4), and reviewing it with this purpose in mind, may yield some
surprises about just how much of a particular type of food you actually eat.
The number of calories a food supplies depends on the amount of carbohy-
drate, fat, or protein in that food. That amount is shown in grams, which is a
measure of weight.
 A gram of carbohydrate supplies four calories.
 A gram of protein supplies four calories.
 A gram of fat supplies nine calories.
Keep in mind that a gram of alcohol supplies seven calories, which makes it
closer in calories to fat than to protein or carbohydrates. Cutting back on
calories from alcohol can help you lose weight.
When you compare carbohydrates or protein to fat, you can see that, gram
for gram, fat supplies more than twice as many calories. That’s why cutting
back on fat works for some people as a diet tool. But cutting fat is strictly a
tool for people who are eating too much fat to begin with; it can’t work alone
as a strategy for losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight.
The following sections explain how to save calories and where to cut calories
from carbohydrates, fats, and protein.
Choosing the best carbs
Contrary to some popular diet myths, cutting carbohydrates from your diet
will only help you lose weight in the long run if you’re eating too many carbo-
hydrates to begin with! If you know you overdo it when it comes to cakes,
cookies, pies, and even breads and pastas, then you probably already know
you have to change your diet to trim some of those carbs for a better balance.
Cup for cup, starchier vegetables — potatoes, winter squash, corn, and green
peas — are much higher in calories than other vegetables, but that doesn’t
mean you have to avoid them. You just need to watch your portion sizes
when you choose these foods as side dishes.
56
Part I: Understanding the Basics of Low-Calorie Dieting 

On a low-calorie diet, the best carbohydrates are fresh or frozen fruits and
vegetables, and high-fiber grain foods. For instance, if you like to eat pasta,
choose whole-wheat varieties. You can mix whole-wheat pastas with regular
pasta if you don’t want to go completely whole-grain. You can also mix brown
rice with white rice or mix rice with grains such as barley and cracked wheat
to boost the fiber.
Increasing protein
If you eat a lot of one type of food on a calorie-controlled diet, you have to eat
less of another food to stay within your calorie limit. Because fat is already
limited in most sensible diets, the choice becomes whether to increase pro-
tein and decrease carbohydrates, or to eat more high-fiber carbs and fewer
foods that are high in protein. A balanced diet gets 15 to 20 percent of its calo-
ries from protein. On a 1,500-calorie diet, that translates to at least 56 grams.
The best sources of protein on a low-calorie diet are seafood, poultry, lean
meats, reduced-fat dairy products, and vegetarian sources such as soy foods
and grain products. Chapter 5 contains plenty of information for making
healthful protein choices at the supermarket.
If you tweak your low-cal diet to include more protein, know that it’s a short-
term solution for weight control. Like other trendy diets, a high-protein plan
(a diet that gets more than 20 percent of its calories from protein) doesn’t
help you control your weight in the long run and can have a negative impact
on your long-term health (see “Comparing low-calorie diets to other diets,”
earlier in this chapter, for more info on how it impacts your health).
Trimming fat
Fat supplies more than twice as many calories as either protein or carbohy-
drates, so if your diet is high in fat, you can start cutting there. You can make
the cuts in more than one way. To cut down on the amount of fat in your diet,
you can
 Choose naturally reduced-fat and fat-free foods. In addition to naturally
lowfat foods like fruits, vegetables, and leaner cuts of meat, you can take
advantage of lowfat dairy products and other foods that may be lower in
calories because they’ve been modified to reduce the amount of fat they
contain. (Just be careful to compare labels to make sure lower-fat foods
are also lower in calories.)
 Eat a wider variety of foods so that fat takes up less space in your diet.
Fill up on naturally lowfat foods, such as salads, broths, fruits, vegeta-
bles, legumes, and grains, so that you’re not tempted to satisfy your
hunger with higher fat foods.
 Control your portion sizes. Doing so ensures that you’re not getting too
much fat from any one food. For instance, eat 1⁄4 of a bag of French fries,
not the whole thing!

In this part . . .
T
his part is the heart of the book. It tells you how to
prepare yourself for low-calorie living by evaluating
your habits, setting up your kitchen, choosing menu
plans, keeping your diet life interesting, and figuring out
the type of ongoing physical activity that fits into your
lifestyle. In this part, you set goals, keep journals, and
figure out how to adjust your attitude along with your
eating habits. And you can find out how to make it all
happen with positive thinking, mindful eating, and self-
monitoring along the way. You can see how this part
quickly became the biggest part of the book — you have
a lot to do here!

Chapter 4
Kick-Starting Your 
Low-Calorie Plan
In This Chapter
 Assessing your habits
 Taking active steps to change your ways
 Gearing up with a good attitude
 Monitoring your progress with handy tracking tools
 Being mindful of your new lifestyle
You’re probably familiar with the expression, “You can’t teach an old dog
new tricks.” It’s a cousin to the saying, “Old habits die hard.” No matter
how you say it, change doesn’t come easy to most people, and yet change is
essential to weight-loss success. My attitude is this: I can teach anyone some
new diet tricks, but some people take more time than others to get it right.
And although breaking old habits isn’t always easy, if you work hard enough
to replace them with new, healthier habits, doing so is certainly possible.
In this chapter, you assess your eating and exercise habits, establish your
short-term and long-term weight goals, check your attitude, set up a monitor-
ing system, and mentally prepare yourself to live a low-calorie lifestyle. This
chapter is the essential groundwork you need to map out a plan that can
ensure your long-term success because it prepares you for making necessary
changes in your eating, exercising, and thinking patterns.
Examining Your Current Diet Habits
You may be very open-minded, and consider yourself to be quite flexible, but
still, deep down, you may not be completely comfortable with the idea of
changing your diet, which is normal. Change comes hard to most people
because it usually means giving up something. In this case, you’re giving up
precious calories. Some change is necessary and inevitable, though, if you’re
going to break free once and for all from unhealthy behavior patterns like
overeating, underexercising, and thinking self-defeating thoughts.

In the following sections, I show you how to recognize your unhealthy behav-
iors and typical dieting styles.
Recognizing problem behaviors
Sometimes you may do something for no reason other than you’ve been
doing it that way for so long. You form habits — good and bad —by repeti-
tion. You may have acquired your earliest habits first from family members
and later from friends, but they became embedded in your lifestyle by years
of repetition.
The types of food you eat, your eating patterns, your exercise routine, the
way you think about yourself, and the way you view the world around you,
are all habits you’ve developed by eating the same foods, making the same
choices, coming up with the same motivations and the same excuses, and
thinking the same thoughts, over and over again, throughout your life. These
behaviors shape who you are. They also help determine your shape!
Know thyself
Your first step toward developing healthier habits is to look inward and think
hard about changing your ways. Thinking about change is an important part
of the process of enacting real change, so if all you can do right now is think
about it, you’re still on the right track. For more about making healthy
changes, see “Giving Yourself a Lifestyle Makeover,” later in this chapter.
You’re probably wondering why you need to do all this soul searching. Why
not just skip straight to Chapter 6 and go on a low-calorie diet? You need to
search inside because a successful weight-loss plan is about making lifestyle
changes, and you can’t change what you don’t know or understand. The
better you know yourself, the better your chances of getting to the root of
your weight problem to conquer it once and for all.
Breaking your bad habits
It wasn’t a banana that made you overweight. It wasn’t your grandmother’s
lasagna, the slice of chocolate cake at a birthday party, or that double
cheeseburger you devoured on your way home from work. No individual food
is possibly responsible for your weight gain, but your habit of overeating
some of these foods probably did you in.
Which of these behaviors contribute to your bad eating habits? Check the
ones that apply to you.

Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

❑I eat randomly.
❑I eat too much food at once.
❑I eat when I’m sad.
❑I eat out often.
❑I routinely skip meals.
❑I eat on the run.
❑I eat at fast-food restaurants.
❑I eat when I’m lonely.
❑I eat too quickly.
❑I eat when I’m not hungry.
❑I eat when I’m bored.
❑I eat late at night or just before I go to bed.
❑I eat snacks all the time.
❑I wait more than four or five hours before eating.
❑I eat a lot of high-fat foods.
❑I eat a lot of high-calorie foods.
❑I eat when I’m angry.
The habits you checked are the eating habits you need to focus on when
you’re thinking about the lifestyle changes you have to make to accommo-
date your low-calorie lifestyle.
Eating, exercise, and other lifestyle habits don’t change overnight. You can’t
just suddenly cut your calorie intake in half without some mental prepara-
tion. You can’t just get up one morning and run a marathon if you haven’t
been training. Changing the thinking patterns that dictate your behavior
takes time, patience, and a fair amount of retraining.
Playing diet games
Everyone I’ve ever counseled about weight control has admitted to some
type of self-defeating behavior. One time it was a woman who secretly snacks
on the types of foods she knows will kick off a binge. Another time it was a
guy slacking off on the exercise routine that was just beginning to show
results. If you know your own weakness, you can renew your commitment to
change the behavior that’s blocking your weight-loss success.

Chapter 4: Kick-Starting Your Low-Calorie Plan

64
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 
When making a commitment to losing weight, some people play destructive
mind games with themselves. Here are some examples:
 The “if only” game: “If only I had a faster metabolism.” “If only I had
enough money to go to a spa.” “If only I were taller and could carry more
weight.” “If only I had more time, I’d go to the gym more often.” These
excuses really don’t fly, however, because getting fit isn’t about day-
dreaming. It’s about being determined, taking action, and staying moti-
vated. No one stays in shape without having to work at it.
 The blame game: This game really is a trap that prevents you from
taking responsibility for yourself and your weight. Here’s how it goes: 
“I had a fight with my husband so I ate a large bag of potato chips.” 
“My kids drove me crazy all day so I devoured a pint of ice cream after
they went to bed.” Sound familiar?
 The “pity me” game: Feeling sorry for yourself helps you avoid commit-
ting to a fitness plan because you can just point at everything that’s
wrong with you and decide you’re not worth helping. “It’s too late.” “It’s
too hard.” “Why bother?” In some ways, you may even enjoy the atten-
tion you get for being “poor you” and may be reluctant to give it up.
Your diet personality is probably a lot like your overall personality with
respect to how easily you make commitments and motivate yourself to
approach difficult tasks. If you answer “yes” to any of the following questions,
you may be standing in your own way of getting to a healthier weight:
 Do you think someone else is responsible for the way you eat?
 Do you believe other people lose and maintain weight easier than you?
 Do you look for quick-fix solutions?
 Do you live a life of deprivation, eating foods you don’t like and avoiding
those foods you do in an attempt to lose or maintain weight?
 Does the prospect of following a diet and losing weight overwhelm you?
 Do you try to lose weight on your own, without ever seeking help?
 Do you give up easily?
 Do you feel like a failure when you fall off the food wagon and eat too
much?
The best fitness plan is one that you fine-tune to fit your personality and
lifestyle. After you answer the preceding questions, ask yourself the following
questions so you can tailor the plan in this book to suit your diet personality.
 Are you a joiner, or do you like to go it alone?
 Are you a grazer who nibbles all day long, or do you normally sit down
to three full meals and a formal snack or two?

65
Chapter 4: Kick-Starting Your Low-Calorie Plan
 Do you want someone to tell you what and when to eat in a prescribed
plan, or would you rather have a flexible diet that allows you to make
on-the-spot food decisions?
Giving Yourself a Lifestyle Makeover
The more you know about who you are as an individual and the better you
identify your habits, the easier making those necessary changes and commit-
ting to a lifelong plan of healthier eating and living will be. The following sec-
tions help you start a low-calorie lifestyle today.
Making changes one step at a time
When you’re clear about which aspects of your life actually need to be
changed, you can begin taking real steps to enact those changes.
The best place to start is with a commitment to yourself. Promise yourself that
you’re never going to give up on yourself. Acknowledge now that cutting back
on the amount of food you’re used to eating won’t be easy. At the same time,
keep telling yourself you can do it! Be your own cheerleader. Promise yourself
that you won’t kick yourself when you fall off the food wagon. Successful
dieters don’t scold themselves or give up. They give themselves a pep talk and
jump right back on.
Make small changes, one at a time, at your own pace, and allow yourself to
get used to one change before moving on to the next. For example, your first
change may be to switch from regular salad dressings to low-calorie dress-
ings. Or, you may decide to steam vegetables instead of stir-frying them to
save calories from added fat. If both of those changes appeal to you, make
one change today and the other tomorrow.
When a person takes real-life steps to make permanent lifestyle changes, sci-
entists call it behavior modification. The following examples of eating behav-
ior modification techniques can help you start your low-cal lifestyle:
 Eat before you go food shopping. When you’re hungry, you’re more
likely to make impulse purchases of foods you don’t really want to eat.
 Make a shopping list when you go to the grocery store and stick to the
list when you get there. Don’t allow yourself to buy “indulgence” foods
likes snacks and junk food that aren’t on the list. In Chapter 6 you find
low-cal menus that you can work from when writing up your list.
 Don’t buy “indulgence” foods or any calorie-laden foods. These foods
can contribute to overeating when you’re first starting a new diet. (See
Chapter 5 for more tips on shopping for a low-calorie diet.)

66
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 
 Keep healthier foods on hand and ready to eat in your refrigerator
and cupboards. Doing so gives you options other than junk food when
you’re looking for an easy snack or a quick meal.
 Prepare strict single portions so you aren’t tempted to overeat (and
consume more calories) if you’re cooking for yourself only, and not
following a recipe. When you’re cooking for yourself from a recipe that
makes more than one serving, wrap up the additional servings and put
them in the fridge or freezer as soon as possible so you’re not tempted
to go back for seconds.
 Use smaller plates. Low-calorie meals tend to look lost on larger plates
and may make you feel deprived.
 Always sit down when you eat, even if you’re just having a quick
snack, so that you pay attention to how much you eat. You can easily
forget about the calories you consume when you eat on the run.
 Leave the table when you’re finished eating what’s on your plate.
Doing so reduces the temptation to go back for more food.
 Don’t skip meals. If you do, you may overeat at your next meal or snack
too much in between.
In the section “Using Tracking Tools As You Get Started,” later in this chapter,
you discover how to document and evaluate your eating habits and identify
those that need changing. At that point, you can figure out where to make
small changes in your diet and begin to shift the eating behavior patterns
that are working against you.
Knowing your diet limits
When you go to your favorite south-of-the-border restaurant, do you order
the steamed fish and vegetable special? Do you get a baked potato on the
side and top it with a lowfat yogurt–sour cream blend? No? I’m not surprised
because, frankly, I don’t know anyone who does. Everyone I know who enjoys
Mexican food goes for the gusto — the cheese nachos, the beef tacos, the
chile rellenos, not to mention the margaritas and the lime-infused brew. How
do you handle that on 1,000 calories a day? Very carefully, I’d advise, or not at
all until you feel confident that your can order sensibly.
Some people can eat just one. No matter what they’re offered, whether it’s a
tortilla chip or a chocolate chip cookie, they take a small sample and never
go back for more. However, most people aren’t like that. If you’re watching
your weight, you may need to avoid most convenience food stores, your
supermarket’s snack section, and all Mexican restaurants.

67
Chapter 4: Kick-Starting Your Low-Calorie Plan
When you know you won’t be satisfied with small portions of your favorite
foods, stay away from them until you’re feeling stronger. Never say “never,”
but definitely figure out how to say “not right now.”
Even if you’re an independent operator and you’re used to making decisions
on your own, don’t be afraid to admit if you can’t handle this one alone. You
can find a diet buddy or an exercise buddy, join a gym, join a weight-loss pro-
gram, or seek professional counseling. Whatever it takes for you to start and
stick to your low-calorie lifestyle, do it. (See Chapter 11 for more information
and advice on asking for and getting the right type of help.)
Keeping your diet fresh
Initially, you have to make all sorts of changes in your diet and perhaps other
areas of your life. Then what? In time, your new low-cal lifestyle will get old
and you’ll have to reevaluate your plan to keep it from getting stale.
Boredom is a common trigger for overeating. Sometimes, feelings of boredom
are actually a habit of your mind. You’re in the habit of telling yourself that
you’re bored, so you feel bored on a regular basis. If that’s the case, you have
to make a huge effort to push past those thoughts as soon as they enter your
mind and find something interesting to do.
Adjusting your food plan through the seasons
Just as you need a change of wardrobe when
summer gives in to early fall, you may need to
change your food plan when one season fades
into another. Food availability changes with the
seasons and so might your physical needs. You
may be more active in spring and summer than
in winter, and you may cook more in the winter
than in the summer or crave heartier foods. You
may routinely take your vacations midsummer
and late fall, and these vacations may be oppor-
tunities to enjoy new and different foods. These
seasonal, and temporary, lifestyle changes can
affect the way you eat.
For many people, a change in seasons also
means a change in mood. If you suffer from
winter blues, your diet may suffer, too. The best
way to prepare for any seasonal changes in
your lifestyle that affect your diet is to look
ahead and have a plan in place.
Remember, too, that some things don’t change
with the seasons. You need to drink as much
water in the winter as you do in the summer, and
your body needs good nutrition and a good
physical workout all year round.

68
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 
If you spend too many nights sitting around eating and can’t think of anything
else to do, sign up for an evening cooking class (preferably a healthy cooking
or low-cal cooking class). With a class, you can still eat but you’ll be spending
most of your time learning about food and preparing food in a social setting.
You may even discover something new that can help keep your diet interest-
ing. (For more ideas on how to keep your new diet and lifestyle fresh, check
out Chapters 7 and 9.)
Checking Your Attitude
When following a low-calorie diet and controlling your weight, attitude is
everything. Well, almost everything. To succeed, you definitely need a posi-
tive attitude and a good, steady supply of resolve. That means paying as
much attention to what’s in your head as you do to what’s on your plate.
In the following sections, you find tips you can use to help keep your attitude
happy, healthy, and in check.
Finding and maintaining your motivation
Different things motivate different people to start a low-calorie diet and stick
to it. You have to find your own best personal motivators by figuring out
what matters most to you and what makes you feel good about yourself. Do
you want to be healthy, look good, live longer, and feel the tremendous sense
of accomplishment that comes from breaking bad habits and developing
good ones? The motivators you believe in are the ones that will work for you.
For example, if you believe that eating a low-calorie diet is an essential part of
a healthy lifestyle, and you want to be healthy, then good health is a motiva-
tor that works for you. When you’re tempted to eat that second piece of cake,
you can remind yourself that eating double helpings of dessert isn’t a healthy
habit because the fat in that cake may raise your cholesterol levels. Or if
you’re driven by a desire to look your best, you can remind yourself that
double helpings of dessert end up as double helpings of fat on your thighs.
Loosening up
Yes, following a low-calorie diet takes a good deal of determination and self-
discipline, especially if you have a great deal of weight to lose and plan to
stay on your diet for some time to come. You have to be strict about the
amount of food you eat, and willing to follow a new set of lifestyle rules.

69
Chapter 4: Kick-Starting Your Low-Calorie Plan
But at the same time, changing your thinking, eating, and exercise patterns
takes flexibility and open mindedness. Be open to new ideas. After all, what-
ever you’ve been doing up until now hasn’t been working for you, so clearly
you need to try something new.
You can help yourself adjust to the idea of change by challenging yourself in
small, nonthreatening ways. For instance, if you normally eat the same break-
fast every day, try something new, just for one morning. (You can find plenty
of ideas in Chapters 6 and 12.) Think of ways you can be open-minded that
have nothing to do with food, too. Buy a shirt in a color you don’t normally
wear but that you think looks good on you and wear it. One of the things
you’re teaching yourself with these types of challenges is that you can sur-
vive change, and you may even enjoy it. After you open up your mind to
these smaller, temporary changes, you may feel more confident approaching
the larger lifestyle changes with a low-calorie lifestyle.
Staying positive
With the right attitude, your chances of succeeding, sticking to your plan,
and losing weight greatly increase. A negative attitude, on the other hand,
only prevents you from pushing on and moving forward in your new lifestyle.
If you have trouble replacing negative thoughts with positive thoughts, the
section “Thinking mindfully,” later in this chapter, can help.
Are you ready? If all or most of the following statements are true for you, then
what are you waiting for? Start managing your weight today.
 I can make a commitment to myself to follow through on my diet, no
matter what else is going on in my life.
 I can make the necessary changes in my diet and exercise program.
 I can spend time at the beginning of each week planning my meals and
exercise routine for that week.
 I can continue to find ways to stay motivated until I reach my goal
weight.
 I can assess my plan from time to time to make sure it’s still working 
for me.
 I can figure out how to accept lapses and setbacks as opportunities to
come up with new goals and strategies, not to use them as excuses for
giving up.
Any “false” answers point out the areas that need special attention. To work
on those areas, use the goal-setting tools in the next section.

Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 
Using Tracking Tools As You Get Started
One benefit of using a self-help weight-loss method like the plan in this book
is that you have plenty of flexibility within the plan, and you don’t have to
answer to a nutritionist, a group leader, or a weight-loss counselor. But
because you’re going it alone, you have to do a little more thinking for your-
self. You have to set yourself up on a personalized program and to do that,
you need to use the same tools any professional would use to set that plan
up for you. These tools include goal setting, journaling with a food diary, and
keeping track of your weight.
You don’t have to use every tool in the book or answer every question in
every quiz, but the more you discover about yourself and your eating habits,
the better your chances of developing a plan that works for you.
Establishing your weight goals
The amount of weight you want to lose, the lifestyle changes you’re willing to
make to help you lose it, and all the little steps you’ll take along the way
make up your long-term, intermediate-term, and short-term goals. (Before
you settle on your goals, you can use the formulas in Chapter 2 to figure out
how much weight you want to lose.)
 Long-term goals: Your first long-term goal is the total amount of weight
you want to lose, or, if you prefer to put it another way, the final weight
you want to reach. Your primary long-term goal may also be a normal
Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a measure of weight for height that
may be a little more accurate than most standard weight charts. (Flip to
Chapter 2 for more about BMI.)
 Intermediate goals: These goals are the ones that you establish and
change along the way. Right now, one of your intermediate goals may be
the weight you hope to be when you’re halfway to your long-term goal.
For example, if you want to lose 60 pounds by this time next year (a very
reasonable long-term goal for someone with 60 pounds to lose at the rec-
ommended rate of 1 to 2 pounds a week), then two of your intermediate
goals may be to lose 15 pounds in the next three months and 30 pounds
six months from now.
Unless your weight seriously compromises your health, for example if
your BMI is 30 or higher or if your doctor has told you that you’re already
at risk for developing obesity-related medical problems, your goal needs
to be gradual weight loss, which means losing 1 to 2 pounds a week. If
your weight is putting you at immediate risk of health complications, you
may want to consider faster weight loss in a medically supervised pro-
gram. Speak to your doctor about your health risk and to find out what

71
Chapter 4: Kick-Starting Your Low-Calorie Plan
type of weight-loss program is right for you. (See Chapter 11 for more on
medically supervised programs.)
 Short-term goals: These goals are immediate goals you focus on from
day to day. For example, you can set a goal to lose 11⁄2 pounds this week.
Establishing mini-short-term goals to help you reach your short-term goal
and to satisfy any need you may have to do something about your weight
right now is a good idea. For instance, deciding to eat steamed fish for
dinner tonight is a mini-short-term goal that can help lead to your 11⁄2
pound weight loss goal for the week. Another mini-short-term goal may
be to buy a pocket-size calorie count book today, make copies of the calo-
rie counter pages in Appendix A and Appendix B, or locate calorie-count
information on the Internet so you have it available wherever you are.
Setting up your lifestyle goals
In addition to your weight goals (see the previous section), several other
types of goals are essential to the long-term success of a low-calorie lifestyle
plan. They include your
 Food goals: These goals are the changes you want to make to your diet,
such as how much you eat, the types of food you choose to eat, and the
amount of calories you consume.
• Your long-term food goal is to make a low-calorie diet plan part of
your permanent lifestyle.
• Your intermediate-term food goal may include preparing and eating
more low-cal meals at home.
• In keeping with these far-reaching goals, one of your short-term
food goals may be preparing a low-calorie dinner tonight. (See
Chapter 14 for several ideas.)
 Behavioral goals: When your long-term goals include eating better and
permanent weight loss, behavior modifications are necessary for those
goals to become permanent changes.
• Your long-term behavioral goal may be to eat mindfully, that is, pay
more attention to what and how you eat (see “Eating mindfully,”
later in this chapter for details).
• One intermediate-term goal may be to take your time and eat
slowly.
• A short-term behavioral goal toward that end may be to start prac-
ticing putting your fork down between bites at your next meal.
See “Giving Yourself a Lifestyle Makeover,” earlier in this chapter for
more about changing your overall eating habits.

72
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 
 Psychological goals: If you’re going to change the way you eat forever,
you probably have to change your emotional relationship with food.
• Your long-term psychological goal may be to avoid emotional
eating and overeating, the type of eating you do when you’re sad,
angry, or lonely.
• Your intermediate-term goal may be to find something else to do
other than eat when you’re not happy or to seek professional help
to make changes you can’t make alone.
• Your short-term goal may be to dig out those knitting needles,
paintbrushes, or toolbox, and get to work right away on a new pro-
ject that can keep your hands busy tonight.
See Chapter 9 for more about adjusting your mindset.
 Exercise goals: If you’re going to supplement your low-calorie diet with
increased activity, exercise goals can help you pace yourself.
• Your long-term goal may be to swim 15 laps at least four times a
week.
• Your intermediate-term goal may be rearranging your schedule so
that you have time to add that much swimming to your exercise
routine.
• Your short-term goal may be joining a gym that has a pool or to
start using the pool at the gym you already attend.
See Chapter 8 for advice about how to work more physical activity into
your daily life.
When setting your goals, keep these two important points in mind:
 Make sure your goals are realistic. You want to be able to complete
your goals within the timeframe you give yourself. For example, if you
say you’re going to cook a low-cal dinner tonight, be sure you have the
ingredients on hand when you get home. If you find that any goal is unre-
alistic, don’t stress out. Redefine the goal.
 Make sure your goals are as specific as possible. The clearer your goals,
the easier it is to measure your progress along the way. For example, you
don’t just want to be thinner; you want to lose 60 pounds. You don’t want
to simply cut back on the number of calories you consume; you want to
stick to a 1,200-calorie plan.
Putting your goals in writing can help you clarify them. Make a goal organizer,
something like the one in Figure 4-1, to jot down your long-term, intermediate-
term, and short-term goals in each lifestyle category.

73
Chapter 4: Kick-Starting Your Low-Calorie Plan
These pointers can help you use your organizer to its fullest potential:
 Separate your goals into food, behavioral, psychological, and exercise
categories. Write down any steps you can think of, big or little, that you
can take to reach that goal.
You can write down as many goals as you want, but remember, you don’t
have to work on them all right now! Your goals reflect the changes
you’re going to make over the next few days, weeks, months, and, in
some cases, years.
 As you reach each goal, write down the date. Doing so helps moti-
vate you when you look back over your goals and see what you’ve
accomplished.

 Review your goals weekly to remind yourself which areas still need
work. As you reach your current goals, you may want to establish new
ones and write them down in your goal organizer.
Keeping a food diary
Whenever I counsel new clients, I ask them to keep a food diary (a record of
all the food they eat) for at least three days before their first appointment. 
At this point, I’m asking you to do the same. Your food diary doesn’t have to
include three consecutive days, but it needs to cover three days that hon-
estly represent the way you eat. I usually suggest documenting at least two
weekdays (workdays) and one weekend day (one day off).
Most people think they eat less food than they actually do, and if that’s the
case, the number of calories that shows up when they start keeping track sur-
prises them. They also think they eat less fat, sugar, and salt than they actu-
ally do. A food diary is such an important tool because it helps you see all this
information. In the following sections, I show you how to keep a food diary
and what you can find from the information you gather from having one.
If you start your food diary before you start your diet, you’ll use it to assess
your current eating habits and figure out where you have room for improve-
ment. At the end of the day, when you look at your diary, you’ll have most of
the information you need to set behavior goals, reshape your diet, refigure
your calorie allowance, and keep track of your progress.
How to keep a food diary
You have several ways to keep a food diary, and how you do it depends on
how much you enjoy documenting your own life and how much time you can
devote to record keeping. When you’re busy, a food diary can be as simple as
a scrap of paper on which you write down everything you eat and how much
of it you eat. You can carry a piece of paper in your wallet for each day you
maintain a record.
A better way, however, is to buy a special pad or notebook and fill it with as
much information as you can about what, when, why, and how you eat. The
more time you spend documenting and reviewing your diet now, the more
you can discover about yourself and your diet and the less necessary it will
be to write it all down as time goes on.
Each page in a proper food diary has a minimum of five columns. (See Figure
4-2 for an example.) Write the day and date at the top of the page. Then fill in
your diary entries every time you eat, as soon as you eat, whether it’s a full,
sit-down meal or a snack. (You can fill in the actual calorie counts at the end
of the day or whenever you find time.)

75
Chapter 4: Kick-Starting Your Low-Calorie Plan
If you wait until the end of the day and try to remember what you ate, you
may not remember everything from every meal or snack. You may forget
about food you ate on the run.
The following list details the five columns in a food diary and explains what
you need to record.
 The first column is for the time. Here you write down the time you
started eating.
 The second column is for listing the food you eat, as specifically as
possible. Don’t forget to include drinks. You can even include water and
other noncaloric drinks so you can get a sense of how much fluid you
drink each day. Try to separate the components of foods. For example,
instead of cheese sandwich, enter whole-wheat bread, cheddar cheese,
tomato, and mustard. Doing so makes it easier for you to figure out the
calorie counts on some foods.
 The third column is for guesstimating the amount of food you ate.
Write down the size, quantity, volume, or weight of each food you listed
in the previous column. Using your cheese sandwich as an example, you
may put 2 slices next to the bread, 2 ounces next to the cheese, 4 thin
slices next to the tomato, and 1 tablespoon next to the mustard. You can
refer to Chapter 3 for help figuring out the portion sizes of different
types of foods.

columns of

information.

76
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 
 The fourth column is for approximating the number of calories pro-
vided by those foods. Obviously, the more you know about weights,
measures, and calorie counts, the more accurate you can be with this
information. Appendixes A and B are full of calorie count info.
 In the fifth column, write your reason for eating and any other rele-
vant information such as whom you ate with and how you were feeling
when you ate. For example, if you’re eating simply because it’s lunchtime
and you’re hungry, then you can just put “hungry” or “lunchtime” in the
reason column, or nothing at all. But if you’re eating because you don’t
want to offend your grandmother or because you’re angry with your boss,
then noting the reason why you ate is important so that you can work on
finding other ways to deal with emotional situations. (Chapter 9 covers
these types of “trigger” situations and provides suggestions for how to
deal with them.)
While you’re keeping an initial food diary:
 Eat normally; that is, eat what you ordinarily eat throughout the day.
Don’t try to make changes in your diet or eating habits while you’re
keeping your initial food diary. At this point, you’re simply assessing
your current eating habits and food preferences, many of which can be
incorporated into your new low-calorie plan and can actually help make
the new plan work better for you. For example, if you love chocolate,
don’t avoid it. Write it down, and later on you can figure out how to
enjoy chocolate without sabotaging your diet.
 Write down everything you eat. This point is important both for calcu-
lating your total calorie intake and for helping to determine how you can
better balance your diet in the future.
 Put as much information in your diary as you can. The more you dis-
cover about your food habits, the better you can help yourself devise a
low-cal plan that’s sure to work for you.
The beauty of having a formal food diary is that, in addition to the five basic
columns, you can use the same book in which you list your foods to also
record your goals, your progress, your exercise log (see Chapter 8 for details),
tips and advice you collect, and all your thoughts and feelings about every-
thing you’re doing to lose weight and get to a healthier state of mind and
body. You can divide your book into different sections for each of these areas
or let some of them overlap. For instance, you can create a separate section in
the back of your book for your thoughts about the weight-loss process, or you
can write your thoughts in the margins on the same page where you record
your goals or your exercise progress. Get used to writing in your diary every
day. Eventually you’ll stop writing down every bit of food you eat and every
mile you log on the treadmill, but until you meet your weight-loss goals, you’re
sure to have something to add to your journal. For now and for the future, you
have all your personal weight control material in one place.

77
Chapter 4: Kick-Starting Your Low-Calorie Plan
What your food diary tells you
When you examine your food diary, look for patterns. You’ll discover that you
have specific food habits, some good, and some not so good. Answering the
following questions allows you to see your eating patterns more clearly and
helps you focus on those areas that need improvement.
 Are you actually hungry when you eat?
 Do you eat too often?
 Do you eat too much?
 Do you skip meals?
 Are you an emotional eater?
 Do you eat a balanced diet?
 Do you routinely snack?
 Do you sit down to regular meals?
 Do certain situations trigger you to eat when you’re not actually hungry?
 Do you undereat earlier in the day and overeat later on?
 Do you choose too many high-calorie or high-fat foods?
 Do you overeat from one particular food group?
Keep a food diary for as long as you find it helpful. Some people keep a food
diary for weeks, or even months, using it to monitor themselves every day.
Eating less is easier when you’re writing down and are aware of every bite. If
keeping the food diary becomes problematic, put it down for a while. Don’t
throw it away; just put it away until you feel like using it again. You may never
write in it again, but you may want to look at it from time to time and use it
for motivation or as a reminder of how far you’ve come.
Weighing in on a regular basis
Most people who are concerned about their weight own a bathroom scale.
Weighing in is one way of monitoring yourself and assessing your progress. It
can also be a good motivating tool, giving you the push you need to work a
little harder on your goal, as long as you don’t become a slave to your scale.
The following sections tell you when to weigh yourself and how to maintain a
weight-change chart.
Knowing when to weigh yourself
A scale is a useful tool for tracking weight changes and documenting
progress. Weighing yourself allows you to keep a record of how far you’ve
come and how far you have to go to reach your goals.

78
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 
When you weigh yourself, remember that your weight can fluctuate up to sev-
eral pounds for any number of reasons, including hormonal changes, a rise or
dip in your level of body fluids, and the type of food and drinks you con-
sumed that day. These weight fluctuations have nothing to do with your true
weight. For that reason
 Weigh yourself no more than once a week.
The numbers on a scale generally don’t lie, but they may not always be an
accurate reflection of your true body weight. Don’t be alarmed if the num-
bers move up or down in inexplicable ways. A certain amount of weight
fluctuation is normal from week to week or day to day, even from hour to
hour, which is why you don’t want to weight yourself too frequently.
 Always weigh yourself on the same day of the week, at the same time of
day. Morning is probably best for motivation, because you haven’t eaten
yet and weigh less than you will at any other time of day.
 Weigh yourself when you’re naked and dry. You could add up to several
pounds of false weight from clothing or wet hair.
Filling in a weight-change chart
A weight-change chart (see Figure 4-3) graphs your weight loss (or gain) from
week to week so you can monitor your diet and exercise changes and be sure
they’re working for you.
You may also begin to see a pattern of slight weight gain from time to time,
and you’ll also be able to see that this weight gain levels out again after such
periods. When you see the repetitive pattern on paper, you’ll be better able
to accept these fluctuations as naturally occurring events and trust that they
have nothing to do with real weight.
Use the following steps when using your weight-change chart (shown in
Figure 4-3):
1. Begin by filling in your current weight (starting weight), in the space
provided, a few lines down from the top of the chart.
2. One week from now, weigh yourself.
Go to week number 1 at the top of the graph.
3. If you’ve lost weight, move down the graph until you reach the row
for the number that represents your weight change for this first week.
Put an X in the appropriate column.
For example, if you lose 2 pounds, stop at the –2 row and put an X in the
Week 1 column.
4. If you gain weight, move up the graph until you reach the row for the
number that represents the number of pounds you gained.

79
Chapter 4: Kick-Starting Your Low-Calorie Plan
5. If you gain or lose a half pound, draw a diagonal line through the
center of the appropriate box.
6. Repeat each week, graphing the total number of pounds you’ve lost
since Week 1 or since the last time you gained weight.
If you continue to gain, graph the total number of pounds you’ve gained
since you stopped losing weight. If you don’t gain or lose any weight
during a given week, check the 0 row for that week.
For example, if you lost 2 pounds during Week 1 and 2 more pounds
during Week 2, mark the –4 row in the Week 2 column. If you gain 1 pound
the following week, mark the +1 row in the Week 3 column. If you lose 2
pounds the following week, mark the –2 row again in the Week 4 column.
(But if you gain another pound during Week 4, mark the +2 column in
Week 4.) Continue this way for several months to see if your weight fluctu-
ations have a pattern. What you may find is that you lose weight steadily
for a period of time, only to gain a pound or two whenever your normal
schedule is interrupted or when you experience hormonal changes.
If you’re really into graphing, use dots instead of X’s, and connect the
dots for a more graphic representation of your weight fluctuations. Note:
This chart doesn’t graph your actual weight or your total weight loss,
only the number of pounds you lose (or gain) each week and how your
weight sometimes fluctuates.

Practicing Mindful Low-Calorie Living
If you’re a Buddhist or you’re familiar with Buddhist philosophy, then you
already have some idea about what it means to live mindfully. If you’re not
familiar with mindful living, that’s okay. You don’t have to join a monastery to
understand the concept. Mindful living simply means paying attention to
what’s going on in your life right now, in this moment. That’s a no-brainer,
right? What’s difficult for many people, however, is the actual practice of
mindfulness. For most people, it’s a practice that takes practice.
Mindful living incorporates many useful guidelines for low-calorie living. Some
of these guidelines deal directly with eating behavior and provide practical tips
for changing that behavior, and others help with the psychological aspects of
overeating, such as changing your thinking patterns to help ensure success.
Eating mindfully
Mindful eating is all about being aware of what and how you eat. It means
thinking about your food and paying attention to your eating habits. It’s the
opposite of mindless eating, which is actually easier because it requires no
thought whatsoever.
Eating mindfully prevents you from eating too much food at one sitting 
or putting food into your mouth all day long without even realizing that
you’re eating. Perhaps the best thing about mindful eating is that it has no
negative after-effects and no guilt involved. You can’t say the same about
eating mindlessly!
Here are the basic steps of mindful eating to follow every time you eat:
1. Pay attention to the way you prepare your food.
2. Prepare your food carefully and thoughtfully.
3. Prepare your dining table with care and attention.
4. Pay attention to the amount of food you put on your plate.
5. Relax as you sit down to eat.
6. Look at your food, smell it, be aware of it as you eat.
7. Eat slowly.
8. Avoid interruptions and stressful conversations while you eat.
9. Pay attention to your body’s hunger level as you eat.
10. Eat no more than you need to eat to feel satisfied.
11. Spend a quiet minute or two reflecting on your meal when you’ve 
finished eating.

81
Chapter 4: Kick-Starting Your Low-Calorie Plan
Thinking mindfully
How often have you said to yourself, “I’m too fat” or “I hate my thighs” or
even “I’ll never be able to stop eating”? Mindful thinking encourages you to
pay attention to this type of negative “self-talk” and the effect it has on your
self-esteem and motivation.
When you think mindfully, you catch yourself in negative self-talk and allow
yourself a moment to change it to something positive. Mindful thinking
allows you to listen to your own brain chatter and ultimately replace negative
and destructive thoughts with something more affirming.
Self-supporting statements such as “I am loving and capable” are called 
affirmations. They’re nothing more than soft and fluffy thoughts that are help-
ful for giving yourself a lift and keeping yourself motivated when the dieting
gets tough. If you’re not in the habit of using affirmations, you may want to
come up with a few affirmations that have meaning for you and start using
them to replace the harsher thoughts you sometimes have about yourself.
For instance, if you’re ready to give up before you even begin your diet, you
may say to yourself, “There’s no point; I’m never going to lose weight.” Because
that type of thinking doesn’t help, having an opposing affirmation handy, per-
haps one that says “I’m not giving in to failure,” or at least, “I’m going to give
this my best shot,” can be beneficial.
Some people think affirmations are silly and are completely turned off by
them. If you’re one of those people, try to suspend your judgment and prac-
tice using affirmations in your daily life. See if they help bring you back to a
positive frame of mind when you’re slipping into negative waters. See if they
help you maintain a better outlook throughout the day. You may not always
feel on top of your world, but at the very least you may be able to muster 
up something like, “I’ve had worse days” when you hit a roadblock and are
tempted to give up.
Whether you’re looking in the mirror or searching your soul, focus on your
best personal traits and on your successes, not on your failures. Use the fol-
lowing affirmations to replace negative thoughts in a variety of situations.
Instead of:
You Can Say:
I’m going to be fat forever.
It took a while to get here; it’ll take a
while to get back.
I hate my body.
My body’s getting healthier every day.
I’m starving.
I’m looking forward to eating healthier
foods.
This diet is too hard.
Just wait. Good things take time.
It’s going too slow.
If I’m patient, I’ll be successful. I can wait
as long as it takes.

Instead of:
You Can Say:
I’m going to buy a candy bar.
I’m strong enough to say “no” this time.
I feel sick all the time.
I’m getting stronger and healthier every
day.
I’m so ashamed of the way I look.
I’m so proud of myself for setting weight
goals.
I can’t do this.
I can’t wait to see the new me.
I’m going to fail again.
Every day is a new beginning.
Come up with some affirmations that work for you. Write them down and
carry them with you wherever you go until you get in the habit of speaking to
yourself in a more positive tone. Affirmations are especially useful in situa-
tions that trigger overeating. When you face a trigger situation, you encounter
a choice (to eat or not to eat in response to the situation). The decision you
make at that moment is crucial to the success of your day. Those deciding
moments are also crucial to the success of your diet.

Cooking in a Low-Calorie Kitchen
In This Chapter
 Preparing low-cal foods according to new guidelines
 Making the best choices at the supermarket
 Equipping your kitchen and considering low-cal cooking techniques
I
n the practical arena of your kitchen, the foods you buy and the tech-
niques you use to prepare them bring your low-calorie diet to life. You
make some of the most important decisions affecting the success of your diet
from day to day in your kitchen.
Following a healthful low-calorie diet starts with your food choices, but it
doesn’t end there. At home, you also have to make choices about how you’re
going to prepare your food and which utensils and cooking techniques to
use. At its best, low-calorie eating means eating simple foods that don’t
require much fuss and bother.
This chapter helps you buy and prepare the best food for your low-calorie
diet. You discover a little bit about stocking your kitchen with low-calorie
cooking tools and appliances, many of which you probably already own.
Finally, I explain how to utilize the best cooking techniques for your new 
low-calorie lifestyle.
Gearing Up for Low-Calorie Meals
Combined with the general basics of good nutrition found in Chapter 3, this
section can help you decide exactly which foods you want (and don’t want)
to keep in your low-calorie kitchen. Don’t forget that the object of this low-
calorie diet is not only to help you lose weight but also to show you how to
eat better. I want you to come away from this plan leaner, healthier, and much
more knowledgeable about living a lower-calorie lifestyle.

In the following sections, I tell you how to incorporate the latest dietary
guidelines into your diet, compare different types of foods you can eat, and
explain the importance of making a shopping list so that you can stick to
your food selections.
Following dietary guidelines
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently updated its dietary
guidelines and released them in early 2005. For the first time ever, the guide-
lines include the specific recommendation that overweight people gradually
reduce their calorie intake and increase their physical activity for slow and
steady weight loss.
In addition to eating fewer calories and becoming more active, the new guide-
lines say that most Americans can benefit from making smarter food choices
and balancing their daily diets to include an average of the following:
 2 cups of fruit
 21⁄2 cups of vegetables
 3 or more 1-ounce servings of whole-grain products
 3 cups a day of fat-free or lowfat milk or the equivalent in dairy products
such as cheese and yogurt
Note: Dairy alternatives such as soy and rice beverages and products
made from these beverages can take the place of milk and milk-based
foods in a healthy diet if they’re enriched with nutrients such as calcium,
vitamin D, and B vitamins normally supplied by dairy foods.
The amounts of food in the previous bulleted list are recommended on a stan-
dard 2,000-calorie diet, which government nutritionists generally use as a 
reference point. On a low-calorie diet plan, you may or may not meet these
recommendations every day, and aiming for a little less in each category is
okay. What’s most important is that you recognize that variety and balance
are essential to the long-term success of a low-calorie diet and that these
foods play essential roles in your long-term health. (See Chapter 3 for details
on the importance of balance and variety in a low-calorie diet.)
Other recommendations in the guidelines that are more general but still very
important to low-calorie dieters include
 Vary your protein choices with more fish, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds.
Meat isn’t your only choice for good sources of protein. Replacing some
of the meat in your diet with seafood and non-meat sources of protein
reduces fat and adds fiber and other nutrients not found in meat.
84
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

 When selecting meat, poultry, dry beans, and milk or milk products,
make choices that are lean, lowfat, or fat-free. Most meat and dairy
products that are lower in fat are also lower in calories than their higher-
fat counterparts.
 Choose fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, and whole grains as often as pos-
sible. When you buy rice, pasta, breads, and cereals, check and compare
the fiber content listed under “Total Carbohydrate” on the Nutrition
Facts labels. (You can find more information about fiber and how much
you need in Chapter 3 and more on the Nutrition Facts label in the
“Reading the labels” section, later in this chapter.)
 Get the most nutrition out of the calories you consume. If you use your
calories on a few high-calorie foods instead of dividing your calories
among a variety of lower-calorie foods, you probably won’t be getting
many of the nutrients your body needs to stay healthy.
You can read more about the USDA’s dietary guidelines and pyramid eating
plan on its interactive Web site at www.mypyramid.gov. This site shows you
how to personalize the general recommendations for eating well and balancing
your diet. The site also gives suggestions for incorporating more exercise into
your daily routine as a way of cutting calories.
Because the dietary guidelines now recommend that overweight people lose
weight, they also say if you have a chronic medical condition or if you regu-
larly take medication, you need to consult your physician before embarking
on any weight-loss program.
Deciding which foods to eat
When you change your way of eating, especially when you’re cutting calories
to lose weight, you have many food choices to make. Do you prefer to cut
calories by eating low-calorie and calorie-free food products? Do you want to
continue eating the same way you’ve been eating, knowing that you have to
limit the amount of some of your favorite foods? Maybe you can reach a com-
promise and decide to do a little of both. For instance, you may decide that
you don’t want to eat the calorie-controlled entrees available in your super-
market’s freezer section in favor of “real foods,” but you do want to save 
calories by using artificial sweetener in your coffee.
In the following sections, I explain the use of calorie-modified and full-calorie
foods in a low-calorie diet, and the advantages and disadvantages of using
each kind.
Faking it with commercial diet products
Many weight-loss programs and food companies sell packaged, calorie-
controlled and nutritionally enhanced food products such as shake mixes,
frozen and shelf-stable entrees, light salad dressings, and calorie-free 
85
Chapter 5: Cooking in a Low-Calorie Kitchen

sweeteners (see the nearby “Substituting artificial sweeteners to reduce calo-
ries” sidebar) to help dieters stick to a low-calorie plan by providing both 
convenience and structure. Many of the modified foods and meal replacement
beverages available in supermarkets and health food stores come with a 
calorie-controlled diet plan of their own.
Often, you have few decisions to make when you use these products because
they have been packaged to fit into a prescribed plan similar to the menu
plans in Chapter 6. Having fewer decisions certainly simplifies everything
because if you decide to use these products, you can interchange them with
the menu plans in this book.
Even if you decide to use modified foods in your diet plan, make sure one of
your long-term goals is to return to real food. Most meal-replacement products
sold in supermarkets and drugstores and through commercial diet programs
are fine for the short term if they help you stick to a calorie-controlled plan.
On their own, however, they’re generally not considered long-term solutions
for weight control because they’re not natural foods and they don’t contain all
the nutritional substances found in natural foods. Keep in mind that your
body is naturally designed to digest and absorb whole foods, not pills and
potions (unless you’re sick). Just as multivitamin pills and other nutritional
supplements can help fill nutritional gaps in your diet, meal replacements and
other specialized food products can do the same and also help provide struc-
ture and convenience. And yes, you can get away with taking some supple-
ments and using some modified food products in your diet for an unlimited
period of time. But most health experts agree neither should be considered a
complete or permanent replacement for real food (see the next section).
Keeping it real with natural foods
If you’re a purist with your food, you’re probably not interested in diet foods,
such as the calorie-controlled frozen entrees, meal-replacement shakes, artifi-
cial sweeteners, and other nutritionally modified food products that many
people use to control calories.
If you choose to go the “real foods” route, and eat more natural foods, you’ll
find plenty of options for creating simple meals in the menu plans in Chapter 6
and the recipes in Chapters 12 through 15. Inevitably, it takes more time to pre-
pare your own meals than it does to simply pop open a can or stick a frozen
entree in the microwave oven. But when your low-calorie diet consists of
mostly natural foods, you’ve got a head start on the road back to normal eating.
Keeping a good supply of basic, healthful convenience foods in your pantry
can help ensure that you have the makings of a quick, low-calorie meal on
hand at all times and perhaps prevent you from eating or overeating less nutri-
tious or more fattening foods. In “Browsing the grocery shelves,” later in this
chapter, you can find a list of suggested packaged foods to have for preparing
“real” and simple everyday meals, along with any specialized low-calorie
meals you may keep in your freezer for everyday use or “emergencies.”
86
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Making a list and sticking to it
This section is especially important for those of you who can’t eat just one
of anything. You need to stick very closely to the food shopping list that you
create from the menu plans you’re using on your diet so that you don’t have
any extra or “forbidden” food in the house that may tempt you to overeat
(see Chapter 6 for more on menu planning). In addition to your weekly list of
menus, maintain a written running list as you start to run low on any staples
you normally keep in your cupboard and fridge, such as flour and other
baking goods, canned soups and sauces, milk, and eggs.
Try to keep your supermarket shopping trips down to once or perhaps twice
a week. The less you shop for food, the less opportunity you have to buy
impulse and indulgence items, such as snack and dessert foods or anything
extra you may be tempted to buy simply because it’s on sale. Keep a list on
your refrigerator door or anywhere in the kitchen that’s handy so you can jot
down items you need whenever you think of them.
87
Chapter 5: Cooking in a Low-Calorie Kitchen
Substituting artificial sweeteners 
to reduce calories
If you have an uncontrollable sweet tooth, another
way to keep the calories down in your diet is to
use sugar substitutes. Artificial, or non-nutritive,
sweeteners that have been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for sale in the
United States include (in order of sweetness):
 Saccharin (sold as Sweet’N Low, Sweet
Twin, Sweet’N Low Brown, Necta Sweet) is
200 to 700 times sweeter than white table
sugar and doesn’t lose its sweetening power
when heated.
 Sucralose (sold as Splenda) is 600 times
sweeter than white table sugar. It can be
used in cooking and baking because heat-
ing doesn’t reduce its sweetening power.
 Aspartame (sold as NutraSweet, Equal,
Sugar Twin) is considered 160 to 220 times as
sweet as white table sugar. Aspartame can’t
be used in cooking and baking because it
loses its sweetening power when heated.
 Acesulfame-K (sold as Sunett, Sweet &
Safe, Sweet One) is considered 200 times
sweeter than white table sugar, and it can
be used in cooking because it doesn’t lose
its sweetening power when heated.
Other FDA-approved, non-nutritive sweeteners
that aren’t commonly available for everyday use
by consumers but that may be used by food
manufacturers to sweeten soft drinks and other
beverages, dairy products, frozen desserts,
baked goods, candies, chewing gum, and other
food products include sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol,
mannitol, lactitol, isomalt, and neotame. You
may see some of these products listed on the
labels of any low-sugar, no-sugar-added, and
artificially sweetened products you buy in the
supermarket. For more about artificial sweet-
eners, see Chapter 2.

To get in and out of the supermarket as quickly as possible, organize your
shopping list according to your supermarket’s aisles and overall layout. Start
with the aisle closest to the entrance and end with the last aisle you walk
down before heading for the checkout.
Shopping for Low-Calorie Foods
When you think about it, your diet really starts in the supermarket, where
you make your final decisions about which foods to buy and bring home.
Sure, you plan your menus and make up your shopping list at home, but in
the supermarket is where you decide whether or not to stick to your list,
choose substitutes, or maybe throw a few “extras” into your shopping cart
that aren’t even on your list. In the long run, these decisions can make or
break your diet.
Amidst the temptations that call out to you at every turn, your supermarket’s
aisles are actually stocked with more products and tools that can help you
stick to your diet than with those that help sabotage it. Use just a few of
these helpful tips on your next supermarket trip:
 Focus on the produce section: The produce section of some of the
larger supermarkets chains often takes up a large chunk of floor space
devoted to healthful food. You can’t go wrong in those aisles!
 Look for the label: Nutrition labels on every packaged food in the store
help you make smart decisions when you’re comparing similar foods.
88
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 
Earning your favorite treats the low-calorie way
Can’t imagine life without ice cream? If not, go
ahead and have some, but make sure you earn
it. For example, rather than putting ice cream
(or another favorite indulgence food) on your
shopping list (or sneaking it into your super-
market cart even though it’s not on your list),
make yourself leave home for it every time you
want it. And no, that doesn’t mean hopping in
the car and driving to the local dairy bar. Walk
or ride a bicycle to your ice cream source, and
then walk or ride home. This method has two
benefits:
 First, you’re getting some exercise that will
help burn off your indulgence calories.
 Secondly, you may be less inclined to eat
ice cream every night if you have to leave
the comfort of your home to get it.
If you must drive for the sake of safety or because
the store is just too far away, having to travel for
your treats is still better than keeping indulgence
foods around the house. You can still make up for
high-calorie treats by doing extra exercises
another time. Just be sure to impose an “exercise
for treats” rule on yourself and follow it!

 Search for helpful information: Very often, supermarkets display free
brochures and recipe cards loaded with helpful tips for buying and
preparing healthful foods.
In the following sections, I help you shop smart by reading labels and select-
ing great foods from every part of the supermarket.
Reading the labels
Food labels are a great source of helpful information to low-calorie dieters.
Labels tell you the amount of food you’re buying, how many servings are in
the package, how many calories are in a single serving, where the food comes
from, and which ingredients were used to prepare the food. The Nutrition Facts
box on the label provides a nutritional analysis of the food, and many labels
also clearly display a nutrition description, such as low-sugar, fat-free, or high-
fiber, to help you ferret out products that may be helpful on a low-calorie diet.
Deciphering descriptive lingo
The FDA standardized all the nutrition language on food labels, so you can
pick up a package of food and feel confident that what you see is what you
get. Table 5-1 defines some terms used on food labels:
Table 5-1
Claims on Food Labels
Label Lingo
Meaning
Calorie-free
Less than 5 calories per serving.
Reduced-calorie
At least 25 percent fewer calories per serving than a simi-
lar food.
Reduced-fat
At least 25 percent less fat per serving than a similar food.
Low-calorie
40 calories or less per serving.
Fat-free or 
Less than 0.5 gram fat per serving.
100 percent fat free
Sugar-free
Less than 0.5 gram sugar per serving.
Reduced-sugar
At least 25 percent less sugar per serving than a similar
food.
No added sugars
No sugar or ingredient that contains added sugar was
used in the preparation or processing of the product.
89
Chapter 5: Cooking in a Low-Calorie Kitchen

The words “fat-free,” “reduced-fat,” and “reduced-sugar” don’t necessarily
mean that a food product is low in calories. Many products that are modified
to reduce fat or sugar do indeed contain fewer calories than similar products
that haven’t been modified, but you have to check and compare the product
labels to be sure. Likewise, “no added sugar” doesn’t mean that a product con-
tains no sugar. Many foods contain natural sugars that will be accounted for
on the nutrition label (covered later in this chapter in the “Checking nutrition
facts” section). Look for these terms when you’re shopping for low-calorie
foods, but be sure to compare the actual nutrition information on similar
products so that you know you’re really getting what you want.
Scoping out the ingredients
All packaged foods that contain more than one ingredient have their ingredi-
ents listed on the label in descending order by weight. If the first or second
ingredient is sugar, sucrose, fructose, corn syrup, or high-fructose corn
syrup, then that food is high in sugar. If you try to avoid any type of food, for
any reason, the ingredient list is the first place you need to look when buying
convenience foods and other prepared products.
Checking nutrition facts
Just about every packaged food product in the supermarket displays a
Nutrition Facts label that you can use to check the number of calories and
amount of other nutrients found in a single serving. Some produce and other
fresh foods also carry Nutrition Facts labels, either on their skins, their pack-
aging, or on a nearby poster or flyer.
The Nutrition Facts label illustrated in Figure 5-1 is typical of what you’ll see
on most cans and packages of food in the supermarket and health food store.
Figure 5-1:

Facts label

Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

The categories on the label are
 Serving size: All the nutrition information contained on the label applies
to this amount of the food.
 Servings per container: If, for instance, the package or can contains 2
servings and you eat the entire contents, you must double the number
of calories and other nutrients listed.
 Calories: This number is the amount of calories in a single serving of
the food.
 Calories from fat: This amount tells you the number of calories in one
serving of this food that come from all fats. The closer this number is to
the total number of calories in a serving, the higher the food is in fat.
 Total fat: The total amount of all fats, in grams (g), in one serving of the
food is listed (along with saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium)
because many people need to limit these nutrients.
 Saturated fat: This is the amount of saturated fat, in grams, in one serv-
ing. The recommended daily limit for most healthy people is 20 grams.
 Cholesterol: This is the amount of cholesterol, in milligrams (mg), in one
serving. The recommended daily limit for healthy people is 300 mg or less.
 Sodium: This is the amount of sodium (salt), in milligrams, in one serv-
ing. The recommended daily limit for healthy people is 3,000 mg or less.
 Total carbohydrate: This is the total amount of all carbohydrates,
including sugar and starches, in grams, in one serving.
 Dietary fiber: The total amount of all fibers is listed, in grams, because
this nutrient is lacking in many people’s diets. Use this information to
compare similar products and choose those that are higher in fiber.
 Sugars: The total amount of all sugars, both added and natural, in grams,
is listed because many people consume too much sugar. Use this informa-
tion to compare similar products and choose those that are lower in sugar.
 Protein: This is the amount of total protein, in grams, in one serving of
the food.
The % Daily Value listed with some of the nutrients on the Nutrition Facts
label tells you how one serving of the food contributes to the average daily
requirement for that nutrient. The higher the percentage, the more that food
contributes to your daily requirement for that particular nutrient. Daily
Values are calculated on the basis of a 2,000-calorie diet for general use, but
no matter how many calories you consume, you can use them to get an idea
of whether a particular food is high or low in a specific nutrient.
Check and compare the calorie contents of prepared foods. When a single serv-
ing of any one food contains more than 400 calories, it’s a high-calorie food.
91
Chapter 5: Cooking in a Low-Calorie Kitchen

When you check the Nutrition Facts label, you can find out what you’re get-
ting in the way of nutrients for the number of calories you’re consuming. For
the best comparison, make sure you’re evaluating equal amounts of similar
foods. For instance, choose several different types of reduced-calorie or
“light” bread with similar calorie counts per slice and compare them to see
which loaf has the most fiber per slice. If you need more fiber in your diet,
and all other factors, such as calories, are essentially equal, the bread with
the most fiber is your best choice.
Going aisle by aisle
Even though you can find the freshest foods in the supermarket around the
store’s perimeter, on the produce shelves, and in the meat and dairy cases,
you can also find healthful, diet-friendly foods in every aisle. You just have to
know what to look for and where to find them.
Picking fresh fruits and vegetables
When shopping for fresh produce, buy fruits and vegetables when they’re in
season. Not only are seasonal fruits and vegetables less expensive, but they
also taste better. And if they taste good, you’ll be more inclined to eat more of
these highly nutritious and comparatively low-calorie foods, right?
Lucky for you, low-cal salad basics, such as lettuce, cucumber, radishes, sweet
peppers, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes, are tasty and available all year
around, as are broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, onions, and celery. You can usually
always find a pineapple or some variety of citrus fruit. The following short list
is a sampling of other fruits and vegetables arranged by peak season:
 Autumn/Winter: Apples, pears, tangerines, kumquats, beets, turnips,
cabbage, Brussels sprouts, spinach, fennel, winter squashes
 Spring: Asparagus, artichokes, peas, green beans, rhubarb
 Summer: Corn, tomatoes, okra, peaches, plums, nectarines, grapes,
melons, berries
Choosing lean meats and poultry
Leaner cuts of meat and poultry contain fewer calories than fattier cuts. When
shopping for meat and poultry, buy these following examples of lean cuts:
 Beef: Eye of round, top loin, sirloin, top round, tenderloin, chuck steak
or roast, any cut graded select.
 Chicken and turkey: Lighter meat from the breast area contains less fat
and fewer calories than darker meat from the thighs and legs.
 Lamb: Leg, loin, shoulder chop, foreshank.
 Pork: Tenderloin, top loin roast, center loin, loin rib chops, lean ham.
92
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Selecting seafood
When purchasing seafood, buy seafood that is absolutely fresh. Check out the
conditions in your supermarket’s fish department or at your local fishmonger.
All seafood needs to be displayed on ice in very clean refrigerated cases.
Fattier fish, such as bluefish, salmon, catfish, fresh tuna, swordfish, and fresh
water bass, are higher in calories than leaner fish, such as cod, flounder, pol-
lock, and orange roughy. Most shellfish are low in calories. In Table 5-2, you
can see how some common fresh fish and shellfish compare.

and Appendix B at the back of this book.
Recognizing the right dairy products
For the most part, lowfat means lower calories in the dairy department.
Check out Table 5-3 to see how many calories you can save by choosing
reduced-fat, lowfat, and fat-free milk products.

When choosing dairy products, remember that reduced-fat cheeses and
yogurts also contain fewer calories than similar products made from whole
milk. Remember to check the labels, however, because some reduced-fat dairy
products are sweetened and flavored with added ingredients and the calories
from added sugar may well make up for the calories that were lost with the fat.
Surveying freshly prepared foods
Thanks to the wide variety of ready-to-cook and ready-to-serve foods available
in the supermarket today, sticking to a low-cal diet in the most healthful way
possible has never been easier. You can buy peeled and cut-up vegetables
from the produce department to use in your own recipes or pack for lunch
and snacks, or buy premixed salads and complete entrees that require nothing
more than a reheating in the microwave oven when you get home.
When choosing prepared meals other than plain vegetable salads, select
packages that provide a nutritional breakdown per serving. Otherwise you
don’t know how many calories you’re getting or how much of that particular
food meets your low-calorie criteria for a single serving.
Opting for frozen foods
Buying and eating frozen foods has its pros and cons, but for the most part,
freezing is preferred over canned for nutritional value because the freezing
process destroys fewer nutrients. Frozen foods are often your best bet for
buying fruits and vegetables out of season.
Another reason to opt for frozen is convenience. Many calorie-controlled
foods are available in the freezer case that require nothing more than a whirl
in the microwave oven before eating. If that type of fast food helps keep you
away from the high-calorie variety, go for it!
When buying frozen foods, check and compare the labels on fish, poultry,
fruits, and vegetables before you buy, and, for the most part, stick to plain
foods to avoid added calories. Stay away from foods that are sauced, breaded,
or fried before freezing. You may find some exceptions in foods formulated to
be part of a healthy, lowfat, or reduced calorie diet plan, but again, check the
labels to ensure these foods fit your criteria for a low-calorie diet.
94
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Browsing the grocery shelves
Convenience foods — bottled, canned, and boxed food products — make
up the bulk of what you’ll find in most people’s shopping carts, and low-cal
dieters are no different. Just be sure you’re getting good nutrition along with
the convenience by being picky. Many convenience foods, such as canned
fruits and vegetables, lose some or all their nutritional value during process-
ing. They also tend to be high in sodium. Check the Nutrition Facts labels and
compare similar products to see what you’re actually getting in that can, box,
or bottle before you buy.
The following list contains some of the convenience foods I recommend
most often to anyone who is stocking a pantry for a low-calorie kitchen.
Many of these aren’t low-calorie foods, but if you’re familiar with appropriate
portion sizes, or if you use the menu plans in Chapter 6 as a guide to portion-
ing out your meals, these foods provide the makings for a quick, easy, low-
calorie meal.
 An assortment of dried herbs, spices, and seasoning blends
 Canned fish such as tuna, crab, sardines, and salmon packed in water
 Canned legumes (beans, lentils, and split peas)
 Canned soups
 Dry pasta and pasta mixes
 Fat-free beef broth
 Fat-free chicken broth
 Flavored vinegars
 Nonstick vegetable cooking spray
 Olive oil (plain and seasoned)
 Plain crackers such as saltines
 Rice and rice mixes
 Rice cakes
 Salsas, chutneys, and other lowfat condiments
 Small bread sticks
 Tomatoes, tomato sauces, tomato paste
 Unsweetened or lightly sweetened breakfast cereals
 Vegetable broth
95
Chapter 5: Cooking in a Low-Calorie Kitchen

Low-calorie foods tend to be plain and simple, so to keep them interesting, use
seasonings to spice them up. Table 5-4 shows you which fresh or dried herbs
and spices are best for brightening up the flavor of plainly cooked poultry,
seafood, meats, beans, and vegetable side dishes. Remember: Garlic and
onions go a long way toward flavoring most foods without adding a significant
number of calories, so don’t skimp!

Setting Up a Low-Calorie Kitchen
If one mantra applies to all aspects of low-calorie dieting, it’s “keep it simple.”
That statement certainly applies to the food you choose to eat and the tools
and techniques you use to prepare your food. The following sections focus
on the basic equipment you need in your kitchen and easy low-calorie cook-
ing methods.
96
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Using the tools of the trade
While on a low-calorie diet, you don’t need any extra or unnecessary cooking
equipment or kitchen gadgets. The following sections narrow everything
down to the relatively few “special” utensils and appliances that are actually
helpful to anyone who is on a low-calorie diet and wants to cook at home.
Selecting skillets, saucepans, and woks
The type and number of pots and pans you buy depends on your own per-
sonal cooking style. If you enjoy cooking and plan to prepare many of your
low-calorie meals at home, you may want to have a variety of skillets and
saucepans at your disposal.
The best pots and pans for a low-calorie kitchen are coated with a nonstick
finish that allows you to cook with little or no added fat. Beyond that, the
quality of skillets and saucepans you buy is your choice. Heavy-duty cook-
ware tends to be more expensive than lighter-weight pots and pans, but it
cooks food more evenly and lasts longer.
If you cook for a family of three or more, I suggest larger skillets that are 10,
12, or even 14 inches in diameter. You may also want to have at least one
smaller skillet (6 to 8 inches) on hand for making individual dishes such as
omelets and for general use when cooking smaller amounts of food.
Like skillets, saucepans come in many sizes, and if you cook, you need at
least one small (1-quart) and one large (3- to 4-quart) pan. In addition, a very
large (a least 5- to 8-quart) saucepot, or Dutch oven, is essential for cooking
pasta and large quantities of soups, stews, or vegetables.
In addition to your regular pots and pans, consider buying a wok. No single
piece of kitchenware is more versatile than a wok, especially if you cook in a
small kitchen where you can only benefit from having one good-size pot that
does several different jobs. A wok is used first and foremost for stir-frying
(see “Stir-frying” later in this chapter), and thanks to its size and shape, can
take the place of almost any size skillet in many different types of recipes. A
wok can also double as a steamer and, in fact, a complete wok set includes a
steaming rack. You can also braise or simmer foods in a wok, which means
you can also use it to make soups, stews, and saucy dishes.
Woks come in different sizes. The size you choose depends on the amount of
food you normally cook at one time. Woks are made of different materials.
The woks that work best are made from 14-gauge spun steel, anodized alu-
minum, or cast iron. Avoid stainless steel (unless it’s clad with aluminum)
because stainless steel poorly conducts heat, and stir-fried food sticks to the
bottom and sides of a stainless steel wok. Because woks cook food with a
minimal amount of fat, you don’t need a wok finished with nonstick coatings.
Actually the slippery surface prevents stir-fried foods from cooking properly.
97
Chapter 5: Cooking in a Low-Calorie Kitchen

Most wok sets come with a cover, a cooking ring to hold round-bottom woks,
and appropriate utensils such as a wire strainer, a ladle, and a wide spatula
that can pick up and move larger amounts of food around the wok at one
time better than a regular spatula or spoon. Expect to pay as much for a good
wok as you would for a good saucepot.
Finding one good knife
A knife is probably more important than any other piece of kitchen equipment
because you use it to slice, dice, and otherwise prepare food. A good knife
simplifies the work of preparing fresh food from scratch, which in turn can
help motivate you to make home-cooked, low-calorie meals on a regular basis.
If you can only afford one good knife, choose an 8- to 10-inch chef’s knife. With
knives, as with most everything else in life, you get what you pay for, so be pre-
pared to spend as much as $75 or more for a high-quality chef’s knife. If you
can afford two good knives, choose the chef’s knife and a small paring knife.
The best quality knives sold in department stores and culinary supply stores
are usually made from high-carbon, nonstaining steel. The blade needs to
extend into the full-length of the handle (known as a full-tang blade). Ask
to hold the knife before you buy it, to make sure it feels comfortable in
your hand.
After you own a good knife, it’ll last your lifetime if you take care of it prop-
erly. Wash your knife by hand and dry it immediately. Store it in its own
sheath, in a knife block, or on a mounted magnetic knife strip where it won’t
get banged around. Use a sharpening stone or electric sharpening machine to
keep a fine edge on your blades.
Gathering assorted utensils and bakeware
If you’re trying to figure out which basic utensils and bakeware you need in
your low-cal kitchen, start with this checklist:
❑Casserole-type baking dishes — round, square, and rectangular
❑Cutting boards
❑Dry measuring cups
❑Large colander
❑Liquid measuring cups
❑Measuring spoons
❑Mixing bowls — small, medium, and large
❑Nonstick bakeware — baking (cookie) sheets, 12-cup muffin pan, 9-inch
pie plate, 9-inch round cake pans, 8- or 9-inch square cake pan
❑Nonstick spatulas — flat and spoon-shaped
98
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

❑Nonstick or wooden whisks — small and large
❑Wooden spoons — various lengths
❑Wire mesh sieves (strainers) — small and large
If you never bake and never plan to, you don’t need much, if any, nonstick
bakeware, but certain standard baking items, such as cookie sheets, cake pans,
and pie plates, can come in handy for other types of cooking. For instance, if
you like to make pita pizzas or cheese nachos, you need a flat cookie sheet.
Likewise, you can use a cake pan or pie plate for roasting a small amount of
food, such as a single chicken breast on the bone or a pair of baked potatoes.
You can accessorize your kitchen with all types of extra gadgets, but only
buy what you’ll use on a regular basis. Otherwise, you’ll just end up with a
cluttered kitchen and an empty pocketbook. Use this checklist as a guide to
“extras” often found in a well-stocked low-cal kitchen:
 Cheese grater
 Citrus reamer
 Garlic press
 Large kitchen shears for cutting through poultry bones and other heavy-
duty clipping chores
 Pepper grinder
 Pizza wheel
 Salad spinner
 Small kitchen scissors for snipping herbs and a variety of other tasks
Choosing small appliances
If you watch any of the television home shopping shows, or peruse your local
department store’s ads, you can see how easy it could be to clutter up your
kitchen counters with all kinds of cooking gizmos and gadgets that are sup-
posed to save time and somehow make your life easier. The truth is, you
don’t need much when it comes to setting up a low-cal kitchen and you prob-
ably already own most of the small appliances that are most helpful.
Some helpful small appliances you may already have and may want to continue
using in your low-calorie kitchen include
 Blender: If you’re a fan of smoothies and shakes, keep your blender out
on the counter, rather than stored away in a cupboard.
If you’re not familiar with hand-held immersion blenders, check them
out next time you’re in a kitchenware department. You can use an
immersion blender to mix a smoothie right in the serving glass or to
puree a soup or sauce while it’s still in the saucepan. (You can find more
information about using immersion blenders in Chapter 12.)
99
Chapter 5: Cooking in a Low-Calorie Kitchen

 Food processor: A food processor is a must-have appliance for anyone
who likes to make homemade soups and sauces. If you cook in large
quantities, invest in a large processor. Small food processors are avail-
able if you cook your food in individual servings.
 Rice cooker: Perfectly cooked rice is always possible when you prepare
it in an electric rice cooker. If you eat rice often, this appliance is a
worthwhile investment.
Electric rice cookers and pasta pots or lobster pots with perforated
draining baskets can often double as steamers. If you own this type of
cookware, you probably don’t need a separate steamer. You can also
improvise your own steamer with kitchen items that you probably
already own. (See the next section for more on using a steamer.)
 Toaster oven: These tiny ovens can do anything a regular oven can do,
but only for small amounts of food. They’re perfect for cooking or heat-
ing up individual portions of food.
A toaster oven does more than toast; it bakes and broils small quantities
of food, which makes it a perfect appliance for any low-cal dieter who
is cooking for one (or two) and doesn’t want to heat up the regular oven.
Toaster ovens come in various sizes, and some feature two levels for
cooking larger quantities or more than one type of food at a time.
Two additional appliances that are extra handy in a low-calorie kitchen are a
steamer and a microwave oven. I give you the full scoop on both items in the
following sections.
Getting all steamed up
Because steaming is at the top of the list of good low-calorie cooking tech-
niques (see the “Steaming” section later in this chapter), you may want to get
serious about steaming equipment. Collapsible metal steamers that fit inside
most saucepans are inexpensive and easy to find. They’re best for foods that
can easily be removed from the pan with tongs or a fork.
If you’re going to get serious about steaming, your best bet is a Chinese-style,
stackable bamboo steamer. These multilayered steamers are very efficient
because they can cook more than one layer of food at a time so you can
steam your entire meal, entree, and side dishes, all at the same time, in the
same container.
Making the most of a microwave oven
Everyone knows that microwave ovens were born for reheating leftover food,
thawing and cooking frozen entrees, and warming up coffee that’s gone cold.
What you may not know is that a microwave oven is also a good weight-loss
tool because you can use it to cook fresh food with little or no added fat.
Microwave ovens are especially good at cooking vegetables. (You can find
100
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

cooking times for specific vegetables in “Cooking in a microwave oven,” later
in this chapter.) In fact, any food that can successfully be cooked in a
steamer, including fish and poultry, also does well in a microwave oven.
Use these guidelines and tips if you’re considering the purchase of a new
microwave oven:
 Most microwave recipes and cooking times in this book and elsewhere
are based on 600- or 700-watt full-size ovens set at 100 percent power.
Lower wattage ovens cook foods more slowly, and higher wattage ovens
cook foods more quickly.
 Some microwave ovens come with variable power levels. Most foods are
cooked at 100 percent power, but you may find that you use half (50 per-
cent) power or less for slower cooking, reheating, melting, and thawing.
 Microwave ovens often come with optional features such as turntables
that automatically rotate food for even cooking, moisture sensors for
detecting how much longer a food needs to cook, and one-button controls
for thawing, reheating beverages, and popping popcorn. When you’re
trying to choose between different oven styles, think about which features
you’re most likely to use.
Brushing up on low-calorie 
cooking techniques
Some cooking methods fit more easily into a low-calorie lifestyle than others,
and you probably know that deep-fat frying isn’t one of them! In general,
any method that doesn’t require adding fat to the pan, such as steaming,
microwaving, or poaching, is your best bet. Any method that requires only
a small amount of fat, such as sautéing or stir-frying food in a skillet or wok
with just a spoonful of oil is your second best bet. Roasting and broiling can
both be low-calorie techniques for cooking meat and vegetables, as long as
you don’t add much fat. I cover these techniques in the following sections.
Steaming
Steaming is the ideal cooking method for low-calorie cooks who are in a
hurry because it’s a relatively quick and easy way of preparing food that adds
no calories and requires very little clean-up.
If you’re steaming food, place it on a rack or in a steamer basket. You then put
the rack or steamer basket over boiling liquid in a tightly covered container.
Don’t immerse the food in the boiling liquid; the steam created from that
liquid trapped in the covered pot cooks the food.
101
Chapter 5: Cooking in a Low-Calorie Kitchen

The method may vary slightly, depending on the type of steamer you use (see
“Getting all steamed up,” earlier in this chapter), but the following basics
apply whenever food is steamed over boiling liquid:
 Never overcrowd your steamer pot with food. Work in batches, if neces-
sary, to avoid uneven cooking.
 When using a steamer basket inside a pot, bring the liquid to a boil first,
and then lower the filled steamer basket into the pot. Doing so helps
assure even cooking. You may need to use a kitchen glove or potholder
so you don’t burn your hands.
 To successfully steam a dish, be sure the food sits over, not in, the boil-
ing water or other liquid used to create steam, and that the steamer has
enough room for the steam to circulate freely.
 Always uncover your steamer with the lid opening away from you.
Otherwise, you could get a steam burn on your hands or face.
 If you’re new to steaming, keep a pot of water simmering, in case you
need to replenish the liquid in the bottom of the steamer. If the liquid
evaporates in your steamer before you replace it, the cooking process
will be interrupted and you may damage your steamer.
To improvise a steamer, fit a metal cooling rack, wire mesh strainer, or metal
colander inside a large deep saucepan. Another way to steam food is to
invert a small heatproof bowl or custard cup in the bottom of a deep skillet
or saucepot large enough to hold a heatproof plate with at least 1⁄2-inch open
space around the perimeter to allow steam to circulate. Fill the pot with an
inch of boiling water or enough to come halfway up the side of the bowl.
Place the food to be steamed on a heatproof plate and lower the plate into
the pot to sit on the inverted bowl. (See Figure 5-2.)
However you improvise a steamer, be sure you can tightly cover the pot, and
be sure to protect your hands, arms, and face from hot water and steam
whenever the pot is uncovered. As with all stovetop-cooking methods, keep
young children away from the stove while you’re steaming.
Cooking in a microwave oven
The most popular uses for a microwave oven may be reheating leftovers and
heating up precooked convenience foods, but for low-cal cooks and other
healthy eaters, microwave ovens are also excellent for cooking certain foods
from scratch, especially fresh vegetables. As with steaming, the vegetables
preserve more of their flavor and nutrients when cooked quickly in the very
small amount of water required in a microwave oven, and no calories are
added.
102
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Use Table 5-5 as a general guide to cooking fresh vegetables in a full power
(700 watt) microwave oven. Cooking times vary, depending on the size of the
vegetables and the oven. These cooking times are for 1 pound of vegetables
cooked in a covered container with 2 tablespoons of water for most vegeta-
bles and 3 tablespoons of water for starchier vegetables such as peas and
potatoes. Be sure that vegetables are trimmed or cut into equal-size pieces
for even cooking. When cooking vegetables or other food in a microwave
oven, check halfway through the cooking time and stir or rearrange the
pieces for even cooking, if necessary. Most vegetables require a standing time
after cooking of 1 to 5 minutes to finish cooking.

The following tips can help you when cooking foods and making the most of
your microwave oven:
 If time allows, defrost frozen foods first in the refrigerator before reheat-
ing them in the microwave oven. Defrosting food in the microwave can
cause hot spots, areas where some of the food is actually cooking while
other areas are still thawing and/or reheating.
 Use only food-safe, microwaveable containers to cook or reheat food in a
microwave oven. Any container not designed for use in a microwave oven
may melt, explode, catch fire, or impart toxic substances to your food.
 Reheat bread and other baked goods at half (50 percent) power to avoid
drying out and hardening.
 Cook individual boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (cutlets) in a
small covered dish with 1⁄4 cup chicken broth or other liquid for about 8
minutes or until the flesh in the center of the breast is opaque. Allow the
chicken to cool slightly before cutting.
 Cook 1 pound fresh fish in a covered container (no added liquid is nec-
essary) for 5 to 6 minutes or until the fish flakes easily and the flesh in
the center of the fish is opaque.
104
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

 Pregrilling is another good use for the microwave oven because it speeds
up the time food spends on the grill. Cook meat or poultry at half (50 per-
cent) power until half-cooked, and then immediately transfer to the grill
to finish cooking.
 Use only popcorn that is packaged for popping in a microwave oven.
Poaching
Poaching simply means simmering plain food in enough liquid to cover it in a
pot or deep skillet. It’s a technique that is well suited to low-calorie dieting
because it adds no calories to the food being poached.
Poaching is used mainly for cooking whole or filleted fish, shellfish, and bone-
less, skinless chicken or turkey breasts. Generally, when cooking seafood,
use fish stock, and when cooking poultry, use chicken broth. For your cooking
liquid, use well-seasoned salt, whole peppercorns, and herbs, and enhance it
with seasoning vegetables such as onions, carrots, and celery that cook
alongside the seafood or poultry. The food that is poached picks up some
of the broth’s flavor and, in turn, the broth’s flavor is enriched by the food
that cooks in it. You can serve the leftover poaching liquid with the food or
use it to make a sauce or soup. You can buy special poaching pans, but any
pan that’s large enough to hold both the food and the liquid will do.
Follow these easy steps when poaching poultry and seafood:
1. Add the fish or chicken to cold poaching liquid.
2. Slowly bring the liquid to a boil over medium heat.
3. Reduce the heat to low.
Use the following times when poaching certain meats. Remember that
poaching time begins when the water just starts to bubble.
Fish steaks or filets until opaque in center, 6 to 10 minutes depend-
ing on the type and thickness of the fish
Chicken breasts until opaque in center, about 6 to 8 minutes
Lobster, crab, or shrimp (in their shells) for about 20 minutes per
pound
Increase the poaching time for larger turkey breasts and whole fish
accordingly.
Stir-frying
Like steaming, stir-frying is a moist-heat method of cooking that’s quick, easy,
and, if done properly, light on calories. When you stir-fry in a wok or deep
skillet, you stir the food constantly to keep it moving so that the heat of the
pan cooks your food without burning it. Using the pan’s heat to cook the food
allows you to use less added fat than with other forms of frying.
105
Chapter 5: Cooking in a Low-Calorie Kitchen

Stir-frying is also similar to sautéing, which is the method most people use to
cook food in a skillet with just a teaspoonful or, at most, a tablespoonful of
fat, and stirring often to prevent the food from sticking and burning. With stir-
frying, you spend most of your time preparing the food by cutting meats and
vegetables into bite-size, similar-size pieces for even cooking.
Use these helpful tips for successful stir-frying:
 Cut and slice all foods and measure and mix all seasonings and sauces in
advance of cooking. You usually don’t have enough time to cut up food
between adding in the next ingredient when stir-frying.
 Arrange your ingredients in the order in which they’ll go into the wok or
skillet.
 Heat your wok or skillet first, and then add the cooking oil. Doing so
helps prevent food from sticking.
Roasting, broiling, and grilling
Roasting and broiling are known as dry-heat methods of cooking that are
done in a regular oven, a convection oven, or even a toaster oven. When food
is broiled, excess fat falls through the broiler rack and into the broiler pan,
eliminating many calories. To get the same benefit from roasting, raise your
food by placing it on a rack that fits inside the roasting pan.
Baking and roasting are one and the same — no matter what you call it, food
that is baked or roasted is cooked by hot, dry air circulating in a tightly
closed oven. Traditionally, the word roasting was used to describe a method
for cooking large cuts of meat, while the word baking was used to describe
cooking almost everything else in an oven. These days, however, roasting
vegetables, garlic, fish, and poultry is more fashionable than it is to bake
them, so the term “roasted” is used more often now to describe food cooked
in a regular oven.
106
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 
Making a marvelous marinade
Look for marinade recipes that contain little or
no fat. The following teriyaki marinade contains
no fat, is relatively low in calories, and tastes
absolutely yummy on meat, chicken, or fish:
Stir together 1⁄2 cup soy sauce, 3 tablespoons
light brown sugar, 2 tablespoons dry sherry or
white wine, 2 teaspoons minced garlic, 1⁄2 tea-
spoon ground ginger or 1⁄4 teaspoon Chinese
five-spice powder in a small bowl. Yield: about 3⁄4
cup marinade.

Lean meats, poultry, and fish — mainstays in many low-calorie diets — can
easily dry out when they’re roasted in an oven or cooked under a broiler. To
prevent lean meats from drying out and getting tough, marinate the meat (for
at least 30 minutes at room temperature or 1 hour in the refrigerator) before
cooking and baste it with the marinade or its own pan juices several times
while cooking.
Another way to keep lean meats from drying out in the oven is to cover the
roasting pan for the second half of the cooking time so that steam is formed,
helping the meat to stay moist.
Broiling is usually quicker than roasting and can be likened to grilling
because, when done correctly, it quickly browns and crisps the outside of
your food while cooking the inside just to the doneness you desire. Be careful
if you aren’t an experienced cook. You don’t want to burn the outside of your
food before the inside is done.
To avoid burning your food when broiling, place your meats, poultry, fish, or
vegetables 4 to 6 inches from the heating element, as long as you check the
food from time to time while it’s cooking.

Chapter 6
Planning Low-Calorie Menus:
The First Four Weeks
In This Chapter
 Understanding how this diet works
 Planning your meals for four weeks
O
ne problem with many weight-loss plans is that they’re too rigid. That
rigidity — the strict rules and regulations about what to eat and what
not to eat — often causes well-intentioned dieters to lose sight of their goals
and give up.
This plan is different because you have more than one way to approach the
diet. You can follow it to a “T,” or you can make your own rules (within
reason, of course). Most importantly, you limit your calories and stay aware
of the amount of food you’re eating, regardless of which approach you take.
These first four weeks are crucial to the long-term success of your diet
because during this time you’re getting used to eating fewer calories each
day and establishing the habits that can help you eat better throughout your
lifetime. This chapter gives you the basics on the number of calories you’ll
consume and guidelines for sticking to the plan. I also provide you with four
weeks of simple, delicious menus, complete with helpful tips and shortcuts.
Preparing Yourself for the First
Four Weeks
Before you dive into this chapter, you need to know the basics of starting a
low-calorie diet plan: the number of calories you’re going to consume, the
importance of maintaining the plan, and fun ways to keep the plan interesting.

Going by the numbers
This plan is designed so you can ease into your diet by simply sticking to
1,500 calories for the first few days. To allow you to move gradually into a
more restricted plan, the daily menus in this chapter begin at 1,500 calories
and taper down to 1,000. If 1,500 calories is too high a limit for you, start off
with 1,400 or 1,300 or whatever calorie level feels right.
You can always go back to 1,500 if you feel too restricted. If you’re looking to
lose only 10 or 15 pounds and want to dive right in and start your diet at
1,000 calories a day, that’s okay, too. Just skip the first two weeks of meal
plans and start with Day 14. (For more information on determining how many
calories you need each day, see Chapter 3.)
If you want to cut back further on calories on any given day or within any of
your meals, reduce your portion sizes, rather than eliminate foods. That
way, your diet stays as nutritionally balanced as possible.
You can always eat less, if you don’t feel hungry on a particular day, but if you
eat too few calories one day, you’ll likely find yourself ravished and overeating
the next day. In general, 1,000 calories is as low as you should go. Remember:
No less for long-term success!
Following the rules as closely as possible
If you want structure and don’t want to have to think much for yourself,
follow each day’s menus closely. (I’ve done all the planning for you!) Pay
attention to the serving sizes and variety of foods offered at each meal.
Doing so can help you master portion control and nutritional balance. (See
Chapter 3 for more about portion sizes.)
Planning is everything when you’re living a low-calorie lifestyle. Take the time
to plan a week’s worth of menus in advance. How do you do that?
 Choose your menus for the week from the selection you find later in this
chapter, or use the menus in this chapter as guides to create your own.
 Use the menus to make up shopping lists.
 Shop only for those items you need to prepare your planned meals and
snacks throughout the week.
 Stick to your shopping list. Chapter 5 contains plenty of good advice for
navigating the aisles of your supermarket.
 Try to get all your shopping done in one weekly trip to avoid having to
go back to the supermarket and be faced with the temptation of buying
foods that aren’t on your original list for the week.
110
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Stick to your calorie limit each day. But remember that your limit is an
approximate number and you’re working within a range of calories. For
instance, if you find you’re simply starving at the end of the day, eating an
apple or a 1⁄2 ounce of cheese that adds 50 or 75 calories won’t break your
calorie budget for the day. Eating a few extra calories is much better for the
overall success of your diet than feeling so hungry and deprived you end up
bingeing in the middle of the night.
While you’re following this plan, don’t worry about the calorie content of
individual foods. I’ve already done the math for you. All you have to do is
follow the menu plans and rest assured. The calorie counts for each day
are included with the menu plans, so you’ll know how many calories you’ve
consumed.
At some point, however, you’ll find yourself in situations where you have
to deviate from your plan or you’ll have questions about how to make 
substitutions without adding additional calories. When this happens, refer
to Appendixes A and B for calorie counts of both individual foods and food
groups.
Coffee, tea, water, seltzer, and diet beverages are all “free foods” that aren’t
tallied against your daily calorie count. (You can find more “free foods” in
Chapter 3.) If you use milk in your coffee or tea, take it from the measured
amounts of milk or other dairy products allocated at meals. If you add sugar
to your drinks, you must take those calories from someplace else. For
instance, if you choose to put sugar in your coffee at breakfast, compensate
for the calories by eliminating or reducing the amount of pancake syrup, jelly,
or other condiment you use throughout the day.
If you choose not to use lean, lowfat, or reduced-fat versions of products,
such as milk, yogurt, mayonnaise, and lunch foods, and you choose the
higher-fat version instead, cut the amount called for in half to avoid extra
calories. And when you’re confronted with a choice between small, medium,
and large sizes of foods such as whole fruits or breads and other baked
goods, opt for small to medium to be on the safe side.
Doing your own thing to
keep the plan fresh
Most people who need to lose weight benefit from a disciplined eating plan,
one that has you eating three square meals a day and maybe a snack or two,
regardless of your personal or work schedule. This type of discipline helps
prevent you from losing control over what and how much you eat.
111
Chapter 6: Planning Low-Calorie Menus: The First Four Weeks

That said, no law says that you can’t have spaghetti for breakfast or raisin
bran for dinner, just as no law dictates that you must eat your snack at 2 p.m.
You can certainly look at your day’s menu plans and decide to eat your lunch
in the morning, use your dinner menu as a guideline for ordering lunch, and
eat your breakfast foods at 8 p.m.
If you get bored with following the menu plans so precisely, or if that simply
doesn’t appeal to you from the start, you can personalize the menus and
rearrange them somewhat to suit your taste. You can do this by:
 Substituting equal amounts of similar foods. For instance, you can 
substitute a pear for a small banana or half an English muffin for a slice
of toast.
 Exchanging menus from day to day. For instance, you can eat
Wednesday’s breakfast on Monday, or next Thursday’s lunch today.
Just be sure you’re substituting meals that contribute approximately
the same number of calories.
 Incorporating this book’s recipes. You can add the breakfast, lunch, and
dinner recipes and the ideas for snacks and desserts from Part IV into
your low-calorie menu plans. Just make sure that the recipe you select
fits in with your calorie intake for the day.
Taking the Plunge: Week 1
When you make any significant diet change, you first have to get used to a
new way of eating. In this case, even if a 1,500-calorie plan doesn’t kick off
any weight, it’s still a good place to start because you’re getting used to the
idea of eating a specific amount of food at each meal and a specific number
of calories in a day. You’re breaking the habit of eating whatever you want,
whenever you want, and instead, getting used to structured meals.
Day 1: 1,500 calories
On a 1,500-calorie day, each of the meals — breakfast, lunch, and dinner —
provide up to 400 calories, which is 100 calories more per meal than you’ll
eat on your 1,000-calorie days. You also get two snacks that contribute about
150 calories each or one snack or dessert that provides up to 300 calories,
twice what you’ll be getting from snacks on your 1,000-calorie days.

Snacks
1 small banana
1 cup lowfat frozen yogurt
1 tablespoon light chocolate syrup
Day 4: 1,400 calories
One good thing about convenience foods, such as frozen waffles and bottled
juices, is that they often contain added vitamins and minerals. Eating and
drinking these fortified foods is helpful on a low-cal plan because the more
you cut back on calories, the more difficult getting all the nutrients you need
is. (See Chapter 4 for more about shopping for convenience foods.) On a
1,400-calorie plan, each meal contributes 350 to 400 calories and your snacks
contribute 200 to 250 calories.
Breakfast
1 (4-inch) frozen waffle
2 tablespoons light syrup
1 cup cut-up fruit or berries
1 cup skim milk or 6 ounces flavored lowfat yogurt
Lunch
2 slices light bread
2 ounces reduced-fat cheddar cheese

you’ll be down to 1,000 calories.
Day 8: 1,300 calories
You’ll probably never know exactly how many calories are in the prepared
foods you pick up from a salad bar. Thus, you need to know how to eyeball
cup measurements and concentrate more on portion control. (See Chapter 3
for more details on portions.)

Day 9: 1,200 calories
On a 1,200-calorie day, your meals contribute about 350 calories and your
snacks contribute no more than 150 calories.
Anytime you see “fruit spread” on the menu, you can substitute a low-sugar

2 thin slices avocado
1⁄2 cup fat-free salsa
Snack
1⁄2 cup lowfat rice pudding
Day 10: 1,200 calories
These menus are designed for a general population of calorie counters with
varied tastes, so, for instance, butter is allowed on today’s breakfast toast but
if you’re happy with fruit spread or low-sugar jam, which has fewer calories
and no fat, go right ahead and substitute an equal amount.
Breakfast
2 slices light bread
2 teaspoons butter or margarine
1⁄2 cup pineapple cubes (fresh or packed in juice)

On a 1,000-calorie day, your meals contribute about 300 calories each and
your snacks contribute no more than 100 calories.
When you’re not sure about how much you can eat of a particular food, think
small, especially when it comes to snack foods. For instance, if your plan says
you can eat 30 pretzel sticks, that doesn’t mean 30 thick, braided pretzel
rods. It means 30 skinny, little sticks!

1⁄2 cup skim milk
1⁄2 cup peach slices

mended portion size, and you won’t go too far off course.
Breakfast
1⁄2 cup orange juice
1⁄2 medium bagel, toasted and topped with 1⁄4 cup light cream cheese and 1
tablespoon fruit spread
Lunch
2 cups spinach and orange salad with 1 tablespoon light dressing

1⁄2 cup pinto beans
2 tablespoons shredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese

Dinner on today’s menu is from a Chinese restaurant. Feel free to substitute
equal amounts of a light soup, stir-fried meat and vegetables, and rice that
you cook at home.
Familiarize yourself with the size of a 1⁄3-cup serving of food. It’s a very handy
cup size for low-cal dieters because, very often, 1⁄2 cup of a food contains too
many calories and 1⁄4 cup isn’t enough food.

Watching Your Weight Drop: Week 4
By now you’re used to following a 1,000-calorie diet plan, and if you’ve fol-
lowed this diet plan for three weeks, you’ve probably experienced an initial
weight loss of about 4 to 6 pounds. This progress can help motivate you to
continue on your 1,000-calorie diet plan if that’s the calorie level you feel
works best for you.
Anytime you feel that you can’t stick to a 1,000-calorie day, follow a menu
plan that allows 1,200 or 1,300 calories. If you stop losing before you’ve
reached your goal weight, you can try cutting back to 1,000 calories a day.
Day 22: 1,000 calories
To maintain your calorie limit when making pasta substitutions, choose
shapes and sizes similar to what’s on the menu plan. If the menu calls for a
short, stubby pasta, such as shells, stick with other short stubby shapes,
such as elbows, radiatorre, wheels, and so on, when making substitutions. If
you want a substitute for spaghetti, think about linguine, fettuccine, and
other long thin pasta shapes.
Breakfast
1 cup cut-up cantaloupe and raspberries
1 cup oatmeal with 2 teaspoons sugar
1⁄2 cup skim milk
Lunch
2 ounces lean sliced ham

1⁄2 cup mango chunks
1⁄4 cup fat-free granola
Lunch
Turkey wrap: 1 (6-inch) fat-free tortilla, 1 tablespoon reduced-fat mayon-

leaves
8 baby carrots with 2 tablespoons light ranch dressing
Dinner
2 cups spinach salad with 1 tablespoon light dressing
5 ounces salmon, steamed or broiled
1⁄2 cup cooked couscous mixed with 1 diced tomato
Snack
2 cups light popcorn
Day 24: 1,000 calories
When you don’t know the calorie counts of the prepared foods you buy from
delis and salad bars, and you have a choice, go for the lower-fat version.
You’re more likely to be saving calories than if you choose the classic dish.
Breakfast
1⁄2 cup orange juice
1 scrambled egg
1 slice light bread, toasted
2 teaspoons butter
1⁄2 cup skim milk

Day 26: 1,000 calories
On this menu you find mashed potatoes, one of those foods that can be pre-
pared a hundred different ways and come out with a hundred different calorie
counts. No worries. Add-ins like milk and butter have been factored in, so just
stick strictly to the 1⁄2 cup portion size and you won’t stray far from your calo-
rie allowance, regardless of how your potatoes are prepared. The same is true
for the meatloaf on this dinner menu. No matter how you make it (or buy it),
any type of meatloaf is okay.
Breakfast
1⁄2 English muffin with 2 tablespoons apple butter
1⁄2 cup lowfat yogurt
1 tablespoon granola
Lunch
2 cups tossed salad with 1 tablespoon light dressing

Snack
1⁄2 cup lowfat rice pudding
Day 27: 1,000 calories
When the menu on a low-calorie diet plan says “muffin,” you can be sure it
doesn’t mean Texas-size muffin. It means a normal-size muffin, like the type of
muffin you make at home in a standard muffin pan. Sorry about that!
Breakfast
1 small corn muffin
1 tablespoon strawberry fruit spread

provide delicious smoothie recipes in Chapter 12.)
Breakfast

Chapter 7
Pulling through Your Plan’s
First Few Months
In This Chapter
 Updating your goals and planning your next steps
 Staying motivated
 Trying new menus
I
f you’ve been following the low-calorie menu plans and diet advice
included in this book, then pat yourself on the back. You’ve not only lost
some weight or, at the very least, managed to stop gaining weight, but you’ve
also figured out that living a low-calorie lifestyle means more than eating less
food. That lesson is the most important one a dieter can discover! (If you
haven’t been following the low-calorie menu plans, don’t worry. Just go to
Chapter 6 to get started.)
Read this chapter after you’ve been on a low-calorie diet plan for at least a
month and you’re ready for your next steps. After a month or so, you can
pause and assess your plan to see if you’re satisfied with the results.
If the plan is working for you, if you have no complaints, and you’re happily
losing weight, you may not need this chapter yet. Stick with what you’re
doing and just remember that this chapter is always here when you need it.
Come back to it when you start to get restless, bored, frustrated, or con-
cerned that your diet just isn’t doing it for you. You can find solutions here.
If you’re starting to fall off track, this chapter provides plenty of new ways to
approach your diet day to day. You also find ideas for rewarding yourself for
a job well done and for distracting and entertaining yourself when you’re
tempted to overeat. These pointers can help you to avoid falling back into
your old routine of overeating and underexercising.

Reassessing Your Low-Calorie Plan
You’ve prepared yourself in every possible way to live a low-calorie lifestyle
now and forever, and to lose weight by following the food plan in Chapter 6.
Are you happy with your plan? Is it working out for you? You’ve stayed on the
plan for at least one month, and now is a good time for a self-check! If you can
answer, “yes” to all or most of the following questions, then you’re definitely
on the road to weight control.
 Have you been meeting your short-term goals? Keep in mind that a
short-term goal can be as simple as getting into the habit of carrying a
water bottle or working out for 5 extra minutes. Be realistic and keep
your goals doable. Check out Chapter 4 for details on setting goals.
 Are you sticking to your menu plans? If you need more interesting or
more focused menu plans, you can find them in the “Getting into Fun
Menu Plans” section, later in this chapter.
 Are you eating nutritionally balanced meals? Why live a low-calorie
lifestyle if it isn’t healthy? You’d just end up skinny and sick! If you want to
review what eating a balanced low-calorie diet means, flip to Chapter 3.
 Have you replaced unhealthy eating habits with healthier new ones?
For long-term weight loss, you need to understand that consuming fewer
calories isn’t enough. You must change your eating habits, which
includes everything from eating more regular meals, to eating more
slowly, to making sure you sit down every time you eat. You can find
more information on paying more attention to how you eat, otherwise
known as mindful eating, in Chapter 4.
 Have you been exercising as much as you promised yourself? Your
exercise goals need to be as realistic as your other goals, or they’ll never
come to fruition. Chapter 8 is full of exercise info.
 Have you found nonfood ways to deal with stressful emotions such as
anger, anxiety, and disappointment? Many overeaters eat in response
to their emotions. If you’re an emotional overeater, you can find help in
Chapter 9.
 Are you maintaining a positive attitude toward your low-cal lifestyle?
If you’re having attitude problems, check out Chapter 4 for more on posi-
tive, or mindful, thinking.
 Have you developed a reliable support network? Asking for help is
part of taking care of yourself. If you need more help than you’re getting,
turn to Chapter 11 for advice on reaching out.
 Do you still feel resolved to follow a low-cal diet plan and lose weight?
If you need a motivational lift, you may find it by reading the section
“Motivating Yourself, Bit by Bit” later in this chapter. If you need more
help, review Chapter 4.

Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Review your plan at least once a month during the first six months of follow-
ing a low-cal diet to be sure that your eating, exercise, and behavioral pat-
terns are in line with your original goals. Revisit your goals (as described in
the next section) and, if necessary, update some of your goals to reflect any
adjustments you need to make to your plan.
The following sections contain tips and advice on adjusting your original
goals, evaluating your diet’s makeup, and making any changes necessary to
ensure that your low-calorie plan is compatible with your lifestyle.
Revisiting your goals
Many health experts believe that your best weight is whatever weight you
can maintain by eating approximately 2,000 calories a day — a little less for
most women and a little more for most men — and exercising often. That
weight may be something other than what you have in mind for a long-term
goal. Just for now, think about a time when you were at a comfortable weight
and make that weight your goal. Even if that weight is at the top of your
healthy weight range or outside your healthy weight change, it’s still a good
goal for now. (To find your healthy weight range, check out Chapter 2.) When
you reach that goal weight and you’re able to maintain that weight for several
months, then consider setting new goals for losing a little more.
Chapter 4 shows you how to set weight goals, food goals, fitness goals,
behavior goals, and psychological goals. You may choose to focus on one
goal at a time or you may decide to dive in and reset any number of goals.
Either way, you’ll be updating your goals from time to time because they’ll
change for all kinds of reasons. You’ll reach your short-term and intermediate
goals and have to set new ones. You may be too ambitious when you estab-
lish your goals and find that they’re impossible to meet within the timeframe
you’ve given yourself. If your goals turn out to be unrealistic, change them.
While you’re revisiting your initial goals, now may be a good time to think
about what’s realistic for you. Are you trying to get to a weight you were at 20
years ago? Are you trying to get to a weight you can’t remember staying at
for more than a couple of days? You may not realistically be able to get to the
weight you were in your teens, twenties, or even your thirties. Sticking to the
very low calorie level required to get to that weight may be impossible. Even
if you do reach your desired weight, staying there may be next to impossible.
You may even be jeopardizing your health by trying.
What about other goals? Have you been too hard or too easy on yourself
when it comes to exercise? Have you been paying as much attention to your
eating habits as you have been to the food you eat? If you’ve already estab-
lished goals in those areas, update your goals. If you’ve been taking it slow
135
Chapter 7: Pulling through Your Plan’s First Few Months

and focusing only on your diet, now may be a good time to switch gears and
set some exercise goals. (You can get some help in Chapter 8.) If you’re
having trouble setting or reaching behavioral goals or psychological goals,
flip to Chapter 9 for some help. And if you feel you simply can’t lose weight
alone, Chapter 11 can guide you toward the right kind of help.
Taking stock of your diet
This section focuses strictly on your low-calorie diet. Taking stock of your
diet means pausing to look at your diet, questioning what you’re doing and
how you’re eating, and determining whether or not you need to carry on the
same way or if you still need to take steps to improve your diet plan.
The following questions can help you reevaluate your diet so that you can be
sure it leads to long-term weight loss success.
 Are you watching your serving sizes? Portion control is key to a suc-
cessful low-calorie diet. In Chapter 3, you can find tips for measuring and
eyeballing standard serving sizes of different types of food.
 Do you feel you’re eating enough food? If not, perhaps you need to
plan your diet to include more low-calorie vegetables and other foods
that you can eat in larger quantities on a low-calorie diet.
 Are you eating often enough? Eating every three to five hours is impor-
tant to keep your energy levels up and to prevent hunger and overeating
at your next meal. If you find yourself getting hungry in between meals,
try breaking your menu plans down into mini-meals you can eat more
frequently throughout the day. (You can use the “Grazing day” menu
plan later in this chapter as a guide.)
 Are you enjoying the food you’re eating? If not, you may need to add
more variety to your diet by experimenting with new foods and new
recipes. Perhaps you need to find a way to include more of your favorite
foods in your low-calorie diet. Check out the alternative menu plans in
the “Getting into Fun Menu Plans,” later in this chapter for some variety.
Chapter 3 also has info on the importance of keeping your diet balanced
and varied.
 Are you losing 1 to 2 pounds a week? If you’re losing more, your calorie
allowance is too low for the amount of exercise you do every day.
Although you may find it motivating to lose more than a pound or two a
week, the faster you lose weight, the less likely you are to keep it off. If
you’re not losing at least a pound a week most weeks, cut back on the
amount of calories you consume. (You can also consider increasing your
physical activity; see Chapter 8 for exercise info.)

Making changes to fit your lifestyle
The closer your diet plan fits to your lifestyle, the better the chance you’ll
stick to it, so when your lifestyle changes, your diet and exercise plan may
have to change, too. For instance, if you get promoted, you may not have
time to work out on your lunch hour anymore. If you move or get a new job,
you may be shopping in different supermarket chains, frequenting new deli-
catessens and convenience food stores, and eating in different restaurants. If
you get married, you may be spending more time eating with your in-laws or
more time eating “real” meals at home. The food routines you’ve established
so far on your low-calorie plan may have to change.
If what you’re doing is working for you, keep doing it. If the overall plan
you’ve set up for yourself feels good and shows promise, don’t change any-
thing. And if you’ve stopped doing something that was successful in the past,
start doing it again. For instance, if you were watching your diet, and at the
same time you were walking for half an hour every day on your lunch hour,
and you lost or maintained weight, then that combination worked for you. If
you’ve stopped walking or you’re still walking but not watching your diet as
carefully, get back with that same program! You may want to add more exer-
cise to your day to lose more weight, but don’t stop doing what you were
already doing to keep your weight under control.
On the flip side, if you’ve started doing something that doesn’t help you lose
weight, stop doing it! If you joined a weight-loss program and you’re not fol-
lowing the program, quit. Now is probably not the right time for you to take
that approach, so why waste time and money? If you’re down to 1,000 calo-
ries and you’re so hungry that you’re driven to distraction, come up with a
new plan. Add a couple of hundred calories to your menu plan and try to do
ten more minutes of exercise every day.
Motivating Yourself, Bit by Bit
If, in the first six months of your plan, you’ve lost some of the initial motivation
you felt when you started thinking about losing weight, or you can feel that
motivation starting to slip away, first remind yourself why you wanted to lose
weight in the first place. Then figure out why your motivation is slipping. Are
you hungry all the time? Are you bored? Are you tired of going at it alone? Get
to the root of the problem and tackle it right away.
In the following sections, I show you how to reward yourself, create diversions
to avoid overeating, and get help from family, friends, and diet buddies.
Chapter 9 has additional info to help you battle long-term challenges and
everyday frustrations.

Chapter 7: Pulling through Your Plan’s First Few Months

Reaping rewards for sticking
with your plan
The biggest and best rewards for losing weight and getting fit are your own
good health and the sense of accomplishment when you lose weight. Ideally,
those rewards would be enough to keep you motivated to continue until you
reach your long-term goals. But, hey, you’re only human. Everyone needs tan-
gible rewards once in a while to keep going. You can try giving yourself a hug,
but if you’re anything like me, that won’t cut it.
Reward yourself for changes in your behavior, attitude, and weight. For
instance, if you exercise ten minutes longer, or you start substituting
positive thoughts about yourself and your diet for any negative, self-
destructive thoughts that have been blocking your success, then celebrate!
Many dieters reward themselves with fabulous new clothes to fit their fabu-
lous new bodies after they’ve lost a substantial amount of weight. But you
certainly don’t have to wait until the end is in sight before you start giving
yourself motivational rewards. Think about other nonfood rewards, big and
small, that you can look forward to and bestow upon yourself along the way.
Give yourself a reward every day, if it helps you stay motivated.
Refer to the following list whenever you feel you need some added incentive
or when you reach a milestone (otherwise known as a goal) and feel like cele-
brating. You can also add your own ideas to this list. (Just scribble your
thoughts in the margins; you can write in this book!)
 Pick up a bouquet of flowers or a flowering houseplant.
 Get a manicure and a pedicure.
 Get a massage.
 Have a facial.
 Pick out a new piece of jewelry.
 Buy a fashion accessory, like a trendy scarf or belt.
 Splurge on beauty products.
 Find an attractive blank book for keeping your journal.
 Look for an interesting cookbook that features foods that are naturally
low in calories.
 Buy a newly released, bestselling book.
 Hire a cleaning service.
 Buy yourself a new wallet.
 Buy a fun magazine.
138
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Match the size of your reward to the specific accomplishment, so you don’t
run out of ways to reward yourself. If you think small at first, you can reward
yourself for achieving the many short-term goals you set early on. A small
reward may be as simple as a long bath or a day without housework, or it can
be a little bit bigger such as a piece of costume jewelry. As the months go by,
and you start to reach your intermediate and long-term goals, you can start
thinking about that new dishwasher or car, that gold bracelet, or that African
safari you’ve always wanted to take.
Most likely, you’ll also want to come up with a few rewards that don’t challenge
your budget, such as taking a mental health day or attending a free concert.
Another free reward is to let yourself spend some time planning bigger rewards
you can redeem when you reach some of your longer-term goals.
Carry a wish list in your wallet or someplace where you can always find it, to
remind yourself of the rewards that lie ahead and to keep yourself motivated.
A list is handy for those in-the-moment decisions you often have to make
about whether or not to eat a particular food, or to spend an extra ten min-
utes at the gym, or even to eat or exercise at all. If you have your list on hand,
you can choose a reward that provides the most motivation, in that moment,
to help you make the best diet and exercise choices.
Even though rewarding yourself for a job well done is great, the opposite
doesn’t hold true. Don’t punish yourself for sneaking a snack or even going
on an all-out eating binge. Forget about your backslide! Guilt is a very
common form of self-punishment employed by dieters. If you want to make
amends with yourself, eat a little lighter the next day or bike an extra mile.
What makes the most sense is just starting again wherever you left off, get-
ting back on track, and moving forward. Anything else just gets in the way of
your long-term success.
Finding diversions to avoid overeating
After a while, you’ll probably find that you don’t need as many rewards to
stay motivated as you did. Instead, you may need distractions to help pre-
vent you from eating when you’re not really hungry. Instead of buying your-
self something, you may want to try new activities and hobbies that provide
the diversions you need.
The following list may not provide any revolutionary new ideas. However, I
include it to remind you of the many things you can do with your time
instead of eating, thinking about eating, or handcuffing yourself to the bath-
room door so you don’t eat. I include this list because sometimes, when your
mind is so narrowly focused on food, you can’t think of a single thing to do
except eat. You probably know you could go for a walk instead of eating, pop
in an exercise video, or go out and discover how to play a new sport, but you
139
Chapter 7: Pulling through Your Plan’s First Few Months

can’t spend every spare minute exercising. Some of the rewards listed in the
previous section can double as diversions. In addition, the activities in the
upcoming list can distract you from overeating. When you get other ideas,
add them to this list.
 Plan a weekend getaway.
 Get away for a weekend.
 Set up a fish tank.
 Clean your fish tank.
 Plant a garden.
 Weed your garden.
 Legally download some new music.
 Go for a drive and listen to some new music in your car.
 Read up on how to take better photographs.
 Take pictures of your kids.
 Take pictures of your pets.
 Write in your journal.
 Start a scrapbook.
 Visit a museum.
 Take a guided tour at a museum.
 Browse in a bookstore.
 Browse in a library.
 Buy or borrow a good classic book that takes awhile to read.
 Take a painting class.
 Paint a self-portrait.
 Paint a portrait of your mate.
 Sneak out to the movies by yourself (avoiding the food concession).
 Buy a new address book and fill it in.
 Give your dog a bath.
 Wash your car.
 Call a friend.
 Take up knitting, crocheting, or another form of needlework.
 Brush and floss your teeth.
 Chew gum or suck on a mint-flavored hard candy.
140
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

You need diversions to get you through moments of temptation so that you
don’t make choices you’ll regret. If the temporary distractions you’re using
aren’t enough, take time to master some relaxation techniques to help con-
trol your moods and impulses. Turn to Chapter 9 for information on mind-
body exercises, such as yoga, t’ai chi, and pilates, that can help you relax and
ultimately cope with the emotional issues that often underlie overeating.
Using the buddy system
The motivation you need to stick to a low-calorie diet and build a lifestyle
around it ultimately has to come from within you. You’re the only one who
can really drive yourself to do whatever it takes to reach and maybe even
exceed your weight-loss goals. But you can still reach for outside help to
maintain your motivation along the way. Family and friends who are familiar
with and support your weight-loss efforts can help you stay motivated by
giving you positive feedback and new ideas to help you reach your goals. Ask
them for help when you need it.
One of the reasons a buddy system works so well for dieters is that you may
be more motivated to stick to your diet or get out and exercise if someone
else is counting on you to keep them on track. If you don’t already have a diet
buddy, think of the people you know in your neighborhood or at your job and
ask someone if he or she is interested in a team approach. When you have an
official “buddy,” you have someone to share diet and exercise tips with, help
you get through your low points, and celebrate your successes.
You can find out more about finding a buddy in Chapter 11. And in Chapter 17,
you find a great example of how the buddy system worked for two teachers
who dieted together and helped each other stick to a low-calorie plan.
Getting into Fun Menu Plans
Fad diets — especially the ones that encourage you to eat a lot of one type of
food or avoid another —usually aren’t nutritionally balanced, and they don’t
teach you anything about normal eating. You won’t stay healthy if you stay
on this type of fad diet for a long time, and if you can’t stick to a diet for the
long term, it won’t work.
Another reason fad diets don’t work, even some of the healthier ones, is
because you can only eat so much of any one type of food without getting
bored and restless. How long has anyone ever stayed on a cabbage soup
diet? Not long, I assure you. How many days can you eat lean meat and salad
without having a piece of bread or a potato on the side? Some very deter-
mined dieters may go for several months or even years, but most people,
including myself, wouldn’t make it through one day.
141
Chapter 7: Pulling through Your Plan’s First Few Months

If you take the following “fad” diets for what they are — one-day diets — then
they aren’t that bad. Just stay on them for a day at a time, just for the fun of
it. For instance, you may hear that dairy products can help you lose weight.
No single type of food can help you lose weight, but you may be interested in
following a dairy diet anyway, because you love dairy foods and because, for
most people, there’s no reason not to include reduced-fat dairy foods in a
low-calorie diet.
All of the following menu plans provide 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day, and, for
the most part, they’re as nutritionally sound as possible for that calorie level.
These menus can help you take a “one day at a time” approach toward your
diet and provide ever-changing themes. (And you don’t have to wait until
you’ve followed every menu plan in Chapter 6 before you try some of these
menus!) They let you try out different types of fad diets without committing
to any of them, and they may inspire you to come up with theme menus of
your own, just for the fun of it. Diet plans that focus on specific themes also
give you an opportunity to discover how to include just about anything you
like to eat or drink on a low-calorie diet, as long as you stay within your calo-
rie limits. With that kind of flexibility, how can you go wrong?
Whenever you’re on a low-calorie diet plan, however, especially a plan that
eliminates any food groups or focuses on one food group in particular, con-
sider taking a multivitamin and mineral supplement that supplies up to 100
percent of the daily requirement for most nutrients.
High-protein day
This day mimics the many high-protein diets that promise fast weight loss. In
this case, even though every meal has high-protein foods, these menus are
still balanced with a variety of low-calorie carbohydrates.
Breakfast
2 scrambled eggs
1⁄2 cup skim milk
1⁄2 cup blueberries
Lunch
2 slices light bread
2 ounces lean ham
2 ounces reduced-fat cheese
1 roasted red pepper
142
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Dinner
3 ounces smoked turkey
1 cup steamed spinach with garlic and lemon
1 cup tomato salad with 1 tablespoon light dressing
1 mini breadstick
Snack
3⁄4 ounce (2 generous tablespoons) dry roasted peanuts
High-fiber day
Chapter 3 gives you plenty of reasons to fill up on fiber from whole grains,
fruits, vegetables, and legumes. This menu plan provides more than 30 grams
of fiber, which is a bit more than the minimum amount that nutrition experts
recommend for healthy people to consume each day.
At each meal, you can easily add extra fiber to your diet by sprinkling foods
you normally eat with wheat bran or oat bran, adding more fresh fruits and
vegetables to your diet, and combining high-fiber, whole-grain foods with
lower-fiber, processed grain foods.
Breakfast
1 cup oatmeal sprinkled with 2 tablespoons wheat bran
1 sliced pear
1⁄2 cup skim milk
Lunch
1 cup mixed fruit salad over 2 cups salad greens
1 tablespoon light poppy seed dressing
Dinner
1 cup cooked whole-wheat spaghetti mixed with regular spaghetti (1⁄2 cup
whole wheat and 1⁄2 cup regular)
1⁄4 cup marinara sauce
1 cup steamed broccoli
1⁄2 cup orange sections
143
Chapter 7: Pulling through Your Plan’s First Few Months

Snack
1⁄3 cup bean dip
1⁄4 cup salsa
8 baked tortilla chips
Dairy day
Dairy substitutes, such as soy milk, soy cheeses, soy yogurts, and rice and
almond beverages that have been fortified with calcium, vitamin D, and other
nutrients normally supplied by dairy products, can easily fit into the plan for
this day. This day supplies more than 1,600 mg of calcium, which is more
than the daily requirement for many people.
In these menus, you can find plenty of good examples of how to boost the
amount of calcium you get at every meal. These menus include not only dairy
products but also other good sources of calcium, such as canned fish that
has been processed with its bones intact and certain leafy green vegetables.
Breakfast
1 cup honeydew melon cubes
1 cup lowfat coffee-flavored yogurt sprinkled with 1⁄4 cup high-fiber cereal
Lunch
2 slices light bread toast
2 ounces reduced-fat cheddar cheese or 3 ounces sardines canned in
water, broth, or tomato sauce
1 cup broccoli florets
Dinner
1 cup cooked pasta tossed with 1 teaspoon olive oil and topped with 1
ounce grated Romano cheese
2 cups steamed kale with lemon
Snack
1⁄2 cup chocolate pudding or chocolate-flavored yogurt
144
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Fruit fast day
This day isn’t exactly a day of fasting, but just a fruit-filled day that shows
you a variety of ways fresh fruit and fruit products can add flavor to other
foods and be served at every meal.
Breakfast
1⁄4 cantaloupe
1 slice light whole-grain toast with 2 tablespoons apple butter
1⁄2 cup fruit-flavored lowfat yogurt
Lunch
1⁄2 cup fruit salad
1⁄2 cup pineapple cottage cheese
6 wheat crackers
Dinner
2 cups spinach leaves topped with 1⁄2 cup grapefruit sections
3 ounces pork loin chop or chicken breast simmered in 1⁄4 cup orange juice
1⁄2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 cup steamed broccoli
Snack
1 cup sliced banana and blueberries
Grazing day
Today you break your calorie allowance up into 6 mini-meals, eating the same
amount of food you normally eat, but eating more often than usual. Doing so
is a good solution if you find yourself getting hungry and tempted to overeat
in between meals.
Breakfast
1 cup raisin bran
1⁄2 cup skim milk
145
Chapter 7: Pulling through Your Plan’s First Few Months

Snack
2 mini blueberry muffins
1⁄2 cup skim milk
Lunch
2 ounces reduced-fat cheese
1⁄2 apple, sliced
4 wheat crackers
Snack
1 cup snow peas or green beans
1 tablespoon light ranch dressing (for dip)
Dinner
1 cup beef vegetable soup
1 thin slice Italian bread
2 cups green salad with 1 tablespoon light dressing
Snack
3 cups light popcorn
1⁄2 cup cranberry juice diluted with 1 cup seltzer or club soda
Snack day
Unlike the grazing day in the previous section, where you plan to eat six mini-
meals instead of three regular meals, this day consists of normal sized meals
designed to include chips, dips, crackers, and other favorite snack foods.
This day shows how you can fit a few potato chips and a frozen fruit pop into
a low-calorie diet plan.
Be careful with this day! It only works when you have enough willpower to eat
small amounts of snack foods. Even if you’re feeling strong enough to meet the
challenge, don’t tempt yourself by buying big bags of junk food and leaving
them around the house. When you shop for this day, buy only individual-size
bags of snack foods, or portion out what you need and give the rest away —
immediately!
When you choose the more sensible snack foods that are available — potato
chips that are baked instead of fried, chips and puffs that are made with
healthier fats (such as canola oil or olive oil), air-popped popcorn instead of
146
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

oil-popped, canned fruits packed in juice or light syrup rather than in heavy
syrup, frozen fruit bars instead of fruit-flavored ice pops — you can easily jus-
tify including them in a low-calorie diet. Just remember that these munchies
are still snack foods and they generally don’t contribute any important nutri-
ents to your diet. That’s why nutrition experts recommend that you eat them
in small amounts.
The key to including snack foods in your diet is to have enough other, health-
ier foods available and ready to eat so you’re not as tempted to eat more than
a small serving of less nutritious foods. Make sure you have a glass of water
with your meal because it helps fill you up as well. The less room you have
in your stomach by the time you get to the chips, the less tempted you’ll be
to overindulge.
Breakfast
1 cup dry cereal
1⁄2 cup skim milk
1⁄2 cup canned mandarin oranges
Lunch
2 ounces sliced honey-baked ham
1⁄3 cup coleslaw
12 baked potato chips
Dinner
1 cup tomato soup topped with 1⁄2 cup air-popped or light popcorn
3 ounces lean beef
1 cup steamed zucchini
Snack
1 frozen fruit pop
Shake it up day
If a liquid diet appeals to you, today is your day! You can enjoy delicious
shakes and smoothies from morning to night. The recipes yield a single serv-
ing, but you can make double, triple, or quadruple batches if you’re sharing
with family or friends, or you want to keep a second serving on hand for the
next day. (See Chapter 12 for additional smoothie recipes.)
147
Chapter 7: Pulling through Your Plan’s First Few Months

Breakfast
Orange Creme Eye Opener: In a large glass, stir together 1⁄2 cup orange
juice and 1⁄2 cup lowfat vanilla yogurt until blended. Add ice, if you prefer.
1 small corn muffin
Lunch
Berry Good Shake: In a very large glass, stir together 1 cup cranberry-
raspberry juice, 1⁄2 cup apple cider, and 1⁄3 cup lowfat plain yogurt.
3 wheat crackers
Dinner
Tangy Tomato Smoothie: In a blender, combine 1⁄4 cup lowfat plain yogurt
and 1 cup stewed tomatoes or seasoned, diced tomatoes in juice. Whirl
until smooth. Serve over cracked ice.
3 ounces skinless roast chicken breast
1⁄2 cup cooked rice
1 cup steamed asparagus with sweet red peppers
Snack
Mocha Freeze: In a blender, combine 1⁄2 cup cold coffee, 1 tablespoon
“light” chocolate syrup, 1⁄2 cup skim milk, and a couple of crushed ice
cubes. Whirl until smooth.

The New York dieter’s special
If you happen to have grown up in or around
New York City, you know what a chocolate egg
cream is, and it may even be on your list of all-
time favorite soda-fountain foods. To the unini-
tiated, however, an egg cream can be
off-putting, tasting like nothing more than
watered down, carbonated chocolate milk. I’ve
heard that opinion, and respect it, but as a New
Yorker who grew up drinking chocolate egg
creams, I’m thrilled to have discovered this 100-
calorie version. Try it and see what you think.
In an 8-ounce glass, stir together 1⁄4 cup skim
milk and 2 tablespoons “light” chocolate syrup
until well mixed. Slowly, fill the glass with seltzer
or club soda. There you have it!
For anyone who drinks diet sodas, you can
make an egg creamlike drink that many choco-
late-loving dieters seem to favor. Pour 1 cup of
skim milk into a very tall glass. Fill the glass with
diet chocolate soda. Enjoy!

Salad day
At each meal you have a salad, but this day isn’t an all-green day! Breakfast is a
mix of fresh fruit, and lunch is Greek salad, which is usually sprinkled with feta
cheese and sometimes served with olives and stuffed grape leaves. For dinner,
the usual fare is tossed together to make a salad of warm sliced meat served
over cool crisp greens with tomatoes and onions. You don’t even need salad
dressing. Try the same thing another night with roast pork, shrimp, or poultry.
Breakfast
1 cup mixed fruit salad
1 small pumpkin raisin muffin
Lunch
11⁄2 cups Greek salad
1 mini breadstick
Dinner
3 ounces grilled steak over 1 cup shredded romaine lettuce greens with 1⁄2
cup finely chopped tomato and 1⁄3 cup sliced red onion
1 thin slice Italian bread
Snack
3⁄4 cup cucumber-yogurt salad
International food day
You can handle this day in several different ways. You can eat out or eat in.
You can stick to one cuisine all day or mix it up, as in the following menu. The
idea is to have fun with it. This menu includes a Mexican breakfast, Middle
Eastern lunch, Asian snack, and an Italian dinner. These are some of
America’s favorite ethnic foods.
Breakfast
1 serving Huevos Rancheros (see Chapter 12 for the recipe)
1⁄2 cup sliced mango
149
Chapter 7: Pulling through Your Plan’s First Few Months

Lunch
1 cup lentil soup
1⁄3 cup hummus
1 toasted mini (4 inch) pita
Dinner
1 cup minestrone soup
1 cup linguine with clam sauce
Snack
2 small almond cookies
1 cup jasmine tea
Dessert day
Years ago, I saw a chocolate lover’s cookbook written by a physician who had
what I considered a brilliant strategy for chocoholics trying to lose weight.
According to his plan, you could eat something chocolate and low-cal about
half an hour before each meal. The doctor’s rationale was that you never
deprive yourself, you get your chocolate fix three times a day, and eating the
chocolate half an hour before a meal allows enough time for your stomach to
send a signal to your brain that you’ve been fed, so you’re not ravishingly
hungry when it comes time to eat your meal and you’re more satisfied with
the amount of food you’re limited to on a low-calorie diet.
Following the good doctor’s lead, this menu plan puts something sweet into
every meal. You can decide whether it makes more sense for you to have it
before or after your meal.
Breakfast
6 ounces hot chocolate
1 small (4-inch) pancake
1 tablespoon light syrup
1⁄2 cup sliced strawberries
Lunch
2 chocolate drop candies
1 large vegetable salad with 2 tablespoons light salad dressing
150
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Sandwich with 2 ounces sliced turkey, 2 slices light bread, and 1 table-
spoon reduced-calorie mayonnaise
1⁄2 cup baby carrot sticks
Dinner
1 thin (2-inch) slice angel food cake
1⁄2 cup raspberries
1 cup cooked pasta with 2 teaspoons pesto sauce
1 cup tomato salad with 1 tablespoon light salad dressing
Snack
1 small oatmeal-raisin cookie
1⁄2 cup skim milk
Wine with dinner day
By using your snack calories and borrowing a few calories here and there
from each meal, you can fit an alcoholic drink or two into a low-calorie diet
plan from time to time.
Breakfast
1 small toasted bran muffin
2 teaspoons fruit spread
1⁄2 cup skim milk
Lunch
2 cups mixed green salad with 1 tablespoon light dressing
2 ounces reduced-fat cheddar cheese
2 saltine crackers
1⁄2 cup orange sections
Dinner
1 (5-ounce) glass red or white wine
4 ounces broiled salmon
1 cup steamed broccoli tossed with 1⁄2 cup chopped tomato
1 mini breadstick
151
Chapter 7: Pulling through Your Plan’s First Few Months

Most health experts believe that drinking alcoholic beverages in moderation —
defined as one drink a day for women and two for men — probably won’t harm
your health and may even help. If you enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, a beer
when you’re eating outdoors, or a cordial at the end of a long day, your low-
calorie diet doesn’t have to get in the way. You can use your snack calories. In
Table 7-1, you find out what counts as one drink, and how many calories that
drink accounts for.

You probably don’t need me or anyone else to tell you what’s wrong with
drinking too much alcohol, but just remember that too much alcohol can
increase your risk of developing liver disease, high blood pressure, heart dis-
ease, certain types of cancer, and brain damage. You’re also at higher risk of
having an accident, getting arrested, and dying from any number of causes.
You also increase your chances of gaining weight from alcohol and some of
the mixers used to flavor it. If you substitute alcohol calories for food calo-
ries, you may not gain weight, but you’ll miss out on some very important
nutrients and you’re likely to become ill.
Fast-food day
This menu plan is based on the types of food found in most fast-food restau-
rant chains so that you can go into any chain in your area and choose food
that fits into your diet. This menu shows you how any meal at a fast-food
restaurant can fit into your low-calorie diet plan if you limit the amount of
food you eat.
152
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Choose water or another calorie-free beverage to have with your meal. (If you
add milk to your coffee or tea, keep it to a splash!) If you think you’ll give in
to the temptation to eat more, pick up your food to go.
The best tip I can give you overall for making smart choices in fast-food
restaurants is this: “Think small!” Many fast-food main dish salads, such as
chicken caesar, chef, or BLT salads, contain between 600 and 800 calories per
serving and sometimes more. One way to enjoy this type of salad, or other
higher-calorie fare like fried fish and chips, a large hero sandwich, a deluxe
double burger with the works, or any larger entree that comes in one-size
only, is to split a single serving with someone else and have a side salad with
light or fat-free dressing on the side.
Breakfast
1 egg on a muffin, biscuit, roll, or half bagel
Coffee or tea with just a splash of milk
If you want egg and cheese, discard half the bread, whether it’s a biscuit, roll,
muffin, or toast and eat your breakfast sandwich open-face.
Lunch
1 slice pizza or 1 taco or 1 soft taco or 1 small grilled chicken sandwich or
1 small hamburger
153
Chapter 7: Pulling through Your Plan’s First Few Months
Keeping score at fast-food restaurants
The only people who go to fast-food restaurant
chains to eat veggie burgers and tossed salads
are people who wouldn’t be there to begin with
if they weren’t accompanying small children or
hungry friends and relatives who aren’t watch-
ing their weight. If you’re headed for one of the
chain restaurants by your own choice, you’re
either going to cheat on your diet or you’ve been
starving yourself and banking calories all day to
earn that superburger you’re about to devour.
(Unless, of course, you’re strictly following the
fast-food menu plan in this chapter.)
Most fast-food chains provide nutrition infor-
mation in their stores and on their Web sites, so
if you really want to know the specific calorie
count of the double deluxe cheeseburger you’re
craving, check the nutritional listing. Ask for the
information and look at it before you order. It
may make you think twice. (For calorie counts
on select fast-food fare, flip to Appendix A.)
Unless you’re sharing, watch out for any burger,
sandwich, or other entree with the words
Market Fresh, Ultimate, Deluxe, Whopper-size,
Thick, Triple, Supreme, or Meat Lover’s in its
title, or any food that’s served in a basket. The
same goes for anything that resembles a shake,
malt, doughnut, biscuit, or curly fry. When it
comes to condiments, ask for reduced-calorie
sauces, mayonnaise, and salad dressings.

If you want to eat a cheeseburger, discard half the bun and eat the burger like
an open-face sandwich.
Dinner
1 small (3-inch) piece batter-dipped fish or chicken breast
3-inch corn on the cob
1 side salad with light or fat-free dressing
If you’re in a fast-food restaurant that only serves fish sandwiches, discard
the bread or choose grilled fish over batter-dipped.
Snack
1⁄2 cup soft serve ice cream
Convenience food day
Unlike a fast-food day, where you go out to fast-food restaurants to get your
meals, a convenience food day is a day when you’re cooking your meals at
home, but you don’t really feel like cooking. On this day you can take advan-
tage of canned, bottled, frozen, packaged, and fresh-prepared foods found in
any supermarket. Check out the listings in Chapter 5 for other convenience
foods that fit into a low-calorie diet plan.
Breakfast
1 cup skim milk mixed with 1 package breakfast powder mix
1 cup cut-up watermelon
Lunch
1 cup cheese tortellini
2 tablespoons marinara sauce
2 mini breadsticks
Dinner
2 ounces rotisserie chicken
1⁄2 cup spinach soufflé, from frozen
1⁄2 cup baby carrots
Snack
3⁄4 cup pears in light syrup

 Understanding the many benefits of exercise
 Finding time to work out
 Getting physical with aerobics and strength training
 Including extra activities in your routine
 Improving your mental health with mind-body exercises
 Knowing when to quit
“D
o I have to?” are words I hear more often than not when I recom-
mend more exercise to someone who wants to lose weight. Some
people even make faces at me and beg for menu plans low enough in calories
that they can deal with their weight strictly by dieting. Sorry for the bad
news, but diet and exercise go hand in hand. Unfortunately, you can’t have
one without the other.
Many people certainly try to lose weight with only diet or exercise, but you
probably won’t have any long-term success with weight control unless you
pay attention to both the number of calories you consume and what you do
to burn off those calories. That’s why you need to incorporate both diet and
exercise into your new low-calorie lifestyle.
You can live a low-cal lifestyle to maintain a healthier weight throughout your
life, but unless you’re an especially tiny person, you can’t stay on a strict low-
calorie diet (of less than 1,200 to 1,500 calories) forever. And you shouldn’t.
The point of your new lifestyle isn’t to eat less and less food or spend the rest
of your life worrying about how many calories are in one food or another. Nor
is the point to exercise yourself into a state of exhaustion to try to make up
for an eating binge. Doing so is almost impossible anyway, because it can take
hours of exercise to work off the calories from that pint of ice cream or triple

deluxe cheeseburger that took only minutes to eat! And who has the time
anyway? Your higher goal is to discover how to enjoy eating by finding a 
comfortable balance between the amount of food you eat, or the calories you
consume, and the activity you do on a regular basis to burn those calories.
If you haven’t already developed an exercise plan, or if you need to improve on
your usual routine, this chapter can help you form better physical habits. Just
remember that this chapter is a fitness overview. It doesn’t include everything
you need to know about working out and staying fit. However, you can find
solid, basic information and the encouragement to kick-start an exercise rou-
tine. For more complete information on exercise and its role in weight control,
pick up a copy of Fitness For Dummies by Suzanne Schlosberg and Liz Neporent
(Wiley). If ever there was a good “companion” book to this one, that’s it.
If you’re older than 40, if you have any type of health problem, or if you plan
to intensify your current program, check with your doctor. Even if you haven’t
been diagnosed with a medical condition, you need to alert your doctor of any
chest pains, back or leg pains, dizziness, or wheezing or breathlessness you
experience during or after any mild exertion.
Recognizing the Advantages
of Different Kinds of Exercise
Exercise boosts your metabolic rate, or the rate at which you burn calories.
Burning calories is especially important when you’re on a low-calorie diet
because, when you start to eat a lot less food than you normally eat, your
body goes into a state known as starvation mode. Your metabolic rate slows
down because your body doesn’t know you’re on a low-calorie diet. For all
your body knows, you could be about to starve. In fact, your body is trying to
conserve energy in case it doesn’t get enough fuel, and thus it’s not able to
burn calories as efficiently. Exercise helps counter this effect.
Physical activity helps keep you fit, and when you’re fit, you look and feel
your best. The more fit you are, the better you’re able to work, play, think,
and even relax. When you’re healthy and in good physical and mental shape,
you often feel as though you have energy to spare and you’re better able to
focus on everything you do and enjoy every aspect of your life.
In the following sections, I explain the two basic types of exercise and tell you
about the physical and psychological benefits of each one.
156
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Distinguishing between aerobic 
and anaerobic exercise
Exercise helps you lose weight and maintain weight loss because it uses up
excess calories that would otherwise be stored in your body as fat. Obviously,
the amount of exercise you need to control your weight depends on the
amount of food you eat as well as the amount and type of exercise. To lose
weight, and then to maintain your weight loss, you have to find your own bal-
ance between the amounts of food you eat and your amount of exercise. The
more rigorous the activity, the more calories you’ll burn. However, don’t think
you have to knock yourself out with intense exercise every day just to stay in
shape. Intense workouts help burn fat while you’re exercising, but in the long
run, steady, moderate exercise is more effective at burning calories than super-
intense workouts because moderate activity burns a higher percentage of calo-
ries overall.
There are two types of exercise: aerobic and anaerobic.
 Aerobic means “with oxygen.” Aerobic exercise, such as running, biking,
stepping, spinning, and fast dancing, helps get necessary oxygen into
your body cells. While you’re doing aerobic exercises, you’re burning
excess calories.
 Anaerobic, or nonaerobic, means “without oxygen.” Anaerobic exer-
cises, such as slow walking, bowling, or strength training with weights,
are important to your overall fitness level, but they generally don’t help
your body burn excess calories while you’re performing the exercise.
Different types of exercise affect different parts of your body and have different
effects on your health. That’s why cross training, or incorporating a variety of
exercises into your workout routine, is so important. In that way, exercising is
similar to eating: You want as much balance and variety in your daily life as
possible. Different types of exercise affect different body parts, and each plays
a role in losing weight and maintaining a healthy weight. (See “Putting Together
a Safe and Effective Exercise Plan,” later in this chapter for more details.)
Exploring the physical benefits of exercise
Exercise does a ton more for you than just burn excess calories to help you
lose weight. Aerobic exercises have terrific cardiovascular benefits, while
anaerobic exercises benefit your muscle groups, bones, and joints. Some of
the benefits also cross over. For instance, both aerobic and anaerobic exer-
cises help you sleep better and reduce your blood pressure. Both play huge
roles in weight control.
157
Chapter 8: Working Out and Working the Weight Off

Following are many of the potential physical benefits of aerobic and anaero-
bic exercise.
Aerobic exercises improve your health by
 Boosting your energy level by building cardio-respiratory endurance
 Conditioning your heart
 Controlling your appetite
 Reducing your risk of developing certain types of cancer and other
chronic diseases
 Regulating your hormones
 Lengthening your life
Anaerobic exercises improve your health by
 Bolstering your posture, joint health, and flexibility
 Building up muscle strength and endurance
 Helping you sleep better
 Reducing your blood pressure
 Strengthening your bones
Examining the psychological
benefits of exercise
Over time, regular aerobic and anaerobic exercise can have as many positive
effects on your mental health as it does on your physical health. The follow-
ing are some of the benefits:
 Building confidence
 Diffusing anger
 Encouraging other positive lifestyle changes
 Enhancing your ability to deal with stress
 Improving your overall sense of well-being
 Increasing your self-esteem
 Lessening anxiety
 Lifting depression
 Reducing the effects of stress
 Stabilizing your moods

Fitting Exercise into Your Life
The No. 1 excuse people give for not exercising is lack of time. They say they
don’t have time in their hectic schedules to go to a gym on a regular basis,
and they don’t have time to work out at home. However, don’t you find it
funny that although many people can’t find enough time to work out, they
always find time to eat?
What you really have to find is the motivation to make a commitment to some
type of regular exercise. When you’re motivated, you find the time. To get your-
self on a path to fitness, use the same motivators you use to stay on a diet (see
Chapter 4 for more about finding motivation). To start with, focus on the many
ways exercise can improve your health and make it easier to stick to a low-cal
lifestyle. Include the way it will make you look and feel about yourself.
Before you actually start an exercise program, remember this: Everyone’s
appropriate level of fitness is different, depending on age, gender, heredity,
health condition, and individual eating and exercising habits. To improve your
fitness level, you have to focus on the factors that you can control, such as
your eating and exercise habits and your attitude toward food and physical
activity. That’s where you have the power to make significant changes.
People who don’t have weight problems and people who are successful at
losing weight and maintaining that weight loss are usually people who not only
watch what they eat, but also get some type of exercise on a regular basis.
In order to get yourself on track and stay there, you need to analyze your life
and how exercise can fit into it. The following tips can help.
 If you join a gym, be sure it’s convenient to your home or workplace.
 If you need other people to help you stay motivated, find a gym buddy
or a running partner or join a group exercise activity.
 When you can’t do any type of formal exercise, try to walk more, use the
stairs more, and generally move about more throughout your day. Vary
your exercise routine and challenge yourself from time to time to keep it
interesting.
 Use the reward system. (Flip to Chapter 7 for ideas on how to reward
yourself for a workout well done!)
 Hire a certified personal trainer through a local gym or a personal refer-
ral. Until you become more accountable to yourself, you may need to
report to someone else. A professional trainer knows just how far to
push you and can help you push yourself. A trainer can also instruct you
how to be most efficient with your workout time.
In the following sections, I give you tips on setting up a regular workout
schedule, increasing your amount of exercise, and adding some activity to
your daily routine.
159
Chapter 8: Working Out and Working the Weight Off

Easing into an exercise routine
Just as you manage your low-calorie diet by setting goals for changing your
eating habits and losing a certain number of pounds in a certain period of time,
you need to manage your fitness program by setting exercise goals. (You can
read more about goal setting in Chapter 4.) Your first short-term goal may just
be to sit down and start setting goals. After that, your goal may be to join a
gym this week or to take your first brisk walk tonight after dinner. After you
establish the type of exercises you’re going to do and when, your next set of
goals needs to focus on how much time you want to spend on each exercise,
how many repetitions you want to do, how fast you want to go, and so forth.
To help turn sporadic attempts at exercise into a real fitness routine, start by
picking a time of day that’s best for you to exercise. For most people, that time
means early in the morning, during a lunch hour, or right after work. You can
start off exercising just two or three days a week, if that’s all you can manage.
If you’re new to formal exercise, start slow and work in a few more minutes of
activity every day until you build up to a full routine. Start with a 10-minute
walk, a 10-minute swim, or 10 minutes on the stair climber. If it’s 10 minutes
more than you were doing before, then you’re making a great start! Later that
same day, see if you can fit in another 10 minutes of similar activity.
A good long-term exercise goal is to get 30 minutes or more of steady, moder-
ate exercise at least 5 days a week. At times, however, you may have to break
those 30 minutes up and get your exercise in 5- or 10-minute spurts through-
out the day. That’s better than no exercise at all, and in fact, some researchers
now think that shorter bouts of activity repeated throughout the day can have
at least an equal effect on metabolism as one continuous exercise session,
especially in people who don’t exercise on a regular basis.
Too much exercise too soon can be more harmful than helpful, so if you
haven’t been exercising recently, start slow. Normally sedentary people who
suddenly get up and exert themselves are among those at high risk of dying
from a heart attack. Gradually build up your fitness level. Walk before you
run, and bike slowly before you race. Do 10 minutes of exercise a day the first
week, build up to 20 minutes the second week, and so on.
Organizing your workout schedule
After you have established some sort of exercise routine, and you feel com-
fortable adding to it, you can start setting your sights a little higher. A good
workout schedule includes
160
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

 Ten minutes of warm-up exercises at the beginning of every workout
 Thirty minutes or more of ongoing aerobic exercise at least three times
a week
 Twenty minutes of weight lifting at least twice a week
 Thirty minutes of calisthenics, sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups, and weight-
bearing exercises at least three times a week to build up muscular
endurance
 Ten minutes of cooling-down exercises at the end of every workout
 Ten minutes of gentle stretching, which can follow your warm-up exer-
cises or be incorporated into your cooling-down exercises
For more about these workout elements, see “Putting Together a Safe and
Effective Exercise Plan” and “Exercising Additional Workout Options,” later in
this chapter.
Interval training, which means alternating between high intensity and low
intensity activity, is a great exercise technique when you can’t fully commit to
an aerobic exercise. You burn extra calories because you boost your meta-
bolic rate during short bursts of intense exercise without having to commit
to a full hour of high sweat. For example, say you’re walking or riding a bike
for your daily exercise. First you warm up at a slow pace for about 10 min-
utes. Then you move into a brisk walk or speed up your cycling for a minute
or two, and then slow down to a more moderate pace until you fully catch
your breath. Repeat this cycle at regular intervals, taking as much time to
catch your breath before you go back to full speed. Remember to cool down
when you’re done. Besides helping you burn more calories, interval training
helps you work up to more intense activity and it can alleviate boredom,
which can help keep you exercising longer.
Although some people have a problem with overexercising (and you can read
more about exercising too much in “Knowing How Much Exercise Is Too
Much,” later in this chapter), many more have a problem with not exercising
enough. Studies have shown that people who say they have a hard time losing
weight tend to overestimate their amount of exercise by as much as 50 percent
(and at the same time, underestimate the amount of food they eat by almost as
much). That’s why consistent record keeping is an important weight-loss tool.
To keep consistent records, you can use an exercise log like the one in
Figure 8-1 in two different ways:
 You can create an advance workout plan for the week and write down
your exercise goals (see Chapter 4 for more about setting these goals).
 You can simply keep a record of how much exercise you do each day
and track your progress.
161
Chapter 8: Working Out and Working the Weight Off

Figure 8-1 gives you an idea of what a basic exercise log looks like. The follow-
ing easy steps can help you fill out your own daily exercise log.
1. In the first column, write down the date.
2. In the next column, write down the actual exercise you did or plan
to do.
3. Next, write down the category that particular exercise falls into.
Knowing this information helps you make sure your exercise plan has
enough variety to cover different muscle groups and different body
parts throughout the week.
4. In the last column, write down how long you exercised, how far
you went, how fast you went, or how many sets or repetitions you
completed.
You can add additional columns, such as a column for calories burned
with each aerobic exercise if you have that information, steps walked if
you use a pedometer, or even a column for jotting down any motivational
tips or workout advise you come across.
Increasing activity in your 
everyday routine
Are you a little intimidated by all the muscleheads and sweaty 20-somethings
in your local gym? Don’t worry. You don’t have to set foot inside a gym to
incorporate more exercise into your lifestyle. The following are just four
examples:
 Turn your commuting time into exercise time. If you normally drive or
take public transportation to work or school, consider walking, cycling,
scooting, or skating.

Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

 Get a dog. Dogs need to be walked several times a day, and if you get the
right kind of dog, he’ll need to run as well. Take him to the park and run
with him.
 Do it yourself. The price you pay for hired help may be higher than you
think. Housework, gardening, lawn maintenance, and home repairs are
all calorie-burning, strength-building, and flexibility-increasing activities.
The more physical work you do around the house, the more calories you
burn and the more fit you’ll be.
 Take fitness vacations. Next time you plan a trip, consider a fitness
option. You can choose from any number of spa vacations, hiking trips,
mountain climbing trips, yoga retreats, and cross-country skiing vaca-
tions, to name just a few fitness-oriented escapes.
Putting Together a Safe and
Effective Exercise Plan
When you exercise to lose weight, you’re trying to hold on to calorie-burning
muscle while you lose unwanted fat. In order to accomplish this, you need to
exercise all your body parts and not just the ones that you don’t like! The
more muscle mass you have, the higher your metabolic rate, the stronger you
are, and the easier it is to stay active and become even more active.
Sticking to an exercise plan is much easier if you choose activities you enjoy.
If you like group activities, you can choose numerous activities including
taking classes at a gym, joining a bowling league, playing other team sports,
finding a tennis partner, or joining a bike club or hiking group. If exercise time
is time you’d rather spend alone, then walking, jogging, swimming, and bike
riding may be more your style. The best exercise for you is the one that you’ll
actually do!
In the following sections, I explain the importance of warming up before you
exercise and cooling down afterwards, give you more details about aerobics,
and provide a few ideas on strength-building activities to try.
Warming up, cooling down, and
other workout essentials
The point of exercise is to get and stay healthy, not to hurt yourself! Warm-up
exercises such as walking, slow jogging, slow biking, and arm and leg rota-
tions reduce your risk of injury by sending blood to your muscles and con-
nective tissue to literally warm up these areas before you go into full-blown
activity. The additional blood flow increases the temperature in these areas
163
Chapter 8: Working Out and Working the Weight Off

and provides additional oxygen needed for exercise. Warm up for at least 10
minutes with body motions similar to those used in the type of exercise you
choose, so that you’re warming up the same muscles. For instance, swim a
couple of slow laps before swimming at full speed or work up to a fast walk or
slow jog before running.
A cooling-down period is just as essential to a good workout as a warm-up.
Cooling down, or gradually reducing the intensity of your workout, allows
your heartbeat to drop slowly back to a normal rate. Instead of stopping sud-
denly, you simply continue with your same workout at a slower rate. That
means bringing your run down to a slow jog, lowering the speed on your
treadmill, or slowing down your rowing action for at least 5 or 10 minutes
before you call it quits.
When you’re exercising, don’t forget to breathe regularly because holding
your breath can adversely affect your blood pressure. If you have a tendency
to hold your breath while exercising, get into the habit of frequently remind-
ing yourself to exhale. Most people get a little winded from working out, but
you don’t ever want to find yourself gasping for breath.
One of the most essential pieces of workout equipment you can own, regard-
less of what type of exercise you’re doing, is a water bottle. Carry one with
you at all times and drink from it often during your workout. Drinking water
throughout your workout not only prevents you from becoming dehydrated,
but it also fills you up on a calorie-free fluid.
Burning more calories with aerobics
In Chapter 3, I discuss the magic number for losing a pound a week, which is
3,500 calories. That is, you have to consume 3,500 fewer calories, or burn
3,500 more calories than you normally do in a week to lose one pound that
week. In numbers that are easier to swallow, you have to cut 500 calories a
day from your diet or burn 500 more calories a day through some sort of
physical activity.
But actually it doesn’t have to be an “either/or” situation. You can compro-
mise. For example, you can cut 250 calories from your daily diet and add
enough exercise to burn the other 250. Or you can cut 100 and burn 400.
Or come up with any other combination that suits your needs for the day.
That’s the beauty of dieting and exercising at the same time. If losing weight
by cutting calories means you have to be on a 1,000-calorie plan but you’d be
happier with 1,200 or 1,300 calories, no problem! Just add 300 calories worth
of exercise to your day.
Aerobic exercise is a surefire way to burn plenty of calories. The following
sections tell you how to aim for the correct heart-rate range as you work out,
show you different aerobic exercises that you can try, and give you the scoop
on just how many calories you can burn with different exercises.
164
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Targeting the right heart rate range
More important than anything else, calorie counts included, is the safety and
effectiveness of your workout. The way to measure it is simple. It’s in the
palm of your hands. Well, not quite in the palm, but up a little farther, in your
wrist. It’s called your pulse. Your pulse measures your heart rate, or your
heartbeats per minute (bpm). Your normal, resting heart rate, which is your
bpm in the morning when you first get up and before you begin your day’s
activities, needs to be between 60 and 90 bpm, give or take a few beats. Your
target heart rate, or training heart rate, may be twice that, or more. You need
to figure out this number so that when you do aerobic exercises, or any exer-
cise that gets your heart beating faster, you can determine if your workout is
safely and effectively helping you burn calories to lose weight.
Everyone has a safe and effective heart rate range (which is the number of
beats per minute your heart should be beating during intense exercise) within
which to work out. This range is 50 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate,
or the fastest your heart can beat. To estimate your maximal heart rate, you
simply subtract your age from the number 226 if you’re female or 220 if you’re
male. So, for example, if you’re a 37-year-old woman, your estimated maximal
heart rate is 189. Your target heart rate range, then, is between 95 (50 percent)
and 161 (85 percent). That information is useful but you now have to figure
out if you’re working out at a rate that puts your heartbeat in that range.
The most accurate and convenient way to determine if you’re within your
target range is with a heart monitor. (See the sidebar “Using exercise gadgets
and gizmos,” later in this chapter, for more information on this exercise tool.)
If you don’t have a heart monitor, you can count your own heartbeat. To do
so, stop exercising and immediately take your pulse at your wrist or your
neck, counting the beats for 15 seconds. Multiply that number by 4 to find
your beats per minute. If your heart is beating faster than the high end of
your target heart rate range, slow down. If it’s beating slower than the low
end of your range, you can work yourself a little harder.
For example, if you’re the same 37-year-old woman in the previous example,
and your target heart rate is between 95 and 161, then your beats per minute
must be less than 161.
When you first start a new exercise program, and especially if you’re out of
shape, you may not even be in your target heart range. At that point, your
goal is to get your heart rate up to the low end of your range (50 percent).
Your next goal is to work to the top of the range as you get fit.
Surveying aerobic activities
Any activity that brings your pulse up into your target heart rate range and
keeps it there for at least 20 minutes is an aerobic exercise. If you stop and
start again, as you do when you play basketball, you’re not getting a true 
aerobic workout because your heartbeat doesn’t stay in your target range
long enough.
165
Chapter 8: Working Out and Working the Weight Off

The following list includes activities such as running and bicycling that are
considered aerobic exercises under the right circumstances, as well as activi-
ties such as tennis and boxing, which aren’t actually aerobic, but can provide
a rigorous workout that promotes weight loss.
166

 Bike racing
 Boxing
 Cardio-stepping
 Climbing the stair climber/
step platform
 Cross-country skiing
 Cycling
 Fast dancing
 Fast walking
 Jogging
 Jumping rope
 Playing the following:
• Handball
• Racquetball
• Squash
• Tennis
 Riding a stationary bike/
recumbent bike
 Rowing
 Running
 Skating
 Spinning
 Swimming
 Using elliptical trainers
 Walking on a treadmill
Any aerobic exercise that involves running, jumping, or heavy stepping
is considered a high-impact activity that can eventually take its toll on
your knees and other joints. Exercises like swimming, cycling, rowing,
and skating, on the other hand, are low-impact aerobic workouts that
provide great cardiovascular benefits and burn a significant amount of
calories without putting stress on your bones and joints.
Calculating the number of calories you’re burning
Aerobic activities burn anywhere from 5 to 15 calories per minute,
depending on how much you weigh and the exercise’s intensity. The
more you weigh, the harder it is to perform aerobic activities, so if you
weigh more, you’ll burn more calories working out for the same
amount of time than a person who weighs less.
Table 8-1 shows the approximate number of calories burned per hour
for various activities performed by someone who weighs approximately
155 pounds. If you weigh less, you’ll burn somewhat fewer calories per-
forming the same activity for the same period of time; if you weigh
more, you’ll burn a few more.

Building your strength
Aerobic exercises increase your metabolic rate while you do them, and there-
fore increase your capacity to burn calories while you’re working out, but
they don’t necessarily build up your muscles. The more lean, healthy muscle
tissue you have in your shoulders, arms, legs, back, chest, midsection
(abdominals), legs, and butt, the more effective your body will be at burning
calories all the time. The way to build bigger and better muscles is with
strength training. Any type of exercise that involves weight resistance, either
from lifting free weights, working out on weight machines, or using your own
body as a weight, will result in better muscle health, which in turn results in a
higher metabolic rate and more efficient calorie burning.
167
Chapter 8: Working Out and Working the Weight Off

A strength-training routine becomes more important as you get older and
your metabolism naturally begins to slow down. If you don’t build up your
lean muscle tissue, it starts to wither away and becomes less metabolically
active in the process. When that process happens, you start gaining weight
even if you’re not eating any more than you ever did. Your body can no
longer burn calories at the rate it did when you were younger so if you don’t
work out, you have to eat less food to prevent weight gain.
Different types of strengthening exercises work out different muscle groups.
Squats and lunges work your legs and butt, while abdominal crunches
strengthen your midsection and back. A good goal is to exercise each muscle
group at least twice a week. Because your muscles need to recuperate after
weight training, skip a day between sessions.
The following are all considered strength-training/muscle-building exercises:
 Abs, butt, thighs classes
 Body ball exercises
 Body sculpting/strength-building sessions
 Elastic band or tube exercises
 Free weights
 Sit ups, pull ups, push ups
 Weight machines
 Yoga, pilates, t’ai chi

Fighting cellulite
Most women older than 35 are on intimate
terms with cellulite. But you may be surprised
to discover that the lumpy, bumpy, jiggly stuff on
your thighs and butt isn’t really much different
from any other fat in your body. It just looks
worse. Cellulite is much more common in
women than men because body fat is distrib-
uted differently in women. Nature took care of
that, in an effort to make fat more readily avail-
able for quick energy if needed during preg-
nancy and breastfeeding. With aging and lack
of exercise, skin also loses much of the elastic-
ity and firmness it once had to hold that layer of
fat smoothly in its place.
The only way you can fight cellulite is by main-
taining a normal weight and exercising; no
cream or scrub will do it. I’m sorry, but you can’t
deal with cellulite in any special way, and no
special therapy is available to make it disap-
pear. You can’t get rid of your cellulite without
removing fat from your body, but you may be
able to diminish its pitted appearance by dieting
to lose some of your body fat, doing aerobic
exercise on a regular basis to burn stored fat,
and building up your muscles with weight train-
ing to help hold your skin more taut.

Whether you work out at home or at a gym, always enlist the aid of a trainer
for at least several sessions when you first start weight training, to guide you
in proper form, check your breathing, verify that you’re using the appropriate
amount of weight, provide safety precautions, and make sure you get the best
benefit from your workout. Ultimately, you’ll be able to gauge for yourself
whether you’re lifting the right amount of weight by evaluating the effort it
takes to lift a certain weight at least eight times. Generally, if you have to give
up before you get to eight, you’re lifting too much. If you get to 12 repetitions
and feel you could easily continue, you probably need to add more weight.
Somewhere in between lies the appropriate amount of weight. To help pre-
vent injury and make your workout easier, always remember to warm up and
cool down before and after strength training, just as you do for aerobic exer-
cise. See “Warming up, cooling down, and other workout essentials,” earlier
in this chapter for more details.
Exercising Additional Workout Options
The more you move about in your day-to-day life, the more calories you burn.
Someone who fidgets a lot, who gets up and down from her desk and paces
around throughout the workday, and generally can’t sit still for very long, can
burn up to several hundred calories more in a day than someone who sits
very still. Any physical activity you do — gardening, walking, house cleaning,
mowing the lawn — burns calories. The more you perform these activities,
the more they count as exercise that can help improve or maintain your fit-
ness level.
The following sections cover other exercises that you may want to include in
your routine.
Stretching out
Besides making you feel lighter and looser, a good stretch can help prevent
exercise injuries. So even though stretching technically has nothing to do
with burning calories, it’s not a waste of your time, and it warrants as much
attention as any “real” exercise when you’re developing a fitness plan.
One of the reasons exercise becomes more difficult as you get older is that
physically you become less flexible with age. Flexibility exercises (also known
as stretches) lengthen and loosen the tendons that hold your muscle to your
bone so that you’re able to stand straighter, bend easier, and walk with a
longer stride. Stretching can also help alleviate the back and leg pain that
prevents some people from doing as much exercise as they could.
169
Chapter 8: Working Out and Working the Weight Off

Never warm up or cool down with stretches. Begin your workout session
with warm-up exercises and end with cooling down exercises that are appro-
priate to the activity. (See “Warming up, cooling down, and other workout
essentials,” earlier in this chapter for details.) Many types of exercises, such
as yoga and balance balls, incorporate stretches, and that may be enough for
you if you practice these activities on a regular basis. If you’re adding
stretches to your routine, however, add them just after you cool down from a
rigorous workout, while your muscles are still warm and your heartbeat has
fallen back down to the bottom of your target range.
Walking tall
Every fitness expert recommends walking because, if nothing else, it’s some-
thing that anyone with working feet can do, regardless of individual lifestyle or
athletic prowess. Walking is an especially good exercise option for anyone
who, right now, can’t picture herself at the gym in leotards balanced on an
elliptical trainer or spinning herself into a frenzy. Walking is also a good choice
for anyone who lives near any types of trails, stretches of beach, or parks.
When you walk, you can actually do it the right way or the wrong way. If
you’re going to make walking your primary source of physical activity and
start walking longer distances, check the tips that follow to ensure you’re
doing it right. Start by developing a walking routine, just as you would
develop any other exercise routine, by picking a time of day that’s good for
you to walk most days of the week. (See “Easing into an exercise routine,”
earlier in this chapter for more info.) Consider walking to work, school, or
another regular destination, to incorporate exercise into your normal every-
day routine. Aim to increase the amount of time you spend walking as well as
the distance you go and the speed at which you walk.
To keep your walking routine interesting, walk in different directions than you
normally go and walk on different types of terrain. Walking uphill burns more
calories and helps you work different muscle groups than walking on a
straight path, so seek out opportunities. The following list includes some
additional tips for walkers.
 Buy good quality sneakers or walking shoes that fit properly.
 Walk tall; don’t slouch!
 Warm up with a slow walk and pick up speed until you get to a brisk walk.
 Keep your arms relaxed and slightly bent at the elbows. Swing them
gently as you walk.
 Carry a water bottle and sip from it often.
 Cool down for 5 or 10 minutes by gradually slowing down.
170
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

 Aim to gradually increase both the amount of time you spend walking
and the distance you cover. If walking is your primary physical activity,
gradually increase the distance you walk and the pace at which you walk
over the course of a couple of months, until you’re walking briskly for at
least 30 minutes most days.
 Invest in a pedometer, which measures how far you’ve walked and
gives you a basis for challenging yourself to walk longer and farther.
Pedometers are available in all sporting goods stores and in the sporting
goods section of most department stores. (See the nearby sidebar “Using
exercise gadgets and gizmos” for details on this and other exercise tools.)
Standing burns more calories than sitting, and even very slow walking burns
more calories than standing still. Choosing to move at every opportunity can
help you burn up to 50 percent more calories than if you simply stand or sit
still most of the day. That’s why, in addition to formal exercise, fitness experts
always recommend nonexercise activities, such as walking instead of driving
whenever you can, taking stairs instead of elevators or escalators, and parking
your car as far away from the mall as possible when you go shopping, so that
you have to walk a few extra steps (and burn a few more calories) to get to the
stores.
Finding alternative ways to burn calories
You burn calories all the time, even when you’re eating. You burn calories
working around the house, but unless you spend the entire day cleaning or
repairing homes, housework won’t make a huge contribution to your fitness
level.
Hard work can be fun if you like what you do. So if you don’t like going to a
gym, you don’t like jogging, and you can’t think of anything else to do in the
way of formal exercise, then think about what you like to do that involves
some level of physical activity. The following are a few examples:
 Play basketball or handball with the neighborhood kids or volunteer to
coach a little league team on weekends.
 If you watch television on a regular basis, invest in fitness equipment
that keeps you moving in front of the tube. It may be as simple as a jump
rope or a body ball, or as major as a treadmill or stationary bike.
 If you like to dance, take dance classes or just get out there and boogie.
If you can’t get out often, partner up with a dance video and shake it up
in your own living room.

Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 
Using exercise gadgets and gizmos
Many exercise “accessories” are available to
help you measure your fitness level, monitor your
progress, and make sure your exercise routine is
safe and effective. While many are unnecessary,
the following exercise tools can be quite helpful:
 A pedometer, which is a digital device you
attach to your waistband to keep track of
the number of steps you take, can help you
determine if you’re taking enough steps to
make a difference in your fitness level. Just
remember: When you walk, you take steps,
and the more you walk, the more steps you
take. The more steps you take, the more
calories you burn. So if you’re walking to
lose weight, it makes sense to count the
number of steps you take as a measure of
progress. A pedometer can measure the
number of steps you take.
The magic number of steps appears to be
10,000, the goal stated in many fitness arti-
cles that recommend using a pedometer for
step counting. But the truth, according to
The American College of Sports Medicine,
is that the goal varies from person to
person, and 10,000 steps, or 5 miles, a day
may not be optimal for everyone. To an
exercise walker, building up speed can be
as important as walking longer distances.
That all translates to this advice: Use your
pedometer as a motivating tool and a track-
ing tool, but not as your only goal-setting
tool. As a walker, your best fitness goal isn’t
to walk 10,000 steps, but to fit in at least 30
minutes of brisk walking on most if not all
days of the week. If you like to walk for
exercise, using a pedometer can help get
you 10,000 steps closer to that goal, give or
take a few steps. Some studies do show
that using a pedometer is a motivator and a
challenge for many people to walk more.
 During aerobic exercise you may consider
wearing a heart rate monitor to measure
the intensity of your workout and determine
whether or not you’re working hard enough
to reap cardiovascular benefits or too hard
and need to slow down. A heart rate moni-
tor eliminates the need for taking your own
pulse and figuring out your heart rate as
described in the section “Targeting the right
heart rate range,” earlier in this chapter.
 Relatively new to the gizmo scene are calo-
rie counters you can attach to your arm,
chest, or wrist to find out approximately
how many calories you’re burning while you
exercise. They’re only moderately accurate,
at best. You may have noticed that some
exercise machines have built-in calorie
counters that keep track of your burn while
you’re working out. The new calorie coun-
ters may be slightly more accurate than the
built-in counters. Some calorie counters
measure your heart rate to determine how
much oxygen you use and how much heat
you produce while exercising. Others mea-
sure your skin’s temperature and electrical
conductivity along with how much heat
you’re producing and losing while you work
out. Extra features include built-in programs
to help you keep track of calorie-burning
goals and progress.
None of this equipment can claim 100 percent
accuracy, but for adults who like their grown-up
toys, any and all of these devices can be help-
ful as motivators and tracking tools. Some gad-
gets even do double duty, measuring your heart
rate and your calorie burn at the same time, for
instance. The one thing they can’t do is lose
weight for you. That’s your job!

Exercising for Body and Mind
Some people are as motivated by the mood-elevating and stress-busting
effects of exercise as by the promise of improved physical health and weight
loss. If stressful, emotional issues are at the core of your overeating (see
Chapter 9 for more about this topic), then you stand to gain multiple benefits
from adding mind-body exercises such as yoga or t’ai chi to your fitness rou-
tine. These ancient, meditative practices are designed to improve both your
mental and physical conditions.
The proven physical benefits of mind-body exercises include improved flexi-
bility, balance, and coordination, better breathing and blood circulation, and
reduced muscle tension. These benefits can also help prevent injury when
you exert yourself during more strenuous exercises. The most often cited
psychological benefits include increased self-awareness, mental relaxation,
and a general feeling of emotional well-being.
Yoga, pilates, and t’ai chi are three different exercises with a common objec-
tive of uniting mind, body, and spirit with the goal of improving your overall
health. You don’t wear your MP3 player or watch the news while you practice
these three arts. The focus is on your inner self, not the outer world. These
prac-tices are widely recognized by medical professionals and alternative
practitioners as healthful adjuncts to a sound fitness program. Following are
brief descriptions of each:
 Yoga exercises are designed to quiet the mind in order to reduce 
psychological distress and develop more physical and emotional self-
awareness. It’s also a stretching, toning, and strengthening exercise. (If
you’re interested in finding out more about yoga, check out Yoga For
Dummies by Georg Feuerstein, Larry Payne, and Lilias Folan [Wiley].)
 Pilates exercises, which are often compared to yoga and grouped with
yoga, consist of strengthening movements that work all your body parts,
but focus on the abdomen as your core source of strength. Many pilates
floor exercises incorporate yoga-like movements. Because the intense
movements of pilates require tremendous concentration, the benefits
include a self-awareness similar to that developed by practicing yoga
and t’ai chi. (If you want more information about incorporating pilates
into your exercise program, check out Pilates For Dummies by Ellie
Herman [Wiley].)
 T’ai chi exercises promote the development of balance, alignment, and
coordination through a series of slow, graceful movements performed in
a dance-like fashion. These unique movements also promote relaxation
of body and mind. (If t’ai chi interests you, check out T’ai Chi For
Dummies by Therese Iknoian [Wiley].)
173
Chapter 8: Working Out and Working the Weight Off

Mind-body exercises were once relegated to private studios, but now they’re
often the most popular classes at most gyms and fitness clubs, so you can
find one just about anywhere. Because these formerly alternative activities
are strength building and incorporate plenty of stretching, you can substitute
one of these classes for an “abs, buns, and thighs” class or a weight-training
session once or twice a week.
Knowing How Much Exercise Is Too Much
Can there be such a thing as too much exercise in this land of couch toma-
toes? (I prefer the term couch tomato to couch potato, because it’s more real-
istic. Potatoes can sit around for months and still stay firm, until you cook
them. When tomatoes sit around, they quickly get squishy, just like a body
that doesn’t get enough exercise.) Believe it or not, sometimes you do need
to slow down your physical activity rather than keep going. One of those
times is when you begin a new exercise program. If you start off too fast or
push yourself too far at first, you may burn out, both physically and mentally,
before you finish your workout. If that happens, you could quickly lose your
motivation, or worse, hurt yourself.
Identifying the warning signs
of too much exercise
As good as exercise is for you — and it’s very good for most people — too
much can take its toll. Exercise puts physical stress on all your body parts
and can ultimately lead to permanent damage to muscles, joints, and bones
if you work too hard, too soon, or if you don’t follow recommended safety
precautions.
Even after you’ve established your workout routine and you’re comfortable
with the exercises you’re doing, sometimes you may need to slow down or
call it quits. Keep the following points in mind when exercising:
 Whenever you’re doing aerobic exercise, you should be able to carry
on a conversation at the same time. If you’re gasping for breath, feeling
faint (or dizzy), feeling any pain, or getting nauseous, slow down or take
a break.
 Anytime you’re sick, injured, or tired from lack of sleep is a good time to
take a day or two off. Just don’t let your exercise break last any longer
than it has to or you may find it very difficult to get back in the swing
of things.
174
Part II: Getting Started: The Four-Week Plan and Beyond 

Overexercising to the extreme
Believe it or not, some people become addicted to exercise in the same,
obsessive way a food addict becomes addicted to eating certain foods or a
gambler becomes addicted to games. It’s a psychological addiction, and
many experts believe that there’s probably a physiological explanation as
well. Exercise “addicts” constantly think about exercising, and they work out
frantically, every day, to burn off as many calories as they can. If you work
out more than an hour a day, seven days a week, and you’re not a profes-
sional athlete, consider that you may be exercising too much to the detri-
ment of your own health.
Overexercising can be a sign of a true eating disorder. Someone with an
eating disorder is obsessed with food, dieting, and, often, exercise. There are
several types of eating disorders, but the two that often involve overexercis-
ing are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.
 People with anorexia are underweight, extremely afraid of being fat, usu-
ally eat very little, and spend most of their time trying to purge any and
all calories they consume by vomiting, using laxatives, and exercising
excessively.
 People with bulimia are usually normal weight or overweight, often eat
excessive amounts of food, and purge or resort to extreme exercising to
burn off the extra calories they eat.
Both of these eating disorders have severe nutritional and medical conse-
quences, which in some cases can result in death. Most people who overeat
or focus a great deal of attention on their diets don’t have eating disorders,
but if you or anyone you know shows signs of an eating disorder, immediately
seek the help of a professional. You can start by calling any hospital, univer-
sity medical center, or trusted physician, who can steer you toward the
appropriate type of help.

In this part . . .
T

the best thought-out weight-loss plan. Most of these cir-
cumstances have nothing to do with your low-calorie diet,
but they have everything to do with why and how you
gain weight.
Every problem has a solution, and this part offers many.

In This Chapter

 Testing your willpower in the long run
 Handling special situations away from home
A
long the path to weight loss, you’re going to run into some inevitable
twists and turns. Sometimes you lose your motivation and have to turn
around and find it. Maybe you overindulged last night and so now you’re
thinking of giving up. Perhaps you’re bored with your routine, even though
it’s working for you. You may even get to a point where, no matter what you
do, your weight just won’t budge, even though you still need to lose 20 pounds.
You may feel frustrated and want to give up your goals. Please, don’t! You can
get your thinking and your behavior back on track. The secret to success is to
nip any problems in the bud.
Many people give up (and eventually gain back any weight they lost) when
they get thrown off track, lose momentum, or find themselves stuck in a
weight-loss rut. But you have to stand strong and renew your commitment
to losing weight and keeping it off, especially during these trying times. The
type of commitment you need when faced with dieting challenges is to see
yourself through every stage of change.
You knew changing your lifestyle wouldn’t be easy when you first decided to
lose weight, but if you had the motivation to get started on a low-calorie plan,
you can find the motivation to keep going. If you cheated on your diet last
night, one big meal or one big dessert or even an all-out binge didn’t blow
everything. If you overeat one day, all you have to do is wake up the next day
and get back on track. If you’re bored with your diet or exercise routine,
remember that you’re not stuck with it; it’s simply time for a change.

This chapter can help you solve problems common to emotional eaters. You
also find ways to cope with everyday dilemmas that are likely to occur in the
long run, regardless of the nature of your eating habits, and tips to help you
eat sensibly away from home.
Recognizing and Solving Predictable
Problems for Emotional Eaters
Food has a way of filling gaps in people’s lives. People don’t just eat to sur-
vive, which can be a big problem. People eat to kill time, to make themselves
feel better, and to distract themselves. Many people eat whenever they feel
emotional pangs, good or bad, and overeat in response to highly emotional
situations. If you’re an emotional eater, you eat when you’re happy and when
you’re sad. Eating is the way you deal with your emotions, and what’s usually
happening is that you’re overfeeding yourself to try to “stuff down” feelings
that are hard to cope with.
When solving your emotional eating problems, you need to look at the prob-
lem in two ways.
 Recognize the emotions that are driving your eating behavior. For an
emotional eater, boredom, loneliness, anger, sadness, anxiety, and every-
day frustrations are all potential roadblocks to weight-loss success.
Other situations that may cause you to turn to food for relief include
• Getting rejected. If you get passed up for a promotion or an inti-
mate relationship goes sour, you may naturally feel insecure or
unwanted and turn to food for comfort.
• Playing the martyr. When your children talk back to you, your
mate ignores you, or you feel taken for granted at work or at home,
you may eat instead of expressing your feelings of denigration.
• Feeling rebellious. Overeating may help you send out a message
that says, “Nobody tells me what to do!”
• Losing sight of your dreams. If you’re unhappy with the life you
live, or you have regrets, you may be overeating to try to make up
for not feeling satisfied or complete.
• Facing challenges. Success can be as scary as failure; you may
overeat to avoid taking that next step.
• Developing intimacy. Being overweight may help you cover up
your fear of developing an intimate relationship.
180
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

 Get to the root of the problem, one way or another. If you eat to satisfy
emotional hunger, as opposed to true physical hunger, you still have to
deal with your emotions while you’re trying to lose weight. (If you strug-
gle with emotional eating, Chapter 11 has helpful resources.)
In the following sections, I provide tips on how to handle several typical emo-
tional situations while keeping your low-calorie diet on track.
Busting boredom
When you’re bored and have nothing to do, what’s your first instinct? Do you
say “to eat”? Boredom is many a dieter’s downfall, but I have an obvious solu-
tion: Do something! Find something you enjoy doing, something you can do
on a regular basis that has nothing whatsoever to do with eating (unless, of
course, you decide to take a class in healthy cooking). Look for something
longer lasting and more fruitful, such as taking up a new hobby.
Something like knitting or cabinet making not only keeps you busy, but also
provides a reward when you’re done — a finished product! If you aren’t into
hobbies or feel you need to get out of the house, consider volunteering your
time at a hospital, museum, or school. If boredom threatens to sabotage your
weight-loss goals, check out the list of diversions suggested in Chapter 7.
Dealing with everyday frustrations
For most people, each day brings its share of aggravation, whether you’re at
work, at school, or at home. Your boss treats you badly, you don’t have time
to pack a healthy lunch, or you haven’t been able to get to the gym in a week.
How you handle frustrating situations can make the difference between diet
failure and success. Why? Because if you give in to overeating when you feel
frustrated, or if you often feel frustrated because circumstances that are
seemingly beyond your control are preventing you from eating well, you may
feel that you have no choice but to give up on your goals.
In the following sections, I provide tips on handling several common frustra-
tions so that you can stick to your low-calorie plan.
Coping with stress
Anger. Pressure. Change. Any of these stressors can drive bad eating behav-
ior. You may be eating to cope, to give yourself a treat when everything else
looks bleak, or to punish yourself. When stress (and eating from stress) gets
181
Chapter 9: Making Your Way through Trials and Tribulations

out of hand, something has to give. You have to find a way to relax and
escape the pressure you feel. You may need help. Consider the mind-body
exercises in Chapter 8 or some of the counseling options in Chapter 11.
Boosting low confidence
Self-doubt leads to self-criticism, which is known as negative self-talk. Nothing
and no one can make you feel all that bad about yourself unless you feel bad
about yourself to begin with. Review Chapter 4 for advice about positive self-
talk and how it can help you stick to your low-calorie diet plan.
One way to boost your own self-esteem is to force yourself to focus on every-
thing right about your life, rather than on everything wrong with it. At the
end of each day, look back and find at least one event that was positive.
 Look for some accomplishment, big or small. Did you buy a fitness mag-
azine? Did you eat fruit salad for lunch instead of a cheeseburger? If you
ate the cheeseburger, did you take a walk after lunch?
 Look for anything that can make you feel good about yourself and dis-
tract from the negative. It doesn’t have to have anything to do with your
diet or exercise program. Maybe you smiled at a stranger who smiled
back. Maybe you cleaned out your kitchen cabinets. Maybe someone
thanked you for a job well done. These events are all positive and life
affirming, and they deserve recognition.
If you take a few minutes every night to write down your accomplishments in
a journal, you’ll soon have a good collection of “feel-good” anecdotes to look
back on when your confidence needs a boost or when you feel like giving up
on yourself.
Handling the pressure of keeping a meal schedule
The pressure of trying to adhere to a “normal” meal schedule may actually be
sabotaging your efforts to lose weight. Most people with a history of out-of-
control eating, dieting, bingeing, and compulsive overeating benefit from a
regular meal routine, but some people just don’t fit that mold. You need a
plan, but planning three square meals at the usual times of day is fruitless if
that plan just doesn’t fit into your lifestyle.
You can always make routine eating a long-term goal. (For more about setting
goals, see Chapter 4.) For now, have a plan that suits your schedule. The trick
is to create your own routine by having the type of food you need available
wherever you are, whenever you need it. For instance, if you work late most
evenings, stock a shelf in your office or invest in a minifridge to hold foods
that can serve as dinner. You can also order an appropriate dinner from local
restaurants or delis that deliver your food (see “Dining out at restaurants,”
later in this chapter to help you eat out the right way).
182
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

Feeding your sorrow
Do you overeat because you’re unhappy, or are you unhappy because you
overeat? That’s a chicken-and-egg question if I ever heard one! If you’re an emo-
tional overeater, you probably overeat because you’re unhappy and then you
become even unhappier because you overate. If you find yourself in this state
of unhappiness for months on end, with no sign of let-up, you may be clinically
depressed. This type of deep unhappiness often leads to self-deprecation and
the type of negativity that can really block your best attempts at losing weight
and living a healthier lifestyle.
Exercise (which I cover in Chapter 8) helps with sad feelings and mild depres-
sion because it raises your levels of endorphins, brain chemicals that help
improve your general outlook. But if you think you suffer from clinical
depression, speak to your physician, who can help you decide if you need
further professional help. Chapter 11 provides more information on the type
of help that may be available to you.
Meeting Typical Long-Term Challenges
and Temptations
For most people, dieting unfortunately is one of those situations where some
things get worse before they get better. Early on, you’re motivated by hopes
and dreams, by the novelty of a new and challenging lifestyle, and I hope, by
your initial weight loss. As the weeks and months go by, however, you may
have to work harder to prevent old eating habits from sneaking back in, to
resist giving in to food cravings, and to stop yourself from all-out bingeing
to make up for all the food you haven’t been eating. The honeymoon is over
and now the real work begins.
The following sections provide tools that can help you face challenges as you
continue your low-calorie plan.
Figuring out whether you’re truly hungry
What happens when you don’t eat? You set yourself up for a binge in the not-so-
distant future. Food deprivation never helped anyone lose weight in the long
run. The trick is to figure out if you’re really hungry, and to eat just enough to
satisfy your hunger. One way to know if what you’re feeling is true physical
hunger, and not emotional hunger, is that when you’re truly hungry, you’ll feel
better by eating just about any type of food. When you’re emotionally hungry,
you usually crave very specific types of foods that you’ve used to comfort your-
self in the past. (See the following sections for more about cravings and binges.)
183
Chapter 9: Making Your Way through Trials and Tribulations

The secret to eating without overeating is to eat mindfully, which simply
means paying attention to the food you eat and how you eat it. Chapter 4 has
info on mindful eating that can help you put this technique into practice.
One component of mindful eating that dietitians and other weight experts
often use is a hunger scale, like the one that follows, that can help you deter-
mine just how hungry you are or how full you are. The scale ranges from 0 to
10, with 0 being so hungry you could eat a bucket of beans and 10 being so
overstuffed you can’t get up out of your chair. You want to avoid these
extremes by using this scale to decide when to eat and when to stop. I recom-
mend starting at 2 and stopping at 5; you may have to gradually work your
way into that range.
0 Extremely hungry
1 Very hungry
2 Hungry
3 Slightly hungry
4 No longer hungry but not yet full
5 Comfortable
6 Beginning to feel full
7 Beginning to feel too full
8 Uncomfortable
9 Very uncomfortable with a slight stomachache
10 Extremely overstuffed and uncomfortable; possibly nauseous
Whenever you’re following a low-calorie diet and you feel hungry, you need
to eat. Period. Don’t give it a second thought. Better yet, try not to let your-
self get to the point where you actually feel hungry. Eat something.
If you’re an emotional eater — someone who eats when you’re excited, angry,
distressed — you may turn to food when you’re not really hungry. Your chal-
lenge (and something to keep in mind the next time you’re updating your psy-
chological and behavior goals — see Chapter 4) is to wait until you really feel
hungry before you put anything in your mouth. Easier said than done, I know,
but try these few tips:
 Try to express your feelings with words rather than with food. Write
down your feelings if you’re not in a position to speak them.
 Start walking in the opposite direction of any food source. The walk does
you good and the food is less accessible.
 Set a timer or watch the clock and wait ten minutes to see if the urge to
eat passes.

Satisfying cravings
When you get a craving, you’re probably not craving a cucumber salad or a
lean slice of chicken. Cravings are usually reserved for foods high in sugar, fat,
or salt, or some combination of the three. Studies have shown that women are
more likely to crave sugar-fat combinations like chocolate cake while men
crave protein-fat combos like meat. Surveys have also revealed that, overall,
salty foods, breads, and sweet foods top the most-often-craved list.
The hungrier you are, the more you yearn for foods that you may not other-
wise be craving. To help control cravings, make sure you eat something every
three to five hours.
If you’ve been depriving yourself of your favorite foods, chances are you’re
craving them all the time. If that’s the case, indulge yourself — with a reason-
able amount of food, that is! Deprivation is a way of setting yourself up for a
binge, so don’t do it. (See the next section for more about binges.) Instead,
find a way to enjoy the foods you like in reasonable amounts on a regular
basis. Give yourself permission to eat what you want, whenever you want,
but not necessarily as much as you want.
185
Chapter 9: Making Your Way through Trials and Tribulations
Uncovering the clues to your cravings
If you want to know exactly why you get crav-
ings, I can’t help you. Scientists aren’t sure, but
one theory is that cravings are the way your
body tells you that you need specific nutrients.
I don’t buy that one, because nobody needs ice
cream or chocolate cake or potato chips,
although it’s quite possible that there’s some-
thing in ice cream, chocolate cake, and potato
chips that fills either an emotional or physical
need. According to a small study done at the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
and the Monell Chemical Senses Center, a
physiological change occurs in the brain when
you experience a food craving. This research
suggests that food cravings activate the same
areas of the brain — the hippocampus, insula,
and caudate — that are activated when an
addict craves drugs, alcohol, or goes on a gam-
bling spree. These areas of the brain are linked
to emotion, memory, and reward. That could
explain why people crave specific, familiar
foods; they’re etched into your memory as a
reward that soothes the emotions. Other scien-
tific studies have come up with similar findings,
but other theories exist as well.
Some experts say people’s cravings go back to
the beginning of mankind, when cave people
filled up on food whenever they came across it.
Others say people are simply surrounded by too
much food that tastes too good and they just
can’t resist. Although the jury’s still out on this
one, most nutrition experts now agree that crav-
ings are somehow linked to brain chemistry
and, more often than not, occur when you don’t
eat enough or you go too long without eating. In
other words, your cravings may be a result of
real hunger.

Indulging in cravings is good advice for some people, but it isn’t for every-
one. If you’re not satisfied with small amounts of your favorite high-cal foods,
or if you know that eating certain foods will set off an episode of binge-eating,
then abstinence is your best policy until you have your weight under control.
Avoiding binges
An eating binge means one thing to one person and another thing to the next.
Binge eating is relative to individual circumstances and just how much food
constitutes a binge for you. Generally, an episode of true bingeing is defined
as an out-of-control eating episode during which great quantities of food are
consumed in a short period of time. The key phrase here is “out of control.”
People usually binge in response to an emotional upheaval. Not every emo-
tional overeater binges, but most bingers are emotional overeaters. If you’ve
ever had a bad day at the office or a fight with your mate and then turned
around and downed a pint of ice cream along with handfuls of cookies and
maybe even more food than that, you went on a binge.
If you binge once in a while but you’re able to get back on track the next day
without too much residual damage to your physical or mental health, then I
don’t consider it a big problem. Your solution could be as simple as trying to
distract yourself or getting out of the house if you feel a binge coming on, or
reviewing your diet strategies to see if maybe you’ve been too rigid and need
to allow in some of the foods you’ve been denying yourself.
However, if you binge several times a week, for months at a time, you may be
showing signs of a clinical eating disorder known, not surprisingly, as binge-
eating disorder. The signs of binge-eating disorder include
 Quickly eating large amounts of food in one sitting, sometimes when
you’re not even hungry
 Filling up past the point of satisfaction and to the point of great discomfort
 Planning binges
 Eating alone, or hiding any evidence that you’ve eaten, to cover up the
amount of food you eat
 Feeling ashamed, guilty, disgusted, and depressed about bingeing
 Getting to the point where you avoid loved ones for fear of being 
discovered
You don’t necessarily have an eating disorder just because you binge once
in a while. But if you frequently binge and experience guilt, fear, or other
behaviors described in this section, then seek treatment from a professional.
(Flip to Chapter 11 for more advice.) Dieting isn’t a solution for anyone
186
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

with an eating disorder. Left unchecked, binge eating can put you at a particu-
larly high risk of obesity, which can lead to an assortment of medical 
problems.
Maintaining your interest and motivation
One reason why I wrote this book is to help you find ways to stay motivated
and live a low-calorie lifestyle. I don’t want just to help you lose weight right
now, but also to help you lay the groundwork for maintaining a healthy
weight for the rest of your life. For many people, sticking to a low-calorie
lifestyle after the excess weight is gone is harder than losing weight in the
first place. That’s why keeping your low-cal lifestyle fun and interesting is so
important by personalizing your diet plan to suit your own lifestyle and
making adjustments and changes whenever your plan starts to stale.
You can use your new diet plan as a tool to prevent boredom and keep your
low-cal lifestyle interesting by getting creative with your menus, trying new
foods, and discovering new ways to prepare food. The more excited you feel
about your food plan, the more motivated you’ll be to stick with it. Chapter 7
contains plenty of ideas for “alternative” menu plans and ideas for making
your low-cal diet more interesting and more fun. Some of the recipes in
Chapters 12 through 15 can also inspire you to try something different once
in a while so that your diet doesn’t become too routine or too boring.
Breaking through plateaus
Like any mountain you may find yourself climbing, the process of losing weight
is tough going uphill. Unlike mountain climbing, however, where reaching a
plateau or other flat service is a welcome break for the climber, a weight
plateau, which is a stable period during which there is little or no change,
is no relief to a dieter. A plateau is a source of real frustration because it’s a
period of time when, for no apparent reason, you stop losing weight before
you reach your goal. It happens to just about everyone.
You may be at a plateau stage because you’ve been slipping on your diet
and/or exercise routines. Maybe you’ve been feeling a bit cocky and thought
you could sneak in a little extra food here or there or sneak out of the gym a
little sooner than usual. Doing so is okay once in a while, but those added
and unburned calories mount up (and usually in places you don’t want).
The actual reason you get stuck on a plateau probably has to do with your
metabolism slowing down after you’ve lost a bit of weight. When you lose
weight, you inevitably lose some muscle along with excess fat. Along with
muscle goes some of your calorie-burning power. As a result, you may need to
add weight-bearing exercises to your exercise routine to keep your muscles as
strong and healthy as possible. (Chapter 8 can tell you more about that.)
187
Chapter 9: Making Your Way through Trials and Tribulations

I have good news and bad news about weight plateaus. First, the good news:
Eventually, every plateau breaks. The bad news: It can take weeks, or (gulp!)
even months. You may get stuck at the same weight for several months, and
all the usual calorie counting and burning won’t make it budge any quicker.
You can only go so low in calories and you can only do so much exercise.
If you’re doing all you can do to stay on your low-cal plan, then be patient
and hang in there. Whatever you do, don’t use a plateau as an excuse to give
up. When you reach a plateau, consider the following tips to help you, and
maybe, just maybe, you’ll break through your plateau stage a little sooner:
 Remain calm. Worrying about a weight plateau won’t make it go away.
 Practice positive thinking. (See Chapter 4 for help.) If you tell yourself,
“I can do it,” you’ll eventually break through your plateau and continue
losing weight. If you allow yourself to feel defeated, you may give up
and, out of frustration, go back to some of your old overeating habits.
 Stop weighing yourself for a while. Instead of weekly weigh-ins, wait
two or three weeks. Getting on the scale can be very discouraging when
you’ve reached a plateau. (Chapter 4 has tips on weighing yourself.)
 Make some changes to your diet. Now is a good time to try out some of
the “alternative” menu plans in Chapter 7 that you can follow for just a
day or two. If you’re still up around 1,500 calories or more a day, cut
back to 1,300 or 1,400 and see what happens after a week or so.
 Break your exercise routine. If you haven’t been challenging yourself
lately, add another 5 or 10 minutes of exercise to what you’re already
doing on a regular basis. If you’re already exercising as much as you can,
try something different. For instance, if you normally cycle for 30 min-
utes, devote 10 of those minutes to an elliptical trainer. (See Chapter 8
for more on exercising.)
 Attend more meetings or stay more closely in touch with other mem-
bers if you belong to any type of weight-loss group or program. Many
of your fellow dieters have “been there,” and they probably have some
encouraging words to say while you wait it out. (See Chapter 11 for more
info on joining a group.)
 Be sure you’re drinking at least 8 cups of water every day. Water aids
metabolism and helps you feel full so you’re less likely to overeat.
Eating Away from Home with Ease
The best advice anyone can give you if you’re eating anywhere outside your
own home is to have a plan. You’ll always be tempted with restaurant foods,
birthday celebrations, holiday feasts, and times when you have to eat on the
road. Be prepared! I help you out with great tips in the following sections.
188
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

Dining out at restaurants
There are two schools of thought about dieting and eating out at restaurants.
The first school says to make low-calorie food choices at the restaurant; the
other school says to eat what you want but watch your portion sizes. I know
which school I graduated from. Most of the time, when I eat out at a restaurant,
I don’t want to limit my choices to low-calorie foods. I want to eat food that I
don’t normally prepare at home. I want to have fun and enjoy my food while
I’m out.
In this section you can find helpful tips from both schools, and many of them
cross over, depending on where you’re eating and how determined you are to
stick to your diet when you go out to eat.
These tips may come in handy if you don’t want to worry about calories and
just want to watch your portion sizes when you eat out:
 Have an appetizer, side dish salad, or vegetable side dish, and then split
an entree with your eating partner.
 Choose child-size portions when possible.
 If you order a higher-calorie entree and don’t have anyone to share it
with, ask for half your dish to be packed in a take-home bag before you
even start to eat.
 Share a dessert.
If you’re not ready to tempt the fates, or you’re perfectly happy to eat lower
calorie foods when you go out to eat, these tips are for you:
 Stay away from all-you-can-eat buffets unless you’re quite confident
you’ll make wise selections.
 Order an appetizer as your main course.
 Scan the menu for dishes that are steamed, poached, grilled, stir-fried
without heavy sauces added, boiled, or broiled.
 Ask for all dressing, gravies, sauces, butter, sour cream, or any other
optional toppings on the side.
Whichever approach you take to eating out in restaurants, always ask for a
glass of water as soon as you sit down. Also, ask the server to hold the bread
that often arrives at the table before you’ve even ordered. Balance higher-
calorie choices with lower-calorie, and always start your meal with a green
salad or a bowl of broth-based (clear, not creamy) soup.
No ethnic cuisine is necessarily any healthier or lower in calories than
another, although you can probably find more light offerings at, say, Japanese
or Southeast Asian restaurants than at Mediterranean or South American
189
Chapter 9: Making Your Way through Trials and Tribulations

restaurants. All cuisines have their fried foods, their starchy foods, and cook-
ing techniques that add too many extra calories to otherwise healthful food.
Often, the less “Americanized” the food is at an ethnic restaurant, the lighter
the fare. (French food may be one big exception to that rule!) Here’s a sam-
pling of the “best of the best” choices for low-calorie dieters at different
restaurants:
 Chinese: Anything steamed — vegetables, tofu (bean curd), fish or shell-
fish, chicken, dumplings — with sauce on the side. Use the sauce as a
dip instead of pouring it over your food.
 French: Meat, poultry, or seafood en brochette or grilled, steamed veg-
etables; sauces on the side.
 Greek: Souvlaki (kabobs) made with chicken, fish, lamb, or pork and
vegetables, plain rice, small Greek salad.
 Indian: Chicken or seafood Tandoori, lentil dishes, masala (curry)
dishes, basmati rice, cucumber raita.
 Italian: Mussels marinara, pasta primavera, chicken piccata, spaghetti
pomodoro (with tomato-basil sauce), grilled seafood, margherita (or
plain) thin-crust pizza.
 Japanese: Miso soup, negimaki (scallion wrapped with thin slices of
beef), edamame (fresh green soy beans), sushi, sashimi, chirashi,
teriyaki, and yakitori (grilled skewer) dishes, noodle soups.
 Mexican: Ceviche (fresh seafood marinated in lime juice), fajitas, vegetable
chili, burrito, enchilada, or soft taco with chicken, seafood, or vegetables,
Tex-Mex salad in a grilled (not fried) tortilla basket, rice and beans (not
refried), grilled seafood. Avoid sour cream, cheese, and guacamole top-
pings; opt instead for diced tomato, onion, and other vegetable toppings.
 Thai: Bean thread noodles (glass noodles), green papaya salad, squid
salad, grilled or steamed meats.
 Vietnamese: Summer rolls, green papaya salad, fish or shellfish wrapped
in lettuce with mint and cilantro, fish soups.
Enjoying parties
If the celebration is at your house, you have more control over the type of
food that’s served. However, if you’re partying at someone else’s home, you
can’t assume that the host will serve many low-cal foods. You can take sev-
eral steps to help prevent yourself from overeating at a party.
 Eat a little bit at home, just before you leave to go to the party. If it’s a
dinner party, and you don’t want to kill your appetite, just be sure to
have at least one full glass of water before you leave home and ask for
another as soon as you arrive.
190
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

 Bring your own platter of low-calorie foods, such as cut up vegetables
and the Yogurt-Cheese Dip with Spinach and Dill from Chapter 15.
 Position yourself away from the buffet table or any place that’s a safe
distance from temptation.
 Always keep a glass of water or seltzer with lemon in your hand.
 If you normally drink wine, drink wine spritzers — wine diluted with
seltzer or club soda — instead, and pack your glass with ice.
 Try talking more and eating less.
Celebrating holidays
For many dieters, the problem with holidays is that they’re loaded with tradi-
tion, and food usually plays a big role in holiday traditions. Traditional foods
served at holiday celebrations aren’t usually low in calories. What can you
do? For one thing, you can bring your favorite lower-calorie vegetable,
legume, or rice side dish to the table and introduce a new tradition. I can also
think of several other solutions, none of which involve avoiding the big meal.
Try out these few ideas:
 Bank some calories. Don’t skip meals throughout the day and then pig
out at dinner. However, you can eat very light meals during the day —
yogurt with fruit for breakfast, a huge green salad with low-cal dressing
for lunch, another piece of fruit for a snack, and plenty of water, all day
long — so that you can enjoy normal serving sizes of some of your
favorite holiday fare without worrying about your calorie count.
 Drink water or another calorie-free beverage before, during, and after
the meal. You can jazz up a glass of water or seltzer in many calorie-free
and near-calorie-free ways. Mint leaves, lemon, lime, or orange slices, a
couple of raspberries, or an herbal tea bag can all help a humble glass of
water rise to the occasion.
 Remember that it takes 3,500 extra calories to gain a pound. Heavy as
Thanksgiving dinner can be, if you’ve been sticking to a low-calorie plan,
you’re not likely to blow it with one meal. But if you feel like you blew
your diet with a single holiday meal, go to bed, rest easy, wake up the
next day, and get back on your plan. You’re only one day behind.
Traveling light
Like all “special situations,” eating on the road (or in the air or on the tracks) is
risky business when you’re trying to watch calories and lose weight. You never
really know what type of food choices you’ll have while you’re traveling and
when you get to wherever you’re going. Your best bet is to have a travel plan.
191
Chapter 9: Making Your Way through Trials and Tribulations

A travel plan doesn’t have to be complicated. Whether you’re taking a car
trip or traveling on a bus, train, or airplane, you can easily pack a selection of
foods that don’t require refrigeration so that you’re not forced to choose
from vending machines, dining car options, or meals you’d just rather not eat
or, worse yet, go hungry. Some ideas for easy-to-carry foods that are easy to
eat (especially if you’ve packed your own utensils!) include
 Shelf-stable lowfat milk in 8-ounce containers
 Small bottles of water
 Applesauce and pop-top cans of water-packed or juice-packed fruit in
individual serving containers
 Fresh fruit such as apples, cherries, grapes, and pears
 Individual cans or packages of tuna or salmon
 Crackers or pretzels in sealed plastic snack bags
 Individual boxes of cold cereal
 Packets of instant hot cereal (if you have access to boiling water)
 100-calorie cookie or cracker snack packs
My favorite food and travel anecdote, which is really a bit of advice, is the
story of my friend Joyce, who travels to France whenever she gets a chance.
She always packs a plastic knife, fork, and spoon in her carry-on bag so that
she’s prepared to pick up some crusty bread, a small hunk of cheese, and a
piece of fruit at a local market and enjoy a picnic meal wherever she goes.
That way, she’s not limited to hotel or restaurant food. She not only has more
control over what she eats, but she also saves money! I followed Joyce’s lead
several years ago and found it extremely helpful. Everyone laughed when I
packed my own chopsticks before I left on a trip to China, but I had the last
laugh because I ended up using them every day while I was there. I was on a
very hectic schedule and often had no time to sit down for a snack or regular
meal. It didn’t matter, because I bought packaged or prepared foods to go,
and ate in my hotel room or in the vans and buses I was using for transporta-
tion. Ever since that time, I’ve kept a complete set of plastic utensils with me
in my handbag (and in my daughter’s backpack), at all times. Keeping a set of
eating utensils in your bag and your car can open up your options for eating
away from home, wherever you go.

In This Chapter
 Revising your food and exercise plan for weight maintenance
 Drawing on your experience and thinking ahead for long-term success
 Maintaining weight at different stages of life
M
aintaining your current weight probably takes just as much patience
and open-mindedness as getting to a healthier weight. Maybe even
more. Statistically, most people who lose weight aren’t able to maintain their
weight loss after several years. But you can beat those odds! Plenty of people
are able to keep all or most of the weight off and maintain a healthier weight
for the rest of their lives. You can be one of them!
This chapter is one of the more serious in this book. I focus on healthy
weight maintenance at any age. Sure, losing and maintaining weight gets
harder if you wait until you’re older to start trying or if you’ve tried over
and over again throughout your life and you’ve gotten older in the process.
But it doesn’t matter if you’re 20, 40, 60, or older; you lose weight and main-
tain the loss by following the same rules. You may have to tweak the rules
here and there to fit your own circumstances, but they don’t change 
with age.
In addition, this chapter also contains some practical tools to help you main-
tain your weight loss, such as a formula to help you determine how many
calories you can consume now to stay at your current weight and a few menu
plans you can use as guides to healthy, calorie-controlled meal planning
throughout your lifetime.

Adding Calories and Keeping 
Up with Your Workouts
The first thing you had to do to start losing weight was accept the notion of
change. (What? You haven’t started losing weight? Check out Chapter 4 to
start your plan.) You had to change something about the way you eat, the
way you exercise, and even the way you think. You’re probably still changing
your ways and adjusting to the many changes you’ve already made.
Maybe you’re noticing that change is a recurring theme when you live a 
low-calorie lifestyle. Nothing stays the same anywhere, and certainly not in
Dietville. You simply move from one stage of weight control to the next. When
you get to a healthy weight, or when you decide that cutting calories to lose
weight isn’t working for you anymore, the next stage is weight maintenance.
During this stage, your goal is to stay where you are and prevent weight gain.
Weight maintenance is actually easier than weight loss. First, you’re more
seasoned in the art of weight control than before you started losing. You’ve
lost weight and you’re already a success story! You can now relax some, eat a
little more food if you want, put everything you’ve figured out into practice,
and just keep a close eye on yourself. You know that you can lose weight by
either reducing calories or exercising, but that a combination of the two is
most effective. The same holds true for weight maintenance.
After you enter a weight-maintenance stage, you no longer need a deficit of
calories because you’re not trying to lose any more weight. On the other
hand, you can’t celebrate your weight-loss success with random, mindless
eating. You still need a plan that includes a calorie-controlled diet and an
ongoing exercise routine. In the following sections, I give you tips for adjust-
ing your diet plan and exercise routine so that you can begin maintaining
your weight with ease.
Using a formula for the future
To maintain your new weight, you need to figure on taking in at least 25 per-
cent fewer calories than you were when you first started your low-calorie
diet. For example, if you were consuming 2,800 calories a day before you
started losing and you cut down to an average of, say, 1,400 calories to lose
weight, you can raise your calorie limit to about 2,100 for weight mainte-
nance. (The difference between 1,400 and 2,100 is 700, which is 25 percent of
2,800.) As it turns out, 700 isn’t only 25 percent of 2,800; it’s smack dab in the
middle of where you started your diet and where you ended it! If you don’t
know how many calories you were consuming when you started, gradually
194
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

increase your current calorie allowance by 100 or 200 a day. Evaluate your
weight once each week to see if you’ve lost, gained, or maintained, and then
adjust your calorie allowance if necessary.
Like all weight-related formulas and measures, this one is approximate. It can’t
take into account all your own personal factors that affect how you lose weight
and how you gain it, such as your family history and your own personal history
of weight loss and weight gain. (See Chapter 2 for more about these topics.) It
also can’t take into account any changes in your metabolism that may result
from losing weight. This formula, like the body measurement and weight-loss
formulas in Chapters 2 and 3, is the equivalent of an educated guess. You may
have to work with it and adjust your calories up or down a little, in order to
make it work perfectly for you.
Planning menus for weight maintenance
A 2,000-calorie menu is a good place for active people to start when develop-
ing a weight-maintenance plan. If you’re a small-framed woman, or someone
who isn’t very active, you may need to cut this amount down to somewhere
between 1,500 and 2,000 calories. If you’re a man, or a very active woman,
you may be able to add a couple of hundred calories. Use the following menu
plans for at least a week to see how they work for you.
Just as you had to take a basic calorie-controlled menu (see Chapter 6) and
adjust it to make it work for you while you were losing weight, you can use
the 2,000-calorie weight-maintenance plans that follow as basic guides, and
increase or reduce the amount of food slightly until you find your own balance.
As you start increasing the number of calories you consume each day, be
sure to remember the following:
 You can approach weight maintenance in two ways.
• The first way is to slightly increase the portion sizes of some of the
same foods you enjoyed while you were on a low-calorie weight-
loss plan.
• Another way is to continue on a nutritionally balanced, lower-calorie
plan so you can enjoy more of the favorite foods you may have cut
back on or even eliminated while you were losing weight.
The approach you take depends on how confident you are in your ability
to stick to reasonable portion sizes of all foods.
 Now that you’re on a maintenance plan, you can relax. If you stick
closely to the portion sizes you’ve discovered are acceptable, and you
don’t add too many snacks and desserts back into day-to-day meal
195
Chapter 10: Staying Fit and Stopping Regain in Its Tracks

plans, you can go out to eat at a restaurant or dinner party and enjoy
your meal without worrying so much about how your food was prepared
or how many calories it contains.
 Paying attention to the amount of food you eat, practicing more mindful
eating behavior (see Chapter 4 for more about mindful eating), and keep-
ing your goals in mind are all more important at this point than counting
every single calorie. By the time you get to a weight-maintenance stage,
you know how to eat. You know how important maintaining a positive atti-
tude is and how to incorporate as much physical activity into your life as
possible. Following a low-cal lifestyle after you’ve lost weight is all about
putting everything you’ve discovered into practice on a regular basis.
 If you find that your maintenance diet isn’t working and you’re starting
to gain weight, use a lower-calorie menu plan from Chapter 6 to get back
on track again and figure out how many calories you can consume, on
average, to stay at your maintenance weight.
Now that you’re on a maintenance plan, you’re eating the same way as
anyone else who maintains his or her weight. The only difference between
you and a nondieter is that you may still need to follow a strict plan until
you’re confident that you know exactly how much you can eat and stay at
your current weight. You’re no longer on a low-calorie diet, but you are on a
calorie-controlled diet. In fact, anyone and everyone who maintains a healthy
weight is on a calorie-controlled diet, whether they know it or not. If they
weren’t on calorie-controlled diets, they’d be gaining weight!
The following are four menu plans you can use as a guide to just how much
food is allowed on a 2,000-calorie maintenance diet plan. Use the basic por-
tion sizes of different foods as guides for substituting similar foods and creat-

Many of the reduced-calorie food products you used while you were on a 
low-calorie diet plan, such as light bread, reduced-calorie syrups, and light
salad dressings, can still be helpful when you’re trying to maintain weight
at a slightly higher calorie level. For instance, the menus in this chapter use
regular bread instead of the light bread you were eating while you were on
a low-calorie diet. They also include regular cheese so you can use any vari-
ety you like. You now need to decide if you want to make that switch from
reduced calorie foods to regular foods. On the other hand, I still base calcula-
tions for foods such as mayonnaise, yogurt, salad dressings, and milk, on
reduced-calorie and low-fat varieties. As soon as you find your own balance
of maintenance calories and exercise, you can decide which foods to hold
over from your weight-loss plan.
Dinner No. 1
3-inch square of lasagna (any variety)
1 cup steamed broccoli
11⁄2 cups spinach and orange salad with 1 tablespoon light dressing

When dietitians design weight-loss menus, they often put a lot of milk in the
plan to make sure you get enough calcium each day, along with other nutri-
ents in milk that help your body use calcium efficiently. If you don’t drink
milk, substitute yogurt, cheese, other dairy products, or nondairy products
that are fortified with calcium and other vitamins and minerals.

Revisiting your exercise routine
After you reach your goal weight or decide to stop losing weight for any
reason, your new goal is to maintain a balance of calories and physical activ-
ity that can keep you at your current weight. While you were losing weight,
you were trying to shift that balance so that you burned more calories than
you consumed by eating fewer calories and exercising more. When you reach
the maintenance stage, you’ll probably want to add more calories to your
diet, but you don’t necessarily have to increase the amount of exercise you
do. However, maintaining the level of physical activity that you reached while
you were losing weight is still important.
One of the biggest threats to your exercise routine is boredom. Check out
Chapter 8 for suggestions on ways to keep your exercise life interesting.
Age is no excuse for cutting back on physical activity. If you’ve been active
throughout your life or you became more active in your attempt to lose
weight, try to maintain the same activity level as you get older to help fight
the normal slowing down of your metabolism. If you can’t maintain the same
level of activity, remember: Any activity is better than no activity at all.

Chapter 10: Staying Fit and Stopping Regain in Its Tracks

Managing Your Weight for the Long Term
You stop losing weight when the amount of calories you consume routinely
equals the number of calories your body uses for energy. At that point, you
have to decide whether or not to update your low-calorie plan and continue
to try to lose weight or to revise your plan completely and try to maintain
your current weight. You don’t want to gain back any of the weight you lost.
By losing weight, you’ve made an investment in your long-term health. The
younger you are, the more advantage this decision will have for you if you
maintain all or most of your weight loss. Typically, if dieters gain back the
weight they’ve lost, they regain even more weight, and their excess weight
is higher in fat in proportion to muscle than before they went on a diet.
That’s one reason why dieting doesn’t work for so many people and why
weight cycling (yo-yo dieting) can be dangerous. If your weight goes up
and down and the “up” gets higher and higher with each attempt to lose,
you’re putting yourself at higher risk of developing weight-related medical
problems.
A sure sign of weight-loss success is knowing exactly what works for you and
continuing to do it until you reach your goal weight. When you reach a
healthier weight, you can’t just say, “Now I can stop dieting” and let your old
eating habits sneak back in. The point was never to go on a short-term diet or
make temporary changes. Instead, you’ve adopted a low-calorie lifestyle,
which means you’re committed to eating well and getting physical activity so
that you can stay at a healthier weight for the rest of your life.
In the following sections, I tell you how to establish your weight-maintenance
plan and explain the special challenges for folks in families with a history of
weight problems.
Reviewing what’s worked for you
I often hear dieters say, “that diet worked” or “this diet doesn’t work.” In fact,
many weight-loss diets work if people stick to them. Sometimes diets aren’t
designed for long-term use, however, or they become so monotonous you
can’t possibly stick to them for more than a month or two.
Dieters who join commercial weight-loss programs are often repeat perform-
ers. They’ve been there before, and they’re back again because they feel the
program works for them if they just keep working the program. When you’re
200
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

a do-it-yourselfer, you have to create your own program. You have to find the
plan, the people, and the activities that work for you and move on from any-
thing (or anyone) that gets in the way of your success.
What works for one dieter may not necessarily work for another. Dieters try
all sorts of tricks to lose weight, and they struggle even harder to keep it off.
If you’re a “career dieter” and you’ve been on and off different types of diets
most of your life, then you’re armed with the knowledge of what works and
what doesn’t work for you. Think back and make a list of all the tips, advice,
and new behaviors that felt comfortable to you and contributed to any tem-
porary success you achieved on any type of diet plan. Use that list to remind
yourself what you need to do to stay at a healthier weight.
If you’re undertaking your first weight-loss diet, then you’re lucky. You’re not
looking back over a lifetime of failed diets and repeated patterns of weight
loss followed by weight gain. You’re not saddled with the same feelings of
hopelessness and defeat that often get in the way of success for more sea-
soned dieters. You can simply look back over this diet plan, pick out every-
thing that has worked for you, and discard what hasn’t. Take the best that
this low-calorie weight-loss plan has to offer and move forward with it.
Pushing ahead with new ideas
You may have noticed that the world is overflowing with weight-loss informa-
tion. You turn on the television and see countless infomercials and sales
pitches. You’re bombarded with pop-up ads on the Internet. You listen to
the radio and hear about every new miracle supplement to help you lose
50 pounds without picking your butt off the couch. You open your e-mail
account and you’re probably flooded with spam spouting the next best fad.
Unfortunately, much of it is misinformation. But if you can differentiate
between advice that comes from a reliable source and advice that comes
from someone who is simply trying to sell you a weight-loss plan or fitness
product, you can stay well informed.
The following tips can point you toward reliable information:
 Subscribe to a recognized health, fitness, or healthy cooking maga-
zine. Use the articles, recipes, and tips you find in these publications to
reinforce your commitment to a low-calorie lifestyle.
 Find helpful Web sites. Search for sites that can help expand your
knowledge of nutrition and weight control. Bookmark the best and visit
them often.
201
Chapter 10: Staying Fit and Stopping Regain in Its Tracks

 Investigate new ways of eating. Check out ethnic restaurants, eat vege-
tarian meals at least once a week, or take a healthy cooking class.
 Check out new exercise classes and programs at your gym. Do any-
thing you can to keep your exercise life as interesting as your diet life so
that you stay motivated to keep up with both.
Coming to terms with your genes
Your genes help determine not only your body shape and type, but also to a
certain degree, your propensity to gain, lose, and maintain weight (see
Chapter 2 for details). Until such time as scientists find realistic solutions,
you really can’t fight weight factors that are determined genetically. The
power of genetic predisposition became clear in one interesting weight study,
wherein adoptees had the same weight patterns as their biological parents,
whether they were thin, heavy, or somewhere in between. At the same time,
the researchers found no consistent or significant similarities between the
weight patterns of adoptive parents and their adopted children.
If you come from a family with a history of being overweight or obesity, losing
weight can be more difficult. There’s no way around that. But even though
losing weight may be more of a struggle for you than someone with a leaner
heritage, getting to a healthier weight and staying there is possible. You just
may have to work harder at maintaining your weight loss, or perhaps, work a
bit harder at developing realistic expectations about your weight.
If you’ve been dieting most of your life and have never reached your goal
weight, your goal weight may no longer be realistic. That’s okay; all you have
to do is set new goals! You can find help with that in Chapter 4. Just remem-
ber, getting real doesn’t mean giving up. It just means taking a more rational
approach to weight control.
Checking your maintenance 
plan periodically
When you made a decision to lose weight by living a low-calorie lifestyle, you
decided to make permanent changes in your life. Weight maintenance
requires an on-going commitment to that lifestyle. From here on in, weight
control is all about reinforcing the principals about getting fit that you dis-
covered while you were losing weight.
You’ll maintain a healthier weight as long as you continue to live a low-calorie
lifestyle that includes well-balanced meals, plenty of physical activity, and a
“can-do” attitude. If you feel yourself starting to slip in any of these areas,
check out Chapter 4 for tools to help you get back on track.

Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

Recognizing Your Body’s Changing
Calorie and Nutritional Needs
As you move from a stage of weight loss to the next stage of weight 
maintenance, at times you may feel as though you’ve taken on a new
identity. Depending on how long it took for you to arrive at this (hopefully)
permanent plateau, you may in fact have moved from one stage of life to
another. As you revise your diet and exercise plan to accommodate the
“new you,” you need to pay attention not only to your changing calorie
needs but also to your changing nutritional needs. As an adult, you need
the same nutrients you needed while you were growing up (for a review
of those nutrients, go to Chapter 3), but as your body changes with age,
you need some of them in different amounts. The following sections
provide info on your body’s needs at different ages and various stages 
of life.
Staying lean and healthy at any age
As you age, the rate at which you burn calories decreases. With every
decade, you need 2 percent fewer calories, which isn’t a huge decrease. If
you maintained your weight at a calorie level of 2,000 when you were 22,
you may need to cut that to 1,960 by the time you’re 32, and to 1,920 by
the time you’re 42. In a perfect world, you maintain a healthy weight, stay
active, and build up your muscles as you age so that you continue burning
calories efficiently, and you don’t have to make any huge dietary changes.
Life, however, usually gets in the way of everyone’s perfect world.
Weight control may be all about counting calories, but healthful weight 
control is all about getting the nutrients you need after you decide to live
a low-calorie lifestyle. Getting enough nutrients is easy when you overeat
because you’re consuming so much food that you’re bound to meet your
daily requirement for most vitamins and minerals. In fact, instead of
feeling guilty next time you sneak in a deluxe cheeseburger, remember
that along with all that fat and all those calories, you’re getting a good 
supply of protein, calcium, iron, and B vitamins. Unless you’re overeating
all the time, such a high-calorie indulgence may even be good for you on
occasion.
Whenever your calorie count falls below 1,500, however, getting all the nutri-
ents you need in the amounts you need is difficult. (For a review of necessary
nutrients and good food sources, flip to Chapter 3.) It requires careful plan-
ning. When I developed the calorie-controlled menu plans in Chapter 6, I did
the planning for you and tried to keep those menus as nutritionally balanced
as possible within the calorie allowance given.
203
Chapter 10: Staying Fit and Stopping Regain in Its Tracks

At different ages and stages of life, it helps to plan calorie-controlled menus,
which include specific foods containing specific nutrients that are particu-
larly beneficial during those periods in your life. The recommended calorie
intakes for each age group are averages for healthy, moderately active people
who aren’t trying to lose weight. Depending on your age, height, current
weight, and activity level, these figures can vary by several hundred calories.
 11- to 18-year-olds need plenty of calcium from dairy products or cal-
cium-fortified foods to build healthy bones for later in life because as
you age, you stop building bone. The better your bone density at an
early age, the less risk you have of developing osteoporosis, a disease
where you suffer from bone loss, later in life. Girls also need more iron at
this stage to offset the loss from menstruation. The average recom-
mended calorie intake for girls in this group is 2,200 calories a day and
2,500 to 3,000 calories for boys.
 18- to 25-year-olds may need a vitamin C boost from fresh fruits and veg-
gies to move more safely through this experimental stage of life that
often includes eating fast foods, smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol,
and getting too little sleep. The average recommended calorie intake for
women in this group is 2,200 calories and 2,900 calories for men.
 25- to 35-year-olds can start thinking about preventing disease as well as
preventing weight gain. If you’re a woman who plans to become preg-
nant, be sure to get enough of the B vitamin folic acid (also called folate)
to prevent the risk of birth defects. Dark green leafy vegetables,
legumes, and oranges are naturally high in folic acid. Breads, cereals,
pastas, and other grain foods are all fortified with this vitamin. Men and
women alike need to be familiar with antioxidants — the vitamins, miner-
als, and phytochemicals described in Chapter 3 that help prevent
chronic diseases. The average recommended calorie intake for women
in this group is 2,200 calories and 2,900 calories for men.
 35- to 45-year-olds can start making lower-fat, higher-fiber foods that are
rich in lean protein and B vitamins a priority. Soy products, beans,
lentils, and other legumes are a great source of low-fat protein and B vit-
amins. Protein and the B vitamins niacin and riboflavin are essential for
keeping your skin, nails, and hair in top condition. The B vitamin folic
acid has been shown to protect brain functions, such as memory, in
aging adults. The recommended calorie intake for women in this group
is 2,200 calories and 2,900 calories for men.
 45- to 55-year-olds can turn to seafood, soy products, nuts, and wheat
germ to provide Omega-3 essential fatty acids that help protect your
heart along with foods that are high in fiber and low in saturated fats.
During this time, start increasing your calcium intake again to protect
against bone loss, and consider introducing more soy foods into your
diet. For women, soy foods can help stabilize hormones, and for men,
protect against prostate cancer. After age 50, the recommended calorie
intake for women in this group drops from 2,200 to 1,900 calories a day;
the drop for men is from 2,900 to 2,300 calories.
204
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

 After you pass age 55, just keep on doing what you’re doing (as long as
what you’re doing is healthful)! Continue to exercise to help offset the
slowing down of your metabolism and keep your calories at healthy
upper and lower limits. Several of the success stories in Chapter 17 are
from people in their 50s and 60s, which just goes to show that it’s never
too late to start taking care of yourself. The recommended calorie intake
for women in this group is 1,900 calories a day and 2,300 calories for men.
Working through normal stages of life
If you’re a woman, you have one time in your life when a certain amount of
weight gain isn’t only inevitable, but it’s also encouraged! That’s, of course,
during pregnancy. Whether you’re a woman or a man, midlife is another time
when hormonal shifts and a metabolism with a mind of its own can cause
weight gain. In the following sections, I offer advice on how to keep both of
these types of weight gain under control.
Having a baby
Even if you’re overweight, pregnancy isn’t the time to be on any type of
weight-loss diet. Pregnant women need more calories and more nutrients
than normal. Reducing calories and losing weight while you’re pregnant can
be dangerous for the growth and development of the fetus.
If you’re overweight before you get pregnant, chances are you’ll gain more
weight than average during the pregnancy and retain more than a normal-
weight woman after delivery. The best solution is to lose weight before you
get pregnant. If that’s impossible, your doctor may put you on a calorie-
controlled diet to help prevent excess weight gain during your pregnancy.
Except under certain conditions, such as when a doctor finds evidence of
heart disease, cervical or vaginal complications, or a history of miscarriages,
low- to moderate-level exercise is usually encouraged during pregnancy. The
type and amount of exercise you do while you’re pregnant is a decision that
has to be made with your doctor. (Check out Pregnancy For Dummies, 2nd
Edition, by Joanne Stone, MD, Keith Eddleman, MD, and Mary Duenwald
[Wiley] for more information about pregnancy-related issues.)
If you’re breastfeeding, you can start eating normally again, but the especially
good news is that your metabolism will naturally speed up during this
process. If you’re breastfeeding exclusively (not supplementing your baby’s
diet with formula), you may burn up to 600 calories a day. That’s the equiva-
lent of two aerobic workouts! So although reducing calories and increasing
activity is considered safe for breastfeeding mothers, and normally doesn’t
affect lactation, you don’t have to challenge yourself, because you’ll be losing
weight naturally. And there’s more happy news: At least one study showed
that your naturally speedy metabolism during this time helps the weight
205
Chapter 10: Staying Fit and Stopping Regain in Its Tracks

come off around your hips and butt! (Check out Breastfeeding For Dummies
by Sharon Perkins, RN, and Carol Vannais, RN [Wiley] for more information
about breastfeeding issues.)
Moving into midlife
Staying fit and maintaining a reasonably healthy body weight at an early age
can help lower your risk of developing chronic, age-related medical condi-
tions as you get older. (Check out Chapter 16 for an overview of the health
problems associated with being overweight and obesity). Still, your body
does age and change, and the normal changes associated with aging affect
your weight the same way they affect almost every organ in your body.
Menopause and perimenopause (the approximately 10-year period of time
that precedes actual menopause) are two periods in a woman’s life when her
hormones are fluctuating wildly and wreaking all types of havoc with her
body. Hormonal bouncing can certainly be responsible for shifts in your
weight. Even if you’ve maintained a healthy weight your whole life, you may
find yourself starting to gain in your mid-forties to mid-fifties, signaling a time
to take action. If you don’t already have an exercise routine, develop one.
Moving a little more at this point in your life is much easier than starting to
eat a whole lot less. And probably healthier for you, too!
The concept of male menopause is controversial, and downright funny to
some people, but the fact is that middle-aged men go through their own
series of changes. Men who don’t get enough exercise lose muscle and get
flabby, and those who don’t watch what they eat start to gain weight as their
metabolism starts to slow down. Depression and mood swings aren’t the sole
property of menopausal women; men suffer through psychological crises as
well and are just as likely to use food as an emotional bandage.
If you’re a man or a woman, young or old, who feels excess weight starting to
pile on or if you’ve been dieting for some time and you feel you can’t lose any
more weight, switch your focus from trying to lose to preventing gain. That
still means cutting back on the amount of calories you were eating while you
were gaining weight, but you don’t have to follow the type of low-calorie diet
needed to lose weight. Now you’re at a place where your best calorie count
falls somewhere between the two extremes. A weight-maintenance diet is
your best solution.

I
f you have trouble sticking to a low-calorie weight-loss plan on your own —
and many people do — help is available. Maybe all you need is a “diet
buddy,” someone who holds you accountable and depends on you for his or
her own weight-loss success. Maybe you just need to sit down with family and
friends and let them know how they can best support you (“Mom, I really love
your lasagna, but I can’t eat two helpings, so please don’t feel bad if I don’t ask
for more.”)
If you don’t have a support network of family and friends, if they don’t seem
to be there when you need them, or if the support of loved ones just isn’t
enough to keep you motivated and on track, you can turn to one of several
different types of programs and groups for support. If you have overeating
issues and you feel like no one understands, you may also need the help of
a professional counselor.
You really can’t know which type of program or counselor will best serve
your needs until you compare a few, see what they have to offer, and perhaps
even try out several different types of programs until you find the one that
works for you. This chapter lays out your options to help you figure out
which type of support you actually need.

Asking Other Folks for Help
How do you know when you need help losing weight and sticking to your
weight-loss plan? You just know. You can feel your motivation slipping; you
find yourself cheating more often on your diet; you start using any old excuse
not to exercise.
Losing the weight is up to you. You can’t pay someone to lose it for you. You
can’t swallow a little pill and make it magically disappear forever. You can’t
dream it away. However, some people know from experience to reach out for
help the minute they decide to embark on a program. Maybe you can rely on
help and support from your family and friends, especially with any big
lifestyle change, such as losing weight. Maybe you need help from outside
your circle of family and friends. This chapter is a good start to help you
gather together a support group of people who will be with you every step of
the way until you’ve adjusted to all the changes and can live a healthier
lifestyle on your own.
When beginning a weight-loss plan, you may just need someone to pay atten-
tion to what you’re doing, to understand that it can be difficult at times, and
to pat yourself on the back when you’re doing well. You may need to be in the
company of others who are struggling with weight issues or, if the roots of
your overeating run deep, you may want to consider private counseling (see
“Considering Counseling,” later in this chapter). You may need different types
of help at different stages of weight loss. Surveys show that people who are
successful at losing weight and keeping the weight off are the people who
have the most support. Get it wherever you can!
In the following sections, I discuss the pros and cons of involving your loved
ones in your weight-loss plans and tell you how to find diet buddies, role
models, and even a professional counselor, if you need one.
Talking to friends and family
When you look to others for help and support, your first instinct may be to
turn to family members or friends. They know you well, and you know you
can trust them. Let your friends and family know what your plans and goals
are, and tell them specifically how they can help. No matter how you feel,
make your feelings known to the people who are closest to you. They may
not know how to help you unless you tell them.
208
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

Sometimes, however, the people you count on the most may let you down,
especially if they don’t understand what you’re going through. If losing
weight means avoiding Sunday supper at your mother-in-law’s house, family
members may feel hurt. If losing weight makes you more attractive to other
men or women, your mate may surprise you by being less supportive than
you expected. And if losing weight means you’re going to outshine your best
friend, you may not get what you need from her, either. The people who love
you love you just the way you are. They may not want you to change. If that’s
the case, you can’t worry about what everyone else wants; you have to be
strong enough to take care of yourself.
If ever there was a time to be selfish, this is it. Now is the time to say “No,
thanks” to second helpings, no matter who’s offering them. You can use the fol-
lowing tips to help you and your friends and family adapt to your new lifestyle:
 Set boundaries. You may have to say no when your partner wants to go
out to eat. Explain that it’s only for now; after you feel in control of your
eating habits, you can eat out all you want. You may or may not want
people to comment on your weight as you go along, so let them know.
Now is a time to assert yourself; you have to take control without worry-
ing about pleasing everyone else. If you can work up the enormous
amount of strength and determination it takes to stick to a low-calorie
diet, then you can work up the strength to stand up to anyone who tries
to get in your way.
 Clearly explain your needs. Like it or not, you’ll probably have some
explaining to do when your diet interferes with other people’s needs.
Help your family and friends understand that this diet is something you
have to do right now. Let them know that you’re not trying to be antiso-
cial or rude. Tell your loved ones that you don’t want it to be just
another diet; you’re trying to make huge, permanent lifestyle changes.
This change is going to take a lot of work, and you need positive rein-
forcement along the way. Don’t apologize for what you’re doing, but
explain that you won’t always have to say “no” to everything that’s fun,
but for now, you need their understanding.
 Be patient and understanding as well. Your friends and family may not
know how to be supportive, and if that’s the case, you have to show
them. You have to tell them the types of advice and reminders you want
to hear and don’t want to hear. They probably don’t realize that they
could be hurting your chances of success by keeping food around the
house that you find hard to resist or by putting pressure on you to par-
ticipate in social events that may sabotage your diet.
 Thank them for their support. Let the people you care about know how
much you appreciate their attention and support. Don’t forget to say
thank you.
209
Chapter 11: Helping Yourself with Outside Resources

Reaching out to find diet
buddies and role models
When your family and friends can’t provide the support you need, you proba-
bly need to reach outside your inner circle for help and encouragement.
Doing so may just mean looking around the office for someone who may
make a good diet buddy or posting a note on a community bulletin board
at your church, gym, or school.
Reaching out also means trying to find a role model — someone who has
lost a significant amount of weight and kept it off, or someone who never
diets but manages to stay in shape. If you know someone like that, try to
find out his or her secret! Having the advice of someone who knows what
you’re going through and who can offer helpful, unbiased advice never
hurt anyone.
Wherever you turn for support, look for people who are living happy, healthy
lives. Look for people with positive, hopeful attitudes about themselves, their
bodies, and their future success. These types of people are your best role
models and your best motivators. Model your own behavior after these
people. Don’t be afraid of their success — or your own!
Sorting through Commercial 
Weight-Loss Plans
Frustrated dieters founded some of today’s most well known commercial
weight-loss programs — Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and Diet Center.
These programs started small and grew into huge businesses that now incor-
porate their own lines of food products, motivational tools, instructional
materials, and Web-based programs. In addition to the biggies, you can find
weight-loss programs in YWCAs and YMCAs, community centers, hospitals,
and university medical centers. Any of these programs can help you start and
stick to a lower-calorie diet and monitor you as you start to lose weight. The
secret to success is to stick with the program if it’s working for you. Read on
in the following sections to find the criteria you can use to evaluate a weight-
loss program and decide if it’s right for you.
If you plan to lose more than 20 pounds, have any health problems, or take
any type of medication on a regular basis, see your doctor for a physical
checkup before enrolling in a weight-loss program. Be sure your doctor
knows about your weight-loss plans. If you’re pregnant, have certain medical
210
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

conditions, take certain medications, or have a history of eating disorders,
you may not be accepted into a commercial weight-loss program without
your physician’s written consent. Otherwise, most programs accept anyone
who has 10 pounds or more to lose.
Figuring out whether a commercial 
program can help you
Every decade or so, government and consumer groups “crack down” on
the diet industry, investigating claims made by weight-loss programs and
product manufacturers, and often charging these companies with misleading
dieters about the safety, effectiveness, and long-term cost of their programs.
The diet industry as a whole has been criticized for not living up to its
promises of success for most people, and in most cases, the criticism is 
warranted.
Evidence shows that no commercial weight-loss program statistically has
a very high success rate with respect to long-term weight control. Clients
lose weight, but they don’t keep it off. That evidence doesn’t mean these 
programs can’t help you; they can. Weight-loss programs provide structure,
personal attention, and valuable tools to help you stay on track when
you’re following a low-calorie diet. The better-known programs all have
an educational component to help you discover how to eat a nutritionally
balanced, lower-calorie diet and develop better eating habits. And the best
programs all recommend exercise as part of an overall weight-loss and
fitness regime.
So how do you know when you need to turn to a commercial weight-loss pro-
gram? That’s a pretty simple question to answer! If you find that your self-
help program isn’t working for you or you start to feel that you won’t reach
your goals on your own, turn to an outside program for guidance, structure,
and support. When you choose a good program, that program will comple-
ment the low-calorie lifestyle advocated in this book.
You can help ensure your own success by taking on most of the responsibil-
ity for your own weight control, rather than turning that responsibility over
to any outside plan or program. In other words, use the program and apply
any helpful tools they provide to your own low-calorie plan, but don’t expect
the program to work for you unless you’re doing most of the work! At some
point, you’ll have to become accountable to yourself and no one else. At
the same time that you’re depending on the advice and expertise of others,
you’re discovering how to trust yourself to control your own weight in the
future.

Chapter 11: Helping Yourself with Outside Resources

Asking the right questions
A perfectly good weight-loss program may not be perfect for you. Check
around. Before you join any program, ask these questions about each program
you check and be sure you feel satisfied with the answers:
 How long has the program existed? Go with the tried and true.
 What types of professionals provide services to members? Do doctors,
dietitians, nurses, and certified counselors participate in the pro-
gram? Unless you participate in a medically supervised weight-loss pro-
gram (check out “Getting the Scoop on Medically Supervised Programs,”
later in this chapter), and depending on your individual medical and
psychological needs, you may need to seek additional help from profes-
sionals such as medical doctors, psychologists, and registered dietitians
outside the weight-loss program you choose.
 What is the total cost of the program, including special food, supple-
ments, or other products? Be sure to get the complete cost of partici-
pating in the program upfront so you can decide whether or not it’s
affordable for you. A good program doesn’t have to be expensive, and
the cost of any individual program isn’t an indicator of whether or not it
will work for you. You must be able to stick with the program, however,
so total cost is one important factor when choosing from among differ-
ent programs.
 How often will you check in or attend educational meetings? A good
commercial program has weekly counseling sessions or group meetings.
 How is your weight loss monitored? Is there a weekly weigh-in? A
weight-loss program must include a weekly weigh-in.
 Will you get help setting positive lifestyle goals in addition to setting
food and weight goals? Be sure the program includes behavioral coun-
seling (group or individual) to help you break the bad habits that have
contributed to your weight gain.
 Does the program incorporate or strongly recommend physical activ-
ity as a means to weight loss and weight control? A sound program
always includes or recommends some type of exercise program to com-
plement your diet. Avoid any commercial weight-loss plan that focuses
on diet alone.
 Does the program address the needs of your age group? A good
weight-loss plan takes your age into consideration when making diet
adjustments and recommending exercise programs.
 If you have a physical or medical condition that requires special atten-
tion, does the group address your particular needs? If you have a
chronic medical condition or any dietary restrictions, be sure a physician
212
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

or dietitian is involved in the program who is qualified to address your
particular needs. If the program doesn’t have any professionals involved,
be aware that you’ll have to go outside the program for medical approval
of your plan.
 Does the program include a weight-maintenance plan? What are the
specifics of this plan? Every good weight-loss program includes a
follow-up plan for members to follow after they reach their goal weight.
Don’t join any program that ends when you reach your goals.
Picking a suitable plan
Just because someone you know raves about the diet center she goes to
doesn’t mean it’s the right place for you. When picking a diet center, you can
start with a recommendation, but you really have to do your own research to
find a program that suits your individual needs. Before you make your final
decision, check to ensure that the weight-loss plan in question absolutely
includes the following if you’re to consider it at all:
 The program’s diet plan must be safe and sound. Avoid any plan that
recommends fewer than 1,000 to 1,200 calories. At lower calorie levels,
getting the nutrients you need from your food is difficult.
 The program’s diet plan must ultimately include a wide variety of
foods. If the program requires you to use their own food products in
your diet plan, the program needs to have a plan in place to help you
return to “normal” eating so you can move on to regular foods that are
readily available in the supermarket.
 The program needs to encourage slow, steady weight loss. You want to
lose a pound or two each week.
 The program needs to be goal-oriented. Avoid any plan that doesn’t
encourage you to set goals and provide strategies for meeting them.
 The program includes exercise recommendations and behavioral
counseling. In addition to a nutritionally balanced diet plan, exercise
recommendations and behavioral counseling are important facets of the
program to help you develop better eating habits.
 The program includes a weight-maintenance plan. Because weight
maintenance is much more difficult than weight loss, you don’t want to
be part of any program that sets you free after you’ve achieved your
goal weight. (See Chapter 10 for more about weight maintenance.)
Just like the health club or gym you decide to join, any diet program that’s
going to help you succeed at losing weight has to fit your personal lifestyle
because it’s going to be an important part of your lifestyle for some time to
come. Whatever type of program you decide to follow has to be conveniently
213
Chapter 11: Helping Yourself with Outside Resources

located, open during hours when you’re free to attend, recommend the type
of food you’re willing to eat, and be generally user-friendly if it’s to serve you
well in the long run. Before you sign up with any weight-loss program, be sure
you’re completely comfortable with the cost and methods used and that you
also feel satisfied that everyone involved in the program is qualified to do the
job they do.
Getting the Scoop on Medically
Supervised Programs
You can get help losing weight from a physician in an individual or group
medical practice that specializes in weight loss. Physicians who are board-
certified in bariatric medicine specialize in obesity, as do endocrinologists
and some family doctors. Many physicians also work with registered dieti-
tians to develop individualized diet plans. If you have a chronic medical con-
dition such as diabetes or heart disease, or if you take medication on a
regular basis, a medical doctor and/or registered dietitian may be a better
choice for you than a commercial weight-loss program.
Medically supervised weight-loss programs that administer very low-calorie
diet plans are sometimes appropriate for people who are more than 50
pounds overweight or have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or more (see
Chapter 2 for more about BMI). Medical doctors along with the services of
other healthcare professionals, such as nurses and dietitians, supervise
these plans.
For very good reason, health professionals monitor very low-calorie diets:
The diets are potentially dangerous to your health. Don’t ever go on any type
of very low-calorie diet or modified fast unless you’re under the care of a
physician who has given you a preliminary medical exam. While you’re fol-
lowing a medically supervised weight-loss plan, you’ll be subjected to fre-
quent blood tests, electrocardiograms, and weigh-ins to be sure that you’re
losing weight at an appropriate rate and that your body can handle the stress
of this program.
In the following sections, I explain the basics of medically supervised very
low-calorie programs.
Going lower than low
Medically supervised weight-loss programs that administer very low-calorie
diets are actually medically supervised fasts. If you join one of these pro-
grams, your daily diet will consist of mostly or only a liquid formula that pro-
vides 800 calories or less. The average weight loss on this type of modified
214
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

fast is about 3 to 5 pounds a week, or about 40 pounds in a three-month
period, which is the recommended length of time most people spend on this
type of diet.
Being on a very low-cal diet does have its benefits, beyond fast weight loss.
You’re under the constant care of a physician and other healthcare workers.
You’ll have no food decisions to make because you won’t be eating much
food, and what you do consume is preformulated. A modified fast can help
you break bad eating habits and feel more motivated to continue on a regular
weight-loss diet. For some people with urgent medical issues related to their
weight, a modified fast is the only way to achieve the type of dramatic weight
loss necessary to improve their health.
Any good medically supervised program, like any good weight-loss plan,
includes a follow-up maintenance program and will eventually reintroduce
you to normal eating.
Exploring your options
You find medically supervised weight-loss programs in hospitals, clinics,
medical centers, and sometimes through private physicians. Your primary
care physician can probably give you a recommendation for a program. All
medically supervised programs are similar in nature, but each plan has its
own food products and guidelines. If you’re investigating a very low-calorie
diet, you’ll probably be introduced to one of the following programs:
 Health Management Resources offers the choice of a very low-calorie
diet plan (520 to 800 calories) or a moderately low-calorie diet plan (up
to 1,200 calories). HMR plans include liquid meal replacement formulas,
prepackaged entrees, soups, and nutrition bars.
To find out more about what this program offers, check out www.
hmrprogram.com for a list of medical centers across the United States
that administer HMR weight-loss programs. Or call the customer rela-
tions department at 800-418-1367, Monday through Friday from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
 Optifast offers two very low-calorie plans (800 and 950 calories) and a
moderately low-calorie plan (1,200 calories). Like all medically super-
vised programs, Optifast includes liquid meal-replacement formulas plus
prepackaged soups and nutrition bars. Weekly education sessions are
mandatory. Dieters study new behavior strategies and diet habits while
using Optifast products to lose weight, before they’re reintroduced to
real food.
Although Optifast products are available to purchase online, anyone
who wants to supervise an Optifast program for overweight clients must
be a licensed physician. For more information and to find an Optifast
provider near you, go to www.optifast.com.
215
Chapter 11: Helping Yourself with Outside Resources

Health Management Resources and Optifast are the big names in medically
supervised weight-loss diets, but they aren’t the only weight-loss products
and programs affiliated with hospitals, medical centers, and physicians who
specialize in weight control. Your hospital group or private physician may
administer a similar program using products from a different company.
Beware of similar programs and products that are available without medical
supervision. Don’t ever put yourself on any diet that provides fewer than
800 calories a day. Even 800 calories is too low for most people for more
than a day or two, because your body can’t get all the nutrients it needs
at that calorie level.
Seeking Out Support Groups
Sometimes you just need a friend. After your weight-loss plan is in place, all
you have to do is follow it, but doing so is often easier said than done. If
you’re a compulsive overeater or you have a great deal of weight to lose and
you don’t have a good support network at home or at work, you may benefit
from joining a chapter of a national support group.
All support groups are fundamentally similar, but they each have their own
specific set of rules and expectations of their members. Some support groups
are more spiritually centered, some are more regimented, and some are more
narrowly focused to specific populations than others. You have to shop
around to find a group you’re comfortable with because even within the same
organization, each local chapter group has its own group dynamic.
The two main ones are Overeaters Anonymous (OA) or Taking Off Pounds
Sensibly (TOPS). These two nonprofit support groups provide motivation
and friendship to anyone who struggles with weight control. Even if you do
have a supportive bunch of friends and family (see “Asking Other Folks for
Help,” earlier in this chapter), you may still need the motivation of others
who’ve “been there.”
You can find OA and TOPS support groups all over the country, in almost every
city and town, holding meetings in free spaces such as church basements and
community centers. They don’t endorse or promote any specific weight-loss
plan or program. They exist to provide safe places where overweight people
can feel free to discuss their ideas and feelings, and seek the help and encour-
agement of others who fight the same food battles. I discuss these groups and
others in the following sections.
216
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

Overeaters Anonymous (OA)
OA is a 12-step recovery program for compulsive overeaters that is similar
to Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. Anyone who is seeking
freedom from obsessive overeating is welcome at meetings. The group’s 
foundation is abstinence from overeating, taking it one day at a time, and
recovery on physical, emotional, and spiritual levels. Members pay no dues
or fees, but usually make voluntary contributions at meetings to help cover
expenses.
To find an OA meeting in the United States, Canada, or one of more
than 50 countries around the world, start with the OA Web site at www.
overeatersanonymous.org. To contact Overeaters Anonymous, call
505-891-2664.
Taking Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS)
TOPS members provide each other with emotional support, and the organiza-
tion contributes money for obesity research. Members attend weekly meetings
where they weigh in and then attend a group program designed to help them
reach their weight-loss goals. The group programs may include handouts,
recipes, contests, sharing of personal stories, and lectures by local healthcare
professionals.
For more information about TOPS, check out its Web site at www.tops.org.
To find a TOPS chapter near you, call 800-932-8677.
Other groups
Although OA and TOPS don’t promote any specific types of weight-loss diets,
other support groups, such as Compulsive Eaters Anonymous (www.ceahow.
org) and Food Addicts Anonymous (www.foodaddictsanonymous.org),
do incorporate a strict food plan, known as an abstinence diet, into their 
programs.
When you join CEA or FAA, you agree to follow a diet that is free of sugar,
white flour, and any products made with refined carbohydrates. Although
this type of plan is more about abstinence than about losing weight, losing
weight and staying healthy is possible by incorporating the rules of absti-
nence into a well-planned low-calorie diet.
217
Chapter 11: Helping Yourself with Outside Resources

Considering Counseling
If your overeating feels out of control, if you’re more than just a little bit over-
weight and you know that your overeating is tied to emotional issues, if you
suffer from a poor or distorted body image, or if all the self-help strategies
you’ve employed just aren’t working for you and you don’t know why, you
may want to consider professional counseling. Depending on your particular
problems with food and weight control, you can get that type of counseling
from a registered dietitian or state-certified nutritionist, or a certified social
worker or psychologist who specializes in eating issues.
These types of professionals offer one-on-one counseling and sometimes work
with groups of dieters with related issues who may benefit from each other’s
experiences and help each other work out the issues that are preventing them
218
Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 
Working the Web for help with losing weight
Many legitimate and well-run support groups
have found a home on the Internet. The best
sites are affiliated with professional health or
weight-loss organizations or include advice
from professionals who are affiliated with such
organizations. Peer-led groups are sometimes
less reliable with respect to accurate weight-
loss information, but they can still provide the
friendship, support, and advice. Web-based
support groups are great if you can’t make it to
regular meetings, can’t find a group meeting in
your area, or just want additional access to
people with similar issues. Through the mes-
sage boards and chatrooms you’ll find on these
sites, you may even find other people who have
similar experiences with whom you can start a
small support group of your own.
Many helpful Web sites don’t include live chats
or message boards but do offer helpful, reliable
advice for calorie counters, fitness buffs, and
anyone concerned with weight control. The
best weight-management Web sites include the
following:
 America on the Move (www.americaon
themove.org)
 American Council on Exercise (ACE) (www.
acefitness.org)
 The American Dietetic Association (www.

from losing weight and keeping the weight off. To figure out whether you
would benefit from counseling, which type of counseling would be best for
you, and how to find a counselor, read on.
Selecting the best type of counseling
for your needs
If you eat to satisfy physical hunger and you overindulge for the fun of it and
that’s why you’ve gained weight, all you probably need to get back in shape is
a good low-cal diet and exercise plan, along with the advice of a counselor or
dietitian and the support of family and friends.
Eating to satisfy emotional hunger is a different story altogether. You may
need the help of a mental health professional such as a certified social
worker or psychologist who specializes in emotional overeating.
Understanding nutritional therapy
A registered dietitian or state-certified nutritionist can instruct you about
eating well and managing your weight. Unlike a psychologist, who concen-
trates on the underlying reasons for your eating behavior, a dietitian can
focus on your diet and eating behavior in the here and now. Unless a dietitian
also has a degree in social work or psychology, however, she can’t go out of
her scope of practice to delve too deeply into the why and how of your eating
problems. Likewise, a dietitian can outline exercise programs and explain the
role of exercise in a low-calorie lifestyle, but only a qualified trainer or physi-
cal therapist can help you develop a safe and productive exercise routine.
Getting psychological counseling
Different types of psychological counseling and different types of people
who are qualified to do it are available. The type of therapist who deals with
eating behavior is usually a certified social worker or psychologist trained
in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). A CBT professional incorporates
aspects of
 Cognitive therapy, which helps you to see that your own thinking is get-
ting in the way of your weight-loss success because you’re giving your-
self a distorted picture of your own life and your ability to take control
of your eating and exercise habits
 Behavioral therapy, which can help you change the fact that you react
to emotional situations by eating or overeating by substituting other
behaviors
By integrating the two disciplines, a CBT professional can help you work
through and change the negative thinking patterns, feelings, and behaviors
that interfere with your ability to have a normal relationship with food.
219
Chapter 11: Helping Yourself with Outside Resources

All good professionals stay within their scope of practice, giving advice only
in their area of expertise. A psychologist or social worker can help you with
the behavioral and psychological aspects of weight control, while a regis-
tered dietitian can help you with a sound food plan, and a certified trainer or
physical therapist can help you with your exercise plan.
Finding a therapist
A referral from a friend or family member is usually a good way to find a ther-
apist, but if no one in your immediate circle has successfully worked with a
psychologist, social worker, or dietitian, then the next best place to start is
with your primary care physician. If your family doctor is someone you like
and respect (and if he or she isn’t, maybe you need to find a new doctor),
then chances are you’ll feel the same way about other healthcare profession-
als he or she recommends. Hospitals also refer healthcare professionals who
are affiliated with them.
If these options don’t work for you, try contacting the following groups:
 American Dietetic Association

Part III: Overcoming Obstacles and Moving On 

Deciding to face your fears
One of the biggest barriers to losing weight is fear. It can be paralyzing. You
can’t move forward when you’re afraid to find out what lies ahead. Some food
and fitness fears are common:
 Fearing that you’ll be hungry on a low-cal diet
 Fearing that you’ll never be able to eat your favorite foods again
 Fearing that any food that contains fat will make you fat
 Fearing that you won’t be able to stick to an exercise program after you
sign up
You probably don’t need intense psychological counseling to deal with these
types of fears. You can probably alleviate these fears with the help of a good
weight-loss counselor or fitness trainer, or even someone who has been
successful at losing weight and keeping it off by watching calories and 
working out.
But you may have more deeply rooted fears about dealing with overeating
and you’ll recognize them because they probably affect other areas of your
life. If the following fears are interfering with your ability to take care of 
yourself, you may want to consider psychological counseling to deal with
them effectively.
 Fear of failure. This fear means that you have thoughts, such as “What if
I go through all the trouble of rearranging my life to accommodate a diet
and exercise program, and then I give up?”, “What if I reach my goal
weight but can’t keep the weight off?”, or “What will other people think if
I fail?” Remember that people who are successful at losing weight, or
anything else for that matter, have often failed several times before they
reached their goals. Those people who keep going gather valuable
lessons from their failures and eventually earn success.
 Fear of your own success. This fear often means you’re getting in your
own way with thoughts that include something like, “What if I lose
weight and nothing else changes?”, “What if I lose weight and people
think I’m a different person?”, “What if I reach my goals and I don’t like
the way I look?”, or “How will this weight-loss plan change my life, and
can I handle it?” If you’ve been overweight most of your life, your weight
is now a familiar part of you and, in some ways, you’re comfortable with
it. You can’t know how you’re going to feel when you lose your excess
weight, and that can be scary.
 Fear of change. If you have long-standing routines in your life — what
time you get up, what time you leave work, when and how you eat,
what you do before you go to bed — making changes may not be easy.
221
Chapter 11: Helping Yourself with Outside Resources

Remember: What you’ve been doing about your weight and your fitness
level up to this point hasn’t been working for you, so you’re going to
have to make both physical and psychological changes in order to
develop a healthier lifestyle.
 Fear of the hidden emotions that trigger your overeating. You may have
an emotional appetite; that is, you eat in response to your emotional state.
Anger, frustration, boredom, loneliness, and even happiness are all emo-
tions that can trigger your overeating. Review Chapter 9 for more insight
into your emotional appetite.

 Waking up to whole grains
 Scrambling to get going
H
ow often have you heard that breakfast is
the most important meal of the day? It’s
true! Your first meal kick-starts your metabolism
and provides the initial energy you need for physi-
cal and mental activity. When it comes to weight
loss, there are more good reasons to eat breakfast
than there are to skip it, and this chapter outlines
those reasons for you. You can find a variety of
recipes here that you can substitute for the sug-
gested breakfasts on the meal plans in Chapter 6.
This chapter contains plenty of tips for eating
breakfast on the go, making healthier food choices
for breakfast, and preventing breakfast boredom.
You can also find ideas that may appeal to you
even if you normally skip your morning meal.
Getting Off to a Good Start
Your first diet decisions of the day start with breakfast — when, where, why,
and how to have it, along with what to eat. Whether you eat breakfast at 6 a.m.
or noon, what follows are some compelling reasons to start the active part of
your day with a well-balanced meal, and several ways to make breakfast easier
and more appealing, whether you eat it at home, on the job, or, once in a
while, on the run.

Recognizing great reasons to eat breakfast
By definition, breakfast is the first meal of the day after a night of fasting. So
even though some people “skip” breakfast, everyone actually eats breakfast
at some point. Some just eat their first meal a little later in the day! You may
not feel hungry when you first wake up in the morning, or you may be afraid
that after you start eating, you don’t stop, so you put it off as long as possi-
ble. Perhaps your day starts later than most people’s. These reasons can all
be legitimate for delaying breakfast, but for some people, they can also be
habits that contribute to weight gain, especially if skipping an early morning
breakfast leads to overeating at the end of the day.
Although several medical studies have shown that people who skip breakfast
are more likely to consume more calories later in the day, more calories over-
all, eventually gain weight, and become obese than people who regularly
enjoy a morning meal, a small group of people in these studies are successful
at losing weight even though they don’t eat breakfast. If that is true for you,
then it doesn’t really matter if you eat breakfast first thing each day. But if
you’re like most people, routinely eating a balanced breakfast is essential to
losing weight and maintaining weight loss.
If you normally don’t eat when you first get up, you can try it while you’re on
this plan and see if eating breakfast stops you from overeating at other meals
and also helps you cut back on the overall number of calories you consume
each day. And if you normally do eat breakfast, don’t stop now. If the act of
eating breakfast is contributing to your weight problem, it’s because of the
amount of food you’re eating in the morning. On a low-calorie diet, you eat
less, which should help with your weight loss. Losing weight is always about
making changes, so either way, you’re making some sort of adjustment to
your usual breakfast routine that may help you stick to your low-calorie diet.
Sticking to a routine, making healthier breakfast food choices, limiting your
breakfast to 300 or 350 calories, and making sure you sit down and eat break-
fast before you get too hungry (so that you don’t overeat), are all more
important to weight control than the time of day you eat your first meal.
When you’re down to 1,000 or even 1,500 calories a day, it helps to cut calorie
corners wherever you can so that you can fit more food into your diet.
Sometimes you may need to cut portion sizes, but other times you can also
replace higher calorie foods with lower calorie foods. Table 12-1 has some
small, relatively easy breakfast food substitutions that can add up to big calo-
rie savings in the long run if they become permanent new eating habits.

If you’re not hungry when you wake up in the morning, perhaps you ate late
the evening before. The question is: Where does the cycle start? Do you
overeat at night because you didn’t eat much or at all during the first half of
the day, or do you skip meals earlier in the day because you ate so much the
night before? If late-night overeating seems to be affecting your weight, the
solution may be to start the day with some sort of breakfast and eat a reason-
able amount of food at least every three or four hours throughout the day so
that you’re not famished by late afternoon or early evening. Some people
think they’re saving calories by not eating in the morning, but that’s usually
not true. What usually happens is that your body misses those calories and
starts screaming for them as the day wears on. Many people who intention-
ally avoid eating in the early part of the day end up bingeing at night.
Even if skipping breakfast doesn’t contribute to your weight problems, the
following are several good reasons to eat a balanced meal early in the day:
 Your first meal of the day wakes up your metabolism and sets your 
calorie-burning gears in motion for the rest of the day. It makes sense to
get your metabolism fired up as soon as possible after you wake up.
 Breakfast boosts your blood sugar after a night of not eating, providing
the energy you need to start your day.
 Eating a balanced breakfast helps you stay energized and focused
throughout the morning.
 Breakfast is an opportunity to get a lot of the protein, carbohydrate,
fiber, vitamin C, calcium, and other vitamins and minerals you need each
day to stay healthy and energetic. Skipping this meal may mean you’re
cutting off a rich source of essential nutrients. (See Chapter 3 for more
about the nutrients you need in a low-calorie diet.)
227
Chapter 12: Benefiting from Breakfast

 Health experts say that people who eat breakfast have lower cholesterol
levels, on average, than people who don’t. Over time, eating breakfast
can help reduce your risk of developing heart disease.
Keeping your morning meals interesting
Do you avoid eating a balanced, nutritious breakfast because you feel like
you’re always eating the same foods? How many different ways can you eat
bland old bran cereal, right? Whoa! Your morning meal doesn’t have to bore
you back to sleep.
As with any meal, breakfast can consist of any food you like, as long as you
stick to your calorie limit and, ideally, make mostly healthful food choices. You
even can mix-and-match your meals. For instance, if you want to eat last night’s
spaghetti and meatballs again for breakfast today, or a bowl of chicken soup, or
even a reheated slice of pizza, go for it! This idea is especially good if you’re
pressed for time and want to pop something ready-made into the microwave
oven for an ultraquick meal. Just remember to stick to your calorie limits and
strive for nutritional balance when you’re borrowing foods from other meals.
Not everyone can eat dinner foods for breakfast, but almost everyone can eat
breakfast foods at any meal. Keep that point in mind when you’re tweaking
your menu plans or can’t think of anything you feel like having for dinner.
On days when you want something that resembles an ordinary breakfast,
however, you can find that most of the recipes later in this chapter are quick
to fix or that you can completely or partially prepare them in advance. You
can find plenty of ways to keep your low-calorie breakfasts interesting with-
out spending a lot of early-morning time fiddling around in the kitchen.
Eating on the run
For a low-cal dieter, gobbling down a quick breakfast as you walk out the
door may mean consuming the most dangerous calories of all — the forgot-
ten ones! If you’re keeping a food diary or any type of record of the calories
you consume each day, you may never account for the breakfast you eat on
the run. (See Chapter 4 for details on food diaries.) Bringing your breakfast to
work with you, where you can sit down and eat it in a more mindful fashion,
is another story, however, because you’re more likely to keep track of your
calories when you’re paying attention to what you’re eating.
If you find that you often have to pick up and leave home without having
breakfast, keep a selection of your favorite packaged foods on hand so you
can pack a quick, low-cal breakfast-to-go without a moment’s thought. Choose
foods that don’t require any further preparation or special packing beyond
maybe a plastic sandwich bag. Almost any food that comes packaged in indi-
vidual servings is a good idea. You want to be able to grab and go.

The following list includes some ideas for breakfast foods that are easy to
carry and easy to eat after you get where you’re going. These are healthy
choices that can tide you over until you have time to sit down to a full break-
fast. In the portion sizes given, you can easily incorporate these foods into
the breakfast and morning snack on your low-calorie diet plan. Pick a few that
make sense for you to keep on hand, not only for breakfast but also for light,
quick snacks any time of day.
 One piece of fresh fruit such as apples, oranges, grapes, nectarines,
plums, and pears
 Up to 1⁄4 cup dried fruit
 3⁄4 to 1 ounce of string cheese or other single-portion packages of cheese
 One or two large hard-cooked eggs
 Cinnamon-raisin bagel (2 ounces; half of a regular bagel or one very
small bagel)
 Cereal in individual boxes with a small container of skim milk
 Cereal bar (up to 150 calories)
 Yogurt with granola (up to 200 calories)
 6 to 8 ounces of yogurt smoothie
Drinking Up in the Morning
Dieters who normally don’t like to eat breakfast are sometimes happy to drink
their morning meal from a cup. (And I’m talking about drinking something a
little more substantial than a cup of coffee!) If you’re that type of dieter, one of
the smoothie shakes in this section may put a wake-up smile on your face.
If you don’t already own one, check out hand-held immersion blenders in the
kitchenware section of your department store (see Figure 12-1). An immer-
sion blender is a rod-shaped appliance with a blade at the end that can be
immersed into a tall cup, a pitcher, a bowl, or a saucepan. Basically, you bring
the blender to the food, rather than bringing the food to the blender. They’re
great for mixing up low-cal shakes and smoothies and much quicker and
easier to clean than regular blenders. If you cook on a regular basis, you may
find many other uses for an immersion blender, such as blending tomato
sauces and puréeing vegetable soups directly in the saucepan.

T Peanut Butter–Banana Shake
Half of a sliced orange complements this shake and brings your calorie count up to 300.
Double, triple, or quadruple the ingredients to make more servings, if you prefer. You
can freeze leftover shake mixture in individual freezer-proof containers for up to a
month. Transfer frozen shakes from the freezer to the refrigerator to thaw overnight.
The shake may discolor, but it will still taste great.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1⁄2 banana, cut up
1⁄3 cup plain fat-free yogurt
1 tablespoon sugar or honey
1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter
2 ice cubes, cracked
Combine the banana, yogurt, honey, peanut butter, and ice in a blender or food proces-
sor. Purée until thick and smooth. If you like thinner shakes, add a tablespoon or two of
water or orange juice and purée again until mixed. Serve cold.
Tip: If your banana is very ripe, you may not need the sugar or honey, thus saving a few
calories by leaving it out.

Counting calories at the coffee bar
A cup of Joe just isn’t what it used to be. Coffee
was once a 15-calorie wake-up call, if you drank
it black. A splash of milk and a spoonful or two
of sugar may have increased the calorie count
to 50, 75, or maybe even 100. Nowadays coffee
drinks come in every size and style, and low-cal
dieters really have to keep an eye on what they
drink at some of the coffee cafes today. A cup
of coffee may cost you almost a full day’s worth
of calories if you don’t know what you’re order-
ing. Large-size cups of latte, cappuccino, other
drinks with names ending in “appuccino,” hot
chocolates, white chocolate drinks, or any
coffee drink that has “creme” or caramel in its
name may contain upwards of 400 calories.
Some are as high as 600 or 700 calories.
How do you find out how many calories are 
in the coffee you’re ordering? Ask the server 
or look around the cafe for the nutrition
brochures that many of the larger coffee chains
make available in their stores and online.
T Tropical Fruit Smoothie
A bit of dried mint “wakes up” the flavor of this naturally sweet, creamy, eye-opener. To
meet your maximum calorie allowance, have your smoothie with a piece of toasted light
bread, spread with a teaspoon of butter, peanut butter, or jam.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 ripe mango or small papaya, peeled, seeded,
and cut up
1 banana, cut up
1 cup plain fat-free yogurt
1⁄2 cup fresh pineapple chunks or pineapple
canned in juice, drained
1⁄2 teaspoon dried mint
6 ice cubes, cracked
Combine the mango, banana, yogurt, pineapple, mint, and ice cubes in a blender or
food processor. Whirl until smooth. If you like thinner shakes, add a tablespoon or two
of water or orange juice and purée again until mixed. Serve cold.

Beginning Your Day with Berries
At 30 to 50 calories per 1⁄2 cup, strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries are
fabulous foods to include on a regular basis in a low-cal diet. They make great
snacks and great wake-me-ups whether you eat them out of hand, in a bowl
with a low-cal topping, or baked into bars.
In the following recipe, you cook up a delicious custard to serve with berries.
If you’ve never prepared custard, you may prefer to use a double boiler
instead of a saucepan to prevent the sauce from burning. If you don’t have a
double boiler, you can improvise by fitting a larger stainless steel mixing bowl
over a smaller saucepan filled with a few inches of simmering water. Make

A wake-up call for caffeine users
Most people who drink coffee or tea in the
morning know that the caffeine these drinks
contain is a mild stimulant that the body quickly
absorbs to provide a “wake up” effect in as little
as 15 minutes. A favorite word used by dietitians
everywhere is “moderation” and it applies as
much to drinking coffee, tea, and other caf-
feinated beverages as it does to eating. A range
of 200 to 300 milligrams (mg) is considered a
moderate amount of caffeine. That’s the aver-
age amount of caffeine in two or three cups of
regular brewed coffee, three to five cups of
brewed tea, or up to six 12-ounce cans of diet
cola or other caffeinated soft drinks.
Caffeine stimulates your central nervous system
and, as a result, increases your metabolic rate.
That’s why many over-the-counter weight-loss
supplements contain caffeine as their main
active ingredient. If you feel you benefit from the
effects of caffeine, however, get it from a drink
because caffeine is dehydrating. The caffeine
contained in beverages is somewhat offset by
the amount of liquid that accompanies it.
Although medical research has dispelled the
myth that drinking caffeinated beverages is a
potentially dangerous habit for healthy people,
you still don’t want to overdo it. If caffeine keeps
you awake at night or makes you feel nervous,
it can interfere with your daily functioning. If
caffeine helps cut back on the amount of food
you eat in the morning, you’re still building up an
appetite and may end up eating more calories
overall but eating them later in the day. If that’s
the case, you may also be bingeing on foods
that aren’t particularly healthful and losing out
on essential nutrients you would otherwise be
getting from a regular morning meal. Also, if you
have any medical problems, such as diabetes,
heartburn and reflux, or high blood pressure,
speak to your physician on the possible effects
of caffeine on your condition.
If you’re a heavy user, you probably experience
withdrawal symptoms when you cut back on
caffeine. Regular use of caffeine creates a
physical dependence that can lead to addiction.
The withdrawal symptoms of caffeine, which
can include headaches, anxiety, irritability,
lethargy, and even flu-like symptoms including
nausea and muscle pain, can start to kick in
within 12 to 24 hours of your last consumption.
Psychological studies have shown that some
people continue using caffeine simply to avoid
the withdrawal symptoms. People who suffer
significant withdrawal symptoms have reported
missing work and canceling social engage-
ments as a result. That’s when some mental
health experts say that caffeine can cause as
much of a psychological addiction as it can a
physical addiction.

sure the bottom of the bowl sits over, but not in the water, and keep the
water at a simmer. Follow the steps in the recipe, but combine the ingredients
in the bowl, rather than in the medium saucepan. Using this method, the cus-
tard is less likely to stick or burn because it cooks over simmering water
rather than over direct heat.

T Berries with Custard Sauce
This creamy, cook-ahead custard can help make the idea of fresh fruit more appealing
on a low-calorie diet. Have it on hand in the fridge to use as an all-purpose sauce to
enhance any fruit you’re having for breakfast, a snack, or even dessert. The custard
sauce alone provides about 120 calories per 1⁄2 cup. Use half that amount when you’re
serving it with fruit for a low-calorie snack.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes plus cooling
Yield: 4 servings
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon cornstarch
2 egg whites
1 whole egg
2 cups skim milk
2 teaspoons vanilla
Pinch ground nutmeg (optional)
4 cups blueberries, raspberries, strawberries,
blackberries, or a combination
1 Whisk together the sugar and cornstarch in a medium nonstick saucepan until blended.
Whisk in the egg whites, whole egg, and skim milk until smooth.
2 Place the saucepan over low heat and cook, stirring almost constantly, for about 10 min-
utes or until the custard mixture thickens and coats the spoon. (Don’t allow the custard
mixture to come to a full boil.) Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the
vanilla and nutmeg, if using. Cool the custard to room temperature.
3 Divide the berries evenly among four small bowls. Spoon the custard sauce evenly over
the berries. Store any leftover custard in a covered container in the refrigerator for up
to two days.

T Blueberry Breakfast Bars
I’m not encouraging you to eat on the run, but if you don’t have time to eat first thing in
the morning, or you just don’t like to eat the minute you get up, this bar is great to take
to work or on the road with you. You’ll never miss the butter, which I replace with a
healthier and lower-calorie mixture of olive oil and applesauce, and you’ll love the taste
and texture of fresh berries in this bar. You can have two bars for a 300-calorie breakfast
and still have enough calories left over for adding a good splash or two of milk to your
coffee.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes
Yield: 24 bars
Nonstick cooking spray
1 cup all-purpose flour
1⁄2 cup whole-wheat flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 cup packed light brown sugar
1⁄2 cup granulated (white) sugar
1⁄4 cup light olive oil
1 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 whole egg
2 egg whites
1 teaspoon vanilla
3 cups uncooked old-fashioned oats
11⁄2 cups fresh blueberries
1 Preheat the oven to 350. Line a 13-x-9-x-2-inch baking pan with aluminum foil. Coat the
foil with nonstick cooking spray.
2 In a small bowl, whisk together the flours, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.
3 In a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the brown sugar, white
sugar, oil, and applesauce until blended. Beat in the egg, egg whites, and vanilla. With 
a wooden spoon, stir in the oats and blueberries. Spread the mixture evenly in a pre-
pared pan.
4 Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges and a wooden pick
inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for ten minutes.
When slightly cooled, lift the foil from the pan and cut into 24 bars.

Bulking Up Your Fiber 
Intake with Grains
Ask a dietitian how to get more fiber into your diet and the answer will
inevitably be: “Eat more whole grains.” For breakfast, eating more whole
grains means choosing cereals, breads, muffins, pancakes, and other foods
made with oats, whole-wheat flour, cornmeal, brans, and other grain prod-
ucts. In this section, you find breakfast recipes that use all these ingredients.

Toast Topped with Ham, Tomatoes, 
Asparagus, and Hard-Cooked Egg
You hardly need a recipe because the name says it all. However, I suggest that you follow
the recipe because doing so ensures that you stay within your calorie limit. When substi-
tuting this dish for a menu-plan breakfast, add a cup of fresh fruit, 6 ounces of fruit juice,
or 1 cup of skim milk to bring the calorie count up to approximately 300. If you like, you
can omit the eggs in these breakfast sandwiches. You can save 35 or 40 calories if you do.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 6 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 slices light whole-wheat bread
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
8 thin slices lean deli ham
2 hard-cooked eggs, sliced
8 asparagus stalks, trimmed and steamed
4 thin slices firm, ripe tomato
2 ounces reduced-fat Swiss cheese,
shredded or cut into thin strips
1 Preheat the broiler. Place the bread slices in a single layer on a nonstick baking sheet.
2 Broil the bread 3 to 4 inches from the heat for 30 seconds on each side, or until lightly
toasted.
3 Lightly spread each slice of bread with mustard. Top the slices evenly with ham, egg
slices, asparagus spears, tomato slices, and cheese.
4 Broil the sandwiches 3 to 4 inches from the heat for 11⁄2 minutes or until the cheese is
melted and the sandwich is heated through. Serve hot.

1⁄2 cup all-purpose flour
1⁄2 cup whole-wheat flour
11⁄2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
3 eggs
1⁄3 cup packed light brown sugar
11⁄4 cups lowfat (1%) milk
11⁄4 cups unseasoned canned pumpkin
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 Stir together the flours, baking powder, pie spice, and salt in a large bowl. Set aside.
2 In a 2-cup measuring cup or medium bowl, stir together the eggs, brown sugar, milk,
pumpkin, and oil. Stir into flour mixture just until smooth.
3 Heat a nonstick griddle or a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Working in batches,
drop 1⁄4 cup of batter at a time onto the hot griddle. Cook until bubbles start to form on
the top of the pancakes and the bottoms are golden, about 2 minutes (see Figure 12-2).
Turn the pancakes over and cook for 2 minutes longer or until the bottoms are golden
brown.
Tip: To partially prepare pancakes in advance and save time in the morning, combine the
dry ingredients and the egg-oil mixture and store them separately in the refrigerator
overnight. The next morning, take them out of the fridge and let them stand at room tem-
perature for 10 or 15 minutes before mixing the batter and heating up the griddle.

Health experts recommend that most adults aim for about 25 grams of fiber
each day. Breakfast is the one meal that can really help boost your fiber intake
and strive to reach that goal, because so many typical American breakfast
foods — cereals, fresh fruits, dried fruits, and baked goods — are packed full of
the stuff. All whole-grain foods, vegetables, fruits, and legumes (beans, peas,
and lentils) are good sources of fiber, providing from 1 to 8 grams per serving.
Without having to keep track of yet another set of numbers, you can simply use
the following list as a guide to breakfast foods that are comparatively high in
fiber. Keep these foods in mind when you’re creating your weekly meal plans
and incorporate them wherever you can. (I list grains first, followed by fruits.)
 100 percent bran cereal
 Bran flakes cereal
 Raisin bran cereal
 Shredded wheat
 Granola with raisins
 Whole-grain waffles
 Whole-grain pancakes
 Whole-wheat bread

1 Preheat the oven to 300. Combine the oats, pecans, sesame seeds, and salt on a parch-
ment-lined, lipped baking sheet or 13-x-9-inch baking pan.
2 Bake for 30 minutes or until the oats and pecans are toasted. Remove the pan from the
oven. Increase the oven temperature to 350.
3 Meanwhile, combine the honey and oil in a small saucepan. Cook this mixture over
medium heat for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Drizzle
this syrup evenly over the toasted oat mixture, and then stir to mix well.
4 Bake the granola mixture for 10 minutes or until the oats are crisp, stirring every 2 or 
3 minutes.
5 Break up any clumps of granola with a wooden spoon. Stir in the cherries. When the
granola is completely cool, store it in a covered, airtight container.

Making Eggs-cellent Breakfasts
In many ways, eggs are the perfect diet food. They’re low in calories (about
75 per egg), high in protein, and easy enough for most people to prepare.
Eggs are filling, they lend themselves to a variety of food combinations, and
they travel well when hard-cooked, so you can take them with you to work,
school, or anywhere that you may suffer a hunger attack.
If you’re concerned about cholesterol in eggs, you can substitute 2 egg whites
for each whole egg called for in most recipes, or follow package directions for
using commercial egg substitutes.

Potato, Bacon, and Cheddar Omelet
When you’re on a low-calorie diet, having some recipes that yield just one serving on
hand is helpful, especially if it’s a recipe for food that doesn’t lend itself to reheating or
freezing. In this case, you can simply double, triple, or quadruple the recipe if you’re
serving more than yourself. Serve this omelet with a small piece of fruit or 1⁄2 cup orange
juice or lowfat milk.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
Nonstick cooking spray
1⁄2 cup diced peeled potato
1⁄4 cup finely chopped onion
1⁄4 cup fat-free chicken broth or water
Pinch of salt and pepper
1 slice Canadian bacon, chopped
1⁄4 cup finely chopped sweet red pepper
1 egg
2 tablespoons grated reduced-fat 
Cheddar cheese
2 tablespoons salsa (optional)
1 Lightly coat a small (7-inch) nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Place over
medium-high heat. Add potato and onion. Cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes or until
browned.
2 Stir in broth, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium; cover and cook 5 minutes.
Uncover and cook 2 to 3 minutes or until all the liquid evaporates. Stir in the bacon.
Transfer the filling mixture to a small bowl and cover to keep warm. Wipe out the skillet
with a paper towel.
3 Place the skillet over medium heat. Beat together the egg and cheese until well mixed.
Pour the egg mixture into the skillet and cook for 30 seconds.
4 Spoon the filling over half the omelet. Cover and cook for 1 minute or until the egg is
set. Fold the egg over the filling, transfer the omelet to a serving plate, sprinkle with red
pepper, and top with salsa, if using.

T Huevos Rancheros
Huevos Rancheros is Spanish for “ranch eggs.” This traditional breakfast dish of eggs
and salsa is served in many restaurants that feature Mexican and Tex-Mex fare.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
6 small (6-inch) fat-free flour tortillas
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 sweet green pepper, finely chopped

T Spanish Tortilla
In Spain, this flat, open-face omelet, topped with potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers, is
called a tortilla, which confuses some Americans because the recipe doesn’t have any
tortillas! With a single serving, on a 300-calorie breakfast plan, you have enough calories
left over to add a cup of fruit salad.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 tablespoon olive oil, divided
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 sweet red, green, or yellow pepper, finely
chopped
1 firm-ripe tomato, halved, seeded, and finely
chopped
1 medium Yukon Gold potato, cooked and cut
into 1⁄2-inch cubes
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
Nonstick cooking spray
5 eggs, lightly beaten
1⁄4 cup sliced Spanish olives
1 Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onion
and garlic and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the pepper and tomato and sauté for 3 minutes
longer. Add the potato and salt. Cover the skillet and cook, stirring often and adding a
spoonful or two of water if necessary to prevent sticking, for 8 to 10 minutes or until all
the vegetables are very tender. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl and cover to keep
warm. Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel.
2 Coat the skillet with nonstick cooking spray and place over medium heat. Add the
remaining teaspoon of oil, swirling the oil in the pan to evenly coat. Add the eggs. Cook
the omelet for 1 minute or until the eggs begin to thicken around the edge of the pan.
Run a thin spatula around the inner edge of the skillet to allow the uncooked egg to run
underneath the cooked egg. Repeat this for 2 to 3 minutes or until the center of the
omelet is set. If necessary, cover the skillet for 1 minute or until the omelet is cooked
through.
3 Slide the omelet onto a serving plate. Top the omelet with the vegetable mixture 
and sprinkle evenly with the olives. Cut the omelet into 4 equal wedges and serve 
immediately.

My first favorite thing about the following recipe is the way the strata puffs
up and makes a real show of itself in the oven. After it cools down a little, it
deflates and looks a little less dramatic, but at that point, all you want to do is
eat it, so who cares? My second favorite thing about this recipe is that it
looks and tastes nothing like diet food! This dish is very satisfying for calorie
counters.

Ham and Cheese Breakfast Strata
A strata is a casserole that you can prepare the night before and pop into the oven the
morning you plan to eat it. In many ways, this combination of bread, cheese, ham, and
egg custard is similar to a savory bread pudding. This low-cal version uses mostly egg
whites, lowfat milk, light bread, and reduced-fat cheese. You can also try it with hot
sauce or a dollop of salsa on the side.
Preparation time: 15 minutes plus standing time
Cooking time: 25 minutes plus 10 minutes standing time
Yield: 6 servings
Nonstick cooking spray
8 egg whites
4 whole eggs
11⁄2 cups skim milk
2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
3⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
8 slices light whole-wheat or oat bread
6 ounces lean ham or Canadian bacon,
chopped
1 cup shredded reduced-fat Cheddar cheese
1 About 15 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 425. Coat an 11-x-7-inch baking
dish with nonstick cooking spray.
2 Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat together the egg whites, whole eggs, milk, mustard,
salt, and pepper.
3 Overlap the bread slices in a single layer in the prepared baking dish (see Figure 12-3).
Sprinkle evenly with ham. Pour the egg mixture into dish. Sprinkle with cheese. Cover
with foil. Let the strata stand for 1 hour before baking or refrigerate for up to 10 hours.
(If you refrigerate, let the strata stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before
baking.)

4 Bake the strata for 10 minutes. Uncover and bake for 15 minutes longer or until the mix-
ture is set and the top is puffy and golden brown. Remove the strata to a cooling rack
and let it stand for10 minutes before slicing and serving.

Sausage on the side
You’re eating your egg-dominated breakfast,
and you’re probably craving a bit of sausage.
Have you ever tried making your own lean
breakfast sausage patties? Doing so is much
easier than you may think, just like making
turkey burgers but with slightly different sea-
soning. Two of these patties with a scrambled
egg and a slice of light whole-grain toast spread
with a spoonful of jam come to just about 300
calories.
In a large bowl, combine 1 pound lean ground
turkey or chicken breast, 1 cup cooked rice, 1⁄4
cup unsweetened applesauce, 1 tablespoon
Dijon-style mustard, 1 teaspoon salt, 1⁄2 teaspoon
dried sage, 1⁄4 teaspoon dried marjoram or
thyme, and 1⁄4 teaspoon ground black pepper
until well mixed. Shape the sausage into twelve
2-inch patties. Cook the patties in a nonstick
skillet over medium heat or under a preheated
broiler for about 3 minutes on each side.
You can freeze these patties, cooked or
uncooked, for up to a couple of months. Stack
two patties per package with a sheet of wax
paper between to keep them from sticking, and
then wrap in freezer-proof paper. Thaw the pat-
ties overnight on a plate in the refrigerator
before you plan to use them. Add a minute or so
to the cooking time if the patties are cooked
cold.

Crustless Bacon Quiche
Quiche is a great make-ahead food, something to have on hand in the refrigerator for
meals and also for snack attacks. Simply pop a slice in the microwave oven for 20 sec-
onds, and it’s ready to eat. When substituting a serving of this quiche for the breakfast
listed in any of the 300-calorie menu plans in Chapter 6, add a thin slice of cantaloupe or
a couple of fresh strawberries.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 35 plus 10 minutes standing
Yield: 4 main-dish servings or 8 to 12 snack or side-dish servings
Nonstick cooking spray
3 slices lean turkey bacon
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 finely chopped onion
1⁄2 cup finely chopped sweet red pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
1 cup part-skim ricotta cheese
1 cup plain lowfat yogurt
3 eggs
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1 Preheat the oven to 325. Coat a 9-inch pie plate with nonstick cooking spray.
2 Coat a large nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray and place the skillet over
medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until crisp. Remove the bacon from the skillet
and set aside on paper towels to drain. Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel.
3 In the same skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté for 5 min-
utes or until tender. Add the peppers and sauté for 2 minutes longer or until just tender.
Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the parsley.
4 Transfer the onion and pepper mixture to a large bowl. Crumble the bacon and add to
the bowl. Stir in ricotta cheese, yogurt, eggs, salt, and pepper until well mixed. Turn the
quiche mixture into the prepared pie plate.
5 Bake the quiche for 35 to 40 minutes or until just set in the center. Transfer the quiche
to a cooling rack for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
Vary It! This one basic recipe lends itself to countless low-cal variations. Try substituting 
1 cup of cooked, cubed chicken, 2 ounces reduced-fat Cheddar cheese, or 2 ounces finely
chopped lean ham for the bacon.

inding and eating a low-calorie lunch when
you’re at work can be a challenge, especially if
you don’t take a full or regular lunch hour or you
wait until you’re absolutely famished to take a food
break. When you’re first starting out on a struc-
tured, low-calorie diet, the smartest approach is to
bring your lunch from home. You have the most
control over how many calories you consume at
lunchtime when you prepare your own lunch.
After you have a good sense of how many calories
are in the different types of food you eat, and how
much food is a reasonable amount of food to eat at
one meal, then a trip to the salad bar becomes a
great option. You can quickly pick up prepared
foods at a salad bar and put together a balanced
meal.
In this chapter, you find tips for making healthy,
delicious lunches and 15 recipes for portable, 300-
calorie lunches, including salads, sandwiches, and
a few homemade soups, plus “add-ons” to the
menus when calories allow.

Putting Together Midday Meals
Lunch supplies the energy you need to move into your afternoon activities.
For a continuous energy flow, have your midday meal no more than 5 hours
after breakfast. When you’re following a low-calorie diet, a small mid-morning
snack can help bridge the energy gap between breakfast and lunch.
Packing a low-cal lunch
If you prepare two or three of the recipes in this chapter over a weekend,
you’re set with lunch entrees for the entire week. Try pairing some of the
recipes and bringing half a serving of a salad and a half-portion of one of the
soups one day and a soup-and-half-sandwich combo another day. That way
you aren’t eating the exact same lunch every day.
Make sure you have a variety of storage containers on hand to use for pack-
ing lunches to go. A wide-mouth thermos is best for soups, stews, and other
liquid lunches. Invest in a small assortment of lidded containers made for
carrying food. (You can find many decent, affordable ones at your local dis-
count store. Look for brands that are microwave-safe if you plan to reheat
your lunches.) Keep a set of utensils at work so you don’t have to remember
to pack plastic forks and spoons.
You always have the option of following the menu plans in Chapter 6 or using
them as a guide to preparing lunches that contain just the right number of
calories. Remember that the meals on these menu plans are interchangeable
so you can eat any one of the meals at any time of day. If you’re sticking to
1,200 calories a day right now and you see a breakfast menu on a 1,200-
calorie plan that you want for lunch tomorrow, pack it!
Using low-cal leftovers
The easiest lunch you can make is last night’s leftover dinner. If you have a
microwave oven at work, you can pack pre-portioned leftover food and
quickly heat it up at work and eat it before you have time to consider any-
thing else for lunch. Doing so is an especially good idea if you tend to get
250
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 

very hungry by the time you eat lunch so that you’re not tempted to run out
for higher-calorie fast food just to quickly satisfy that hunger. (See Chapter 14
for delicious dinner ideas that you can use as lunch the next day.)
When you’re eating dinner out or ordering in, think about leftovers for your
next day’s lunch. One of the most common restaurant tips for dieters is to
ask for your “doggie bag” in advance so that you’re not tempted to eat the
entire meal that’s served to you. Ask the server to divide your entree in half,
serve half now, and bring the leftovers at the end of the meal for you to take
home.
Mixing Salads
Main-dish salads are a staple in a low-calorie diet plan because they help fill
you up with plenty of nutritious low-cal veggies and still satisfy your hunger
because they contain a balance of ingredients that keep you feeling full
throughout the afternoon. I give you ideas on salads with chicken, meat,
seafood, grains, and fruit in the following sections.
Most foods lack flavor when served ice-cold, so try to remember to take your
salad out of the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before you’re ready to eat.
This step is especially true for pasta and rice salads.
Making salads with meat and poultry
Adding chicken, turkey, or any variety of meat transforms a side-dish salad
into an entree. You don’t have to add anything else to the dish because you
have everything you need for a balanced meal — protein, vegetables, and
grains or other starchy carbohydrates such as pasta or rice.

Meaty Potato Salad
This recipe demonstrates an age-old method of cutting fat to cut calories in a creamy
salad dressing by replacing half the original amount of mayonnaise with lowfat plain
yogurt.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 cups cubed (11⁄2 inches), unpeeled Yukon
gold potatoes
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar or rice wine
vinegar
1⁄4 cup light mayonnaise
1⁄4 cup lowfat plain yogurt
1 tablespoon mustard
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄8 teaspoon pepper
4 ounces lean ham
1⁄2 cup finely chopped red or green onion
1⁄4 cup finely chopped sweet red pepper
1⁄4 cup thinly sliced celery
1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley (optional)
1 Combine the potatoes and enough lightly salted water to cover by 1 inch in a large
saucepan. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-
low and simmer for 10 minutes or until the potatoes are just tender. Drain the potatoes
and place in a large bowl. Gently toss the potatoes with the vinegar. Set aside to cool.
2 Meanwhile, in another large bowl, combine the mayonnaise, yogurt, mustard, salt, and
pepper until blended. Add the ham, onion, sweet pepper, celery, and parsley. Toss gently
to combine. Gently stir in the potatoes. Serve at once or refrigerate to chill before serving.
Vary It! Substitute an equal amount of any lean meat, poultry, smoked poultry, firm-
fleshed fish, or egg white for the ham in this tasty, satisfying lunch entree.

Chicken Salad with Roasted Peppers 
and Toasted Pine Nuts
Packaged salad greens that include fresh herbs in the mix are a tasty addition to any
salad. They also make your cooking life easier by eliminating the need to season your
dressing; a simple oil and vinegar mixture works just fine. If you don’t have leftover
chicken for this recipe and don’t feel like cooking, you can use precooked chicken from
your supermarket’s deli section.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 3 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 Place the pine nuts in a small heavy skillet over medium heat. Toast, stirring often, until
the nuts just begin to turn golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove the nuts from the
skillet and set aside to cool.
2 Whisk together the olive oil and vinegar in a large salad bowl. Add the chicken, peppers,
and pine nuts. Toss to mix. Add salad greens and toss again. Serve at once.
Vary It! Fresh cherry tomatoes work just as well in the place of the red peppers.

Chinese Chicken Noodle Salad
This recipe is a simple pasta salad with a tasty Asian twist. If you don’t have leftover
chicken, you can use precooked chicken from your supermarket’s deli section. You can
use the basic dressing — a soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice wine vinegar combination —
on any green salad or side-dish vegetable that you prepare to go with an Asian-style
meal. The dressing alone contains 50 calories per tablespoon, which is equivalent to a
light dressing. You can serve this dish warm, cool, or at room temperature.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 6 servings
8 ounces angel hair pasta or thin spaghetti
1⁄2 head of broccoli, cut into bite-size florets
(11⁄2 cups) or 1 box frozen chopped broccoli,
thawed
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar or white wine
vinegar
1 tablespoon soy sauce
3 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
11⁄2 cups cubed, cooked chicken (8 ounces)
1 Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of boiling salted water according to the package
directions until al dente, or firm to the bite. Add the broccoli to the saucepan for the
final 2 minutes of cooking time. Drain thoroughly.
2 Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the sesame oil, vinegar, and soy sauce. Stir in scal-
lions and set aside.
3 Add the drained pasta and broccoli to a bowl with the chicken and the reserved sauce
and gently toss.
Vary It! You can substitute an equal amount of leftover pork or cubes of tofu for the
chicken in this recipe, if you prefer.

Diving into seafood salads
Just like meat and poultry, fish and shellfish add the protein necessary to call
a low-calorie salad a meal. Compared to other forms of protein, seafood is
often lower in calories and fat. And even when you choose slightly fatty
seafood such as salmon or albacore tuna, the additional calories aren’t usu-
ally significant. Furthermore, with these fattier fish you get an added bonus
of health-enhancing omega-3 fatty acids that help protect your heart from dis-
ease. If these recipes look interesting but you don’t eat seafood, you can try
them with chicken, turkey, or pork.

Tossing together grain and fruit salads
Salads made with pasta, rice, or even fruit add variety and interest to a low-
calorie diet, not to mention numerous nutrients and much-needed fiber. You
can fiddle with the three basic recipes in this section by substituting different
fruits and vegetables, trying different cheeses, and using different pasta shapes
and different types of rice.

T Italian Rice Salad
The calories from regular cheese are factored into this recipe so that you’re not limited
to eating only cheeses that have been modified to reduce fat and calories. If you want to
substitute reduced-fat/reduced-calorie cheese such as Swiss or havarti, you can add an
extra ounce to the recipe and still come in under 300 calories. If you stick with lower
calorie reduced-fat cheese, you can have a 1⁄4 cantaloupe or a slice of honeydew melon
on the side.
Preparation time: 5 minutes plus rice cooking time
Yield: 6 servings (about 3⁄4 cup per serving)
2 cups cooked white or brown rice
2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
1 cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced
1 tablespoon capers, drained and chopped
8 green or black pitted olives, finely chopped
4 ounces fontina or provolone cheese, diced
1⁄4 cup finely chopped fresh basil
1⁄4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice or white wine
vinegar (optional)
Salt and pepper
Combine the rice, tomatoes, cucumber, capers, olives, cheese, and basil in a large bowl.
Toss the ingredients to mix well. Just before serving, drizzle in the olive oil and lemon
juice, if using, and toss again. Season the salad with salt and pepper to taste.
Tip: Whenever you cook up a pot of rice for dinner, prepare a double batch so that you can
use the leftovers to make rice salads such as this one for lunch during the workweek.

T Pasta Salad with Tomato, 
Mozzarella, and Basil
Whenever you’re cooking pasta for dinner, make extra so you’ll have it on hand for
pasta salads such as this recipe. You can use any stubby-shaped pasta for this recipe. If
you like, serve this salad on a bed of fresh spinach leaves without significantly changing
the calorie count.
Preparation time: 5 minutes plus 20 minutes to cook the pasta, if necessary
Yield: 4 servings
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 cups cooked penne, rotelle, or other stubby
shaped pasta
2 ounces reduced-fat mozzarella cheese,
diced
1⁄4 cup finely chopped fresh basil
1 large ripe tomato, diced
Salt and pepper
Whisk together the olive oil and lemon juice in a large bowl. Add the pasta, cheese, and
basil. Toss well to combine. Add the tomato and gently toss again. Season the salad
with salt and pepper to taste.

Whenever you make a rice, pasta, or grain salad in advance, reserve half the
dressing to add just before serving. Otherwise, the starchy ingredients soak
up all the dressing overnight and dry out the salad. If that happens, you have
to add more dressing (and more calories!) to make the salad palatable again.
If you’re making the salad to take to work, you can still prepare it in advance.
Simply carry the leftover dressing in a separate container until you’re ready
to eat.

The same idea holds true for green salads, mixed vegetable salads, and fruit
salads. Add the dressing just before eating so that the ingredients don’t soak
up the liquids and get soggy.
If your recipe makes more servings than you’re going to use in one sitting,
dress only the portion you’ll be eating at that meal. Pack the leftover salad
and dressing separately.

T Pear and Blue Cheese Salad 
with Walnuts
This recipe is a little treat for blue cheese lovers. Serve with a small roll or a couple of
thin breadsticks to round your calories up to 300.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 2 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons finely chopped walnuts
1⁄4 cup light mayonnaise
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, divided
2 teaspoons honey
2 large firm-ripe red or green pears
4 cups torn lettuce leaves
1 small celery rib, thinly sliced
2 green onions, thinly sliced
2 ounces (about 1⁄4 cup) crumbled blue cheese
1 Toast the walnuts in a small, heavy, nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring con-
stantly, for 2 minutes, or until just fragrant. Remove the nuts from the skillet and set
aside.
2 Whisk together the mayonnaise, 2 teaspoons of the lemon juice, and the honey in a
large serving bowl. If you’re not serving or eating the salad right away, refrigerate the
dressing until ready to use, up to 5 days.
3 Thinly slice the pears and drizzle them with the remaining lemon juice. Divide the let-
tuce, pears, celery, and green onions between two serving plates. Drizzle with dressing
and sprinkle with blue cheese and toasted nuts.

Serving Up Sandwiches
Any type of food that helps you feel full is helpful when you’re on a low-calorie
diet. Sandwiches certainly fit the bill because, like main dish salads, they
often include all the components of a full meal — protein, grain, and vegeta-
bles. Any meal or snack that contains several different foods from different
food groups can help you feel full longer and provide more sustained energy
than if you were to simply grab one type of food for lunch. That’s why a sand-
wich makes more sense for lunch than, say, an all-vegetable salad or a couple
of slices of ham on their own.
When you follow the sandwich recipes in this section, you’ll know that your
lunch contains up to 300 calories. But what about ordering a sandwich at a deli
or sandwich shop? When in doubt about the number of calories, eat just half
the sandwich and fill up on a green salad with light dressing. You can always
have the rest of the sandwich later as a snack or save it for the next day.

T Pita Pizza with Artichokes and 
Mozzarella Cheese
You can prepare these pita pizzas up through Step 2, and then wrap them tightly in plastic
wrap to carry them to work. Unwrap the pizza and microwave each at full power for 1
minute to heat through and melt the cheese. Serve the pizza with a 1⁄2 cup serving of soup.
Preparation time: 10 minutes plus thawing time
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 Preheat the oven to 450. Place the pita breads on a nonstick baking sheet.
2 Whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, and oregano in a medium bowl. Add the arti-
choke hearts and tomato. Toss gently to coat. Spoon the artichoke mixture evenly over
the pita rounds. Sprinkle evenly with the cheese.
3 Bake the pita pizzas for 6 to 8 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the pitas are
heated through.
Per serving: Calories 187 (From Fat 66); Fat 7g (Saturated 2g); Cholesterol 7mg; Sodium 302mg; Carbohydrate 24g

2 small (6 inch) pita breads
2 teaspoons olive oil
1 teaspoon lemon juice
Pinch of dried oregano
3 frozen artichoke hearts,
thawed and chopped
1⁄4 cup finely chopped tomato
1 ounce shredded light
mozzarella cheese

Many sandwich shops pride themselves on the amount of filling they can
stuff into a sandwich. They want their customers to feel they’re getting a
good deal for their money. An overstuffed sandwich is rarely a good deal for a
dieter, however, and sometimes even a half sandwich contains too many calo-
ries. Remove at least half the meat or other filling in an overstuffed sandwich
before you eat it; ask the sandwich maker for a clean piece of foil, if possible,
and wrap it to use another time.
T Herbed Roast Pepper and 
Goat Cheese on Crusty Rolls
You can broil these sandwiches at home, cool and wrap them, and then gently reheat
them in a toaster oven or microwave oven at work. They’re also good cold. To save a
little time, you can use jarred roasted red peppers instead of roasting your own.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
262
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 
1 Preheat the broiler. Place the rolls, cut-side up, on a broiler rack or pan. Broil the rolls
for 1 minute or until lightly toasted. Set the bread aside.
2 Place the onion slices and pepper halves, cut-side down, on a clean broiler pan. Sprinkle
the rosemary evenly over the vegetables. Drizzle evenly with the olive oil. Salt and
pepper to taste.
3 Broil the vegetables 4 to 6 inches from the heat for 5 minutes or until the peppers are
charred. Turn the onions over after 2 minutes or when they begin to brown. Remove the
charred peppers from oven. Set aside to cool slightly, and then peel off the charred skin
and cut the peppers into thick slices.
4 Arrange the peppers and onions over the bottom halves of the toasted bread. Sprinkle
the sandwiches evenly with the cheese.
5 Broil the sandwiches side-by-side for 3 minutes or until the cheese is slightly browned.
Top the sandwiches with the remaining bread halves, cut in half, and serve.
Tip: If you can’t find lower calorie, reduced-fat goat cheese, use regular semisoft goat
cheese and reduce the amount to 1 ounce.
Per serving: Calories 289 (From Fat 108); Fat 12g (Saturated 4g); Cholesterol 6mg; Sodium 706mg; Carbohydrate

2 small crusty rolls (2 ounces each), split

Concerning sandwich condiments and ingredients, mayonnaise may not
always be a wise choice because it’s so dense in calories. Some diet plans
recommend eliminating mayonnaise altogether and choosing lower calorie
spreads such as ketchup or mustard, while others recommend using
reduced-calorie (light), reduced-fat, or fat-free mayonnaise or a combination
of mayonnaise and yogurt.
Because it’s a matter of taste as well as a matter of calories, you have to decide
what to eat and when. If you’re preparing a sandwich made with low-calorie
bread and a low-calorie filling, you may well be able to afford the almost 100
calories that come with a tablespoonful of mayonnaise.
Table 13-1 shows a tablespoon-for-tablespoon comparison of the calorie
counts of different bread spreads and different combinations that help
reduce calories in the creamier condiments.

Chapter 13: Preparing Tasty Lunches

Toasted Italian Bread with Herbed 
Tuna-White Bean Spread
This recipe makes 2 cups of topping, which, on its own, provides 25 calories per table-
spoon. Plan to make this spread in advance, because it needs at least two hours in the
fridge for the flavors to marry. You can also toast the bread in advance and store the
slices in an air-proof container until ready to use. This recipe also makes great party fare.
Preparation time: 10 minutes plus 2 hours sitting time for spread
Yield: 8 servings
264
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 
1⁄2 cup parsley leaves
1⁄4 cup basil leaves or 2 teaspoons dried basil
1⁄4 cup coarsely chopped red onion
1 cup canned cannellini or navy beans, rinsed
and drained
2 tablespoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons light mayonnaise
2 tablespoons light ricotta cheese or light
cream cheese
1 teaspoon drained capers
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 can (61⁄2 ounces) tuna packed in water,
drained
l loaf Italian bread (12 ounces), cut into 24
slices, toasted
1 Combine the parsley and basil in a food processor. Process 30 seconds or until finely
chopped.
2 Add the onion, beans, lemon juice, mayonnaise, ricotta, capers, and salt. Process with
on/off motions for 30 seconds or until the mixture is finely chopped but not smooth,
scraping down the side of the processor container with a spatula, as necessary. Add the
tuna and process with on/off motion just once or twice to combine.
3 Scrape the mixture into a serving dish or storage container. Cover and refrigerate for at
least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend. Spread the topping on the toast just before
serving. Top with pickle slices, if you like.
Tip: For a snack or a lighter lunch, spread this savory topping on cucumber rounds, which
are practically calorie-free.

Savoring Soups
Soup is a great choice on a low-cal diet because broth provides so few 
calories — it’s almost like filling up on flavored water. Each of the recipes
in this section comes with side-dish recommendations. Of course you can
always skip them and pour yourself another ladleful of soup.
Turkey Noodle Soup
If you’ve ever wondered what to do with the packaged collection of vegetables in your
supermarket called “soup greens” (the package that usually includes an onion, some
carrots, some celery, and a turnip or parsnip), this recipe is it. You can pick up that
package instead of selecting the individual vegetables used in this soup. Sprinkle a
dozen oyster crackers over this soup, if you like, to use up the remaining calories.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 50 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
265
Chapter 13: Preparing Tasty Lunches
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, diced
2 carrots, diced
1 celery stalk, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1 small turnip, diced
2 cans fat-free chicken broth
1 can (141⁄2 ounces) recipe-ready diced
tomatoes
8 ounces turkey tenders
1 teaspoon dried sage or basil
11⁄2 cups broken angel hair pasta or other thin
noodles
Salt and pepper
1 Heat the oil in a large nonstick saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté
5 minutes or until tender. Add the carrot, celery, and garlic, and sauté 5 minutes longer.
Add the turnip, chicken broth, tomatoes, turkey tenders, and sage. Simmer 20 to 30 min-
utes or until turkey is just cooked through. Remove the turkey from the soup to a cut-
ting board.
2 Bring the soup to a boil over medium heat. Add the pasta and cook for 4 minutes or
until the noodles are tender.
3 Meanwhile, cut the turkey into bite-size pieces. Stir the turkey back into the soup.
Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.

Obviously, different types of soup are going to contribute different amounts
of calories, depending on the ingredients, so when you eat soup in a restau-
rant or order it for take-out at a deli, you’re not going to know exactly how
many calories it contains. The only thing you can do is think small, especially
if it’s a creamy or dense soup such as lentil or puréed winter squash soup. In
that case, always ask for a cup instead of a bowl and order the small size to
go, rather than medium or large.
Spicy Corn Chowder with Ham
Whole milk adds extra creaminess to this hearty classic, but you can stick to skim if you
prefer. With a one-cup serving, you can have a small (1-ounce) square of cornbread or
half of a corn muffin on the side.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes
Yield: 6 servings (scant 11⁄2 cups each)
266
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, diced
2 cans (141⁄2 ounces each) or 4 cups fat-free
chicken broth, divided
1 can (15 ounces) corn kernels, drained
2 cups whole milk
1 sweet red or yellow pepper, halved, seeded,
and diced
1 jalapeno pepper, halved, seeded, and
minced
8 ounces all-purpose potatoes, peeled and
cut into 1⁄2-inch dice
4 ounces lean ham steak, diced
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 Heat the oil in a large nonstick saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and sauté
5 minutes or until tender. Add 1 can (2 cups) of the broth and the corn. Heat the mix-
ture to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes.
2 Using a slotted spoon or small sieve, transfer 11⁄2 cups of the corn-broth mixture from
the saucepan to a food processor or blender. Whirl until almost smooth. Return the
pureed mixture back to the saucepan.
3 Stir in the remaining chicken broth, sweet pepper, jalapeno pepper, potatoes, ham, and
salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to medium-low, stir in the milk, and
simmer the soup for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.
Vary It! You can substitute an equal amount of lean turkey bacon or Canadian bacon for
the ham in this recipe.

White Bean Soup with 
Kale and Sausage
This recipe calls for kale, which is a leafy green vegetable that’s sweeter than spinach
and even more nutritious. You can substitute fresh or frozen spinach, collards, or other
leafy greens for the more traditional kale used in this recipe, if you like. To chop fresh
kale, be sure to slice across the leaves, as shown in Figure 13-1.
Round out this soup with a slice of light rye bread or sliced tomatoes drizzled with light
dressing.
Preparation time: 5 minutes

1 Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large nonstick saucepan over medium heat. Prick the
sausages all over with a fork. Add the sausages to the saucepan. Cover and cook for
8 minutes or until well browned and cooked through. Transfer the sausages to paper
towels to drain. Carefully wipe out the skillet with a paper towel, if necessary.
2 Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add the
onion, carrot, and garlic and sauté, stirring often, for 5 minutes or until the vegetables
are tender.
3 Meanwhile, thinly slice the sausages. Add the beans, kale, broth, and sausage slices to
the soup. Simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Uncover and stir in the vinegar and
salt and pepper to taste.

diet will be. That’s why you need to have a simple system in place that includes
some advance meal planning for you and anyone who eats with you and a goal
to enjoy your dinner at a reasonable pace.
Planning ahead
The following are some ways you can be sure you have low-calorie dinners
on hand when you’re ready to eat:
 Be prepared. Have a stock of low-calorie convenience foods such as
canned soups and packaged salad mixes in your cupboards and fridge
for those nights when you don’t feeling like cooking.
 Keep the basics stocked. Keep staples such as dry pasta, rice, bottled
tomato sauces, light bread, lean meats, eggs, and low-fat dairy products
on hand at all times so that you always have the fixings for at least one
full meal.
 Plan ahead. When preparing the specific recipes in this chapter, plan
your meal schedule and include the suggested side dishes (or the equiv-
alent) on your shopping list.
 Cook on weekends. Review your menus for the upcoming week and do
as much advance preparation as you can over the weekend when you
have more time.
Portioning out
When you prepare a recipe that makes, say, four servings, sticking to that
size serving is important. Otherwise you run the risk of adding unwanted
calories to your meal. As soon as you prepare the dish, divide it up evenly
and put your portion on your plate. If you’re eating alone, wrap up the
remainders and put them in the refrigerator or freezer as soon as possible
after cooking so you’re not tempted to go back for more.
Freeze or refrigerate leftovers in single-serving size containers that can go
directly into a microwave oven. That way, you have homemade convenience
foods on hand that fit right into your low-calorie diet plan for another dinner
or a ready-to-go lunch.
270
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 

Feeding the rest of the family
The recipes and menu ideas in this chapter have been developed to be as bal-
anced, nutritious, and tasty as possible for the amount of calories they provide.
Except for the controlled calorie limits, they’re no different than anything else
you can feed your family. So you don’t have to cook separate food for yourself
just because you’re limiting your calories to 300, unless you want to.
Family members who aren’t following this low-calorie plan and who want or
need more food for dinner can obviously choose to eat larger portions or
expand the meal with other foods.
Preparing Pleasing Poultry Dishes
Poultry has made a name for itself as one of the best low-cal, high-protein
food choices for anyone who is trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy
weight. Because chicken and turkey are pretty much interchangeable, you
can use either one in any of the recipes in this section.
Chicken and turkey parts prepared in a microwave oven cook quickly and
turn out moist and tender, just like poultry that has been steamed or stewed.
To cook plain poultry, place four even-size pieces (4 to 6 ounces each) in a
microwave-safe container. If you prefer, brush the poultry lightly with olive
oil or gravy before cooking. Cover the container and cook at full power for
8 minutes. Let it stand for 5 minutes before uncovering. Insert a fork or knife
tip into the flesh to be sure juices run clear. Clear juices let you know the
poultry is fully cooked.
Fixing quick chicken dinners
When surveyed, home cooks say they serve chicken for dinner more often
than any other meat. That makes sense for dieters, too, because chicken is a
lean source of high-quality animal protein. Chicken’s neutral flavor also makes
it easy to incorporate into the tasty, globally-influenced recipes included in
this section.

Skillet Chicken Parmesan
This classic dish is prepared in a not-so-classic low-cal style, which simply means mea-
suring ingredients carefully and omitting the initial breading and frying of the chicken
breasts.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 6 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
272
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 
12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breasts,
cut into four equal pieces
Vegetable cooking spray
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup marinara sauce
1⁄2 cup shredded reduced-fat mozzarella
cheese
1⁄4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap. Pound to 1⁄4-inch thick-
ness with a meat mallet or the bottom of a small heavy saucepan (see Figure 14-1).
2 Coat a large nonstick skillet with vegetable cooking spray and place over medium-high
heat.
3 Add the chicken to the skillet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to medium.
Cook 3 to 5 minutes or until the chicken is lightly browned on the bottom. Turn the
chicken over. Add the marinara sauce to the skillet. Cover and cook 2 to 4 minutes
longer or until the chicken is just opaque in the center.
4 Sprinkle the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses evenly over the chicken breasts. Cover
and cook 1 to 2 minutes or until the cheese melts. Serve hot.
Tip: You can substitute a serving of chicken and sauce with 1⁄2 cup cooked spaghetti and
1⁄2 cup steamed broccoli for any 300-calorie meal in the basic menu plans in Chapter 6.

Poached Chicken Breasts 
with Spinach-Basil Sauce
This dish is an example of true low-calorie fare because it uses both low-calorie ingredi-
ents and a low-calorie cooking technique. When you prepare this type of main dish for a
300-calorie meal, you end up with 100 calories to “spend” on the side dish of your
choice. This dish is also delicious cold so you can take leftovers for lunch the next day
or make it ahead to serve as a cool summer supper.

The following recipe calls for fresh breadcrumbs. You may think that making
these crumbs is a difficult task, but it’s not! Just place slices of light bread in a
food processor and pulse with an on/off motion until fine crumbs are formed.
When you’re measuring the crumbs, pack them loosely into the measuring cup.

Putting a new twist on turkey
You’d never know that not too long ago, fresh turkey was used mostly for hol-
iday foods and rarely served at regular everyday meals. Now you can buy as
many different cuts of turkey in the supermarket as you can chicken, and
ground turkey and turkey often substitute for beef or pork in classic dishes
such as the stuffed peppers in this section. Even better, you can also buy pre-
cooked fresh turkey almost everywhere to use on sandwiches and in recipes
that call for cooked or leftover turkey, such as the open-face turkey sandwich
recipe in this section.
Hot Turkey Sandwiches
An open-face sandwich on a single slice of bread is one great way to enjoy your favorite
flavors by cutting back on the amount of food you eat, rather than eliminating “added”
calorie foods like gravy from your diet altogether. Serve this recipe with steamed green
beans or a tossed green salad drizzled with 1 or 2 teaspoons of light dressing.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

4 large sweet red, yellow, or green peppers,
halved lengthwise and seeded
8 ounces lean, sweet Italian-style turkey
sausage, removed from casings
11⁄2 cups cooked rice
3⁄4 cup shredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
11⁄2 cups marinara sauce
1 Preheat the broiler. Arrange the peppers, cut side down, on a broiler pan.
2 Broil the peppers 4 inches from the heat for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they just start to
blacken in spots but are still firm. Transfer the peppers, cut side up, to a 9-inch square
baking dish. Set aside.
3 Preheat the oven to 375.
4 In a large nonstick skillet, cook the loose sausage over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes
or until just cooked through, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon. Remove the
skillet from the heat and stir in the rice, cheese, and Italian seasoning. Divide the rice
mixture evenly among the pepper halves, packing the mixture into the peppers with a
spoon. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
5 Bake the peppers for 20 minutes or until tender.
6 Meanwhile, heat the marinara sauce in the same nonstick skillet, scraping up any
browned bits of sausage with a wooden spoon. Spoon a little of the sauce over the pep-
pers halfway through baking time. Serve the remaining sauce with the peppers.

Making the Most of Meat
Meat is great source or protein and hard-to-get minerals such as iron and
zinc, but it can also be high in calories, especially when you choose fattier
cuts or eat too much of it. That’s especially true if a lot of your meat is
coming from fast-food restaurants. But the meat you cook at home doesn’t
have to be a diet-buster or a health hazard. The following are two great ways
to enjoy meat without overdoing it:
 Treat meat more like a condiment than a main dish. In other words,
use very small amounts of meat to flavor foods like soups, stews, rice
dishes, pastas, and casseroles dishes, such as lasagna.
 Cut back on portion sizes. You probably do the same thing with all your
other favorite foods when you’re trying to get to or stay at a healthy
weight. So if you’re a meat-and-potato type, you can continue to enjoy
those foods on a low-calorie diet by choosing leaner cuts and eating less
meat (and fewer potatoes) overall.
Beefing up your meals
This section includes two easy, beefy recipes that are guaranteed to please
dieters and nondieters alike. One is a recipe for kabobs marinated in sweet,
teriyaki-style marinade, and the other is a classic steak-and-potatoes combo.
A wonderful, calorie-free way to flavor meats is with dry spice rubs that you
simply rub onto the meat with your hands before cooking. A spice rub is
simply a combination of herbs and/or spices rubbed over the surface of
lightly oiled meat before it’s cooked. This combination is especially good for
beef or lamb. To make a spice rub, combine 1 tablespoon paprika, 2 tea-
spoons crushed rosemary, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon crushed
fennel seed, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper,
1⁄2 teaspoon ground red pepper, and 1⁄2 teaspoon salt. Use about 1 tablespoon
per pound of meat, and allow the rubbed meat to stand at room temperature
for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour before cooking so the seasoning mix
has a chance to permeate the meat.

Asian Beef Kabobs
A simple soy-sauce–based marinade that you can also use for poultry and fish flavors
this recipe. To round the menu out to a 300-calorie meal, serve with 1⁄2 cup ramen noo-
dles and a cucumber and radish salad drizzled with rice wine vinegar or another fla-
vored vinegar and a pinch of salt.
Tools: 8 bamboo skewers
Preparation time: 15 minutes plus 20 minutes marinating
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
280
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
11⁄2 tablespoons dry sherry
11⁄2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon dark sesame oil
1 clove garlic, minced
1⁄4 teaspoon ground ginger
8 ounces boneless beef top sirloin, cut into 
1⁄4-inch thick slices
3 green onions, cut into 11⁄2 inch pieces
1 Combine the sugar, sherry, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger in a medium-size
bowl. Measure out and reserve 1 tablespoon of the marinade. Add the beef to the bowl
with the remaining marinade and stir to coat. Marinate the beef in the refrigerator for at
least 20 minutes.
2 Soak 8 bamboo skewers in water for 10 minutes to prevent them from burning under the
broiler. (If you’re using metal skewers, this step is unnecessary.)
3 Preheat the broiler. Line the broiler pan with foil for easier cleaning. Remove the beef
from the marinade and discard the marinade. Alternately thread the beef, weaving back
and forth, and green onion pieces onto skewers. Arrange the skewers on the broiler pan.
4 Broil the kabobs about 3 inches from the heat for 3 minutes. Turn the skewers and broil
another 2 to 3 minutes or until desired doneness, basting the meat once with the
reserved marinade.

Picking pork and ham
Thanks to changes in agricultural systems and animal feeding, the pork you
buy in the supermarket is actually about 30 percent leaner these days than it
was 20 or 30 years ago. Those changes mean ounce for ounce, pork is also
lower in calories. That’s great news for dieters who want to include a variety
of meat products in their diets. The recipes in this section make delicious use
of lean loin pork chops, today’s lower-fat ham, and Canadian-style bacon,
which is a precooked, lowfat ham product that’s packaged in individual slices
just perfect for anyone who’s counting calories.
Cranberry Pork Chops
The flavor of pork marries well with almost any fruit. In this recipe, canned cranberry
sauce adds fruity flavor and sweetness to a savory sauce. Serve these tasty chops with
a cupful of steamed green beans or broccoli on the side.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
282
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 
11⁄2 teaspoons olive oil
4 boneless pork loin chops (3 ounces each)
1 cup diced onion
1⁄2 cup finely chopped carrot
1 cup chicken broth
1⁄3 cup whole-berry or jellied cranberry sauce
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar or red wine
vinegar
1 Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and
cook for 1 minute on each side. Remove the chops from the skillet and set aside on a
warm covered plate.
2 Add the onions and carrots to the skillet and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes or
until lightly browned and tender. Return the chops to the skillet and add the broth.
Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes, until the pork is cooked through-
out. (Cooking time depends on the thickness of the chops.) Remove the chops from the
skillet to a covered platter to keep warm.
3 Add the cranberry sauce and vinegar to the skillet. Cook over low heat, stirring, for 1 to
2 minutes or until the cranberry sauce is melted and heated through. Return the chops
to the skillet and cook just until the pork is heated throughout. Transfer the chops to
serving plates. Spoon any remaining sauce over the chops.

Risotto with Ham and Peas
Creamy, hearty risotto is a slow-cooked Italian rice dish that’s especially satisfying to
eat when you’re on a low-calorie diet. By gradually adding liquid to the rice and stirring
constantly as it cooks, you release a starch that creates a very creamy rice mixture. It’s
best to make risotto with Arborio rice, which you can find in the rice section of most
large supermarkets or specialty food shops. Serve with sliced tomatoes, drizzled with
just a teaspoon or two of light dressing.
Preparation time: 10 minutes

1 Heat the oil in a medium nonstick saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté
5 minutes. Add garlic and sauté 1 minute longer. Stir in rice.
2 Add 1⁄2 cup of the chicken broth and stir often for about 2 minutes or until the broth is
absorbed. Add all but 1⁄2 cup of the remaining broth, 1⁄2 cup at a time, stirring after each
addition until the liquid is absorbed.
3 Stir in the peas, ham, salt, pepper, and remaining 1⁄2 cup broth. Cook, stirring, for 5 to
8 minutes or until the rice is tender and somewhat creamy. Remove the rice from heat
and stir in Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.

Fishing for Seafood Dinners
Many fish recipes call for cod because it’s not only lean and low in calories,
but it’s also often readily available wherever seafood is sold. Flounder, sole,
and snapper are among the fish that are equally low in calories and fat.
Because of their mild flavor, you can substitute them in most recipes that call
for cod. Shellfish such as shrimp and crab are even lower in calories, but if
you’re watching your dietary cholesterol, you may want to limit the amount
of shrimp you include in your diet. Two of the following recipes use oven-
frying and steaming, two low-calorie cooking techniques that work particu-
larly well with seafood.

Cod Stew Provencal
Fennel seed is the “secret” ingredient that gives this soup such a special flavor. If fresh
fennel is available, you can use it as a substitute for the celery (see Figure 14-3 to find
out what fresh fennel looks like). You can also substitute tilapia if cod is unavailable. To
bring this dish up to 300 calories, serve with four saltine crackers or a small breadstick
on the side.

Trying a Variety of Vegetarian Dishes
In books and articles about health and weight control, I often see advice to
eat at least one vegetarian dinner a week. I agree with this advice and even
suggest that you work at least one vegetarian day into your diet every week,
because you can benefit from eating a vegetarian diet in many ways. For one
thing, it’s a good way to get more fresh vegetables, beans, and grains into

your diet, along with the vitamins, minerals, and fiber that come with them.
Another reason vegetarian meals are helpful on a low-cal diet is that they add
variety to a plan that limits the amount of food you can eat, which can help
prevent you from getting bored.

 Tasting sweet treats
W
hen you’re counting every calorie in an
attempt to lose weight, you may think
snacks and desserts are something you’ll never
see again in this lifetime. Not so! For most dieters,
sweet and salty treats are an important part of
losing weight and often serve as motivators when
you use your snack calories for favorite comfort
foods and other special treats. I, myself, live for
the moment when I know that I’ve eaten enough
healthy stuff to justify the (heaping) tablespoon or
two of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream I
plan into my diet most days.
You don’t need to torture yourself about forbidden foods because no foods
are forbidden on this diet. True, the foods you may think of as forbidden —
cookies, candies, chips, dips, and chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream —
are quite limited on a calorie-controlled weight-loss plan. They have to be.
But if you can control the amount you eat, then don’t feel guilty. This diet
doesn’t prohibit you from sampling these yummy treats.
The healthiest sweet stuff usually includes some type of fruit, and the healthi-
est savory snacks are usually made with some type of vegetable matter. If you
choose healthier treats most of the time to use for your snack calories, then,
as a registered dietitian, I can say without reservation, “Go right ahead and
enjoy the cookies, candies, crackers, chips, dips, and chocolate chip cookie
dough ice cream you eat (in moderation) from time to time.”
In this chapter, I provide some 100-calorie snack and dessert recipes that are
healthful, easy to prepare, and fun to eat. I also throw in a list of 50-calorie
snacks for those of you who want to break your 100-calorie snack allowance
into two extra mini-snacks.

Being Smart about Munching
between Meals
If you like to snack but think you have to sneak your snacks or, at the very
least, feel guilty about eating them, think again. A well-planned snack can
help because it
 Provides energy
 Keeps your blood sugar steady throughout the day
 Fills nutritional gaps in your diet
 Facilitates weight loss by preventing you from getting too hungry and
overeating at your next meal
For many low-calorie dieters, a snack eaten sometime between lunch and
dinner is the most important “meal” of the day because it staves off the
hunger and fatigue that often accompanies afternoon slump, which is the
energy gap that many people suffer toward the end of the workday. An after-
noon snack fills that gap and helps tide you over until dinner.
In the following sections, I give you a few tips and tricks for eating snacks and
desserts without wrecking your low-calorie plan.
Adding variety to snacks and desserts
To get the most out of your snack calories, think of snacks (and desserts, for
that matter) as mini-meals, and balance them the way you would balance a
small meal, with a little bit of protein, a little bit of carbohydrate, and maybe
a little fat. Balancing snacks and desserts serves the same purpose as balanc-
ing the rest of your diet. When you eat different types of foods together, your
body metabolizes them at different rates, which means a steadier and longer-
lasting supply of energy. Your snacks and desserts will do a better job of
tiding you over until your next meal.
For example, instead of eating 100 calories worth of saltine crackers (6 or 7
crackers), have three crackers, half an ounce of reduced-fat cheese, and a few
apple or orange slices. This type of snack can compensate for nutrients that
may be low or missing in your regular meals. In this example, you’re getting
calcium, protein, and a little fat from the cheese, different types of carbohy-
drates, vitamins, and minerals from the fruit and crackers, and sustained
energy from the combination of all three foods.
A sweeter way to balance a snack and add some fun is to treat yourself to
a chocolate drop or mini-chocolate bar, served with a couple of fresh 
294
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 

strawberries and a half cup of skim milk. This snack is loaded with vitamin C
and calcium, and provides other nutrients along with a chocolate bonus. Just
remember: Don’t get carried away. Only one piece of chocolate!
These two examples show how eating between meals can become a healthful,
guilt-free habit that doesn’t have to affect your weight, or your blood sugar, in
a negative way.
Grazing throughout the day
Research over the past few decades has shown that, for some people, graz-
ing, or eating small meals and snacks throughout the day instead of three
larger meals, can help with weight control and other health issues. More fre-
quent eating may help
 Lower your blood cholesterol
 Control your moods
 Keep your blood sugar steady
 Give you more control over your appetite
Grazing works for low-calorie dieters as long as you aren’t random. You still
need a low-cal plan (see Chapter 6 to start with a four-week plan), and you
need to stick to your calorie limit if you’re serious about losing weight. The
only difference between grazing and eating three square meals a day is that
you’re breaking the same number of calories up into smaller meals to be
eaten more often.
For many people, however, snacking or grazing is detrimental to their diet.
If you’re the type of person who isn’t satisfied with small portions of your
favorite foods or for whom a few bites of food easily leads to a binge, then
you probably need to avoid frequent snacking, at least for now. You may even
have to forego all snacks and desserts until you feel in better control of your
eating habits. If that’s the case, take your snack and dessert calories (and the
foods that provide those calories) and add them to your regular meals. For
instance, rather than having a baked apple at 3 p.m. to hold you over until
dinner, add it to your breakfast menu or have it with dinner, rather than later
in the evening.
All the low-cal snacks and desserts in the world can’t help you lose weight if
you overdo it. You have to be able to stop eating when you’ve used up your
calorie allotment. Your body plays a funny trick on you when you eat too
much, too often. If you start feeding yourself six or eight times a day, you’ll
start to feel hungry at those same times every day. That’s okay if you’re
simply dividing an appropriate number of daily calories into that many small
meals and snacks. But if you feed that hunger with excess food, then snacking
becomes just another bad habit that can lead to weight gain.

Sampling 100-Calorie Snacks
The following sections provide recipes and ideas for quick-to-fix snacks, both
savory and sweet. You can eat some of them in the here and now, while you
can make others ahead of time for your scheduled snack or if you need to
appease a snack attack that comes out of the blue. (Yes, it happens, and yes,
give in to it! Better to give in to a craving and allow yourself 100 extra calories
worth of satisfaction than to end up bingeing later in the day because you
denied yourself a small treat earlier.)
Treating yourself to sweet snacks
The sweet snacks in this section and the desserts later in this chapter are
certainly interchangeable. They all contain approximately 100 calories in a
single serving. The only difference is that the desserts are just slightly more
sophisticated, and perhaps more suitable for serving to company.
If your friends are like mine, they’ll welcome the make-it-yourself oozy cookie
snack made with marshmallow creme and chocolate syrup (Just a Little
S’More) in this section just as readily as the more elegant chilled dessert cup
of orange sections in sweet and spicy syrup (Oranges in Spicy Syrup) you can
find in the section “Making the most of fruit,” later in this chapter.
T Watermelon Freezies
This recipe isn’t unlike the semifrozen, slurpable drink snacks you may have enjoyed as
a kid at your local convenience store. This one is a little healthier, though, because it
contains real fruit, instead of just fruit-flavored sugar syrup, and it fits nicely into your
100-calorie snack slot.
Preparation time: 5 minutes plus freezing time
Yield: 4 servings
296
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 
4 cups cubed seedless watermelon, frozen
1⁄2 can (3 ounces) frozen limeade concentrate,
thawed and undiluted
1 tablespoon sugar
Pinch of dried mint (optional)
Combine the frozen watermelon cubes, limeade concentrate, sugar, and mint, if using, in
the container of a blender or food processor. Process with on/off motions until smooth.
Serve immediately.

Tip: Put any leftover mixture back in the freezer before it thaws and freeze for up to a
month. To serve at another time, take the mixture out of the freezer for 10 minutes before
reprocessing.

T Just a Little S’More
I include this recipe because dieters deserve to have as much fun as everyone else.
A take-off on the traditional campfire s’mores, this sweet treat weighs in under 100 
calories — if you can eat just one! The recipe is written to yield only one serving. I don’t
recommend it for anyone who can’t keep ingredients like marshmallow creme in the
house, for fear of eating the entire jarful during a midnight binge.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 cookie
297
Chapter 15: Fitting In Snacks and Desserts
1 tablespoon marshmallow creme
1⁄2 graham cracker (1 square), split into two
rectangles
1 teaspoon chocolate syrup
Spread the marshmallow creme onto one of the graham cracker rectangles. Drizzle the
creme with the chocolate syrup. Top with the remaining graham cracker rectangle. Enjoy!
Tip: Sometimes when I make one, I put it on a plate and pop it in the microwave oven for
5 seconds just to warm it slightly.

(Dietary Fiber 0g); Protein 1g.
Savoring salty snacks
If you have a salt tooth, rather than a sweet tooth, then you go more for
chips, pretzels, and other savory foods when the urge to snack strikes. The
recipes in this section are all designed to allow you to eat not just one, but
several, and still stick to your 100-calorie snack limit.

T Garlicky Herb 
Pita Chips
You can’t eat just one, but you don’t have to, because they’re less than 20 calories
apiece. Feel free to eat five or six for a full snack.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 15 minutes
Yield: 64 chips
298
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 
8 small (6 inch) pita breads
2 egg whites
1⁄4 cup olive oil
2 large cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried rosemary, basil, oregano, or
Italian seasoning mix, finely crushed
1⁄2 teaspoon salt
1 Preheat the oven to 300.
2 Split each pita bread so that you have 16 rounds. Place the rounds, rough side up, on
your work surface.
3 Stir together the egg whites, olive oil, garlic, basil, and salt in a small bowl. Brush some
of this egg-white mixture over the rough side of each pita round. With a pizza cutter or a
knife, cut each pita in 4 equal wedges. Gently cut or pry each wedge apart. You’ll have
64 wedges. Place the wedges, coated side up, on baking sheets.
4 Bake the chips, in batches if necessary, for 15 to 20 minutes or until the edges are
toasted and the egg-white topping is set. Remove the baking sheets to wire racks. Allow
the chips to cool completely before serving.

T Salad Scoops
My friend Laurie Mozian, who is also a registered dietitian, shared the basis of this
recipe with me years ago. Her version called for spooning the finely chopped vegetable
mixture onto rye-crisp crackers or melba toast. You can do that, if you like (keeping it
to two or three crackers). But personally, the way I write it is a great way to sneak a few
potato chips into your diet.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 ripe tomato, halved, seeded, and very finely
diced
1 small cucumber or 1⁄2 seedless cucumber,
peeled, halved lengthwise, seeded and very
finely diced
1 tablespoon very finely chopped green onion
2 tablespoons light creamy salad dressing
such as blue cheese, creamy Italian, creamy
Caesar, or ranch
24 baked potato chips or potato crisps
1 Combine the tomato, cucumber, green onion, and dressing in a small bowl.
2 Spoon a generous tablespoonful of the salad onto each potato chip just before eating.
Per serving: Calories 86 (From Fat 18); Fat 2g (Saturated 0g); Cholesterol 0mg; Sodium 160mg; Carbohydrate 16g
(Dietary Fiber 2g); Protein 2g.
You can serve any of the snacks in this section as party food. If you’re invited
to someone else’s party and you’re worried about what you’ll eat when you
get there, you can offer to bring a tray of low-cal snacks and then position
yourself close to that tray so that you’re not tempted to reach for any of the
higher-calorie foods provided by your host.

T Bean and Cheese Nachos
To serve these nachos at a party, simply double, triple, or quadruple the recipe. Even
nondieters scarf them up!
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 8 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
300
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 
2 flour tortillas (8 inches in diameter)
1⁄4 cup fat-free refried beans
1⁄4 cup fat-free salsa
1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro
(optional)
2 ounces shredded reduced-fat cheddar
cheese
1 Preheat the oven to 450.
2 Spread the tortillas evenly with the beans. Top with salsa. Sprinkle with cilantro, if
desired, then the shredded cheese.
3 Bake the nachos for 8 minutes or until the tortillas are crisp and lightly browned around
the edges and the cheese has melted.
4 Use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut each tortilla into eight nachos.

T Yogurt-Cheese Dip 
with Spinach and Dill
This recipe makes about 16 servings if you’re planning to use it for a party. For an
everyday 100-calorie snack, or as party fare, have 3 tablespoons of dip with a cup of
assorted raw vegetable dippers.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 3 cups
1 package (10 ounces) frozen chopped
spinach, thawed and well drained
2 ounces crumbled goat cheese or feta cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill or
2 teaspoons dried dill
1 clove garlic
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1⁄8 teaspoon each salt and pepper
2 cups plain lowfat yogurt, divided

1 Combine the spinach, cheese, dill, garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a food proces-
sor. Whirl for 30 seconds, just to combine, scraping down the side of the container with
a spatula, as necessary.
2 Add 1⁄2 cup of the yogurt to the food processor. Whirl until almost smooth. Stir in the
remaining yogurt until well mixed. (Don’t process the remaining yogurt, or the mixture
will be too thin.)
3 Turn the dip into a serving bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Per serving: Calories 37 (From Fat 14); Fat 2g (Saturated 1g); Cholesterol 5mg; Sodium 70mg; Carbohydrate 3g
(Dietary Fiber 0g); Protein 3g.
50 snacks worth 50 calories
With 50-calorie snacks, you get to snack more often. You can always double
the quantity on any of these snacks to get your full 100 at once, but dividing
snacks up into 50-calorie portions can help you bank calories for later on in
the day, when you may start feeling desperate for a bite to eat.

Dishing Up 100-Calorie Desserts
Dessert eaters will probably want to use their snack calories for an after-
dinner sweet. Believing you can find a satisfying dessert for 100 calories or
less may sound impossible, but I include six recipes in the following sections.
Making the most of fruit
Nutritionists recommend fresh fruit as the dessert of choice, because it’s
sweet, easy, packed with nutrients, and comparatively low in calories. What
could be bad? Nothing, but if you’ve ever been on a restricted diet, you know
that eating the same foods, the same way, over and over again, no matter
how delicious they are, can get boring. And boring spells nothing but trouble
for dieters! The following are several recipes that feature fresh fruit in fun and
tasty ways.

 1 fig bar cookie
 1 peach
 1 plum
 1 flavored rice cake
 1 mini sesame breadstick
 1 mini box (1⁄2 ounce) raisins
 1 cup puffed cereal
 1 cup raw baby carrots
 1 cup sweet red pepper strips
 1 cup tomato juice

 1 ounce lowfat deli meat
 1⁄2 apple
 1⁄2 grapefruit sprinkled with
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar or other
sweetener, if you like

1⁄2 small banana

1⁄2 slice light bread toast with 
2 teaspoons fruit spread

1⁄3 cup unsweetened applesauce

1⁄4 avocado

T Cannoli Creme Topping
If you’ve ever had an Italian cannoli pastry, you can appreciate the flavor of this creamy,
sweetened ricotta cheese mixture. This recipe uses it as a topping for fresh fruit that’s
especially good with a 1⁄2 cup of sliced strawberries or a mixture of strawberries, blue-
berries, and raspberries.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 8 servings (2 generous tablespoons per serving)
303
Chapter 15: Fitting In Snacks and Desserts
1 cup light ricotta cheese
2 tablespoons superfine sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 tablespoons chocolate chips, chopped, or
1⁄2 ounce semisweet chocolate, grated
1 teaspoon grated orange rind (optional)
Combine the cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a blender or food processor. Whirl for a minute
or until very smooth, scraping down the side of the container as necessary. Stir in the
chocolate chips and orange rind, if using. Refrigerate the topping for up to a week.

The following recipe features refreshing oranges cut into sections. To cut
orange sections, use a small, sharp knife to remove the rind from the orange
in a circular fashion, running the knife under the rind and around the fruit
(see Figure 15-1). Be sure to cut through the membrane that holds the sec-
tions intact. After you have removed the rind, cut down alongside the mem-
brane on both sides of each section to release the sections.

T Oranges in Spicy Syrup
This recipe makes four servings as a stand-alone 100-calorie dessert, but you can also
use less of this mixture as a topping for a small scoop of light vanilla ice cream or frozen
yogurt.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 7 minutes plus 15 minutes standing time
Yield: 4 servings
304
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 
1⁄4 cup sugar
1⁄4 cup water
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1⁄8 teaspoon ground cloves or allspice
2 cups orange sections (about 4 oranges)
1 Combine the sugar, water, lemon juice, and cloves in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil
over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2 minutes.
2 Add the orange sections to the saucepan. Simmer gently for 5 minutes. Pour the oranges
and syrup into a bowl and let the mixture stand for at least 15 minutes or cover and
refrigerate overnight.
Vary It! You can also try this recipe with grapefruit.

Most low-cal fruit desserts and snacks (including the following recipe for a
Raspberry Baked Apple) double as healthful breakfast foods because they’re
not high in added sugars.

T Raspberry Baked Apple
You can bake this apple the traditional way — in the regular oven — but it will take
longer. Substitute any flavor fruit spread you like, and if you’re having a light-eating day,
and can spare another 25 calories, mix the fruit spread with a tablespoon of fat-free 
granola or other plain, nugget-shaped cereal or a teaspoon of finely chopped nuts
before filling the apple.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 3 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
305
Chapter 15: Fitting In Snacks and Desserts
1 medium apple, such as Winesap, Stayman,
Fuji, or Gala
1 tablespoon natural or low-sugar seedless
raspberry fruit spread
1 Peel the apple halfway down from the top. Cut out the core almost to the bottom, leav-
ing a 1-inch opening at the top (see Figure 15-2). Place the apple in a microwave-safe
dish. Add 2 tablespoons water to the dish.
2 Cook the apple in the microwave for 3 minutes or until tender. (If you don’t have a rotat-
ing tray in the oven, turn the apple once halfway through cooking time for more even
cooking.)
3 Spoon the fruit spread into the opening in the top of the apple. Microwave for 30 sec-
onds or until the filling is bubbly.
Tip: The best way to eat a baked apple is to halve it first, allow the filling to flow out, and
then cut the apple into bite-size pieces.

T Chocolate-Frosted Frozen Banana
This recipe is a great low-cal treat to keep on hand in the freezer for when only some-
thing chocolate will satisfy your sweet tooth! (You can find additional chocolate recipes
in the next section.) You can use the chocolate to coat strawberries and other fruits
too, if you like. That way, you still get a taste of chocolate while having a healthy serv-
ing of fruit.
Preparation time: 2 minutes plus freezing time
Yield: 4 servings
306
Part IV: Trying Time-Tested Low-Calorie Recipes 
1 large, firm, ripe banana
1 square (1 ounce) semisweet chocolate
1 teaspoon skim milk
1 Cut the banana in half lengthwise, and then cut each long half in half crosswise to make
four equal pieces. Place the banana pieces on a plate and freeze for an hour or two or
until just solid.
2 Combine the chocolate square and milk in a ramekin or small cup. Microwave for 45
seconds. Remove the ramekin from the microwave and stir the chocolate mixture with a
spoon until it is smooth and spreadable. Spoon or brush the chocolate along the length
of the frozen banana pieces. Return the bananas to the freezer for 1 hour or until the
chocolate frosting is frozen solid.
3 Wrap each banana separately in freezer paper and keep frozen until ready to eat. To
serve, remove the banana pieces from the freezer 15 minutes before serving. Place them
on dessert plates and carefully cut them into thin slices. Serve the bananas semifrozen.
Tip: If you can’t wait for the banana to freeze, simply take your share, cut it into thin slices,
and spread it with a little of the chocolate frosting while it’s still warm.

3⁄4 cup superfine sugar
2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa
6 egg whites, at room temperature
1⁄4 teaspoon cream of tartar
pinch of salt
11⁄2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 Preheat the oven to 250 degrees. Line a couple of baking sheets with parchment paper
or nonstick aluminum foil.
2 In a small bowl, stir together the sugar and cocoa. Set aside.
3 In a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed, beat the egg whites until foamy.
Beat in the cream of tartar, salt, and vanilla. Add the cocoa and sugar mixture, 1 table-
spoon at a time, beating until blended after each addition, until the egg whites are stiff
and glossy (see Figure 15-3 to find out what stiff peaks look like). Drop the batter by
measuring tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets.
4 Bake the meringues for 90 minutes. Turn off the oven, open the door slightly, and allow
the cookies to cool completely in the oven. (This step takes several hours.) Remove the
cookies from the baking sheets with a spatula. Store the meringues in a tightly covered
container for up to a few days.
Vary It! These cookies are even more fabulous if you substitute an equal amount of choco-
late extract for the vanilla. If you can’t find chocolate extract in your supermarket, check in
specialty food shops and baking supply stores.

When you need a quick chocolate fix, remember that chocolate syrup has
only 13 to 20 calories in a teaspoon. (The calorie range is due to variations
among brands. Check the labels on different brands in your supermarket if
you want to find the one with the fewest calories.) You can satisfy your need
with a drizzle of syrup on fresh strawberries or a couple of banana slices or
even a small wedge of angel food cake. Just be aware of how much syrup
you’re pouring, however, because by the time you’re up to 2 tablespoons,
you’ve topped 100 calories, just from the syrup alone.
T Chocolate Bread Pudding
This recipe uses classic calorie-cutting techniques such as using skim milk instead of
whole milk and light bread in place of regular bread, and replacing some egg yolks with
egg whites to lighten up a traditional dessert.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 35 minutes

Nonstick cooking spray
4 slices light oatmeal bread
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
1 egg yolk
1⁄2 cup skim milk
3 egg whites
1 Preheat the oven to 325.
2 Coat a 1-quart baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Cut the bread slices into small
cubes. Place the cubes in the baking dish.
3 In a large bowl, stir together the sugar and cocoa powder until well mixed. Stir in the
egg yolk and milk until blended.

4 In a medium bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed, beat the egg whites
until stiff peaks form. Carefully fold the whites into the cocoa mixture until almost
blended. Be careful not to overmix or you may deflate the beaten whites. Pour this mix-
ture over the bread cubes.
5 Place the baking dish in a larger baking pan. Carefully add enough boiling water to the
larger pan to come 1 inch up the side of the baking dish.
6 Bake the bread pudding for 35 minutes or until golden brown and set. Serve warm.

Chapter 16
Ten Benefits of Following 
a Low-Calorie Diet
In This Chapter
 Reaping the physical rewards of a low-calorie lifestyle
 Staying healthier and extending your life
T
he big payback for following a low-calorie diet and losing weight comes
from the many ways you’ll improve your health and your overall quality
of life as you lose weight. These benefits, which I cover in this chapter, can
help reduce your risk of developing medical problems now and in the future,
and you may even live longer simply because you’ve chosen to live better.
Looking Good, Feeling Great
I sometimes grow impatient when I read advice suggesting that overweight
people need to be comfortable with themselves at any size. I agree with the
advice, but it’s often militant, not always realistic, and sometimes gives the
wrong message. Yes, you must love and care about yourself. Yes, you’re a
worthwhile person at any size. But if you’re not physically and mentally com-
fortable being overweight, then it doesn’t make sense to stay that way. Losing
weight may not solve all your problems, but most people I know who have
lost weight in the past say they feel better about themselves when they’re
thinner. Hundreds of people I’ve spoken with say they want to lose weight to
look better and improve the quality of their lifestyles as well as their health.
Very few say it’s for the sake of their health alone.
You can be “fat and fit,” especially if you get plenty of exercise. However, if
you’re still extremely unhappy when you look in the mirror, then you’re car-
rying around a lot of psychological weight in addition to extra body weight.
Wanting to look good is never a negative unless you have unrealistic ideas
about how much you want to weigh or what your life is going to be like after
you lose weight. If your weight-loss goals are unrealistic, the result could be a
painful, lifelong struggle. But if all you want is to get to a comfortable weight

so you can feel better about yourself, then make it your goal. (Chapter 4 has
more info on setting realistic goals.)
Looking good is a legitimate benefit of weight loss when it comes to improved
self-esteem and a positive body image. A trickle-down effect is working here:
When you feel good about yourself, you’re more likely to take care of your
health because you know you’re worth it. How do I know this? Well, not many
scientific studies have been conducted on the power of positive thinking, but
experts do know that poor body image is associated with low self-esteem and
low self-esteem is associated with unhealthy behaviors such as abusing alco-
hol and drugs, avoiding professional help, and overeating.
Boosting Your Energy
The more extra weight you carry on your body, the more energy you use up
performing even the simplest tasks. If, for instance, you’re 40 pounds out of
your healthy weight range, you may as well be wearing a 40-pound backpack.
If you can identify with this example, you know that everyday activities, such
as walking down the street or doing housework, could be much easier if you
took off that backpack.
Although many people assume that energy levels naturally decline as you
age, fitness studies have shown that the better you control your body fat,
build up your endurance, and develop muscle over the years, the less of a
decline you’ll see. That’s why, even though the mere thought of more exer-
cise might exhaust you, getting active can give you more energy in the long
run. I give you the full scoop on working out and getting active in Chapter 8.
Sleeping Better
According to the American Sleep Apnea Association, more than 12 million
Americans suffer from sleep apnea, a condition that causes people to repeat-
edly stop breathing for up to a full minute while they sleep. Being overweight
is a risk factor for developing sleep apnea and even though the condition is
more commonly found in men older than 40, it can affect anyone. (If you want
to know all you need to know about sleep apnea and other potential sleeping
problems, check out Sleep Disorders For Dummies by Max Hirshkowitz, MD,
and Patricia Smith [Wiley].)
If you have apnea, your brain wakes you up with each episode to resume
breathing, but your sleep quality suffers as a result of these constant awaken-
ings. You may not even know that you have sleep apnea, but you (or your
sleeping partner) may recognize some of the symptoms, such as loud snoring
and constantly feeling tired throughout the day. Sleep apnea can also cause
314
Part V: The Part of Tens 

other medical conditions such as high blood pressure (see “Lowering Your
Blood Pressure,” later in this chapter), headaches, and impotency.
Saving Your Back
Losing weight can help reduce the load on your lower back and extremities,
which in turn can help reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis and possibly
even prevent joint problems. Medical experts also say that being overweight
is a cause of osteoarthritis in the hips, knees, and lower back because the
extra pressure from excess weight wears away the cartilage that would nor-
mally protect these areas. Excess weight in your abdomen puts extra stress
on your back muscles. The healthiest solution is to lose weight and work with
a physical therapist, or a trainer who is familiar with joint and back prob-
lems, to strengthen your abdominal muscles.
Lowering Your Blood Pressure
Blood pressure is the force at which your heart beats to drive blood to your
arteries and through your circulatory system. Your blood pressure rises as
your heart beats and falls when your heart rests between beats, and that’s
what’s being measured when you get a blood pressure reading. When your
pressure reads above the normal range, you have high blood pressure.
Often described as “the silent killer,” high blood pressure can cause heart dis-
ease, stroke, and kidney failure — all killer diseases. The silent part comes
from the fact that you can develop high blood pressure without experiencing
any symptoms. So you may have it and not even know it until it leads to a
more critical health problem.
As your weight increases, so does your blood pressure. If you’re overweight,
just losing a few pounds by eating less and moving more can help prevent
high blood pressure. If you already have high blood pressure, losing weight
can help bring it back into a normal range.
If you’re overweight, the way to help prevent and lower high blood pressure
is to eat less, exercise more, and lose weight. If you’re overweight and take
blood pressure–lowering medication, you may be able to reduce your dose or
even eliminate the need for medication by losing excess weight.

Chapter 16: Ten Benefits of Following a Low-Calorie Diet

Maintaining a Healthy Heart
Reducing your weight by a mere 10 percent can lower your risk of developing
heart disease. Many factors play into the development of heart disease, includ-
ing high cholesterol that may be related to your diet, physical inactivity, and
being overweight. You can control these factors by eating fewer calories, eating
healthier foods, and exercising more. Losing weight can help lower your LDL
cholesterol, which is the form of cholesterol responsible for clogged arteries,
and raise your HDL cholesterol, which is the form of cholesterol that is benefi-
cial to your heart because it carries excess dietary fat out of your body. (If you
want more information about cholesterol, look for Controlling Cholesterol For
Dummies by Carol Ann Rinzler and Martin W. Graf, MD [Wiley].)
Even with normal cholesterol levels, you may be at risk of developing heart
disease if you’re one of 55 million people with metabolic syndrome, also known
as Syndrome X. This syndrome isn’t a disease in and of itself, but rather a col-
lection of risk factors. If you have at least three of the following risk factors,
you may be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome:
 High blood pressure
 High blood glucose (sugar) levels
 High blood triglyceride (fat) levels
 Low blood levels of protective HDL cholesterol
 Insulin resistance
 A waist circumference greater than 35 inches in women, 40 in men
The best known treatment for slowing down or reversing the risk factors of
metabolic syndrome is to lose weight. Research has shown that a diet provid-
ing between 1,100 and 1,950 calories a day can reduce cholesterol levels,
blood pressure, and the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes.
Preventing Diabetes
Overweight people are twice as likely to develop non-insulin dependent dia-
betes than people who are at a healthy weight. Another scary fact: About
one-fourth of overweight adults older than 45 are prediabetic, a term given to
the condition people develop before they get diabetes. Among those people
who are prediabetic, almost 95 percent have high cholesterol and more than
316
Part V: The Part of Tens 

half have high blood pressure. Scariest fact of all: Approximately 6.5 million
people are walking around with undiagnosed diabetes so they’re not even
included in the statistics. If you’re one of them, you’re at high risk of develop-
ing chronic conditions related to diabetes, such as heart disease and kidney
disease.
Cutting calories, balancing your meals, and increasing the amount of exercise
you do on a regular basis can reduce your risk of developing diabetes. If you
already have diabetes and you’re overweight, losing weight can help control
your blood sugar levels and decrease your need for medication. Ask your
physician if eating less and exercising more can help you.
If you want more information about diabetes, check out Diabetes For
Dummies, 2nd edition, by Alan L. Rubin, MD (Wiley).
Fighting Cancer
In a study of more than 900,000 adults published in the New England Journal
of Medicine, being overweight was associated with higher rates of death due
to cancer of the esophagus, colon, rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and
kidney, and also higher death rates from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple
myeloma, in both men and women. Heavier men were more likely to die from
stomach and prostate cancers; heavier women were more likely to die from
cancers of the breast, uterus, cervix, and ovary. From this study, researchers
concluded that 14 percent of all deaths from cancer in women and 20 percent
of all deaths in men were linked to being overweight and obesity.
Cancer experts list weight loss among their suggestions for preventing cancer
because they believe that being overweight and inactive produces changes in
the body that encourage cancer cells to thrive and grow. But cancerous condi-
tions also develop in people who aren’t overweight, so medical experts don’t
know if that higher risk is actually due to excess weight or if it’s due to eating
a high-calorie or high-fat diet.
Some evidence also suggests that if you’re overweight, you may get less effec-
tive treatment for cancer. Preliminary studies have indicated that heavier
women may need more chemotherapy to treat breast cancer than thinner
women, but they may not get it because doctors are afraid of administering
higher, more toxic levels of the drugs. The side effects of chemotherapy
drugs can include damage to the heart and other organs, and the growth of
cancer at other sites, so doctors may undertreat their heavier patients.

Simplifying Pregnancy
Being overweight during pregnancy can pose serious problems for both you
and your baby. Some studies show that labor takes longer for overweight and
obese women. The longer the labor, the increased chance the baby will have
to be delivered by Caesarean section.
Overweight pregnant women are at higher risk of developing medical compli-
cations, such as high blood pressure, preeclampsia (any of several medical
conditions associated with high blood pressure during pregnancy), and ges-
tational diabetes. These conditions usually clear up after delivery, but after
they occur, they’re more likely to develop again later in life. If you require
surgery during pregnancy or delivery, your risk of complications increases
with increased weight.
Some studies have also shown that women who are obese when they become
pregnant have a higher risk of delivering an infant who is stillborn or dies
shortly after birth. Women who are simply overweight, however, appear to
have the same risk as those of normal weight. (For definitions of “overweight”
and “obese,” flip to Chapter 2.)
Check out Chapter 10 for more info about pregnancy and weight loss.
Living Longer
Scientific evidence has shown that the maximum lifespan for humans is about
125 years, although few people actually hang around that long. But in the
hope of living to their ripest old age, a small but devoted group of people
who belong to the Calorie Restriction Society are trying to prove that eating
less can help you live longer. Science hasn’t been able to prove it in humans
yet, but animal studies seem to support the theory that fewer calories can
mean a longer life, at least for mice, monkeys, and fruit flies.
Calorie restriction for the purpose of living longer isn’t the same as following
a low-calorie diet to lose weight, and the concept is too new for most health
professions to condone it. My advice to anyone who hopes to live longer by
restricting calories is to follow a nutritionally balanced, reduced-calorie diet
plan just like the one in this book. If cutting calories turns out to add years to
your life, those years will be more enjoyable if you’ve remained healthy by
supplying your body with all the nutrients it needs.

Finally Fitting into My Genes
My unique relationship with food started at a young age. In my family, food
was the center of all celebrations, the healing of all wounds, and, before I
knew it, one of my best friends. My family was nothing but loving to me, but
they never realized that their own food habits might have a negative effect on
me in the long run. A good grade got me an ice cream cone; a bad grade got
me the same. My mother would bring me bags of potato chips to eat in bed
and then at other times scold me for eating snacks that were “meant for my
brother.” I was confused. Unfortunately, she was too. She could see bad food
patterns developing, but she didn’t know what to do because she and my
father were both struggling with their own weight problems.
I was always a social kid and had a large circle of friends and endless activi-
ties to keep me busy. But even then, nothing satisfied me the way food did. It
was around the time I turned 8 that I can remember the horror of being called
“fatty” or “big butt.” I would go home in tears, only to be comforted by cook-
ies. Eating sweets made me feel better. I didn’t know any other way.
One vivid memory from adolescence is that of not being able to pull my
cheerleading skirt up over my thighs. My mother had one custom-made for
me, but the other girls just pointed out that mine was different. I went home
in tears. At this point, my mother saw what my weight was doing to me and
because she’d struggled with it her entire life, attempted to help me in the

only way she knew how, by introducing me to fad diets. We ate grapefruits
three times a day. We cut out carbohydrates. We took pills that did unthink-
able things to our bowels. We joined a weight-loss program and celebrated
the move by going out for ice cream sundaes! None of it taught me anything
about my behaviors or how I let my emotions dictate what I would eat.
By the time I got to college, my weight had ballooned to 225 pounds.
Although people always tried to tell me I “carried my weight well,” 5-feet-7
isn’t tall enough to carry 225 pounds. I had let myself go, I knew it, and that’s
when I became completely introverted. I went to class, went home, and slept
as much as I could. I refused to face the outside world. Around the same time,
my mother made the decision to undergo gastric bypass surgery. Not only
was the surgery a success in helping her lose more than 100 pounds, but it
also somehow changed her psychological approach to food. My one-time
food buddy had turned into a normal eater! I didn’t quite know how to handle
it. I felt very alone and that’s when I hit rock bottom. I knew that if I didn’t put
a stop to my overeating, it would be the end of me in more ways than one.
As a result, I joined a weight-loss program. It wasn’t the first time I’d joined,
but I made a promise to myself it would be the last. It took a lot of patience
and it was never easy. It took two years for 60 pounds to come off. Along the
way there have been bumps in the road and setbacks I hadn’t anticipated. I
went off the program at times. Some weeks I skipped meetings. But I never
quit. I knew I couldn’t turn back. I would never again go back to being the
miserable person I was at 225 pounds.
These days, I don’t restrict what I eat. If I want a candy bar, I have one. I may
choose a smaller one, or one with fewer calories or less fat, but I won’t tell
myself “I can’t have this” because that type of deprivation only leads to trou-
ble. I’m still working to take off another 30 pounds, which will get me to my
weight goal, but I’ve decided not to set a date for that goal. I take my food
plan one day at a time, and when I have extra stress in my life, I take it one
meal at a time. I draw on all the support I can, including friends, program
meetings, published literature, and online research.
At this point, I accept that focusing on weight control will always be part of
my life. I know at times I may put on a few pounds, even while I’m still trying
to lose. I know I’ll work them off because I’m determined never to go back to
the person I was before. I just won’t let it happen. Being that person wasn’t
much fun, so I’m determined to stick to the happier “new” me. — Amanda K.
Eating Small Portions All the Time
I never gained the infamous “freshman 15” when I first went to college. It was
my junior year that did me in. French was one of my majors, so I decided to
take an opportunity to live in France for six months that year. I weighed
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

about 125 pounds before I left, and thanks to a diet that included a few too
many freshly baked baguettes and pain au chocolat, came back tipping the
scales at 145. Within a few months, I got my weight back down to 125 just by
eating less food.
A couple of years later, as a graduation present to myself, I went back to
France for another extended stay. I brought those same 20 extra pounds back
home to the States with me six months later. Again, I simply started watching
how much I ate. I wasn’t going to deprive myself of the types of foods I’d
come to love, so I simply ate less of them. I lost the weight again and have
kept it off for 20 years.
I use the same strategy to maintain weight as I did to lose it. Either I share a
high-calorie dish or yummy dessert, or I simply take two or three bites and
leave the rest. I don’t see it as a loss of money; I see it as a loss of excess calo-
ries. I’m spending the same amount of money, regardless of how much I eat.
— Lori T.
Consuming Fewer Calories and
Adding More Workouts
For the past 25 years, I’ve been battling the weight war, always struggling
with an extra 10 or 15 pounds. I have tried almost every diet available and
purchased every diet “solution” advertised — pills, lotions, teas, fad foods,
you name it — in hope of shedding those unwanted pounds. I even tried
giving up all forms of chocolate (my favorite food group), but that was an
unacceptable and, in the end, unsuccessful strategy. It wasn’t until recently
that I discovered the only thing that really works and of course it’s something
I’ve known deep down for a long time.
After all these years of reading health magazines and newspaper articles
about the importance of exercise and good nutrition, it finally sunk in. If you
want to lose weight the right and safe way, the only way is by becoming aware
of how many calories you consume and, if necessary, cutting back and/or
burning off any excess with a good workout. With the help of an article I found
in a fitness magazine, I calculated the number of calories I needed to consume
each day to maintain my weight. From there I figured out how many calories I
should consume to shed a few pounds. I started counting calories every day,
factored in how many calories I worked off at the gym, and lost weight.
I still count calories, and if I overindulge one day, I take those calories away
from another day during the week. I weigh myself only once a week. Most
importantly, I no longer worry or feel guilty when I eat more than I should
because I know the formula for getting myself back on track. — Stacey J.

Chapter 17: Ten Low-Calorie Success Stories

Knowing What Works and 
Making Time for It
I think I overeat for three reasons: I love food, I’m an anxious person and
eating calms me down, and if I don’t set a goal or have a strong reason for
losing weight, I find it hard to restrain myself. Over the past 30 years, I’ve lost
and regained the same 20 to 40 pounds, and then some. At 6-foot-1, I would
be pretty happy if I could maintain my weight around 200 pounds, as long as
a lot of that was muscle.
About 15 years ago, just before my wedding, I decided it was time to lose
weight again. I went from 251 pounds to 187 pounds in eight months, with the
help of a commercial weight-loss program and a rigorous exercise routine.
About five years ago, I was back up to 245 pounds, so I rejoined the program,
added weight training to my exercise routine, and was down to 210 six
months later.
The combination of regular workouts and a structured diet plan works for me
every time I stick to them, and stops working when I slack off. These days,
I’m back up to 230 pounds, but I finally see the pattern and I know what I
have to do. I’m getting back into it and I trust that I’ll lose the weight again,
but the going is slow because I now have an infant son who needs my atten-
tion and takes up all of my spare time. I know that women often have a hard
time losing their baby weight, but I’m here to tell you that men gain baby
weight too, and have just as much trouble finding the time to work it off!
— Peter S.
Making Four the Magic Number
I don’t have a lifetime history of dieting or trying to lose weight; I’ve been at a
healthy weight most of my life. But about ten years ago, I started gaining for
no apparent reason. I wasn’t doing anything different. I wasn’t eating any
more than usual or exercising any less. But before I knew it, I was carrying
140 pounds on my 5-foot-2-inch frame and feeling very uncomfortable. Even
though I only had 10 pounds to lose, and I lost it within a few weeks by cut-
ting back on the amount of calories I consumed, I had trouble keeping it off.
My biggest problem was (and still is) trying to resist the treats and sweets
my coworkers bring into the office on a regular basis. At my job, there always
seems to be some reason to stop working and have a celebration.
Now I never let my weight creep up by more than 4 pounds. If I let it get that
far, I start getting strict again with my diet. I eat half a sandwich for lunch
rather than a whole one and I eat plenty of big salads with just a teaspoon of
olive oil for dressing. I eat fruit at least three times a day. I also make sure I
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

eat something every two and a half hours so I don’t get hungry, even if it’s
just a cucumber. For lunch, I bring calorie-controlled packaged entrees to the
office and heat them up in the microwave oven. And I leave room in my calo-
rie budget for office parties!
As long as I don’t let it go any further than 4 pounds, and I stick to a strict
plan, I can lose those 4 pounds within a week or two. The secret is to never
let it get out of hand. — Sophie M.
Eating Smart While Eating Out and
Cruising to a Lower Weight
As a food writer and restaurant reviewer with a weekly newspaper column,
I eat lunch and dinner out at least several times a week. To be fair to the
restaurant I’m reviewing, I have to go back two or three times to try a good
sampling of menu offerings. In addition to the food I eat at restaurants, I
attend press events introducing new food products, go on local and interna-
tional trips sponsored by food associations, and encounter packages of food
that routinely arrive on my desk from companies that want me to review their
products. A dream job, right? Yes, in many ways, that’s true, but it does have
its dark side.
I knew when I took this job that I was committing dietary suicide. But I love
food and couldn’t resist the opportunity. I told myself I would just do it for
a year. Six years later, I was 40 pounds heavier, up from a perfect size 8 to a
tight size 14, always feeling bloated and miserable, and still writing restaurant
reviews. I knew I had to do something, but losing weight isn’t easy when you
eat for a living. Sure, I could cut back on snacking and eat a little less when
I went out, but I knew my only real hope was to start exercising as well.
What actually got me to the gym was an invitation to go on a Mediterranean
cruise. You know the joke about cruises: You board as a passenger and dis-
embark as cargo. I knew that if I was going to be sailing and eating for almost
two weeks, and starting off at a 40-pound disadvantage, I had to take some
preventive measures. Over the course of several weeks, by exercising regu-
larly, canceling my daily midafternoon vending machine visits, foregoing the
breadbasket when I went out to eat, and taking “sampling bites” of the food I
was reviewing, I managed to lose 12 pounds.
The best part of the story, though, was that I went on that cruise and came
home another 8 pounds lighter! When you’re hiking steep walkways on a vol-
canic island, visiting ruins that you can only see by foot, and climbing end-
less steps to get to a medieval mountaintop town, you don’t need an elliptical
trainer. Even though, at the end of the day, all roads led back to a cruise ship
that offered 1,001 ways to sabotage my diet, I was able to enjoy it because I
had done my exercise, and then some. — Cindy K.

Having a Baby, Losing the Weight
By the end of my pregnancy, I had gained nearly 60 pounds. I started at around
130 and ended up close to 190. The baby was two and a half weeks overdue
and I was retaining fluid, so with the birth I instantly lost 35 of those pounds.
With breastfeeding and a hectic work schedule, I lost another 5 pounds without
trying. The remaining 20 stayed right where they were for the next five years.
The first step I took was to add some exercise to my daily routine. I never had
a good time to go to a gym, so I started walking, instead of riding, as often as
I could. Eventually I added a yoga class every week, and then two or three a
week. I started feeling fitter and more flexible, but still had only lost a few of
those 20 pounds.
Even though I was very conscientious about my daughter’s nutrition, I was
just too busy, and too often too tired to prepare healthful meals for myself. I
would fill up on high-calorie snacks throughout the day and sweet stuff late at
night. I finally joined a weight-loss program, which forced me to look at what I
was eating, how much, and when.
The program made me aware of portion control and now I’m less likely to
overeat. I never feel deprived because now that I’m paying attention to what I
eat, I always seem to have room for a glass of wine or a piece of chocolate at
the end of the day. I eat better overall because I’ve become fussier about the
quality of the food I eat. I don’t want to waste any calories!
One of the most effective tools the program uses is a weekly weigh-in.
Sometimes it reminds me that calories from those cookies I sneak in at mid-
night when I’m not even hungry start to add up. At other times it’s a comfort
to know that I’m progressing toward my goal. It has taken me more than a
year to lose 15 pounds, and I still have 2 pounds to go to reach my goal
weight. It’s a slow process but I’m confident that by taking this route, I’ll be
able to keep those extra pounds off for good. — Juliette K.
Counting Calories as the Years Go By
For years, decades even, I ate whatever I wanted and never gained weight.
Even in my late thirties, I was still able to eat large volumes of food — pretty
much whatever and whenever I wanted. If I gained a few pounds, I just had to
watch it for a week or two and my weight would go back down.
That all seemed to change overnight. I hit my forties and I started feeling
thick and heavy. One day I was trying on clothes in a department store that
has those 3-way mirrors that show you what you look like from behind. Need
I say more? It had been years since I’d seen my backside, and let me tell you,
it was a horrifying sight. All I saw when I looked in that mirror was baggy,
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

ripply skin hanging from my thighs, arms that wobbled when I lifted them,
and a stomach with accordion folds.
I immediately put myself on a diet and lost about 18 pounds over the course of
three months. I didn’t go on a lowfat diet, a low-glycemic diet, a high protein
diet, a low-carbohydrate diet (bite your tongue!), or any theme diet at all, for
that matter. I lost the weight the old-fashioned way, by counting calories. I car-
ried a lined pad with me wherever I went and wrote down everything I ate with
the approximate number of calories. When I got to 1,400 calories, I stopped
eating for the day. (It only took one day to realize I had to spread those calories
out or I wouldn’t be able to eat for the rest of the day after lunch!)
A low-calorie diet was the only type of diet I could live with, because it
allowed me to eat all types of food. As it turns out, that’s the only type of
weight-loss diet that really works for anyone, at any age. I should know. I
wrote this book! — Susan M.
Buddying Up to Lose Weight
Years ago, I joined a commercial weight-loss program and it helped me lose
weight. Recently when I decided to lose 10 pounds more, I figured I could use
what I had learned from the program and just do it myself. At the same time,
my friend and fellow teacher came into my office and she, too, wanted to
shed some pounds. We made it our new year’s resolution to lose weight
together and support each other along the way.
We first went to the school nurse’s office and borrowed her scale for a weigh-
in. We decided on a weekly weigh-in in the privacy of our own homes —
where we could take our clothes off and weigh a pound less! I dug up some
old material from the program and we started our calorie-controlled diets.
We found out that a local sandwich shop would deliver customized lowfat
submarine sandwiches to us at school for lunch Monday through Friday. We
used our lunch hour to discuss food and to help each other plan ahead when
one of us was going to a party or out to eat at a restaurant. We helped each
other stay motivated and reminded each other that being thinner was much
more appealing than eating an extra couple of meatballs.
One day, months later, my friend came to work and showed me that her pants
were very loose. I had lost some weight, too. We knew we couldn’t have
gotten that far without each other’s support. We felt so good about it that we
decided to keep going even after we both reached our goal weights. Two and
a half years later, I have lost 25 pounds, am down two sizes, bought a whole
new wardrobe, and finally threw out my “fat” clothes. My friend lost close to
20 pounds, got pregnant, and gave birth to a healthy baby.

Chapter 17: Ten Low-Calorie Success Stories

To maintain my weight, I eat pretty much the same thing everyday for break-
fast, lunch, and snacks, and always have a light dinner, except on Saturday
nights, when I go out to eat. That’s when I eat whatever I want, practice a
little portion control, and thoroughly enjoy myself. — Nancy B.
Staying Strong with “Want Power”
When I got out of the service, I was extremely fit. In a sense, I had no choice —
the Army worked us out and fed us well so that we would be in the best possi-
ble shape. I’m a good-size man and, at the time, I weighed 182 pounds.
As I moved up in the business world, I found that along with a fair share of
promotions and success came more sedentary office positions, too many
social and professional functions, and not enough time to be active. Next
thing I knew, I was tipping the scales at 240 pounds.
I was living in New York at the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and watched
the towers fall from my Brooklyn home. It had a profound affect on me. I was
scheduled to have prostate surgery the following day, and of course it was
delayed for a month while everyone in the city was trying to figure out how
to get their lives back on track again. I didn’t realize it at the time, but while I
was waiting to have the surgery, I started to become depressed. Before the
delay, I had been worried about having the surgery, and now I was worried
that I wouldn’t be able to have it in time to treat my condition. Although I had
my surgery in time and, like most New Yorkers, had started to recover from
the events of 9/11, I was still feeling rather morose and apathetic. I began to
eat more and more as a way of distracting myself from these feelings and,
probably, in an attempt to feel some pleasure.
I may have gotten back on track sooner, but the following summer I fell and
broke four ribs. It was a long time before I could move freely again. I kept
eating and kept gaining weight. I noticed signs that my weight was starting to
affect my health. I found myself gasping for breath one night as I walked from
one airport terminal to the next. I went to my doctor, who immediately sent
me to a pulmonary specialist. He found I wasn’t getting enough air into my
lungs and sent me home with a tank of oxygen. I was also diagnosed with
sleep apnea. At that point I weighed 343 pounds, and I was scared.
Eight months and many low-cal meals later, I’m down to 272 pounds. I’m still
working on my weight, but I know I’ll get to my goal of 220 because I’m com-
mitted to improving my health. I eat less and at regular times. I’ve stopped
relying on will power; now I rely on “want power.” I want this more than any-
thing else right now. I’ve joined a commercial weight-loss program because I
need and believe in the structure of a good diet plan and the help and guid-
ance of counselors who have struggled with weight issues themselves and
come out as winners. — Mike C.

Part VI
Appendixes

In this part . . .
I
t’s pretty obvious what should be included in the
appendixes to a book about low-calorie dieting — 
calorie counts! And that’s what you’ll find in this part. 
Calorie counts are presented in two different ways. In
Appendix A, selected individual foods are listed in alpha-
betical order, along with amount and the number of calo-
ries in that amount of food. In Appendix B, foods are
categorized into food groups, and one average calorie
count is given for all the foods listed in each group. This is
a less accurate but quick reference guide that might be a
fairly easy way to remember approximate calorie counts
when you don’t have access to a more complete guide. 
And last but not least, Appendix C features a handy metric
conversion guide to use when you cook.

Appendix A
Calorie Counts of Select Foods
I
n this appendix, you can find the calorie counts of many common foods.
Knowing this information can help you make food substitutions when
you’re adapting the menus in Chapter 6 to your own personal taste or when
you’re adding foods to increase the number of calories you consume in a day.
I round all figures off to the nearest tenth. Calorie values for similar foods can
vary widely, depending on the brand and size you use. Because of space con-
straints, you won’t find every available food in this list. A great Web site that
provides more complete information is www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/
Data/SR18/nutrlist/sr18list.html. Scroll down to the row marked
“Energy (calories)” and click on “A” for an alphabetized list of foods with 
calorie counts for common portion sizes.
This list can help you fill in calorie counts in your food diary and help you
keep track of calories when planning your own menus.

Appendix B
Calorie Counts by Food Groups
T
his appendix groups foods together and provides approximate calorie
counts for specific amounts of foods in each group. Each food, in the
amount given, provides approximately the same number of calories. For
instance, in the Grains and Starchy Vegetables group, 1⁄2 cup pasta has about
the same number of calories as half of a 6-inch pita bread or 1⁄3 cup cooked
lentils. Foods listed within the same food group can vary by 10 or 20 calories,
which isn’t a significant amount or anything you need to worry about when
making substitutions within a group. This information is helpful when your
focus is on portion control, rather than specific calorie counts of individual
foods; it’s also a quick and easy tool for low-calorie menu planning.
This quick-count method is less accurate than looking up the exact calories
for each and every food (check out Appendix A for more precise counts and
for calorie counts of many more individual foods), but it’s still a valid way to
take control of the amount of calories you consume. For one thing, knowing
the approximate number of calories in a few food groups is a lot easier than
trying to remember the specific calorie count of every food you eat. This
method of calorie counting is similar to the exchange system used by com-
mercial weight-loss groups, medically supervised weight-loss programs, and
dietitians who teach portion control. Grouping together foods with similar
calorie counts is the first step to understanding standard portion sizes for
different types of foods and practicing portion control as a way of limiting
your calories. See Chapter 3 for more details about portion control.
