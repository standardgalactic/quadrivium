Foreword
Foreword
This book aims to develop the practical and analytical skills needed to write a good research paper or 
a research chapter in a dissertation – assignments that many undergraduate students at University face. 
These skills include:-
•	 Understanding the difference between a research paper and an essay.
•	 Helping you develop ideas for your research paper. 
•	 Learning how to find the research papers you will need.
•	 Looking at actual research papers to develop your understanding of the contents.
•	 Develop an understanding of research methods, experimental design and bad science so you 
will have the skills to evaluate research for yourself.
•	 Develop the writing skills needed to write your research paper.
The practical skills will be developed by small exercises that the reader will be invited to undertake and 
the feedback that will be provided. 
The concepts that will be explained and skills developed are important for any undergraduate student 
and even more important for those students studying higher degrees, M.Sc.’s or other such courses, 
where an advanced understanding of the subject and advanced academic skills are expected as standard. 
Many books already exist to help with basic writing skills or even academic writing. Unlike those texts 
this book will focus solely on the skills required to write a research paper.
This is not a theoretical textbook but a learning tool help you develop the practical skills required. To 
this end each chapter will incorporate small exercises with solutions and feedback provided. 
At the end of the book, in Appendix 1, three complete research papers are presented. These were written 
by undergraduate students and will be used to illustrate the application of the techniques explored in 
the earlier chapters.
This book will start by explaining basic research concepts, as understanding these are important if you 
are to write about research, but while doing this unnecessary research jargon and Latin terms will be 
avoided…other books explain the differences between induction/deduction and abduction and other 
principles of logic and reasoning should you wish to take this topic further.

Foreword
Finally this book is not designed to help professional researchers write their own research paper as the 
skills involved in describing primary research are not entirely the same as those involved in writing a 
survey paper i.e. a research paper that evaluates the work of other researchers. 
Novice researchers can decide for themselves if they will gain some benefit from the chapters of this 
book that develop an understanding of good scientific principles and from the chapter that looks at the 
structure of well written research papers.

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
1	 Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
Introduction
This chapter will discuss basic research concepts as many students seem to have misconceptions regarding 
the word ‘research’. Clearing out these misconceptions and understanding the basics of research theory 
is important if you are to understand how to write a research paper or write a research chapter for 
a dissertation.
The tasks of writing a research paper and of writing a research chapter, as part of an undergraduate 
dissertation, are in many ways very similar thus if you are required to write a research chapter this book 
should still help you.
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will be able to…
•	 Explain what research is,
•	 Understand the basics of research theory,
•	 Understand the critical difference between books and research papers
•	 Understand what constitutes a good quality source
•	 Understand what is involved in writing a research paper 
All of these issues will be expanded on in the later chapters of this book which will endeavour to develop 
the practical skills needed to write a research paper.
This chapter consists of 13 sections:-
1)	 Research – A Common Misunderstanding
2)	 What is Research?
3)	 What is Knowledge?
4)	 A Simplified Scientific Process
5)	 A Hypothesis…a Testable Theory
6)	 The Differences between Research Papers and Books
7)	 Research Papers are Scary
8)	 The Differences Continued
9)	 Good Quality Sources
10)	Research Sources Ranked in Decreasing Order of Quality
11)	How You Demonstrate the Use of Good Quality Sources

Research – A Common Misunderstanding 
Many students seem to come to University misunderstanding the concept of research and probably for 
very good reasons. They also seem to have often picked up some very bad habits from school or college 
and these bad habits can cause very serious problems for students at University.
This misunderstanding and bad habits significantly impact on a student’s ability to write a research paper.
…So let’s start by fixing this now!

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
Activity 1 
Think back to your time at school or college – for you, unlike me, this probably won’t be ancient history – and answer 
the following questions Yes or No.
1.	
Were you ever asked to go and find out some information for yourself either from books or, far more likely these 
days, from the web?
2.	
Were you ever asked to prepare a presentation, perhaps on a subject of your choice, which involved Googling 
the subject?
3.	
Did your teacher ever use the word research to describe this activity as in ‘Go and research it for yourself’?
4.	
Did you ever find yourself cutting and pasting text from web pages into a report or into a PowerPoint presentation 
(be honest – I won’t listen to your answer)?
Activity 2 
Given your answers above would you accept the following definition of research as a valid definition…‘A search for 
information, facts or knowledge’?
Feedback 1
From my experience many students at school are asked to go and research a subject for themselves by searching for 
information from the web.
In some cases students are pointed to very useful sources such as Wikipedia though students are also sometimes warned 
the web is not always a reliable source. 
Still the web presents a vast collection of information. Want to know when Columbus set sail for America (he didn’t 
actually)? – Google it. Want to know the difference between an alligator and a crocodile? – Google it. 
…Other search engines do exist.
Want a simplified explanation of a ‘Lunar eclipse’ or the physics of a ‘Rainbow’ – go to Wikipedia (even if this isn’t always 
100% accurate).
Finding information is an essential life skill and the information available via the web is vast and modern tools make 
accessing this very simple…if you doubt this try using a 100 volume, hard back, print based encyclopaedia which is 
expensive to buy, very heavy to move, slow to search and far more limited in its content than the web. 
Don’t worry if you have never seen a print based encyclopaedia – they were probably well before your time. You may 
want to find one in a museum somewhere just so you can appreciate that life before the web did exist.
Given the web is a vast information source and given finding information is an essential life skill it is not surprising that 
teachers often tell students to go and find out for themselves…and quite often they do so by telling students to go 
and do their own research on the subject.

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
Feedback 2 
Given this you may think that research is indeed ‘A search for information, facts or knowledge’.
Teachers often badly misuse the word ‘research’ and thus it is not surprising that students come to University thinking 
their job is to find information and present this information in a research paper but this is not the case.
Writing a research paper is not at all about finding out and summarising information.
…and if you don’t understand what this task is how can you hope to do it well?
Many students think that writing a research paper means presenting the ‘information, facts or knowledge’ they have 
found.
But in fact you would be quite wrong to accept this definition of research and students who write research papers that 
do little more than present information are essentially failing. 
Finding information is not research no matter how difficult or impressive the subject.
If you were to write an essay, and note I use the word ‘essay’ here – not a research paper – explaining in 
detail how a computer encrypts information I would be quite impressed as this is not a simple topic. I 
would be especially impressed if you could explain the differences between different encryption methods 
and explain which method is best and why. By all means write a very good essay on the subject for me…
if you could do this well I would enjoy reading it.
…but no matter how complex the topic, or how impressive your essay is, finding information is not 
research and thus presenting a summary of this information does not make your essay a research paper. 
So if this isn’t research what is?
1.2	
What is Research?
Doing ‘research’ at University means something quite different than doing ‘research’ at school. 
Activity 3 
Watch the 3 minute video ‘What is research?’ by John Earnshaw posted on YouTube at  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJhpQs82uR8
Feedback 3
This video very helpfully highlights the gaps in our knowledge i.e. the ‘?’s
And it also highlights the fact that research is an activity…doing something other than reading…to move the boundary. 
…and by ‘our’ we mean the whole human race; i.e. there are things our entire species has yet to learn, problems that 
we as a species have yet to solve…
To do ‘research’ means doing something to find out something that no one else knows i.e. solving problems that no 
one else has yet solved.

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
Research is not about us finding out something that someone else knows – research means pushing 
forward the boundaries of human knowledge.
Finding out information is essentially a task of searching for information and reading.
Research is a very different task. It is active i.e. it means doing something that will enable you to discover 
new knowledge. In other words it means doing something that will let you learn something that no one 
else knows…and then writing about it so you can tell others what you have discovered. 
Thus if you are writing a research paper you need to do something that is far more than just finding 
and summarising information – you need to do something that will enable you to discover something 
new…but what is this something that you need to do?
Before we answer this it will help if we understand a little more about knowledge…after all we have just 
said that research is about pushing forward the boundaries of knowledge…so we must first understand 
what knowledge is. After that we can learn what researchers do. Then you will learn what it is you must 
do in order to write a good research paper.

1.3	
What is Knowledge?
Plato, who lived quite a long time ago, defined knowledge as ‘true justified belief’.
Activity 4 
Think about something you firmly believe is true but cannot prove.
Now think about something that someone else firmly believes but that you do not agree with.
Feedback 4
Personally I believe I am witty, charming and handsome…but I don’t think everyone agrees with me. 
You may absolutely believe, without a shadow of doubt, in the existence of God and you may indeed be correct. In 
support of your beliefs you may note the wonders of the Universe and the miracle that is life…but you cannot prove 
that God exists.
Others may believe with equal fervour that God does not exist…and perhaps it is they who are correct. In support of 
their beliefs they could present a discussion of science and evolution etc.…but they equally cannot prove that God 
does not exist.
Just because we firmly believe something to be true does not mean we know it to be true.
Plato’s definition of knowledge can be presented graphically:-
In other words:-
•	 There are many beliefs which are not necessarily all true
•	 There are many truths, not all of which are known or believed
•	 Among those beliefs which are true only a subset has been discovered and verified and it is 
this subset that counts as knowledge
Therefore, according to Plato’s definition, we cannot say we know something unless we can justify this 
i.e. present incontrovertible evidence.
Thus if research is about pushing forward the boundaries of human knowledge it must mean that research 
involves a) discovering new truths and b) finding evidence to verify these truths.
But how can researchers do this?…and if this is required to write a research paper how can you do this?
To answer these questions we need to consider the basics of a scientific process.

1.4	
A Simplified Scientific Process
People used to believe the Earth was flat and that the sun revolved around the Earth and they believed 
this for very good reasons. 
They could see the sun rise in the morning, cross the sky during the day and set at night. They were told 
about heaven and hell, at least many people were taught about this along with the existence of God…
God must have existed to create the sun etc, Heaven and Hell were reasonable suppositions given this 
and heaven was somewhere up above the clouds…hell was somewhere down below…beneath the Earth. 
If the Earth was not flat, where was heaven and hell? and what stopped people on the other side of the 
world from falling off?
For these reasons many people believed the Earth was flat but now most would say they know the Earth 
is round. So how could we come by this knowledge?
We came by this knowledge by following a process of scientific discovery…commonly called research,
This process follows three simple steps.
1)	 Observe something that can’t be explained by our current knowledge.
2)	 Provide a suggested explanation for this phenomenon…we call this suggested explanation 
a hypothesis.
3)	 Test the hypothesis to find out if it is really true. 
Remember ‘true justified belief’ – we need to test our theory in order to verify it – so step 3 is very 
important.
Activity 5 
Assume we have a hypothesis that heavy things fall faster than light things, think of a test we can do to prove this.
Feedback 5
To test this you may have thought to take a stone and a feather up to the top of a tower and dropping them both at 
the same time to find out which will get to the bottom first.
In fact this would be a very bad test. A feather is not just lighter than a stone it also has a much higher surface area and 
this causes friction which slows the feather down.
This brings us to a very important point:- our test, which we will call an experiment, must be a good and fair test. We 
will come back to this point later.

Activity 6
How about a different test? What if we were to take two virtually identical bricks, where the only differences were that 
one was made up of a light material and one was made from a dense material, and we then dropped these bricks at 
the identical moment and from an identical height?
Would this be a fair test?
Feedback 6
We would call this a controlled experiment. A controlled experiment is where we have a control test…in the case of the 
light brick that is identical in all other respects to the heavy brick.
As the only difference is the weight of the brick…not its size shape or anything else we can be sure that if the bricks are 
to fall at a different rate then it is the weight that causes this.
You may want to try out this experiment…just be sure no one will walk underneath the falling bricks.
Coming back to our simplified scientific process…1) observe 2) develop a hypothesis 3) test our hypothesis.

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
So, assuming we believed the Earth was flat as many people did, what could we have observed that would 
lead us to hypothesise that the Earth was round? and how could we have tested this theory?
1)	 If the Earth was flat a sailor would be able to see all of another ship at the same time no matter 
where they were on their current ship. However sailors noted that they could see the top of 
other ships before they could see the deck. Sailors also noted they could see better from the 
top of the mast – hence why they built a crow’s nest there for a lookout.
Line of sight from ship’s deck and from the top of a ships mast.
2)	 From this observation, which doesn’t fit our belief that the earth is flat, we could develop a 
hypothesis that the Earth was round as this would explain the observations. We could of course 
develop an alternative theory such as a sailors eyesight improves as they get away from the sea 
spray…and if this was our theory then we would need to find a way of testing a sailor’s eye sight. 
But let us proceed on the theory that the Earth is round.
3)	 We could test this hypothesis by setting off to sail around the world as Ferdinand Magellan did in 
his expedition of 1519–1522 which was the first to circumnavigate the Earth. This would surely 
prove that the Earth is round. 
So a simple scientific process is 1) make observations 2) develop a hypothesis 3) test the hypothesis. 
In fact the question of the shape of the Earth was settled long before Magellan’s expedition of 1519 – it 
was proven by a very clever astronomer and mathematician, Eratosthenes of Cyrene who lived approx. 
200–300 BC…almost 2000 years before Magellan’s expedition. 
Eratosthenes not only proved the Earth was round he determined how big it was.
Activity 7
Watch Carl Sagen’s video on Eratosthenes at  
www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8cbIWMv0rI
Lasting less than 7 mins this is an excellent video that demonstrates the scientific process we have discussed.

This video highlights several important issues…
1.	
The data we are basing our work on must be accurate i.e was there really no shadow at the bottom of the well? 
We will return to this point later.
2.	
The data disproved the previous belief that the Earth was flat…so Eratosthenes came up with a new hypothesis 
that the Earth was round. Actually previous scientists had already suggested this was likely based on the 
changing shape of the moon’s shadow but Eratosthenes went further and based on the data he calculated the 
circumference of the Earth with a fair degree of accuracy.
Activity 8
Think about this video – one crucial step in our scientific process is missing (make observations – develop a hypothesis – 
test the hypothesis). Which step is not discussed in this video?
Feedback 8
Eratosthenes came up with a new hypothesis that the Earth circumferences was approximately 40,000 km – but the 
video does not highlight how this hypothesis was tested – step 3 in our simplified scientific process.
Until we test the theory it is just a theory. We cannot claim to know the circumference of the Earth unless we test the 
theory and verify the theory is correct. 
We could test this hypothesis by asking someone to walk around the Earth and measure it but this would be very difficult 
given the Pacific Ocean is in the way. So we would need to find a simpler way to test this theory.
If Eratosthenes model of a round Earth is correct, as suggested by the shadow cast at Alexandria when no shadow was 
cast at Syene (800 km to the south), then we could make a prediction that going 800km south of Syene a shadow would 
be cast equal in length to the shadow at Alexandria but in the opposite direction.
If we tested this prediction and the prediction is correct it would imply Eratosthenes hypothesis was accurate i.e. that 
the circumference of the Earth is 40,000 km.
We would have verified the hypothesis and thus we could say we know the circumference of the Earth.
Making predictions based on a hypothesis is a good way of testing it. If the prediction proves to be 
accurate this lends evidence to support our hypothesis.

A Hypothesis…a Testable Theory
Activity 9
Assume we have a hypothesis that God exists…can you think of a way to test this?

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
Feedback 9
It is extremely difficult to come up with a simple, clear and incontrovertible test either to prove God exists or to prove 
God does not exist.
The definition of a Hypothesis is a ‘testable theory’…If we can’t devise a test then we don’t have a 
hypothesis – we only have a theory that science can’t prove. In other words we can’t claim to know the 
answer. Therefore while we may think God exists, or we may think God does not exist, but until we can 
devise a way to test this we cannot say we have a hypothesis regarding the existence of God.

The Differences between Research Papers and Books
So far we have looked at research – the process of pushing forward the boundaries of human knowledge. 
But research is of no value if in the end it is not published. 
Researchers publish their work in research papers in order to tell other researchers what they have 
discovered. 
In order to begin to understand how to write a research paper you must understand the differences 
between research papers and books.
Furthermore as research papers are quite different they are used quite differently.

Research Papers are Scary
If you looked at the research papers above you may have thought these papers look scary…they certainly 
look scary to me. In fact they don’t really look like they were expected to be read and understood by 
normal people (I am presuming you don’t mind being classed as a normal person).
You may also be a little daunted or worried if you feel you are expected to write something like one of 
these…if so the most important message to take away from this is don’t worry. 
It is true that writing a research paper is a complex and very academically challenging task, but it is not 
an impossible task – the proof of this is at the end of this book where there are three research papers 
written by students…student’s who initially had no knowledge of research at all.
If they can do it so can you – it just takes hard work!
The whole purpose of this book is of course to help you and there is one reassurance you can take note 
of now…
If the task of a research paper was to explain in detail an incredibly complex theory then you 
would need to really understand that incredibly complex theory. However the purpose of a 
research paper is not to explain the subject but to discuss and evaluate the research process 
therefore to write a research paper does not require an in depth knowledge of the specific 
subject. What it does require is a basic knowledge of a sound scientific research process.
So writing a research paper is not as difficult as it may first appear.

The Differences Continued
Going back to our consideration of the differences between research papers and books…
Feedback 11
We will learn how to look at and analyse the content of research papers properly later as this is an essential task if you 
are to successfully write your own research paper. 
For now we will settle for a superficial look at the structure and content….
The research papers are obviously much, much shorter than books, often 5–10 pages long, though some research papers 
are longer than the ones we have viewed. 
The structure of the papers is quite different from books…They are often, though not always, presented in a two column 
format and they don’t have a table of contents or different chapters…though they do have different sections.
They have an abstract at the start and a list of references at the end.
Unlike a text book the research papers are on one extremely focused, and in this case extremely complex and 
technical, subject. 
Unlike a textbook, that may explain general theories or concepts, these research papers describe some actual work 
done on one specific project.
If you looked at the headings you may have noticed that these papers seem to follow our simplified scientific process…
they describe some complex theories (ie a hypothesis), 
they describe some experiments and results…(i.e. how the theories were tested),
and based on this they reached conclusions…(i.e. claims for new knowledge that push forward the boundaries of 
human knowledge).
These papers may, in the conclusions, also highlight problems still needing to be resolved i.e. further research that 
needs to be done – this is common.
Activity 12
Decide which of the statements below apply to text books and which apply to research papers (you may wish to write 
‘book’ or ‘research paper’ next to each statement):-
1.	
These are written for professionals working in that field
2.	
These are written for students to learn from.
3.	
You can find alternative sources that describe much the same information
4.	
They will explain basic concepts or terms
5.	
They may explain the historical origins of the subject
6.	
They may explain the work done by many individuals, not always named.
7.	
They explain the work done by a very few individuals (the authors)
8.	
They may explain the work done by just one individual (the author)
9.	
If they explain work done they should explain in detail how the work was done.
10.	 They make claims that may never have been made before 
11.	 They should present evidence to support the claims made

1.	
These are written for professionals working in that field
Research papers are not written for students, though Universities often expect students to read them and engage 
with research. They are written for other researchers who want to understand what has been done so far and 
want to understand what problems still needs to be solved. Research papers are also written for professionals 
who want to take the state of the art theory and apply this theory to a real world problem.
2.	
These are written for students to learn from.
3.	
You can find alternative sources that describe much the same information
4.	
They will explain basic concepts or terms
5.	
They may explain the historical origins of the subject
2–5 all apply to textbooks. Textbooks are written to explain and teach. Many textbooks often exist on the same 
subject. The depth and complexity of them will often differ so you may find one textbook meets your needs 
better than another (just as there are other books that teach academic writing skills that you may, or may not 
prefer, over this book). Because of this textbooks often explain basic concepts and terms and sometimes present 
an interesting, though out of date, historical perspective of the subject.
Research papers don’t explain basic concepts or terms and rarely provide a historical perspective. They are written 
for other researchers and professionals who already have an in depth knowledge of the subject. Research papers 
do however usually provide a research perspective of the work presented i.e. they briefly mention other research 
that has been done in the field, or is ongoing, and they explain how the research described in this papers builds 
upon and fits in with the other research being done. 
6.	
They may explain the work done by many individuals, not always named.
Textbooks cover a wide subject and in doing so often explain theories, concepts and methods developed over a 
period of decades by many people other than the authors. As such it is often not possible to attribute the work 
to many of individuals involved though sometimes individuals who have made a very significant contribution 
are named. These are often not the author of the textbook.
7.	
They explain the work done by a very few individuals (the authors)
8.	
They may explain the work done by just one individual (the author)
9.	
If they explain work done they should explain in detail how the work was done.
10.	 They make claims that may never have been made before 
11.	 They should present evidence to support the claims made
7–11 all apply to research papers. Research papers by contrast describe one research project undertaken by a 
very few individuals – usually the author or authors of the paper. Because they are describing this one small piece 
of work they should describe clearly what was done and how it was done. Based on the evidence they present 
research papers should end by making claims for new knowledge – remember this is the goal of research – 
though they can, and often do, highlight gaps that still remain in our knowledge.
By analogy you could think of a book that teaches you how to cook, how to choose your equipment, 
basic techniques of food preparation etc. as a textbook…and a recipe, which explains in detail how to 
cook one specific thing, as a research paper.
…don’t push this analogy too far.

Activity 13
Given all this consider…
1.	
Which would you trust more a research paper or a book?
2.	
Should you trust them or is it good not to trust them?
Feedback 13
Books usually describe established knowledge that many people would agree with though clearly old theories, methods 
and techniques are replaced by newer theories, methods and techniques. So the content of books do become out of 
date though usually this is a slow process over a period of years or decades (depending on the subject).
As children we learn to accept as true well established and reputable sources of information…our parents, our teachers 
and text books. We trust these sources of information and it is good to trust these sources of information. If you didn’t 
trust anything you were ever told you would be dysfunctional and probably classed as paranoid. How often have you 
heard words to the effect ‘it must be true I read about it’…though you may have reason to doubt some written sources 
of information e.g. some newspapers, gossip magazines and the web. 
In much the same way as you may distrust some written sources you should distrust research papers…all 
research papers! 
Research papers present the conclusions reached by a very small group of individuals – sometime they have plenty of 
good evidence to support their conclusions but sometimes this is not the case. You should not trust the conclusions 
presented in a research paper but instead you should evaluate the evidence for yourself. That is why good research 
papers present a detailed and clear account of the work that was done and the results so you can evaluate the evidence 
for yourself. 
The information in research papers can also become out of date much more quickly than the information presented in 
books – some theories can quickly be proved to be incorrect or improved. Thus, while some older papers are still very 
valid, we should always look for the most up to date and recent papers on a subject.
The most critical difference between books and research papers is that you should not trust what 
you read in a research paper but you should instead evaluate the evidence for yourself.
Other researchers expect you to distrust them and question the validity of their conclusions. They 
welcome the fact that you will probe their research as this will help to ensure their conclusions are valid.
As this is such an important topic we will come back to this shortly and indeed devote an entire chapter 
to this later.

Good Quality Sources
Activity 14
Consider the following scenario…a person you have never met before and are unlikely to meet again offers you a new 
high quality television, normally costing £2000, for half price. The person says it comes with a 5 year guarantee.

has a history of good service for the full price?

If you buy the TV from the person you have never met before you are taking a risk. The 5-year guarantee is worthless if 
the person won’t be around to honour the guarantee. Worse still the TV could of course be stolen property!
You take a risk if you don’t buy your goods from reputable sources…in much the same way you take a 
risk if you don’t use reputable sources for your research.
Furthermore your readers will know whether or not you have used good quality sources and you will 
be judged on the quality of the sources you use.
1.9.1	
Textbooks
Textbooks can be very high quality sources of information but they don’t describe research so for the 
purpose of writing a research paper they are almost completely useless…there are a few exceptions.
There are exceptions…a research student who has done a PhD at university, a 3-year research project, 
will normally have written this up in a book called a PhD thesis. While this is a book this would be 
considered a high quality source of research information.
Some books contain a collection of good quality research papers…these are not normal textbooks and 
you would not normally refer to the book as a whole but cite one of the specific papers within the book.

1.9.2	
The WWW
The Web is an extremely unreliable source of information as anyone can publish anything on the web 
in a matter of minutes. Though you can find out very up to date information/news from the web it is 
the most unreliable source of information you can use. 
If you are writing about research being done in the area of computer security and you want to demonstrate 
that this is an important topic you may show, as an example, details of a particular company who had 
their security breached. Citing a widely reported news web service as a source for this information is 
fine but for most research purposes web references should be avoided.
1.9.3	
Formal standards and Government papers
Formal standards are published by government and professional bodies that are authoritative and 
reputable. These include cover software, engineering, medical, ethical and legal standards.
While these are authoritative and reputable they are not about research and are therefore not good as 
a primary source of information. 
Of course if you are discussing research to improve one of these standards then of course it is legitimate 
to refer to the standard itself.
1.9.4	
Refereed Journal and Conference Papers
Refereed Journal and conference papers are the best quality source of information you can use.
Journals are books that contain a collection of research papers on one general topic. The same journal 
will regularly publish papers on the same general topic – each version will therefore have a different year 
or volume number associated with it.
Conference proceedings are very similar to journals. Research conferences are held regularly throughout 
the world. These are attended by hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of researchers. Each researcher 
will give a presentation about their research after which they will be expected to answer questions. After 
the conference the papers are published in the conference proceedings.
An important point to note here that the papers in journals are checked, refereed, before they are 
published…and the best quality conferences also get the papers refereed first to check for quality.
This is very similar to the process you may follow when applying for jobs. Prospective employers often 
ask for references and someone who knows you will be expected to say how good your skills are and 
how motivated you are etc.

In much the same way papers are checked. To ensure the process is fair and not open to bias research 
papers are anonymised by removing the author’s names and then a group of academics in that subject 
area will decide if the research paper is good enough to publish.
Not all conferences follow a rigorous referee process so some are better than others. It is not easy to 
know which conferences and journals are the best in terms of quality until you start to publish research 
papers in your subject area. Generally though, while some are better than others, journal and conference 
papers are the best quality research sources you can use.
1.9.5	
Professional Magazines
Some professional bodies are heavily involved in research and support and fund research conferences 
and publish numerous journals. These often also print magazine versions of full research papers. In 
many respects these are almost as good as research papers published in journals but the language and 
explanations are made simpler – thus for novice researchers these are an excellent starting point and 
source of information.

Research Sources Ranked in Decreasing Order of Quality
Activity 15
Reorder the following list putting the highest quality research sources at the top and the lowest at the bottom.
Conference paper

Journal Paper
Conference paper (some of these are as good as the best quality journals)
A PhD thesis (also excellent quality)
A research paper in a professional magazine (almost as good and a very good starting point) 
A formal published standard (good quality but not for research)
A text book (can provide good explanations but do not describe current research)
A web page (good for current news but not a refereed source of research information)
To summarise this you will be judged on the quality of the sources you use:- 
Journal and conference papers are the best quality  
source of information you can use.
Textbooks and web pages should be avoided as much as possible.

How You Demonstrate the Use of Good Quality Sources 
Activity 16
Consider the following two research papers and decide which came from the best quality source:-
Research Paper 1
‘A multisensor fusion system for moving object detection and tracking in urban driving environments.’  
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~youngwoo/doc/icra-14-sensor-fusion.pdf, date accessed 1st June 2014
Research Paper 2
Cho, H., Seo, Y. W., Kumar, B. V., & Rajkumar, R., 2014, ‘A multisensor fusion system for moving object detection and tracking 
in urban driving environments.’, In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation, pages 1836–1842.
Feedback 16
These papers are in fact the same paper. This was one of the papers you looked at in earlier in this chapter. 
Notice how the second reference highlights the name of the conference the research papers was published in – 
highlighted in italics – and those who know would recognise the IEEE is a very reputable source.
From the first citation we would only know that it was a web page and therefore we could only presume it was a poor 
quality source. 
It is therefore very important that you provide a correctly formatted reference list that describes all of your sources and 
highlights the name of the journal or conference a research paper was published in.

There are different standards for writing a reference list. Two of the most common are the Harvard 
standard (where the sources are listed alphabetically by author) and the British standard (where the 
sources are numbered).
Even within these standards there are slightly different formats and you should follow any publication 
instructions you are provided with.
My preferred format, when referencing research papers, is the Harvard format where you provide the 
following details:-
The names of the authors, the year the paper was published, ‘the title of the paper in quotes’, the 
title of the journal or conference in italics, the volume number and page numbers (see paper 2 
in the exercise above for an example of this).
Activity 17
Consider a bill that has arrived. You need to pay your rent by a specified date otherwise you will be threatened 
with eviction.
Does it matter most how the bill arrived (mail or email) or are the details of the bill far more important (i.e. how much 
the bill is for, who must be paid and when it must be paid by)?
Feedback 17
The details of the bill are far more important than how it arrived. 
In much the same way if we find and use a good quality research paper it is irrelevant how we obtained this paper (via 
the post, via a library or, more commonly these days. via the web) but it is very important we show it was published in 
a journal or conference (the best quality source).
Some people when providing a reference to a research paper will provide additional details at the end including the 
web site where the paper can be found. They do this to make it easier for the reader to find the same source should 
they wish to do so. 
E.g. for the paper above this would be…
Cho, H., Seo, Y.W., Kumar, B.V., & Rajkumar, R., 2014, ‘A multisensor fusion system for moving object detection and tracking 
in urban driving environments.’, In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation, pages 1836–1842. 
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~youngwoo/doc/icra-14-sensor-fusion.pdf
While this is perfectly OK it does take the focus away from the name of the conference or journal and could confuse 
a reader if the reference is badly formatted. The reader could think this is just a web page – the lowest quality source.
As you are judged on the quality of your sources it is therefore important when referencing journal or 
conference papers to highlight the name of the journal or conference. Providing the web address where 
you obtained the paper can be a distraction and this detail can be safely ignored.

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
1.12	
How to Write a Research Paper
We started this chapter by refuting the myth that research was searching for information. Writing an 
essay may involve searching for information and summarising this but this is not the same for writing 
a research paper.
Research involves:- 
•	 developing a hypothesis i.e. a new theory that can be tested
•	 doing experiments to determine whether or not the theory is valid
•	 drawing conclusions from the results,
•	 writing all of this up as a research paper and finally
•	 either presenting this research at a conference and getting the research published in the 
conference proceedings or
•	 publishing the paper in a journal.
Having now looked at the basics of research and the basic differences between research papers and books 
we can now consider what you need to do if you are to write a research paper.

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
Activity 18
Given what we have learnt about research answer the following questions (yes or no):-
a.	
In writing a research paper would you be expected to push forward the boundaries of human knowledge? 
b.	
Is it good enough to read and summarise good quality research papers?
c.	
Are you expected to develop your own hypothesis?
d.	
Are you required to do your own experiments and report the results?
Feedback 18
The answer to these questions are:-
a.	
Yes you would be expected to make your own contribution to knowledge.
b.	
No, it is not enough to summarise good quality research papers
c.	
You would not start by developing a hypothesis…though you may develop one in the end. We will come back 
to this later.
d.	
No you would not be expected to do your own experiments.
If you are not expected to do your own experiments to test a hypothesis a key question is ‘How else can 
you make a contribution to knowledge?’ 
Most research papers describe primary research – this is where the researcher has performed their own 
experiments – but there is another type of research paper called a survey paper.
In a survey paper the researcher does not do their own research. Instead the researcher surveys the 
research literature. In doing this they are still expected to a make contribution to knowledge by analysing 
the information they find and by reaching conclusions based on this analysis. This analysis may lead the 
researcher to propose a new hypothesis that then needs to be tested by further research.
When a student at University is asked to write a research paper they are almost always being asked to 
write a survey paper.
Giving you the skills to analyse research papers and write a good survey paper, that makes a real 
contribution to knowledge, is the goal of this book and each aspect of this task will be covered in detail 
later. For now a summary of the main steps is provided:-

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
1.12.1	
Step 1) Determine the Question
Firstly you must decide what your research paper will be about. Doing this is not simple. 
If you are to push forward the boundaries of knowledge you must know where one of the boundaries lies. 
Gaps in our knowledge are reported in research papers thus to determine the question i.e. the topic of 
your paper. You will therefore need the skills to find a set of research papers on one coherent subject. 
Reading these will help you to determine the thrust of your paper. 
Thus you cannot start the process by defining the topic of your paper as you must first identify the gaps 
in our knowledge. 
You start by defining the general subject, find papers on this subject and use these to find the gaps in 
our knowledge. Based on these you define the precise topic of your paper.
We will cover the skills to do this later in this book.
Having determined the subject matter you will analyse the papers to generate new knowledge by…
evaluation…comparison…application (see steps 2–4 below). 
Finally you will need to write your research paper (step 5 below).

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
1.12.2	
Step 2) Critically Evaluating the Research
Activity 19
Remember our simplified research method:- a) observe a phenomenon b) generate a hypothesis and c) test the 
hypothesis.
Consider the following description of some research and the conclusion reached and ask:- 
a.	
Would you accept the conclusion as valid?
b.	
If not, why would you not accept this? 
c.	
Is this based on your personal opinion or was there a flaw in the research?
One night after going out with some friends I noticed that many of the people I met seemed to support the local football 
team and virtually no one was supporting a different team – many of the people I met were wearing replica football kits 
and were celebrating a game won (sadly an event that is unusual ).
From this I developed the hypothesis ‘My local football team is the most popular team in the world’ – a legitimate 
testable hypothesis.
To test this I developed a simple questionnaire, with just one question on it, ‘Which is your favourite football team?’ 
Being a good researcher I made sure that my questionnaire did not asked biased questions, such as ‘Is the local football 
team your favourite?’ and knowing it was important to base my results of a sample that was not too small I went into 
the city centre and asked 500 people to answer my short questionnaire. As I also knew it is important not to bias the 
results I made sure the people who answered the questionnaire were strangers who passed at random and were not 
selected by me.
In response to this questionnaire some people did say that they did not like football but when pushed they did say they 
liked it when the local team won as this made other people around them happy. 
The final results from the survey were are follows:-
87% supported the local football team
10% supported other teams
3% denied supporting any team (even when pushed to give an answer).
From this I concluded my hypothesis was indeed correct – my local team is the most popular team in the world and 
the result was not even marginal.
So:-
a.	
Do you accept the conclusion as valid?
b.	
If not, why would you not accept this? 
c.	
Is your answer to (b) based on your personal opinion or can you find a flaw in my research?

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
Feedback 19
I am sure that you do not accept the conclusion as valid and if not this should not be because of your personal experience 
or personal opinion but should come from critically evaluating the research.
There were two significant flaws with this research as I am sure you noticed:-
1.	
The respondents were not people taken at random – they were all walking down a street in the local city. Thus 
they probably lived or worked in the area and therefore were more likely to support the local team than any 
other. The respondents were certainly not representative of people from around the world.
2.	
The questionnaire was indeed unbiased but by the time I pushed the respondents ‘who didn’t like football’ the 
results certainly were biased.
3.	
You could question whether the sample size was large enough but actually it was quite large and the results 
were not marginal – asking more people would not likely have made any difference.
The example of research described above is simplistic and deliberately flawed. The purpose was to show 
that by critically evaluating the research you can reach your own conclusions. You can conclude that 
the researcher’s conclusions are flawed or you can conclude that the researcher’s conclusions seem to be 
justified. Either way your conclusion should be based on a judgment of the research process and evidence 
used to support the researcher’s conclusions.
Critical evaluation does not mean finding fault. 
‘Critical’ in this context means ‘Very Important’ – it does not mean criticise.
Critical evaluation therefore means to judge the important aspects of the work.
If we evaluate the research and find no flaws then we have reason to accept the conclusions are valid 
i.e. the research has value.
Activity 20
Another common flaw researchers often make is to assume that a causal relationship exists just because there is a 
relationship between two events. A causal relationship means that one event has caused the other.
Consider the following scenario:-
I believe I am extremely popular (people do occasionally laugh at my jokes even if my daughter doesn’t) – that is my 
hypothesis.
To test this I watch what happens when I get off the train at the centre of my city (the last stop on the line) and I notice 
that when I get off everyone else gets off as well.
Is there really a causal relationship here? By this I mean am I really so popular that my departure causes everyone else 
to leave the train at the same time?

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
Feedback 20
Of course the events are related. I get off the train because the train has arrived at the city centre – everyone else gets 
off the train at the same time for the same reason.
This does not mean to say my departure has caused everyone else to leave the train.
If I reached this conclusion it would be a mistake.
It is easy to make a mistake when doing research by incorrectly assuming a causal relationship exists.
Identifying a relationship between two events does not mean to say that one has caused the other. Take 
a classic example:- if you notice that smokers have a higher incidence of cancer does that mean that 
smoking has caused the cancer…or could it be that the smokers are smoking to distract themselves 
from their worries?
Did the smoking cause the cancer or did the cancer cause the smoking? Or indeed are the patients with 
cancer just smoking a lot because someone nearby a cancer hospital is selling cigarettes very cheaply?
If we incorrectly assume a causal relationship exists between smoking and cancer then we are wasting 
lots of time, money and effort to reduce smoking as this won’t save lives.

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
Of course we know that smoking does cause cancer and reducing smoking will reduce the incidence of 
cancer but the point remains valid – just because two events have a relationship does not mean we can 
assume that the relationship is a causal relationship. 
When researchers reach conclusions we must critically evaluate the evidence to see if their conclusions 
are sound and this evaluation should not be based on your personal experience or opinion but on sound 
well-reasoned arguments.
By critically evaluating research we can make a contribution to knowledge by confirming or casting 
doubt upon the claims for knowledge that other researchers make.
Critical evaluation requires:- 
a)	 an evaluation of research methods, 
b)	 evaluating the discussion of results, and 
c)	 evaluating the conclusions reached. 
All of this requires a deeper understanding of:-
•	 research theory,
•	 how research should be conducted and 
•	 the importance of experiments and experimental design. 
These topics will be discussed later in this book and will enable us to consider what, if anything has 
gone wrong with the research.
1.12.3	
Step 3) Comparing Different Theories or Methods
Having evaluated research the next step is to compare different theories or methods.
Different researchers, in different papers, will propose different theories or different ways of solving the 
same problem.
You may be the only person who has read a particular combination of papers therefore you may be the 
only person in the world who is in a position to compare and contrast these different theories or methods.

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
Activity 21
Consider the following two cameras (other cameras, by other manufacturers do exist):- 
Sony DSCHX50 a compact 20 MP digital camera with a 30X optical zoom. A small light camera designed for travel and 
convenience that takes reasonably good photographs.
Sony Alpha 77 mark II a 24 MP entry level professional camera which requires a range of lenses and is a bulkier camera 
but produces excellent images. 
The description above is not designed to endorse particular products and the accuracy of it is not confirmed – the description 
above is purely for the purpose of this exercise. 
Consider what conclusions or proposals could you reach if you were able to really compare these cameras in depth – 
not just by comparing the simple descriptions provided but by also comparing the internal working and the designs 
of the cameras.
Feedback 21
Clearly we could compare the cost of the cameras, the resolution, details of the image sensor in each camera and details 
of the image quality (as evidenced by benchmark tests) and reach conclusions regarding the relative cost v’s quality of 
the camera to determine if the more expensive camera is really that much better. If everything else was similar we could 
perhaps also make deductions about the relative quality and impact of the differing image sensor.
Finally if we really thought about it deeply we could perhaps think about how a hybrid camera could be designed, such 
as the Sony HX400V, which may have some of the advantages of both – higher image quality but without the hassle 
of having to carry multiple lenses. Then again this may have some disadvantages…not as small and convenient as the 
DSCHX50 but having a smaller sensor than the Alpha 77 mark II and thus a compromise in terms of quality.
…sadly the HX400V has already been thought about and designed so we can’t claim the credit.
Just as comparing the cameras is not a simple task comparing different theories or methods is not simple. 
It takes thought and a reasonable knowledge and understanding of the detail and differences between 
the proposed methods…but by doing this comparison you can again push forward the boundaries of 
human knowledge by proposing potential improvements.
Remember you may be the only person who is in a position to compare the methods having been the 
only person to read two particular research papers.
Your comparison may show that one method is always more accurate than another and therefore you 
may be able to recommend that one of the methods is discarded in favour of the other. By comparing in 
detail how different methods work you may be able to propose a hybrid method by combining parts of 
each – but which parts would be combined and how? Would the hybrid method give you the advantages 
of both methods to overcome the disadvantages, would it combine the disadvantages or would it do both?

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
By comparing current theories and proposing a new theory, or by proposing a new method, you are 
effectively proposing a new hypothesis…ie that your proposal is better than the alternatives. Of course 
this may then require experiments to confirm your hypothesis and you can propose the experiments that 
would test your proposed theory or method…but even without doing this experiment your comparison 
has hopefully led to a new proposal that will help to push forward the boundaries of human knowledge.
1.12.4	
Step 4) Applying the Theories or Methods 
Activity 22
Consider the same two cameras:– 
Sony DSCHX50 a compact 20 MP digital camera with a 30X optical zoom. A small light camera designed for travel and 
convenience that takes reasonably good photographs.
Sony Alpha 77 mark II a 24 MP entry level professional camera which requires a range of lenses and is a bulkier camera 
but produces excellent images. 
Which of these would you recommend to someone hoping to start a business as a professional wedding photographer? 
Which would you recommend to a professional photographer wishing to win an international photography competition 
for professionals where the goal is to photograph microscopic life?

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
Feedback 22
Thinking about this it is of course easy to recommend the Sony Alpha 77 mark II to a professional wedding photographer 
but is this camera really good enough when wishing to photograph microscopic life? If not, why not? What features 
would a camera need for this application? What recommendations could you make?
The final way in which you can make a real contribution to knowledge is to consider how the theories 
or methods apply to a range of real life situations…or indeed will the theories/methods fail under 
certain conditions?
You may be able to consider situations that the original researchers failed to consider and thus you may 
make valuable recommendations that enables the research to be used to solve real world problems. 
Thus by a) critically evaluating the research, b) comparing the theories and c) considering the application 
of the theory your aim is to present your conclusions…and in each case your conclusions should be 
backed up by well-reasoned arguments – not by personal opinion.
By doing all of this you will be able to write a research paper  
that makes your own unique contribution to knowledge!
Presenting your analysis requires you to do far more than just present a summary of current research 
papers. It is by doing this analysis that you make a contribution to knowledge and it is your contribution 
that makes your paper worth reading. 
1.12.5	
Step 5) Write your Research Paper 
The final task involves writing your research paper:-
•	 writing an engaging abstract, 
•	 writing a focussed introduction,
•	 writing a clear summary of current research,
•	 presenting your analysis and reasoned argument (your evaluation, your comparison and your 
consideration of the application of the theory)
•	 bringing together your conclusions and leaving the reader feeling that you have made a clear 
contribution to knowledge.
In reality this task cannot be done at the end – your paper will need to be drafted and refined. Drafting 
your paper will help you to define the question and the title of the paper itself may evolve. Certainly 
the arguments you make and the body of the paper will need to evolve and be refined as you progress.

Just What is ‘Research’ Anyway?
None of this is easy of course. All of this involves advanced academic skills that I hope to help you 
develop through the exercises and feedback in the following chapters of this book.
A final point to remember:- as challenging and as daunting as this task is, others, who had no knowledge 
of research at the start, have managed this before you. If they can do this so can you!
1.13	
Summary
To summarise this chapter…research is not about finding information. Research is a process by which 
the boundaries of human knowledge are pushed forward. This involves developing a hypothesis, testing 
the hypothesis and reaching conclusions based on this testing. 
We will be judged on the quality of the sources we use and therefore we must use and correctly reference 
journal and conference papers.
The research process requires accurate data and has many potential errors hence why we need to critical 
evaluate the evidence. 
As we are evaluating the research done by others,  
others will evaluate the quality of our analysis.
Therefore the conclusions we reach should be based on well-reasoned argument not personal opinion 
or bias. 
Finally by critically evaluating the evidence, comparing the theories and by considering how the theory 
may apply to real world situations we can reach our own well-justified conclusions and these conclusions 
are our contribution to knowledge.
We will return to each of the concepts introduced here throughout the book and hopefully, by the end, 
you will have a good understanding of these concepts and understand how to apply them. 
Please note: Many of the activities in this book require research papers and videos to be accessed via 
links to the web. If any of these materials have moved and the links broken please use the relevant 
keywords and Google to find current versions of the materials.

Research – Changing our World
2	 Research – Changing our World
Introduction
Research is an active task that pushes forward the boundaries of knowledge. It is done by passionate, 
intelligent people who want to make a positive impact on our changing world. 
Research is not done by people with strangely shaped heads wearing smelly lab coats – OK they sometimes 
do wear smelly lab coats.
This chapter will highlight samples of research and the impact this could have on our world over the 
next 5–10 years. 
Any research paper you write must make your contribution to this changing world. This chapter may 
help you to appreciate some of the possibilities.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Researchers Change the World
When you write a research paper you should make a contribution to knowledge that may have an impact 
on one aspect of a changing world.
Activity 1
Listed in this chapter are a collection of short videos that highlight practical examples of current research. The passion 
of the researchers and the impact this research could have on changing our world is evident in many of these videos.
The list of subjects is not comprehensive and certainly it would be impossible to give you an up-to-date comprehensive 
list of research projects.
Watch whichever videos are of interest to you – I would encourage you to watch them all – and while doing so think 
about the researchers, who are intelligent passionate human beings, and their vision for a changing world. 
There is no feedback for this activity but the final section of this chapter includes a task for you to do which the videos 
may help with.
As mentioned above you don’t need to watch all of the videos and you can skip complete sections if you wish, but don’t 
skip the final section of this chapter.

Your Contribution to a Changing World 
Hopefully you will now appreciate some of the contributions scientists and researchers are trying to 
make to the world in which you live.
There is one thing all these researchers share…a passion for their subject.
Activity 2
Spend a few minutes considering your subject area…
What problems still need to be solved?
What can the specialists in your field still not do? 
What do they still not know? 
What contribution could you potentially make if you became a scientist or researcher?
Feedback 2
If you are required to write a research paper the topic of the paper may be specified. In this case you will with any luck 
be able to see it is relevant to the degree you are doing.
However if you have a choice in the subject then finding a subject area that is of interest to you will make the task of 
writing the paper much nicer.
Hopefully the videos above will have helped to inspire you to pick a subject that a) is of interest to you and b) one where 
you can make a real contribution.

Finding Research Papers 
3	 Finding Research Papers 
Introduction
This chapter will start to help you develop the practical skills you need in order to write your research paper.
So far we have looked at the basic principles of research – that the purpose is to push forward the 
boundaries of human knowledge – and we have looked at some of the work being done by researchers 
in a range of different subjects.
We have discussed the definition of knowledge – true justified belief – and the role that experiments 
play to verify a hypothesis.
We have also discussed briefly how, when writing a survey paper you can make a contribution to 
knowledge, i.e. by critical evaluation, comparison and application of theory, even though when writing 
a survey paper you won’t be reporting your own experiments.
In discussing this we also looked at one critical role of a research paper – so researchers can publish 
their research results and conclusions. However research papers do have another role…they exist so 
other researchers, such as yourself, can discuss and critically evaluate the research reported in the papers.
Other researchers expect you to critically evaluate their work. They welcome this as they recognise the 
role you can play to push forward the boundaries of human knowledge. 
In order to do this there are several important skills to develop. The first is to learn how to find research 
papers…but not just any research papers. You need to find a group of papers that are appropriate for 
your research paper title. This is the main skill we will develop in this chapter.
Assuming you have a choice of topic, you will also need to develop an appropriate title for your research 
paper. To do this you will need to understand what makes an appropriate title. In this chapter we will 
also consider what makes an appropriate title for your research paper.

Finding Research Papers 
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will be able to…
•	 use two tools to find research papers,
•	 develop your searching skills,
•	 find a cohesive set of good quality research papers appropriate for your paper.
•	 understand what makes an appropriate title for a research paper or research chapter and, just 
as importantly,
•	 what makes an inappropriate title and why.
In later chapters we will learn how to analyse these papers and learn how to write your own but for now 
it is important that we learn how to find the papers we will use. 
Remember you will be judged on the quality of the sources you use so you will learn specifically how to 
find a set of journal and conference papers, i.e. good quality research papers, appropriate to the paper 
you will write.
This chapter consists of 9 sections:-
1)	 An Unexpected Starting Point
2)	 Choosing a General Topic for your Research Paper
3)	 Tools for Finding Research Papers
4)	 Learning How to Find Research Papers
5)	 How to Find a Coherent Set of Research Papers
6)	 Choosing a Title for Your Research Paper
7)	 Choosing a Title for a Dissertation Research Chapter
8)	 Other Resource Discovery Services such as the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ)
9)	 Summary
3.1	
An Unexpected Starting Point
Activity 1
Consider any essay you have ever written. Did you start with a topic and then find appropriate books and resources? 
Or did you wander through the library, looking at all of the 1000’s of books available, and think what should I write my 
essay on?
Now consider the following question:-
Assuming you are free to choose the topic of your research paper…
a.	
Should you start be defining the topic/title of your paper and then find appropriate research papers for this 
given topic? 
b.	
Or should you find the research papers and then define the title of your paper based on the research papers 
you find?

Finding Research Papers 
If you choose option b, and you therefore do not know the topic, how do you decide which research 
papers you will use?
Feedback 1
It seems self-evident that you must first define the topic and then, knowing what the topic is, you can find appropriate 
research papers. However writing a research paper and writing an essay are quite different tasks and this approach will 
not usually work well for reasons explained below.
Activity 2
Consider you are planning an extremely unusual trip…you have never seen the Sahara desert and you want to see 
what it is like there:- 
a.	
Should you start by deciding exactly where within thus huge desert you want to visit and then get the 
appropriate maps? 
b.	
Or should you get the maps first and then use these to decide where best to visit?
Feedback 2
Clearly if there is a specific place you want to visit then you need to work out how to get to that specific place but 
sometimes it is best not to start out with a firmly fixed idea of your destination but to let your destination be dictated 
by pragmatic concerns e.g. convenient travel options. You can still explore and enjoy the results.

Finding Research Papers 
In a similar way when writing a research paper you may suppose that you should start by defining your 
research topic and the title of your paper and then find appropriate research papers given the title of 
your paper. However this approach can lead to very specific problems:-
What if no one is doing research on your chosen topic because it is too difficult (e.g. time travel)? 
What if the research in this area was all done years ago and researchers have now moved on 
to newer topics (e.g. ‘transputers’…a computing research topic that was hot the 1990s but is 
now no longer a current topic).
Remember research is about pushing forward to boundaries of human knowledge. If you don’t know 
where these boundaries are you cannot decide on an appropriate topic!
There is one place where you can find out about the current limitations in our knowledge, i.e. where the 
boundaries are, and that is in research papers. 
Research papers finish with conclusions that describe what has been learnt from the research but also 
they often describe what problems still need to be solved. These problems are the boundaries…things 
we still need to learn.
Research papers will also often describe competing theories proposed by different researchers…thus 
they describe things that we are still not certain of i.e. which method or theory is best. 
Thus research papers show us areas of uncertainly…i.e. they show us what would make a good topic for 
further research and for our research papers.
Thus instead of first defining the title of your paper and then finding appropriate research papers you 
must first find research papers and use these to define the title of your paper. However as there are tens 
of thousands of recent research papers we can’t look at all of these to determine appropriate research so 
we must have a starting point, i.e. a topic of interest to us.
Therefore to find appropriate research papers for the paper you are writing you should follow the 
following process:-
1)	 Determine a research topic that is of interest to you.
2)	 Find a few research papers on one focussed sub-topic within this general topic (finding these 
research papers is evidence that researchers are working in this area – so you have found a 
valid topic).
3)	 Use these papers to define the title for your research paper.
4)	 Find as many additional research papers for your paper as you require.

Finding Research Papers 
We have therefore an unusual starting point…we must find research papers before we define the title 
of our research paper.
Finding these papers will show that our paper is on an appropriate topic because a) it is looking at one 
boundary of human knowledge b) the topic is current and researchers are working on this problem.
Of course the topic of your paper may be previously defined because you are doing a precisely specified 
assignment. In this case you do not need to be concerned whether the topic is appropriate or not and 
you can therefore start with step 4 above. You will still need to learn how to find a cohesive set of papers 
on this topic and hopefully this chapter will help you with this.
3.2	
Choosing a General Topic for your Research Paper
Assuming you can specify the title of your research paper you must somehow start by defining the general 
subject area or topic of interest. This will help to narrow the starting point for your initial literature 
search…though this is only a starting point and we may change our focus as we search for papers. 
Appendix 2, at the end of this book, contains a list of general subjects. Within each of these general 
subjects is a list of narrower subject areas that researchers are working in. 
If you have a choice of topic then you can look at these subject areas and pick a subject that is of interest 
to you. 
Under each of these topics are some suggested key words that you can use when searching for research 
papers though you can also make up your own search terms by either using words from the subject titles 
or from the short descriptions provided.
For example one sub topic within ‘Computing’ is ‘Artificial Intelligence’ and one of the search terms 
listed in appendix 2 within this is ‘Vision Recognition’ You can start your search using this search term 
or make up your own alternatives e.g. robotic vision, computer visions systems, neural networks for 
computer vision etc.
Of course the list of topics is not comprehensive and may not cover specific subjects you are interested 
in but hopefully it will give you some ideas for potential research papers.
The list of sub topics and search terms is certainly not comprehensive and you may need to consider 
your own starting point.

Activity 3
Consider the following book:-
Economics for Students and Non-Students Alike by Jerry Wyant, 2013. 
It contains chapters on market structures, market failures, economic systems, and the business cycle, unemployment 
and inflation.
Within the chapter on market failures it may discuss stock market crashes. Within the chapter on the business cycles it may 
discuss functions in currency values e.g. the ratio between the values of the pound sterling and the American dollar etc.
Within the subject of economics there are lots of things that are well known and lots of things that we do not fully 
understand i.e. areas on which we could write a research paper.
Given this consider the following potential subjects for research and decide which of these would make the most 
appropriate topic for a research paper:-
a.	
Economics
b.	
Business Cycles
c.	
Currency Fluctuations
d.	
The Impact of Quantitative Easing 
e.	
Using new computing techniques, e.g. Neural Networks, to improve prediction accuracy of currency values.

The purpose of this exercise is not really to worry about what makes and appropriate topic for our research paper but 
to understand that research needs to be done on one very focussed subject and this has an impact when we start 
searching for research papers.
Topics (a)–(c) are too big and too unfocussed for one person to succeed at. 
No one can research ‘Economics’ in general or indeed on ‘Business Cycles’ or ‘Currency fluctuations’. These topics are far 
too wide and are made up of far too many unknowns to be the subject of one persons research. 
Topic (d) ‘The Impact of Quantitative Easing’ is a much more focussed topic and could possibly be the subject of a 
significant research study, possibly leading to a PhD over three years, but even within this you will find it contains many 
smaller, more focussed, subject areas and thus is still probably too wide and too big for a single research paper.
A far more reasonable topic for an individual research paper could therefore be one focussed aspect of this, perhaps 
‘The Impact of Quantitative Easing on Currency Exchange Rates’.
Topic (e) ‘Using Neural Networks, to improve prediction accuracy of currency values’ is a very narrow topic and one that 
is far more likely to succeed as the subject of a research paper.
From the exercise above you may see that one essential feature for successful research is to ensure that 
the research has a very narrowly focused and clearly defined goal.
For now it is enough to note that you can do research on any subject that is of interest to you as long 
as this subject a) has a very narrow focus and b) is a subject that other researchers consider as current. 
Books can help you choose a topic but don’t look at the title of the book. Don’t even consider the titles 
of chapters within the book but consider one topic within one chapter of a book.
Once you have narrowed your focus on one small subject area, e.g. ‘currency values’, then you can use 
terms from this topic to start your search process.
Activity 4
Take any text book you have. 
Ignore any general introductory chapters and pick a chapter that seems to be generally focused on one subject area.
Scan the introduction to this chapter and look at the subsection headings. Try to find one on a clearly focussed topic.
Now look at this topic and pick out the key words that you think highlight what the topic is about.

One of the books I own is about ethical issues in computing, one chapter of which is about things that can go wrong 
with software. Within this is a section on ‘Safety-Critical applications’ including air traffic control problems and radiation 
overdoses in medical computing devices. 
From this I could pick any of the following potential terms when searching for research papers in computing: ‘fly-by-wire 
systems’, ‘automated aircraft control’, ‘computerizing pilot functions’, ‘traffic collision avoidance systems’ or on the medical 
side ‘error message design’. ‘medical software specifications’ and ‘errors in multitasking software’. 
Of course there are also many other topics I could choose…all inspired by the same book.
Clearly we can follow this process using any textbook we like and pick any subject we like for our 
research…though we will need to confirm that other researchers are working in this area.
Picking one of these search terms is not the end it just gets us started when looking for research papers. 
We will refine our search terms later and the papers we find will lead us to define a precise topic for 
our paper. 
Given this it doesn’t matter which terms we pick at the start and we can’t get this wrong.
Having considered a starting point for our research, i.e. the search term we will start with, we will 
now consider:- 
•	 What tools can we use to find research papers?
•	 How do we use these tools? 
•	 and how do we refine our search terms to find a cohesive set of papers on a current and valid 
research topic?
3.3	
Tools for Finding Research Papers
There are numerous potential tools you can use to help you find research papers. These tools are sometimes 
called ‘Resource Discovery Services’. 
Each of these tools has their own advantages but which you will use will often be determined by pragmatic 
considerations:- for example whatever tool your university subscribes to.
This chapter will introduce you to the EBSCO Discovery Service but will then focus on two tools that 
are free and available for your use:-
•	 IEEE Xplore
•	 Google Scholar

3.3.1	
EBSCO Discovery Service
The EBSCO Discovery Service is a professional resource discovery service that provides sophisticated 
search tools and is an excellent resource for finding research papers. It can be branded by different 
institutions so it may not look the same in every institution that uses it but the features provided in 
those institutions are probably fairly similar. 
When using this tool multiple online Databases are searched automatically and many research papers 
can be found and downloaded to your computer in minutes. You can search for papers on a particular 
topic or for papers with keywords in the title and you can sort the results by relevance or date i.e. those 
the computer thinks are most relevant to you or those that are most recent.
You can refine you search by limiting the search to ‘Full Text’ and ‘Academic Journals’:-
 
 
…and when the search is finished a list of retrieved papers will automatically be presented to you.

…and if your institution has access to that source then you can download a full copy of the paper 
immediately.
The system can also look at the full list of papers retrieved by your search and can intelligently categorise 
them into sub topics. You can then use this list to narrow down your search terms:-
If your institution has provided a particular resource discovery service, such as the EBSCO Discovery 
Service, then this maybe the best tool available to you but there are other options including:-.
•	 IEEE Xplore
•	 Google Scholar
3.3.2	
IEEE Xplore
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, commonly known as the IEEE, was founded as 
the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1884 but merged with another organisation and was 
renamed in 1963. 
The IEEE is a very well respected professional institution that supports research conferences and prints 
journals on whole range of technological subjects including aerospace, communications and computing 
(both hardware and software). 
Additionally other subjects are included that you may not consider as technology such as business, 
economics, criminology and sport. 
While still technology oriented many of the subjects covered include human related aspects of technology 
such as human computer interfaces and medical diagnosis.

Finding Research Papers 
Using the IEEE search engine ‘IEEE Xplore’ you can gain access to over 3 million full text articles many 
of which are quality research papers published in journals or research conferences.
While most of the research papers are only accessible via a paid subscription, you may have access to 
these via a University library. Additionally some research papers are available for free and search results 
can be limited to these open access papers.
3.3.3	
Google Scholar
Google Scholar is a free to use web based search engine. Unlike IEEE Xplore it is not limited to papers 
published by the IEEE but includes a massive range of online journals. This is both an advantage and 
a disadvantage. The advantage is obvious…we have access to far more good quality research papers 
published by a whole range of organisations. The disadvantage is that not all of these are not great quality 
papers and we do need to identify those published in referred journals or conferences i.e. the papers 
that have been quality checked and published by a reputable organisation.
The size of the database Google Scholar uses is not published but it could potentially index over over 
100 million articles…which is of course massive!
For our purposes, finding quality research papers, it does have some limitations when compared with 
IEEE Xplore:-
•	 It will also find print based materials, books and other materials we are not interested in…
though there is a way to exclude some of these from the search results.
•	 There is no easy way to exclude materials you will need to pay for or access via a library i.e. 
we cannot limited our search results to open access research papers.
Given this we do need to go through the search results to find the free to access research papers – this 
is not hard to do but it is a manual process.
Despite these limitations Google Scholar is a very useful tool that can help us find many open access 
research papers.

Learning How to Find Research Papers
Finding research papers is not quite as simple as just typing into a computer a few search terms. We 
also need to consider how to:-
•	 refine our search terms
•	 obtain a cohesive set of papers that are appropriate to our topic,
•	 refine the title of our paper given the specific papers we find and
•	 deal with papers that are not quite as relevant as others.
But the starting point is how we use the tools to obtain papers in the first place.
3.4.1	
Using IEEE Xplore
IEEE Xplore may be of use to you for several reasons:-
•	 It provides access to over 3 million articles most of which are good quality research papers.
•	 You may be lucky enough to study at an institution that subscribes to these so all of these are 
free for you.
•	 Alternatively at least some are free.
For this reasons we will now learn the basics of using this tool now.

Feedback 7
Google Scholar will find a huge range of resources and some are immediately accessible…others are freely accessible 
if you dig a little deeper.
This video also highlights an essential skill:-
It is critical you read the abstract, conclusions and discussion to determine how relevant a research paper is before 
trying the read the body of the paper. 
The body of the paper is often complex and presents a detailed and technical discussion of the research conducted. 
Eventually reading the main body is important as this will allow you to critically evaluate the science but there is no 
need to do this unless the paper is very relevant to your needs.

We are not interested in books so ignore any item tagged with [BOOK].
Items tagged [CITATION] are not full articles but are references to books or research papers. 
If you see a citation then clicking on this link will provide you with some details of that article concerned and also links 
to other more recent articles that have cited, or used, this article. 
In some cases PDF links are available to open access versions of these other more recent articles. 
When I preformed this search I found a citation to a research paper “Reasoning Foundations of Medical Diagnosis 
Symbolic logic, probability, and value theory aid our understanding of how physicians reason”. You can find this yourself 
by doing a search for papers with these words in the title. 
Along with details of this paper were details of other papers that had cited this paper (see image below). 
Of these 2 out of the first 3 PDF links gave me access to the full text or more recent papers that had cited this source. 
By following links like these you can therefore find several related papers that describe research progressing on earlier 
work done by other researchers.
Clicking on the [PDF] link from the main search page in Google Scholar will also give you access to full research papers.

How to Find a Coherent Set of Research Papers
By now, hopefully, you will feel confident that you can retrieve full copies of research papers via both 
Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. However in order to obtain an appropriate set of research papers to 
meet your needs you also need to learn how to:-
•	 focus and adapt your search to obtain a cohesive set of papers,
•	 define an appropriate research paper title and
•	 refine your specific title to match the set of research papers you are using.
Developing these skills is the aim of the remaining part of this chapter.
Narrowing our search results…
Searching for conference or journal papers on ‘medical diagnosis’ using IEEE Xplore finds over 17,000 
results and Google Scholar finds many, many more papers. So of course we need to refine our search.
There are two ways we can narrow this down immediately:-
a)	 specifying a date range to ensure we get only recent publications
b)	 look for articles with the words ‘medical diagnosis’ in the actual title. 
Narrowing our search results in this way may well improve the search results by making them more 
relevant overall but does run the risk of excluding some useful material.
Of course if our original search terms are too stringent we may not get enough research papers and we 
may need to widen our search.
But what if you are not using the correct terms in the first place? Sometime we may need to use alternative 
terms altogether i.e. take a complete step in another direction.
So searching become a process of fishing…sometime narrowing our search, sometimes widening our 
search and sometimes stepping to one side.
Though search tools are a big help searching is not a simple process.
So having learnt to do a basic search and download the full text of papers we now need to learn how to 
refine our search terms and focus our research. 
When searching for research papers it is usually a process of starting with a general idea and keep refining 
the search until you find a group of papers on one focussed and coherent topic that is of interest to you.

Finding Research Papers 
Activity 13
To develop your searching skills we will presume you are planning to write a paper on ‘computer systems used for vision 
recognition tasks’.
1.	
Using either IEEE Xplore or Google Scholar or using both, do a search for Journal papers with ‘Vision Recognition’ 
in the title. 
This should result in a wide set of papers.
Research papers are written for professionals and other researchers working in that field so many of the papers 
are complex – even the titles are complex – so don’t worry if the titles look scary.
Some of these papers may be unique and these will not easily be related to others but mostly you will find 
several papers that discuss related topics. 
Not all of these will be related to computer systems used for vision recognition tasks. Some of these will be about 
human vision problems and these papers are probably not relevant to computing researchers.
2.	
Now look at the titles of the first 50 papers returned and, without worrying about any title that it totally 
confusing, try to categorise the papers by identifying those papers that are on related subjects. 
You can either decide for yourself what the appropriate categories are or you can decide which papers fit into 
the categories below:-
a.	
Object recognition (varying objects)
b.	
Pattern recognition
c.	
Dynamic or real time vision recognition
d.	
Vehicle or road recognition systems
e.	
Robotic or machine vision 
f.	
Text or handwriting recognition
g.	
Human or face recognition
h.	
Human gesture recognition
i.	
Accuracy of vision systems
j.	
Human vision, peripheral or medical problems 
(these papers are probably not relevant to computing researchers).
k.	
Something else/no idea what this is about (probably lots of these)
Feedback 13
Hopefully you will recognise that many of the papers are on related subjects and more importantly several papers are 
about the same subject.
If you are to write about a cohesive topic it is important to be able to identify related research papers…obviously this 
is not easy if the topic is not familiar to you.
You may have noticed that many of the research papers you found in this exercise talk about Object Recognition, though 
the specific objects vary (face, traffic signs, characters or letters). 
While the different objects vary the theories and methods for object recognition being tested in one paper could be 
compared with the theories tested in another. So papers are sometimes relevant and related even if they appear to be 
about a different topic.

We started this exercise with a very wide subject ‘Vision Recognition’, we then focused ‘Computer vision object 
recognition’ and from this we can see that it is possible to focus our topic even further on any one of the subjects we 
identified from this e.g. pattern recognition. 
However if we look in detail at the titles returned we see that we can focus our search even further perhaps by looking 
at one of the following…
•	
Robotic vision in manufacturing 
•	
Number plate recognition
•	
Facial expression recognition
These are now nicely narrow and focused topics where we should be able to find a clearly cohesive set of research papers.
Of course starting from the very wide subject of vision recognition we could have found many other interesting 
focused topics.
We do need to continue refining our area of interest until we are happy we have found a cohesive 
set of papers on one narrow focused topic.
This is not always a process of defining ever narrower search terms. Sometimes we want to take a side 
step or widen our area of interest.
For example if we decided to look for papers on ‘Robotic vision in manufacturing’ we could consider 
other applications of computer vision in manufacturing and widen our search accordingly. 
Often our original search terms are not the best as we don’t know enough about the subject so we also 
need to look at the titles of the papers we find and look at the terms they use.
Activity 16
Continuing to use IEEE Xplore do a search for papers about ‘Number plate recognition’ we may want to change our 
search terms.

Feedback 16
Looking at the titles of the papers returned you may notice that some are about:-
•	
Using neural networks
•	
Character recognition
•	
Automatic parking 
•	
…lots of others.
If we search for papers with ‘number plate recognition’ and ‘Neural Networks in the title we would find only a very few 
papers but what if we were to widen our search and consider Neural networks used for any vision recognition task – not 
just in number plate recognition?
If we do a search for papers about ‘Neural networks’ and ‘Vision Recognition’ we will find research papers on various 
recognition tasks:- Object recognition, handwriting recognition etc., but all of which use neural networks to perform 
this recognition task.
Searching therefore throws up new terms we may want to consider.
Reviewing our search process we started our search with a very general topic:- ‘Vision Recognition’. 
We then focused our search on ‘computer vision’ and more specifically still on ‘object recognition’. 
We focussed further on ‘Number plate Recognition’. 
We then decided to change direction i.e. we took a step to one side, and considered the application of 
neural network theory. 
At the same time we widened our search and considered the application of neural networks for any 
vision recognition task.
We did not need to stop there. We could have continued and focused on one of these recognition tasks…
perhaps ‘neural networks used for hand writing recognition’.
This process is not finished until we have found a cohesive set of research papers, i.e. journal or 
conference papers, on one narrow subject that we are happy with.
Searching for a cohesive set of research papers on a topic of interest is a process of repeatedly refining 
our search terms:- 
•	 often becoming more specific, 
•	 sometimes using new terms and taking a step to one side, 
•	 and sometimes widening our search by becoming less specific.

Finding Research Papers 
Sometimes the general topic of our research paper will be fixed and this will provide the starting point 
for our search.
Sometimes the choice will be left entirely to you and you can pick a subject of interest to you.
If the choice is entirely open and you don’t know where to start you can consider either picking one 
narrow topic from a text book as a starting point.
You can also consider combining words from two general subject areas, e.g. ‘Information systems’, with 
‘business needs’. This will help you focus your initial search.
3.6	
Choosing a Title for Your Research Paper
It is possible that you will be required to write a research paper for which a title has been specified. In 
which case choosing the title is not an option and this will also constrain the searching process. You will 
still need to perform your own search for appropriate research papers and in doing so you may need to 
identify appropriate sub topics and find a few papers on each of these sub topics.
However if your title is not constrained then you need to choose an appropriate title for yourself.

Finding Research Papers 
As we have seen, given a general starting point, the searching process can lead you onto one of many 
focused subtopics any of which would be appropriate for a research paper.
Thus while you may define the general topic before you start your search you cannot define the precise 
title of your paper until you have found a cohesive and focussed set of research papers. 
The title has to reflect the content of your discussion and analysis and thus reflects the content on the 
papers you use.
As you may have some choice or control over your research paper title we will now consider that makes 
an appropriate title. 
Activity 17
Assuming that having started a search for research papers on computer vision we ended up with a cohesive set of papers 
on ‘Neural Networks used for License Plate Recognition.
We could have found papers with the following titles:- 
•	
“A fuzzy feature extractor neural network and its application in license plate recognition”
•	
“A modular neural network classifier for the recognition of occluded characters in automatic license plate reading”
•	
“A Neural Network Based Artificial Vision System for License Plate Recognition”
But essentially they are all about Neural Networks used for License Plate Recognition.
Remember, as we discovered in chapter 1, when writing a research paper we are not just summarising what we find we 
are trying to push forward the boundaries of human knowledge by presenting our evaluation of this research and our 
analysis, both of these require us to present our conclusions.
Given these research papers and given this is the task we are trying to perform consider the following proposed titles 
for our paper and decide which is the most appropriate:-
a.	
An Introduction to Automatic Number Plate Recognition Systems
b.	
A Technical Explanation of Number Plate Recognition Systems
c.	
A Critical Evaluation of Current Neural Network Theory for Number Plate Recognition Systems
d.	
Current Neural Network Research Aimed at Improving License Plate Recognition Systems

Finding Research Papers 
Feedback 17
The first of these titles is wholly inappropriate – a basic introduction is not appropriate for a research paper. Research 
papers are aimed at professionals who already understand the basics. The reader of your research paper will want to 
know about current research and will also want to read your reasoned argument and analysis leading to your conclusions. 
There should be no introductory material in a research paper.
For a similar reason the second title is also inappropriate. This sounds more like a detailed explanation that would be 
provided to a student wanting to learn how to build such system not a review of current research. 
If you could present a technical, clear and yet detailed explanation of how to write a computer program to recognize 
car number plates it would be impressive work – this is not a simple subject. However while this would be impressive 
and very useful for programmer it would not be a discussion/analysis of current research. It would not describe current 
research, it would not present your evaluation of current research nor would it present your conclusions from having 
evaluated current research. Therefore while this second title would be appropriate for a technical manual it would not 
be appropriate for a research paper.
The third and fourth of these titles are much better. 
The 3rd highlights our role – which is not just to describe current research but also to evaluate this research and to 
report our conclusions. 
The 4th title does not highlight our role but does highlight the fact that our paper will present a review of current research.
Not all titles need to use the word ‘research’ nor do they need to use the words ‘critical evaluation’ but 
the title you choose for your paper should:-
•	 reflect the narrow subject matter and
•	 reflect the purpose which is to present your analysis and evaluation of current research.
3.7	
Choosing a Title for a Dissertation Research Chapter
If you are writing a research chapter as part of a larger dissertation its title should also:-
•	 reflect the subject matter and
•	 reflect the purpose which is to present your analysis and evaluation of the research.
However a research chapter is likely to be much longer than a research paper and therefore while each 
subsection should be equally focussed the overall title maybe more general.
For example the overall title may represent current research on number plate recognition systems with 
sub sections devoted to the application of neural network theories and other competing methods.
While the chapter sub section titles will therefore be equally focussed the overall chapter title will be 
more general.

So far in this chapter we have focused on two Resource Discovery Services that provide access to open 
access research papers, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore, but there are many other Resource Discovery 
Services available and some of these may be more appropriate to your needs.
Many of these specialise in particular subjects such as agriculture, chemistry, economics, education,

The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is one of the resources listed in the Wikipedia article. It does not specialise 
in a subject area so you need to decide for yourself if searching this is better than using Google Scholar…perhaps you 
can use both.
3.9	
Summary
In this chapter we have learnt that research papers often have an unexpected starting point. 
We often don’t start with a title. While we start with a subject or topic – hopefully quite a focussed topic – 
the actual title should be refined to reflect the specific papers we find at the end of the searching process. 
We learnt how to use IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar but we also found that other Resource Discovery 
Services such as the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) exist some of which specialise in different 
subject areas. 
You could be studying at an institution or university which provides a specific resource discovery tool 
that is more appropriate to your needs however IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar are still both useful 
and good alternatives you may want to consider using as well.
We learnt how to find papers using these tools and restrict our searches so that we concentrated on 
finding good quality research papers i.e. those published in journals and research conferences.
We then learnt how to search for a cohesive set of papers, often focussing our search, sometimes taking 
a step to one side and sometimes widening our search. In doing this we used search terms we found 
in the titles of the papers recognising that we may start our search process not knowing what the best 
search terms are.
Finally we considered what makes an appropriate title for a research paper or research chapter…one 
that reflects the research content and one that reflects the purpose of our paper which is to present our 
evaluation, our analysis and our conclusions.
Having learnt how to find a cohesive set of research papers we must learn how to analyse and evaluate 
them but first we must learn how to read them i.e. what we are looking for when we read them. In order 
to learn this it would help if we had some understanding of research methodology and this therefore 
is the subject of the next chapter.

4	 Research Methodology
Introduction
In chapter 1 we learnt that:-
•	 the purpose of research was to push forward the boundaries of knowledge 
•	 knowledge was true justified belief 
From this we learnt a simplified scientific process:-
•	 Observe something that can’t be explained by our current knowledge.
•	 Provide a suggested explanation for this phenomenon…we call this suggested explanation a 
hypothesis.
•	 Test the hypothesis to find out if it is really true. 
We also learnt that to write our own research paper we will be expected to critically evaluate other 
research papers and this requires:- 
•	 an evaluation of research methods, 
•	 evaluating the discussion of results and 
•	 evaluating the conclusions reached. 
All of this requires a deeper understanding of:-
•	 research theory,
•	 how research should be conducted and 
•	 the importance of experiments and experimental design. 
This chapter aims to expand our understanding of research theory and to discuss the basics of experimental 
design. This will enable us to understand more about what we see when we look at research papers.
We will come back and look at the subject of experimental design in more detail later so we can understand 
more about how to critically evaluate research.
For now our purpose is just to ensure we understand enough research theory so we can understand 
what we are looking for when we read research papers.

4.1	
Research…an analogy
Our discussion so far states that the aim of research is to push forward the boundaries of human 
knowledge.
And that to do this we must:-
•	 Observe something that can’t be explained by current knowledge.
•	 Provide a suggested explanation for this…a hypothesis…and
•	 Test the hypothesis to find out if our explanation is really true.
If we are making a contribution to human knowledge it implies we are not working in isolation but are 
basing our work on existing work.
We want to add a piece of knowledge to the existing body of human knowledge.
By analogy we are trying to build a wall. To do this we need to:-
•	 know where to place the next brick. 
•	 and we need to test the brick we are putting in the wall to ensure it is strong enough
Download free eBooks at bookboon.com

How to Write a Research Paper
95 
Research Methodology
Knowing where to place the next brick implies we must first read some research papers. Research papers 
show where the current gaps in our knowledge are.
Ensuring our brick is strong enough, implies we are testing our claims for knowledge, via experimentation 
or other form of proof, to ensure the claims we make are accurate and won’t be disproven by future 
researchers who are building on top of our part of the wall.
We need to do this testing in a rigorous, scientific, professional and competent way…so other researchers 
who are evaluating our research, e.g. others like you who maybe writing a research paper, will recognise 
the validity of our work.
If we don’t conduct our research in a competent way other researchers will identify our mistakes and 
cast doubt on our conclusions. To prevent this we need to follow a sound scientific method.
Either way researchers will evaluate our work and make a contribution to knowledge by confirming the 
validity of our conclusions or by highlighting issues/problems.
4.2	
Scientific Method 
Scientific methods do partly depend upon the discipline or subject area of the researcher thus:-
•	 Researchers working with human blood or human tissues will have certain protocols they must 
follow determined by the requirements of medical ethics. 
•	 Researchers working on archaeological digs will follow certain protocols to uncover and 
catalogue evidence to ensure the evidence is not damaged or inaccurately recorded.
•	 Researchers working in human psychology will have standard methods for collecting subjective 
personal feeling and analysing these with appropriate statistical techniques to ensure the results 
are free from bias.
Whatever the subject area though most research projects in the scientific disciplines follow the same 
set of steps:-
•	 Analyse the problem or observe unexplained phenomena
•	 Find out what current researchers propose by reading the literature
•	 Make a prediction about what will work best or about what will explain previously unexplained 
phenomena (i.e. develop the hypothesis)
•	 Test this hypothesis by either

οο Implementing a solution and testing this solution in the real world.

οο Making a prediction based on the hypothesis and testing this prediction by collecting 
evidence that will prove or disprove the prediction.
οο Provide a mathematical or other formal proof 
•	 On the basis of the test results reach conclusions about the validity or otherwise of the hypothesis 
and make claims accordingly
Testing the hypothesis will often involve:-
•	 performing experiments, 
•	 collecting data from the experiments,
•	 analysing the results and 
•	 drawing conclusions from these results.
4.3	
Scientific Principles
There are two fundamental ways of collecting scientific data:-
•	 pure observation – in a non-invasive way
•	 experiment – introducing changes and observing the effects

Research Methodology
Whether a researcher is performing experiments or collecting data by observation researchers must 
follow basic scientific principles:-
•	 Empirical – evidence is obtained by observation and measurement.
•	 Measurement – we are measuring what is observed in some way and these measurements must 
be accurate made and properly recorded.
•	 Non Invasive – we must ensure that the process of data collection does not impact on the data 
itself. If you monitor staff at work to determine how much time is wasted taking unauthorised 
breaks you can imagine that staff will avoid taking breaks while being watched. The process of 
monitoring the staff is therefore invasive and this will affect the results.
•	 Objectivity – we try to avoid introducing any form of subjective bias as this will invalidate our 
data and results.
•	 Repeatability – we seek to ensure our methods are properly documented so other researchers 
can replicate our experiments and verify our results. 
Thus when you are evaluating research conducted by others you should be asking ‘Have they followed 
these good scientific principles?’ 
If not it will cast doubt on the conclusions those researcher reached. 
4.4	
Controlled Experiments
Researchers like and often conduct controlled experiments as these are relatively easy to perform and 
show that the researcher has sound scientific evidence to support their conclusions. 
A controlled experiment is one where control is maintained over all the variables that could influence 
the results and only one of these variables is altered. Simply put two identical experiments are conducted 
under identical conditions but where one of the conditions or variables, the one being tested, is changed. 
An example would involve using two groups of patients to test a new drug:- a test group and a control 
group. The two groups of patients should be identical…and to ensure this patients should be randomly 
assigned to each group. Both groups must be treated in an identical way with one exception:- the test 
group is given the new drug and the control group is not.
It could be easy to introduce bias into such an experiment. Medical researchers could put the patients 
most likely to improve into the test group…and thus the results would be biased in favour of the new 
drug. The two groups of patients could also have different expectations…if one group knows they have 
been given the drug their expectation, or belief, is that they will improve and this will impact on the 
results they report. If the researchers know which group a patient is in that could also influence the way 
they interact with the patient and thus affect the results.

Research Methodology
To avoid all of these potential sources of bias the concept of a double blind trial was developed. A double 
blind trial is one where both the tester, i.e. the medical researcher, and the subject, i.e. the patient, is 
unaware who is in the control group and who is in the test group. For this to work the patients in the 
control group must be given a placebo i.e. a dummy medicine that has no medical effect. 
For practical or ethical reasons it is not always possible to conduct a controlled experiment. Testing a new 
cars sales strategy under perfectly controlled conditions would require two identical car sales businesses 
or at least two identical departments…selling exactly the same products, working in the same way, with 
the same sort of clientele, under the same economic circumstances and with the same management 
and sales teams. Clearly it is not possible to find two absolutely identical departments. A comparative 
experiment can still be undertaken but the researchers must take care to ensure the uncontrollable 
differences are as small as possible and do not influence the results. 
When evaluating research you cannot jump to the assumption that failure to undertake a controlled 
experiment implies bad research nor can you assume that doing a controlled experiment means the 
research is sound, as bias can still be introduced. Still controlled experiments can provide sound scientific 
evidence for conclusions
4.5	
Empirical Research
Empirical research is research that bases its findings on direct or indirect observation, for example a 
kettle uses electricity to make heat water…but how much electricity does it take to heat the water?
•	 How do we observe or measure the amount of electricity?
•	 How to we measure the change in water temperature?
•	 Will we think to measure the amount of water involved and how will we measure that?
We can of course use an electricity meter, a thermometer and a measuring jug.
We need to be sure the measurements are accurate so we must check any instrumentation involved 
works by calibrating it. 
To ensure the thermometer is working properly we must calibrate this. We know that water boils at 
100 degrees C and water freezes at 0 degree C so we can check our thermometer measures freezing 
water and boiling water accurately and this will give us some reassurance that it works in between these 
temperatures as well.
…Actually at low atmospheric pressures, e.g. on top of a mountain, water boils at lower temperatures 
so we do need to exercise some caution when calibrating equipment.

Research Methodology
When taking measurements direct observation is always desirable but not always possible. Direct 
observation means we can directly measure the things we want to measure i.e. the temperature of the 
water, the water volume and the amount of electricity being used.
However direct observation is not always possible and in these situations we need to take indirect 
measurements. 
Clearly we can’t measure the temperature at the centre of the Sun directly. We can however measure the 
radiation levels coming from the Suns surface and perhaps using these we can determine the temperature 
at the centre.
Indirect measurements are sometime necessary but again we must exercise caution…if we are making 
claims based on the temperature at the centre of the Sun and this is based on indirect measurements 
can we be sure that our assessment of this temperature is accurate?
We also need to be careful if we are relying on human senses. 
Sometimes we do need to rely on human senses e.g. bird watchers look out for unusual birds and this 
data can be useful to predict changes in migration and feeding patterns…and these could be an indication 
of climate change.

Research Methodology
We need to rely on this information as there are many practicing birdwatchers and we can’t put cameras 
everywhere but we must be careful to ensure that the data is not inaccurate. If a novice ornithologist 
cannot recognise the difference between a Peregrine Falcon and a Prairie Falcon they may report 
inaccurate sightings. 
In this situation we could of course wait until the data has been corroborated by other ornithologists.
Rather than rely on human senses where possible it is better to take accurate measurements using 
calibrated equipment.
We could be doing research to see which traffic calming measures are most effective in slowing down 
cars in residential areas…in this case there is clearly no need to rely on human reports of speeding cars. 
We can accurately measure this, using speed cameras, but we still need to ensure that the speed cameras 
are calibrated and working correctly and the data is free from bias. 
If the speed cameras are clearly visible then drivers who are speeding will slow down and the data we 
collect will be biased and will not accurately reflect the normal speed of cars.
Collecting evidence for, or against, any particular theory requires systematic collection of empirical data, 
and academic rigor plays a large part to ensure the research being undertaken is being done properly.
4.6	
Basic Research Criteria
While research will vary depending on the subject or research discipline all research should satisfy 
basic criteria:- 
•	 Purposeful: the research should have a clear goal and the research should be conducted in a 
well defined way to meet this goal.
•	 Rigor: the research should be conducted using a thorough, systematic approach and this 
approach should be critically evaluated to look for potential flaws. 
•	 Testability: remember knowledge is true justified belief so a hypothesis is not just any theory. 
A hypothesis is a theory that can be tested. Thus research means investigating theories that 
can actually be evaluated.
•	 Reproducibility: The research approach and methodology should be clearly documented so 
other researchers can follow the same process to make sure that the results can be reproduced 
with some degree of reliability.
•	 Precision: We must make sure that the measurements are precise as is possible given the 
circumstances and all results. Both negative and positive, should be properly recorded.
•	 Objectivity: we must ensure that we don’t introduce any bias into the investigation.
•	 Confidence: considering the issues of rigor, testability, reproducibility, precision and objectivity 
we are trying to ensure that we can have confidence in the results and that they are meaningful.

Research Methodology
There are two additional criteria researchers should aim to satisfy:-
•	 Generalisability: We want to ensure we get results that have a wider impact than the immediate 
experiment that was carried out. For example we may restrict the fat content in the diet of 
mice to measure the effect this has on them but from this experiment we may want to make 
claims about the diet and associated health benefits on humans but mice are not humans and 
we must be careful to ensure general claims we make are justified by the evidence we have.
•	 Parsimony: Occam’s razor is a philosophical principle that says we should accept the simplest 
hypotheses that explains the facts. Related to this is the research principle of ‘Parsimony’ which 
suggests we should adopt the simplest possible theory with the greatest predictive power. For 
example we may note that among cancer patients there is a greater proportion of smokers than 
in the general population. Two hypotheses that would explain this are a) smoking causes cancer 
or b) cancer patient’s smoke to distract themselves. Of these two potential hypothesis the first 
has a massive predictive power…if this is true then we can reduce cancer and suffering by 
reducing smoking. The second of these hypothesis has less predictive value and is also a more 
complex hypothesis…a) do patients want to be distracted? b) why would smoking distract 
them c) would something else not distract more? The principle of Parsimony suggest we should 
accept the first of these hypothesis as our working hypothesis…it does not suggest we should 
accept this hypothesis as true – we still need to verify this.
All research should satisfy these basic principles but this does not mean all research papers look the 
same. Research papers will vary as the nature of the work they report varies. 
Research can be categorised according to basic groupings:- 
•	 Basic or Applied 
•	 Qualitative or Quantitative 
It is worth understanding these basic types of research as these are reflected in the content of the research 
papers you will need to read.
4.7	
Basic Research vs Applied Research
Basic research does not mean ‘simple’ research. It is sometimes called pure or theoretical research and 
is research that is being done to understand fundamental principles or the phenomena of a subject. It is 
often undertaken without any thought given to the practical application of the theory and is often not 
tested by applying the theory to a problem but tested by developing mathematical proofs.

Applied research on the other hand is very much focussed on solving practical problems or considering 
the practical application of theory. These cannot be studied without considering issues to do with the 
implementation of the theory and are often therefore tested by apply the theory to a specific problem 
or product. Most research is of this type.
Activity 1
Consider the following research problems and categorise them as basic or applied:-
1.	
Understanding the laws of physics that govern the behaviour of black holes.

Developing new materials, stronger and lighter, to make cheaper rockets that can transport humans to the moon. 
3.

Research Methodology
Feedback 1
1.	
Understanding the laws of physics that govern the behaviour of black holes.
This is basic or fundamental research. It is considering the fundamental laws of the Universe and there is no 
thought given to any practical application of any knowledge gained from such research…but who knows what 
may come from enhancing our understanding of these laws. Perhaps one day we will find out that time travel 
is possible!
In this research our hypothesis would probably come in the form of a mathematical model describing our theory 
to explain the way a black hole works. But a hypothesis is a testable theory and clearly we cannot test any theory 
by dropping a probe into a nearby black hole to measure what happens at the centre…thankfully none are close 
enough but also a probe would not be able to send any data back out. 
While we cannot test any hypothesis by measuring what happens at the centre of a black hole we could measure 
what goes on near the periphery but if it was the data coming from the periphery that led to the development 
of the model in the first place then we must find some other way to prove our model is correct. 
Mathematical contradictions would prove our model was flawed but failing to find any mathematical contradictions 
would not be sufficient proof. Another test would be to make predictions based on the mathematical model 
and test these predictions in a lab. 
The following link describes how the Higgs Boson particle, sometimes referred to as the God particle, was 
predicted to exist in 1964 but was not until 2012 that the particle was actually observed to exist in CERN…a 
fairly large and impressive lab.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson
2.	
Developing new materials, stronger and lighter, to make cheaper rockets that can transport humans to the moon. 
This is applied research. It has a clear practical and useful goal but also needs to be tested by practical application 
e.g. build components with the new materials and test them for durability, heat resistance etc when compared 
with components developed with the older materials.
3.	
Understanding human perception of business confidence
While this may not be research that is aimed at understanding fundamental laws of physics it could be research 
that aims to understand fundamental principles of human perception or fundamental aspects of human 
psychology that affect our feelings of confidence. Thus this could be basic research but we could also consider 
the practical application of this knowledge.
Basic research may consider the biology of the brain, the mechanisms for perception or the psychology of feelings. 
Theories regarding these maybe tested in a medical lab using neurological scanning and other appropriate 
devices, or tested by developing models of psychology, making predictions based on these models and testing 
these predictions.
Alternatively applied research may consider the practical issues that impact upon business confidence with a 
view to increasing confidence and hence investment and hence jobs. Theories could be tested by developing 
models of business confidence and testing the accuracy of such models when faced with real world scenarios.

Qualitative vs Quantitative Research
We can also categorise research as Qualitative or Quantitative.
Quantitative research is where we can take numerical measurements i.e. do experiments that involve 
making clear measurements and where we can gather numerical data and process the results numerically.
For example: we could undertake research to develop more fuel efficient car engines and we can take 
clear measurements to assess efficiency e.g. we can measure the distance a car can travel at a specified 
speed for a given quantity of fuel.
Qualitative research is where there are no clear measurements or numbers. Here we may need to develop 
scales and collect large quantities of data to ensure we have valid data.
For example: if we are to undertake research to develop more comfortable car seats we cannot clearly 
measure comfort. For this we would need to develop a suitable scale (1 – Very Uncomfortable, 
2 – Uncomfortable, 3 – Neutral, 4 – Comfortable, 5 – Very Comfortable) and get the perceptions of 
numerous people, testing seats in numerous shapes made from a range of materials etc to determine 
what makes a comfortable seat. 
As people perceptions differ we would need to gather data from enough people to gather a realistic view 
of a population. We would also need to repeat this data collection with different groups, male adults, 
female adult and children, as different body shapes will lead to different results. We may also need to 
consider different races and cultures as cultural expectations may impact on perceptions of comfort.
4.9	
Project Types
As well as Basic or Applied/Qualitative or Quantitative research can also be loosely categorised depending 
upon the way a research project is conducted:-
•	 Theoretical or Basic Research
•	 Experimental Research
•	 Survey Based Research
•	 Action Based Research
•	 Strategy Based Research
Though these are general categories and some projects may combine features from more than one of 
these types.
The practical work conducted will be reported in the research papers you will read and understanding 
a little research theory here may help you to understand these papers better.

Research Methodology
4.9.1	
Theoretical or Basic Research
Research papers that describe theoretical or basic research will usually describe:-
•	 relevant concepts with suitable examples, 
•	 the making and testing of conjectures, 
•	 the development of theorems and proofs, where appropriate, and 
•	 consideration, where possible, to the application of the theory to practical problems.
These papers will rarely describe any practical implementation of the theory.
As a hypothesis is often tested by mathematical proof or the testing of a mathematical model these 
papers can be very mathematical and very difficult to understand for researchers without sufficient 
mathematical/logic knowledge.
4.9.2	
Experimental Research
Experimental research projects involve the investigation and evaluation of a specific technology.
This may involve the development or implementation of a substantial test product and the application 
of scientific measurements to ascertain its properties and usefulness.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Research Methodology
Reports on such projects will describe:-
•	 the theoretical foundations (taken from the literature), 
•	 a discussion of the problems of existing methods and how the new ideas may overcome 
these problems,
•	 a description of the implementation and the experimental procedures used,
•	 evaluation of the implementation and
•	 an analysis of the results
4.9.3	
Survey Based Research
Some projects in less technical domains may be survey based e.g. a survey of organisations or people.
Reports on this research would include information on:-
•	 The design of the survey
•	 The survey sample (usually quite large)
•	 The data collection and
•	 Statistical analysis of this
4.9.4	
Action Research
Action research projects involve studying an organisation or populations and are used to investigate 
a phenomena which is not fully understood. The purpose is to study the organisation and implement 
some action, i.e. to make a change, and observe results.
The benefit from this will be a deeper understanding about an organisation and insight about the impact 
of the change.
Research papers that describe this sort of research will often include information on:-
•	 A case study of one organisation
•	 A set of interventions and observations about their impact
•	 An analysis of these and the conclusions coming from this.

Strategy Research
In domains like management another type of project can typically be found that involves the development 
of strategies. The typical key components of such projects are:-
•	 Development of a case study of the target organisation
•	 Identification of requirements and needs of the organisation
•	 Development of a strategy
•	 Critical evaluation of the strategy
Ideally the effects of the strategy would be assessed by:-
•	 Determining key performance indicators 
•	 Collecting data before any intervention
•	 Collecting data after the intervention
though timescales may not permit this in practice.
4.10	
Alternatives to Laboratory Based Experiments
Our scientific method involves:-
•	 Analyse the problem or observe unexplained phenomena
•	 Find out what current researchers propose by reading the literature
•	 Determine our hypothesis
•	 Test this hypothesis
And we can see from looking at the different types of research project that testing the hypotheses 
can involve:-
•	 Implementing a solution and testing this solution.
•	 Making a prediction based on the hypothesis and testing this prediction by collecting evidence 
that will prove or disprove the prediction.
•	 Provide a mathematical or other formal proof 
And testing the hypothesis will often involve:-
•	 performing experiments, 
•	 collecting data from the experiments,
•	 analysing the results and 
•	 drawing conclusions from these results.

a.	
Theoretical or Basic research is often tested by providing a mathematical proof. We will discuss this further in 
the next section.
b.	
Experimental Research which may involve testing a product or technology could be done in two ways. A 
controlled experiment in a lab can test the item under controlled conditions to allow comparison with older 
products/technologies. Alternatively performing the testing in real world conditions will allow the performance 
of the item to be assessed when under real world conditions.
c.	
Survey Based research involves statistical analysis of large data sets but care must be taken to ensure the analysis 
does not lead to false conclusions.
d.	
Action Based research involves implementing a change within one organisation and measuring the impact of 
this change. This is a real world test but it is difficult to control this test and care must be taken to ensure that 
other changes that have occurred naturally during this time do not have a spurious effect on the results.
e.	
Strategy Based research will ideally involve a real world test:- implementing the strategy, at least within 1 part 
of the organisation, and measuring the impact of this. As with action based research we must be sure that 
other natural changes occurring over the same time period do not cause spurious results. If it is not possible to 
implement the strategy it is still possible to assess the potential impact of this by doing a cost/benefit analysis 
or some other analysis but we must take care to ensure that this assessment is reliable.
You may see from this that testing our hypothesis can involve a range of activities, not just laboratory 
based activities, and these activities can be complex and error prone. It is for this reason we cannot trust 
conclusions other researchers reach but we must evaluate the methodologies the researchers followed 
and we will come back to this important subject in more detail later.
For now we will just consider two final but important scientific principles:-
•	 Data used to generate a hypothesis cannot be used to test the hypothesis
•	 We should also test the Null Hypothesis.
4.11	
Data used to Generate a Hypothesis Cannot be Used to Verify the Hypothesis
Fundamental research that was done in the 1960s that led to the detection of the Higgs Boson particle 
in 2012, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson for details of this. 
This research exemplifies the application of a very important scientific principle:- 
Data, or unexplained phenomena, used to generate a hypothesis 
cannot be used to verify the hypothesis
In this research previously unexplained phenomena within the field of physics led to a proposed model 
for physics called the Higgs field.
Mathematical contradictions in the proposed scientific model would have led to its rejection but no such 
contradictions were found. Indeed the proposed model explained several long standing and previously 
unexplainable phenomena. 
However while the model explained the observed phenomena this was not taken as proof the model 
was valid.

Research Methodology
As the model was specifically developed to explain the observed phenomena it is of course not surprising 
that these observations do not contradict the model proposed. Some other evidence was needed to prove 
the model was accurate. Based on the model the researchers predicted the existence of the Higgs Boson 
particle – when this was found 50 years later this was accepted as sufficient verification of the hypothesis. 
It is easy to forget this important principle reach flawed conclusions and present these as valid research. 
Imagine the following scenario:-
A survey is conducted of a significant number of people. Everything about their life style is measured 
(what they eat, what they wear, what they use and what they do) and this is compared against the illnesses 
they have, their educational results and their employment prospects. If we take this large amount of data, 
correlating everything measured against everything else measured, we will probably find two things that 
seem to be highly related. 
Purely by chance we will probably find something…perhaps the people born on Monday were promoted 
quicker…perhaps people who use blue ink in pens get more colds or flu-like symptoms. A statistician 
looking at all of this data would understand that random chance will make something seem to be related 
to something else and this is not statistically significant. 
Still a poor researcher could reach the conclusions that the use of blue ink is related to suffering from 
flu-like symptoms and reach a hypothesis that some chemical in the ink is responsible. They could then 
present this data to ‘prove’ this hypothesis is valid…worse still if they fail to report all of the other data 
collected they could make this look statistically significant.
But remember:-
Data, or unexplained phenomena, used to generate a hypothesis  
cannot be used to verify the hypothesis
If we reach the hypothesis that a chemical in blue ink leads to flu-like symptoms then we need to find 
some alternative data to prove this. This would be easy to do. Find an entirely different group of people 
and conduct a survey to look specifically at this issue – and of course if we did this we would find no 
relationship exists i.e. the use of blue ink does not cause flu-like symptoms.
But how often do we see research reported in the press along the lines of a survey showed that X causes Y?
…and the data shows a strong correlation!
Bad science is easy to do and easy to report. Hence why we need to understand the scientific principles 
and evaluate the way the research was conducted for ourselves.

Testing the Null Hypothesis
Another scientific principle involves something simple but rather grandly called the Null Hypothesis. 
The Null Hypothesis is the opposite of our hypothesis.
In essence rather than looking for positive affirmation it is often better to try and disprove our hypothesis…
failure to disprove the theory often provides stronger evidence that the theory is true.
We call this testing the Null Hypothesis.
Activity 3
Follow the link below and watch the YouTube video ‘Can you solve this?’ (5mins)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKA4w2O61Xo
This provides an excellent example of why we should test the Null Hypothesis.
Feedback 3
Rather than trying to prove our hypothesis we often get stronger evidence by trying hard to disprove it and failing to do so.

Research Methodology
Let’s take a simple example…If a car designer wishes to prove the car design is secure the best proof is 
to try and actively prove it is not secure (the Null hypothesis). If the car designer recruits experienced 
and very able car thieves and if they can’t break into the car then this provides strong evidence that the 
car is secure. 
Trying, yet failing, to prove the Null Hypothesis gives us stronger evidence that the Hypothesis is valid.
In a research setting imagine we notice that some well paid staff seem really keen on their jobs and 
some poorly paid staff seem to have low levels of motivation and from this observation we develop the 
hypothesis that staff pay affects staff motivation levels. Thus if we want well motivated staff we need to 
pay them all well.
But were the staff motivated by their pay or were they already motivated and because they were motivated 
staff who worked hard they were promoted and became well paid? In other words did the pay cause the 
staff to be well motivated or did the fact that the staff were well motivated cause then to earn higher 
rates of pay?
We could try to prove that pay affects motivation levels and in doing so we would indeed find evidence 
that some well paid staff are well motivated but this is weak evidence. Surely we could also find some 
well paid staff who are not well motived?
The Null Hypothesis, i.e. the opposite hypothesis, is that pay levels do not affect staff motivation levels. 
Trying to prove this may help us to prove our hypothesis. 
We could try to prove that pay does not affect motivation levels by taking a range of staff working in 
comparable jobs where the only difference is rate of pay and measure their motivation levels.
For example take two groups of teachers working in similar schools, teaching the same subjects with 
the same class sizes and same resources…but where one group is better paid. Repeat the experiment for 
other groups of staff – factory workers, bus drivers, etc.
Remember we are trying to prove that the difference in pay rate is not affecting the levels of motivation. 
If however our results show that the Null Hypothesis is false then we have strong evidence that the 
hypothesis is true…i.e. pay does affect motivation levels.
Rather than looking for a few positive examples, that pay affects motivation, we are looking for examples 
where pay does not affect motivation. If we can’t find any examples where pay does not affect motivation 
then we have much stronger evidence that pay does affect motivation.
Failure to disprove the Null Hypothesis therefore gives us stronger evidence that the hypothesis is valid.

In this chapter we have looked at scientific principles and a little into how research is conducted for 
two reasons:-
•	 Understanding this will help us to understand what we see in research papers and
•	 Understanding this will help us to evaluate the research for ourselves.
The following exercise will help you to test your understanding of the concepts covered here.

Flawed Research 
While all research should satisfy basic scientific criteria some does not and there can be several reasons 
for this:-
•	 Intentional errors caused by biased researchers who may be funded by a particular interest group, 
•	 Unintentional errors in the research design leading to the introduction of bias,
•	 Errors in the execution of research e.g. uncalibrated equipment, errors in recording etc. 
•	 Errors caused by the flawed use of indirect observation
•	 Errors in the analysis of results and 
•	 Errors in the conclusions reached.
…for this reason it is important that other researchers, i.e. you, evaluate the research to confirm its 
validity and we will consider how to do this later in this book.

Summary
In this chapter we have learnt basic scientific principles and concepts.
We have learnt that there are two fundamental ways of collecting scientific data:-
•	 pure observation – in a non-invasive way
•	 experiment – introducing changes and observing the effects
But no matter how we do this we must follow basic scientific principles:-
•	 Empirical 
•	 Measurement 
•	 Non Invasive 
•	 Objectivity 
•	 Repeatability 
We have learnt that a hypothesis can be tested by:-
•	 Conducting a controlled experiment.
•	 Implementing a solution and testing this solution.
•	 Making a prediction based on the hypothesis and testing this prediction by collecting evidence 
that will prove or disprove the prediction.
•	 Provide a mathematical or other formal proof 
We have loosely categorised research projects as:-
•	 Theoretical or Basic Research
•	 Experimental Research
•	 Survey Based Research
•	 Action Based Research
•	 Strategy Based Research
And we have looked at two important principles:-
•	 Data, or unexplained phenomena, used to generate a hypothesis cannot be used to verify the 
hypothesis.
•	 Testing the Null Hypothesis often provides stronger evidence than by testing the hypothesis.

Research Methodology
Finally we have seen that research can be flawed and thus we need to evaluate the research…
•	 Double blind trials should be used where appropriate to avoid the introduction of bias. 
•	 In comparative experiments researchers must take care to ensure the uncontrollable differences 
are as small as possible and do not influence the results.
•	 Direct measurements are not always possible but indirect measurements must be used 
with caution.
•	 Data collection and recording must be accurate
Flawed research and the process of evaluation is a topic we will return to.

5	 Analysing the Contents of a 
Research Paper
Introduction
Before you can develop the skills needed to analyse and evaluate research papers you need to understand 
the structure and contents of research papers thus in this chapter you will be looking at real research 
papers – but you won’t be asked to read them word by word.
You will also learn that some research papers are different and not really appropriate for your needs. 
Learning how to spot these quickly will allow you to bin inappropriate research papers and replace them 
with alternatives and this will improve the quality of your literature search and thus improve the quality 
of your research paper.
In order to develop these skills this chapter includes direct links to research papers. These should either 
open up within a web browser or directly download a research paper as a pdf file. If a link does not 
open the paper it may be because of your browser security settings in which case you can try copying 
the link into a different browser.
In a worst case scenario a university librarian will be able to obtain a printed version of the papers.
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will be able to…
•	 Understand that we are capable of dealing with scary research papers
•	 Understand the structure of a research paper
•	 Identify the hypothesis or theory being tested
•	 Identify the practical work reported
•	 Identify the analysis of results and the claims researchers make
•	 Recognise qualitative and qualitative research in action
•	 Recognise the difference between fundamental or applied research
•	 Classify research as Experimental, Survey based or Action research
•	 Understand the different ways researchers can verify their hypothesis
You will also develop one additional and important skill. You will learn how to quickly spot and identify 
research papers that, while valid and important, are not useful for someone wanting to evaluate research. 
Learning how to spot and reject papers such as these will improve your literature search and thus improve 
your research paper.

Developing these practical skills will help you to understand and evaluate other research papers but 
this requires time and effort and you are therefore encouraged to attempt all of the practical activities 
in this chapter.
This chapter consists of 3 sections:-
1)	 Understanding What a Research Paper Looks Like
2)	 Not All Research Papers Are The Same…
3)	 Summary
5.1	
Understanding What a Research Paper Looks Like
To understand what a research paper looks like we need to look at a few. The papers we will use will be 
on diverse topics but it is unlikely that any of these topics will be familiar to you. 
It is important to remember when looking at these that they were not written for students – they were 
written for other researchers and professional working in the field. They therefore won’t include basic 
introductions or explanations and they won’t define basic terminology. Instead they will use subject 
specific terminology that other professionals working in that field would be expected to understand…
and they will look scary!
But don’t let this worry you or stop you from trying to participate in the activities that follow. 
Without understanding the terminology or the topic it is possible to understand the research undertaken 
and to assess the validity of this work. Though in this chapter we won’t consider issues of evaluation or 
validity we will just focus on understanding what the researcher(s) did.
5.1.1	
Paper 1) Testing Chemical Reactions
Activity 1
In 2014 Tobias Schwabe wrote a research paper entitled:- 
‘An isomeric reaction benchmark set to test if the performance of state-of-the-art density functionals can be regarded 
as independent of the external potential’
This was published in the journal of ‘Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics’, Volume 16 pages 14559–14567. 
The journal of ‘Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics’ is sometimes abbreviated as ‘Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.’ or ‘PCCP’ and 
is published by the Royal Society of Chemistry.
Read the title of this paper, given above, to see if you can understand what this research paper is trying to describe.

Feedback 1
This title is probably scary. It uses lots of technical terminology e.g. ‘isomeric reaction benchmark’ and ‘density 
functionals’ that the writer may expect other professionals to understand but is clearly was not written for students…
and is especially not intended for you if you are not studying advanced chemistry.
But still if we look at this paper a little less deeply and remove the terminology we could see this as…
‘Something to test if something is independent of something else’.
Looking at this we can see that:- 
a.	
this is indeed about research i.e. the researcher is trying to push forward the boundaries of knowledge and 
b.	
they are testing something and this test will probably involve either a controlled laboratory experiment or a real 
world experiment (my guess is that it will not be a real world test as the title does not imply the application 
of the theory).
Hopefully from the exercise above you can see that while research papers are scary and complex we can 
still look at them to consider what research work is being described in the paper and we can then begin 
to consider how the research was conducted and if the researcher’s conclusions are valid.

We developed out understanding of a research methodology in the last chapter and this is summarised as:-
•	 Analyse the problem 
•	 Find out what current researchers propose. 
•	 Develop the hypothesis
•	 Test this hypothesis by either
οο Conducting a controlled experiment.
οο Implementing a solution and testing this solution in the real world.
οο Making a prediction based on the hypothesis and testing this prediction by collecting 
evidence that will prove or disprove the prediction.
οο Provide a mathematical or other formal proof.
•	 Reach conclusions about the validity or otherwise of the hypothesis and make claims accordingly.
We also said that one important scientific principle is that others have enough information to repeat our 
experiments. Therefore research papers should clearly describe:-
•	 The hypothesis or theory being tested,
•	 The details of the tests conducted and the results with enough clarity and detail that others 
can follow and repeat the work.
•	 The results and any analysis/interpretation of these.
•	 The conclusions regarding the validity of the hypothesis.

Download this paper and skim read it to answer the questions below. Don’t worry about any of the detail or terminology 
and don’t try to understand the contents – just try to answer the questions below. 
a.	
Can you find the abstract and do you think this summarises the contents of the whole paper?
b.	
Does the paper describes the problem and the claims made by other researchers?
c.	
What is the hypothesis or the theory being tested?
d.	
Can you identify the practical work done i.e. what tests were conducted and how they were conducted?
e.	
Can you identify the results and any analysis of these?
f.	
Can you identify the claims regarding the validity of the hypothesis?
g.	
Finally can you classify this work as quantitative or qualitative/theoretical or applied?
Remember theoretical research is research that is being done to understand fundamental principles or phenomena. 
Applied research try’s to solve practical problems. Quantitative research is where we can take numerical measurements 
and process the results numerically. Qualitative research is where there are no clear measurements or numbers.

Feedback 2
Many research papers will follow a similar format to this paper though the specific headings will vary and not all papers 
are as clearly structured and well written as this paper is. 
Without worrying about the specifics of the subject you will hopefully have been able to identify different sections of 
the paper and relate these to your understanding of research methodology.
a)	
the abstract 
Research papers start with an abstract that summarises the contents of the entire paper. This is not the same as 
an introduction and we will consider how to write a good abstract later in this book. 
This paper has an abstract directly below the author’s name. The first two sentences of this describe the issue being 
tested i.e. the hypothesis, though the abstract does not make a specific statement whether the hypothesis is that 
functional performance does depend on the elements involved or does not depend on the elements involved.
It is of course necessary for an abstract to drastically summarise and ignore detail but even in the body of the 
paper researchers often don’t make specific statements using the words ‘The hypothesis is…’ No matter how 
this is worded it should be clear what is being tested.
The abstract goes onto summarise, using just a few words:- the experimental work conducted, the effort to 
reduce bias, what the data/results show and in the final sentence one of the conclusions reached from this work.
b)	
the problem and the claims made by other researchers?
The introduction to this paper starts by very briefly explaining two ‘severe and most often discussed’ limitations 
in our knowledge and the importance of overcoming these limitations. It goes on to mention the work of other 
researchers who have evaluated performance issues and developed benchmarks. This section cites numerous 
sources of information…some books that describe the theories and research papers describing the work 
undertaken by other researchers in the field.
c)	
the hypothesis or the theory being tested?
The introduction ends with a description of ‘the present study’ which explains what is being tested, an explanation 
of how this study was conducted and a description of the limitations of the study. This section ends with a couple 
of sentences describing the structure of this paper.
d)	
details of the practical work done i.e. what tests were conducted and how they were conducted?
Section 2 and Section 3 describe the experimental work conducted and the test data used.
e)	
the results and any analysis of these that was done?
Section 4 describes in detail the test results, the statistical analysis of these and explains what the results show. 
One important part of this discussion is the explanation of the use of SCS-MP2 as a ‘reliable theoretical reference 
dataset’ for comparison purposes. This is not quite the same as undertaking fully controlled experiment but 
maybe a suitable alternative given constraints of the subject being studied.
f)	
the claims regarding the validity of the hypothesis?
Ultimately the goal of someone tasked with writing a survey paper is not to evaluate the quality of the 
writing but to evaluate the conclusions, to compare methods and theories and in doing these present 
your own conclusions. 
For now however we are looking at the contents in a very shallow way in order to understand what is 
reported in a good research paper.

Looking at this paper we can see that this paper clearly describes:-
•	 The hypothesis or theory being tested,
•	 The details of the tests conducted and the results with enough clarity and detail that others 
can repeat and evaluate this work. 
•	 The results and the analysis and interpretation of these.
•	 The conclusions reached.
We can also see that the researchers have acknowledged the limitations of the study and identified further 
research that needs to be undertaken.
It is not a problem that the research has limitations. All research is limited by cost/time and data 
considerations…the only concern is do these limitations invalidate the conclusions reached? 
It is extremely rare that research provides a final definitive answer and it can never claim to have answered 
all of the questions on a subject therefore it is good that the researchers have highlighted the limitations 
of this specific study and identified specific issues that further research needs to address.

Paper 2) A Study of Human Dynamics
Wen Dong, Bruno Lepri and Sandy Pentland wrote a paper ‘Tracking Co-evolution of Behavior and 
Relationships with Mobile Phones’ published in April 2012 in volume 17, issue 2 of Tsinghua Science 
and Technology, pages 136–151.
This was a longitudinal study of a population i.e. it was a study conducted over a period of time. The 
purpose of which was to understand and develop models of human interaction in order to predict and 
shape behaviour. 
The full paper can be downloaded from…
http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6180039
Activity 3
In this exercise we are trying to enhance our understanding of the different ways research is conducted and in doing 
so enhance our understanding of what we read in research papers. We are not trying to understand all of the technical 
detail presented in this paper, or indeed any of the technical detail, so again don’t worry about any of the terminology 
or anything you don’t understand. 
Download this paper, skim read it and try to answer the questions below:-
a.	
Can you identify what data was collected and can you classify this as quantitative or qualitative data?
b.	
In section 3 researchers describe a model which they say ‘could capture the co-evolution’ behaviour of the 
population being studied. Consider the very important scientific principle that data used to generate a hypothesis 
cannot be used to verify the hypothesis and consider how they tested this model, see section 4. Did they test 
the accuracy of the model proposed on a different group of people i.e. different data set or did they test this 
model in some different way?
Feedback 3
a.	
This study concerns very human issues of relationships, friendship and happiness. These are not measurable 
quantities and studies in this area often use questionnaires with made up scales to measure these thing e.g. ‘on 
a scale of 1–5 how happy are you?’ This would be qualitative data and is very open to personal interpretation 
and bias – thus large surveys are required to reduce the potential for an individual to bias the results. 
This particular study however is more specifically trying to model human dynamics and interactions that can 
influence issues such as friendship patterns. To do this the researchers collected specific quantifiable mobile 
phone data – the locations individuals visited, number of phone calls made, who was called etc and they also 
collected survey data which included personal information such as information about relationships and about 
political opinions. Thus this study involved both quantitative and qualitative data.
b.	
The researchers reach three major conclusions:- 1) ‘relationships and behaviour co-evolve’ 2) the model they 
developed can capture this and 3) they ‘can predict friendships’. 
They didn’t test the accuracy of the model proposed on a different group of people but then they didn’t make 
specific claims about its accuracy…only that it can work. Though in order to claim the model can work it must 
still be tested in some way. One way of testing a theory or model is to make predictions based on the model or 
theory and then to test the accuracy of the predictions. This is the method employed by these researchers as 
report in section 4.

Analysin g t he Conte nts of  a Resear ch Pape
An interesting question does arrive here though regarding the validity of this work based on the principle that 
the model must be tested on data that was not used to generate the model.
A model could have been developed using just the mobile phone data and then the predictions tested using 
the data collected in the survey. However if the model was developed to take account of both the mobile phone 
data and the survey data then the survey data cannot be used to verify the model. 
If we were to evaluate this paper then we would certainly need to evaluate the scientific method employed 
however our purpose here is not to do this but simply to understand more about the scientific process reported 
in the paper i.e. what sort of data was collected and how the hypothesis was tested.
Activity 4
We have previously described different categories of research, three of which are:-
•	
Experimental research projects which involve the investigation and evaluation of a specific technology, 
•	
Survey Based research projects which present a survey of organisations or people, and 
•	
Action research projects the purpose of which is to study an organisation and implement some action, i.e. to 
make a change, and observe results.
Look again at the same paper used in the previous exercise are try to classify this research according to the categories 
above. Would you classify this as experimental research, survey based research, action research or something that is a 
combination of different elements of these?
Feedback 4
This is clearly in part survey based research but it goes further than that. The researchers do not just analyse the survey 
data to reach conclusions (and then testing these conclusions on a different set of survey data). The researchers have 
developed and tested a computation model of human behaviour. They then evaluate this model by making and testing 
predictions…. This can therefore mostly be classed as an experimental research project.
An action based project would involve implementing some change to observe the impact of this change on the 
organisation or population being studied…for example running events to encourage specific social interactions and 
measuring the effect this has on friendship patterns. 
This was not action based research.
When undertaking action based research the effect of the change would be measured by collecting key performance 
criteria before and after the change, though care would need to be taken to ensure the measured criteria are relevant…
in this case we could perhaps ask the students how many friends they have. 
Care would also need to be taken to ensure no other changes occurring naturally over the period of the project had 
an impact on the measurements. For example changes in the courses or changes in social media could also have an 
impact on student friendships.
The type of data collected and the experimental work undertaken by these researchers was significantly 
different from the work reported in the first paper. The purpose of the research dictated these differences 
but both papers present a clear description of the process followed, the analysis undertaken and the 
conclusions reached. 
Understanding more about the research process will help you to understand the varying contents of the 
researcher papers you read and help you to evaluate the evidence and thus reach your own conclusions.

So far we have looked at an experimental study using quantitative data that investigated the fundamental 
nature of chemical reactions and used a ‘theoretical reference dataset’ in place of a controlled experiment 
to verify the findings. We have also looked at a longitudinal study of human dynamics that tested a model 
of human interaction by making and testing predictions. 
In the following paper a strategy is proposed for integrating renewable energy sources within a 
power grid:-
Samuele Grillo, Mattia Marinelli, Stefano Massucco and Federico Silvestro, 2012, ‘Optimal Management 
Strategy of a Battery-Based Storage System to Improve Renewable Energy Integration in Distribution 
Networks’, IEEE Transactions On Smart Grid, volume 3, no 2, pages 950–958.

Analysin g t he Conte nts of  a Resear ch Pape
In this paper the researchers present a mathematical model for energy storage equipment, i.e. batteries, 
and model the way energy is integrated i.e. sold within a national grid system. This is important research 
that could have a significant environmental impact. The nature of this research makes it difficult to 
understand and evaluate unless you have a sufficient grounding in the mathematics however as we are 
only looking at the research process we do not need to concern ourselves with the mathematics
Activity 5
Download the paper and look at section III, pages 954–956, and see if you can understand the general method they 
have used to verify the model they propose.
Feedback 5
The researchers could have implemented their model and under controlled conditions compared their model with other 
models, either those currently used in industry or those proposed by other researchers. However to really implement 
this model would have required the development of large scale, complex and very expensive electrical equipment. Not 
surprisingly the researchers found a different, and much, much cheaper, way to test their theories.
Instead of creating a physical implementation of their model the researchers developed a computer simulation and 
tested their model in this simulation. To ensure the simulation was as realistic as possible the researchers took real price, 
wind profile and power production data but they still needed to make several assumptions and correctly evaluate the 
economic gain from implementing their model.
Obviously the simulation will not be a perfect representation of the real world and testing a model or theory in a simulator 
is not the same as testing it under real life conditions but in many cases, especially when testing out new ideas, it makes 
far more sense to test ideas under simulated conditions before conducting real world tests.
If you doubt the use of simulation then ask yourself when testing new car brakes would you really like the very first test 
to be a real test under real world conditions? This could be an easy way to kill someone!
Unlike real world conditions, simulated conditions can also easily be replicated and this makes it easy to compare 
alternative theories or methods. However when evaluating research such as this we do need to consider how good 
and realistic the simulation is. Problems with the simulation can cast real doubt over the validity of the conclusions.

Paper 4) An Evolution Study
The final paper that we look at in this section has something different to offer us…
The paper below presents the results of a study of populations and their ability to withstand drastic 
changes in the environment. It could be of significant interest for environmentalists.

Activity 6
Download the paper and, without reading it, notice all of the equations on pages 1144–1148. 
Next look at figure 1, page 1147, and figure 2, page 1148.
Feedback 6
This paper is a little different from the others we have looked at in the way the researchers evaluate their hypothesis.
The researchers develop a mathematic model to show how they believe a population can be resilient to drastic changes 
in the environment. Clearly it is not possible to test this theory out in the real world without having drastic consequences 
on those currently living in the world.
To test this out therefore the researchers mathematically analyse the model, see graphs 1 and 2, and discuss the 
implications of these findings. The researchers go on to discuss the potential for stronger evaluation by comparing 
the results of the model with empirical examples, i.e. make predictions using the model and test the accuracy of these 
predictions, but they have not yet done this.
While doing further evaluation maybe possible and desirable it is not always necessary.
It is difficult to evaluate the researchers findings unless one has sufficient mathematical knowledge however for our 
purposes it is sufficient to note that a mathematical proof is sometimes a better method of evaluation than a real 
world experiment.
Consider a real world experiment to determine the shortest route between city A and city B. A researcher could walk 
along all of the available roads, measuring the distance of each and show that the shorted route is the most direct route. 
Such an experiment would take a considerable amount of time but also is also open to error i.e. but the researcher could 
fail to test the best route or could incorrectly record the distance.
Alternatively a mathematician can prove the shortest distance between any two points is a direct line. Applying this 
mathematical proof to the problem of city A and city B we will know that the shortest route is the most direct route 
without having to walk up and down the roads. This will obviously save time and is applicable to any similar problem 
no matter what two cities are involved but also, importantly, this is less error prone than a real world experiment.
As long as the mathematical proof is valid then this is an excellent way to verify a hypothesis.
We have now looked at several research papers and how they describe evidence to support their 
conclusions. We have seen that this evidence can come in different forms depending upon the nature 
of the research. It can be:- 
•	 A controlled experiment or a comparative study,
•	 Making and testing predictions based on the theory,
•	 Experiments in a simulated environment,
•	 A mathematical proof.
In addition to this, while we have not looked at a paper describing action research, we have discussed 
how such papers could report changes in key performance indicators and relate these changes to the 
action taken.

5.2	
Not All Research Papers Are The Same…
So far we have looked at a range of research papers that all report some form of experimental work, 
results analysis and conclusions (a mathematical proof is still experimental work of a sort). 
All of this work was published in reputable research sources and all of this work can be evaluated and 
therefore the potential exists for you to reach and present your own conclusions and thus make a valid 
contribution to science. 
However not all ‘research papers’ published in reputable sources do this and while some of these are 
valid and published for very good reasons they are not necessarily suitable for you. In this section we 
will therefore briefly look at some unsuitable materials so you can learn to quickly recognise and ignore 
similar papers if you come across them in your literature search.
5.2.1	
Paper 5) A Medical Position Statement 
The paper below presents an important statement that could have serious medical implications i.e. 
could save lives. It was published in the Clinical Journal for Sports Medicine…and remember we are 
looking for reputable research papers published in journals or conferences so this is certainly a paper 
your literature search could throw up.
Kimberly G. Harmon, Jonathan Drezner, Matthew Gammons, Kevin Guskiewicz, Mark Halstead, Stan 
Herring, Jeff Kutcher, Andrea Pana, Margot Putukian, and William Roberts, 2013, ‘American Medical 
Society for Sports Medicine Position Statement: Concussion in Sport’, Clin J Sport Med, 23:1–18.

Feedback 7
As the authors try to make clear from the title this paper does not report primary research. Instead it reports 
recommendations for best practice to be followed by clinicians dealing with concussion and suggests areas where 
more research is needed. 
As you will hopefully have spotted the nature of this article is reflected in its structure as it starts with an executive 
summary rather than an abstract. This is one of the mechanisms used by the authors to make it clear this is not a normal 
research paper.
While this paper does not report primary research it may still make a very valid contribution to society and it is still very 
valid to report recommendations like this in journals. Not only can this shape future research but current clinicians, who 
read journals to keep up to date with evolving theory, can learn from the reported best practice and thus this paper 
can save lives.
However the lesson to be learnt here is that not all articles published in reputable journals report primary research 
and while they still serve valuable and legitimate functions they are not useful to a researcher who wants to evaluate 
current research.
Papers that are not appropriate for our needs can often be dismissed quickly by scanning the contents 
before wasting time reading them carefully.

Paper 6) A Study of Patient-Clinician Communication 
The paper below is another example of a paper that is not appropriate for our needs despite being 
published in a very reputable source.

Activity 8
Download the paper and skim read it and answer the questions below:-
Are the authors presenting research that they have done i.e. are they reporting their own experiments results and 
conclusions?
When it cites other research papers are these mostly in the beginning or are the citation all the way through?
Do the researchers present their own conclusions?
Feedback 8
This paper does not report primary research, experiments and results, undertaken by the authors. Instead it cites and 
discusses research done by numerous other researchers and citations pointing to these papers exist throughout the 
whole paper.
This paper does present conclusions, on the very first page the researchers propose that two models, if integrated, have 
the potential to meet patient’s needs. As such this paper makes a valid contribution to knowledge but these conclusions 
come from reasoned argument and from evaluating the work of all the other researchers. The proposal to combine the 
two models is not yet tested.
In many ways this is a classic survey paper – much like the one you may have to write. It reaches conclusions by evaluating, 
comparing and considering the potential to integrate the work of diverse other researchers. 
All this can be very good and very useful. Papers such as this often help to verify the work of other researchers and suggest 
directions for further research. They are also often useful to give novice researchers an overview and understanding of 
research being conducted around the subject – not by one researcher but by numerous researchers. 
However survey papers are not very useful for other researchers wanting to write their own survey paper for two 
reasons…1) they don’t present sufficient detail of the source materials so you can’t evaluate the evidence for yourself 
2) the survey paper has already compared the other research proposals and reached conclusions based on this – this 
will make it difficult for you to generate your own unprejudiced comparison.

Download the paper and skim read it and answer the questions below:-
Are the authors presenting research that they have done i.e. are they reporting their own experiments results and 
conclusions?
Do the researchers present their own conclusions?
Feedback 9
Much like the two other papers we have looked in this section, this paper does not report primary research. Instead it 
cites and discusses what the authors consider as two prominent trends in recent research literature.
Based on this the authors present an argued principled position and this could usefully influence other researchers and 
professionals working in this area. However as this does not present a description of primary research it is not useful for 
someone wanting to write a survey paper.
While not useful for our purposes all three papers presented here reach argued and potentially useful 
conclusions. All of them were published for good and valid reasons and none of them pretended to 
present a description of primary research.
Still, while they may be very good, they are not really useful for someone wanting to write a survey 
paper and it useful to learn how to recognise these materials quickly. By avoiding them your research 
paper will be stronger and identifying these papers quickly will save you time.
There are other research papers that we may not consider so favourably – where conclusions should 
be justified by more than good arguments. For example some research papers present ‘improved 
management strategies’ where the efficacy of the proposed strategies are completely unverified. These 
strategies may have been developed on the basis of good arguments, and therefore sound plausible, but 
should they really be implemented in an organisation unless they are tested first?
Management strategies can be tested by performing action research within one small department or 
small section of an organisation by collecting performance data, implementing the new strategy and 
measuring the impact of this change. As with all action research we must take care in case other changes 
that occur naturally over the period of the project, e.g. a change in product lines, have an impact on the 
results and thus unduly influence the conclusions. This is one issue to be considered when we evaluate 
such research for now however the lesson is much simpler:- be aware that some research papers present 
claims that are unverified.

Summary
In this chapter we have looked at several research papers and seen how they describe 
•	 The hypothesis or theory being tested,
•	 The details of the tests conducted and the results with enough clarity and detail that others 
can repeat and evaluate this work. 
•	 The results and the analysis and interpretation of these.
•	 The conclusions reached.
We have seen that the research work undertaken being will be dictated by the nature of the hypothesis 
and practical considerations of the project and this will impact on the research process, the data collected 
and the methods used to verify the hypothesis. This will help you to understand the contents of the 
researcher papers you read and help you to evaluate the evidence.

We have seen that evidence presented to support conclusions can come in the form of:-
•	 A controlled experiment/or a comparative study,
•	 Making and testing predictions based on the theory,
•	 Experiments in a simulated environment,
•	 A mathematical or formal proof
In addition to this, while we have not looked at a paper that describes action research, we have discussed 
the potential evidence that could be shown when undertaking this sort of research.
The exercises in this chapter and the feedback provided were intended to help you to develop a deeper 
understanding of the expected structure and content of research papers. 
You will also hopefully have learnt to recognise papers that, while published in reputable research sources, 
don’t for good reason describe primary research (for example a survey paper).
While looking at these papers we have kept in mind our ultimate goal which is to reach our own conclusions 
by evaluating the evidence presented. While we have not yet attempted to do this we have discussed, briefly, 
some of the ways the evidence can be flawed. This is a topic we will return to in more depth.

Experiments
Introduction
In the previous chapter we learnt to identify the different types of work reported in research papers. 
While doing this we kept in mind our goal is to evaluate the evidence presented in these papers in order 
to decide for ourselves if the conclusions presented in these papers are valid.
To decide this we will need to evaluate:- 
•	 the research methods, 
•	 the discussion of results and 
•	 the conclusions reached. 
To help with this we have discussed research theory and we have looked at ways research can be conducted. 
In particular we have discussed:-
•	 Theoretical or Basic Research
•	 Experimental Research
•	 Survey Based Research
•	 Action Based Research
•	 Strategy Based Research
And we have looked at several research papers that show some of these in action.
We have also looked at methods for testing the hypothesis:- 
•	 A controlled experiment or a comparative study,
•	 Making and testing predictions based on the theory,
•	 Experiments in a simulated environment,
•	 A mathematical proof.

of the importance of experiments.
This chapter aims to expand your understanding of experimental design so you are better placed to 
understand how to evaluate the evidence presented in research papers.
We will focus on the act of critical evaluation in the next chapter.

•	 Be able to choose between different types of experiment,
•	 Have considered in detail issues regarding data collection,
•	 Considered how poor design can lead to errors and bias.

6.1	
What Role do Experiments Play in Research?
We have already touched on the idea and role of experiments but experiments are crucial to science so 
we will look at these more closely here. Having a slightly deeper understanding will help you to evaluate 
the evidence presented in research papers.
We learnt that scientific research in most cases uses the empirical method i.e. uses either data collected 
or data derived from experimentation. Thus the empirical method involves a hypothesis i.e. a testable 
claim and uses experiments and observation to verify the hypothesis
For example we may hypothesise that the use of a plant fertiliser improves plant growth. We design an 
experiment using two sets of equivalent plants, watered and looked after in the same way, where one set 
of plants is given the fertiliser and the other not. We then measure plant growth, measuring the height 
and width of the plants and possibly counting the number of flowers over a period of time. We can also 
get a group of people to visually inspect the plants in an identical manner to check leaf colour and for 
general signs of ill health. We compare the results to verify whether the hypothesis is correct.
In general, scientific discoveries are derived from our experiences or observations. The question is how 
do we collect valid observations?
In most cases we cannot get observations without any intervention as we need to set up and conduct an 
experiment. We collect data from the experiment in a systematic way.

DDesignin g a nd Running  Experiment
Sometimes we may get these observations without intervention, we just need to carry out a skilful and 
meticulous data collection. We could for example survey the population to collect data about eating, 
exercise habits and educations levels and relate this to health outcomes. This is also an experiment. 
When we collect data such as this we need to collect enough data from a varied population to ensure 
that other factors, that we may not have considered, do not skew the results. 
Verifying, or failing to verify, a hypothesis could lead us on to other unanswered questions i.e. a new 
hypothesis and so the cycle repeats itself.
6.2	
Definition of an Experiment
An experiment is therefore a systematic test of the hypothesis. The hypothesis is at the centre of a piece 
of research and needs to be verified (is it true or false?).
As such the experiment and the results produced by them have to be valid, repeatable and significant.
•	 Valid means that the experiment will actually test the hypothesis and the results will not be 
influenced by something else. For example if we hypothesise that the average role on a 6 sided 
dice is 3.5, i.e (1+2+3+4+5,+6)/6, we want to be sure that the dice is not weighted or thrown 
in a way that changes the result. If we made a mistake in our experimental design and allowed 
a magician to roll the dice then the test could actually be a measure of a magician’s skill i.e. 
how good are they at palming and changing the result of a dice?
•	 Repeatable means that we will get the same results more or less every time we run the 
experiment. If for an experiment we role a 6 sided dice 100 times and repeat this experiment, 
the second time we do this we won’t get the same sequence of numbers but the average role 
will be very, very similar.
•	 Significant means that the result is not just marginal i.e. if on the 2nd time we run this experiment 
we are lucky and get a few higher numbers this should have a very limited impact on the 
overall average. If the average did change then we would want to know why. If we designed 
this experiment badly so that we only rolled 2 dice, random chance could have a much greater 
impact on the average number rolled. Thus a change in average would tell us very little – it 
would not be a significant result.

Designing an Experiment
To design an experiment we need to consider on what basis would we be confident of accepting or 
rejecting the hypothesis? This will define the criteria for success. The experiment or test must be designed 
properly to provide the required data. After running the experiment the results can then be analysed to 
determine if this criteria has been met i.e. if the hypothesis is valid or not. On the basis of this we will 
make claims for new knowledge…but will our claims be valid?

DDesignin g a nd Running  Experiment
The experiment itself can be carried out in different environments:- in a special test facility/laboratory, 
in the natural context or using a computer simulation.
To ensure our claims are valid the design and execution of the experiment must be rigorous.
Experiments are often done many times to guarantee that what you observe is reproducible, or to obtain 
an average result. 
Reproducibility is a crucial requirement. Good science requires that others can evaluate our research 
and should be able to reproduce our results so accurate reporting is essential. Without this why should 
other researchers trust our results and trust our claims?
At the heart of our experiments is data measurement. We need to be sure we are measuring the right 
things, taking accurate measurements and accurately recording the results.
We need to ensure bias of any kind is avoided. We need to consider what peripheral influences can 
affect the outcome. Could human perceptions bias the data collection? Could errors with the equipment 
introduce faults?
6.4	
Setting up an Experiment
To successfully run an experiment take care and preparation. 
The experiments needs to be set up. Make a list of the things you need to do the experiment and prepare 
them. To carry out the experiment may require:- 
•	 the generation of an artefact, e.g. a car or a computer program, that you plan to test.
•	 Questionnaires used to collect data – these can be tested on a small user group to ensure the 
questions are unbiased and understood by the recipients. If respondents misinterpret your 
questions then you will not collect accurate data.
•	 Forms may be needed to record data. 
•	 Instructions maybe required for any personnel collected data on your behalf.
•	 Computers, laboratory or other specific equipment may need to be set up and tested – flawed 
equipment will give you flawed data.
All these need to be prepared and tested to ensure everything works before you start.

6.5	
Recording the Results
When doing experiments all measurements and data have to be recorded systematically, meticulously 
and without prejudice…Data that you don’t like it still valid data. 
Experiments may not happen exactly as expected and it is vital to record any coincidental observations 
as well.
Sometimes things go wrong and you may have to check the equipment and restart the experiment. You 
may even need to go back to the beginning and redesign the experiment from scratch. 
6.6	
Can We Trust the Results?
We always need to assess the quality of our results and we may have detected some unexpected results 
to think about. 
If you did not observe a consistent, reproducible trend in your series of experimental runs there may 
be experimental errors. 
We may need to check how we carry out our measurements. Is the measurement method questionable 
or unreliable? Are the instruments working well and are they calibrated? 
If we suspect experimental errors we need to rethink the design of our experiment
•	 Review each step of the procedure to find sources of error. 
•	 Compare with results of other researchers in the literature. If your results disagree with the 
work of other researchers it could be that you are right and they are wrong but it could also 
be that you have made a mistake…so before you publish your data, analysis and conclusions 
check you research first!
•	 If possible, have a scientist review the procedure with you. 
Research can be a difficult, messy process that requires objectivity, i.e. a lack of bias on behalf of the 
experimenter, and a willingness to restart and try again.
6.7	
Analysis of the Results
Summarize what happened (using tables/graphs or written statements) and determine if the result is 
‘statistically significant’ i.e. if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. Statistical tests can measure 
significance though there is controversy in their use.

Sometimes the results can be expressed in mathematical equations and these equations may allow us to 
make predictions. We can then perform additional experiments to prove these predications are accurate…
giving us more evidence our hypothesis is sound.
Studying the tables and graphs, we can see trends that tell us how different variables affected the observed 
effects. Based on these trends, we can draw conclusions.
6.8	
Reaching Conclusions
In reaching conclusions we are trying to answer our original question i.e. was the hypothesis correct? 
Ideally the conclusions we reach will absolutely confirm or refute our original hypothesis but this is not 
always the case. If our hypothesis fails i.e. if we had a theory and this is proven to be false it does not 
mean our research has failed. This is still success! 
A disproven hypothesis still pushes forward the boundaries of knowledge. Knowing what did not cause 
the original observation allows us to consider other causes.
As Thomas Edison reportedly said when trying to make a lightbulb ‘I have not failed. I’ve just found 
10,000 ways that won’t work’…in effect he has learnt from each failure.

If we can’t prove or disprove our hypothesis it is perfectly valid to make weaker claims, e.g. ‘A seems to 
cause B’, this may then require further research to prove or disprove this claim. 
We need to consider:-
•	 If we need to do more work and more experiments to get better results?
•	 If your hypothesis is not correct, what could be the answer to our question? 
•	 Were there any difficulties or problems doing the experiment and could we be detecting 
experimental errors?
•	 Do we need to change the procedure and repeat the experiment and what should be done 
differently next time? 
•	 Finally what can we say retrospectively about the validity, repeatability and significance of 
our results?
6.9	
Different Types of Experiment
What we need to evaluate and how depends on the nature of the research problem and a number of 
different types of experiments that we have already considered but here we will discuss them in a little 
more detail:- 
•	 Controlled experiments – where a hypothesis is tested in a laboratory environment to evaluate 
the effect of a specific variable.
•	 Natural experiments – where a set of tests are performed outside the laboratory in situ in the 
natural setting by collecting data that show variation of a specific factor and observing its effects.
•	 Case Studies – which carry out a longitudinal in-depth study on a phenomenon or organisation 
without intervention to gain better insight into it.
•	 Action Research – where a phenomenon, population or organisation is studied much like a 
case study but with intervention to attempt to resolve a problem and observing the effects of 
the interventions.
There are countless variants and combinations of these that have been used and of course we have as 
one alternative a ‘mathematical proof’.
6.9.1	
Controlled Experiments
A reliable experiment should have some form of control. A control is a neutral reference point for 
comparison and it allows to observe what actual effect changing a single variable has.
Establishing a control requires an additional experiment but where no experimental variables are changed 
apart from the one variable we are testing.

DDesignin g a nd Running  Experiment
If several variables are changing each time we run an experiment then we cannot be sure which is causing 
a change in the results. Furthermore other experimental conditions could change and these could have 
an impact on the results – we may not have even considered these other factors as relevant. 
Without a control you cannot be sure that changing the variable causes your observations.
Controlled experiments are generally preferred because we can be sure to exclude spurious factors 
influencing the outcome.
When undertaking a controlled experiment we run the experiment twice. Between the two experiments 
all of the factors should be kept constant and apart from the one factor we are interested in i.e. in all 
but one thing the two experiments should be identical.
These experiments can show a causal relationship i.e. once the cause is present the effect can be observed.
6.9.2	
Experiments in an Imperfect World
In the work done by Tobias Schwabe (2014), the first research paper we looked at in the previous chapter, 
we can see that this was not an ideal controlled experiment but instead they used a ‘reliable theoretical 
reference dataset’. 
It is easy to criticise research that does not have a perfect design however this would be unfair. Real 
world constraints often mean that:-
•	 we don’t have as much data as we would like or 
•	 we can’t do a fully controlled experiment or
•	 some other aspect of the experimental design is not ideal.
It could well be that other researchers have used a particular dataset in their experiment and we want to 
use the same dataset so that we can compare our results with their results…but what if we can’t run the 
same experiment in exactly the same way because the previous researchers didn’t give us quite enough 
information to do so? Despite this we may still want to try and compare our methods with their methods 
under as closely controlled conditions as possible.
When experimental design is compromised it does cast some doubt over the results and conclusions 
but we need to be more intelligent than just reject research that is not ideal otherwise we would reject 
many research conclusions that are perfectly valid.
In the case of the research by Tobias Schwabe (2014) we must ask what if any impact did the use of the 
‘theoretical reference dataset’ have on the results and conclusions?

When this research is properly evaluated we may believe the conclusions are fully justified by the evidence 
despite it not being a fully controlled experiment.
Activity 1
Consider the following experimental design:-
Researchers want to undertake a ‘controlled’ experiment to compare exam results between two different methods of 
educating children. They take two inner city schools where children are from the same socio-economic background. 
They therefore try to ensure the children are from equivalent backgrounds with equivalent education attainment and 
equivalent aspirations. They also ensure the two schools are equivalent in terms of the educational resources per child 
etc. Of course the researchers ensure the students are taking the same exams otherwise how can they compare results? 
They compare the results from one class educated in a normal way with one class educated using the new method.
Now answer the questions below:-
a.	
Is this a fully controlled experiment or can you think of any spurious factors that could influence the results?
b.	
Should we just simply reject any conclusions coming from research not done under strictly controlled conditions? 
c.	
Can you think of one way to improve the experimental design and thus gain more accurate results?

Feedback 1
a.	
This is not a fully controlled experiment and numerous factors could influence the result. Firstly the teacher using 
the new method could work harder knowing that their class results are being observed. If the children know 
that they are part of a research study then they could also behave differently…if there is a reduction in truancy 
this could certainly have an impact on the results. The two teachers could themselves be of different standards 
though if the results from previous cohorts are very similar this is presumably not the case. 
If the exam results are marked by the teachers themselves this could certainly introduce bias.
Other spurious factors could influence the results. Perhaps one class took their exam in the morning when some 
of the students were still sleepy. If the other class took the exam in the afternoon this difference alone could 
influence the results.
b.	
We can’t simply reject conclusions from research not done under strictly controlled conditions. As you will see 
from looking at the other experimental types there are many situations where we cannot undertake strictly 
controlled experiments.
c.	
There are obvious things that can be done to improve the design of the experiment above:-
Firstly we should remove the obvious cause for bias caused by treating the two classes differently. Ideally neither 
teachers nor students would know about the experiment thus their behaviour would not change. Of course not 
informing the children and their parents would have ethical implications but there are ways of getting informed 
consent without unduly altering the class behaviour. We could ask all parents in both schools to provide consent 
for the study without identifying the specific classes involved thus not unduly influencing the children of one 
of the classes.
Secondly while we cannot rule out spurious influences on the results we can reduce the impact of these by 
comparing 5 different classes using the new method with 5 classes using the traditional teaching method…of 
course this has cost and time implications and we need to ask ‘How many classes are enough?’. 
If the researchers had collected data from 10 classes we could always ask for more…Asking for more data is not 
always reasonable.
Perfectly undertaken controlled experiments are in many way ideal however these are often not possible 
and we can’t just reject research not done in a perfectly controlled manner. We need to intelligently 
consider the causes of bad science and evaluate research accordingly. This will be the subject of the 
next chapter – for now we will concentrate on getting a better understanding of experimental design.
6.9.3	
Natural Experiments
In many situations we must rely on Natural Experiments. Natural Experiments are those that rely solely 
on observations of the variables of the system under study. 
They attempt to collect data for the system in such a way that contribution from all variables can 
be determined. 
As natural experiments are uncontrolled, variables from undetected sources are neither measured nor 
held constant, and may produce false results.

Natural experiments are often undertaken in the social sciences. For example we may conduct a huge 
survey of a population to determine the causes of crime. In doing such a survey we may look at criminal 
activity and collect data on all of the socio economic and education history of the offenders. There are many 
factors that can influence an individual’s criminal behaviour – some of which we may have considered, 
e.g. parental behaviour, but much of which we may not have considered or which we may not be able 
to collect data on e.g. opportunities for easy criminal activity and perceived gain or a particular one off 
event, e.g. a riot, that had unusual causes.
Determining the causes of crime is of course an important question that could influence governmental, 
educational and policing policy and could have a significant impact on society however we must be sure 
that the causes identified from the research are indeed the true causes and not mistaken conclusions 
caused by errors in our data collection.
To reduce/eliminate the impact of spurious factors that could influence the results any survey must be 
detailed and undertaken from a large and varied population. We must do our best to ensure the data 
collected is not biased or flawed by badly worded questions. Statistical analysis must then be done with 
great care to ensure the influence of each of the factors is correctly identified.
Finally care must be taken to ensure that the researchers don’t assume a causal relationship exists just 
because there is a correlation between the measurements and the outcomes. 
A trivial example of a correlation but not a causal relationship is at the end of a journey. I get off the 
train at the last stop and so does everyone else…these two things are strongly related i.e. there is a strong 
correlation between when I get off and when other passengers get off the train but the relationship is not 
causal i.e. it is not me leaving the train that causes other passenger to leave (I am not quite that popular ). 
Natural experiments often highlight correlated factors, e.g. educational attainment and crime, but it 
would be a mistake to assume all of these are causal relationships. If the relationship is not a causal 
relationship improving educational standards may not reduce crime. Further work must therefore often 
be done to test if relationship is causal. 
Despite the care needed when undertaking natural experiments they are not inferior to controlled 
experiments. There are often situations where they are necessary but they must be undertaken with due 
care and again the method and results must be open to evaluation by other researchers.

Case Study
A case study is a detailed and careful study of one group or one entity. It could be a study of one 
organisation, e. g. one business, or a smaller study of one department.
Case studies are often done where researchers are trying to understand one aspect of an organisation. 
As no two organisations are identical it is often not possible to have a control so, as with a natural 
experiment, we need to be careful other factors are not influencing our results. 
If the study is of one department it could be possible to compare this with another department but unless 
these are identical in all aspects this would not be a perfect controlled group.
Unlike a natural experiment, which may use a survey to collect a small amount of data from a large 
population, a case study will investigate one organisation in depth. It may involve a longitudinal study 
i.e. be done over a period of time.
Often case studies are undertaken when researchers do not want to perform a specific experiment or 
test but solely gain a better understanding of a domain or phenomenon. These are often undertaken in 
social sciences but can be used in many other fields as well.
Case studies therefore involve an in-depth, longitudinal examination of a single domain or event. They are 
based on a systematic way of looking at events, collecting data, analysing information, and reporting the 
results. As a result the researcher may gain a sharpened understanding of the phenomenon, or a process.
Case studies can be used to investigate/test a hypotheses but the observations made can often generate 
a new hypothesis that then needs further testing. 
For example an organisation may notice that they are getting a very low number of repeat customers but 
they may not know why this is the case. There could be numerous causes…poor products, poor service 
or something else. But if it is poor service what aspect of the organisation is causing this? 
A case study may collect all sorts of details about the processes involved in the organisation and the 
service offered to customers. Careful analysis of the data may highlight a clear cause however the results 
may not be clear cut. It may be clear that customers are getting a slow response to product queries but 
is this really the cause of low levels of repeat business? 
If this is the belief this then becomes a hypothesis that could be tested by further research and one way 
of doing this is by undertaking action research.

6.9.5	
Action Research
Action research is a spiral process which allows action (change/improvement) and research to be achieved 
at the same time. 
One example of action research would be to collect data from the organisation showing the response 
times for customer queries and levels of repeat business, make changes to improve the response times 
and measure the data to see if response times have improved and see if there is a measured impact on 
repeat levels of business. 
Understanding an organisation, possibly by undertaking a case study first, allows us to make a more 
intelligent well informed change. At the same time making this change and collecting the resultant data 
allows us to confirm or refute our hypothesis thus we learn more about the organisation by seeing what 
impact, if any, the change had. 
Making changes to an organisation, processes etc affects the staff involved and this requires care. If the 
people affected by the change are involved in the action research they may be more willing to support 
the changes.

An action research study can begin with an imprecise research question. Initially imprecise questions 
and methods can be expected to yield imprecise answers but these answers can help to refine questions 
and methods and lead to more precise actions and a better understanding of the organisation. Thus the 
process can be cyclical.
Make Observations 
Analyse the Results 
Plan One Change 
Implement the Change 
If multiple changes are made at the same time it will be very difficult to determine the impact of an 
individual change. Therefore when undertaking action research only one change should be made at a time. 
As with a natural experiment and a case study we must take care of confounding issues i.e. of other 
factors that may influence the results. As action research takes time other factors within the organisation 
are likely to change while the action research is being undertaken and these may have an impact on the 
results and the conclusions we reach.
Imagine customer response times are significantly improved but there is no change in repeat business. 
Is this because customer response times were not the cause a low levels of repeat business or could 
something else have deteriorated while we made changes to improve response times? If, at the same time 
as we improved the response time, the quality of the response became worse it will not be surprising 
that the level of repeat business did not improve. However if we are not aware that the quality of the 
response has deteriorated we could reach the erroneous conclusion that the response time did not matter. 
As with all research we must take care to ensure the research and our conclusions are sound.

Considering Different Types of Experiment
The exercises below are designed to improve your understanding of experimental design. This will be 
beneficial when evaluating research others have done.

Feedback 2
It would be possible to devise a controlled experiment for this:- take a large group of children who are identical twins. 
Keeping all other factors the same vary the eating habits i.e. make one twin eat healthy food and make the other eat 
junk food. Finally compare the weight outcomes for the children who ate the junk food to see what impact their genes 
had and compare the weights of each pair of twins to see what impact their varied diet had.
This experimental design would work but this would be somewhat unethical! It would also be difficult to keep all other 
factors the same…children, including identical twins, can have different hobbies and therefore do different levels 
of exercise.
However identical twins have in the past been separated, possibly through the adoption process or for other reasons, 
and brought up in different families. Being in different families the different children live different lifestyles…of course 
exercise and eating habits would not be the only differences, but if we had enough data from enough identical twins 
who have been brought up separately we could then compare their weights and try to attribute these to difference’s 
in lifestyles…exercise, eating habits etc we could therefore assess the impact genetics had and compare this with the 
impact diet had. 
Researchers have in fact collected data on many such twins as this makes it easy to study nature verses nurture issues.
Going back to our problem we could actually do exactly the same comparison within the general population…we don’t 
need identical twins for this. Of course we would need to collect genetic data, i.e. take a blood sample, as well as collecting 
survey data and we would need a large data set to determine the effect of genetics vs eating habits while eliminating 
other lifestyle issues that effect weight. This would not be a controlled experiment as there is no control group – it 
would be a natural experiment as it relies solely on collecting data from the population without making any changes.
A case study is not appropriate here as we are not investigating one organisation but action research is possible (though 
not easy). We could encourage a change in the eating habits of the population in one city and see what impact this has. 
Of course we would still need to collect genetic data for comparison purposes and rule out other factors and it is not 
easy to change the eating habits of an entire city. We could take a smaller group and try to change the eating habits of 
children in one school. While not easy this would be possible with concerted effort and would have the advantage of 
improving the health of those children at the same time.
Both natural experiments and action research are therefore possible answers here.
Activity 3

It would certainly be possible to undertake a controlled experiment for this. Take the two engines and, keeping all other 
factors the same, compare them to see how far they will go on 1 litre of fuel. To keep all other factors the same it would 
be easier to run this experiment in a lab rather than in the real world. 
A controlled experiment would allow us to make a clear and precise comparison however we would need to ensure 
that the experiment was a realistic simulation of the real world. Speed obviously has an impact on fuel efficiency and 
it is possible that one engine is better at slow speeds and the other at fast speeds…so we would need to run this 
experiment at several speeds. However other factors also have an effect in the real world:- Motorway and city driving 
are also different and we need to consider this if we are to make a claim that drivers would experience a better fuel 
efficiency with one of the engines.
We could consider a natural experiment, i.e. do a huge survey, to see which engine type is more fuel efficient in reality…
but we would need to collect lots of data to eliminate differences caused by different car manufacturers, old/new cars, 
driving styles etc and we would need to be sure that we collected accurate data on distance travelled per litre of fuel. 
Not easy to do! We certainly could not rely on human memory or personal reflections and anecdotal evidence.
Case studies and action research are not at all relevant here.
A controlled experiment here would therefore certainly be the easiest way to compare engines…but we would need 
to be careful to ensure we don’t exaggerate our claims and say the results we obtained would be an accurate reflection 
of the a drivers real world experience.

DDesignin g a nd Running  Experiment
In the example above a controlled experiment is the ideal solution however there would be a significant 
complication if the two different engines required different type of fuel. We would then need to 
calculate the energy density of the different fuels and take this into consideration when comparing the 
different engines.
Complications like this are often found when designing experiments but these are often resolvable. 
There is a simple alternative that we may wish to consider…. Instead of comparing engine efficiency 
we could compare the running cost i.e. the distance travelled per £ spent on fuel for each fuel/engine 
combination. This would often be reasonable as most drivers are not interested in which type of engine 
is more efficient, petrol or diesel. They interested in which type of car is cheaper to run (though fuel 
costs are of course not the only consideration here).
6.11	
More Detailed Experimental Design
After deciding on the overall type of experiment we then need to decide on the details of the experiment. 
Exactly what will we measure i.e. what data will we collect? How will we collect this? What equipment 
will be needed? How will we ensure the data we collect will be accurate and free from bias? How will 
we analyse the results?
Activity 4
Consider the following scenario and answer the questions below:-
A car manufacturer has designed 10 different car seats and wants to know which seat design is the most comfortable.

DDesignin g a nd Running  Experiment
Feedback 4
a.	
What experiment would you undertake (a controlled experiment/natural experiment/case study or action 
research)?
This calls for a controlled experiment, run 10 times, where each different seat design is tested under the same 
conditions.
b.	
What would you measure and does this require quantitative or qualitative data?
This requires us to assess comfort which is not quantifiable so we would need to collect this qualitative data 
using an appropriately designed scale e.g. 1-Very Uncomfortable, 2-Uncomfortable, 3-Neutral, 4- Comfortable 
and 5-Very Comfortable.
c.	
How would you run this experiment?
We would need to run this experiment with a range of people of differing heights, differing weights and both 
sexes as males and females have different body shapes. We may also need to consider ethnic/cultural differences 
in case different cultures have different expectations of comfort – it may not seem obvious but different colours 
have differing impact on people brought up with different cultural expectations. 
We would also need to define precisely how this experiment would be run…will each person just sit in the seat 
for 5 minutes or will they drive a car for an hour while sitting in the seat?
d.	
How would you collect and record the data? 
We would need to use a carefully worded questionnaire and we would need to check the wording of this. To 
do this we may run the experiment on a very small scale just to check it is clear, unbiased and appropriate to 
what we are measuring.
e.	
How would you ensure a lack of bias in the results?
To reduce the potential for bias we would need to run the experiment with numerous individuals so we get an 
overall view and so not be unduly influenced by 1 or 2 individuals. We would need to ensure the testers are a 
fair representation of the population – if 55% of the population are females then 55% of the testers should be 
female. We also must ensure that no bias is introduced by the person running the experiment and collecting 
the data…thus the seat designers should not be collecting the data.
We must also consider the order effect…if the people involved in the test sit in all 10 seats starting with design 
1, and working up to design 10, by the time they test the final seat they will be weary and potentially sore…thus 
design 10 will get poor scores when compared with design 1. This would not be a fair test.
We must therefore either vary the order seats are tested in so each design is tested first by 10% of the testers. 
There is actually no requirement for each tester to test each design…if we have enough testers we can just 
randomly allocate testers to 1 of 10 groups and get each group to test 1 design.
f.	
How would you analyse the results to decide which seat design was most comfortable?
To analyse the results we could just take an average score or compare graphs of the data but we should also 
consider statistical techniques to ensure we have used enough testers and the results are not just marginal or 
influenced by random chance.

DDesignin g a nd Running  Experiment
g.	
Are there any limitations of the proposed experiment?
Finally, as we have noted, we would need to ensure the testers are a fair representation of the population…but 
populations are different around the world and body shape also changes slightly. Therefore the best seat design 
for American consumers is not necessarily the best seat design for a Japanese market. 
This does not require us to collect data from testers in every country around the world but we do need to recognise 
this issue so our final conclusions are valid. It we have testers that are fair representative of a European market 
we cannot reach the conclusion that Seat X is the best for everyone.
Detailed experimental design is important if our conclusions are to be valid and we must certainly 
consider issues of data collection, bias and any limitations of the experiment.
6.12	
Summary
In this chapter we have focused on understanding more about the design of experiments as understanding 
these are essential if we are to evaluate the work and conclusions of other researchers.
We have looked in detail at different types of experiments:- Controlled, Natural, Case Study and Action 
Research and we have considered when/where to use these.

DDesignin g a nd Running  Experiment
We have seen that while controlled experiments may seem ideal the other experimental types are also 
required – they just need to be carefully done.
We have also seen that having a control group is not always simple but still, with care a comparative 
study is sometimes possible.
We have looked at experiment design in more detail and considered issues of data collection/bias and 
limitations. 
The gold standard for any experiment is:- Repeatability, Validity , Significance and we need to consider 
if our experimental design meets these standards.
We need to be very meticulous when:- designing the experiment, doing the experiment, collecting and 
recording the data and analysing the results. 
Just as we will learn to evaluate the work of other researchers so other researchers will evaluate our 
research.
Having now considered experimental design in some detail we will now focus our attention on how to 
evaluate the work of others.

7	 Bad Science and the Need for 
Critical Evaluation
Introduction
Way back in chapter 1 we discussed how when writing a research paper you need to evaluate research 
and present your own conclusions. In order to help with this we have now looked at experimental design 
and started to consider issues of data collection/bias and the limitations of the experiments. 
We saw that experiments need to be undertaken carefully and saw that doing a controlled experiment 
under ideal conditions is simply not always possible.
We saw that even if a perfectly controlled experiment is possible there will still be questions to answer 
unless the experiment is a prefect reflection of real world conditions (an unlikely circumstance). 
In chapter 1 we saw that ‘Critical Evaluation’ does not mean finding fault. It means to judge/assess the 
important aspects of the work. However to do that we must have an understanding of what can go 
wrong in research.
The purpose of this chapter is to help you to understand that bad science does exist and help you gain 
an understanding of how to critically evaluate the evidence.
In particular we will consider:-
•	 what could go wrong with experimental methods,
•	 what could go wrong with the reporting of results,
•	 what could be wrong with the conclusions researchers reach,
•	 and we will consider one additional but important thought.
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will…
•	 Have a deeper understanding of just what can go wrong in research
•	 Have a little experience of evaluating research methodology, discussion of results and 
researchers claims.

BBad  Scienc e a nd the  Nee d fo r Critical  Evaluatio
7.1	
Scepticism is Good and Science is Essential 
Politician’s often quote statistical evidence to support their claims but when two politicians are arguing 
for opposing policies and denying the other persons statistical evidence it’s hard to know who to trust. 
Furthermore if statistical evidence is sound you can’t just deny it. 
It’s not surprising therefore that both politicians and statistics end up with a bad reputation.
Activity 1
Watch Michael Shermers ‘Baloney Detection Kit’ (14 Mins)
This is an informative and entertaining video that explains why scepticism is good and how science is essential. It also 
presents 10 things to consider that will help you to determine the truth from the rubbish.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNSHZG9blQQ&list=PLgPIENXhxGTQhiBxtBBuhhZTpzBukZZXa
Feedback 1
Science is the best way we have to determine the truth and being sceptical is the best defence we have against conmen, 
people who are biased and scientists who have made mistakes.
In many ways this book is trying to give you the skills to be a professional sceptic…a person who doesn’t 
reject the claims of others because of their own personal prejudice but a person who accepts or rejects 
those claims after looking at the evidence and applying sound scientific reasoning to determine if the 
claims are valid. 
7.2	
But What about Bad Science?
While science is essential as we have seen in the video above scientists can, and do, make mistakes. 
Furthermore by the time science is reported in the popular press it is often exaggerated or distorted to 
the point where the claims made are simply not true. 
Worse still are the pseudo scientists who put on the trappings of a scientist, wearing a lab coat for instance, 
and who report distorted claims of scientific evidence in order to give their claims false legitimacy. 
Next time you see someone, in a shopping centre, wearing a lab coat while selling a new diet pill, or 
other health product, ask yourself ‘Why do they need to wear a lab coat when selling something that is 
inside a sealed packet inside a box?’ 
Whenever claims are made we need to determine if the claims are sound and we need to understand in 
what ways science can be flawed in order to determine this.

Watch Ben Goldacre: Battling Bad Science (14 mins)
This is an informative and entertaining video that explains many ways in which scientific evidence can be distorted.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4MhbkWJzKk
Feedback 2
Understanding how science can be distorted is essential if you are to be able to evaluate the evidence presented in 
research papers.
Activity 3
Read the article, link provided below, ‘Science is often flawed. It’s time we embraced that.’ by Julia Belluz and Steven 
Hoffman, 2015. This is a short but informative article that explains the extent of the problem with bad science, the 
limitations of the peer review process and highlights the extent of problem with distorted news.
The article also offers suggested solutions namely post publication review and meta research.
http://www.vox.com/2015/5/13/8591837/how-science-is-broken
Feedback 3
Ultimately science, and the claims scientists make, can be flawed and we need to apply a healthy level of scepticism to 
the claims made before we accept them as valid.
Writing a research paper requires a critical evaluation of the evidence but these same skills should be 
applied whenever you are being sold and idea or product.
We therefore need to consider:-
•	 What could go wrong with experimental methods?
•	 What could go wrong with reporting results?
•	 What could be wrong with the conclusions?
7.3	
Bad Science
Not all science is perfectly executed.
Not all results are perfectly reported.
Sometimes conclusions are reached that are not completely justified.
Scientists sometimes make mistakes! 
Sometimes people use bad science deliberately for financial reasons!

7.4	
Evaluating the Science
Even if a research paper is published in a well-respected journal you should determine for yourself if 
the conclusions presented in the paper are valid.
To determine if the conclusions are valid you must ask the following questions…
Was the method used for the experiment scientifically sound? 	
Were the results accurately and fairly reported?	 	
	
Were the conclusions fully justified by the evidence? 	
	
If the answer to any of these questions is no then we must reject the conclusions.
If the answer to all of these is yes then we can accept conclusions as valid.
Accepting the conclusions after evaluating the method, results and claims is still critical evaluation. 
Remember critical evaluation does not mean ‘finding fault’ it means ‘assessing the quality’.

electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Poor Methodology…
The first step is therefore to evaluate the research methodology and some of the potential flaws or issues 
with research methodology are listed here…
Confounding Variables: confounding variables can be an issue in any research where a perfectly 
constrained controlled experiment is not conducted. They can often be found in observational studies 
where some other unmeasured variable is causing an effect on the results.
Complexities with Comparative Studies: In a controlled experiment all of the variables should be 
perfectly controlled and the only difference is the one variable being tested. However it is not always 
possible to conduct a perfectly controlled experiment and in these cases researchers will sometimes 
do a comparative study where there are several variations between the things being compared. In such 
situations we need to carefully assess the detail of the comparative study to ensure that other differences 
between the two groups do not impact on the results. This really is another example where a problem 
caused by a confounding variable is possible.
Badly Randomised Groups: In a controlled experiment, where two groups of people are involved, the 
participants should be randomly allocated to groups. If this is not done or if the groups are randomised 
badly, e.g. by human selection, then the two groups will not be identical – one group could be fitter, 
taller etc and this could have an impact on the results.
The Order Effect: As with randomised participants the order people do activities can have an influence on 
the outcomes. As with the example previously mentioned where participants are used to test car seats for 
comfort. The order the seats are tested should be randomised or this will have an impact on the results.
The Placebo Effect: The Placebo effect is not a myth. The effect is real and it is the power of belief and 
of the mind. To overcome this effect a doubly blinded trail should be conducted. In a doubly blinded 
drug trail the patient is not informed if they are getting the real treatment or the placebo. The doctor 
who is administering the drug and collecting the results is also not aware which patients are in which 
group (this prevents the clinician from being biased in the way they talk to the patient or collect the 
results from the patient).
Correlation/Causal Confusion: Research that identifies a correlation between variables but then assumes 
that the relationship is causal link without properly confirming this (an example of this was discussed 
in a previous chapter).

BBad  Scienc e a nd the  Nee d fo r Critical  Evaluatio
Surrogate Outcomes: Measuring surrogate outcomes is sometimes necessary however if we are not 
measuring the actual outcome we wish to measure but are measuring a surrogate we must be confident 
that the surrogate is an adequate substitute otherwise our conclusions will be flawed (an example of this 
was discussed in a previous chapter).
Data Not Cleaned: Occasionally when collecting data there is an anomaly in the data. Such items of 
data do not represent the norm and should be removed so as not to unfairly influence the results. For 
example if a researcher is comparing the walking habits of male and female ramblers where almost all 
of the participants in the study are serious walkers, who go out on long walks 2 or 3 times per week, 
but where one member of the group has only just joined the group. They are new, inexperienced, not as 
fit as the other members of the group and don’t yet have all of the normal walking gear. Their habits are 
likely to be very different from the norm and they should be excluded from the study. Cleansing data, i.e. 
removing anomalies, is important but must be done fairly so as not to introduce bias into the outcomes.
Poor Data Collection: Poor methods for data collection, e.g. machines that are not calibrated, relying on 
human senses, poor data recording etc, can cause errors in the data and thus errors in the experimental 
results. Humans can be used to collect data, e.g. to spot unusual birds, but care must be taken to ensure 
the data is accurate. One way of doing this is to ensure only the data that is corroborated by other 
observers is used.
Biased Data (Accidental): Care must be taken to ensure none of the data used in an experiment is 
biased. Bias can creep in from many sources:- badly worded questionnaires, human bias when asking 
the questions or collecting the results, biased or unrepresentative participants. For example, assume 
a researcher is collecting the views of a city’s residents on their local city council. They stand outside 
the shops in the city centre early one morning and ask everyone who passes, random strangers, to fill 
in a carefully worded unbiased questionnaire. However the results of this survey will be biased as the 
people surveyed are not ‘random’. The people who pass the shops early in the morning are likely to be 
people who work in the city centre and they are not truly representative of everyone living in the city. 
In particular people who live in the city but work outside of the city are not likely to be passing the city 
centre shops. These residents may have important views on issues such as transport links in the area 
that this survey would not collect.
Biased Data (Deliberate): All experimental results should be recorded, both positive and negative, yet 
some researchers have deleted the negative results and thus have presented conclusions based on a flawed 
set of data. There can be several reasons for doing this…a fundamental lack of understanding of research 
or human bias (for personal or financial reasons). Looking at one research paper and one experiment 
it is extremely difficult to detect if data has been falsified in this way. It is only when looking at large 
meta-studies that the effect becomes noticeable. When evaluating one research paper it is therefore best 
to assume the researcher has not falsified the data however questions of bias can be asked if the research 
is funded by a particular lobby or interest group.

Examples of Good or Bad Methodology
Researchers who may have made a mistakes in the way they designed and conducted some research 
are in many cases unaware of the problems and sadly there is never a section in a research paper called 
‘What is wrong with this research’.
To evaluate the problems with the methodology a reader has to carefully read and consider every step of 
the researcher’s methodology. If a research paper is well written at least the details of the methodology 
should be clear but it does take time and effort. Time to read the paper carefully and effort to consider 
each step in the process to evaluate each step for potential flaws.
Practising your evaluation skills on real research papers would be a long and complex process and this 
would be especially difficult if the subject of the paper is not something you are familiar with. As this 
is therefore probably not the best way to get you started there are some very simple and short scenarios 
are presented below to give you a chance to consider issues with methodology. 
As these are very short and simplified descriptions don’t consider issues of missing information – just 
consider if there are clear problems with the methodology.

BBad  Scienc e a nd the  Nee d fo r Critical  Evaluatio
Activity 4
Consider the following research scenario below and answer the question below it:- 
Many younger members of society, in particular children, have been brought up with modern technology, module 
phones, the internet etc, and have no problem using these technologies. However some older people have not used 
the internet at all and others have been known to find browsing the internet difficult. Given this a researcher wanted to 
know which web browser is the easiest to use for someone over 70 years old who has never used a web browser before.
Rather than ask subjective questions regarding ‘ease of use’ the researcher decided to quantify this. They gave the 
participants of the study 10 pieces of information to find and measured how long it took them to find all 10 and they 
measured how often the person asked for help…the theory being that if a browser was easy to use the participant 
would not need lots of help and would find the information quickly. A more difficult web browser would require more 
help and take longer to use.
The researchers made sure the participants were a fair reflection of society i.e. varying gender/educational/work 
experience backgrounds etc and to ensure that the results were not unduly influenced by 1 or 2 individuals the researchers 
used a large sample group (100 participants). On checking the researchers discovered that one of the participants had 
used a web browsers before. Their results were therefore excluded from the study. None of the other 99 participants 
had used a web browser before.
The researcher asked all of the 100 participants to use web browser A and they measured how long it took them to find 
the answers and how many times the participants asked for help.
After testing web browser A all participants went on to test web browser B, then C and finally D.
Look at each step of the way this research was conducted and consider if there was something wrong with the 
methodology. If so how could this research have been changed to fix the problem?
Feedback 4
The researchers used a reasonable sample size and ensured the participants were a representative sample of the 
population. They cleaned the data and correctly excluded one set of data from the results. 
The researchers did not measure ‘ease of use’ instead they took two surrogate measures, ‘time to find the answers’ and ‘no 
of times the participants asked for help’. These two were quantifiable and taken together could perhaps be a reasonable 
indication of ‘ease of use’. This data certainly made it easy to compare the results of testing one web browser to another.
However there was one significant error in this research. None of the participants had used a web browser before they 
used web browser A – not surprisingly perhaps they then struggled, they took time to find the answers and asked for 
help numerous times.
By the time the participants came to use web browser D they had used three others, A, B and C. While this web browser 
interface may have looked a little different the participants had learnt from their previous experiences…they therefore 
did not ask for help often and found the answers quickly.
The researchers concluded that browser D was a better web browser for older novice users as it was easier to use…
However this was a flawed piece of research and thus the conclusions reached are unjustified.
If you spotted this order effect error then ‘Well done!’
If you think the summary above was made up and was not ‘real research’ then you would be wrong. This 
was a summary of real research that was reported as part of a larger research project. As in the summary 
above the research methodology followed by the researcher involved was flawed.

There is one additional point to make here…the descriptions in the original research paper were much 
more detailed and complex than in the summary above. Furthermore the original researcher was not 
aware of the methodological error they had made so the description of the error was not so glaringly 
reported. Therefore if a reader quickly glanced over the research paper they would perhaps not spot the 
error. Spotting errors like this requires an understanding of research but it also takes time and requires 
conscious and careful thought. 
Activity 5
Consider the following research scenario then answer the questions below:- 
Three friends had a dispute over the difference between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. One friend declared 
adamantly that he can always tell the difference and he doesn’t like decaffeinated coffee.
The three friends decided to do a proper research study to check this assertion. They decided to conduct a doubly blind 
controlled experiment and to help with this they involve a fourth friend. 
The fourth person ran the experiment. To do this they bought 3 lots of caffeinated coffee and 3 lots of decaffeinated 
coffee. To keep the coffees as similar as possible the researcher ensured that the varieties are all medium roast and 
cost approximately the same. None of the coffees were on sale at the time and thus hopefully the price indicated they 
were of similar quality. Each batch of coffee was split into 3 smaller batches, making 18 batches in total. The coffee was 
randomly ordered and anonymously packaged and labelled. 
The three friends drank one batch of coffee each week, not knowing anything about the specific coffee they were 
drinking, and give it a rating 1–5 depending on how much they enjoyed the flavour. The friends also stated whether or 
not they thought the coffee was caffeinated or decaffeinated. Thus each type of coffee was rated 3 times by each of the 
3 friends reducing the chance of random error. The results were all carefully recorded by the 3 friends.
At the end of the trial the person running the experiment analysed the results and noted that the 3 friends correctly 
identify the decaffeinated coffee only 47% of the time…random chance would give them a 50% success rate. He also 
noted that on a scale of 1–5 one of the coffees gained an average score of 4.6 significantly higher than the next best 
coffee (that only scored 3.5). This ‘best coffee’ was decaffeinated. 
The results of the friend who adamantly declared that he can always tell the difference and he doesn’t like decaffeinated 
coffee closely reflected the group results. Though he only spotted the decaffeinated coffee 44% of the time and he gave 
the best coffee a score of 4.7.
The researcher concluded that the group, and this friend in particular, could not tell the difference between caffeinated 
or decaffeinated coffee. Despite the small sample set the researcher also concluded that all of the friends clearly enjoyed 
some decaffeinated coffee.
a.	
Look at each step of the research and consider if there something wrong with the methodology. 
b.	
Specifically now consider if the small sample size, 6 sets of coffee (3 caffeinated and 3 decaffeinated) and 3 
participants in the study…was this small sample size a problem?

Feedback 5
Considering the research methodology overall this was a carefully controlled doubly blinded trail with adequate steps 
taken to remove the chance of bias from the participants. Care was also taken to ensure the results were properly and 
accurately recorded.
Steps were taken to ensure that the coffees were all generally comparable. 
The results were significant. The group gained a slightly lower than average score for their ability to identify decaffeinated 
coffee and one of the decaffeinated brands scored a significantly higher score for flavour when compared with the others.
This was, in short, a well conducted study.
Only 3 caffeinated and 3 decaffeinated coffees were tested…and only 3 taste testers were involved.
It is always easy to criticise the sample size but what would be enough? To assess the sample size we really need to look 
at the researcher’s conclusions.
If the researchers concluded that decaffeinated coffees were generally more flavoursome than caffeinated varieties 
then it would be reasonable to criticise the samples used in this study. Three friends do not sufficiently represent 
the population of people buying coffee and three samples of caffeinated coffee, all within one price bracket, do not 
adequately represent all of the varieties of coffee available.
However looking at the specific conclusions reached the sample size in this study was not a problem. The conclusions 
reached were that this group could not tell whether coffee was caffeinated of not…and every member of the group, i.e. 
100%, were involved in the tests. The researcher also concluded that ‘all of the friends clearly enjoyed some decaffeinated 
coffee’. To reach this conclusion only required one flavour of decaffeinated coffee to score well and the coffee that scored 
the best was decaffeinated. Thus this conclusion was justified despite the small number of coffees sampled.
When considering experimental methods it should be noted that experiments with small samples can 
have larger, positive or negative, errors due to random chance and these errors will reduce as larger 
studies are conducted. In other words larger studies are more likely to give you a more accurate results 
(see sample error plot diagram below).
Sample Size 
Poistive Error  
Negative Error  
Accurate Result 
Despite this initial studies are often done with small samples and this is fine if the conclusions reached 
reflect this.

Big or Small Question Mark ?  or ?
Good science should be repeatable by other researchers. Thus when evaluating a researchers methodology 
a valid question to ask is ‘Has the experimental method been reported in enough detail so that other 
researchers can repeat the experiment?’ 
The answer to this question should be yes however if the answer is no this does not prove the research 
methodology was flawed.
If when looking at the experimental method you can clearly identify flaws, for example bias in the data, 
then there is a huge question mark over the validity of the conclusions. You can’t be certain the conclusions 
are not correct but you certainly cannot be confident they are valid. Hence the huge question mark!
However if some detail is missing from the description this is not the same as clearly identifying an error. 
Researchers should report all important aspect of their work including, where relevant, how the participants 
were randomly allocated to groups. However failure to report this does not mean the participant were not 
randomly allocated. Failure to report some detail such as this can lead us to have small doubts over the 
validity of the conclusions but this is not the same as identifying clear flaws in the methodology.
There is also a difference here regarding journals papers or conference papers. Journal papers can often 
be larger than conference papers – sometimes 30 or 40 pages long. When papers are this long then there 
is no excuse for not properly reporting the details of the research.
Conference papers, by comparison, are often shorter. In some cases they are very short. Some conferences 
limit the length of research papers to 6 sides or less. When a researcher has such a severe limit on the 
word length of their paper they will unavoidably reduce the level of detail in their reporting and thus 
some important detail may be missing.
Missing out this detail in these circumstances is unavoidable and while this may lead to some small 
questions over the validity of the conclusions the researcher should not be unduly criticised.
7.8	
Flawed Discussion of Results…
If flaws are found when evaluating the experimental methodology, and this includes flaws in the analysis 
of the data, we can immediately reject the conclusions however if the methodology is sound the discussion 
of the results could still be flawed as negative aspects of the results could be ignored.

An Example Discussion of the Results
Activity 6
Consider the research scenario below and decide if the claims made regarding what the results show is fair.
Previous researchers have developed automatic stopping systems for cars. Cameras in the car are connected to 
computers and these use vision recognition to detect if a child is crossing the road. If a child is detected the car will 
automatically brake.
For obvious reasons the system was tested in a laboratory, under a range of test conditions, and the researchers measured 
the accuracy of detection and detection speed. Current detection accuracy is 98% and the detection speed is 0.1 second.
Obviously a detection rate of 98% is not perfect but then a 100% detection rate is not likely to be possible. Furthermore 
to save lives a system does not need to be perfect. For a driverless car it just needs to be better than a human driver. 
Despite this other researchers wanting to improve on this work developed a new system. They tested this under identical 
conditions in the same lab and found that the new system has an accuracy of 99.99% but a slower detection speed of 
1 second.
The researchers state that the results show the new method is more accurate than the old method. 
Is this a fair and accurate discussion of the results?

Feedback 6
The researchers are correct in stating that the new method is ‘more accurate’ but this is not a fair discussion/reflection 
of the results. The new method also has a slower detection speed and in a real system detection speed would be critical 
for safety.
Researchers have a reason to be biased and make their research sound more impressive than it really 
is. The more impressive their research is the more they are likely to gain recognition for their work and 
the more likely they are to gain funding for further research.
Researchers may therefore overlook the limitations of their results and this can lead to unjustified 
conclusions.
7.10	
False Positives verses False Negatives
Activity 7
Consider another scenario.
A burglar alarm is created that detects most burglars but has a false negative rate of 5%…in other words it detects 95% 
of burglars but fails to detect the other 5%. 
The alarm also has a false positive rate of 0.5%…in other words 0.5% of the time, when people pass the house the alarm 
goes off incorrectly.
In order to catch more burglars researchers trying to improve the system and create a new alarm which has a false 
negative rate to only 0.1%. In other words the new system will now catch 99.9% of burglars…this is much improved 
over the previous detection rate of 95%. As the new alarm is more sensitive the false positive rate is also increased 
however. This goes up from 0.5% to 3%.
The researchers state that that despite the increased false positive rate these results show a much improved alarm as it 
will now detect 99.9% of burglars and this is a significant increase in the old detection rate of 95%. 
Is this a fair and accurate discussion of the results?
Feedback 7
To determine if the new alarm is better or worse than the old alarm we must consider the number of incidences i.e. the 
number of people who pass the house each day and the percentage rate of burglars.
Imaging a scenario where the house is in a very busy but low crime area. Thus 1000 people pass the house each day 
but of these only 1% are burglars i.e. 10 of them. The old system would catch 95% of these burglars so 9 of them would 
have been caught but 1 may have managed to get away. The new system will catch 99.9% of them i.e. it will probably 
catch all 10. However the number of false alarms will also rise.
Of 990 innocent people passing the house the old alarm would have gone off 5 times (a false positive rate of 0.5%) but 
the new alarm will go off 30 times (a false positive rate of 3%). 
The massive number of false alarms will not only waste time it will render the system so ineffective it would probably 
get switched off.

If you don’t follow all of the maths in the example above don’t worry about it. The lesson to be learnt 
from this is that if an experiment is conducted properly and the results are accurate it does not mean 
that a researcher’s explanation of the results is a fair reflection of what those results show.
When evaluating research one of the steps involved is therefore to look at the results presented in the 
paper (either presented as numbers, presented as a graph or presented in a table format) and to consider 
is the researcher’s discussion of those results is fair.
7.11	
Unjustified Conclusions…
Finally if the research methodology is sound and the discussion of the results is fair it does not mean 
that the researcher conclusions are fully justified. 
The limitations of the experiment could be overlooked, e.g. the small sample size or the specific nature 
of the organisation used in a case study, and valid conclusions could be overgeneralised making them 
no longer justified by the evidence.
7.12	
An Example of a Researchers Conclusions
Activity 8
Consider the following scenario.
Action research is conducted to show if changing the sales approach by the sales staff in a car showroom will have a 
positive impact on sales. Staff are then trained to reduce sexist attitudes and the cost of this training is measured. 
The results show that by reducing the sexist attitude of the sales staff they are much more effective when selling cars 
to woman and sales increase by 10%, and this despite the small cost of the training causes a significant increase in 
profit margins. 
The researchers conclude that sexist attitudes in sales staff significantly impedes sales and improved staff training can 
have a significant impact on profit margins.
Evaluation of the research shows it was conducted meticulously and the results show what the researchers claim 
they show. 
Only one question remains for you to consider now: are the conclusions fully justified given this evidence?
Feedback 8
At first glance the researcher’s conclusions sound plausible however no consideration is given here to the nature of 
the organisation i.e. car sales. It is possible that in another business having sexist staff may have no effect on sales. 
Imagine staff working in a women’s clothing boutique…would it matter if they were sexist against men when they are 
not trying to sell to men?
Whatever the research study the last step in evaluating the research is to evaluate the final conclusions 
to check that these are fully justified by the evidence and not overly generalised.
Researchers can be lured into making overly grandiose claims as this makes the research seem 
more impressive.

Accepting Conclusions as Valid
So before we accept conclusions we must critically evaluate the evidence…
Was the method used for the experiment scientifically sound? 	
Were the results accurately and fairly reported?	 	
	
Were the conclusions fully justified by the evidence? 	
	
If the answer to all of these is yes then we accept the conclusions are valid.

Bad science kills! 
If you want to gain a deeper understanding of bad science which will help you when critical evaluating research, then

One Additional Thought…
The tobacco industry, the petrochemical industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the alternative 
medicine industry are all big businesses. Annually these businesses combined are worth billions or 
trillions globally, and they all have powerful lobby groups.
Sadly good science has been deliberately undermined by big business for financial gain.

Summary
In this chapter we have seen that science is essential but that an element of scepticism is needed.
We have discussed the potential for flawed conclusions to be made in research (accidentally or deliberately) 
and thus we need to evaluate:-
•	 the methodology
•	 the reporting of results and
•	 the claims or conclusions reached. 
We have looked at numerous ways research methodology can be flawed including:- 
•	 Confounding Variables
•	 Complexities with Comparative Studies
•	 Badly Randomised Groups
•	 The Order Effect
•	 The Placebo Effect 
•	 Correlation/Causal Confusion 
•	 Surrogate Outcomes:
•	 Data Not Cleaned 
•	 Poor Data Collection
•	 Biased Data (Accidental)
•	 Biased Data (Deliberate)
And we have seen that big businesses can gain from deliberately undermining good science.
By evaluating research you can:-
•	 Point out flawed research and thus potentially save lives,
•	 Suggest new avenues for research by suggesting ways valid methods and ideas can be combined 
and thus you can make a contribution to science,
•	 Give positive affirmation to properly conducted research and thus encourage others to apply 
the research findings where appropriate. 
Ultimately the purpose of this chapter is to help you gain the skills to accept or reject the claims others 
make by looking at the evidence and applying sound scientific reasoning to determine if those claims 
are valid. 
These skills are useful not just when evaluating research but also when making important life decisions.

Introduction
In the previous chapters we tried to develop an understanding of research and develop practical skills 
that will help you to write a research paper:-
•	 Firstly to understand that writing a paper requires you to evaluate research, compare theories 
and to present your own conclusions.
•	 We looked at a breadth of research being done, across numerous subjects, to help you develop 
ideas for your paper. 
•	 We looked at how to find a cohesive set of research papers so you will be able to find the 
papers you need.
•	 We looked at actual research papers to develop your understanding of the contents.
•	 We tried to develop an understanding of research methods, experimental design and bad 
science so you will have the skills to evaluate the methods, the discussion of results and the 
claims researchers make.
From now onwards the focus of this book will move away from understanding research and will instead 
focus much more on the act of writing your research paper.
As the topic of plagiarism is essential we will look at this first. 
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will understand:-
•	 How applying citations and references properly is essential to ensure you are not accused 
of plagiarism
•	 How to cite your sources,
•	 How to write a references list,
•	 The difference between the British and Harvard systems,
•	 And how the issue of plagiarism has an impact on the contents of a survey paper.

Plagiarism,  Citation s a nd Reference
Research builds upon the work of previous researchers so you will need to refer to their work. This is 
perfectly acceptable if you follow some simple rules:-
•	 If you use any words that are not your own these words must be inside quotation marks “ ” 
and a citation must be put next to the quote to identify the source.
•	 If you use a diagram that is not your own again the source must be cited.
•	 If you take a specific idea that is not your idea but was summarised in your own words again 
the source must be cited. Remember plagiarism is also the theft of ideas.
8.2	
Citations and References
At the end of any document, including a research paper, there should be a reference list. This is a list 
of all the sources cited.
There should be a 1-1 relationship between the citations and the references i.e. if a source is cited it 
should be on the reference list and every item on the references list should be cited.
8.3	
The British or Harvard System
There are two commonly used ways of citing sources they are called the British or Harvard methods.
The British method uses numbers…[1], [2], [3] for the citations and the reference list is therefore 
numbered accordingly. Thus the citation [3] points to the third item on the reference list which will of 
course also be numbered [3].
One advantage of this method is that it doesn’t take much space to cite numerous sources and if research 
papers are very constrained in length this is a big advantage. Using the British method is therefore 
required by some conferences or journals.
One disadvantage of this method is that if you add or delete a citation all of your other citations must 
be renumbered and the numbers of the associated references must also be changed. This is a task that 
must be done carefully else a citation that should point to the third reference may incorrectly point to 
the fourth. It’s easy to make this mistake when using the British system and hard to spot and correct 
any errors.
By comparison the Harvard method uses an author’s name and the year of the publication as the citation, 
e.g. (Smith, Alison, 2010). When using the Harvard method the reference list is not numbered but is 
put in alphabetical order…this makes it easy the find the details of the paper published by Alison Smith. 
Though for this to work the formatting of the names in the reference list must be the same as in the citation 
so if the citation is ‘Smith, A.’ then the reference list should also be ‘Smith, A.’ and not ‘Alison Smith’.

Plagiarism,  Citation s a nd Reference
One advantage of the Harvard method is that it becomes easy to add or delete citations and as the name 
is in the citation and the reference list it is easy to spot and fix any errors.
One disadvantage of the Harvard method is that citations are longer particularly if the paper has more 
than one author. To keep Harvard citations from becoming excessively long when citing a source published 
by numerous authors only the first 2 or 3 names are given. The citation indicates the others by using ‘et. 
al.’ which translates to ‘and the others’.
Thus ‘(Smith, A., Jones, B. et. al., 2015)’ indicates a source published in 2015 written by 3 or more authors 
the first two of whom are called Smith and Jones.
You should not use ‘et. al.’ in a reference list but provide the names of all authors.
Activity 1
There is one very small complication with the Harvard method of citing sources…If the name of the author is part of 
the sentence then when citing a source the brackets, ( ), only go around the year.
Given this look at the following citation and correct it.
(Smith Alison, 2010) undertook research into….’
Feedback 1
In the example above the sentence does not start with ‘undertook research into’. This makes no sense. The name is part 
of the sentence so the citation should be as follows…
Smith Alison (2010) undertook research into….’
Sometimes the choice of using the British or Harvard method is left up to the author however if a paper 
is accepted for publication extremely precise formatting instruction are usually provided by the publisher 
and the author is expected to follow these. These can include specific formatting instructions for the 
citations and references.
8.4	
The Reference List
A reference list provides all of the important details regarding the sources cited in the body of your paper.
Activity 2
Assume you have been given a bill to pay. 
Look at the following details and decide which details are important and which are unimportant:-
•	
The bill arrived by post (as opposed to email).
•	
You must pay £100.
•	
The bill is to be paid your landlord for rent due.
•	
The bill must be paid within 1 week.

Feedback 2
It is irrelevant how the bill arrived. Whether by post or by email the bill must still be paid.
The other details are all important as you need to know who to pay, how much you must pay and when it must be paid by.
Just as it was not important how the bill arrived so it is not important how you obtained a research paper. 
What is important is what are the details of the research paper and where was it published.
References that refer to research papers should therefore provide the following details:-
•	 The names of all of the authors, 
•	 The year the paper was published,
•	 The title of the research paper (usually in quotes),
•	 The title of the journal or conference where the paper was published (usually in italics),
•	 The volume and page numbers i.e. exactly where in the publication is this specific paper.
Some people add additional details to a reference list but these are not required and can distract the 
reader from the important information.

Plagiarism,  Citation s a nd Reference
For example some people provide the web address where the paper can be found as this makes it easy 
to obtain the paper. However in a badly formatted reference list this can make a reference to a good 
quality research paper appear to be a reference to a low quality web source. Web addresses are therefore 
not required and can be a hindrance. 
Activity 3
Look at the reference list below, written in the Harvard format, and identify 5 errors:-
Scheme, E 2011, Electromyogram pattern recognition for control of powered upper-limb, Journal of Rehabilitation 
Research & Development, Vol. 48, pages 643–660.
Khokhar, Z, Menon, C, et. al., 2010, Surface EMG pattern recognition for real-time control of a wrist exoskeleton, 
BioMedical Engineering Online 2010, pages 1–17.
Young, A.J, Smith, LH, Rouse, EJ, Hargrove, L.J., A new hierarchical approach for simultaneous control of multi-joint 
powered prostheses, The Fourth IEEE RAS/EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics, 
Roma, Italy. June 24–27.
Feedback 3
The errors are as follows:-
•	
The references are not in alphabetical order so if the reference list is a long list it will be hard to find the details 
of the paper by one particular person. 
•	
Title of paper is not in quotes and the title of the journal is not in italics making it hard to spot where one title 
finishes and the other starts.
•	
‘et. al.’ is used in the second reference so one or more of the authors of this work are not being given the 
proper credit. 
•	
The year is missing from the third reference so it will be very difficult to track down the source of this paper.
•	
Page numbers missing from the last reference making it hard to find just the relevant pages in the journal.
A corrected reference list is provided below:-
Khokhar, Z, Menon, C & Xiao Z G, 2010, ‘Surface EMG pattern recognition for real-time control of a wrist exoskeleton’, 
BioMedical Engineering Online 2010, pages 1–17.
Scheme, E 2011, ‘Electromyogram pattern recognition for control of powered upper-limb’, Journal of Rehabilitation 
Research & Development, Vol. 48, pages 643–660.
Young, A. J, Smith, L H, Rouse, E J, Hargrove, L.J., 2012, ‘A new hierarchical approach for simultaneous control of multi-
joint powered prostheses’, The Fourth IEEE RAS/EMBS International Conference on Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics, 
Roma, Italy. June 24–27, pages 514–520.
Note in the reference list above web addresses, where the paper can be downloaded from, have not been 
provided and the title of the journal or conference is clearly highlighted in italics. This makes it easy for 
the reader to see that good quality research sources have been used.
In the example above we have seen how to reference research papers. Other rules exist for referencing 
other type of published materials e.g. newspapers, web materials, audio materials etc.

These are less likely to be useful when writing a research paper and are not covered here but are covered 
in the following book:-
Cite Them Right: The Essential Referencing Guide (Palgrave Study Skills) by Richard Pears 
and Graham Shields, 2013.
8.5	
The Impact of this on the Body of Your Research Paper.
Regarding citations and references there are two important considerations when writing the body of 
your research paper:-
•	 All sources must be properly acknowledged.
•	 It must be clear which parts of the paper represent your analysis and which parts are your 
summary of research done by others.
Activity 4
Look at the following 4 paragraphs, taken from a survey paper provided in section 1.1 of appendix 1, and identify 
which paragraphs describe research done by someone else and which paragraph present this authors evaluation of 
the research described:-
“Anastasia, et. al (2012) proposed a technique of 
achieving a robust image steganography using a high 
payload method and edge detection, where hybrid edge 
detector is derived by unifying the fuzzy edge detector 
and the sobel and the Laplacian filters for simplicity, this 
method does not compute the real edges in an image 
but distinguishes between the sharp and smooth areas 
of the image so as to hide more secret data bits into the 
edge pixels. In this method, as well as the secret message, 
two property files which contain information regarding 
extraction of the secret message are also encrypted using 
3-DES with the secret key provided by the user during the 
embedding process.
The experiments carried out to test this algorithm used 
the same images used by Chen et. al (2010) for their image 
steganography scheme, this is used in order to enable 
seamless comparison of both techniques, although 
they used colored images while Chen et. al (2012) used 
grayscale images. Factors used for comparing the two 
schemes included the hiding capacity in bits divided by 
three, the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) is also measured, 
a higher value of PSNR is considered better. Figure 1 below 
shows the result of comparing this method and that of 
Chen et. al(2010).

Plagiarism,  Citation s a nd Reference
Based on the results presented above, Anastasia, et. al. 
(2012) claimed that there method which uses a hybrid 
edge detector together with the sobel and laplatian 
filters to enable embedding additional secret messages 
in the edge pixels outperforms the hybrid edge detection 
method proposed by Chen et. al. (2010).
The result of evaluating this method showed that colored 
variants of the image set used by Chen et al (2010) were 
used in the experiment, these image set are used in many 
other image steganography experiments, making it a good 
choice. The experiment is repeatable due to the fact that it 
is the most widely used for testing image steganography.
The use of colored variants of the images in the experiment 
with the new method might not give an accurate 
representation of the performance when compared to 
the method of Chen et. al., (2010) which uses grayscale 
variant of the same images, the use of encryption as 
part of the algorithm may also cause potential issues 
with performance and may cause significant change in 
the size of the stego image as compared to the original 
cover image, testing the new algorithm with only one 
other method might also not give an accurate measure of 
its potential performance as compared to other current 
algorithms in the market and those proposed in current 
research papers.”
Feedback 4
You cannot present your analysis without first giving the reader appropriate information on the work you are analysing. 
Thus the first three paragraphs above describe research done by Anastasia, et. al. (2012). These paragraphs describe the 
aims of the research and some details of experiments. The results of the experiments were also presented, in figure 1. 
Finally the third paragraph describes the claims made by the researchers.
So these three paragraphs are all descriptions. None of this is quoted. To save space it is all summarised in the author’s 
words, and the sources are cited. Lots of details are missing but full details of the source research paper are provided 
in the reference list so if the reader wants more details of the work done by Anastasia, et. al (2012) they can find the 
original paper.
The fourth paragraph above is different. This is not the work of Anastasia, et. al. (2012) but this is the analysis done by 
Muhammad Hussaini, the author of this survey paper. In this final paragraph the author provides their evaluation of the 
way the experiments were performed and they then present their own conclusions based on this analysis.
Apart from citing all sources properly it should be clear which parts of your paper describe and summarise 
the work of other researchers and which parts present your analysis and your conclusions. 
One easy way to make your analysis stand out a little is to put this in a separate paragraph.
As a survey paper evaluates the work of many research papers the descriptive parts will be very short 
and lack lots of important details but this is OK as these details should be in the source papers.
It should still be clear which parts are summaries of the work done by others and these parts will have 
lots of citations.

The Difference between a Reference List and a Bibliography
In books you may find a bibliography. A bibliography is not a reference list and should not be confused 
with a reference list.
A reference list is a list of sources cited. 
A bibliography is a list of sources used but not cited.
If you take a specific idea from a researcher then you must cite the source and provided details of the 
source in the reference list. For example Anastasia, et. al. (2012) claim that their method outperforms 
an alternative method proposed by another researcher. This is a specific claim made by a specific source 
and the source should be acknowledged. 
A bibliography is used where you may have taken a general idea but do not want to give credit to a specific 
person for that idea. For example imagine that when writing an essay you read a book that explains 
why the weather is difficult to predict. You could have found the same information from numerous 
other books and therefore do not want to credit the author of the book with this general information. 
In this case you would describe the general idea in your own words. You would also list the book in a 
bibliography but you would not cite the source in the body of your essay.

A bibliography is therefore a list of sources where you have obtained useful general information which 
you summarise in your own words but where the information is so general you do not want to credit 
that information to a specific author. 
A bibliography is a way to acknowledge the source of your information without giving them the credit 
for information that could equally have come from other sources.
Of course if the author of this book then gives you specific ideas on how to improve weather predictions 
systems then the author should be given credit for these specific ideas and thus if this information is 
summarised in your essay the source should be cited and the book listed in the reference list.
If you do quote words, take a diagram, or take specific information you must cite the source and put 
the details in a reference list.
Bibliographies are commonly used when writing essays but should be avoided when writing a research 
paper as when writing a research paper you will be evaluating specific research.
Bibliographies and reference lists are not the same and should not be confused.

Summary
In this chapter we have discussed…
•	 How using citations and references properly is important to ensure you are not accused 
of plagiarism.
•	 How you must cite the source if a) you use any words that are not your own, and these words 
must be inside quotation marks b) if you use a diagram that is not your own and c) if you use 
a specific idea that is not your own even if this is summarised in your own words.
•	 How there should be a 1-1 correlation between the citations and the references
•	 The differences between the British and Harvard referencing methods.
•	 We have seen how the reference list must show all importation information and should be in 
alphabetical order if using the Harvard system.
•	 We saw how the body of your research paper should be structured clearly to distinguish 
between places where you describe the work done by others and places where you present 
your own analysis. 
•	 And finally we looked at the difference between a bibliography and a reference list.

9	 Practising Academic Writing 
Introduction
In the previous chapter we have looked at the standards expected in academic writing and in particular 
looked at how sources should be cited and how a reference list should be presented.
We will now focus on the skills required to write the content of your paper in particular we will consider 
how to present well-reasoned objective arguments as opposed to presenting subjective personal opinions 
or beliefs.
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will have had the chance to practise your writing skills and in particular:- 
•	 practise writing a critical evaluation, 
•	 practise writing a comparative analysis 
•	 and practise considering how theory can be applied.
This chapter consists of 6 sections:-
1)	 Moving from Opinion to Reasoned Argument
2)	 Presenting Relevant Conclusions
3)	 Considering Critical Evaluation
4)	 Practising Comparative Analysis
5)	 Practising Application of the Theory
6)	 Summary
9.1	
Moving from Opinion to Reasoned Argument
You may well have been told that in academic writing you should not present your personal opinions 
and should avoid using the word ‘I’. At the same time you may have been told that you are expected to 
present your conclusions. 
If you are to present your conclusions is it not therefore reasonable to write ‘I believe…’, ‘I think…’ Or 
‘In my opinion…’?
The instructions you may have been given could seem contradictory and confusing. 
Here we will look at how you can avoid personal opinion and avoid using phrases such as ‘I believe’ and 
yet still present your conclusions.

Activity 1
Think about a gadget, hobby, sport or holiday destination you really like and write one or two sentences to express 
your feelings.
Feedback 1
A valid answers for this could have been…‘I like the Harry Potter films’ or ‘In my opinion the Harry Potter films are great.’
Whatever the subject you may have written something that uses phrases to express your feelings…‘I like…’, ‘In my 
opinion…’ Or ‘I feel’ are all valid phrases here.
Telling a friend what film, hobby or sport you like could persuade them to see this for themselves especially 
if they know their tastes are similar to yours…on the other hand if their tastes are very different it could 
dissuade them. Either way it is unlikely that telling a stranger what you like would persuade them at all. 
It is far better to remove personal statements such as ‘I like…’ or ‘In my opinion…’ and instead present 
a reasoned argument (see example below):
The Harry Potter films present a story about the struggle to be honourable and brave in the 
face of fear, a plot that appeals to both adults and children. The world portrayed in these films 
is imaginative and rich in detail (e.g. ghosts that interact and have social lives etc.) and this is 
well demonstrated by the special effects. These are therefore very good films.

Activity 2
Rewrite the statement you made above by removing the personal element, i.e. remove any use of the word ‘I’, or ‘in my 
opinion’ and instead present an objective and dispassionate reason why the ‘thing’ is good. Try to write this is such a 
way that the conclusion you have reached does not depend on personal opinion or taste.
Ask a friend to review your statement and confirm that this does not present a personal subjective opinion.
Feedback 2
Your friend will hopefully be able to give you feedback on this.
9.2	
Presenting Relevant Conclusions 
So far the conclusion you have reached is just that ‘something is good’ but this should now be based on 
sound reasoned argument. 
Having presented a reasoned argument and removed personal opinion you are far more likely to persuade 
someone to our point of view but we could make much better use of this argument by using it to make 
specific recommendations or reach specific conclusions. The more specific and relevant we can make 
our conclusions the more useful and impressive they are likely to be. 
Activity 3
Reread the statement below:-
The Harry Potter films present a story about the struggle to be honourable and brave in the face of fear, a plot that 
appeals to both adults and children. The world portrayed in these films is imaginative and rich in detail (e.g. ghosts that 
interact and have social lives etc.) and this is well demonstrated by the special effects. 
Now consider the following conclusions that could be reached about the Harry Potter films:
a.	
These films are therefore films most people would enjoy. 
b.	
These films are therefore films many people would enjoy and are recommended to people who have not yet 
seen them.
c.	
These films are therefore good family entertainment and are recommended to parents with children, unless the 
people concerned particularly dislike films about fantasy or magic. 
Look at each of these conclusions and decide which of them you find most persuasive.
If you are working with a friend ask them to complete the same exercise and compare your answers.

Feedback 3
The first thing to note about these conclusions is that they do not stand alone. Without justification these conclusions 
lack any merit. The conclusions follow on from the reasoned argument presented earlier and must be completely justified 
by the arguments made. 
Regarding the first conclusion, ‘These films are therefore films most people would enjoy’. You may have struggled with 
the word ‘most’. ‘Most’ means more than half and there is no justification presented here to show that more than half of 
the population would enjoy these films. 
You may have therefore felt the second conclusion had a better justification as this only concluded that ‘many’ people 
would enjoy them though the recommendation here is very wide ranging i.e. they are recommended to everyone ‘who 
has not yet seen them’. That is a lot of people!
In the third conclusion the recommendation is significantly more limited. The films are only recommended to parents 
with children…and not even all of those. This is not to say others would not enjoy the films it’s just that they are being 
specifically recommended for this particular audience.
There are two specific lesson here:-
1)	 The conclusions must be justified by the arguments made.
2)	 Wide ranging conclusions, while they may have a wider potential impact, are more difficult to 
justify and can be less persuasive.
Activity 4
Rewrite and extend the reasoned argument you wrote earlier about a hobby gadget, sport etc by adding a conclusion 
that is as specific and as persuasive as possible yet still applies to a number of people.
Ask a friend to read this and give you feedback on:
1.	
The conclusion, is it clear, specific, unambiguous and does it apply to many people?
2.	
Is your conclusion persuasive and fully justified by the reasoning presented above?
Feedback 4
Hopefully a friend will be able to give you feedback on your reasoned argument and conclusion.
From this you should see that presenting good reasoned argument can justify conclusions and conclusions 
that are specific and well justified can be useful and persuasive. They should certainly not be based on a 
personal point of view and therefore there is no need to use phrases such as ‘I believe’ ‘I feel’ or ‘I think’.
While you presumably believe your conclusions are valid they should be justified by evidence and well-
reasoned argument. It is irrelevant that you believe them and using a phrase such as ‘I believe’ detracts 
from the objective reasoned argument you should present.
If you want to emphasise that these are your conclusions a better phrase would be ‘I therefore conclude 
that…’ But still the use of the word ‘I’ can be avoided here.

One alternative phrase that avoids the use of the word ‘I’ is ‘The conclusion is therefore reached that…’. 
From the writing it can be made clear that this is the author’s conclusion i.e. you can make it clear that 
these are your conclusions but conclusions you have reached based on well reasoned argument. 
The purpose of writing a research paper is to present your analysis and meaningful conclusions. It is 
these conclusion that make your paper worth reading. An important part of this is to ensure that these 
conclusions are based on sound reasoned argument and not personal opinion or bias. Hence we have 
considered how to move away from personal opinion to present reasoned argument and how to present 
meaningful conclusions.
When writing a survey paper your analysis will come from three aspects:-
•	 Critical evaluating individual research papers,
•	 Comparing the methods or theories proposed by different researchers
•	 And considering the application of these theories in real world situations
We will practice two of these aspects of writing shortly.

Practising Academic Writing 
9.3	
Considering Critical Evaluation
Critically evaluating research is the hardest and most substantial of these tasks. It requires an understanding 
of research theory and requires an evaluation of the experimental methods, the discussion of results and 
ultimately an evaluation of the claims researchers make.
As this is such a significant topic chapter 7 was devoted to this and these skills were practised in sections 
7.6–7.12 but you can continue to practise these by writing some evaluative text.
Activity 5
If you want to practise your critical evaluation skills further you can either:-
1.	
download a research paper and evaluate the methods, discussion of results and researchers claims, 
2.	
or you can practice your critical evaluation skills on a real life situation. For example consider a policy that is being 
proposed by a politician or consider an expensive product e.g. a luxury car being sold. Consider the evidence 
presented by the politician or salesperson, is the evidence sound? Does the politician or salesperson present a 
fair analysis of this? and are their conclusions sound? 
Write a paragraph or two to describe the evidence and the claims made (in doing this avoid any analysis or judgement 
by yourself – just stick to a factual description).
Then write one paragraph where you present your evaluation of the evidence and the claims made and finish this 
paragraph with your conclusion i.e. do you conclude that the claims made are valid or false?
Feedback 5
Ask a friend to read your description and answer the following questions.
a.	
is your description clear and factual?
b.	
have you presented clear arguments with your conclusion at the end? Note your conclusion should always come 
after the analysis. Putting the conclusion first with the reasons following implies bias.
c.	
are your arguments based on an objective analysis or personal opinion – or are they somewhere in between?
d.	
have you managed to avoid using personal terms such as ‘I think’ ‘I believe’ or ‘in my opinion’.
9.4	
Practising Comparative Analysis
A comparison can also lead to specific conclusions. Thus as well as reaching conclusions by evaluating 
a piece of research we can reach meaningful conclusions by comparing different theories, methods and 
ideas proposed by different researchers.
Activity 6
Read the comparison below and then answer the questions that follow:-
1.	
Identify one similarity between the items being compared
2.	
Identify one difference 
3.	
Identify the conclusions and ask a) is this justified by the comparison b) is this conclusion very general or is 
the conclusion more specific i.e. is there a clear and specific message here that could have an impact in a 
specific situation?
4.	
Given the conclusion go back and look at the comparison. Are any parts of this comparison not relevant to the 
conclusion? If so could this comparison be shortened by removing some of the detail?

The Harry Potter films are much more recent than Alfred Hitchcock’s film ‘Rear Window’, 
which was released in 1954, and there are many clear differences including the genre, fantasy 
or thriller, the intended age of audience and the use of, or lack of, special effects. Yet there are 
also clear similarities: both include ordinary characters, e.g. children or a person with a broken 
leg, that the audience can empathise with. Both plots also move forward at a reasonable speed 
and both include moments of real tension e.g. moments when the lives of main characters are 
at risk. Therefore when writing new films, irrespective of the genre, authors are encouraged to 
focus on developing characters the audience can relate to and developing plot lines that have 
moments of significant tension.
Feedback 6
1.	
This comparison highlights clear similarities:- characters the audience can empathise with, moments of tension, 
reasonably paced plots.
2.	
This comparison also highlights clear differences:- the genre, age of the film and use of special effects.
3a.	 Very importantly the conclusions are directly related to and justified by the comparison presented earlier.
3b.	 The conclusion is also reasonably specific. It is specific to a group of people i.e. budding film authors and the 
recommendations made are also quite specific i.e. irrespective of genre create characters the audience can relate 
to and developing plot lines with tension.
4.	
The description and comparison of these films is already quite short but could be shorter still. In the comparison 
above there are parts that are not directly used in this conclusion i.e. the age of the films, use of special effects 
and speed of plots. Thus we could have made this comparison a little shorter by removing some of this detail 
yet still provided all of the required information needed to justify the conclusion.
Similarly we could have made our comparison longer and more detailed by comparing the number of actors in the films, 
the age of actors, language used in scripts or any other aspects of the films but we need to ask if this extra detail is relevant. 
Comparing the age of actors etc is not relevant to the conclusion and therefore this should not have been added to 
the comparison.
Comparing script devices etc could however have been very relevant. This would have taken our analysis to a much 
deeper level and possibly have allowed us to make specific recommendations on how to create moments of tension. 
This would have therefore added real value to the conclusions.
A comparative analysis can lead to meaningful and useful conclusions but the conclusions must be 
justified by the comparison.
By comparing the methods, ideas and new theories proposed by researchers you can reach specific 
conclusions and this is one way your survey paper can make a valuable contribution to science.
The deeper the comparison and the more insightful our conclusions are the more value we add.

When comparing new methods proposed by researchers you can consider:-
•	 which method will work best? 
•	 would combining the different methods give us a method that is potentially better than either 
method in isolation? 
•	 if two methods should be combined how would this work?
•	 will the methods, together or on their own, solve the problem or do parts of the problem 
remain to be solved?
When writing a survey paper we are often constrained in word length and so should keep our descriptions 
as short as possible yet the more detailed our analysis is the more valuable our conclusions can be.
One way of resolving this conflict is to:-
•	 Write the comparison, ignoring word length, and make this as detailed and meaningful 
as possible. 
•	 Then draw your conclusions making these as specific and useful as possible. 
•	 Think carefully and check the conclusions are fully justified by the comparison
•	 and finally revise the comparison and descriptive parts to make these as short as possible by 
removing any unnecessary detail.

Activity 7
Think about the gadget or hobby or whatever else you wrote about earlier and write a short comparison between this 
and a different gadget or hobby. 
From your comparison try to reach conclusions backed up by the comparison you made and write these down as well.
Show this to a friend and ask them to give you feedback on the following:
1.	
Is the conclusion you present reasonable given the comparison?
2.	
Is there any irrelevant detail in the comparison that could be removed?
Feedback 7
Hopefully a friend will be able to give you feedback on your comparison and conclusion.
9.5	
Practising Application of the Theory
After comparing research theories another way of reaching useful conclusions is to consider the application 
of the theory to real world scenarios. By doing this you will also be able to make specific conclusions 
about how the theories may, or may not, help and who should, or should not, apply these theories.
Activity 8
Consider two cars both costing exactly the same:-
Car A is a small two seat sports car, with leather seats, fast acceleration, the ability to park in small spaces but has poor 
fuel consumption and virtually no luggage space.
Car B is a largish 7 seat car with a large luggage compartment. It is slower to accelerate but especially on motorways 
is fairly fuel efficient.
Imaging you were a car salesperson and answer the questions below…
1.	
What sort of customers would you recommend Car A for?
2.	
What sort of customers would you recommend Car B for?
3.	
Are there some customers for which neither car A or B is appropriate and if so why?
 
Feedback 8
You may consider car A to be appropriate for a young single person, in a well-paid job, especially one working in a city 
as they may prefer a small car that is easy to park. They may also enjoy the status symbol of a sports car and if they have 
no family to transport only having two seats will not be a problem. 
You may decide to recommend car B for families with a number of children especially those that use the car for holidays 
and therefore do a fair amount of motorway driving.
There are other customers for whom neither car is ideal e.g. customers who have only 1 or 2 children but who want a 
large car with a powerful engine that can safely tow a caravan or customers who want a small fuel efficient car for local 
about town driving.
By considering the use of these cars we can make specific recommendations. In doing so we are not saying that one car 
is better than the other just that each is useful in some circumstances but less useful in others.

Considering practical and specific situations will allow you to consider if and where it is best to apply 
new theories proposed by researchers. 
A researcher may have developed a new method and shown through testing that this method works 
but that does not mean it will work well in all situations. By considering different situations and how 
the proposed new method works you can make specific recommendations, backed up by well-reasoned 
argument, about when others should apply the new method or when it should be avoided.
By considering the application of new research theories to situations the original researchers may not 
have considered you can reach useful conclusions and make a contribution to knowledge. 
9.6	
Summary
In this chapter we have practised the academic writing skills that are important when writing a research 
paper. There are many good books on this subject that you can read if you wish to take this subject further.
In particular you should now see that:-
•	 Presenting your opinions is much weaker than presenting reasoned argument and when 
presenting reasoned argument you should write this to avoid personal statements e.g. I 
believe…, I feel…, I think… In my opinion…
•	 Reaching specific conclusions is worthwhile and these can be persuasive but these must be 
backed up by well-reasoned argument.
•	 Reasoned argument and useful conclusions can come from evaluating research i.e. to determine 
which researchers conclusions are valid and which are not.
•	 We can also reach useful conclusions by comparing different research theories or proposed 
methods i.e. to determine which methods or theories are best, or to determine if there are 
benefits from integrating these (but if so how is this to be done).
•	 And we can reach useful conclusions by considering the application of theories and methods 
to real life scenarios and thus we can make recommendations regarding the application of 
these new theories or methods.
When presenting good written work it is not enough to summarise what you have read. You must 
also present your analysis and your reasoned argument. This is the value you add by analysing your 
subject matter. 
It is by presenting your reasoned analysis and your well-argued and justified conclusions that makes the 
effort in reading your work worthwhile.

10	 Drafting a Research Paper 
Introduction
You should by now have the skills needed to find a cohesive set of good quality research papers and the 
skills needed to understand the research methods used by the researchers. 
You should have a good understanding of research theory and have practised applying your knowledge 
to the act of critical evaluation.
In the previous chapter you practised the skills needed to write about research and present a reasoned 
analysis covering three different aspects that will allow you to present valuable reasoned conclusions:-
•	 By critically evaluating individual research papers,
•	 By comparing the methods or theories proposed by different researchers
•	 And by considering the application of these theories in real world situations.
We will now focus on a process you could follow to help you write your own research paper.
Later chapters of this book as will focus on the skills needed to write specific sections of a research paper 
e.g. the introduction, the body and the abstract. This chapter will focus on the overall process.
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will understand the process drafting and refining a research paper. You 
will see how you can make a real start by focusing on the first easy steps and how you can tackle the 
harder parts one section at a time. You will also understand how a critical friend can help you.
This chapter consists of 17 sections:-
1)	 A Path Through the Forest
2)	 Drafting, Drafting, Drafting
3)	 A Day Starts by Getting out of Bed
4)	 Define General Structure and Headings
5)	 Write a Rough Introduction in Note Form
6)	 Add One Descriptive Section (i.e. summarise one research paper)
7)	 Add the Other Descriptive Sections
8)	 Evolve and Refine the Structure of Your Paper
9)	 Draft the Evaluation Sections

A Path Through the Forest
You may have walked on paths through a forest.
You may have also noticed in places where there is no proper path but where a well worn track has been 
made by previous walkers.
If a route taken by a few walkers is poor then other walkers will find a different route and the plants 
damaged by the first walkers will re-grow and the route they took will disappear. 
If on the other hand the first walkers find a good route through the forest other walkers will follow the 
same route and over time the track taken will become well worn and clearly evident to other walkers.
Thus well worn tracks are evidence that many walkers have used that route and these are often good 
ways of getting through a forest.
Path makers don’t usually create paths just because they think a path in a particular place would be 
useful. Instead they look for well worn tracks and turn these into proper paths. 
Thus good paths evolve over time.
The story you tell when writing your research paper is the path you create through the forest. The research 
papers you have found are the trees. The path is the coherent story you tell that flows and makes sense 
of the research.

Drafting a Research Paper
Activity 1
Imagine if you received a visitor from abroad, someone who knows nothing about your nearest large city. Now imagine 
they want to visit this city alone for a day.
Consider two completely different stories you can tell them about this city if a) they want to go shopping or b) they 
want to visit the main tourist highlights.
1.	
What would you tell them about first?
2.	
What would be the main things you want to tell them about if a) they are going shopping b) they want to visit 
the main highlights?
3.	
What would you tell them about in the end?
4.	
What would you not tell them about?
Feedback 1
If I was to introduce someone to London I would start by explaining how to get into the city, the structure of the city 
centre and how to get around the city.
If my visitor wanted to go shopping I would tell them about Oxford street, Bond street and Mayfair where they would 
find the most impressive shops. I would also tell them about Covent Garden where they can find imaginative arts and 
crafts and about Notting Hill where they would find interesting markets.
If my visitor wanted to visit tourist attractions I would tell them how to get to Buckingham Palace and the Tower of 
London. I would tell them where the big museums and art galleries are and where to get a cruise on the Thames.
I would finish by making sure my visitor knew how to get home safely.
There is so much that I wouldn’t say either because it isn’t relevant or just because I wouldn’t want to overload my visitor 
with too much information. Whole districts in London would not get mentioned. Neither would I mention about the 
night life nor would I overload them with information about less important attractions or shopping areas.
Whatever story you tell is up to you to decide. It is up to you to decide a) how your story starts, b) what 
are the main points you want to get across (and in what order) and c) how you want your story to end.
10.2	
Drafting, Drafting, Drafting
Whatever story you decide to tell it must flow well and be easy to follow. To achieve this, like a good 
path, the story must evolve over time. 
Just as there are many paths through a forest, each with its own start and end point, so there are many 
stories you can tell using a set of research papers.
It often does not matter where your introduction starts, nor will you have a specific set of conclusions 
to reach. The story you tell is for you to create.
What does matter is your story must make sense. Like the path the starting point must be clear, the flow 
must make sense and each step of the journey must be logical. To do this your path, your story, must 
evolve over time.

Drafting a Research Paper
No matter how careful you are and how detailed your plans are you cannot write a good paper by starting 
at the beginning and working through each section in fine detail until you get to the end. 
Your paper must iterate through a process of continual improvement. In other words it requires initial 
plans, very rough drafts, more drafts and refined drafts. In the early stages the structure may change 
radically. In the final stages each step of the story you tell must be fine-tuned.
The story is yours to tell and while is requires multiple drafts it is reasonable to have a general idea where 
you want to start and where you generally want to end up.
By iterating and revising your paper you can make sure the flow of your paper makes sense and each 
step of your reasoned argument is logical.

A Day Starts by Getting out of Bed
You may have heard the phrase ‘A journey starts with a single step’ similarly a day starts just by getting 
out of bed…. Let’s explore that process a little.

Drafting a Research Paper
Activity 2
Consider the following options and choose which you feel best describes your approach to life.
When you get out of bed do you:-
1.	
live from one moment to the next without making any plans at all?
2.	
briefly plan the main things you need to do that day, revise these plans if required as the day progresses, and 
leave the more detailed planning for each major event until that event becomes confirmed?
3.	
plan the day in great detail from beginning to end before you start doing anything?
Feedback 2
If you don’t plan the day at all you are unlikely to achieve much on the other hand if you plan each step in fine detail 
before you do anything at all you run the risk of a) never getting started and b) wasting effort planning events in detail 
that will never happen.
Option 2 is perhaps the most sensible approach to life.
Planning your writing requires a similar approach to planning your life. 
There is a risk that you will see the task of writing a research paper as a huge and daunting task, one 
so scary that you will never start. 
Rather than focussing on the mountain that needs to be  
climbed instead take the first few steps.
Take the first few steps, then the next few steps and soon you will have made a real start.
So don’t plan your paper in endless detail. Instead:-
1)	 make initial plans…they will change anyway. 
2)	 then start filling in little bits of your paper…i.e. take the first few steps
3)	 fill in a few more bits and see your paper start to take shape.
4)	 look at your planned structure and, like a path, let it change and evolve as it needs to
5)	 Continually draft and refine your paper as is goes.
Don’t delay – take those first few steps today!
By focusing on the next small step you start to make real progress and the whole task becomes less 
daunting.
Don’t start on the difficult bits. Don’t even think about the difficult bits. Take each task one step a time 
and the whole thing becomes manageable.

How to Write a Research Paper

Drafting a Research Paper
You can break the task of writing your survey paper into the following steps:-
•	 Define the general structure i.e. the headings for each section of your paper
•	 Write a rough introduction in note form 
•	 Add descriptive sections (i.e. describe the research)
•	 Draft evaluation sections
•	 Draft a comparative analysis
•	 Draft your conclusions
10.4	
Define General Structure and Headings
Start by giving your paper some structure. Looking at the title of your paper and the research papers 
you are using as your sources try to decide what the major sub topics are and which papers fit into each 
sub topic.
Don’t discard papers that are a little off topic – we will learn how to deal with those later.
Once you have identified the major sub topics decide what order you want to tackle these in your paper. 
Then create headings for each of the sections of your paper.
After your paper has covered these topics in isolation you may want to a) compare the theories, b) consider 
application of the theory to different real world situations and c) and present your final conclusions. 
These sections of your paper will also require suitable headings.
Thus your survey paper may start with a structure similar to the following:-
•	 Introduction
•	 Research topic A
•	 Research topic B
•	 Research topic C
•	 Comparing theories A-C
•	 Considering application of the theories
•	 Conclusions
Obviously the heading should be specific to your specific paper and the structure can and should change 
as you refine your ideas.

Write a Rough Introduction in Note Form
The parts of your paper where you present your evaluation and reasoned argument are the hardest parts 
to write. They require real thought and this is where you will make a real contribution to knowledge but 
for now you can ignore these parts and focus on the simple parts.
So take the first real step and write an introduction in note form…don’t worry about making this a 
perfect well written introduction as it will surely need to change and evolve.
For now just make notes and keep this brief. Remember you are not writing an introductory essay but 
you are writing about advanced research. You are writing to professionals so explaining basic terms and 
concepts is not appropriate.
So in brief note form:-
•	 What is the problem your paper is trying to address?
•	 What are researchers trying to solve?
•	 What are the major topic your paper will consider?

Drafting a Research Paper
Activity 3
If you have found and read your research papers and if you have a rough idea of the structure of a paper you want to 
write then you can write your introduction now in rough draft form.
Feedback 3
There is no feedback for this activity but if you manage to do this then Well done! – you have made a real start.
Don’t worry if your rough notes look rough. Making a start is important and no matter how good your first draft is it 
will still need revising and changing.
10.6	
Add One Descriptive Section (i.e. summarise one research paper)
Still avoiding any complex parts of your paper you can start the body of your paper by summarising the 
research described in one of the papers you have read i.e. write a few short paragraphs to:-
•	 Describe the problem the researchers are trying to solve
•	 Describe their methods
•	 Describe their experiments and results and
•	 Describe their conclusions.
This summery should be all descriptive and should not be hard to write.
Ensure you cite your source in your summary and add the details of the paper to your reference list.
Add your summary to the correct section the body of your paper.
10.7	
Add the Other Descriptive Sections
You can continue to build up the body of your paper by repeating the step above and summarising each 
research paper adding its summary to the relevant section of your paper.
By the time you have finished this some sections of your paper should then contain the descriptions 
of several research papers. Other sections, e.g. the comparative analysis and your conclusions will still 
be blank.
You can leave a few blank lines after each section that describes research as this will be where you will 
add your evaluation.

Evolve and Refine the Structure of Your Paper
As your paper takes shape consider the flow of the topics and the section headings. 
•	 Do your section headings reflect the papers/topics covered in each section? 
•	 Are you tackling the sections in the right order? 
•	 Do small sections need merging?
•	 Do large sections/topics need segmenting into several sub sections?
Let your paper structure evolve as you refine your ideas and go back and refine your introduction 
accordingly.
10.9	
Draft the Evaluation Sections
After drafting the introduction and the descriptive parts of your paper you are now in a position to start 
adding your analysis.
Remembering by evaluating the methods, discussion of results and conclusions you can reach your own 
conclusions about the validity of the researcher’s conclusions. 
So evaluate one of the research projects, write up your evaluation and add this to your paper immediately 
after your summary/description of this research. 
You can take one research summary at a time, evaluate this, add your evaluation to your research paper 
and repeat this process until you have evaluated all of the research projects you have described.
10.10	
Drafting the Comparative Analysis and the Application of the Theory
After evaluating the research you should now be able to compare the different theories and consider the 
application of the research to real world scenarios and add these sections to your paper.
10.11	
Draft the Conclusions
You should now be able to summarise all of your analysis and conclusions and draft your overall 
conclusions.
10.12	
Drafting the Abstract
As your paper now looks like a complete draft you should now be able to draft an abstract summarising 
the work your paper.

Refine, Refine, Refine
As this stage you should have a rough draft of your complete paper but it will still need to be refined, 
refined and refined.
•	 Consider the overall structure and flow:- does this need revision?
•	 Consider each section of research evaluation:- does your analysis stand up to scrutiny? Will 
a sceptical reader accept your conclusions as sound? And is your evaluation based on sound 
scientific arguments?
•	 Can your descriptive parts be refined now you know what your evaluation says?
•	 Refine your comparative analysis: – is your reasoning detailed and do your arguments 
make sense?
•	 Refine your consideration of the application of theory:- again do your arguments stand up 
to scrutiny?
•	 Refine your overall conclusions to ensure they are fully justified by your earlier reasoned 
argument and ask yourself has your analysis lead to useful specific and well reasoned conclusions 
i.e. has your reasoned analysis made a real contribution.

Feedback from a Critical Friend
It is at this point your draft paper should be looking quite good and this is where a critical friend can

Drafting a Research Paper
You want to find out how good your paper is so test the null hypothesis…i.e. ask a friend to consider 
where the weakest parts of your paper are. 
•	 Where is the flow of ideas poor?
•	 Where are the headings unclear or vague?
•	 Where is the description poor?
•	 Where are the weakest points of your evaluation and reasoned argument?
Getting a friend to give you feedback on the problems can be very helpful in making your paper better.

Your Own Brain Can Trick You
Activity 4
Your mind is powerful and can make sense of garbage!
To prove this try to read the message below:-

Feedback 4
Some people can make sense of this but don’t worry if you can’t. Not everyone can and you will probably struggle if 
English is not your first language.
A translation of this message is as follows:-
“I couldn’t believe that I could actually understand what I was reading. The phenominal power of the human mind, 
according to research at Cambridge University, it doesn’t matter what order the letters in a word are, the only important 
thing is that the first and last letter be in the right place.
The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without a problem. This is because the human mind does not read 
every letter by itself, but the word as a whole. Amazing, eh? And I always thought spelling was important! And for those 
of you with more time on your hands than others, you will notice that not only are most of the words a mess but some 
of them are completely misspelt as well!”
Some people can read this text and this shows how powerful the mind is.

Drafting a Research Paper
When you read your brain is not trying to read every word and every letter. Instead your brain is trying 
to make sense of the sentence.
This causes a problem when you are trying to fix grammatical and logical errors in your written work. 
When you re-read something you have written your brain actively tries to ignore the errors to extract 
the meaning and thus the text will make sense to you. You ‘see’ what you expect to see – you don’t see 
the text exactly as it is written i.e. you won’t see the errors unless you can force your brain to slowly 
check each small part of the sentence. 
Your own brain can trick you into believing your written work is error free.
One way to make it easier to spot errors is to review a printout of your work. 
A printout of your work makes it look sufficiently different and it becomes easier for your brain to spot 
the errors.
Re-reading it when you are less familiar with it also makes it easier to spot errors. 
Thus before you submit any written work always check it, one final time, by looking at a printout – 
preferably several days after having written the text.
10.16	
Check Formatting, Citations and References
Finally check the formatting, citations and references all satisfy any given instructions.
Papers which are to be published must match the formatting striations carefully. This takes time, care 
and attention to detail.
If you are working to a deadline you must allow sufficient time for the final edit.
10.17	
Summary
In this chapter we have discussed how:-
•	 You should not be daunted by the whole task of writing a research paper but should instead 
take one step at a time.
•	 You should focus on the first simple steps and start writing quickly.
•	 You can’t plan each section in detail before you start instead your paper must evolve as you 
refine your ideas.

•	 As your paper evolves so the structure, headings and introduction will change.
•	 Getting feedback from a critical friend is essential.
•	 Checking a final version on paper and allowing time for the final edit is also important.
If you have been doing all of the exercises in this book you may already have the structure of your first 
draft planned and a draft of your introduction written…If so well done!
The following chapters of this book will focus on how to write each section of your paper in more detail:-
•	 The introduction
•	 The body of your paper
•	 The conclusions

Writing an Introduction
11	 Writing an Introduction
Introduction
In the previous chapter we looked at the process of writing a research paper. 
In this chapter we will focus on writing the introduction. Writing a good introduction to a research 
paper is not the same as writing a good introduction to an essay.
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will have been able to consider what makes a good introduction and test 
your understanding of this.
This chapter consists of 4 sections:-
1)	 An Introduction as a Funnel
2)	 Using Those Less Relevant Papers
3)	 Considering Two Introductions
4)	 Summary
11.1	
An Introduction as a Funnel
In chapter 3 we considered how to find a cohesive set of research papers and how to choose a title for 
your research paper. We saw that the title needs to reflect the purpose of the paper, which is to present 
your analysis and evaluation of current research, and importantly the title should be focused and reflect 
the narrow subject matter.
In looking at this we considered one good example of a title that reflects both the purpose and the 
focus:- ‘A Critical Evaluation of Current Neural Network Theory for Number Plate Recognition Systems’.
So the title of your research paper should already be focused and clearly it should reflect the subject 
matter of your paper. 
However while the title should reflect the subject matter covered in the paper it may not perfectly reflect 
the focus of the body of the paper.

211 
Writing an Introduction
Consider the set of research papers you are working from. These will not be all of the possible research 
paper you could have used. Clearly you will have rejected papers that are not relevant to your title but 
there will be other relevant papers that you simply didn’t find or didn’t have time to read. Therefore you 
will be working on a subset of the possible papers. 
There may also have come across some papers that don’t seem quite as relevant as others.
Consider the cluster diagram below:-
 
A large cluster 
of relevant 
papers grouped 
into 4 sub 
clusters or sub 
sets 
A small cluster of 
partly relevant 
research papers 
Research Papers Organised into Clusters. 
This diagram shows a large set of relevant research papers that have been organised into 4 smaller clusters 
i.e. 4 sub sets. The large set represents the most relevant papers found which a researcher has chosen to 
base their paper on. The diagram also suggests that the paper will have 4 subsections and indicates the 
number of papers that will be discussed and evaluated in each of these subsections.
The diagram also indicates some less relevant research papers. These are not research papers that have 
been rejected as being irrelevant. Instead these are papers that are generally relevant i.e. they fit within 
the topic however they are papers that the researcher has chosen not to focus on. 
There could be many reasons why you would choose not to use some papers that are still relevant 
given your paper title…perhaps because they are a little old and discuss a now discredited theory or 
perhaps you could only find one paper on that particular sub topic or perhaps you just want to focus 
on a different area.

212 
Writing an Introduction
For whatever reason you may have rejected some papers that are relevant but are not quite on the area 
you wish to focus your discussion on. 
We will see how we can use these less relevant papers shortly.
For now we will just note that the papers you wish to focus on are a subset of papers that you could 
have used. 
Given this your research paper title may not perfectly capture the focus of the body of your paper. This 
is perfectly OK and it does not mean your title needs to be changed. 
You do not need to define a title that is so precise it includes only those papers you wish to discuss and 
excludes all of the others.
Instead however you should recognise the existence of the other papers, i.e. the related research that 
is being done within the overall area, but focus the readers mind on the particular area you wish to 
concentrate on.
Thus your introduction needs to act like a funnel.
Research Paper Heading  
Main Body 
The introduction should focus the 
reader on a very narrow topic – 
probably narrower than that 
defined by the heading alone. 
 
What is the problem? 
 
What research is being done to 
solve that problem? 
 
What is the focus of this specific 
paper? 
11.2	
Using Those Less Relevant Papers
In chapter 4 we discussed the aim of research being to add a piece of knowledge to the existing body of 
human knowledge and by analogy we are trying add a brick to a wall of knowledge.

Writing an Introduction
Your research paper is trying to add one brick to the wall. This does not just sit on top of other bricks – 
it has bricks at either side and this needs to be reflected in your introduction.
Your introduction should explain the aim of your paper to your readers and thus it needs to explain the 
purpose of your paper, i.e. the brick you are trying to place. It should also explain where in the wall this 
brick goes i.e. where it fits related research.
Thus you should not just bin the less relevant papers you have found. Instead you should, in your 
introduction, briefly explain the research that is related to your paper.

Writing an Introduction
By mentioning the related research you show where in the wall of knowledge you are trying to add your 
brick. This shows a wider understanding on your part and helps to improve your paper by allowing the 
reader to see where your research fits into the existing body of knowledge.
Your discussion of related research should be very brief. You should not describe the research nor do 
you need to make any effort to evaluate the related research. Your purpose is only to show to the reader 
that related research is being done and to briefly explain how this relates to your work.
While you are only mentioning the related research in passing, i.e. very briefly, you must still cite the 
sources and add the details of these papers to your reference list.
11.3	
Considering Two Introductions
We have discussed how your introduction should explain the purpose of your research paper and focus 
the readers mind on the specific topics you are discussing and evaluating. In doing this your introduction 
should also mention research that is related to yours.
Activity 1
Rather than getting you to practise and develop your skills by asking you to write an introduction you can test your 
understanding by evaluating two previously written introductions.
Read the ‘Introduction 1’ below and answer the following questions:-
1.	
Was this introduction written with other researchers in mind?
2.	
Is it short and nicely focussed on the subject or is it too long or too wide? 
3.	
Does this introduction explain a problem and introduce the reader to research?
4.	
Does this introduction focus the reader on the purpose of this specific paper?
5.	
In short, is this a good or bad introduction for a research paper?
Introduction 1) Research into Current Internet Security Methods
The internet has become an essential part of life. People use it not just to get current news but to 
interact socially through websites such as ‘Facebook’ and to manage their financial affairs with 
online shopping and online banking etc. People also now use online health tracking applications 
that monitor health activity, location and time etc.
However as our reliance on this technology increases so does our exposure to online threats. 
Furthermore recent trends involve ever increasing use of cloud storage, where ‘data is maintained, 
managed and backed up remotely and made available to users over a network (typically the 
Internet)’ (www.whatis.com), means that more of our personal data is not stored at a secure local 
physical location and our risks are even greater.

Writing an Introduction
Recent evidence has shown security breaches and hundreds of millions of records stolen in the US 
(www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2014-data-breaches).
Security protection is therefore critical to prevent hackers from gaining and abusing confidential 
information. 
The following are all steps users can take to protect themselves:- 
•	 Use anti-virus software
•	 Install firewalls
•	 Avoid pirated software
•	 Using strong passwords
•	 Beware of internet phishing
•	 Ensure data is transmitted in an encrypted format.
This paper will explore each of these and aims to make specific recommendations for users wishing 
to stay safe online.
Feedback 1
This introduction may be a good introduction for an essay but it is a very poor introduction for a researcher paper and 
there are several clear reasons why this is the case.
1.	
Was this introduction written with other researchers in mind?
Firstly this introduction starts by explaining our ever increasing reliance on the internet – and of course we all 
know this. It also inappropriately defines terminology i.e. ‘cloud storage’. Not everyone will know what cloud 
storage is and in an essay defining terms like this is fine. However computer professionals doing research to 
develop advanced internet security methods don’t need basic terminology to be defined. Thus this introduction 
is more appropriate for novices not researchers. 
2.	
Is it short and nicely focussed on the subject or is it too long or too wide? 
As an introduction this is nice and short however while this is all under one subject of internet security this is 
broken down into 6 very different subjects…and each one of these can again be broken down into smaller 
subjects. Thus while this may be a good introduction for an essay, for a research paper this is far too wide a topic.
3.	
Does this introduction explain a problem and introduce the reader to research?
The introduction does explain the problem and cites a web site as evidence – citing a web site for this sort of 
evidence is fine – however while this then introduces the reader to the sub topics it does not introduce the reader 
to research being done. Nowhere does it mention researchers who are trying to push forward the boundaries 
of knowledge and nowhere does it cite research papers.

4.	
Does this introduction focus the reader on the purpose of this specific paper?
The introduction does explain the purpose of this paper but again there is a problem here. The aim is to make 
recommendations for the public. This is not an appropriate aim for a research paper. A research paper should 
aim to evaluate current research evidence and reach conclusions by comparing and considering the application 
of advanced theories. Recommendations could come from this but these are likely to be very specific and 
aimed at other professionals and researchers. They are not likely to be general recommendations that anyone 
would understand.
5.	
In short, is this a good or bad introduction for a research paper?
This is not a good introduction for a research paper though it may well be fine for an essay.
Activity 2
Now consider ‘Introduction 2’ below and answer the same questions:-
1.	
Was this introduction written with other researchers in mind?
2.	
Is it short and nicely focussed on the subject or is it too long or too wide? 
3.	
Does this introduction explain a problem and introduce the reader to research?
4.	
Does this introduction focus the reader on the purpose of this specific paper?
5.	
In short, is this a good or bad introduction for a research paper?

Writing an Introduction
Introduction 2) Current EMG Pattern Recognition Research Aimed At Improving Upper 
Limb Prosthesis Control
The application of electromyogram (EMG) pattern recognition in the control of upper limb 
prosthesis has been a popular topic of research over the last five years. However, it is not clinically 
used due to its limited dexterity (Scheme, 2011) and EMG recordings can become unreliable over 
time (Zhang et. al. 2013) making the limbs not suitable for everyday situations. Hargrove, L.J. 
et. al. (2013) conducted research into increasing the number of EMG channels to improve the 
accuracy of the pattern recognition system without needing more electrodes. Amsuss et. al. (2014), 
Scheme (2011) and Zhang et. al. (2013) provide research into making prosthesis more clinically 
viable and allowing the user more intuitive control. 
EMG pattern recognition could offer the user more control of the prosthesis, including allowing 
them to gain more movement and control of the force they put into their movements, as it will 
learn how the EMG changes depending on the user’s intent (Khokhar, Z et. al. 2010). 
This research paper will focus on studies that have been carried out on using EMG pattern 
recognition to improve upper limb prosthetics. The paper will discuss different classification 
strategies, results of the research and critically evaluate the strength of the outcome. Conclusions 
will be made throughout the paper regarding how each method will affect the prosthesis and then 
finally summarized at the end. The primary object of these papers was improving the dexterity of 
upper limb prosthesis. This paper uses the research of those that focused on improving the pattern 
recognition and artificial intelligence by looking at the classification errors and processing time.
Feedback 2
1.	
Was this introduction written with other researchers in mind?
From the title and the terminology used in the opening paragraph it is clear that this introduction was aimed 
at people who already had a significant level of knowledge in the subject. Many people would struggle to 
understand this but this is an indication that this is aimed at researchers and interested professionals. It is not 
an indication of bad writing.
2.	
Is it short and nicely focussed on the subject or is it too long or too wide? 
It is very short and has a very clear focus. 
3.	
Does this introduction explain a problem and introduce the reader to research?
Within the space of two sentences the problem is explained and research papers are cited as evidence. Before 
the end of the first paragraph 4 research projects are explained, 3 in just one sentence, with sources correctly 
cited. There is no description or evaluation here…this is just a mention of related research in passing. 
If any description or evaluation of the research was conducted this would be done in the body of the paper not 
the introduction.

4.	
Does this introduction focus the reader on the purpose of this specific paper?
The purpose of this paper is explained, i.e. to evaluate ‘how each method will affect the prosthesis’ and while is 
not explicitly stated it is reasonable to presume that this research paper will reach new and specific conclusions 
or make specific recommendations that will prove informative either for other researchers wanting to improve 
the methods further or for those involved in manufacturing or fitting a prosthesis. In other words it is expected 
that his research paper, by its evaluation of the methods, will make its own contribution to the development 
of prosthetics.
5.	
In short, is this a good or bad introduction for a research paper?
In short this is an excellent introduction.
Activity 3
The second introduction above was taken from one of the three research papers in appendix 1.
Take a look at the other two introductions as see if you think these are appropriate for a research paper.

Feedback 3
While these introductions are all written to make then as easy to read as possible they are all short, focussed and presume 
the reader will have a certain level of knowledge. 
They all introduce the reader to research being done in a specific area, citing research papers, and they all explain the 
purpose of this specific paper. 
They all imply that the analysis presented makes a contribution to our knowledge of the subject.
These are all good introductions.

Summary
In this chapter we have seen that writing an introduction to a research paper is not the same as writing 
an introduction to an essay.
We have also seen that a well written introduction should:-
•	 Be short and focussed and written for professionals and researchers.
•	 Act like a funnel and focus the reader on a very narrow topic – probably narrower than that 
defined by the heading alone.
•	 Highlight a problem caused by the limitations of human knowledge, citing evidence where 
possible, and introduce the reader to research being done to overcome that problem.
•	 Explain the aims of this specific paper highlighting the work that will be done in this paper. 
This highlights the analysis and evaluation to be done i.e. it explains how this paper hopes to 
make a positive contribution to knowledge in that subject.

12	 Writing the Body of a Paper and 
the Conclusions
Introduction
In the previous chapter we considered how to write a good introduction to a research paper. This chapter 
will focus on how to write the body of the paper and the conclusions.
To write a good research paper requires the ability to:- 
•	 find relevant research papers, 
•	 critically evaluate research, 
•	 perform a comparative analysis and 
•	 consider the application of the theory. 
These skills were all practised in chapters 3, 7 and 9 with associated theory and understanding being 
developed in chapters 1 to 6.
To write a good research paper also requires an understanding of plagiarism and the application of 
proper citations and referencing methods as practised in chapter 8.
Chapters 9 and 10 allowed you to practise your academic writing skills and consider the process of 
drafting your research paper.
In this chapter we will assume you have an understanding of all of this material and we will only consider 
how this material comes together to form the body of a research paper. 
In other words this chapter will just consider the look and feel of the final product and thus this chapter 
will be quite short and simple…you have really done all of the hard work in the proceeding chapters.
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will have considered each section of a research a paper focusing on the 
analysis that could be presented in that section and you will have considered ways to test the quality of 
a research paper you may write.

12.1	
Considering the Structure of Your Paper
In chapter 10 we saw how a research paper must go through a series of drafts so it can evolve into a well 
structured document where each step of the reasoning process is clear and well reasoned. 
Activity 1
Presented below are the headings from three research papers. These headings describe the structure of these 
research papers.
Consider these headings for each of the 3 papers and answer the questions below:-
1.	
Are the headings clear, well worded and specific to the paper?
2.	
Do the structures of the papers flow in a logical manner? 
3.	
Is it clear from the headings that the papers do more than just summarise the information in the source 
research papers?
4.	
Do the research papers end with a ‘Conclusion’?
5.	
Are the references a numbered section?
6.	
Are there any differences in the way the papers are structured?
Paper 1) An Evaluation of Information Hiding Techniques Using Image Steganography
1.	 Introduction
2.	 Evaluation of Current Steganography techniques

Feedback 1
All of these three research papers are presented in full in appendix 1. These are all good examples of the application of 
the theory taught in this book.
1.	
Are the headings clear, well worded and specific to the paper?
All of the headings are clear but some of the headings are very general and could apply to any research paper. e.g. 
‘Introduction’. There is no reason why the first heading needs to be just ‘Introduction’ but neither is this a problem.
If all of the headings were the same this would be a problem. Imagine a paper with the following headings:-
	 Introduction
	 Research theory
	 Evaluation of theory,
	 Comparison of methods,
	 Conclusions
These headings would be problematic as they give the reader no clue as to the content or subject matter covered 
in this specific paper.
The headings presented in the examples do give a clear indication of the detail of the content covered in 
the specific paper, e.g. ‘Evaluation of Current Steganography techniques’, ‘Linear Discriminant Analysis’, 
‘Emotional Aspects’.
2.	
Do the structures of the papers flow in a logical manner? 
Yes

Writin g t he B ody of  a Pap er and  the Conclusion
3.	
Is it clear from the headings that the papers do more than just summarise the information in the source 
research papers?
Some of the headings specifically highlight the work done in this specific paper…e.g. ‘Evaluation of…’, 
‘Comparison of…’
Other headings don’t do this and just highlight the subject covered e.g. ‘Simultaneous Parallel Approach’, ‘Aspects 
of Personality Development’. 
Either way it is important that each section of the paper does more than just summarise the material read. Each 
section should present the authors reasoned argument.
4.	
Do the research papers end with a ‘Conclusion’?
The papers don’t end with a ‘Conclusion’ section – they end with ‘Conclusions’
This small difference, ‘s’, is important and we will discuss this later.
5.	
Are the references a numbered section?
While it is critical to present a properly formatted list of references it is not part of the discussion or body of the 
paper. References are presented as a list at the end – hence this section is not numbered.

Are there any differences in the way the papers are structured?
There are differences in the structures, most notably paper 3 has subsections and the others do not. It is up to 
the paper author to decide on an appropriate structure for their specific paper.
In the examples above:- Paper 1 only uses a very few headings, Paper 2 presents a list of topics covered and 
Paper 3 presents a list of topics covered but organises these into sub sections.
Larger documents, e.g. books, require sections, subsections and sub-subsections to provide an appropriate 
structure. Shorter research papers have less need of subsections, and rarely need to use sub-subsections at all, 
however should still use subsection where appropriate.
As the 3rd paper considers 4 different aspects of personality development the author presented these as 
subsections.
When using subsections a paper should first introduce the section before starting the subsections, as paper 3 
does (see appendix 1).

The following research will be split up into four different sections which will…
However you structure your paper its flow, like a path over a stream, must make sense to the reader.
Your path must lead the reader from a clear explanation of the problems and issues, as presented in the 
introduction, to the proposed solutions, as presented in the conclusions.

12.2	
Considering Your Evaluation Sections
In the body of your paper you should of course be describing and evaluating research.
In doing this you should avoid judgemental language 
e.g. ‘this research was flawed…’ 
and instead present a professional judgement leading to a reasoned conclusion. 
e.g. ‘The researchers claim…however the experiments fail to consider the possibility of…
therefore additional testing is required before we can be sure of the validity of these claims. 
or…
The researchers tested a wide range of users taken from a random sample and the results show 
sufficient evidence to justify the claims made. 
Remember your purpose is not to criticise the researcher written English or the depth of their literature 
search but to determine if the researcher’s conclusions are valid. 
Activity 2
Consider the section of a research paper presented below and answer the following questions:-
1.	
Can you identify which paragraphs describe the research?
2.	
Looking at this can you identify a) the experimental work conducted b) the results and c) the original researcher 
conclusions?
3.	
Can you identify where the evaluation starts?
4.	
In the final paragraph has the author evaluated the researcher’s conclusions or are they going further?
A section taken from ‘An Evaluation of Information Hiding Techniques Using Image 
Steganography’ by Muhammad Hussaini
The experiment carried out by Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) was performed in order to gauge 
the performance of the proposed image steganography algorithm on the basis of its security, 
imperceptibility and feasibility. Randomization of the position of the stego-image which carried a 
secret message of size 2bpp and was embedded in the cover image ensured that a visual inspection 
of both the stego and cover image does not unveil the difference between the images. The histogram 
of both the cover and stego image was calculated, as well as the difference which shows that there 
is no significant difference between the two images as shown in figure 2 below.

Writin g t he B ody of  a Pap er and  the Conclusion
The experiments they carried out measured the image histogram, the similarity measures were 
also calculated and presented based on existing units of similarity measure – the mean square 
error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity index (SSIM). The 
results of the experiment was also compared with three (3) current transform domain based image 
steganography schemes by (Raja et. al. 2008), (Souvik and Gautam, 2012) and (Gandharba and 
Saroj, 2012), this were chosen due to the fact that they all used colored images for their experiments, 
this enabled direct comparison of these schemes with the proposed scheme. The comparison table 
is shown in figure 3 below. 
Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) concluded that their proposed algorithm is superior to the algorithms it 
was compared to, they also presented evidence that showed they achieved a good imperceptibility 
measure based on the two units of similarity measure, which are PSNR and SSIM index, as well 
as having a high secret key sensitivity.
The research carried out by Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) was rigorous due to the fact that there 
proposed method was tested against attack from different steganalysis methods which use LSB 
replacement, the methods include the Chi-Squared Test (Westfeld Andreas, 2000), Weighted-stego 
analysis (Fridrich and Goljan, 2004) and Sample Pair analysis (Dumitrescu et al, 2003). 
Results have shown that the method is effective against these techniques of steganalysis, although 
more test will need to be carried out to ascertain its strength against other forms of attack such as 
statistical steganalysis which are also very popular. The choice of 3D Cat map is applauded due to 
its sensitivity to even small changes in secret key used. Although, the application of a transform 
domain technique and the randomness of the choice of bits where data is hidden proves effect, the 
transform domain is known to cause reduction in the quality of stego-image produced

1.	
Can you identify which paragraphs describe the research?
The first 3 paragraphs presents a detailed description of the research conducted by Ghebleh and Kanso (2013).
2.	
Looking at this can you identify a) the experimental work conducted b) the results and c) the original researcher 
conclusions?
a.	
The first paragraph explains the reasons for the research and explains how the experimental work was 
conducted. This description continues into the second paragraph. Part of this comparison highlights how the 
methods used by this researcher compared with the methods proposed by other researchers…‘ (Westfeld 
Andreas, 2000)…(Fridrich and Goljan, 2004) and…(Dumitrescu et al, 2003)’.
b.	
The actual results are presented in figures 2 and 3. Parts of the text explain these results without making 
any judgments e.g. ‘…which shows that there is no significant difference…’
c.	
The researchers conclusions are presented in the third paragraph…‘Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) concluded 
that their…’
All of this is descriptive. None of this is this author’s evaluation.

Writin g t he B ody of  a Pap er and  the Conclusion
3.	
Can you identify where the evaluation starts?
The evaluation starts in the 4th paragraph with ‘The research carried out by Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) was 
rigorous due to the fact that…’.
The author is concluding that the researcher’s conclusions are valid though they don’t use these exact words. 
This paragraph could have been rewritten so the arguments are presented first and the conclusion is presented 
at the end of the sentence. If you start a sentence by making a claim that research is not valid this could cause 
the reader to disagree with you before you have given them a chance to hear your reasons. It is therefore better 
to present your reasoning first.
4.	
In the final paragraph has the author evaluated the researcher’s conclusions or are they going further?
In the final paragraph the author is not evaluating the validity of the researcher’s conclusions. Here they are 
considering how effective the technique is. This is really an element where they are considering not the validity 
of the theory but the application of the theory.
Consideration of issues like this can allow the research to reach conclusions about who should apply the theory 
and when it should be applied…or indeed if it is worth applying this method or theory under any circumstances.
Activity 3
Consider the one short paragraph below and answer the following questions:-.
1.	
This is part of the evaluation of some research described earlier in the paper. Do you note anything different 
about this evaluation?
2.	
This paragraph includes a citation – Does this look like the authors arguments or does this look like they are 
just summarising an argument presented in the paper cited?
A section taken from ‘Current EMG Pattern Recognition Research Aimed At Improving Upper 
Limb Prosthesis Control’ by Molly Sturman
This study did not test online control; however, there have been many other studies, such 
as Hargrove, L.J. et. al. (2011), which gives evidence of a strong correlation between online 
controllability and classification accuracy.
Feedback 3
In this paragraph the author is commenting on one limitation of the research conducted but notes that this limitation 
is not important as other studies have shown this correlation.
When evaluating research it is perfectly valid to cite other research papers that show related results. These results may 
help to confirm or contradict this researchers findings.
Doing this shows that this author has an understanding of related research and can use evidence presented on other 
papers when presenting their reasoning however care must be taken when presenting arguments such as this. When 
citing other papers with related evidence it is important that you are still clearly presenting your reasoned argument 
not just summarising an argument presented elsewhere.
In this case this author makes good use of evidence presented on other papers as part of their evaluation of this research. 
This is therefore very good work.

Writin g t he B ody of  a Pap er and  the Conclusion
A large part of the body of your research paper should be devoted to describing research:- the methods 
used, the experiments conducted, presenting the results and presenting the researchers conclusions. 
Keeping all of this as short as possible and making sure the sources are correctly cited.
A critical part of this is to present your evaluation of this work:-
•	 Were the methods/experiments conducted sound? 
•	 Was the discussion of the results fair?
•	 Do the results and evidence justify the claims reached?
Use the evidence to drive your discussion forward presenting your own reasoned argument and repeat 
the above for all of the research you wish to evaluate.
12.3	
Considering Where You Compare the Theories
There are no fixed rules on how you should structure your paper and it is possible to compare the 
research theories within the evaluation sections of your paper. However it can be worthwhile at times 
to devote a specific section of your paper to presenting your comparison of the theories as this work is 
different and the types of conclusion reached are also different.
Here we are not interested in what theories are proven we are interested in which will work best therefore 
at this point a description and evaluation of the way experiments were conducted is not relevant.
These sections should instead describe the theories, and by comparing these, reach conclusions by 
considering the similarities and the differences.
Activity 4
Consider the section below and identify where the author is reaching conclusions based on their comparison.
A section taken from ‘Current EMG Pattern Recognition Research Aimed At Improving Upper 
Limb Prosthesis Control’ by Molly Sturman
6. Comparison of Pattern Recognition Techniques
The research evaluated throughout this paper all had an aim to improve upper limb prosthesis 
using EMG pattern recognition. The methods all had advantages and limitations stated in their 
conclusions and results allowing comparisons to be made for a recommendation for the most 
appropriate method.

Writin g t he B ody of  a Pap er and  the Conclusion
The conditional parallel approach had advantages of low classification errors, as the results by 
Young, A. et. al. (2013) show that they had lower errors in both discrete and combined movements. 
This is a significant advantage as low classification errors will provide fewer problems for the user. 
LDA does also have a low classification error, shown both by Young, A. et. al. (2013) and Chu, 
J. et. al. (2007), although not as low as the conditional parallel approach. It does, however, have 
a very quick processing time which will provide a more intuitive prosthesis for the user. Research 
into methods extending from LDA and improving the real life application may make it a more 
suitable option, however. 
The research by Wurth, S.M., Hargrove, L.J. (2013) showed that, whilst simultaneous pattern 
recognition had advantages of high completion percentage and lower overshoot percentage over 
sequential pattern recognition in combined motions, there was the disadvantage of it having 
a slower performance in the discrete motions, whilst being equally efficient otherwise. The 
simultaneous approach is inferior to the other methods analysed as it shows no significant or 
consistent advantages in improving upper limb prosthesis.
The results all show that all three methods analysed have limitations, such as real life application 
or online control, which require further study to allow fully intuitive results.

Writin g t he B ody of  a Pap er and  the Conclusion
Feedback 4
The comparison started by highlighting all the researchers had the same aim.
It goes onto to note that one method will cause fewer problems for the user and explains why this is the case.
It also explains why one method is inferior to the others.
This author is therefore presenting their own conclusions based on their comparison of the methods proposed by the 
different researchers and the reasons for each of these conclusions is presented.
Just as this author has evaluated the work of other researchers so the reader of this paper can decide for themselves 
whether or not this author has presented sufficient argument to justify their conclusions.
It is worth highlighting the final paragraph. The final paragraph points out the limitations of the theories when applied 
to real life situations and suggests that further research is required. This again is another example where the author is 
considering how well the research theory will apply in a real world situation.
12.4	
Considering the Application of the Theory
As well as evaluating the research and comparing research theories there is another way of reaching 
valid and useful conclusions. This is by considering how well the research theories will work in real 
world situations. 
These could be general situations e.g. you could show that a theory will never work fully and more 
research is needed. 
Alternatively situation could be very specific e.g. you could argue that certain theories will work well 
under very specific situations but not well in others.
The more detailed and more specific your analysis the more scope you have to reach impressive 
conclusions.
General statements, such as ‘more research is needed’, can easily be made and are not particularly 
impressive. This particular statement could be improved by identifying a specific area where further 
research is needed and by providing a good justification for this. 
Of course if the original researchers highlight an issue requiring further research and you echo their 
statements then this is not a conclusion you have reached from your analysis. 
You don’t make a contribution to knowledge by summarising or repeating what you have read but you 
can make a contribution to knowledge by considering in detail how well theories proposed by other 
researchers will work in specific situations.

Writin g t he B ody of  a Pap er and  the Conclusion
We have already seen examples where conclusions have been reached by considering how well the theories 
will apply in real world situations…‘Results have shown that the method is effective against…more tests 
will need to ascertain…the application of this theory proves effective but is known to…the results show that 
all three methods have limitations such as…’
When planning the structure of your paper it is up to you to decide whether or not this part of your 
analysis should occupy a separate section of your paper or if this analysis should be contained within 
other sections. 
Placing it in its own section can highlight this work and concentrate your mind to ensure this analysis 
is as detailed and impressive as possible.
12.5	
Considering the Conclusions
Finally we need to consider the last section of your research paper.
Your paper starts with a single ‘Introduction’ not with ‘Introductions’ should it therefore end with a 
section called ‘Conclusion’ or ‘Conclusions’?
Activity 5
If the last section of your paper is called ‘Conclusion’ does this imply your paper has a single final section or does it 
imply you have only reached one conclusion?
If the last section of your paper is called ‘Conclusions’ does this imply your paper has a several final sections or does it 
imply you have reached several conclusions?
Which of these titles emphasises your achievements?
Feedback 5
If the last section of your paper is called ‘Conclusion’ it implies that this is the conclusion of your paper…the end. It does 
not imply you have reached any useful conclusions.
Alternatively if the last section of your paper is called ‘Conclusions’ this cannot imply it is the ending as your paper cannot 
have multiple endings. The word conclusions implies you have reached multiple conclusions. This emphasises the results 
of the analysis you have done. In other words it emphasises your claims to have made a contribution to knowledge.
Ending your paper with a ‘Conclusions’ section therefore emphasises your achievements.
Activity 6
Consider the following section taken from the conclusions of one of the research papers in appendix 1 and decide if 
the conclusions reached are fully justified by the text shown below.
If the answer to this question is ‘no’ then where would you expect the justification for these conclusions to be?
Finally answer the following question. Should all of the conclusions go in the ‘Conclusions’ section of your paper or 
should they go somewhere else?

A section taken from ‘Positive and Negative: Effects Video Game Use Can Have on Personality 
Development’ by Shaun Watson
4. Conclusions
…From our research we can conclude that playing violent video games consistently can result in 
a decrease in empathic concern and prosocial behavior although they allow an individual to vent 
their built up anger without consequence. 
There are many aspects of the effects that video games can have on personality that we have not 
looked at in this research, we have only covered a very minute section of the potential research 
that could be conducted but the research covered is important as it exposes the fact that video 
games do have an effect on personality, positively and negatively. 
Finally, we can see from this research that video game use can result in an increase in cognitive 
abilities, provide social interactions with others, provide emotional help and possibly an increase 
in academic performance which in turn could result in an adolescent becoming more motivated 
and intelligent and improve various life skills such as decision making and problem solving.

The conclusions presented in this text are not justified here. The analysis and justification for each of these is presented 
in the body of the research paper.
Throughout the body of your research paper you should be presenting your reasoned analysis and the fully justified 
conclusions that come from this. This reasoned argument must be strong enough and sound enough to stand up to 
scrutiny by a sceptical reader.
This discussion will be detailed and interspersed with descriptions of research and theories.
Thus your conclusions should come throughout the body of your paper not just in the final section.
Your ‘Conclusions’ section allows you to summarise and bring together your individual conclusions and leave the reader 
with a clear impression of the results of all your analysis.
This is made simpler as the detail and the justification can be ignored here…if the reader wants to question the validity 
of your conclusions then they can read the body of your paper.
12.6	
Testing the Quality of Your Paper
There are three ways to test the quality of your research paper:-
1.	 If someone reads your conclusions will it be clear to them that you are presenting conclusions 
you have reached…of course it should be…or are you just summarising what other researchers 
have said?
2.	 Secondly do your conclusions make a real contribution to knowledge? They don’t need to be 
earth shattering unless you are claiming to be Einstein but you should be making clear and 
specific claims that others will find useful. 
3.	 Finally by checking each part of your reasoned argument check that your conclusion are fully 
justified. Check that your arguments demonstrate sound scientific reasoning and that they would 
convince a sceptical reader.

Summary
In this chapter we have considered the structure of a research paper. We have considered how the 
discussion must flow like a path that is easy to follow.
We have considered the sections where you present your evaluation of the research and in doing so 
how you must describe research aims, experimental methods, results and the claims researcher make. 
We have seen how our evaluation must consider each aspect of this i.e. were the methods sound, the 
discussion of the results fair and were the claims fully justified?
We have seen how we can cite evidence from other research papers to help us present our evaluation. 
We have seen how a comparison of theories can lead to specific conclusions.
We have also seen how we can consider the application of theory applies and reach conclusions from this. 
We have seen why our paper should end with ‘Conclusions’ not a conclusion.
Finally we have considered three tests we can apply to assess the quality of our research paper.

13	 Writing an Abstract
Introduction
We have now considered how to write the introduction, body and conclusions to our research paper. 
We will now focus on how to write a good abstract.
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will have been able to evaluate good and bad abstracts and in doing so 
test your understanding of what makes a good abstract.
This chapter consists of 3 sections:-
1)	 An Abstract Is Not An Introduction
2)	 Good and Bad Abstracts
3)	 Summary
13.1	
An Abstract Is Not An Introduction
An abstract is a summary of the entire research paper including the conclusions. For this reason the 
abstract should be written after the paper is finished.
From experience it seems that many students are aware of the difference between an abstract and an 
introduction and yet they often write poor abstracts. 
There could be a simple reason why students write abstracts that read more like introductions…Research 
paper abstracts are put at the start of the paper. Thus they can be mistakenly treated as the first part of 
the paper to be read i.e. they can be treated as if they were the introduction.
This chapter aims to give you the skills to write a good abstract.

Consider the following summary of the book Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. 
This story is about a boy Harry Potter, who at the age of 11 finds out he is a wizard and that a scar on his forehead was caused 
by a dark wizard who killed his parents. Harry goes to a magical school called Hogwarts and makes good friends with two 
other children Ron and Hermione and together they have magical adventures with ghosts, centaurs, broomsticks and an 
invisibility cloak.
Now consider the following summarised version of chapter 1. 
Chapter one describes an ordinary family, the Dursley’s, who live in fear of some relatives called the Potter’s. It describes 
strangely behaving owls, tabby cats and people wearing cloaks. It finally describes several very unusual people, one of whom 
is a giant that arrives on a flying motorbike. They put a baby called Harry on the steps of a house in Privet Drive and leave.
Now answer the questions below:-
1.	
If you were to read the book without reading the first of these summaries would the book still make sense?
2.	
If you read the first summary and then didn’t read the book would the summary on its own make sense?
3.	
If you were to read the book starting at chapter 2, without first reading chapter 1, would the book make sense?
4.	
Which of these two summaries is an abstract?

Writing an Abstract
Feedback 1
1.	
If you were to read the book without reading the first of these summaries would the book still make sense? 
The book would make perfect sense without this summary. While people often read a summary of a book is 
not necessary to do so. People can, if they want, jump straight in and start reading at chapter 1 and the book 
will make perfect sense.
2.	
If you read the first summary and then didn’t read the book would the summary on its own make sense?
A summary such as this is often found on a book cover and by summarising the entire book it acts like an advert 
that a person can choose to read or ignore. The summary makes sense on its own as it summarises the whole 
book. Notice while it summarises the whole book and provides some details ‘and together they have magical 
adventures with ghosts, centaurs, broomsticks and an invisibility cloak’ it does not actually spoil the ending of the 
story by giving too much information away.
A good summary contains enough detail and summarises the entire story without spoiling the ending. 
3.	
If you were to read the book starting at chapter 2, without first reading chapter 1, would the book make sense?
Chapter 1 is not a summary. It is part of the story. If you start reading the story at chapter 2 you will not initially 
understand what is going on when you read about Harry and the strained relationship he has with his aunt 
and uncle.
4.	
Which of these two summaries is an abstract?
The first of these summaries is an abstract. It summarises the entire story and it is not part of the story. You can read 
the abstract and choose not to read the story. Alternatively you can read the story without reading the abstract. 
The abstract should be treated as an entirely separate document. A good abstract is a good summary that leaves 
the reader wanting to read the story.
By contrast chapter 1 is part of the story. Reading chapter 1 on its own will leave you with unanswered questions…
What happened next? Similarly the story will not fully make sense if you don’t read chapter 1. 
The introduction is part of the story without which the story does not fully make sense. It is not a separate 
document.
A good abstract summarises an entire research paper and in doing so it needs to contain enough detail 
about the work done in that research paper. It must summarise the entire paper including the conclusions 
without spoiling the ending i.e. without giving the actual conclusions away. By summarising the entire 
paper a good abstract will act like an advert for the paper by making it clear that the paper makes a 
useful contribution to knowledge.
While an abstract is presented at the start of a research paper, before the introduction, it should be 
treated as an entirely separate document.
Activity 2
Consider the two sections presented below, taken from a research paper, and identify which is the abstract and which 
is the introduction.

Writing an Abstract
Section 1 taken from ‘An Evaluation of Information Hiding Techniques Using Image 
Steganography’ by Muhammad Hussaini
Protecting the privacy of information for organizations, governments and individuals have become 
increasing challenging in recent times due to the increased use of computers and digital means 
of communication. Various methods of protecting information and privacy have been researched 
and developed, 
…[part deleted]…
Raftari and Moghadam (2012) also claimed that by combining Integer Wavelet Transform and 
Discrete Cosine Transform which are both transform models, a more secure image steganography 
method was achieved based on results that showed good value of Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) 
in the secret image, an acceptable visual quality which leaves the secret data unnoticed, Mean 
structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and the Histogram error (HE).
The aim of this paper is to critically evaluate and analyze current research focused on developing 
more secure methods of image steganography, models and techniques used, conclusions and claims 
reached based on experiments carried out and their results.
Section 2 taken from ‘An Evaluation of Information Hiding Techniques Using Image 
Steganography’ by Muhammad Hussaini
Steganography has become the technique of choice for hiding secret messages in a cover media, 
presenting and transmitting it as a harmless piece of content, therefore making it hard to detect 
unlike encryption. This paper provides an adept evaluation of some of the prominent image 
steganography methods, showing their strengths, weaknesses and applicability, further conclusions 
were made regarding the effectiveness and otherwise of the techniques evaluated. 
Feedback 2
The first of these is not an abstract – it is the introduction to a research paper. It starts by explain what the problem is 
about. It then describes related research and finally explains the aims of this paper (future tense as these aims have not 
yet been achieved). 
The second of these is an abstract. To make it readable it does spend one sentence explaining what the problem is. It 
does not talk about related research but just summarises the work done in this paper (past tense) and says something 
about the conclusions.
The abstract tries to be specific and detailed enough so that a potential reader of the paper can see just what was done 
without giving the actual conclusions away.

Good and Bad Abstracts
A good abstract should therefore:-
•	 summarise the work done in the research paper it describes 
•	 it should also present a summary of the conclusions in such a way that it makes the reader 
want to read the paper itself, 
•	 while an abstract should be specific it should also be relatively short.
Activity 3
Read the following 7 abstracts, numbered 1–7. Note ways in which you think the abstracts can be improved and identify 
the best abstract.
Next match each abstract with the associated comment A–G and write down the number of the abstract and letter of 
associated feedback (8H would indicate feedback H matches abstract 8).

Writing an Abstract
Abstract 1) For a paper about personalised advertising V’s privacy issues 
This research paper is to introduce the issues of privacy behind the campaigns of targeted 
and personalized advertising. Discoveries of the underlying problems will be made from a 
literature review. Methodologies and concepts of will be identified and examined in order 
create a solution. The closing section of this paper concludes that businesses should take on 
the responsibility to inform the consumer and prevent violations in order to prevent negative 
reaction and protect business interests.
Abstract 2) For a paper about Vibration problems in Hard Disc Drives
Vibration is a very huge factor affecting hard disk drives (HDD) due to the rotational movement 
of the spinning disk during usage. This paper describes an evaluation of current innovations 
to mitigating HDD vibration problem and also takes note of the methodology used to back 
up the claims made. Methods are then compared so as to recommend most effective solution 
to solving HDD vibration problem from both internal and external stand point.
Abstract 3) For a paper about fingerprint security systems
Biometric fingerprint security exhibits the use of unique human characteristics for the purpose 
of security. In fact, this kind of security measure is on top of the list for many of the users 
mainly due to its least false acceptance ratio as well as ease of use. This paper focuses on 
methods of biometric protection presently existing to see if these methods can be used on a 
laptop computer and how well the computer system will be function. Recommendations will 
be made regarding which is the best current method.
Abstract 4) For a paper about cloud computing systems
In this paper I have looked at different research papers that are looking in to ways that will 
improve the abilities of the cloud computing systems, this is a field of computing that at this 
current moment in time has the potential to become very important and key in the way that 
the computing is developed over the next coming years. Looking at new methods that are being 
devolved in the way of making everything virtual to reduce the bottlenecking in networks, 
to papers looking at how to improve the security when transferring files across from the old 
system to the cloud system. I have found that these research papers are going to be used to 
help the cloud computing improve.

Abstract 5) For a paper about Human facial recognition systems
Human facial recognition system is one of the imperative areas of research that is advancing, 
several techniques is been introduce to improve facial recognition system performance. This 
paper compares and evaluates three different techniques used to enhance facial recognition 
systems performance, these include:- fusing global and local Gabor features, Curvelete transform 
for 3D facial identification and ROI selection strategy. Analysis shows that by combining two 
of the most successful techniques will give enhanced performance. A real world application of 
these techniques is presented and based on this recommendations are made for further research.
Abstract 6) For a paper about the impact of ICT on travel behavior 
This paper describes an analysis of current research on information and communication 
technologies and travel behavior. It strives to show how the era of ICT has greatly changed 
man’s travel habits and social communication patterns. Other research papers supports this 
point of view though some disagree. I am of the view that work-related travel generally would 
be expected to be reduced by those who telecommute. Social life, on the other hand, requires 
human to human interaction where true emotions can be relayed and thus travel for thus 
is essential.
Abstract 7) For a paper about security in Cloud computing systems
Cloud computing is defined as a mode for enabling ubiquitous, convenient on demand 
network access to a shared proof of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly 
provisioned and released within minimal management effort of service provider interaction, 
(NIST, 2012). As with any other environment that deals with more clients hence more data, 
cloud environment is marred by security concerns such as denial of service, security key 
management etc. which then compromise integrity, availability and authenticity of data which 
calls for security techniques of all kinds to mitigate. In this paper we have looked at some few 
techniques which include encryption, intrusion detection systems and the Hadoop distribution 
file systems. Widjadja (2009) says encryption refers to encoding of data using an algorithm so 
that it is incomprehensible to any party in the event that data transmission is intercepted unless 
the key is known to enable decryption. An intrusion detection system is a piece of software 
or a physical appliance that monitors network traffic in order to detect unwanted activity and 
events such as illegal and malicious traffic, traffic that violates security policy and traffic that 
violates acceptable use policies (Wu, 2009). Hanson (2011) says HDFS as this security technique 
is usually referred to as, it is a highly fault tolerant system designed to run on low commodity 
hardware. Through the evaluation of this various techniques it has been concluded that more 
research can be done in the field of security of data in the cloud.

Activity 4
Next match each abstract above with the appropriate feedback below (A–G) making a note of the number and letter – 
thus 8H would indicate feedback H matches abstract 8.
A)	 This abstract talks about current technology not about research.
B)	 Neither the abstract nor the paper should present personal views, opinions or feelings as this one 
does. The abstract should explain what research was critically evaluated and analysed – not what 
it hopes to do. It should summarise the main conclusions in a way that leaves the reader with a 
desire to read the paper. It should not give the actual conclusions away as this one does.
C)	 This abstract is essentially OK though it could be more detailed – what innovations are considered? 
What methods are compared? 
D)	 This abstract reads like an introduction, it should just summarise the work presented in this paper. 
Most of this abstract is therefore not relevant. Only one sentence in the middle of this talks about 
this paper. The conclusion at the end that more research ‘can be done’ is underwhelming – more 
research can always be done.
E)	 This abstract does provide a summary of this paper but is vague in the middle – what concepts/
what methodologies/what possible solutions? Furthermore this gives away the specific conclusion 
and therefore gives the reader no incentive to read this paper.

F)	 The abstract finishes with an underwhelming statement and does not leave the reader feeling 
this paper achieves any conclusions of value. It is also written in a very personal style – avoid ‘I’.
G)	 Excellent…detailed and clear summary of the work done. Makes it clear specific and detailed 
conclusions are reached without giving the actual detail of the conclusion away. This gives the 
potential reader a clear reason to read this paper.

Abstract 5 is the best abstract for reasons provided in feedback G but abstract 2 is also fine.
The other abstracts:- use personal terms such as ‘I’, give the conclusions away, finish with underwhelming statements 
regarding the conclusions, or read far too much like introductions.
13.3	
Summary
In this chapter we have seen how:-
•	 an abstract can end up looking more like an introduction.
•	 an abstract should be treated as a completely separate document,
•	 an abstract should summarise the work done in your paper and summarise the conclusions 
with enough detail but without giving the conclusions away.
•	 the abstract should be written after you have written your paper.
•	 an introduction can be written in the future tense…it is about what the paper hopes to achieve.
•	 an abstract is past tense…this is a description of work that is complete.
•	 writing a good abstract is important if you want a person to read your research paper.
You have also had the chance to practise your skills by evaluating previously written abstracts.
In the previous chapters we looked at how to write individual sections of a research paper:- the 
introduction, the body of the paper, the conclusions and the abstract. 
You should hopefully now be in a position where you can put the skills developed into practise and 
write your own good quality paper.

a Dissertation
Introduction
We have now considered all of the skills needed to write a good quality research paper and therefore this 
book is coming to an end. However one useful topic still remains untouched i.e. how to write a research 
chapter that is part of a large undergraduate dissertation.
This chapter will consider the differences between a research paper and a research chapter and give you 
some advice on how to deal with these differences.
We will also briefly consider other issues relating to research and its impact on an undergraduate 
dissertation.
While this chapter will discuss the issues and offer some advice this chapter will not attempt to develop 
any skills and therefore this chapter will not contain any activities or feedback.
Objectives
By the end of this chapter you will have an understanding of the two main differences between a research 
paper and a research chapter and have some ideas on how to address these differences.
You will also have an understanding of some of the issues that relate research and the evaluation of the 
project outcomes.
This chapter consists of 7 sections:-
1)	 The Similarities between a Research Paper and a Research Chapter	
2)	 The Differences between a Research Paper and a Research Chapter	
3)	 The Length of a Research Chapter
4)	 The Impact of the Research on a Project
5)	 Evaluating the Impact of the Research
6)	 Practical Projects Verses Research Projects

14.1	
The Similarities between a Research Paper and a Research Chapter 
Before we consider the differences between a research paper and a research chapter, that is part of an 
undergraduate dissertation, let us first consider the similarities.
•	 Both need to consider current research and be based on a good quality literature search (i.e. 
use journal and conference papers),
•	 Both need to do far more than just summarise the information read i.e. both need to present 
your reasoned analysis and your conclusions.
•	 In both it should be clear which parts present your summary of the work done by other 
researchers and which parts present your evaluation, your analysis and your conclusions.
•	 Both need therefore to evaluate the evidence and conclusions presented by other researchers.
•	 Both need to compare the different theories and methods proposed by researchers.
•	 Both need to consider the application of the theory (though there is a difference in this aspect 
of the work that we will consider shortly).
•	 Both need to end with a conclusions section that draws together all of the conclusions reached 
in the body of the paper or chapter.
•	 Finally in both each step of the analysis and reasoning should stand up to scrutiny by a 
sceptical reader.

Considering Research as Part of a Dissertation
From looking at the similarities you may see that all of the skills developed in this book are all applicable 
to the task of writing a research chapter i.e. the ability to
•	 find a cohesive set of good quality papers, 
•	 write in appropriate academic manner,
•	 cite sources and present an appropriately formatted reference list,
•	 evaluate research evidence based on a good understanding of scientific principles and methods,
•	 compare theories,
•	 consider the application of the theory and
•	 present clear and well justified conclusions that make a real contribution.
The differences between a research paper and research chapter are by comparison very minor but still 
worth considering. 
14.2	
The Differences between a Research Paper and a Research Chapter 
There are only two significant differences between a research paper and a research chapter:-
1.	 A research chapter is usually longer than a research paper and this has a small impact on the 
written work.
2.	 A dissertation usually describes a project of some sort and in a research chapter the conclusions 
should feed into this project. This has an impact on parts of a research chapter and also has an 
impact on the final evaluation of the project.
14.3	
The Length of a Research Chapter 
As the length of a research chapter can be significantly longer than a research paper and this can have 
an impact on the way it is written.
Firstly the length of a research chapter may mean there is scope for a wider literature search and allow 
for a slightly longer and more detailed description of the research…Both of these can be improvements 
but both require care.
When writing a research paper, as the word limit is often constrained, it requires real skill to keep 
the descriptive sections as short and relevant as possible to allow as much space as possible for your 
evaluation and reasoned argument.

Considering Research as Part of a Dissertation
Providing longer and longer descriptions does not make a research chapter better. Remember the 
real contribution you make is where you present your evaluation, your analysis and your conclusions. 
Unless these sections also become better then you have not taken advantage of the looser restrictions 
on word length. 
Worse still if you waffle, repeat yourself or spend too long presenting basic information then you can 
actually be making things worse.
Of course by extending the literature search you are extending the scope for your analysis giving you 
chance to present an even stronger evaluation and stronger set of conclusions and this can be excellent.
The length of the research chapter, and in particular the length of the dissertation also requires some 
thought given to the overall structure and to ‘levels of abstraction’. This may well require more use of 
sub sections and even sub-subsections.
14.3.1	
Levels of Abstraction in a Research Paper
A research paper is short and relatively simple to structure and yet it still exhibits levels of abstraction.
Levels of Abstraction in a Research Paper 
Conclusions 
Introduction 
Body of Research Paper 
The introduction to the research paper should explain the issues and overall concepts without presenting 
any detail or complex analysis. This discussion is presented at a high level of abstraction that allows the 
reader to grasp the concepts to be covered in more depth later…much like the first chapter of this book did.
The body of the paper delves into the fine detail and presents complex analysis and specific conclusions 
which, with the help of the introduction, the reader should be able to follow.
The conclusions section summarises the conclusions. This frees the readers mind from the complex 
detail and allows them to consider the relevance and overall implications of the analysis and conclusions. 
Thus even in a short research paper levels of abstraction are important to aid the reader.

As a reach chapter is longer than a research paper it is likely to have subsections and even sub-subsections 
i.e. even more levels of abstraction.

Considering Research as Part of a Dissertation
With subsections and sub-subsections, where the reader is expected to delve ever deeper into the topic, it 
becomes even more important to present a good introduction and to properly introduce each subsection. 
The conclusions at the end, which present an abstract summary of the conclusions reached in the body, 
becomes even more critical as they allow the reader to appreciate the conclusions at a higher level and 
consider the impact of these without concern for all the detail and justification.
14.3.3	
Levels of Abstraction in a Dissertation
A dissertation doesn’t go any deeper than the deepest chapter so it doesn’t really have many more levels 
of abstraction but it is longer and with that length there comes an even greater opportunity for the 
reader to get lost.
Levels of Abstraction in a Dissertation 
Chapter 1 
Chapter 2 
Chapter 3 
…. 
When the reader is buried in the depths of one chapter not only will they struggle to remember what 
the overall aims of the chapter are they will struggle to remember what the purpose of this chapter is 
within the dissertation as a whole. 
Essentially there is one extra level of abstraction that is required. The project and the dissertation as a whole 
must be explained. Thus the first chapter becomes an introduction to the project, and an introduction 
to the dissertation, and should cover:-
•	 The reason for the project,
•	 The aim of the project 
•	 The detailed objectives,
•	 Any significant limitations
•	 The plan of action and
•	 The dissertation structure.
An important part of this introduction is the need for the research chapter and its potential impact on 
the project. This allows the reader to gain a most abstract and simplified understanding of the research 
and the reasons for doing this research.

Considering Research as Part of a Dissertation
This introduction helps the reader grasp a high-level, abstract, understanding of the purpose of the 
project as a whole and an abstract understanding of each chapter.
The final chapter will often summarise and reflect on the project conclusions and help the reader by giving 
them an abstract high-level view of the project outcomes, the successes and failures and their significance.
Additionally link sentences, at the start and end of the chapters, will help the reader by reminding them 
how far they have progressed through the dissertation and remind them what comes next.
14.4	
The Impact of the Research on a Project 
Earlier we described two key differences between a research paper and a research chapter.
One of these was the length of the research chapter and we have considered the impact of this on its 
structure and the need for chapter and section introductions. We have also gone further and considered 
the impact of the length of the dissertation. 
The other difference is perhaps more significant. When a research chapter is part of a dissertation the 
conclusions are usually expected to have an impact on the practical work.
The research chapter should end with specific conclusions about what theories will be used in the project 
and what will be rejected. The potential impact of the research should be made clear in the research 
chapter’s conclusions.
As we have already discussed there are three significant ways you can analyse research and reach 
meaningful conclusions:-
•	 Evaluate the evidence and researchers conclusions to determine which conclusions are valid,
•	 Compare the research theories to determine which are best,
•	 And consider how well those theories will work under real world conditions.
When writing a research chapter the first two of these are unchanged but the third should be different. 
If undertaking an undergraduate project you should also consider the application of those theories for 
your specific project. This should lead to specific conclusions about what theories you will accept and 
implement and what theories you will reject.
You can still consider how well those theories will work under real world conditions and in doing so 
reach meaningful conclusions that will apply to other projects.

Considering Research as Part of a Dissertation
You can also consider how well the theories would apply to your project while assuming your project 
is not constrained by time, resources or by your abilities. In doing so you can reach conclusions about 
which methods would work best for your project if it was being done under ideal conditions.
Of course projects are often not done under ideal conditions: – your time will be constrained, you may not 
have access to all of the data you would like, your abilities to implement some methods may be limited.
Given the constraints you are working under it is perfectly normal to identify the methods or theories 
that would work best under ideal conditions and then explain which would work best for you given the 
constraints you are working under. 
Thus towards the end of your research chapter you should therefore describe aspects of your 
project and to consider the impact of the theory on your planned practical work and reach specific 
conclusions accordingly. 
By considering the application of the theory to your project, with and without constraints, you can at 
the end evaluate what impact the theories had on the project outcomes.

14.5	
Evaluating the Impact of the Research 
One important aspect of any significant project is to evaluate the outcomes. Much like a researcher needs 
to present clear, accurate and unbiased evidence in support of their conclusions you could be expected 
to collect evidence to support your claims regarding the outcomes of an undergraduate project.
This does not just mean collecting evidence on what worked well but also collecting evidence on what 
did not work well.
The nature of this evidence will depend very much on the practical work you may have undertaken:-
•	 If you have developed a physical artefact, e.g. a prototype car engine, you can test the physical 
properties of this, 
•	 If you have developed an intellectual artefact, e.g. a management plan, you can get feedback 
from the management and staff it will affect. You can also estimate the cost and benefits of 
implementing that plan.
•	 If you are developing a software product, e.g. software to predict the weather, you can test its 
accuracy. You can also get feedback from users on its usability etc.
Thus whatever the practical outcomes you can evaluate the successes and failures of your project and 
make recommendations based on this evidence.
However as well as getting feedback and evidence on the practical outcomes you should also consider 
the impact of the research on your project. 
Getting real evidence to show the impact of the research could be impossible but a detailed and personal 
reflection can be very worthwhile.
In the research chapter you considered the potential impact of the theories and decided what theories 
you would take forward…at the end of your project you can look back and consider if those decisions 
were the correct decisions.
If someone else was doing a similar project next year would you recommend the theories you tried to 
implement? Or would you now recommend something different entirely?
Evaluating the impact of the research is an important part of evaluating the project outcomes.
14.6	
Practical Projects Verses Research Projects 
Finally it is worthwhile considering the differences between practical projects and research projects. 
While many undergraduate students undertake practical projects others undertake research projects.

How to Write a Research Paper
256 
Considering Research as Part of a Dissertation
Many undergraduates undertake projects where the ultimate aim is practical. For example to develop a 
strategic plan for a specified company or to develop some software for a client. 
Practical projects may not require research and yet an undergraduate maybe expected to learn from 
current research and apply the new theories to their project. If this is a project requirement then the 
research aim becomes an important subsidiary aim of the project and thus a current research theories 
will need to be considered and evaluated.
However some students undertake projects where the ultimate aim is not to develop an artefact or a 
product for a client but the ultimate aim is to do some research…For example a student could do some 
experiments to test different security protocols reaching appropriate conclusions…conclusions that could 
be published in a research journal.
In projects such as this the student is doing primary research and, while primary research was not the 
focus of this book, some of the theories covered in chapter 4 and 6 may prove helpful.
It is possible that a research project will require an artefact, for example you may develop a network 
simulation which will be used to test different security protocols. While artefacts like this may be necessary 
for the experiments they are in the end throw-away products. 
For research projects evaluating the project outcomes then becomes more about evaluating the 
experimental work done to ensure the results are accurate, robust and free from bias etc i.e. evaluating 
the quality of the science. Evaluating the artefacts becomes far less important.
14.7	
Summary
In this chapter we have considered research as part of an undergraduate project. Thus we have considered 
the differences between a research chapter and a research paper.
We have seen the many similarities between these and thus seen how the skills developed in this book 
apply to both.
We have seen how the a longer research chapter, and the length of the dissertation as a whole, requires 
us to understand the need to present different levels of abstraction thus, 
•	 in chapter 1 it is important to present a clear introduction covering the need for the project, 
the project aim, the project objectives, the need for research, any limitations, the plan of action 
and dissertation structure.
•	 it is important to introduce chapters and sections
•	 link sentences between chapters are helpful
•	 the conclusions section helps the reader to understand the conclusions and their impact without 
concern for all the detail.

Considering Research as Part of a Dissertation
We have seen how the research should have an impact on the project and because of this:-
•	 the research chapter should consider the application of the theory to the specifics of the project 
reaching appropriate conclusions regarding which theories should be implemented and which 
should not,
•	 additionally as well as evaluating the practical outcomes of the project we should evaluate the 
impact of the research.
Finally we considered the differences between practical projects and research projects and for research 
projects considered how the project evaluation should really present an evaluation of the experimental 
work conducted to ensure its scientific validity.

In Conclusion
15	 In Conclusion
In this book we have covered a lot.
We started in Chapter 1 by dispelling the misunderstanding that research is about reading and finding 
out known facts. We learned that knowledge is true, justified belief and learnt a simplified scientific 
process. We have also learnt about good quality research sources.
In Chapter 2 we considered how research is changing our world and how you could make a contribution 
to this.
In Chapter 3 we learnt how to find a cohesive set of research papers, how to use several resource discovery 
services, including IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar, and we learnt how to choose an appropriate title 
for a research paper.
In Chapter 4 we looked at research methodology, learnt about scientific principles and research criteria. 
We learnt about the null hypothesis, why data used to generate a hypothesis cannot be used to test a 
hypothesis and we learnt about different ways a hypothesis can be tested including the use of double 
blind trials.
In Chapter 5 we learnt how to analyse the contents of a research paper and learnt that not all good 
quality papers are appropriate for our needs. We also looked at papers that used varied forms of research 
evidence (a comparative study, making and testing predictions based on the theory, experiments in a 
simulated environment and a mathematical or formal proof).
In Chapter 6 we expanded our knowledge of research theory by focusing on experiments and experimental 
design. This is important if we are to evaluate the work of other researchers. We looked in detail at 
different types of experiments:- Controlled, Natural, Case Study and Action Research and we have 
considered when/where to use these.
In Chapter 7 we focussed on bad science and the need for critical evaluation. We saw that critical 
evaluation does not mean to criticise. We looked at numerous ways research methodology can be flawed 
including:- Confounding Variables, Complexities with Comparative Studies, Badly Randomised Groups, 
The Order Effect, The Placebo Effect, Correlation/Causal Confusion, Surrogate Outcomes, Data Not 
Cleaned, Poor Data Collection and Biased Data. We considered how the discussion of results can be 
flawed and considered how, even if a methodology is sound, conclusions can be flawed. We also looked 
at the issue of False Positives and False Negatives.

In Conclusion
In Chapter 8 we considered the issue of plagiarism and we learnt how to correctly cite sources and 
provide a properly formatted reference list. We also considered the difference between a reference list 
and a bibliography.
In Chapter 9 we practised academic writing skills in the specific context of writing a research paper.
In Chapter 10 we looked at the process of drafting a research paper and considered the need to start 
our writing quickly and continually refine our work. We looked at how to break the task of writing a 
research paper into smaller simpler steps (define the general structure, write a rough introduction, add 
descriptive sections, add evaluation sections, draft the comparative analysis and draft conclusions) and 
we considered how a critical friend can help.
In Chapters 11 to 13 we focussed on the different sections of a research paper:- the introduction, the 
body and conclusions and the abstract. We saw that the introduction was a funnel and how we could use 
less relevant papers. We looked at different ways to structure a paper. We looked at how other writers 
have considered evaluation, comparative analysis and applications of theory and we learnt how we can 
test the quality of a paper.
In Chapter 14 we looked at research being done as part of a larger undergraduate project and at the 
differences between a research paper and a research chapter.
Throughout this book were numerous activates and feedback to help you. If you have worked through 
each of these chapters then you have hopefully developed your research skills and your written skills. 
It is a testament to your tenacity and willingness to learn that you have made it this far.
I hope you have found the videos informative and practical activities a useful learning tool.

In Conclusion
Finally three excellent and complete research papers are provided in appendix 1. These demonstrate how 
the theories covered in this book can result in a complete research paper. 
It is important to note that these were written by three ordinary students, two of them in their first year 
at University. These students were not geniuses they were just dedicated students who were keen to learn 
and willing to work hard.
If they can write an excellent research paper then so can you! 
…and I do hope this book will help you do this.
Kind regards and best wishes for the future.

Appendix 1) Three Research Papers
Appendix 1) Three Research Papers
Introduction
In this appendix are three research papers, all of which were written by undergraduate students and all 
of which have been published and reproduced here with the kind permission of the authors. 
They are:-
‘An Evaluation of Information Hiding Techniques Using Image Steganography’ by Muhammad Hussaini
‘Current EMG Pattern Recognition Research Aimed At Improving Upper Limb Prosthesis Control’ by 
Molly Sturman
‘Positive and Negative: Effects Video Game Use Can Have on Personality Development’ by Shaun Watson
Hopefully by looking at these papers you will see how the techniques covered in this book can be applied 
and in particular how each of these papers make a valid contribution to knowledge by evaluating research 
and comparing the theories discussed to reach their own well-reasoned conclusions.
Two of these papers were written by first year students who, when they started, had no knowledge of 
research and who had never read a research paper. If these students can learn to find, read and evaluate 
research then so can you.

Abstract
Steganography has become the technique of choice for hiding secret messages 
in a cover media, presenting and transmitting it as a harmless piece of content, 
therefore making it hard to detect unlike encryption. This paper provides an adept 
evaluation of some of the prominent image steganography methods, showing their 
strengths, weaknesses and applicability, further conclusions were made regarding the 
effectiveness and otherwise of the techniques evaluated.

Introduction
Protecting the privacy of information for organizations, governments and individuals have become 
increasing challenging in recent times due to the increased use of computers and digital means of 
communication. Various methods of protecting information and privacy have been researched and 
developed, the most obvious being encryption and then steganography. Encryption differs from 
Steganography due to the fact that encryption is generally observable and arouses suspicion, while 
steganography aims at being un-observable and difficult to detect, this is achieved by hiding the secret 
message in unremarkable carrier media (Chanu et al 2012).
Image Steganography is achieved using either transform or spatial domain methods, in spatial domain 
the cover media and the secret message are both modified, this involves encoding at the Least Significant 
Bits of the image and also by transforming the image pixel blocks into 64 Discrete Cosine Transformation 
co-efficient and putting the pixels into groups, the image is transformed into a frequency representation 
from an image representation, the transform domain utilizes this method for embedding the secret data 
into the cover image that is transformed (Das and Tuithung, 2012), the LSB replacement technique is 
however vulnerable to statistical analysis (Ghebleh and Kanso, 2013). 
Further research have therefore been carried out into developing more secure methods of image 
steganography such as that by Prabakaran and Bhavani (2012) which uses Discrete Wavelet Transform 
to achieve a high capacity steganography scheme that enables large size of secret data to be embedded 
into smaller sized cover images.
Raftari and Moghadam (2012) also claimed that by combining Integer Wavelet Transform and Discrete 
Cosine Transform which are both transform models, a more secure image steganography method was 
achieved based on results that showed good value of Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) in the secret 
image, an acceptable visual quality which leaves the secret data unnoticed, Mean structural similarity 
index measure (SSIM) and the Histogram error (HE).
The aim of this paper is to critically evaluate and analyze current research focused on developing more 
secure methods of image steganography, models and techniques used, conclusions and claims reached 
based on experiments carried out and their results.

Evaluation of Current Steganography techniques
Anastasia, et. al (2012) proposed a technique of achieving a robust image steganography using a high 
payload method and edge detection, where hybrid edge detector is derived by unifying the fuzzy edge 
detector and the sobel and the Laplacian filters for simplicity, this method does not compute the real 
edges in an image but distinguishes between the sharp and smooth areas of the image so as to hide more 
secret data bits into the edge pixels. In this method, as well as the secret message, two property files 
which contain information regarding extraction of the secret message are also encrypted using 3-DES 
with the secret key provided by the user during the embedding process.

(2010).

The experiments carried out to test this algorithm used the same images used by Chen et. al. (2010) for 
their image steganography scheme, this is used in order to enable seamless comparison of both techniques, 
although they used colored images while Chen et. al. (2012) used grayscale images. Factors used for 
comparing the two schemes included the hiding capacity in bits divided by three, the peak signal to 
noise ratio (PSNR) is also measured, a higher value of PSNR is considered better. Figure 1 below shows 
the result of comparing this method and that of Chen et. al. (2010).
Based on the results presented above, Anastasia, et. al. (2012) claimed that there method which uses a 
hybrid edge detector together with the sobel and laplatian filters to enable embedding additional secret 
messages in the edge pixels outperforms the hybrid edge detection method proposed by Chen et. al. (2010).
The result of evaluating this method showed that colored variants of the image set used by Chen et. al. 
(2010) were used in the experiment, these image set are used in many other image steganography 
experiments, making it a good choice. The experiment is repeatable due to the fact that it is the most 
widely used for testing image steganography. The use of colored variants of the images in the experiment 
with the new method might not give an accurate representation of the performance when compared to 
the method of Chen et. al. (2010) which uses grayscale variant of the same images, the use of encryption 
as part of the algorithm may also cause potential issues with performance and may cause significant 
change in the size of the stego image as compared to the original cover image, testing the new algorithm 
with only one other method might also not give an accurate measure of its potential performance as 
compared to other current algorithms in the market and those proposed in current research papers.
Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) proposed an algorithm of implementing image steganography by hiding the 
secret message as binary in a pseudo-randomly chosen detail co-efficient of the cover image based on 
discrete wavelet transform and a 3-dimensional chaotic cat map. The algorithm also uses discrete wavelet 
transform to achieve robustness against image processing filters and steganalytic attacks, it also utilizes 
edge adaptability in order to hide more data in the edge pixels where it will be less visible to the human 
eye, whereas lossless extraction of the secret hidden message is achieved by using lifted discrete wavelet 
transform. The extraction process uses the same lifted wavelet transform used in the embedding process 
to find the detail and approximation co-efficient, this enables retrieving the hidden information from 
the exact pixels they were hidden in.
The experiment carried out by Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) was performed in order to gauge the 
performance of the proposed image steganography algorithm on the basis of its security, imperceptibility 
and feasibility. Randomization of the position of the stego-image which carried a secret message of 
size 2bpp and was embedded in the cover image ensured that a visual inspection of both the stego and 
cover image does not unveil the difference between the images. The histogram of both the cover and 
stego image was calculated, as well as the difference which shows that there is no significant difference 
between the two images as shown in figure 2 below.

The experiments they carried out measured the image histogram, the similarity measures were also 
calculated and presented based on existing units of similarity measure – the mean square error (MSE), 
peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity index (SSIM). The results of the experiment 
was also compared with three (3) current transform domain based image steganography schemes by 
(Raja et. al. 2008), (Souvik and Gautam, 2012) and (Gandharba and Saroj, 2012), this were chosen due 
to the fact that they all used colored images for their experiments, this enabled direct comparison of 
these schemes with the proposed scheme. The comparison table is shown in figure 3 below.

Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) concluded that their proposed algorithm is superior to the algorithms it was 
compared to, they also presented evidence that showed they achieved a good imperceptibility measure 
based on the two units of similarity measure, which are PSNR and SSIM index, as well as having a high 
secret key sensitivity.
The research carried out by Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) was rigorous due to the fact that there proposed 
method was tested against attack from different steganalysis methods which use LSB replacement, the 
methods include the Chi-Squared Test (Westfeld Andreas, 2000), Weighted-stego analysis (Fridrich and 
Goljan, 2004) and Sample Pair analysis (Dumitrescu et al, 2003). 
Results have shown that the method is effective against these techniques of steganalysis, although more 
test will need to be carried out to ascertain its strength against other forms of attack such as statistical 
steganalysis which are also very popular. The choice of 3D Cat map is applauded due to its sensitivity to 
even small changes in secret key used. Although, the application of a transform domain technique and 
the randomness of the choice of bits where data is hidden proves effect, the transform domain is known 
to cause reduction in the quality of stego-image produced.

Comparison of current Steganography techniques
The methods of image steganography described above are similar because they both used the least 
significant bits (LSBs) of the cover image as well as utilized edge detection in their own different ways, 
both methods could benefit from the techniques used by the other. The edge detection method used by 
Anastasia et. al (2012) enabled the hiding of larger secret messages, this can be useful in Ghebleh and 
Kanso’s (2013) method which uses a 3D cat map to find random bits for storing secret message without 
considering the size of the hidden data, thereby enabling it to hide larger sizes of secret messages. 
Another significant difference between the two methods is in the way they store information about the 
bits where the secret data is hidden in the cover image, Anastasia et. al (2012) stored this information in 
two information files which are encrypted using 3-DES with a secret key provided by the user during the 
steganography process, these files are required during the message extraction process, where as Ghebleh 
and Kanso (2013) regenerates the 3D cat map used during the embedding process, this gives the exact 
information needed to recover the secret message from the bits they were hidden in, this method could 
be beneficial in Anastasia et. al (2012) method by eliminating the need for encryption which may cause 
performance lags.
Both Anastasia et. al (2012) and Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) used colored images in their experiments. The 
methods for testing the strengths of steganography methods rely on the SSIM, HE value and PSNR, both 
methods have carried out calculations to determine its strength based on these values, this also enables 
seamless comparison with other methods. To compare the methods evaluated above, both used colored 
JPEG images although Anastasia et. al (2012) compared there results with another experiment which 
uses the same images but of grayscale variant, this may not give a realistic comparison of performance 
and effectiveness. 
Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) on the other hand compared there results with three different other method 
which use the same steganography technique and also uses colored images, they also carried out the same 
tests as those three and compared them to their own results, this shows quite a bias free methodology. 
Generally, both methods could complement each other.

Conclusions
Steganography is a technique of hiding secret data in a cover media, mostly images. A lot of research 
have been carried out towards both producing more effective methods of steganography as well as 
countering it. The research by Anastasia et al (2012) focused on hiding a larger size of secret message 
in the stego-image, this was achieved by using a hybrid edge detection algorithm with the SOBEL and 
Laplacian filters, although the main objective was achieved as shown by experiments, its conclusion based 
on comparison with the method of Chen et al (2010) may not have shown an accurate representation 
of the performance due to the fact that they used the same set of images but of colored variant. The 
use of encrypted information files as part of the steganography process may also cause some significant 
performance issues depending on the size of secret message and the cover image as well, since encryption 
is a resource intensive process and rivals the essence of steganography which is to remain unnoticed.

Appendix 1) Three Research Papers
Ghebleh and Kanso (2013) proposed a steganography method which utilizes the irregular output of a 3 
Dimensional cat map to embed the secret data in randomly chosen bits of the cover media, the experiment 
was rigorous and was tested against steganalytic methods which targeted LSB based steganography 
schemes, although it was not tested against other steganalytic attacks such as statistical attacks which 
are very popular. 
The choice of using 3 dimensional cat map to provide randomness of the bits where the secret message 
is hidden is applaudable, the 3 dimensional cat map’s sensitivity to even slight changes to its secret key 
makes it unique. The method is based on the transform domain technique of embedding which has been 
proved to be effective, but tends to produce a reduced quality of final stego-images.

‘Current EMG Pattern Recognition Research Aimed At Improving Upper 
Limb Prosthesis Control’ by Molly Sturman
Current EMG Pattern Recognition Research Aimed At Improving Upper Limb Prosthesis Control
Molly Sturman
Abstract
Research into the application of electromyogram (EMG) pattern recognition is showing 
that it is essential in the intuitive and natural control of upper limb prosthetics; however, 
clinically it is not often used due to its limitations. In this paper, the methodology of 
three different pattern recognition classification methods will be compared, evaluated 
and analysed, these include: single LDA classification, simultaneous parallel approach 
and conditional parallel approach. The purpose is to investigate the advantages and 
disadvantages of each of the approaches. Recommendations will be made from the 
results for further research and comparisons regarding the uses of each technique 
and their real life application.

Introduction
The application of electromyogram (EMG) pattern recognition in the control of upper limb prosthesis has 
been a popular topic of research over the last five years. However, it is not clinically used due to its limited 
dexterity (Scheme, 2011) and EMG recordings can become unreliable over time (Zhang et. al. 2013) 
making the limbs not suitable for everyday situations. Hargrove, L.J. et. al. (2013) conducted research 
into increasing the number of EMG channels to improve the accuracy of the pattern recognition system 
without needing more electrodes. Amsuss et. al. (2014), Scheme (2011) and Zhang et. al. (2013) provide 
research into making prosthesis more clinically viable and allowing the user more intuitive control. 
EMG pattern recognition could offer the user more control of the prosthesis, including allowing them 
to gain more movement and control of the force they put into their movements, as it will learn how the 
EMG changes depending on the user’s intent (Khokhar, Z. et. al. 2010). 
This research paper will focus on studies that have been carried out on using EMG pattern recognition 
to improve upper limb prosthetics. The paper will discuss different classification strategies, results of 
the research and critically evaluate the strength of the outcome. Conclusions will be made throughout 
the paper regarding how each method will affect the prosthesis and then finally summarized at the end. 
The primary object of these papers was improving the dexterity of upper limb prosthesis. This paper 
uses the research of those that focused on improving the pattern recognition and artificial intelligence 
by looking at the classification errors and processing time.

Background
There are three types of pattern recognition methods which will be evaluated, and these shall be referred 
to as single LDA classification, simultaneous parallel classification and conditional parallel classification.
Young, A. et. al. (2013) explains that with the conditional parallel approach each classifier makes an 
assumption that a discrete motion is active. The parallel approach also makes an assumption: “a set 
of features characterizing the EMG signals repeatedly describes a state of muscle activation and maps 
it to one degree of freedom” (Wurth, S.M., Hargrove, L.J. 2013). However, both studies show that this 
assumption may not always be correct. On the other hand, Single Linear Discriminant Analysis does 
not rely on any assumptions or previous knowledge.
3	
Linear Discriminant Analysis 
Chu, J. et. al. (2007) conducted a study comparing a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) approach to three 
other feature projection methods – Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Non Linear Discriminant 
Analysis (NLDA) and Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) – to try to determine whether this was a 
useful method in classification accuracy in a short time span. It was initially decided that the processing 
time should be less than 300ms with a 125ms window increment to avoid delays.
The study focused on nine types of hand motions, using four surface electrodes to measure the EMG 
signals. The hand motions assessed were: “flexion and extension of the wrist, radial and ulnar flexion of 
the wrist, pronation and supination of the wrist, opening and grasping of the fingers, and relaxation.” 
(Chu, J. et. al 2007). The study was conducted in twenty sessions per participant using ten participants. 
The motions were randomly ordered in each session and the participants were asked to perform them 
for five seconds each. 
The results table Fig. 1 shows the processing time to the millisecond of the different processes and the 
total processing time for the movement to be completed. The total processing time was 97ms which met 
the requirements and proved no obvious delay to the user.

Fig. 2 shows the classification success rate percentage and the processing time for LDA, PCA, NLDA and 
SOFM. Whereas the NLDA has the highest success rate, the processing time was significantly higher than 
the LDA, which had only a 0.5% difference in the success rate. Due to the processing time of the NLDA 
the conclusion was drawn that the LDA performed better, as the NLDA did not meet the requirements 
of the processing time being less than 125ms window increment.

The research was focused and carried out well. The paper explains the method used well and has quite 
a thorough description. The motions assessed were relevant and commonly used, and the order of 
the movements was randomised. However, there was no reference in the paper as to how the motions 
were randomised. 
The study concludes that the LDA method gave the user the ability to operate the prosthetic with a 
high success rate and a low processing time. The results confirm that the LDA meets both of these 
requirements, with a processing time of 2ms, leaving the total processing time as 97ms, which is well 
within the requirements. This reflects the conclusion that the LDA method, in an experimental setting, 
was the most appropriate method in this test.

Real life application, however, is a limitation of this study as the study concludes that more research will 
need to be done to make it more appropriate. The study was conducted assuming that the EMG signals 
came from a ‘static contraction in a steady-state motion and fixed movement velocity in a transient-
state motion’ (Chu, J. et. al. 2007). This means that the study is difficult to apply to everyday tasks for 
an individual and therefore, requires further research. 
The method used by Chu, J. et. al. (2007) compared the LDA method to three other methods. Hu, H. 
et. al. (2012), on the other hand, compared the study to five extended LDA methods, which could be 
used as further research into the area, although some of the classification methods do overlap. The types 
of LDA methods studied by Hu, H. et. al. (2012) may help to further the research by Chu, J. et. al. (2007) 
to improve its real life application.

Simultaneous Parallel Approach
Wurth, S.M., Hargrove, L.J. (2013) used on a strategy with two simultaneous parallel classifiers to create 
a more natural and intuitive upper limb prosthesis operation. This was compared to a sequential method 
to assess the advantages of simultaneous pattern recognition for prosthetics.
The study was tested on eight right handed people aged between 23 and 30. Six surface electrodes were 
placed equidistant around the forearm on the subjects. A real time single LDA was used as classification 
for the output into one of the motion classes to test the sequential pattern recognition. For simultaneous 
pattern recognition, two parallel classifiers were used; one for each degree on freedom. The difference 
between the sequential pattern recognition and the simultaneous pattern recognition was assessed with 
control strategy, target type and session as fixed factors and the participant classified as a random factor. 
Fig. 3 show both of the methods tested for both discrete and combined tasks and rated on completion, 
overshoot and reaction time. The paper states that the results reflect the initial hypothesis that a 
simultaneous pattern recognition system will be more appropriate when participating in combined tasks.

opposed to sequential pattern recognition (PR) in both discrete and combined tasks.

These results show that there is potential for simultaneous pattern recognition to be a useful and 
appropriate method for multi – functional upper limb prosthesis. However, other methods would provide 
a much quicker reaction time and this is essential in creating an intuitive prosthetic.
Young, A. et. al. (2012), used an alternative hierarchal approach which was based upon using a parallel 
approach. This took a similar approach but built on it to create a more complex method that provided 
low classification errors. 
They conclude that whilst the research is a good basis for further studies, it did not necessarily show 
that the simultaneous parallel approach was a more appropriate method than a sequential method. This 
conclusion is representative of the results and the limits to the research that was conducted.
5	
Conditional Parallel Approach
Young, A. et. al. (2013), proposed a method known as the conditional parallel approach. It is an extension 
of a parallel approach which uses two simultaneous classifiers. They compared this to a regular parallel 
method and the LDA method to determine whether their method was an improvement on other methods 
for improving the degrees of freedom in upper limb prosthesis.
The study was conducted on three male non-amputee subjects and three female non-amputee subjects 
as well as two above elbow (trans-humeral) amputees who had undergone TMR surgery. All of the 
partakers were seated, un-restrained and were not given any feedback throughout the experiment. There 
were six pairs of electrodes places equidistant from one another around the circumference of the upper 
forearm for the non-amputee subjects and eight pairs of electrodes placed on the biceps and triceps for 
the amputee subjects. 
Four degree of freedom classifications tests were carried out for the three classification strategies on the 
participants. The performance of the classification strategies was evaluated by the percent of incorrect 
classifications. Comparisons were made with classification error as the response variable, and the fixed 
factors as the classifier strategy, degree of freedom configuration and the number of channels. The 
participant was classified as a random factor. 
The results in Fig. 4 show that for both two and three degree of freedom configurations the LDA and 
conditional parallel method performed significantly better than the parallel method. The conditional 
parallel performed a lot better than a single LDA classifier with a two degree of freedom configuration 
and slightly better using a three degrees of freedom configuration.

“Configuration 1 is wrist and hand DOFs and configuration 2 is rotation and hand DOFs. Results 
are shown for six channels of EMG and are an average of six subjects. Error bars show ± 1 
standard error of the mean.” (Young, A. et. al. 2013).
The research conducted by Young, A. et. al. (2013) was a well thought out and in depth approach. The 
study was tested on both amputee and non – amputee participants which helps to confirm that the 
method will be applicable in the real world. The participants were all treated the same, ensuring that 
the results were not affected by position of the subject. as the amputee subjects had undergone TMR 
surgery, the placement of the electrodes was appropriate.

Appendix 1) Three Research Papers
This study did not test online control; however, there have been many other studies, such as Hargrove, 
L.J. et. al. (2011), which gives evidence of a strong correlation between online controllability and 
classification accuracy. 
The conclusions drawn in this paper show that the conditional parallel approach is aimed at trans-radial 
amputees, although future research could look into using similar techniques for TMR subjects also. 
The paper also states that the research could be used to develop a deeper look into using simultaneous 
pattern recognition and the conclusion that a conditional parallel approach has few classification errors 
than the parallel approach appears to be justified. 
6	
Comparison of Pattern Recognition Techniques
The research evaluated throughout this paper all had an aim to improve upper limb prosthesis using 
EMG pattern recognition. The methods all had advantages and limitations stated in their conclusions 
and results allowing comparisons to be made for a recommendation for the most appropriate method.
The conditional parallel approach had advantages of low classification errors, as the results by Young, 
A. et. al. (2013) show that they had lower errors in both discrete and combined movements. This is a 
significant advantage as low classification errors will provide fewer problems for the user. 
LDA does also have a low classification error, shown both by Young, A. et. al. (2013) and Chu, J. et. al. 
(2007), although not as low as the conditional parallel approach. It does, however, have a very quick 
processing time which will provide a more intuitive prosthesis for the user. Research into methods 
extending from LDA and improving the real life application may make it a more suitable option, however. 
The research by Wurth, S.M., Hargrove, L.J. (2013) showed that, whilst simultaneous pattern recognition 
had advantages of high completion percentage and lower overshoot percentage over sequential pattern 
recognition in combined motions, there was the disadvantage of it having a slower performance in 
the discrete motions, whilst being equally efficient otherwise. The simultaneous approach is inferior 
to the other methods analysed as it shows no significant or consistent advantages in improving upper 
limb prosthesis.
The results all show that all three methods analysed have limitations, such as real life application or 
online control, which require further study to allow fully intuitive results. 
7	
Conclusions
In this paper, pattern recognition methods of classification to improve upper limb prosthesis have been 
analysed and evaluated. A literature review has shown various ways that different researchers have 
attempted to improve the dexterity, control and intuitiveness of prosthetics.

Appendix 1) Three Research Papers
A comparison of the research appears to prove that, although the parallel approach does have some 
advantages, both the conditional parallel and the LDA are superior methods to the parallel approach in 
terms of classification accuracy and processing time. This shows that in an effort to improve upper limb 
prosthesis the parallel approach would not currently be recommended.
From the research reviewed, the recommendation could be made that the conditional parallel approach 
will provide the lowest classification errors for both the discrete and combined movements which will 
be a positive argument for the user. Research should be conducted into using both the LDA method 
and the conditional parallel method to improve the processing time to create an upper limb prosthetic 
with full, immediate functionality.

‘Positive and Negative: Effects Video Game Use Can Have on Personality 
Development’ by Shaun Watson
Positive and Negative: Effects Video Game Use Can Have on Personality Development
Shaun Watson
Abstract
Previous research has found that consistent video game use can have a string of 
effects on an individual in terms of personality, a large proportion of which cover the 
negative impacts. Research has shown that certain video games can increase cognitive 
abilities, increase social activities and influence various emotional personality traits 
such as aggression, joy and acceptance among various other emotions in adolescents 
particularly. The purpose of this article is to examine various aspects of personality 
development due to video game use and show both the positive and negative sides of 
these aspects. Considering both sides of this matter is important to maintain a well-
balanced argument and in turn to produce useful recommendations and conclusions. 
Finally, to better understand the effects video games have on an individual’s personality, 
it is vital to consider a range of aspects in relation to personality.
1	
Introduction
In recent years video games have become a major part of almost all children’s and adolescent’s lives, with 
97% playing for at least one hour a day in the United States (Granic, I. et.al. 2013). A large proportion 
of the research done into the field of video games tends to focus on the negative impacts they have and 
what problems they cause and amplify such as the research done by (Markey, P.M. and Markey, C.N. 
2010). Although this research is all valid and reasonable, a more balanced argument is needed which 
compares both negative and positive impacts of consistent video game use. In no way does this imply 
no research has been done into the positive side, research done by (Granic, I. et.al. 2013), (Durkin, K. 
et. al. 2013) and (Velez, J.A. and Ewoldsen, D.R. 2013) all show various positive elements of video game 
use. The aim of this paper is to place the positive side of “gaming” next to the negative side in terms of 
the effects it has on personality development mainly in adolescents and then compare the two sides with 
evidence to back up the arguments shown. This paper will focus strongly on the effects and changes 
that video games can have on personality in terms of skills, senses, abilities and traits of an individual. 
To conclude by offering some recommendations and backed up conclusions based on solid evidence. 
These recommendations will provide a basis for further research and possibly impact on design choices 
within future video games.

Aspects of Personality Development
The following research will be split up into four different sections which will account for the four aspects of 
personality development strongly linked to video game use: Cognitive, social, emotional and educational 
aspects. Although personality is a broad subject and could be split into many different categories, the 
four previously mentioned coincide with video game use.
2.1	
Cognitive Effects
“Contrary to conventional beliefs that playing video games is intellectually lazy and sedating, it turns out 
that playing these games promotes a wide range of cognitive skills” (Granic, I. et.al. 2013). The cognitive 
effects tend to be the most often considered effect of video game use; this is particularly true in terms 
of educational games. “From a psychological perspective, the potential of games to support and extend 
cognitive development is of particular interest.” (Durkin, K. et. al. 2013). 
K. Durkin et. al. (2013) looked at various experiments that have been conducted which try to expose 
the cognitive changes due to video game use. One of these studies measured adolescents suffering from 
ADHD who were aged 6 to 12 and a comparison group of boys with TD, and were tasked with playing 
a relatively straight forward game, Point Blank and a slightly more complex one, Crash Bandicoot. 
Specifically, participants were tested in conditions where they had to maneuver a character along a route 
and not touch the side and in the latter, they had to do the same but also had to perform and action at a 
certain point (spin to destroy objects). Results of the former proved similar among both groups but the 
boys with ADHD performed poorly at the latter and kept performing the action at incorrect times. They 
concluded that working memory deficits in these children alter when confronted with different tasks.
The experiment could easily be recreated again if needed, although only a small group of boys, the results 
are reliable as the conditions were fair and accurate as all taking part in the experiment were under the 
exact same conditions and all participants were within a narrow age group therefore we can rely on this 
evidence. Overall this study shows that certain tasks in video games can have an effect on cognitive 
functions within the brain such as working memory and attention. 
While it seems apparent that children become proficient at specific skills in video games, it appears that 
they generally keep video game play separate from other areas of life, so it is not clear whether these 
preferences and skills transfer to other contexts. (Hamlen, K.R. 2013) This statement raises the question 
of why adolescents play video games and what is their motivation which in turn raises the question of 
why do people cheat at video games and what affect can cheating have on their personality as a result.

Appendix 1) Three Research Papers
A study conducted was a qualitative study with three teenage boys. (Hamlen, K.R. 2013) The data was 
collected via interviews with analysis, these interviews focused on the participant’s background, details 
of the participant’s background with cheat codes and participant’s views on cheating in video games and 
academically. From this they concluded that those who choose to avoid the effort of completing the game 
tend to be those who are more likely to cheat in academics.
This experiment could not be done by anyone else as the questions that were asked in these interviews 
are unknown and it would strongly depend on the analysis of the individual (the interviewer). Although 
the topics of the questions are suitable as it is plausible that they could be used to see a correlation in 
cheating at video games and also in everyday life, this experiment can’t be relied upon because of the 
lack of information given.
2.2	
Social Aspects
The social side of video gaming is often overlooked by the press and general public. They tend to see 
video gaming as an antisocial pastime and link it strongly to loneliness and depression although there 
are some who see it as the complete opposite of this. Socializing is arguably the most important factor for 
the development of an individual’s personality; interactions with others can define various characteristic 
through adolescence. Interactions can mold the opinions of a person and the outlook they have on 
various topics therefore can have an impact on personality. Social gaming refers to playing with other 
players either competitively or cooperatively (Velez, J.A. and Ewoldsen, D.R. 2013).

Appendix 1) Three Research Papers
An extensive study conducted that delved into the social side of gaming involved various experiments. 
One of which was very detailed and planned extensively. The experiment involved thirty six students (13 
women, 23 men) who were randomly assigned to one of two game conditions (prosocial game vs neutral 
video game) the ages ranged from 19 to 43 years old. Tetris was used for the neutral video game and 
City Crisis was used for the pro social game. After participants played the game for 8 minutes, one of 
two experimenters left the room and informed a male confederate to enter in the role of a lonesome ex-
boyfriend of the other experimenter. The actor was instructed to act very aggressive to the experimenter 
and get frustrated, as a measure of Prosocial behavior, it was measured if the participant intervened or not. 
The minimum requirement was that the participant spoke at all, if this occurred, the actor immediately 
left the room, if not then the other experimenter reenter and asks the actor to leave still in character.
Ten out of the 18 participants who played City Crisis intervened with the situation compared to only 4 
out of the 18 who played Tetris meaning 56% of the participants in the prosocial video game condition 
helped, whereas only 22% in the neutral video game condition helped. They concluded from this 
that video games had an effect on the decision making process of the participant’s and that playing a 
prosocial game increased the chances of compassionate behavior by up to three times. (Greitemeyer, T. 
and Osswald, S. 2010)
The study could very easily be recreated again with the information given; all conditions involved were 
very thorough and detailed. The students were randomly assigned and there was also a mixture in 
gender among the participants. The participant was completely unaware of what was about to happen 
in the experiment and they were given a questionnaire at the end to mask the real experiment. None of 
the participant’s had any suspicions that the harassment scenario was not real. Therefore this study is 
perfectly valid and can be relied upon.
2.3	
Emotional Aspects
Playing video games can have various different effects on an adolescent; one of these effects can be 
emotional effects. Emotions play a huge role in the development of personality, emotional tendencies 
can influence decision making and how others react and interact with an individual (e.g. if an individual 
is prone to anger) which can alter behavior.
The most controversial emotion that video games are accused of incurring is aggression. Various studies 
have been done looking into this accusation, such as (Willoughby T. et. al. 2011), (Fraser A.M. 2012) 
and (Espinosa P. and Clemente M. 2013) which show the correlation between video game use and 
aggressive tendencies.

Appendix 1) Three Research Papers
A study which conducted an online survey involving 790 undergraduate students (547 women and 243 
men) and which varied in ethnicity and marital status about various emotional related issues in correlation 
to gaming. The measurements for the study were violent video gaming, empathic concern and prosocial 
behavior. The actual online survey required a recruitment code to access it therefore no outside data was 
being collected, all participants were required to obtain consent otherwise they were unable to start the 
questionnaire. From this study, they concluded that males play significantly more violent video games 
than females and due to this females show much higher empathic concern than males and also much 
higher levels of prosocial behavior towards others. (Fraser A.M. 2012)
Although this study included a larger ratio of women to men, it doesn’t have any impact on the results. 
The study focused on vital topics of research which would ensure results that were useful for example 
they used the correlation between violent video games and the tendencies of a participant in terms of 
empathic concern and prosocial behavior. Although an online study, the participants were chosen from 
a select few universities and were briefed by their lectures on the study beforehand where they were 
given the recruitment code needed to access the survey therefore overall this study can be applied and 
counted as reliable.
A study conducted found that boys and girls who regularly played a mature rated video game were 
more likely to endorse four reasons to play: to compete and win, to relieve anger, modifying games and 
experimenting with games functionality (e.g. trying out different weapons/vehicles).
No extensive information about the study or the participant’s is given, the method of the study is not 
enclosed so it would be impossible to recreate it in any way so although the conclusions of the study are 
solid and seem sensible, they can’t be relied upon.
Tobias Greitemeyer (2013) conducted research to show that playing video games cooperatively increases 
empathic concern. Various studies were conducted within this research and various conclusions were 
reached as a result. Reported empathy differed across certain game conditions, exposure to violent video 
games resulted in a decreases in empathic concern and playing video games cooperatively resulted in 
an increase in empathic concern. (Greitemeyer T. 2013)

Educational Aspects
“Video game play and the potential effects of game play on learning, achievement, and engagement 
have attracted psychologists, educational researchers, and learning scientists” (Evans M.A. et. al. 2013) 
Learning and education are the key aspects of life that can define an individual and influence their 
personalities and alter how they develop. Research conducted by (Evans M.A. et. al. 2013) and (Durkin, K. 
et. al. 2013) have both looked into the effects video game use can have on education and learning.

Appendix 1) Three Research Papers
Evans M.A. et. al. (2013) used a game known as ‘The CandyFactory Game’ (CFG) in their research which 
was designed to accompany middle school students (aged 11–15) algebra readiness and emphasis on 
fractions. The CFG was created to enable students to physically enact their mental actions in terms of 
fractions. In the CFG students work their way through five levels that are designed to visually introduce 
them to the principles of fractions. As they progress, the CFG produces more complex scenarios therefore 
to complete the game students need to master the five fraction schemes which were: Whole, partitive 
unit, partitive, Iterative and reversible partitive. Students were accessed at the end of each level and 
rewarded based on the speed and accuracy they demonstrated.
The five levels enforced the students with different scenarios and ways of thinking. The purpose of 
the CFG is to measure the effectiveness video games can have on learning and what particular design 
features can improve an adolescents learning process. They concluded from this study that educational 
games can be beneficial in a variety of ways (e.g. allowing students to perform actions they are unable 
to perform in real life, competition, and reward systems).
This experiment focused entirely on the effectiveness of the game itself and little information is given 
about the group of participant’s other than an age range of 11–15 years old. No results of measurements 
are given other than conclusions that they reached because of the CFG. It is also noteworthy that this is 
just one game relating to fractions; therefore it is difficult to apply this study to actual video games not 
fully designed for academic purposes. Evans M.A. et. al. (2013) do not claim to apply their conclusions 
to video games in general, they place emphasis on the fact that educational games could be beneficial 
for the learning process of an individual and not video games in general.

Discussion & Comparisons
After looking at various research, it is clear that certain theories are backed up by others and some 
theories don’t quite correlate to other findings therefore it is important to compare the implications of 
these theories. 
The first aspect was the cognitive effects of video game use; we found that video game use can have an 
effect on working memory and attention and that these skills could be enhanced by consistent video 
game use to then be used in the real world. This would have an impact on the personality development 
of adolescents as it could potentially increase their general intelligence and problem solving abilities. The 
next focus was on cheating in video games, although the evidence found was unreliable, it is noteworthy 
to mention that cheating in video games could have a link to an individual cheating in other contexts 
which would have an effect on their personality as they would develop a habit of attempting to bypass 
any effort by cheating at any given task.

Appendix 1) Three Research Papers
The second aspect looked at was the social effects of video game use; we looked at a study that studied 
the effect video games have on decision making. To put the study into the context of personality 
development, it shows that playing certain video games can have an effect on how an individual judges 
certain situations. Although this study was conducted on adults, it can also be applied to adolescents as 
decision making plays a huge role in growing up and can define the nature of a person. This could mean 
that consistent video game use could induce tendencies such as tolerance and compassion.
The third aspect looked at was the emotional effects of video game use, we looked at a study that 
measured the correlation between violent video games, empathic concern and prosocial behavior. 
This study shows that there is a correlation between certain aggressive tendencies and video game use 
(Violent video game use in particular) which raises the question; can the personality of an adolescent 
be influenced by certain video game use? This study shows that playing violent video games can show a 
reduction in empathic concern and a decrease in prosocial behavior. Adolescents are exposed to many 
different video games and many of which include violence of some nature. Although the participants of 
the previously described were between 18 and 29, there is no reason to believe that the effects would be 
any less significant on an adolescent.

Appendix 1) Three Research Papers
On the other hand video games have often been found to allow individuals to vent their anger without 
consequence. (Olson C.K. 2010) Video games can allow an adolescent to immerse themselves in 
unrealistic environment’s which in turn can allow them to de stress and vent out their built up aggression 
where they know they are not going face any repercussions.
The final aspect looked at was education effects of video game use, we found that educational games 
designed specifically for use in an academic environment could be beneficial but we can’t apply this 
to video games in general. It is difficult to apply the study we looked at to the matter of personality 
development. Although it would be acceptable to argue that educational games can have an impact 
on learning and therefore impact an adolescent’s personality as a result. This is backed up by research 
such as (Durkin, K. et. al. 2013) which looks into video games for adolescents with educational needs. 
Various educational needs are addressed in their research and various uses of video games to help these 
problems are well demonstrated such as video games to enhance the working memory of adolescent’s 
suffering from ADHD.

Conclusions
By looking at the last decade in terms of ‘Gaming’ there has been a huge incline in its popularity and 
there is no reason to believe that its popularity won’t continue to increase in the next decade therefore 
video games will continue to be prominent in a large majority of adolescents lives. After pulling together 
various pieces of research that cover a few positive and negative effects video games can have on 
personality development, we can conclude that like other media platforms (e.g. Books, Films, TV etc.) 
video games can have adverse effects on an adolescents personality and how they develop their unique 
personalities. Also, like other media platforms, it largely depends on what type of games they play. From 
our research we can conclude that playing violent video games consistently can result in a decrease in 
empathic concern and prosocial behavior although they allow an individual to vent their built up anger 
without consequence. 
There are many aspects of the effects that video games can have on personality that we have not looked 
at in this research, we have only covered a very minute section of the potential research that could be 
conducted but the research covered is important as it exposes the fact that video games do have an effect 
on personality, positively and negatively. 
Finally, we can see from this research that video game use can result in an increase in cognitive abilities, 
provide social interactions with others, provide emotional help and possibly an increase in academic 
performance which in turn could result in an adolescent becoming more motivated and intelligent and 
improve various life skills such as decision making and problem solving. On the other hand consistent 
video game use in certain types of games can result in emotional strains, less social interactions and 
poor academic performance which in turn could result in an adolescent becoming more depressed, 
secluded and distant.
