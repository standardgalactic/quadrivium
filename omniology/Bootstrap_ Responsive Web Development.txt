Foreword
I was a software developer before Mac existed, so I remember how the tech industry
reacted to it. For the most part, the community reacted with a fair amount of skepticism.
The interesting thing is that the negative things people say about Bootstrap today sound
exactly like the negative things people said about the Mac in 1984. And in both cases,
the things that people didn’t like were what made them important.
Apple realized that there is a set of things that all software has to do, so why shouldn’t
they all do them the same way? If they did, software would be easier to develop and
debug, but more important—it would be easier to use. If there was only one way to
create menus, then once a user learned how to use the menus of one app, he would
already know how to use the menus of all others. The same is true with scrollbars,
windows, the keyboard, the mouse, printing, and sound.
The reason programmers didn’t like it, (and I was one of them) was that they took what
we did and commoditized it. Further, there were limits to the one-size-fits-all approach.
There were some apps that didn’t take to the UI standards very well. What to do about
them? Well, you adapted, that’s what you did.
This is a well-known technical process called factoring. If you see yourself doing some‐
thing over and over, do it one more time really well, work on the API so it’s easy and
flexible, and that’s it. You never do it again. It’s how you build ever-taller buildings out
of software. What was the leading edge five years ago is baked into the operating system
today. Progress. It’s a wonderful thing!
The same patterns are observable in the Web. In fact, it’s kind of sad how much of a
repeat it is, how backward today’s development environment is compared to the one
envisioned by the Mac. But at least Bootstrap is out there doing the factoring. If I want
to put up a menu, I can just use the code that creates menus. Sure, my menu looks like
all the others, but that’s a good thing for users. There is no need to learn a second or
third way to use a menu.

That this is needed, desperately needed, is indicated by the incredible uptake of Boot‐
strap. I use it in all the server software I’m working on. And it shows through in the
templating language I’m developing, so everyone who uses it will find it’s “just there”
and works any time you want to do a Bootstrap technique. Nothing to do; no libraries
to include. It’s as if it were part of the hardware. It’s the same approach that Apple took
with the Mac OS in 1984.
Like all important technologies, Bootstrap is “good enough” but not too good. In other
words, the designers, Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton, could have factored more than
they did. However, while they could have created something more compact and perhaps
more elegant, it wouldn’t have been nearly as approachable. The great thing about
Bootstrap for a guy like me, who has been busy building software behind websites, is
that it solves a whole bunch of problems that we all have when putting a user interface
on those sites.
However, I think that will turn out to be just the beginning. I see the opportunity for
Bootstrap to become an integral part of the Web—a toolkit that you can count on being
present in every environment you work in. Further, someday, perhaps soon, designers
will be able to plug in skins for Bootstrap that transform the appearance of a site without
any modification to the code or to its styles or scripts. I don’t see any limits to what can
be done with Bootstrap. Rather than being a replacement for designers, it creates op‐
portunities for designers to have more power and reach.
These days, part of the maturing process of any new technology is the release of its
O’Reilly book. Now Bootstrap has one. The author, Jake Spurlock, a web developer, has
been building sites with Bootstrap, has spoken at conferences about it, and he credits
me for getting him started with a series of enthusiastic blog posts I wrote as I was
discovering its power and elegance. Now, I can happily turn you over to Jake’s able hands.
He will show you how the Bootstrap magic works, so you too can help move the web
development world forward.

Preface
Bootstrap is a front-end framework for building responsive websites. Whether it is
application frameworks, blogs, or other CMS applications, Bootstrap can be a good fit,
as it can be as vanilla as you like. Its combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript make
it easy to build robust sites without adding a lot of code. With a default grid system,
layouts come together with ease, and the styling of buttons, navs, and tables make basic
markup look great from the get-go. A dozen or so JavaScript plugins catapult you into
adding interactive elements to your site.
Who This Book Is For
This book is mostly for people who have a good handle on HTML/CSS and JavaScript,
and are curious about building responsive sites, adding the Bootstrap JavaScript plugins,
or building sites faster by using this popular open source framework.
Who This Book Is Not For
This book is not for people who get all they need out of the Bootstrap online docu‐
mentation. Like a lot of people, the online docs are where I got started—building my
first site with Bootstrap 1.3 and then upgrading it to Bootstrap 1.4. After that, I built a
big project with Bootstrap 2.0, and so on. If you are comfortable writing semantic
HTML, then jumping into Bootstrap should be easy for you.
What This Book Will Do For You
If you have some background in writing HTML/CSS and JavaScript, this book will help
you get off the ground writing some flexible code for responsive websites. In practical
terms, the concepts and code syntax should come easily, as the book follows the patterns
for writing semantic HTML and CSS.

How This Book Works
This book builds a site with Bootstrap, starting at the foundation of the project and the
file structure, moving up through the grid system and layout types, and into HTML
elements and styling like forms, tables, and buttons. Once the walls are up, we move
into the aesthetic elements like navbars, breadcrumbs, and media objects. After that, we
move on to the JavaScript elements, such as dropdowns, the carousel, and modals, that
provide the interaction for a site.
Why I Wrote This Book
I’m not a Bootstrap expert hoping to create more Bootstrap experts to get a lot of work
done.
I’m a developer and writer who encountered Bootstrap through a post on Dave Winer’s
blog, and I thought it would be cool to apply it to a new site that I was working on. I feel
compelled to share some of what I’ve learned. I’m hoping that the path I followed will
work for other people, probably with variations, and that a book written from a begin‐
ner’s perspective (and vetted by experts) will help more people find and enjoy Bootstrap.
Other Resources
This book may not be the best way for you to learn Bootstrap. It all depends on what
you want to learn and why.
If your primary interest is to get started building Bootstrap websites, the online docu‐
mentation will likely suit you perfectly. The authors, Jacob Thornton and Mark Otto,
have been meticulous in providing examples of the codebase, HTML code samples, and
more to kickstart your project. It is top notch, and I’ve used it to gather the structure
for this book.
If you want to contribute to the work of the open source project, you can submit pull
requests or use the issue tracker on the GitHub project for updates, downloads, docu‐
mentation, and more.
Are You Sure You Want Bootstrap?
If you are looking for JavaScript plugins, or a CSS reset, Bootstrap may be overkill. If
you aren’t in love with some of the default interface elements, they can be overwritten
easily or you can just strip out the associated tags. If you are looking for an easy way to
build fast, responsive websites, Bootstrap is a great way to get going. I use it on all of my
projects, and I’m really happy with it.

Help This Book Grow
While I hope that you will enjoy reading this book and will learn from it, I also hope
that you can contribute to helping other readers learn to use Bootstrap. You can help
your fellow readers in a number of ways:
• If you find specific technical problems, bad explanations, or things that can be
improved, please report them through the errata system.
• If you like (or don’t like) the book, please leave reviews. The most visible places to
do so are on Amazon.com (or its international sites) and at the O’Reilly page for
the book. Detailed explanations of what worked and what didn’t work for you (and
the broader target audience of programmers new to Bootstrap) are helpful to other
readers and to me.
• If you find you have much more you want to say about Bootstrap, please consider
sharing it, whether on the Web, in a book of your own, in training classes, or in
whatever form you find easiest.
I’ll update the book for errata and try to address issues raised in reviews. Even once the
book is published, I may still add some extra pieces to it. If you purchased it as an ebook,
you’ll receive these updates for free until it’s time for a whole new edition. I don’t expect
that new edition declaration to come quickly, however, unless the Bootstrap world
changes substantially.
Hopefully this book will engage you enough to make you consider sharing.

Acknowledgments
Many thanks to Dave Winer for introducing me to Bootstrap in the first place, and to
Simon St. Laurent for the opportunity to write this book. Detailed feedback from my
friends Roseanne Fallin and Tony Quartorolo has made it possible; I hope that this book
can get readers started on the right track. I would also like to thank Melissa Morgan for
letting me take a few risks and develop the way that I like at MAKE.
In particular, thanks to my wonderful wife, Melissa, for putting up with me and en‐
couraging me to finish. And thanks to my son, Rush, for understanding that I needed
to “work” and to my daughter, Hailey, for the warm smiles and huge hugs. I love my
family, and am so glad for everything they offer me.

CHAPTER 1
Bootstrap Scaffolding
What Is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is an open source product from Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton who, when
it was initially released, were both employees at Twitter. There was a need to standardize
the frontend toolsets of engineers across the company. In the launch blog post, Mark
Otto introduced the project like this:
In the earlier days of Twitter, engineers used almost any library they were familiar with
to meet front-end requirements. Inconsistencies among the individual applications made
it difficult to scale and maintain them. Bootstrap began as an answer to these challenges
and quickly accelerated during Twitter’s first Hackweek. By the end of Hackweek, we had
reached a stable version that engineers could use across the company.
— Mark Otto
 https://dev.twitter.com/
Since Bootstrap launched in August 2011, it has taken off in popularity. It has evolved
from being an entirely CSS-driven project to include a host of JavaScript plugins and
icons that go hand in hand with forms and buttons. At its base, it allows for responsive
web design and features a robust 12-column, 940px-wide grid. One of the highlights is
the build tool on Bootstrap’s website, where you can customize the build to suit your
needs, choosing which CSS and JavaScript features you want to include on your site. All
of this allows frontend web development to be catapulted forward, building on a stable
foundation of forward-looking design and development. Getting started with Bootstrap
is as simple as dropping some CSS and JavaScript into the root of your site.
For someone starting a new project, Bootstrap comes with a handful of useful elements.
Normally, when I start a project, I start with tools like Eric Meyer’s Reset CSS and get
going on my web project. With Bootstrap, you just need to include the bootstrap.css CSS

file and, optionally, the bootstrap.js JavaScript file into your website and you are ready
to go.
Bootstrap File Structure
 bootstrap/
        ├── css/
        │   ├── bootstrap.css
        │   ├── bootstrap.min.css
        ├── js/

        │   ├── glyphicons-halflings.png
        │   ├── glyphicons-halflings-white.png
        └── README.md
The Bootstrap download includes three folders: css, js, and img. For simplicity, add these
to the root of your project. Minified versions of the CSS and JavaScript are also included.
It is not necessary to include both the uncompressed and the minified versions. For the
sake of brevity, I use the uncompressed version during development and then switch to
the compressed version in production.
Basic HTML Template
Normally, a web project looks something like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
        <head>
                <title>Bootstrap 101 Template</title>
        </head>
        <body>
                <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        </body>
</html>
With Bootstrap, we include the link to the CSS stylesheet and the JavaScript:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
        <head>
                <title>Bootstrap 101 Template</title>
                <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
        </head>
        <body>
                <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
                <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
        </body>
</html>

Don’t forget the HTML5 Doctype.
By including <!DOCTYPE html>, all modern browsers are put into
standards mode.
Global Styles
With Bootstrap, a number of items come prebuilt. Instead of using the old reset block
that was part of the Bootstrap 1.0 tree, Bootstrap 2.0 uses Normalize.css, a project from
Nicolas Gallagher that is part of the HTML5 Boilerplate. This is included in the boot‐
strap.css file.
In particular, the following default styles give special treatment to typography and links:
• margin has been removed from the body, and content will snug up to the edges of
the browser window.
• background-color: white; is applied to the body.
• Bootstrap is using the @baseFontFamily, @baseFontSize, and @baseLineHeight
attributes as our typographic base. This allows the height of headings and other
content around the site to maintain a similar line height.
• Bootstrap sets the global link color via @linkColor and applies link underlines only
on :hover.
Remember, if you don’t like the colors or want to change a default, this
can be done by changing the globals in any of the .less files. To do this,
update the scaffolding.less file or overwrite colors in your own style‐
sheet.
Default Grid System
The default Bootstrap grid (see Figure 1-1) system utilizes 12 columns, making for a
940px-wide container without responsive features enabled. With the responsive CSS
file added, the grid adapts to be 724px or 1170px wide, depending on your viewport.
Below 767px viewports, such as the ones on tablets and smaller devices, the columns
become fluid and stack vertically. At the default width, each column is 60 pixels wide
and offset 20 pixels to the left. An example of the 12 possible columns is in Figure 1-1.

Figure 1-1. Default grid
Basic Grid HTML
To create a simple layout, create a container with a <div> that has a class of .row and
add the appropriate amount of .span* columns. Since we have a 12-column grid, we
just need the amount of .span* columns to equal 12. We could use a 3-6-3 layout, 4-8,
3-5-4, 2-8-2… we could go on and on, but I think you get the gist.
The following code shows .span8 and .span4, which adds up to 12:
<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">...</div>
  <div class="span4">...</div>
</div>
Offsetting Columns
You can move columns to the right using the .offset* class. Each class moves the span
over that width. So an .offset2 would move a .span7 over two columns (see
Figure 1-2):
<div class="row">
  <div class="span2">...</div>
  <div class="span7 offset2">...</div>
</div>

Nesting Columns
To nest your content with the default grid, inside of a .span*, simply add a new .row
with enough .span* that it equals the number of spans of the parent container (see
Figure 1-3):
<div class="row">
  <div class="span9">
    Level 1 of column
    <div class="row">
      <div class="span6">Level 2</div>
      <div class="span3">Level 2</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Figure 1-3. Nesting grid
Fluid Grid System
The fluid grid system uses percentages instead of pixels for column widths. It has the
same responsive capabilities as our fixed grid system, ensuring proper proportions for
key screen resolutions and devices. You can make any row “fluid” by changing .row
to .row-fluid. The column classes stay exactly the same, making it easy to flip between
fixed and fluid grids. To offset, you operate in the same way as the fixed grid system—
add .offset* to any column to shift by your desired number of columns:
<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span4">...</div>
  <div class="span8">...</div>
</div>
<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span4">...</div>
  <div class="span4 offset2">...</div>
</div>
Nesting a fluid grid is a little different. Since we are using percentages, each .row resets
the column count to 12. For example, if you were inside a .span8, instead of
two .span4 elements to divide the content in half, you would use two .span6 divs (see
Fluid Grid System

Figure 1-4). This is the case for responsive content, as we want the content to fill 100%

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span8">
                <div class="row">
                        <div class="span6">...</div>
                        <div class="span6">...</div>
                </div>
  </div>
</div>

Container Layouts
To add a fixed-width, centered layout to your page, simply wrap the content in <div
class="container">...</div>. If you would like to use a fluid layout but want to wrap
everything in a container, use the following: <div class="container-fluid">...</
div>. Using a fluid layout is great when you are building applications, administration
screens, and other related projects.
Responsive Design
To turn on the responsive features of Bootstrap, you need to add a <meta> tag to the
<head> of your web page. If you haven’t downloaded the compiled source, you will also
need to add the responsive CSS file. An example of required files looks like this:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
        <head>
                <title>My amazing Bootstrap site!</title>
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,
              initial-scale=1.0">
                <link href="/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet">
                <link href="/css/bootstrap-responsive.css" rel="stylesheet">
        </head>

If you get started and find that the Bootstrap responsive features aren’t
working, make sure that you have these tags. The responsive features
aren’t added by default at this time because not everything needs to be
responsive. Instead of encouraging developers to remove this feature,
the authors of Bootstrap decided that it was best to enable it as needed.
What Is Responsive Design?
Responsive design is a method for taking all of the existing content that is on the page
and optimizing it for the device that is viewing it. For example, the desktop not only
gets the normal version of the website, but it might also get a widescreen layout, opti‐
mized for the larger displays that many people have attached to their computers. Tablets
get an optimized layout, taking advantage of their portrait or landscape layouts. And
then with phones, you can target their much narrower width. To target these different
widths, Bootstrap uses CSS media queries to measure the width of the browser viewport
and then, using conditionals, changes which parts of the stylesheets are loaded. Using
the width of the browser viewport, Bootstrap can then optimize the content using a
combination of ratios or widths, but it mostly relies on min-width and max-width
properties.
At the core, Bootstrap supports five different layouts, each relying on CSS media queries.
The largest layout has columns that are 70 pixels wide, contrasting with the 60 pixels of
the normal layout. The tablet layout brings the columns to 42 pixels wide, and when
narrower than that, each column goes fluid, meaning the columns are stacked vertically
and each column is the full width of the device (see Table 1-1).
Table 1-1. Responsive media queries

Portrait tablets

42px

767px and below Fluid columns, no fixed widths

480px and below Fluid columns, no fixed widths
To add custom CSS based on the media query, you can either include all rules in one
CSS file via the media queries below, or use entirely different CSS files:
/* Large desktop */
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }
/* Portrait tablet to landscape and desktop */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 979px) { ... }
/* Landscape phone to portrait tablet */
@media (max-width: 767px) { ... }

/* Landscape phones and down */
@media (max-width: 480px) { ... }
For a larger site, you might want to divide each media query into a seperate CSS file. In
the HTML file, you can call them with the <link> tag in the head of your document.
This is useful for keeping file sizes smaller, but it does potentially increase the HTTP
requests if the site is responsive. If you are using LESS to compile the CSS, you can have
them all processed into one file:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="base.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(min-width: 1200px)" href="large.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 979px)"
      href="tablet.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(max-width: 767px)" href="tablet.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(max-width: 480px)" href="phone.css" />
Helper classes
Bootstrap also includes a handful of helper classes for doing responsive development
(see Table 1-2). Use these sparingly. A couple of use cases that I have seen involve loading
custom elements based on certain layouts. Perhaps you have a really nice header on the
main layout, but on mobile you want to pare it down, leaving only a few of the elements.
In this scenario, you could use the .hidden-phone class to hide either parts or entire
dom elements from the header.
Table 1-2. Media queries helper classes

There are two major ways that you could look at doing development. The mantra that
a lot of people are shouting now is that you should start with mobile, build to that
platform, and let the desktop follow. Bootstrap almost forces the opposite, where you
would create a full-featured desktop site that “just works.”
If you are looking for a strictly mobile framework, Bootstrap is still a great resource.

CHAPTER 2
Bootstrap CSS
At the core of Bootstrap is a set of basic HTML elements that have been styled to allow
for easy enhancement via classes and user styles.
Typography
Starting with typography, Bootstrap uses Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, and sans-
serif in its default font stack. These are all standard fonts and are included as defaults
on all major computers. If by chance these fonts don’t exist, they fall back to sans-
serif (the catchall) to tell the browser to use the default font for the browser. All body
copy has the font-size set at 14 pixels, with the line-height set at 20 pixels. The <p>
tag has a margin-bottom of 10 pixels, or half the line-height.
Headings
All six standard heading levels have been styled in Bootstrap (see Figure 2-1), with the
<h1> at 36 pixels tall, and the <h6> down to 12 pixels (for reference, default body text is
14 pixels tall). In addition, to add an inline subheading to any of the headings, simply
add <small> around any of the elements and you will get smaller text in a lighter color.
In the case of the <h1>, the small text is 24 pixels tall, normal font weight (i.e., not bold),
and gray instead of black: 
h1 small {
    font-size:24px;
        font-weight:normal;
        line-height:1;
        color:#999;
        }

Figure 2-1. Headings
Lead Body Copy
To add some emphasis to a paragraph, add class="lead" (see Figure 2-2). This will
give you larger font size, lighter weight, and a taller line height. This is generally used
for the first few paragraphs in a section, but it can really be used anywhere:
<p class="lead">Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet tri-tip pork loin ball tip frankfurter
swine boudin meatloaf shoulder short ribs cow drumstick beef jowl.
Meatball chicken sausage tail, kielbasa strip steak turducken venison prosciutto.
Chuck filet mignon tri-tip ribeye, flank brisket leberkas. Swine
turducken turkey shank, hamburger beef ribs bresaola pastrami venison rump.</p>

Emphasis
In addition to using the <small> tag within headings, as discussed above, you can also
use it with body copy. When <small> is applied to body text, the font shrinks to 85% of
its original size.
Bold
To add emphasis to text, simply wrap it in a <strong> tag. This will add font-
weight:bold; to the selected text.
Italics
For italics, wrap your content in the <em> tag. The term “em” derives from the word
“emphasis” and is meant to add stress to your text.
You might be thinking, why not just use the <b> or <i> tags instead of
<em> or <strong>? In HTML5, <b> is meant to highlight words or
phrases without conveying additional importance—for example, key
terms or names—while <i> is mostly for voice, technical terms, internal
dialogue, and so on. For more information about the semantic changes
to <b> and <i>, check out W3.org’s article.
Emphasis Classes
Along with <strong> and <em>, Bootstrap offers a few other classes that can be used to
provide emphasis (see Figure 2-3). These could be applied to paragraphs or spans:
<p class="muted">This content is muted</p>
<p class="text-warning">This content carries a warning class</p>
<p class="text-error">This content carries an error class</p>
<p class="text-info">This content carries an info class</p>
<p class="text-success">This content carries a success class</p>
<p>This content has <em>emphasis</em>, and can be <strong>bold</strong></p>

Abbreviations
The HTML <abbr> element provides markup for abbreviations or acronyms, like
WWW or HTTP (see Figure 2-4). By marking up abbreviations, you can give useful
information to browsers, spell checkers, translation systems, or search engines. Boot‐
strap styles <abbr> elements with a light dotted border along the bottom and reveals
the full text on hover (as long as you add that text to the <abbr> title attribute):
<abbr title="Real Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>
Figure 2-4. Abbreviation example
Add .initialism to an <abbr> for a slightly smaller font size (see Figure 2-5):

Addresses
Adding <address> elements to your page can help screen readers and search engines
locate any physical addresses and phone numbers in the text (see Figure 2-6). It can also
be used to mark up email addresses. Since the <address> defaults to display:block;
you’ll need to use <br> tags to add line breaks to the enclosed address text (e.g., to split
the street address and city onto separate lines):
<address>
  <strong>O'Reilly Media, Inc.</strong><br>
  1005 Gravenstein HWY North<br>
  Sebastopol, CA 95472<br>
  <abbr title="Phone">P:</abbr> <a href="tel:+17078277000">(707) 827-7000</a>
</address>
<address>
  <strong>Jake Spurlock</strong><br>
  <a href="mailto:#">flast@oreilly.com</a>
</address>
Figure 2-6. Address tag
Blockquotes
To add blocks of quoted text to your document—or for any quotation that you want to
set apart from the main text flow—add the <blockquote> tag around the text. For best
results, and for line breaks, wrap each subsection in a <p> tag. Bootstrap’s default styling
indents the text and adds a thick gray border along the left side. To identify the source
Typography

of the quote, add the <small> tag, then add the source’s name wrapped in a <cite> tag
before closing the </small> tag: 
<blockquote>
        <p>That this is needed, desperately needed, is indicated by the
    incredible uptake of Bootstrap. I use it in all the server software
    I'm working on. And it shows through in the templating language I'm
    developing, so everyone who uses it will find it's "just there" and
    works, any time you want to do a Bootstrap technique. Nothing to do,
    no libraries to include. It's as if it were part of the hardware.
    Same approach that Apple took with the Mac OS in 1984.</p>
        <small>Developer of RSS, <cite title="Source Title">Dave Winer</cite>
    </small>
</blockquote>
When you put it all together, you get something that looks like Figure 2-7.
Figure 2-7. Basic blockquote
If you want a <blockquote> with content that is right aligned,
add .pull-right to the tag. In addition to the right-aligned text, the
entire blockquote is floated to the right. This creates nice pull-quotes
in your content, as shown in Figure 2-8.

Lists
Bootstrap offers support and styling for the three main list types that HTML offers:
ordered, unordered, and definition lists. An unordered list is a list that doesn’t have any
particular order and is traditionally styled with bullets.
Unordered list
If you have an ordered list that you would like to remove the bullets from, add
class="unstyled" to the opening <ul> tag (see Figure 2-9):
<h3>Favorite Outdoor Activities</h3>
<ul>
        <li>Backpacking in Yosemite</li>
        <li>Hiking in Arches
                <ul>
                        <li>Delicate Arch</li>
                        <li>Park Avenue</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Biking the Flintstones Trail</li>
</ul>
Figure 2-9. Unordered list
Personally, I hold a strong aversion to using the <br> tag. When I want
a single-spaced line break, I place each line in an unstyled, unordered
list. For example, if you want a condensed address box, like in
Figure 2-6, you could code each line as <li>. In my mind, this is a more
semantic way to mark up the text.
Typography

Ordered list
An ordered list is a list that falls in some sort of sequential order and is prefaced by
numbers rather than bullets (see Figure 2-10). This is handy when you want to build a
list of numbered items like a task list, guide items, or even a list of comments on a blog
post:
<h3>Self-Referential Task List</h3>
<ol>
        <li>Turn off the internet.</li>
        <li>Write the book.</li>
        <li>... Profit?</li>
</ol>
Figure 2-10. Ordered list
Definition list
The third type of list you get with Bootstrap is the definition list. The definition list
differs from the ordered and unordered list in that instead of just having a block-level
<li> element, each list item can consist of both the <dt> and the <dd> elements. <dt>
stands for “definition term,” and like a dictionary, this is the term (or phrase) that is
being defined. Subsequently, the <dd> is the definition of the <dt>.
A lot of times in markup, you will see people using headings inside an unordered list.
This works, but may not be the most semantic way to mark up the text. A better method
would be creating a <dl> and then styling the <dt> and <dd> as you would the heading
and the text (see Figure 2-11). That being said, Bootstrap offers some clean default styles
and an option for a side-by-side layout of each definition:
<h3>Common Electronics Parts</h3>
<dl>
        <dt>LED</dt>
        <dd>A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source.</dd>
        <dt>Servo</dt>
        <dd>Servos are small, cheap, mass-produced actuators used for radio
    control and small robotics.</dd>
</dl>

Figure 2-11. Definition list
To change the <dl> to a horizontal layout, with the <dt> on the left side and the <dd>
on the right, simply add class="dl-horizontal" to the opening tag (see Figure 2-12).
Figure 2-12. Horizontal definition list
Horizontal description lists will truncate terms that are too long to fit
in the left column with text-overflow. Additionally, in narrower view‐
ports, they will automatically change to the default stacked layout.
Code
There are two different key ways to display code with Bootstrap. The first is the <code>
tag and the second is the <pre> tag. Generally, if you are going to be displaying code
inline, you should use the <code> tag. But if the code needs to be displayed as a stand-
alone block element or if it has multiple lines, then you should use the <pre> tag:
<p>Instead of always using divs, in HTML5, you can use new elements like
<code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, and
<code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. The html should look something like this:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;article&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Article Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;
</pre>

Make sure that when you use the <pre> and <code> tags, you use the
unicode variants for the opening and closing tags: &lt; and &gt;.
Tables
One of my favorite parts of Bootstrap is the nice way that tables are handled. I do a lot
of work looking at and building tables, and the clean layout is a great feature that’s
included in Bootstrap right off the bat. Table 2-1 lists the various elements supported
by Bootstrap.
Table 2-1. Table elements supported by Bootstrap

If you want a nice, basic table style with just some light padding and horizontal dividers,
add the base class of .table to any table (see Figure 2-13). The basic layout has a top
border on all of the <td> elements:
<table class="table">
  <caption>...</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>...</th>
      <th>...</th>

Optional Table Classes
Along with the base table markup and the .table class, there are a few additional classes
that you can use to style the markup. These four classes are: .table-striped, .table-
bordered, .table-hover, and .table-condensed.
Striped table
By adding the .table-striped class, you will get stripes on rows within the <tbody>
(see Figure 2-14). This is done via the CSS :nth-child selector, which is not available
on Internet Explorer 7–8.
Figure 2-14. Striped table class
Bordered table
If you add the .table-bordered class, you will get borders surrounding every element
and rounded corners around the entire table, as shown in Figure 2-15.

Forms
Another one of the highlights of using Bootstrap is the ability to create forms with ease.
As a web developer, styling forms is one of my least favorite tasks. Bootstrap makes it
easy with the simple HTML markup and extended classes for different styles of forms.
The basic form structure comes with Bootstrap; there is no need to add any extra helper
classes (see Figure 2-19). If you use the placeholder, keep in mind that it is only supported
in newer browsers. In older browsers, no placeholder text will be displayed:
<form>
        <fieldset>
                <legend>Legend</legend>
                        <label for="name">Label name</label>
                        <input type="text" id="name"
                   placeholder="Type something…">
                        <span class="help-block">Example block-level help
                         text here.</span>
                        <label class="checkbox" for="checkbox">
                                <input type="checkbox" id="checkbox">
                Check me out
                        </label>
                <button type="submit" class="btn">Submit</button>
        </fieldset>

Figure 2-19. Basic form
Optional Form Layouts
With a few helper classes, you can dynamically update the layout of your form. Bootstrap
comes with a few preset styles to choose from.
Search form
Add .form-search to the <form> tag, and then add .search-query to the <input> for
an input box with rounded corners and an inline submit button (see Figure 2-20):
<form class="form-search">
  <input type="text" class="input-medium search-query">
  <button type="submit" class="btn">Search</button>
</form>
Figure 2-20. Search form
Inline form
To create a form where all of the elements are inline and labels are alongside, add the
class .form-inline to the <form> tag (see Figure 2-21). To have the label and the input
on the same line, use this inline form code:
<form class="form-inline">
        <input type="text" class="input-small" placeholder="Email">
        <input type="password" class="input-small" placeholder="Password">

        </label>
        <button type="submit" class="btn">Sign in</button>
</form>
Figure 2-21. Inline form
Horizontal form
Bootstrap also comes with a prebaked horizontal form; this one stands apart from the
others not only in the amount of markup, but also in the presentation of the form.
Traditionally you’d use a table to get a form layout like the one shown in Figure 2-22,
but Bootstrap manages to do it without using tables. Even better, if you’re using the
responsive CSS, the horizontal form will automatically adapt to smaller layouts by
stacking the controls vertically.
To create a form that uses the horizontal layout, do the following:
• Add a class of .form-horizontal to the parent <form> element.
• Wrap labels and controls in a <div> with class .control-group.
• Add a class of .control-label to the labels.
• Wrap any associated controls in a <div> with class .controls for proper alignment.

      <button type="submit" class="btn">Sign in</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</form>
Supported Form Controls
Bootstrap natively supports the most common form controls. Chief among them are
input, textarea, checkbox, radio, and select.
Inputs
The most common form text field is the input—this is where users will enter most of
the essential form data (see Figure 2-23). Bootstrap offers support for all native HTML5
input types: text, password, datetime, datetime-local, date, month, time, week, num
ber, email, URL, search, tel, and color:
<input type="text" placeholder="Text input">
Figure 2-23. Input
Both input and textarea default to a nice blue glow when in
the :active state.

Textarea
The textarea is used when you need multiple lines of input (see Figure 2-24). You’ll
find you mainly modify the rows attribute, changing it to the number of rows that you
need to support (fewer rows = smaller box, more rows = bigger box):
<textarea rows="3"></textarea>
Figure 2-24. Both the :active default and the textarea
Checkboxes and radio buttons
Checkboxes and radio buttons are great when you want users to choose from a list of
preset options (see Figure 2-25). When building a form, use checkbox if you want the
user to select any number of options from a list. Use radio if you want to limit him to
just one selection:
<label class="checkbox">
  <input type="checkbox" value="">
  Option one is this and that—be sure to include why it's great.
</label>
<label class="radio">
  <input type="radio" name="optionsRadios" id="optionsRadios1" value="option1"
  checked>
  Option one is this and that—be sure to include why it's great.
</label>
<label class="radio">
  <input type="radio" name="optionsRadios" id="optionsRadios2" value="option2">
  Option two can be something else, and selecting it will deselect option one
</label>

If you want multiple checkboxes to appear on the same line together, add the .inline
class to a series of checkboxes or radio buttons (see Figure 2-26):
<label for="option1" class="checkbox inline">
  <input id="option1" type="checkbox" id="inlineCheckbox1" value="option1"> 1
</label>
<label for="option2" class="checkbox inline">
  <input id="option2" type="checkbox" id="inlineCheckbox2" value="option2"> 2
</label>
<label for="option3" class="checkbox inline">
  <input id="option3" type="checkbox" id="inlineCheckbox3" value="option3"> 3
</label>
Figure 2-26. Inline checkboxes
Selects
A select is used when you want to allow the user to pick from multiple options, but by
default it only allows one (see Figure 2-27). It’s best to use <select> for list options with
which the user is familiar, such as states or numbers. Use multiple="multiple" to allow
the user to select more than one option. If you only want the user to choose one option,
use type="radio":
<select>
  <option>1</option>
  <option>2</option>
  <option>3</option>
  <option>4</option>
  <option>5</option>
</select>
<select multiple="multiple">
  <option>1</option>
  <option>2</option>
  <option>3</option>
  <option>4</option>
  <option>5</option>

Extended Form Controls
In addition to the basic form controls listed in the previous section, Bootstrap offers a
few other form components to complement the standard HTML form elements; for
example, it lets you easily prepend and append content to inputs.
Prepended and appended inputs
By adding prepended and appended content to an input field, you can add common
elements to the user’s input (see Figure 2-28). For example, you can add the dollar
symbol, the @ for a Twitter username, or anything else that might be common for your
application interface. To add extra content before the user input, wrap the prepended
input in a <div> with class .input-prepend. To append input, use the class .input-
append. Then, within that same <div>, place your extra content inside a <span> with
an .add-on class, and place the <span> either before or after the <input> element:
<div class="input-prepend">
  <span class="add-on">@</span>
  <input class="span2" id="prependedInput" type="text" placeholder="Username">
</div>
<div class="input-append">
  <input class="span2" id="appendedInput" type="text">
  <span class="add-on">.00</span>
</div>
Figure 2-28. Prepend and append
If you combine both of them, you simply need to add both the .input-prepend
and .input-append classes to the parent <div> (see Figure 2-29):

<div class="input-prepend input-append">
  <span class="add-on">$</span>
  <input class="span2" id="appendedPrependedInput" type="text">
  <span class="add-on">.00</span>
</div>
Figure 2-29. Using both the append and prepend
Rather than using a <span>, you can instead use <button> with a class of .btn to attach
(surprise!) a button or two to the input (see Figure 2-30):
<div class="input-append">
  <input class="span2" id="appendedInputButtons" type="text">
  <button class="btn" type="button">Search</button>
  <button class="btn" type="button">Options</button>
</div>
Figure 2-30. Attach multiple buttons to an input
If you are appending a button to a search form, you will get the same nice rounded
corners that you would expect (see Figure 2-31):
<form class="form-search">
  <div class="input-append">
    <input type="text" class="span2 search-query">
    <button type="submit" class="btn">Search</button>
  </div>
  <div class="input-prepend">
    <button type="submit" class="btn">Search</button>
    <input type="text" class="span2 search-query">
  </div>
</form>

Form Control Sizing
With the default grid system that is inherent in Bootstrap, you can use the .span* system
for sizing form controls. In addition to the span column-sizing method, you can also
use a handful of classes that take a relative approach to sizing. If you want the input to
act as a block-level element, you can add .input-block-level and it will be the full
width of the container element, as shown in Figure 2-32:
<input class="input-block-level" type="text" placeholder=".input-block-level">
Figure 2-32. Block-level input
Relative input controls
In addition to using .span* for input sizing, you can also use a few different class names
(see Figure 2-33):
<input class="input-mini" type="text" placeholder=".input-mini">
<input class="input-small" type="text" placeholder=".input-small">
<input class="input-medium" type="text" placeholder=".input-medium">
<input class="input-large" type="text" placeholder=".input-large">
<input class="input-xlarge" type="text" placeholder=".input-xlarge">
<input class="input-xxlarge" type="text" placeholder=".input-xxlarge">
Figure 2-33. Relative input controls

www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
In future versions of Bootstrap, these input classes will be altered to
match the button sizes. For example, .input-large will increase the
padding and font size of an input.
Grid sizing
You can use any .span from .span1 to .span12 for form control sizing (see Figure 2-34):
<input class="span1" type="text" placeholder=".span1">
<input class="span2" type="text" placeholder=".span2">
<input class="span3" type="text" placeholder=".span3">
<select class="span1">
  ...
</select>
<select class="span2">
  ...
</select>
<select class="span3">
  ...
</select>
Figure 2-34. Span-sized inputs
If you want to use multiple inputs on a line, simply use the .controls-row modifier
class to apply the proper spacing (see Figure 2-35). It floats the inputs to collapse the
white space; sets the correct margins; and, like the .row class, clears the float:
<div class="controls">
  <input class="span5" type="text" placeholder=".span5">
</div>
<div class="controls controls-row">
  <input class="span4" type="text" placeholder=".span4">
  <input class="span1" type="text" placeholder=".span1">

Figure 2-35. Control row
Uneditable text
If you want to present a form control without allowing the user to edit the input, simply
add the class .uneditable-input (see Figure 2-36):
<span class="input-xlarge uneditable-input">Some value here</span>
Figure 2-36. Uneditable input
Form actions
When you place the form actions at the bottom of a .horizontal-form, the inputs will
correctly line up with the floated form controls (see Figure 2-37):
<div class="form-actions">
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</button>
  <button type="button" class="btn">Cancel</button>

Help text
Bootstrap form controls can have either block or inline text that flows with the inputs
(see Figure 2-38):
<input type="text"><span class="help-inline">Inline help text</span>
Figure 2-38. Inline help
To add a full width block of content, use the .help-block after the <input> (see
Figure 2-39):
<input type="text"><span class="help-block">A longer block of help text that
breaks onto a new line and may extend beyond one line.</span>
Figure 2-39. Block help
Form Control States
In addition to the :focus state, Bootstrap offers styling for disabled inputs and classes
for form validation.
Input focus
When an input receives :focus (i.e., a user clicks into the input or tabs onto it), the
outline of the input is removed and a box-shadow is applied. I remember the first time
that I saw this on Twitter’s site; it blew me away, and I had to dig into the code to see
how they did it. In WebKit, this is accomplished in the following manner:
input {
  -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.075);
  -webkit-transition: box-shadow linear 0.2s;
}
input:focus {
  -webkit-box-shadow: inset 0 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.075), 0 0 8px
                      rgba(82, 168, 236, 0.6);
}
32 
| 
Chapter 2: Bootstrap CSS
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
The <input> has a small inset box-shadow, which gives the appearance that the input
sits lower than the page (see Figure 2-40). When :focus is applied, an 8px light blue
border appears. The webkit-transition tells the browser to apply the effect in a linear
manner over 0.2 seconds:
<input class="input-xlarge" id="focusedInput" type="text"
              value="This is focused...">
Figure 2-40. Focused input
Nice and subtle; a great effect.
Disabled input
If you need to disable an input, simply adding the disabled attribute will not only disable
it; it will also change the styling and the mouse cursor when the cursor hovers over the
element (see Figure 2-41):
<input class="input-xlarge" id="disabledInput" type="text"
              placeholder="Disabled input here..." disabled>
Figure 2-41. Disabled input
Validation states
Bootstrap includes validation styles for error, warning, info, and success messages (see
Figure 2-42). To use, simply add the appropriate class to the surrounding .control-
group:
<div class="control-group warning">
  <label class="control-label" for="inputWarning">Input with warning</label>
  <div class="controls">
    <input type="text" id="inputWarning">
    <span class="help-inline">Something may have gone wrong</span>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="control-group error">
  <label class="control-label" for="inputError">Input with error</label>

Buttons
One of my favorite features of Bootstrap is the way that buttons are styled. Dave Winer,
inventor of RSS and big fan of Bootstrap, has this to say about it:
That this is needed, desperately needed, is indicated by the incredible uptake of Bootstrap.
I use it in all the server software I’m working on. And it shows through in the templating
language I’m developing, so everyone who uses it will find it’s “just there” and works, any
time you want to do a Bootstrap technique. Nothing to do, no libraries to include. It’s as
if it were part of the hardware. Same approach that Apple took with the Mac OS in 1984.
— Dave Winer
 scripting.com
I like to think that Bootstrap is unifying the Web and allowing a unified experience of
what an interface can look like across the Web. With the advent of Bootstrap, you can
usually spot the sites that have adopted it by the buttons that they use. A grid layout and
many of the other features fade into the background, but buttons, forms, and other
unifying elements are a key part of Bootstrap. When I come across a site that is using
Bootstrap, I want to give a high five to the webmaster at that domain, since he probably
“just gets it.” I felt the same way a few years ago whenever I saw wp-content in the HTML
of sites that I visited.

Now, buttons and links can all look alike with Bootstrap. Anything that is given a class
of .btn will inherit the default look of a gray button with rounded corners. However,
you can add color to the buttons by adding extra classes (see Table 2-3).
Table 2-3. Button color examples
Buttons
Class
Description
btn
Standard gray button with gradient
btn btn-primary
Provides extra visual weight and identifies the primary action in a set
of buttons (blue)
btn btn-info
Used as an alternative to the default styles (light blue)
btn-success
Indicates a successful or positive action (green)
btn btn-warning Indicates caution should be taken with this action (orange)
btn btn-danger
Indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action (red)
btn btn-inverse Alternate dark-gray button, not tied to a semantic action or use
btn btn-link
De-emphasizes a button by making it look like a link while maintaining
button behavior
There are issues with buttons not appearing in Internet Explorer 9 be‐
cause it doesn’t crop background gradients on rounded corners. Also,
Internet Explorer doesn’t work well with disabled button elements. The
rendered text is gray with a nasty text shadow that hasn’t been fixed.
Button Sizes
If you need larger or smaller buttons, simply add .btn-large, .btn-small, or .btn-
mini to links or buttons (see Figure 2-43):
<p>
  <button class="btn btn-large btn-primary" type="button">Large button</button>
  <button class="btn btn-large" type="button">Large button</button>
</p>
<p>
  <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button">Default button</button>
  <button class="btn" type="button">Default button</button>
</p>
<p>
  <button class="btn btn-small btn-primary" type="button">Small button</button>

  <button class="btn btn-mini" type="button">Mini button</button>
</p>
Figure 2-43. Different button sizes
If you want to create buttons that display like a block-level element, simply add the .btn-
block class (see Figure 2-44). These buttons will display at 100% width:
<button class="btn btn-large btn-block btn-primary" type="button">Block-
level button</button>
<button class="btn btn-large btn-block" type="button">Block-level button</button>
Figure 2-44. Block-level button
Disabled Button Styling
For anchor elements, simply add the class of .disabled to the tag and the link will fade
in color, and lose the gradient (see Figure 2-45):
<a href="#" class="btn btn-large btn-primary disabled">Primary link</a>
<a href="#" class="btn btn-large disabled">Link</a>

Figure 2-45. Disabled link
The .disabled class is being used much like the .active class. So,
there’s no .btn prefix, and remember, this is only for looks. You will
need to use some JavaScript to actually disable the link.
For a button, simply add the disabled attribute to the button (see Figure 2-46). This
will actually disable the button, so JavaScript is not directly needed:
<button type="button" class="btn btn-large btn-primary disabled"
disabled="disabled">Primary button</button>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-large" disabled>Button</button>
Figure 2-46. Disabled button
Images
Images have three classes (see Figure 2-47) that can be used to apply some simple
styles: .img-rounded adds border-radius:6px to give the image rounded
corners, .img-circle makes the entire image round by adding border-radius:
500px, and .img-polaroid adds a bit of padding and a gray border:
<img src="..." class="img-rounded">
<img src="..." class="img-circle">
<img src="..." class="img-polaroid">

Bootstrap bundles 140 icons into one sprite that can be used with buttons, links, navi‐
gation, and form fields. The icons are provided by GLYPHICONS; see Figure 2-48.

GLYPHICONS Attribution
Users of Bootstrap are fortunate to use the GLYPHICONS for free on Bootstrap projects.
The developers have asked that you link back to GLYPHICONS when practical.
GLYPHICONS Halflings are normally not available for free, but an arrangement between
Bootstrap and the GLYPHICONS creators have made this possible at no cost to you as
developers. As a thank you, we ask you to include an optional link back to GLYPHICONS
whenever practical.
— Bootstrap Documentation
 http://getbootstrap.com
Usage
To use the icons, simply use an <i> tag with the namespaced .icon- class. For example,
if you want to use the edit icon, you add the .icon-edit class to the <i> tag:
<i class="icon-edit"></i>
If you want to use the white icon, simply add the .icon-white class to the tag:
<i class="icon-edit icon-white"></i>
Button groups
By using button groups combined with icons, you can create nice interface elements
with minimal markup (see Figure 2-49):
<div class="btn-toolbar">
  <div class="btn-group">
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-align-left"></i></a>
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-align-center"></i></a>
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-align-right"></i></a>
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-align-justify"></i></a>
  </div>
</div>
Figure 2-49. Button groups
Navigation
When you are using icons next to a string of text, make sure to add a space to provide
the proper alignment of the image (see Figure 2-50). Navigation code will be covered
further in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 3
Bootstrap Layout Components
In addition to all of the markup provided in the previous chapter, Bootstrap provides a
toolkit of flexible components that can be used in designing application interfaces, web
features, and more. All of the plugins are available in one separate JavaScript file, or you
can use the Bootstrap customizer to pick and choose which plugins you want. Personally,
on the projects that I build, I lump them all together. That way I have options.
Dropdown Menus
Dropdown menus are toggleable, contextual menus for displaying links in a list format.
The dropdowns can be used on a variety of different elements, navs, buttons, and more.
You can have a single dropdown or extend the dropdown into another submenu. You
can see a basic dropdown menu in Figure 3-1. 
Figure 3-1. Basic dropdown menu
The following code creates a basic dropdown menu:
<ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownMenu">
  <li><a tabindex="-1" href="#">Action</a></li>
  <li><a tabindex="-1" href="#">Another action</a></li>
  <li><a tabindex="-1" href="#">Something else here</a></li>
  <li class="divider"></li>

www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
  <li><a tabindex="-1" href="#">Separated link</a></li>
</ul>
Options
Right-align
Add .pull-right to a .dropdown-menu to right-align the dropdown menu to the parent
object:
<ul class="dropdown-menu pull-right" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dLabel">
  ...
</ul>
Submenu
If you would like to add a second layer of dropdowns (see Figure 3-2), simply
add .dropdown-submenu to any <li> in an existing dropdown menu for automatic
styling: 
<ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dLabel">
  ...
  <li class="dropdown-submenu">
    <a tabindex="-1" href="#">More options</a>
    <ul class="dropdown-menu">
      ...
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
Figure 3-2. Dropdown menu and submenu
Button Groups
Button groups allow multiple buttons to be stacked together (see Figure 3-3). This is
useful when you want to place items like alignment buttons together. To create a button
42

group, simply wrap a series of anchors or buttons in a <div> that has .btn-group as a
class: 
<div class="btn-group">
  <button class="btn">1</button>
  <button class="btn">2</button>
  <button class="btn">3</button>
</div>
Figure 3-3. Left, middle, and right button group
If you have multiple button groups (see Figure 3-4) that you want to place on a single
line, wrap multiple .btn-group classes with .btn-toolbar: 
<div class="btn-toolbar">
  <div class="btn-group">
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-align-left"></i></a>
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-align-center"></i></a>
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-align-right"></i></a>
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-align-justify"></i></a>
  </div>
  <div class="btn-group">
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-italic"></i></a>
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-bold"></i></a>
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-font"></i></a>
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-text-height"></i></a>
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-text-width"></i></a>
  </div>
  <div class="btn-group">
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-indent-left"></i></a>
    <a class="btn" href="#"><i class="icon-indent-right"></i></a>
  </div>
</div>

For more information about using icons with buttons, follow the examples in Chapter 2.
To stack the buttons vertically (see Figure 3-5), add .btn-group-vertical to the .btn-
group class:

Button Groups as Radio Buttons and Checkboxes
To have the checkboxes function as radio buttons, where only one option can be selected
at a time, or checkboxes, where multiple options can be selected, you simply need to
add some extra markup and then Bootstrap’s JavaScript will provide the rest. This will
be covered in detail in Chapter 4.
To use a button with a dropdown, it must be individually wrapped in
its own .btn-group within a btn-toolbar for proper rendering.
Buttons with Dropdowns
To add a dropdown to a button (see Figure 3-6), simply wrap the button and dropdown
menu in a .btn-group. You can also use <span class="caret"></span> to act as an
indicator that the button is a dropdown:
<div class="btn-group">
  <button class="btn btn-danger">Danger</button>
  <button class="btn btn-danger dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown">
    <span class="caret"></span>
  </button>
  <ul class="dropdown-menu">
    <li><a href="#">Action</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Another action</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Something else here</a></li>
    <li class="divider"></li>
    <li><a href="#">Separated link</a></li>

You can use the dropdowns with any button size: .btn-large, .btn, .btn-small,
or .btn-mini. Figure 3-7 shows several examples of different button sizes.
Figure 3-7. Button dropdown sizes
Split Button Dropdowns
Split button dropdowns (see Figure 3-8) use the same general style as the dropdown
button but add a primary action along with the dropdown. Split buttons have the pri‐

  </ul>
</div>
Dropup Menus
Menus can also be built to drop up rather than down (see Figure 3-9). To make this
change, simply add .dropup to the .btn-group container. To have the button pull up
from the righthand side, add .pull-right to the .dropdown-menu (take note: the caret
is now pointed up because the menu will be going up instead of down): 
<div class="btn-group dropup">
  <button class="btn">Dropup</button>
  <button class="btn dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown">
    <span class="caret"></span>
  </button>
  <ul class="dropdown-menu">
    <!-- dropdown menu links -->
  </ul>

Navigation Elements
Bootstrap provides a few different options for styling navigation elements. All of them
share the same markup and base class, .nav.
Bootstrap also provides a helper class, .active. In principle, it generally adds distinction
to the current element and sets it apart from the rest of the navigation elements. You
can add this class to the home page links or to the links of the page that the user is
currently on.

Tabular Navigation
To create a tabbed navigation menu (see Figure 3-10), start with a basic unordered list
with the base class of .nav and add .nav-tabs: 
<ul class="nav nav-tabs">
  <li class="active">
    <a href="#">Home</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#">Profile</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Messages</a></li>
</ul>
Figure 3-10. Tabbed navigation
Basic Pills Navigation
To turn the tabs into pills (see Figure 3-11), use .nav-pills instead of .nav-tabs: 
<ul class="nav nav-pills">
  <li class="active">
    <a href="#">Home</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="#">Profile</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Messages</a></li>
</ul>
Figure 3-11. Tabbed navigation
Disabled class
For each of the .nav classes, if you add the .disabled class, it will create a gray link that
also disables the :hover state (see Figure 3-12): 
<ul class="nav nav-pills">
  ...
  <li class="disabled"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
  ...
</ul>

Stackable Navigation
Both tabs and pills are horizontal by default. To make them appear vertically stacked,
just add the .nav-stacked class. See Figures 3-13 and 3-14 for examples of verticaly
stacked tabs and pills.
Here’s the code for stacked tabs:
<ul class="nav nav-tabs nav-stacked">
  ...
</ul>

Dropdowns
Navigation menus share a similar syntax with dropdown menus (see Figure 3-15). By
default, you have a list item that has an anchor working in conjunction with some data-
attributes to trigger an unordered list with a .dropdown-menu class: 
<ul class="nav nav-tabs">
        <li class="dropdown">
                <a class="dropdown-toggle"
                        data-toggle="dropdown"
                        href="#">
                        Dropdown
                        <b class="caret"></b>
                </a>
                <ul class="dropdown-menu">
      <li><a href="#">Action</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Another action</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Something else here</a></li>
      <li class="divider"></li>
      <li><a href="#">Separated link</a></li>
    </ul>
        </li>
</ul>
Figure 3-15. Tabbed navigation with a dropdown menu
To do the same thing with pills (Figure 3-16), simply swap the .nav-tabs class
with .nav-pills:
<ul class="nav nav-pills">
        <li class="dropdown">
                <a class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="#">
                        Dropdown
                        <b class="caret"></b>
                </a>
                <ul class="dropdown-menu">
                        <!--links-->
                </ul>
        </li>
</ul>

Navigation Lists
Navigation lists are useful when you need to display a group of navigation links. This
type of element is common when building admin interfaces. In the MAKE admin in‐
terface, for example, I have one of these on the sidebar of every page with quick links
to common pages (see Figure 3-17). Bootstrap developers use a form of this for their
documentation. Like all of the lists that we have discussed thus far, navigation lists are
unordered lists with the .nav class. To give it its specific styling, we add the .nav-
list class: 
<ul class="nav nav-list">
        <li class="nav-header">List Header</li>
        <li class="active"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Library</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Applications</a></li>
  <li class="nav-header">Another List Header</li>
  <li><a href="#">Profile</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Settings</a></li>
  <li class="divider"></li>
  <li><a href="#">Help</a></li>
</ul>
Horizontal divider
To create a divider, much like an <hr />, use an empty <li> with a class of .divider:
<ul class="nav-menu">
    ...
        <li class="divider"></li>
        ....
</ul>

Tabbable Navigation
Not only can you create a tabbed navigation, but by using the JavaScript plugin, you can
also add interaction by opening different windows of content (see Figure 3-18). To make
navigation tabs, create a .tab-pane with a unique ID for every tab, and then wrap them
in .tab-content:
<div class="tabbable">
        <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
           <li class="active"><a href="#tab1" data-toggle="tab">Meats</a></li>
           <li><a href="#tab2" data-toggle="tab">More Meat</a></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tab-content">
           <div class="tab-pane active" id="tab1">
                   <p>Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet jerky flank...</p>
           </div>
           <div class="tab-pane" id="tab2">
                   <p>Beef ribs, turducken ham hock...</p>
           </div>
        </div>
</div>

If you want to make the tabs fade when switching, add .fade to each .tab-pane.
Tab position
The tabs are fully positionable; you can have them above, below, or on the sides of the
content (see Figure 3-19).
Figure 3-19. Bottom tabs
Here’s the code for positioning tabs:
<div class="tabbable tabs-below">
  <div class="tab-content">
    <div class="tab-pane active" id="tab1">
      <p>I'm in Section A.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane" id="tab2">
      <p>I'm in Section B.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane" id="tab3">
      <p>I'm in Section C.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
    <li class="active"><a href="#tab1" data-toggle="tab">Section A</a></li>
    <li><a href="#tab2" data-toggle="tab">Section B</a></li>
    <li><a href="#tab3" data-toggle="tab">Section C</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
Tabs on the left (see Figure 3-20) get the .tabs-left class. For this, you need to swap
the tab content and the tabs:
<div class="tabbable tabs-left">
  <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
    <li class="active"><a href="#tab1" data-toggle="tab">Section A</a></li>
    <li><a href="#tab2" data-toggle="tab">Section B</a></li>
    <li><a href="#tab3" data-toggle="tab">Section C</a></li>
  </ul>
  <div class="tab-content">
    <div class="tab-pane active" id="tab1">
      <p>I'm in Section A.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane" id="tab2">
      <p>I'm in Section B.</p>

As a footnote to the tabbable elements, you can use the markup here to
control a variety of things that are perhaps outside of the scope of the
default usage mechanism. On MAKE’s site, I use this to control the
navigation and subnavigation. When you click on the navigation menu,
the subnavigation changes and shows different links.
Navbar
The navbar is a nice feature, and is one of the prominent features of Bootstrap sites (see
Figure 3-22). At its core, the navbar includes styling for site names and basic navigation.
It can later be extended by adding form-specific controls and specialized dropdowns.
To be sure that the navbar is constrained to the width of the content of the page, either
place it inside of a .span12 or the .container class: 
<div class="navbar">
  <div class="navbar-inner">
    <a class="brand" href="#">Title</a>
    <ul class="nav">
      <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
Figure 3-22. Basic navbar
Note the .brand class in the code. This will give the text a lighter font-weight and
slightly larger size.
<a class="brand" href="#">Project name</a>
Navbar Links
To add links to the navbar (see Figure 3-23), simply add an unordered list with a class
of .nav. If you want to add a divider to your links, you can do that by adding an empty
list item with a class of .divider-vertical: 
<ul class="nav">
  <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">First Link</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Second Link</a></li>

  <li class="divider-vertical"></li>
  <li><a href="#">Third Link</a></li>
</ul>
Figure 3-23. Nav links
Forms
Instead of using the default class-based forms from Chapter 2, forms that are in the
navbar use the .navbar-form class. This ensures that the form’s margins are properly
set and match the nav stylings (see Figure 3-24). Of note, .pull-left and .pull-
right helper classes may help move the form into the proper position: 
<form class="navbar-form pull-left">
        <input type="text" class="span2" id="fname">
        <button type="submit" class="btn">
</form>
Figure 3-24. Default navbar form
To add rounded corners (see Figure 3-25), as seen in the search inputs of iOS devices,
use the .navbar-search class instead of the .navbar-form: 
<form class="navbar-search"  accept-charset="utf-8">
        <input type="text" class="search-query" placeholder="Search">
</form>
Figure 3-25. Navbar search input
Navbar Menu Variations
The Bootstrap navbar can be dynamic in its positioning. By default, it is a block-level
element that takes its positioning based on its placement in the HTML. With a few helper

classes, you can place it either on the top or bottom of the page, or you can make it scroll
statically with the page.
Fixed top navbar
If you want the navbar fixed to the top, add .navbar-fixed-top to the .navbar class.
To prevent the navbar from sitting on top of other content in the body of the page, add
at least 40 pixels of padding to the <body> tag:
<div class="navbar navbar-fixed-top">
  <div class="navbar-inner">
    <a class="brand" href="#">Title</a>
    <ul class="nav">
      <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
Fixed bottom navbar
To affix the navbar to the bottom of the page, simply add the .fixed-navbar-bottom
class to the navbar. Once again, to prevent overlap, add at least 40 pixels of padding to
the <body> tag:
<div class="navbar navbar-fixed-bottom">
 <div class="navbar-inner">
    <a class="brand" href="#">Title</a>
    <ul class="nav">
      <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
Static top navbar
To create a navbar that scrolls with the page, add the .navbar-static-top class. This
class does not require adding the padding to the <body>:
<div class="navbar navbar-static-top">
  <div class="navbar-inner">
    <a class="brand" href="#">Title</a>
    <ul class="nav">
      <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>

Responsive navbar
Like the rest of Bootstrap, the navbar can be totally responsive as shown in
Figure 3-26. To add the responsive features, the content that you want to be collapsed
needs to be wrapped in a <div> with .nav-collapse.collapse as a class. The collapsing
nature is tripped by a button that has a the class of .btn-navbar and then features two
data- elements. The first, data-toggle, is used to tell the JavaScript what to do with
the button, and the second, data-target, indicates which element to toggle. Three
<spans> with a class of .icon-bar create what I like to call the hamburger button. This
will toggle the elements that are in the .nav-collapse <div>. For this feature to work,
the bootstrap-responsive.css and either the collapse.js or the full bootstrap.js files must
be included.
Figure 3-26. Responsive navbar
Use the following code to create a responsive navbar:
<div class="header">
  <div class="navbar-inner">
    <div class="container">
      <a class="btn btn-navbar" data-toggle="collapse"
      data-target=".nav-collapse">
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </a>

Inverted navbar
To create an inverted navbar with a black background and white text as shown in
Figure 3-27, simply add .navbar-inverse to the .navbar class: 
<div class="navbar navbar-inverse">
        ...
</div>
Figure 3-27. Inverted navbar
Breadcrumbs
Breadcrumbs are a great way to show hierarchy-based information for a site (see
Figure 3-28). In the case of blogs, breadcrumbs can show the dates of publishing, cat‐
egories, or tags. A breadcrumb in Bootstrap is simply an unordered list with a class
of .breadcrumb. There is a also a helper class of .divider that mutes the colors and
makes the text a little smaller. You can use forward slashes, arrows, or any divided that
you choose. Note that the divider in the breadcrumbs has a slightly different markup
than the navbar example.
The following code uses the class .breadcrumb:
<ul class="breadcrumb">
    <li><a href="#">Home</a> <span class="divider">/</span></li>
        <li><a href="#">2012</a> <span class="divider">/</span></li>
        <li><a href="#">December</a> <span class="divider">/</span></li>
        <li><a href="#">5</a></li>

Pagination
Bootstrap handles pagination like a lot of other interface elements, an unordered list,
with wrapper a <div> that has a specific class that identifies the element. In the basic
form, adding .pagination to the parent <div> creates a row of bordered links. Each of
the list items can be additionally styled by using the .disabled or .active class. See
Figures 3-29 and 3-30 for examples of this.
Here’s the code for basic pagination:
<div class="pagination">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">&laquo;</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">2</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">3</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">4</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">5</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">&raquo;</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

And here’s the code for pagination using helper classes:

    <li class="disabled"><a href="#">«</a></li>
    <li class="active"><a href="#">1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">2</a></li>

    <li><a href="#">4</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">5</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">»</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
Figure 3-30. Pagination with helper classes
In addition to the .active and .disabled classes for list items, you can
add .pagination-centered to the parent <div>. This will center the contents of the
<div>. If you want the items right-aligned in the <div>, add .pagination-right. For
sizing, in addition to the normal size, there are three other sizes that can be applied by
adding a class to the wrapper <div>: .pagination-large, .pagination-small,
and .pagination-mini (see Figure 3-31): 
<div class="pagination pagination-large">
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="pagination">
  <ul>

<div class="pagination pagination-small">

Figure 3-31. Pagination sizes
Pager
If you need to create simple pagination links that go beyond text, the pager can work
quite well. Like the pagination links, the markup is an unordered list that sheds the
wrapper <div>. By default, the links are centered (see Figure 3-32).
Figure 3-32. Basic pager
The following is the code for a basic pager:
<ul class="pager">
  <li><a href="#">Previous</a></li>
  <li><a href="#">Next</a></li>
</ul>
To left- or right-align the links, you just need to add the .previous and .next class as
to the list items (see Figure 3-33). Also, like .pagination in Figure 3-31, you can add
the .disabled class for a muted look.

  <li class="next">
    <a href="#">Newer &rarr;</a>
  </li>
</ul>
Labels
Labels are great for offering counts, tips, or other markup for pages. They’re another of
my favorite little Bootstrap touches. Figure 3-34 shows some labels that can be used.
Figure 3-34. Labels
Here’s the code to use these labels:
<span class="label">Default</span>
<span class="label label-success">Success</span>
<span class="label label-warning">Warning</span>
<span class="label label-important">Important</span>
<span class="label label-info">Info</span>
<span class="label label-inverse">Inverse</span>
Badges
Badges are similar to labels; the primary difference is that the corners are more rounded.
The colors of badges reflect the same classes as labels (see Figure 3-35).
Figure 3-35. Badges
The following code shows how to use badges:
<span class="badge">1</span>
<span class="badge badge-success">2</span>
<span class="badge badge-warning">4</span>
<span class="badge badge-important">6</span>

Typographic Elements
In addition to buttons, labels, forms, tables, and tabs, Bootstrap has a few more elements
for basic page layout.
Hero Unit
The hero unit is a large content area that increases the size of headings and adds a lot
of margin for landing page content (see Figure 3-36). To use the hero unit, simply create
a container <div> with the class of .hero-unit. In addition to a larger <h1>, the font-
weight is reduced to 200 : 
<div class="hero-unit">
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-style component for calling
  extra attention to featured content or information.</p>
  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-large">Learn more</a></p>
</div>
Figure 3-36. Hero unit
Page Header
The page header (see Figure 3-37) is a nice little feature to add appropriate spacing
around the headings on a page. This is particularly helpful on a blog archive page where
you may have several post titles and need a way to add distinction to each of them. To
use a page header, wrap your heading in a <div> with a class of .page-header:

<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Example page header <small>Subtext for header</small></h1>
</div>
Figure 3-37. Page header
Thumbnails
A lot of sites need a way to lay out images in a grid, and Bootstrap has an easy way to
do this. To create a thumbnail, add an <a> tag with the class of .thumbnail around an
image. This adds four pixels of padding and a gray border (see Figure 3-38). On hover,
an animated glow outlines the image.
Figure 3-38. Basic thumbnail
Use the following code to create a thumbnail:
<a href="#" class="thumbnail">
  <img alt="Kittens!" style="" src="http://placekitten.com/300/250">
</a>
Now that you have your basic thumbnail, you can add headings, buttons, and more as
shown in Figure 3-39; just change the <a> tag that has a class of .thumbnail to a
<div>. Inside of that <div>, you can add anything you need. Since this is a <div>, we
can use the default span-based naming convention for sizing. If you want to group
multiple images, place them in an unordered list, and each list item will be floated to
the left.

Figure 3-39. Extended thumbnail
The following code shows how to extend and add more to the thumbnail:
<ul class="thumbnails">
  <li class="span4">
    <div class="thumbnail">
      <img data-src="holder.js/300x200" alt="300x200" style="">
      <div class="caption">
        <h3>Meats</h3>
        <p>Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet sirloin pancetta shoulder tongue doner,
           shank sausage.</p>
        <p><a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Eat now!</a> <a href="#"
           class="btn">Later...</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="span4">
    ...
  </li>
</ul>
Alerts
Like the modals that will be described in Chapter 4, alerts provide a way to style messages
to the user (see Figure 3-40). The default alert is added by creating a wrapper <div> and
adding a class of .alert: 
<div class="alert">
    <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&times;</a>
    <strong>Warning!</strong> Not to be alarmist, but you have now been alerted.
</div>

Figure 3-40. Basic alert
The .alert uses the alerts jQuery plugin that is discussed in Chapter 4. To close the
alert, you can use a button that contains the data-dismiss="alert" attribute. Mobile
Safari and Mobile Opera browsers require an href="#" to close.
If you have a longer message in your alert, you can use the .alert-block class. This
provides a little more padding above and below the content contained in the alert, which
is particularly useful for multi-page lines of content (see Figure 3-41).
Figure 3-41. Alert block
There are also three other color options as shown in Figure 3-42 to help provide a more
semantic method for the alert. They are added by using either .alert-error, .alert-
success, or .alert-info.
Figure 3-42. Alert color options
Progress Bars
The purpose of progress bars is to show that assets are loading, in progress, or that there
is action taking place regarding elements on the page. Personally, I think that these
elements are just an exercise in markup and have little purpose beyond that in the

Bootstrap framework. That being said, among the thousands of people using Bootstrap,
there are likely a few outliers who have a good reason for building progress bars. By
nature, these are static elements that need some sort of JavaScript method to provide
any interaction.
The default progress bar has a light gray background and a blue progress bar as shown
in Figure 3-43. To create it, add a <div> with a class of .progress. Inside, add an empty
<div> with a class of .bar. Add a style attribute with the width expressed as a percentage.
I added style="60%"; to indicate that the progress bar was at 60%:
<div class="progress">
  <div class="bar" style="width: 60%;"></div>
</div>
Figure 3-43. Default progress bar
To create a striped progress bar (see Figure 3-44),1 just add .progress-striped to the
container <div>:
<div class="progress progress-striped">
  <div class="bar" style="width: 20%;"></div>
</div>
Figure 3-44. Striped progress bar
Like the striped version of the progress bar, you can animate the stripes (see Figure 3-45
for a static image of this), making it look like a blue light special barbershop pole.
Figure 3-45. Animated progress bar
Here’s the code to animate the progress bar:
Progress Bars

<div class="progress progress-striped active">
  <div class="bar" style="width: 40%;"></div>
</div>
In addition to the blue progress bar, there are options for green, yellow, and red using
the .bar-success, .bar-warning, and .bar-danger classes. Progress bars can be
stacked (see Figure 3-46), indicating a graph of sorts by adding multiple elements to‐
gether using this code:
<div class="progress">
  <div class="bar bar-success" style="width: 35%;"></div>
  <div class="bar bar-warning" style="width: 20%;"></div>
  <div class="bar bar-danger" style="width: 10%;"></div>
</div>

Media Object
When you look at social sites like Facebook, Twitter, and others, and strip away some
of the formatting from timelines, you will see the media object (see Figure 3-47). Driven
by the Bootstrap community and based on principles from the oocss community, the
goal of the media object is to make the code for developing these blocks of information
drastically shorter. Nicole Sullivan-Hass shares a few elements of the media object sim‐
ilar to Bootstrap’s on her site. The media object is designed to literally save hundreds of
lines of code, making it easy to customize.

Bootstrap leaves the design and formatting to you but provides a simple way to get going.
Like a lot of other tools in Bootstrap, the goal of media objects (light markup, easy
extendability) is achieved by applying classes to some simple markup. There are two
forms to the media object: .media and .media-list. Figure 3-48 shows the former form.
If you are preparing a list where the items will be part of an unordered list, use .media-
list. If you are using only just <div> elements, use the .media object:
<div class="media">
  <a class="pull-left" href="#">
    <img class="media-object" data-src="holder.js/64x64">
  </a>
  <div class="media-body">
    <h4 class="media-heading">Media heading</h4>
    <p>...</p>
    <!-- Nested media object -->
    <div class="media">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
Figure 3-48. Default media object
To use media list (shown in Figure 3-49), change the container <div> to an <ul> and
add the class .media-list. Since you can nest media objects, it is handy to markup for
comments or other lists.

      <p>...</p>

      <div class="media">

Miscellaneous
There are a few more Bootstrap components that we have yet to cover in this chapter.
Some of these components are layout-based, and a few are production-based helper
classes. The first among these are the wells.

Wells
A well is a container <div> that causes the content to appear sunken on the page (see
Figure 3-50). I have used wells for blog post meta information like author, date, and
categories. To create a well, simply wrap the content that you would like to appear in
the well with a <div> containing the class of .well:
<div class="well">
  ...
</div>
Figure 3-50. Well
There are two additional classes that can be used in conjunction with .well: .well-
large and .well-small. These affect the padding, making the well larger or smaller
depending on the class (see Figure 3-51).
Figure 3-51. Well optional classes
The following code uses the well classes:
<div class="well well-large">
  Look, I'm in a .well-large!
</div>
<div class="well well-small">
  Look, I'm in a .well-small!
</div>

Helper Classes
Here are some helper classes that might come in handy.
Pull left
To float an element to the left, use the .pull-left class:
<div class="pull-left">
  ...
</div>
.pull-left {
  float: left;
}
Pull right
To float an element to the right, use the .pull-right class:
<div class="pull-right">
  ...
</div>
.pull-right {
  float: right;
}
Clearfix
To clear the float of any element, use the .clearfix class. When you have two elements
of different sizes that are floated alongside each other, it is necessary to force the fol‐
lowing elements in the the code below or to clear the preceding content. You can do this
with a simple empty <div> with the class :of .clearfix:
<div class="clearfix"></div>
.clearfix {
  *zoom: 1;
  &:before,
  &:after {
    display: table;
    content: "";
  }
  &:after {
    clear: both;
  }
}

CHAPTER 4
Bootstrap JavaScript Plugins
The components discussed in Chapter 3 are just the beginning. Bootstrap comes bun‐
dled with 13 jQuery plugins that extend the features and can add more interaction to
your site. To get started with Bootstrap’s JavaScript plugins, you don’t need to be an
advanced JavaScript developer. In fact, by utilizing Bootstrap Data API, most of the
plugins can be triggered without writing a single line of code.
Overview
Bootstrap can be included on your site in two forms, either compiled or raw. In Bootstrap
2.2.2, the uncompressed file is 59KB and the minimized version is only 32KB. All of the
Bootstrap plugins are accessible using the included Data API. With this, you don’t need
to include a single line of JavaScript to invoke any of the plugin features.
Typically, JavaScript lies in a either a separate file or at the bottom of the page before the
closing </body> tag. You can either use the src attribute to link to another file, or you
can write the contents of the file between the opening and closing tags:
<!-- To reference another JavaScript file -->
<script src="assets/js/javaScript.js"></script>
<!-- To write JavaScript to the page -->
<script type="text/javaScript">
        function js_alert{
                alert('Page has loaded');
        }
</script>
Generally, it is best to include all JavaScript calls into a check that ensures that the DOM
has been loaded on the page. If you have the JavaScript trying to fire earlier, it may miss
elements as the browser parses the page. With jQuery, adding a check is easily done by
73
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
selecting the document or the entire content of the page, and then applying
the .ready() method:
$(document).ready(function(){
        alert('Page has loaded');
        // Once the page has loaded and is ready, an alert will fire.
});
As mentioned above, Bootstrap has a Data API where you can write data attributes into
the HTML of the page. If you need to turn off the Data API, you can unbind the attributes
by adding the following line of JavaScript:
$('body').off('.data-api')
If you need to disable a single plugin, you can do it programmatically using the name‐
space of the plugin along with the data-api namespace:
$('body').off('.alert.data-api')
Programmatic API
The developers of Bootstrap believe that you should be able to use all of the plugins
throughout the JavaScript API. All public APIs are single, chainable methods and return
the collection acted upon.
$('.btn.danger').button('toggle').addClass('active')
All methods should accept an optional options object, a string which targets a particular
method, or nothing (which initiates a plugin with default behavior).
$("#myModal").modal()   // initialized with defaults
$("#myModal").modal({ keyboard: false })        // initialized with no keyboard
$("#myModal").modal('show')        // initializes and invokes show immediately
Transitions
The transition plugin provides simple transition effects. A few examples include:
• Sliding or fading in modals
• Fading out tabs
• Fading out alerts
• Sliding carousel panes
Modal
A modal is a child window that is layered over its parent window (see Figure 4-1).
Typically, the purpose is to display content from a separate source that can have some
74 
| 
Chapter 4: Bootstrap JavaScript Plugins
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

interaction without leaving the parent window. Child windows can provide informa‐
tion, interaction, or more. I use them as a window for holding slideshows and login/
registration information. The modal plugin is probably one of my favorite Bootstrap
features.
To create a static modal window, use this code:
<div class="modal hide fade">
  <div class="modal-header">
    <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">
    &times;</button>
    <h3>Modal header</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="modal-body">
    <p>One fine body…</p>
  </div>
  <div class="modal-footer">
    <a href="#" class="btn">Close</a>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</a>
  </div>
</div>
Figure 4-1. Static modal window
To invoke the modal window, you need to have some kind of a trigger. Normally I use
a button or a link. If you look in the code below, you will see that in the <a> tag, the
href="myModal" is the target of the modal that you want to load on the page. This code
allows you to create multiple modals on the page and then have different triggers for
each of them. Now, to be clear, you don’t load multiple modals at the same time, but you
can create many on the page to be loaded at different times.
There are three classes to take note of in the modal. The first is .modal, which is simply
identifying the content of the <div> as a modal. The second is .hide, which tells the
browser to hide the content of the <div> until we are ready to invoke it. And last,
the .fade class. When the modal is toggled, it will cause the content to fade in and out.

    <button class="btn" data-dismiss="modal"
    aria-hidden="true">Close</button>
    <button class="btn btn-primary">Save changes</button>
  </div>
</div>
Usage
Using the Bootstrap JavaScript Data API, you simply need to pass a few data attributes
to toggle the slideshow. To start with, set data-toggle="modal" on the link or button
that you want to use to invoke the modal and then set the data-target="#foo" to the
ID of the modal that you’d like to use.
To call a modal with id="myModal", use a single line of JavaScript:
$('#myModal').modal(options)
Options
Options can either be passed in via data attributes or with JavaScript. To use the data
attributes, prepend data- to the option name (e.g., data-backdrop=""). See Table 4-1
for descriptions of some modal options.

As an example, after the modal is hidden, you could cause an alert to fire:
$('#myModal').on('hidden', function () {
         alert('Hey girl, I heard you like modals...');
})
Dropdown
The dropdown was covered extensively in Chapter 3, but the interaction was glossed
over. As a refresher, dropdowns can be added to the navbar, pills, tabs, and buttons.
Usage
To use a dropdown (Figure 4-2), add data-toggle="dropdown" to a link or button to
toggle the dropdown.
Figure 4-2. Dropdown within navbar
Here’s the code for developing a dropdown with data attributes:
<li class="dropdown">
  <a href="#" id="drop" role="button" class="dropdown-toggle"
  data-toggle="dropdown">Word <b class="caret"></b></a>
  <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="drop">
    <li><a tabindex="-1" href="#">MAKE magazine</a></li>
    <li><a tabindex="-1" href="#">WordPress DevelopmentS</a></li>
    <li><a tabindex="-1" href="#">Speaking Engagements</a></li>
    <li class="divider"></li>
    <li><a tabindex="-1" href="#">Social Media</a></li>
  </ul>
</li>
If you need to keep links intact (which is useful if the browser is not enabling JavaScript),
use the data-target attribute along with href="#":
<div class="dropdown">
  <a class="dropdown-toggle" id="dLabel" role="button"
  data-toggle="dropdown" data-target="#" href="/page.html">
    Dropdown
    <b class="caret"></b>

  </a>
  <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dLabel">
    ...
  </ul>
</div>
Dropdown Usage via JavaScript
To call the dropdown toggle via JavaScript, use the following method:
$('.dropdown-toggle').dropdown()
Method
The dropdown toggle has a simple method to show or hide the dropdown. There are
no options:
$().dropdown('toggle')
Scrollspy
The Scrollspy plugin (Figure 4-3) allows you to target sections of the page based on
scroll position. In its basic implementation, as you scroll, you can add .active classes
to the navbar based on the scroll position. To add the Scrollspy plugin via data attributes,
add data-spy="scroll" to the element you want to spy on (typically the body) and
data-target=".navbar" to the navbar that you want to apply the class changes to. For
this to work, you must have elements in the body of the page that have matching IDs of
the links that you are spying on.
Figure 4-3. Scrollspy example
Usage
For Scrollspy, you will need to add data-spy="scroll" to the <body> tag, along with
data-target=".navbar" that references the element that you are spying on:
<body data-spy="scroll" data-target=".navbar">...</body>
In the navbar, you will need to have page anchors that will serve as indicators for the
element to spy on:

<div class="navbar">
  <div class="navbar-inner">
    <div class="container">
      <a class="brand" href="#">Jake's BBQ</a>
      <div class="nav-collapse">
        <ul class="nav">
          <li class="active"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="#pork">Pork</a></li>
          <li><a href="#beef">Beef</a></li>
          <li><a href="#chicken">Chicken</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div><!-- /.nav-collapse -->
    </div>
  </div><!-- /navbar-inner -->
</div>
Usage via JavaScript
If you would rather invoke the scrollspy with JavaScript instead of using the data at‐
tributes, you can do so by selecting the element to spy on, and then invoking
the .scrollspy() function:
$('#navbar').scrollspy()
.scrollspy('refresh') Method
When calling the scrollspy via the JavaScript method, you need to call the .refresh
method to update the DOM. This is helpful if any elements of the DOM have changed.
$('[data-spy="scroll"]').each(function () {
        var $spy = $(this).scrollspy('refresh')
});
Options
Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, prepend the
option name to data-, as in data-offset="" (see Table 4-3).
Table 4-3. Scrollspy option

Type
Default
Description
offset
number 10
Pixels to offset from top of page when calculating position of scroll.
The offset option is handy when you are using a fixed navbar. You will want to offset
the scroll by about 50 pixels so that it reads at the correct time (see Table 4-4).

activate This event fires whenever a new item becomes activated by the scrollspy.
Toggleable Tabs
Tabbable tabs were introduced in Chapter 3. By combining a few data attributes, you
can easily create a tabbed interface (Figure 4-4). To do so, create the nav interface, and
then wrap the content of the tabs inside a <div> with a class of .tab-content: 
<ul class="nav nav-tabs">
    <li><a href="#home" data-toggle="tab">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#profile" data-toggle="tab">Profile</a></li>
        <li><a href="#messages" data-toggle="tab">Messages</a></li>
        <li><a href="#settings" data-toggle="tab">Settings</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="tab-content">
        <div class="tab-pane active" id="home">...</div>
        <div class="tab-pane" id="profile">...</div>
        <div class="tab-pane" id="messages">...</div>
        <div class="tab-pane" id="settings">...</div>
</div>

Usage
To enable the tabs, you can use the Bootstrap Data API or use JavaScript directly. With
the Data API, you need to add data-toggle to the anchors. The anchor targets will
activate the element that has the .tab-pane class and relative ID. Alternatively, data-
target="" may be used instead of href="#" to apply the same action. Here is one way
to enable tabs:
 $('#myTab a').click(function (e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        $(this).tab('show');
})
Here’s an example of different ways to activate tabs:
$('#myTab a[href="#profile"]').tab('show'); // Select tab by name
$('#myTab a:first').tab('show'); // Select first tab
$('#myTab a:last').tab('show'); // Select last tab
$('#myTab li:eq(2) a').tab('show'); // Select third tab (0-indexed)

Tabs panes have two different events that can be hooked into, as shown in Table 4-5.
Table 4-5. Toggleable tab events
Event
Description
show
This event fires on tab show, but before the new tab has been shown. Use event.target and event.related
Target to target the active tab and the previous active tab (if available), respectively.
shown
This event fires on tab show after a tab has been shown. Use event.target and event.relatedTarget to
target the active tab and the previous active tab (if available), respectively.
Here’s a code example of a shown method:
$('a[data-toggle="tab"]').on('shown', function (e) {
        e.target // activated tab
        e.relatedTarget // previous tab
})
For information about the .on method, refer to the jQuery website.
Tooltips
Tooltips (Figure 4-5) are useful when you need to describe a link or (used in conjunction
with the <abbr> tag) provide the definition of an abbreviation. The plugin was originally
based on the jQuery.tipsy plugin written by Jason Frame. Tooltips have since been up‐
dated to work without images, animate with a CSS animation, and work with the Boot‐
strap JavaScript API.

Figure 4-5. Tooltip placement
Usage
To add a tooltip, add rel="tooltip" to an anchor tag. The title of the anchor will be
the text of a tooltip. The following two examples show how to do this in the Bootstrap
Data API and JavaScript, respectively:
<a href="#" rel="tooltip" title="This is the tooltip">Tooltip Example</a>
$('#example').tooltip(options)
Options
Like all of the plugins, there are options that can be added via the Bootstrap Data API
or invoked via JavaScript. All options need to have data- prepended to them. So, the
title option would become data-title (see Table 4-6).
Table 4-6. Tooltip options

Default
Description
animation
Boolean
true
Applies a CSS fade transition to the tooltip.
html
Boolean
false
Inserts HTML into the tooltip. If false, jQuery’s text method will be used to insert content
into the dom. Use text if you’re worried about XSS attacks.
placement
string/function ‘top’
Specifies how to position the tooltip (i.e., top, bottom, left, or right).
selector
string
false
If a selector is provided, tooltip objects will be delegated to the specified targets.
title
string/function ''
The title option is the default title value if the title attribute isn’t present.
trigger
string
‘hover’
Defines how the tooltip is triggered: click, hover, focus, or manually.
delay
number/object
0
Delays showing and hiding the tooltip in ms—does not apply to manual trigger type.
If a number is supplied, delay is applied to both hide/show. Object structure is: delay:
{ show: 500, hide: 100 }
Methods
Here are some useful methods for tooltips.

Popover
The popover (see Figure 4-6) is a sibling of the tooltip, offering an extended view com‐
plete with a heading. For the popover to activate, a user just needs to hover the cursor
over the element. The content of the popover can be populated entirely using the Boot‐
strap Data API. This method requires a tooltip.

Alerts
With the Data API, it is easy to add dismiss functionality to alert messages (Figure 4-7).
Figure 4-7. Error alert message
86 
| 
Chapter 4: Bootstrap JavaScript Plugins
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Usage
You can close an alert manually with the JavaScript .alert() method or use data at‐
tributes in conjunction with an anchor or button.
Here is how to dismiss via JavaScript:
$(".alert").alert()
Here is how to dismiss via Data API:
<a class="close" data-dismiss="alert" href="#">&times;</a>
Close Method
To enable all alerts to be closed, add the following method. To enable alerts to animate
out when closed, make sure they have the .fade and .in class already applied to them.
$(".alert").alert('close')
Events
There are two events that can be tied to Bootstrap’s alert class as shown in Table 4-8.
Table 4-8. Alert class events
Event
Description
close
This event fires immediately when the close instance method is called.
closed
This event is fired when the alert has been closed (will wait for CSS transitions to complete).
As an example, if you wanted to trigger a function after an alert has closed, you could
use this function:
$('#my-alert').bind('closed', function () {
  // do something…
})
Buttons
Buttons were introduced in Chapter 3. With Bootstrap, you don’t need to do anything
to make them work as links or as buttons in forms. With this plugin you can add in
some interaction, such as loading states or button groups with toolbar-like functionality.
Loading State
To add a loading state to a button (shown in Figure 4-8), simply add data-loading-
text="Loading..." as an attribute to the button:
Buttons 
| 
87
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-loading-text="Loading...">
Submit!</button>
When the button is clicked, the .disabled class is added, giving the appearance that it
can no longer be clicked.
Figure 4-8. Loading button
Single Toggle
When clicking on a button with the data-toggle="button" attribute (Figure 4-9), a
class of .active is added:
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="button">Toggle
</button>
Figure 4-9. Toggle button
Checkbox Buttons
Buttons can work like checkboxes (as in Figure 4-10), allowing a user to select many of
the options in a button group. To add this function, add data-toggle="buttons-
checkbox" for checkbox style toggling on .btn-group: 
<div class="btn-group" data-toggle="buttons-checkbox">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Left</button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Middle</button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Right</button>
</div>

Radio Buttons
Radio buttons (Figure 4-11) function similarily to checkboxes. The primary difference
is that a radio button doesn’t allow for multiple selections—only one button in the group
can be selected. To add radio-style toggling on btn-group, add data-toggle="buttons-
radio": 
<div class="btn-group" data-toggle="buttons-radio">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Left</button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Middle</button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Right</button>
</div>
Figure 4-11. Radio buttons
Usage
The .button method can be applied to any class or ID. To enable all buttons in the .nav-
tabs via JavaScript, add the following code:
$('.nav-tabs').button()
Methods
The following methods are useful to use with buttons.
Toggle
Toggles push state. Gives the button the appearance that it has been activated:
$().button('toggle')
Loading
When loading, the button is disabled and the text is changed to the option from the
data-loading-text attribute:
<button type="button" class="btn" data-loading-text="loading stuff..." >...
</button>
Reset
Resets button state, bringing the original content back to the text. This method is useful
when you need to return the button back to the primary state:
$().button('reset')
Buttons

String
String in this method is referring to any string declared by the user:
$().button('string')
To reset the button state and bring in new content, use the string method:
<button type="button" class="btn" data-complete-text="finished!" >...</button>
<script>
  $('.btn').button('complete')
</script>
Collapse
The collapse plugin makes it easy to make collapsing divisions of the page (see
Figure 4-12). Whether you use it to build accordion navigation or content boxes, it
allows for a lot of content options. 
Figure 4-12. Accordion
The following code creates collapsible groups:
<div class="accordion" id="accordion2">
  <div class="accordion-group">
    <div class="accordion-heading">
      <a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion2"
      href="#collapseOne">
        Collapsible Group Item #1
      </a>
    </div>
    <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-body collapse in">
      <div class="accordion-inner">
        Anim pariatur cliche...

    <div id="collapseTwo" class="accordion-body collapse">
      <div class="accordion-inner">
        Anim pariatur cliche...
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
...
You can also use the data attributes to make all content collapsible:
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger" data-toggle="collapse"
data-target="#demo">
  simple collapsible
</button>
<div id="demo" class="collapse in"> … </div>
Usage
Via data attributes
Like all of the plugins that use the Data API, you can add all needed markup without
writing any JavaScript. Add data-toggle="collapse" and a data-target to the ele‐
ment to automatically assign control of a collapsible element. The data-target attribute
will accept a CSS selector to apply the collapse to. Be sure to add the class .collapse to
the collapsible element. If you’d like it to default open, include the additional class .in.
To add accordion-like group management to a collapsible control, add the data attribute
data-parent="#selector".
Via JavaScript
The collapse method can activated with JavaScript as well:
$(".collapse").collapse()
Options
The options listed in Table 4-9 can be passed via data attributes or with JavaScript.

After a <div> has been collapsed, you could use the following code to execute a function:
$('#myCollapsible').on('hidden', function () {
  // do something…
})
Carousel
The Bootstrap carousel (Figure 4-13) is a flexible, responsive way to add a slider to your
site. In addition to being responsive, the content is flexible enough to allow images,
iframes, videos, or just about any type of content that you might want. 
Figure 4-13. Carousel
The following code creates the Bootstrap carousel:
<div id="myCarousel" class="carousel slide">
  <!-- Carousel items -->
  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="active item">…</div>
    <div class="item">…</div>
    <div class="item">…</div>
  </div>
  <!-- Carousel nav -->
  <a class="carousel-control left" href="#myCarousel" data-slide="prev">&lsaquo;</a>
  <a class="carousel-control right" href="#myCarousel" data-slide="next">&rsaquo;</a>
</div>

Typeahead
Typeahead allows you to easily create typeahead inputs in forms (Figure 4-14). For
example, you could preload states in a state field or, with some JavaScript, get search
results using some AJAX calls.
Figure 4-14. Typeahead
Usage
Using Data API, you can add sources via the data-source attribute. Items should be
listed in either a JSON array or a function:
<input
        type="text"
        class="span3"
        data-provide="typeahead"
        data-items="4"

Affix
The affix plugin allows a <div> to become affixed to a location on the page. A common
example of this is social icons. They will start in a location, but as the page hits a certain
mark, the <div> will become locked in place and will stop scrolling with the rest of the
page.

Usage
To apply the affix plugin to a <div>, you can use either data attributes, or you can use
JavaScript directly. Note that you must position the element so that it can be affixed to
the page. Position is controlled by the data-spy attribute, using either affix, affix-
top, or affix-bottom. You then use the data-offset to calculate the position of the
scroll.
<div data-spy="affix" data-offset-top="200">
        ...
</div>
Option
Name
Type
Default Description
offset

Pixels to offset from screen when calculating position of scroll. If a single number is provided,
the offset will be applied in both top and left directions. To listen for a single direction or
multiple unique offsets, just provide an object offset: { x: 10 }. Use a function when
you need to dynamically provide an offset (useful for some responsive designs).

CHAPTER 5
Using Bootstrap
GitHub Project
Like a lot of great open source projects, the power of Bootstrap comes not just from the
developers at the core of the project but also from the development community that
supports it. GitHub is a large code repository for projects, and at time of writing, Boot‐
strap is the most popular project. With over 42,000 stars and over 10,000 forks, the
project is bustling with activity. As I mentioned in Chapter 1, if you want to use Boot‐
strap, you can simply download the .zip archive from the site, or you can download
using git.
For the uninitated, git is a free and open source version control system. Bootstrap and
a host of other projects manage everything using GitHub, which is an online code
repository for git projects. To download the source for Bootstrap, run the following
commands from the command line:
$ git clone https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git
Cloning Bootstrap will give you a full download of all the files—not just the CSS/Java‐
Script, but also all of the documentation pages and the LESS files for the dynamic Java‐
Script elements.
If desired, using the LESS files, you can compile your own version of Bootstrap with the
features or customizations that you need.
Customizing Bootstrap
You can download the source, or if you want to easily customize a few of the colors,
sizing, or plugins, you can cater the Bootstrap to your needs via the Bootstrap website.
99
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
When you use the customize page (Figure 5-1), you decide what components you need.
For example, you might choose to leave off all of the responsive features, or maybe you
would like to leave off the button classes that conflict with styles that you already have.
You can also opt out of any of the jQuery plugins. If you know that you aren’t going to
be using the modals or the carousel, you can leave it out of the build so that you have a
smaller file to request.
Figure 5-1. Customize page
Lastly, you can configure the LESS variables. Everything from column count to typog‐
raphy colors can be modified here. With these options, you can cater Bootstrap to your
needs.
Using LESS
There are a few different ways to use LESS with Bootstrap (Figure 5-2). The first, and
perhaps the easiest, is to use a preprocessor like CodeKit (Figure 5-3) or SimpLESS. You
can use these tools to watch certain files or folders. Then when you save any of those
files, they build the master CSS files. In addition to using traditional CSS techniques,
you can use advanced features like mixins and functions to dynamically change the look
of your site just by changing some variables.

Figure 5-2. Using Bootstrap with LESS
Figure 5-3. CodeKit and the Bootstrap code base
LESS is a dynamic stylesheet language for writing CSS. It allows you to write variables,
functions, and mixins for your CSS. The Bootstrap /less/ folder has a few files, but for
setting globals, check the variables.less and mixins.less files.
Customizing Bootstrap 
| 
101
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
In the variables.less file, you will find all of the global variables for Bootstrap. Let’s say
you wanted to change the color of all of the links. You would simply update LESS to
compile the CSS, and all of the links would change color.
/* Old Code */
@linkColor:                     #08c;
@linkColorHover:        darken(@linkColor, 15%);
/* New Code */
@linkColor:                     #7d00cc;
@linkColorHover:        darken(@linkColor, 15%);
Now, all links are changed to a purple color, and buttons and other interface elements
that call for @linkColor will be updated throughout your site.
In the beginning, I was really hesitant to use LESS. After all, I have been writing CSS for
a long time, and I didn’t feel the need to change. The nesting alone is such a huge
timesaver that I’m really glad to have added it to my workflow.
Text Snippets
To rapidly develop Bootstrap sites, I like to use Sublime Text 2 and the Bootstrap snippets
(shown in Figure 5-4) from DEVtellect on GitHub. This makes adding any component
as easy as adding a keyboard shortcut.
Figure 5-4. Bootstrap snippets

To install the snippets, clone the git repository into your packages folder:
git clone git@github.com:devtellect/sublime-twitter-bootstrap-snippets.git
There are clippings for lots of popular IDEs/text editors.
Photoshop Templates
In addition to snippets, there have been a few Photoshop documents of all of the Boot‐
strap markup elements. My favorite comes from Repix Design. Their website is shown
in Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-5. Repix design
Here are the features:
• Adjustable colors
• Separate layers
• Vector-based
The PSD is free, but the author requests that you pay with a tweet. Kind of a new spin
on the free-as-in-free-speech mantra of open source programming.

Themes
If you have a vanilla installation of Bootstrap, but want to add a bit of panache, there
are few different ways to find free, and premium themes for Bootstrap. My two favorites
are {Wrap}Bootstrap, and Bootswatch. Both have some great options, and make it easy
to get a new style on your site. 
Built with Bootstrap
If you are looking for even more inspiration, check out Built With Bootstrap, a Tumblr
that features screen grabs of user-submitted Bootstrap sites. It is a fun way to see the
sites using Bootstrap.
Conclusion
As you can see, whatever the project, Bootstrap can fill the needs of just about any Web
project. Its blend of responsive framework, extensive JavaScript plugins, and robust
interface components make developing easy, fast, and feature rich. It has been great
working with Bootstrap over the last year, and I look forward to the future development
of the project. Cheers, kudos, and all of the accolades to Jacob Thornton and Mark Otto
for creating a project that is so versatile and fun to develop around.

The animal on the cover of Bootstrap is the Finnhorse. The Finnhorse is the official
horse of Finland, and is nicknamed as the “universal horse” for its ability to meet the
agricultural, economic, and recreational needs that a person might require from a horse.
Though it has been fully bred and cultivated in Finland for centuries, the exact origin
of this horse is unknown.
The vast majority of Finnhorses are a chestnut color, with a very small percentage being
black, silver, or bay-colored. In the 1800s, the chestnut-colored Finnhorse only accoun‐
ted for roughly half the population, but through selective breeding throughout the 19th
and 20th centuries, most other genes were bred out, as it was determined that chestnut
was the original color of the breed and the national Finnish horse breeding association
sought to eliminate “foreign” colors. It was also selectively bred to be an average-sized
horse—the average height is 61 inches—with the ability and muscles to do hard labor
and the agility to be used for the purposes of riding or entertainment.
Today, most Finnhorses are used for harness racing and other recreational purposes. It
was originally the only horse used for racing in Finland, but after the middle of the 20th
century, other horses were introduced into the sport. The horse is also used frequently
at riding schools and for therapy.
The cover image is from a loose plate of German origin, exact source unknown. The
cover font is Adobe ITC Garamond. The text font is Adobe Minion Pro; the heading
font is Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is Dalton Maag’s Ubuntu Mono.
