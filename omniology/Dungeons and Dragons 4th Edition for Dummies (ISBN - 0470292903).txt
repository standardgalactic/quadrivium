About the Authors
Bill Slavicsek began playing the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS roleplaying game with
his friends during his formative teenage years in New York City. This was in
1977, the same year that Star Wars and Terry Brooks’s The Sword of Shannara
debuted. This trilogy of epic fantasy combined with comic books and horror
novels to forever influence Bill’s outlook on life and entertainment. In 1986,
Bill’s hobby became his career when he joined the staff of West End Games.
There, as an editor and game designer, Bill worked on a number of board
games and roleplaying games, including Ghostbusters, Paranoia, Star Wars:
The Roleplaying Game, and Torg: Roleplaying the Possibility Wars. Later, Bill
went on to use his vast knowledge of the Star Wars films and associated
extensions to write two editions of A Guide to the Star Wars Universe for
Lucasfilm, Ltd. (published by Del Rey Books). 
1n 1993, Bill joined the staff of TSR, Inc., then publishers of the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game lines, as a game designer and editor. His design credits for the
company include the Alternity Science Fiction Game (which he co-designed
with Richard Baker), the d20 Modern Roleplaying Game, the d20 Star Wars
Roleplaying Game, the Star Wars Miniatures Game, Urban Arcana, Council of
Wyrms, and the EBERRON Campaign Setting. 
Since 1997, Bill has been the R&D Director for Roleplaying Games, Book
Publishing, and D&D Games for Wizards of the Coast, Inc., the company that
now publishes all DUNGEONS & DRAGONS novels and game products. He oversaw
the creation of the d20 Roleplaying Game System and the newest edition of
the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. Bill leads a talented staff of game designers,
developers, and editors who produce award-winning game products for
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and other d20 System game lines, including roleplaying
game supplements and accessories, adventures and campaign books, and
prepainted plastic miniatures. He lives with his wife Michele, their cat Pooh,
and more comics, toys, and books than he knows what to do with — and
that’s okay by him. 
Richard Baker is an award-winning game designer and a best-selling author.
He’s worked on the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game lines since 1991. Rich traces his
D&D experience back to 1979, when he began playing the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game as a 7th-grader. He spent a significant amount of his high school and
college years playing D&D at every opportunity, and after serving as a sur-
face warfare officer in the United States Navy, Rich decided to take a shot at
working on the game he grew up playing — and so he joined the staff of TSR,
Inc. and became a game designer. 
Rich’s list of D&D design credits numbers over 60 game products, including
the Origins Award–winning Birthright Campaign Setting, the Alternity Science
Fiction Roleplaying Game (which he co-designed with Bill Slavicsek), and the

3rd Edition DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. He has also served as creative director
for the Alternity and FORGOTTEN REALMS game lines. As an author, Rich has
published ten fantasy and science fiction novels, including Swordmage, the
Last Mythal trilogy, and the New York Times bestseller Condemnation.
Rich is currently employed as a senior game designer at Wizards of the Coast,
Inc. and works every day on new products for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game.
He married his college sweetheart Kim in 1991; they have two daughters, Alex
and Hannah. When he’s not writing (a rare occurrence), Rich likes to hike in
the Cascades, play wargames, and root for the Philadelphia Phillies —
because somebody has to.
Dedication
Bill Slavicsek: To everyone who ever imagined an amazing adventure, I offer
this key to D&D. When I first found the game, it helped focus and expand my
imagination and creativity. And it was a lot of fun. Today, I still have fun play-
ing the game, and my gaming group meets every Thursday evening to brave
whatever new challenges I dream up for them. I hope you’ll find the same
outlet for imagination and fun as I’ve enjoyed for more than 30 years.
Richard Baker: To Kim, Alex, and Hannah for being patient with me through
nigh-constant work in evenings and on weekends for many months now. I
promise that I’m going to take my computer for a drive deep into the woods
sometime soon and leave it there so it can’t ever find its way home again.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Bill Slavicsek: The newest edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game owes its
existence to a lot of talented people. The work that Rich and I have done on
this For Dummies book would not have been possible if not for the original
effort of a formidable team of creatives and business people. Thank you to my
creative team on the massive redesign project, which included Rob Heinsoo,
Andy Collins, James Wyatt, Mike Mearls, Chris Perkins, Kim Mohan, Michele
Carter, and Jeremy Crawford. Also thank you to the brand team, who help
bring D&D products to market, which includes Liz Schuh, Scott Rouse, Kieren
Chase, Sarah Girard, Linae Foster, and Martin Durham.
I have to also acknowledge the efforts of the rest of my game design staff. This
amazing collection of designers, developers, and editors work every day to
push the envelope and expand the horizons of our products, and as much as 

I lead them, they influence the way I think about and approach game design
and D&D. Every part of this For Dummies book owes at least a little to the
ideas and work of Richard Baker, Greg Bilsland, Logan Bonner, Bart Carrol,
Bruce Cordell, Peter Lee, Stephen Radney-MacFarland, Julia Martin, David
Noonan, Peter Schaefer, Stephen Schubert, Chris Sims, Rodney Thompson,
Rob Watkins, Jennifer Clarke Wilkes, Steve Winter, and Chris Youngs.
Finally, thanks to everyone at Wiley Publishing who worked with us on this
book, including Amy Fandrei, Jean Nelson, and Virginia Sanders, and to every-
one at Wizards of the Coast, Inc. who help us make great games and other
great products on a regular basis.
Richard Baker: Many people of exceptional creativity have worked on the
D&D game over the years. Without the work of game designers, editors, and
artists such as Gary Gygax, Dave Arneson, Jim Ward, Kim Mohan, Zeb Cook,
Jeff Grubb, Steve Winter, Bruce Nesmith, Tim Brown, Troy Denning, Roger
Moore, Ed Greenwood, Mike Carr, Harold Johnson, Andrea Hayday, Jon
Pickens, Lawrence Schick, Skip Williams, Dave Sutherland, Jeff Easley, Larry
Elmore, and countless others, D&D would not have grown into the beloved
hobby of millions of fans across the world. Countless other authors, artists,
developers, and editors have contributed over the years; we’re sorry that 
we can’t thank them all.
A special acknowledgment is in order for Peter Atkinson, Ryan Dancey, and
other folks who were instrumental in bringing the D&D game and many of its
designers to Wizards of the Coast, Inc. Through their efforts, they reinvented
and reinvigorated the game at a difficult and crucial time in its life cycle.
I’d like to add a special thank you to good friends and colleagues who have
shared in my own D&D games over the years, including Ed Stark, John Rateliff,
David Eckelberry, Shaun and Miranda Horner, David Wise, Thomas Reid, David
Noonan, James Wyatt, Warren Wyman, Duane Maxwell, Andy Weedon, and
Dale Donovan. I’ve had a lot of fun saving the world with you guys!

Foreword
Y
ou have to realize that, if you've never played DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
before, I am incredibly jealous of you on two counts.
For one thing, you're about to experience a whole truckload of awesome firsts.
Your first dungeon, your first critical hit, your first dragon slain, your first go
at saving the world — all these await you. D&D is more than a game. It's an
operating system for the imagination, a tool to craft and share dreams of epic
battles, horrific villains, and noble heroes with your friends. If you've never
played the game before, you are in for a wild ride.
For another, you have a pair of experts showing you the ropes. Between the
two of them, Bill Slavicsek and Rich Baker have put more time into thinking,
writing, and building D&D than any other pair of game designers you could
name. Back in the day, learning D&D consisted primarily of getting the rules
wrong, arguing over what was supposed to happen next, and making things
up on the fly. If D&D is the imagination's operating system, then this book is
your user's manual.
You might be intimidated by the size of this book or the sheer length of D&D's
three core rulebooks: the Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide, and
the Monster Manual. Unlike many games, D&D isn't about memorizing the rules
and following them to the letter. Having a good time, telling an exciting story,
and hanging out with your friends is more important than getting everything
right. D&D is a cooperative game where you and your friends work together.
That applies equally to fighting a dragon and to learning the rules. So, if you
have any worries about memorizing the entire game, set them aside. The rules
are there to keep everything organized, make things fair for everyone, and help
determine what happens next. They're guidelines, not inalterable, unquestion-
able laws.
As you set out on your career as a D&D player, allow me to offer my own little
contribution to your growing understanding of the game. The nice thing about
writing a foreword is that I get in a word before Bill and Rich. So, here's my bit
of advice:
Thou shalt be a hero. If there is a dragon that needs slaying, a kingdom that
needs liberating, or a demon that needs to be chased back to the Abyss, draw
your sword, ready your spells, and leap to action. All of us are great in our
dreams, and D&D is where our dreams come a little bit closer to life.

Have fun, may you roll many 20s, and may the orcs, trolls, and giants you face
be plagued with rolling 1 after 1. (Don't worry! Just read ahead and soon that
will make perfect sense.)
—Mike Mearls
Mike is Lead Game Developer for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game at Wizards
of the Coast. In addition to all the work Mike has done on the 4th Edition of the
game, he has co-authored a number of 4E adventures, including Keep on the
Shadowfell, Thunderspire Labyrinth, and Pyramid of Shadows.

Introduction
You crave action and adventure. You revel in the fantastic. You want to
play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game has been
around for more than 30 years, and it stands as the pinnacle of fantasy-
adventure games (also known as roleplaying games). The concepts and play
patterns of D&D (as it is affectionately referred to) harken back to the games
of make-believe that almost everyone played as a little kid. However, D&D
provides form and structure, making game play more satisfying and robust
for kids and adults alike.
This book makes the mysterious and often arcane world of fantasy roleplay-
ing games — specifically the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Roleplaying Game, 4th
Edition — easier to understand and faster to get into. Get ready to expand
your imagination, roll some dice, and battle dragons and other magical 
monsters.
About This Book
We originally wrote this book to make our favorite hobby game more accessi-
ble to every fantasy and gaming fan, from the novice who enjoys fantasy
novels or films such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy and has a passing curios-
ity about the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, to the seasoned D&D player who
goes to every convention and has been playing since Gary Gygax and Dave
Arneson published the White Box version of the game. Whether you have yet
to play your first game or have been in a regular gaming group for years, our
mission is to measurably increase the fun you have playing D&D and your
proficiency with the game.
Moreover, Wizards of the Coast, Inc. just released the 4th Edition of the
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, and with a new edition comes a whole new series
of opportunities to get in on the fun. But there are also changes to help you
navigate through, new concepts to explain, and new challenges to help you
overcome. We figured the best time to update Dungeons & Dragons For
Dummies was in conjunction with the new edition of the game.
As a new player, you discover the basics of the game. You end up with a char-
acter to play and enough understanding to confidently take your place at any
gaming table. Read this book today, grab a copy of the D&D Player’s Handbook,
and you can play tomorrow without worry or confusion. D&D is a game.
Games are fun. We hope to make learning to play fun, too.

As experienced players, we help you immediately get up to speed on the new
systems. We provide lots of hints and tips to elevate your level of play.
Character creation, character advancement, combat and encounter strate-
gies, game mastering — we cover it all. It doesn’t matter if you’ve played
once or a hundred times; you can find something in this book to make you a
better D&D player or game master (called a Dungeon Master in D&D lingo).
Why You Need This Book
Novices need Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies because it’s writ-
ten by D&D experts to serve as the most comprehensive introduction to the
D&D game. In this book, you can find out things about D&D and fantasy role-
playing that many seasoned gamers still haven’t discovered. Do you know the
ins and outs of opportunity attacks? What the best class and race combos
are? How to make the most of your character’s key abilities? Which monsters
can be brought down by which powers and weapons? You can find the
answers to all kinds of D&D questions within these pages. And what if you
already know a lot about the game? Get ready to discover a good deal more.
We’ve filled this book with inside tips and behind-the-curtain details that you
rarely encounter outside the hallowed walls of Wizards of the Coast.
We believe that DUNGEONS & DRAGONS speaks to and feeds the human condi-
tion. D&D is a game of the imagination, building on the myths and fantasies
that have shaped our culture. D&D is a game of endless possibilities, where
the only limit on what can happen is what you can imagine. D&D is a social
experience, a fun and exciting activity that combines group storytelling and
fantasy iconology with strategic challenges and dice rolling. Nothing else —
no computer game, no board game, no movie — comes close to delivering
the interactive and unlimited adventure of the D&D experience.
From the days of telling stories around a campfire about trolls and dragons
and knights in shining armor to the high-tech equivalent that involves com-
puters and high-speed Internet connections, make-believe has advanced
along with society. Today, one of the purest expressions of the game is
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. No other outlet for the adventures of armored warriors
and powerful wizards is as versatile, creative, or fun as D&D. So get out there
and explore some dungeons and bash some monsters!
How to Use This Book
There’s no right or wrong way to use this book. Read it from cover to cover or
glance at the Table of Contents and dive into the sections that most interest
you. If you’re a new player, we suggest starting with Part I. You also want to
2
Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies 

become intimately familiar with the glossary and refer to it often as you
explore these pages. If you have a few games under your belt and you’re look-
ing to become a better player, check out Parts II and III. Experienced players
will want to look at Part III for insights into the nuances of the game. And if you
like to be Dungeon Master (or you aspire to this position), you should dive into
Part IV. Longtime players and folks who are new to the world of DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS can find something fun and interesting in the Parts of Tens.
Much of this book is written with the assumption that you have a D&D Player’s
Handbook. We don’t replace the D&D game rules in this book; instead, we try
to make them clearer and help you navigate your way through them with
inside tips and advice. In addition, you need a set of dice (see Chapter 1 for
details) to use the practice sessions presented in later chapters.
How This Book Is Organized
Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies consists of five parts. The chap-
ters within each part cover specific topics in detail. In each chapter, we start
with the basics and build from there. Whenever a point needs further clarifi-
cation, we cross-reference the appropriate chapter so you can immediately
find any additional information you need. In addition, whenever it comes up,
we refer you to the appropriate chapter in the D&D Player’s Handbook or, if
necessary, one of the other two books that make up the core rules of the
game, the Dungeon Master’s Guide and the Monster Manual. 
Part I: D&D Crash Course
This is your character and these are the dice you roll. We start out with a
basic overview of the D&D game, assuming that you’re a brand-new player
who’s looking to join an existing gaming group. We give you a little history on
how the game began and how it developed, and we provide you with ready-
to-play characters (called pregenerated characters) so you can join a game
right now. We finish off this section with a discussion on starting your own
game, just in case you don’t currently know anyone who plays.
Part II: Building a D&D Character
Using a pregenerated character is fine, but eventually you’ll want to build a
character of your very own. In this part, we explain the fine points of charac-
ter creation and go behind the scenes to discuss character advancement.
After all, where your character ends up might be more important than where

Introduction

he or she started. This part of the book is for the player who wants to
become more invested in the D&D game. We help you navigate the Player’s
Handbook so that you can make solid, informed decisions about what kind of
character you want to build and play.
Part III: Playing Your Best Game
Even expert players should find something new and informative in this part
of the book. From effective combat tactics to powerful character combina-
tions, from the basics of adventuring-party teamwork to advice on good role-
playing, we offer insights into the mechanics of the game and how to be the
best D&D player you can be.
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering
The earlier parts of the book spend a lot of time offering advice and tactics to
players. Here’s where we provide tips and tricks to that select and important
individual who makes every D&D game come alive — the Dungeon Master. It’s
good to be the DM, and this section of the book starts with the basics of
DMing and builds to provide insights that should give even experienced DMs
something to think about when running their own games.
Part V: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book is complete without this section of top ten lists.
Helpful and interesting collections of the best powers, monsters, and
resources abound throughout these short chapters.
And finally, perhaps the most important part of this book, the glossary helps
you navigate and understand the terms and jargon that pervade the D&D
game. Use the glossary often as you use this book and the core D&D rule-
books.
Be sure to check out the color pages in this book. They feature fantastic, 
full-color artwork of several different D&D monsters and races.
Icons Used in This Book
To guide you along the way and to point out information you really need to
know, this book uses the following icons:
4
Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies 

This icon points to tips and tricks that make some aspect of the D&D game
easier or faster.
Remember these important nuggets and you’ll be a better player or DM.
If you see this icon, read and follow the accompanying directions. This infor-
mation can prevent you (or your character) from having a very bad day.
Whenever you see this icon, you know we’re directing you to more detailed
information in one of the core D&D rulebooks — the Player’s Handbook,
Dungeon Master’s Guide, or Monster Manual.
This takes you to the D&D Insider Web site, where you can get more informa-
tion, use interactive tools and demos, and talk to other D&D players via 
message boards to find out more about the game.
Where Do I Go From Here?
If you’re a new player, get a copy of the D&D Player’s Handbook. If you aspire
to be a Dungeon Master, you also need the Dungeon Master’s Guide and the
Monster Manual. But don’t read them yet! Start by digging into the chapters in
Part I of this book. We wrote that section specifically to help new players
enter the D&D game.
If you’ve played a time or two (or two hundred!), check out Parts II, III, and IV
for D&D gaming advice that anyone interested in the game can use. Part IV is
especially relevant to you if you want to be the Dungeon Master or improve
your already-formidable DMing skills.
Our last bit of advice before you move on (and see all the other advice we’ve
packed between these yellow covers) is this: Have fun! D&D is a game. The
basics of D&D are straightforward and relatively easy to grasp. Don’t let all
the details beyond that frighten or confuse you. We’re here to help with that,
so trust us and let us do our job. For the majority of D&D players around the
world, those added details are what make D&D one of the greatest ways they
know for spending their leisure time. Explore those details with us, and we
think you’ll come to the same conclusion.

Part I
D&D Crash Course

In this part . . .
I
n this part of the book, we assume that you’re a brand-
new player to DUNGEONS &DRAGONS 4th Edition. We
start out with a bit of background about the D&D game,
and then we dive in and show you how to join an ongoing
gaming group. With ready-to-play characters and an over-
view of the basic rules of play, you can get up to speed
quickly and start bashing monsters with the best of them.
Near the end of this part, we also offer advice on starting
your own gaming group, providing you with every oppor-
tunity for getting into the D&D experience!

E
veryone played make-believe during childhood. Whether you played
cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, superheroes, or firefighters, you
opened up your imagination and pretended to be something other than your-
self. DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is a game of the imagination, a roleplaying game
where players take on the roles of amazing heroes in a medieval fantasy set-
ting. It’s just like make-believe, only more sophisticated, grown up, and fun.
D&D gives form and structure to your imagination, creating a leisure activity
that’s more interactive and open-ended than any movie, novel, or computer
game.
The backdrop for D&D is a mythological world of fairy tales, epic adventures,
and monsters, where heroes gain power and magic to win against all kinds of
challenges and villains. This backdrop owes much to fantasy novels, includ-
ing The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien, but also to a sort of collec-
tive consciousness consisting of material from comic books, TV shows,
movies, and other fantasy-related influences. Over the course of more than 
30 years, D&D has, in turn, influenced such media and helped set the stage
for the computer game industry. This chapter provides an overview of the
game and explores some of the topics that we discuss in greater detail
throughout the book.

What Is D&D?
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Roleplaying Game is full of fantastic locations,
strange creatures, magic items, treasure, and lots of monsters. Imagine an
ancient place and time. Imagine a world much like our own, long ago, where
armored warriors use swords and bows, castles sit atop wooded hills, and
thatched cottages clump together here and there across the countryside.
10
Part I: D&D Crash Course 
The origin of D&D
It started with wargames, a popular pastime in
which participants re-create famous battles on
a tabletop using metal figures. In the mid-1960s,
Gary Gygax formed a small group of wargamers
who met regularly and set out to publish new
wargames. This led to the development of the
Chainmail miniatures rules, and by 1971, Gygax
added supplemental rules that expanded the
game to include fantastic creatures such as
elves, dwarves, and monsters.
In 1972, Dave Arneson came to Gygax with a
new take on the traditional wargame. Gone
were the massive armies. Each player had a
single character like the “hero” characters in
Chainmail. A storyteller ran the game, unfolding
a narrative in which the players were free to
choose their own courses of action for their
characters. This was a cooperative experience,
not a competitive wargame, in which the play-
ers joined forces to defeat villains and gain
rewards.
This combination of miniatures gaming and
player imagination created a totally new expe-
rience. Gygax and Arneson collaborated on a
set of rules, but they weren’t able to find a pub-
lisher. So in 1974, Gygax formed a company (that
eventually was called TSR, Inc.) and published
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS himself.
In 1977, the rules were totally rewritten, and the
original DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Basic Set was
released. Sales rose rapidly, and the game
became a phenomenon. A year later, a new 
version of the game, Advanced DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS (AD&D), was introduced, published in
a series of high-quality hardcover books.
The 1980s continued to see remarkable growth
for the game, and new initiatives started during
this decade. D&D novels were introduced, a
cartoon series debuted on Saturday morning 
TV, and new fantasy worlds (called campaign
settings) for D&D such as DRAGONLANCE and
FORGOTTEN REALMS appeared. In 1989, the second
edition of AD&D hit the shelves, and the 1990s
saw the birth of even more campaign settings,
including RAVENLOFT, DARK SUN, and PLANESCAPE.
In 1997, TSR changed hands. Wizards of the
Coast, makers of the phenomenal trading card
game MAGIC: THE GATHERING, purchased the com-
pany and moved most of the creative staff to
its offices in Washington State. In 2000, the 3rd
edition of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game was
released.
In 2008, D&D 4th Edition hit the shelves. The
newest edition concentrates on making a great
game even better, ratcheting up the fun and
speed of play, as well as adding online compo-
nents via the D&D Insider Web site (www.
dndinsider.com). Today the game is more
popular than ever. Some 5 million people play
D&D every month, using their imaginations and
having fun with their friends.

Imagine that in this ancient time magic really works, and that humans aren’t
the only intelligent species roaming the land.
D&D lets you explore this imaginary world. With the game, some willing
friends, and your imagination, you strike out on epic quests set in this long-
ago place that never existed but is as familiar as your own recollections. The
D&D game lets you participate in the ultimate interactive story. In this story,
you and the other players determine what happens next. How does the
adventure end? That’s the best part — the ending isn’t determined until you
and your character get there!
For a number of reasons, D&D is different from other games you may have
played:
 The play keeps on going. Like an ongoing television series, your game
continues from play session to play session.
 Your character grows as the game goes on. You play a character 
that grows and develops with every adventure in which he or she 
participates.
 The only limit is your imagination. The game offers endless possibili-
ties and a multitude of choices because your character can do whatever
you can imagine.
 Everyone wins. Because the game is really a series of stories told collec-
tively by the players and the Dungeon Master, D&D is a game where
everyone wins. If your character survives and wins the day (or dies
spectacularly and memorably) and everyone has a good time, then the
adventure ends in a win for the group.
11
Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure
D&D: It’s good for you
A few times over the long history of the
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, some people have
tried to knock it as something silly or even harm-
ful. Nothing could be further from the truth. D&D
promotes teamwork and socialization. It
teaches math and reading skills. It encourages
creativity and imaginative problem solving. It’s
uplifting, inspirational, and thought provoking.
And it’s fun, too! You sit in the same room with
other people, socialize, and create amazingly
deep fantasy worlds in which good battles evil
on a regular basis — and good usually wins out
in the end. What could be better than that?

Objectives of the D&D Game
D&D is a cooperative game, not a competitive one. In other words, you don’t
compete against the other players and you don’t win by beating them.
Instead, there are a lot of different ways to “win” the game. The common
denominator in every victory condition is fun. If you and the other players
have fun, everyone wins a game of D&D.
Storytelling
One way to “win” a D&D game is to help the group tell a fun and exciting
story. Whether you successfully complete your adventure or fail miserably, if
everyone has a good time and you contribute to creating a story that every-
one is going to remember, the group wins.
Unlike other games, each D&D adventure that you play is just one tale in the
continuing saga of your player character and the other characters in your
group. Of course, you can play a single game session and have a great time,
but the real excitement and power of the D&D game comes from the continu-
ing story as your character improves and develops from one adventure to the
next. A continuing storyline means that events have consequences. If you
find a magic weapon or a potion in one adventure, for example, you can use it
in the next. And that evil necromancer that got away? Watch out! He is likely
return in a future adventure to cause more trouble, just like villains in novels,
TV series, and movies.
Adventure goals
Every adventure contains its own set of victory conditions. Sometimes it’s as
simple as surviving the dungeon and escaping, or defeating the boss villain at
the heart of the fortress of evil. Other times, you might have a specific goal to
accomplish (take the evil ring and toss it in the volcano) or a specific mon-
ster to beat (stop the werewolf before it rampages through the town again). If
you achieve the objective of the adventure, the group wins.
Character victories
When you begin playing D&D, your character starts out at 1st level — the
lowest experience level. Your character wins each time he or she defeats
12
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

monsters and gains experience points and treasure. With each new level your
character gains, he or she increases in power and reputation. Each increase
in wealth, power, and equipment is a win for your character.
Looking at the Components of the Game
You need three distinct components to play a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game:
 Players: You need players, usually two to six of them, to take on the
roles of adventurers in the fantasy world. The adventurers controlled by
the players are also called heroes or player characters (PCs, for short).
 A Dungeon Master: The Dungeon Master (DM) controls all the nonplayer
characters (NPCs) — the monsters, villains, and other incidental charac-
ters that inhabit the fantasy world. The DM sets the pace of the story
and referees the action as the adventure unfolds.
 An adventure: An adventure is the activity that the player characters
participate in. An adventure usually consists of a basic plot and a
number of encounters. As the players (through their characters) inter-
act with the plot and resolve the encounters, they help the DM tell a
story. The cool thing is that every action the player characters perform
affects the twists and turns of the plot, so that the outcome of the adven-
ture winds up surprising everyone.
The following sections give more details about all the various parts of the
D&D experience.
Players and characters
The action revolves around the characters in a D&D game just as it does
around the protagonists of a novel or the heroes of a movie. Each player cre-
ates a character (or selects a ready-to-play character, such as the ones pre-
sented in Chapters 3 through 6), a heroic adventurer who is part of a team
that regularly delves into dungeons and battles monsters. These characters
include mighty fighters, brave clerics, cunning rogues, and powerful wizards.
You get to play the game while your character takes all the risks.
Playing a D&D character is kind of like acting, except everything happens
around the gaming table. You don’t have to deliver lines or perform stunts.
Just find a comfortable seat, explain what your character is doing, and roll
some dice to determine the outcome. The scene plays out in your imagina-
tion and in the imaginations of the other players.
13
Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure

The Dungeon Master
One player has a special role in a D&D game. This player, the Dungeon Master
(or DM), controls the pace of the story and referees the action along the 
way. Every D&D game needs a Dungeon Master — you can’t play the game
without one.
The cool thing about Dungeon Masters is that they allow the game to be
totally interactive and open-ended. Players can have their characters attempt
anything they can imagine because there’s a real, live person sitting in the
DM’s chair, coordinating the action and determining how every event adds to
the story. The game rules and the dice help, but the DM must use his or her
imagination to make the world unfold.
The player who decides to take on the role of the Dungeon Master becomes a
member of a select group. Not everyone has the dedication and creativity to
be a DM, but those who do have a great outlet in the D&D game. The DM
defines the game his or her group is going to play, and a good DM results in a
great game of D&D.
Some groups use multiple DMs so that everyone gets to run a player charac-
ter at some point, and all who want to try their hands at DMing get the oppor-
tunity. Other groups go for years with the same player serving as DM for
every game session. It all depends on the desires of the group and the per-
sonalities involved.
The adventure
The player characters are the stars of your D&D game, just like the heroes in
books or movies. They are adventurers, and adventurers need adventures. 
A D&D adventure features action, combat, mystery, challenges, and lots and
lots of monsters. Adventures come in three forms: full-length adventures 
published specifically for D&D, adventure hooks in published products that
DMs can turn into full-length adventures, and adventures that DMs create for
themselves.
Adventures can be as simple as a basic dungeon crawl or as complex as a
murder mystery. An adventure can last for a single game session or stretch
out over a number of sessions of play. One adventure might take place in a
haunted castle, another in a crime-ridden village, a third in the catacombs
beneath an ancient graveyard. What makes D&D different from your typical
board game is that each adventure is just a single tale in the continuing saga
of your player characters. Adventures provide the stage upon which your
player characters perform heroic deeds and resolve legendary quests.
Anything is possible in a D&D game, and it is through adventures that the
possibilities come alive.

Supplies you need
Players and characters, a Dungeon Master, and an adventure — these are the
basic components of any DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. However, you need a few
supplies to get the most out of the experience. These supplies include the 
following items, which we explain in more detail shortly:
 The D&D game itself
 Special dice
 Character sheets
 D&D Miniatures and D&D Dungeon Tiles
 Pencils and lots of paper
 An Internet connection, if you want to use the tools and game aids 
available at www.dndinsider.com
You can find a selection of D&D rulebooks and supplements at most book-
stores. But for the miniatures, dice, D&D Dungeon Tiles, and other items, your
best bet is a hobby game store. You can also find many sources for gaming
supplies online, such as www.amazon.com, www.chessex.com, or
www.gamestation.net.
The D&D game
This For Dummies book is a great place to start, but eventually you’ll need
other products and books to get the most from the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
Roleplaying Game. Beginners should pick up the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
Roleplaying Game Starter Set, which includes the basic rules, dice, and many
of the other components discussed in this section, all in one convenient box.
If you want to progress beyond the basics, you need the three 4th Edition
core books, all published by Wizards of the Coast, that make up the full 
D&D game:
 Player’s Handbook: Presents the rules of the game from the player’s
point of view and provides details on creating characters, outfitting
adventurers, and playing the game.
 Dungeon Master’s Guide: Presents the rules of the game from the
Dungeon Master’s point of view and provides detailed advice on running
games, creating adventures, sustaining campaigns, and awarding experi-
ence to player characters.
 Monster Manual: Presents hundreds of creatures to use in any D&D
game. From low-level to high-level, friendly to hostile, each creature has
an illustration, game tactics, and statistics for ease of use.
15
Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure

The DM needs all three books, but players can get by with just a copy of the
Player’s Handbook.
Dice
You roll dice to determine the outcome of actions in the game. If you want
your character to try something — such as attack the ogre, disarm the trap,
or search for clues — you use the dice whenever the result isn’t a sure thing.
The D&D game uses dice of different shapes. Each player should have his or
her own set of dice with which to play the game. Players get possessive and
protective of their dice, and having your own set means you can customize it.
(Dice come in all kinds of styles and colors.) Game play also proceeds more
smoothly when you don’t have to pass the dice around for sharing among
players.
A set of dice for the D&D game includes at least the following (see Figure 1-1):
 One four-sided die (referred to as a d4)
 One six-sided die (d6)
 One eight-sided die (d8)
 One ten-sided die (d10)
 One twelve-sided die (d12)
 One twenty-sided die (d20)
The d20 determines character success at any given action, and the other dice
determine what happens if an action succeeds.
Character sheets
Your D&D character is defined by a series of key statistics, as well as by the
background story you create for the character. These statistics and other key
information are contained on a character sheet. As your character partici-
pates in adventures, these statistics change.

Part I: D&D Crash Course 

This book contains a series of basic character sheets that provide ready-to-
play characters. You can find these in Chapters 3 through 6.
Wizards of the Coast provides blank character sheets in the form of PDF files
that you can download and print (at www.dndinsider.com).
D&D Miniatures and D&D Dungeon Tiles
Although most of the action of D&D occurs in the imaginations of the partici-
pants, it’s often very helpful to display certain information where everyone
can see it. Combat situations, for example, work better when the players and
DM know where all the participants are (characters and monsters) in relation
to one another. D&D uses a grid of one-inch squares to represent where the
action takes place. To represent the characters and monsters, the players
and DM place miniatures or other markers on the grid.
Look for official D&D Dungeon Tiles, high-quality cardstock tiles that you can
configure to create any dungeon you can imagine. These make a great play
surface for the game. When these are combined with official D&D Miniatures,
which present heroic characters and monsters right out of the Monster Manual
in detailed, prepainted plastic, every adventure you have comes to life.
You can find other play surfaces in the D&D Roleplaying Game Starter Set, in
D&D adventures, and online at www.dndinsider.com.
Pencils, paper, and graph paper
You need a means for keeping notes and recording important information
during game play, so have a lot of pencils, scrap paper, and graph paper avail-
able. Use the scrap paper for notes about the adventure. (Write down the
names of NPCs and places, any treasure your character acquires, and any
other details that you might forget or think may be important later.)
One player might take the role of note keeper, or each player may want to
take his or her own notes. Use the graph paper to sketch a map of the area
the PCs are exploring — players want to map the dungeon as they explore it,
and the DM uses graph paper to design the whole dungeon before the adven-
turers enter it.
One Game Rule to Rule Them All
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is built around a core mechanic. This core
mechanic is used to resolve all actions in the game, keeping play fast and
intuitive.
17
Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure

The core game mechanic: Whenever your character attempts an action that
has a chance of failure associated with it, roll a twenty-sided die (d20). The
higher the roll, the better the character’s chances of succeeding in that action.
18
Part I: D&D Crash Course 
Expressions of D&D
The primary expression of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
takes the form of the D&D roleplaying game
(RPG). This is where the whole thing started,
and the RPG is still going strong after more than
30 years. This expression is presented in the
three 4th Edition core rulebooks (Player’s
Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and
Monster Manual) and a plethora of supple-
ments and accessories that expand the world
of D&D. This For Dummies book focuses on the
RPG experience and tries to make it clearer and
easier to get into. But other expressions of D&D
exist. Here are a few that you might want to
check out:
 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Miniatures: Official
D&D prepainted plastic miniatures are
available for use with the RPG. From hero
characters to monsters such as bugbears,
mind flayers, beholders, and more, a wide
selection of the most popular and iconic
D&D creatures can be found in randomly
assorted booster packs. These miniature
figures can also be used for a more com-
petitive experience, a head-to-head skir-
mish game where players create warbands
of D&D characters and creatures to throw
against each other. If this concept (which
goes back to D&D’s roots) interests you,
look for the D&D Miniatures Starter Set and
Booster Packs.
 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS novels: Wizards of the
Coast publishes fantasy novels set in 
the worlds of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Some 
of the most popular series include novels
set in the FORGOTTEN REALMS and EBERRON set-
tings and in the young adult PRACTICAL GUIDE
series for younger readers.
 Dragon Magazine and Dungeon Magazine:
Wizards of the Coast publishes two online
magazines dedicated to the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game. Dragon Magazine provides
a player’s perspective on the hobby, offer-
ing loads of new options to add to your
game. Consider it to be an ongoing supple-
ment full of new feats, powers, and magic
items, as well as new player character
races and classes, and tons of roleplaying
and tactical advice to make any player
better at the game. The companion period-
ical, Dungeon Magazine, is the definitive
resource for D&D Dungeon Masters. It fea-
tures DM advice, dungeon lairs, and ready-
to-play adventures that can be dropped into
any D&D campaign. Together, these maga-
zines are required reading for serious D&D
players and DMs everywhere. You can dis-
cover more about these magazines and find
subscription information on the Web at
www.dndinsider.com.
 Computer and console games: You might be
more familiar with DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
through the computer and video games that
have been released over the years. The
computer game industry grew out of the
paper RPGs created by D&D, and today
Atari continues to publish licensed games
set in the worlds of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS.

Character actions boil down to three basic types:
 Attack rolls: A roll to determine whether your character succeeds at
attacking a monster or other opponent. Using a longsword against a
monster, for example, requires an attack roll.
 Skill checks: A roll to determine whether your character uses a skill 
successfully. Using the Athletics skill to climb a wall, for example,
requires a skill check.
 Ability checks: A roll to determine whether your character succeeds at
attempting to do something to which no specific skill really applies.
Attempting to bash open a dungeon door, for example, requires a
Strength ability check.
To determine whether any of these actions are successful, follow these steps:
1. Roll a d20.
2. Add any relevant modifiers.
3. Compare the result to a target number.
If the result equals or exceeds the target number, the action succeeds. 
A result less than the target number indicates that the action fails.
Modifiers are determined by your character’s level, ability scores, and other
factors. You record modifiers on your character sheet for easy reference
when you’re playing. Target numbers, also called the Difficulty Class (DC) for
a particular task or action, come from a variety of places. Some are set by the
action itself and are defined in the rules, and other times the target numbers
are determined by the Dungeon Master. For more details on modifiers and
target numbers, see Chapter 7.
Joining a D&D Game
The best way to learn how to play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is to jump right in. If
you know other players who have a regular game, this book provides you
with everything you need to join an existing game. The ready-to-play charac-
ters in Chapters 3 through 6 are 1st-level characters, completely built and
outfitted for their first adventure. If you want to join a higher-level game,
Chapter 9 presents one of these characters at greater levels of experience —
specifically, at 4th level and at 8th level — giving you a little more latitude in
where to start.
19
Chapter 1: Preparing for Adventure

If you don’t have an existing game group to join, you’ll have to start your
own. Chapter 9 discusses organizing your own game group.
Whether you join an existing group or start your own, we urge you to get
moving. Every day you wait means one less day of getting in on the fun and
excitement of D&D.

The best place to start
Other than this nifty For Dummies book, where’s
the best place to start learning the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game? Well, we wrote this book to be
a great starting point as well as a perfect com-
panion to the full D&D game. Don’t be afraid to
just start out using the material in this book.
At some point, however, you need to get one of
the D&D games. If you’re brand new to the con-
cept of roleplaying games, we urge you to buy
the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Roleplaying Game
Starter Set. This jam-packed box includes dice,
versatile dungeon tiles, character and monster
tokens, and ready-to-play characters. This For
Dummies book makes a great companion for
learning to play with the Starter Set.
If you have some knowledge and experience
with D&D or games like it, you might be ready to
leap right into the 4th Edition core rulebooks.
This trinity of knowledge comes in the form of
the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s
Guide, and Monster Manual. These volumes are
available at fine hobby game stores and book-
stores, and with this For Dummies book at your
side, you should have no trouble navigating your
way through them. If you go this route, you’ll
need to buy a set of dice, too, because the
books don’t come with them.

Chapter 2
Your First Character
In This Chapter
 Examining the D&D player character
 Playing a character
 Selecting the type of character you want to play
Your interface with the fantastic adventures of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game is your player character (also called a PC). Like the hero of a novel,
the star of a movie, or the character in a computer game, your player character
(along with the other player characters in your adventuring party, run by other
players) is at the center of all the action. Unlike the heroes of novels, movies,
or even computer games, however, a D&D player character has no script to
follow. You determine the course of every adventure through the actions you
have your character take — and the only limit is your own imagination.
In this chapter, we examine the basics of what makes a D&D player character
tick. From game statistics to race and class powers, this chapter provides an
overview so that you can get a handle on the character you’re going to play.
This is all in preparation for selecting one of the ready-to-play characters pre-
sented in Chapters 3 through 6. In those chapters, we’ve done the work of
creating characters so that you can spend time getting familiar with all the
game concepts.
In Part II of this book, we walk you through the process of character creation
using the Player’s Handbook so that you can make your very own player char-
acter from scratch.
Defining Your Character
A DUNGEONS & DRAGONS player character lives in a world much like ours was in
medieval times, when knights rode forth on charging warhorses and castles
dotted the land. Now imagine this place, where magic really works and drag-
ons and monsters roam in the dark beyond the firelight. Your character might

be a strong fighter or a nimble rogue, a wise cleric or a mysterious wizard.
Every day, your character explores the unknown places of the world, seeking
monsters to slay and treasure to win. Every adventure that your character
survives makes him or her a little more powerful, a little more famous, and a
little richer.
D&D is a game, and so you need some way to express and describe your
character in the context of the game world. Your fighter, for example, might
be “extremely strong but not too bright,” and those characteristics need to
be translated into game terms. The following sections provide an overview of
the things you find on your character sheet, a record of your character’s game
statistics.
Name
Every great character has a great name. You may have a name all picked out
from the moment you conceive your character, or you may figure it out after
you’ve determined all your character’s game statistics. Great names are
evocative. They fit the mood of the story and world in which the character
adventures. John Savage is a great name for a character in a spy thriller set in
the modern world, but it doesn’t work so well for a character in a D&D fan-
tasy world.
The characters presented for your use in Chapters 3 through 6 in this book
have names already assigned to them. Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook
also lists sample names based on race. Those are good places to start when
you decide to create your own character from scratch (which we discuss in
Part II in this book).
Race
In the fantasy world of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, humans aren’t the only intelligent
race walking around. Other intelligent races share their adventures, and your
character can belong to any of these. To start, we present a few of the possi-
ble races you can choose from. The D&D Player’s Handbook has additional
races that make great player characters.
These races are drawn from myth and legend, and they’re similar to the imag-
inary races that populate many popular fantasy worlds. For D&D, the races
we begin with are humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. You can find more
detailed information on these character races in Chapter 12. Here’s a quick
rundown on the benefits of each:
22
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

 Humans: These are people just like you and us. They’re adaptable, flexi-
ble, and extremely ambitious. Compared with the other races, humans
are relatively short-lived. In game terms, humans get a +2 adjustment to
one ability score, a bonus at-will power, a bonus feat, a bonus skill, and a
+1 bonus to their Fortitude, Reflex, and Will defenses to reflect their nat-
ural tendencies.
 Dwarves: The members of this race are hearty and steadfast, standing
about four-and-a-half-feet tall and powerfully built and extremely broad.
They have a strong connection to mountains and rocky places. They can
live to be more than 200 years old. In game terms, dwarves receive a +2
to Constitution and a +2 to Wisdom (see the “Ability scores” section,
later in this chapter). They also receive a bonus to saves against poison;
they can use their Second Wind (a self-heal) as a minor action (other
characters need to use a standard action); and they are resistant to pull-
push-slide effects, moving 1 square less than the effect calls for. Dwarves
can also see in low-light conditions.
 Elves: Elves have a strong connection to the natural world, especially
woodlands. They can live to be more than 200 years old. They are quick
and quiet, slender and athletic. They stand about as tall as humans, with
long, pointed ears, and vibrant eyes. Elves receive a +2 to Dexterity and
a +2 to Wisdom (see the “Ability scores” section). Elves have low-light
vision, a speed of 7, and a racial bonus on Nature and Perception checks
(see the “Skills” section, later in this chapter). They provide their allies
with a bonus to Perception checks, can ignore difficult terrain when they
shift over squares, and have a racial power that allows them to reroll an
attack roll once per encounter.
 Halflings: The members of this race are clever and capable — much
more so than their small size might indicate. Standing about four feet
tall, with slim, muscular builds, halflings are athletic and outgoing.
Curious to a fault and usually with the daring to match, halflings love to
explore. Halflings receive a +2 Dexterity and a +2 Charisma. They also
receive bonuses to Acrobatics and Thievery checks (see the “Skills” sec-
tion), as well as a bonus to saving throws against fear effects. They
receive a bonus to AC against opportunity attacks, and they can use a
racial power to force an enemy to reroll an attack against them once per
encounter.
Class
In addition to your character’s name and race, your character is most easily
identified by his or her class. A class is kind of like a profession or vocation. It
determines what role the character plays in the adventuring party. For exam-
ple, your character might be Regdar, the human fighter. In this book, we pre-
sent four of the most popular D&D classes for your use. You can find more
classes in the 4th Edition D&D Player’s Handbook.
23
Chapter 2: Your First Character

The four basic classes are fighter, rogue, wizard, and cleric. You can find more
detailed information on the character classes in Chapter 11. Here’s a quick
overview of each class:
 Fighters: These characters are warriors with exceptional combat capa-
bilities and weapon skills. Nobody kills monsters and stands at the front
of an adventuring party as well as the fighter.
 Rogues: Members of this class rely on tricks, cunning, and stealth to get
through a dungeon and save the day. Rogues are great at getting past
locked doors, scouting, spying, and attacking from the shadows.
 Wizards: These are spellcasters, calling on powerful magic spells to fight
monsters and protect their teammates. Wizards need to stay out of
direct combat, but the power they bring to the adventure makes them
worthy members of any party.
 Clerics: These characters focus the might of divine magic to cast healing
and protective spells. A good second-line warrior as well, a cleric might
be one of the most versatile members of an adventuring party.
Each class fills a particular role in the party. For more details, see the “Roles”
section later in this chapter.
Level and XP
Level is a description of your character’s relative degree of power. A 10th-
level character, for example, is more powerful and able to take on tougher
challenges than a 5th-level character. With each new level your character
attains, he or she becomes more powerful and capable. Your character
begins play at 1st level.
Experience points (XP) are the numerical measure of your character’s per-
sonal achievements. Your character earns experience points by defeating
opponents and overcoming challenges. When your character’s XP total
reaches various milestones, he or she gains new levels. At 0 XP, for example,
your character is 1st level. At 1,000 XP, your character attains 2nd level. More
information on XP and levels can be found in Chapter 18.
Ability scores
The primary expression of your character in game terms starts with his or 
her ability scores. Every D&D character is defined by six abilities: Strength,
Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. (See Chapter 13
for more information about ability scores.) Each ability gets a score, a number
that determines how good your character will be at different tasks in the game.
24
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

The average score for everyday people in a D&D world is 10 or 11. Player
characters are heroes, and so they have better ability scores than everyday
folk. The average ability score for a player character is 12 or 13.
During character creation, you can assign numbers between 3 (a terrible
score) and 18 (an excellent score) or higher. The characters presented for
your use in Chapters 3 through 6 already have their ability scores and other
statistics figured out, so you can start playing immediately.
Special abilities
If it hasn’t been made clear yet, your player character is special. He or she
stands above the normal people and becomes a hero in the world. As such,
your character has special abilities. These might be based on your charac-
ter’s class or race or tied to certain feats you have selected.
For example, Regdar the fighter has the spinning sweep attack power. This
provides him with a special encounter power that deals damage and knocks
an enemy off its feet. Another example is Kathra the wizard’s cloud of daggers
at-will spell.
Key statistics
Your character has a number of key statistics that you’ll refer to over and
over throughout the course of play. These appear right at the top of the
ready-to-play character sheets presented in Chapters 3 through 6. You can
find more details on how to use these statistics in Chapter 7. Here’s a quick
rundown on the statistics:
 Initiative modifier: This modifier is used to determine who goes first in
a combat round.
 Speed: This value shows how far your character can move (measured in
squares) in a round.
 Attack modifiers and damage: These numbers are associated with your
character’s weapons of choice and powers. They show what you must
roll to successfully attack opponents and how much damage your char-
acter does if the attack succeeds.
 Defenses: These values show what opponents need to roll to hit your
character during combat. The four defenses are Armor Class (AC),
Fortitude, Reflex, and Will.
25
Chapter 2: Your First Character

 Hit points (or hp): This number defines how much damage your charac-
ter can withstand in combat. When your character runs out of hit points,
he or she is knocked unconscious — and may even be killed if he or she
sustains more damage. Other important numbers derived from your
character’s hit points are his or her bloodied value (half of his or her
total hit points) and healing surge value (one-quarter of your character’s
total hit points). The number of healing surges per day shows how many
times you can restore hit points during a given day of adventuring.
Feats
Feats provide special bonuses or capabilities for your character, usually
improving powers your character already has. The ready-to-play characters
in Chapters 3 through 6 have already had feats selected for them. For more
information about selecting your own feats, see Chapter 15.
Skills
Skills represent the training and education your character has beyond the
combat and powers inherent to his or her class. Depending on your charac-
ter’s class, your character will have a greater or lesser number of skills to call
upon. Rogues, for example, begin play trained in the use of six skills. Fighters,
on the other hand, just don’t go in much for studying and so start out with
only three trained skills.
Skills have already been selected for the ready-to-play characters presented
in Chapters 3 through 6. You can find additional information on skills in
Chapter 16.
Gear
Every D&D player character must be well prepared for adventuring life. This
is reflected not only in the class, skills, and feats the character has, but in the
gear the character carries — the weapons, armor, rations, sleeping rolls,
rope, torches, flint and steel, and the backpack to carry it all in. No adven-
turer goes naked into a dungeon!
Equipment has already been selected for the ready-to-play characters pre-
sented in Chapters 3 through 6. You can find additional information on adven-
turing gear in Chapter 17.
26
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Powers
All player characters have powers. Powers are defined as either attack
powers or utility powers. Some powers can be used all the time (at-will
powers). Others are more powerful and have limits (encounter powers and
daily powers). Powers are based on a character’s class and the power source
associated with it.
Fighters and rogues, for example, are martial characters. Their powers are
called exploits. These come from the training and experience these charac-
ters have endured, and they can sometimes appear almost magical in nature
to the less-initiated.
Clerics are divine characters. Their powers are called prayers.
Wizards are arcane characters. Their powers are called spells.
Powers have already been selected for the ready-to-play characters pre-
sented in Chapters 3 through 6. You can find additional information on
powers in Chapter 14.
Playing Your Character
As stated earlier in this chapter, the way you interface with the D&D world is
through your player character. Your character acts as your eyes and ears in
the fantasy world, as well as your hands and feet. You can interact with the
world your Dungeon Master presents in any way you want through your char-
acter. The only limit is your imagination — and sometimes how well you roll
the dice. The following sections tell you how to get the most out of your
player character.
Taking turns
When you’re caught up in a game, it’s easy to care only about whose turn it is
during combat and other dramatic situations (such as when dealing with a
trap or obstacle). Try not to forget that other people are playing the game
with you. When you really get into your character and the fantasy, you might
have a tendency to hog all the DM’s attention. Resist that urge! Let every
player have a turn talking to the DM, asking questions, or describing what his
or her character tries to do. It’s only fair, and it makes the game work much
better. Besides, much of the fun is in seeing what the other players are think-
ing and how they’re reacting to their characters’ actions.
27
Chapter 2: Your First Character

During combat situations, everyone makes an initiative roll to determine the
order of play. We cover initiative and game play in greater detail in Chapter 7.
Roleplaying
D&D is a roleplaying game. That means that your character is much more
than just a collection of game statistics (though those have their place). Take
those game statistics and build a personality for your character. Remember
that your character is a hero and is part of a team, but otherwise let your
imagination be your guide. The quirks and mannerisms you bring to the role
are what set your character apart.
D&D is a game. Have fun with it. You don’t have to use funny voices or
accents or anything like that. Just determine how your character would act in
any given situation and remain true to the character as the adventure
unfolds. Soon, your character will develop a personality all his or her own,
and the game, in turn, will take on a fantastic life that makes each session fun
to play.
28
Part I: D&D Crash Course 
Players are not characters
Always keep in mind that you and your charac-
ter are two different people. You have knowl-
edge as a player that your character doesn’t
have. Your character shouldn’t know what die
rolls have been made or other things that don’t
make up his or her “character knowledge.”
Characters never talk about Armor Class or hit
points or ability scores. They can discuss the
quality of their armor, their general health, and
their comparative strengths and weaknesses,
but never the game mechanics behind those
things.
Be sure to let the DM and the other players
know when you’re speaking as your character
or as yourself, if there’s any confusion. When
you remember the difference between you the
player and your character, everyone can have
more fun roleplaying.
A good Dungeon Master may say during the
game “You don’t know that” or “You wouldn’t
think of that,” meaning that you’re confusing
player knowledge with character knowledge.
Good players learn to avoid this type of problem
by keeping the two separate.
Players don’t swing swords, cast spells, disarm
traps, or die fighting monsters. Characters, on
the other hand, do all this and more over the
course of a typical adventure.

Your imagination is the limit
In addition to attacking, casting spells, and using skills, characters can do all
sorts of things. The only limit to what a character can do is the player’s imag-
ination and the rulings of the Dungeon Master. Depending on the situation,
your character might bash apart a cabinet to find a secret compartment,
make a rope out of bed sheets, or try to build a trap out of spare parts in an
evil wizard’s workshop. The DM decides whether an idea works or not, some-
times calling for die rolls to help determine the outcome.
Character Roles
Think of the adventuring party as you would a sports team. Every member of
the team fills a position and performs a role. These roles aren’t designed to
restrict your character, but rather help define his or her usual place on the
team. Just as a baseball team needs a pitcher and a catcher, or a basketball
team needs a center and a point guard, so too does a D&D adventuring party
need characters to fill specific roles.
The four roles that define a D&D adventuring party are
 Controller: A controller deals with large numbers of enemies at the
same time, either dishing out damage over a wide area or hindering ene-
mies in some other, less overt way. The wizard fills the role of controller.
 Defender: A defender, as the name implies, has the best defenses in the
game. Defenders usually handle one enemy at a time, using close-combat
offense to form a party’s first line of defense. It’s tough to ignore a
defender when he or she wades into battle. The fighter fills the role of
defender.
 Leader: A leader inspires, heals, and otherwise aids the rest of the
adventuring party. A leader isn’t necessarily the boss of the party, but he
or she motivates and leads by example, making the rest of the party
operate better thanks to the leader’s presence. The cleric fills the role of
leader.
 Striker: A striker deals a lot of damage to one target at a time. Strikers
are highly mobile, with the ability to set up spectacular attacks and get
away before they can take too much punishment in return. The rogue
fills the role of striker.
29
Chapter 2: Your First Character

Choosing Your Character
The earlier sections in this chapter cover the basics. After you have a handle
on the basic stuff, select your own character from those presented over the
next four chapters. There’s no right or wrong way to choose a character. You
might really want to play a specific class and/or race. Of course, you should
read through all the material, but in the end, go with your gut and choose the
character that most appeals to you. Here are some recommendations:
 Fighters: You want to play a fighter if being in the thick of combat
appeals to you. Fighters always have something to do, no matter what
challenge appears before them. Fighters are masters of many weapons,
and have a diverse array of martial powers (called exploits) to choose
from. If you want to play a fighter, turn to Chapter 3 and select one of the
ready-to-play fighters presented therein.
 Rogues: You want to play a rogue if being sneaky and cunning appeals to
you. Rogues have powers (also called exploits) that enhance their mobil-
ity and damage-dealing capability, excel at making sneak attacks, and
master many skills. Rogues are a good choice for people who are new to
the game and the concepts of D&D. If you want to play a rogue, go to
Chapter 4 and take a look at the ready-to-play rogues it has to offer.
 Wizards: You want to play a wizard if using flashy arcane powers (called
spells) appeals to you. Wizards cast spells that deal damage or hinder
the enemy. Wizards are harder to play than fighters or rogues due to the
slight complexity of spellcasting, but the rewards for playing a wizard
well can be very satisfying. If you want to play a wizard, Chapter 5 has
some ready-to-play wizards for you.
 Clerics: You want to play a cleric if spellcasting, up-close combat, and
helping others appeal to you. Clerics have defensive and helpful divine
powers (called prayers) that give the entire party a boost. In addition,
they have the ability to fight alongside fighters when the monsters
charge in fast and furiously. If you want to play a cleric, check out the
ready-to-play clerics presented in Chapter 6.

In This Chapter
 Understanding the fighter class
 Exploring who should play a fighter
 Discovering how to play a fighter
 Meeting three ready-to-play fighters
T
he fighter is the quintessential DUNGEONS & DRAGONS player character. As
the name of the class implies, the fighter has the best all-around fighting
capabilities. A fighter usually has a good Strength score to better use melee
weapons, such as swords and axes. Fighters can use most weapons and most
kinds of armor and shields without penalty. They are trained in close-combat
fighting.
Whether a fighter receives formal training in an army or local militia or is self-
taught but battle tested, he or she stands at the front of any adventuring
party. A fighter provides combat prowess, high hit points, and good defense
to the party. In return, the fighter seeks magical support, healing, and scout-
ing skills from comrades. As part of a team, the fighter is the defender — 
protecting the other party members and wading in to lock down the tough
opponents. In other words, the fighter’s job is to fight.
In this chapter, we provide a bit of advice on who might want to play a fighter
character and how to play a fighter character if that’s the route you decide to
go. The rest of the chapter features three ready-to-play fighter characters
that you can use to kick-start your adventuring career.
Who Should Play a Fighter?
The fighter is among the easiest, most straightforward classes to play. Anyone
brand new to the concept of D&D and roleplaying might want to start out with
a fighter character. If you think that being in the center of most combat
encounters will appeal to you, or if you like the idea of playing a physically
powerful character, then the fighter is the class for you.

Every adventuring party needs at least one fighter. In a party of four, a solid
fighter is essential to success. In a party of five or six, two fighters really 
provide a lot of durability and make adventuring that much easier.
See Chapter 7 for details on how to read the description for each fighter’s
powers.
How to Play a Fighter
Your character can take any approach to the fighter class. He might be a
questing knight, a king’s champion, or an elite foot soldier. She might be a
mercenary, a raider, or a thug. Some fighters use their expertise for the
greater good, whereas others are interested only in personal gain.
Fighters should be brave and stalwart, gutsy and heroic. Later, you can play
with the baselines and portray any kind of fighter you want, but to start out,
go with the tried-and-true basics. Fighters live for the thrill of combat and the
excitement of adventure. And woe to any evil that happens to cross their
paths!
Have fun with the idea of being a physical powerhouse, a combat expert, and
a master of weapons. That’s the fighter’s portfolio, and you should play it for
all it’s worth. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t play smart, however. If your
fighter blindly rushes into combat and gets killed, the rest of your team will
be in real trouble. Be cautious, but not too cautious. Above all, be a hero.
Fighter builds
Fighters come in two basic builds: the Great Weapon Fighter and the
Guardian Fighter. A Great Weapon Fighter uses two-handed weapons to fight
hard instead of smart. A Guardian Fighter uses a one-handed weapon and a
shield to increase his or her already formidable defenses even more. All fight-
ers want to get up close and personal with the enemy and usually want to
take on the toughest opponent personally. 
The fighter’s role
Just as each player has a position on a sports team, every character has a
role in the adventuring party. For the fighter, that role is defender. As a
defender, it falls to the fighter to form the front line of any battle, to protect
32
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

the more fragile members of the team from excessive harm, to soak up
attacks thanks to a high Armor Class and high hit points, and to contain 
monsters with the combat challenge class feature.
Selecting a Fighter
The rest of this chapter features three ready-to-play 1st-level fighter characters:
 Regdar is Great Weapon Fighter who is a champion of good, pledging his
mighty greatsword to the cause of justice. He adventures to put down
evil and to gain skill and experience that he can use in his ongoing cru-
sade. Regdar’s job on an adventuring team is defender, killing the mon-
sters and protecting his teammates by forming the front line in battle.
 Tordek is a Guardian Fighter who quests to prove himself to his warclan.
He refuses to return to his dwarven homeland until he has made a name
for himself that his clan can be proud of. He believes the best way to
accomplish this is through battle and adventuring. Tordek uses a
warhammer and shield in combat. Tordek’s job on an adventuring team
is defender, killing the monsters and protecting his teammates by form-
ing the front line in battle.
 Calia is a Guardian Fighter who has taken to the life of adventuring to
satisfy her wanderlust. She believes in setting her own pace and wander-
ing freely from dungeon to dungeon in search of adventure and glory.
Calia never goes into a battle without her trusty longsword and shield at
the ready. Calia’s job on an adventuring team is defender, killing the
monsters and protecting her teammates by forming the front line in
battle.
Any one of these characters makes a great fighter and a worthy member of
any adventuring party. Pick the one that most appeals to you and then turn
to Chapter 7 for a quick overview of game play.

Starting Out as a Rogue
In This Chapter
 Understanding the rogue class
 Exploring who should play a rogue
 Discovering how to play a rogue
 Meeting three ready-to-play rogues
T
he rogue has been part of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game experience from
the beginning. In the early days, this class was called the thief, but as
player characters, rogues can and should be so much more than that title
implies. A rogue is an expert in the use of all kinds of skills, excelling at sneak-
ing around, scouting, and disarming traps. A rogue needs a high Dexterity
score to improve his or her success with many of the class’s primary skills,
as well as to bolster his or her Armor Class and ranged attacks.
In this chapter, we provide a bit of advice on who might want to play a rogue
character and how to play a rogue character. The rest of the chapter features
three ready-to-play rogue characters that you can use to kick-start your
adventuring career.
Who Should Play a Rogue?
The rogue isn’t as dedicated to a single mode of play as the fighter, but this
class makes a good starting point for new players who aren’t afraid of making
a few decisions during the game. If you like to solve puzzles or want to play a
character that is equal parts skillful, cunning, and stealthy while dealing tons
of damage, then the rogue is the class for you.
Every adventuring party needs one rogue. In a party of four, a skillful rogue is
essential to success. In a larger party, a single rogue still provides the abilities
to avoid or overcome traps and hazardous obstacles. More than one rogue
might be overkill, and you could be sacrificing other skill sets that the party
might desperately need.

See Chapter 7 for details on how to read the description for each rogue’s
powers.
How to Play a Rogue
The rogue has a number of skills and abilities that make him or her an essen-
tial part of any adventuring team. Stealth and cunning are the rogue’s tools of
trade, so if you play a rogue, you have to be ready for anything. One of the
rogue’s functions is to deal lots of damage to a single opponent with his or
her sneak attack. In addition, the rogue scouts for party, uses skills to deal
with traps and locked doors, and usually has enough other skills to be a jack-
of-all-trades. Rogues wear cloth and leather armor, and they use daggers,
hand crossbows, shuriken, slings, and short swords. A rogue’s relatively low
hit points and Armor Class means he or she needs to choose opponents care-
fully in melee combat.
Your character can take any approach to the rogue class. He might be a
stealthy thief, a silver-tongued trickster, or an elite scout. She might be a spy,
a thug, or a diplomat. All rogues are versatile, adaptable, and resourceful.
Later, you can play with the baselines and portray any kind of rogue you
want; but to start out, go with the tried-and-true basics. You live for the thrill
of adventure. You seek challenges to overcome, and you just have to open
that locked door to see what’s waiting on the other side. And if you can pick
up some gold along the way, so much the better!
Have fun with the idea of being a skilled expert who’s dexterous and stealthy.
Use your skills and abilities often, and the rewards will come to you.
Although all rogues have a little bit (or a lot) of thief in them, the code of the
adventuring party urges you not to steal from your teammates. Be curious
and a little reckless, but not too reckless. Above all, be a hero.
Rogue builds
Rogues come in two basic builds: The Brawny Rogue and the Trickster
Rogue. Brawny Rogues prefer powers that deal a huge amount of damage.
Dexterity and Strength are the Brawny Rogue’s most important abilities.
Trickster Rogues favor powers that deceive and misdirect their foes.
Dexterity and Charisma are their most important abilities.

Part I: D&D Crash Course 

The rogue’s role
Just as every player has a position on a sports team, every character has a
role in the adventuring party. For the rogue, that role is striker. As a striker, it
falls to the rogue to provide the offense in most battles, darting in to deal
massive damage to one opponent at a time. In addition, the rogue has skills
and class features that make him or her invaluable for exploring a dungeon
and dealing with all kinds of skill challenges.
Selecting a Rogue
The rest of this chapter features three ready-to-play rogue characters:
 Jax is a Trickster Rogue who is a good-hearted and has a thirst for
adventure. He sees every quest as a challenge to do his best and help
his companions — and if he earns some gold along the way, so much the
better. Jax’s weapon of choice is the short sword, and the blade sings in
his skilled hands. Jax’s job on an adventuring team is striker, dealing
massive damage and handling locked doors and traps.
 Shadow is a Brawny Rogue who slips through every adventure with
quiet determination and impressive skill. She wants to overcome every
challenge and is fond of treasure. She is a gifted athlete, highly skilled in
climbing and jumping, and she uses this to the benefit of herself and her
team. Shadow’s job on an adventuring team is striker, dealing massive
damage and handling locked doors and traps.
 Lidda is a Trickster Rogue, and like all halflings, she stands about half as
tall as a human. She’s sneaky, curious, and extremely fond of shiny
objects. Her career as a rogue began when she left her home to wander
in search of adventure. Lidda’s job on an adventuring team is striker,
dealing massive damage and handling locked doors and traps.
Any of these characters make a great rogue and a worthy member of any
adventuring party. Pick the one that most appeals to you and then turn to
Chapter 7 for a quick overview of game play.

T
he wizard is an arcane spellcaster who uses magic for attack, defense,
and a myriad of other uses. A wizard approaches magic as a science,
using training and study to cast spells. A wizard requires a good Intelligence
score because this ability determines how powerful the wizard can ultimately
become. Good Wisdom and Dexterity scores also help the wizard cast spells
when trouble appears.
Wizards adventure to improve their abilities, to discover hidden knowledge
and new sources of information. A wizard’s role in an adventuring party is
controller, damaging large groups of enemies at the same time while exerting
control over the battlefield. As part of a team, the wizard uses his or her
spells on behalf of the party, all the while seeking to master arcane magic and
learn new spells.
See Chapter 7 for details on how to read the description for each wizard’s
powers.
Who Should Play a Wizard?
Spellcasting can be tricky, but every party needs a spellcaster, and the
rewards for playing one can be high. If you want to play a character with a
mysterious nature and a selection of powerful spells at the ready, then the
wizard is the class for you.

Every adventuring party should have a wizard for the magical might the class
provides. An arcane spellcaster has access to magical spells that can comple-
ment or enhance the natural abilities of nonspellcasters such as fighters and
rogues. In a party of five, the wizard’s offensive magic can be every bit as
important as the fighter’s greatsword or a rogue’s sneak attack.
How to Play a Wizard
The wizard is not a melee combatant. When a battle breaks out, the wizard
wants to be at a distance, casting spells from down range. A wizard can’t
stand up to a lot of physical damage and so must rely on other team mem-
bers to provide defense. What the wizard has is a selection of spells that he
or she can cast over the course of a battle. A wizard with damage-dealing
spells can become a primary source of a party’s offensive punch. A wizard
with more control-based spells, on the other hand, warps the battlefield with
amazing effects.
Wizards are proficient only with daggers and quarterstaffs. They lack training
in the use of armor, so wizards usually avoid anything heavier than cloth
armor.
Your character can take any approach to the wizard class. Most wizards
believe that their power comes from the arcane forces that flow through the
world, power they unlock through extensive study, hidden knowledge, and
intricate preparation. Through arcane magic, wizards seek to control the
world around them.
Wizards should be confident and a little mysterious. They are highly knowl-
edgeable about many arcane matters and strong-willed. As a wizard, you
adventure to test the limits of your power — and by testing them, to surpass
them.
Have fun playing an enigmatic, mysterious spellcaster. Cast powerful spells at
opportune times to help your party and then stand back and use your at-will
spells to supplement the offensive melee capabilities of the fighter and rogue.
Test yourself and your team often, for in the test is perfection. Above all, be a
hero.
Wizard builds
Wizards come in two basic builds: the Control Wizard and the War Wizard.
Control Wizards like powers that restrict enemies with effects such as poiso-
nous gas clouds and encasing ice. Intelligence and Wisdom are the Control
52
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Wizard’s most important abilities. War Wizards choose powers that dish out
lots of damage by gouts of fire or bursts of lightning. Intelligence and
Dexterity are their most important abilities.
The wizard’s role
Just as every player has a position on a sports team, every character has a
role in the adventuring party. For the wizard, that role is controller. As a con-
troller, the wizard uses spells to attack multiple enemies at the same time
while exerting arcane control over the battlefield. As a Control Wizard, you
turn the landscape against your enemies or render them unable to fight effec-
tively for a short time. As a War Wizard, you delight in powers that deal lots
of damage. Either way, when you step into a battle, you control every aspect
of the fight.
Selecting a Wizard
The rest of this chapter features three ready-to-play wizard characters:
 Beryn is a Control Wizard who studied in the great towers of arcane
knowledge before striking out to become an adventurer. Beryn’s job on
an adventuring team is controller, standing back to restrict enemies and
deal damage to hostile areas when the need arises.
 Dreggu is a War Wizard who learned the arcane arts of battle as a stu-
dent to a powerful and ancient mage. Dreggu’s job on an adventuring
team is controller, standing back to restrict enemies and deal damage to
hostile areas when the need arises.
 Telsa is a wizard who combines offense with a strong defense. She
learned her skills by studying with the eladrin arcane masters of the
Feywild. Telsa’s job on an adventuring team is controller, standing back
to restrict enemies and deal damage to hostile areas when the need
arises. Her powers favor the War Wizard build.
Any of these characters makes a great wizard and a worthy member of any
adventuring party. Pick the one that most appeals to you and then turn to
Chapter 7 for a quick overview of game play.

Chapter 6
Starting Out as a Cleric
In This Chapter
 Understanding the cleric class
 Exploring who should play a cleric
 Discovering how to play a cleric
 Meeting three ready-to-play clerics
N
o fantasy world is complete without a pantheon of mythical gods to add
flavor, color, and background to the setting. And no DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
adventuring party is complete without a servant of the gods — the cleric. 
A cleric uses divine magic and decent combat abilities to aid a party. A cleric
needs a good Wisdom score to bolster his or her divine spells. A good
Strength score improves a cleric’s melee attack ability so he or she can wade
into battle when called upon, and a good Charisma score improves the class’s
powers (called prayers).
An adventuring cleric devotes his or her life to a god’s service from a young
age. A cleric wields divine magic to aid the party, using prayers that provide
healing, offense, and defense to best advantage. Having decent combat skills,
the cleric provides melee support and often wades in to stand beside the
fighter in battle. The cleric’s job is to defend and heal with spells and to fight
when battle rages.
Who Should Play a Cleric?
The cleric can be somewhat complex to play due to the class’s proficiency in
both combat and divine magic. However, this combination makes the cleric
not only necessary for any adventuring team, but a lot of fun to play, too. If
you think that playing a supporting role, helping your teammates, and occa-
sionally mixing it up in battle sounds like the kind of character you want to
play, then the cleric is the class for you.

Every adventuring party needs at least one cleric. In a party of four, a cleric is
essential to success. In a party of five or six, two clerics can provide a lot of
healing and defense, making adventuring easier.
See Chapter 7 for details on how to read the description for each cleric’s
powers.
How to Play a Cleric
In an adventuring party, the cleric is everybody’s friend. Through the use of
divine magic, a cleric can make a fighter stronger or a rogue quicker for a
short period of time, for example, and everyone can benefit from a timely
healing spell in the middle of a grueling battle.
Clerics can use cloth, leather, hide, or chainmail armor, and they can use
simple melee and ranged weapons without penalty. To use weapons that fall
into other categories without penalty, such as longswords and warhammers,
a cleric needs to select the appropriate feat.
Clerics adventure to support the causes of their gods, to help those in need,
and to work to improve the reputation of their deities and temples. You can
find descriptions of mythical deities for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game begin-
ning on page 21 of the Player’s Handbook. In addition to following their faith,
clerics might have any common motivation for adventuring as well. Clerics
can seek fame, treasure, and power, just like any other class.
Clerics should be brave and helpful, faithful and heroic. Later, you can play
with the baselines and portray any kind of cleric you want, but to start out,
go with the tried-and-true basics. You live to help others and serve your god.
You hate evil in all its forms, and you have a special loathing for the undead.
Have fun with the idea of being the one that the rest of the party counts on
for healing and defense. Don’t be afraid to pick up your mace, but melee
should take second place to providing divine support for the team. Be
devoted to your cause and your teammates. Above all, be a hero.
Cleric builds
Clerics come in two basic builds: The Battle Cleric and the Devoted Cleric.
Battle Clerics like to mix it up in melee combat and favor powers that smite
their enemies. Strength and Wisdom are the Battle Cleric’s most important
abilities. Devoted Clerics favor powers that aid the party by healing and pro-
viding bonuses. Wisdom and Charisma are their most important abilities.
62
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

The cleric’s role
Just as the positions on a sports team, every character has a role in the
adventuring party. For the cleric, that role is leader. As a leader, you should
be shielding your allies with your prayers, healing hurt friends, and using
prayers that bolster your allies’ attacks. By leader, we don’t necessarily mean
that you’re the boss — but you do motivate, encourage, and inspire your
teammates to greatness.
Selecting a Cleric
The rest of this chapter features three ready-to-play cleric characters, all of
which combine healing and defensive magic with good combat skills:
 Thomm is a cleric of Bahamut, the god of justice, honor, and protection.
His training included the healing arts, battle prayers, and melee combat.
He adventures to defeat evil and to promote the tenets of his faith.
Thomm’s job on an adventuring team is leader, inspiring his teammates
and bolstering them with prayers during battle. He uses the Battle Cleric
character build.
 Chenna is a cleric of Melora, the god of wilderness and the sea. Her
training included the healing arts, healing prayers, and inspiring leader-
ship. She adventures to defeat evil and to promote the tenets of her
faith. Chenna’s job on an adventuring team is leader, inspiring her team-
mates and bolstering them with prayers during battle. Chenna uses the
Devoted Cleric build.
 Eberk is a cleric of Moradin, the god of creation and artisans, and spe-
cial patron to the dwarves. His training included the healing arts, battle
prayers, and inspiring leadership. He adventures to defeat evil and to
promote the tenets of his faith. Eberk’s job on an adventuring team is
leader, inspiring his teammates and bolstering them with prayers during
battle. Eberk favors the Battle Cleric build.
Any of these characters makes a great cleric and a worthy member of any
adventuring party. Pick the one that most appeals to you and then turn to
Chapter 7 for a quick overview of game play.

A
lthough the heart of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is imagination and
adventure and your character can attempt to do anything you can think
of, the best way to learn how to apply the game mechanics is by examining
D&D combat. So in this chapter, we show you how to play the game from the
perspective of beating up the monsters — which happens in almost every
D&D adventure.
Refer to one of the ready-to-play character sheets from Chapters 3 through 6
when reading this chapter.
Understanding the D&D Game
Every DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is an adventure. From an epic quest to a
humble dungeon crawl, an adventure breaks down into three basic types of
encounters: 
 Social encounters: These encounters present players with situations in
which they can roleplay their characters and interact with each other
and with those characters controlled by the Dungeon Master (known as
nonplayer characters, or NPCs). Trading, negotiating, or simply talking to
locals are among the types of social encounters you may participate in.
You’ll often employ skills like Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate during

these encounters, but sometimes no dice rolls are necessary at all.
Social encounters can lead to challenge or combat encounters, or they
can be self-contained discussions between characters. Some social
encounters (also called noncombat encounters) involve skill challenges
(see the later section, “Facing Skill Challenges”).
 Challenge encounters: Encounters of this type revolve around charac-
ters struggling against natural or man-made hazards, such as trying to
cross a lake of fire or dealing with a poison-needle trap on a locked
chest. These encounters require skill checks or ability checks to navi-
gate. Often, challenge encounters (also called noncombat encounters)
involve skill challenges (see the “Facing Skill Challenges” section, later in
this chapter).
 Combat encounters: These encounters make up the heart of many D&D
adventures. When no other option presents itself for dealing with mon-
sters or other opponents (such as brigands, thugs, raiders, or pirates),
the D&D character hefts sword, staff, or axe and wades into battle.
Combat encounters are the most rigidly structured times in the game,
where most of the core rules come into play. When most people talk
about playing D&D, this is the part of the game they envision. We show
you how to play the game using the combat encounter structure
throughout the rest of this chapter.
Rolling Dice
To provide tension, suspense, and an element of luck, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game uses dice to determine the outcome of actions where failure has a con-
sequence. Fighting a monster, picking a lock, disarming a trap, leaping over a
pit of molten lava — the game provides a method for determining success or
failure based on a character’s skills and abilities and adding a touch of luck
for drama and excitement. Rolling dice is fun, and D&D allows for plenty of
dice-rolling action in every adventure.
Remember the Core Game Mechanic: Whenever your character attempts an
action that has a chance of failure associated with it, roll a twenty-sided die
(d20). The higher the roll, the better the chance of success.
These character actions boil down to attack rolls, skill checks, and ability
checks. To determine whether any of these actions are successful, follow
these steps:
1. Roll a d20.
2. Add any relevant modifiers.
3. Compare the result to a target number.
72
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

If the result equals or exceeds the target number, the action succeeds. 
A result of less than the target number indicates that the action fails. For any
task or action, target numbers, also called the Difficulty Class (or DC), come
from a variety of places. Some are set by the action itself and are defined in
the rules, and others are determined by the Dungeon Master. An opponent’s
Armor Class or Reflex defense, for example, is the target number you need to
equal or exceed to make a successful attack.
Exploring the Dungeon
Outside of combat, D&D play can be very casual. The Dungeon Master tells
the players what their characters see (and hear, and smell, and so on) and
asks them what they do. Players don’t have to act in any particular order,
though the DM may impose some structure just so everyone gets to do what
they want to do. If you use the battle grid during these casual periods, it’s
probably just to see where the characters are in relation to each other. Here’s
an example of dungeon exploration:
Dungeon Master: “The 10-foot-wide corridor you’ve been following ends
in a locked wooden door. What do you want to do?”
Lidda’s player: “I try to unlock the door.”
Dungeon Master: “Okay. Make a Thievery check.”
Lidda’s player: Rolls a d20 and adds 8 (her Thievery modifier) to the
result. “I got an 18.”
Dungeon Master: “The lock clicks open.”
Regdar’s player: “Now that the door is unlocked, I step past Lidda and
open the door.”
Dungeon Master: “The doors swings open with a slight creak. Inside, you
see a small gold statue sitting atop a waist-high pedestal in the center of
the room.”
Lidda’s player: “I walk up and take a look.”
Telsa’s player: “So do I.”
Eberk’s player: “I’ll stand in the doorway in case something goes wrong.”
Regdar’s player: “Lidda’s always getting into trouble. I’ll step into the
room but stand back, ready to move if Lidda and Telsa set off a trap.”
Dungeon Master: “Okay. Telsa and Lidda look at the statue. It appears to
be made of gold. It seems heavy, even if it isn’t more than a foot and a half
tall. It’s carved in the shape of a dragon, and there is some kind of writing
near the base that you can’t read.”
73
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

Telsa’s player: “I want to see if I know anything about this.”
Dungeon Master: “Okay. Make an Arcana check. Everyone else make a
Perception check.”
Telsa’s player: Rolls a d20 and adds 8 (her Arcana modifier) to the result.
“That’s a 12.”
All other players: All of the other players roll d20s and add their Perception
skill modifiers. Regdar’s player lucks out and gets the highest result, an 18.
Dungeon Master: “While the rest of you stare at the golden statue,
Regdar notices that a panel in the far wall has swung aside. Beyond,
Regdar sees a dark opening. Something has begun to emerge from that
opening, but only Regdar sees it. What are you going to do?”
What happens next? That depends on the Dungeon Master and the actions of
the players!
What can you do while exploring?
While exploring a dungeon or other adventure location, characters can do
any of the following actions:
 Search the walls for secret doors.
 Listen at doors.
 Check doors to see if they’re locked.
 Force open or unlock a door.
 Search rooms for treasure.
 Manipulate levers or push statues.
 Use the Intimidate skill to frighten a kobold, for example, into telling the
party what waits around the bend.
 Do anything else you can think of!
Characters can do all sorts of things as they explore an adventure location.
They might break apart a cabinet to locate a secret compartment, gather
sand into a pouch, try to build a makeshift bridge out of a table, or do 
whatever else the players can imagine.
The Dungeon Master decides whether or not something the characters try
actually works. Some things are easy and characters can succeed automati-
cally. It doesn’t take any special skill or luck to fill a pouch with sand, for
example.
74
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Some actions are impossible. No character can smash through a 12-inch
thick, solid stone wall by hitting it with his or her fist.
When there’s a possibility of either success or failure, and the task doesn’t
relate to any particular skill, the DM calls for an ability check.
Ability checks
To make an ability check, a player rolls a d20 and adds his or her character’s
bonus associated with the ability that best fits the action. If the DM decides
that the result is high enough, using the sample DCs provided in the D&D
rulebooks as a guide, the character succeeds. Here are some examples of
ability checks and the DCs required to succeed:
 Trying to break down a strong wooden door requires a DC 20 Strength
check.
 Attempting to thread a needle requires a DC 5 Dexterity check.
 Holding your breath for a long time requires a DC 10 Constitution check.
 Navigating a challenging maze requires a DC 20 Intelligence check.
 Recognizing the NPC rogue who was following your character at the
market requires a DC 10 Wisdom check.
 Making sure your character gets noticed in a crowd requires a DC 15
Charisma check.
Combat Basics
As characters adventure into mysterious forests or dark dungeons, they often
encounter monsters of all shapes and sizes. In the inevitable battles that
ensue, you use dice and your character’s statistics to determine the course of
combat. Players roll dice for their characters. The Dungeon Master rolls dice
for the monsters (or whatever opponents the player characters are facing).
In a combat encounter, you put miniature figures for each character and mon-
ster on a battle grid. Players take turns in order, one after the other, moving
their figures on the battle grid to show where their characters are moving in
the battle, placing the figures next to or within sight of the monsters that
their characters are attacking. (See Chapter 8 for more about using the battle
grid.) You roll a die to see if an attack hits. If it hits, you roll dice to determine
how much damage the attack deals. 
75
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

Determining who goes first
Every character and monster has an initiative modifier. This is a bonus or
penalty added to a d20 roll called an initiative check. Everyone makes an 
initiative check at the start of a combat encounter. This sets the order of play
for the entire encounter, as follows:
1. Players make initiative checks for their characters by making a d20
roll and adding initiative modifiers.
2. The Dungeon Master makes an initiative check for the monsters, one
roll for each type of opponent.
For example, if an encounter features two bugbear warriors and three
goblin slingers, the DM makes one initiative check for the bugbears and
one initiative check for the goblins.
3. The DM notes all the results on a piece of paper to establish an initia-
tive order, from highest result to lowest result.
4. The character or creature with the highest initiative result goes first
and takes a turn, followed by the next highest result, and so on.
5. When everyone has had a turn, the round ends. 
The second round uses the same order, starting with the character with
the highest initiative result. Continue until the battle ends.
The DM’s initiative log for a combat encounter might look like this:
Lidda 
25
Goblin slingers
21
Telsa
17
Regdar
10
Bugbear warriors
7
Eberk
4
This indicates the order in which each character and monster will act in each
round of the encounter. Notice that the DM makes one roll for all monsters of
the same type in the encounter.
Taking your turn
Your turn has three parts:

Part I: D&D Crash Course 

 The start of your turn: Before you can perform any actions, you have to
keep track of certain effects that may or may not be applied to your
character. These include ongoing damage and effects that end on the
start of your turn. 
Ongoing damage of the same type isn’t added together; only the higher
number applies. 
 Actions on your turn: You perform actions on your turn to help your-
self, help your allies, or harm the monsters. These actions are described
in the next section.
 The end of your turn: After you complete your actions, you have to
keep track of certain effects that may or may not be applied to your
character. You can make saving throws at this time to attempt to put an
end to ongoing damage. Also note that some effects end on the end of
your turn. 
Actions on your turn
On your turn in combat, your character can perform actions. The main action
types are
 Standard action: Attacking and charging are examples of standard
actions. Most attack powers require a standard action. You can take one
standard action on your turn.
 Move action: Move actions involve moving from one place to another.
Walking, running, and shifting are examples of move actions. Most
powers that allow you to move in some way are move actions.
 Minor action: Minor actions enable you to get ready to perform a more
substantial and exciting action (such as a standard or a move). Pulling
an item from a pouch, unsheathing a weapon, opening a door, and pick-
ing up an item are examples of minor actions.
 Free action: Free actions take almost no time and have little effect. You
can take as many free actions as you want, though the DM may restrict
how many you perform on your turn. Yelling a battle cry, speaking a
couple of sentences, and dropping an item are examples of free actions.
You can take your actions in any order you want, and you don’t have to per-
form every action you are entitled to. You can also substitute actions. You
can always take a move action or a minor action in place of a standard action,
and you can take a minor action instead of a move action. So, on your turn,
you can do any one of the following sets of actions, in any order:
 Standard action, move action, minor action
 Standard action, two minor actions
77
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

 Two move actions, minor action
 Move action, two minor actions
 Three minor actions
Actions on other turns
You can take some actions on another character’s turn, but some actions can
be taken only during your own turn:
 Opportunity action: You can take one opportunity action on each com-
batant’s turn. An opportunity action must be triggered by an enemy’s
action. The most common opportunity action is an opportunity attack
(an attack you make when an enemy leaves a square adjacent to you or
uses a ranged or area power while adjacent to you). 
 Immediate action: You can take one immediate action per round, either
an immediate interrupt or an immediate reaction triggered by an event
or the action of another combatant.
 Free action: You can take any number of free actions on other combat-
ants’ turns, as allowed by your DM.
Engaging in Combat
Combat encounters break out when the player characters run into an oppos-
ing force. That force could be a powerful solo monster, a group of terrifying
creatures, or a gang of villainous nonplayer characters. The chaos of combat
is organized into a cycle of rounds and turns:
 Round: In a round, every combatant takes a turn. A round represents
about six seconds in the game world.
 Turn: On your turn, you take actions in any order you want.
Combat sequence
A combat encounter follows this sequence:
 Establish positions. The DM decides where the combatants start out on
the battle grid. The DM shows the players where they can set up their
characters and then places the monsters.
 Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the encounter rolls initiative (roll a
d20 and add your initiative modifier, as shown on your character sheet).
This determines the order of battle for the entire encounter.
78
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

 Take turns. In initiative order, highest result starting first, every combat-
ant takes a turn.
 Repeat. Start a new round and repeat the initiative order. Continue until
one side or the other flees or is defeated.
 End the encounter. After one side or the other flees or is defeated, the
encounter ends when the remaining side takes a short or an extended
rest.
Attacking with a weapon
In the D&D game, the two basic ways to attack with weapons are as follows:
 Melee attacks: These attacks require the use of a melee weapon (such as
a sword or mace), and your character must be adjacent to an enemy to
make a melee attack. 
 Ranged attacks: Attacks of this sort require the use of a ranged weapon
(such as a shortbow or crossbow). You must be able to draw an imagi-
nary line between your character and the enemy target. If walls or other
obstacles completely block the path between your character’s square
and the target’s square, you can’t make a ranged attack because your
character doesn’t have a clear line of sight. If you’re adjacent to an
enemy when you make a ranged attack, that enemy can make an oppor-
tunity attack against you.
The attack and damage rolling process is as follows:
1. Decide which weapon your character is using to make the attack.
2. Roll a d20 and add the bonus listed for that weapon.
3. If the result of the roll and modifier is equal to or higher than the
monster’s Armor Class, your attack hits.
4. If the attack hits, roll the type of die indicated for the weapon’s
damage and add the listed modifier (if any).
5. Damage reduces the monster’s hit points; if the monster’s hit points
drop to 0, it’s defeated.
Other defenses
In addition to Armor Class, player characters and monsters all have three
other defenses that come into play during combat. These defenses are
Fortitude, Reflex, and Will. Like Armor Class, these defenses provide the
target number for certain attacks. Different powers, for example, target differ-
ent defenses.
79
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

Attacks and damage
If you successfully attack an enemy with a basic attack or power, you deal
damage. Roll the damage dice as specified on your character sheet. Damage
reduces a character’s hit points.
Some powers deal ongoing damage on the turns after the initial attack. See
the earlier section, “Taking your turn,” for more information about how to
deal with such effects at the start and end of your turn.
Critical hits
When you roll a 20 on the die when making an attack roll, you score a critical
hit. Instead of rolling damage, you deal the maximum amount of damage pos-
sible for the attack when you score a critical hit.
For example, Regdar scores a critical hit with his basic melee attack. The
damage for this attack is 1d10 + 4. So, maximum damage for this attack is 
14 points of damage (10 + 4 =14).
Flanking
Flanking provides a simple combat tactic for you and an ally to use against an
enemy. To flank an enemy, you and an ally must be adjacent to the enemy and
on opposite sides of the enemy’s space. You and your ally must be able to
attack the enemy (with a melee or ranged weapon or with an unarmed
attack). If there’s a barrier between your enemy and either you or your ally,
you don’t flank. If you’re affected by a condition that prevents you from
taking actions, you don’t flank. Be careful, though — two monsters working
together can flank you!
You have combat advantage against an enemy you flank (see the next section).
Combat advantage
When a defender can’t give full attention to defense, it grants combat advan-
tage to its attacker. This usually occurs when the defender is flanked,
stunned, or otherwise caught off guard. When you have combat advantage,
you gain +2 bonus to attack rolls.
You must be able to see the target to gain combat advantage against it.
80
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Other actions in combat
In addition to making a basic attack, you have a few other options in combat.
These include
 Use your second wind. As a standard action, you can spend a healing
surge to regain hit points. When you do, you regain one-quarter of your
maximum hit points (rounded down). You also gain a +2 bonus to all
defenses until the start of your next turn. You can use your second wind
once per encounter.
 Use a power. Most powers are standard actions. Refer to your character
sheet to see what powers you have access to.
Using Powers in Combat
In addition to basic melee and basic ranged attacks, all characters have
access to powers they can use during combat. Powers include attack powers
(used to harm enemies) and utility powers (used to overcome obstacles in or
out of combat). Powers are restricted by how often you can use them:
 At-will powers are powers you can use as often as you want. They repre-
sent easy attacks or simple magical effects that don’t tax your resources.
 Encounter powers are powers that you can use once per encounter.
These are more powerful and dramatic than at-will powers. You need to
take a short rest to recharge encounter powers.
 Daily powers are powers that you can use once per day. These are the
most powerful effects you can produce, and using them puts a signifi-
cant strain on your resources. You need to take an extended rest to
recharge daily powers.
Types of powers used in combat
Powers range from the spells of arcane characters to the prayers of divine
characters to the exploits of martial characters. The use of most powers
requires a standard action and an attack roll against an opponent’s defense
(either Armor Class, Fortitude, Reflex, or Will).
 Divine prayers: Clerics cast divine prayers. The ready-to-play clerics
(see Chapter 6) can use each of their listed powers as defined in the
power descriptions.

How to read a power
The powers in the Player’s Handbook are a little dense to read through at first. In this sidebar, we
show you how to read a power’s description using freezing cloud as an example. (This applies to
powers in the Player’s Handbook and to the powers for the sample characters in Chapters 3 through
6 in this book.)
The superscript numbers in parenthesis (such as (1)) correspond to the numbers in the following list
that describes each part of the power. (Note that these numbers don’t appear in regular power
descriptions.)
Freezing Cloud (1)
Wizard Attack 1 (2)
A pellet shoots from your hand and explodes into a cloud of icy mist at the point of impact. (3)
Daily (4)  Arcane, Cold, Implement (5)
Standard Action (6)
Area burst 2 within 10 squares (7)
Target: Each creature in burst (8)
Attack: (9) d20 + 4 versus Fortitude (10)
Hit: 1d8 + 4 cold damage (11)
Miss: Half damage (12)
Effect: The cloud lasts until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the cloud or starts
its turn there is subject to another attack. You can dismiss the cloud as a minor action. (13)
The following list breaks down each numbered part of the power block. (Note that not all powers
have all these entries — for example, most powers don’t have a Miss effect.)
(1) The power’s name: The name of the power. Freezing cloud, in this case.
(2) The power’s class, type, and level: The class indicated which classes can use the power
(wizard, for this example). The type indicated what type of power it is, such as an attack or util-
ity power. The level indicates the minimum level your character has to be to choose the power,
and also how powerful or weak the power is.
(3) Flavor text: A description of what the power does and how it looks when used.
(4) Usage: This describes how often you can use the power — at will, once per encounter, or once
per day. Freezing cloud is a daily power, so you can use it once, and then it’s expended until the
next time your character can take a long rest.
(5) Keywords: These tell you what rules apply to this power. Arcane means that this power is
derived from the arcane power source — magic. Cold means that it’s a cold effect. Implement
means that your character delivers this attack with a wizardly implement such as a wand or
staff, as opposed to a weapon like a longsword.
(6) Action required: This tells you whether the power is a minor, move, standard, immediate, or
free action.

83
Chapter 7: Playing the Game
(7) Range: All powers are melee, close, area, ranged, or personal. In the case of area powers, the
power description tells you the size of the area affected and from how far away you can use
the power.
(8) Target: The creatures or area you can affect with the power.
(9) Attack modifier: The die and modifier you roll when you attack.
(10) Defense targeted: Which of the enemy’s defenses (Fortitude, Reflex, Will, or Armor Class) this
power attacks.
(11) Hit: The power’s effect on a hit. For this example, if freezing cloud hits, you deal some cold
damage to the target.
(12) Miss: Some powers also have effects even if you miss.
(13) Effect: Other effects of using the power. Anything explained here happens whether you hit or
miss the target with your attack roll.
 Arcane spells: Wizards cast arcane spells. The ready-to-play wizards
(see Chapter 5) can use each of their listed powers as defined in the
power descriptions. (During the preparation that accompanies an
extended rest, the wizard decides which of his or her daily and utility
powers are available for that day of adventuring.)
 Martial exploits: Fighters and rogues use martial exploits. The ready-to-
play fighters and rogues (see Chapters 3 and 4) can use each of their
listed powers as defined in the power descriptions.
Power attack types
Powers come in a four attack types:
 Melee attack: A power that uses a melee attack usually uses a weapon
and targets one enemy within reach (which is usually an enemy in an
adjacent square). If a power attacks multiple enemies, you make a 
separate attack and damage roll for each target.
 Ranged attack: A power that uses a ranged attack strikes against a
single distant target. If a power attacks multiple enemies, you make a
separate attack and damage roll for each target. Making a ranged attack
provokes opportunity attacks from adjacent enemies.
 Close attack: A power that uses a Close attack is an attack that comes
directly from you. A Close attack creates an area of effect, usually a blast
or burst:

• A Close burst uses your square as its origin space and extends in all
directions out to the number of spaces specified in the power.
Unless a power description notes otherwise, a close burst that you
create does not affect you.
• A Close blast fills an area adjacent to you that is a specified number
of squares on a side. The blast must be adjacent to its origin
square, which is your space. It does not affect the origin square.
When you make a Close attack, make a separate attack roll for each
target in the area of effect, but make only one damage roll that affects all
the targets.
 Area attack: A power that uses an Area attack creates an area of effect,
usually a burst. Choose a square within range of the power to serve as
the origin square.
An Area burst uses the square you designate as its origin space and
extends in all directions out to the number of spaces specified in the
power. Unless a power description notes otherwise, an area burst that
you create does affect you.
When you make an Area attack, make a separate attack roll for each
target in the area of effect, but make only one damage roll that affects all
the targets.
If you use an Area power while adjacent to an enemy, that enemy can
make an opportunity attack against you.
Movement in Combat
You can use a move action to walk your speed in a turn. If you use two move
actions (substituting a move for a standard action), you can walk your speed
twice on your turn.
Move actions
These activities require the use of a move action.
 Walk: Move up to your speed.
 Shift: Move 1 square without provoking opportunity attacks. You can’t
normally shift into difficult terrain.
 Run: Move up to your speed +2 squares and grant combat advantage.
84
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Forced movement
Certain powers and effects allow you to pull, push, or slide a target:
 Pull: When you pull a creature, each square you move it must bring it
nearer to you.
 Push: When you push a creature, each square you move it must place it
farther away from you.
 Slide: When you slide a creature, there’s no restriction on the direction
you can move it.
The following rules govern all forced movement:
 Distance: The power specifies how many squares you can move a target.
You can choose to move the target fewer squares or not to move the
target at all.
 Specific destination: Some powers instead specify a destination, such as
any square adjacent to you.
 No opportunity attacks: Forced movement does not provoke opportu-
nity attacks.
 Difficult terrain: Forced movement isn’t hindered by difficult terrain.
 Not a move: Forced movement doesn’t count against a target’s ability to
move on its turn.
 Valid space: Forced movement can’t move a target into a space it 
couldn’t enter by walking.
For more information on pull, push, slide, and forced movement, see page 285
of the Player’s Handbook.
Distance and movement
To measure distance on a battle grid, simply count squares. You can move
your speed in squares as a move action, in any direction, across squares or
across diagonals.
Occupied squares
In general, you can’t move through an occupied square.
85
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

 Ally: You can move through a square occupied by an ally. 
 Enemy: You can’t move through an enemy’s space unless that enemy is
helpless. (Unconscious foes are normally helpless.)
 Ending movement: You can’t end your movement in an occupied square
unless it’s an ally’s square and the ally is prone, or it’s an enemy’s 
square and the enemy is helpless.
Difficult terrain
Rubble, undergrowth, shallow bogs, steep stairs, and other types of difficult
terrain hamper movement. It costs 1 additional square of movement to enter
a square of difficult terrain. If you don’t have enough movement remaining,
you can’t enter a square of difficult terrain. You can’t shift into a square of 
difficult terrain unless you have a power that allows you to do so.
Obstacles
You can’t enter a square with an obstacle that fills the square, such as a wall
or pillar. When an obstacle fills a square, you can’t move diagonally across
the corner of that square.
Spending and Gaining Action Points
Once per encounter, you can spend an action point, which is a special advan-
tage that player characters (and some monsters) have to represent their
heroic (or formidable) nature. An action point allows you to take an extra
action on your turn. When you spend an action point, it’s gone. You earn
more action points by adventuring.
 Player characters start with 1 action point. Only some monsters have
action points, as shown in a monster’s stat block.
 Player characters gain 1 action point when they reach a milestone in the
adventure. A milestone occurs at the end of every two encounters that
the PCs complete in the same day (without taking an extended rest, see
the later section, “Rest and Recovery”). So, if the PCs complete five
encounters before deciding to take an extended rest, they would earn a
milestone at the end of the second and fourth encounters that day.
 After an extended rest (described in the “Rest and Recovery” section),
player characters lose any unspent action points, but start fresh with 
1 action point.
86
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Most often, you spend an action point to take an extra action during your
turn. Sometimes you might spend an action point because you have some
other special benefit for doing so because of your paragon path or feat selec-
tion. You decide whether the extra action is a standard action, a move action,
or a minor action.
Facing Skill Challenges
In a skill challenge, your character makes skill checks to accumulate a
number of successes before accumulating too many failures and ending the
encounter. For example, if Lidda is trying to disable a complicated trap, she
needs to attain six successes before accruing three failures.
A skill challenge plays out like a combat encounter, with player characters
taking turns to help overcome the challenge. They PCs might use the same
skills, or they might each use different skills to approach the problem from
different directions. 
Hit Points, Healing, and Dying
Over the course of a battle, characters take damage from attacks. Damage
reduces a character’s hit points.
 Maximum hit points: PCs and monsters have a maximum number of hit
points, as determined by class, level, and Constitution score. A charac-
ter’s current hit points can’t exceed this number.
 Bloodied: When your current hit points drop to one-half your maximum
hit points or lower, your character is bloodied. Certain powers work
only (or work better) against a bloodied target.
 Dying: When a PCs current hit points drop to 0 or lower, the PC falls
unconscious and is dying. Any damage the PC takes continues to reduce
the PC’s current hit points until the character dies. When a monster’s hit
points drop to 0, it is defeated.
 Death saving throw: When a PC is dying, the player makes a saving
throw at the end of his or her turn each round. If the save succeeds (roll
10 or better), there is no change in the PC’s condition. If the save fails
(roll lower than 10), the PC slips one step closer to death. If the save
fails three times, the character dies. 
 Death: When a PC takes damage that reduces his or her current hit
points to a negative number that’s the same as the PC’s bloodied
number, or if the PC fails the death save three times, the character dies.
Monsters simply die when they are reduced to 0 hit points.
87
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

Healing in combat
Even as the battle rages, characters can heal. A PC can heal himself by using
his second wind (see page 291 in the Player’s Handbook). An ally can use the
Heal skill or power on a PC (see the following section). Monsters have limited
ways to heal, as described in the encounters and the monster stat blocks,
when appropriate.
When a power heals a PC, the PC doesn’t have to take an action to spend a
healing surge. Even when a PC is unconscious, the power uses the PC’s heal-
ing surge to restore hit points. And some powers don’t require a character to
spend a healing surge at all.
Healing the dying
If a player character is dying and receives healing, the PC goes to 0 hit points
and then regains hit points from there. As soon as the PC’s current hit point
total is higher than 0, he or she becomes conscious and is no longer dying.
Rest and Recovery
Outside of encounters, player characters can take one of two types of rest:
 Short rest: A short rest allows PCs to renew their encounter powers and
use healing surges to regain hit points. It lasts about five minutes. PCs
can take as many short rests per day as they want. During a short rest,
PCs have to rest; no strenuous activity, no interruptions.
 Extended rest: Once per day, PCs can take an extended rest. It must last
at least six hours to gain the benefits. PCs have to rest or sleep during
this period. At the end of the rest, they regain any hit points they lost
and any healing surges they spent, their daily powers are renewed, and
they lose any unspent action points and gain 1 fresh action point.
Conditions That Affect Combat
Powers, monsters, traps, and the environment can all apply conditions to a
character. A condition imposes a penalty or other effect until it is removed by
a successful saving throw or it ends naturally.
88
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Conditions that can affect a character are as follows:
Blinded: You can’t see any target (your targets have total concealment), you
take a –10 penalty to Perception checks, and you grant combat advantage.
Furthermore, you can’t flank an enemy.
Dazed: You grant combat advantage and you can’t flank an enemy. You can
take a standard action, a move action, or a minor action on your turn, rather
than one of each. (You can also take free actions.) You can’t take immediate
actions or opportunity actions.
Deafened: You can’t hear anything, and you take a –10 penalty to Perception
checks.
Dominated: You’re dazed, and the dominating creature chooses your one
action. The only powers it can make you use are at-will powers.
Dying: You’re unconscious because you’re at 0 or negative hit points. You
make a death saving throw every round.
Helpless: You grant combat advantage. Note: Usually you’re helpless because
you’re unconscious.
Immobilized: You can’t move from your space, although you can teleport
and can be forced to move by a pull, a push, or a slide.
Marked: You take a –2 penalty to attack rolls if your attack doesn’t include
the creature that marked you.
Petrified: You have been turned to stone. You can’t take actions, but you gain
resist 20 to all damage. You are unaware of your surroundings; you don’t age.
Prone: You’re lying on the ground. (If you’re flying, you safely descend a dis-
tance equal to your fly speed. If you don’t reach the ground, you fall.) You
grant combat advantage to enemies making melee attacks against you, but
you get a +2 bonus to all defenses against ranged attacks from nonadjacent
enemies. You take a –2 penalty to attack rolls.
Restrained: You’re immobilized; you can’t be forced to move by a pull, a
push, or a slide. You grant combat advantage, and you take a –2 penalty to
attack rolls.
Slowed: Your speed becomes 2. This speed applies to all your movement
modes, but it does not apply to teleportation or to a pull, push, or slide. You
can’t increase your speed above 2, and your speed doesn’t increase if it was
lower than 2. If you’re slowed while moving, stop moving if you have already
moved 2 or more squares.
89
Chapter 7: Playing the Game

Stunned: You can’t take actions; you grant combat advantage. When stunned,
you can’t flank an enemy.
Surprised: You grant combat advantage; you can’t take actions, other than
free actions. When surprised, you can’t flank an enemy.
Unconscious: You’re helpless; you fall prone, if possible. You can’t take
actions, and you take a –5 penalty to all defenses. This probably won’t sur-
prise you, but you can’t flank an enemy while unconscious.
Weakened: Your attacks deal half damage. Ongoing damage you deal is not
affected.

Practice Session
In This Chapter
 Using the battle grid and character markers
 Testing player characters against monsters
 Adding story elements to make an adventure
I
n the preceding chapters, we present an overview of the basics of the
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game; we introduce a group of ready-to-play charac-
ters; and we show you how to make attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill
checks. After going over the basics, you can actually roll some dice and see
how it all comes together at the gaming table.
This chapter takes you on a tour of a sample play session of DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS. Note that you need a set of D&D dice to participate in this practice
session. You can get a set of D&D dice at your local game store or bookstore,
or you can buy a set from any online game seller. When you get your dice,
continue with this practice session.
The Battle Grid and Markers
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game uses three-dimensional components to help
players visualize scenes and work through tactics and strategy in combat.
Miniatures and a battle grid provide the best way to visualize the action. 
A fold-out battle grid is included with this book. One side has an open grid
that can be used to replicate any dungeon scene. The other side is set up as a
portion of a dungeon and can be used with the sample adventure presented
in Chapter 24.
A battle grid consists of 1-inch squares. You count distances in squares
(though you can convert to the game world dimensions of 1 square equals 
5 feet if you want). For example, Regdar has a speed of 5, meaning that he can
move 5 squares when he uses a move action to walk or a standard action to
charge and attack.

You use the battle grid and miniatures or other markers (see the following
section, “Markers”) to show the marching order of your group of adventurers
or the relative location of characters and monsters in any given encounter.
The best use for the battle grid is when the characters stumble or charge into
combat. When you can see how far away or how close the monster is, as well
as where other player characters are in relation to it and your character, you
can plan better moves and make full use of the environment during combat
encounters.
A larger version of the battle grid can be found in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
You might also want to use D&D Dungeon Tiles, which provide cardstock tiles
that you can arrange in any configuration. You can purchase more durable
battle grids made of vinyl at game and hobby stores or from online game 
sellers.
Markers
The battle grid works only if you use something to represent player charac-
ters and monsters. The battle grid in this book features cut-out markers that
include a mix of characters and monsters. Carefully cut apart the markers
and set them aside for later use. If you’re ambitious, you can gather a bunch
of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS miniatures to use instead of the markers.
Most characters and many monsters are considered to be Medium in size. 
A Medium character occupies a single square on the battle grid. Large crea-
tures occupy a 2 x 2 area, or 4 squares. Only one character or creature can
occupy a square. Characters can move through squares occupied by friendly
characters, but they can’t move through squares occupied by enemies.
Characters can’t stop moving in an occupied square (whether the occupant
is a friend or an enemy doesn’t matter).
Moving on the battle grid
To move, your character must use an action. Usually, you use the Walk
action, which allows your character to move a number of squares equal to
his or her speed. Walk requires your character to use a move action; nor-
mally, your character can use a standard action, a move action, and a minor
action each turn. That means your character can move up to his or her speed
on the Battle Grid with a move action, and then attack an enemy with a stan-
dard action. (You can also choose to spend a standard action as another
move action and walk again, so you can move twice in a turn if you don’t use
any other actions.) For example, Regdar has a speed of 5. On his turn, he can
walk 5 squares (his move action), and then use his sure strike power (a stan-
dard action) to attack an enemy, as shown in Figure 8-1.

Part I: D&D Crash Course 

A Practice Combat
Now it’s time for a practice combat involving player characters and mon-
sters. This is very much like a real combat encounter that you would have in
any D&D adventure. You need players; say there are four of you, one to play a
character of each class described in this book. You need a Dungeon Master to
run the monsters. Have each player select a character to play. (You can use
the sample characters in Chapters 3 through 6 or create your own.) You can
use the battle grid in the front of this book — each player can pick a charac-
ter marker, and the DM should carefully cut out the two orc and two kobold
markers. (These are the monsters that the four player characters will face in
this practice session.) Note that both orcs have the same statistics and the
same number of hit points, and the same is true of the kobolds.
Placing characters on the battle grid 
and rolling initiative
Set the battle grid included with this book on the table and make sure the
players and DM can comfortably sit around the play area with room for 
character sheets and dice rolling. The four player characters start on one end
of the battle grid. The DM places the two orc and two kobold markers any-
where in the middle of the battle grid.
Next, everyone rolls initiative. Roll the d20 and add your character’s initiative
modifier. The DM makes a roll that covers both orcs, and a roll that covers

both kobolds. (The orc and kobold statistics can be found in the nearby side-
bars.) The DM jots down each character’s result, in order, from highest to
lowest. That sets the order of play for this combat encounter.
For example, Redgar gets a result of 11. Shadow gets a result of 20. Telsa gets
a result of 18. Eberk gets a result of 2. The DM rolls and gets results of 5 and
10 for the orcs and kobolds. So, the initiative order for this combat looks like
this:
Shadow

Telsa

Regdar

Kobolds

What to do on a turn
Each turn, a creature in combat can spend a standard action, a move action,
and a minor action. Standard actions are most important: All attacks are
standard actions. Move actions mean that the creature actually moves on 
the battle grid — for example, by using the Walk action (move up to the 
creature’s speed) or by using the Shift action (move one square). Minor
actions are good for using powers or abilities that only require a minor action,
such as a cleric’s healing word prayer. A creature can spend its standard
action as a move action instead, if it wants. What that all means is this: On a
typical turn, you can move and attack, you can attack and move, or you can
move twice.
Remember that to make an attack, you roll a d20 and add the modifier for the
weapon or power your character is using. If an attack hits (you get a result
that’s equal to or higher than your opponent’s Armor Class or other appro-
priate defense), roll the die or dice listed for the weapon’s damage. Damage
reduces a character’s (or monster’s) hit points.
If the characters reduce both orcs and both kobolds to 0 hit points, the char-
acters win the combat. If the monsters reduce all the characters to 0 hit
points, the monsters win the combat.

Part I: D&D Crash Course 

The Dungeon Master
The presence of a Dungeon Master turns D&D from a board game into a role-
playing game where anything can happen. You can run this practice session
with the DM simply controlling the actions of the monsters, or you can let the
DM practice his or her DMing skills. A Dungeon Master isn’t competing
against the players (even though he or she controls their opponents in an
adventure). The DM sets the scene, describes the action, and calls for skill
checks and other rolls when necessary.
Example of player versus monster combat
Here’s how the first round of this combat encounter might play out:
Turn 1 — Shadow: Shadow goes first (she had the highest initiative
result). She draws her hand crossbow and fires at the orc on the right.
She rolls a 4 on the d20 and adds her modifier of +6 for a result of 10.
That’s not enough to hit the orc’s Armor Class of 16, and the hand cross-
bow bolt whizzes past the orc’s head.
Turn 1 — Telsa: Telsa acts next. She uses a move action to get closer to
the monsters and then for her standard action she casts her burning
hands spell. This produces a Close blast 5 effect, which is a large enough

area to target all the monsters. She rolls separate attacks against each
monster, getting 23 (a critical hit!) and 10 against the orcs, and 16 and 11
against the kobolds. These attacks are against the monsters’ Reflex
defenses, so the attack hits one of the orcs and one of the kobolds. The
orc takes maximum damage because Telsa rolled a crit; 15 points of
damage reduces the orc to 13 hit points. The orc is bloodied! The kobold
takes 10 points of damage and is reduced to 17 hit points.
Turn 1 — Regdar: Regdar acts next. He uses a move action to get close
to the same orc that Telsa damaged, and he uses a standard action to
make an attack. He uses his reaping strike attack. He gets an 18 on his
attack (a hit) and deals 12 points of damage to the orc! The orc has 1 hit
point left! Plus, the orc is marked, meaning that it needs to include
Regdar as a target in its next attack.

Turn 1 — Kobolds: The kobolds get to act now. They move to flank
Regdar. They are both adjacent to the target, so their mob attack ability
comes into play. The DM rolls a d20 and adds the kobold’s modifier of +7
(+6 plus +1 due to mob attacks) for a result of 14 for the first kobold 
(a miss) and 21 for the second. The 21 is a hit! The kobold also has
combat advantage against Regdar since it’s flanking him; it deals 9 points
of damage to Regdar, leaving the fighter with 20 hit points.
Turn 1 — Orcs: The orcs get to act now. The orc on the left swings his
club at Regdar. The DM rolls a d20 and adds the orc’s modifier of +8 for a
result of 18. That’s a hit! The orc deals 4 points of damage to Regdar, leav-
ing the fighter with 16 hit points. The second orc, the one with 1 hit point
remaining, attempts to run away. When it leaves the square adjacent to
Regdar, the fighter gets to make an opportunity attack against it. Regdar
hits, and the orc drops to the ground.
Turn 1 — Eberk: Eberk has a turn now. He uses a minor action to cast a
healing word spell, healing some of Regdar’s damage. Then he moves up
to a kobold and attacks. He rolls a 12, which misses the kobold, who
hisses at the dwarf.
The first round of the combat has ended. Will the adventurers beat the 
monsters and win the day? Roll some dice and find out by playing through
this scenario yourself!
Adding Story Elements
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game provides a platform for players to tell exciting
stories in a medieval fantasy world. It’s easy for the Dungeon Master to add
story elements to an encounter and for the players to imagine what kinds of
things their characters will do. In this section, we take the orc battle example
and add some story elements to it.
Use the dungeon side of the battle grid. Pick any room and place the markers
for the monsters anywhere within it. Let the player characters start outside
the room, somewhere down the corridor. The DM decides that the monsters
have recently raided a human village, and now they’re inside this dungeon
room dividing their spoils. Maybe the orcs have a sack of ten silver pieces, a
rusty sword, a scrawny dog tied to a table leg, and a scroll they stole from an
empty farmhouse. The orcs are laughing and congratulating themselves in
their coarse language when the player characters reach the corridor beyond.
Now the DM calls for Perception skill checks. The DM decides that it isn’t too
hard to hear the monsters and sets a target of 10 (called the Difficulty Class
or DC) for the check. If any of the characters get a result of 10 or better on
their check, they hear the noise coming from the room.
97
Chapter 8: Practice Session

If the characters all fail to hear the noise, the DM can see whether the orcs
hear the approaching characters. Because the orcs are laughing and talking,
the DM decides that the monsters have a harder time hearing the player
characters and sets the DC at 15.
Now, maybe the characters know that something is in the room, maybe they
don’t. Maybe the orcs and kobolds know the characters are coming, maybe
they don’t. The DM can use this information to build tension and drama as
the characters move closer to the room.
When the characters finally reach the room and look in, they see the two
orcs, the two kobolds, a table, and the spoils from the village. Can the adven-
turers defeat the monsters? Will the monsters try to fight or beg for their
lives? What about the spoils? Is the rusty sword enchanted with magic
power? Did the scroll belong to a wizard or does it have some important mes-
sage scrawled upon its surface? Maybe it’s a map to another dungeon and
some fantastic treasure.
Story isn’t hard, and the elements it brings to the game are fun! Give it a try
after you’ve had some combat practice.

D
UNGEONS & DRAGONS is a cooperative game; you need at least one other
person to play with, and preferably as many as five or six people alto-
gether. One person is the Dungeon Master, the player who runs the monsters,
presents the dungeon or adventure, and generally keeps the game moving.
Everybody else controls a player character — a single hero in the DM’s 
adventure.
In this chapter, we take a look at finding a game to play in, organizing your
own game if you can’t (or don’t want to) find another game to play in, and
joining a high-level game. We also provide you with a ready-to-play character
at 4th level and at 8th level — Regdar, the human fighter.
A Typical Game Session
You might wonder what a D&D game session looks like. What do people wear,
what do they bring, how long do they play, and where do they play? The best
comparison for a D&D game is a regular Friday night poker game. People
dress casually, they usually meet at somebody’s house, they bring some
snacks or drinks and what they need to play, and the game usually runs three
or four hours — sometimes longer, sometimes shorter.

When you get invited to join a D&D game, it’s a good idea to ask or check
about the following:
 When is the game? Make sure you’re punctual!
 Where is the game? Make sure you get good directions to the host’s
house or the hobby store, library, community center, or such place
where the game is taking place. Get a street address and use MapQuest
(www.mapquest.com) if you need to, or arrange to ride to the game
with a friend.
 Who’s the Dungeon Master? As a new player, the DM is your best friend.
Get in touch with the DM a day or two before the game and find out what
he or she expects of you. 
 Ask what game materials you should bring. Most players show up for a
game with the Player’s Handbook, a set of D&D dice, something to write
with and on, and their character sheet. Bring this For Dummies book if
you expect to play one of the ready-made characters presented in
Chapters 3 through 6.
 Ask if you can bring food and beverages. Bring some cash so you can
pitch in for a pizza or something.
 Don’t assume it’s okay to bring children. Older children may very well
want to play in the game with you, and that’s something you need to
clear with the people you will be playing with. Younger children demand
your time and attention, and they will probably make things difficult for
you and for everybody else. D&D night is probably a good time to get a
babysitter. 
The first few times you play, it’s a good idea to do a lot of listening and watch-
ing and not so much talking. As you’re learning your character’s abilities and
figuring out how the game works, pay attention to how the other players con-
duct themselves at the table. You can take your cues from them.
Finding Someone to Play With
So, say that you bought the Player’s Handbook, flipped through the book
you’re holding in your hands, and have generally decided you’d like to play
some D&D. How do you go about finding a game to play in? You have two
basic choices: Find someone else’s game to join or organize your own game.
100
Part I: D&D Crash Course 

Joining someone else’s game
This is probably the easiest way to go if you’re a novice at D&D. Find an exist-
ing group of players who are willing to make some room for you at the table
and begin playing with those folks. Every week, hundreds of thousands of
people gather for regular D&D games with friends or strangers, just like
people fall into regular poker games, bowling leagues, or bingo nights. All you
have to do is identify an existing group somewhere near you and let the mem-
bers know you’re interested.
So where do you find a D&D group meeting in your town? Try the following:
 Friends and family: Ask people you know to find out if somebody is in a
game or if that person knows somebody who’s in a game.
 Gaming clubs: Many high schools and colleges have active gaming
clubs. If you’re a student, see whether your school has a club or organi-
zation that sponsors regular games.
 The friendly local gaming store: People looking for players to join their
game, or people looking for games to join, often post messages in local
hobby stores. You won’t find this sort of “player corkboard” at a big
bookstore that carries D&D books — you need to find local hobby stores
for this kind of search. The best hobby stores often sponsor games right
on-site, which is a great way to meet people you might want to game
with.
 The Internet: Some popular Web sites or message boards frequented by
D&D fans include “players seeking players” posts. A good site for this
sort of thing is www.wizards.com/community. If you’re under 18,
please check with your parents before you start trying to meet strangers
online.
 The RPGA: This stands for Roleplaying Gamers Association, a world-
wide network of D&D fans. Contact the RPGA at www.wizards.com/
rpga and ask them if there are any RPGA chapters in your hometown. 
Now, here’s the hard part: Most gamers understand that it can be difficult to
find a game to play in, but you need to show some courtesy when you ask to
join a gaming group of strangers. Try something like, “I understand you run a
regular D&D game. I’m interested in trying it out. Are you looking for new
players?” Don’t take it too personally if the answer is no; it’s not unusual for
Dungeon Masters to decline to add new players if they’re already running a
game with a lot of players in it.
101
Chapter 9: Finding a D&D Game to Join

Organizing your own game
If you can’t locate an existing game to join, you’ll need to organize your own
game. Most players expect a D&D game to be an ongoing, regularly scheduled
event — just like that weekly poker night we were talking about.
Your first order of business is finding a Dungeon Master (DM). Chances are
good that you know someone — or know someone who knows someone —
who’s played D&D before and can serve as the game master. If at all possible,
you want an experienced player to be your group’s DM. Failing that, you’ll
need to choose a DM for your new game. Because you’re trying to organize
the thing, you might as well take a stab at it.
After you’ve determined who’s going to be the DM, you need to round up a
group of reliable and interested players. Ideally, you’d like to start with three
to five players and one Dungeon Master. To find players, ask friends first.
Family members are okay, but we suggest siblings or cousins — if you bring a
parent or child to a game where most other people are about your age, you
may create an awkward social dynamic for everybody else. (Of course, if
everybody at the table is in your immediate family, that’s not a problem.)
If you can’t find enough players by asking people you know, you can try fish-
ing for fellow gamers in your town. Post notices at your local hobby store or
look for school gaming clubs (if you’re a student, that is).
After you’ve gathered enough people to play, choose a place and a time to
meet. In the long run, you’d like to find a good game night that could be regu-
larly scheduled for everybody in your game, but when you’re just starting it,
there’s no reason you can’t schedule your games one at a time. Find a place
where you can put half-a-dozen people around a good-sized table and not
bother other folks by making a lot of noise. If you play at a house where there
will be small children around, make sure that somebody (preferably someone
who’s not trying to play D&D with you) will be able to pay attention to the
kids and keep them entertained. 
102
Part I: D&D Crash Course 
The D&D Roleplaying Game Starter Set
If you’re a novice and everyone you’re playing
with is a novice too, we highly recommend that
you get your hands on the D&D Roleplaying
Game Starter Set and start there. This starter
set includes dice, character and monster
tokens, ready-to-play characters, dungeon tiles,
and ready-to-run dungeon scenarios. It’s the
best starting place for people who have never
played the game before, and you’ll have a much
easier time learning the ropes with the D&D
Roleplaying Game Starter Set than you will with
the Player’s Handbook and Dungeon Master’s
Guide. 

Starting Off with a High-Level Character
When you join a gaming group that’s been playing for a while, there’s an
excellent chance that their characters are well past 1st level. For example,
you might be told something like, “Great, glad you can join the game — bring
a 4th-level character on Saturday!”
Most Dungeon Masters have some ground rules for how new characters can
join the game, so you should ask ahead of time who’s going to be the
Dungeon Master and find out from that person how you should build a char-
acter to suit. Don’t be afraid to ask for help getting ready. But sometimes you
might be joining a game blind, without any knowledge of who’s DMing, what
sort of game they’re running, or how to get a character ready to play fast. For
those circumstances, we provide you with a 4th-level and 8th-level version of
Regdar, the fighter. (See Chapter 3 for Regdar at 1st level.) As a new player,
you’ll find that the easiest character class to play at higher levels is the
fighter. When you get to your new game, tell the Dungeon Master that you’re
ready to play a 4th-level fighter or an 8th-level fighter out of this book, if it’s
okay by him or her. 
If you want to play a fighter with Regdar’s stats but don’t like the name,
change it to something you like. If you prefer a female character, you need
only change the name.

Building a D&D
Character

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book is written for the player who
decides to become more invested in the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game. We take the basic material we introduced
earlier in the book and expand upon it. In this part, we
help you navigate the D&D Player’s Handbook and show
you how to make solid, informed choices about the kind
of character you want to build and how to best play that
character at the gaming table. From fully defining the D&D
character to examining classes, races, powers, and feat
and skill choices, we walk you through the character cre-
ation process and tell you what to look for as you gain
experience and “level up” your character.

T
his is the part of the book where you move on from basic game concepts
and dive headfirst into the full DUNGEONS & DRAGONS rules experience.
Don’t worry, we help you through it. And when you’re done, you’ll see that
even the advanced rules aren’t that tough or scary. Just keep the basics from
Part I in mind, and we’ll handle the rest.
At this point, we figure that you’ve used one of the ready-to-play characters
from Part I to play a game or two of D&D. Now you’re ready to create your
own character from the ground up. After all, creativity is one of the most
compelling aspects of roleplaying, and it all starts with your player character.
In this chapter, you take a more detailed look at the D&D character. We go
over all the basic statistics again, but this time we delve into all the possible
things you can do with them. This chapter helps you navigate the rest of 
Part II, explaining the parts of a full D&D character sheet and then pointing
you to the information you need to fill out each section as you create your
own character.
Your Character Sheet
A D&D character record sheet contains all the pertinent information and
game statistics for your player character. A character sheet can be as simple
as a blank piece of paper upon which you’ve written down all your charac-
ter’s statistics. Or you can get a premade, blank character sheet and fill it 
in. Blank character sheets are available online at www.dndinsider.com. 
You can also photocopy the two-page character sheet in the D&D Player’s
Handbook (see Figure 10-1). Yet another option is to pick up a pack of D&D
Character Sheets at your local game or hobby store. Use whichever version of
the character sheet that you feel most comfortable with. The information
that follows pertains to all versions of D&D character sheets.

You can approach the creation of a D&D character in many different ways.
Some people start out knowing exactly the kind of character they want to
play, from race and class to specific roleplaying quirks and background infor-
mation. Others build their characters around the ability scores they gener-
ated. Then there are those who know one aspect of the character they want
to play (the race or class, for example) and then decide on the rest after they
see how their scores line up. These are all good ways to approach character
creation. Throughout the chapters in this part of the book, we provide details
to help you make informed decisions, no matter which approach you take.
Filling Out the Character Sheet
You can fill out your character sheet in any order that makes sense to you.
We discuss the various sections of the character sheet in the order they
appear, however, so you can more easily reference the material. 
Names
There’s a place on the front of the character sheet for your name and your
character’s name. A cool, evocative character name helps set the personality
of your character and contributes to the tone of the campaign, so choose
your character’s name wisely. A campaign with characters named Elfy,
Figure 10-1:
The

the Player’s
Handbook.
112
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Sugarplum, Bennie, and Toejam has a very different feel than one that fea-
tures Regdar, Lidda, Wellyn, and Jerek. Talk with your Dungeon Master and
the other players to decide what kind of names (and what kind of campaign)
you all want to play, and then name your character accordingly. A good, solid
name is important, and even though the space for a name appears at the 
top of your character sheet, this is the piece of information you’ll probably
record last, after you see how the rest of your character’s statistics turn out
and you’ve had a chance to think about it. 
The D&D Player’s Handbook provides lists of sample names by character race
in Chapter 3. Feel free to use one of these names or to draw inspiration from
them as you craft your own name for your character.
Class and level
Out of all the characteristics, class has the most profound effect on your
character’s adventuring career. Class determines a character’s role in the
adventuring party and provides a character with special qualities that set
him or her apart from the rest of the team. You can select a class and then
apply your ability scores appropriately, or you can determine your ability
scores and select a class that takes best advantage of your results. Most
people choose their class first and then assign ability scores as appropriate
for that class.
Character level is usually easy when you’re creating a starting character: All
characters start at 1st level — unless the Dungeon Master gives you different
instructions. (Sometimes a DM has characters start at a level more suitable
for the campaign he or she plans to run, such as 3rd level if the DM wants 
the characters to have a little experience prior to the start of the campaign,
or 11th level if the DM wants to run a paragon-tier campaign right out of 
the gate.)
Chapter 11 provides detailed information on choosing a class. Chapter 18 
discusses levels and character advancement for when you’re ready to
improve your character.
Level modifier
In many places on the character sheet, you can find a reference to “1/2 LVL.”
This is your level modifier, which is a bonus to the most important things 
you do: attack, defend, and use skills. It’s equal to half your character level
(round down). For example, a 5th-level character adds a modifier of +2 to the
character’s attack rolls, skill checks, and defense scores. When you’re playing
a 1st-level character, your level modifier is +0.
113
Chapter 10: Defining Your Character

Path and destiny
When your character reaches 11th level, you get to select a paragon path. A
paragon path is a sort of advanced class that lets you specialize your charac-
ter; for example, paragon paths available to the fighter class include the iron
vanguard, kensei, pit fighter, and swordmaster. Your character doesn’t stop
gaining levels in his or her original class when you choose a paragon path;
instead, you gain the benefits of both your character’s paragon path and
class as your character reaches levels 11 through 20.
Epic destiny takes over when you finish up your paragon path. At 21st level,
you get to choose your character’s path to immortality. At the highest levels
of the game, your character transcends the merely mortal and becomes 
a hero of mythological proportions such as an archmage, a demigod, or 
an eternal seeker. As with the paragon path, your character continues to
advance in his or her class, but you gain access to abilities of incredible
power. After all, your character is contending with cosmic catastrophes and
evil gods by the time he or she reaches epic level!
If you’re confused by all these decision points, here’s the good news about
your paragon path and epic destiny: You don’t have to pick them for a long,
long time. Leave these lines blank for now. Play your character for a few
adventures and make your decision about your paragon path when the 
character gets closer to 11th level.
Race and size
Another key defining aspect of a D&D character is the fantasy race the char-
acter belongs to. In addition to humans, the fantasy worlds of D&D are inhab-
ited by all kinds of amazing, intelligent beings. Want to play an enigmatic 
elf? How about a dour dwarf? Maybe a dangerously curious halfling? Race
provides more than a colorful hook for roleplaying. Each race has ability
adjustments and special abilities to help set it apart from the others. After
you’ve decided on a race for your character, record it on the character sheet.
Most of the character races, including dwarves, elves, and humans, are
Medium in size. That’s the standard, and there are no special bonuses or
penalties associated with characters of this size. Both Medium and Small
characters occupy a single square on the battle grid. However, Small charac-
ters can’t use weapons that would be two-handed weapons for Medium 
characters. For more details about Small characters, see the halfling entry 
in Chapter 13.
Chapter 13 discusses the core D&D races in more detail and provides 
the information you need to choose the best race for the character you want
to play.
114
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Alignment, deity, and personality
Where does your character fit into the ongoing struggle between good and
evil? It’s a big question, but the answer to it (or at least the trip to discover
the answer) pervades every fantasy epic from The Lord of the Rings to the
Tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The same is true of
any DUNGEONS & DRAGONS campaign. In the D&D game, your character’s general
moral attitude is represented by the character’s alignment. Whether you
choose to be lawful good or chaotic evil, alignment is a tool for developing
your character’s identity in the game. Alignment isn’t designed to be restric-
tive, and characters can always behave inconsistently from time to time. Your
alignment choices are described on page 19 of the Player’s Handbook, and
include
 Good: Aiding people in need is the right thing to do. Laws or systems
that keep you from doing that need to be changed. 
 Lawful good: Just laws and honorable codes of conduct are the best
way to protect the weak from oppression. Laws or systems that aren’t
working should be reformed, not abandoned.
 Unaligned: You’re willing to help others, but you do so with the 
expectation of some reward.
115
Chapter 10: Defining Your Character

 Evil: Evil characters don’t care if they hurt other people as long as they
get ahead. They believe that the purpose of law and order is to protect
the privileged few and keep the weak oppressed. Check with your DM
before you choose this alignment!
 Chaotic evil: Chaotic evil characters take anything they want from
anyone who can’t stop them. The only law they respect is simply “might
makes right.” Check with your DM before you choose this alignment!
The thing to remember with alignment is that players should talk about their
choices before setting anything in stone. For example, your Dungeon Master
may have a particular type of campaign in mind, one that works best if the
characters all have complementary alignments. Sometimes the tension gener-
ated by having a chaotic evil character in with a group of lawful good ones
can be fun, but often such deviations lead to troublesome play and hard feel-
ings. Better to all move in compatible directions than in competitive ones
when playing D&D.
Another thing to consider when choosing your character’s alignment is that
D&D is really about heroes. The game works best when player characters
choose alignments that aren’t evil in outlook. Antiheroes and villains have
their place in fantasy stories, but the most memorable, long-lasting D&D cam-
paigns focus on the good guys.
Along with alignment, a character’s choice of deity can help create a back-
ground and an allegiance that give you more opportunities for roleplaying. Is
your fighter a casual follower of Avandra, the goddess of luck and adventure?
Or is he a committed servant of Bahamut, the god of honor and justice? A
character’s deity is a personal choice; each deity description in the Player’s
Handbook offers suggestions for character races or classes that might favor
that deity. Now, every campaign is different and may have a different selec-
tion of deities. Your Dungeon Master will tell you if you should select a deity
from the list in the Player’s Handbook or from some other source (such as the
FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Guide). Your choice of deity is more important if
you’re playing a cleric; see Chapter 15 for information on the cleric’s Channel
Divinity feats.
Finally, the last component of your character’s roleplaying characteristics is
personality. The concept of choosing personality traits may seem pedestrian
compared to electing to fight for good or evil or deciding which mythological
deity your character follows, but it’s also the place where you can put your
own completely unique stamp on your character. Is your human fighter a
glum, skeptical fellow who expects the worst at every turn, or is he a charm-
ing and reckless rake who laughs in the face of danger?
Chapter 2 of the Player’s Handbook offers some advice for picking out person-
ality traits that might surface in social encounters, in discussions of decisions
with other characters in the party, or when deadly peril threatens.
116
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

In the end, alignment, patron deity, and personality traits are mostly for flavor.
They’re here to help you roleplay your character better. Use them as much or
as little as you like. 
Character description
The next section of the character sheet provides a place to record informa-
tion that helps describe your character but has little effect on game play. Age,
height, and weight for your character are determined by personal choice
(although your DM has the right to veto really unusual choices such as char-
acters 11 feet tall, heroes who are very young children, and so on). The racial
descriptions in Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook provide guidance on the
average height and weight of various character races, and you can assume
that most characters begin their adventuring careers as young adults.
What you put in the Gender is a personal choice that has almost no effect in
the game. Male and female characters are totally equal. Chapter 3 in the
Player’s Handbook talks about the general appearance of each of the races,
and you can use the descriptions there as a starting point if you want to go
into more details about how your character appears.
Check out the D&D Character Visualizer at www.dndinsider.com. It allows
you to choose your character’s race and gender and then create the look of
your character. You add armor and weapons, decide on hair styles and
colors, and generally create a cool-looking D&D character that you can print
out and use on your character sheet. It’s a fun way to design the look of your
character.
Ability scores
In addition to class, race, and level, a character’s ability scores provide the
base upon which your character grows and develops. Consider ability scores
the frame upon which the rest of your statistics are hung. Every character
has six ability scores: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma. These scores provide modifiers that affect everything from
attacks and damage rolls to skill checks and saving throws.
Chapter 13 provides more information about ability scores and how 
they’re used.
Hit points and healing surges
When combat begins, your character’s hit points (hp) are literally all that
stands between the character and certain death. Class and level determine
your character’s hit point total, adjusted by your character’s Constitution
117
Chapter 10: Defining Your Character

score. Lose a few hit points in battle? No problem! Your character continues
to function without any ill effects as long as he or she has at least 1 hit point
remaining. That’s heroic and fantastic, and that’s pure D&D.
Your character class determines how many hit points your character has 
at 1st level. For example, a 1st-level fighter has a number of hit points equal
to 15 + Constitution score, whereas a 1st-level wizard has 10 + Constitution
score. If your fighter character has a Constitution score of 14, you have 29 hit
points at 1st level. Your character class also dictates how many hit points
you gain when you reach 2nd level and each time you go up a level after that.
(In the case of the fighter, it’s 6 hit points per level.)
Two important numbers are derived from your hit point score: 
 Bloodied number: Your bloodied number is simply half your normal
maximum hit points; this is the “halfway” point to falling unconscious.
Many characters and monsters have special powers or abilities that 
trigger when they become bloodied or when the opponent they’re 
fighting becomes bloodied. 
 Healing surge value: Your healing surge value is one-quarter of your
normal maximum hit points. Most healing effects in the game restore a
number of hit points equal to your healing surge value. For example, if
your character has 17 hit points, his bloodied number is 8, and his heal-
ing surge value is 4.
The number of times each day you can use a healing surge is determined
by your character class. For example, a fighter has a number of healing
surges equal to 9 + Constitution modifier. The fighter with a 14
Constitution (+2 Con modifier) can use 11 healing surges per day. 
When your character takes damage in battle or through some other method
(such as a trap or a natural hazard), that damage reduces your character’s
hit point total. When your character’s hit point total reaches 0, he or she falls
unconscious and is dying. When your hit points reach a negative number
equal to your bloodied number, your character dies.
Healing can restore lost hit points back up to your original total. However,
most healing effects require you to spend a healing surge. When your charac-
ter is out of healing surges, that’s it — no more healing effects requiring a
surge can work on that character. It’s time to call it quits and retreat from the
dungeon for the day before someone gets killed!
Senses
Your character sheet calls out two senses-related skills, Insight and
Perception. Insight is used to counter Bluff checks and to give you a sense 
of another character’s motives and attitudes. Perception describes your 
118
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

character’s ability to spot, hear, or otherwise sense danger and notice things
that aren’t obvious. Insight and Perception are Wisdom skills, but even if you
character isn’t trained in these skills, you need to know what your modifiers
are. Your modifier is equal to your level modifier plus your Wisdom modifier,
plus 5 if you character is trained in the skill.
Sometimes you don’t know whether you should be making an Insight or a
Perception check, so the Dungeon Master will instead check for you. This is
handled using your passive score. Your passive perception score, for example,
represents how hard it is for someone to escape your notice when you’re
alert but not looking for anything in particular. It’s equal to 10 + your
Perception modifier.
See Chapter 16 for more information on skills. 
Initiative
Initiative is a Dexterity check. It determines the order in which characters
and monsters act in combat. Your character’s initiative modifier is equal to
his level modifier plus his Dexterity modifier. You can improve your charac-
ter’s initiative even more by selecting the Improved Initiative feat. (See
Chapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook for this and other feat descriptions.)
Defenses
There are more dangers in D&D worlds than simply being attacked by sword,
bow, or claw. Environmental hazards, magical attacks, poisons, and mental
attacks are among the numerous other dangers adventurers face on a 
daily basis.
Your character has four defenses: Armor Class, Fortitude defense, Reflex
defense, and Will defense. Each monster attack or villain power your charac-
ter encounters in the game strikes at one of those four defenses. Your 
character’s defense score is the attack roll result — the target number — 
that an opponent needs to achieve to hit your character with an attack 
targeting that particular defense:
 Fortitude defense: This measures your character’s ability to withstand
attacks against his health or physical endurance, such as poison, dis-
ease, and effects that might knock him down or shove him around.
 Reflex defense: This reflects your character’s ability to react quickly
enough to avoid area attacks such as breath weapons and fireball spells,
or to evade attacks such as pit traps and falling boulders.
119
Chapter 10: Defining Your Character

 Will defense: This defense measures your character’s resistance to
mental influence and mental-attacking magical effects, such as psionic
attacks and illusion spells.
 Armor Class (AC): This represents how hard it is for opponents to hit
your character in physical combat. 
Each of your character’s defense scores begins at 10 and is improved by your
level modifier and an ability score modifier relevant to that type of defense,
like so:
Defense = 10 + 1/2 level + ability modifier (+ armor bonus for Armor
Class)
The abilities that apply vary for each of your character’s defenses. Each
defense allows you to add the better ability modifier of two different abilities,
as follows:
 Fortitude defense: Add the better of your Strength or Constitution
modifiers
 Reflex defense: Add the better of your Intelligence or Dexterity
modifiers
 Will defense: Add the better of your Wisdom or Charisma modifiers 
 Armor Class: Add the better of your Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers
(but only if you aren’t wearing heavy armor)
For example, Regdar is a 1st-level fighter with Strength 18 (+4), Constitution
14 (+2), Dexterity 13 (+1), Intelligence 10 (+0), Wisdom 12 (+1), and Charisma
11 (+0). He wears scale armor (+7 armor bonus) but doesn’t carry a shield,
because he prefers to fight with a greatsword, which requires both hands. His
defenses are
 Fortitude defense: 14 (10 + 4 for his Strength modifier)
 Reflex defense: 11 (10 + 1 for his Dexterity modifier)
 Will defense: 11 (10 + 1 for his Wisdom modifier)
 Armor Class: 17 (10 + 7 for his scale armor; he doesn’t add his Dexterity
modifier because scale armor is heavy armor)
Fighters gain a +2 bonus to Fortitude defense, so Regdar’s Fortitude defense
is a little better than shown here. (It goes up to 16.) Most classes grant a
bonus to one or more defenses. Your race and feat selection may influence
your defenses, too. For example, humans have a racial ability that adds +1 to
Fortitude, Reflex, and Will defense, so Regdar’s defenses are actually a bit
120
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

higher than shown in the preceding list when the final calculation is made —
counting the class and racial bonuses, they’re Fort 17, Ref 12, Will 12, AC 17.
Finally, as your character defeats monsters and wins treasures, he may find
magic items that improve his defenses even more!
Speed
A character’s speed shows how far the character can move (as measured 
in 5-foot squares on a battle grid) in a single move action. Your character’s
speed is determined by his or her race and by the type of armor that he or
she is wearing. Most characters have a speed of 6, or 5 if they wear heavy
armor. Elves have a speed of 7 (they’re quick!), and dwarves have a speed 
of 5 — but dwarves aren’t slowed down by wearing heavy armor.
Action points
Action points are special resources that you can spend to gain an extra
action in your turn. For example, you might move, use an attack power, and
then spend an action point to use another attack power — all in the same
round! Normally you begin each day with 1 action point. When you spend it,
it’s gone for the day, but as you adventure, you may earn additional action
points.
Basic attacks
Your character sheet provides space to record your character’s basic attack
options — the attacks he or she uses when he or she isn’t using a specific
attack power. Most characters carry one or two melee weapons and a ranged
weapon of some kind. Record the attack bonus for each weapon your charac-
ter might use. Remember that, when attacking, you make an attack roll with a
d20 and add your attack bonus to try to get a result that’s equal to or greater
than your target’s AC.
Your character’s attack bonus and damage dealt with a melee weapon is
determined as follows:
Attack bonus (melee weapon) = level modifier + Strength modifier +
weapon proficiency bonus + class or feat bonuses (if any)
Damage (melee weapon) = base weapon damage + Strength modifier +
class or feat bonuses (if any)
121
Chapter 10: Defining Your Character

The weapon proficiency bonus and base damage are characteristics of the
weapon; see the weapon chart in Chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook. For
example, Regdar’s basic attack bonus with his greatsword is +8 = level modi-
fier +0, Strength modifier +4, +3 for being proficient with the greatsword, and
+1 for the fighter class feature Weapon Talent. The greatsword deals 1d10
damage, + 4 for Regdar’s Strength bonus. 
You can calculate your character’s attack bonus with a ranged weapon as 
follows:
Attack bonus (ranged weapon) = level modifier + Dexterity modifier +
weapon proficiency bonus – range penalty
The range penalty exists only when your character is attacking at long range
for that ranged weapon; it’s simply a –2 on your attack roll. The weapon chart
in Chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook shows the long range and maximum
range for all ranged weapons.
For example, Lidda’s attack bonus with her shortbow is +6 = level modifier
+0, Dexterity modifier +4, and +2 for being proficient with the shortbow. The
shortbow has a range of 15/30 squares; if Lidda shoots at a target 16 to 30
squares (80 to 150 feet) away, she takes a –2 penalty on her attack.
Every weapon brings its own statistics to the table, and you should record
these on your character sheet as well. A weapon has a damage rating that
tells you what die (or dice) to roll to deal damage after a successful attack. In
general, high-accuracy weapons deal a little less damage than low-accuracy
weapons, so when choosing your character’s weapons, you should decide
whether you want to hit more often or hit harder.
Usually, you’ll use an attack power instead of a basic attack. Basic attacks
tend to come up in three common circumstances: when you use the charge
action, when you make an opportunity attack, and when enabled by another
character’s use of a power that grants extra attacks. 
Skills
Every character has some amount of aptitude in talents ranging from
Acrobatics to Thievery. (You can find the complete list of skills on your 
character sheet.) Skills aren’t often very useful in combat, but they’re great
for solving other types of challenges — for example, climbing a cliff, bluffing
your way past a guard, or puzzling out an arcane mystery.
122
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Depending on your character class, your character begins play with training
in three to six skills. In addition, humans begin with one extra skill. The class
description provides a list of skills you can choose from. In addition, your
class may specify one or more skills that your character is automatically
trained in. For example, wizards are automatically trained in Arcana, and they
choose three other trained skills from the following list: Diplomacy,
Dungeoneering, History, Insight, Nature, and Religion.
Every skill is based on one of your character’s six ability scores. For example,
the key ability for the Acrobatics skill is Dexterity, whereas the key ability for
Heal is Wisdom. Your character’s skill check bonus for each skill is
Skill bonus = level modifier + ability modifier (+5 if trained) – armor check
penalty (if any)
The armor check penalty applies only to a few skills such as Acrobatics or
Stealth, and only if your character wears armor that actually imposes a
penalty; see Chapter 17 for details. It’s harder for your character to be
stealthy when wearing 40 pounds of iron!
For more information on skills, see Chapter 16.
Feats
Feats provide characters with special edges or improve existing abilities 
in meaningful ways. A character gains a feat at 1st level and at every even-
numbered level as he or she advances. Human characters gain a bonus feat 
at 1st level, so you get to select two feats when creating a human character.
In addition, certain classes gain bonus feats.
Jot down the name of the feat or feats you select on your character sheet, as
well as a brief description of the benefit it provides or the page number of the
Player’s Handbook where you can look up the details when you need to.
For more details about feats, see Chapter 15.
Race and class features
Your character’s race and class provide certain special abilities. Record these
in the appropriate section on the character sheet. 
For more information on racial features, see Chapter 12. For more information
about class abilities, see Chapter 11.

Chapter 10: Defining Your Character

Powers
The powers section of the character sheet is where you record the various
powers your character knows. After character class, your selection of powers
is the most important part of your character — these are what you use to
defeat monsters and overcome obstacles. You can get by with basic attacks,
but pretty much any power you know is better than a basic attack.
Powers come in four basic varieties:
 At-will powers: These are weak attacks that are never exhausted. A 1st-
level character begins with two at-will powers.
 Encounter powers: These powers are stronger than at-will powers, but
you can use each encounter power only once per fight. Once you’ve
used it, it’s not available for the rest of that encounter. A 1st-level char-
acter begins with one 1st-level encounter power.
 Daily powers: These are the best attack powers, but you have to choose
the right moment to use them — when you expend a daily power, you
don’t get it back for the rest of the day. If your character still has a lot of
dungeon-delving to do before he or she can rest, you might regret using
up daily powers too early. A 1st-level character begins with one 1st-level
daily power.
 Utility powers: These powers aren’t attacks but can often be quite
useful in a fight. Utility powers may be defensive tactics or spells, spe-
cial tricks for getting around the battlefield, opportunities to call on your
healing surges, or generally useful things like being able to turn invisible.
Depending on the specific power, you might be able to use it in every
fight as an encounter power, or you might be able to use it only once per
day as a daily power. Your character doesn’t gain any utility powers until
he or she reaches 2nd level.
Magic items
Record the magic items your character owns in the magic items section of
the character sheet. Most magic items fill body slots, and you can use only
one item in each slot at a time. For example, characters have a neck slot that
can be filled by either an amulet or a cloak. If you wear both an amulet and a
cloak, you must choose which one provides its magical benefits. (For more
about magic items, see Chapter 20.)
Some magic items contain powers that you can use. For items with daily
powers, you’re restricted in how many of those you can use in a day, 
depending on your character’s level.

For more about magic items, see Chapter 20 in this book and Chapter 7 in the
Player’s Handbook.
Other equipment
Characters need equipment, and adventuring gear of all kinds is available to
get your character through the toughest dungeons. List the equipment your
character hauls around in the spaces provided on the character sheet.
For more information about adventuring gear, see Chapter 17.
125
Chapter 10: Defining Your Character
Making informed choices
The rest of Part II walks you through the various
components of your character and gives you
the information and advice you need to make
decisions about character creation. Which
class is right for you? How should you distribute
ability scores? What feats and skills should you
select? What kind of gear should your charac-
ter carry around? These questions and more are
examined in Chapters 11 through 18. Take the
chapters one at a time, and by the end, you’ll be
ready to make informed choices throughout the
character-creation process.

C
haracters in a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game all share a thirst for excitement
and a need to adventure. They just have to explore the dark places of
the world and find increasingly difficult challenges with which to test them-
selves. Where characters differ is in the way they approach each adventure
and what knowledge and abilities they bring to the table. A character’s class,
in large part, determines this approach.
Your character’s class is his or her profession or vocation. The class you
select determines much of what your character can do in the game. Your
character’s combat prowess, powers, special abilities, skills, and other 
qualities are defined and given boundaries by his or her class.
When you’re creating a character, the class you want to play suggests where
you should assign ability scores and even hints at which races are most
appropriate to play. In all cases, however, these are only suggestions. D&D is
a game about choices and options, not restrictions. You can always play
against type if that better fits the concept you have for the character you
want to play.
Chapter 4 of the Player’s Handbook goes into greater depth on character
classes and benefits. Check it out after you read through this chapter.

Character Roles
Each character class in the game is designed to fit into one of four general
combat roles: controller, defender, leader, or striker. Battling fearsome mon-
sters and evil villains is one of the most common (and dangerous) challenges
your character faces in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, so every character
needs to be able to contribute to victory in a combat encounter. Characters
can do a variety of interesting things outside of combat too, of course, but
fighting is the bread and butter of most fantastic heroes.
Much like the players filling positions for a team sport, characters of different
roles have different jobs in combat. A baseball team wouldn’t be very good if
every player on the field were a catcher; similarly, an adventuring party isn’t
all that effective if every character is a wizard. An adventuring party needs
tough characters who can take damage and keep monsters away from less
robust party members and characters who can heal and protect their friends,
or else the wizards will get chopped to pieces by the monsters.
The controller
Controllers affect large numbers of enemies at the same time and usually
attack them from long range. They often hit several enemies at once with
powers dealing average damage — when you add it all up, controllers deal
the most damage of any character in the game. Controllers also excel at hin-
dering enemies by creating effects that slow them down, weaken them, con-
fuse them, or box them in behind dangerous obstacles. The wizard is an
example of a controller.
Because controllers are so good on offense, they have to pay for it in other
ways — in this case, their defense. Controllers have low hit points, lower
defenses, and can’t stand up to a lot of punishment.
128
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Bring what your friends need
When you’re choosing the class of your next
character, ask whether any of the four roles
(controller, defender, leader, and striker) aren’t
yet represented in the adventuring party your
character is joining. If the party currently
includes no defenders, you can help out every-
one by creating a fighter or a paladin. Does the
party already have two leaders? Maybe you
should create something other than a cleric or
a warlord. If the party mix is well-balanced
already, you can create a character for
whichever role you think you’d like the most.
Defenders and strikers are good choices for
beginning players.

Play a controller if you like the idea of blasting several enemies at a time from
a distance.
The defender
Defenders are tough. They have the highest defenses in the game and loads
of hit points. Their job is to stand at the front of the party and keep enemies
from getting to the rest of the characters. Wizards and other less-armored
characters might think of defenders as “meat shields,” but they don’t dare 
set foot into a dungeon without one or more defenders around.
To make sure monsters don’t ignore them or move by them, defenders usu-
ally have special abilities that keep monsters close by and punish enemies
that ignore them to attack other characters. Defenders don’t have much 
ability to attack at range, but their melee attacks are quite good. The fighter
is an example of a defender, as is the paladin.
Play a defender if you like being the toughest character at the table and
standing toe-to-toe with fearsome monsters. You’ll take a pounding in many
fights, but you’ll usually still be standing when the dust settles. Any other
character with a different role trying to handle that job would be toast — or
maybe even dinner for the monsters.
The leader
Leaders help the other characters to stay on their feet and fight better. They
inspire, heal, and support the rest of the party. All leaders have innate heal-
ing abilities and can give other characters opportunities to regain hit points
lost to enemy attacks. Leaders also have many powers that provide addi-
tional healing and protection to their allies. Sometimes the healing ability of 
a leader is all that stands between a party of adventurers and certain death.
Clerics and warlords are examples of leaders.
Leaders are reasonably tough and can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the
party’s defenders, but leaders have the weakest offense of any characters;
their attack powers tend to serve as “target designation” that help other
characters to hit affected enemies even harder.
Leaders don’t get to tell other players what to do; in the context of this 
character role, “leader” really means “healer, protector, and targeter.” Leader
powers support those functions.
Play a leader if you like helping out other players and like the idea of being
the glue that holds the rest of the party together.
129
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

The striker
Strikers excel at focused damage; no other character can deal out damage 
to single targets as fast as a striker can. They’re highly mobile and extremely
deadly. Strikers cooperate with defenders to take down enemies fast, or they
slip through enemy lines to take out important targets before disappearing
back into the shadows. Rogues, rangers, and warlocks are all examples 
of strikers.
Strikers need to get close to deal their damage, but they pay for it with
weaker defenses and fewer hit points. Sometimes strikers find themselves
fighting alone — if you’re going to slip through the lines to take down the
enemy boss, you’ll usually wind up with the monsters standing between you
and the safety of your friends. Consequently, strikers have abilities that allow
them to evade and escape from monsters they don’t want to fight so that
they can focus on the high-value targets.
Play a striker if you like hit-and-run tactics and dishing out lots of damage to
a single target at a time.
Class Descriptions
Each class description in the Player’s Handbook provides key information
about the class. Where should you put your best ability scores? How many
hit points does a character of this class have? What skills can this character
select? What weapons and armor can characters with this class use? What
powers are available to this class? What special class features do members of
this class possess?
All these questions are covered in the class descriptions. In the rest of this
chapter, we explore some of the answers as they relate to the four iconic D&D
classes — fighter, rogue, wizard, and cleric — so that you can decide which
one you want to play.
130
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
How many of each?
The D&D roleplaying game is built around the
idea that the typical adventuring party consists
of five characters of different roles. So, four of
the positions on the team are filled by a con-
troller, a defender, a leader, and a striker. The fifth
position we recommend is a second defender. If
your DM decides to run a six-character party, we
recommend that a second striker fill the sixth
position. Larger parties are possible, but they
require a lot more work on the part of the DM. 
In general, the game works best with four to 
six players (each playing a different character)
and a DM.

The fighter is the best class
Characters of the fighter class have the best all-around melee capability —
they can take damage and they can dish it out in close combat. Deciding to
play a fighter means that your character is going to have a lot of hit points for
his or her level, good melee attack powers, and a direct approach to game
play. That makes the fighter class particularly attractive to new players and
players who don’t want to deal with the intricacies of magic and rituals.
The fighter fills the defender role. Good armor, high hit points, and a high
number of healing surges allow the fighter to absorb punishment that other
characters have little hope of withstanding for very long. Fighters are profi-
cient in all simple and military weapons and most armor types, including
heavy armors like chainmail and scale. The fighter’s power choices are
almost all melee attacks, so the fighter is well suited to take the battle right 
to the monsters.
The two fighter builds described in the Player’s Handbook are
 Great Weapon Fighter: You want to deal the most damage in melee that
you can. You disdain a shield and use the biggest two-handed weapon
you can find — usually a greatsword, greataxe, or maul. Powers that deal
a lot of damage are good for you.
 Guardian Fighter: You want to be the toughest defender you can be. 
You use a heavy shield and fight with a one-handed weapon such as a
longsword. Your powers deal decent damage but are really good for
boosting your own defense and hindering your enemies’ actions.
131
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class
Character builds
Your character’s particular combination of abil-
ity scores, class, power selection, and feat
selection is sometimes referred to as a build. The
idea behind a build is to choose things comple-
mentary to each other; for example, you don’t
want to set Strength as your highest ability score
and then choose a lot of powers that use
Wisdom as the key ability. Fortunately, the 4th
Edition Player’s Handbook provides you with two
suggested builds for each character class to
help you avoid mistakes like that. For example,
the Player’s Handbook provides guidance for
creating a Great Weapon Fighter or a Guardian
Fighter. There are plenty of other ways to build
fighter characters, but these are very easy builds
that have a lot of support throughout the game
rules. You can find plenty of powers and feats
that work well with these two fighter builds.
Your character’s build influences the way you
allocate ability scores and your selections for
race, powers, feats, skills, and arms and armor.
We touch on these builds throughout Part II of
this book; but in this chapter, we concentrate 
on the four basic classes (fighter, rogue, wizard,
and cleric).

Characters of any race can be successful fighters, although the best race
choices for a fighter character are those that offer a bonus to Strength or
Constitution. Of the races described in this book, humans and dwarves make
the best overall fighters (although elves and halflings can be good Guardian
Fighters).
The Player’s Handbook offers additional player character races. Of the addi-
tional races, the dragonborn really takes to the fighter class thanks to a good
Strength adjustment. If you want to play a powerful melee-oriented fighter,
you might want to consider playing a dragonborn.
Abilities
If you decide to play a fighter, you should put your highest ability score in
Strength. Most fighter powers are based on Strength. A good Constitution
gives your character extra hit points and provides access to good feats for
big weapons such as axes or hammers. Dexterity helps your character’s
Reflex defense and gives you access to feats for swords, flails, shields, and
spears. Finally, a high Wisdom score helps your Will defense and boosts your
Combat Superiority class feature.
132
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Fighter class features
Class features are generally intended to provide a character with some built-
in ability to meet his or her role in an adventuring party. The fighter has three
class features:
 Combat Challenge: You can choose to mark enemies your fighter
attacks, whether or not the attack is successful. When an enemy is
marked, he takes a penalty if he attacks anyone other than your charac-
ter. You can also make an attack when an adjacent enemy shifts away
from your fighter or attacks someone else. Combat Challenge, therefore,
makes enemies fight you instead of your friends. Because your character
is a defender, this is exactly what you want the monsters to do.
 Combat Superiority: Your opportunity attacks are especially dangerous.
You can add your Wisdom modifier to any opportunity attacks you
make, so this class feature rewards you for having a high Wisdom score.
 Weapon Talent: Choose whether your character is a one- or two-
handed weapon user. (Usually, Great Weapon Fighters favor two-handed
weapons, and Guardian Fighters prefer one-handed weapons so they 
can use a shield.) You gain a +1 to attacks with weapons of the type you
choose. Because your fighter will almost always attack that way, this
ability is pretty much a free +1 on every attack roll you ever make.
Hit points and healing surges
The fighter begins with hit points equal to 15 + his or her Constitution 
score. Every level thereafter, the fighter gains 6 more hit points. If you like to
play a character with a lot of hit points, you can’t do better than the fighter
class. The fighter also has a lot of healing surges available (9 + Constitution
modifier), which means the fighter can be healed over and over again in the
course of a day of adventuring.
Skills
You won’t be playing a scholar when you play a fighter. Fighters have a 
small selection of class skills. The class skills most important to a fighter are
Athletics, Endurance, and Intimidate. Athletics includes climbing, jumping,
and swimming — the day may come when your character’s life depends on
making a spectacular leap or scaling a cliff.
Fighter powers
Fighter powers are called exploits. A 1st-level fighter knows two 1st-level at-
will exploits, one 1st-level encounter exploit, and one 1st-level daily exploit.
All these are melee attacks. As your fighter gains levels, he gains the opportu-
nity to learn a few powers that aren’t melee attacks, but melee attacks remain
the fighter’s bread and butter throughout his career.
133
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

A number of higher-level fighter exploits feature special effects based on 
the weapon your character uses, so keep your eyes peeled for power choices
that reward your character’s weapon choice. For example, the 3rd-level
encounter exploit crushing blow allows you to add your Constitution modifier
to damage if your character is wielding an axe, a hammer, or a mace.
The rogue is the best class
The rogue relies on stealth, sneak attacks, and mastery of skills to get to 
the center of a dungeon and back again. Rogues come in all varieties, from
the swashbuckler to the expert spy who uses craftiness and a silver tongue
to accomplish the nearly impossible. Although quite capable in combat, a
rogue’s job in any adventuring group is to also be versatile and resourceful. 
A rogue usually has a trick up his or her sleeve to get the team out of any
jam. Need a lock opened? Need a trap disarmed? Need to sneak past the
sleeping dragon? The rogue is the character for the job.
In combat, rogues are strikers. They’re very, very good at dealing a lot of
damage to one enemy at a time. As you might expect, they don’t have the
staying power of fighters in pitched battles — but rogues have a knack for
getting out of scrapes and choosing their moment to shine. They prefer to
make opportunistic strikes from the shadows, use hit-and-run attacks, or rely
on ranged weapons to attack without exposing themselves to undue danger.
Rogues favor light armor and light weapons. They’re proficient in leather
armor and place their trust in agility and wits instead of shields or iron. Their
weapons are small, easy to hide, and quick to draw — the dagger, the short
sword, the hand crossbow. Precision is more important than power.
The two rogue builds in the Player’s Handbook are
 Brawny Rogue: You prefer offensive powers and are willing to trade
some defense in order to deal more damage. You rely on your sneak
attack class feature and favor powers that reward a good Strength score.
 Trickster Rogue: You prefer powers that misdirect and deceive your
foes. You can deal plenty of damage, but you prefer powers that leave
you with an easy escape route; striking and moving away is better than
dishing out a little more damage. Powers that reward a good Charisma
score work well for you.
All races make decent rogues, so a rogue character can be created using 
any of the D&D races. Of the races described in this book, halflings and 
elves make the best rogues due to their natural Dexterity bonus. Humans 
also make decent rogues, especially because of the extra skill that human
characters begin play with. (See Chapter 12 for more on races.)
134
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

The Player’s Handbook offers additional player character races. Of the 
additional races, the tiefling makes an excellent Trickster Rogue due to her
bonus to Charisma and her racial skill bonuses to Bluff and Stealth.
Abilities
If you decide to play a rogue, you should put your highest ability score in
Dexterity. Almost all your powers use Dexterity attacks, and a high Dexterity
score also helps out your character’s Reflex defense and Armor Class. A 
good Strength score helps your character’s Fortitude defense and improves
many of the powers important to the Brawny Rogue build. Likewise, a high
Charisma score provides your character with a good Will defense and is 
very useful for many powers in the Trickster Rogue build.
Rogue class features
A rogue’s class features boost his or her damage output, as you would expect
from a striker. These include
 First Strike: At the start of each encounter, a rogue has combat advan-
tage against any enemy who hasn’t acted yet. This means that you get
your sneak attack bonus damage (see the Sneak Attack bullet in this list)
against enemies whose initiative you beat. (This means that the
Improved Initiative feat is very good for you!)
 Rogue Tactics: Choose whether you want to add your Strength bonus 
to sneak attack damage (see the Sneak Attack bullet), or your Charisma
bonus to Armor Class against opportunity attacks. The Brawny Rogue
build prefers the former, and the Trickster Rogue build prefers the latter.
 Rogue Weapon Talent: Your rogue is especially good with daggers and
shuriken, weapons that otherwise aren’t very dangerous. You gain a +1
bonus on attacks with daggers, and you deal 1d6 damage with shuriken
instead of 1d4 damage.
 Sneak attack: The rogue is naturally a master of sneak attacks (attacks
made from hiding or when the rogue’s opponent has his or her attention
focused elsewhere). If you have combat advantage over your foe and
you’re using a light blade, a crossbow, or a sling, you deal 2d6 bonus
damage on a successful attack, in addition to the attack’s normal
damage. The easiest way to gain combat advantage over a foe is to 
beat his initiative roll at the start of the fight (see the preceding First
Strike bullet) or to flank an enemy with the help of one of your friends
(defenders are especially good at this).
Hit points and healing surges
A 1st-level rogue begins with a number of hit points equal to 12 + his or her
Constitution score. Each level after 1st, the rogue gains 5 more hit points. 
A rogue doesn’t have very many healing surges — only 6 + Constitution modi-
fier. When playing a rogue, remember that you’re not a defender, and you’d
rather not be around when the monsters get their turn.
135
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

Skills
As a rogue, you’re a jack-of-all-trades. You have more skills at your disposal
than any other character, and those skills are often useful in dangerous 
situations. All rogues are trained in Stealth and Thievery. In addition, a 
rogue begins play with skill training in four additional skills. Want to be an
expert dungeon delver? Choose Acrobatics, Athletics, Dungeoneering, and
Perception. Want your rogue to be the man (or woman) of a thousand faces, a
master impersonator? Then choose Bluff, Insight, Perception, and Streetwise
instead. If you like to play a character with a lot of skills, you can’t do better
than the rogue class.
Rogue powers
Rogue powers are called exploits. (Like the fighter’s powers, they’re derived
from the martial power source.) A 1st-level rogue knows two 1st-level at-will
exploits, one 1st-level encounter exploit, and one 1st-level daily exploit. The
powers available to you are a mix of melee and ranged attacks; it’s a good
idea to make sure you choose at least one of each. Many rogue powers
require your character to wield specific weapons (usually light blades), so
keep that in mind before you decide to abandon the dagger or short sword in
favor of something bigger.
The wizard is the best class
Select the wizard class for your character if you want to play an arcane spell-
caster. If calling forth magical energy, shaping it into powerful spells, and
unleashing those spells upon monsters and villains appeals to your sense of
play, the wizard class is the one for you.
The wizard is a controller. Wizards can deal with multiple enemies at a time
because most of their powers cover a broad area or target several foes at
once. Want to be an offensive powerhouse? Select spells that deal damage.
Want to be more subtle in your spellcasting? Choose spells that hinder
enemy movement or trap your foes in dangerous terrain. Almost all of a
wizard’s spells deal some amount of damage, so even if you decide to special-
ize in keeping the monsters immobilized through magic, you’ll still be con-
tributing to wearing down their hit points. The wizard has outstanding
ranged attack ability and hits monsters hard from a long ways off — which is
good, because the wizard has low hit points and mediocre defenses. You
don’t want to let the monsters get close!
Wizards are proficient only in cloth armor — the weakest armor there is.
They avoid damage by staying away from attackers and using defensive
powers such as shield or invisibility when they can’t quite stay out of reach.
Their weapons are an afterthought — the dagger and the quarterstaff.
Wizards disdain physical attacks and use their arcane powers in all but the
most desperate of circumstances.
136
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

The two wizard builds in the Player’s Handbook are
 Control Wizard: You prefer powers that hinder enemies first and
damage them as a secondary function. For your arcane implement (see
the “Wizard class features” section, later in this chapter), you prefer 
the orb or the staff.
 War Wizard: You like powers that deal as much damage as possible. If
they happen to inflict some controlling effects on your enemies, so much
the better, but that’s not your priority. For your arcane implement, you
should choose the wand or the staff.
Wizards come from all character races, but some races are renowned for
their arcane inclination. Of the races described in this book, humans make
the best wizards, especially if they choose to take their ability score bonus 
in Intelligence. (See Chapter 12 for more on races.) Elves don’t have an
Intelligence bonus, but they do gain Dexterity and Wisdom bonuses, which
are useful secondary scores for wizards.
Of the character races in the Players Handbook not discussed in this book,
eladrins and tieflings also make exceptional wizards due to their favorable
ability score modifiers.
Abilities
If you decide to play a wizard, you should put your highest ability score 
in Intelligence. Almost all your wizard powers use Intelligence attacks, 
and wizards are offensively minded characters; hitting with your powers 
is absolutely crucial. A good Intelligence score also helps improve your
Reflex defense and Armor Class. Other important abilities for wizards include
Dexterity, which is useful for the War Wizard build and for powers that 
are about dealing damage; Wisdom, which helps your Will defense and is
useful for the Control Wizard build; and Constitution, which improves 
your Fortitude defense and hit points and offers defensive advantages for
either build.
Wizard class features
Most of the wizard’s ability to function as a controller in combat lies in the
various powers available to him. The wizard’s class features are really about
flavor more than function. These include
 Arcane implement mastery: Just like a fighter wields a sword, axe, or
flail, a wizard uses arcane implements — the orb, staff, or wand. Choose
one of these implements. The orb works well for the Control Wizard
build because it makes conditions you inflict with your wizard’s powers
last longer or makes it harder for saving throws to overcome these con-
ditions. The staff improves your defense and is good for either build.
The wand is best for the War Wizard because it increases your wizard’s
accuracy with damaging attacks.
137
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

 Cantrips: You gain several minor at-will spells you can use any time you
like: ghost sound, light, mage hand, and prestidigitation. None of these are
very useful in combat, but they’re handy for dungeon exploration.
 Ritual Caster: You gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat. The wizard
automatically has access to the ritual magic system, which includes a
variety of useful magical effects that mostly come into play outside of
combat.
 Spellbook: Unlike other characters, a wizard actually knows more
powers than he or she can use. A 1st-level wizard knows two daily
spells; at the beginning of each day, the wizard picks which of those
spells he or she will be able to use during the day. As the wizard gains
levels and new utility and daily powers, he or she can continue to add
“extra” powers to the spellbook, increasing the number of options 
available for the day’s adventuring.
Hit points and healing surges
A 1st-level wizard begins with a number of hit points equal to 10 + his or her
Constitution score. Each level after 1st, the wizard gains 4 more hit points.
The wizard has a number of healing surges equal to 6 + Constitution modifier.
As you can see, the wizard doesn’t have a lot of staying power — it doesn’t
take many hits to make a wizard fall down.
The wizard in the 4th Edition DUNGEONS & DRAGONS roleplaying game is tougher
than he used to be, but he still has the fewest hit points of any class in the
game and very few powers that work well against enemies who are up close
and personal. A wizard doesn’t want to get into a prolonged melee battle 
with any monster. The best way to play a wizard during a battle is to stand
back and use powers to attack from a distance. Let the defenders and strikers
get in close so that your wizard can take control of the battlefield from a 
distance.
Skills
The wizard has a fair selection of skills, especially knowledge skills. All 
wizards automatically begin with training in the Arcana skill, and they can
choose three others from a list including Diplomacy, Dungeoneering, History,
Insight, Nature, and Religion. Arcana is your most useful skill because it’s
very useful for ritual magic (see Chapter 20). Dungeoneering, Nature, and
Religion are useful for monster knowledge checks (see Chapter 16). The
wizard is supposed to be the smartest character in the party, so your charac-
ter ought to know something about nearly any monster or mysterious effect
your group encounters.
Wizard powers
A wizard’s powers are arcane in nature and are known as spells. A 1st-level
wizard automatically knows two at-will 1st-level spells. Magic missile is an
unusual spell in that it counts as a basic attack, so a wizard can use it any
138
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

time he or she would be allowed to make a basic attack. It’s one to look at
when choosing your at-will spells. In addition, the wizard knows one 1st-level
encounter spell and two 1st-level daily spells (but can use only one 1st-level
daily spell per day; see the Spellbook bullet in the earlier section, “Wizard
class features”). Most wizard powers are ranged or area attacks, but it’s a
good idea to select at least one power that’s a Close attack — unlike ranged
or area attacks, Close attacks don’t provoke opportunity attacks when you
make them. Someday, a Close attack might just save your bacon.
The cleric is the best class
The cleric is the class for you if you want to play a character who has a 
profound connection to a higher power. With divine powers, decent combat
prowess, and the ability to repel undead monsters, the cleric bolsters any
adventuring group. The cleric’s powers revolve around healing damage and
enhancing the abilities of other party members. These powers allow the
cleric to make everybody around him or her better.
The cleric is a leader. The cleric’s job in any adventuring group is to wield
divine prayers that provide a mix of offense, healing, and defense. By using
prayers on his or her teammates, a cleric can make a fighter more powerful, 
a rogue more deadly, and a wizard more effective. Prayers that are attack
powers often serve as “target designation” effects, granting all the cleric’s
allies a bonus to attack or increased damage against the foe the cleric 
singles out.
Clerics are trained to use all simple weapons and leather, hide, or chain
armor. They typically wield a mace in one hand and a holy symbol in the
other, switching between melee attacks and ranged powers as the encounter
demands.
The two cleric builds in the Player’s Handbook are
 Battle Cleric: You prefer to lead from the front ranks, standing shoulder
to shoulder with the party’s defenders. Your powers include a number of
good melee attacks and rely on Strength over Wisdom. Although you’re a
competent healer and have many ways to protect your allies with divine
powers, you’d rather use your powers to punish villains and defeat 
monsters.
 Devoted Cleric: You’re more defensively minded than the Battle Cleric
and often use your powers from the rear ranks of the adventuring group.
Your powers usually rely on Wisdom rather than Strength, and they
include many ranged effects. You place a higher value on safeguarding
your allies than beating the monsters down with your own attacks —
you contribute to the party’s offense by making everyone around you
fight better and by protecting them with your divine magic.
139
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

All races have clerics, so a cleric character can be created using any of the
D&D races. Of the races described in this book, humans make very good
Battle Clerics because they can choose a bonus to their Strength score,
whereas dwarves and elves make good Devoted Clerics because of their
Wisdom bonuses. (See Chapter 12 for more on races.)
All clerics choose a patron deity, church, or faith to which they devote them-
selves. In the fantastic world of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS roleplaying game,
this usually means choosing a mythological god from a pantheon of imagi-
nary deities. Clerics must choose deities compatible with their alignment; if
you want to play a good-aligned cleric, you can’t choose an evil or chaotic
evil deity for your character to follow. A cleric doesn’t automatically gain any
special abilities or advantages for choosing a deity. However, the choice
might affect how you spend your feats — some feats, known as divinity feats,
are keyed to a character’s patron deity.
The Player’s Handbook features a selection of sample deities that can be used
in any D&D campaign world. You can find these in Chapter 2. Pick a deity for
your cleric that corresponds with your character’s alignment. Check out the
various divinity feats in Chapter 6 to see whether any seem especially good
for your character.
Abilities
If you decide to play a cleric, you should set your highest ability score as
either Strength or Wisdom. If you’re creating a Battle Cleric build, choose
Strength — many of the cleric powers you’ll want to take are Strength
attacks. If your character follows the Devoted Cleric build instead, choose
Wisdom. Whichever way you go, the other ability should probably be your
second highest score. Charisma is useful for your Channel Divinity class 
feature. Remember that your character needs a respectable Dexterity or
Intelligence score for Reflex defense and Armor Class (if you don’t wear
heavy armor, anyway).
Cleric class features
Any leader needs to have access to potent healing powers, so the cleric 
class is built to provide good healing ability no matter what power selections
you make for your character. This is reflected in the cleric’s class features,
which include
 Channel Divinity: A cleric begins with a bonus power known as channel
divinity. Once per encounter, the cleric can use channel divinity to 
perform one of two special powers: divine fortune or turn undead.
 Healer’s Lore: A cleric gets to add his or her Wisdom modifier to the
number of hit points bestowed by any cleric power with the Healing 
keyword. For example, a cleric with a Wisdom score of 18 adds 4 points
to the amount of damage cured by any of his or her healing powers.
140
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

 Healing Word: Twice per encounter, a cleric can use the healing word
power. Basically, this power allows the recipient to use one of his or her
healing surges. This is the power that gives the cleric the ability to keep
allies on their feet and battling on against the monsters.
 Ritual Casting: Finally, the cleric gains the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus
feat. Like the wizard, the cleric automatically has access to the ritual
magic system, which includes a variety of useful magical effects.
Hit points and healing surges
A 1st-level cleric begins with a number of hit points equal to 12 + his or her
Constitution score. Each level after 1st, the cleric gains 5 more hit points.
Clerics have a good number of healing surges; they begin with 7 +
Constitution modifier per day. Overall, a cleric’s hit points are about as good
as a rogue’s.
Skills
All clerics begin with training in the Religion skill and then choose three
others from the following: Arcana, Diplomacy, Heal, History, or Insight. The
most important skills for a cleric are those with applications in ritual magic;
Arcana, Heal, and Religion come up the most often.
Cleric powers
Cleric powers are known as prayers and are divine in origin. A 1st-level cleric
knows two 1st-level at-will prayers, one 1st-level encounter prayer, and one
1st-level daily prayer. Of course, a cleric also has three additional encounter
powers in the form of his or her class features: Two uses of his or her healing
word power, and one use of a channel divinity power (either turn undead or
divine fortune).
Other classes
The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS roleplaying game features eight core classes. We
concentrate on the four most iconic classes for this book, but you should
know that other choices are available. Chapter 4 in the Player’s Handbook
details all these classes. Here’s a brief rundown so you know what else 
is out there:
 Paladin: The paladin is a divine defender who can stand in for the
fighter.
 Ranger and warlock: These two classes are strikers, like the rogue. The
ranger is very good with bows, whereas the warlock uses magical blasts
and curses against his or her foes.
141
Chapter 11: Choosing a Class

 Warlord: The warlord is a leader, like the cleric, but his or her powers
are martial instead of divine.
When you’re ready to try something different, take a look at these classes in
the Player’s Handbook. Additional classes such as bard, barbarian, druid, and
swordmage will appear in upcoming D&D sourcebooks.

Chapter 12
Picking a Race
In This Chapter
 Examining the fantasy races
 Picking the right race for the job
 Checking out other race options
N
o fantasy world is complete without a selection of mythical races to
join humans in the struggle against monsters and Evil with a capital E.
These distinct races usually have their own homelands, but everyone comes
together in the larger towns and cities. There, those with adventurous spirits
join up and head out to banish threats and undertake quests that might be
personal or world-altering in nature.
In this chapter, we look at the fantasy races available for use as player char-
acters in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. We concentrate on four of those
races — humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings — discussing the benefits
each brings to the table and why you’d want to play a character of that race.
You can play any race and class combination you want, but keep in mind that
some races have natural tendencies that enable them to perform better in
certain classes, as discussed in this chapter.
At the end of the chapter, we provide a quick overview of other races avail-
able in the D&D game.
Chapter 3 of the Player’s Handbook goes into greater depth on character
races and the benefits and disadvantages of each. Check it out after you read
through this chapter.
Humans
Humans in D&D worlds are more or less just like humans in the real world,
except stronger, more heroic and daring, and usually better looking. They
come in all the usual human shapes, sizes, and colors. They range in height
from about 5 feet to just over 6 feet tall. They reach adventuring age 

somewhere between their 16th and 20th birthdays. Human adventurers are
adaptable, flexible, and extremely ambitious. They tend toward no particular
alignment or deity, and they have a habit of championing causes and ideals
over people or places.
Play a human character if you want a lot of maneuverability for your charac-
ter as he or she advances in level. Humans gain an extra at-will power and an
extra skill and feat to reflect their racial tendency toward versatility and
capability for mastering new tasks.
Ability adjustments
A human character can excel in one ability score. After you’ve assigned the
ability scores you generated to your abilities, add 2 points to the ability score
of your choice. (It’s usually a good idea to add this bonus to the ability that’s
most important for your character’s class; see Chapter 13.)
Special traits
Humans have the following special traits:
 Humans start play with one extra feat at 1st level, choosing two feats to
begin play instead of one.
 Humans begin play with training in one additional class skill. For exam-
ple, a fighter normally begins with training in three skills, but a human
fighter begins play with training in four.
 Humans are naturally resilient and begin with a +1 bonus to their
Fortitude, Reflex, and Will defenses.
 Humans know one extra at-will power from their class. Normally charac-
ters know two at-will powers, but human characters know three at-will
powers at the start of play.
144
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
A word about gender
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS characters can be either
male or female. Many players make their char-
acters the same gender they are in real life, but
you’re free to make a character of the opposite
gender if you wish. Playing a male or female
character is a personal choice, and to keep it
that way, the game sees no difference in ability
scores, class choices, powers, skills, equip-
ment, and so on for characters of either gender.
In D&D worlds, female and male adventurers
are absolute equals.

Best class
Because humans can choose to add their racial ability score bonus to any
ability, they do equally well with all the classes. Humans are good at any
adventuring careers they set their minds to.
Dwarves
Dwarves are short and extremely broad, standing about 41⁄2 feet tall and
weighing about the same as much taller humans. Hailing from mountainous
kingdoms, dwarves excel at warfare, mining, and construction. Longer lived
than humans, dwarves have great patience and take pride in hard work done
well. Dwarf adventurers often seek quests that will bring honor to their clans,
respect from their friends, and treasure beyond their wildest imaginings.
Play a dwarf character if you want to focus on pure toughness. Dwarves are
often more comfortable underground than folk of other races and make for
good dungeon adventurers. If courage, loyalty, and a love of strong ale appeal
to your sense of heroics, the dwarf race is a good choice for you.
145
Chapter 12: Picking a Race

Ability adjustments
After you’ve assigned the ability scores you generated to your abilities, make
the following adjustments:
 Add 2 points to your dwarf’s Constitution score. Dwarves are stout and
tough.
 Add 2 points to your dwarf’s Wisdom score. Dwarves are exceptionally
strong-willed and observant.
Special traits
Dwarves have the following racial traits:
 Due to their size and build, dwarves have a base speed of 5 squares 
(1 square less than human speed). However, they retain this speed even
when wearing armor or carrying a heavy load.
 Dwarves have low-light vision, which means that they see in dim light as
well as humans see in bright light. They can’t see in the dark, however.
 Dwarves gain a +2 racial bonus on Dungeoneering and Endurance skill
checks.
 All dwarves are proficient with the throwing hammer and the warhammer.
 Dwarves are extremely stable. When an effect causes a dwarf to move —
for example, a pull, push, or slide effect — a dwarf moves 1 square less
than the effect specifies. If an attack would knock a dwarf prone, the
dwarf can make an immediate saving throw to remain standing.
 Dwarves are hardy. They receive a +5 racial bonus on saving throws
against poisons.
 Dwarves are extremely resilient. A dwarf can use his or her second wind
as a minor action instead of a standard action (see Chapter 7).
Best class
Dwarves are especially suited to the cleric class, thanks in large part to their
Wisdom bonus and their innate weapon training. The fighter class is also a
very good choice for a dwarf character. However, dwarves can excel at any
class. They are tough and competent wizards, although their lack of speed is
a bit of a drawback for the rogue class.
146
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Elves
Elves are slender and graceful, standing about 51⁄2 to 6 feet tall, with tanned
skin, hair that ranges from dark brown to mossy green, large, almond-shaped
eyes, and pointed ears. Elven homelands lie deep in the forests and wood-
lands, where the elves learn archery and woodlore. With a love for nature and
a talent for the arts, elves have a unique outlook on life. They are a people of
deeply felt but short-lived passions, quick to laugh but also quick to anger.
For elves, the call to adventure comes from an inborn wanderlust, though
they can become focused and relentless when a particular quest catches
their interest.
Play an elf character if you want to focus on quickness or ranged combat.
Elves have special abilities that make them indispensable for wilderness
adventuring. If playing a hauntingly beautiful, somewhat alien, and magically
inclined character appeals to you, consider selecting the elf race for your
character.
Ability adjustments
After you’ve assigned the ability scores you generated to your abilities, make
the following adjustments:
 Add 2 points to your elf’s Dexterity score. Elves are quick and graceful.
 Add 2 points to your elf’s Wisdom score. Elves are highly perceptive and
attuned to their surroundings.
Special traits
Elves have the following racial traits:
 Elves are fleet of foot and have a base speed of 7 squares.
 Elves have low-light vision, which allows them to see in dim light as well
as a human sees in bright light.
 All elves are proficient with the longbow and shortbow.
 Elves have keen senses and are renowned for their woodcraft. They gain
a +2 racial bonus on Perception and Nature checks.
 Elves help their allies to stay alert and tune in to their surroundings.
They grant non-elf allies within 5 squares of them a +1 bonus to
Perception checks.
147
Chapter 12: Picking a Race

 Elves have a knack for stepping in the exact right place. They ignore 
difficult terrain when they shift, which is often very helpful in moving
around dangerous battlefields.
 Elves have a special racial power called elven accuracy. Once per
encounter, as a free action, an elf can reroll one attack roll.
Best class
Elves make very good rogues and clerics, due to their Dexterity and Wisdom
bonuses. They are competent fighters, especially with the Guardian Fighter
build, and also do well as wizards — both the Battle Mage and Control 
Wizard builds are suited for elf characters.
Halflings
Halflings are about 4 feet tall, with slender, muscular frames and natural
quickness. Many halflings are nomads, river-folk who migrate with the sea-
sons, calling no land and all lands home. Clever and capable, cunning and
resourceful, halflings constantly seek ways to avoid boredom and compla-
cency. Although halflings often have a bit of thief in them, most follow their
curiosity and have learned how to get into and out of trouble better than any
of the other races.
Play a halfling character if you want to focus on stealth and skirmishing.
Halflings have special abilities that let them excel at avoiding danger. If curi-
ous, fun-loving, good-hearted scoundrels appeal to your sense of adventure,
consider selecting the halfling race.
Ability adjustments
After you’ve assigned the ability scores you generated for your abilities,
make the following adjustments:
 Add 2 points to your halfling’s Dexterity score. Halflings are quick, agile,
and athletic.
 Add 2 points to your halfling’s Charisma score. Halflings are plucky, 
likable, and friendly.
148
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Special traits
Halflings have the following racial traits:
 Halflings are Small creatures. Due to their size, halflings can’t use two-
handed weapons such as greatswords and halberds.
 Halflings gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics and Thievery checks.
 Halflings are naturally good at avoiding danger. They gain a +2 racial
bonus to AC against opportunity attacks.
 Because they let their curiosity overpower their sense of fear, halflings
gain a +5 racial bonus on saving throws against fear.
 Halflings have a special racial power called second chance. Once per
encounter as an immediate action after being hit with an attack, halflings
can force the attacker to reroll the attack. The attacker must use the
second roll, even if it’s lower than the first.
149
Chapter 12: Picking a Race

Best class
Halflings make outstanding rogues, especially Trickster Rogues. They are
good clerics and wizards, and can do pretty well as fighters — although they
make much better Guardian Fighters than Great Weapon Fighters.
More Races to Choose From
The Player’s Handbook features additional races for player characters. These
include the dragonborn (a big, strong race of warriors with draconic fea-
tures), the eladrin (a race of high elves from the supernatural realm of the
Feywild, and masters of arcane magic), the half-elf (a charismatic people who
combine human versatility with elven intuition), and the tiefling (a race
tainted by infernal influences long ago, but now free to choose their own 
destiny).
Beyond the core books, the D&D game is full of fantasy races suitable for use
as player characters. The FORGOTTEN REALMS Player’s Guide, for example, intro-
duces two new races that offer additional options for creating cool player
characters. Start by playing the races from the core books and then look for
new options with which to expand your play experience.
Check out www.dndinsider.com for an ever-expanding collection of races
to choose from. D&D Insider constantly previews material from upcoming

E
very DUNGEONS & DRAGONS character consists of a number of key statistics
that begin with the character’s ability scores.
Class, race, and equipment help to refine and develop a character concept,
but when you create a new character, you begin by determining that charac-
ter’s ability scores. The Player’s Handbook describes several methods for gen-
erating ability scores. We discuss two methods for determining ability scores
in this chapter: the standard array and the customizing scores approach.
In this chapter, we examine what the ability scores are used for and how to gen-
erate the best scores for the character you want to create. Afterward, we look
at the choices available and help you best assign ability scores to create the
character you envision — or at least make the character viable and fun to play.
You can find out more about ability scores and ability score generation 
methods in Chapter 2 of the Player’s Handbook.
How the Ability Scores Work
Each character has six abilities — Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma. Ability scores rate a character, painting a broad picture
of how strong, dexterous, and intelligent (and so on) that character is. Ability
scores form the foundation upon which a character of myth and legend grows.

Three of a character’s abilities are physical (Strength, Constitution, and
Dexterity) and three are mental (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma).The fol-
lowing list describes each ability and gives advice on which classes need a
high score in that ability:
 Strength (Str): This score gauges your character’s physical might. How
much equipment can he or she carry? Can he or she force open a heavy
door? Arm-wrestle a bugbear? Swing a greatsword effectively? Bash open
a locked chest? A strong character is better at melee combat than a
weaker one. Any fighter wants a high score in this ability, as do rogues
with the Brawny Rogue build and clerics using the Battle Cleric build.
 Constitution (Con): This number expresses your character’s overall
physical health and stamina. How long can he or she hold his or her
breath? How well does his or her body deal with physical damage? How
much punishment can he or she take before falling unconscious? These
are the types of things measured by your character’s Constitution score.
All characters want at least a decent score in this ability because of its
connection to hit points and healing surges, but it’s especially useful to
fighters using the Great Weapon Fighter build.
 Dexterity (Dex): This score measures your character’s physical reflexes
and agility. How good is he or she with a ranged weapon, such as a sling
or bow? Can he or she use speed and coordination to avoid being hit
and taking damage? Can he or she use skills that require a great deal of
hand-eye coordination? A dexterous character is better at ranged
combat than a less agile one. All rogues wants a high score in this ability,
as do wizards with the Battle Mage build and fighters using the Guardian
Fighter build.
 Intelligence (Int): This score gauges your character’s ability to learn, use
deductive reasoning, and predict enemy attacks. What does your charac-
ter know about the monster he or she is facing? The history of the dun-
geon? The uses for the arcane ingredients found in the necromancer’s
vault? A smart character is better at finding answers than a less intelligent
one. A character with the wizard class wants a high score in this ability.
 Wisdom (Wis): This score measures your character’s perception and
willpower. Does he or she notice the gnolls lurking in the shadows? Can
he or she hear the dragon breathing in the dark cave ahead? Does he or
she have the strength of will to withstand the vampire’s hypnotic gaze?
A wise character is better at taking advantage of insight and intuition
than a less wise character would be. All clerics want a high score in this
ability, and fighters with the Guardian Fighter build want a decent score.
 Charisma (Cha): This number represents your character’s personal mag-
netism, self-confidence, and physical attractiveness. Can he or she get
the castle guard to look the other way with convincing words or a well-
timed bribe? A charismatic character is better at being suave or subtle
when the situation calls for it than a less charismatic one is. A rogue
who chooses the Artful Dodger class features benefits from a good
Charisma score.
152
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

When you create a character, you generate ability scores and assign them to
the abilities as you see fit. How you assign the scores depends on what kind
of character you’re creating. If you’re making a wizard, for example, you
would assign a high score to Intelligence, whereas if you’re making a fighter,
you would assign a high score to Strength. (See Table 13-3, later in this chap-
ter, for more information.)
An average score is 10 or 11. Scores of less than 10 are below average, and
scores of 12 or better are above average. In general, ability scores range from
8 to 18 when you first create a character. The score provides a modifier,
either a bonus or a penalty that’s tied to certain types of actions in the game,
as described in Table 13-1. In general, ability scores relate to actions in the
following way:
 Low ability scores (9 and lower) provide penalties to actions they’re
associated with.
 Middling scores (10 or 11) have no effect on actions they’re associated
with.
 High ability scores (12 and higher) provide bonuses to actions they’re
associated with.

Remember the Core Game Mechanic (described in Chapter 1):
 Roll a d20
 Add a modifier (bonus or penalty)
 Compare the result to a target number
So bonuses (such as +1) are always better, because they help make your d20
result higher and increase the chance for success at a given action. Penalties
(such as –1) lower your d20 result and make the chance of failure more likely.
153
Chapter 13: Figuring Out Your Character’s Ability Scores

A low score in a key ability for your character class means that the character
faces difficult challenges doing what it is he or she is supposed to do; a high
score for a key ability is often crucially important.
In the following list, we describe each of the six abilities and their effects on
character actions in the game:
 Strength (Str): The modifier provided by the character’s Strength score
is applied to basic melee attacks and damage rolls, attack and damage
rolls with Strength-based powers, Fortitude defense, and physical skill
checks such as Athletics. Many fighter and cleric powers are based on
Strength.
 Constitution (Con): The character’s Constitution score is added to his or
her 1st-level hit points (determined by character class). The Constitution
modifier is also added to number of healing surges a character can use
per day, Fortitude defense, and skill checks such as Endurance.
 Dexterity (Dex): The modifier provided by the character’s Dexterity
score is applied to basic ranged attacks and damage rolls, attack and
damage rolls with Dexterity-based powers, Reflex defense, Armor Class
(if not in heavy armor), and to Dexterity-based skill checks such as
Acrobatics or Thievery. Many rogue powers are based on Dexterity.
 Intelligence (Int): The modifier provided by the character’s Intelligence
score is applied to attack rolls and damage rolls with Intelligence-based
powers, Reflex defense, Armor Class (if not in heavy armor), and
Intelligence-based skill checks such as Arcana. Most wizard powers are
based on Intelligence.
154
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Pairing up defenses
You may have noticed that Fortitude defense,
Reflex defense, and Will defense come up
under two ability scores each. That’s because
you determine your character’s defenses by
using the best score in a pair of ability scores.
Your character’s Fortitude defense is improved
by the better of the Strength or Constitution
modifiers; your character’s Reflex defense (and
Armor Class, as long as he or she isn’t wearing
heavy armor) by the better of the Dexterity 
or Intelligence modifiers; and your character’s
Will defense by the better of the Wisdom or
Charisma modifiers. For example, if your char-
acter is a brilliant but clumsy wizard with a
Dexterity of 8 and an Intelligence of 20, you get
to add +5 to the Reflex defense and Armor Class
because the ability modifier for a score of 20 is
+5. Clearly, your character is much better at
analyzing enemy attacks than she is at leaping
nimbly out of the way, but however the wizard
does it, she’s a slippery target!

 Wisdom (Wis): The modifier provided by the character’s Wisdom score
is applied to attack and damage rolls with Wisdom-based powers, Will
defense, and Wisdom-based skill checks such as Heal and Perception.
Many cleric powers are Wisdom-based.
 Charisma (Cha): The modifier provided by the character’s Charisma
score is applied to attack and damage rolls with Charisma-based
powers, Will defense, and Charisma-based skill checks such as Bluff or
Intimidate. A good Charisma modifier improves the effectiveness of
some rogue and cleric powers.
Generating Ability Scores
Some people approach the game knowing exactly what kind of character they
want to create and play. Others prefer to generate their ability scores first,
see what they get in the way of bonuses and penalties, and then create the
best character they can around those scores. Either way, at some point early
in the process of creating your character, you need to figure out what your
character’s ability scores are. Check with your Dungeon Master to see
whether he or she has a preferred method for determining ability scores. In
the following sections, we examine two popular methods — the standard
array and the customized score method — and we discuss how to get the
most out of them when creating a new DUNGEONS & DRAGONS player character.
The standard array
You can use a standard array to generate ability scores. This method pro-
vides a solid group of set numbers that you can assign as you see fit. That’s
right — the standard array always uses the same numbers. You have more
control with this method because you always know exactly what scores
you’re going to get. The standard array provides a set of numbers that com-
bines decent bonuses with two average scores thrown in for good measure.
The standard array looks like this:
16, 14, 13, 12, 11, and 10
The benefits of using the standard array are speed and consistency. This set of
scores allows you to quickly create a character that has at least a decent score
(a score that produces a bonus) in every ability important to the class you
want to play. The disadvantages are that you don’t have the possibility of gen-
erating a score of 17 or higher, as you do with the customizing scores method.
155
Chapter 13: Figuring Out Your Character’s Ability Scores

When you’re in a hurry or when you want to guarantee a selection of bonuses
so you can better create the character concept you have in mind, go with the
standard array. We used the standard array to create all the ready-to-play
characters in Part I.
The customizing scores method
Customizing your ability scores is more complicated than using the standard
array, but it gives you a wider mix of scores while providing comparable
results. With this method, you can build a character that’s really good in one
score at the cost of having average scores in the other five.
To use this method, start with these six scores:
8, 10, 10, 10, 10, and 10
You have 22 points to spend on improving these numbers. The cost to raise a
number is shown in Table 13-2.

Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Racial ability adjustments
Every race provides a bonus to one or two 
ability scores. An elf, for example, gets a +2
Dexterity and a +2 Wisdom. Apply racial ability
adjustments after you determine your charac-
ter’s scores using one of the methods described
in the sections “The standard array” and “The
customizing scores method.”

Here are some sample scores generated using this method:
14, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13
15, 15, 13, 12, 11, 10
16, 16, 12, 11, 11, 8
17, 14, 12, 11, 10, 10
18, 14, 11, 10, 10, 8
Assigning Ability Scores by Class
For every class, certain abilities are more important than others and provide
a key to a character’s success. We define these important abilities for each
class in Table 13-3. For each class, we show where to place the highest score
(++), the second- and third-best scores (+), and the remaining scores (–). The
two different recommendations for each class are based on the builds pre-
sented in the Player’s Handbook. You don’t have to arrange your scores this
way, but it’s the easiest way to create an effective character.
157
Chapter 13: Figuring Out Your Character’s Ability Scores
Improving ability scores
Your character begins play with a heroic set of ability scores, and they get better as your charac-
ter advances in level. When your character reaches 4th level, you can add +1 to two different
scores of your choice. For example, if your character is a fighter, you might decide to increase his
Strength score by 1 and Constitution score by 1. You get to do this again at 8th level, 14th level, 18th
level, 24th level, and 28th level (pick the same or different scores — it’s up to you). In addition, your
character gains +1 to all ability scores when he or she reaches 11th level, and again at 21st level.
If you’re playing a fighter created using the standard array, you may choose to advance his ability
scores as follows:
1st level: 16 Str, 14 Con, 12 Dex, 11 Int, 13 Wis, 10 Cha
11th level: 19 Str, 17 Con, 13 Dex, 12 Int, 14 Wis, 11 Cha
21st level: 22 Str, 20 Con, 14 Dex, 13 Int, 15 Wis, 12 Cha
28th level: 24 Str, 22 Con, 14 Dex, 13 Int, 15 Wis, 12 Cha
As you can see, your character’s ability scores improve dramatically over the course of his or her
adventuring career.

Choosing Powers
In This Chapter
 Sorting out types of powers
 Gaining new powers as your character levels up
 Selecting fighter powers
 Selecting rogue powers
 Selecting wizard powers
 Selecting cleric powers
E
very DUNGEONS & DRAGONS character is basically a collection of powers.
The powers your character knows define what he or she can do. A skilled
fighter might know a deadly combination attack, a sweeping strike that
threatens several enemies at once, or an upending strike that knocks down
an enemy. A wizard might know spells that conjure up an icy blizzard, create
a streaking ball of fire, or grant invisibility for a short time. Each character
class has scores of powers available, but your character knows only a few of
them; deciding which powers suit your character best is a challenging test of
your character-building skills
In this chapter, we explain how your character learns powers. We tell you
about the various options available to you when you choose your character’s
powers. We also show you how your character’s build influences your selec-
tion of powers.
Each character class in the Player’s Handbook includes two basic builds. You
can choose any powers you like, so you don’t have to follow the builds — but
they are designed to be effective, iconic, and easy to use. Using a build helps
to ensure that your character’s ability scores, race selection, feat selection,
and power choices are all working together. We cover builds in Chapter 11,
and in this chapter we refer to them extensively.

Navigating through Powers
You can find a lot of different types of powers in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game. There are powers for fighters, powers for wizards, powers gained by
belonging to a particular race, powers characters can use whenever they
want, powers characters can use only once per day, powers that attack ene-
mies at range, powers that attack enemies close up, powers that don’t attack
anybody at all but add to your character’s defense or heal an ally instead . . .
let’s just say there are a lot of powers.
Fortunately, the powers aren’t thrown at you willy-nilly. The game has powers
organized in the following ways:
 Character class: The first organizing principle of powers is character
class. If you’re playing a fighter, you only have to worry about fighter
powers. As your fighter character gains levels, he learns new fighter
powers, not cleric or wizard or whatever powers. You need to concen-
trate only on a small part of the Player’s Handbook at a time.
 Level: Powers are organized into levels, ranging from 1 to 29. As your
character rises in level, he or she gains access to ever more impressive
powers. For example, a 1st-level wizard can cast a selection of 1st-level
spells, but a 9th-level wizard’s best power is a 9th-level spell.
You might notice that your character’s level correlates to the level of
powers he or she can access when he or she advances in experience
level; when a character reaches 9th level, he or she gets to choose 
a 9th-level power. Powers don’t “fill in” all available levels because there
are levels your character advances to that don’t give any new power
choices. For example, there are no 4th-level powers anywhere in the
game — characters don’t get to pick any new powers when they reach
4th level. They instead gain other benefits for achieving 4th level.
 Usage: Powers are also organized by their usage: at-will, encounter, or
daily. This refers to how often a character can employ that particular
power. For example, magic missile is an at-will 1st-level wizard power.
Any time your character spends a standard action, he or she can fire off
a magic missile. Encounter powers work once per battle; they take five
minutes to recharge, so as long as your character has a short break after
a fight, his or her encounter powers are available for use again. Daily
powers, on the other hand, work once per day. Your character must rest
for several hours in order to recharge a daily power he or she has used.
 Type: Powers are divided into attack and utility powers. Most of the
powers you choose as your character advances in level are attack
powers, but you also gain a number of utility powers over time. The
cleric’s cure light wounds prayer, the rogue’s tumble exploit, and the
wizard’s fly spell are all good examples of utility powers. Utility powers
160
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

are set at different levels from attack powers, so you’re never forced to
choose between picking up some highly useful utility power or your next
big attack power. Utility powers vary in usage: They can be at-will,
encounter, or daily powers.
For more information on how powers are sorted and used in play, check out
“Power Types and Usage,” at the beginning of Chapter 4 in the Player’s
Handbook.
Powers you don’t choose
In general, you get to choose from among several different powers each time
your character gains the ability to pick a power. However, sometimes your
character gains powers that you can’t choose — they’re just automatic for
your character. These include the following:
 Racial powers: Some character races grant powers — for example, an elf
character automatically knows the power elven accuracy. All elf charac-
ters can use that power.
 Class powers: Some character classes include powers. The best example
is the cleric class, which includes the healing word power. All clerics
gain healing word in addition to the powers they select normally.
 Paragon path: Your character’s paragon path provides an 11th-level
encounter power, a 12th-level utility power, and a 20th-level daily power.
These are locked into your paragon path selection; for instance, if your
character is a swordmaster, you get the swordmaster powers at those
levels. We look at the paragon path more in Chapters 18 and 22.
 Epic destiny: Your character’s epic destiny provides a 26th-level utility
power. Again, this is locked into your choice of epic destiny; whatever
the destiny offers at that level, you get.
161
Chapter 14: Choosing Powers
Using powers
To use a power in game play, you simply tell the
DM that your character is using a power. In
combat, you have to wait for your character’s
turn to come up (although some powers can be
used to interrupt an enemy’s turn). When you
use an encounter power, it’s expended for the
rest of that encounter. When you use a daily
power, it’s used up for the whole day. You can’t
refresh daily powers until your character has an
opportunity to rest. Usually, this means retreat-
ing from the dungeon and circling the wagons
for a time while your character recharges for
the next day.

 Magic items: Many magic items that your character finds during the
course of his or her adventuring career have powers, too. Depending on
your Dungeon Master, you may have the ability to choose the magic
items your character wields, or you might have to settle for whatever
your character finds in treasure hoards.
Learning new powers
When creating a 1st-level character, you get to select the following class powers:
 Two 1st-level at-will powers (For a human character, pick three.)
 One 1st-level encounter power
 One 1st-level daily power
The powers you select are determined by your class. If your character is a
rogue, you begin with rogue powers; if your character is a wizard, you begin
with wizard powers; and so on. In addition, your character may have a racial
power (such as elven accuracy) or additional powers determined by his or
her character class (such as the cleric’s healing word power). Human charac-
ters have the advantage of beginning with three 1st-level at-will powers
instead of only two. (That’s one of the human racial benefits.)
As your character gains experience levels, he or she gains additional powers.
For example, at 2nd level, your character gains one 2nd-level utility power; at
3rd level, one 3rd-level encounter power; and at 5th level, one 5th-level daily
power. Your character is gaining other benefits, too, but the opportunity to
choose new powers is one of the most interesting and useful parts of gaining
levels.
You can find character advancement and power acquisition in the table on
page 29 of the Player’s Handbook. Flag this page with a bookmark or sticky
note; you’re going to use it a lot!
Replacing powers
Eventually, you reach a point where instead of gaining a new power, you
replace one of your character’s old powers with a new one. For example, at
13th level, your character gains a new 13th-level encounter power, but you
must also choose one old encounter power to discard. Usually this is the
character’s 1st-level encounter power because it’s the lowest-level encounter
power your character knows. Low-level powers aren’t as good as higher-level
powers, so it makes sense to replace your character’s oldest powers first.
Your 13th-level character would, therefore, know encounter powers of 13th,
11th (the paragon path power), 7th, and 3rd level (after discarding the 
1st-level power), for a total of four known encounter powers.
162
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Daily powers are also replaced in this fashion. However, at-will powers never
get swapped out — there are only 1st-level at-will powers, and you never gain
access to new bins of at-will powers to choose from. Utility powers don’t get
replaced, either. You just keep adding those each time you hit a level where
you can choose one.
Choosing Fighter Powers
Fighter powers are derived from the martial power source, which means that
they’re the product of training, practice, and pure physical ability. (See the
sidebar on page 54 of the Player’s Handbook for more on power sources.)
They’re called exploits.
The great majority of fighter powers are melee attacks — attacks a fighter
makes against one or more specific enemies within reach of his or her sword
(or axe, or hammer, or some other melee weapon). Some fighter powers are
close attacks. Close attacks affect an area; for example, a power whose area is
listed as “Close burst 1” affects everything within 1 square of your character.
If a fighter is surrounded by four goblins, he or she gets to attack each one
with that power. However, if you want to attack monsters standing a long dis-
tance away, you must fall back to your basic ranged attack to shoot a bow or
throw a javelin. It’s not as effective as using a power, but sometimes that’s the
only way to get the job done.
Fighters care more about which weapons they’re using than any other char-
acter. A number of fighter powers have special benefits for using particular
weapons. That means you should decide which weapon your character uses
most before you begin choosing powers. If you decide that your character
favors axes, for example, you can keep an eye out for powers that reward axe
users, such as crushing blow or giant’s wake.
To begin choosing your fighter powers, the first thing you should do is settle
on your fighter build:
 Great Weapon Fighter: This type of fighter prefers offense to defense,
and so uses a two-handed weapon such as a greataxe, greatsword, or
maul. Your best powers are ones that deal high damage to one target or
attack multiple targets.
 Guardian Fighter: Your character prioritizes defense and crowd control
over pure damage, so he or she uses a one-handed weapon such as a
longsword, battleaxe, warhammer, flail, or spear, as well as a shield.
Powers that slow, immobilize, restrain, or slide enemies are good for
keeping your enemies close by you so they can’t get to your friends.
163
Chapter 14: Choosing Powers

To use the power selections in Tables 14-1 and 14-2, remember that your
fighter knows every power listed on the table for his or her character level,
plus the powers listed for previous levels. In other words, the lists are cumu-
lative; if you’re playing a 5th-level fighter, your character knows every exploit
listed for levels 1 through 5. However, at 13th and 15th level, you replace your
older powers with your new selections, as shown on the table.
Many fighter daily exploits have the special keyword of Reliable, which
means that if you miss with the attack, you haven’t actually expended the
power — it’s still available, and you can try it again in later rounds until you
do hit with it.
The Great Weapon Fighter
This might be the simplest character to play in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game.
All you have to do is move your character next to the monsters and hit them
with the best attack you can. Repeat until no more monsters are standing. For
purposes of choosing powers in Table 14-1, we assume that your character
wields a greataxe. If you choose a different weapon, you might want to
change a couple of your power selections.

* Keyed to your weapon choice; if you don’t use a greataxe, try a different power.
Your character’s 1st-level at-will powers are cleave and reaping strike. Both
allow you to add extra damage based on your Strength modifier. Use reaping
strike when you’re fighting a single enemy or enemies that are hard to hit;
even if you miss, you deal a little damage. Cleave is good when you’re fighting
multiple enemies, especially if those enemies aren’t hard for you to hit.
Your character’s encounter powers begin with spinning sweep. It doesn’t deal
a lot of damage, but if you hit, you knock your target prone — it’s always
handy to put your enemy on the ground. If you’d prefer more damage, choose
passing attack instead. At 3rd level, your character can learn crushing blow.
This power allows you to add your Constitution modifier to the damage you
deal, so it’s a great choice if you have a high Constitution score. Our recom-
mendation for your 7th-level encounter power is reckless strike. You take a
small penalty on your attack roll, but you deal excellent damage with this
power. Try to save it until you have combat advantage in a fight, so that the
attack penalty won’t hurt so much.
Your character’s 11th level encounter power is determined by the paragon
path you choose; see page 53 of the Player’s Handbook for more information
on paragon paths. (Iron vanguard and pit fighter work well for the Great
Weapon Fighter build.) When you gain your 13th level encounter power, you
reach the “cap” of four encounter powers, so you have to choose one of your
old encounter powers to replace. It’s time to scratch off your 1st-level spin-
ning sweep power and replace it with giant’s wake. Giant’s wake is like crush-
ing blow on steroids; in addition to waling the tar out of the enemy you hit,
you get to make a secondary attack against any enemies adjacent to the first
foe you attacked.
Your daily powers are brute strike (1st), dizzying blow (5th), and thicket of
blades (9th). Brute strike is just simple big damage against one target.
Dizzying blow is the same, but it also immobilizes your target. Thicket of
blades is similar, but its range is Close burst 1, so your fighter can attack
every adjacent enemy. At 15th level, replace brute strike with the exploit
dragon’s fangs — it’s just as good, and you can make two attacks instead 
of one.
165
Chapter 14: Choosing Powers

Because you’re mixing it up in just about every encounter, we recommend
utility powers that help you shake off the damage your character inevitably
collects. Save boundless endurance (2nd) until you’re in a battle that you
aren’t sure you can win; it’s a daily power, so after you use it, it’s gone until
your character can rest. On the other hand, unbreakable (6th) is an
encounter power, so make sure you use it during every fight! You might as
well use it the first time you get hit. At 10th level, into the fray doesn’t help
you avoid damage, but it’s an extremely useful encounter power that lets you
move a short distance as a minor action. Use this power to move up to a new
enemy after you drop a foe. Keeping monsters and villains under the threat of
your axe is what you’re supposed to do!
The Guardian Fighter
The Guardian Fighter is the thinking player’s fighter. Your Guardian Fighter is
tough as nails, armored from head to toe, and no matter what the enemies
do, they just can’t seem to get away from your character. Your fighter’s
powers are good melee attacks, but more important, they control enemy
movement and keep your foes from getting to your less protected allies.
Guardian Fighters are typically equipped with a heavy shield and a one-
handed weapon. For the purposes of Table 14-2, we assume that your weapon
of choice is the trusty longsword.

Daily: unyielding avalanche (replaces comeback strike)
* Keyed to your weapon choice; if you don’t like longsword, try a different power.
The Guardian Fighter’s at-will strikes are sure strike and tide of iron. Sure
strike provides a high-accuracy, low-damage attack for when you really need
to get an enemy’s attention. Tide of iron has the coolest power name ever,
and it’s also extremely useful. Tide of iron lets you push back an enemy and
move into its square — a great way to get your foe out of a doorway, shove it
away from an ally, or back it into a corner.
We recommend covering attack for your 1st-level encounter power. If you hit,
one of your allies adjacent to the foe can immediately shift by 2 squares. It’s
perfect for getting a less-defended ally out of danger. At 3rd level, your char-
acter learns dance of steel (have we mentioned that the Guardian Fighter has
some great power names?), which does decent damage and slows your
enemy. Come and get it, your 7th-level encounter power, might be the best
crowd-control power in the game; you pull all enemies within 3 squares adja-
cent to you, and whack each one when he, she, or it moves next to you. Your
character’s 11th-level encounter power is determined by your paragon path.
For the 13th-level encounter power, storm of blows is a deceptively good
attack. It doesn’t deal much damage, but you can attack up to three enemies,
shifting each time. It’s very handy for moving by several squares through a
furious battle to wind up exactly where you want to stand. However, if your
character happens to be using a hammer, anvil of doom is probably a better
choice. Either way, the 13th-level encounter power replaces covering attack.
For daily exploits, begin with comeback strike at 1st level. It’s not a very
strong attack for a daily power, but it lets you use a healing surge. The ability
to trigger your own healing surge is extremely handy for those occasional
battles when the party’s leader is incapacitated and can’t heal you. At 5th
level, crack the shell is useful because it helps the rest of your party hit the
creature you’re fighting. Use this one on a tough solo monster if you get the
chance. Shift the battlefield is your 9th-level daily exploit, and it’s a tactician’s
dream; not only do you make a decent attack against every foe adjacent to
you, you can then move each foe 1 square. Your 15th-level exploit replaces
comeback strike; we recommend unyielding avalanche. It isn’t much of an
attack, but it increases your defense and your ability to exert control over the
battlefield — and that is exactly what a Guardian Fighter is all about.
167
Chapter 14: Choosing Powers

Speaking of battlefield control, your utility powers offer more opportunities for
moving your allies out of dangerous situations. At 2nd level, get over here is a
move action that lets you slide one willing ally up to 2 squares to get him or her
out of harm’s way and into a better defensible position. Unbreakable (6th level)
is just as useful for the Guardian Fighter as it is for the Great Weapon Fighter;
use it in every battle. Finally, for your 10th-level utility power, try stalwart guard.
It’s usable only once per day, but it’s a minor action and it gives you the ability
to directly protect all nearby allies by increasing their AC and Reflex defenses.
Choosing Rogue Powers
Like fighters, rogues have martial powers. Their powers (also called exploits)
are acts of agility, training, and tricks they practice and study, with no magic
involved.
Rogue powers mix melee and short-range attacks. Many powers also include
some built-in mobility. Rogues can move around the battlefield like no one
else, which makes it relatively easy to set up for their big damage boost: the
sneak attack. The Sneak Attack class feature grants rogues bonus damage
when they attack with combat advantage, and one of the simplest ways to
gain combat advantage is to move to a flanking position against the target.
Weapon choice is almost as important to rogues as it is to fighters, although
in the rogue’s case, it’s about meeting a requirement rather than choosing 
an advantage. Many rogue powers require the rogue to wield specific
weapons — usually a crossbow or sling for ranged attacks, or a light blade for
melee attacks. (Light blades include daggers, short swords, and rapiers.) No
matter how much you might want to try out a dwarf rogue with a battleaxe,
it’s just a bad idea; too many of your powers won’t work. Stick with the clas-
sic rogue weapons.
To choose your rogue exploits, first determine which rogue build you’re
aiming for. Many powers work well for any kind of rogue, but you want to
make sure you don’t pick powers really intended for the other build.
 Brawny Rogue: Your powers tend to deal lots of damage. You aren’t partic-
ularly elusive, but you can be hard to corner simply because your powers
often stun or immobilize your targets; they can’t counterattack effectively
after your turn is over. For Rogue Tactics (see page 117 of the Player’s
Handbook), choose brutal scoundrel; it improves your Sneak Attack
damage. Choose rogue powers that your Strength modifier improves.
 Trickster Rogue: You’re more mobile and elusive than the Brawny
Rogue, but your powers tend to deal less damage. Many of your powers
are enhanced by a good Charisma modifier. You should choose artful
dodger for your Rogue Tactics class feature, which protects you against
opportunity attacks.
168
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Tables 14-3 and 14-4 show recommended power selections for your rogue
build. The lists are cumulative, so you know each power listed for your char-
acter level and the powers of all previous levels (unless your character is
high enough in level that you’ve actually replaced some of your old power
selections).
The Brawny Rogue
All rogues like sneak attack, but you especially like it if you’re playing the
Brawny Rogue, because your Brutal Scoundrel class feature allows you to
add your Strength bonus to sneak attack damage. Therefore, many of the
powers in this build are intended to help you get or keep combat advantage.
Make sure you choose Acrobatics as one of your trained skills because you
need it for some of the powers in this build.

Chapter 14: Choosing Powers

The Brawny Rogue begins with the at-will powers piercing strike and riposte
strike. Piercing strike is a good general-purpose melee attack because it tar-
gets your enemy’s Reflex defense. That’s almost always several points lower
than Armor Class, so it’s a highly accurate attack. Riposte strike is useful
because the creature you hit with it is strongly discouraged from attacking
you on its next turn — if it does, you gain an immediate attack against it. Use
piercing strike when the situation calls for offense, and riposte strike when you
want to be attacked less often.
Your first recommended encounter power is torturous strike, which is a
straightforward damaging attack. At 3rd level, you gain a power called topple
over. You get to add your Strength modifier to your attack with this power,
and a successful hit deals damage and knocks the target prone. The 7th-level
power we like best for the Brawny Rogue is cloud of steel. It’s a Close attack
that affects a very large area, so you could easily catch three or four enemies
with a single attack. Your character learns the encounter attack power for
your chosen paragon path at 11th level (see page 53 of the Player’s Handbook
for more on paragon paths). At 13th level, you replace torturous strike with
the unbalancing attack power. This power deals very good damage, improves
your opportunity attacks against the target, and prevents the target from
shifting out of its current square.
Easy target is your character’s 1st-level daily exploit. It’s especially useful
because it guarantees that the target will continue to grant combat advantage
to you (at least until it successfully saves). At 5th level, deep cut is a very
damaging power that targets Fortitude defense; don’t use it on very big or
strong opponents if you can help it. Your 9th-level daily exploit is deadly posi-
tioning. It deals fine damage and gives you the ability to move your opponent
just before attacking until the end of the encounter — again, an easy way to
set up sneak attacks. At 15th level, replace your easy target exploit with slay-
ing strike. This power deals good damage, but if the target is bloodied, it
deals extremely good damage. In fact, it’ll often kill a wounded enemy out-
right. Make sure you save this one for use against a bloodied opponent!
Although many interesting rogue utility powers are available, the Brawny
Rogue is all about gaining combat advantage, so tumble (2nd) and ignoble
escape (6th) are the first two recommendations. Both powers let you shift
your position by multiple squares as a move action, which is extremely useful
for flanking an opponent or getting away from enemies trying to box you in.
Shadow stride (13th) is also good because it lets you move and hide at the
same time.
The Trickster Rogue
The Trickster Rogue is happy to gain combat advantage and sneak attack
damage, but he or she specializes in making enemies look bad. Many of the
powers listed on Table 14-4 are designed to hinder or slow enemies; a rogue
170
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

of this build can often move or lure an enemy right into the path of another
character’s attack. Make sure you choose Bluff as one of your trained skills if
you’re a Trickster Rogue, because several of your powers require it.

Rogue at-will powers are some of the best in the game, and you begin 1st
level with two very good ones. Deft strike includes a move of 2 squares when
you use the attack, which makes it easy to get into position. Sly flourish
simply adds your Charisma modifier to the damage you deal with the attack,
so it’s the single most damaging rogue at-will power. Use sly flourish unless
the extra movement of deft strike would give you the chance to move into a
flanking position and gain combat advantage.
171
Chapter 14: Choosing Powers

Your character’s 1st-level encounter exploit is positioning strike. In addition to
dealing decent damage, this power lets you slide the target a few squares. Try
using this against an opponent that another character has dazed or slowed;
the affected creature won’t be able to get back into melee range and attack
you back. We recommend bait and switch for your character’s 3rd-level
encounter exploit; this power lets you switch places with your target and
shift several squares, which is extremely useful for getting out from behind
enemy lines and back to the safety of the rest of the party. For 7th level,
choose cloud of steel. It’s the best area attack available to a heroic-tier rogue.
Your character’s 11th-level encounter exploit is determined by your paragon
path, just as it is for any other class. At 13th level, replace positioning strike
with the encounter exploit tornado strike. It’s similar to positioning strike,
except you can attack at range or in melee, you can attack two targets instead
of one, and you get a free 3-square move after making the attack.
At 1st level, we suggest trick strike for your character’s daily exploit. You gain
the ability to slide the target each time you hit it, which gives you the ability
to set up your allies’ attacks against that foe. At 5th level, walking wounded
targets your foe’s Fortitude defense, knocks him prone on a hit, and slows
him for the duration of the encounter. Your 9th-level daily exploit is an
extremely good power called knockout; you render your target unconscious
with a successful hit. At 15th level, replace trick strike with bloody path.
Bloody path is a little hard to use because you need to run by as many ene-
mies as possible, but each enemy you run past swings at you and hits himself
instead. That’s worth the use of a daily power!
For utility powers, master of deceit (2nd level) allows you to re-roll a Bluff
check you don’t like. You can use Bluff checks to gain combat advantage or
give yourself a chance to hide, both of which can be very useful. Slippery
mind (6th level) is a useful defensive power that helps you boost your Will
defense once an encounter. At 10th level, we recommend shadow stride. The
ability to move and hide at the same time lets a rogue cause all sorts of trou-
ble both in and out of combat, and that’s what being a rogue is all about.
Choosing Wizard Powers
Wizards rely on arcane powers known as spells. These powers are extremely
diverse compared with the selections available to characters of other
classes. Want to play a fire wizard? Take a lot of fire spells. Want to play a
mind-bending enchanter? Take a lot of spells dealing with psychic damage or
that attack the targets’ Will defense. It’s really up to you.
172
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Wizard spells fall into two basic groups: high-damage low-control, or low-
damage high-control. All wizards can deal decent damage and hinder groups
of enemies with at least some of their spells, so it’s really a matter of which
you’d like your wizard character to favor. In a perfect world, you’d like to
have a few spells of each group in order to be ready for anything the Dungeon
Master throws at your party.
First, decide which build your wizard character is pursuing:
 War Wizard: A wizard whose spell repertoire is geared toward dealing
damage to enemies. The war wizard is the simpler wizard to play.
Choose a lot of high-damage, low-control spells. Find the spells that deal
the most damage and pick them.
 Control Wizard: A wizard who chooses spells that create general confu-
sion and frustration for the enemy and deal damage as a secondary
effect. Choose a lot of low-damage, high-control spells; any spells that
carry conditions such as restrain, slow, stun, or daze are good choices.
To use the spell selections in Tables 14-5 and 14-6, all you have to remember
is that your wizard knows every spell given on the tables here for his or her
character level, plus all the spells for all previous levels. In other words, the
lists are cumulative; if you’re playing a 5th-level wizard, your character
knows every spell in these tables for levels 1 through 5. (However, at level 13
and level 15 your new selections actually replace older spells.)
The wizard’s Spellbook class feature means that you actually pick two daily
spells when you get the opportunity to pick daily spells, and you acquire two
utility spells when you get the opportunity to pick utility spells. Each day,
you can decide which of those two powers your character prepares.
The War Wizard
The advantage of playing a War Wizard is that all your character’s efforts
directly contribute to the monster’s defeat. Your character’s spells (see Table
14-5) concentrate on reducing hit points, just like the fighter’s sword and the
rogue’s sneak attack. Everyone in the party is working toward the same goal,
which is to reduce the monster’s hit points to zero as fast as possible. The
disadvantage of playing a War Wizard is that you can’t delay or hinder mon-
sters, so you don’t mitigate enemy attacks as well as the Control Wizard
does.

Daily: blast of cold*, prismatic beams*

* These powers are in your wizard’s spellbook — you must choose which of the two listed powers
at that level to prepare each day.
Your wizard begins with the magic missile at-will power. It’s an accurate but
weak long-range attack. For the War Wizard, we recommend scorching burst
for your remaining at-will power. It lets you scorch a couple of enemies at
range, provided they’re standing next to each other.
Your recommended encounter spells are burning hands (1st), shock sphere
(3rd), and spectral ram (7th). Burning hands is a Close attack; you generally
don’t want to be in melee if you’re a wizard, but if you find yourself there
anyway, it’s important to retain good offensive options that won’t get you
killed. Shock sphere is a good medium-range attack power that covers a wide
area and inflicts lightning damage. It’s always a good idea to make sure your
174
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

attacks dish out two or three different damage types, because you don’t want
to be shut down when your wizard runs into monsters resistant to fire (or
whatever other energy your attack spells rely on). Likewise, spectral ram is a
good 7th-level choice because it gives you an attack that targets your ene-
mies’ Fortitude defense. If you’re fighting monsters with very high Reflex
defenses, it’s good to be able to strike at a different defense with your spells.
Your paragon path determines your 11th-level encounter power, but at 13th
level, you get to replace your old 1st-level burning hands spell with prismatic
burst, a long-range attack that also blinds the affected creatures for a short time.
Because of the wizard’s Spellbook class feature, you get to pick two daily
spells each time you reach a level where you pick daily spells. No other char-
acter class gets to do this. Your wizard knows two spells but must prepare
one of them for your day of adventure. At 1st level, we recommend preparing
acid arrow; it deals very good acid damage that can continue to sear the
target for several rounds. The 5th-level daily spell fireball is one of the iconic
spells in the game; it’s a long-range attack that affects a big area, dealing mod-
erate damage. Use it on large groups of weak monsters if you can. At 9th
level, prepare ice storm; it covers a big area and deals less damage, but it has
an excellent immobilize effect. When your character reaches 15th level,
replace one of your 1st-level spells with prismatic beams. Prismatic beams lets
you attack all three defenses of your targets at once, and it creates a variety
of nasty effects for the bad guys.
Your utility spells work just like your daily spells; you get to pick two each
time your character learns a utility spell, even though you have to choose
which of the pair to prepare for use each day. We recommend shield (2nd
level), dimension door (6th level), and blur (10th level). Your character is a
War Wizard, after all, so you want to favor powers that have immediate uses
in combat. Shield is a very good defense that boosts your wizard’s Armor
Class and Reflex defense once per encounter. Dimension door is one of sev-
eral very good 6th-level powers, but we like it best because it’s a “get out of
jail free” card; if your character has a big, hungry monster right in his or her
face, he or she can just teleport away. Blur is also a fine defensive power that
works especially well in battles where you can hang back from your enemies;
what they can’t see, they can’t hit.
The Control Wizard
Damage is great, but given the choice between a spell that deals 3d6 damage
or another one that deals 2d6 and immobilizes your targets, you should
choose the one that carries the potent side effect. The difference between
2d6 and 3d6 is only an average of 3.5 points of damage, but a monster that’s
stuck in its square is a monster that you can get away from, that your team-
mates can surround, or — if nothing else — that you can target again next
round, because it’s going to be exactly where you left it.

(replaces 1st-level daily)
* These powers are in your wizard’s spellbook — you must choose which of the two listed powers
at that level to prepare each day.
For your 1st-level at-will powers, we recommend cloud of daggers and thunder
wave. Cloud of daggers offers good terrain control because the effect persists
in the target square until your next turn — creatures that try to move
through that square take extra damage. Use this power to block a doorway or
narrow hall and keep your enemies at a safe distance. Thunder wave deals
damage to multiple targets and pushes them away from you.
At 1st level, we recommend icy terrain for your encounter power. It knocks
each creature you hit prone and creates a nice patch of ice that costs double
to move through. When your wizard knocks enemies prone, it severely
restricts their actions next turn — it costs a move action to stand up, so they
can’t move and attack with their remaining action. Choose color spray (3rd
level) for your next encounter power. It’s a Close attack spell, so you can use
176
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

it even when your character is in the middle of melee, and it attacks Will
defense. At 7th level, we recommend winter’s wrath; it covers a wide area and
inflicts good damage.
Your 11th-level encounter power is determined by your paragon path;
Spellstorm Mage is the best option for a Control Wizard. At 13th level, you get
to replace your 1st-level encounter spell with a 13th-level one. We like pris-
matic burst here because it’s another attack against Will defense, and it blinds
affected creatures. Monsters can’t easily hit what they can’t see!
For your character’s daily powers, begin with sleep (1st level) and then
choose fireball (5th) and ice storm (9th). At 15th level, replace sleep with
Bigby’s grasping hands (15th). Sleep is a very powerful 1st-level spell that can
take several enemies out of the fight in one shot, even if it doesn’t do any
damage at all. Fireball may seem like an odd choice for a Control Wizard, but
you do need some powers that apply damage downrange — your character is
a controller, not a pacifist. Ice storm combines good damage and the ability to
immobilize multiple enemies, which is the controller’s dream.
Your utility spell choices are much like the War Wizard’s. Unlike most other
classes, a wizard’s utility powers have little to do with his or her role; they’re
just weird, useful magical things the wizard can do. We recommend shield
(2nd), levitate (6th), and arcane gate (10th). Trust us, you’ll find plenty of
ways to use them!
Choosing Cleric Powers
Cleric powers are called prayers. Clerics channel potent magical prayers,
using the divine power source to create overtly supernatural effects; they’re
armed with the power of mythic deities, after all. Cleric prayers offer a mix of
melee and ranged attacks, but they specialize in powers that protect, heal,
and strengthen their comrades.
Before you pick out your cleric powers, you need to decide on your cleric
build. It’s important to pay attention to your ability scores for this — clerics
have both Strength-based powers and Wisdom-based powers, so make sure
that you choose the build that corresponds with your best ability score.
 Battle Cleric: This cleric favors prayers designed for use in melee and
wields his or her powers from the front line. Look for powers that are
melee attacks, Close attacks, or rely on Strength.
 Devoted Cleric: The Devoted Cleric supports his or her comrades from
the second rank, staying out of melee and relying on ranged prayers.
The best powers for this build are ranged attacks or area attacks and are
based on Wisdom attacks.
177
Chapter 14: Choosing Powers

Take a look at Tables 14-7 and 14-8 in the following sections. If you want to
use these recommendations, simply choose the prayers given for each char-
acter level. Your character knows all the powers for all previous levels.
The Battle Cleric
To keep it simple, we’re steering the Battle Cleric toward hitting bad guys in
melee and healing allies. The cleric prayers on Table 14-7 don’t offer much
ability to “designate targets” for the party or deal with enemies at range, but
they let you hit the monsters hard and pour on the healing for your friends. If
you want to play an easy cleric, this is the way to go.

Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Clerics and healing prayers
The classic job of the cleric in the D&D game is
healing, and in previous editions, players with
cleric characters had to make sure they loaded
up on healing spells. In 4th Edition, you don’t
have to do that anymore — the game just gives
clerics the healing word class feature, so your
cleric is automatically armed with two uses of
the healing word power per encounter. Using
this power is only a minor action for you, so you
can move and use your standard action to make
an attack or activate some other power in the
same round.
Although healing word provides your cleric
character with an effective baseline healing
ability, many of the cleric powers provide extra
healing. It’s up to you to decide how many more
healing powers you want above the baseline
afforded by your class features; we think it’s a
good idea to have at least one or two more than
the minimum mandated by the class.

14th
(No new powers)
15th
Daily: holy spark (replaces avenging flame)
The Battle Cleric’s at-will power selections are righteous brand and priest’s
shield. Righteous brand is an outstanding offensive power, not because it lets
you hit the monster all that hard, but because it confers a very significant
attack bonus to an ally of your choice against the foe you attack. If your party
is having a hard time hitting a monster, righteous brand can help to turn the
tide.
For your character’s 1st-level encounter power, we suggest wrathful thunder.
It’s an attack that dazes the target. As you advance in level, add the encounter
prayers command (3rd) and strengthen the faithful (7th). Command is an effec-
tive and accurate ranged attack. While you don’t use many ranged attacks, it’s
good to have a couple in your pocket for when you need one. Strengthen the
faithful can potentially heal up multiple characters at once. Your 11th level
encounter power depends on your paragon path, but at 13th level, replace
your old wrathful thunder power with inspiring strike. It doesn’t heal much
damage, but the healing this power offers doesn’t cost a healing surge — and
conserving healing surges can be very important in long adventures.
For your 1st-level daily power, we recommend avenging flame. It’s a solid
attack power that discourages the target from attacking on its turn.
Consecrated ground is an excellent 5th-level daily prayer. It doesn’t make use
of an attack roll; it simply establishes an area around your character where
enemies take damage and your allies regain hit points every turn. Use it at
the beginning of a battle to get the most out of its effects. Your best 9th-level
prayer is divine power, a potent, close-range, area-effect attack. At 15th level,
replace avenging flame with holy spark.
179
Chapter 14: Choosing Powers

Cure light wounds is probably the simplest 2nd-level utility power, offering
another way to patch up hit point damage. At 6th and 10th level, default to
cure serious wounds and mass cure light wounds. You’re not going to run out of
healing oomph in this build — we guarantee it.
The Devoted Cleric
Compared with the Battle Cleric, the Devoted Cleric build includes many
more powers that work at range, so your character can stand back out of the
fray. The Devoted Cleric heals just as well as the Battle Cleric and also has
more “target designation” powers — that is, powers that provide your allies
with bonuses to attack the enemies you’re affecting. Part of the leader role is
helping the other players decide which bad guys their characters should be
attacking!

Cleric Prayers Known
14th
(No new powers)
15th
Daily: seal of warding (replaces beacon of hope)
The suggested at-will prayers for the Devoted Cleric are lance of faith and
sacred flame. Both are ranged powers; if you find yourself in melee, your at-
will “power” is simply a basic melee attack with your mace. Lance of faith is a
good target-designation power because it grants one ally a bonus to attack the
target you hit. Sacred flame is another ranged attack, but this one is an excel-
lent healing power. When you use it, you can either grant temporary hit points
to an ally or grant an ally the opportunity to make a saving throw. Temporary
hit points aren’t healing, but they help to mitigate the damage suffered by the
ally you’re protecting the next time he or she gets hit by an attack.
For your 1st-level encounter prayer, we recommend healing strike. It’s a melee
attack, but you need a couple of those. At 3rd level, take daunting light. It’s a
good ranged attack and also gives your allies combat advantage against the
target, so it’s another good target-designator prayer. At 7th level, searing light
deals damage and blinds the target. Your 13th-level encounter prayer replaces
healing strike; we recommend mantle of glory. This is a great Close attack that
covers a big area, deals a lot of damage to enemies, and also triggers a healing
surge for any of your allies who happen to be in the area of the effect.
The Devoted Cleric’s 1st-level daily prayer is beacon of hope, a Close power
that weakens all enemies around you while healing your allies and boosting
your healing ability for the rest of the encounter. At 5th level, choose spiritual
weapon for a decent ranged attack that gives your allies combat advantage
against the target for as long as you keep the power going. Flame strike is a
fine area attack at 9th level. It doesn’t provide any healing or help out your
allies, but sometimes you just need to toast the bad guys. When you reach
15th level, replace beacon of hope with seal of warding. This deals very high
damage for a cleric power and adds a little bit of terrain control, too.
For your utility powers, we recommend shield of faith (2nd), bastion of health
(6th), and mass cure light wounds (10th). The Devoted Cleric can afford to skip
divine aid because the sacred flame at-will power lets you grant saving throws
when you need to. The Devoted Cleric prefers bastion of health to cure serious
wounds because bastion of health is a minor action, and it has a very good
range. It might not provide as much healing, but it’s extremely easy to use.
Mass cure light wounds provides you with the ability to turn around a losing
battle in a hurry because you can heal the whole party with one prayer.
181
Chapter 14: Choosing Powers

If you choose to play a healing-heavy cleric, you may find that you have few
discretionary actions in the course of the game. Many of your turns will be
sucked up in tending to injured characters. Other players will often take it for
granted that you’re willing to give up your turn in order to keep their charac-
ters in the fight. If that doesn’t sound like fun to you, avoid using your utility
power selections for healing prayers that cost you standard actions.

183
Chapter 14: Choosing Powers
Powers for other classes
One of the biggest innovations in DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS 4th Edition game is that every charac-
ter is a spellcaster . . . so to speak. The paladin,
ranger, warlock, and warlord gain powers using
the same master advancement table that the
four classes we discuss in this chapter use.
Here are a few quick tips on choosing powers
when you create characters of one of these
other classes:
 Paladin: Righteous smite is an excellent
3rd-level encounter prayer that deals good
damage and provides temporary hit points
to you and all your allies. The only draw-
back is that it’s a Charisma attack, which
probably lags behind your Wisdom attacks.
Benign transposition (7th level) is an
encounter prayer that lets you switch
places with an endangered ally and make a
good attack against any foe you’re now
next to.
 Ranger: Your choice of ranger powers
depends on whether you decided to go with
the archery style or two-weapon fighting
style. Fortunately, many ranger powers
work in both melee and at range, changing
from Strength attacks to Dexterity attacks
accordingly. Rangers also excel in reactive
powers that you can use as interrupt
actions; for example, at 3rd level, the
encounter exploit disruptive strike lets you
immediately attack an enemy who’s taking
a swing at you or one of your allies. If you
hit, you deal damage and a big attack
penalty on the attacking creature.
 Warlock:
Warlocks are strikers, like
rangers and rogues, but many of their daily
spells also inflict substantial control effects.
For example, the 5th-level daily spell
hunger of Hadar is a small-area-effect
attack that creates a zone of damaging
darkness. Any creature in the zone — or
that moves into the zone later — takes
damage. This allows the warlock to deny an
area to enemies who don’t want to take
damage.
 Warlord: Warlords have few powers that
work well at range. They’re all melee lead-
ers, really. However, some of the most
iconic warlord powers let the warlord 
grant an ally the opportunity to attack.
Powers such as hammer and anvil (1st-level
encounter power) or surprise attack (7th-
level encounter power) don’t allow the war-
lord to do much damage, but the ability to
choose an ally to take a swing at the target
as well means that these powers actually
provide excellent offensive leadership.

Selecting Feats

 Adding up your feat choices
 Understanding feat requirements
 Getting a handle on feat types
 Taking a shortcut: choosing feats for your character’s build
E
very character has his or her own unique set of advantages, training, or
special tricks. Even two characters who otherwise would appear to be
very similar — say, two dwarves who are both 5th-level fighters — might
choose different powers, acquire different magic items, and specialize in dif-
ferent weapons. Feats are one of the ways you can customize your character
and differentiate him or her from similar characters. Feats are special advan-
tages that represent your character’s own unique training and combat style.
Fighter characters can choose feats that reward them for mastering specific
weapons such as light blades, axes, or hammers. Wizard characters can gain
feats that make them especially good at casting certain types of spells or
using certain types of wizardly implements. Clerics and paladins can learn
feats that give them new ways to use their Channel Divinity class features.
And all characters can choose feats that give them training in new skills,
make them especially observant or quick to react, or grant proficiency in
armor or weapons they wouldn’t normally be able to use.
In this chapter, we tell you how your character gains feats and how you can
use feat selections to customize your character with special edges and
hidden strengths. We also provide you with recommendations on how you
should spend your feats for the basic builds of the fighter, rogue, wizard, and
cleric classes. Feats can be a great way to fine-tune your character build, and
we help you do it right.

What’s a Feat?
Feats are specific bonuses or unusual advantages that customize your char-
acter’s capabilities and performance. They range from relatively simple feats
like Durable (which gives your character more healing surges per day) to
spectacular combat options such as Lightning Arc (which allows you to con-
vert a critical hit you score with a lightning power into a hit against another
target altogether). Most feats simply grant your character a static, “always-
on” benefit or adjustment that you don’t have to track during play.
Over the course of your character’s career, you eventually build up a collec-
tion of feats. Taken together, your character’s feats form a suite or library of
special edges, useful talents, and combat tricks that make him or her differ-
ent from any other character of the same class and level. The higher your
character’s level, the more feats he or she knows, and the more feats known,
the more unique and powerful your character becomes.
You can find the definitive word on feats in Chapter 6 of the Player’s
Handbook. Feats are organized into heroic tier, paragon tier, and epic tier.
Your character must be at least 11th level to choose paragon feats and at
least 21st level to choose epic feats.
186
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Sample feats
Here are three quick examples of some feats
you can find in the Player’s Handbook. (You’ll
need to visit the Player’s Handbook to find the
definitions of the feats we mention throughout
this book, as well as to see the entire range of
feats available to characters.)
 Improved Initiative
Prerequisite: None.
Benefit: You get a +4 bonus on Initiative
checks.
 Power Attack
Prerequisite: Strength 15.
Benefit: When making a melee attack, you
can take a –2 penalty to the attack roll. If the
attack hits, you gain a +2 bonus to the
damage roll (or a +3 bonus to the damage
roll with a two-handed weapon). This extra
damage increases by level: At 11th level,
you gain a +4 bonus to your damage roll 
(or +6 with a two-handed weapon); at 21st
level, you gain a +6 bonus to your damage
roll (or +9 with a two-handed weapon).
 Surprise Knockdown [Rogue]
Prerequisites: Str 15, Rogue class
Benefit: If you score a critical hit while you
have combat advantage, you knock the
target prone.
Most feats are general feats that any char-
acter can take, but some — like Surprise
Knockdown — are restricted to characters of
certain classes or races. You may notice that
Power Attack and Surprise Knockdown also
have an ability requirement: Your character
must have a Strength score of 15 or better in
order to choose either of these feats.

The Basics of Acquiring Feats
Here’s the bad news about feats: They’re great, but your character learns
them slowly. Characters get one feat at 1st level, plus one feat for every even-
numbered level they reach (which gives characters a total of two feats at 2nd
level, three feats at 4th level, four feats at 6th level, and so on).
The two key exceptions to this rule are that
 Humans begin with one bonus feat at 1st level as a racial advantage.
 Some classes offer bonus feats as class features. For example, clerics
and wizards gain the Ritual Caster feat as a bonus feat — they don’t have
to spend any of their feat selections on Ritual Caster. 
As much as you might like to pick Heavy Blade Mastery for your character’s
first feat choice, you can’t do it. Most feats have one or more requirements
that your character must meet before you can add them to his or her arsenal.
For example, your character must have a Strength score of 15 or better to
take the Power Attack feat. The best feats require that your character first
reach paragon or epic level, and then you have to meet challenging ability
requirements. In the case of Heavy Blade Mastery, your character must have
a Strength score of 21 or better, a Dexterity score of 17 or better, and be at
least 21st level. Wow!
The good news for beginning characters is that many feats have require-
ments that are easily met by even a 1st-level character (or no requirements at
all), so you’re pretty much guaranteed of finding something your character
can use right from day one.
Two tricky requirements are race and class. If your character isn’t a dwarf, he
or she can’t pick dwarf feats. That’s pretty straightforward. Similarly, you
can’t pick a rogue feat if your character isn’t a rogue. (You can’t get around
the requirements for racial feats, but you can take a multiclass feat to gain
access to another class’s feats. See Chapter 22 for more information about
multiclassing your character.)
Planning Your Feat Choices
Feats can be pretty daunting because there are so many to choose from. So,
what we do here is provide you with a recommended set of feat selections for
the two basic builds in each character class. It’s a good idea to have a plan
for which feats your character will select over the next few levels so that you
can make sure you get the feats you want as quickly as possible.
187
Chapter 15: Selecting Feats

If you’re not sure which feats are the best choice for your character, you can
use these feat packages as a basic plan for making a sound (if not particularly
creative) set of feat choices for your character as he or she rises in level and
gains more feat choices.
Try the following process when evaluating your feat choices:
1. Choose your character’s class (if you haven’t already), and then
decide which build you want your character to follow within that
class.
A skillful Guardian Fighter, for example, needs to learn different feats
from a muscle-bound, axe-wielding Great Weapon Fighter, even though
they’re both fighters.
2. Consult the feat recommendations for your character’s class and
chosen build (for descriptions of how these work in each build, see
the sections that follow), or design your own feat plan.
After you’ve played the game for a while and you’ve made up a few char-
acters, experiment with building feat plans that exploit feat choices our
recommendations here don’t make use of.
3. Make any extra feat selections you have coming to you, such as the
bonus feat that human characters get at 1st level.
4. Record your feat selections on your character sheet.
The feat recommendations presented in this chapter don’t account for a
human character’s bonus feat. In most cases, you can use the bonus feat to
climb your way up the list even faster, but watch out for feats with level
requirements. For example, if you’re following the Guardian Fighter build rec-
ommendations on Table 15-1, you simply can’t buy the Mettle feat before
your character reaches 11th level, because Mettle is a paragon feat. Try using
your character’s human bonus feat to pick up Alertness, Durable, Human
Perseverance, or Skill Training. (The Perception skill is a very good choice.)
These feats are good for any human character.
Choosing fighter feats
For the purpose of choosing feats, we’re going to make you decide whether
you want your fighter character to be a Great Weapon Fighter or Guardian
Fighter. (See Chapter 11 for a description of these builds.)

Great Weapon Fighter feat suggestions
The basic plan for a Great Weapon Fighter is to run up to the monsters and
just beat the tar out of them with a big sword, axe, warhammer, or whatever
implement of mayhem catches your fancy. If you ever find that you don’t
know what you want your character to do, have him or her hit something! You
want your character to deal out terrific amounts of damage in the shortest
time possible.
Your fighter character needs a Strength score of 15 or better to make this set
of recommendations work. Your best weapon choices are the greataxe,
greatsword, heavy flail, or maul. (Our power recommendations in Chapter 14
assume the greataxe, so keep that in mind.)
Start with the Weapon Focus feat to gain a bonus to damage with your
chosen weapon. Then take Toughness to get more hit points — as a fighter,
you can never have too many hit points. Armor Training is a good idea,
because switching from scale armor to plate armor is worth +1 AC. A little bit
of Armor Class improvement goes a long way on the front lines.
For your 8th level feat, we recommend choosing one of the feats offered by
your character race — for example, Action Surge for a human, Lost in the
Crowd for a halfling, and so on. Racial feats tend to be very good, and you’ll
want them. If you don’t like any of these choices, Durable or Improved
Initiative never go out of style.
189
Chapter 15: Selecting Feats

The Power Attack feat doesn’t do that much for your character early in his or
her career, so wait until you approach the 11th-level threshold, where the
damage boost offered by the feat improves.
In paragon tier, pick up Mettle as soon as you can; it’s one of the best feats
out there. After that, have fun maximizing your damage with Devastating
Critical and Blood Thirst. You want to hit the bad guys hard, after all!
Guardian Fighter feat suggestions
A Guardian Fighter character is built to move to the exact spot where he or
she can do the most good and then slice the enemy to pieces with panache. 
A Guardian Fighter is especially good at fighting defensively and exerting 
control over the battlefield, so he or she can lock down multiple enemies and
keep them busy. Your character is willing to give up some damage-dealing
potential in order to maximize defenses and keep many enemies under 
control.
These recommendations are a little more challenging than those for the Great
Weapon Fighter because you need to have a good Dexterity score and a
respectable Wisdom score, too. Your character needs a Dexterity of 13 early
on, and 15 by paragon tier. And, because you’re a fighter, you still need to
have the best Strength score you can manage. For weapons and armor, your
character should be a sword-and-shield fighter; the longsword is the best bet.
In your character’s early career, your feat choices look a lot like the Great
Weapon Fighter’s. The first important point of divergence is Blade
Opportunist. Hitting hard isn’t terribly important to you, but making sure
that your opportunity attacks are extremely dangerous is — that’s one of
your principle mechanisms for keeping the monsters under control.
In paragon tier, get Mettle early. Eventually, you’ll want Evasion too, but first,
we recommend Shield Specialization. It grants you an additional +1 to AC and
Reflex defense for using a shield, which is very good. At 14th level, Heavy
Blade Opportunity allows you to use an at-will power any time you make an
opportunity attack. The sure strike and tide of iron powers are much more
effective than a simple basic attack when your enemy gives you that opening
you’ve been waiting for.
Choosing rogue feats
Rogues have access to a variety of interesting and sneaky feats. The two
builds we show you in Table 15-2 are the Brawny Rogue and the Trickster
Rogue. (See Chapter 11 for more on the rogue builds.)

Brawny Rogue feat suggestions
A rogue with this build is meant to get into a scrape and dish out as much
sneak attack damage as he or she can. When one of your character’s allies
engages a foe in a toe-to-toe fight, your character gets behind the bad guy as
quickly as possible to set up a flanking situation and then makes as many
attacks as he or she can.
Your character needs a Dexterity of 15 or higher to optimize this strategy
because that’s what you need to select the Nimble Blade feat. (Then again,
every rogue should have a Dex of at least 15, really.) By paragon tier, your
character must have a Dexterity of 17 or better to be able to select Defensive
Advantage.
Begin your feat selections with Weapon Focus (Light Blades) and Nimble Blade.
Your character should be fighting with a short sword or dagger, and these feats
help you to hit more often and deal more damage with those weapons.
Toughness is useful because the Brawny Rogue is often in the middle of the
melee, and despite your best efforts, your character is going to get hit. The
extra hit points provided by Toughness really add up over time. Improved
Initiative is key for any rogue because you want your character to go first in a
fight in order to maximize opportunities for dealing sneak attack damage.
Eventually, you want to choose a feat restricted to your character race. These
are some of the best feats in the game, and you don’t want to miss out. Finish
up your heroic tier feats by choosing Armor Proficiency (hide) to upgrade
from leather armor to hide armor. It’s worth a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.
191
Chapter 15: Selecting Feats

In paragon tier, select Evasion early — if you have Evasion, Close, and Area
attacks that would normally deal half damage on a miss against your AC or
Reflex defense instead deal no damage at all. Powers that attack your Reflex
defense include things like fireball spells cast by evil wizards or dragon
breath attacks; trust us, it’s useful. The Defensive Advantage feat helps you to
survive once you get into a position where you have combat advantage over
a foe. Finally, don’t miss the opportunity to choose another racial feat at
paragon tier.
If your character is a halfling, make sure you take the feat Halfling Agility. It’s
very, very good, as it provides a penalty to your enemies when you make them
roll again using your second chance racial ability (described in Chapter 12).
Trickster Rogue feat suggestions
Characters who spend a lot of time in the middle of the group of bad guys get
hurt, so the Trickster Rogue wants no part of that. A Trickster Rogue doesn’t
rely on flanking an enemy to gain combat advantage. Instead, he or she
places more emphasis on going first each encounter. The class feature of First
Strike grants your rogue combat advantage against enemies who haven’t yet
acted in the encounter, so beating enemy initiative rolls is the easiest way to
gain your sneak attack bonus damage. After that first round, the Trickster
Rogue relies on powers instead of positioning to set up additional sneak
attacks.
You need a Dexterity score of 15 (for Nimble Blade) and a Charisma score of
15 (for Press the Advantage) to follow these feat recommendations, but a
higher Dexterity is better. A high Dexterity helps your character to win initia-
tive and makes him or her harder to hit, and both are highly desirable for any
rogue.
Your first feat choices should be Backstabber, Nimble Blade, and Improved
Initiative. Backstabber helps you to make up for the edge a Brawny Rogue
gains on sneak attack damage. Nimble Blade gives you an attack bonus with
light blades as long as you have combat advantage, which you’re trying to get
in almost every round anyway. Improved Initiative maximizes your initiative
bonus — and you want to make sure you go first.
Press the Advantage is interesting. If you score a critical hit, you automati-
cally retain combat advantage against the target for a round. It’s a little situa-
tional; after all, you score critical hits only when you roll a 20. However, it’s
very useful for the Trickster Rogue because you would prefer to not have to
flank the enemy in order to gain combat advantage. This feat works quite well
for an elf rogue because elven accuracy (a racial power) gives you more
opportunities to roll that 20.
192
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

As with the Brawny Rogue, Toughness and Evasion are smart investments.
You don’t need Toughness as much as the Brawny Rogue does (theoretically,
you’re not getting attacked as often), but you should pick it up eventually.
Combat Anticipation is a very useful defensive feat that protects you against
most attacks made from a distance. Because you hope to spend less time in
melee than the Brawny Rogue, it’s another good investment. Finally, we finish
up our Trickster Rogue recommendations with Danger Sense. This feat lets
you roll two dice and use the better result when you’re rolling initiative,
which translates to another big bonus on initiative checks. Rogues always
want to go first.
Choosing wizard feats
You have an entirely different set of feat choices to weigh for a wizard charac-
ter than for a fighter or rogue. You want to choose feats to enhance your
character’s magical prowess and to master useful spellcasting tricks, not
study the arts of swordsmanship and archery. The two builds described in
Table 15-3 are the War Wizard and Control Wizard (see Chapter 11).

War Wizard feat suggestions
The War Wizard’s objective is pretty simple: Get as much damage downrange
on as many targets as possible. All you need to do with this build is choose
feats that provide damage bonuses, especially if you can match up those
bonuses with the types of powers your character employs most often.
193
Chapter 15: Selecting Feats

To make use of these feat suggestions, your War Wizard needs Constitution
13, Dexterity 15, and Charisma 13 or better. That may sound like a lot, but it’s
not that hard — and you want ability scores that can help out your Fortitude
and Will defenses anyway. Dexterity is a little tougher, but it’s important. First
of all, your Wand of Accuracy class feature relies on it. Secondly, the Astral
Fire and Arcane Reach feats require it, and those are feats you want.
Your initial feat selections include Improved Initiative, Astral Fire, and
Toughness. Improved Initiative lets you usually go earlier in the combat so
that you can cast your area spells without fear of accidentally catching your
allies in the blasts. Astral Fire just gives you a straight damage bonus on fire
and radiant powers, and you’ll acquire plenty of those during your career.
Toughness is a good idea, simply because wizards don’t have many hit points
and you never know when you might wish you had more.
At 6th level, pick up one of your racial feats. Then choose Armor Proficiency
(leather) to upgrade your armor choices. When you reach 8th level, pick
Raging Storm to boost spells with lightning or thunder damage.
For paragon tier feats, we like starting with Arcane Reach. It lets you begin a
Close power up to two squares away from your actual location. This lets you
include more enemies in the area of effect or steer your Close powers around
your own allies more easily. Devastating Critical should be your next choice.
Normally we’re lukewarm on feats that work only when you roll a 20, but
here’s the deal: As a War Wizard, you make more attack rolls than any other
character in the game because your powers affect multiple targets and you’re
usually rolling two or three attacks every time you take an action. You’ll get
plenty of chances for your extra damage. Finally, we recommend Evasion.
Evasion is an excellent defensive feat that helps you to avoid damage from
many Area and Close attacks.
Control Wizard feat suggestions
Your feat selection is a little scattershot, covering a mix of damage, defense,
tactics, and utility. Ideally, you want to find feats that make your heavy-con-
trol spells hit more often or last longer . . . but feats like that are scarce, so
you’ll have to settle for feats that provide a little extra damage or boost your
defense when you cast the spells you use most often.
To make use of our recommendations, your wizard character needs a mini-
mum Intelligence 13, Wisdom 13, and Charisma 13. (Your Intelligence score
should be much higher than that, though!) Wisdom 13 is required for your
Expanded Spellbook and Burning Blizzard feats, and Charisma 13 is what you
need for your Spell Focus feat — one of the most important feats to a Control
Wizard.
Your early feat selections include Expanded Spellbook, Improved Initiative,
and Burning Blizzard. Expanded Spellbook lets you learn even more daily
attack spells, ensuring that you’ll be able to customize your spell selection
194
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

for specific adventures. Improved Initiative is helpful because as a Control
Wizard your Dexterity score is probably marginal — a 13 is all you need for a
long time — and you need the help. Establishing control over your enemy’s
movements works best if you get to throw your spell before your enemies get
to move up next to your allies. Finally, Burning Blizzard is handy because
many of the best control spells are cold-based, so you might as well hand out
just a little more damage.
Pick up a good racial feat of your choice at 6th level (Action Surge or Human
Perseverance are good if you’re human) and then take Toughness at 8th level.
Extra hit points never go out of fashion. For your 10th level feat, pick up
another racial feat for good measure.
In the paragon tier, make sure you choose Arcane Reach and Spell Focus.
Spell Focus is the Control Wizard’s dream feat because many of your best
powers last only until your targets succeed on their saving throws. Second
Implement is good for any wizard and gives you more options for improving
the effectiveness of your spells.
Choosing cleric feats
Clerics are interested in a variety of feats, ranging from feats that provide
new weapon and armor choices to feats that improve the effectiveness of var-
ious prayers. The two builds of cleric we discuss here are the Battle Cleric
and Devoted Cleric, described in Table 15-4. (See Chapter 11 for more infor-
mation on character builds.)

Chapter 15: Selecting Feats

Battle Cleric feat suggestions
The Battle Cleric likes mixing it up, and he or she wants to be a very good
melee combatant. Your character is almost as good at melee combat as the
fighter, and your powers have the added advantage of being able to
strengthen friends and heal the wounded when needed.
To follow these suggestions, your cleric needs Strength 13, Constitution 13,
Intelligence 13, and Charisma 13. The Strength and Constitution requirements
let you acquire Armor Proficiency (Scale); in fact, if you have Strength and
Constitution scores of 15 or better, you could actually train up to plate armor
after you learn how to use scale armor. The Intelligence and Charisma
requirements are for your Astral Fire feat.
The Player’s Handbook suggests that Battle Clerics should begin with Weapon
Focus, but we have a better idea: Choose Weapon Proficiency and learn how
to use a bastard sword instead. Most simple weapons have a proficiency
bonus of +2, but the bastard sword has a proficiency bonus of +3, so in effect
you’re getting +1 to hit. And its 1d10 damage is better than most simple
weapons too, giving you an effective +1 to damage as compared to the mace.
Wait on Weapon Focus until you’ve gained proficiency in a weapon better
than the cleric’s old standby.
Because you’re going to be in melee, you should improve your armor choices
as much as you can. Pick up Armor Proficiency (Scale); it’s +1 AC compared
to chain armor. At 4th level, choose the Channel Divinity feat appropriate for
your character’s patron deity; these are all very fun feats that make your
Channel Divinity class feature useful in just about every encounter, not just
encounters against undead.
Toughness is important for a Battle Cleric. (Once again, your character is in
melee a lot, so he or she will get hit.) Make sure you pick up a racial feat
when you can — racial feats are usually quite good.
In paragon tier, you’ll find that Mettle is an excellent defensive feat that will
save you a fair amount of damage in encounters against the right monsters.
Evasion is better, but it requires a Dexterity of 15, so you probably can’t meet
the ability requirements. Devastating Critical may come up any time you
make an attack. Finally, Astral Fire provides a nice damage boost because
many cleric powers deal radiant or fire damage.
Devoted Cleric feat suggestions
Your Devoted Cleric is much less interested in melee combat than the Battle
Cleric but should still be reasonably competent if the battle comes to close
quarters. Most of your combat power comes in the form of decent direct-
attack prayers that also enhance your companions’ fighting abilities and
defenses.
196
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

To use these suggestions, your character needs an Intelligence of 13 and a
Charisma of 13 to acquire the Astral Fire feat. If you decide you want to
improve your armor options, you also need Strength 13 and Constitution 13
in order to select Armor Proficiency (Scale).
For your first few feats, we recommend starting with the Channel Divinity feat
appropriate to your character’s deity choice. These feats significantly expand
the ways you can use your Channel Divinity class feature. After that, learn the
Astral Fire feat. Although you don’t care all that much about inflicting
damage, the great majority of prayers available to your character deal out
radiant or fire damage. Don’t forget to take a look at the racial feats available
to your character early in your career.
To finish out the heroic tier, we recommend Toughness and Alertness. You
may have noticed that we recommend Toughness for every single character.
There’s a reason; extra hit points help in every encounter. Alertness is more
of a “flavor” choice that makes it harder for the monsters to surprise you.
Because you’re the party’s primary healer, you want to make sure that you
aren’t taken out of the fight by a sudden ambush.
197
Chapter 15: Selecting Feats
Key feats for other classes
Although these feat suggestions give you ser-
viceable clerics, fighters, rogues, and wizards,
you might wonder which feats you should con-
sider if your character happens to be a member
of one of the other classes in the game. Here’s
a quick set of suggestions for each of the
classes we don’t cover at length:
 Paladin: Choose Channel Divinity feats; pick
the one appropriate to your deity early in
your career. Weapon Focus is a good
choice. Astral Fire is another good choice if
your Intelligence is 13; many of your powers
deal radiant damage. And don’t forget
Toughness!
 Ranger: The ranger’s combat style class
ability provides your character with a free
feat. If you follow the archery path for your
ranger, you gain Defensive Mobility for free;
if you follow two-weapon combat, you gain
Toughness. Make sure you pick up Weapon
Focus, Two-Weapon Fighting, and Two-
Weapon Defense if you’re a melee ranger.
 Warlock: You can select feats that improve
the effects of your pact boon: Improved
Dark One’s Blessing, Improved Fate of the
Void, or Improved Misty Step. Energy
damage feats such as Astral Fire, Burning
Blizzard, and Dark Fury are also good
choices. Consider improving your Armor
Class by choosing Armor Proficiency (hide).
 Warlord: You should definitely invest in
Shield Proficiency (light and heavy), Armor
Proficiency (scale), and Toughness. Taking
Weapon Proficiency in a superior melee
weapon and Weapon Focus in that weapon
is a good idea. Choose Inspired Recovery or
Tactical Assault when you get the chance.

As you move into paragon tier, Combat Anticipation and Iron Will are good
choices. Combat Anticipation is a good defensive feat, especially because the
Devoted Cleric tries to stay out of the front lines; most of the attacks that
come your way are Close, Area, or Ranged. Iron Will makes your Will defense
even more formidable. Finally, take Weapon Focus to reinforce your melee
attacks for the rare occasions when you do take out your mace.
198
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Multiclass feats
One last thing we should tell you about feats:
Feats are how your character learns class fea-
tures and powers from different character
classes. This is referred to as “multiclassing,”
and it lets you create combinations such as a
warlock/fighter, a cleric/ranger, or a paladin/
wizard. Multiclass feats are described at the
end of Chapter 6 in the Player’s Handbook.
Multiclassing is an advanced technique for
character creation, so we look at multiclass
feats more closely in Chapter 22 in this book.

R
egdar the fighter and Kerwyn the rogue are fleeing from a rampaging
umber hulk when they come to a slender rope bridge swaying over a
bottomless chasm. Kerwyn darts across the bridge with ease, but Regdar
picks his way over the obstacle hand-over-hand, only one small slip away
from a terrifying plunge. If you’re wondering how Kerwyn made it look so
easy, the answer is simple: skills. Kerwyn is trained in Acrobatics — balanc-
ing, tightrope walking, tumbling, and other such tasks. Regdar’s training 
doesn’t extend to such exercises — and at the moment, he kind of wishes 
it did.
In this chapter, we tell you how characters learn and use skills, and we show
you a set of quick skill packages that will make choosing skills for your char-
acter fast, easy, and effective.
All about Skills
Skills represent your character’s training in tasks that don’t directly involve
combat. The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game has 17 distinct skills in the Player’s
Handbook, ranging from Acrobatics to Thievery.
All characters have some basic ability in any skill; for example, you can try an
Acrobatics skill check even if your character doesn’t have any special talent
for it. In the example at the beginning of the chapter, Regdar’s in exactly that
position: He’s taking his chances with that precarious rope bridge even
though he doesn’t have a knack for balancing. However, if you want your
character to be good at a skill, your character must be trained in it. If you’re
trained, you gain a +5 bonus on checks you make with that skill, and (depend-
ing on the skill) you may be able to try things that untrained characters
simply can’t.

The number of skills your character is trained in and the skills he or she can
choose from depend on his or her class, race, and level. Some character
classes gain training in more skills than others — for example, rogues and
rangers rely on their skills more than fighters or wizards do. We explain the
skill selection process later in this chapter, in the “Choosing your character’s

Part II: Building a D&D Character 
A sample skill
Here’s an example of a skill description from the
Player’s Handbook, Chapter 5. (You can find
descriptions of all the other skills in the game
there.) This example shows the Thievery skill
and one of its four basic functions — disabling
traps.
THIEVERY (DEXTERITY)
Armor Check Penalty
Your character has picked up thieving abilities
and can perform tasks that require nerves of
steel and a steady hand: disabling traps, open-
ing locks, picking pockets, and sleight of hand.
The DM may decide that some uses of this skill
are so specialized that your character is
required to be trained in it to have a chance of
succeeding.
Disable Trap
Make a Thievery check to prevent a trap from
triggering. You need to be aware of a trap to try
to disable it. Make a Perception check to find a
hidden trap.
Disable Trap: Standard action in combat or as
part of a skill challenge.
 DC: See the following table. You get a +2
bonus on the check if you use thieves’ tools.
 Delay Trap: You get a +5 bonus on the check
if you try to delay a trap rather than dis-
abling it.
 Success: You disable or delay the trap.
Disabling a trap makes it harmless until it
resets. Delaying a trap makes the trapped
area safe for passage until the end of your
next turn.
 Fail by 4 or less: Nothing happens.
 Fail by 5 or more: You trigger the trap.

20
Paragon tier

Epic tier

The information following the name of the skill
tells you that this is a Dexterity-based skill, so
you make a Dexterity check to use Thievery.
Armor Check Penalty means that you must add
the armor check modifier for the armor your
character wears to this check; it’s hard to dis-
able traps in plate armor. The information under
Disable Trap tells you how to use Thievery to
accomplish this specific task; there are similar
sections for Open Lock and Pick Pocket, which
we didn’t include here. The table shows the
average Difficulty Class for disabling traps
found in adventures at the various adventuring
tiers; this is the target number you have to hit
with a roll of 1d20 + 1⁄2 your level + your Dex mod-
ifier (and + 5, if you’re trained in Thievery) in
order to disable a trap of that sort.

Every skill is associated with a key ability. For example, Acrobatics is a
Dexterity-based skill — the reasoning is that if a person has great Dexterity,
he or she is good at balancing and tumbling, but a person who has a crummy
Dexterity is terrible at them. Your skill bonus is your character’s total modi-
fier to checks made with that skill. This always includes your character’s
level modifier and your character’s key ability modifier, and it may include
modifiers for being trained in the skill, racial bonuses, feat bonuses, or magic
item bonuses.
Sometimes a great ability score and a few experience levels can largely make
up for a lack of training. For example, a 1st-level character with training in
Acrobatics and a Dexterity score of 13 (+5 trained modifier, +1 ability modi-
fier, for a total +6 skill check bonus) isn’t quite as good at balancing as an
untrained 6th-level character with a Dexterity score of 18 (+3 level modifier
and +4 ability modifier, for a total +7 skill check bonus).
Using skills
To use one of your character’s skills, you make a skill check. A skill check is a
twenty-sided die (d20) roll adjusted by your level modifier (1⁄2 your level), the
key ability score modifier for the skill, an additional +5 if you’re trained in the
skill, and any other bonus or special modifier. Some character races and feats
confer additional bonuses on particular skill checks; for example, elves gain
+2 on Nature and Perception checks. The most common special modifier is
an armor check penalty — a negative modifier to certain skills for wearing
heavy armor. If a skill is affected by the armor check penalty, the skill descrip-
tion will clearly state that. In addition, there may be various circumstance
modifiers the DM decides to apply. So here’s what the formula looks like:
Skill Check = 1d20 + level modifier + ability modifier + 5 (if trained) + 
special modifiers (if any)
Your skill check yields a result that might range from less than 0 (if significant
negative circumstances apply) to 30 or better (if you rolled well on a trained
skill based on one of your character’s higher ability scores).
The DM compares your skill check result to a Difficulty Class (DC) or target
number appropriate to the task your character is trying to accomplish.
Difficulty Class works a lot like Armor Class — it’s a target number you’re
trying to reach or exceed by rolling a d20 and adding the appropriate modi-
fiers. For something easy, the DC might be only 5 or 10. (Table 16-1 shows
some sample DCs.) For something fiendishly hard, the DC might be 35, 40, 
or even higher. In fact, it might be completely impossible for your character
to succeed at some tasks; no character can leap a 100-foot wide crevasse 
(a DC 201 Athletics check, DC 101 with a running start) without a lot of 
magical help.
201
Chapter 16: Picking Skills

The skill descriptions in the Player’s Handbook list specific DCs for all sorts of
things you might have your character try to do with that skill. The DM uses
these skill descriptions to set the DC for any specific skill use you want your
character to attempt. Sometimes the DM just has to take a best guess at how
hard something is because you can try almost anything in a D&D game. If you
want your character to leap down from a rooftop and land astride a galloping
horse streaking by below, it’s an Acrobatics or Athletics check of some kind,
but you won’t find “jump into the saddle of a galloping horse” on the DC
tables in those skills. That’s why you have a Dungeon Master — so someone
can take a shot at adjudicating things the rules don’t cover.
Table 16-1

Chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook has long descriptions of every skill,
including a number of sample DCs for tasks in each skill.
Choosing your character’s skills
When you create a 1st-level character, you begin play with training in a cer-
tain number of skills. The number of skills you gain training in depends on
your character’s class and whether or not you’re playing a human — humans
begin with training in one extra skill as a racial benefit.
There’s one more thing you need to know: The list of skills you can choose
for your character is limited by his or her class. For example, a 1st-level
fighter begins play with three trained skills, chosen from this list: Athletics,
Endurance, Heal, Intimidate, and Streetwise. You might like to play a fighter
who knows something about Religion or Thievery, but no such luck — to gain
access to skills that aren’t on your class list, you’ll have to spend a feat.
202
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

The feat for learning a skill you otherwise couldn’t is Skill Training. If you
have a feat to spare, picking up this feat to get trained in Acrobatics or
Perception might be very worthwhile. However, as long as you’re looking at
spending a feat to pick up some training, take a look at the various multiclass
feats at the end of Chapter 6 in the Player’s Handbook. We talk about multi-
classing more in Chapter 22.
Quick Picks: Using Skill Packages
Skills really aren’t that complicated, but it may not be clear which ones your
character needs and which he or she can ignore. To help you separate the
useful from the distracting, the Player’s Handbook offers a set of recom-
mended skill packages for the two builds in each character class. We review
these skill packages briefly and offer a few thoughts of our own on ways to
get even more out of your character’s skills.
203
Chapter 16: Picking Skills
Five key skills
Not all skills are created equal. Although skills
such as Endurance or Heal sound like they
should be pretty important in the game, in prac-
tice you’ll fall back on your character’s class
abilities and spells to deal with most situations
involving those skills. Here’s a short list of five
skills with key game effects that you shouldn’t
ignore:
 Bluff: Rogues can use the Bluff skill to man-
ufacture sneak attack opportunities with
the Gain Combat Advantage skill applica-
tion. It’s also a great skill for your character
to use to talk his or her way past wary
guards or getting into places he or she
shouldn’t be.
 Diplomacy: This is a great catch-all skill for
convincing nonplayer characters (NPCs) or
talkative monsters to help out your charac-
ter, leave him or her alone, or give your
character something he or she needs.
 Stealth: There’s just one sneaking-up-on-
people skill: Stealth. It covers hiding and
stealing up on the bad guys without making
a sound. If you’re playing a rogue, you can
use your character’s Stealth skill to set up
sneak attack opportunities (or avoid fights
altogether, if you prefer).
 Perception: There’s one I’m-hard-to-sneak-
up-on skill: Perception. If you don’t like mon-
sters surprising your character, look for a
way to gain training in Perception so your
character will know they’re coming.
 Acrobatics: It doesn’t come up often, 
but when it does, it’s really important.
Acrobatics is the skill your character uses
for balancing on things like narrow ledges
above pits of molten lava. It also gives you
the opportunity to escape from enemy
grabs or restraints or land on your feet after
a fall. If your character is trained in
Acrobatics, you can even try to reduce
falling damage with an Acrobatics check.

Refer to Chapter 11 in this book for more information on the builds for each
character class.
Fighter skill packages
A fighter is one of those characters who just doesn’t care that much about
skills. Your character depends on fighting ability, not skill training. However,
your character does receive training in a few skills, and there’s no reason not
to choose those intelligently. Fighters don’t start out with training in any
skills by default. At 1st level, you can choose three skills that your fighter has
trained in.
We recommend selecting the following skills for a fighter:
 Great Weapon Fighter: Athletics, Endurance, Intimidate
 Guardian Fighter: Heal, Intimidate, Streetwise
Fighters are good at Athletics checks because scale armor (the fighter’s
normal armor of choice) doesn’t have any armor check penalty. Add training
in Athletics, and your character will be very good at climbing, jumping, and
swimming. Someday the ability to scale a cliff or leap a crevasse might save
your character’s life.
Intimidate is useful for fighters because it’s the only interaction skill they can
choose training in. You’d rather not approach every “talking” encounter by
issuing threats, but sometimes a little display of, hmmm, assertiveness can
help one of your more eloquent allies to make his or her point.
If you decide to add a skill by spending a feat, Perception is a very good
choice. Perception is useful for avoiding ugly surprises, such as monster
ambushes. It’s one of the few skills that might actually mean the difference
between life and death. Acrobatics or Stealth are good choices too, especially
for fighters with decent Dexterity scores.
Rogue skill package
As a rogue, your character is the master of skills. They’re essential to your
success in playing a rogue character.
You should take some time and bone up on the skills descriptions in Chapter 5
of the Player’s Handbook because your familiarity with your character’s skills
will directly impact how well you can play that character. You’d expect some-
one playing a wizard to know something about his character’s spells — if
you’re playing a rogue, you should be just as conversant about your charac-
ter’s skills.
204
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

All rogues begin with training in Stealth and Thievery. At 1st level, you can
choose four additional skills that your character is trained in.
We recommend selecting the following skills for a rogue:
 Brawny Rogue: Athletics, Dungeoneering, Intimidate, Stealth,
Streetwise, Thievery
 Trickster Rogue: Acrobatics, Bluff, Insight, Perception, Stealth, Thievery
Because all rogues automatically have training in Stealth and Thievery, your
rogue is going to be good at those skills whether you want to be or not.
Thievery is especially useful because it allows rogues to do things that char-
acters of other classes generally can’t do: disable traps and open locked
doors. You can save the whole party a great deal of aggravation by disabling
or disarming traps and getting into places the bad guys don’t want you to go.
After those two fixed skills, you have a lot more discretion in choosing which
skills your character is trained in. We think Perception is a key skill no rogue
should overlook — after all, you have to be able to find those traps in order
to disable them! Acrobatics and Athletics are potential life-savers in some
predicaments. Athletics serves as another “access” skill (or escape skill, as
the case may be) because it may enable your character to climb or jump to
places he or she otherwise couldn’t get to. Acrobatics is important because it
covers balancing, helps reduce falling damage, and also gives your character
a very significant edge on escaping from grabs. Normally you make a
Dexterity check to get out of a grab, but if you can make a trained Acrobatics
check instead, you gain a +5 bonus on your roll. To be clear, that’s just as
valuable to your escape attempt as 10 more experience levels!
Finally, most rogues should pick up Bluff. It’s a good idea for every character
to have at least one interaction skill (a skill you use in “talking” encounters)
in his or her back pocket, and Bluff is one of the more broadly useful interac-
tion skills. In addition, Bluff has a good combat function — you can use Bluff
to gain combat advantage, even though it takes a standard action. But some-
times you’d rather set up next round’s attack than take a poor attack this
round.
Wizard skill package
Skills? Bah! Wizards have magic. Skills are merely an afterthought for a
wizard, with the exception of the Arcana skill (which all wizards automati-
cally are trained in). At 1st level, a wizard starts with training in three more
skills.
205
Chapter 16: Picking Skills

We recommend selecting the following skills for a wizard:
 Control Wizard: Arcana, Diplomacy, Insight, Nature
 War Wizard: Arcana, Dungeoneering, Nature, Religion
All wizards begin with training in Arcana. That’s good, because it’s really the
only skill your wizard has to have. Arcana is important because it includes
the Detect Magic skill function (available only to trained characters), which
can often help you to unravel magical puzzles or identify dangerous magical
effects. It’s also the key skill for many magical rituals (see Chapter 20). A
good Arcana check can significantly improve the results of a ritual.
The next most important skill that wizards can get training in is monster
knowledge. If you don’t know what a monster is or what it can do, you can
attempt a check against the appropriate skill to see whether your character’s
deep lore and learning might supply an answer. It doesn’t cost your character
any actions to attempt a monster knowledge check — just ask your DM
whether you can try one. Monster knowledge is divided among several skills,
as shown in Table 16-2.
Table 16-2
Knowledge Skill Checks to Identify Monsters
Skill
Knowledge of Creatures of These Types
Arcana
Elemental, fey, or shadow origin (for example, demons)
Dungeoneering
Aberrant origin (for example, beholders)
Nature
Natural origin (for example, dragons)
Religion
Immortal origin (for example, devils)
Diplomacy and Insight are reasonable choices because they’re useful in inter-
action encounters. Every wizard should have at least one interaction skill for
successfully navigating challenges that don’t involve blowing things up with
fireballs.
If you find the opportunity to pick up new skills by spending a feat or two,
consider Acrobatics or Perception. Acrobatics may save your neck some-
day because it’s the skill that covers balancing, falling, and escaping from
grabs — when you need it, you really need it. Perception is just as good for
the wizard as it is for any character; no one likes to get surprised by the 
monsters.
206
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Cleric skill package
Like the wizard, a cleric doesn’t rely much on skills. A cleric prefers to use
combat, prayers, or rituals to solve problems, and skills are just the finishing
details of your character. Don’t be afraid to spend some skill choices on
things that just strike your fancy, because your cleric doesn’t need to be
good at very many skills. All clerics have training in the Religion skill. At 1st
level, you can choose three additional skills that your cleric is trained in.
We recommend selecting the following skills for a cleric:
 Battle Cleric: Diplomacy, Heal, Insight, Religion
 Devoted Cleric: Arcana, Heal, History, Religion
All clerics automatically have training in Religion, as you might expect. It’s
not a terribly useful skill in gameplay, but it does give your character familiar-
ity with monsters of the immortal origin — angels, devils, and immortal
guardians such as nagas or sphinxes.
Your biggest priority in skill selection is the ritual magic system. Arcana,
Heal, and Religion are the key skills for most of the rituals your character
might eventually use, so make sure your skill checks with those skills are as
good as you can make them. Training in Heal is also useful because the skill
allows you to use your action to trigger another character’s second wind or
grant a saving throw. You’d rather not give up your action for another charac-
ter if you can help it, but sometimes that’s exactly what it takes to beat the
monsters.
After that, you should have at least one skill useful in an interaction
encounter (Diplomacy or Insight). Because clerics tend to have very high
Wisdom scores, a cleric is a natural for covering Insight for the party. History
is also on the list of cleric skills, but there are very few game reasons to
choose it. Select it as one of your character skills if you think it suits your
character concept to be knowledgeable about old wars and ancient empires.
If you use a feat to gain additional skill training, consider Acrobatics or
Athletics. Most clerics wear heavy armor and don’t have much in the way of a
Dexterity score, which means that fairly easy balance checks are murder-
ously hard for them. The consequences of a failed balance check or swim
check might be catastrophic, so you may want to invest a feat against the day
your character will need to make a key check or die horribly. As with any
other character, you’ll do well to pick up Perception if you can, but don’t feel
like you have to. Because your character probably has a high Wisdom score,
you’re pretty good at Perception checks even if you aren’t trained in it.

Chapter 17
Choosing Armor, Weapons, 
and Gear
In This Chapter
 Choosing the optimal weapon
 Suiting up with the best armor
 Picking out adventuring gear
 Improving your character’s weapons and armor
You’ve picked out your character’s race, class, feats, and skills. You know
who your character is and what he or she can do. But there’s one more
component your character needs — stuff. Just because a character knows
how to swing a spiked chain doesn’t mean that he or she is going to walk
around with one. All the training in the world won’t do your character 
any good if you don’t actually take a few minutes to equip him or her for
adventuring.
In this chapter, we tell you about the considerations you should keep in mind
when choosing your character’s equipment, and we show you some quick
optimal weapon and armor picks so that you can make good starting choices
and begin playing right away.
Chapter 7 in the Player’s Handbook tells you everything you could possibly
want to know about your choices in mundane adventuring gear, ranging from
weapons and armor to handy things like rope, grappling hooks, lanterns, and
tents. Magic items are defined later in the same chapter.

Going Shopping
Your 1st-level character begins with 100 gold pieces to outfit himself or her-
self for adventuring. To spend this money, you have to peruse the various
tables in Chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook, deciding what you want. Frankly,
picking out equipment can be a little tedious, and many of the minor details,
such as rations and a bedroll, are things that are never going to matter in
many normal DUNGEONS & DRAGONS games.
If possible, you should make sure that you buy the following equipment for
your character:
 A melee weapon (for example, a sword, mace, or dagger)
 A ranged weapon (bow, crossbow, or thrown weapon)
 The best suit of class-appropriate armor you can afford
 A shield (if your character is proficient in shields)
 Class-specific items (a holy symbol, wizard implement, or set of thieves’
tools)
 A light source such as torches, lantern and oil, or a sunrod
 A backpack with rope, rations, waterskin, and anything else you think
your character would need
If you want to do all this the quick and easy way, just use the packages we put
together for you in the “Sample starting gear” sidebar. If you decide to use
weapons different from the ones we present in our samples, you may need to
check the cost of the weapons you actually purchase for your character and
add or subtract the difference from the money left over.
210
Part II: Building a D&D Character 
Money in D&D
The basic unit of currency in D&D is the gold
piece, abbreviated as gp. When you see some-
thing that costs 15 gp, that’s 15 gold pieces.
Smaller in value than gold pieces are silver
pieces (sp); 1 gp is worth 10 sp. Less in value than
silver pieces are copper pieces (cp); 1 sp is worth
10 cp — but by that point, you really shouldn’t
care. Not many players actually keep track of
how many copper pieces are in their characters’
pockets. (An easy way to track money is to treat
gold pieces like dollars, silver pieces like dimes,
and copper pieces like pennies. So if your char-
acter has 4 gp, 6 sp, and 15 cp, it’s like $4.75.)
Currency that’s more valuable than gold pieces
becomes the norm when your character reaches
paragon or epic levels. Platinum pieces are
worth 100 gold pieces apiece. Astral diamonds
are worth 100 times that — each one is worth
10,000 gold pieces!

about getting caught in the dark, buy some extra
sunrods (2 gp apiece) or torches (10 for 1 gp).

Choosing the Right Weapon
For most characters, choosing the right weapons is an important part of
building your combat strategy and creating an unforgettable character.
Weapons have five important characteristics, as follows:
 Categories: This characteristic describes how complex the weapon is to
use. Weapons are organized into improvised, simple, martial, or superior
categories:
• Improvised weapons are things most characters don’t train with —
for example, rocks, chairs, candlesticks, or bare fists.
• Simple weapons are weapons that characters of almost any class
can use proficiently.
• Martial weapons require some training (for example, being a fighter).
• Superior weapons are weapons that no character is proficient in
without taking a specific Weapon Proficiency feat to learn to use
that weapon.
 Type: Type describes the weapon’s basic role and use. Weapons are
divided into melee weapons and ranged weapons; melee weapons are
divided again into one- and two-handed weapons. A character can use a
one-handed weapon and still use a shield, but your character can’t use 
a shield and a two-handed weapon at the same time.
 Proficiency: If your character is proficient with a weapon, you get a bonus
to attack rolls with that weapon — usually a +2 or +3. Some weapons are
more accurate than others. Your class description lists the weapons your
character is proficient with.
 Group: This is the weapon group to which the weapon belongs — for
example, axe, flail, light blade, or bow. Some character powers (espe-
cially fighter and rogue powers) work only if you’re using the right type
of weapon.
 Damage: This is the fun part. The weapon’s damage rating is expressed
as a die range: for example, a dagger deals d4 damage (1 to 4 points per
hit), but a greataxe deals d12 damage (1 to 12 points per hit). Bigger is
better.
In general, superior weapons are better than martial weapons, which are
better than simple weapons. And two-handed weapons deal out more damage
than one-handed weapons. Table 17-1 sums up the best weapon choices,
depending on your character’s class, whether you’re after a one-handed or
two-handed weapon, and whether you’re willing to spend a feat on a weapon
proficiency.

Dwarves enjoy some special advantages with weapon choices. All dwarves
are proficient with the throwing hammer and warhammer. A dwarf cleric
might as well use a warhammer as use a mace; the warhammer deals more
damage. Don’t use the warhammer if you’re playing a dwarf rogue, though —
many rogue powers require a light blade, and a warhammer is most definitely
not a light blade.
Elves also have an edge with weapon choices. All elves, regardless of class,
are proficient with the longbow and shortbow. If you’re playing an elf fighter,
this doesn’t help at all. But if you’re playing an elf rogue or cleric, you should
definitely choose longbow for your character’s ranged weapon. It doesn’t
even cost a feat.
Fighter weapons
A fighter pretty much has the pick of weapons. Fighters are proficient with
almost every weapon. If you don’t spend a Weapon Proficiency feat, the best
choices are the longsword (if you want your character to fight one-handed
and keep another hand free for a shield or second weapon) or greatsword (if
you want your character to deal more damage at the cost of some defense).
The battleaxe and warhammer are good replacements for the longsword, if
you prefer. The greataxe or falchion (a big two-handed scimitar, in case you’re
wondering) are reasonable substitutions for the greatsword.
If you’re willing to spend a feat on weapon proficiencies, get Weapon
Proficiency for the bastard sword or spiked chain. The bastard sword effec-
tively gives +1 damage above the longsword. The spiked chain deals less
damage than the greatsword, but your character will gain reach — the ability
to strike foes who aren’t standing next to him or her. That’s a major tactical
advantage. The spiked chain also can be used for a number of fancy maneu-
vers such as trip attacks.
213
Chapter 17: Choosing Armor, Weapons, and Gear

For a ranged weapon, you should rely on thrown weapons — javelins, han-
daxes, or throwing hammers. These are all “heavy thrown” weapons, so they
work as Strength attacks rather than Dexterity attacks.
Magic throwing weapons automatically come back to you after you throw
them. By the time you’re 4th or 5th level, you can probably afford to carry a
+1 handaxe in your belt. It’s a little insurance in case something happens to
your preferred melee weapon, and you’ll never be without the ability to
attack an enemy who’s just a few squares away.
You should also carry a longer-ranged projectile weapon such as a bow or
sling for that very rare combat situation where you can’t close with your ene-
mies and have to attack from 20 squares off. Slings are cheap and light, but
buy yourself a longbow when you can.
Rogue weapons
A rogue’s weapon choices are limited compared to the fighter’s choices, but
that’s okay. Whatever weapons rogues employ in battle aren’t anywhere near
as important as their sneak attack capability. When your character is dealing
10 or 15 points of damage from a sneak attack, the difference between a
weapon that averages 3 points a hit or 4 points a hit just isn’t that important.
If you don’t want to spend a feat on your rogue’s weapon choices, your melee
options are pretty simple: short sword or dagger. The short sword deals
more damage (d6), but the dagger is more accurate thanks to the Rogue
Weapon Talent class ability. It’s probably more important to score a hit than
to deal a little extra damage, so make the dagger your weapon of choice. If
you’re willing to spend a feat on Weapon Proficiency, learn to use the rapier.
It’s the most damaging of the light blades.
For a ranged weapon, your choices are the hand crossbow, sling, or shuriken.
The sling and hand crossbow are exactly the same, but the sling is much
cheaper, so go with the sling. Rogue Weapon Mastery gives the shuriken just
as much damage potential as the previous two weapons, but the shuriken has
better accuracy. The shuriken’s range is a little shorter, but many of the powers
you’ll use with the shuriken have ranges of 5 or less, so the shuriken’s short
range won’t be a problem. Go with the shuriken (but carry a sling just in case).
Cleric weapons
Weapons are tough for clerics. As a cleric, your character wants to be handy in
a fight, but he or she begins with proficiency only in simple weapons. A mace,
morningstar, or spear just doesn’t deal the same damage that a similarly sized
214
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

sword or axe deals, so you’re a little bit behind the eight-ball in your charac-
ter’s weapon selection. You should seriously consider using a feat so your
cleric can become proficient in a better weapon.
If you don’t want to spend a feat, choose the mace. It’s traditional. If you
choose to spend a feat on Weapon Proficiency, the bastard sword is your 
best choice. It’ll give you a +1 accuracy boost over the mace, and it deals
more damage too.
Take a sling or crossbow for your ranged weapon. The sling is dirt-cheap, but
the crossbow has better range and deals more damage. Either way, don’t
expect to get much use out of your ranged weapon. Most clerics have better
things to do in combat than take potshots with a crossbow.
Wizard weapons
Wizards are restricted to just two weapons: the dagger and quarterstaff. But
you know what? You don’t care if you’re playing a wizard. Most of a wizard’s
actions will be taken up with casting spells, so toting around an effective
melee weapon just isn’t necessary for this class.
If you really want to, you can take a Weapon Proficiency feat to get your char-
acter’s hands on a better weapon, but here’s the deal: A wizard is hardly ever
going to make melee attacks, so don’t waste a feat on this. (If you happen 
to be playing a dwarf wizard, though, your character is proficient with the
warhammer as a racial trait — so your character might as well carry one.)
You might have noticed that you have no ranged weapon options. If your
character needs to attack an enemy at range, use your magic missile spell (or
one of your other at-will powers). You never run out of at-wills, and it’s just
way more stylish to zap your enemies with glowing darts of magical energy
than to fumble around with a crossbow you’re no good at.
Choosing Armor
The other important decision you need to make in equipping your character
is what sort of armor you intend him or her to wear. Each character class
begins with proficiency in a different set of armor choices; for example, fight-
ers are proficient in any armor up to and including scale mail, whereas wiz-
ards are only proficient in cloth armor.
Beyond the question of proficiency, there are two basic decisions you need to
make when considering your choice of armor: shield or no shield, and light
versus heavy.
215
Chapter 17: Choosing Armor, Weapons, and Gear

Shield or no shield?
If you’re playing a fighter, you need to decide whether you want your character
to carry a shield. Shields are a great way to improve Armor Class by a couple 
of points, but by carrying a shield, your character is giving up some offense.
Instead of carrying a shield, your character could be swinging a two-handed
weapon that deals more damage. This is the difference between the Great
Weapon fighter build and the Guardian fighter build.
There really isn’t a right answer here. As they say, the best defense is a good
offense; building your character to dish out damage instead of taking it means
that he or she will kill enemies faster and give them fewer chances to put
damage on him or her. On the other hand, you’ll find that even 1 or 2 points of
extra Armor Class often results in a disproportionate reduction in the amount
of damage your character takes from enemy attacks. It’s really up to you.
Characters of other classes have to spend a feat on Light Shield Proficiency
to even think about picking up a shield. It’s probably worthwhile for a melee-
oriented cleric; +1 AC is worth a feat, after all. But don’t buy up to the heavy
shield, since you need to have a hand free to hold your holy symbol. With a
light shield, you can do that, but with a heavy shield, you can’t. You don’t
want your character to mess with spending actions to put away his or her
mace and take out the holy symbol when you decide you want to use a power
based on your divine implement rather than the weapon in your hand.
Light versus heavy
Here’s an important nuance of the D&D armor system: If you wear light armor,
you can add your character’s Dexterity or Intelligence modifier to your
Armor Class; if you wear heavy armor, you can’t. But heavy armor offers 
an armor bonus that’s much better than the one provided by light armor.
To get the best Armor Class possible, you have to decide whether your
Dexterity or Intelligence score is high enough to overcome the difference
between light armor AC bonuses and heavy armor AC bonuses. As it turns
out, the best light armor available at low levels is hide armor (+3 armor
bonus). The worst heavy armor at the same levels is chainmail (+6 armor
bonus). So, if your ability score can add at least a +3 ability modifier to your
armor class, you’ll break even on AC. Therefore, if either your Dexterity score
or your Intelligence score is at least 16, go with light armor. Otherwise, wear
heavy armor — assuming, of course, that your character is proficient in some
type of heavy armor.
In addition to negating your ability score modifier, heavy armor slows your
character down and usually imposes a small penalty on physical skill checks
216
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

such as Acrobatics or Athletics. When you’re weighing armor choices, you
need to decide whether you care about having your character’s movement
reduced by wearing heavy armor.
Table 16-2 provides an overview of the best armor choices by class (the first
column) and the best armor choices if you invest a feat in Armor Training.

If you’re playing a dwarf, you don’t care about the speed penalty of heavy
armor. Dwarves get to ignore the movement penalty for wearing heavy armor,
so unless you’re playing a dwarf with a very high Intelligence or Dexterity
score, your character might as well wear the heaviest armor he or she can
afford.
217
Chapter 17: Choosing Armor, Weapons, and Gear
Armor choices for other classes
Players who have characters of other classes
have some different choices to weigh when pick-
ing out armor. Here are a few quick guidelines:
 Paladin: Invest in plate armor and a heavy
shield. It’s costly, but you should take
advantage of the fact that you can use the
best armor in the game.
 Ranger: Go with hide armor. You take a –1
penalty on a few skill checks, but the +1 AC
as compared with leather armor is worth it.
 Warlock: You can wear leather armor, and
you should. Later in your career, you can
decide whether to spend feats to improve
your armor options.
 Warlord: If your Intelligence or Dexterity
score is 16 or better, wear hide armor; oth-
erwise, wear chain armor. Take a light
shield. You should think about using feats to
gain heavy shield proficiency, or you should
improve your chain armor to scale armor.

Everything Else Your Character 
Is Carrying
Your choices of armor and weapons are important, but they’re not all that’s
involved in equipping your character. Dungeon exploration requires a lot of
specialized gear, and you’ll want to make sure that your character is carrying
everything he or she will need to survive in the hostile environment of a 
monster-filled dungeon.
Watch out! You might not realize it, but your character class might demand
specialized gear to accomplish its basic purpose. There are four prime exam-
ples of this:
 Rogues require thieves’ tools (20 gp) to use the Thievery skill properly.
 Clerics require a holy symbol (10 gp) to better use many of their powers.
 Wizards require a spellbook to keep their daily spells, utility spells, and
rituals. They also require an arcane implement (orb, staff, or wand; 15
gp, 12 gp, or 5 gp, respectively) to better cast their spells.
 Clerics and wizards require ritual components in order to make use of the
rituals they know. For a 1st-level character, you can get by with 20 to 40
gold pieces’ worth of arcane reagents, mystic salves, or sanctified incense.
That will see you through the first couple of times your character uses a
ritual.
At the very minimum, make sure your character’s miscellaneous equipment
includes the noted item if you’re playing a member of that class.
Useful gear
These things won’t make your character fight better, but they’re darned
useful for successful dungeon exploration. Every adventurer should carry a
light source, a rope, and a useful tool or two such as a grappling hook, crow-
bar, hammer and pitons, flint and steel, and so on. Not everyone in the party
needs to carry one of each of these things — divvy out these tools among the
party.
A light source is particularly important because most races can’t see a thing
in complete darkness. You have four good, cheap choices at the beginning of
your character’s career: torch, lantern, sunrod, or magic (a wizard’s light spell).
218
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Magic is a good emergency measure, but you shouldn’t rely on it exclusively.
You don’t want the whole party to be stranded in pitch blackness just because
the wizard got eaten by a grick.
Of the nonmagical alternatives, torches are heavy and don’t light up a very
large area, but they’re cheap. Lanterns are more expensive but provide better
light and usually last longer. In addition, you can set all kinds of things on fire
with a few flasks of lamp oil. Trust us; we’ve seen it done. Your best non-
magical alternative is probably the sunrod. Sunrods are alchemical devices
that provide a bright, long-lasting light without the need for oil. They’re
expensive (2 gp apiece) but give four hours of illumination at a time.
Oh, and one more thing: Don’t forget the rope. Every member of the party
should carry at least 50 feet, preferably 100 feet or more, of rope. Because so
many dungeons feature difficult vertical obstacles, you just can’t skimp on
the rope. With enough rope, only one character in the party needs to be a
good climber — everybody else can follow the best climber after he or she
fixes a rope in place.
Write it down and forget it
Ever been camping? If so, you’ve probably got half an idea of what your char-
acter likely goes through every day when he or she is off exploring vast
wildernesses or delving for weeks into a fearsome dungeon. Anybody going
away from civilization for a few days carries something to sleep on or in,
food, water, camp tools, and so on.
So, just for form’s sake, you should probably write a few things on your char-
acter sheet, such as “backpack, bedroll, 3 days’ rations, 2 waterskins, flint
and steel.” Or, better yet, just buy the standard adventurer’s kit at the top of
the Adventuring Gear list in Chapter 7 of the Player’s Handbook. There. That’s
all it takes. The vast majority of Dungeon Masters will never challenge you on
this, and you’ll never actually concern yourself with this mundane gear again.
But you’ll be able to say that your character has it.
You might be tempted to write down a whole general store worth of tools,
rations, special items, and miscellaneous junk, but remember — your charac-
ter needs to carry everything. Check page 222 in the Player’s Handbook, and
you’ll see that characters have a finite limit on how much weight they can
carry. Again, not many DMs will think to enforce this rule, but some do, so
don’t be embarrassed by being caught with 860 pounds of gear on your 13-
Strength rogue. (If you like the idea of carrying around the whole general
store on your back, consider investing in magic items such as a bag of holding
or a handy haversack later in your character’s career.)
219
Chapter 17: Choosing Armor, Weapons, and Gear

Improving Weapons and Armor
Your character’s equipment at 1st level is nothing remarkable. Your character
hasn’t yet found the great piles of treasure that will let him or her buy really
good armor or powerful magic weapons. But within a level or two, you’re
going to want to upgrade your character’s weapons and armor to the best he
or she can afford to own. In DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, your character doesn’t keep
treasure; he or she spends it to buy better weapons and armor so that he or
she can find even bigger treasures and buy even better weapons and armor.
Masterwork armors
You may have noticed that the armor table in Chapter 7 of the Player’s
Handbook includes some very unusual entries — for example, dragonscale
armor, warplate armor, or starweave armor. The cost for each is simply “spe-
cial.” All these unusual armor types are known as masterwork armor.
220
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Masterwork armors have a “minimum magic bonus,” which means you never
just find a suit of warplate armor; the least valuable set of warplate armor you
can ever have is +4 warplate armor. A suit of +4 armor is a 16th-level magic
item worth 45,000 gp. Eventually your character may find a suit of master-
work armor or amass enough wealth to buy some, but you have a lot of
adventuring ahead of you first.
Magical arms and armor
The best way to improve your character’s attack rolls and AC is to get his or
her hands on a good magical weapon and a suit of magical armor. Magical
weaponry is expensive stuff, but you’ll find that you absolutely need it if your
character is going to have a fighting chance of dealing with the game’s more
dangerous monsters. See Chapter 20 for more details.
Magical weapons carry a bonus to attack and damage rolls, ranging from +1
to +5 or more. So when you hear someone at the table boasting about his 
+3 sword, what he’s saying is that his character has a sword that gives a +3
bonus on attack and damage rolls. That’s a good sword. Similarly, magical
armor carries a bonus to AC ranging from +1 to +5 or more. For example, a
suit of chainmail normally provides an AC bonus of +6, but a suit of +2 chain-
mail gives an AC bonus of 8. Magic weapons or armor with an enhancement
bonus of +1 are 1st-level magic items and cost 360 gp each. Because you start
with only 100 gp to spend as a 1st-level character, you can see that you’ll
have to liberate some monster-guarded treasure hoards if you want to arm
yourself with magic armor and weapons.
221
Chapter 17: Choosing Armor, Weapons, and Gear
Equipping higher-level characters
If you’re creating a higher-level character to join
an existing game, you’ll find that the agonizing
decisions of the typical impoverished 1st-level
character are simply a thing of the past. High-
level characters typically have thousands of
gold pieces worth of equipment, including
magic weapons, armor, potions, and other such
wondrous possessions.
To equip a higher-level character, you should ask
your DM how much money your character has
to spend. Then ask for the DM’s help in picking
out suitable magic items for your character.
Remember, if your character doesn’t have a
magic weapon or magic armor, you’ll need to
pick out nonmagical gear to serve. Make sure
that you review the bulleted list in the “Going
Shopping” section of this chapter and equip your
character with magical or nonmagical versions
of everything on the list.

Advancing Your Character
In This Chapter
 Discovering how your character earns experience points
 Examining what happens when your character gains a level
 Exploring paragon paths and epic destinies
C
haracters in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are not static. They grow and
develop the longer you play the game. That’s one of the key aspects of
the game — like the heroes of a novel, movie, or television series, your char-
acters learn, grow, and are influenced by past and present events.
In this chapter, we explore the concept of experience points (XP) and gaining
levels, examining how and in what ways your character improves. We go over
the process of “leveling up” and show you how to add your new goodies to
your character. Finally, we look at paragon paths and epic destinies, the pin-
nacle that every character can strive to achieve.
The Character Advancement table in Chapter 2 of the Player’s Handbook
(page 29) is your one-stop reference for determining what your character
gets at each and every experience level. Paragon paths for each character
class are described in Chapter 4 at the end of each class section. Epic des-
tinies for all character classes are found at the end of Chapter 4.
Gaining Experience Points
Experience points (XP for short) measure a character’s accomplishments.
They represent both training and learning by doing. In the fantasy worlds of
D&D, experience has a direct correlation to power. Characters earn experience
points by defeating opponents and otherwise overcoming the challenges that
the Dungeon Master places before them. When a character has earned a spe-
cific number of XP, as detailed on the Character Advancement table on page 29
of the Player’s Handbook, he or she gains a new level. Table 18-1 shows the first
couple of stops on the path to greatness.

Where do XP come from?
Every monster and opponent in the game comes with an XP award based on
its level. A monster’s level is a rating of how easy or difficult a monster is to
overcome, and it roughly corresponds to the level of player characters who
ought to be fighting it. For example, the roper is a level-14 monster, so it’s
intended to be a challenge when the adventuring party is around 14th level.
It’s way too tough for 4th-level characters, and it’s a pushover for 24th-level
characters. Traps, obstacles, other challenges, and quests are also assigned
levels and award XP, as described in Chapters 5 and 7 of the Dungeon Master’s
Guide.
The DM decides when a challenge has been overcome. Usually, this means
when a battle has been won or a trap disarmed, but clever players can come
up with all kinds of ways for their characters to overcome the challenge of
the moment. If the party successfully slips by the hobgoblins guarding the
corridor by using stealth and clever distractions, the DM can determine that
the characters have overcome this challenge and reward them experience
points accordingly.
All characters that take part in an encounter gain XP for that encounter.
Remember that encounters come in three forms: a challenge, combat, or role-
playing encounter that is integral to the plot of the adventure. DMs usually
award XP at the end of each encounter, although awarding XP at the end of a
game session works too.
For the Dungeon Master
The DM usually awards experience points at the end of an encounter, but
some DMs dole out awards at the end of a game session. Training and
advancement, however, should still take place between game sessions or 
224
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

at the beginning or end of a game session. If you have a good breakpoint in
the action — for example, the PCs are planning to go back to town for a bit
before returning to the dungeon — it’s okay to let player characters level up
in the middle of the game session.
To determine the XP award for an encounter, follow these steps (which are
described more fully in Chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide):
1. Determine the XP value of each monster, trap, or obstacle in the
encounter.
In the case of monsters and traps, the XP award is right at the top of the
monster stat block or trap description.
2. Total the XP values of the monsters, traps, and obstacles in the
encounter.
3. Divide the XP total by the number of characters in the party.
The result is the amount of XP that each character receives for helping
to overcome the encounter. Round fractions normally.
Gaining Levels
Your character becomes more powerful as he or she rises in level. At higher
levels, your character hits better, defends better, becomes harder to kill, and
gains new and more powerful abilities. Using the Player’s Handbook, you can
advance your character from 1st level to 30th level over the course of a cam-
paign. A character’s level provides other benefits and essential information,
as described in the next few sections.
225
Chapter 18: Advancing Your Character
What is monster level?
Every monster or obstacle the player characters
have to deal with in an adventure has a level.
Generally speaking, a good combat encounter
consists of monsters equal in level to the level of
the player characters, and equal in number to the
number of characters in the party. In other
words, with reasonable luck and a bit of skill, an
average party should overcome a similar number
of creatures or obstacles of their own level with
some damage and expenditure of resources. A
party of five 4th-level characters, for example,
should be able to get through an encounter with
five 4th-level standard monsters or traps with a
few resources expended but without suffering
any casualties.

Ability score increases
Characters increase their ability scores as they advance in level. A character
can increase any two ability scores by 1 point every time he or she attains a
level ending in 4 or 8. That means that Lidda, a halfling rogue, increases two
of her ability scores by 1 point each at 4th, 8th, 14th, 18th, 24th, and 28th
level. So, upon achieving 4th level, Lidda’s player can increase her Dexterity
score from 17 to 18 and her Charisma score from 14 to 15. In addition, when
your character reaches 11th level and 21st level, you add 1 to all the charac-
ter’s ability scores. It’s good to reach paragon or epic level! (For more on 
ability scores, see Chapter 13.)
Level modifier
Your character’s level modifier represents the sheer skill his or her experience
confers. It’s a bonus equal to half the character’s level, rounded down — so, in
other words, +1 at 2nd level, +2 at 4th level, +3 at 6th level, and so on. You get
to add the level modifier to every attack roll your character makes, to all your
character’s defenses, and to every skill check your character attempts.
New powers
Your character learns new powers as he or she gains levels, as shown on the
Character Advancement table (page 29 of the Player’s Handbook). For exam-
ple, when Jozan, a human cleric, reaches 2nd level, he learns a 2nd-level util-
ity power; when he reaches 3rd level, he learns a new 3rd-level encounter
power; and when he reaches 5th level, he learns a new 5th-level daily power.
Some levels — for example, 4th level — don’t offer you the chance to learn
new powers, but you gain other good stuff at those levels.
Unfortunately, you don’t get to keep adding powers forever. Eventually you
reach a point for encounter and daily powers where you gain access to a new
level of power selections, but you don’t gain any more “slots.” You have to
drop one of your old powers and replace it with your new selection. This
comes at 13th level for encounter powers and 15th level for daily powers.
Usually, you just drop your old 1st-level powers when you reach these points;
you’ve outgrown them. Higher-level powers are usually much better than
lower-level powers, so this isn’t much of a hardship for your character.
Chapter 14 in this book has more detail about powers.
226
Part II: Building a D&D Character 

Feats
Characters gain feats according to level. All characters start with one feat at
1st level. Each character can select a new feat every time he or she attains an
even-numbered level. That means that Regdar, a human fighter, selects new
feats at 2nd level, 4th level, 6th level, and so on.
In addition, all characters get to select a feat when they reach 11th level (wel-
come to paragon tier!) and again at 21st level (welcome to epic tier!). When
you reach a new tier, you gain a whole new menu of feats to choose from
because feats are organized into heroic, paragon, and epic feats. Naturally,
paragon and epic feats are better than heroic feats. For more on feats, see
Chapter 15.
Advancing a Level
Your character can advance to the next level when your XP total reaches the
minimum amount needed according to the Character Advancement table in
the Player’s Handbook. Regdar, for example, can go from 1st to 2nd level when
he accumulates at least 1,000 XP. Going up a level provides a number of imme-
diate benefits that demonstrate that the character has learned and improved
in some way.
Imagine that your character spends time between adventures training, study-
ing, and practicing his or her skills. Even if your character achieves the 
necessary XP milestone, he or she can’t go up a level in the middle of an
encounter. In game terms, this means that you have to wait until the DM
allows your character a brief respite before you can level up. The end of a
game session is a great time to level up, but if your DM is willing to give your
characters a break in the action, you might be able to level up immediately
after winning the encounter that gave you the XP to get over the top. That’s
up to the DM and the kind of game he or she wants to run.
When your character has earned the necessary XP to go up a level, grab your
character sheet and your Player’s Handbook and follow these steps:
1. Depending on the level your character gained, adjust his or her ability
scores.
When your character attains 4th, 8th, 14th, 18th, 24th, and 28th level,
choose two abilities and increase each by 1 point. When your character
reaches 11th level, and again at 21st level, add 1 point to all your ability
scores.
227
Chapter 18: Advancing Your Character

Check the Ability Modifier table (page 17 of the Player’s Handbook) to
see whether modifiers associated with any of your improved abilities
need to be adjusted.
2. Depending on the level your character gained, adjust your level modi-
fiers for attack, defense, and skill bonuses.
Your character’s level modifier is equal to half your level (rounded down),
so each time you hit an even-numbered level, your level modifier goes 
up. Level modifier figures into your defenses, your attacks, and your skill
checks. If your level modifier improves, modify your attack, defense, and
skill bonuses accordingly.
3. At 11th or 21st level, choose your paragon path or epic destiny,
respectively.
If you just reached 11th level, you get to pick a paragon path for your
character. Each character class description in Chapter 4 of the Player’s
Handbook includes several paragon paths to pick from. If you just
reached 21st level, select an epic destiny. These are described at the 
end of Chapter 4 in the Player’s Handbook. We take a look at paragon
paths and epic destinies in Chapter 22 in this book.
4. Increase your hit points.
Your class description tells you how many hit points your character
gains each time he or she advances a level. For example, a fighter gains 
6 hit points at each level.
5. Update your class features.
Check your class description for class features that improve with level.
For example, at 16th level, a cleric can use his or her healing word power
three times per encounter instead of just twice.
6. Depending on the level your character gained, choose your new feat.
When your character reaches an even-numbered level, you gain one feat
of your choice. Make sure that your character meets any prerequisites
the feat requires.
7. Get your new power.
All characters learn additional powers as they advance. Check the
Character Advancement table (page 29 of the Player’s Handbook) to 
see what kind of power to add to your character’s repertoire at his 
or her new level.

UNGEONS & DRAGONS is a complex game that pre-
sents your character with an infinite variety of chal-
lenges. In this part of the book, you graduate from the
basics of how to play and how to create a character into
the study of how to play the game well. You can play the
game at a basic level (see the monster, hit the monster)
and have plenty of fun, but if you want to find out how to
take on the toughest opponents and win, how to forge
your adventuring party into a tight team of specialists who
can take on any challenge, and how to immerse yourself in
the imagination and fun of the game, this part is for you.

 Picking the right way to beat the monsters
 Managing your best powers

T
he point of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is to have fun, be creative, and
engage in a little healthy escapism. But D&D is a game, and just like any
game, you can play it well or you can play it poorly. Many people have a great
time making bad choices and exploring those consequences, but we’re guess-
ing that you want to play to win — or at least do your best to maximize your
character’s impact on the game.
There are two good ways to play the game smart: Build effective characters
(we talk more about that in Chapter 22), and fight your best fight. Any charac-
ter can shine for a battle with some lucky combat rolls, but if you consistently
select the best and most efficient actions for your character round after round,
you won’t need lucky die rolls to excel.
In this chapter, we tell you about the right way to approach battles and
encounters, and we show you how to come up with a winning strategy for
almost any fight.
Choosing the Right Weapon for the Job
Choosing the right weapon for the situation at hand doesn’t mean carrying
around a bag of holding full of magic weapons and pulling out the most effec-
tive one for each foe. It means finding your enemy’s weakness and targeting
it. This strategy goes all the way back to Sun Tzu: Don’t throw strength at
strength if there’s a better option available. Your high-powered fighter might

be able to cut his or her way through a roomful of hill giants, but melee combat
is what hill giants do best. You would be better off to use powers that attack
Will defense at a long range, because giants generally can stand up to a lot
more physical abuse than mental attacks.
The four basic strategies for defeating foes in the D&D game are hit point
attrition, action denial, maneuver, and diplomacy.
Killing ’em quickly: Attacking hit points
Use melee attacks, ranged attacks, and damage-causing powers such as magic
missile or flame strike to reduce your opponents’ hit points to zero as fast as
possible. This strategy works best against foes with low hit points or foes who
don’t have much ability to hurt your character while the party goes through
their hit points. It’s a bad strategy to use against brutes and soldiers (big
strong monsters who frankly are looking for a chance to mix it up with your
party).
This is the default strategy for almost any monster: If you don’t know what
else to do, make attacks and knock down your enemy’s hit points. Sooner or
later, you’ll win.
Playing for time: Action-denial powers
In this combat strategy, lead with powers that keep the monsters from acting
effectively, such as command or web. Ultimately you defeat the monsters in
pretty much the same way as before — you deplete their hit points — but the
goal here is damage mitigation; you want to prevent the monsters from getting
good shots on you while you’re wearing them down. Ideally, you’ll tie the mon-
sters up so badly with effects that daze, stun, or immobilize them that they
won’t be able to lay a finger on you.
Good action-denial effects include
 Daze or stun
 Knock prone (especially when combined with push or slide against mon-
sters without good ranged attacks)
 Weaken
 Slow or immobilize (best against monsters without good ranged attacks)
 Restrain
 Blind
232
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Action denial works best in encounters where one or two of the monsters
pose a much more serious threat than the other monsters. Don’t waste an
action-denial effect like command on a lowly goblin minion or a goblin skir-
misher; use it on the goblin chieftain or the hobgoblin warcaster, the crea-
tures in that encounter that can really hurt you. Action denial is especially
effective against elite and solo monsters — monsters who are significantly
tougher than normal monsters. Typically, an encounter with an elite or solo
monster means that you’re dealing with a smaller number of tougher mon-
sters, so denying monsters actions has a bigger effect on the battle (although
most elite and solo monsters have some special defense against action denial
in the form of big saving throw bonuses).
Beating ’em with footwork: Maneuver
Many foes can be avoided through an artful maneuver, especially if your char-
acter or another in the party has useful ritual magic at hand. If nothing else,
you might be able to maneuver your character into a position from which he
or she can attack a foe with little chance of being hit back. For example, if the
opponent is a powerful brute with no ranged attacks (say, an ogre warhulk),
use flying magic and attack it safely with ranged weapons and powers.
The true coup of maneuver, of course, is to simply bypass a fight you don’t
need to fight. If the evil lord surrounds his castle with a moat of giant croco-
diles, why would you slog your way through the monsters when you might go
around, over, or through them without fighting? Powers such as arcane gate or
levitate are obvious mechanisms for winning an encounter through maneuver,
but don’t overlook the rogue’s knack for sneaking through dangerous places
with the Stealth skill, or powers that disguise or hide you from your foes.
Maneuvering works best on enemies who are stuck in place. (There’s not much
point in avoiding a pack of hell hounds if they’ll just follow the party to the next
room and attack them there.) It’s also the best way for dealing with enemies
who are simply too dangerous to fight.
Winning with a smile: Negotiation
Sometimes you can simply talk your way past an obstacle. If your character 
is facing a roomful of orc warriors, he or she might be able to convince them
that the adventuring party is far too dangerous to attack with a display of
astounding bravado (and a good Bluff or Intimidate check). Or your charac-
ter might persuade them that it’s in their own best interests to let the party
continue through the dungeon unmolested so that the party can deal with a
rival gang of monsters the orcs might want out of the way — a good use of
the Diplomacy skill.
233
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

Negotiation works best on intelligent adversaries, but don’t rule out negotia-
tion tactics against non-intelligent monsters. A character might use the Handle
Animal function of the Nature skill to get a party of adventurers past a danger-
ous and ill-tempered creature such as a dire bear or giant crocodile. And, even
if you’re not particularly skilled in calming wild animals, throwing a big haunch
of meat to the evil tyrant’s dire wolf might serve as well as a bribe of gold
would for an intelligent guardian.
Many Dungeon Masters require you to attempt skill checks in skills such as
Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate in order to carry off a negotiation strategy.
However, some DMs deliberately avoid using the skill challenge rules to
resolve these encounters: They want you, the player, to explain exactly what
your character says, and then they’ll decide if they think you were convincing
enough for your character to succeed in his or her efforts to talk to the mon-
sters. Other DMs combine skill checks with roleplaying, letting good rolls 
bolster weak roleplaying or vice-versa. Each method is a reasonable way for
the DM to handle a negotiation — you’ll just have to see which way your DM
prefers to play encounters like this.
Bugging out: Knowing when to retreat
Even the best D&D players tend to forget that running away is an option. Very
few challenges in the game are worth getting a player character killed. If the
situation is so grim that it seems likely that one or more characters will die,
extricate the party from the battle and come back to fight another day after
your characters have healed up and made the right preparations for dealing
with whatever dangerous adversary forced the retreat.
Warning signs that you should watch out for include
 One or more player characters are rendered helpless.
 Two or more player characters are bloodied, with no prospect of healing
back up to full.
 Half the player characters are out of daily attack powers and encounter
attack powers.
 Three straight rounds go by in a fight where no player character damages
an adversary.
Whether or not you heed these warning signs is up to you. Sometimes,
retreat simply isn’t an option. Other times, you might need to fight on past
the warning signs because you’ll put your character at greater risk in trying
to retreat than you would by trying to win the fight.

Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Managing Expendable Powers 
and Resources
All your character’s abilities fall into three basic categories: things you can
do at will, things you can do once per encounter, and things you can do once
per day. Powers and abilities that can be used up — either in the encounter
at hand or for the whole day’s adventuring — are expendable resources.
Usually, your expendable resources fall into three basic categories:
 Attack powers (encounter or daily)
 Utility powers (encounter or daily)
 Magic item powers (encounter or daily)
To play your best game, you want to meet each challenge or encounter you
face with an appropriate use of your resources. You don’t want your charac-
ter to get killed because he or she was hoarding a resource for possible use
later, and you don’t want your character to get killed because he or she is out
of resources that were spent too freely in earlier encounters. Knowing when
to pull the trigger on a rare but powerful resource and when to save your big
guns is one of the ways you can play the game well.
Fire away: Using encounter powers
Encounter powers are fairly easy to manage. Here’s the deal: In every encount-
er your character meets, you want to use all your encounter powers. If your
character finishes the fight with some encounter powers unused, you let the
monsters off easy. Sometimes you can’t help it, of course; your cleric can use
healing word twice per encounter, but if the monsters happen to miss a lot in
this fight, there might be no call for a healing prayer.
It’s okay to be aggressive in using your encounter powers because you’re
expending them only for the encounter in which you’re currently engaged. 
As soon as that battle is over, you regain all your used-up encounter powers
with a short rest. The trick to managing your encounter powers is simply
deciding when in the battle to use them. As your turn approaches each
round, ask yourself: Is this the right round to use an encounter power?
Use an encounter power if . . .
 You want to do more damage than you would with your at-will powers,
or you need to attack a defense that your at-will powers don’t target.
235
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

 You have a perfect situation for it. (For example, you have a melee power
that targets two enemies, and you have a couple of monsters in just the
right place to use it.)
 It’s early in the fight and you’re not sure how tough this encounter is yet.
(You want to use your encounter powers anyway, so you might as well
get started.)
Don’t use an encounter power if . . .
 The situation appears dire enough to warrant a daily power.
 Your available encounter powers are unsuited to the tactical situation.
(For example, you can hit only one target with a power that normally
could affect two or three targets.)
 You have an at-will power that will do the job as well as any of your
encounter powers.
Hold on, there: Using daily powers
Daily powers are much harder to manage than encounter powers. You want to
make sure that you use all your daily powers during each day of adventuring,
but a day of adventuring might include one combat encounter or five combat
encounters. All too often, you can’t predict how many more encounters your
character will battle through until you hit the last one and realize that you’re
really out of gas. You don’t want to bring unused daily powers “back to the
barn,” but you really don’t want to get into a battle where you desperately
need daily powers you’ve already used up.
If the trick to using encounter powers is deciding which round of the fight
deserves an encounter power, the trick to using daily powers is to decide
which encounter of the day deserves a daily power. Don’t use them up in
easy encounters; if it looks like you can fight through just using at-will and
encounter powers, hang on to your daily powers for later.
Remember, your daily powers are a party resource as well as a character
resource. If the party has five characters with two daily attack powers each,
you have ten daily powers to spend among yourselves. Normally, an adven-
turing party should shoot for getting through four to six encounters before
the characters think about resting. That means the whole party should spend
maybe one to three daily powers per encounter. If you’ve seen two or three
other characters use their daily powers in a fight, it’s time to hoard yours for
the next battle — unless the situation is desperate and nothing less will do.
Here are a few good tips on pacing your daily powers:
236
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

 Don’t use your daily powers in easy fights.
 The earlier in the fight you identify the need for a daily power, the better.
Many daily powers have benefits that last for the duration of the en-
counter, so it’s better to use them early in the fight in order to maximize
the effect they have on that battle.
 Unless you’re desperate, make sure that you don’t sell a daily power
short by using it when conditions aren’t favorable. For example, if
you’ve got a daily power that might let you attack three or four monsters
at once, don’t use it to attack just one monster.
 If an encounter is going badly, use your daily powers freely. Better to run
out of daily powers than to let the monsters defeat you while your best
powers are still unused.
Putting It All Together: Developing 
Your Combat Strategy
Every time your character gets into a scrape, you should have an idea of
what you’re trying to accomplish and how you want to go about it. That
means formulating a combat strategy early in the fight. Here’s a quick and
dirty primer on combat strategy:
Step 1: Define the situation
Identify what sort of fight you’re facing by figuring out whether anyone is sur-
prised and what sort of terrain you’re fighting on.
237
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight
The default management strategy
If managing your character’s encounter and
daily powers all seems pretty intimidating to
you, here’s an easy way to handle them that
works well in most combat encounters: Begin
the fight with an encounter power in your first
round or two. You want to make sure you use
them in most fights, and this gives you time to
evaluate how dangerous the fight really is. If the
encounter looks tough a couple of rounds in, it’s
time to bust out a daily power. On the other
hand, if the fight looks to be under control after
those first couple of rounds, save your daily
powers and fall back to at-will attacks when
your encounter powers run out.

When you’re determining surprise, you must figure out who got the jump on
whom. Do you even have a choice about this fight? Here are some guidelines
to keep in mind:
 We got ambushed. The bad guys jumped out of the darkness and attacked
your party without warning. Your first step should be to limit the damage
the monsters are dealing to the party by drawing back or using defensive
powers. Only when you’re sure that your character or another player
character in the party is not going to get killed do you turn to serious
offense.
 We just ran into them. Neither side has an advantage. These situations
are dangerous because you might not realize how much trouble the
party is in until you’re several rounds into the fight and you don’t have
any good escape options open. Fight defensively until you know that it’s
safe to shift over to offense.
 They’re in our way. The monsters are obstacles the party has to get past,
but you have time to get ready for a fair fight. This type of encounter pre-
sents the best maneuver or negotiation opportunities; if you decide to
make it a fight, look for ways to stack the odds in your favor (or maybe
even change it into an ambush; see the next bullet).
 We ambushed them. You have time to hide and set up a surprise attack
of your own. Lay down as much hurt as you can as fast as you can so
that the monsters don’t get any real chance to fight back.
Where are you fighting? Does the ground favor your party or the other side?
Does the party have an easy way to get out if things go bad? Terrain affects
combat in myriad ways. Here are some guidelines:
 Obstructed: You’re fighting in tight spaces or with little room to maneu-
ver. Make sure that you control the battlefield by using walls and obsta-
cles to keep enemies from getting around your character or other
characters in the party.
 Wide open: There’s no place to hide. If your party is faster than the
monsters, don’t let them close to the party until you’re ready. If your
party is slower, try to bog down your foes in melee combat or by using
powers that slow enemies or create difficult terrain for them to cross.
 Grossly unfair: Your party is hanging on a cliff, fighting against harpies,
rocs, or something else with wings. Back off and try it again when you’ve
taken steps to make it a fair fight. For example, maybe the wizard can hit
his spellbook to find a couple of utility powers that will help even the
odds.
238
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Step 2: Evaluate your foes
Study the monsters you’re facing and determine each one’s role: brute, sol-
dier, lurker, artillery, controller, skirmisher, or minion. In many encounters,
the monsters include representatives of two or three different monstrous
roles. Don’t forget to take a quick head count and determine whether your
party is outnumbered. Take special note of the following roles:
 Brutes and soldiers: They’re big, strong melee machines. Gangs of orc
warriors, evil fighters, ogres or trolls, or physically powerful creatures
such as dire bears all fall into this group. Brutes hit hard and have a lot
of hit points but are usually easy to hit. Soldiers usually have higher
defenses than brutes but not as many hit points.
 Lurkers: The lurker monsters are dangerous when they catch your party
by surprise, but they aren’t much for a stand-up fight.
 Artillery: These monsters prefer to attack at range, using either missile
weapons, magical powers, or innate abilities. Goblin archers, flameskulls,
or spined devils are all good examples.
 Controllers: These monsters have special attacks that inflicts various
types of action denial against the heroes — for example, monsters that
stun or slow their targets, or monsters that create difficult or dangerous
terrain around their targets.
 Skirmishers: The skirmisher monsters are highly mobile and have good
melee attack power, but their best defense against counterattack is
moving away again. They have abilities that let them get around the
party’s front line and threaten rear-rank characters.
 Minions: These monsters are mostly cannon fodder, creatures that pose
a threat in large numbers but are individually easy to eliminate.
 No threat: These monsters aren’t a real threat to your party. They might
outnumber you, but they’re individually too weak to hurt anyone in the
party.
Step 3: Choose the right tactic
Decide what method will give you the best odds of victory, depending on
your foes, such as
 Brutes and soldiers: Maneuver and action denial are your best ploys.
You don’t want to give these monsters a fair fight at close range since
that’s what they excel at. Try to keep them immobilized at a short dis-
tance and soften them up with ranged attacks and powers.
239
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

 Lurkers: Assuming your party was ambushed, it’s too late for maneuver
or negotiation. Use action denial to slow down their attacks against you,
and then lock them up in melee and deal damage.
 Artillery: Many artillery monsters are less effective in close combat.
Maneuver to close the range, and reduce their hit points with melee
attacks.
 Controllers: Like artillery, many controller monsters are less dangerous
in melee. However, the control effects they use against you often keep
you from getting close to them. Use ranged attacks and powers to deal
damage from a distance if you can’t get close to melee range.
 Skirmishers: You’re not likely to out-maneuver skirmishers, so take
away their mobility with action denial attacks. When you have them
where you want them, you can keep them engaged in melee.
 Minions: Area attacks that deal damage on a hit are really good for
taking out minions quickly.
 No threat: Save your daily powers and take out these monsters with 
at-will or encounter attacks. Don’t bother with very weak monsters,
however, until you’ve contained the threat of more powerful monsters 
in the encounter.
240
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Step 4: Rethink your assumptions
At the end of every round, you should reassess the battle and figure out
whether any of your basic assumptions about the fight have changed. Did 
the monsters get reinforcements? Have you found a spot of good terrain that
gives your character an advantage? Were the monsters no real threat at all? 
Is this a fight you should run away from? Rethink your assumptions every
round to make sure you’re still fighting the right fight.
Using Advanced Tactics
If all you ever do is pick the right target for your character’s powers, manage
your expendable and daily powers well, attack efficiently, and consider the
occasional tactical retreat, you’re already better off than a significant number
of experienced players. You might have noticed that the preceding advice is
fairly generic. In this section, we talk about a few specific artifacts of the D&D
rules that you can master in order to play your best game.
Flanking
Flanking is the first and easiest of the advanced tactics you should put to
work. If your character and your allies are fighting the same foe, make sure
that someone gets on the monster’s opposite side. Now your character and
your flanking buddy each gain combat advantage against that target, which
means a +2 bonus to melee attacks. Better yet, if your character (or your
friend’s character) is a rogue, every attack he or she makes against that
target deals sneak attack damage.
Flanking is described on page 285 of the Player’s Handbook.
Powers that allow you to shift (move without provoking opportunity attacks)
are a great way to slip around the monster to a flanking position without get-
ting mauled by opportunity attacks (more about those later in this chapter).
Beating the initiative order
The novice player assumes that it’s always better to take his or her turn as
early as possible in the round. We’re working on making you smarter than
that. Sometimes you can manufacture significant tactical advantages by
readying actions or delaying your character’s actions.
241
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

Delaying or readying your action lets you change the initiative order and time
your character’s attacks for maximum effect.
Delaying and readying are described on pages 288 and 291 of the Player’s
Handbook.
Some specific examples of ways to use the ready and delay actions to your
advantage include:
 Waiting for a flank: Your character is toe to toe with the ogre, but your
buddy hasn’t taken his turn yet. Delay your character’s action until your
friend’s character moves up to flank the ogre. When your ally attacks, he
gets the flanking bonus because your character is already in position.
Then, your character attacks after your friend goes, and your character
gets the flanking bonus also. If your character had attacked on your turn
before your friend’s character was in place on the other side of the mon-
ster, your character wouldn’t have been flanking.
 Waiting for a buff: The party is facing a troll, and the player running the
party’s cleric tells you that he’s going to use his righteous brand power
and give your character the attack bonus if he hits. You can have your
character make an attack right now without the benefit of the prayer —
or, you can delay your character’s action until after the cleric hits the
troll and then make an attack with the bonus conferred by the cleric’s
prayer.
 Fighting enemies your character can’t reach: If you’re dealing with a
flying monster that swoops in to attack your character and then finishes
its turn well out of reach, ready an action to strike at the monster the
instant it comes within sword-reach. When it attacks, so does your 
character, and you don’t spend round after round with your character
getting hit and not being able to strike back because the monster isn’t
nearby anymore when your turn comes up.
Charging
Most attack powers in the game are standard actions. If you’re ever in a situa-
tion where a monster you want to attack isn’t within range and you can’t get
him in range with your move action, you might think that you can’t attack it.
But you’d be wrong. The Charge action is a special combat action that, as 
a single standard action, enables your character to move up to his or her
speed and make a basic melee attack at the end of the move. If you need to
reach a foe and attack him fast, charging is a good answer. Your character
also receives a +1 attack bonus when charging.
242
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Charging is described on page 287 of the Player’s Handbook.
The big disadvantage of using the Charge action is that most attack powers —
even at-will attacks — aren’t usable in a charge. In other words, all you can
do when you charge is run up and make a single, relatively weak attack. But 
if you had no other way to attack an enemy on your turn, it might be the best
you can do.
Charging is especially useful if you want to use a melee attack and
 You start your turn prone with no enemies next to you. Standing up takes
a move action, and then you can charge in order to move up to a monster
and make a melee attack.
 You start your turn dazed with no enemies next to you. Because you’re
limited to a single action when you’re dazed, the only way you can get to
an enemy and make a melee attack is to charge.
 The monster you want to hit is so far away you can’t reach it in a single
move action, but you could reach it in two. Use your first move action to
get close and then charge with your standard action.
Avoiding opportunity attacks
Opportunity attacks are free, instant basic melee attacks anyone gets when an
adjacent foe undertakes a complicated or risky action. Things that provoke
opportunity attacks include using ranged or area attacks or powers or ignor-
ing a foe in order to move out of a square adjacent to that foe.
You can read all about opportunity attacks on page 290 of the Player’s
Handbook.
Basically, you don’t want to provoke opportunity attacks. It’s not smart to
give the monsters free extra attacks against your character because some-
times those attacks will hit, and your character will wind up taking more
damage than necessary. Worse yet, maybe the monster will get really lucky,
roll a critical hit, and take your character out of the fight with one swing —
when it’s not even the monster’s turn.
That said, sometimes players go to extreme lengths to avoid insignificant
opportunity attacks. If you’re playing a cleric with an AC of 22 who’s fighting
a goblin warrior with an attack bonus of +2, the goblin’s only going to hit your
cleric on a roll of 20. Ninety-five percent of the time, you can safely disregard
the threat the goblin poses and ignore him or her. Be conservative in decid-
ing when a foe can be ignored, though.
243
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

You have two good ways for your character to maneuver around monsters
and foes without giving them opportunity attacks:
 Shift: You can limit your character’s movement to a single square per
move action. If your character uses the Shift action, he or she moves
only 1 square but doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks just for leaving a
square adjacent to an enemy. Another good use for Shift is to step back
from a foe in order to get room to use a ranged or area power safely.
 Powers: Many powers give you the ability to move without provoking. For
example, the 6th-level wizard power dimension door allows you to teleport
10 squares. When you teleport, you just disappear and reappear — even 
if you “leave” a square adjacent to an enemy, your foe doesn’t get an
opportunity attack against you. Rogues have several powers that let them
move around the battlefield safely, although none are as spectacular as
teleportation.
Concentrating on defense
Most players believe that the best defense is a good offense; if you want to
avoid getting hit, take down the monster so fast it doesn’t get many chances
to hurt you. However, sometimes your best move is to play for time.
Consider this scenario: Your character has used up his or her expendable
powers and is badly bloodied. One more good hit from the hill giant you’re
fighting might take you out. But you’re providing a flanking opportunity for
the rogue, who happens to be in much better shape than you. Taking a mace
swing at the hill giant is okay, but it won’t make that much of a difference to
the fight. However, as long as you stay on your feet, you’re giving the rogue
combat advantage.
In a situation like this, it might be better to concentrate on defense. Here are
a few ways to do it:
 Second Wind: The Second Wind action lets you use a healing surge and
also gives you +2 on all defenses until the start of your next turn. It takes
a standard action, so normally you can’t attack and use your Second
Wind on the same turn. (However, dwarf characters can use Second
Wind as a minor action.) You can find the full description of this action
on page 291 of the Player’s Handbook.
 Total Defense: If you don’t want to use a healing surge (or you used your
Second Wind already), use the Total Defense action. It costs you a stan-
dard action, so you can’t have your character attack in the same round
that you use total defense, but you gain a +2 bonus to all your charac-
ter’s defenses. In other words, Total Defense is just like Second Wind,
except with no healing.
244
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

 Aid Another: You can use the Aid Another action with a melee attack. If
you hit AC 10 (pretty easy, really) you can choose to grant an ally +2 to
all defenses against the target creature’s next attack. If you can’t hurt 
the monster, you can at least help your ally defend himself or herself.
 Using cover: Try to put something big and solid between your character
and the monster. Cover inflicts a –2 or –5 penalty on the attacker’s attack
roll, depending on whether it’s normal cover (a pillar, a small tree, a large
piece of furniture, a low wall) or superior cover (an arrow slit, a portcullis,
or something similarly unfair). You may or may not suffer a penalty to
attack the monster out of your own cover, depending on where your char-
acter is in relation to the monster and the object that’s providing cover.
Cover is described in detail on page 280 of the Player’s Handbook.
Setting up opportunity attacks
Your single most precious commodity in the game is the number of turns you
get in the course of the day. The typical D&D battle lasts about five rounds,
and you can expect your character to be in about four to six battles per day
245
Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

of adventuring — so your character has only 20 to 30 turns per day to beat
down bad guys and make a difference in the adventure. Getting the most out
of every turn you take is absolutely vital.
If actions are your most valuable asset, then any tactic that lets your charac-
ter get more opportunities to damage the enemy without costing any actions
is worth a closer look. Opportunity attacks offer your character the chance
to make extra attacks even when it isn’t your turn; if you can manufacture
even one opportunity attack per five rounds of combat, you’re cramming six
rounds of actions into five rounds of fighting. You’ll be 20 percent more effec-
tive than the player who didn’t position his or her character to take advan-
tage of the opening when it came up.
The first thing you can do to maximize your opportunity attacks is to play a
fighter; the fighter class has a couple of very potent abilities based on oppor-
tunity attacks. However, even if you’re not playing a fighter, you can choose
feats that maximize the effectiveness of opportunity attacks. Here are a few
you should look at:
 Combat Reflexes provides a +1 attack bonus on opportunity attacks.
 Blade Opportunist provides a +2 attack bonus on opportunity attacks if
you use a light blade or heavy blade.
 Potent Opportunity lets a fighter add his or her Con modifier to damage
dealt in an opportunity attack.
 Heavy Blade Opportunity lets you use an at-will power when your char-
acter makes an opportunity attack.
 Tripping Chain knocks the target of your opportunity attack prone, if
you’re using a flail.
In addition to your feat selection, you can also use some hard-nosed tactical
play to put your character in a position to gather up every opportunity attack
that might come his or her way:
 Controlling territory: Put your character in a spot where the enemy has
to go past your character to get at other party members (or to get away
from other party members). Look for tactical chokepoints in the fight
where your character can block a hallway or a door and get a free hack
on anyone trying to go through.
 Menacing everyone: Move your character adjacent to as many foes as
possible, especially if they aren’t brutes or soldiers (monsters that are 
at their most dangerous in melee combat). This strategy is a little risky,
because it’s usually not a great idea to get your character surrounded,
but the more enemies adjacent to you, the more likely it is that one of
them will do something stupid and give you a free shot.

Adapting Your Tactics to Your Foes
The earlier sections of this chapter give you the medieval equivalent of a Ph.D.
in Hurt. In the rest of the chapter, we show you some specific tactical situa-
tions that come up all the time in game play. It’s rare that you participate in an
adventure that doesn’t feature at least one or more of the following scenarios.
Beating ranged controllers
Some of the most dangerous monsters and villains are controllers because
they can either put damage on a number of party members at once (an evil
wizard with a fireball spell, for example) or take out one of your comrades
with a nasty effect like petrification, paralysis, or domination. Controllers
who can attack effectively at range are especially frustrating because many
player characters are built for melee combat. Fighters, rogues, and battle
clerics often find themselves without a single attack power that works at
range.
Fortunately, most ranged controllers tend to be soft targets (enemies with
low Armor Class and poor hit points). You can beat them if you hit them fast
and hard. Here are three basic tactics you can try the next time your party
comes across an evil wizard:
 Split up: The best answer to area-effect attacks is to simply make sure
that no two characters are close enough to each other to get caught in
the same blast. If a controller’s got a power that can affect two targets
but you make sure he or she can catch only one target at a time, you’ve
cut that enemy’s effectiveness in half.
 Box and menace: The classic response to an enemy using ranged or
area attacks is to put an angry fighter in his or her face. Charge or run
past any obstacles in the way to reach the controller. If he or she uses a
ranged power while your character is adjacent, he or she will have to
shift away from your character in order to cast safely. If you can get an
ally on the other side of the enemy, you can box him or her so that he or
she can’t use a ranged or area power without giving your character an
opportunity attack.
 Block line of sight: Wizards (and warlocks) have access to powers that
can block line of sight — for example, stinking cloud, wall of fog, or wall
of fire. Although these are decent offensive spells, you can use them
defensively by creating a “smoke screen” the enemy controller can’t see
through. The enemy will have to get on your side of the obscuring effect
in order to attack, and that means moving to a place where you might be
able to get at him or her.

Chapter 19: Handling Yourself in a Fight

Handling numerous foes
The good news about being badly outnumbered is that you’re probably deal-
ing with foes who are individually weaker than your character. D&D is heroic
fiction, and in heroic fiction, you can mop the floor with whole gangs of
numerous bad guys who can’t hit the broadside of a barn. If you find your
character outnumbered by foes who are as tough (or tougher) than your
character, then run! Your character is going to get creamed.
The following list offers some helpful tactics to try when your character is
outnumbered and surrounded by enemies:
 Concentrate the damage: Don’t have your character hit one orc in one
round and then attack a different orc in the next round. In D&D, enemies
don’t lose any offensive potential until they’re knocked all the way down
to 0 hit points, so slowly wearing down multiple foes at once simply
means that you’re giving more enemies opportunities to hurt your char-
acter before they go down. Pick on one or two foes at a time and drop
them before starting on the next enemies.
 Control the battlefield: Look for ways to divide and conquer foes. Have
your character retreat into a narrow passage where enemies can come
at him or her only a couple at a time. Use terrain-altering spells such as
icy terrain or consecrated ground to isolate some of your enemies from
their pals. If nothing else presents itself, just move. When your character
is standing still on open ground, you’re making it easy for your foes to
surround your character and attack from all sides. If you keep your char-
acter moving, you won’t find your character in the middle of three or
four bad guys all taking swings on him or her every round.
Fighting monsters your 
character can’t hurt
Few monsters are really invulnerable, but sometimes you encounter oppo-
nents that can be very difficult to wear down. The basic strategy for fighting 
a monster most of the party can’t hurt is to protect and support whichever
characters can hurt the monster. Everybody else simply buys time for the
effective character or characters to wear down the foe, and the party does its
best to make sure the character doing the hard work stays healed up and in
the thick of the fight.
High-AC foes
Enemies with superior Armor Class may be virtually impossible for your
character to hit with melee or ranged attacks. Fortunately, your character
can hit anything if you roll a natural 20 on your attack roll, so if nothing else,
248
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

you can simply have your character flail away at the enemy until you get a
lucky roll. Here are some different ideas:
 Flank and aid another: If your foe seems impossible to hit, surround it
to get the +2 attack bonus for combat advantage through flanking . . .
then have as many characters as possible use the Aid Another action 
in order to provide one character with the best chance of hitting extra
attack bonuses.
 Maximize one character: Use powers that confer attack bonuses on your
allies to power up the most effective character in the party. Powers such
as lance of faith, bless, or spiritual weapon can grant significant attack
bonuses. This is a leader-role thing, so clerics and warlords have the
most powers of this sort.
Elusive foes
Some enemies are hard to hurt because they’re simply not there for your char-
acter’s attacks. Good examples are insubstantial creatures such as specters or
shadows that can attack through the walls, or skirmishing monsters who use
high movement rates and mobility powers to whack your character and then
bound away before your character can reply.
Try the following strategy when your character is facing an elusive foe: Ready
an attack to strike at your adversary whenever he or she comes within reach.
Even if your foe’s movements and attacks don’t normally provoke opportu-
nity attacks, a readied attack isn’t an opportunity attack; your character can
get a swing at the enemy when he or she moves in to attack. It works better
than standing around waiting to get hit.

Chapter 20
Making the Most of Magic
In This Chapter
 Fine-tuning your wizard’s spell selection
 Using magic powers in combat
 Getting the most out of magic rituals
 Maxing out your character’s magic items
F
lashing steel and deeds of agility are great, but the most spectacular and
imaginative part of the D&D experience is magic — the supernatural
powers and enchanted items many heroes use to break the rules of reality. 
A fireball drops the evil wizard’s orc bodyguards; an invisibility spell on the
party’s rogue lets her get into position for a lethal sneak attack; the attacking
mummy is set ablaze by the fighter’s magical flameburst battleaxe. D&D has
been summed up as simply as “the game where you fight monsters with
magic,” and that says it all.
In 4th Edition DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, there’s much less difference between 
casters — characters who use spells or other supernatural powers to 
attack — and noncasters than there was in previous editions. All characters
now choose special powers, and they “use up” at least some of the powers
(powers with a daily usage) as they adventure. However, most players would
agree that characters who use the arcane or divine power sources and pri-
marily attack at range are casters because they’re attacking with magic
prayers and spells. Clerics, warlocks, and wizards are all casters.
In this chapter, we tell you about the fine arts of choosing a wizard’s spell
repertoire for the day, casting effectively in battle, and maximizing any char-
acter’s power with the acquisition of the right magic items. We also show you
some baseline magic item purchases to quickly equip higher-level characters.

Selecting Wizard Spells 
for the Adventure
Wizards are unique among magic-using characters because they have a lim-
ited ability to change their powers every day, thanks to the Spellbook class
feature. This means that the wizard has the greatest flexibility of all the
classes, casters or noncasters. If you’re playing a wizard, you can reinvent
your wizard as an entirely new character every time you decide which daily
and utility spells you want your character to prepare. So how do you know
which are the right spells to take?
Here’s an easy process to follow when you’re considered which spells you
want your character to prepare for the day’s adventuring:
1. Consider the scenario.
What are you trying to do? Is the party going monster-hunting? Select
spells to find and kill monsters. Is the party going to explore a trap-filled
tomb? Take utility spells that will let the party get around or through
traps. Is the party trying to infiltrate an evil thieves’ guild? Take spells 
of disguise, enchantment, and subterfuge.
2. Review what you know.
What do you know about the obstacles you expect to meet in the adven-
ture? If the party has learned that the evil tyrant’s castle is guarded by
ogre berserkers, you can expect to run into lots of ogres. Change out
spells that attack Fortitude defense for spells that attack Will defense;
ogres are physically tough, but they’re pushovers for mental effects. If
you discover you don’t have any information at all, can you use any 
of the rituals you know to gain more before you commit to your spell
selection for the day? (If not, perhaps you should make gaining informa-
tion your mission for the day and then go in with magic missiles blazing
after you know a little bit more!)
3. Choose your mission.
How do you want to accomplish your goals in the current adventure?
What mix of player characters showed up for the game tonight? Is the
party short a leader, and therefore in need of some extra magical protec-
tion? Here are some of your choices:
• Direct attack: Your character’s role for the day is to provide magical
firepower for the party of adventurers. Select utility powers that
will help you fight better, such as shield. Load up on daily attack
spells that deal lots of damage, like acid arrow and fireball.
• Maneuver: Your character is going to help the party get to where it
can do the most good. Select utility powers that help other charac-
ters to move (for example, jump or levitate) and offensive powers
that emphasize immobilizing enemies, such as sleep or web.
252
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

• Reconnaissance: Your character is going to gather information per-
taining to the mission. Utility spells such as disguise self or invisibil-
ity may be useful in allowing your character to slip into places he
or she is not supposed to be, or to scout out dangerous locales
before the party walks into a deadly ambush.
• Protection: Your character is going to help the party stand up to
damage and fight better. Prepare utility spells that can help your
comrades and generally contribute versatility and extra options,
such as invisibility or resistance. For your daily attack spells,
choose powers that deny or hinder enemy action, such as Bigby’s
icy grasp or wall of fire.
Many wizard players get in the habit of leaving their favorite spells perma-
nently “penciled in” on their character sheets, but you’re missing out on a
subtle and powerful class feature if you never use your wizard’s spellbook!
253
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic
Who uses magic?
In earlier editions of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game, characters used magic in two basic forms:
spells some character classes could cast (pri-
marily clerics and wizards), and magic items any
character might carry. In the 4th Edition DUNGEONS
& DRAGONS game, every character has powers
that can be used only once per day each. In a
sense, every character is a spellcaster (at least
by the standards of earlier editions) even if their
“spells” are actually exploits of pure martial skill.
In this context, the difference between powers
that are overtly supernatural and powers that are
based on physical skill and effort just isn’t that
important. But generally speaking, arcane and
divine powers are “magic,” and heroic powers
aren’t — unless, of course, you use a heroic
power like crushing blow to smash the enemy
with a +4 giantslayer warhammer. That hammer
is surely magical, even if your power isn’t!
The line between what’s magic and what’s not is
further blurred by the fact that many powers
based on the magic power sources (arcane and
divine) aren’t really much like spells used to be
in earlier editions. For example, the paladin is a
character who uses the divine power source.
Few of his evil-smiting powers really look like
what the game used to call “spells,” and no one
would mistake a plate-armored paladin for a
character who is primarily a “spellcaster.” He’s
a defender, one of the toughest and most physi-
cally resilient characters in the game.
For the purposes of our discussion in this chap-
ter, castersare characters who are built to attack
enemies at range with arcane or divine powers.
Noncasters are everyone else. Using this defini-
tion, here are the casters in the D&D game:
 Devoted Clerics, warlocks, and wizards are
casters.
 Fighters, paladins, rangers, rogues, and
warlords are noncasters (although rangers
using the Archer build are a lot like casters).
 Battle Clerics work like casters when they
use ranged powers and non-casters when
they use melee powers.

Casting in Combat
You can secure all the advantages you like with rituals and useful utility
powers, but sooner or later, your caster is going to have to fight the mon-
sters. If you’re playing a Devoted Cleric, a warlock, or a wizard, your 
character has no weapons worth speaking of other than magic.
As a caster, the last place you want to be is right in front of the monsters or
villains, where they can pound on your character with their melee attacks.
Unfortunately, this decision isn’t always up to you. Sometimes you get caught
off-guard or trapped in tight quarters, and the monsters are in your face
before you can get out of the way.
Getting caught in a melee is bad for two reasons. First of all, your character is
exposed to the enemies’ best and most dangerous attacks. No sane wizard
wants to be anywhere near an angry ogre with a big spiked club. Second, area
powers and ranged powers (the majority of powers your character uses in
combat) provoke opportunity attacks. (See Chapter 19 of this book for more
about opportunity attacks.) So, not only is your character exposed to direct
attack, you’re putting your character in a situation where he or she might not
be able to safely use the best weapons at his or her disposal.
Fortunately, there are a few ways to slither out of this difficult position:
 Shift: Your character can step one square away from the foe threatening
him or her without provoking an opportunity attack for moving. If your
character is no longer adjacent to any enemies, he or she can then safely
use area or ranged powers. Be careful about trying this on large oppo-
nents such as ogres or giants, though — some of them have a special
ability called Threatening Reach, which means you’re still in danger
even if you are no longer adjacent to them.
 Close powers: A fair number of powers have a range of “Close.” Unlike
area powers or ranged powers, Close powers don’t provoke opportunity
attacks. If you can’t shift out of trouble, use a Close power instead of
your longer-ranged powers.
 Teleport: If you have a teleport power (for example, the eladrin’s fey step
or the wizard’s dimension door) you can safely move away by teleporting
before using your area or ranged attack.
 Delay: Consider delaying your action until one of the other player charac-
ters is able to push, pull, or slide the enemy away from you, or otherwise
create an opportunity for you to use your area or ranged powers safely.
254

Rituals: The Magic You 
Didn’t Know You Had
One of the interesting innovations in the 4th Edition D&D game is the ritual
magic system. In earlier editions, your cleric or wizard had to decide whether
to prepare combat-useful magic such as invisibility and searing light spells, or
spells that might help the party navigate through the dungeon (for example,
knock or endure elements). If you had too many of your spell slots tied up in
spells that weren’t useful in combat, you risked running out of things to do
during fights. If you didn’t have enough of those utility spells, the party’s day
of adventuring might come to an abrupt end when you hit an obstacle you
didn’t have the right spell for.
Fortunately, the 4th Edition D&D game is much friendlier. First of all, every
character gains utility powers that are segregated from attack powers, so you
never have to worry about whether you’ve devoted too many resources to
spells that aren’t useful in combat. Second, your character now has access to
magic rituals that replace many of those marginal spells from earlier editions.
Rituals don’t use up any of your power slots, and they have no limitation on
how often you can use them. All they cost you is time and money.
Basically, a ritual is a set of written instructions for creating a magical effect.
Each time your character follows the instructions, he or she gets the ritual’s
result. You can cast the same ritual ten times in a day if you want to, as long
as you have the ritual book, the necessary components, and the time to do
so. The instructions have to be written down in a ritual book or on a ritual
scroll because even the simplest rituals are complicated enough that charac-
ters can’t just memorize them. However, there’s no limit to the number of 
rituals your character might eventually master.
Rituals are covered in Chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook.
We call rituals “the magic you didn’t know you had” because any character
could conceivably learn to perform rituals. All your character needs is the
Ritual Caster feat (which clerics and wizards get for free). Your character
does have to be trained in either Arcana or Religion to select that feat, so if
his or her class doesn’t provide those skills, you’ll need to use a Skill Training
feat first. But the point remains that, for the relatively low cost of one or two
feats, any character in the game can make himself or herself capable of doing
things like teleporting the party thousands of miles, raising the dead, or
enchanting magic items.
255
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

Learning rituals
The trick with rituals is that your character knows only the rituals that he or
she has recorded in ritual books. To get a ritual book, your character must
find it as treasure, spend money to buy a copy (the ritual’s market price), or
master a ritual as part of a class feature. Clerics and wizards begin at 1st level
with a small number of rituals they’ve already mastered, and wizards get 
to learn new rituals for free at 5th, 11th, 15th, 21st, and 25th level. (See the
wizard class description in the Player’s Handbook.) Early in his or her career,
your character might have only a couple of rituals. You’ll need to slowly build
up that library to include all the rituals that you think are worthwhile for
your character.
Before you start on your tour of the ritual chapter, there’s one important thing
you should know: Your character can only learn rituals of equal or lower level.
For example, if your character is a 7th-level wizard, he or she can only perform
rituals of 7th level or lower.
You don’t have to be trained in the key skill for the ritual. For example, Raise
Dead uses Heal as its key skill, but any character who can perform rituals can
perform the Raise Dead ritual. Sometimes it’s helpful to be trained in the
ritual’s key skill, but it’s not a requirement. In previous editions of the D&D
256
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

game, Raise Dead was exclusively the province of the cleric class, but any
character with the Ritual Caster feat can give it a shot — as long as they’re
8th level or higher and have a ritual book of Raise Dead handy.
Using rituals
To use a ritual, your character must have a copy of the ritual handy in either
a book or a scroll. If it’s in a book, your character must have mastered the
ritual — which means your character’s level must be equal to or greater than
the ritual’s level. If it’s in a scroll, you don’t have to have it mastered. Scrolls
are “ritual cheat sheets,” already pre-cast up until the last few steps so that
any character, whether or not they have the Ritual Caster feat, can follow the
directions and perform the ritual on the scroll.
As we mention earlier, rituals cost time and money. Time is the ritual’s cast-
ing time. For example, the Raise Dead ritual takes 8 hours to perform. Money
is simply the ritual’s cost — each time your character performs that ritual, he
or she has to spend the appropriate sum in various arcane reagents, rare
herbs and salves, or what-have-you. For example, Raise Dead costs 500 gp to
perform. Fortunately, you don’t have to specify the exact components for any
given ritual; you can just write “700 gp of mystic salves” on your character
sheet, and when your character performs Raise Dead, scratch that off and
write in 200 gp instead.
Some rituals have another cost — they may cost your character some
number of healing surges. These are extremely taxing rituals that you just
can’t perform easily. The Forbiddance ritual is a good example; it costs you 5
healing surges. Usually, rituals that cost you in this way are intended to be
used outside of adventuring; they’re more for background and story than tac-
tical play.
Rituals usually succeed, if success is possible (you can’t raise someone who’s
been dead more than 30 days, for instance), but sometimes the results
improve dramatically depending on the result of a key skill check. For
instance, when your character casts Cure Disease, a skill check result of 0 or
less actually kills the poor sod you’re trying to heal. (Although if you kill him,
the disease is gone!) If you achieve a skill check result of 30 or better, he
takes no damage at all.
Powering Up with Magic Items
The arcane and divine powers your character commands represent only a
portion of the magical power available to the typical adventuring party. The
other half of the equation is the party’s collection of magic items. For exam-
ple, the fighter carries a magic sword and wears magic armor; the rogue has a
257
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

magic crossbow and an elven cloak; the wizard has a wand of fiery bolts; and
the cleric wears a helm of battle. Spells are just for arcane casters and prayers
are for divine casters, but any character can carry a powerful magic item.
When you create a 1st-level character, that character begins with low-grade,
nonmagical gear and a handful of pocket change. But as your character has
successful adventures, he or she recovers staggering amounts of wealth and
magic items of great and terrible power. Your character’s collection of magic
items is just as much a part of him or her as the choice of class, powers, skills,
and feats. A fighter who owns winged boots is a very different character from a
fighter who owns dwarven greaves.
Most magic items have an enhancement value — a “plus” — associated with
one of your character’s basic stats. For example, magic armor enhances your
character’s Armor Class, magic weapons enhance attack and damage rolls,
and magic cloaks enhance Fortitude, Reflex, and Will defenses. If your charac-
ter wears a +2 elven cloak, you get to add 2 to each of those defenses as long
as your character wears that cloak. In addition, items may have properties
and powers. Properties are persistent, always-on abilities; for example, the
helm of battle grants your character a +1 item bonus to initiative checks.
Items’ powers are much like your character powers; they’re specific abilities
your character can trigger at will, once per encounter, or once per day.
258
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 
Rituals every party should have
Some rituals are a lot more important than
others. As your character gains levels, he or she
should make sure to find, buy, or select these rit-
uals for the good of the whole adventuring party:
 Knock (level 4): Got a door your party can’t
open or destroy? The Knock ritual can over-
come that obstacle.
 Cure Disease (level 6): Few monsters have
disease attacks, but when your character
gets hit with one, you want to get better —
fast.
 Sending (level 6): The closest you can
come to a cell phone in the D&D world.
Sending allows you to report to a distant
patron, contact a lost player character, ask
a friendly sage a question . . . anything you
can think of in 25 words or less.
 Linked Portal (level 8): This extraordinarily
useful ritual is basically a whole-party tele-
port with a range in hundreds or thousands
of miles. Need to get to Waterdeep before
lunchtime? This is the ritual for you. The
casting time is only 10 minutes, so it’s also
a good way to bug out of a dungeon if you
can just drop out of sight for a short time.
 Raise Dead (level 8): Nothing ruins your
whole day like getting killed. Raise Dead
can fix that and get your hero back in the
fight (with an 8-hour delay, anyway). What
more needs to be said?
 Remove Affliction (level 8): Like Cure
Disease, you need to have this ritual in your
back pocket in case one of the party mem-
bers gets hit with something nasty and 
permanent — for example, being petrified
by a medusa.

Types of magic items
Magic items come in a variety of different forms, ranging from mighty magic
swords, to life-saving potions, to artifacts of godlike power. By the time your
character gets a few experience levels under his or her belt, you’ll probably
have a good array of magic items to choose from.
Here’s a quick tour of the types of magic items you’re likely to find or purchase:
 Armor: Magic armor works much like normal armor, except better. The
enhancement bonus of magic armor is added to the AC bonus provided
by the armor. So, for example, normal scale mail gives a +7 armor bonus
to AC, but +2 scale mail adds 9 points to AC.
 Weapons: Magic weapons add their enhancement bonus to each attack
and damage roll your character makes with the weapon. For example, a
4th-level character with a Strength of 16 and a longsword has an attack
bonus of +8 (+2 for the character’s level modifier, +3 for Strength modi-
fier, and +3 for the longsword’s proficiency bonus) and deals 1d8+3
points of damage. If the same character fights with a +2 longsword, the
attack bonus becomes +10, and the character deals 1d8+5 points of
damage per hit.
 Implements: Just as melee characters or archers use magic swords or
bows, casters use magic implements. Implements include holy symbols,
orbs, rods, staffs, and wands; different characters use different imple-
ments. For example, clerics and paladins use holy symbols, whereas
warlocks and wizards use wands, orbs, rods, or staffs. Implements work
exactly like magic weapons — if your wizard has a +2 wand, you add +2
to your attack and damage rolls with spells your character casts with it.
 Slot items: Unlike an entire suit of magical armor, slot items are worn
just on a specific part of the body. Your character can wear only one
magical item per slot — a character can’t use two arm slot items (say,
bracers of defense and a shield of protection) at the same time. The body
slots are neck, arms, feet, hands, head, and waist, and each body slot is
associated with a particular type of bonus or advantage. For example,
neck slot items always confer bonuses to your character’s defenses;
you’ll never find a defense-boosting item that isn’t a neck slot item.
• Neck slot items: Amulets, cloaks, and scarabs are worn around the
neck. Neck slot items are very important, because they add their
enhancement bonus to all three of your non-AC defenses: Fortitude,
Reflex, and Will defense. For example, if your rogue wears an amulet
of cleansing +3, you add +3 to each of your character’s defenses.
• Arm slot items: Items that are worn or carried on the arm, such as
bracers and shields. These items don’t have any enhancement
bonus (so there’s no such thing as a +2 shield in the 4th Edition
Dungeons & Dragons game), but they usually have powers or 
properties that help your character’s defenses in other ways.
259
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

• Feet slot items: Items your character wears on his or her feet (and/
or lower legs), such as boots and greaves. Most are magic boots 
of one kind or another. Like your arms slot items, they don’t have
enhancement bonuses. Most feet slot items add to your character’s
mobility or bestow movement powers of one kind or another.
• Hand slot items: Items your character wears on his or her hands,
such as gloves and gauntlets. Again, they don’t have any enhance-
ment bonus, but they instead contribute to offense or skill use with
various properties and powers.
• Head slot items: Items worn on the head, such as helmets, circlets,
and crowns. Usually they bestow powers of perception, defense, or
authority. They don’t have enhancement bonuses and don’t figure
into any of your character’s stats otherwise.
• Waist slot items: Items worn around the waist, such as belts. They
don’t have enhancement bonuses to add to any of your stats.
Instead, they generally have properties or powers that add to your
defenses and resistances.
 Rings: Well, we all know about magic rings now, don’t we? Don’t worry;
not every ring is The One Ring to Rule Them All. A character can wear
and gain the benefits of up to two magic rings (one on each hand).
Wearing more than that means that none of the rings function. Magic
rings usually come with a useful property and a good power, usually
usable once per day (or recharged when your character reaches an
adventuring milestone).
 Wondrous item: This is a catch-all category of weird things your charac-
ter usually doesn’t wear, so they’re not tied to any particular item slots.
They also don’t provide enhancement bonuses. However, this category
includes a variety of powerful and useful items, such as bag of holding,
sending stones, and flying carpet. We just can’t offer much in the way of
generalizations about wondrous items, because they’re all diverse and
unique.
 Potion: A potion is a one-use restorative beverage. When your character
drinks it, the potion’s magic provides some amount of healing or recovery,
and the potion is used up. The most powerful potions can even restore life
to the dead, but most potions you find are simple potions of healing — 
10 hit points in a little glass vial that costs you 1 healing surge. Usually,
potions don’t restore as many hit points as one of your character’s own
healing surges, but at least you can control when your character drinks a
potion. If the party’s cleric is incapacitated and you’ve already used your
second wind, it might be the only healing your character can get.
Magic item descriptions begin on page 227 of the Player’s Handbook.

Acquiring magic items
Magic items sound great, don’t they? You might think that every character
should have some, and in the vast majority of D&D games, they do. Your char-
acter can find magic items in monster-guarded dungeon vaults, use his or her
share of recovered treasure hoards to purchase magic items, or even build
new items by using magic rituals. But here’s the downside: Your character’s
acquisition of magic items is entirely in the hands of your Dungeon Master. If
your DM doesn’t include magic items in the treasure stashes of the monsters
the party defeats, well, your character won’t find many. And if your DM
decides that magic items just aren’t bought and sold in his or her campaign,
you won’t be able to turn big piles of gold into a wand of fireball and a dragon-
slayer sword. You have to live with what your DM lets your character have.
Finding items
Monsters often guard hoards of staggering wealth, including long-lost devices
with mighty enchantments. Champions of evil are sometimes armed and
armored with powerful magic items, which are there for the taking after the
party has defeated the previous owner.
The difficulty with items your character finds in monster hoards or on the
persons of defeated villains is that they don’t come with name tags and
instruction manuals. Many DMs don’t waste much time on making you guess
what magic items your character is carrying, because nothing is more annoy-
ing than listening to a player constantly say things like, “Okay, I rolled an 18
for my attack roll . . . plus whatever the bonus on this sword is, so maybe it’s
a 19 or a 20. So did I hit or what?” But some DMs like to throw curveballs at
you such as items that your character doesn’t understand right away, so be
prepared.
If you find yourself in possession of an item your character can’t identify, you
may be able to figure it out with a successful Arcana, History, or Religion skill
check. Failing that, there are a few rituals that might help you out — for
example, Consult Mystic Sages or Consult Oracle. These are costly, so don’t
resort to using a ritual for every item your character finds.
Buying and selling items
The second most common way to acquire magic items is to simply buy them.
If your character loots a dragon’s hoard and finds 20,000 pieces of gold, you
have 20 grand to spend. In D&D, the point of gaining wealth is so that you can
spend it on the biggest, most impressive magic items you can find for your
character, and then go get even more treasure so you can buy even better
magic items.
261
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

Buying magic items works in both directions, of course. When your character
finds a +3 flaming adamantine longsword, that old +2 longsword doesn’t look
so useful anymore. You can sell items, too — but you usually only get 20 per-
cent of the purchase price. Don’t sell old items unless you’re really and truly
done with them.
In general, your character needs to find a good-sized city in order to buy or
sell an expensive magic item. The reasoning is that no one in a flea-speck-
sized village way off in the middle of nowhere has a +3 sword to sell. The
bigger the town, the better the odds of finding good magic items to buy. To
get your hands on a really impressive item, you might have to go to some-
place fantastic like the bazaar in the efreeti City of Brass.
Enchanting items
A lot of DMs are old-school on the topic of buying magic items, and may not
allow you to just buy a wondrous enchanted device crafted by mighty dwar-
ven armorers many centuries ago with the tawdry loot you dragged out of
the nearest monster-infested hole in the ground. Fortunately, you have a 
way around this: The Enchant Magic Item ritual. If your DM won’t let you buy
gauntlets of ogre power, maybe you can convince the party’s wizard to make
you a pair.
As it turns out, the cost of Enchant Magic Item is exactly equal to the market
price of the magic item you want to buy. So, really, when you enchant your
sword, you’re just buying a magic sword out of thin air (although you need a
plain old sword to work with, so it’s not really conjured out of nothing at all).
It takes an hour, and the ritual caster can’t create items that are higher than
his or her level. But if your party has a couple of days of down time and a lot
of money to spend, there’s no reason you can’t create any item in the Player’s
Handbook that’s your character’s level or lower. Some people think it just
“feels” better in the game to imagine that a skilled wizard or devout cleric is
crafting a magic item with muttered invocations and mystic reagents, as
opposed to stepping out to the Magic-Mart and throwing around the gold.
Defining the Magic Item Baseline
Heads up! The D&D game assumes that your character has a selection of
magic items appropriate to his or her class and level. The level of monsters
your character encounters is based on this assumption. You may think it’s
absolutely snazzy for your 10th-level fighter to walk around with a carpet of
flying, but if your fighter doesn’t have a magic weapon by 10th level, you’re
going to find that it’s hard to hold up your end in a fight.
262
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

In many D&D games, you don’t start with 1st-level characters; you start with
higher-level characters, who really need to have a small collection of magic
items to actually live up to their level. This often happens when a new player
is joining an existing game, or if the DM is beginning a new game and wants to
start with a particular higher-level adventure. Your DM might tell you some-
thing like, “Make up a 5th-level character and equip him or her appropriately.”
So how do you know what’s appropriate?
Here’s the Golden Rule for equipping higher-level characters from scratch.
First, determine your character’s starting level (in our example, 5th level).
Your character begins with:
 One magic item of his or her level +1
 One magic item of his or her level
 One magic item of his or her level –1
 Cash (in gold pieces) equal to the value of a magic item of his or her
level –1, which you can use to buy another item, purchase rituals and
ritual components, buy potions, or just save for later.
So, for a 5th-level character, you get: one 6th-level item, one 5th-level item,
one 4th-level item, and 840 gp (the normal value of a 4th-level item) to buy
other stuff with.
263
Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

The Golden Rule of equipping characters with magic items creates some
basic implications: First, you can have a total of four magic items (not count-
ing potions and such); second, your lowest-level item is either equal to your
level –1 (in which case you have no gold left over) or your level –2 (in which
case you have gold left over to pick up some potions and have some pocket
change). In general, we think it’s wise to have a potion or two in your belt and
a few gold pieces to spend, so that’s the way our recommendations play out
in the rest of this chapter.
With the four magic items, you should make sure you cover three things with-
out fail: Your character’s weapon or implement, armor, and neck slot item.
Those are the three categories of items that carry enhancement bonuses, and
therefore add directly to your character’s combat effectiveness by improving
his or her attack bonus, damage bonus, Armor Class, and the three defenses
(Fortitude, Reflex, and Will). For most players, it’s always best to carry the
highest enhancement bonuses in these three slots that the Golden Rule
allows — it’s the simplest way to keep your character’s combat stats as high
as you can. That means your fourth item doesn’t have to support a vital stat,
so you can pick up whatever item strikes your fancy. Players who know their
way around the magic item system can find items that offer better powers or
properties than a straightforward +1 enhancement, but we’re not talking to
those guys — we’re creating these tables for you.
In following sections, we provide recommended “gear buys” for characters
up to 15th level in each of the four base classes (fighter, rogue, cleric, and
wizard). These are summed up in this chapter in Tables 20-1 through 20-4. 
If you need to equip a character fast, these are handy shortcuts . . . and if
you’re slowly acquiring items as your character levels up over time, they
illustrate the sort of magic items your character should aspire to have.
Your character is not entitled to treasure and magic items of the stated
amount. Your character’s acquisition of treasure is entirely in the hands of
your Dungeon Master. You may lag behind drastically for a long time, only 
to score an epic hoard by slaying a mighty dragon. Or your character might
get lucky and find particular items that are significantly more than he or she
might normally be able to afford based on the Golden Rule.
Fighter magic items
If you’re playing a fighter, your primarily concern is finding good weapons
and armor. The better your character’s armament, the better he or she fights.
Table 20-1 lists our recommendations for the fighter’s starting magic items 
by level.

Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

Weapon and armor on Table 20-1 refer to whichever weapon your fighter favors
and the armor he or she prefers to wear. If your fighter is built for using heavy
blades, you should be picking up magic longswords, greatswords, or bastard
swords. If you spent a feat on armor training to upgrade from scale armor to
plate armor, use these gear recommendations to choose magic plate armor
instead of magic scale armor. In other words, fill in the blanks as appropriate
for your own fighter.
For the fighter, we like weapons that come with encounter powers that boost
damage and add some control, especially after you’ve already scored a hit.
These are easy for you, the player, to use — you don’t have to worry about
difficult daily resource management with your weapon, and you don’t have to
worry about triggering the power and then missing. Frost weapons slow the
target you trigger the power against, which is a great way of making sure your
enemy doesn’t get away.
We also recommended easy-to-play armors where possible. Blackiron armor
is simple because all it has is a very nice property — resistance 5 to fire and
necrotic damage. You never have to think about when to activate it because
it’s always on. Dwarven armor does come with a daily power to manage, but
it’s an easy one that might save your bacon someday; it’s effectively a free-
action heal that doesn’t cost you a healing surge.
At 15th level, you can reach 16th-level magic armor . . . which allows you to
choose +4 armor, the minimum enchantment necessary to choose master-
work armor (see page 212 of the Player’s Handbook). Going from +3 scale
armor to +4 dragonscale armor boosts your Armor Class by 4 points with a
single magic item selection. If you’re a defender, you have to have master-
work armor as soon as you can possibly acquire it.
266
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 
Magic items with daily powers
Some magic items contain daily powers,
powers that can be used once per day. Just as
you have a limit to the number of daily powers
your class provides, you have a similar limit in
regards to magic items. This limit depends on
your level. At the heroic tier of play (levels 1–10),
you can use one magic item daily power per
day. This limit increases to two at paragon tier
(levels 11–20) and three at epic tier (levels
21–30). Each use of a magic item daily power
must come from a different magic item. In addi-
tion, each time you reach a milestone (or defeat
encounters worth a specific total of XP based
on your character level) during a day of adven-
turing, you gain one additional use of a magic
item daily power. This additional use must be for
a power you haven’t yet activated for that day.

Rogue magic items
A rogue wants to acquire good magic weapons as much as the fighter does,
but a rogue also wants to pick up interesting and useful magic items for
avoiding detection and getting around in the dungeon. Table 20-2 lists our
recommendations for the rogue’s magic items by level.

Chapter 20: Making the Most of Magic

For your rogue’s weapon, you absolutely should choose a light blade of some
kind — a dagger or short sword (or, if you use a Weapon Proficiency feat, a
rapier). Our recommendations focus on magic weapons that are available 
as light blades. When playing a rogue, you face a tricky problem in that you
might need a second magic weapon. The fighter is happy to stick with a
melee weapon, but a fair number of rogue powers are designed for use with
the crossbow or with thrown weapons such as daggers or shuriken. If your
character build involves powers of this sort, you have two choices: You can
carry a second magic weapon as your “fourth” item, or you can make sure
your primary weapon is a dagger. Because the dagger can be thrown, your
melee weapon will work for many of your ranged powers. Magic daggers (and
other magic thrown weapons) return after you throw them, so you don’t have
to worry about disarming yourself.
We like the keen weapon property early in a rogue’s career because it gives
your character the chance to manufacture critical hits. It’s a milestone power,
which means once you use it, it’s gone for the day . . . unless you hit an
adventure milestone, and get the opportunity to recharge the power. In our
experience, adventure milestones come about once every two encounters, so
a milestone power is really an “every other encounter” power instead of an
encounter power. In any event, rogues really like critical hits because most
rogue powers offer a high potential damage anyway, and their bonus sneak
attack damage dice get maxed in the critical hit, too. In other words, a fighter’s
critical hit might add 5 or 10 points of damage to his or her shot because of
the maximum-damage rule, but a rogue’s critical hit often adds 20 or more
damage for maxing.
For your armor choice, there are several good options, but we like darkleaf
armor as the most broadly useful. It offers a +2 AC bonus against the first
attack you see in each encounter. With a bit of luck and skillful use of your
rogue’s powers, your character won’t be subjected to more than a couple of
attacks per encounter anyway.
Finally, one unusual item that deserves a bit of explanation is goggles of night.
It confers the ability to see in the dark. Now, most of the time your character
is going to be around other characters who can’t see in the dark, so this may
be of limited usefulness. But if your character ever does any scouting or slink-
ing around away from the rest of the party, he or she certainly doesn’t want to
have to carry a torch. That sort of gives away the stealthy character’s pres-
ence. We think you’ll find opportunities to put your goggles to good use.
Cleric magic items
Clerics face a tough challenge with magic items — they need two “weapons”
(a melee weapon plus a holy symbol) plus armor and that vital neck-slot item
to cover their defenses. Because your cleric’s melee attacks are generally
268
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

conveyed through a melee weapon but ranged attacks need a holy symbol,
it’s important to carry two offensive items with high enhancement bonuses
to score hits with your cleric’s powers. In addition, clerics are expected to
know at least a couple of the more important healing rituals in case their
companions run into serious afflictions (such as death). Consequently, our
recommendations in Table 20-3 don’t include many of the ancillary items like
bracers, helmets, or boots that other characters might choose.

Your armor and weapon choices are somewhat limited, simply because the
only type of heavy armor clerics are proficient in is chain armor, and the only
weapons clerics begin with are simple weapons. If you want access to a much
broader range of weapon and armor choices, choose the Armor Training
(Scale) or Weapon Proficiency feats. With that said, we like the resounding
weapon best for the cleric because dazing an enemy once per encounter is
very useful — especially if you can use it in conjunction with a power that
knocks the target prone or pushes him.
Your other weapon is your holy symbol. Fortunately, there aren’t many tough
decisions here. Holy symbols are pretty much designed to do things clerics
like, so any one you pick is going to be useful.
Although cleric armor choices are somewhat limited, exalted armor is right
down your alley. It gives you extra healing as a milestone power. As a leader,
it’s important to be able to pour on the healing when the party is in trouble.
270
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

Milestone powers fall somewhere between daily powers and encounter
powers; in play, you generally get to use one about once every two to three
encounters, or a couple of times in a single day of adventuring.
The biggest difference you may have noticed between the cleric’s recom-
mended items and those of the fighter and rogue are all the rituals. Because
clerics are skilled ritual casters, your character has the ability to use magic
rituals. All clerics begin with two rituals “for free” — Gentle Repose and one
other 1st-level ritual of your choice. As your cleric character gains levels, try
to set aside some of your equipment budget for buying a small number of rit-
uals and staying stocked up on ritual components. You hope you never have
to use it, but once you hit 8th level, you should seriously consider buying the
Raise Dead ritual.
Wizard magic items
You might think a wizard has no use for magic weapons or armor. After all,
spells are the weapons of choice for a wizard, and a wizard can’t wear much
armor anyway. However, wizards do indeed invest in magic weapons of a 
sort — wands, orbs, or staffs, their magic implements. Just as fighters carry
magic swords to fight better, wizards use magic implements to cast spells
better. Like clerics, wizards also are ritual magic users, so you’ll also need to
keep up on your character’s ritual selection. Table 20-4 shows our recommen-
dations for equipping your wizard character with magic items and a good
selection of important rituals.

We’ve selected staffs as your implement of choice for the purpose of this
table. Staffs have the benefit of serving both as melee weapons and magic
implements, so if you find yourself stuck in melee without any close-range
powers, you can swing away. However, you should pick the implement that
matches your Arcane Implement Mastery class feature — take a magic orb 
or wand instead of the staff, if that’s the implement your character favors. Of
the magic staffs, we like the staff of the war mage best, because the ability to
expand a blast or burst by 1 square means you might catch a couple of extra
monsters in the area of a big-damage spell.
You might be a little surprised to see armor on this table, but don’t get too
excited; it’s only cloth armor. However, even though the armor itself doesn’t
contribute all that much to your wizard’s Armor Class, the enhancement
bonus still counts — and several magical armors available in cloth are quite
useful for the wizard. For example, bloodthread armor grants an additional
bonus to AC and saving throws if you’re bloodied. As a wizard, you try hard
to not get hit at all, but if the monsters do get to you, armor that improves 
as your condition deteriorates makes for a good life insurance policy. If you
spend a feat to train in leather armor, you can find plenty of good choices
there, too.
Like the cleric, you’re automatically invested in the ritual magic system
because of your class features. In fact, wizards gain additional “free” rituals
as they gain levels, learning two new ones at 5th, 11th, 15th, 21st, and 25th
level. You can build up a pretty good selection without ever buying a ritual. 
If you don’t have a lot of gold to spend on expensive ritual components, you
should take up a collection from the other party members — most rituals 
you cast are clearly for the benefit of the whole party, and it’s not fair for your
wizard to pay those expensive ritual costs with his or her cut of the treasure.
Most experienced players are pretty reasonable about this, and they’ll agree
to set aside a modest portion of the party treasure in order to make sure the
wizard is capable of casting that teleportation ritual that might save every-
body’s bacon when things go bad.

W
e spend most of this book immersed in the nuts and bolts of character
creation and the mechanics of game play. But the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game isn’t just a game of statistics and rules. It’s also a game of imagination.
When you take control of your D&D character, you can pretend for a short
time that you’re someone else entirely — a mighty swordsman, a dangerous
wizard, a sly and cunning rogue — and that all the evil in the world can be
beaten senseless with a broadsword or a wand of fiery bolt. In fact, for a lot 
of people, roleplaying (the process of pretending you’re someone else) is the
whole reason they play the game. Character statistics and game rules just
help you figure out what happens next.
In this chapter, we tell you about the art of roleplaying and show you how to
breathe personality, life, and purpose into your character. We also take a look
at ways you can make yourself appreciated by everyone else at the table,
both as a character and a player.
Roleplaying with Style
D&D is very entertaining as a pure tactical exercise; many players are per-
fectly content to view the game as consisting of puzzles to be solved, many 
of which involve fantastic combat scenarios. But the game really shines when
you make an effort to get out of your own skin and put yourself in the place 
of the character you’ve brought to the table. After all, in real life, you’d run

screaming from a howling, blood-maddened werewolf intent on ripping your
throat out and tearing you limb from limb. But your dashing rogue Saros can
stand his ground calmly, rapier in hand, and even make a quip about his fear-
some foe. It’s not that much more of a leap to think about how Saros might
respond to other sorts of challenges and situations.
Choosing your character’s alignment
One of the fundamental guides for playing your character is alignment.
Alignment is a quick summary of what your character stands for and how he
or she tries to live life. Your choice marks your character as a good guy or a
bad guy, and alignment allows you to quickly determine how other folks in
the world see your character — and how you should see others. For example,
you can see at a glance that a lawful good dwarf probably has nothing kind to
say to a chaotic evil orc, and vice versa.
Alignment consists of a straightforward good-unaligned-evil scale, with an
important detail added: Some good creatures are also lawful, and some evil
creatures are also chaotic. In other words, there are really two good align-
ments — good and lawful good. Likewise, there are two evil alignments — 
evil and chaotic evil. In addition, many creatures are simply unaligned.
Here’s a quick primer on these five choices:
 Good: You believe it is right to aid and protect those in need. You don’t
have to be completely altruistic, but you’re willing to make personal 
sacrifices to help others if that’s what it takes. Good characters accept
authority and order, but if they have to break rules to help people, they
don’t hesitate to do so.
 Lawful good: You also believe in aiding those who need your help, but
you think the best way to do that is by establishing and defending just
laws and benevolent order. Lawful good characters would rather work
“within the system” when laws fail to protect those who need help, but
they don’t mindlessly acquiesce to misused authority; they feel morally
obligated to challenge injustice in any guise.
 Evil: You’re willing to hurt or oppress other people to get ahead. Maybe
you lack compassion or maybe you think moral conventions shackle 
you and keep you from taking what’s yours. Or maybe you wallow in the
vile, the despicable, and the depraved, celebrating evil gods and hurting
others for the sheer pleasure of it. Evil characters often build social
orders that are cruel or tyrannical, and they can be zealous supporters
of such systems.
 Chaotic evil: You share the evil character’s willingness to hurt or
oppress others to get what you want, but you simply don’t respect any
social order or convention other than might makes right. In the absence
of any strong authority that can compel your grudging obedience, you
276
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

seek to gratify your every impulse, no matter how cruel or debased.
Chaotic evil characters generally lead lives of plunder, cruelty, and
avarice; the only question is whether they do so openly or hide their
wickedness.
 Unaligned: You haven’t taken a stand for good or evil yet. Many people
and creatures in the D&D world are unaligned. Animals, for example,
aren’t good or evil; they just are. People can be kind and benevolent
without having the good alignment, and likewise they can be violent 
and dangerous without having the evil alignment (a barbarian tribe or
guild of thieves, for example).
Your character’s code of behavior and personal standards should reflect 
his or her alignment. For example, if your character is good, he or she acts 
as his or her conscience dictates to help people, without caring about what
other people expect of him or her. The character especially hates it when
people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. On the other hand,
an evil character might play by the rules but has no mercy or compassion. 
He or she seeks power and wealth, and doesn’t care who gets hurt on his or
her way up — but he or she generally adheres to the codes, laws, or stan-
dards of his or her race or society, using these as tools to further his or her
own ends.
You can read more about how your character’s alignment influences his or
her approach to life on page 19 of the Player’s Handbook. 
What alignment you choose is generally up to you, but the vast majority of
D&D player characters are good, lawful good, or unaligned. Your Dungeon
Master may warn you that your character’s actions are not conforming to his
or her chosen alignment. If you have your character act in an evil manner,
your DM may rule that your alignment is, in fact, evil — evil is as evil does,
after all.
Be careful about playing an evil character. Many DMs prefer that all the char-
acters in the party be good or unaligned. It makes a lot more sense for heroic
characters to take up adventures about protecting the innocent or stopping
the depredations of evil monsters. It’s also easier for non-evil characters to
cooperate within the party. The game works fine no matter what alignment
you choose, but you should check with the DM before you decide on an evil
alignment for your character.
Building a persona
Alignment is a pretty broad brush to paint with. It tells you something about
what your character stands for and how he or she thinks the universe ought
to run, but it doesn’t tell you much about his or her personality. Consider 
the lawful good paladin: You’re just a goody two-shoes, right? Well, you might
play that paladin as a saintly martyr, a beatific and blameless agent of good
277
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

who goes willingly to face nigh-certain death in the service of his or her deity.
Or the character might be a grim crusader, tireless and unswerving in his 
or her determination to bring justice to evil wherever it lurks. Or you might
even play that paladin as a great captain, a bold and courageous knight 
who urges on his or her companions with never-say-die cheerfulness and
confidence. How you play that character is up to you.
Personas tend to evolve in play; your character ought to learn from his or 
her adventures and experiences, just like a real person does. Chapter 2 of the
Player’s Handbook offers some advice for crafting your imaginary persona:
Consider situations when roleplaying opportunities abound and think of 
one or two salient traits that your character shows in such situations. For
example:
 Social interactions: When your character speaks with a nonplayer char-
acter outside of combat, you’re engaged in a social interaction. How do
other characters perceive you in such situations? Are you charming or
dour? Talkative or laconic? How trusting are you? Naïve or skeptical?
 Decision points: When your character has to choose between several
different courses of action — for example, whether to launch a frontal
assault on a villain’s lair or find some way to insinuate himself or herself
into the ranks of the villain’s minions — you face a decision point.
Usually decision points are debates among the players about what their
characters ought to try next in the adventure. Not only do you want 
to make a sound decision, but you’d like that decision to be something
your character would logically argue for. In such decisions, are you
assertive or easygoing? Pragmatic or unflinchingly honest? Hard-hearted
or compassionate?
 Dire straits: When things take a dangerous or unpleasant turn, you’re 
in dire straits. There’s nothing like it for revealing character. When the
chips are down, how do you respond? Are you brave, reckless, or cau-
tious? Do setbacks fill you with the desire to seek vengeance or do you
shrug them off? How are your nerves under stress? Are you impulsive 
or patient?
In conjunction with your character’s alignment, race, and class, you should
have enough to craft a reasonably unique character. Some traits may be a
little hard to reconcile with your alignment, but maybe those traits are weak-
nesses or failings — places where your character doesn’t quite measure 
up to his or her self-imposed standards. 
Creating mannerisms
After you figure out what your character stands for and what sort of person-
ality he or she has, think of ways that you can portray that easily and consis-
tently at the gaming table. You don’t have to view each D&D session as a 
278
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

trip to the Renaissance Faire in full costume, but if you can think of a couple
of memorable “hooks” to use at the table, you’ll find that the other players
have an easier time envisioning who your character is and what he or she
stands for.
Habitual sayings
Does your character have any distinctive trademark phrases or battle cries?
If you can’t think of any, look to your character’s choice of deity. Dwarves
often worship Moradin, the god of the forge. If you’re playing a dwarf, you
could do worse than to swear, “By Moradin’s beard!” or “Moradin’s hammer,
what a bad idea that was!”
Voice or speech pattern
Take on a unique character voice or way of speaking that you can manage so
easily you forget you’re doing it. If you’re playing a dwarf, growl and splutter
and talk as if you’re angry. If you’re playing a fighter with a low Intelligence
score, frown seriously and speak slowly, as if you’re working hard to sort out
what you’re trying to say. If you’re playing a pretentious tiefling or imperious
wizard, refer to yourself in the third person, or even use the “royal we.”
Maybe your chivalrous paladin even uses a few “thees” and “thous.” If Thor
can shout, “I SAY THEE NAY!” in Marvel Comics, it’ll work for you at the
gaming table.
Gestures
Gestures are a little harder because there’s only so much you can do while
seated at a table. But maybe your pious cleric Jorhune steeples his fingers in
front of his chest when he speaks, whereas your devious rogue Shadow rubs
her hands together avariciously, or your intellectual wizard Evard strokes his
beard (or chin, if you lack the necessary facial hair) and casts his eyes up
toward the ceiling while he contemplates a decision. Facial expressions are
good ground for role playing, too. You can scowl or glower, stare stupidly
with a slack-jawed expression, or squint crookedly and mutter to yourself.
(We just sort of hope you don’t do those things normally, so that your friends
can actually detect that your efforts are roleplaying.)
Favored tactics
Here’s an easy one that doesn’t require any out-of-your-skin acting at all: Pick
a couple of battle techniques your character likes to use and make those
your favored tactics. If your fighter recklessly charges into battle and always
uses his Power Attack feat on the first round of combat, that’s a distinctive
hook — everybody at the table will start looking for you to try it in every
fight. Maybe your wizard loves lightning spells, and so uses lightning bolt in
preference to any other spell. Look for trademark maneuvers and try to put
your own distinctive stamp on them.
279
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

Knowing when to stop
Believe it or not, it’s possible to have too much of a good thing. Different 
D&D groups have different standards for how much roleplaying is the right
amount; we’ve played in very entertaining game sessions in which no dice
were rolled at all because the nights were taken up with tense negotiations or
tricky sets of investigations and interviews, all resolved purely in “character
voice.” But sometimes you need to stop talking and start rolling the dice. If
D&D had referees who kept an eye on your roleplaying, here are three things
that would draw penalty flags:
 Delay of game: Sometimes a dungsweeper is just a dungsweeper. Don’t
expect that you have to engage in meaningful conversation with every
nonplayer character (NPC) your character happens upon. We’ve seen
people spend 30 minutes of real-time haggling with a shopkeeper over
the price of a pick and shovel. For goodness’ sake, just have your char-
acter throw a couple of gold pieces on the counter and get on with 
the real adventure! You might not have noticed the other players at the
table gnawing off their own ears because you won’t give it a rest.
 Excessive roleplaying: A little bit of real-world acting goes a long way.
Talk in a funny accent, scowl and glare a lot, use acidic sarcasm (hope-
fully not directed at other players), but don’t take it too far. We’ve seen a
player who insisted on perching on her chair and screeching unintelligi-
bly because her druid character was wildshaped into an eagle. When
you freak out or annoy the other players, you’re roleplaying excessively.
 Intentional grounding: Try not to have your character take stupid or
counterproductive actions because you think that’s what your character
should do. For example: “Well, Kerro is scared of undead, so I guess I’ll
spend this round yammering in terror. Oh, I know I made my saving
throw. But I think it’s what Kerro would do.” Be a little helpful to the rest
of the party and roleplay Kerro overcoming his fright enough to swing a
sword or cast a spell, even though he’s shaking in his boots. Your friends
will like Kerro much better that way.
Working Together
Every character in the D&D game is the best at something, but no character
can be the best at everything. What that means is simple: Good teamwork 
is a skill of vital importance to a D&D party. Learning how to cooperate with
the other players at the table and work together effectively is important.
 The first rule of working together is building a balanced adventuring
party. Try to cover the four character roles: defender, striker, controller,
and leader. Every character class has strengths and weaknesses; for
example, if everyone in the group plays wizards, all the characters will
280
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

be terribly vulnerable to monsters fast enough to reach them before
they can drop the monsters with their spells. A party of nothing but
fighters has no way to sneak past the iron golem guardian, but a rogue
might be able to slip through the room with good Stealth checks, or 
a wizard might be able to overcome the obstacle with a well-timed 
invisibility spell.
 The second rule of working together is making sure that everybody
has the opportunity to do what he or she does best. For example, don’t
put the party’s rogue in the position of being a front-line defender; make
sure the fighter in the party is standing in front of the bad guys so that
the rogue has the opportunity to maneuver for a flank attack.
 The third rule of working together is staying on top of what your
allies are trying to do. If your party’s wizard is about to unleash a fire-
ball spell, don’t have your fighter run right into the middle of the orc
warriors to launch an attack — the wizard won’t be able to throw his or
her spell without endangering your character. Don’t be afraid to engage
in a little “table-talk” and ask other players what they’re planning. Most
DMs don’t mind a reasonable amount of table-talk, as long as you don’t
start designing ten-step battle plans in the middle of combat.
Cooperating in a fight
As you might expect, the most important place to use good teamwork and
cooperative tactics is in a fight. When you fail to cooperate outside of
combat, the result is usually not too much more serious than a delay of some
kind. When you fail to cooperate in a fight, you’re likely to get somebody’s
character killed. Death is not a permanent career-ender in D&D, but it’s no
fun, either. It costs a lot of gold pieces to bring a character back from the
dead, so it behooves everybody at the table to work hard to make sure that
nobody’s character gets killed.
Cooperative tactic #1: Flanking
The first tactic everybody should use is flanking. Flanking involves catching
monsters directly between two allies. If you and your buddy can work
together to flank a monster, you each gain combat advantage over that mon-
ster, which means a +2 bonus on your attack rolls. Moreover, if one or the
other of you happens to be playing a rogue, that player will also get bonus
sneak attack damage against the flanked foe.
If you don’t have enough friends available to flank a monster (or it’s just 
too dangerous to move to a flanking position), there are other ways to gain
combat advantage. For example, the cleric power spiritual weapon grants
combat advantage to all the cleric’s allies against the target of the prayer.
Similarly, powers that stun or knock prone can also generate combat 
advantage for the rest of the party.
281
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

Cooperative tactic #2: Aiding another
When you’re fighting an enemy who is very hard to hit, or you need to give 
a character in trouble the best defense possible against an attack, consider
using the aid another action. (You can find a description of this action on
page 287 of the Player’s Handbook.) Instead of making an attack against your
foe, you can make a melee attack against an AC of 10. If you succeed, one ally
of your choice gains either a +2 attack bonus or a +2 Armor Class bonus.
Here’s an example: Say two characters are fighting an opponent with an
Armor Class of 24. One character has an attack bonus of +5 and deals an aver-
age of 5.5 points of damage per hit, and the other has an attack bonus of +8
and deals an average of 11 points of damage per hit. If they both just attack,
the expected damage is 2.75 plus 0.55, or 3.3 points of damage per round. If
the weaker character aids the better, there’s an 80 percent chance the aver-
age damage output jumps to 3.85, because the weaker character successfully
aids another on a roll of 5 or higher. (There’s a 20 percent chance the damage
output drops to 2.75, too.) That averages out to an expected damage output
of 3.63 instead of 3.3 for attacking separately.
Cooperative tactic #3: Delaying
It’s only natural to jump up the instant your turn comes around and whack
the bad guys. But sometimes the smartest way to play is to be a little patient.
If you think that you have an ally who will move before the monster does, you
can delay your action and wait for your ally to get into position. By waiting,
you might give yourself and your friend the benefit of making a flanking
attack when that opportunity didn’t exist before.
Delaying is also a good tactic when you have allies on your side who have
powers that might help everyone attack. If the cleric in your party is about 
to cast a bless prayer, you can simply wait to make your attack until after the
cleric casts his or her prayer. Now you have a free +1 bonus on your attack
roll that didn’t exist before the cleric took his or her turn. Obviously, if the
cleric’s turn comes up after the monster(s) take their turn, you might not
want to wait. But keep an eye on the initiative order in the fight and look for
opportunities to coordinate your actions for the greatest effect.
Buffing your teammates
The term buffing means improving a character with magic or special abilities
so that he or she can fight better. A power such as the wizard spell resistance
is a perfect example of a buffing effect — the character on the receiving end
of this spell temporarily gains resistance to a single damage type, such as fire
or psychic. As you can imagine, this would be a great spell to help the fighter
deal with an angry magma beast. Clerics are especially good at buffing their
teammates because most of their powers buff their teammates in some way.

You can also buff your teammates by choosing powers that blind, daze, stun,

gives up combat advantage to attackers, so your allies gain a +2 bonus to
attack the creature you’ve affected. (However, you need to time your attack
when you knock enemies prone — they can just stand up again on their turn,
so it works better if you knock them prone right after their turn instead of
right before their turn.)
283
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

Saving downed characters
Sooner or later, it’s going to happen: Some character in the party is knocked
to 0 or negative hit points by a monster’s attack. (A character is dying and
unconscious at 0 hit points or less and dies when his or her hit points reach a
negative number equal to his or her bloodied number. For more details, see
the “Death and Dying” section in Chapter 9 of the Player’s Handbook.) Getting
that character back into the fight requires some real cooperation and clever
play, especially if the fight’s still going on. So what do you do when one of the
other characters drops?
You have two ways to fix a character sitting at 0 or less hit points: Stabilize
him or her with the Heal skill or use a power or magic item that heals the
dying character. When a dying character gets a healing effect, he automati-
cally goes to 0 hit points, and then you apply the healing amount — so you
never have to worry about a healing effect not restoring enough hit points 
to get a character out of the negatives. The Heal skill is by far the inferior
approach because all it does is keep the character from dying; use healing
magic if you have any at all. 
Try this short checklist the next time a character goes down in your game:
 Is the character beyond help? If your companion’s been reduced to 
negative hit points equal or exceeding his or her bloodied value, there’s
no hurry. The character is dead, and he or she won’t get any deader.
 Is the character in immediate danger of dying? A character reduced to
negative hit points won’t die right away; he or she makes a death saving
throw each round and must fail three times before he or she dies. You
don’t have to panic until the character misses that second death save,
so you might be able to wait for the right chance to aid him or her.
However, watch out if there are monsters standing around with nothing
better to do than finish off a helpless character. 
 Can you help the character? If you have no healing potions or spells
and can’t use the Heal skill worth a darn, you might not be able to do
much good anyway. You can stand over your fallen friend and keep a
monster from finishing him or her off, but that’s about it.
 Can you reach the character? You might have no way to actually get to
a dying comrade. If you’re threatened by dangerous enemies and might
cause your own character’s death by trying to reach your buddy, you
might only complicate the situation by trying to help.
 Can you afford the action to help this round? Usually, it’s good play to
try to get your friends back into a fight. But if spending your turn going
to your fallen friend’s aid will give the monster or villain the opportunity
284
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

to wreak even more damage, you might not be able to afford the luxury
of ignoring the bad guys to aid your friend. For example, if you have the
dragon down to just a couple of hit points, you might be smarter to try
to finish it off than to let it take another turn.
 Will you make the character a target by healing him or her? Generally,
intelligent monsters don’t waste actions pounding on adventurers 
who are already down as long as there are others still on their feet and
fighting. If you’re battling a berserk hill giant who lays out 30 points 
of damage with each swing of his or her axe, the safest place for your
wounded friend might be lying helpless in negative hit points. When 
you heal up your friend, usually you bestow a single healing surge start-
ing from 0 hp. Your healed comrade therefore wakes up prone and at 
1⁄4 his or her normal hit points. It’s almost always better to have your 
comrades conscious and on their feet, but make sure the hill giant has
something better to do than cut your friend in half when he or she
stands up.
Minding Your Table Manners
So far in this chapter, we talk about a lot of things you do to breathe life into
your character and to play your character constructively with the other play-
ers at the table. Now we broach a somewhat awkward topic: Your behavior as
a player, not just a person controlling a character in the game.
Most D&D games are regularly occurring social gatherings of a group of
friends who share a common interest. Just like weekly poker games, or
PlayStation slugfests, or bar crawls, or whatever it is you do for fun with your
friends, it’s just good manners to be a considerate guest or a pleasant host.
You want to have fun and help everyone else have fun; you don’t want to be
the guy or gal who’s making everyone else miserable.
The following sections take a quick look at five things you can do to con-
tribute to everyone’s gaming experience, and five things you ought to avoid 
if you want everyone to have fun.
Five do’s
It would be easy to give you a long list of things to avoid, but we don’t think
that’s as helpful as pointing out some positive steps you can take right from
the get-go to make game night more fun for everyone:

Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

 Think about what you want to do on your turn while other people are
taking their turns. Time is the single most precious commodity at the
gaming table. Most D&D sessions run about three or four hours. If you
take ten minutes to figure out what your perfect move is during each
round of every combat you get into, you’re taking more than your share.
Instead of everybody getting a chance to bash through five or six excit-
ing encounters in the course of that session, you might limit them to 
half that many. Plan ahead so that your turns don’t take forever, and
everyone gets to play more D&D.
While your friends hack at the monsters and the monsters hack back,
figure out which of your powers you’re likely to use when your turn
comes up again. Think about which foe you’re going to attack and
whether you need to maneuver or use any magic item powers to make 
it all work. Sometimes your plans will get spoiled by things that happen
when it’s not your turn — but sometimes they won’t, and you’ll give
everybody at the table a little more D&D for their time.
 Do the math ahead of time. By the third or fourth time you’ve attacked
with your longsword, you ought to know what your attack bonus is.
Ditto for the damage dice on that fireball spell you cast a couple of 
times a night. Don’t figure these things out from scratch each time you
pick up the dice — be proactive and organized. Look at the actions 
you undertake all the time and add up your bonuses and modifiers
before you come to the table. No one minds too much if you don’t know
your character’s carrying capacity off the top of your head, but you
shouldn’t have to figure out your Armor Class each and every time some
monster takes a swing at you.
Part of this tip involves figuring some numbers before you come to the
game, but the other part of this tip is hard for some folks: Write things
down in places where you can find them easily. We suggest using a 
standard character sheet for this sort of thing; you can find one in the
back of the Player’s Handbook or check out a thousand variations by
poking around the Internet. Wizards of the Coast provides free character
sheets in PDF format, which you can download and print out, at www.
dndinsider.com. 
 Exercise some common courtesy. If you told your buddies you were
going to meet them at 7 o’clock to go out to the movies, you wouldn’t
expect them to be happy with you if you wandered in at quarter past
eight. The same thing applies for a D&D game. Show up on time so your
buddies don’t have to wait for you before they start playing. If you find
you can’t be on time, call somebody to let ’em know you’ll be late. At
least that way your friends can decide whether to wait for you or to 
start the game without you.
Miss Manners is right more often than she’s wrong at the gaming table.
Throw in some cash for the pizza. Bring the chips and soda (at least
some of the time). Be a good guest. Heck, you know this stuff. Just be
considerate.
286
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

 Stay on target, stay focused, stay in the game. Every D&D game we’ve
ever attended featured at least some amount of senseless cutting up and
Monty Python movie quotes for no particular reason. Gaming is fun; it’s
a social activity. Part of the reason you’re at the table is because you
enjoy the company of the people you’re gaming with, and you want to
socialize. But try to recognize when people are trying to move the game
along and get somewhere, and when people are kicking back and shoot-
ing the breeze. 
When the game’s on, pay attention to what’s going down. If the Dungeon
Master is talking, pay attention! Nothing is more annoying than a DM
giving a crucial encounter setup, adventure background, or key bit of
NPC conversation, only to have one of the players pipe up and say,
“Huh? I was looking at my spells.”
 Help your friends to shine. This one’s a little tough. When you have the
chance to grab the spotlight, it’s natural to want to do exactly that. But
sometimes it’s actually more rewarding to let another player at the table
have that moment in the sun.
Try to look out for situations that a particular character is suited for 
and defer to that other character if you can. For example, if you’re 
playing an armor-plated fighter and the party needs to scout out a side
passage that might lead into a monster’s lair, you might say, “I’m the
toughest guy, I’ll go look.” Or you might look over to your friend who’s
playing the stealthy rogue and say, “Steve, Kerdigard’s no good at scout-
ing. I’ll follow your lead on this.” Every character at the table is the best
at something, so let your friends show off at the things their characters
do best.
Five don’ts
Now for the flip side — here are some things you should try to avoid doing at
the table:
 Don’t hog the spotlight. If there are four players and a DM at the table,
you should assume that you’re entitled to about one-quarter of the DM’s
time. If you insist on being the character who scouts every tunnel, tack-
les every puzzle, talks to every NPC, and dictates the strategy for every
fight, you’re being a bore. You’re not the star of the show; D&D is a
movie with an ensemble cast, so you have to expect that sometimes
other players will get good lines, too.
It’s usually okay to take point on something that your character is the
best at or to roleplay a long conversation that’s of vital interest to your
character, but remember that you’ve got the spotlight, and it’s good to
share it.
287
Chapter 21: Roleplaying and Working Together

 Don’t disrespect the other characters. Back in the Dark Old Days of
gaming, many players thought of D&D as a fiercely competitive game.
Squabbling over the best magic items in treasure hoards, stealing from
inattentive allies, or even bullying lower-level characters were accepted
behaviors in some games. None of that old-school garbage flies these
days. Who wants to use their leisure time to play in a game where their
characters get picked on, shoved around, or stolen from? We’d rather go
back to grade school.
So don’t slip the DM notes saying that your 10th-level rogue is going to
pick the fighter’s pockets when he isn’t looking. Don’t threaten to vapor-
ize your allies with a powerful spell if they don’t let you have the ring of
protection the evil wizard was wearing. Don’t sneer at people, run down
their characters, or generally go out of your way to let them know how
stupid you think they are for being in the same game with you. It doesn’t
play well in real life, and it’s just as unwelcome at the gaming table. 
 Don’t be a poor loser. It’s natural to want to be successful in the game.
When things don’t go your way, try not to take it personally. Sometimes
your character’s going to get killed in horrific and spectacular ways. It
happens.
We’ve seen more than a few players absolutely enraged, embittered, or
brought to the point of tears by the death of a beloved character. If you
play a long-running campaign and get attached to your alter ego in the
DM’s world, it’s only natural to feel disappointed when the game doesn’t
go your way. Try to remember, if your character’s never in any real
danger, there isn’t all that much excitement to any game. On occasion,
you’re going to have a character get mauled because the other 90 per-
cent of the time, it’s way more exciting to be worried about what’s going
to happen next.
Usually, characters get killed in one of two ways: You did something
stupid and it didn’t work out, or a monster just got lucky. When an 
ogre rolls a critical hit against your 2nd-level wizard and deals out 33
points of damage, well, the ogre got lucky. Why get mad about it? The
vast majority of DMs don’t start an encounter with the intent of killing 
a specific character, so don’t blame the Dungeon Master! That’s just 
the way the dice fell. Besides, truly horrific character deaths make for
great “war stories.”
 Don’t disrespect the supporting cast. Most D&D adventures are popu-
lated with a whole host of “supporting cast” — nonplayer characters 
the DM uses to populate the places your character visits. Sometimes
these NPCs are patrons or employers who give your character directions
to the adventure. Sometimes they’re sources of information, folks who
might know interesting rumors or who can point you toward useful
resources. And sometimes they’re nothing more than window dressing, 
288
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

a little bit of color the DM uses to give you a chance to roleplay your
character. It’s bad form to make the DM feel stupid for putting a “talky”
encounter in front of you instead of something your character can 
just kill.
So how do players abuse NPCs? One classic bit is acting like a thug or
putting on a show of sneering superiority because you’re pretty sure
your character is a few levels higher than the poor schmuck he or she is
talking to. We don’t know why some players enjoy the pretend-bullying
of imaginary people, but they do. Another common tactic is the “outra-
geous insult and take-back.” It runs like this: “I shove my wand of fiery
bolts up the baron’s nose and tell him his brains are gonna be all over
the ceiling if he doesn’t give us what we want. Ha, ha! No, I don’t really
do that.”
The point of all this is that there’s constructive roleplaying, and there’s
destructive roleplaying. While you’re slapping around the town guards
because you’re playing a 10th-level character and they’re 1st-level NPCs,
the clock’s running on the real adventure, and the DM isn’t having any
fun. You want to keep the DM happy and show his or her game world
some respect.
 Don’t argue with the DM. The Dungeon Master isn’t infallible.
Sometimes he or she will remember a rule wrong, forget that you’re
holding your action, or overlook an obvious plot hole in the adventure.
But it’s accepted gaming etiquette to let the DM run the game as he or
she sees fit. The DM is the guy or gal who’s putting in a lot of extra work
to make the game fun for everybody else. Cut him or her some slack.
That said, you’re within your rights to ask a DM to check a rule that 
you think he or she got wrong. If the DM says, “Joe, the evil cleric used
command on Kerdigard to make you attack your friends,” you can point
out that you’re not sure if the command prayer can actually make your
character swing at his friends. If the DM insists he or she is right, the
best thing to do is let it slide and go along with the way the DM wants 
to play it. That way you don’t stop the game altogether and leave the
other players sitting around waiting for the argument to resolve. You 
can always take up your point later on, after the game session is over. 
If the DM is spectacularly wrong, spitefully inconsistent, uses NPCs 
to bully your characters (see the previous bullet), or refuses to be 
questioned, you might be dealing with a pocket tyrant. You’ll have to
decide whether you can live with playing the game by the, ah, unique
rules the DM uses for his or her game, or whether you’d rather not let
this person tyrannize your gaming time. If the DM is a great storyteller,
maybe you can put up with his or her butchery of the rules. But if he 
or she runs a bad game all around, maybe someone else at the table
would be a better DM.

M
any players are perfectly happy choosing a character class and 
sticking to it, spending their character’s whole career getting better 
at the path laid out in the Player’s Handbook. However, some players are
fanatics about building the toughest, most capable, most specialized charac-
ter they can come up with. In fact, thousands of D&D players constantly
debate the virtues of various character builds and share their efforts with
each other in hundreds of message boards and mailing lists. When you factor
in the additional options for classes, new feats, new items, new powers, and
similar incremental improvements available in other D&D supplements, your
character-building options are effectively infinite.
In this chapter, we discuss the art of extreme character building and show
you how to use some advanced tactics to maximize your character’s
strengths while minimizing weaknesses.
Min-Maxing Your Character
D&D is a tough game on your character. Fierce orc berserkers try to hack
characters into quivering chunks of meat with huge axes. Giants try to stomp
characters into bloody paste. Dragons want to incinerate characters with
fiery breath weapons. And, as if that weren’t enough, characters spend most
of their time stumbling through dismal dungeons with fun features like pit
traps full of rusty spikes and the occasional yawning gate leading directly 
to an infernal plane of existence. To survive and thrive in this admittedly 
hostile environment, you need to build the strongest character you can 
put together.

The art of optimizing your character is known as min-maxing because you’re
maximizing your character’s effectiveness and minimizing his or her weak-
nesses. When you min-max, you’re looking for corners you can cut in the
game rules. You’re trying to make sure that you’re getting the most you possi-
bly can out of your character design. Some players look down on this sort of
character building, but we think it’s just good smart play.
Here’s a simple example: Say you’re trying to build a rogue character around
the special effects of critical hits. You should choose the feats Press the
Advantage or Surprise Knockdown because they offer good benefits on criti-
cal hits. For your preferred weapon, try to get your hands on a keen blade —
you can use a minor action to shoot for a critical hit. If you score any hit at all
with that blade, it’s a critical hit and triggers your feat. Because accuracy is
everything in pulling off that combination, choose an attack power that has a
high innate accuracy; anything that attacks Reflex or Will defense instead of
AC is generally going to be about 10 to 15 percent more likely to hit. That
means an encounter power such as king’s castle or bait and switch is the best
way to start this combo. Better yet, you want to have combat advantage
before you strike to make sure you have the highest possible attack bonus
and the biggest possible payoff on a critical hit — take the utility power
tumble so that you can get into a flanking position easily. Got all that?
Now, for real min-maxing, make sure your character carries a couple of keen
weapons. After all, your keen blade gets that “manufacture a critical” power
only once per day (well, it’s a milestone power, so it’s more like two or maybe
three times per day) . . . but if you have more than one keen blade, you can
pull this trick off more often. You probably can’t afford to have multiple
copies of your character’s best weapon, but if your character is a 10th-level
rogue, you can probably afford a couple of extra 3rd-level magic items; some
spare +1 keen daggers would be a great investment for you. Don’t tell your
Dungeon Master we told you!

Character optimization resources
You can build a bewildering variety of competent,
min-maxed characters using just the Player’s
Handbook. But wait, there’s more! If you like
exploring various character builds and assem-
bling the best characters you can imagine from
the material at hand, you’ll find that other D&D
supplements offer tons of additional options.
Check out the FORGOTTEN REALMS Player’s Guide,
the Adventurer’s Vault, and Martial Power just for
starters. (These three books are due out in
September and October of 2008.)
In addition to looking for new options in other
D&D supplements, you’ll find that thousands of
D&D fans discuss their favorite character-build-
ing tricks with each other every day. If you want
to find good character builds fast, we recom-
mend a visit to the official D&D message boards,
hosted by Wizards of the Coast, the folks 
who publish the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. 
You can find the message boards at www.
wizards.com/dnd.

Min-maxing strategies
There are three basic courses you can follow when optimizing your 
character:
 Maximizing strengths: Pick something your character does well and
throw every resource available into getting even better at it. A highly
specialized character is generally far more dangerous in a fight than a
character whose abilities aren’t as tightly focused. So, if your character
is already a good archer, maximize him or her by choosing archery-
friendly powers and feats at every opportunity. Arm your character 
with the best magical bow you can afford. Improve your character’s
Dexterity score as much as possible. Yes, your character will be a bit
one-dimensional, but if he or she is part of a balanced adventuring party,
you’re smart to specialize; your versatility lies in the fact that you’re
part of a team.
 Covering weaknesses: Make choices that patch holes in your charac-
ter. For example, fighters usually have poor Will defense. Choose the
Iron Will feat or buy a set of coldiron armor to cover that weakness.
Wizards are fragile in melee; choose Armor Training feats to improve
your Armor Class so that your wizard can stand up to more punishment
than normal.
 Increasing versatility: Broaden your horizons by making choices that
provide access to a variety of class features. For example, take advan-
tage of multiclassing (discussed in the “Multiclassing: Maxing Out Your
Choices” section, later in this chapter) to get access to a whole new list
of class features. If you’re playing a spellcaster, choose powers that have
multiple uses. If you’re playing a defender or striker character, choose
attack powers that offer a variety of effects other than pure damage.
Although all these are decent strategies for optimizing a character, many
experienced players believe that maximizing strengths is the way to go.
Here’s the reason: When you maximize your character’s strengths, you gener-
ally get to decide when to use them. If you’re playing a fantastic archer,
you’re in control of whether you shoot or don’t shoot in any given combat
round. On the other hand, when you cover a weakness, you aren’t able to
control whether or not your efforts will matter. If you build a fighter with a
great Will defense, you don’t get much benefit out of an encounter in which
your fighter isn’t threatened by attacks targeting Will defense.
Exploiting good interactions
The real art of character optimization lies in finding good interactions
between your character’s mechanical elements — pieces of your character
such as race, selection of powers, or selection of feats. Anybody can make
293
Chapter 22: Character Building for Experts

good choices about which feats to learn, what equipment to carry, or which
spells to keep handy. We’re going to look at making choices that synergize
with each other.
That may sound like a lot of gobbledygook, so check out this example. Say
that your character is a cleric, and you like thumping bad guys with your
mace. Here’s a good combination: First, choose a theme like thunder. Select
attack powers such as wrathful thunder and split the sky. Choose the Raging
Storm feat to gain bonus damage with thunder powers or the Solid Sound feat
to gain a defense boost. Make sure you arm your character with a resounding
or thundering weapon because those let you pull off additional thunder
effects once per encounter. As you can see, your choices in three distinct
game areas — feats, equipment, and powers — all work together to make this
character far more effective than he or she would be if you made any of those
choices in isolation and didn’t follow up with complementary choices in the
other game systems.
Here’s a quick checklist of game elements that you can mesh together to
make your character a true Frankenstein monster of min-maxing:
 Ability scores: Can you find a way to exploit your character’s highest
ability score(s)?
 Character class: Do your character’s ability scores make sense for 
his or her class? Is there another class your character’s ability scores
make him or her well suited for? If so, that might be a good class to 
multiclass into.
 Powers known: Does your character know powers that make the best
use of his or her key ability score?
 Feat selections: Do your feat selections make use of your character’s
best ability score and your character’s power choices?
 Equipment choices: Do you have the right armor and weapons for your
character’s ability scores and his or her powers?
 Magic items: Are there magic items that can help your min-maxing 
strategy? Would a more powerful weapon allow your min-maxing plan 
to work better?
Choosing a Paragon Path
When your character reaches 11th level, you get to select a paragon path —
basically, a second set of class features and some unique powers that
describe some sort of impressive and unique specialization in your character
class. For example, the cleric paragon paths in the Player’s Handbook include
angelic avenger, divine oracle, radiant servant, and warpriest.
294
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

You can find paragon paths in Chapter 4 of the Player’s Handbook, right after
the power descriptions for each class. Paragon paths are often featured in
many other D&D supplements.
All paragon paths share the same basic structure and offer your character
these benefits:
295
Chapter 22: Character Building for Experts
Want more choices?
If you want more paragon path choices, here’s
a sneaky way to do it: Choose a multiclass feat
at some point when your character is still in the
heroic tier. You now qualify to select a paragon
path from either your character class or the
character class you’ve chosen to multiclass
into. For example, if your character is a cleric
and you choose the Student of the Sword feat,
you can select any cleric or fighter paragon
path instead of just cleric paragon paths.

 Path features (11th level): Each paragon path offers several abilities
analogous to class features. For example, the Radiant Servant cleric
paragon path grants the features Illuminating Attacks (your radiant
powers score critical hits on 19 or 20) and Radiant Action (when you 
use an action point, choose an enemy to take radiant damage). One of
these features is always keyed to the use of action points.
 Encounter attack (11th level): You gain a new encounter power when
you select your paragon path. In the case of the Radiant Servant, it’s
solar wrath — a huge burst power that deals good damage to your 
enemies and also stuns undead and demons.
 Utility power (12th level): When your character reaches 12th level, 
you gain a utility power determined by your paragon path. The Radiant
Servant gains a power called healing sun, which heals nearby allies and
does minor damage to undead or demons.
 Path feature (16th level): You gain another path feature at 16th level.
For example, the Radiant Servant gains the feature Lasting Light — any
saving throws made by demons or undead to remove conditions you
caused receive a penalty.
 Daily attack (20th level): The capstone power for each paragon path 
is a daily attack power gained at 20th level. These are some of the most
spectacular and devastating attacks in the game. For example, the
Radiant Servant’s 20th level power is radiant brilliance, which deals
decent radiant damage to a single target and then causes it to explode
on the following turn, damaging all enemies standing nearby it.
Your paragon path is purely additive; it’s all stuff that your character gets 
in addition to selecting powers for his or her base class. In other words,
choosing a paragon path never detracts from your character’s ability to keep
advancing in his or her original class.
Epic Destiny for the Win!
When you reach 20th level, you complete your character’s paragon path, but
at 21st level, you embark on the final phase in your character’s legendary
career: your epic destiny.
You can think of epic destiny as your character’s road to immortality. Will 
he or she become a god and ascend from the mortal realms? A mythic king 
or hero, about whom stories will be told for thousands of generations? Or a
mighty champion fated to be reborn again and again, fighting evil over count-
less lifetimes? Whatever your epic destiny is, it’s the stuff that legends are
made of.
296
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

In terms of game mechanics, epic destinies work much like paragon paths.
Your character still continues to advance in his or her class, so you keep on
picking new wizard attack powers (for example) when your wizard reaches
23rd, 25th, 27th, and 29th level. In addition to continuing your existing 
progression, you also gain specific powers tied to your epic destiny choice:
 Destiny feature (21st level): Each epic destiny offers at least one feature
at 21st level. For example, the Archmage’s feature is Spell Recall — each
day you can choose one daily spell to use twice that day instead of once.
 Destiny feature (24th level): You gain a new destiny feature when you
reach 24th level. For example, Archmages gain Arcane Spirit — when
Archmages are killed, they can detach their spirits from their bodies and
continue the adventure in a ghostly form (although if that form is killed
too, that’s it for the Archmage).
 Utility power (26th level): When your character reaches 26th level, you
gain a utility power determined by your epic destiny. The Archmage
gains a power called shape magic, which simply allows you to regain 
any arcane power you’ve already used. (Considering this may be your
25th-level daily attack spell, that can be pretty impressive!)
 Destiny feature (30th level): You gain your final path feature at 30th
level. For example, the Archmage’s last feature is Archspell, which lets
you select one daily spell and cast it as an encounter power instead 
of a daily power.
Although epic destinies are pretty impressive, there are other good perks 
for epic characters. First of all, the feats available to epic characters are
extremely strong. Secondly, the magic items characters tend to collect at epic
levels include some truly awesome powers. A high-level paladin wearing +6
soulforged godplate armor has an armor bonus of +20, just from armor alone!
Add half the character’s level, a heavy shield, and a feat or two, and that 
paladin might be walking around at close to Armor Class 50.
Multiclassing: Maxing Out Your Choices
Perhaps the single best tool at your disposal for optimizing your character is
multiclassing: spending a feat or two to pick up class features or powers from
a second class of your choice. For example, your character might start out as
a 1st-level fighter, which gives you everything you’d expect. But after your
character gains a level or two, you might decide you want to gain some tacti-
cal command ability, so when you reach a level where you can select a feat,
you take the multiclass feat Student of Battle — warlord training. Eventually
you might spend additional feats (Novice Power, Acolyte Power, and Adept
Power) to actually substitute some warlord powers for the fighter powers
you otherwise would have learned.
297
Chapter 22: Character Building for Experts

You can find the rules on multiclassing in Chapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook.
There are some downsides to spending multiple feats on multiclassing:
 Feats you spend on multiclassing aren’t getting spent on other, more
direct ways to power up your character. For example, you could
instead use the feats to directly increase your character’s Armor Class
or effectiveness with a chosen weapon by taking the Armor Training or
Weapon Focus feat, respectively.
 Multiclassing is power-neutral. For the fighter in the preceding example
to gain a warlord encounter power, he or she has to scrap an appropri-
ate fighter power. That character is worse at being a fighter than he or
she would be without multiclassing.
That said, multiclassing is the min-maxer’s dream. Multiclass feats are usually
pretty good deals; for the cost of a single feat, you can usually find a decent
daily power and some useful skill training from the class you chose to multi-
class into. A single feat invested in cleric or warlord training (Initiate of the
Faith, or Student of Battle) gives your character the ability to use healing
298
Part III: Playing Your Best Game 

word or inspiring word once per day. Sure, it’s normally an encounter power
for a single-class cleric or warlord, but being able to hand out a healing surge
even just once per day is a very useful capability to keep in your back pocket.
The advantages to taking multiclass feats are
 Powers you gain through multiclassing let you break out of your char-
acter’s role. For example, leaders usually don’t have much in the way 
of high-damage encounter powers, but if you multiclass into a defender
or striker class (say, fighter or rogue) you can pick up an encounter
attack power that deals more damage than any cleric or warlord power
you can find at the same level. Likewise, fighters don’t have much in the
way of ranged attack powers, but a fighter who multiclasses into ranger
or warlock can pick up some impressive powers that deal damage 
at range.
 Multiclassing qualifies you to choose your paragon path from those
available to your class and the class you multiclassed into. If nothing
else, you can find lots of room for imaginative character-building with
this trick. For example, the Warpriest is a cleric paragon path, but it’s
quite attractive to a fighter as well. If you can imagine your fighter
“catching religion” a few levels into his or her career, you might find
Warpriest to be the paragon path you want for your character.
You can find the best multiclass opportunities when your character has a
very high ability score that’s useful for another class too. For example, Battle
Clerics, fighters, paladins, and warlords all care about Strength for melee
attacks; they’re natural multiclass opportunities for each other. With one
good score (Strength) your character can use powers from two different
classes. Table 22-1 sums up these natural multiclass affinities for you.

DM plays a cast of thousands and, in fact, creates the world
that the other players explore. Being a DM is like being 
a novelist whose characters are completely out of his 
control — because you don’t know what the heroes of the
story are going to do and how they’re going to interact
with the adventure and the game world, you’re just as sur-
prised by the shape of unfolding events as the players are.
With a good DM, the D&D game is filled with excitement,
wonder, intrigue, humor, suspense, and unforgettable
moments players will talk about for years afterwards.

T
he first and most important ingredient of a DUNGEON & DRAGONS game is a
good Dungeon Master. The DM serves as referee, judge, storyteller, sup-
porting cast, scenery builder, villain creator, monster player, and dungeon
crafter. Without the DM’s efforts, all the other players are left with interesting
characters but nothing to do with them. We can’t stress this one enough: You
need a DM to run the D&D game, and the better your Dungeon Master, the
better the game is going to be.
Ideally, you should learn how to be a DM by observing an experienced and
talented Dungeon Master work his or her magic — preferably by playing in
that DM’s game. However, we can’t promise that you’ll be able to start your
D&D gaming experience by landing in the hands of a talented DM. If you and
your friends are all pretty new at the game, someone at the table will have to
step up and do the DM’s job, and it might as well be you. Although it’s chal-
lenging to be the DM, and it takes a little extra time and preparation, you’ll
also find that it can be very rewarding. When you realize that everyone else
at the table is going to remember your dungeon for years afterwards, reliving
their characters’ triumphs (and failures) over and over again, you’ll under-
stand what we’re talking about.
In this chapter, we discuss the basics of being a Dungeon Master. We tell you
all about the role of the Dungeon Master in running the D&D game, and we
show you how to administer the game with fairness, consistency, and an eye
for dramatic tension. Before you know it, you’ll be one of those great DMs
that other players hope to learn from.

We help you get started DMing in this book, but if you’re really interested in
being the DM for your group and you’re craving more hints, tips, tricks, and
advice, be sure to check out Dungeon Master 4th Edition For Dummies (due
out in fall 2008).
DMing: The Best Role in the Game
If you’re new to the game, you’re probably wondering what in the world a
Dungeon Master does. There isn’t really a short answer to that question. As
DM, you run the game. You narrate the story of the player characters. You
play the monsters. You build the world. You design the dungeons. You hand
out the treasure. You play the villains, and you give the other players in the
game the opportunity to feel great about beating evil into paste with a
greatsword or a lightning bolt. You’re the director of this movie, and you’re
the person who’s going to put people on the edge of their seats time and 
time again.
Because “you do everything,” isn’t a particularly helpful answer, in the follow-
ing sections, we break down the big parts of the DM’s role and discuss them
at length.
Preparing an adventure
Are the heroes pillaging the long-lost Crypt of Azar-Malzz? Defending the
town of Pommeville from a plague of werewolves? Stomping out the cult of
Elemental Evil? Searching the depths of an old dwarven stronghold? When
you’re the DM, you decide what challenge the adventurers are facing. You
pick the monsters they fight, and you decide the stakes.
Preparing an adventure takes some extra work, usually between game sessions.
You need to design your own adventure or pick up a published adventure from
your hobby store or at www.dndinsider.com. (See the section, “Choosing an
Adventure to Run,” later in this chapter.) You should read ahead so that you
know what four or five encounters or situations the heroes are most likely
going to encounter in each game session, and be ready to run those encounters
on game night.
Building the world
So what’s outside of the dungeon? Is there a spider-infested forest surrounding
the place? Is there a town nearby? Who lives there? What sort of adventures
can the inhabitants point the player characters toward? What lies over the next
range of hills? Who built that ruined castle, and who or what lives there now?

Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

Running a D&D game gives you a perfect excuse to indulge yourself in the fine
art of world building. You get to craft an entire kingdom for the players to
explore when they decide to take a break from plundering whatever dungeon
you put in front of them to start with. Sometimes you simply use your world-
building to provide your dungeons and monsters with a place to live. Other
times, you’re weaving an intricate and living setting to serve as the backdrop
for the heroes’ story. Whatever the case may be, your players expect you to
know (or expertly make up on the fly) countless answers about what their
characters see around them as they travel through the world.
You don’t need to start by building a whole world at once; some of the best
campaigns begin as tiny kernels, nothing more than a dungeon and a nearby
town that the players shuttle back and forth between. Start small and answer
the questions one at a time as they come up.
Playing NPCs
As a DM, anytime the player characters interact with another person or intel-
ligent monster (also known as an NPC, or nonplayer character), you speak for
that being. Many DMs feel that this is the most fun part of the job; you get to
try out all kinds of parts, including power-mad dark overlords delivering vil-
lainous monologues, stammering stable boys, gruff innkeepers, shifty infor-
mants, imperious wizards, absent-minded sages, sinister dragons chatting
with the adventurers they expect to serve as their next meal, regal eladrin
lords too proud to ask for help, or slow-witted ettins who take turns speaking
with each head. The world is full of people and monsters for the heroes to
talk to, and it’s your job to figure out what they’re going to say and deliver
their lines.
Sometimes, this is pretty easy. When you’re starting an adventure by having 
a mysterious wizard hire the party to accomplish a specific task, you have a
fair idea of what the wizard wants, how she’s going to pay the party, and what
305
Chapter 23: Running the Game
Using a published campaign setting
A number of professionally designed campaign
settings are available in your friendly local
gaming store. A published campaign setting is a
ready-to-use world for your D&D game, usually
filled with countless ideas for adventures just
waiting for you to bring to life. Two good options
you’ll find out there right now are the FORGOTTEN
REALMS Campaign Guide and the EBERRON
Campaign Setting, both published by Wizards of
the Coast, Inc. Whether you prefer to build your
own world or use someone else’s is up to you, of
course. But even if you decide to create your
own campaign, you can find lots of cool and
interesting elements to borrow from in a pub-
lished setting.

she’s willing to tell them about the perils they’ll face on their mission. On the
other hand, players (as their characters) sometimes strike up random con-
versations with people you never expected to have to know anything about.
When the players ask the captain of the lord’s guard if he likes working for
Baron Duncastle, well, you have to decide what the answer to that question
is, whether or not the guard captain feels like sharing it, and how he’ll do so.
If you don’t know already, take a moment and consider what the NPC wants
to get from the player characters in the conversation that’s coming up. It
might be as simple as, “I want these people to go away and leave me alone.” 
It might be more complicated: “I don’t want anything in particular, but if they
drop a bag of gold in my lap, I’d try hard to be helpful.” It might be downright
devious: “I want these people to go off to Grimdeath Keep and tell me when
they’re going so that I can tell my evil master when to ambush them.”
Don’t be afraid to ham it up. Chances are good that you’re not a professional
actor, but who cares? Let it all out when you’re speaking for your monsters and
NPCs. You want the players to remember this person or monster and this con-
versation later, or you wouldn’t be having a social encounter now, would you?
Running monsters
Playing monsters is the other part of the job most DMs love. When the player
characters get into a scrap with a ferocious monster or an evil villain, you run
the bad guys in the fight. You decide what they’re going to do — which of the
heroes they attack, what tactics they use, and when they give up and surren-
der or run away. You roll their attack and damage rolls, make their saving
throws, and keep track of their hit points. We go into more depth about how
to run monsters in combat in the later section, “Getting the Most out of Your
Monsters.”
Your goal when you run the bad guys in the fight is not necessarily to find the
most efficient way to slaughter the player characters. You’re trying to chal-
lenge the players and help to build a riveting and suspenseful story. You want
each fight to feel distinctive and memorable, and you want to run the mon-
sters and villains as intelligently (or unintelligently) as they really would
fight.
The key ideas are excitement, suspense, and believability — not just running
up the body count.
 Excitement is all a matter of presentation. If you approach your material
with a sense of excitement, using active words and using a high level of
energy, then the players will pick up on your cues and the excitement
will carry through. 
306
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

 Suspense relies on making sure that you build toward a climax with pow-
erful and vibrant narration. For example, “Water drips from the ceiling 
of the dungeon corridor ahead. As you make your way, roll a Perception
check. Great roll! You hear a strange scraping sound in the distance, as
though something heavy and sharp were being dragged across the stone
floor. The sound is growing louder, as though the source is closing in on
your location.” Using a build up like this before you reveal the monsters
and start the encounter is one way to build suspense and anticipation in
the minds of the players.
 Believability is simply a matter of staying true to your material and to the
fiction of D&D. Everyone has already bought off on the suspension of dis-
belief needed to imagine a world of medieval weapons and armor, magic,
and monsters. You just need to help sell it by making the fiction real. Use
evocative descriptions that key off all the senses of the players—how
something sounds, what it looks like, what it smells like, what it feels like.
Use names that sound real and fit the fiction of your world. Bob the Slayer
is kind of goofy and will lead to goofy play, but Rundarr the Vile sounds
like a believable person in a D&D world. Keep it believable, and the action
of the game will reach a whole other level.
Adjudicating results
Most of the time, the game rules are clear. This is especially true with attacks,
power use, and physical skills such as Acrobatics, Athletics, and Endurance.
But part of the fun of a roleplaying game such as D&D is that a player can
have his or her character try anything he or she can think of — and a fair
number of those spontaneous actions are things that the rules don’t cover.
The DM has to make a call on the fly to decide whether these fun and unusual
actions succeed or fail.
For example, the heroes are fighting in an evil temple when one of the players
tells you that his character Baredd is going to kick over a brazier full of glow-
ing red coals so that it’ll singe the skeleton he’s fighting and kick up hot
embers in its face. Sorry to say it, but there aren’t any rules in the game for
exactly what it takes to kick over a heavy, solid metal brazier and make the
coals fly in the right direction. But it’s a heroic move that sure sounds cool,
so you want to reward your player for thinking outside the box. You have to
decide what kind of roll Baredd ought to make, how much damage hot coals
do, and whether the skeleton is even bothered by a face full of embers. (Off
the cuff, we’d say have Baredd make a DC 20 Strength check, the skeleton
takes 1d6 fire damage from the coals, and no, it doesn’t care about embers 
in its face since it doesn’t have any skin to worry about crisping. But we’re
ruling on the fly, too.)
307
Chapter 23: Running the Game

The best way to be fair as a DM is to be consistent. If you decide that a rule
works in a specific way, make sure you always use it in that way. Don’t play
favorites. Treat all player characters the same way, and treat your NPCs and
monsters the same way, too.
If you come off as a DM who doesn’t play fair, who treats some characters dif-
ferently from others, or who obviously cheats without reason, then you’ll
lose the trust of the players and your game will suffer.
Keeping up with the characters
Last, but not least, a good DM stays involved with each one of the players’
characters. In a perfect world, you’ll eventually get around to showcasing
every character in an adventure that’s tailored to that character’s strengths,
personality, and backstory. If your buddy Joe is playing Torvald, the paladin
who’s secretly an exiled prince of the kingdom of Erewhon, sooner or later it
would be great to create an adventure that pits Torvald against the evil baron
who arranged for his exile — and who now has his eyes on Erewhon’s throne.
You can’t do that with every adventure, but it’s a fine idea to run something
personalized for your players once in every two to three adventures, spot-
lighting a different character each time you do so.
On the nuts-and-bolts side, you also want to keep up with the player charac-
ters’ abilities and gear. It’s important for you to know just how tough the
player characters really are, whether they’re ahead of the curve or behind
the curve on arming themselves with great magic items, and what sorts of
feats and powers they have at their disposal. Specifically, you should be
aware of which paragon paths your players are angling for and what feats
their characters are trying to qualify for as they advance in level. Helping
your players to realize characters that are cool, powerful, and distinctive is
one of the real pleasures of DMing.
Choosing an Adventure to Run
Your first challenge as a new Dungeon Master is to figure out what kind of
adventure you’re going to serve up to the players. You have two basic options:
 Designing your own adventure: We cover this extensively in Chapter 24
of this book. Basically, you collect a suitable array of monsters and chal-
lenges and create a good plot or story to involve the players. When you
design your own adventure, you have the advantage of knowing exactly
what your players are like and what characters they’re going to bring to
the game.
308
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

 Using a published adventure: With a little looking around, you can find
literally hundreds of adventures published by various game companies.
Check out your local hobby store or bookstore for starters. A good place
to start is with the H-Series of low-level adventures for the D&D game.
(H1: The Keep on the Shadowfell, H2: Thunderspire Labyrinth, and H3: The
Pyramid of Shadows present enough adventuring material to take your
player characters from 1st level to 10th level.) Dungeon Magazine is an
outstanding resource that publishes adventures and adventure hooks
every week as part of the online D&D Insider Web site. Check it out at
www.dndinsider.com. 
A published adventure definitely saves you time and effort, but no game
designer can know exactly how your gaming group works or what sorts
of things your players are interested in doing, so you’ll need to cus-
tomize the material to meet your specific needs. And make sure you get
an adventure specifically designed for use with 4th Edition D&D so that
you can hit the ground running without the need for lot of additional
work on your part.
When writing your own adventure or choosing a published adventure to run
for your friends, keep your adventuring party’s character level and class mix
in mind. Ideally, most of the combat encounters in the adventure should have
an encounter level that ranges from one or two levels below the party’s level
(for an easy encounter) to two to four levels higher than the party’s level (for
a hard encounter). Check out Chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide for
more information.
Task-Oriented DMing
As with many things, the best way to learn how to be a Dungeon Master is to
just try it. Through trial and error, you’ll eventually get the hang of what a
Dungeon Master needs to do to make a game run. There’s nothing like jump-
ing in at the deep end, after all . . . but if you find this prospect a little intimi-
dating, then read on. As best we can, we try to reduce the DM’s job to a set 
of processes that we call task-oriented DMing.
Here’s the theory: Most game play takes place in one of five basic tasks —
talking, exploring, fighting, setting up, or free time. What you need to do as a
novice DM is identify what kind of task you’re currently engaged in and follow
the appropriate process. Table 23-1 describes each of the basic tasks.

follow these troll tracks we just 
found. What do the rest of you
think?”
It’s not always going to be clear what task you’re in at the moment. In fact, it’s
possible for one group to be engaged in multiple tasks at the same time. For
example, if the heroes just won a fierce fight against a band of savage lizard-
folk warriors, you might have the rogue searching the chamber for hidden
treasure, the cleric busily fixing up the fighter with healing prayers, and the
wizard quietly questioning the two villagers the heroes just rescued from the
clutches of the cruel lizardfolk.
Here’s a quick primer on prioritizing tasks:
 Setup. This is when you tell the players what their characters know about
the upcoming situation and when you let the players prepare their charac-
ters for the adventure. Set-up ends as soon as you have something else to
do. Usually, you go from setup into exploration or combat.
 Exploration is the default condition. If you’re done with setting up but
the PCs haven’t yet hit an obstacle or encounter of some kind, you’re in
exploration. Usually, PCs explore until they hit an obstacle to deal with
(see the following section, “The exploration tasks”), a character to talk
to, or a monster to fight.
 Talking trumps exploration. When you meet someone or something in
the game, it’s called an encounter. Many encounters take you straight to
a fight, but some offer the possibility of talking in place of fighting. If
there’s a conversation going on, resolve that first before you move on 
to any other tasks. Of course, fights sometimes break out in the middle
of conversations. When you finish your conversation, you go back to
exploration mode.
 Combat trumps everything else. If there’s a fight going on, everything
else can wait. The fight continues until one side or the other runs away,
surrenders, or is defeated. When the fight is finished, you usually default
back to exploration again.
311
Chapter 23: Running the Game

 Free time ends as soon as you have something else to do. Free time is
usually “time out” from one of the other tasks. For example, if the party
is exploring a cave system and winds up having a discussion about
which way to go and how to use their magic to move safely and stealth-
ily, you’ve put the exploration job on hold for a few minutes. There’s
nothing wrong with that; as soon as the players reach a decision, just
pick up with the exploring again. 
The exploration task
Exploration is the default state of the game. When you’re exploring, you’re
soliciting from the players some decision or direction about which way their
characters are going and what they’re looking for. Then you resolve that 
decision and continue until the heroes come to an obstacle, meet with an
encounter of some kind, or reach another decision point. As a general rule,
when running the activity of exploring, a DM follows these steps: 
1. Describe the options.
Tell the players what paths are available for their characters. For example:
“The rubble-choked stairwell descends into a dusty old vault beneath the
ruined monastery. There’s a large, dark well shaft in one corner of the
room with a low stone wall around it, a passage leading off toward 
the east, and an old wooden door in the north wall. What do you do?”
2. Get the players to tell you what their characters are doing.
Sometimes this might be a group action — “We’ll take the passage to the
east,” — or sometimes this may be an individual action, such as, “I’m
going to search the door for traps.”
3. Identify player responses.
Identify the action the player character is attempting to perform. Don’t
be afraid to ask a player to be more specific or helpful. If she tells you
something like, “I’ll go search the old well,” you can ask, “Are you just
leaning over the well to look down? Are you searching around the stone
rim? Or are you going to climb down in there?”
If you’re not sure how to resolve what the player character is attempting,
try the following:
• Is she trying to use a specific skill such as Perception or Thievery?
• Is he trying to shove or move something? (A Strength check may
be in order.)
• Is she just looking around? (A Perception check may be in order if
there’s anything to see or hear.)
312
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

• Is he trying to move on, in, or through something? (Athletics or
Acrobatics skill checks may be in order.)
4. Interrupt with obstacles or encounters.
If the player characters meet up with an obstacle, a trap, or a creature 
of some kind, interrupt the exploration and either tell the players what
obstacle the characters have met with, resolve the trap, or move to a
social encounter or combat encounter, as appropriate.
Some examples of this sort of interruption include
• “The door’s stuck. It won’t open. If you want to try to force it open,
you’ll have to make a Strength check.”
• “The inside of that well is smooth and slippery. You have to make a
DC 20 Athletics check to descend safely.”
• “When you step into the east passage, you hear a click and feel a
pressure plate depress slightly under your foot, and then a hidden
device shoots a steel dart at you! What’s your Reflex defense?”
(You then roll to see whether the trap hits and, if so, how much
damage it does.)
• “You hear a grinding, rumbling sound from the wall behind you,
and suddenly a hulking bug-eyed monster the size of an ogre
bursts through the wall and attacks! Roll initiative everybody!”
5. Advance to the next decision point.
Assuming that nothing jumps out and tries to kill the heroes, you can
move to the next place where they need to make a decision. If the heroes
follow a ten-mile long trail through the forest to the old ruins, and noth-
ing in particular happens during that hike, you can just say, “You hike for
about five hours, and then you reach a dark and dismal hollow in the
middle of the forest where an old broken tower stands in the gloom.”
The conversation task
Many of the most important challenges in the D&D game don’t involve any
combat at all. Player characters can talk to almost anything they meet.
Sometimes conversation is clearly not going to help; dungeons are full of big,
hungry, stupid monsters who want nothing more than to eat anybody they
meet and can’t or won’t introduce themselves properly first. And other times,
conversation is possible, but it just won’t go anywhere; not every castle guard
or innkeeper knows something that the players can use in their current adven-
ture (or any adventure at all, for that matter).
Conversations in the game tend to fall into three categories: avoiding fights,
gathering information, and asking for help. As a general rule, when running
conversation scenarios, a DM follows these steps:
313
Chapter 23: Running the Game

1. Describe the scene and the NPC.
Tell the players who or what their characters have met, what that
person or monster looks like, and what he or she is doing.
2. Decide what the NPC wants.
See the earlier section “Playing NPCs” for more on this. 
3. Give an opening line.
A good way to signal that this is going to be a talking encounter is to have
the NPC or monster speak first. Figure out what this NPC will say, how he,
she, or it will say it, and then deliver your opening line. For example: “The
ogre standing in the middle of the road squints at you and scratches his
chin. ‘This is Og’s road!’ He growls. ‘But you give Og some gold, and Og 
be happy to let you use it.’” Feel free to have fun with it and really play the
part!
4. Pursue the conversation.
Let the players respond to your opening line (or have your monster or
NPC respond to theirs), and then continue the conversation as long as
necessary. If you need to, take a minute or two to think it over, and let
the players know that you’re trying to figure out what the NPC or mon-
ster says next.
5. Say goodbye and hang up.
When the conversation’s over, make sure you let the players know that
this monster or NPC is done talking and that you consider the conversa-
tion to be at an end. For example, say something like, “Og counts the
coins you gave him, which seems sort of hard for him. Then the ogre
grins with a mouth full of crooked fangs and says, ‘Have good trip on
Og’s road!’”
The combat task
Running a fight can be pretty complex, but here’s the good news — there’s
little doubt about whether or not you’re in a combat encounter. If the player
characters are trying to kill someone or something, or vice versa, your job is
clear: You have to get the battle resolved before anything else happens. See
Chapter 8 for full details on combat.
Here’s the basic process for running the combat task:
1. Fix everyone’s position.
Figure out where the heroes and monsters are standing at the beginning
of the combat encounter. In a dungeon, this is pretty clear: If the heroes
bust open the door to Room 7, the Armory, any monsters that your
314
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

adventure notes as occupying Room 7 will be inside the room. If you
don’t know exactly where the monsters are in the room, assign them 
as you see fit.
If the battle is not in a dungeon, you may have to be more creative. In 
a wilderness setting, you’ll want to determine the encounter distance
based on how far apart the heroes and the monsters are likely to be
when they to spot each other.
2. Is this an ambush?
If there’s a chance that one side isn’t aware of the other side when the
encounter begins, figure out who sees whom first by making Perception
checks for the monsters and using the passive Perception scores of the
characters. See Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
There are four basic scenarios that you want to consider when deciding
who might be ambushing whom:
• Heroes storm the room. The PCs kick open a dungeon door and leap
in, swords bared. Usually, no one should be surprised; the bad
guys might be startled by the sudden appearance of the heroes,
but the heroes don’t know for sure that there’s someone to fight 
in the room. Skip the surprise round and go to initiative. 
• Monster jumps out. A monster is watching the place a hero might
walk into or through, and it leaps out to attack as soon as the hero
appears. The monster is aware of the hero, but the hero might not
see the monster before it attacks. Usually, it’s fair to have the mon-
ster make a Stealth check (maybe with a big bonus, if it has a great
place to lurk) and then allow the character under attack to make a
Perception check to see the monster before it springs. If the charac-
ter spots the monster, there is no surprise. If the character doesn’t
spot the monster, the monster surprises him or her.
315
Chapter 23: Running the Game
Using a skill challenge
Sometimes you want a social encounter or a
challenge encounter to require skill checks. Now,
a single skill check works in many situations, but
sometimes you want a social encounter to have
tension and drama. You can accomplish this with
a skill challenge. In a skill challenge, all of the
player characters participate (just as they do in a
combat encounter). The party needs to attain a
certain number of skill check successes before a
certain number of failures to win the challenge.
For example, you might decide that the conver-
sation with Og requires four successes before
two failures for the PCs to win the encounter and
get to use the road without a fight. PCs can use
any of these skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Insight, or
Intimidate to influence Og. Check out Chapter 5 in
the Dungeon Master’s Guidefor more information
on building and running skill challenges.

• Heroes sneak up on the monster. The heroes have a good idea that
there’s a monster someplace up ahead, and they try to take it by
surprise. The heroes are aware of the monster, but the monster
may not be aware of the heroes. Usually, you’ll have the heroes
doing the sneaking try their Stealth skill or use stealthy magic (like
the invisibility spell) to get close. The bad guys get the opportunity
to make Perception checks to detect the heroes; if they fail, they’re
surprised. Otherwise, roll initiative normally.
• Chance meeting. The heroes and monsters blunder into each other.
Maybe the heroes are walking along a forest trail when they meet a
dire wolf out hunting, or maybe they’re confronting a gang of ruffi-
ans in a bad part of town when someone draws a blade. Whatever
the case, neither side has any special advantage over the other;
the best thing to do is to just roll initiative and start the fight. 
3. Set out the battle grid.
Draw out the terrain or room outline on a battle mat, or lay out your D&D
Dungeon Tiles to create the encounter area. Then place the miniatures or
markers for the characters and the monsters in their appropriate posi-
tions. This will help players figure out where they can and can’t move.
4. Roll initiative.
Everybody on both sides of the fight rolls initiative to determine the 
initiative order for the fight.
5. Surprise round.
If one side surprises the other, those characters or monsters can perform
a standard action before the other side gets to act. See Chapter 3 of the
Dungeon Master’s Guide.
6. First round.
Now start resolving combat rounds by letting each participant (player
characters and monsters) take a turn.
A. Count down the initiative order. Beginning with the highest initia-
tive roll, resolve each character or monster’s actions for the round.
B. Monsters and villains act. When it’s a monster’s or a villain’s turn
to act (some bad guy you’re running, because you’re the DM),
decide what that bad guy is going to do this round. Resolve the
action. See the section “Getting the Most out of Your Monsters,”
later in this chapter, for advice on running monsters in combat.
C. The heroes act. When it’s a player-controlled character’s turn to
act, tell the player that it’s his or her turn and ask him or her what
the character is going to do. Resolve whatever actions the player
character attempts.
316
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

D. Finish the round. When everyone has acted, you’ve finished the
round. This is a good place to pause and take stock of what’s going
on. Are there other monsters nearby that might hear the fight and
come to investigate? Do the monsters decide to break off the battle
and run for it? (They’ll have to wait for their next action to begin
running, of course.)
7. Go to the next round.
After you reach the end of the initiative order in the first round, the
round’s over. Go back up to Step 6 and begin the next round.
A combat encounter lasts until one side or the other is defeated, runs away,
surrenders, or manages to call a truce. 
The free time task
You’ll begin most adventure sessions and most new adventures with some
DMing that isn’t really “on the clock.” For example, if you know that the play-
ers are about to go explore the Caves of Doom, you’ll usually provide a little
information about why their heroes are interested and how they got there. At
a bare minimum, you ought to say something like, “You’ve heard of a great
treasure hidden somewhere in the monster-haunted Caves of Doom, so you’ve
hiked into the Dragonbone Hills. You’re now standing in front of a gaping cave
mouth in the side of a hill. Any special preparations before you go in?” (That’s
an extremely minimal set up, but most players will cut a new DM some slack
and go along for now.)
Free time is also good for evaluating options and attending to tasks that take
time, but don’t need DMing. For example, if the heroes are going to rest up for
a week in town, the player running the wizard might look at you and say, “While
we’re waiting, I’m going to enchant a couple of magic items.” You don’t need to
run through any real process for this. Just assess the cost and have the player
pay up the gold pieces required. Similarly, debating the question of which way
to turn next in an adventure, or what adventure to set off on, is also a good free
time task.
Finally, even in the tightest-run games, there’s a lot of screwing around. People
sitting around the table will drop out of game mode and chat about movies
they’ve seen, how things are going at work, or memorable scenes from old
games. As DM, you’re not in charge of all this. We only mention it because it’s
important for you to recognize free time when the players happen to stumble
into it. Clam up for a few minutes, let the players gab or joke, make a trip to
the bathroom or whatever, and then get back into the game when you think
the players are ready.
317
Chapter 23: Running the Game

Getting the Most out of Your Monsters
One of your most important jobs as DM is to run the monsters and bad guys 
in a fight. The first thing you need to do to run a monster in a fight is to learn
where to find key information about the monster — getting a handle on the
format in which monsters and villains are normally presented. When you know
how to navigate a monster description or stat block, you’ll want to learn how
to make decisions for the monsters that make sense and suit the situation,
without cutting the players too much of a break or being too tough on them.
Figuring out monster stats
Monsters have many of the same critical numbers that characters do. They
have hit points, Armor Class and other defenses, attack bonuses, skills and
feats, and even ability scores. 
In most D&D supplements or adventures, monsters are presented in a stat
block. To run a monster in combat, you need to have an idea of how the
format reveals crucial information about the monster or villain in question.
Take a look at the nearby sidebar, “Harpy,” which shows the stat block for the
harpy monster.
You can find the key for reading the Monster Manual entry on pages 4–7 of the
Monster Manual. But just to help you out, here’s a quick look at some of the
more important pieces of information hidden in this format:
 Level and role: The monster’s level and role in a combat encounter. The
harpy is a level 6 controller.
 Size: Most monsters range from Tiny to Huge. A monster’s size influences
several other stats. The harpy is Medium size.
 Origin type and keyword: The harpy is a fey humanoid. 
 XP: How much experience the monster is worth.
 Initiative: The modifier for initiative rolls.
 Senses: The special senses a monster has, if any, as well as its
Perception check modifier.
 HP and Bloodied: The number of hit points this monster has and its
bloodied value.
 Defenses: The monster’s AC, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will defense scores.
 Immune or Resist: If a monster has any special immunities or resistances,
they are listed here. In the harpy’s case, it ignores 10 points of thunder
damage when attacked.
318
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

 Speed: The monster’s speed in one move action, counted in squares on
the battle grid. This section also discusses special movement forms a
monster may have, such as the harpy’s ability to fly.
 Attacks/Powers: The monster’s attacks and powers are listed next, includ-
ing attack bonus, what defense the attack targets, and damage. Some
powers can be used every round (at-will), some only once per battle
(encounter), and others can be recharged during the battle. At the start of
the harpy’s turn, check to see if its deadly screech power recharges. Roll
1d6. If you roll a 5 or a 6, the power recharges and can be used again.

For each attack and power listed, you have info about modifiers and
what defense the attack or power targets. When the harpy attacks, roll
1d20 and add the modifier for the power used (+11 versus AC for the
claw attack, for example, or +12 versus Will for the alluring song).
 Alignment and Languages: What alignment is typical of the monster
type in question, and what languages it usually speaks.
 Skills: If a monster has training in any skills, they are listed here.
 Ability Scores: The monster’s ability scores are shown. The number in
parentheses is the modifier used when the monster makes an untrained
skill check or ability check.
 Equipment: Finally, if a monster carries any equipment, it’s listed here.
Deciding what the bad guys do
After you’ve looked up a monster in the Monster Manual or created an evil
NPC and you know what that monster or villain can do, it’s natural to ask
what it will do. The stat block helps in this regard. In the case of the harpy, 
it switches from claw attacks and its alluring song power round after round,
occasionally breaking out its deadly screech power. Monsters with a few more
powers have more choices, but not so many that you can’t handle the deci-
sion making.
Any monster or villain should consider taking one of three actions each round.
Not all monsters will be able to use all three choices; for example, an ogre
doesn’t command any magic or have any special attacks. Just ignore the
choices that don’t apply. The three choices for a monster’s or villain’s action
in a given round are as follows:
 Hit something: If the monster or villain is standing next to one of the
heroes, it can make a basic melee attack. Use the monster’s basic melee
attack, whatever that may be; you roll a d20, add the attack bonus, and
see whether the score equaled or beat the player’s AC. (If the monster
has a basic ranged attack — for example, a goblin with a crossbow — it
can attack at range, of course.)
 Move: If the monster isn’t standing next to one of the heroes but needs
to get next to a hero in order to use its basic melee attack, it will need to
move and get into fighting range. A monster can move up to its speed
and make a single attack in the same round. Or the monster can move
up to twice its speed and make a single attack by taking a charge action.
(See page 287 in the Player’s Handbook.)
 Use a power: If the monster or villain can cast spells or has some other
kind of power, it can use a power instead of making a basic melee or
ranged attack. Use your discretion — some powers can be used only
once, and others can be used again only after they recharge (see the
Attack/Powers bullet in the previous section).
320
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

Fighting smart, fighting dumb
Say you’ve got a half-fiend red dragon attacking the players. It’s got a fiery
breath weapon, awesome melee attacks, nasty evil spell-like abilities, and —
oh yeah — it can fly, too. Which of its attacks will it use on its next round, 
and which character will be ground zero for all this dragon beat-down?
The first thing you want to do is take a look at your monster’s Intelligence
score. Is it a voracious, mindless creature like a huge monstrous centipede? 
If so, the most realistic thing for that monster to do is simply move toward
the nearest character and try to eat him or her. That’s what big, dumb bugs
would do. Is it a clever and malicious opponent like a demon or devil? If that’s
the case, it fights with cunning and cruelty, switching easily from attack to
defense and using patience and guile if necessary.
Here’s some guidance on making your tactical decisions when you’re running
a monster or villain:
 Intelligent foes plan, but dumb foes react: A bugbear warrior knows
that the heroes’ cleric can heal up the good guys as fast as the warrior
can carve them up, so he goes after the cleric with a vengeance. A dire
wolf is much more likely to whirl and snap at the last character who 
hurt it.
 Lead with your best: Most monsters don’t save their best attack for last.
An evil wizard doesn’t go through a battle throwing minor powers
around when he has major powers to use. The game assumes that mon-
sters use their best attacks.
 Rolling to pick a target: If you honestly don’t know which character a
monster is more likely to attack, there’s nothing wrong with deciding the
monster will randomly pick which PC to attack — for example, if four
characters are within range, assign each a number and roll a d4; if two
characters are close, simply roll a d6 and call evens for one PC and odds
for the other.

Chapter 24
Building a Dungeon
In This Chapter
 Exploring adventure creation
 Using a sample dungeon
I
n the previous chapter, we examine the Dungeon Master’s role in running 
a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. In this chapter, we examine the basics of
adventure creation. Adventure is the framework through which players work
together to create memorable tales of fantasy and adventure. An adventure
can be an epic tale that spans multiple locations, but at its heart, an adven-
ture focuses on the dungeon.
In this chapter, we look at creating encounters, which are the building blocks
of adventures. In the end, we get to the roots of D&D and provide you with a
classic dungeon crawl to get you started.
Chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide goes into greater depth on creating
D&D encounters, and Chapter 6 of that book discusses the art and science of
creating adventures. Use the material here as a guide and to see one way to
construct an adventure, and then go to the core rulebooks for more details
and advice.
Creating a D&D Adventure
The player who takes on the role of the Dungeon Master has a wealth of cool
and intriguing ideas to share with others. Not everyone has the discipline to
write epic novels or the talent to paint vast vistas from his or her imagina-
tion, but anyone can find an outlet for creative expression and great fun as 
a Dungeon Master for a D&D game.
Bear in mind that when you create a D&D adventure, you don’t have to fill in
all the holes or connect all the dots. Unlike writing a story, where the writer
determines not only the beginning of the tale but the middle and the end as
well, the DM just sets the scene. What happens is determined by how the

player characters react and how the dice fall. The DM sets up the basic plot
and structure of the adventure, but he or she doesn’t come up with any of the
conclusions. 
This leads to one of the great enjoyments of the game: surprise. The DM
might know what monsters and scenes the adventure includes, but he or she
doesn’t know how things will turn out. The twists and turns of adventures are
often as surprising to the DM as they are to the players.
Parts of an adventure
Adventure creation may seem like a daunting task. The best way to approach
it is by examining the individual parts of an adventure. An adventure is a 
collection of related encounters that offer a rudimentary storyline. (An
adventure is also sometimes called a quest or a module, which goes back to
the days when the industry referred to published adventures as modules.) 
An adventure promises a story, offers challenges that allow each player char-
acter to shine, and provides opportunities for action and roleplaying.
The DM needs to think in terms of beginnings, scenes, and situations that kick
off action and offer players choices of behavior. “What does your character 
do now?” is a question DMs often ask players. Don’t think in terms of endings,
because you want your adventure to reach a conclusion through the actions
and ideas of the players and their characters.
The premise and motivation
An adventure starts with a premise, a hook that catches the players’ interests
and involves their characters in some motivating manner. Think in terms of
setup and build from there. The player characters can get involved in the
premise, but they need a motivation to carry on. More than one motivation
might suggest itself, and different PCs can have different motivations that
drive them to take on an adventure. Character motivations include greed, fear,
revenge, morality, curiosity, and need. Player motivation boils down to seek-
ing to gain experience to improve a character and to having fun playing the
game.
Here are some examples of adventure premises and motivations:
 Adventure premise: A hostile kobold tribe has claimed the abandoned
manor and is using it as a staging area for raids on defenseless travelers
using the nearby trade road.
Motivation: The adventurers are offered a large reward to stop the
kobold raids.
324
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

 Adventure premise: A scholar of ancient lore needs a group of brave
adventurers to explore the haunted graveyard and find the tomb of
Eldrup the Insane.
Motivation: The scholar offers the adventurers a valuable magic item
and ritual if they agree to find the tomb.
 Adventure premise: A gang of orcs has taken Oleem, the beloved pet cat
of the village elder’s daughter.
Motivation: One of the adventurers is extremely fond of the elder’s
daughter and hopes to impress her by rescuing Oleem.
You can imagine how any of these premises and motivations can create
adventures. You just need to sketch out a number of related encounters, 
populate them with monsters and other obstacles, and draw a map.
Encounters
Encounters are where the action and drama of every adventure take place.
Every encounter is kind of like a miniature, concentrated version of the entire
adventure. An encounter has a hook and a setup. It has a location. It has a
goal that, when attained, ends the encounter and pushes the characters
deeper into the adventure.
Encounter goals usually can be summed up by the verb that best describes
the required action — capture, defeat, discover, destroy, escape, find, negotiate,
obtain, protect, rescue, and survive are a few examples. In an encounter, charac-
ters might have to capture the master thief, discover the secret door, negotiate
with the ogre mage, or rescue the merchant from the mind flayer’s slave pen.
There are three types of encounters:
 Challenge encounters provide some kind of hazard, trap, or obstacle
that the characters must overcome to attain the goal. Skills, powers, and
ability checks are the tools that characters usually employ to overcome
challenge encounters.
 Combat encounters feature creatures or opponents that the characters
might have to battle in order to win the encounter. Combat abilities and
powers see the most use in these kinds of encounters.
 Social encounters involve a DM-controlled character (a nonplayer char-
acter, or NPC) whom the player characters must interact with to attain
the goal of the encounter. They might have to talk to, convince, bluff,
bribe, trade insults with, seduce, negotiate, intimidate, beg, or otherwise
interact with the NPC in order to advance the plot. A social encounter
can lead to or become a challenge or combat encounter, depending on
325
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

how things work out. Such encounters rely on roleplaying talents, and
skill checks are used to augment the roleplaying and to determine the
reactions of the NPCs.
Encounters are typically keyed to areas on a map. Only when the player char-
acters arrive at the specific map area can the encounter take place. When all
the encounters in an adventure take place within the confines of a specific
location (such as a dungeon), the adventure is called a site-based adventure.
This is the easiest type of adventure to create and run because the whole
story works off the map you draw and the encounters you key to it.
Adventure structure
Good adventures provide choices, points at which the players can make
important decisions that have significant impact on what happens next.
Choices can be as simple as providing the option to go right or left at an
intersection in a dungeon corridor, or as complex as giving the characters the
option to retrieve the crimson wand of doom or destroy it in the dwarven fur-
nace of the undercity.
Good adventures combine the different kinds of encounters and vary the
experiences they provide. Attack, defense, problem-solving, roleplaying, and
investigation should all come into play in varying degrees. Good adventures
are exciting. They provide rising and falling tension, building action, increas-
ing stakes, and fantastic locations that add to the ambience. Finally, good
adventures provide encounters that make use of the abilities of the player
characters. If one of the players in your group has a rogue character, but you
never provide that character with the opportunity to be stealthy and use his
or her rogue skills, that player will have less fun and few opportunities to
shine.
326
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 
Site-based versus event-based adventures
The adventures discussed in this book are site-
based adventures, meaning that they’re set in a
single location that is driven by exploration more
than story or a complex plotline. Easy to create
and easy to run, site-based adventures such as
The Tomb of Horrors and The Temple of
Elemental Evil are infamous among long-time
D&D players for their simplicity and sheer genius.
A more challenging adventure to create is an
event-based adventure, an adventure built
around a series of events that the characters can
influence through their actions. The characters
have a complex goal or mission that they must
accomplish, and the encounters that take place
are a direct result of that effort. There may be
maps for many of the encounters, but the events
take place over a course of time or as triggered
by previous events and keyed to a flowchart,
timeline, or some combination of the two. Chapter
6 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide provides more
details on these sorts of adventures.

Conversely, don’t restrict character actions or lead the characters around by
their noses just to make sure they get to see every detail of your adventure.
Don’t create situations where the PCs are spectators, watching NPCs accom-
plish all the important tasks. Beware of putting your PCs in situations where
they must be saved by the intervention of others — that’s just not heroic.
And don’t look for ways to countermand or foil what the characters are capa-
ble of. Design interesting encounters where they can employ their abilities to
the best advantage or use them in new and clever ways.
The end
Each adventure eventually comes to an end. As an adventure designer, you
should provide a setup for a climactic encounter, but how the adventure ends
depends on the players’ actions. The climactic encounter should take place
in a suitably impressive location. It should feature the boss villain of the
adventure, perhaps someone the characters met early on or someone they
heard rumors of but don’t meet until the final scene.
Sometimes an adventure finishes with a satisfying conclusion that wraps up
all the loose ends. Sometimes the boss villain gets away to challenge the
characters another day. And, once in awhile, the characters discover that 
the boss villain takes his orders from a secret, more powerful nemesis they
will meet in the future.
An adventure-builder checklist
As a beginning Dungeon Master, stick to the site-based adventures until you
feel you have the hang of the basics of adventure design. Here’s a checklist 
to help you get started as an adventure designer:
 Brainstorm the premise of the adventure and the motivations of your
player characters.
 Sketch a map of the adventure location(s) on a sheet of graph paper.
Number each encounter site on the map.
 Choose the opponents that will populate the adventure, from the weak-
est minions to the most powerful boss villains. 
 Flesh out and key each encounter with notes, tactics, and statistics. 
 Check everything over and try to think like your players. Look for clever
ways to overcome certain encounters that don’t necessarily rely on
combat.
327
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

To choose monsters that are appropriate for the party’s level, use the
encounter level rules, monster roles (refer to Chapter 4 of the Dungeon
Master’s Guide), and the Monster Manual to select opponents that create an
appropriate challenge for your party. In general, most of the encounters you
create for a particular adventure should have encounter levels equal to or
one level higher than the party’s level. A few challenging encounters can have
an encounter level that’s two or three levels higher than the party’s level,
while a couple of easy encounters can be one or two levels lower than the
party. The climax of the adventure can have an encounter level that’s three or
four levels higher than the party’s. The levels of all the opponents in the
encounter determine the encounter’s level. Just add up each monster’s expe-
rience points (XP). The total tells you the encounter level based on how many
PCs are in the party. (The sample dungeon later in this chapter provides exam-
ples of this in play.)
Here’s one final nugget of advice — you don’t have to follow any set order
when you create an adventure. You can start with a single cool encounter
idea and build an adventure around it. You can sketch out a map and then 
fill in the details. Be creative, have fun, and don’t sweat the details.
Sample Dungeon: Hall of the Spider God
This section explores adventure creation by providing you with a finished
sample that you can play and use as a model for your own adventures. It’s
designed for a party of four 1st-level adventurers — a fighter, a rogue, a
wizard, and a cleric. Use the ready-to-play characters presented in Chapters 3
through 6. It will be somewhat tougher if your party has fewer than four char-
acters, and a bit easier if the party contains more than four characters.
Adventure premise
The long-abandoned dungeon of the evil wizard Volnudar is rumored to lie in
the hills overlooking the town of Briston. In recent days, seven townsfolk
have disappeared and strange creatures have been seen lurking in the shad-
ows of the hills. The town elders have come to the reluctant conclusion that
something stirs in the hidden corridors that once reverberated with the
arcane evil of Volnudar. Now the call goes out: The town elders will reward
the party of adventurers who investigate the hills and learn the fate of the
missing townsfolk. The wizard is long gone, but something evil still resides 
in the vile dungeon.
328
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

What threatens the town and lurks in the dungeon? A band of monsters, led
by the bugbear Broot, have made the dungeon their home and have been
launching small raids into the town. They worship an even worse monster
that they discovered in the dungeon — a giant spider that Broot has named
Sperrin!
Using the battle grid
One side of the fold-out battle grid included at the beginning of this book fea-
tures a map of dungeon rooms and corridors. Use that map as Volnudar’s
hidden dungeon. The battle grid should be placed, map side up, on the table
within reach of all the players and the Dungeon Master.
If you have a vinyl battle mat or D&D Dungeon Tiles and some miniatures, you
can use those instead. Just use the battle grid in this book as the basis for 
the dungeon you draw on the vinyl battle mat or the D&D Dungeon Tiles you
lay out.
Using the character and monster markers
This sample adventure makes use of all the monsters provided as markers
along the edge of the battle grid. The statistics for the monsters are provided
later in this chapter. There are also markers that you can use to represent the
adventurers, one for each of the four classes presented in this book.
Place the markers representing the adventurers in the corridor near the
space marked A on the map. Let the players arrange the markers as they see
fit, as long as all characters start out in the corridor squares to the far left
side of the map. Remember that each character must occupy a space, and
only one character can be in a square at any time.
Put the monster markers to the side. Don’t place them on the battle grid until
the adventure tells you to.
Adventure key
The Hall of the Spider God features five encounters. The key is numbered, but
the encounters can occur in any order, depending on where the characters
explore and when. Refer to the keyed locations when the characters approach
or enter the numbered areas on the map (see Figure 24-1).
329
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

Starting the adventure
After the players place the markers representing their characters, as
described previously, the DM reads the following out loud:
“You entered the hills above the town of Briston at the request of the town
elders. Six members of the town have mysteriously disappeared over the
past few days, and the elders have offered a reward for their safe return or
an explanation as to their fate. You have heard rumors that an evil wizard
once called these hills his home and that his dungeon remains somewhere
beneath the hills. You also learned that mysterious creatures have been
seen lurking in the hills, and the elders believe that these creatures might
be the source of the trouble that has descended upon Briston.
“After much searching, you discovered an opening in the hillside. Now
you find yourselves in a dark corridor of shaped stone that must be part
of the evil wizard’s lost dungeon.”
Encounter Area A
Encounter Level — None
Not every encounter provides a challenge or an obstacle. This one simply
sets the stage for the rest of the adventure, and so it doesn’t have a listed
level.
Figure 24-1:
The key for
the fold-out
map at the
front of 
this book.

Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

The dungeon corridor where the PCs enter has a dank smell of stale air and
age. Lichen streaks the corridor walls, glowing with an eldritch light that 
provides shadowy illumination.
Ask the players to make Perception checks for their characters. To make a
Perception check, each player rolls a d20 and adds his or her character’s
Perception skill modifier. The DC for the check is 20.
Failed Perception Check (result is less than 20): The character doesn’t hear
or notice anything out of the ordinary in the dark corridor.
Successful Perception Check (result is 20 or better): The character hears
the distant sound of snorts and guttural laughter. (This is coming from
Encounter Area 5.)
Next: When the characters have looked around and made whatever prepara-
tions they want to, it’s time to move deeper into the dungeon. If the charac-
ters stick to the corridor and head toward the sound, go on to Encounter
Area 5. If they move toward one of the closed doors, go on to that encounter.
Encounter Area 1
Encounter Level 1 (400 XP)
When the characters approach the door to this room, read the following out
loud:
“The door ahead hangs open the smallest amount, revealing a narrow
crack of torchlight in the room beyond. What do you want to do?”
This is a combat encounter. Ask the players what their characters are doing,
based on the description of the scene you just read to them.
Inside the Room: The characters might swing open the door with wild aban-
don or send a rogue to sneak up and check things out first. Reveal the infor-
mation about the room as you see fit, depending on how the PCs approach
the area.
The room is lit by four torches spaced evenly on the walls of the chamber. A
solid table and chair are near the door, and a tall, muscular, fur-covered, bear-
like humanoid sits there, drinking from a large stone mug and picking at the
charred remains of an animal carcass. This is Broot, a bugbear who leads the
band of marauders that have claimed this dungeon as their base. He has a
morningstar (a spiked mace) close at hand, and he can make a Perception
check if the characters try to approach the room quietly. Also in the room 
are two kobolds, rushing around to make sure that Broot’s plate is full of
meat and his mug is full of ale.
331
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

Broot’s followers believe that the giant spider that resides in Encounter Area
4 is a god. Broot thinks his followers are fools, but he goes along with them
because, at the very least, Broot’s luck has changed for the better since meet-
ing the spider. He has named the spider Sperrin, and he plans to feed towns-
folk to it in order to keep his band happy and his luck running strong.
The far end of the room serves as a prison for the townsfolk that Broot and
his band have captured. Currently, three townsfolk (two men and a woman)
are tied up against the far wall opposite the door.
There is also a locked chest (DC 16 Thievery check to open) near the table. It
contains some of the loot that Broot and his band have recently collected. If
the PCs open the chest, they find gems and gold pieces worth 200 gp among
bloody clothes and dirty rags.
Initiative Check: As soon as the PCs notice Broot and the kobolds, or Broot
or the kobolds spot the PCs, call for initiative checks. Everyone rolls a d20
and adds their initiative modifier to the result. The DM rolls for Broot and for
the kobolds. The rest of the encounter plays out in rounds, with characters
and monster acting in initiative order.
Markers: Place the bugbear marker along the top wall of the room, two
spaces from the wall with the door. Place the two kobold markers anywhere
else in the room that you want. The PC markers start in the corridor. There
are no markers for the prisoners; feel free to use coins or some other items to
mark the positions of the prisoners along the wall farthest from the door.
Broot: The bugbear is a violent, savage foe. He’s extremely confident of his
own abilities and will attempt to defeat the intruding adventurers with just
the help of his two kobold servants. Use the statistics in the “Bugbear” side-
bar for Broot.
Kobolds: The two kobolds are cowardly, letting Broot lead the attack while
they help from behind. If Broot is defeated, the kobolds try to flee the room
and get help.
The Prisoners: The characters must defeat Broot and the two kobolds before
they can deal with the prisoners or the locked chest they find in the room.
They can easily free the townsfolk and point them to the way out after the
bugbear and his helpers fall.
The townsfolk seem grateful for being rescued but nervous and weary from
their ordeal. If the PCs ask the townsfolk about how they got here or what
else is in the dungeon, the townsfolk explain:
332
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

“Each of us was captured by that bugbear’s marauders — orcs and
kobolds of the fiercest kind. One of the orcs came in and took Elar and
Tob away about an hour ago. The bugbear laughed and told the orc
something about making sure that Sperrin knew where her meal was
coming from. When we were first brought here, there was a seventh cap-
tive, little Jammy the tailor’s son. He slipped free of his ropes and ran off
into the darkness. We haven’t seen him since, but we’ve heard the bug-
bear asking about him every time some of his marauders entered this
room.”
The townsfolk don’t know anything else that will help the PCs. One of them
has been hiding a handful of goodberries that he will give to the party as a
reward for rescuing them. There are five goodberries; each one restores 1d4
hit points of damage when eaten.
Experience Points Award: The party divides 400 XP for defeating Broot and
the kobolds, and for rescuing the townsfolk. 
Next: The characters should attempt to find the rest of the missing townsfolk,
little Jammy and the two prisoners taken to Sperrin.

Inside the Room: The floor of this chamber, unlike the rest of this dungeon,
consists of dirt instead of hewn stone. In the very center of the room stands a
5-foot wide circular stone platform. Atop the platform is a small, ruffled
young boy — Jammy, the tailor’s son. Jammy appears tired and frightened,
sitting curled in a ball and trying not to look at the room’s other inhabitants.
Two skeletons and two zombies surround the platform and Jammy. They
stand almost completely still, swaying ever so slightly, the red lights smolder-
ing in their otherwise empty eye sockets fixed menacingly on the small boy.
Long ago, the evil wizard Volnudar used this chamber to experiment with
spells designed to raise and control the undead. If any character makes a DC
16 Arcana check, he or she realizes that the stone platform glows with an
ancient magic that protects whoever stands upon it from the anger and
hatred of undead creatures. That’s all that keeps little Jammy safe from the
animated skeletons and zombies.
The room is completely dark except for the tiny lights glowing in the skele-
tons’ eye sockets. The skeletons ignore the characters unless they step into
the room. So, if the PCs can figure out some way to get Jammy safely out of
the room without stepping onto the dirt floor, their characters won’t have to
battle the undead creatures. If the characters do enter the room, however,
call for initiative checks. The skeletons and zombies move to attack and
destroy any living creatures that enter the chamber. The only space in the
room that is safe is atop the stone platform in the center.
Initiative Check: As soon as the PCs enter the room, call for initiative checks.
Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their initiative modifier to the result. The DM
rolls for the skeletons and zombies (one check covers both skeletons, and
one check covers both zombies). The rest of the encounter plays out in
rounds, with characters and monster acting in initiative order. Use the statis-
tics in the “Skeleton” and “Zombie” sidebars for the monsters.
Markers: Place the two skeleton markers and two zombie markers around
the square with the 2 in it (that’s where Jammy sits atop the platform). The
PC markers start in the corridor. Use a coin or some other item to mark 
the location of Jammy atop the platform in the center of the room.
Jammy: The characters must defeat the skeletons or otherwise get Jammy
out of this chamber before they can have a meaningful conversation with the
boy. Then they need to make a DC 16 Diplomacy check to calm him down
enough for him to explain what happened. Once calm, he tells the PCs that
the small lizard people chased him into the room, and he felt safe when they
didn’t follow him in. Then the skeletons and zombies rose up out of the dirt
and surrounded him. He tells the PCs the following after they point him
toward the exit:
“There’s something really bad in that room across the hall. Really, really
bad.” Then, after a pause and in a whisper, “It eats people.”
335

Experience Points Award: The party divides 400 XP for defeating the undead
creatures and/or rescuing little Jammy from the room.
Encounter Area 3 (Part 1)
Encounter Level 2 (500 XP) 
This is a challenge encounter that has a trap and a locked door.
When the characters approach the door to this room, read the following out
loud:
“The door ahead is closed. The heavy wood of the door features ornate
carvings of strange symbols that seem to glow with a faint light. What do
you want to do?”
This starts out as a challenge encounter because the characters must find a
way to get past the locked door. If they enter the chamber beyond, they face
a combat encounter and the possibility of a magical reward.
336

Skeleton
Skeletons are the animated bones of humans that wear the tattered remnants of clothes and carry
scimitars and shields. The only sign of life, other than the fact that they move with purpose and
menace, is the malevolent red fire that glows in their empty eye sockets.

The Locked Door: The PCs can check the door and determine that it’s locked.
The door also has a mechanical trap that, when triggered by a Thievery or
Strength check used on the door, shocks anyone touching the door or the lock
for 1d6 + 3 damage. The trap resets after one hour. Here are some options for
dealing with the door:
Perception Checks: Call for DC 10 Perception checks when the PCs start to
examine the door. Any character that succeeds notices some scratches
around the ancient lock. It looks like the marauders tried to gain entry into
this chamber and failed.
Searching: A rogue character can search the door for traps by making a DC 20
Perception check. If the check succeeds, the rogue finds indication of a reset-
ting mechanical trap, which probably discouraged the marauders from fur-
ther attempts to open the door. If the check fails, the door appears to be safe
and trap-free as far as the rogue can determine.

Zombie
Zombies are the animated corpses of humans that shamble about as they follow the commands of
their sinister creators. Half decayed and partially consumed by worms, zombies wear the tattered
remains of their grave clothes and smell like putrid death.

Cha: 3 (–4)

Thievery Check: If a rogue notices the trap (by making a successful Perception
check), he or she can try to disarm it. This requires a DC 20 Thievery check. 
If the check succeeds, the trap is disarmed. If the check fails by 4 or less, the
rogue can try to disarm it again. If the check fails by 5 or more, the rogue
springs the trap.
Unlock the Door: A rogue can attempt to unlock the door. This requires a DC
16 Thievery check. If the trap has been disarmed, there is no danger. If it
hasn’t been disarmed, any attempt to pick the lock (whether it succeeds or
not) springs the trap. If the rogue successfully picks the lock, even if doing 
so sets off the trap, the door can be opened any time thereafter.
Bashing Down the Door: If the rogue’s Thievery check fails, or the party does-
n’t have a rogue, the door can be bashed open. This requires one character
to make a DC 18 Strength check. This is an ability check; roll a d20 and add
the character’s Strength modifier. Here’s a situation where a special action,
aid another, can be used. One other character can help the acting character
to try to bash open the door. The helping character also makes a Strength
check, but the DC is 10. If the helping character succeeds, the acting charac-
ter receives a +2 bonus to his or her Strength checks. The characters can
make as many attempts as they want to bash down the door. The first time a
character tries to bash down the door, he or she sets off the trap (if it hasn’t
been disarmed). Each attempt to bash down the door, successful or not,
makes a lot of noise. Make a Perception check (DC 15) for the orcs in
Encounter Area 5 each time a character makes a Strength check to bash
down the door. If the orcs successfully hear the racket, the creatures from
Encounter Area 5 (see the later section, “Encounter Area 5”) start to move
toward Encounter Area 3.
Experience Points Award: The party divides 500 XP for disarming the trap
and opening the door.
Encounter Area 3 (Part 2)
Encounter Level 1 (400 XP)
When the characters open the door to this room, read the following out loud:
“The door opens into a thick darkness. What do you want to do?”
The PCs need some sort of light in order to explore this chamber effectively.
After they light a torch or otherwise illuminate the scene, read the following
out loud:
“The chamber features rows of dusty shelves and strangely shaped crates.
Cobwebs hang from the ceiling, and dust swirls in the air around you. Then
you hear a disturbing sound from somewhere deep in the shadows: a moan-
ing, threatening sound, and the shuffle of heavy feet slowly moving toward
you. What do you do?”
338
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

Inside the Room: This was one of the ancient wizard’s storerooms. Few of his
most powerful items remain, but if the PCs can defeat the chamber’s guardians,
they can find some helpful items and treasure here.
One human zombie and three skeletons guard this chamber. They were placed
here long ago by Volnudar and continue to follow the last orders they were
given — let no living creature enter this area and survive. Use the statistics
from Encounter Area 2.
Initiative Check: As soon as the PCs light up the room or enter the chamber,
call for initiative checks. Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their initiative modi-
fier to the result. The DM rolls for the zombie and skeletons. The rest of the
encounter plays out in rounds, with characters and monster acting in initia-
tive order. 
Markers: Place the zombie marker and three skeleton markers in the cham-
ber, two near the center and two near the far wall. The PC markers start in
the corridor.
Treasure: After the PCs defeat the undead creatures, they can examine the
room. Among the crumbling scrolls and dusty vials, they find two potions of
healing. It requires a minor action to drink a potion. After drinking the potion,
the character spends a healing surge and regains 10 hit points.
If anyone decides to search, the character that gets the highest result
Perception check over 20 finds a magic weapon wrapped in cloth. The
weapon matches the character’s primary weapon, except that it is a +1 
version of that weapon (meaning it has a magical +1 bonus on attack and
damage rolls and deals +1d6 damage on a crit). For example, if Regdar rolls
the highest Search result over 20, he finds a +1 greatsword that he can use
instead of his mundane weapon.
Experience Points Award: The party divides 400 XP for defeating the undead
monsters.
Encounter Area 4
Encounter Level 3 (600 XP)
When the characters approach either of the doors that lead to this room,
read the following out loud:
“The door ahead is closed. You can hear chanting coming from beyond
the door, but you don’t understand the words. What do you want to do?”
The doors into this room are not locked. The PCs can open them easily.
339
Chapter 24: Building a Dungeon

Inside the Room: The first thing the PCs notice upon opening the doors is
that great pans of burning coals (called braziers) are situated to either side 
of both sets of doors, filling the room with firelight and smoke. The second
thing they notice are the two creatures kneeling before a raised platform cov-
ering the left half of the long wall. The creatures are kobolds, but they appear
better armed and armored than the kobolds from area 1. Atop the platform,
tied up and obviously frightened, are the last two townsfolk — Elar and Tob.
The third thing is that the entire right side of the room is covered in curtains
of thick, clinging webs.
If the PCs enter quietly, they can surprise the kobolds. That means that each
of the PCs can perform one action (either a move or an attack) before the 
regular rounds of initiative begin.
When the battle is fully joined, Sperrin emerges from the webs to attack the
intruders. Sperrin is a giant spider that the kobolds worship as a god. The
townsfolk are meant to be a meal and a sacrifice for it.
Initiative Check: Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their initiative modifier to
the result. The DM rolls once for the kobolds and once for the giant spider.
The rest of the encounter plays out in rounds, with characters and monsters
acting in initiative order. Use the statistics in the “Kobold dragonshield” and
“Giant spider” sidebars for the monsters.
Markers: Place two kobold markers near the left side of the long wall. The PC
markers start at whichever door they opened. Use a coin or some other item
to mark the location of Elar and Tob atop the platform. The first time the
giant spider gets to act, place its marker on the right side of the room.
Experience Points Award: The party divides 600 XP for defeating the
kobolds and giant spider and for rescuing Elar and Tob from the room.
Encounter Area 5
Encounter Level 1 (300 XP) 
Two orcs start out in the part of the corridor marked “5” on the map. Place
their markers there when one of the following takes place: The PCs step into
a square more than halfway along the corridor, or the orcs make a successful
Perception check when the PCs make noise trying to open the door to
Encounter Area 3.
340
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

Use the orc statistics in the “Orc” sidebar for this encounter. These two crea-
tures can be encountered alone, or they can join the undead in Encounter
Area 3 to make a more challenging encounter.
Initiative Check: Make initiative checks as you have been doing throughout
this adventure.
Experience Points Award: The party divides 300 XP for defeating the orc
patrol.

Wrapping up the adventure
What happens after the PCs have successfully rescued the townsfolk? They
should return to the town elders and claim their reward (1,000 gp to split
among the party). They may want to return and fully explore the ancient dun-
geon. What lies in the corridors beyond what the PCs have already seen?
That’s up to you, as the DM, but you could use it as the basis of the first
adventure you create from scratch. Try it and have fun!

Chapter 25
Keeping Your Players Happy
In This Chapter
 Knowing the player types
 Providing challenges for all players
 Making sure that everybody has fun
 Deciding what kind of game you want to run
A
great Dungeon Master doesn’t merely run a good DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game; he or she also tells a riveting story. The D&D game works fine as 
a series of tactical exercises and problem-solving puzzles, but a great story-
teller in the DM’s seat can elevate the game to a whole other level. Building
interesting story lines and villains for your adventures and presenting your
players with the sort of challenges they want to face goes a long way toward
making your game memorable and long-lasting.
In this chapter, we tell you about story-building and storytelling in the D&D
game, and we show you some narrative, game-pacing, and campaign-building
tips good for any D&D game.
Figuring Out Your Players
The first rule of any enterprise is to figure out what your customers want and
give it to them. A D&D game is no different. If your players just want to kill
monsters and not think too hard, they’re not going to be happy with a subtle
murder mystery or combat-light court intrigue. Similarly, if your players love
to immerse themselves in their characters and enjoy the play-acting more
than anything else, they won’t be happy if you present adventures that don’t
give them opportunities to talk to the creatures and characters around them.
Most players fall into one of four basic categories:
 Actors: These are players who enjoy roleplaying for its own sake. Extreme
actors would be just as happy to play D&D if it had no rules at all. Players
who like this style of play often choose the ranger and rogue classes. They

like adventures that have lots of opportunities to talk to NPCs (not just vil-
lains and monsters), and they tend to dislike adventures that offer nothing
but combat encounters.
 Puzzle-solvers: This type of player loves figuring out riddles and chal-
lenges in the game, and not just by rolling dice as characters in the
game. Extreme puzzle-solvers would be just as happy to play D&D with-
out rules, just like the extreme actors. Puzzle-solvers often play clerics,
rogues, and wizards. Puzzle-solvers don’t mind combat encounters
because beating tactically challenging encounters (such as archers on a
castle wall) is solving puzzles of sorts.
 Hack-and-slashers: These are players who just love to fight and beat up
monsters. The bigger the fight, the happier they are. Hack-and-slashers
live for dishing out the damage, and they’re inclined to like the rules
because the game rules help them figure out how much damage they
can deal out. Hack-and-slashers often play fighters and wizards.
Obviously, they like adventures with plenty of monsters to fight, and
they don’t like adventures that involve too much talking.
 Competitors: These are those players who play for the thrill of winning
in whatever form it might take. They’re happy to fight big fights and win,
but unlike the hack-and-slasher, they’re just as happy to win by doing
roleplaying or solving tough puzzles. Competitors tend to be heavily
engaged with the rules, and they don’t like to throw out the rulebooks.
You can throw a variety of challenges at a competitor, and he or she is
happy. Competitors often play clerics, fighters, and wizards.
Now, here’s the tricky part: You probably have players of more than one type
in your game. One player may be an actor, another may be a hack-and-slasher,
and a third player may be a competitor. The best way to keep everybody
happy is to simply alternate the types of encounters to cater to your players’
various interests. Intersperse roleplaying encounters with combat encoun-
ters and challenge encounters, and you can make exciting adventures that
feel varied and fresh where everybody gets the game he or she wants at least
some of the time.

which players are happiest with them.

If you’re trying to keep everyone happy with the same adventure, try to
include some “good” or “great” situations for each player at your table.
You’ll find that hack-and-slashers are a little difficult to entertain; they tend to
be impatient and anxious to get to the next fight, and more than a few hack-
and-slashers like to look for ways to manufacture fights if none are at hand.
347
Chapter 25: Keeping Your Players Happy

This table makes hack-and-slashers look like the worst players, but that’s
somewhat misleading. If most of the players at the table enjoy a lot of combat
and view playing D&D as a way to let off steam by pretending to kill mon-
sters, well, who’s to say that’s not the right way for them to play the game?
Hack-and-slashers are often pretty knowledgeable about the rules and tend 
to run decisive and effective characters. Sure, they’re impatient to get to the
fun, but a hack-and-slasher at the table can go a long way toward keeping the
other players moving and motivated.
Narrating the Adventure
Knowing what your players like and catering to them is nothing more than
good marketing. But a crummy movie with great marketing is still a crummy
movie. What you need is some great writing and directing to get an entertain-
ment experience that will have the players on the edges of their seats. So what
can you do to run a game that’s fast-paced, exciting, emotionally charged, and
makes the players feel like they can slay dragons and challenge gods?
348
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

Getting ready, getting organized
It’s so simple we hesitate to mention it, but we will anyway: Be ready to run
your game. Read ahead on the adventure you’re running, visualize how
you’re going to set up the key encounters and decision points, and plan for
what you’re going to do when the players take a wrong turn. You shouldn’t 
be seeing an encounter for the first time when the players kick open the door
to Room 7 and storm inside.
The corollary to reading ahead is organizing your materials to run the game
efficiently and effectively. Nothing brings a game to a crashing halt like the
DM saying, “Uh, hang on guys, I gotta do some reading.” Pausing for a moment
to check your notes is one thing, but sticking your nose in the book to read
for 10 minutes means that your players are sitting around doing nothing but
watching you read. That ain’t great entertainment.
Good ways to be prepared include the following:
 Check the rules ahead of time: If you see that you’re likely to run an
encounter involving a whole gang of basilisks, refresh your memory on
how the gaze attacks work and read the monster description the night
before the game.
 Make notes in your adventure: Plan some actions or special moves for
your monsters and villains ahead of time. Think about things that NPCs
might say if the players wind up talking instead of fighting.
 Keep a folder: Organize your adventure notes and any records you’re
keeping (treasure the heroes find, NPCs they meet, and so on) so that
you can quickly find information when you need it during play.
Creating evocative scenes
Your players are immersed in an imaginary world of soaring beauty, awesome
magic, and horror beyond human endurance. It’s your job to get this across
with each scene you describe and every action your monsters and villains
take. You don’t have to stick three adjectives in front of every character or
object you describe in the game, but you don’t want to fall into the rut of
droning, “The minotaur swings. He misses. The minotaur swings again. Uh, 
he gets an 18. Does that hit you?” Put some zip into it!
Boring: “The room is 30 feet by 30 feet. There’s a door in the north wall,
and a stairway leading down. There’s an ogre in here.”
349
Chapter 25: Keeping Your Players Happy

Better: “The room smells dank and musty. It looks like an old cellar, with
thick cobwebs in the blackened rafters. A towering creature with long
arms and a crooked, fang-filled jaw glares at you, clutching a spiked club
in its knotted fists. Behind it you think you see a battered old door in the
north wall, and a set of stairs leading down into darkness.”
Boring: “The ogre charges and attacks. It rolls a 23. It hits you for 17
points of damage.”
Better: “The hulking monster throws back its head and howls in rage, and
then it throws itself at you! It brings its spiked club whistling down in a
deadly arc — that’s a 23 to hit. Unnh! A mighty blow sends you reeling.
You take 17 points of damage. ‘Ha! I SMASH!’ the creature bellows.”
Boring: “The hell hound breathes fire. You take 8 fire damage.”
Better: “The coal-black hound suddenly belches out a great blast of sear-
ing green flames. You take 8 points of fire damage.”
Using the cut-scene
One handy trick for DMing multiple tasks at the same time is the cut-scene.
Here’s the idea: Give one player and whatever task he’s involved in 5 to 10
minutes of your time, but then put that situation on hold and switch over to
350
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

work with another player on whatever she’s doing. It’s like a movie that hops
between a couple of different characters doing different things. It’s a great
tool for pacing because it lets you briefly “cliffhanger” a player in a challeng-
ing position (which builds suspense) while you involve another player who
otherwise wouldn’t be immediately involved in the scene (which keeps the
players out of the key action from getting bored).
Cut-scenes work best when the party is split up. If some characters are fight-
ing against assassins in a dark alleyway while other characters are trying to
help the elven ambassador make her escape, you can easily switch back and
forth between the two groups.
Cut-scenes also work on a smaller scale, when players are engaged in different
tasks in the same area. For example, say that the PCs are searching through 
an evil wizard’s laboratory. One might be searching for secret doors, another
might be looking through the mysterious old tomes on the bookshelf for any
interesting clues, and a third player might be talking to the wizard’s captive, a
human hero chained to the wall. You might start by DMing the player’s con-
versation with the captive hero. Then when you reach a good break in the
conversation, you switch over to tell another player what her rogue found
when she searched the room. Then you switch over to the player whose char-
acter was looking at the books. As the DM, you’re the director of the movie;
you decide which player you’re going to talk to, for how long, and where
you’re going to cut away to next.
Running a Fun Game
If you’re creating interesting adventures for your players and you’re doing a
good job of narrating and pacing the game, you’re ahead of the eight ball.
However, the game isn’t all about the adventures you write and your ability
to describe the action — you want to run a fun and entertaining game as
much as a well-crafted one.
Using props
One great way to take your players from listening to experiencing is to intro-
duce some props in your game. If the players defeat the sly rogue who’s been
carrying coded messages for the thieves’ guild, make up a set of cryptic coded
messages ahead of time, write them on a piece of paper, and crumple it up for
effect — and if you stain the paper with tea or coffee, you might even get it to
look a little like parchment. (If you don’t want to mess with staining paper, you
can find colored paper and parchment paper at any office supply store.) Not
only will the puzzle-solvers in your group have a great time unraveling your
code, but everyone else will like passing around a tangible object they can
peer at and study, just as their characters would.
351
Chapter 25: Keeping Your Players Happy

Old maps and secret messages are easy props to come up with. If you want to
go a step further, try handfuls of old coins (especially foreign currency), tarot
cards, books in foreign languages, and sketches or artwork. Anything that lets
your players visualize the scene or item you’re describing verbally is great.
Not every encounter or challenge deserves a prop or handout, but a few here
and there go a long way toward keeping your players interested and alert.
One prop you might not have thought of is a soundtrack. A little music played
softly in the background as you play the game can be very evocative. You
want to consider your music choice carefully, of course; the ideal piece is
something that’s orchestral, doesn’t have many words or singing for the DM
to compete with, and frankly just feels like it fits with the D&D game. Movie
soundtracks can be great for this, especially from fantasy or science fiction
movies — you could do worse than to play the soundtracks for the three The
Lord of the Rings movies, for example. Some companies actually produce
soundtracks specifically to serve as roleplaying background music.
Table rules
Every group of D&D players gradually evolves a set of table rules — conventions
for starting new characters, looking up rules on the fly, urging other players
to take specific actions, or simply whether to reroll or read as it lies when a
die is cocked or falls on the floor. These rules really don’t have much to do
with the D&D game, because your table rules might conceivably apply to any
number of other games you play with the same group of players. But it’s a
good idea to lay out your expectations on this sort of thing before an argu-
ment comes up about what is or isn’t allowed at the table.
Some things you ought to clarify ahead of time include the following:
 What to do when a player can’t make the game. (Specifically, is his or
her character present in the party or not, and who controls the charac-
ter if he or she is?)
 Which rulebooks and supplements you allow players to refer to in play.
(Many DMs prefer that players don’t look up monsters in a Monster
Manual while their characters are fighting the creature in question.)
 Whether or not you allow “take backs” if a player figures out that his or
her attack roll was really a 24 instead of a 21 after his or her action is
over.
If you’re a new DM running the game for an experienced group, you might
want to simply adopt the table rules of the previous DM until you feel com-
fortable with instituting your own. You can find a good discussion on table
rules on page 14 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.
352
Part IV: The Art of Dungeon Mastering 

Game balance
Keeping a game fun and interesting requires that you keep an eye on the bal-
ance of your game. Game balance basically comes down to these two aspects:
 Measure risk versus reward. This basically measures how dangerous
your dungeon is compared to the payoff in treasure, experience, and 
the fun your players get out of the game session. If your adventures just
cream party after party of PCs or if you can’t remember the last time you
got a PC down to half his or her hit points, your game might be out of
balance. It’s not fun to lose all the time — and believe it or not, it’s not
really fun to win all the time, either. A healthy game features a sprinkling
of setbacks and retreats that the players can learn from.
353
Chapter 25: Keeping Your Players Happy
How honest should you be?
You’re DMing a furious fight. James’ paladin
Baredd gets hit by the evil wizard’s lightning bolt
and gets knocked down to 2 hit points. Then the
wizard’s ogre henchman rolls a 20 against
Baredd and scores a critical hit with his great-
club. Baredd’s going to eat a lot of damage with
that attack. Do you let this lucky hit kill Baredd
outright? Or do you fudge the result and tell
James that Baredd got hit for 15 damage, keep-
ing the critical to yourself so that you don’t kill
James’ character? (Now, even so, Baredd’s at
–13 hit points, which means he’s unconscious
and dying.)
There isn’t an easy answer to this one. Some
DMs let the dice do their work, and they don’t cut
any breaks for the player characters or the bad
guys. Other DMs feel that a character death is a
pretty big occurrence, and it shouldn’t happen
“by mistake” — so, as long as the dice were
rolled behind the DM’s screen (an accessory that
a DM uses to keep notes and maps hidden from
the players) and no players observed the result,
it’s okay to fudge by announcing a miss or two
when a monster really would have hit.
Our recommendation for a beginning DM is to
avoid fudging and to let your players know you’re
going to let the dice fall where they may. If you
do decide to fudge the dice behind the screen,
don’t announce it to the players and don’t make
it obvious. You shouldn’t intercede to rescue
every character on the threshold of death,
because if your players realize that there’s no
chance for their characters to be killed, their
enjoyment of the game will be diminished — no
risk and no challenge means no suspense. And if
the players attempted something that was obvi-
ously highly risky (or simply stupid), you shouldn’t
protect them from the consequences of their
own poor decisions.
One more thing: Just because the DM may fudge
the rolls every now and then, we strongly advise
you not to try to do this as a player. When DMs
“cheat,” it’s usually for the effort of improving the
play experience of everyone at the table. If you
cheat by pretending you didn’t roll badly as a
player, you’re doing it to beat the game. It’s only
going to lead to a diminished experience for you
and may, in fact, cause a lot of trouble around the
table if you’re caught doing it. Most players can’t
abide a cheater, even one who’s on their side.

 Watch out for magic treasure that is useful only for one character.
If you put a +4 flaming keen bastard sword in your adventure, you have to
figure that the fighter in the party will claim this item. If the only other
choices in the monster hoard are a +2 ring of protection and a couple of
potions of healing, somebody in the party just scored ten times better
than everybody else. You can give unique and powerful treasures to
characters, but you can’t give those items to the same character every
game session.

Chapter 26
The Ten Best Fighter Powers
W
hat’s so complicated about fighter powers? Fighters hit the bad guys
with a big hunk of metal — usually sharp metal. When a fighter is
higher level, he or she hits harder. How is that confusing? 
Choosing the power offering the biggest damage potential at every level isn’t
a bad strategy. But we’re going to help you mix up offense, defense, control,
and versatility by pointing out powers that trade off damage for effects that
are even more useful. Sometimes doing a pile of damage to one monster is
exactly what you want, but other times you want to hit multiple foes or hit
one foe and add a nasty side effect like stun or daze to your attack.
The very sneaky and confusing things you do need to look out for are the
weapon keywords associated with fighter exploits. You can use any fighter
power with any weapon . . . but many powers simply work better with a spe-
cific weapon, and you’re missing out if you use the wrong weapon. We’re not
going to worry about weapon keywords in this list of ten best fighter powers,
but you should when you build your character’s list of favorite powers.
We excluded powers of 16th level or higher from this list on purpose. Naturally,
high-level exploits are better than low-level exploits; if we compiled a list of
fighter exploits strictly by power level, we’d use ten epic-level exploits. That’s
not so useful if you’re playing a low-level fighter and you’re trying to decide
which power you need right now. This is a list of ten fighter powers that will
help your character get off to a great start in his or her career, not the ten most
awesome fighter powers.
For a full description of each power (its effects, amount of damage dealt,
duration, and so on) listed here, see Chapter 4 of the Player’s Handbook.

10. Anvil of Doom
13th-level encounter attack power
One of the most powerful rider effects you can dish out in an attack is stun-
ning; when you stun a monster, you take away its next turn, and you also give
all your allies combat advantage (a +2 bonus to hit) against that monster
until it recovers. Anvil of doom is an encounter attack exploit that gives you
decent damage (double weapon dice) and stuns the target, if you’re using a
hammer or a mace. If you’re not, you just daze the target — but dazing is
pretty good, too. Either way, you aren’t going to be unhappy with dazing or
stunning an opponent once every encounter.
Oh, and it’s one of the two or three coolest power names in the game. Don’t
you want to say “I hit it with anvil of doom” every fight?
9. Reaping Strike
1st-level at-will attack power
At-will powers are relatively weak, but it’s important to choose the right ones.
In long battles, you can exhaust your encounter and daily powers, which
means you’re left with wearing down the enemy with powers that never run
out. Reaping strike is good because you deal a little bit of damage on a miss —
specifically, damage equal to your Strength modifier if you’re using a two-
handed weapon. Assuming your fighter has a Strength score of 18, that’s 4
points of damage, guaranteed. It might not seem like much, but if you’re fight-
ing a monster that’s extremely hard to hit, you might have to settle for “the
death of a thousand cuts” to complete the battle.
8. Precise Strike
3rd-level encounter attack power
Every so often, you’re going to come up against a monster or an enemy that
you just can’t hit. Its defenses are just too high. This might be because you’ve
run into a difficult encounter with enemies that are three or more levels
higher than you or because a boss monster might be wearing really good
armor. Either way, the precise strike power allows you to trade damage for
accuracy. 
358
Part V: The Part of Tens 

This power might deal only a single weapon die of damage plus your Strength
modifier, but it comes with an automatic +4 attack bonus to help you hit
when you really can’t afford to miss the target.
7. Serpent Dance Strike
15th-level daily attack power
Okay, so if it’s a 15th-level daily power, it had better be good. Fortunately, ser-
pent dance strike measures up. You attack a target, and if you hit, you deal
double weapon damage and knock the target prone. Then you can shift one
square, and do the same thing to a second target. Then, you can shift again
and do the same attack to a third target! Swing, step, swing, step, swing —
three monsters take good damage and wind up on the ground. Knocking ene-
mies prone is useful, because your allies gain combat advantage against them
until they stand up. If you have a rogue friend, this power is especially good.
(Granting combat advantage to a rogue really helps deal out the damage!)
The only downside is that you can only knock down targets who are your size
or smaller, so you can’t put trolls or giants or big demons on the pavement
with this power.
359
Chapter 26: The Ten Best Fighter Powers

6. Unbreakable
6th-level encounter utility power
This is one of those defensive powers we mentioned at the beginning of this
chapter. Once per encounter, reduce the damage you take from an attack by 
5 + your Constitution modifier. If your Constitution is, say, 16, that means –8
damage from an attack that just hit you. That might not seem terribly impres-
sive, but consider this: You’re the front line, and you’re going to get hit in
every single battle of your character’s life. We think the smart way to use a
power like this is to fire it off the first time you get hit in an encounter; after
all, you don’t know how many times you’re going to be hit in that fight, so
you might as well make sure you use it each encounter.
5. Sweeping Blow
3rd-level encounter attack power
Sweeping blow is a great power because it’s the first true area-effect attack
you can get as a fighter. It affects every enemy in a Close burst 1 — in other
words, every enemy adjacent to you. You can easily attack two or three ene-
mies in one action with this power. Better yet, you get a nice accuracy bonus
if you’re wielding the right weapon, and the list of weapons is generous.
Sweeping blow is less useful in encounters where you’re fighting a solo mon-
ster or monsters that are spread out over a good distance. However, we think
you’ll be able to use it to attack two enemies at once in 70 or 80 percent of
your encounters. The only question is picking the right moment. For this
power, you want to take advantage of its multiple-target effectiveness and wait
until you can catch two or three bad guys with it . . . but it’s better to use it
early to less effect than to wait for the perfect moment and never use it at all.
4. Dizzying Blow
5th-level daily attack power
Early in your fighter’s career, the damage differential between your powers is
pretty simple: Is it a 1[W], 2[W], or 3[W] power? (That means normal weapon
damage die, double weapon damage dice, or triple weapon damage dice.)
360
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Usually it’s better to accept a little less damage and deliver an attack with
superior accuracy, multiple targets, or a good rider of some kind, but dizzying
blow delivers on two of these counts at once: It’s a 3[W] power that immobi-
lizes the target. Immobilizing enemies makes your job as a defender easy; if
the monsters can’t reach your allies to attack them, you’re doing a good job
of defending them.
Dizzying blow is also interesting because it’s an example of a type of a
Reliable power. When you use a Reliable power, you don’t expend it if you
miss. There’s nothing quite as disheartening as using your character’s best
daily attack and then just missing on the attack roll. The fighter’s Reliable
powers at least offer some insurance — sooner or later, you’re going to hit
something with that power, and you can keep on trying until you do.
3. Come and Get It
7th-level encounter attack power
This power allows you to pull all enemies within range 3 up to two squares
(right next to you, in other words), and then you attack any enemies who end
up adjacent to you. Although it’s true that you get only 1[W] damage out of
this, the tactical value of getting enemies adjacent to you so that you can 
control their movement with opportunity attacks is simply huge for a fighter.
Remember, you’re the guy that the monsters really don’t want to be next to!
2. Comeback Strike
1st-level daily attack power
As a fighter, you occasionally take a pasting from the monsters. That’s not a
bad thing because you can take it better than any other character in the party,
but it does mean that you’re going to need healing on a frequent basis. Usually
you can count on your cleric or warlord friend to look out for you, but some-
times that ally won’t be there when you’re in desperate need, and you’ll have
to look out for yourself. Comeback strike is a great insurance policy for this
kind of situation because it combines a reasonable attack (double weapon
damage dice) with the opportunity to spend a healing surge — it combines
offense and defense in a single package. Plus, it’s a Reliable power, so if you
miss, you can try it again and again until you hit.
361
Chapter 26: The Ten Best Fighter Powers

1. Tide of Iron
1st-level at-will attack power
And the winner is . . . tide of iron!
This is an excellent at-will attack that does normal weapon damage, pushes the
target 1 square, and then gives you the opportunity to shift into the square you
shoved your enemy out of. There’s nothing like it for fighting your way through
a door or maneuvering an enemy away from an ally you want to protect. It’s
especially good if you have the feat Heavy Blade Opportunity or a magic item
that improves the effectiveness of pushes (for example, gauntlets of the ram).
Choosing a humble little at-will attack as the “best” fighter power may seem
odd, but here’s the deal: In most fights, you’re going to use your at-will
attacks more than any other attack. Your encounter attacks are better, of
course, but they’re good for only one swing each; an at-will attack might get
used two, three, or four times in the same battle. Picking the right at-will
attack is more important than you might think, and because of that, we rec-
ommend tide of iron as the best fighter power . . . unless of course you’re a
Great Weapon Fighter and don’t carry a shield, in which case reaping strike 
is the way to go!
362
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Chapter 27
The Ten Best Rogue Powers
D
on’t tell anybody, but rogues just might have the most fun of any char-
acter in the game. Many rogue powers are built to hit an enemy hard
and let you slip away without giving him the chance to counterattack, or
they’re built to just make the monsters look foolish. A rogue dishes out buck-
ets of damage, and with a little luck, the bad guys will never lay a finger on
your rogue.
The great majority of rogue powers require you to use a light blade, so that
means you have only three weapons to choose from: the dagger, the short-
sword, or (if you spend a Weapon Proficiency feat) the rapier. You should
also keep an eye out for powers that have “kickers” for your Rogue Tactics
class feature — you have to choose Artful Dodger or Brutal Scoundrel, and
even if you otherwise like to mix and match powers from the different rogue
builds, you get only one benefit or the other. We’re not going to distinguish
between these two options here, but more of the powers we list here are
associated with the Artful Dodger tactics. 
We left powers of 16th level or higher off this list, because we want to offer
pointers on good powers you’re likely to use earlier in your character’s
career. By the time you’re playing 16th- or 17th-level characters, there isn’t 
all that much more we can tell you about how to choose your powers!
For a full description of each power (its effects, amount of damage dealt, and
so on) listed in this chapter, see Chapter 4 of the Player’s Handbook.
10. Tornado Strike
13th-level encounter attack power
We start with an extremely versatile power, tornado strike. It works for both
your melee attack or your ranged attack, and it gives you the chance to
attack two different targets for double weapon damage dice against each one.
It also gives you the ability to move 3 squares when you’re all done attacking.
With some clever play, you can pop out of cover, use tornado strike, and then

duck back behind some useful obstacle (say, the party’s fighter) all in one
turn. Oh, and as an afterthought, you get to slide the target 2 or more
squares. Even though this power features a slight power-up for the Artful
Dodger, you really don’t need to choose that tactic to enjoy tornado strike;
you can shift your target at least 2 squares no matter what your Charisma
score is. For best effect, make sure you slide the targets you attack away 
from you so that you’re free to move without provoking opportunity attacks.
9. Sly Flourish
1st-level at-will attack power
This at-will power has the unusual distinction of being about the most dam-
aging at-will power any character can have — if your Charisma score is
respectable. Not only do you add your Dexterity modifier to your damage roll
with this Dexterity attack, but you also add your Charisma modifier. If your
rogue has a Charisma of 16, that’s +3 damage above and beyond any other 
at-will attack power. That might not seem like much, but if you’re a low-level
rogue, two sly flourish attacks dish out about three attacks’ worth of damage.
Don’t bother with sly flourish if your Charisma is less than a 14 or so; the
other at-will powers offer good benefits too, and you should take this only 
if it will give you a +2 or better bonus on your damage. 
8. Crimson Edge
9th-level daily attack power
Rogues have several daily powers that allow them to establish a significant
advantage against a chosen foe and keep it for a long time. In the case of crim-
son edge, you get a highly accurate attack that deals moderate damage up
front (double weapon damage dice), sets up good ongoing damage, and then
grants you combat advantage against the target until he successfully saves
against the ongoing damage. This sort of power is especially good when your
party is fighting a solo monster or a single tough elite . . . although monsters
like that normally succeed on their saving throws pretty quickly, so the on-
going damage and combat advantage won’t last all that long. 
Crimson edge is highly accurate because it’s a weapon attack against Fortitude
defense; normally, weapon attacks target Armor Class. Most monsters have
Fortitude defenses about 2 to 3 points lower than their Armor Class, so in
effect, this power grants you a nice bonus to hit. And, if you miss, it still deals
half damage.
364
Part V: The Part of Tens 

7. Leaping Dodge
16th-level encounter utility power
Okay, so we lied. We promised we’d keep this list to powers of 15th level or
lower, but leaping dodge is just one level too high, and it’s so spiffy we just
couldn’t help ourselves. Here’s the deal: This is a power you can use once per
encounter to interrupt an enemy’s attack and jump out of the way. You have
to be trained in the Athletics skill to use this power, but if some villain is
about to clobber you with a vicious melee attack, it’s easy as pie to just jump
back 1 square and make his attack automatically miss. If your skill check
totals 10 or better, you jump 1 square; 20 or better, 2 squares; 30 or better, 
3 squares. As a 16th-level rogue, your Athletics skill check should be some-
where around +15 or so, so you’re pretty much guaranteed of moving 1 square,
and you’ll get 2 squares most of the time. That will easily get you out of most
melee or close attacks. Choose the Long Jumper feat if you select this power,
and you’ll jump twice as far!
6. Cloud of Steel
7th-level encounter attack power
This power lets you shoot a whole roomful of enemies with your crossbow,
one bolt each. It doesn’t do a lot of damage, but we like it because in the right
encounter, you might pull off six or seven attacks with this one power. It’s a
Close attack, so it’s safe to use in melee, and you don’t even have to worry
about hitting friends in the area — it targets enemies only. You can also use
this power with thrown weapons such as shurikens or daggers, but you might
have to carry a lot of them, and you’ll need the Quick Draw feat to draw and
throw ’em all. If you want to drop a whole crowd of low-grade minion mon-
sters as easily as the party’s wizard, this is the power for you.
5. Blinding Barrage
1st-level daily attack power
Blinding barrage is actually a lot like cloud of steel. You get to riddle several
bad guys at once with your crossbow, thrown daggers, or sling. Better yet,
you deal double damage dice to each target you hit and blind them for a
round . . . and, if you miss, you still get half damage. So this power is more
damaging than cloud of steel, carries a nice rider effect, and gives you half
365
Chapter 27: The Ten Best Rogue Powers

damage even on a miss. You might wonder why it’s 6 levels lower, and here’s
why: This is a daily power, not an encounter power, and it affects a much
smaller blast. You probably won’t get more than two, maybe three, targets in
this power’s area, and you can use it only once per day.
4. Bait and Switch
3rd-level encounter attack power
Most of the 3rd-level rogue encounter powers give you solid damage (double
weapon dice, or 2[W]), but bait and switch offers a significant advantage over
the other powers of its level — it’s an attack against Will defense instead of
Armor Class. Your character is trying to deceive his or her foe and lure the
target into leaving a deadly opening for a blade. In mechanical terms, you’re
attacking a defense that is probably 2 or 3 points worse than AC, so you’re
that much more likely to score a hit. It’s a good idea to choose powers that
allow you to attack a variety of defenses, just because you never know
exactly what you’re going to be fighting. Bait and switch also offers you the
opportunity to move your enemy around the battlefield. It’s a great way to
get away from being surrounded by the bad guys or to get yourself next to a
strong friend like the fighter before the monsters counterattack.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

3. Tumble
2nd-level encounter utility power
This is a “money” power for the rogue. Tumble lets you shift up to half your
speed as a move action; usually this will be 3 squares, as compared with the
normal 1-square shift you can make without this power. You’ll use it in every
encounter of your character’s career, either to move into position for a sneak
attack or to get yourself out of trouble when the monsters surround you. No
other 2nd-level power comes close to the battle-after-battle usefulness of
tumble.
2. Slaying Strike
15th-level daily attack power
This power is fun because you get to dish out a truly staggering amount of
damage. It’s only a 3[W] (or triple weapon damage dice) power, with half
damage on a miss . . . which isn’t bad, really. But if you can wait until the
target you intend to attack is bloodied (down to half hit points or less), the
damage jumps up to 5[W], you score a critical hit on a roll of 17–20, and heck,
you even get a couple of extra points of damage by adding in your Strength
modifier. This is a power you want to make sure you hit with, so do anything
in your power to make sure you have combat advantage against the hapless
target before you pick up your d20. If you score a critical hit on a bloodied
monster, you can easily ring up a 60- or 70-point hit with slaying strike, and
that’s going to put down whatever monster you were fighting more often 
than not.
1. Piercing Strike
1st-level at-will attack power
So, why does a lowly 1st-level at-will attack win the big money here? The
answer is simple: piercing strike targets Reflex defense, not Armor Class. Most
monsters have Reflex defense 2 or 3 points worse than their AC, so this is 
the most accurate rogue at-will power. If you have combat advantage against
your enemy, you need to hit in order to make sure you deliver your sneak
attack damage, so that means piercing strike is the attack of choice for the
rogue’s classic backstab. Over the course of your career, something close to
half the attacks you make will be at-will attacks, so you might as well pick one
that’s going to hit.

Chapter 28
The Ten Best Wizard Powers
You might think that wizards are pretty weak characters. They can’t effec-
tively wear armor. They have relatively low hit points and defense scores.
What they do have is a great role — controller — designed to manipulate the
environment and deal damage to a lot of enemies at the same time. Armed with
arcane powers (called spells), wizards can dominate the battlefield. The trick 
is choosing the right spell for the job at hand. This chapter can help you with
that.
Choosing the right spells at every level depends on the type of wizard you want
to play. The Control Wizard, for example, concentrates on spells designed to
restrict enemies in some way, whereas the War Wizard looks for spells that deal
as much damage as possible.
We excluded powers of 16th level or higher from this list on purpose. Naturally,
high-level spells are better than low-level spells; if we compiled a list of wizard
spells strictly by power level, we’d pick ten epic-level powers and be done with
it. That’s not so useful if you’re playing a low-level wizard and you’re trying to
decide which power you need right now. This is a list of ten wizard powers that
will help your character get off to a great start in his or her career, not the ten
most awesome wizard powers.
For a full description of each power (its effects, amount of damage dealt,
duration, and so on) listed here, see Chapter 4 of the Player’s Handbook.
10. Magic Missile
1st-level at-will attack power
In addition to being a great fallback power because you can use it every
round, magic missile also counts as a ranged basic attack. That means that
whenever a situation allows you to make a basic attack, you can use this
arcane power instead of a dinky weapon.

9. Dispel Magic
6th-level daily utility power
Nothing says wizard like pulling out the exact right spell for the job and
totally changing the nature of the situation. All the wizard’s utility powers
accomplish this in some fashion, but when the party is up against an enemy
wizard, you want to be able to pull out dispel magic. This power allows you 
to eliminate the conjurations and zones cast by enemy wizards — and that
means you get to adjust the battlefield to be more in your favor. And that’s
just cool.
8. Ice Storm
9th-level daily attack power
The wizard really shines when he or she can cast a spell that covers a large
area of the battlefield, deals damage to the enemy, and also restricts the
enemy in some way. Ice storm is an example where the wizard’s role really
comes together.
Now, as a daily power, you’re going to want to save this spell for just the right
occasion. It’s a burst 3, which means it radiates out from its origin square to
cover a whole lot of the battlefield — three squares in every direction! And
you can place that origin square anywhere within 20 squares of your charac-
ter. For most battles, that means you can put it anywhere you need to. Not
only does it deal some damage to every enemy in the burst that you hit, it
deals half damage to them if you miss!
And then, when the damage dealing is over, the ice storm just keeps on giving.
Targets that were hit are immobilized until they save, and those you missed
are slowed until they save. Plus, the spell creates a zone of difficult terrain
that lasts until the end of the encounter. Use this power early in a fierce
battle, and the rest of the party will be talking about it long after the experi-
ence points and treasure are divvied up.
7. Mirror Image
10th-level daily utility power
Sometimes the wizard just has to worry about himself. After all, wizards are
fragile, and they won’t do their party any good if they get chewed up and
taken out of the fight early in an encounter. When it looks like the enemy is
370
Part V: The Part of Tens 

gunning for you, cast mirror image and most of your worries will go away 
(for a while, anyway). You create three duplicate images of yourself, which
essentially means that the next three attacks that target you miss you, 
eliminating one of your duplicates each time.
6. Sleep
1st-level daily attack power
Here’s another burst power that you can place anywhere within 20 squares of
your character. Warning: Sleep targets all creatures in the burst, so be sure
not to catch any of your allies with the spell! All targets, whether you hit or
miss them, are slowed until they make a saving throw. Those targets that
were hit, if they fail their first save, fall unconscious until they save against
that effect. Sleep can be pretty swingy, but when the dice fall your way, it can
put a whole lot of monsters out of action without killing them — and some-
times you want to leave a few monsters around to question when the battle
comes to an end.
5. Lightning Bolt
7th-level encounter attack power
Lightning bolt is one of those iconic wizard spells that also lives up to its clas-
sic billing. Basically, it allows you to hit a primary target and two secondary
targets with bolts of destructive lightning. The power has great range, deals
damage to multiple targets, lets you roll a lot of dice, and looks cool when it
is cast. What’s not to love?
4. Fireball
5th-level daily attack power
Another classic, fireball is great because of its simplicity. Pick a square within
20 squares of your character, and watch a burst of fire spread out for three
squares in all directions. Creatures in the burst are subject to an attack that
deals solid damage, and even hits them for half damage if your attacks miss.
Warning: Just be careful not to catch any of your allies in the burst, or they’ll
get crisped by this spell, too.
371
Chapter 28: The Ten Best Wizard Powers

3. Shield
2nd-level encounter utility power
Here’s another example of a power designed to save the wizard’s skin when
the monsters get past the fighter. When the wizard gets hit by an attack, he or
she can cast shield to immediately raise his or her AC and Reflex defense by
4. Not only does the bonus last until the end of your next turn (so it can pro-
tect you from more than one attack), but if your new defense score is higher
than the attack result, the original attack misses! Let’s see the fighter do that!
2. Thunderlance
13th-level encounter attack power
Here’s an example of a blast power that covers a 5 x 5 square area directly
adjacent to the wizard and targets all creatures in that area. Thunderlance is
an encounter power, so you can use it in every battle. Not only does it hit
hard, but it also pushes the targets four squares away from you — this spell
is great at clearing the area right around you from annoying monsters and
other enemies.
1. Cloud of Daggers
1st-level at-will attack power
Cloud of daggers makes it to the top spot for wizard spells because it’s an at-
will power that deals damage at the front end, creates an area that lasts until
the end of your next turn, and deals additional damage when a monster
enters or starts its turn in the cloud. That means that, at least, the creature
you originally target has the potential to take damage when you cast the
spell, and it automatically takes damage at the start of its turn. Wicked, huh?

The Ten Best Cleric Powers
C
lerics are leaders, which means they do things that help the rest of the
party and make the party better. The powers you select always provide
for these things, but you can lean a little more toward combat or a little more
toward party optimization, depending on the specific powers you choose.
The things to watch for in selecting cleric powers are the keywords. Some
cleric powers require the use of a weapon, whereas others require an 
implement — which is a holy symbol for clerics. Make sure to select powers
that play to your use of either a weapon or an implement, and everything will
work out fine.
We left powers of 16th level or higher off this list because we want to offer
pointers on good powers you’re likely to use earlier in your character’s
career. By the time you’re playing 16th- or 17th-level characters, there isn’t 
all that much more we can tell you about how to choose your powers!
For a full description of each power (its effects, amount of damage dealt, and
so on) listed in this chapter, see Chapter 4 of the Player’s Handbook.
10. Cure Light Wounds
2nd-level daily utility power
One of the main jobs the cleric accomplishes is keeping his or her party
healthy and alive through the use of healing magic. One of the first chances
you get to increase your healing portfolio is the cure light wounds utility
power. The great thing about this power is that it heals without the need for
your target to spend a healing surge — allowing the character to save the
surge for later in the adventure.

9. Lance of Faith
1st-level at-will attack power
This at-will power provides decent damage for a power that you can call
upon over and over, plus it provide one of your allies with a +2 bonus on the
next attack the ally makes against your target. Good damage and the poten-
tial for even more hurt coming your enemy’s way — just the thing to make
you feel all leaderly like.
8. Flame Strike
9th-level daily attack power
This power is the newest version of a cleric classic, and it delivers even better
now. With flame strike, you pick an origin square anywhere within 10 squares
of your character, and a burst 2 explodes from that spot to attack all enemies
within the burst. On a hit, each enemy takes a load of damage (especially if
your cleric has a good Wisdom score), as well as ongoing fire damage until it
succeeds at a saving throw. And even on a miss, the power deals half damage
to the monsters in the burst. That’s hot!
7. Cure Serious Wounds
6th-level daily utility power
An even better version of the cure light wounds prayer, this one lets your target
regain two healing surges worth of hit points without spending any healing
surges. This one is great to use when the fighter is still in the thick of a battle
but his or her hit points are running low.
6. Awe Strike
7th-level encounter attack power
For the Battle Cleric with a good Strength score and a weapon, awe strike is a
fun power to call upon in every battle. It doesn’t deal a lot of damage, but it
adds a bonus when it hits. It immobilizes your target until the end of your
next turn. That means the target can’t leave the square it’s in, leaving it 
vulnerable to the attacks of the rest of your party.
374
Part V: The Part of Tens 

5. Healing Strike
1st-level encounter attack power
Healing strike combines damaging a monster with healing for a unique mix of
action and helping one of your allies. When you successfully hit a monster,
roll solid damage while the ally you select spends a healing surge and regains
some hit points. In addition, the monster is marked until the end of your next
turn, meaning that it takes a penalty on any attacks it makes that don’t
include you as a target.
4. Daunting Light
3rd-level encounter attack power
This 3rd-level cleric encounter power provides the most damage of powers of
this level, plus it allows you to give an ally combat advantage against your
target. If you grant that benefit to a rogue, for example, then this monster is
in for a world of hurt.
3. Mantle of Glory
13th-level encounter attack power
Here’s another example of combining good damage against the enemy while
helping your allies at the same time. Mantle of glory is a blast 5 attack that
harms each enemy in the blast. But you also want to position this blast to
catch your allies as well, because each ally in the blast gets to spend a heal-
ing surge and recover some lost hit points. It’s really fun when the cleric can
hurt the monsters and help his or her allies with the same action.
2. Mass Cure Light Wounds
10th-level daily utility power
Like the earlier cure spells, you want to add this one to your repertoire
because it provides a free healing surge, which restores hit points equal to 
1⁄4 of the recipient’s normal maximum. Even better, this power is a burst,
allowing all your allies in the burst to take advantage of the healing — 
including yourself!
375
Chapter 29: The Ten Best Cleric Powers

1. Sacred Flame
1st-level at-will attack power
You never run out of uses of your at-will powers, so make sure you take the
ones you really want to use over and over again. We chose sacred flame as
the top cleric power because it combines the cleric’s two favorite activities —
hurting monsters and helping allies. In this case, it provides an ally with tem-
porary hit points. As a battle draws to a close but isn’t quite over yet, this
might be all the healing you have left to provide . . . but hit points are hit
points, and they can keep your fighter going strong for another round. And
that might make all the difference.

The Ten Best Low-Level Monsters
F
inish this sentence: “It isn’t a great D&D game until we’ve fought a
_________.” What’s your answer? A horde of orcs? A dragon? An 
evil wizard?
Although it’s true that big red dragons, mind flayers, and mummies are great
D&D monsters, you can’t really throw powerful monsters like that at a party
of 1st-level characters and expect them to survive. So, we split up this Top
Monsters list by tiers of play — heroic tier (levels 1–10) are covered in this
chapter, and paragon tier (levels 11–20) and epic tier (levels 21–30) monsters
are covered in the following chapters.
We made an effort to spread out our picks among creatures of different types
and different roles. (A creature’s level tells you what level of characters a
group of monsters of that type is a suitable challenge for; for example, four
2nd-level monsters are a good challenge for a party of four 2nd-level charac-
ters.) Every monster also includes its level and role so that a brand-new
Dungeon Master can decide whether the players are ready for them.
10. Stirge (Level 1 Lurker)
Monster Manual page 248
What’s creepier than a giant mosquito that can suck a person dry? A whole
flock of giant mosquitoes, that’s what. Stirges are fun because they introduce
players to the power of some monsters to grab hold and deal ongoing damage
until the target escapes. They also fly, and as lurkers, they love to leap out
and surprise characters with their blood-sucking ways. Yes, they’re individu-
ally weak, but there’s nothing quite as horrifying for characters (and their
players) as watching one of their comrades thrashing about with two or three
stirges attached at the same time.

9. Hell Hound (Level 7 Brute)
Monster Manual page 160
Hell hounds make it onto the list because they’re representatives of a class of
monsters your players will be fighting against for their whole careers: elemen-
tal beasts. They’re from other planes of existence (the Elemental Chaos, in the
case of the hell hound) and are, therefore, from “outside” the normal world.
Hell hounds are also interesting because they have an area-effect attack (their
fiery breath) and the ability to deal extra fire damage with every bite. They
also have a fiery aura that deals damage to any creatures that enter or begin
their turns within its area of effect.
8. Young White Dragon 
(Level 3 Solo Brute)
Monster Manual page 84
We had to include a dragon, didn’t we? It’s in the name of the darned game,
after all. This white dragon is a solo monster, meaning that it can take on a
group of 3rd-level player characters all by itself. It has a load of hit points, the
ability to attack multiple times in a round, and an icy breath weapon that can
bring down a number of PCs at the same time. Add to that the fact that it can
use action points to take extra actions on its turn, and you have a truly terri-
fying battle against a Large monster for low-level characters.
7. Deathjump Spider 
(Level 4 Skirmisher)
Monster Manual page 246
A surprising number of low-level D&D monsters are big bugs. Monstrous spi-
ders are the scariest representatives of this crew, thanks to J.R.R. Tolkien.
Who isn’t creeped out by the notion of a spider the size of a person? The
deathjump spider is good because it has a great power with a great name:
death from above. It can leap as many as 10 squares and then shift up another
6 squares to deliver a potent bite that deals ongoing poison damage and
knocks it target prone. Now that’s creepy!
378
Part V: The Part of Tens 

6. Werewolf (Level 8 Brute)
Monster Manual page 180
The werewolf is a classic monster. Everybody understands the fear of letting
out the beast within, the feral killer deep inside. Not only is the werewolf an
iconic legendary monster, it’s also interesting in the context of the D&D rules.
It’s the best illustration of a monster with regeneration; unless characters
have a silver weapon, they’ll have a hard time keeping this creature from
healing damage. Werewolves are shapechangers, which means players can
never be entirely sure whether that surly villager might indeed be the great
black wolf who attacked their characters out in the forest. And best of all,
werewolves carry the dreaded disease of moon frenzy; those heroes bitten 
by werewolves are driven mad and become crazed killers (but don’t actually
change into werewolves themselves).
5. Ghoul (Level 5 Soldier)
Monster Manual page 118
Ghouls are undead creatures that haunt graveyards and crypts and feast on
the dead . . . or, whenever they’re handy, the living. Ghouls are terrifying to
low-level heroes because one scratch of a ghoul’s filthy claws may cause even
the most resolute of heroes to freeze up in complete (but thankfully short-
lived) immobilization. Fighting off a pack of ghouls requires the heroes to
cooperate to defend friends who are temporarily unable to move. And just
like the werewolf, the ghoul’s bite carries with it a supernatural effect — in
this case, an effect that stuns its target.
4. Dire Rat (Level 1 Brute)
Monster Manual page 219
Dire animals are unusually large, powerful, and foul-tempered versions of the
normal creatures you’re familiar with. Dire rats are the weakest and most
common of these vicious animals. A dire rat can be six feet long and weigh
more than 150 pounds. Dire rats are one of those classic bits of “dungeon
dressing” that just seem to turn up any time you have a refuse pit, trash
heap, or sewer to explore. And they can be pretty tough opponents for 
low-level heroes.
379
Chapter 30: The Ten Best Low-Level Monsters

3. Ogre Skirmisher (Level 8 Skirmisher)
Monster Manual page 199
An ogre skirmisher can deliver quite a beating to a low-level party. An ogre
skirmisher uses reach to pound a target up to 2 squares away for 1d8+4
damage each time it hits with that big club, and if it moves 4 squares before
attacking it gains a skirmish bonus of +1d8 — an average of 14 points per hit!
One swing is usually enough to bloody many 1st-level characters. An ogre
skirmisher teaches players about fighting big, powerful, stupid, and mobile
monsters, which is an iconic D&D experience. An ogre skirmisher encounter
just screams out for clever player tactics such as stealth, bluffing, or the use
of magic; if characters just go right at the ogre skirmisher and try to beat it at
its own game of melee damage, they’re going to get hurt.
2. Blazing Skeleton (Level 5 Artillery)
Monster Manual page 234
Thanks to Ray Harryhausen, everybody knows just what fighting skeletons
ought to look like. What’s scarier and more fantastic than battling against
silent, remorseless things made from the fleshless bodies of the dead? Like
the ghoul, the skeleton introduces players to the special advantages and
weaknesses of undead monsters; they’re resistant to fire and necrotic attacks,
but they’re vulnerable to radiant damage. Blazing skeletons are surrounded 
by a fiery aura that deals fire damage to creatures that start their turns in the
aura, their claw attacks deal ongoing fire damage, and they have a ranged
attack in the form of a flame orb that allows them to battle the player charac-
ters from a distance.
1. Orc Raider (Level 3 Skirmisher)
Monster Manual page 203
And the best low-level monster is . . . the orc! The iconic beast-man savage,
the barbaric marauder, bloodthirsty warrior in the service of stronger and
darker evils, the orc is simply the classic adversary for a low-level hero.
380
Part V: The Part of Tens 

To be honest, orcs are actually the top pick because they’re the perfect repre-
sentatives of a broad group of creatures known as humanoids. Monsters like
goblins, hobgoblins, kobolds, gnolls, and even lizardfolk all provide a very
similar sort of encounter — the party fights a handful of savage warriors at 
a time. They use armor and weapons just like PCs do and may have champi-
ons or leaders who have character classes and use magic like PCs. Some are
stronger, some are sneakier, some are halfling-sized, and some are human-
sized, but essentially it’s the same type of encounter regardless of the exact
monster involved.
Although orcs are often thought of as low-level opponents, you should remem-
ber that orcs can have classes and levels, too. The run-of-the-mill orc raider is a
3rd-level skirmisher, but imagine running into an elite orc warband made up of
7th-level bloodragers, or an orc battle-priest who’s a 5th-level eye of Gruumsh.
A great orc chieftain and his chief bodyguards and advisors may be every bit
as tough as the best party of heroic-tier adventurers.

The Ten Best Mid-Level Monsters
N
ow for the second part of our Top Monsters list, the ten best monsters
for paragon-tier play (levels 11–20). A creature’s level is roughly equal
to character level; for example, four level 12 monsters are a good challenge
for a party of four 12th-level characters.
These creatures are the most suitable for a paragon-tier game. As in Chapter
30, we’ve tried to spread out our picks among creatures of different types 
and different levels and roles. If you’re a Dungeon Master, you can decide for
yourself whether your players are ready to face these sinister creatures.
10. Cyclops Impaler (Level 14 Artillery)
Monster Manual page 46
Cyclopses are one-eyed giants from the Feywild that often serve more power-
ful masters. The impaler has all kinds of ranged powers that make it a great
monster to put at the back of a band of other, more melee-oriented creatures.
While the melee monsters pound on the adventurers, the cyclops impalers
hurl spears and use their evil eye and impaling volley powers to harass the
heroes from a distance.
9. Flesh Golem (Level 12 Elite Brute)
Monster Manual page 142
Golems are magical constructs, creatures of nonliving matter given animation
through powerful spells and rites. The flesh golem is the most common 
example of this monster. It’s made from bits and pieces of bodies, just like
Frankenstein’s monster, but the flesh golem is an unthinking machine. As a
construct, a golem is powerful and unthinking, ready to fly into a golem 
rampage in an instant, moving across the battlefield and attacking every 
creature it encounters along the way. As an elite monster, one flesh golem is
equal to two standard monsters of its level.

8. Wailing Ghost (Level 12 Controller)
Monster Manual page 117
The wailing ghost, or banshee, is the perfect example of an insubstantial
monster — a creature that simply doesn’t have real substance in the world,
and thus can move through walls, doors, and other obstacles. Dealing with an
insubstantial monster requires players to evolve special tactics and employ
specific spells and weapons to deal full damage. Otherwise, every attack
deals half damage to these terrifying undead creatures.
7. Umber Hulk (Level 12 Elite Soldier)
Monster Manual page 256
Here’s one of our favorites. The umber hulk is an iconic DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
monster — it’s a creature invented specifically for the game, something that
doesn’t really stem from real-world myth or legend. Umber hulks are fun
because they are Large monsters that use a confusing gaze attack. Just like
the wailing ghost teaches players to deal with insubstantial monsters, the
umber hulk teaches players a set of rules and tactics to overcome a monster
that is dangerous even to look at.
6. Beholder Eye of Flame 
(Level 13 Elite Artillery)
Monster Manual page 32
Speaking of iconic creatures, here’s the beholder! What could be more fantas-
tic than a giant floating eyeball with little eye stalks sticking out, all of which
shoot magic rays?
The eye of flame’s eye rays can damage hapless PCs with fire, slide them up
to 4 squares, or make them flee in terror. Oh, and with its big central eye the
beholder can render its victims even more vulnerable to fire attacks. Its 
ability to inflict a devastating onslaught of attacks on the party of heroes is
unparalleled . . . until they fight a beholder eye tyrant (Level 19 Solo Artillery)
later in their adventuring careers, that is.
384
Part V: The Part of Tens 

5. Mummy Lord (Level 13 
Elite Controller)
Monster Manual page 192
The mummy lord is an undead cleric who’s an elite monster complete with 
a fear aura, regeneration, melee attacks, ranged attacks, and a Close burst
attack. This truly powerful creature can spread the dreaded disease of
mummy rot to those it battles, leaving them with something to remember
well after the combat encounter has ended.
4. Mind Flayer Mastermind 
(Level 18 Elite Controller)
Monster Manual page 188
Another unique creation of the D&D game, the mind flayer is the quintessential
evil genius . . . with the ability to daze and immobilize PCs into helpless paste
with its mind blast and illusion of pain powers and then pull out their brains
and eat them while the PCs are standing around helplessly watching it happen.
If there’s a more horrible way to die in the D&D game than that, we frankly
don’t know what it is. Although a mind flayer is tremendously dangerous on its
own, the real threat posed by the monster is its ability to mastermind and com-
mand other monsters. A mind flayer is the perfect evil overlord, and it’s clever
enough to use its servant monsters to wear down a group of paragon-tier
adventurers before setting a lethal ambush to finish them off itself.
3. Vrock Demon (Level 13 Skirmisher)
Monster Manual page 58
Demons and devils of all sorts are some of the coolest and most powerful
monsters in the D&D game. There are four or five that we could have picked
to represent the evil-outsider-from-the-infernal-realms niche, but we settled
on the vrock as the best example. The vrock is a dangerous melee combatant,
but (like many demons or devils) it also possesses several dangerous special
attacks. Many heroes find that they battle demons, devils, and such things
over and over again as they rise to high-level play, and the vrock is a great
representative of the type.

Chapter 31: The Ten Best Mid-Level Monsters

2. War Troll (Level 14 Soldier)
Monster Manual page 254
We simply couldn’t exclude the troll from one of these lists. A war troll is a
great paragon-tier monster that can challenge heroes for a number of levels.
Just like the wailing ghost is a great example of an insubstantial monster, the
war troll is a great example of a regenerating monster — a creature that’s
almost impossible to kill outright unless you have fire handy.
The war troll is quite common because it makes a great meat shield (a dull-
witted but physically strong creature that can stand in between the heroes
and the evil mastermind). Before the party can get at the evil wizard, mind
flayer, or what-have-you, they adventurers have to cut their way through a
gang of war trolls. A war troll fits well in almost any scenario or monster lair,
and it’s vile, repulsive, and loathsome. Every player loves to hate trolls, and
you know what? The war troll deserves it.
386
Part V: The Part of Tens 

1. Adult Red Dragon (Level 15 
Solo Soldier)
Monster Manual page 83
The opportunity to fight a dragon (and pillage its hoard) is the reason you
play the game.
A dragon’s power varies depending on its color (species) and its age category.
The older a dragon gets, the bigger and meaner it gets. An adult dragon is a
handful for almost any paragon-tier party; we chose the red dragon because
it’s iconic and a good fit for the paragon-tier of play.
A dragon is armed with a number of dangerous and useful abilities — it flies,
it has a great AC and a lot of hit points, it has tremendously good saving
throws and the use of action points, it has a deadly breath weapon (fire, 
in the case of a red dragon), and it can tear you to shreds with its claws 
and teeth. What more could a group of brave adventurers want?

Chapter 32
The Ten Best High-Level Monsters
N
ow for the third part of our Top Monsters list, the ten best monsters for
epic-tier play (levels 21–30). A creature’s level tells you what level of
characters an equal number of monsters of that type is a suitable challenge
for; for example, four level 24 monsters are a good challenge for a party 
of four 24th-level characters.
These creatures are the most suitable for a epic-tier game. As before, we’ve
tried to spread out our picks among creatures of different types and different
levels and roles. If you’re a Dungeon Master, you can decide for yourself
whether your players are ready to face these sinister creatures.
10. Yuan-ti Anathema (Level 21 
Elite Skirmisher)
Monster Manual page 271
Yuan-ti are classic D&D monsters — half-snake, half-humanoids who con-
stantly plot to rebuild their ancient empire. The anathema is a Huge-sized
monster that is more snake than human; in fact, it appears to be made of
dozens of giant snakes twisted together into an insane abomination that is
often unleashed to wreck havoc on the world. Take a look at the picture we
included in the color pages of this book!
9. War Devil (Level 22 Brute)
Monster Manual page 67
The war devil is a champion of the Nine Hells. They often lead lesser devils
into battle or serve as generals for mortal tyrants of the most foul and power-
ful kind. The war devil has a mix of melee and devilish powers that make it a
formidable opponent in the opening stages of epic play.

8. Voidsoul Specter (Level 23 Lurker)
Monster Manual page 244
This epic-tier threat appears as a ghostly, twisted apparition surrounded by
an aura of spectral cold that deals damage and reduces defenses. In addition
to a deadly melee attack, the voidsoul specter has a Close blast attack that
pours on the damage while healing the monster. Nothing says danger like a
pack of voidsoul specters emerging from the shadows to take on your epic-
level adventurers.
7. Elder Purple Worm (Level 24 
Solo Soldier)
Monster Manual page 214
Here’s a classic D&D favorite. The elder purple worm is a real beater of a
monster, just the thing to throw at a party of confident and fearless (maybe
too fearless) adventurers in the low- to mid-epic tier. It’s Gargantuan-sized. It
has 1,145 hit points. It has the ability to swallow its prey whole. This is truly 
a monster to be reckoned with!
6. Death Knight (Level 25 Elite Soldier)
Monster Manual page 51
The death knight originally appeared in the early days of D&D as an evil answer
to the heroic paladin, and it still fills that bill in the current version of the game.
With a powerful soul weapon, the ability to issue divine challenges, and an aura
that provides a benefit to undead allies, the death knight makes a great leader
for a band of assorted undead creatures.
5. Pit Fiend (Level 26 Elite Soldier)
Monster Manual page 65
The pit fiend works best as the leader of a group of lesser devils actively seek-
ing to end the adventuring career of the player characters. It has a deadly
combination of melee attacks (including a flametouched mace and a tail sting)
390
Part V: The Part of Tens 

and ranged attacks (such as point of terror and irresistible command), as well
as the ability to summon additional devilish allies whenever it needs them. 
4. Storm Giant (Level 24 
Elite Controller)
Monster Manual page 124
Giants begin to enter play during the paragon-tier, but they really come into
their own at epic levels. The storm giant is at the top of the giant world, at
least as far as the Monster Manual is concerned, hurling thunderbolts from
afar, using howling winds to scatter enemies, and fighting with a lightning-
edged greatsword when the battle gets up close and personal. 
3. Ancient Blue Dragon 
(Level 28 Solo Artillery)
Monster Manual page 79
Ancient dragons are the most powerful versions of these majestic and deadly
creatures, and the ancient blue dragon approaches the pinnacle of all dragon-
kind. (Only the ancient red surpasses it.) As a solo monster, you can throw an
ancient blue dragon at your player characters as early as level 26, and it still
presents a challenge when they reach 30th level. Few single challengers can
long stand against the fury of this terrible dragon as it unleashes lightning
and thunder.
2. Tarrasque (Level 30 Solo Brute)
Monster Manual page 13
Few D&D monsters have inspired the stories of the dreaded tarrasque, a 
creature that embodies wanton destruction. Of a size that makes most other
monsters look small, and with powers that will test the courage and abilities
of even the toughest heroes, this abomination can easily serve as one of the
final challenges for your adventurers as your long campaign comes to a 
brilliant and satisfying close.
391
Chapter 32: The Ten Best High-Level Monsters

1. Orcus (Level 33 Solo Brute)
Monster Manual page 206
The most powerful, most deadly, highest-level monster in the Monster Manual
is Orcus, the demon prince of the undead. This demon lord is impressive,
from its Gargantuan size to its twin auras, from its amazing Armor Class (48!)
to its spectacular number of hit points (1,525!). Orcus has long been a player
in the mythology of the D&D world, and in the 4th Edition of the game, the
demon lord takes center stage. With a heavy mace known as the Wand of
Orcus and all kinds of death-related powers and abilities, Orcus represents
the most monstrous evil in the game — the perfect challenge for 30th-level
epic heroes!

The Ten Best D&D Novels
A
s much fun as the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is to play, you can’t spend
all of your time adventuring in the dungeons. That doesn’t mean you
still can’t get your fill of D&D when you’re away from the gaming table.
In this chapter, we look at one of the best out-of-game activities you can par-
ticipate in while still staying in the spirit of D&D — reading D&D-based fan-
tasy novels. Wizards of the Coast publishes a vast array of novels set in the
various worlds of D&D, and we introduce you to some of the best out there 
in this chapter. In addition, we suggest some other fantasy novels that, while
not specifically related to D&D, are definitely in the spirit of the game and can
inspire players and Dungeon Masters alike in future game sessions.
Dragonlance Chronicles
By Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
This is the trilogy that launched the D&D novels lines, and it holds up today
as an epic adventure revolving around a group of adventuring companions
not unlike the characters you and your friends play in any D&D game. The
epic struggle of the War of the Lance unfolds through Dragons of Autumn
Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, and Dragons of Spring Dawning. Many of 
the characters and situations introduced in these volumes spin off into new
adventures throughout the line of DRAGONLANCE novels.
Dragonlance Legends
By Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
This sequel to Chronicles, Legends explores events in the lives of two popular
characters — Raistlin and Caramon. Follow Caramon through time as he
struggles to save his brother from a terrible darkness in Time of the Twins,
War of the Twins, and Test of the Twins.

Icewind Dale Trilogy
By R.A. Salvatore (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
In this thrilling adventure set in the far northern reaches of the FORGOTTEN
REALMS setting, you first meet the popular dark elf hero Drizzt Do’urden and
his companions. With The Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, and The Halfling’s
Gem, a powerful tale unfolds and sets the stage for the future adventures of
the drow ranger and his friends.
R.A. Salvatore’s War of the Spider Queen
By various authors (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
This epic story evolves across five books as civil war and chaos rocks the
Underdark. As the most powerful dark elf houses clash in this tale set in 
the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign’s shadow regions, four heroes seek to 
save the underworld realm of Menzoberranzan from a terrible, approaching
darkness. This series consists of these titles: Dissolution, Insurrection,
Condemnation, Extinction, and Annihilation.
A Practical Guide to Dragons
By Lisa Trutkoff Trumbauer (published by Mirrorstone, Wizards of the 
Coast, Inc.)
This beautiful book about dragons is a great introduction to the world of D&D
for new and younger readers. Extremely popular, the Practical Guide has led
to a series of related titles, including A Practical Guide to Monsters and the
Dragon Codex series of young adult novels set in a D&D world.
Storm Dragon
By James Wyatt (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
Set in the world of EBERRON, Storm Dragon brings together the ancient shards
of the Prophecy of the Dragons to shake the foundation of the campaign. This
novel is a great read and a good introduction to the world of EBERRON.
394
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Swordmage
By Richard Baker (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
This is the first FORGOTTEN REALMS novel set in the new 4th Edition timeline.
Swordmage follows the adventures of an exiled swordmage who confronts the
sinister plots of a traitor, the fury of an orc warlord, and the ancient malice of
an undead king.
The Orc King
By R.A. Salvatore (published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc.)
In the latest adventures of Drizzt Do’urden, hero of the far northern reaches
of the FORGOTTEN REALMS world, the dark elf takes a stand to stop the orc tribes
from marching to all-out war. This is the beginning of a bold new trilogy that
will change the face of Faerûn forever.

Chapter 33: The Ten Best D&D Novels
Novels to inspire
A lot of great fantasy novels have been pub-
lished. We talk about some of our favorite
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS novels in this chapter, and
we decided that we should also include a list of
past and present non-D&D novels that continue
to inspire us and broaden our imaginations. They
might not be official D&D novels, but they cer-
tainly possess the same spirit, and many of these
books inspired our earliest attempts at story and
adventure creation. This list is by no means com-
plete or exhaustive. Consider it as a starting point
for your own discovery of novels to inspire you
and fuel your imagination:
10. Furies of Calderon (first in the Codex Alera
series) by Jim Butcher
9. Conan the Barbariannovels and short stories
by Robert E. Howard
8. The Elric Saga series by Michael Moorcock
7. The Adventures of Fafhrd and the Gray

Drannor, written by the creator of Faerûn! Can they step forth one last time 
to save Cormyr and forge their legend forever?

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Glossary
aberrant: A monster origin, which includes creatures such as the aboleth or
mind flayer.
ability: One of the six basic physical and mental attributes of a character or
creature: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
Each ability is given a numerical value — usually between 3 and 18 for an
average human, although heroic humans have much better scores. Monsters
have ability scores, too, and sometimes they can be high above (or way
below) the human average.
ability check: A test or check in which you roll 1d20, add half your charac-
ter’s level, and then add the ability modifier for the appropriate ability to the
resulting roll. Most things your character attempts in the game, including
skill checks and attack rolls, are founded on the ability check mechanic. 
ability modifier: The bonus or penalty your character gets for having a good
or poor ability score. Modifiers are applied to ability checks, ability-based
skill checks, and basic melee attack and damage rolls.
action: What characters can do on their turn in combat. A character can take
one minor action, one move action, and one standard action on his or her
turn. See also action, minor; action, move; and action, standard.
action, minor: A minor action is usually an action that isn’t an attack or move
but enables you to do something else, such as drawing a weapon or opening
a door. 
action, move: Moving up to your character’s speed is a move action. Move
actions also cover a number of movement-related activities, such as standing
up after being knocked prone or shifting. See also shift.
action, standard: Most attacks your character can make require standard
actions, such as attacking with a power, charging, or making a basic melee
attack.
action point: A special resource that player characters (and some monsters)
can spend to gain a bonus standard action for that turn. You begin each day
of adventuring with one action point, but as you successfully overcome
obstacles and defeat monsters, you may gain more. 
aid another: A combat action that lets you grant another character a +2
attack or defense bonus instead of making an attack of your own.

398
Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition For Dummies 
alignment: A basic description of the morality of an intelligent creature. 
See also good, lawful good, evil, chaotic evil, and unaligned.
arcane: One of the power sources from which characters derive their abilities.
Warlocks and wizards make use of the arcane power source. Arcane powers
are commonly called spells.
area attack: A type of long-range attack in which the attacker blasts every-
thing in the specified area. A fireball spell is an area attack.
Armor Class (AC): A number representing a creature’s ability to avoid being
hit in combat. An opponent’s attack roll must equal or exceed the target’s AC
to hit it. Armor Class starts at 10 and is then modified for a character’s level,
Dexterity or Intelligence, armor worn, and magical protections.
astral diamond (ad): A unit of currency. Astral diamonds are fantastically
valuable; each one is worth 10,000 gold pieces.
attack roll: A roll to determine whether an attack hits. To make an attack roll,
roll 1d20 and add your character’s level modifier, ability score modifier
(depending on which ability score the attack is based on), plus any special
modifiers that might apply, such as the enhancement bonus of a magic weapon
or implement. If the result equals or beats the target’s defense, your attack hits.
at-will power: A power that can be used every turn.
basic attack: A melee or ranged weapon attack you make without using a
power. Usually, you use basic attacks for opportunity attacks or when
another character grants you an attack on his or her turn.
beast: A monster type that includes non-intelligent creatures such as lions,
tigers, and bears. Beasts also can come from more exotic origins.
bloodied: When a character or creature is reduced to half or less of the normal
full hit point total. (Some abilities work better when used by or against blood-
ied characters or monsters.)
buff: To use a power that makes your character or allies stronger or better,
such as a power that heals or gives a bonus to AC. 
bull rush: A combat action in which your character tries to shove an opponent
out of the way or into a specific position. 
cast a spell: To use an arcane power. Using an arcane power isn’t really differ-
ent from using any other kind of power, but there’s a long tradition in the
game of spellcasters and casting spells.

caster: Table-talk for a character or creature that has the ability to use a
supernatural power, especially if that power is arcane or divine in nature 
and isn’t a melee attack. Devoted clerics, warlocks, and wizards are usually
considered casters.
chaotic evil: An alignment. Chaotic evil creatures believe that it’s okay to kill,
rob, or plunder any creature weaker than themselves.
character: A fictional individual in the game setting, created and controlled
by a player or DM. See also player character (PC) and nonplayer character
(NPC).
character class: One of the eight player character types or careers described
in the Player’s Handbook: cleric, fighter, paladin, ranger, rogue, warlock, 
warlord, and wizard. Class defines a character’s talents and basic function in
the game.
charge: A combat action in which a character moves up to his or her speed
and makes a basic melee attack at the end with a +1 attack bonus. You usu-
ally can’t use any powers when you charge.
check: A method of determining whether your character succeeds or fails
when attempting an action. Most checks are ability checks. To make a check,
roll 1d20 and add any relevant modifiers (usually, your level modifier and
ability modifier). If this result equals or exceeds the Difficulty Class number
assigned by the DM, the check succeeds.
class: See character class.
class feature: Any special ability, power, or characteristic derived from having
levels in a character class.
class skill: A skill to which characters of a particular class have easier access
than characters of other classes.
cleric: A player character class. Clerics are divine leaders. They are holy cru-
saders who combine potent healing abilities with powers that make enemies
easier for other characters to hit or powers that protect other characters
from harm.
Close attack: A type of short-range attack in which the attacker blasts every-
thing in the specified area. For example, a Close burst 2 is an attack that
affects every target within 2 squares of the attacker.
combat advantage: A situation in which the attacker can catch a defender
off-guard. When you have combat advantage against a foe, you gain a +2
bonus on any attack you make. Conditions that cause combat advantage
include being dazed, flanked, prone, or stunned.
399
Glossary

concealment: An obscurity that prevents a character from clearly seeing a
target. Concealment penalizes attacks against the concealed creature.
condition: A specific effect that’s currently affecting a creature. Common con-
ditions include blinded, dazed, dying, immobilized, marked, slowed, stunned,
and weakened.
construct: A monster type which includes things that were built and animated
through magic, such as flesh golems or shield guardians. Constructs are
immune to some attacks and effects.
controller: A character role. Controllers are characters who favor offense over
defense and have powers that can damage or hinder multiple enemies at once.
copper piece (cp): A unit of currency in the game. Copper pieces are worth
1/100 of a gold piece.
coup de grace: A combat action that allows your character to attempt a
killing blow against a helpless opponent. (Coup de grace is French for “stroke
of mercy.”) If your attack hits, you automatically score a critical hit with
whatever power you were using.
cover: Any solid barrier between an attacker and defender. Cover inflicts a
penalty on the attacker’s attack roll.
creature: A living or otherwise active being. The terms creature, monster, and
character are sometimes used interchangeably.
crit: Table talk for a critical hit (or, as a verb, the act of clobbering someone
or something with a critical hit). For example, “Did you just crit that orc?”
critical hit: A hit that strikes a vital area. To score a critical hit, you must roll
a natural 20 on an attack roll. Crits usually deal maximum damage plus bonus
dice based on the weapon or implement you’re using.
daily power: A significant power that can be used once per day. You regain
daily powers after an extended rest.
damage: A decrease in hit points. The exact type of damage is often specified
(such as fire damage) so that you can determine whether the target has any
special resistances or immunities that may decrease or negate the damage
(such as resistance to fire). 
darkvision: The ability to see in total darkness (handy if no light source is
nearby!).
400
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies, 4th Edition 

defender: A character role. Defenders have high hit points and good defenses
(naturally), and they specialize in melee combat. They usually have abilities
that discourage monsters from attacking softer targets in the party, such as
controllers or leaders.
difficulty class (DC): The target number that you must meet or beat with a
skill check or saving throw roll to succeed.
divine: One of the power sources from which characters derive their abilities.
Clerics and paladins make use of the divine power source. Divine powers are
commonly called prayers.
dragon: A reptile-like monster that usually has wings and a devastating breath
weapon — a worthy challenge for any true hero!
dragonborn: A player character race. Dragonborn are big, strong reptilians
who often wander the world as mercenaries. They have the ability to breathe
fire (or other dangerous stuff) on their enemies, much like dragons. They
make excellent fighters, paladins, and warlords.
Dungeon Master (DM): The player who runs the game for the other players.
The DM creates the dungeons and lands the PCs explore, decides what sort
of monsters or challenges the PCs must overcome, controls the monsters
when they battle the adventurers, and referees the game.
dwarf: A player character race. Dwarves are mountain-folk who are the finest
miners and metalworkers in the world. They are exceedingly tough and
resilient and make excellent clerics and paladins. 
eladrin: A player character race. Eladrins are an elf-like people who live in
beautiful cities in the Feywild (the lands of faerie). They are agile and intelli-
gent and make excellent rangers, rogues, and wizards.
elemental: A monster origin that describes creatures native to the Elemental
Chaos, the plane of existence where the fundamental forces of the world are
born. Demons, efreet, salamanders, and slaad are all elemental monsters.
elf: A player character race. Elves are a graceful woodland race who are the
finest archers and hunters in the world. They do very well as clerics, rangers,
and rogues.
encounter: Adventures consist of a series of encounters. Fights against mon-
sters are called combat encounters. Noncombat encounters, in contrast, 
feature skill challenges or roleplaying situations such as negotiations.
encounter power: A power that you can use once per encounter. You regain
encounter powers after a short rest.
401
Glossary

epic destiny: A set of character abilities and powers you choose when your
character reaches 21st level. You continue to advance in your original 
character class.
escape: A combat action in which you try to get away from an enemy who’s
grabbing you (see also grab), or you get out of a similar effect. An escape
attempt is a move action.
evil: An alignment. Evil creatures don’t care if they have to hurt others to get
ahead, and they use power to enslave or tyrannize others. 
experience points (XP): A measure of your character’s personal achievement
and advancement. Your character earns XP by defeating monsters and over-
coming challenges. Characters continue to accumulate experience points
throughout their careers, gaining new levels in their character class at 
certain experience point totals.
exploit: A martial power.
extended rest: A period of recuperation that lasts at least six hours of time 
in the game world. After an extended rest, a character’s powers recharge.
feat: A special talent, knack, edge, or tactic your character possesses. For
example, the Toughness feat increases the number of hit points a character
has; the Weapon Focus feat increases the damage a character deals with
weapons of a specific group; and the Linguist feat lets a character learn addi-
tional languages.
fey: A monster origin that describes creatures native to the Feywild, the realm
of faerie. Fey monsters include various nature spirits or creatures with similar
mystic origins, such as the dryad, hag, or satyr.
fighter: A player character class. Fighters have exceptional combat abilities
and skills with weapons.
flank: To be directly on the other side of an opponent who is being threatened
by another ally. A flanking attacker gains combat advantage against the flanked
opponent.
Fortitude defense (Fort): One of the basic defense scores. Attacks affecting
Fortitude defense generally include effects a character resists through sheer
physical stamina or power, such as surviving the effects of poison or resist-
ing movement.
gish: Table talk for a character who uses both martial and arcane powers.
Usually, this character will be a fighter with wizard multiclass feats, so that
he or she has a mix of fighter powers and wizard powers.
402
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies, 4th Edition 

gold piece (gp): The standard unit of currency in the D&D game. One gold
piece equals 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces; 100 gold pieces equal 
1 platinum piece.
good: An alignment. Good creatures believe that aiding others is the right
thing to do, and they’re willing to stand up to evil in any form.
grab: A combat action in which a character tries to seize an opponent and
keep him from moving away. When a character is grabbed, he or she can still
act normally in most regards, except that he or she can’t move unless you
succeed in an escape attempt. 
half-elf: A player character race. Half-elves are people descended from a mix-
ture of human and elven ancestors, and combine many of the best features of
both races. They excel as warlocks and do well as paladins or warlords.
halfling: A player character race. Halflings are clever, resourceful, and lucky.
Despite their small statures, they are quite brave and adventurous. Halflings
make very good rogues, rangers, and warlocks. 
healing: A keyword describing a power or ability that restores lost hit points.
healing surge: A single “dose” of healing, normally equal to 1⁄4 your character’s
normal full hit points. Most healing effects give you the ability to spend a
healing surge; the number of healing surges you can use per day depends 
on your character’s class and Constitution modifier.
hit: To make a successful attack roll, as in, “My attack’s a 27, did I hit?”
hit points (hp): A measure of your character’s health. Damage that characters
take decreases their current hit points. Lost hit points are restored either by
healing effects (drinking a potion of healing, for example), or by resting for a
time.
holy symbol: An implement used by clerics and paladins. 
human: A player character race. Humans are tough and adaptable, and can
do very well in any character class.
humanoid: A monster type made up of creatures that are roughly humanlike,
such as dwarves, elves, giants, goblins, and orcs.
immortal: A monster origin describing creatures native to the dominions of
the Astral Sea. Angels and devils are immortals.
implement: A device that serves as a “weapon” for a cleric, warlock, or
wizard. For example, a wizard might use a wand to deliver a spell attack
instead of striking with a sword or bow like a martial character would. 
See also holy symbol, orb, staff, and wand.
403
Glossary

initiative: A system for determining the sequence of actions during a battle.
Before the first round of combat, each combatant makes a single initiative
check. Each round, everyone acts in order from the highest initiative result to
the lowest. Usually, you just use your first initiative roll for the whole fight.
initiative check: A check used to determine your place in the initiative order
for a combat. An initiative check is 1d20 + Dexterity modifier + any special
modifiers your character may have.
insubstantial: Not quite physically real. Some monsters such as ghosts and
shadows are insubstantial. Insubstantial monsters take half damage from all
attacks.
keyword: A descriptive word in a power or monster description that lets you
know what groups that power or monster belongs to. For example, if a spell
has the arcane and fire keywords, anything else that affects arcane powers or
fire powers affects that spell. 
lawful good: An alignment. Lawful good creatures believe in establishing
order and enforcing just laws for the benefit of all creatures, and they’re 
willing to fight evil in any form.
leader: A character role. Leaders are light on offense but have powerful heal-
ing and defensive abilities that help the other characters in the party fight
better.
level: A measure of advancement or power applied to characters (for exam-
ple, a 10th-level fighter), monsters (an 8th-level ogre), powers (a 4th-level
divine prayer), and magic items (such as a 13th-level staff).
level modifier: A basic measure of skill derived from your character level.
Your level modifier is equal to half your character level, rounded down. For
example, a 5th-level character has a level modifier of +2, and an 18th-level
character has a level modifier of +9.
low-light vision: The ability to see better than a human in conditions of dim
illumination. Beings such as elves have low-light vision.
magic: Arcane and divine powers are generally considered to be “magic,” as
are effects or properties of magic items. 
magic item: A piece of equipment that is enchanted to offer a bonus or spe-
cial property of some kind. Magic items include armor; weapons; implements
(holy symbols, orbs, rods, staffs, and wands); boots and greaves; shields and
bracers; cloaks and amulets; belts; and wondrous items (a catch-all for every-
thing else). Some magic items can be used or worn only on a specific part of
the user’s body (or body slot), and are therefore known as slotted items.

magical beast: A monster type made up of creatures with beast-like forms
and supernatural powers or intelligence, such as displacer beasts, dragons,
gorgons, and ropers.
mark: To challenge a creature with a power or effect that demands its atten-
tion. If a creature you mark makes an attack that doesn’t include you, it takes a
–2 penalty on its attack rolls. New marks wipe out old marks, so if the paladin
challenges an enemy marked by a fighter, the paladin’s mark applies and the
fighter’s mark is cleared. 
martial: One of the power sources from which characters derive their abilities.
Fighters, rangers, rogues, and warlords make use of the martial power source.
Martial powers are commonly called exploits.
masterwork: Armor types constructed from such fantastic materials that the
“weakest” version you might ever find possesses at least a +4 enhancement
value. 
min-max: The practice of trying to make your character as effective as possi-
ble by choosing the right powers, feats, and magic items.
melee: Combat at close range, in which combatants are trading jabs, thrusts,
slams, or slashes with melee weapons or natural weapons.
melee attack: A type of attack in which the attacker targets a specific enemy
(or enemies) he or she can reach with a melee weapon — although sometimes
the melee “weapon” might simply be a touch that delivers the effect of a magi-
cal power.
milestone: A measure of your success in your current adventure. Usually,
milestones are determined by the number of experience points you’ve earned
so far. Reaching a milestone grants you an additional action point (see action
point) and may provide other benefits as well.
monster origin: A keyword that describes what sort of creature a monster is:
aberrant, elemental, fey, immortal, natural, or shadow. Most creatures native
to the mortal world — humans, dragons, bears, goblins, and so on — are 
natural. 
multiclass: A type of feat that allows your character to acquire a small number
of class features, skills, or powers of another class.
nonplayer character (NPC): A character controlled by the DM. NPCs can be
any of the people your character meets (such as innkeepers, merchants, and
the rich noble that asked the party to retrieve a lost or stolen heirloom), as
well as the villains or rivals your character encounters (such as evil clerics,
wizards, rogues, and fighters). 
405
Glossary

opportunity attack: A single basic melee attack that a combatant may make
when an opponent within reach takes an action that provokes an opportunity
attack, such as moving without using the shift action or using a ranged attack.
orb: A type of magic implement. Implements function much like weapons for
weapon-using characters; if you have a magic orb, it gives you an enhance-
ment bonus of +1 or more that you can add to all attack and damage rolls you
make when wielding that device.
paladin: A player character class. Paladins are divine defenders who are often
champions of justice and good.
paragon path: A specific set of character abilities and powers you choose
when your character reaches 11th level. You continue to advance in your
original character class.
plane: A different realm or layer of existence, such as the Shadowfell, the
Elemental Chaos, or the Astral Sea.
platinum piece (pp): A unit of currency equal to 100 gold pieces.
player character (PC): A character controlled by one of the players at the
table, as opposed to the DM. Your character is your avatar in the game.
potion: A magic item that’s basically a one-shot effect that any character 
can use.
power: A specific attack, defense, or utility effect a character or creature can
use. Powers may be usable at-will, once per encounter, or once per day. 
power source: The mechanism or origin of your character’s heroic powers.
The three power sources described in the Player’s Handbook are martial,
arcane, and divine, but other power sources exist too. 
prayer: A divine power.
prerequisite: A condition or requirement that must be met before your char-
acter can get something. For example, the Hammer Rhythm feat has prerequi-
sites of Strength 15 and Constitution 17.
pull: An effect that lets you drag another creature closer to you by the stated
number of squares.
push: An effect that lets you move another creature away from you by the
stated number of squares.
406
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies, 4th Edition 

race: A character’s species or kind. Race determines a character’s general
size and looks, and it also grants special bonuses to skills and ability scores.
At the time of this writing, the races available for you to play are dragonborn,
dwarf, eladrin, elf, half-elf, halfling, human, and tiefling.
range: The distance at which you can attack with a ranged weapon. For exam-
ple, the shortbow has a range of 15/30 squares. If you shoot at 15 squares or
less, the attack takes no penalty; if you shoot at 16 to 30 squares, it’s a long-
range attack, and takes a –2 penalty.
ranged attack: A type of attack in which the attacker targets a specific enemy
(or enemies) he or she can fire at with a thrown weapon, missile weapon, or
magical effect such as a spell or prayer.
ranger: A player character class. Rangers are martial strikers and have access
to excellent ranged attacks (archery) and excellent melee attacks (two-weapon
fighting). They are skilled warriors of the wilderness.
reach: The ability to make a melee attack against someone who isn’t standing
right next to you. Many big monsters have natural reach; human-sized char-
acters can get reach by choosing long weapons such as polearms.
Reflex defense (Ref): One of a creature’s basic defenses. It measures the abil-
ity to evade an attack through quickness or agility. Attacks that target Reflex
defense are usually area blasts or rays that the target might dodge. In addi-
tion, attacks that bypass armor often target Reflex defense instead of Armor
Class. 
resistance: A special defense that allows a creature to ignore a set amount of
damage from attacks of certain types. For example, wearing +2 blackiron armor
gives you resist 5 fire and resist 5 necrotic. Any attacks with the fire or necrotic
keywords deal –5 damage against you.
rogue: A player character class. Rogues are martial strikers. They are nimble
characters who excel at using skills and making sneak attacks.
role: A term describing a character or monster’s basic function in combat.
Player character roles include defender, striker, controller, and leader.
Monster roles include artillery, brute, lurker, skirmisher, and soldier.
round: A single unit of game time, especially in battles. A round represents
about six seconds in the game world (but it takes longer than that in real
time).
run: Run is a move action that lets you move up to your speed +2 squares.
However, you take a penalty on your attack rolls and grant combat advantage
until your next turn.
407
Glossary

saving throw (save): A roll made to recover from the negative effects of a
special attack, such as a spell or monster ability. For example, a powerful
attack might leave the target weakened or incapacitated until he or she suc-
ceeds on a saving throw. Normally a creature can attempt a saving throw
each round against each effect currently affecting it.
scroll: A magic item that’s basically a one-shot use of a single specific ritual.
For example, a scroll of linked portal lets your character perform the 
ritual linked portal one time, even if your character normally couldn’t per-
form that ritual.
second wind: A combat action that lets you spend a standard action to use
one of your healing surges. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to all defenses
until the start of your next turn. You can use second wind only once per
encounter.
shadow: A monster origin describing creatures native to the Shadowfell, the
plane of shadow that exists parallel to the mortal world. Shadar-kai, night-
shades, and many undead are shadow monsters.
shift: A move action that lets you adjust your position 1 square in any direc-
tion. A shift doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack.
short rest: Characters recuperate between encounters by taking a short rest
that lasts at least five minutes in the game world. After a short rest, encounter
powers are recharged.
silver piece (sp): A unit of currency equal to 1/10 of a gold piece.
slide: An effect that lets you move another creature a certain number of
spaces in any direction you want.
spell: An arcane power.
stack: Combine multiple bonuses for a cumulative effect. Usually, you get only
the best bonus of any given type that applies, but if you gain bonuses of dif-
ferent types, they all work together. For example, two effects granting a +2
power bonus to AC don’t stack; they both grant power bonuses, so you get
only the better of the two. If one effect granted a +2 feat bonus and the other
granted a +2 power bonus, they would stack and grant a +4 bonus to AC.
staff: A type of magic implement. Implements function much like weapons for
weapon-using characters; if you have a magic staff, it gives you an enhance-
ment bonus of +1 or more that you can add to all attack and damage rolls you
make when wielding that device. (The quarterstaff is a simple weapon that’s
pretty much a two-handed club.)
striker: A character role. Strikers are offense-oriented characters who excel
in dealing a lot of damage to one target at a time.
408
Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies, 4th Edition 

sustain: Concentrating to maintain an active power’s effect. Most powers
don’t require you to sustain them, but a few do; the details depend on each
specific power. Sustaining a power can be a minor or standard action.
take 10: Instead of risking a bad roll on some skill checks, you can simply
state that you want to “take 10.” This gives you a result as if you’d rolled a 10
on your 1d20 roll, plus whatever modifiers apply. You can take 10 only when
your character is not being threatened or distracted; the DM has the final say
on whether you can take 10 in any given situation or check.
tiefling: A player character race. Tieflings are the descendants of humans
who long ago bargained with infernal powers. They are a charismatic, self-
reliant race. Tieflings make excellent warlocks, warlords, and wizards.
two-handed weapon: A weapon designed for use in two hands, such as a
greatsword.
unaligned: An alignment (or more specifically, the lack of one). Unaligned
creatures pursue their own interests. Unaligned heroes do help people, but
usually because they expect some reward.
unarmed strike: An attack made by a character or creature without a weapon.
(Most animals and monsters have natural weapons such as claws or teeth and,
therefore, aren’t considered “unarmed”; they don’t make unarmed strikes.)
undead: A keyword that describes monsters that have died but won’t stay
buried, including ghosts, ghouls, vampires, skeletons, and wraiths. Undead
are immune to some attacks and vulnerable to others.
wand: A type of magic implement. Implements function much like weapons
for weapon-using characters; if you have a magic wand, it gives you an
enhancement bonus of +1 or more that you can add to all attack and damage
rolls you make when wielding that device.
warlock: A player character class. Warlocks are highly elusive arcane strikers.
They use fearsome curses and deadly spells to defeat their enemies.
warlord: A player character class. Warlords are martial leaders. They special-
ize in melee combat, often standing side by side with the party’s defenders.
weapon group: The family a particular weapon belongs to. For example, the
light blades group includes daggers, short swords, and rapiers. Any power
you can use with a light blade, you can use with any of these weapons.
Will defense (Will): One of the basic defenses. Will defense measures your
character’s ability to withstand ill effects through mental strength and
willpower.
409
Glossary

wizard: A player character class. Wizards are arcane controllers. They have
low hit points and Armor Class, but they wield powerful arcane spells that
can affect multiple enemies at once.
world, the: The “normal” plane of existence; the “real world” for D&D charac-
ters, as opposed to other planes like the Feywild, the Nine Hells, or the
Elemental Chaos (see plane). Sometimes referred to as “the mortal world” 
or “the world of mortals.”
