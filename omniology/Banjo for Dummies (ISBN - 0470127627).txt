About the Author
Banjo player Bill Evans is not to be confused with the deceased jazz piano
legend or the very much living jazz saxophone player (or the Austin, Texas,
real estate agent). This Bill Evans is a banjo player, performer, teacher, work-
shop leader, recording artist, composer, producer, record label owner, and
American music historian. For a banjo player, Bill has an unusual amount of
schooling. He earned his bachelor’s degree in anthropology with a specializa-
tion in folklore from the University of Virginia as a DuPont Scholar and a
master’s degree in music with a specialization in ethnomusicology from the
University of California, Berkeley. After completing coursework for the PhD 
at Berkeley with a specialization in American music and the music of Japan,
Bill taught courses in ethnomusicology and American music history at San
Francisco State University, Duke University, and the University of Virginia and
was the Associate Director of the International Bluegrass Music Museum 
in Owensboro, Kentucky. A recipient of a Brown Foreman–Al Smith Artist
Fellowship from the Kentucky Arts Council, Bill has also served as a consul-
tant to the National Endowment for the Arts.
As a recording artist, Bill’s CD Native and Fine (Rounder Records) earned an
honorable mention for Acoustic Instrumental Recording of the Year from
NAIRD. His CD Bill Evans Plays Banjo (Native and Fine Records), featuring all
original instrumental compositions, was on many “best of” lists, including
those of the Chicago Tribune and County Sales. Bill earned a nomination 
for “Recorded Event of the Year” from the International Bluegrass Music
Association for his work as producer on Suzanne Thomas’ CD Dear Friend
and Gentle Hearts. As a performing artist, Bill has played with Dry Branch Fire
Squad, Tony Trischka, David Grisman, Peter Rowan, Maria Muldaur, Jody
Stecher, Kathy Kallick and Laurie Lewis, among others. He tours nationally
with his solo show “The Banjo in America” in addition to leading his own
band, the Bill Evans String Summit.
Bill is a long-time contributor to Banjo Newsletter magazine and co-hosts an
annual banjo camp, the Sonny Osborne NashCamp Banjo Retreat, held each
fall outside of Nashville, Tennessee. In addition, Bill participates in work-
shops all over North America, hosts several popular instructional DVDs for
AcuTab Publications, and maintains an active private teaching practice at his
home in Albany, California. His former students include Chris Pandolfi, Greg
Liszt, Jayme Stone, and Eric Yates. He is the co-author of Parking Lot Picker’s
Songbook: Banjo Edition from Mel Bay Publications.

Introduction
A
re you ready to play the five-string banjo? If so, get ready for a fantastic
ride. So whether you’re reading this book at home or standing in a book-
store aisle, hold Banjo For Dummies high and proud for all to see. I guarantee
that this book is going to open the door to a life of musical fulfillment with
one of the world’s greatest instruments.
Although the title of this book is probably enough to raise a good chuckle
from many self-proclaimed “music lovers,” let me assure you right from the
start that Banjo For Dummies isn’t a collection of the world’s best banjo
jokes — or even the worst.
You probably have already come to the realization that no matter what you
may have seen on television or in old movies, real banjo players aren’t
comedic rubes or country bumpkins. They’re folks just like you and me from
all walks of life who at some point heard the sound of a banjo and said to
themselves “That’s for me!”
And what a gloriously rambunctious and complex sound it is! The banjo is
usually associated with bluegrass, folk, and country music, but these days,
musicians play just about any kind of music on the banjo — from jazz to clas-
sical to rock and everything in between. You can use the banjo to accompany
songs around a campfire or to play a Bach partita; what you do with the
instrument is up to you.
If you’re a total beginner to the banjo, Banjo For Dummies is the best way to
get started on the five-string banjo. If you already play the banjo, this book
can broaden your knowledge, enhance your playing ability, and deepen your
love for the world’s greatest instrument. You can begin to play the banjo at
age 8 or 80, and if you don’t think you have any talent for playing a musical
instrument, then you’ve come to exactly the right place. The banjo is waiting
to turn you into a musician.
About This Book
I’ve taught hundreds of banjo players of all ages in over 30 years of teaching,
and for what it’s worth, I even have a master’s degree in music (how’s that for
blowing away a few banjo player stereotypes!). In the process, I’ve seen what
works and what doesn’t work, and I know the location of pretty much every
nasty pothole along the old banjo-pickin’ highway.

I’ve put all this experience to use in Banjo For Dummies, your complete guide
to the five-string banjo. This book safely transports you from the most basic
beginners’ questions to performing intermediate tunes played in a variety of
styles. I even sneak in a few advanced concepts for those of you who really
want to be challenged. You can find clear, step-by-step explanations to each
and every technique and discover shortcuts that are especially helpful to the
adult student.
Although I’d like to think that this book makes for a gripping and powerful lit-
erary experience, don’t worry about reading Banjo For Dummies cover to
cover. Think of this book instead as a reference work that’s designed for you
to jump in and jump out at any point along the way. Take a look at the table of
contents and start at the chapter or section that best matches your ability
and interests the most. Don’t forget to check out the index at the back of the
book for an even more comprehensive listing of topics.
If you skim through the more than 130 musical examples in the book, you
may notice that you can’t find a speck of conventional music notation any-
where in Banjo For Dummies. Instead, you find banjo tablature, the universal
form of written music notation for just about all styles of banjo playing.
Tablature is easier to master than regular musical notation and clearly shows
you exactly what to do with both hands. When combined with this book’s
excellent photos and the accompanying audio CD, not discovering the right
way to play banjo is pretty darn impossible.
If you’re new to playing, here’s how to get the most out of this book:
 Figure out the hand and finger positions by mimicking the photos and
diagrams. Finding a comfortable hand position — especially in the right
hand — is crucially important in banjo playing. You can find plenty of
pictures and detailed explanations showing you how to find the positions
that work best for you throughout this book. Chord diagrams reinforce
the photos by showing you exactly where your fingers need to go.
 Listen to the CD. Each musical example in the book is included on the
CD that you find inside the back cover. I can’t overemphasize how
important listening is to becoming a good banjo player. If you have the
sound of every note firmly in your head before you start to play, you can
master each exercise, hot lick, and song much more quickly. And on many
tracks, you can play along with the guitar and mandolin accompaniment.
Don’t pass that gig up!
 Read the tablature. Also called tab, tablature is a great way to represent
what both hands do when you play a banjo tune. Tab shows you which
strings to pick with the right hand and what to fret with the left hand
(more on tab, picking, and fretting in Chapters 2 and 3). I show you how
to read it, how best to use it, and even when best to set it aside.

Banjo For Dummies 

Conventions Used in This Book
To make key terms and ideas more consistent and easier to understand,
Banjo For Dummies employs the following conventions throughout the book:
 When I reference a Web site that I want you to check out, it appears in a
very official-looking monofont type. (Believe it or not, even banjo play-
ers use the Internet.)
Note: When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have
needed to break across two lines of text. If that happens, rest assured
that the publishers haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens)
to indicate the break. Just type in exactly what you see in this book, 
pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
 I italicize words I define (words you may want to pay attention to) in reg-
ular text. I also use italics for emphasis here and there (as a banjo player,
getting excited once in a while is just natural for me).
 Key words or phrases in bulleted lists and numbered steps are printed
in bold, so you don’t miss out on this important info.
 When I talk about the right-hand techniques, know that the right hand
is the hand that picks or strums the strings, and the left hand is the
hand that presses the strings down on the neck and does some of those
fancy techniques that may have attracted you to the banjo in the first
place. However, if you’re left handed and already play a banjo specially
made for left-handed players, please read right hand to mean left hand,
and vice versa.
 This book often uses the terms up, down, higher, and lower to refer to
where your left hand moves on the banjo neck (the skinny part with the
strings). When you move up the neck on the banjo, you’re moving your
left hand towards the body (or pot) of the instrument and playing notes
that are higher in pitch. Conversely, when you move down the neck,
you’re moving your left hand towards the banjo headstock, away from
the pot, and playing notes that sound lower.
 I use numbers in different ways throughout the book (don’t worry — no
math skills required). The five banjo strings have number names (5th,
4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st), and I also refer to left-hand fretted positions
using numbers (which can be from the first to the 22nd fret). Sometimes,
numbers also describe the quality or sound of a chord, such as in D7.
 If numbers weren’t enough, I also use letters throughout the book to
instruct you in finger placements. You encounter letters standing for the
right-hand finger that picks a string (T = thumb, I = index, and M = middle)
and also for the left-hand finger that pushes a particular string against
the fingerboard (I = index, M = middle, R = ring, and P = pinky).
3
Introduction

 As in all For Dummies books, figures are numbered sequentially within
each chapter. I number the tablature examples, or tab, separately. Many
tab examples are on the accompanying CD, and the track number is pro-
vided in the tab’s caption.
What You’re Not to Read
If you’re looking just for the need-to-know information and want to skip a few
parts that aren’t essential to knowing how to play or maintain the banjo, you
can breeze right on by sidebars (the gray shaded boxes) and paragraphs
tagged by the Technical Stuff icon. However, if you like knowing some banjo
trivia or want some nonessential tips and tools, by golly, read it all!
Foolish Assumptions
I’m betting that because you’ve picked up this book you’re interested in play-
ing the banjo, but I don’t want to assume too much more as I begin this banjo
adventure with you. You may or may not own a banjo or have any prior expe-
rience on the banjo or any other kind of instrument, and I don’t assume you
come to this book knowing anything about music. I also don’t assume you’re
interested in one particular style or way of playing the banjo over another
(which is why I include more than one).
However, I do assume that you’re going to be playing a five-string banjo
instead of a tenor or plectrum banjo, which are actually different kinds of
instruments (see Chapter 1). I also assume that you want to get started
quickly and not waste time with unnecessary and overly technical information.
If I’ve described you in one way or another, you’ve come to the right place.
How This Book Is Organized
Banjo For Dummies is organized so that you can get the information you want
quickly without spending a lot of time digging for it. The chapters are grouped
into the following seven parts that focus on different aspects of the banjo.
4
Banjo For Dummies 

Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo
This part includes information that every beginner needs to know to get
started playing the banjo, including the different kinds of five-string banjos
and the various parts of the instrument. You also discover the correct body
posture, how to tune the instrument to itself and to an electronic tuner, and
how to fret your first chords. I also cover some of the basic elements of
music, such as rhythm, meter, chord progressions, and banjo tablature.
Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients
One of the things that makes Banjo For Dummies unique is that it covers both
clawhammer and bluegrass styles in Part II. Although these techniques are
the two most popular ways of playing banjo today, most other banjo books
focus on either one way of playing or the other. That’s not good enough! I cover
both approaches within these pages.
I help you find a comfortable right-hand position and present the basic pick-
ing patterns used in bluegrass and clawhammer banjo playing. You also
figure out in this part how to select fingerpicks and shape them to fit your
right hand for bluegrass playing. You can then make your playing sound more
authentic by incorporating left-hand slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and
chokes, and even discover how to find a melody on the banjo and play it by
using either clawhammer or bluegrass techniques. This part closes with
beginners’ bluegrass and clawhammer versions of four popular banjo tunes.
Part III: Playing Styles Past, 
Present, and Future
You move beyond beginners’ material in this part and experience the histori-
cal roots of the banjo as well as explore the most recent stylistic and techni-
cal innovations. I take you back to the late-19th and early-20th centuries as
you play two minstrel-style tunes and two classic-era pieces. You also get a
more in-depth look at bluegrass style, exploring Scruggs, melodic, and single-
string techniques and licks. And you can find a handful of great tunes scattered
throughout this part, just ready for the playing.

Introduction

Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care 
and Feeding, and More
Don’t have a banjo? Not sure how to keep your banjo in tip-top shape? No
worries. I include a complete (and completely honest) buyer’s guide and
maintenance advice in this part. The buyer’s guide can help you spend your
money wisely on anything from a beginners’ instrument to a professional-model
banjo. I also cover those accessories you really need as well as those extras
that are just fun to have around the house. I take time to focus on banjo main-
tenance and string changing as well, so you can unearth the secrets of what
you can do to keep your banjo sounding and looking great. Finally, I help you
find a good teacher, survive your first jam session, and expand your musical
horizons through workshops, camps, and music festivals.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is a For Dummies trademark section — and you don’t want
to miss out by not reading this part. In it, I present ten suggestions to make
your practice time more fun and productive. I also include a select list of ten
important banjo players who are well worth the listen.
Part VI: Appendixes
You can never grow tiresome when it comes to information on the banjo
(at least I think so), which is why I’ve included some supplementary info in
appendix form. In this part, you can find a handy chord digest. I also include
some instructions about the CD that accompanies this book to ensure that
you’re getting the full multimedia experience.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins of this book, you can often find the following friendly icons to
help you recognize different types of information I’ve included:

Where to Go from Here
You’re probably a banjo player on a mission, so you want to know where,
when, and how you can get started. You can always read this book straight
through, but the beauty of any For Dummies book is that you can direct your
own course and dip into chapters as you need them.
As you create your own roadmap, I can offer you a few suggestions to point
you in the right direction:
 If you need to purchase a banjo or you’re interested in an upgrade, head
to the buyer’s guide at Chapter 9 first.
 If you’re a beginner and want to start playing right away, proceed to
Chapters 2 and 3, where you get your banjo in tune and play your
first chords.
 If you’re ready to start work on authentic banjo styles, roll up your
sleeves and work through Chapters 4, 5, and 6.
 More experienced players can check out the historical styles covered in
Chapter 7 and the modern techniques in Chapter 8.

f you take a trip, you’d probably like to know where you’re going (after all,
you don’t want to end up like those guys in that Deliverance movie, do
you?). If you’re new to the banjo and don’t yet own an instrument or if you’re
wondering about your eventual musical destination, this chapter is definitely
the place to start your Banjo For Dummies trip. The key is in the ignition, so
put this thing in drive!
In this chapter, you spread out your banjo road map and start planning what 
I hope will be a wonderful, lifelong musical journey with the five-string banjo.
I discuss what makes the five-string banjo different from other kinds of
stringed instruments, and you can also take a look at the various kinds of
banjos available today. I name the parts of the banjo and summarize the
musical skills you can master in this book on the way to becoming a good
player.
Getting into Banjo
Something about the five-string banjo brings out strong feelings in people.
Folks who like the banjo usually really like it. What is it about this instrument
that inspires such passion, and how can you tell if you’ve been bitten by the
banjo bug? This section explores the answer to these questions.

Loving that amazing sound
You know the sound of the banjo when you hear it: the bright, rhythmic
waterfall of short, cascading notes that can conjure up just about any emo-
tion (but usually happy first comes to mind for the typical guy on the street).
The banjo is usually associated with folk, country, and bluegrass music, but
these days, you can also hear the instrument in jazz, rock, and even classical
settings.
Over the years, I’ve asked hundreds of amateur and professional players why
they initially got interested in the instrument and the usual answer is “I fell in
love with the sound.” I think an equal attraction is the lure of hearing a lot of
notes compressed into what seems like the smallest of musical spaces. In the
hands of a skilled player, the banjo is an instrument that’s capable of amazing
virtuosity.
Becoming a true believer
Banjo players usually remember well the precise moment in time that they
became hooked on the instrument. For me, growing up as a suburban
teenager far from significant hills of any kind, that moment was when I was
watching Roy Clark play banjo on Hee Haw and thinking to myself, “If I can
somehow sit through this show every week, I think I can eventually learn
‘Cripple Creek.’” I didn’t especially like country music at that time, and I’d
never heard of folk or bluegrass music — but I really loved the sound of the
banjo.
Growing up in the 1970s, I could also hear the banjo as a background instru-
ment on hit songs from the Eagles, the Doobie Brothers, Neil Young, and
James Taylor. Hearing the banjo in these contexts made me believe that the
banjo must be cool if those musicians used it on their recordings, despite
what my friends thought about this disturbing turn in my musical tastes.
And, of course, I was also influenced by the popularity of “Dueling Banjos”
during these years (I didn’t realize until years later who was depicted playing
the instrument in this movie). I already knew a little about playing the guitar,
and I decided that I wanted to try and teach myself to play banjo.
After enrolling in a community college beginners’ banjo class, I discovered an
entire musical subculture of folk and bluegrass music where the banjo was
not only welcome, but was also pretty much the most revered instrument of
them all. Getting to know others who felt the same way as I did about the
banjo really helped to get me hooked.
12
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

Almost 40 years later, I’m happy to report that the banjo is more popular than
ever. Musicians have continued to push the musical boundaries of the instru-
ment, and these days, about the only folks who think the banjo is good for
just one musical style are those television producers who still insist on
having banjo music in the background of their pickup truck commercials.
My own youthful enthusiasm for the banjo evolved into a wonderful lifelong
relationship that is still growing strong. I get a joyful feeling every time I play
a tune on the banjo. I’m also amazed at how my love for the instrument has
opened the door to many new and wonderful experiences (such as graduate
school, international touring and teaching, and this book!) and is at the basis
of many of my most cherished friendships. Even if you never become as
obsessed about the banjo as I am, I believe that the banjo can improve your
life and make you a happier person if you give it the chance.
Identifying Different Kinds of Banjos
Banjo For Dummies is your complete guide to musical adventure on the five-
string banjo. I focus on the five-string banjo because this instrument is by far
the most popular type of banjo being played today and is the kind of banjo
that is used to play bluegrass, folk, and country music. The five-string banjo
is also currently carving new niches in jazz, rock, and classical music.
However, in the first half of the 20th century, the most popular banjos were
four-string tenor and plectrum banjos. These banjos are really different
instruments and shouldn’t be confused with the five-string banjo. Under-
standing the differences between banjos is important, because before you
begin your adventure, you need to make sure you’re traveling with the right
kind of equipment.
In the following sections, I compare and contrast the different instruments in
the banjo family, so you don’t mistake one type of banjo for another.
Five-string banjo: The subject of the book
The short 5th string is what makes the five-string banjo different from other
types of banjos and from just about every other instrument in the known uni-
verse. Most of the time, you know immediately that you’re looking at a five-
string banjo when you see a tuning peg (a geared mechanism that keeps the
string in tune) that’s sticking out almost halfway up the neck (the long narrow
piece of wood where you fret strings with the left hand; for more on these
13
Chapter 1: First Steps: Banjo Basics

terms, see a later section on the parts of the banjo). This tuning peg holds
the 5th string of the banjo (see Figure 1-1).
The 5th string is a crucial distinguishing characteristic of the five-string
banjo, both in the instrument’s appearance and the sound of the music. The
5th string is not only shorter than the other four strings of the banjo, but this
string is also the highest in sound (or pitch). The 5th string on a banjo lies
within easy reach of the right-hand thumb, which you use to play this string
in all kinds of banjo music. Having the highest-pitched string next to the
string with the lowest pitch is unusual in comparison to how pitches are
arranged on the strings of a guitar (as you can see in Figure 1-1), but this is
one of the things that makes the banjo sound so great! This characteristic of
the banjo is also one part of the instrument’s ancient African ancestry (for
more on this, see Chapter 7).
Tenor and plectrum banjos: 
Look for another book
In the early decades of the 20th century, folks loved the quality of sound of
the banjo so much that they attached different kinds of necks to the banjo
body to create new instruments with different numbers of strings. These
hybrid instruments were tuned and played differently from the five-string
banjo.

14
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

Tenor and plectrum banjos are examples of this phenomenon. These four-
stringed instruments are commonly used in traditional jazz and Dixieland
music, don’t have the short 5th string, and are usually played with a flatpick
instead of with the fingers.
Although these banjos have the same tone and general appearance as the
five-string banjo, tenor and plectrum banjos use other tunings and playing
techniques and are viewed as different instruments by banjo fans. These
days, you may encounter a tenor or plectrum banjo when you hear a
Dixieland band or the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, go to a mummers’ parade,
or catch an old Lawrence Welk rerun on television.
Don’t confuse these types of banjos with the five-string variety! The five-
string banjo is by far the most popular kind of banjo played today and its
music is almost certainly what attracted you to the instrument. However,
confusing the appearance of a five-string banjo with the four-string tenor or
plectrum type of banjo is easy. You see, the bodies of these instruments are
the same, but the necks reveal the difference (see Figure 1-2). You can’t play
five-string banjo music on a four-string tenor or plectrum banjo — these
instruments aren’t interchangeable! You need a five-string banjo to play five-
string banjo music.
15
Chapter 1: First Steps: Banjo Basics
More banjos (with a twist)
In the early decades of the 20th century,
America was mad for anything that sounded
remotely like a banjo (amazing, isn’t it?).
Instrument makers took guitar and mandolin
necks and attached them to banjo bodies, cre-
ating new kinds of instruments that had the
sound of a five-string or tenor banjo but were
played by using guitar and mandolin techniques.
Banjos with mandolin necks have eight strings
and are called mandolin banjos or mando-
banjos. These instruments are generally smaller
than most five-string banjos. Banjos with guitar
necks have six strings and are called guitar
banjos. These instruments can be a bit larger
than most five-string banjos.
Today, these more obscure branches of the
banjo family tree are seen largely as novelty
instruments and, like the tenor and plectrum
banjo (see the section “Tenor and plectrum
banjos: Look for another book” in this chapter),
are considered to be a different kind of instru-
ment than a five-string banjo. You may hear
these types of banjos used occasionally in early
jazz or blues or by a jug band.

Knowing the Parts of a Banjo
Unlike a guitar, violin, or mandolin, a banjo is an amalgam of wood, metal,
skin, and/or plastic held together by rods, nuts, screws, and brackets. You
could call it the Frankenstein of musical instruments, but I like to think of it
more like the Bionic Woman. All banjos share the common characteristic of
a
b
Figure 1-2:
Comparing
a five-string
(a) and a
plectrum
banjo (b).
16
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

having a replaceable membrane made of plastic or animal skin (called the
head) that is stretched tightly across the body of the banjo (called the pot) to
form the top of the resonating body of the instrument (see Figure 1-3).
Five-string banjos come in three basic different styles: open-back, resonator,
and electric banjos. Musicians select the kind of banjo they play based on
their musical style and their personal tastes. Chapter 9 explains the differ-
ences between these kinds of banjos, along with tips for making an informed
purchase.
In the following sections, you get to know the banjo from head to toe. You
also discover how the instrument captures the energy of a plucked string and
turns it into that unmistakably great sound that banjo players love. You can
refer to Figure 1-4 to see exactly where these parts are located on the banjo.
Looking at the neck
The neck is one of the two main sections of the banjo (the pot being the
other; see the section “Checking out the pot”). The neck is the long piece of
wood that supports the strings and tuners. Necks are usually made of maple,
mahogany, or walnut.
To get a better feel for the banjo, take a look at the parts of the banjo neck:
 Frets: The thin, metal bars on the banjo neck that are positioned at pre-
cise intervals to give you the various pitches needed when fretting a
string. (Fretting is what you do when you move a left-hand finger into
position behind a fret to change the pitch of a string.) In the world of
fretting, you use the term up the neck to refer to moving the left hand
towards the pot and down the neck when you talk about moving the left
hand towards the nut and peghead.
 Fingerboard: A thin, flat wooden strip glued to the neck that holds the
frets and acts as the surface upon which the left hand produces notes
and chords.
 Peghead: Also called the headstock, the peghead is the elaborately
shaped end of the neck that holds the tuning pegs for the four lower
strings of the banjo.
 Tuning pegs: Sometimes called tuners or tuning machines, these pegs 
are the devices that raise or lower the pitch of the banjo’s strings with a
turn of the buttons located on the backside of the peghead. The pegs for
strings 1 through 4 are attached to the peghead, while the tuning peg for
the 5th string is found at the top of the neck near the fifth fret.

Chapter 1: First Steps: Banjo Basics

 Nut: A block of ivory, bone, or plastic that’s glued to the end of the fin-
gerboard where the peghead begins. Strings 1 through 4 pass through
the grooves in the nut on their way to the shafts of the tuning pegs. The
5th string has its own nut, located near the fifth fret.
 Heel: The name given to end of the neck that’s attached to the pot of the
banjo.
 Truss rod: You can’t see the truss rod, but it’s an important part of the
banjo neck. The truss rod is an adjustable metal rod that runs down most
of the length of the banjo neck in a channel underneath the fingerboard.
This rod helps to keep the neck stable and controls the amount of curve
in the neck to keep the strings from buzzing when fretting. Most banjos
have adjustable truss rods, which can be accessed at the peghead by
removing the truss rod cover (a procedure best left to the pros).
Checking out the pot
The other major section of the banjo (other than the neck; see the preceding
section) is the pot, the round lower body of the banjo including all of its 
constituent parts:
 Head: The plastic or skin membrane that acts as the vibrating top of the
banjo. The head is largely responsible for the unique sound of your new
favorite instrument.
 Rim: Sometimes called the shell, the rim is the circular wooden ring that
is the centerpiece of the pot and is made from laminations or blocks of
maple or mahogany. A well-made rim is essential to a good-sounding
banjo.
 Tone ring: This part of the pot is a metal circular collar that is machined
to fit on top of the wooden rim, and the head is stretched tight across its
top outer circumference. Tone rings come in a variety of shapes and
sizes. Together with the rim, the tone ring provides the fundamental
shape and color to the banjo’s tone. However, tone rings aren’t found on
all banjos and having one isn’t absolutely necessary to having a good-
sounding instrument. (See Chapter 9 for more on tone rings.)
 Brackets: Sometimes called hooks, brackets are ringed around the banjo
pot and are responsible for tightening the head via the bracket screws
that are attached to each bracket on the underside of the banjo.
 Tension hoop: Sometimes called the stretcher band, this circular metal
ring fits over the outside edge of the banjo head and helps to uniformly
stretch the head down across the top of the tone ring as the brackets are
tightened.
20
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

 Bridge: The bridge transmits the vibrations of the strings to the head.
Bridges range in sizes from 5⁄8" to 3⁄4". They are movable, but are held fast
to the banjo head with the tension of the strings.
 Tailpiece: This part holds the strings on the pot end of the banjo. Many
tailpieces are adjustable in various ways that can subtly affect overall
banjo tone. (For more on tailpieces, see Chapter 10.)
 Armrest: The armrest is attached to the pot of the banjo and extends
over the top of the banjo head to make right-hand playing more comfort-
able while simultaneously protecting the head.
 Coordinating rods: Seen only from the back of the banjo, these rods are
attached at opposite ends of the rim, parallel to the banjo strings. The
primary function of the coordinating rods is to keep the neck securely
attached to the pot. However, they can also be used to make slight
adjustments to the height of the strings off of the fingerboard (called
string action). Some banjos have only one coordinating rod.
 Resonator: The bowl-shaped piece of wood that’s attached to many
banjos, especially those used in bluegrass music, is the resonator. The
resonator projects the sound out and away from the instrument. They’re
usually constructed from the same kind of wood as the banjo neck.
Open-back banjos don’t have resonators (see Chapter 9 for more on the
types of banjos).
 Resonator screws: Three or four screws that keep the resonator attached
to the rest of the banjo pot.
 Flange: A circular metal piece connecting the pot to the resonator that
helps to keep the resonator in place.
Picking up string vibrations
When you strike a banjo string with a right-hand finger or thumb, the string
starts to move back and forth. These vibrations move through the bridge (a
piece of wood positioned on the banjo head) to the banjo head, which ampli-
fies that sound. Banjo players frequently refer to right-hand playing as picking
the banjo. You can read more about authentic right-hand banjo picking tech-
niques in Chapter 4.
The pitch of any string (its sound as measured by how high or low it is) is
determined by how much tension or tightness is in each string and how long
or short it is. The tighter or shorter the string, the higher its pitch. You can
change the pitch of a string in two ways:
 Turn the tuning pegs. A twist of a tuning peg in one direction or the
other raises or lowers the pitch of a string. The direction is different for
each string. (For more on tuning, check out Chapter 2.)
21
Chapter 1: First Steps: Banjo Basics

 Fret the strings. When you fret a string, you place a left-hand finger
behind one of the 22 frets found on the fingerboard of the neck. As you
fret, you’re shortening the length of the string and raising its pitch. An
open string is one that is unfretted in the left hand. A fretted string
sounds higher in pitch compared to an open string or to that same
string fretted on a lower fret (a lower fret is one that is farther away from
the banjo body). For more on fretting with the left hand, see Chapter 2.
Becoming a Banjo Player
If the banjo is the first stringed instrument you’ve ever attempted to play, it
may seem as if you have a million things to remember at this first stage.
Everything feels so new and unfamiliar. Don’t get discouraged! Banjo players
tend to be perfectionists, so be careful not to let your desire to play things
correctly overwhelm your love for playing (and remember that everyone
learns from their mistakes — even banjo players). Having fun with the banjo
is more important than playing everything perfectly.
When you’re wanting to become more proficient on the banjo, you can’t find
a substitute for time actually spent playing the banjo — the more you play,
the faster you progress. Focus on one new skill at a time and don’t spend too
much time on the Internet finding out what everyone else thinks about this or
that aspect of banjo playing. Just play (and check out Chapter 13 for more
great practice suggestions). After you’ve gained a few basic skills, find other
musicians at your ability level to play with as soon as possible. Playing with
others also significantly speeds up your progress.
In the following sections, I present just a few of the skills you should strive 
to master as a banjo player (and as you make your way through Banjo For
Dummies).
Making wise purchase choices
These days, new players can find good starter banjos that are affordable and
easy to play. The crucial first step in your purchase is finding an acoustic spe-
cialty store that really knows banjos and actually likes banjo players. And as
you shop, keep in mind that your choice of instrument should be based
mostly upon the kind of music you want to play (and, of course, how much
money you have to spend).
I cover everything you need to know about what to look for in banjos and
playing accessories and how to find them in Chapters 9 and 10.

Tuning and holding your banjo
Keeping your instrument in tune is something that you practice each time
you play — and an absolutely essential skill when playing music with others.
Tuning your banjo can be frustrating at first, but with careful listening to
compare one pitch with another and some trial and error, you can have this
skill mastered in no time.
After you’re in tune, you want to adopt a comfortable playing position for
both sitting or standing. You have a lot of individual options in this regard.
Just remember to not raise the neck too high and try using a strap. If you
follow these two suggestions, you can be well on your way to finding your
personal comfort zone.
In Chapter 2, you can get comfortable holding the banjo, fitting the strap, and
getting in tune with an electronic tuner or another instrument.
Fretting chords with the left hand
A chord is three or more notes sounded together. Chords support a melody
and are the building blocks for accompanying other musicians. The best way
to begin your playing adventures is to become familiar with well-used chords
such as G, C, and D7. A comfortable left-hand position makes forming these
chords much more fun. Let your thumb touch the top of the back of the banjo
neck and be sure you’re using the tips of your fingers to press the strings just
behind the frets — now you’re in business.
In Chapters 2 and 3, you can dig deeper into finding a comfortable left-hand
position and get used to fretting chords up and down the banjo neck.
Playing authentic right- 
and left-hand patterns
Coordinating right-hand picking techniques with the left-hand work of making
chords and creating new notes is a full-time job for banjo players! Mastering
exercises that isolate what each hand does by itself lays the foundation for
making great banjo music with both hands together.
In Chapters 4, 5, and 8, you take a look at these techniques, because you can
use them in clawhammer and bluegrass banjo, create melodies, and accom-
pany others with these patterns.
23
Chapter 1: First Steps: Banjo Basics

Practicing some real tunes
The real fun begins when you utilize your technique to play melodies on the
instrument in a real banjo style. Melody notes can usually be organized as a
group of notes, called a scale. Finding melody notes in a song becomes easier
after you’ve mastered a few scales on the banjo neck, so I recommend that
you start with the scales I outline in Chapter 6.
After you get the feel for the scales, you can then use the right- and left-hand
techniques you’ve already mastered to capture as many melody notes as you
can and create arrangements that sound good on the instrument.
In Chapters 6, 7, and 8, you can play beginner and intermediate versions of
tunes in clawhammer, bluegrass, minstrel, and classic styles. Don’t forget to
listen to the CD to get the sound of these tunes in your ears before working
through them by using the accompanying tablature.
Making music with others in jam sessions
Banjo players love to make music with other musicians — guitarists, fiddlers,
mandolin and dobro players, and bassists. When you’re playing your banjo
with others, remember to play in a way that enhances the sound of the total
group. Active listening and playing in good rhythm play a big role in your
efforts to make other musicians sound their best.
In Chapters 3 and 12, I discuss the unique techniques and skills you need to
accompany other pickers and singers on familiar bluegrass and old-time
tunes in informal jam sessions. I also cover some of the unspoken ground
rules of jam etiquette to make your transition into group playing go smoothly.
Meeting other banjo lovers
You may be amazed at how many opportunities you have to share your
enthusiasm for the banjo with other like-minded players. From finding a
teacher to attending a workshop, camp, or festival, you can have more fun
with the instrument and become a better player faster by connecting with
others who share your enthusiasm for the banjo. As a new player, don’t wait
until you’ve already acquired some playing skills before seeking help from
others. You’ll become a better player much more quickly by seeking out help
at the very beginning of your banjo adventure. In Chapter 12, I talk about the
world of banjo that lies beyond your doorstep.
24
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

Camps and workshops are often designed for all levels of students. If you
already play, you can recharge your banjo-picking batteries at a regional
camp or workshop where you can hang out with the banjo stars, make many
new friends, and come away with new playing ideas that will keep your hands
busy for months to come.
Keeping your banjo sounding great
Banjos are much more adjustable than other stringed instruments such as
the guitar or bass. However, you don’t have to become an accomplished, all-
knowing instrument-repair person to keep your instrument in top shape.
Keeping fresh strings on your instrument is the most important thing you can
do to keep your banjo running right. After a few weeks or months of playing,
your strings will inevitably become harder to tune — or they may even break.
Keep an extra set of strings handy in your case along with a small pair of wire
cutters and you’ll be ready for all contingencies!
You may also want to check out all the movable parts on your banjo every
couple of months. For example, keeping the head tight keeps your banjo
sounding bright and loud, and checking to see that the bridge is in just the
right place on the banjo head keeps your fretted notes in tune. I cover every-
thing you need to know about these topics, as well as determining when you
need to seek out professional advice, in Chapter 11.

 Understanding banjo terms
 Sitting and standing with the banjo
 Using the left hand to fret chords
 Finding different ways to get the banjo in tune
 Reading a chord diagram
 Playing the G, D7, and C chords
You’ve brought your new banjo home and cleared a corner of the house
to practice, far enough out of the way to not disturb the unbelievers in
your household. As you sit down and open the case, that wonderful new
banjo smell fills the room. Go ahead and savor this moment! Pat yourself on
the back for taking the plunge and making the commitment to become a
banjo player. But now what?
This chapter answers that question for you. I help you liberate the banjo
from its case, attach a strap, and get comfortable holding the banjo when
you’re both sitting and standing. I show you several different ways to keep
the banjo in tune and how to work on a good left-hand position for fretting
chords. You finish up by discovering how to play the G, D7, and C chords, the
three chords you’ll play frequently in hundreds of banjo songs.
Talking Banjo Talk
As with any culture, you must be familiar with the language before you can
get to know the people. The banjo is very much the same; you need to know
banjo speak if you’re going to be a banjo player. Plus, you may find Banjo For
Dummies a little clearer if you know some of the basic terms I use throughout
this book.

So, hold on to your hat, and familiarize yourself with the following words:
 Left hand: When I give you any instructions regarding the left hand, I’m
referring to the hand you use to push the strings against the fingerboard
to make chords (you do this with the tips of your fingers, of course, not
the entire hand). You also use the left-hand fingers to create new notes
on the banjo by using slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and chokes (slide on
over to Chapter 5 to discover more about these special techniques).
 Right hand: The right hand is the hand that strikes the banjo strings.
In Banjo For Dummies, you first use the right-hand thumb to strum across
all the banjo strings, but soon enough you utilize techniques where the
right-hand thumb and the index and middle fingers each play a different
role in producing authentic right-hand banjo styles (you can find these
techniques in Chapter 4).
 Frets: The metal strips that run along the top surface of your banjo fin-
gerboard below your strings are the frets. Most banjos have 22 frets with
each fret assigned a number. The first fret is the fret that’s closest to the
nut and the 22nd fret is located the closest to the banjo head.
 Fretting: The act of pushing one or more left-hand fingers against the fin-
gerboard just behind a fret to shorten the length of a string is called 
fretting. Fretting changes the sound (or pitch) of a note. The shorter the
length of a string, the higher that string’s pitch — and the higher up the
neck you’re fretting. (For more on fretting, you can check out the section
“Fretting with the Left Hand” later in this chapter.)
 Open: You call an unfretted string an open string. In Chapter 3, you’re
introduced to tablature, the written form of banjo music. In tablature, an
open string is indicated with the number 0.
 Strings: Yeah, I know you know what strings are. But banjo players are so
methodical that they assign numbers to each string so they can talk about
them easier. Remembering the order of strings as expressed through these
numbers is crucial to understanding banjo tablature and in interpreting
a chord diagram, which is a representation of how a chord is fretted.
The 5th string is the short string on your banjo. If you’re holding the
instrument in a playing position (see the following section, “Positioning
Body and Banjo”), the 5th string is the string that is the closest as you
look down at the strings. If someone were looking at you and your banjo
from across the room, they’d say that the 5th string is the top-most string.
From the 5th string, the strings are then numbered 4, 3, 2, 1 across the
banjo. The 1st string is the farthest away from you as you look down on
the instrument (or the bottom string if someone is looking at you).
 Sharp and flat: You use these terms in reference to getting the banjo in
tune. If a note you’re playing on your banjo is sharp, its pitch is higher
than the note you’re trying to tune to; if its pitch is lower, your banjo
note is flat.
28
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

If you’re left handed, you may be tempted to turn the banjo upside down and
fret with the right hand and strike the strings with the left. However, I don’t
recommend spending much time playing in this way. The strings are then in a
different orientation to your picking hand and executing the right hand pat-
terns (that you can encounter later in this book) is physically impossible.
The bottom line is that you need both hands to play banjo well. I’m left-handed,
but I learned to play using the standard right-handed orientation. I’d like for
you to try this too — especially if you’ve already purchased a regular banjo.
Positioning Body and Banjo
Picking up a banjo and trying to play for the first time may seem a little awk-
ward if you don’t know how to hold or position the instrument. To get the most
enjoyment out of your practice time and to be ready for anything when play-
ing with others, you should be comfortable both sitting and standing while
playing the banjo. In either case, being as relaxed as possible is a good idea.
So how are you supposed to play in these positions with ease? Take a deep
breath and don’t worry — this section gives you the foundation you need to
comfortably strike a banjo player pose.
If you’ve never played banjo before, you may not be quite ready for all the
advice in this section. You may need to first become comfortable with your
left- and right-hand positions on the banjo, which I discuss later in this chap-
ter and in Chapter 4. After you have a good grasp on your hand positions, feel
free to come back to this section and devote a bit of time again to finding a
comfortable posture sitting and standing with the banjo.
Strapping on your banjo
You’ve probably already discovered that banjos can be heavy. Even if you
have a more lightweight, open-back banjo, the distribution of weight on your
banjo may very well be uneven, with much of the mass at the peghead con-
centrated where the four tuning pegs are located.
Take a moment and sit in a chair with your banjo in a playing position, with
the pot of the banjo resting on your legs and the neck extending to your
left at about a 45-degree angle. If you remove your left hand as a support,
does the neck move downward? If so, start using a strap even when sitting.
You need the left hand free to fret chords, not supporting the weight of the
banjo neck.
29
Chapter 2: Meet Your Banjo

Find a real banjo strap to use on your instrument and not a guitar strap. Both
kinds of straps look pretty much the same except for what’s at either end.
Most banjo straps have hooks, ties, or screws at both ends that you use to
attach the strap to the banjo pot. A guitar strap more often has just holes
punched into the leather or plastic at either end and nothing else — providing
no way to easily attach it to the banjo. (For more info on picking out the right
strap for you, see Chapter 10.)
Getting used to holding the banjo and working with the strap is a bit like
breaking in a brand new pair of shoes — it takes a bit of time, but soon
enough everything fits like a glove. The following sections provide all you
need to know to fit the strap on the banjo and the banjo on you.
Attaching the strap
Some inexpensive banjos have hooks on the banjo body that are designed to
hold a strap. However, these hooks usually aren’t located in a position that
provides the most comfortable support. You want to instead attach each end
of the strap to one of the brackets that encircle the banjo head.
Many players attach the strap to brackets located underneath the neck and
the tailpiece of the banjo, as shown in Figure 2-1. This position seems to pro-
vide a good deal of support and control, but you want to experiment by using
different strap lengths and brackets to see what feels right to you.
Figure 2-1:

fortable fit,
try attaching

30
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

If you attach the strap to the banjo in this way, you shouldn’t have to remove
it when you need to put the banjo away in its case. You should have plenty of
room within the case to wrap the strap around the banjo pot (see Figure 2-2).
Fitting the strap
Although some players wear the strap across the right shoulder (like the
renowned bluegrass player Kenny Ingram in the bottom photo of Figure 2-3),
most players adjust the length of the strap so that it wraps over the left
shoulder, around the back, and underneath the right arm (like banjo legend 
J. D. Crowe in the top photo of Figure 2-3).
As you fit the strap to the banjo, you need to properly adjust its length. The
length of your strap determines the vertical placement of the banjo in rela-
tion to your body. Although you can’t find any hard-and-fast rules, I like to
have just enough length to the strap so that when I sit down I can feel the
strap exerting upward pressure keeping the banjo neck in place, but I’m also
able to rest the banjo on my knees when sitting down to relieve the pressure
from the strap on my left shoulder.
After you’ve found a strap position that seems to work when sitting, try
standing up with the banjo to see how the strap feels. You need to use the
same strap length for both sitting and standing, so experiment to find a strap
fit that works well for both situations.

31
Chapter 2: Meet Your Banjo

Making three or four adjustments as you try to find the right strap position
for your banjo isn’t unusual. You may have to take the strap off the banjo
each time to adjust its length until you find what feels just right. This is a
minor hassle, but after the strap is set, you won’t have to worry about it any

more. You can then move on to playing music with a more comfortable left-
hand position.
Sitting down to play
How you hold your banjo while sitting down is determined by how much you
need to see the banjo fingerboard while you’re playing. Some players disci-
pline themselves to use the position dots on the top side of the banjo neck to
keep track of where they are on the banjo neck, but most players prefer to
actually see the banjo fingerboard.
Another aspect of finding a comfortable playing posture is to experiment
with different neck angles (the banjo neck that is, not your neck!). New play-
ers are often so concerned with seeing the fingerboard that they raise the
neck to bring it closer to their eyes. Too much of this can lead to some tech-
nique problems in both the left and right hands. My advice is to angle the
neck such that the peghead is no higher than eye level.
You also want to find a chair around the house that allows you to comfort-
ably sit upright, provides you with some back support (if you need it), and
allows your arms to move freely (no recliners allowed unfortunately). Around
the house, I like to use an adjustable office chair with the side arms removed.
As you sit, position the banjo so that you’re able to see the fingerboard and
the banjo head, but don’t let the banjo be so low that you have to reach far
around the neck to fret with the left hand.
After you’ve actually started to play banjo, take a look at photos of some of
your favorite players and experiment with different neck angles and chair posi-
tions to see what works the best for you. Figure 2-4 shows three different ways
of holding the banjo while sitting. Note that the middle player, Jody Stecher,
rests the banjo on his right knee and doesn’t need a strap at all. Erin English
(left) and yours truly (right) prefer straps on our heavier resonator banjos.

Chapter 2: Meet Your Banjo

Standing with your banjo
The key to being comfortable while standing with the banjo is to adopt a
position that’s similar to the position you use when sitting. If you’ve found a
good sitting position (see the preceding section), stand up with the banjo and
watch what happens. Try adjusting the strap length so that you have little
to no change in the position of the banjo for both your sitting and standing
positions.
Note also the relationship of your hands to the instrument as you both sit
and stand. You want these to be as close as possible to one another whether
you’re up or down. Keep your arms relaxed and your elbows bent while
standing and remember not to raise the peghead above eye level. Your left
hand should easily be able to fret at any point along the banjo fingerboard,
and your right hand should have easy access for striking the strings.
Figure 2-5 shows three different ways of standing while playing banjo. Erin
(on the left) holds the banjo a little lower and off to the side of her body.
Jody (in the middle) angles the banjo neck a little higher and holds the banjo
a bit more off to the side while yours truly (on the right) holds the banjo
higher on the body and more out in front. All are fine ways to take a stand for
better playing.
I spend almost all my time practicing sitting down and even though I’ve been
playing for over 35 years, I still have to make a subtle mental adjustment
every time I stand up to play. A day or two before a performance, I devote a
share of my practice time to playing standing up so that I’ll feel more com-
fortable playing with others on stage. At a bluegrass festival, you spend a
good deal of your time standing in a circle of musicians at jam sessions, so
practicing while standing up is a great idea every now and then (and don’t
forget to bring a comfortable pair of shoes to wear to your next festival!).

Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 
Don’t let “Dunlap’s disease” get you down
If you’re in the prime years of your life like me,
you may suffer from Dunlap’s disease. What’s
that, you innocently ask? Well, Dunlap’s disease
is when your belly is so big that it “done laps”
over your belt! If you suffer from this common
malady, you may prefer to position the banjo a
bit to the right side of your body, whether sitting
or standing (see the section “Standing with your
banjo” in this chapter). Many players position
the banjo squarely on their right knee and may
not need a strap to support the banjo at all while
sitting. When standing with a strap, you want to
position the banjo in a similar way at the right
side of your body. If you’re a Dunlapper like me,
don’t be afraid to move your banjo around until
you find a position comfortable for you.

Fretting with the Left Hand
The left hand’s job is to change the pitches of the banjo strings to get all the
notes you need for chords and melodies. The left hand accomplishes this
task by pressing the tips of the fingers against the fingerboard just behind a
fret, as needed, to shorten the length of a string and make its pitch higher.
This technique is called fretting.
Fretting individual strings and chords on the banjo is a breeze after you’ve
adopted these few simple tips for properly attaching the left hand to your
banjo neck. Here’s a step-by-step guide:
1. Rest your left hand on your leg and totally release all body tension
from your hand and arm, just as if you were asleep (see Figure 2-6a).
Your hand should assume a relaxed shape in which all the fingers are
slightly bent in towards your palm.
2. Keeping the wrist relaxed but straight, place the left-hand thumb on
the upper part of the back of the banjo neck, opposite the space
between the first and second frets (see Figure 2-6b).
Remember not to support the weight of the neck with the left hand and
try to keep your hand and fingers relaxed, as in Step 1.
3. Relax your shoulder, arm, and elbow, bringing your elbow down and
in towards your body and causing your left-hand fingers to position
themselves more directly over the banjo fingerboard.

4. Move your left-hand middle finger just behind the second fret of the
3rd string and push down on the string, fretting it with the tip of your
finger (see Figure 2-6c).
Don’t fret on top of the second fret but position the finger as close
behind the fret as you can. Try to maintain a vertical position with the
fretting finger so that the adjacent strings are able to ring freely.
5. Try playing the 3rd string with the thumb of your right hand.
The goal is to get a clear, ringing sound out of the note you’ve just fret-
ted with no buzzing.
If the new note sounds good, congratulations! You’ve accomplished the first
necessary task to becoming a great banjo player, and you’re now officially
playing the banjo!

36
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

Now lift up the fretting finger and play the open (or unfretted) 3rd string with
your right-hand thumb. As you lift the fretting finger, don’t bring it too far up
above the string; position your finger just above the string so that you’re
ready to fret again. Now fret the 3rd string again at the second fret and strike
the string with the right-hand thumb to check for clarity. Alternate between
the open and fretted positions until the movement of your left-hand finger
becomes second nature.
Remaining relaxed while fretting is important, so every now and then, do a
quick mental check to make sure your arm, elbow, and hand are as comfort-
able as possible. However, creating tension by using too much pressure with
the left-hand fingers when fretting isn’t unusual for new players. You want to
use as much fretting pressure as it takes, but no more.
You can find out just how much pressure you need by placing a finger in a
fretted position, just barely touching the string. Now gradually apply more
pressure on the string with the left-hand finger, striking it repeatedly with the
right hand as you go. You literally hear the sound come into focus as you fret.
After you’ve passed the threshold where the sound is clear, note how much
pressure you’re applying with the left-hand finger. If you’re like most people,
you may be surprised at how little effort it takes to cleanly fret with the left-
hand fingers.
If you want to check out some more advanced left-hand techniques such as
the slide, hammer-on, pull-off, and choke, turn to Chapter 5 with your right
hand as soon as possible.
Tuning Up
Question: “What’s the difference between a banjo and a motorcycle?”
Answer: “You can tune a motorcycle.”
This unfortunate but frequently recited banjo joke speaks to a greater truth:
Many banjo players are a bit lazy in their tuning habits.
Playing in good tune is an absolutely necessary component to becoming a
socially acceptable banjo player. You simply have to know how to tune the
banjo to itself so you can practice at home without driving your loved ones
insane. And when the time has come to start making music with others, those
around you will be thankful that you took the time to figure out how to get
your banjo in tune with other instruments.
37
Chapter 2: Meet Your Banjo

To tune the banjo, you raise or lower the amount of tension of each string to
match the sound of another banjo string or to match a reference note pro-
vided by another instrument or an electronic tuner. You adjust each string by
turning its corresponding tuning peg. In this section, you discover what it
means for your banjo to be in tune, and I introduce you to several different
methods to tune your banjo.
Like all other elements of banjo playing, tuning is a skill that gets easier with
practice and the passage of time. Being able to distinguish one note from
another isn’t a mysterious psychic ability that you either are or aren’t born
with — tuning is a learned skill. No excuses! Keep actively listening to how
the sounds of the strings change as you turn the pegs. Don’t be afraid to ask
others for advice if you’re unsure about whether or not a string is in tune.
G tuning: Getting your strings in order
Although banjo players use a variety of tunings to play different kinds of
songs and to create different moods on their instrument, the most frequently
used tuning is called G tuning (which is also the type of tuning I use in this
book). With this tuning, the five open strings of the banjo are tuned to the
notes of a G major chord (a chord is a collection of three or more notes
played together; I talk more about chords in Chapter 3).
Here are the pitches used for each string in G tuning:
 5th string: G
 4th string: D
 3rd string: G
 2nd string: B
 1st string: D
Note that only three different pitches are used in G tuning: G, B, and D.
These three notes make up the G major chord. The 1st-string D and 5th-string
G are one octave higher in pitch than their 4th- and 3rd-string counterparts.
Your ears hear the two D notes and the two G notes as being essentially the
same, but you can also hear that the 1st and 5th strings are higher in pitch.
Musicians long ago decided to assign the same letter name to pitches that
you hear in this way, but they also recognized that the two D’s and the two
G’s aren’t exactly the same pitch. They’re one octave apart, with the octave
being the point where that same note is repeated again but at a higher pitch.
38
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

Figure 2-7 shows the pitches of each string in G tuning along with a fretboard
image summarizing the relative tuning relationships between the strings
(which I cover in the next section).
Relative tuning: Tuning the banjo to itself
Relative tuning involves using one string as a reference to tune the other
strings of your banjo. That string doesn’t really have to be in tune with any
outside source, because in this case, you’re just getting the banjo strings in
tune with one another so that you can play by yourself.
With each new string you tune in relative tuning, you then fret that string to
create a new reference note that you use to tune the next highest string.
Relative tuning is the most useful way to tune the banjo, because you need
nothing but your banjo and your ears to get your instrument in tune.
You’ve got a banjo, now you can get to work on training your ears!
Even pro players follow up on their initial pass at relative tuning by trying 
different pairs of strings to hear what they sound like together and tuning
the adjacent pairs of strings a second time. If one or more strings are
severely out of tune to begin with, you definitely need to repeat the
processes I describe in the following sections once or twice until the banjo
is in good tune.

Chapter 2: Meet Your Banjo

From low to high
When tuning from low to high, you begin with the lowest-pitched 4th string
and work your way up to the 5th string, the highest-pitched string. Using the
following instructions, tune the remaining four strings up from the 4th string,
using the left-hand middle finger to fret each reference note. For now, try
striking (or picking) each string with a downward motion from your right-
hand thumb.
1. Pick the 4th string fretted at the fifth fret and compare its pitch to the
open 3rd string.
You may need to strike the fretted 4th string first, wait a moment to hear
its pitch, and then strike the 3rd string to listen to its pitch. Does the
3rd string (the second note you play) sound higher or lower than the
4th string? Try singing the two pitches to feel whether the pitch rises
or falls.
2. If the open 3rd string sounds higher in pitch, the string is sharp, and
you want to adjust the tuning peg for that string in the direction that
brings its pitch down (usually clockwise for most banjos). If the 3rd
string is lower in pitch, that string is flat; in this case, rotate the peg in
the direction that causes the pitch of the string to rise (counterclock-
wise for most instruments).
When the pitches of the two strings match each other, the 4th and 3rd
strings of your banjo are in tune.
3. Pick the 3rd string fretted at the fourth fret and match the open 2nd
string to this sound.
You use the same process as Step 2. After these strings sound the same,
you have the 4th, 3rd, and 2nd strings of your banjo in tune.
4. Pick the 2nd string fretted at the third fret and tune the open 1st
string to this sound.
On most banjos, you turn the tuning pegs on the 2nd and 1st strings in
the opposite direction than you did for the 4th- and 3rd-string pegs.
Turning the pegs of the 1st and 2nd strings clockwise should raise the
string’s pitch, and turning counterclockwise should lower it.
5. Pick the 1st string fretted at the fifth fret and tune the open 5th string
to this sound.
Remember that the 5th string is the short string on your banjo that’s 
situated on the opposite side of your 1st string. Some banjos have 5th
string tuning pegs that are difficult to turn without causing wild fluctua-
tions in pitch. Don’t worry if it takes a bit more time to get the 5th string
in tune.

Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

Even if you follow my instructions carefully, I’m sure that you may discover the
following frustrations when tuning the banjo in this way (but don’t “fret” —
you aren’t alone):
 Your reference point is always a fretted string when tuning from a
lower- to higher-pitched string. You need to lift the left hand up to
adjust the tuning peg of the string you’re attempting to tune and then
fret it again on the lower string to play the reference pitch. 
 If you make a slight error at the beginning of this process, that mistake
is exaggerated as you proceed to try and tune the rest of the strings.
You may have to start all over.
From high to low
Similar to the instructions from the preceding section, you can also tune your
banjo by starting with the highest-pitched string (the 5th string) and moving
down to the lowest-pitched 4th string. If you tune the banjo in this way, the
string you’re trying to get in tune is also the string that you’re fretting. The
open string is now your reference point.
For example, you can use the 5th-string G as a reference note to tune the 1st-
string D. However, this time around, you fret the 1st string at the fifth fret to
match it to the pitch of the open-5th string. You have to now lift your fretting
hand off of the 1st string to turn the first string’s tuning peg and then refret
again at the fifth fret until the both strings’ pitches are matched. 
If you’re having difficulty determining whether a string is sharp or flat, tune it
down until the string is obviously below the pitch of your reference note.
Then gradually bring the string you’re trying to get in tune up in pitch to
match the reference note.
Reference tuning: Getting 
a little outside help
Relative tuning is great when you’re playing by yourself or to use as a quick
touch up to a string or two in the middle of a practice session. However,
when playing with others (or with the CD that accompanies this book), you
need to get accustomed to tuning your banjo using one or more outside refer-
ence notes as provided by an electronic tuner, a CD, or another instrument. I
show you how to tune by using reference notes in the following sections.
41
Chapter 2: Meet Your Banjo

If you’re practicing on your own, it doesn’t matter from where you get your
reference pitches — the important thing is to have the banjo in tune with
itself. If you’re playing with others, everyone should use the same reference
pitch, whether it’s coming from an electronic tuner or an instrument.
Utilizing an electronic tuner
Tuners provide a reference for you to tune individual strings, played one at a
time. When you play a string, the tuner “hears” the note and gives an indication
of the note’s pitch by showing a letter name for the note closest to it in pitch,
with an accompanying # (sharp) or % (flat) sign, if needed (for instance, if the
note you’re playing is closest to an F# in pitch, the tuner reads F#). The tuner
also indicates whether your string is sharp (too high) or flat (too low) to your
reference note via a meter or a row of small LED lights. (Check out Chapter 10
for a discussion of how tuners work and of the different types of tuners cur-
rently available.) An electronic clip-on tuner is shown in Figure 2-8.
If the string is significantly out of tune, the tuner may assign an alphabet
letter that isn’t a G, B, or D (check out the section “G tuning: Getting your
strings in order” earlier in this chapter for the skinny on the notes used in
this tuning). I’ve been avoiding it up to now, but so you aren’t thrown off by
these various letters, you should know the following order of notes in music:
G / G# or A% / A / A# or B% / B / C / C# or D% / D / D# or E% / E / F / F# or G% / G

Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

Here are a few tidbits of info that may help you better understand this series
of notes and how they relate to tuning your banjo:
 You may notice that some notes in the preceding series have an or
between them. Without getting too boring, just remember that a G# is the
same pitch as an A%, an A# is the same as B%, and so on. These equivalent
notes are found at the same fret on your fingerboard.
 As you move to the right in the order of notes, you’re naming higher-
pitched notes; as you move to the left, the notes are lower pitched. If
you move one note in either direction (for instance, going from a C# or D%
note to a D note), you move a half step. If you move two notes in either
direction (for instance, going from an F to a G or from a C to a D), you
move a whole step.
A half-step movement corresponds to a change of one fret up or down
on your banjo fingerboard, and a whole step equals a movement of two
frets from one note to the next. For example, if you’re playing an open
string and you want to move up a half step, you would fret the first fret
of that same string. If you wanted to move up a whole step from an open
string, you would fret the second fret.
To use an electronic tuner, you turn the tuning pegs until the readout
matches the note that string should match. For example, if you’re trying to
tune your 3rd string to a G and the tuner gives you an F# reading, you know
from the preceding order of notes that your 3rd string is far enough below a
G pitch that the tuner hears the note as an F# — the pitch that’s one half step
below G.
To get your 3rd string in tune, continue striking the 3rd string with the right
hand and slowly move the tuning peg to raise the string’s pitch. At some
point, the tuner’s readout should change from an F# to a G note, but at this
point the tuner tells you that your 3rd string is a flat G note instead of a sharp
F#. Continue raising the pitch of the string until the tuner indicates that the
string is exactly in tune to a G note. You use the same process for each of the
strings, raising or lowering their pitches until the tuner indicates that you’ve
reached the desired note.
Don’t strike the strings too hard when using an electronic tuner. A light touch
is best for the tuner to give the most reliable reading. Also, the meter on
some tuners shifts slightly to the left or right as it responds to ever-so-slight
changes in pitch that occur as a string continues to vibrate. If this happens to
you, tune the string to the pitch that the indicator “sits on” for the majority of
the time that the tuner is registering its pitch. This approximation gets you
close enough to do a touch up on that string by using relative-tuning tech-
niques (see the previous section on this topic for instructions).
43
Chapter 2: Meet Your Banjo

Tuning with an electronic tuner at a jam session
When musicians come together to make music, they first take some time to
make sure that their instruments are in tune with one another before they
start to play. Just before a jam session begins, you may see musicians off in
different corners or with their backs turned momentarily from the main
group, as they get in tune by using electronic clip-on tuners (see preceding
section for the how-to). In this case, the participants use the reference notes
provided by their tuners to get as closely in tune with each other as they can
(and if the participants have their backs turned because they’re talking to
their agents, find another jam session!).
Don’t hesitate to borrow another musician’s tuner whenever you need one in
a group session. Believe me — everyone wants you to be in tune just as much
as you do!
If your jam session is taking place outside, as often happens at a music festi-
val, chances are good that all the instruments gradually drift out of absolute
tuning in reaction to the sun, the humidity, and the warm temperatures. If you’re
joining a jam session that’s already in progress, the musicians may be in tune
with each other but not with your tuner. In these situations, get a reference
pitch from another instrumentalist and tune your banjo, using the relative
tuning techniques outlined earlier in this chapter (I describe how to do this
in the next few sections).
Using another instrument as a reference
If you don’t have an electronic tuner or you want to be in tune with others in
a jam session, you can use pitches from other instruments to get your banjo
where it needs to be. In general, ask another musician to play a certain note
on her instrument. Then, try to get your string to match that pitch by turning
the tuning pegs. After tuning each open string to the corresponding note, you
can then double-check your tuning by using relative tuning techniques (see
the section on this topic earlier in this chapter).
Don’t be surprised if the instrument you’re using isn’t exactly in tune with an
electronic tuner. Remember that you aren’t aiming for perfect pitch at this
point, but rather, you’re wanting your banjo to be in tune with itself and with
others you may be playing with.

Promote world peace: Use a banjo mute!
If you’re one of those folks who live in a
crowded household or a college dorm or if you
have to catch your practice time late at night or
very early in the morning, you need to find a way
to ramp down the volume of your banjo. Try
these quick solutions to temporarily tame your
savage banjo beast:

45
Chapter 2: Meet Your Banjo
 Place a mute on the bridge. A banjo mute
fits onto the top of your banjo bridge and
soaks up the musical energy that the bridge
normally transmits from a vibrating string to
the banjo head. (See photo a in the accom-
panying figure.) Mutes dramatically reduce
your banjo’s volume and can change the
tone quite a bit too, lending a sweet sustain-
ing sound to your banjo that makes it sound
almost like a harpsichord. You can buy a
banjo mute at an acoustic specialty store
(but don’t let them talk you into believing
that a ball-peen hammer is a real mute —
that’s a more permanent solution!). In lieu of
a store-bought mute, you can also use a
couple of clothespins, snapped to either
end of the bridge (shown in photo b). This
solution works just about as well!
 Just stuff it! Cram a hand towel or a T-shirt
into the back of the banjo, in the space
between the head and the closest coordi-
nating rod (shown in photo c). If your banjo
has a resonator, you need to remove it first
to get to the back of your instrument. The
more firmly you position the cloth against
the underside of the head, the more it
absorbs the energy of the head and the qui-
eter your banjo will become.

Here’s how you can use various instruments to tune your banjo:
 Guitar or dobro: The 4th (D), 3rd (G), and 2nd (B) strings of the guitar
are tuned to the same pitches as the corresponding strings in G tuning
on the banjo (see the section on G tuning earlier in this chapter for more
info). The dobro’s top four strings are tuned to the same pitches as the
top four strings on your banjo, so you can use these instruments as ref-
erence points to tune your banjo.
I usually try to tune my 3rd-string G first, and then I move down in pitch
to tune the 4th string and up to tune the 2nd, 1st, and 5th strings. When I
have a break in between songs, I ask the guitar or dobro player to play a
3rd string open, or the fretted equivalent if she has a capo on, so I can
make sure my banjo is in tune with the other instruments. If I’m out of
tune, I make adjustments on each string until my strings’ pitches match
the pitches on the guitar or dobro.
 Piano: If you have a piano or an electronic keyboard around the house,
that’s another great source for getting reference notes to tune your
banjo. Tune each banjo string to the corresponding piano note (see
Figure 2-9).
 Fiddle or mandolin: If you’re playing music with just a fiddler or a 
mandolin player, you can still get in tune with them by asking for their
G note. A fiddle is tuned to the same pitches as a mandolin. The open G
notes on these instruments are an octave higher in pitch than your 
3rd-string G.
However, you can still use this note to tune your G string, and then you
can tune your remaining strings using relative tuning techniques or you
can ask for the other pitches you need to get the other strings in tune
(see the section “Relative tuning: Tuning the banjo to itself” earlier in
this chapter for more help).

Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

The tone of the other instrumentalist’s notes are going to be different than
the notes on the banjo, but remember you’re comparing the pitch of each
note, not the tone. When in doubt about your own tuning, don’t hesitate to
ask another musician for help.
Enlisting the help of this book’s CD
Last but not least, you can pop the CD that’s in the back of the book into a CD
player and proceed directly to Track 1, where I name and play all the open
strings on the banjo in G tuning. These pitches should be very close to what
you’d get when using an electronic tuner (for more on these techie tuners,
check out the section “Utilizing an electronic tuner”).
Checking Out Chord Diagrams
Looking for an easy way to remember how to fret a chord with your left-hand
fingers? A chord diagram not only communicates which strings are fretted for
a particular chord but also where on the fingerboard you put those fingers
and which left-hand finger you use to fret each string.
Chord diagrams aren’t the same as banjo tablature, which is the written form
of banjo music that I explain in Chapter 3. Chord diagrams show you how to
fret a chord with the left hand, but they don’t tell you what to play with it.
However, when you play with others, you use chords all the time. Chords are
also the basic building blocks of just about every melody, so getting comfort-
able reading chord diagrams is a good idea, which is just what I intend to
help you do in the following sections.
Reading a chord diagram
If you’re already familiar with reading chord diagrams for the guitar, you find
that banjo players use the same system. If you turn your banjo around so
that the fingerboard faces you, that’s how the banjo neck is represented in a
chord diagram (check out Figure 2-10 to more fully break down the parts of a
chord diagram):
 From left to right, the vertical lines represent the 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st
strings on your banjo. Most banjo chord diagrams don’t include the 5th
string, because you rarely fret it, especially when you’re just beginning
to play.
 The top horizontal line represents the banjo nut. The nut is what guides
the strings from the fingerboard to the peghead. One way to think of the
nut is as a “0” fret, because your banjo strings are open at this location
on the neck.
47
Chapter 2: Meet Your Banjo

 The second line from the top stands for your banjo’s first fret, and the
line below that represents the second fret, and so on.
 The black dots that appear on the vertical string lines indicate behind
what fret and on what strings on the banjo fingerboard you should fret.
 The letters located underneath the chord diagram indicate the left-hand
finger you use to fret each string. For the left hand, I = index finger; M =
middle finger; R = ring finger; and P (or sometimes L) = ring finger. Some
books use the numbers 1 through 4 to represent the left-hand fingers in
the same way.
Interpreting up-the-neck chord diagrams
As you become more proficient, you can fret chords all up and down the neck
of your banjo. To represent a chord that’s played above the fifth fret, a chord
diagram includes a number that appears to the right of the diagram — either
next to the top fret line or adjacent to the uppermost fretted note in the chord.
This number indicates exactly where you need to position your left hand on
the banjo neck (see Figure 2-11).
If you need to fret the 5th string as part of a chord, a fifth vertical line is
added to the left side of the chord diagram to represent this string. The 5th
string is often fretted up the neck with the left-hand thumb, which is repre-
sented with the letter T in a chord diagram.

Fingering G, D7, and C Chords
The first time you discover how to fret a chord on your banjo is a very big
moment in your burgeoning playing career. If the world suddenly seems like a
much better place after you’ve successfully fretted each of the chords in this
section, that’s a good indication that you were born to be a banjo player.
Figure 2-12 shows chord diagrams for the three most important chords you
play on the banjo: the G, D7, and C chords.
After you practice the chords as described in the next three sections, try
moving from one chord to the next, in any order that strikes your fancy.
Strum with a downward right-hand thumb motion across all five strings a few
times for each new chord and strive for a clear, unmuted sound from each
string for all three chords. This stuff is pretty exciting, isn’t it? Take a listen 
to Track 2 on the CD to see whether your chords sound like the ones that I
demonstrate. You can put these chords to use in Chapter 3.

Chapter 2: Meet Your Banjo

Try to keep the tips of your left-hand fingers close to the neck and pointed
towards the fingerboard at all times as you move from one chord to the next.
At first, you may have to move one left-hand fretting finger at a time as you
work the different chord fingerings into your motor memory. However, in the
long run, fretting all the strings you need for a chord at the same time is more
efficient. After you’ve mastered this skill, you can switch between chords
with greater speed and accuracy.
The G chord: Real easy
Although people very seldom associate the banjo with Zen, you really don’t
have to fret anything at all to play the G chord, grasshopper! A G chord is just
the sound of your right hand strumming the open strings in G tuning (see the
section “G tuning: Getting your strings in order” earlier in this chapter for
more info). That’s why this chord diagram includes no black dots at all —
your five open strings do all the work! You could use your left hand to wave
to your adoring fans, but I think it may be a little early for these kinds of
grand gestures.
The D7 chord: A little harder
For the D7 chord, you place your middle finger just behind the second fret
of the 3rd string and your index finger behind the first fret of the 2nd string.
Try strumming down across all five strings with your right-hand thumb, start-
ing with the 5th string and striking each note down to the 1st string. Try a
slow strum to check the accuracy of your fretting on each individual string,
but then don’t be afraid to go wild with some fast strumming to strut your
stuff!
The C chord: More challenging still
The C chord is a bit harder than the D7 chord (see preceding section), because
you use one more left-hand finger to fret this chord. Here, the left-hand index
frets the 2nd string, first fret — just as with the D7 chord. However, now you
move your middle finger to the 4th string, second fret, and you also need to
fret the 1st string at the second fret. Be careful that you fret the 4th and 2nd
strings with enough of a vertical angle with your left-hand fingers so you
don’t block the sound of the open 3rd string.

 Understanding the basic parts of a song
 Deciphering banjo tablature
 Figuring out pinch patterns
 Becoming a good group player
I
f you’ve worked through Chapter 2, your banjo is in tune and you’re com-
fortable fretting a few chords, so you’re just about ready to play some real
music. For most new banjo players, going from learning a chord or two to
actually playing an entire song is a pretty big leap.
In this chapter, I cover everything you need to know to make this transition
as easy and painless as possible. You’ll soon be strumming along with songs
and be well on your way to having more fun with the banjo than you ever
thought possible!
This chapter unlocks the mystery of playing music by helping you under-
stand two of the basic building blocks of a song: rhythm and chord progres-
sions. You also become acquainted with banjo tablature, the written form of
music for the banjo, and you discover a great way to accompany others using
something called the pinch pattern. This chapter also examines the different
roles that the banjo takes in a band and helps you understand how to be a
cooperative team player when playing music with others.
You can return to the tools and skills covered in this chapter each time you
work on a new song or take out your banjo to join in a jam session.

Breaking Down the Parts of a Song
How is it that some banjo players can play along with just about any song
that comes up, even something that they’ve never heard before? I can tell you
from personal experience that you aren’t simply born with this skill — it’s
something that’s nurtured. Songs are like roadmaps, and if you can follow the
signposts correctly, you eventually make your way through just about any
bluegrass or old-time tune. The more songs you learn, the more you can get
around Banjo Town without getting lost.
Although every song has something that makes it different from any other
song (even if it’s just the title!), most bluegrass and old-time songs share
many of the same underlying musical characteristics. If you understand how
songs are put together, you have a much easier time getting started down the
road to becoming a great banjo player.
Songs are made up of rhythm, chord progressions, and melodies. However, at
this first stage of playing, your goal is to play a song by strumming the correct
chords in the proper rhythm, which is what I cover in the following sections;
you can worry about playing melodies a little later (see Chapter 6 to begin to
unlock this mystery).
Rhythm: Catching the beat
One of the things that separates music from random noise is that time is
organized (in some way) within a piece of music. When talking about music,
rhythm can refer to several different things: You can refer to the rhythm of a
particular musician or band (as in “That banjo player really plays with a lot of
drive!” or “I think those guys’ rhythm needs some work!”) or the rhythm of a
particular piece of music (“I like that song — it’s really bouncy!”). For now, I
use the word rhythm to refer collectively to all the different aspects of music
that have to do with time and duration.
The most important aspect of playing the banjo well — both as a beginner and
as an advanced player — is to play with good rhythm. Although your biggest
worry at first may be about fretting chords and hitting the right strings (see
Chapters 2 and 4 on these topics), you eventually want to put a lot of effort
into playing a song all the way through in a steady rhythm without stopping —
no matter what! Playing without stopping is especially important when playing
music with others or along with the CD that accompanies this book. If you
start to work on this skill right now at the earliest stages of your playing, you
can soon be comfortable playing songs with others, even as a beginner.
54
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

Rhythm is something that everyone is born with — it’s in the steady pulse of
your heartbeat and in the measured cadence of your steps as you walk. If you
can keep a steady beat or pulse by tapping your foot or clapping your hands,
you’ve got rhythm. You can apply that natural sense of rhythm to playing
songs on the banjo.
On the other hand, finding the rhythm in music may not be natural for 
everyone. If you struggle finding the rhythm of a song, you can break down
the elements of rhythm, and you can practice to keep pace with any song.
I get you started in the following sections by introducing a few key terms
you need to know. However, I’m with Pete Seeger who once wrote that he’s
willing to learn just enough formal music to get by as long as it didn’t hurt his
banjo playing, so I cover only a few terms that all musicians use to talk about
rhythm in music — and I guarantee you won’t lose any self-respect as a banjo
player in the process.
55
Chapter 3: Playing by the Rules: Not Enough Theory to Hurt 
To count or not to count: It’s all in your head
Have you ever watched the feet of your favorite
musicians while they’re playing on stage or in a
jam session? Even though they may actually be
playing in perfect time together, musicians often
don’t tap their feet in the same rhythm or even in
a way that has any discernable relationship to
the beat of the music.
What’s with that? The answer lies in the fact that
what you’re seeing in all the fancy irregular foot-
work isn’t necessarily how a musician is keeping
time. Musicians often count out the rhythm just
before starting a piece to give the other players an
idea of the tempo, but after a song has started and
everyone is playing along, most musicians rely
on their internal sense of rhythm by listening to
what’s happening around them while simultane-
ously keeping track of the rhythm in their heads.
Most musicians don’t keep an actual count going
after a song has started, but they do actively keep
track of the tempo and where the beat falls.
Although most people (even beginning banjo
players like you) can establish a consistent beat
in their heads, keeping that beat going while
trying to play banjo is usually more difficult.
That’s when a good outside source for keeping
the beat can come in handy. A metronome, a
device that keeps a steady beat for you, is a
great way to play in good rhythm when practic-
ing by yourself (see Chapter 10 for a discussion
of how to play with the metronome).
However, when playing with others, keeping
good time is everyone’s shared responsibility.
Listening and adjusting to the rhythm of the
other musicians as you play is just as important
— if not more important — than following the
beat you’ve established in your head. Keep one
ear on what others are playing and the other
one on your own picking, and you’ll soon be
playing all your music in good time!

Beats, tempo, and meter
I use the term beat to refer to a musical unit of measure. To understand what
a beat is, try singing one of your favorite songs and tapping your foot in
rhythm to your singing. For example, the song “Will the Circle Be Unbroken”
would sound like this (try tapping your foot with each capitalized syllable
and tap indication): “WILL the CIR-CLE [tap] BE un-BRO-KEN [tap], BY and 
BY LORD BY [tap] and BY [tap] [tap].” Each foot tap is a beat. In all the
music you play, each beat is equal in duration to every other beat.
Check out the words to the old favorite “Red River Valley” on Track 3 of the
CD (Tab 3-1). You can see slash marks above the lyrics, which indicate where
the main beats occur. Try singing along with the CD, clapping on these beats
as indicated.

The idea of playing along with a steady beat is central to good banjo playing.
The word tempo refers to how fast you’re tapping (or clapping or playing)
that beat. Although classical musicians use a lot of fancy Italian words such
as presto, largo, and fuselli to refer to different tempos (okay, fuselli is actually
the name of a pasta), banjo players use terminology such as slow, fast, real
fast, and really, really fast. Most of the time, banjo players actually just start
playing at whatever tempo feels right, and everyone else joins in when
they’ve grabbed hold of that steady beat.
You can organize beats into groups of two, three, or four beats for most banjo
music (and if you’re playing Irish music, you sometimes group beats into
units of six and even nine beats). Musicians use the word meter to refer to
any recurring cycle of beats. 
Time signatures, measures, and downbeats
A time signature indicates the meter and the kind of count you use for a par-
ticular song. The time signature usually appears at the very beginning of a
written piece of music and is shown as two numbers positioned one on top 
of the other (like a fraction without the horizontal line). As you can see in
Figure 3-1, the top number in the time signature indicates the number of
beats in a cycle, while the bottom number stands for the kind of note that
equals one beat.
Just like the song in Figure 3-1, 4/4 time (spoken “four-four time”) is the meter
used most frequently in printed music for bluegrass and old-time banjo music.
With this time signature, you have four beats in each cycle and a quarter note
equals one beat (I discuss note values a little later in this chapter). The count
that goes along with this time signature is “one-two-three-four, one-two-three-
four,” and so on. Most waltz-time banjo music is in 3/4 time with three beats
per cycle and a quarter note signifies one beat. The count that goes with 3/4
time is “one-two-three, one-two-three.”

Chapter 3: Playing by the Rules: Not Enough Theory to Hurt 

A measure (or bar) marks off a single rhythmic cycle. In written music, a mea-
sure is indicated by a vertical line that extends through the staff. In banjo 
tablature, the staff consists of five horizontal lines that represent the five
strings of your banjo (more on reading tablature later in this chapter).
The first beat of each measure is called the downbeat. The downbeat of each
measure is usually emphasized when counting but isn’t necessarily played
louder. The initial downbeat (the first beat of the first full measure of a song)
is an important moment when you’re playing with other musicians, because
that’s usually the time when the other players join in. When it comes time to
change chords in a song, you most often (but not always) move to the new
chord on a downbeat of a new measure.
Chord progressions: Playing 
your first songs
The chord progression of a song is the part of your musical road map that
indicates what chords you play, in what sequence these chords occur, and
how long each chord lasts before you move on to play the next one as you
play a song. Although you can find about as many different chord progres-
sions as you can songs, you can count on some predictability in how chords
follow one another in most songs you play on the banjo, making figuring out
and remembering new chord progressions easier as you encounter them in a
new piece.
Many songs use only the G, C, and D7 chords (which I present in Chapter 2).
However, the more chords you know, the more quickly you can play along
with new songs. 
You want to become familiar with the chord progression of a new song just as
soon as you begin to work on it. The chord progression not only lays out the
form of the piece, but also provides the foundation you use later on for playing
(and remembering!) the melody and for improvising. The chord progression
is also what keeps everyone on the same page as you play a song with others
in a jam session. In this situation, everyone plays through the chord progres-
sion repeatedly until all the players agree that it’s time for the song to come
to an end.
A little musical knowledge need not be a dangerous thing. The time has come
to put all these concepts and terms to work as you play your first piece.
You’re now on the entrance ramp to the banjo interstate!
58
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

Progressing from chord to chord
When you’re working through a chord progression, try strumming with an
even downward motion of your thumb across all five strings of the banjo,
striking all five strings in an even sweeping motion with the thumb. In the
next few chapters, you find more interesting things to play as you accompany
a tune, but for now, strumming is just fine! You’re working on the crucial new
skill of changing chords in the left hand without losing the beat with your
strumming in the right hand, which takes a lot of coordination! If you don’t
get it at first, simply take your time and keep trying.
Take a look at “Red River Valley” (Tab 3-2). In this example, I’ve added a tab
staff, a time signature, measures, a chord progression (indicated above the staff)
and the song’s lyrics (indicated below the staff). You can hear the strumming
on Track 4 of the CD.

The time signature to this piece is 4/4, which means that every measure
has four beats. This piece has sixteen measures all together. The chord pro-
gression to “Red River Valley” consists of six measures of G, two measures
of D, two measures of G, two measures of C, two measures of D, and two 
measures of G.
Note that in this particular tune, the chords change at the start of a new mea-
sure. I’ve also added a label to show where the downbeat occurs. Note that
you don’t start “Red River Valley” on this downbeat. Your first strum and
your singing begin at beat three of the preceding measure. This happens a lot
when beginning a song, so no need to worry!
Your assignment (should you decide to accept it) is to play the chords to
“Red River Valley” with two right-hand strums per measure on the first and
third beats of each measure (the stress marks indicate a strum). You can also
listen or play along to this song on the CD, Track 4.
Changing chords quickly
Most new players find that the hardest part of strumming along to a song like
“Red River Valley” (see Tab 3-2) is going from the G to the C chords smoothly
without interrupting the right-hand strums. When you run into difficulties at
a particular point in any song, try to isolate that problem and practice it over
and over again.
60
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 
Smooth sailing
Trying to get the feel for a new song isn’t always
the easiest of tasks; however, here are a few
practice tips that you can use when you begin
any new song:
 Don’t worry about speed when learning a
new song; just try to keep the strums steady
and fret each chord as cleanly as you can
(for more on fretting, see Chapter 2).
 Listen to the CD track first to get an idea of
what the song or technique is supposed to
sound like, then try practicing it on your own.
Finally, try playing along with the CD track.
 Try to memorize the chord progression as
quickly as you can. This will free up your
visual attention to look at your amazing left
hand fretting maneuvers instead of your
eyes being tied to the written music.
 Don’t worry about singing while you’re play-
ing - but if you eventually feel comfortable
doing this, by all means go for it!

For example, you can practice moving back and forth between just the G
and C chords by creating an exercise where you shift from one chord to the
other with each right-hand strum. You aren’t playing the entire song at this
point, but you’re working on that “problem” moment in the song where you
have to fret the C chord, by practicing this move over and over again. In the
long run, you save a lot of time and energy by focusing on problem areas
rather than playing through the entire tune and slowing down at the trouble
spots.
Keep the tips of your left-hand fingers pointed towards the banjo fingerboard
even if you aren’t using them at that moment to fret. When playing the G
chord, you can position the left-hand fingers you use for the C chord just
above their fretted positions, a technique called ghosting. These fingers are
then ready to move into position and push down (or fret) the strings behind
the appropriate fret (Figure 3-2 shows how to ghost and fret a chord). Even
when you aren’t fretting anything at all in the left hand, it’s still a good idea to
keep the tips of your left-hand fingers pointed towards the fingerboard. You
can be sure that you’ll need them sooner or later!

Chapter 3: Playing by the Rules: Not Enough Theory to Hurt 

You can now try strumming along to a new song, “Boil Them Cabbage Down,”
that uses the same G, C, and D7 chords as “Red River Valley,” but requires
you to change from one chord to another more quickly (see Tab 3-3). “Boil
Them Cabbage Down,” which is Track 5 on the CD, moves to a new chord
with each measure (with the first change coming to the C chord, which
you’ve thoroughly practiced by now, right?). In measure seven, you play two
chords, strumming a G chord on the first beat followed by a D7 chord on the
third beat in the same measure.
Tab 3-3: Strumming chords to “Boil Them Cabbage Down” (Track 5).
Reading Tablature
Tablature (or tab for short) is the written form of music for the banjo. Although
tablature uses quite a few elements that are also found in conventional music
notation, tab imparts information that’s specific to the banjo such as what
string you play and whether that string is open or fretted. Tablature is a part
of almost every instructional book and CD set. And although tab never replaces
being able to play by ear, it enables you to cover ground more quickly when
learning a new piece of music and allows you to double-check what you’ve
learned by ear. Therefore, take a little time to get acquainted with reading
tablature in the following sections.
Finding notes
The big difference between banjo tablature and standard music notation is that
although both use five horizontal lines on the staff, the lines on the banjo
tab staff represent the five strings of your banjo. The top line corresponds
G

to the banjo’s 1st string and the bottom line represents the banjo’s 5th string,
with the second, third, and fourth lines from the top standing for the 2nd,
3rd, and 4th strings on your banjo (see Tab 3-4).
Tab 3-4: The five lines on the banjo tab staff represent the five banjo strings.
Need help in remembering which tab lines stand for which banjo strings?
Note that the visual orientation of the strings on the tab staff is the same
as what you see as you look down on the strings while playing. From this
point of view, the 1st string is the string that is farthest away (and is 
“on top” of the tab staff) and the 5th string is the closest (and “on bottom”
of the tab staff).
In banjo tablature, you also see numbers on each line. These numbers repre-
sent the notes you’re being asked to play, as shown in Tab 3-5. The line that
the number sits on indicates which string you play and the numeric value
tells whether you’re to play an open (unfretted, indicated with  “0”) or 
fretted string. 
Tab 3-5: Numbers on the tab staff lines show open and fretted notes.
And Tab 3-6 displays what the G, C, and D7 chords look like in tablature. The
“b” below the tab staff indicates a right-hand brush.

Tracking down the rhythm
Banjo tablature expresses rhythm in much the same way as it is in conven-
tional music notation, in terms of measures and time signatures (see the sec-
tion “Rhythm: Catching the beat” for more info). Banjo players typically think
of a single measure of tab in 4/4 time as a rhythmic space that’s waiting to be
filled by a maximum of eight notes (or an equivalent combination of fewer
notes with longer duration).
Each note on the tab staff has a stem attached that indicates the duration of
the note. The three note values that you encounter most frequently in banjo
tablature are the quarter note, the eighth note, and the sixteenth note.
Each of these notes has a vertical line extending down from the note that is
called the stem. An eighth note has added to it either a curled or horizontal
line attached to the bottom of the stem, while the sixteenth note has two hor-
izontal lines. These lines are called flags and distinguish one rhythmic value
from another on the tab page. Each note value also has a corresponding rest
sign, which indicates a corresponding number of beats where no note is
played. Tab 3-7 shows these three note values with their corresponding rests
as they appear on a tab staff.

Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

Determining the value of a note in tablature is just like using grade school
fractions: two sixteenth notes take up the same amount of musical space or
time as one eighth note, and two eighth notes occupy the same amount of
space as one quarter note. A measure in 4/4 time needs to be filled with the
equivalent of four quarter notes. Tab 3-8, which is Track 6 on the CD, shows
just a few of the many rhythmic combinations that will meet this requirement.
In the beginning, it may be helpful to count out loud (or in your head) “1 and
2 and 3 and 4 and” for each measure of 4/4 time as you play through a piece,
letting each note last for its appropriate rhythmic duration. For example, if
you’re counting along in the example in Tab 3-8, you can see that an eighth
note takes up the space of one count (either a number or an “and”), while a
quarter note takes up the space of two counts (a number and an “and”). And
playing songs along with the CD is an even better way to internalize these
rhythms.
Tab 3-8: Combining quarter, eighth, and sixteenth notes (Track 6).
Playing Pinch Patterns
After you have a feel for how to figure out the notes and rhythm in tab (see
preceding section), you’re now ready to put all this musical knowledge to
work by getting acquainted with the pinch pattern. The pinch pattern gets its
name from the right-hand motion you use to play the strings. With the pinch
pattern, you strike the strings with a downward motion with the thumb and
with an upward motion with the right-hand index and middle fingers all at the
same time. In other words, you’re pinching the banjo strings with your right
hand!
The pinch pattern is great for beginning players to use when following chord
progressions and accompanying songs. For now, you can play this pattern
without any fingerpicks on your hands, and don’t worry too much about your
right-hand position (I cover that more thoroughly in Chapter 4).
Here’s a step-by-step guide to playing a pinch pattern for an open G chord (all
strings are unfretted):
1. Pick the 3rd string with a downward motion of the thumb.

2. Strike the 5th string with the thumb, the 2nd string with the index
finger, and the 1st string with the middle, playing all three strings at
the same time.
You should hear the sound of three notes together. Remember that the
pinch pattern always uses a downward motion with the right-hand
thumb and an upward motion with the index and middle fingers every
time you pick a string.
3. Pick the fourth string with the thumb.
4. Repeat Step 2 by playing the 5th, 2nd, and 1st strings simultaneously
with the thumb, index, and middle fingers.
You can see in Tab 3-9 what the pinch pattern looks like in tablature for the 
G, C, and D7 chords. Also, be sure to listen to Track 7 on the CD to hear the
pinch pattern in action on these same chords. In the example, “t” stands for
the right-hand thumb, “i” for index finger, and “m” for middle finger.
Tab 3-9: Playing the pinch pattern with G, C, and D7 chords (Track 7).
Note that the numbers on the tab staff change with each new chord in 
Tab 3-9, but that the right-hand picking pattern remains the same in each
measure. As you read through any banjo tab, don’t forget to follow the chord
progression as you play. More often than not, if you fret the chord that’s indi-
cated above the tab staff, then you also have the fretted positions you need
to match what the tab staff line numbers indicate to play. For instance, in 
Tab 3-9, you see a C chord above the tab staff. The lines on the tab staff
(remember, these lines stand for the strings of your banjo) indicate that you
need to fret the 1st string at the second fret, the 2nd string at the first fret,
and the 4th string at the fourth fret. If you fret all three of these strings at the
same time at the beginning of the second measure, following the C-chord indi-
cation that you see above the staff, you’re also fretting everything that’s indi-
cated on the tab staff for this measure.

and “Boil Them Cabbage Down” (Tab 3-11), which are Tracks 8 and 9 on the
CD, respectively. You can check out Chapter 2 and the section on chord pro-
gressions earlier in this book if you need to get more familiar with the G, C,
and D7 chords and the chord progressions to both of these tunes. If you’re
comfortable playing the pinch pattern, you may not need to look at the tab at
all to play these tunes along with the CD.

Chapter 3: Playing by the Rules: Not Enough Theory to Hurt 

Being a Great Team Player
One of the primary reasons that many people want to learn to play the
banjo is to have fun making music with others in bands and in jam sessions.
There’s nothing quite like a banjo, guitar, mandolin, fiddles and bass grooving
along to an old lonesome-sounding ballad or burning up a hot, fast instru-
mental. At a music festival, seeing amateur musicians who have never played
together before open up their cases, take out their instruments, and start
playing tunes together as if they’ve been doing it for years isn’t unusual.
Musicians call these impromptu get-togethers jam sessions.
Musicians can play together in such a spontaneous way because they share a
similar repertoire of songs and have internalized and put into practice some
rules for effective group music making. If you listen closely to a great bluegrass
or old-time band performance, you can hear that the roles of the different
instruments seem to change from one moment to the next. At times, the
banjo is out front and the center of attention, other times when the banjo is
very much in the background, and then you recognize those moments when
the banjo is somewhere in between these two extremes. When playing with
others, you assume different musical roles with your banjo as you play a song
from beginning to end.
In this section, I talk about some of the most important rules for playing with
a group and discuss how you can put them to use as a brand new banjo
player.
Perhaps the two most important aspects of playing with others are to main-
tain a great rhythmic groove that makes the band sound good and to control
your volume. The easiest way to achieve good rhythm is to play simple things
well. Your right hand not only controls your volume, but also communicates
the heart and soul of your playing. Simplicity and drive in your playing cre-
ates musical space for others to play their best and for you to express your
own emotions most powerfully. A successful jam session is one in which
every musician feels that they’re successfully contributing to the overall
sound of the group.
Lead playing: Shining the 
spotlight on yourself
Lead playing has to do with those times when you’re the center of attention
in your band or during a jam session. If you’re playing a well-known banjo
instrumental like “Cripple Creek” or “Foggy Mountain Breakdown,” you’ll
68
Part I: The Amazing Five-String Banjo 

probably start the song by setting the tempo and playing all the way through
the tune one time before handing off the lead to the next willing instrumental-
ist. If you’ve kicked off an instrumental, you’re most likely to be the last one
to play it as well, so have some kind of ending ready if you’ve chosen (or
called) the tune in a jam session.
If you’re playing a song with vocals, you may get the chance to play a banjo
solo only once during the tune, either at the very beginning of the song or
after a chorus. That’s okay! You can have just as much fun in vocal tunes by
playing banjo backup and singing your heart out on the choruses!
When you play lead (also called taking a solo or break), you call on every-
thing you know as a banjo player to make your playing sound its best. At
first, successfully playing a short, memorized arrangement of a song is
enough of an accomplishment. As you become a more skilled player, you rely
on the chord progression of the song to create new ways of playing a solo
right on the spot (this creative process is called improvisation). Musicians
spend an entire lifetime becoming great improvisers, so don’t necessarily
expect this to happen to you for a little while. The best journeys with the
banjo are taken one step at a time!
When playing a solo, playing at full volume is fine, but don’t forget to keep
track of the rhythm of those around you as you play. Because banjo players
play so many notes in comparison to the other players in the band, you may
find yourself tending to push the tempo when you get excited (which usually
occurs when you’re playing lead). Racing away from the rest of the band is
easy if you aren’t careful, so as you’re shredding through a great solo, keep an
ear on the ongoing rhythm of the song and try your best to play in good time!
If you can’t hear the other instrumentalists when they’re playing lead, you’re
probably playing with too much force. In this case, reduce your volume until
you can hear what everyone else is playing. By doing this, you can enjoy
what others are playing a lot more, and in turn, others will enjoy playing
music with you!
Backup playing: Allowing 
others to stand out
For every moment that you’re the star of the show, you’ll have many more
occasions when you give it everything you’ve got to make those around you
sound their best. Backup playing includes all the different techniques that a
banjo player uses to accompany others and is perhaps the highest achieve-
ment of great banjo playing.
69
Chapter 3: Playing by the Rules: Not Enough Theory to Hurt 

Because the banjo can so easily overpower other instruments during a jam
session or in a band, a simple chording technique is sometimes the best way
to allow others to be easily heard, especially if a singer is singing quietly or if
you’re playing backup to a guitar or mandolin solo (which never seem to be
able to pick up as much volume as the beloved banjo). Bluegrass musicians
call this chording technique vamping.
At other times, you want to keep a steady flow of notes going with the banjo,
changing chords at the same time as other musicians. With this kind of
backup (which sounds especially good when accompanying a singer or a
fiddle solo), you’re keeping the energy flowing by doing what the banjo does
best with roll patterns and basic accompaniment techniques. To read more
about these ideas, you can flip over to Chapters 4 and 8.

notice an immediate difference in your playing after just a few minutes of
practice with these patterns. After you become comfortable with the exer-
cises in this chapter, you can put your new skills to work by playing along
with two tunes. You’ll be well on your way to becoming a good banjo player!
Whether it’s clawhammer or bluegrass, playing the banjo makes you part of a
living and ever-evolving musical tradition. Each new generation of players,
amateur and professional alike, makes its own unique contribution. Now it’s
time for you to start making your contribution by getting out your banjo and
practicing the right-hand basics of clawhammer and bluegrass banjo.
Clawhammer and Bluegrass: 
Down-Picking and Up-Picking
When you’re talking about the banjo, the terms clawhammer and bluegrass
refer to two different ways of striking the strings of your banjo with the right
hand. I describe these different approaches in the following:

 Clawhammer technique is sometimes called a down-picking approach to
banjo playing because the right-hand fingers strike the strings in a down-
ward motion. Clawhammer is the older of these two ways of playing the
banjo, with historical roots that can be traced back several centuries to
the African ancestry of the banjo (for more on these historical roots,
check out Chapter 7).
 Bluegrass is known as an up-picking approach, because the right-hand
index and middle fingers strike the strings in an upward motion, with
the right-hand fingers moving in towards the palm of your right hand
and the thumb moving in a downward direction. North Carolina banjo
player Earl Scruggs is largely responsible for creating the bluegrass
banjo style, bringing it to national attention in the late 1940s and
early 1950s.
Both the clawhammer and bluegrass styles draw attention to the high-
pitched 5th string in some way. Within easy reach of the right hand thumb,
the 5th string is a big part of what makes banjo music sound unique. As you
work through this chapter, take note of how the 5th string is used in each
style and also how the melody of a song is played, and you can be well on
your way to understanding what banjo music is all about.
Clawhammer Right-Hand Basics
Clawhammer banjo combines melody and rhythm in a way that makes people
want to get up and dance. This playing style sounds unlike anything else in
American music! The exact origin of word clawhammer is unknown. However,
the term seems to describe the desired shape of the right-hand thumb when
playing this technique — mimicking the “claw” of the top part of a standard
nail hammer (hence clawhammer).
Other musicians relate the term to the hammer-like downward movement that’s
used to strike the strings. Many West African-type banjos (see Figure 4-1)
have been played in similar ways for centuries, but the specific rhythms,
techniques, and sounds of clawhammer banjo were developed in the south-
ern United States from the mid-19th to the early-20th centuries. When you
play clawhammer banjo, you’re connecting to a very deep current of musical
world history!

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Finding a good right-hand position
Good right-hand technique is the most important aspect of clawhammer 
playing. Finding a comfortable and stable right-hand position to enable
your fingers and thumb to do their work is the first step towards this goal.
Here’s a step-by-step guide to finding a position that works for you:
1. With your palm and wrist parallel to the banjo head, grab the top of
the 5th string with your right-hand thumb over the banjo head, not
too far from where the neck joins the banjo pot.
2. While still holding the thumb against the 5th string, bring your right-
hand fingers into your hand and make a fist; relax the fingers just a
bit, keeping them flexed at such an angle that the fingernails are 
parallel to the banjo head and the fingers are no more than one or
two inches above the strings.
Your hand should now look like the hand in Figure 4-2a.

Chapter 4: Getting Right with the Right Hand

3. Play the 3rd string by moving down and across it with your right
hand index finger, moving the hand from the wrist (see Figure 4-2b).
Strike the string with enough downward force so that your index finger
comes to rest against the 2nd string (as seen in Figure 4-2c). Some play-
ers also use their forearm in addition to their wrist to get a more forceful
hand motion. Note that the right-hand thumb stays in contact with the
5th string throughout this exercise.
Your fingers should maintain the same position as your hand moves down to
allow the index finger to strike the string — don’t let the fingers flip out as
they meet the strings. The fingers need to stay fairly stiff so that the index
finger can provide resistance against the string, but you don’t want to be too
tense. Likewise, keep the wrist unlocked but not actually loose. The more you
practice the techniques in this chapter, the more you can get the hang of
playing clawhammer style with the “loose stiffness” that you need to get a
good sound.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Playing your first clawhammer notes
After you’ve got a good hand position (see preceding section), it’s time to try
a few exercises to get used to striking the strings in the clawhammer style.
Clawhammer is very much an individualized approach to banjo playing. Even
the best players play in a personalized way, doing what works best for them.
Although I set some general guidelines for you here, experiment with different
ways of doing things to see what works best for you. Seek out other players
for advice whenever you can, but go for what sounds good and feels the most
natural to you.
You can work up to playing the basic clawhammer strum by first getting com-
fortable striking individual notes. In the exercises to follow, I suggest that you
use the right-hand index finger for playing melody notes (as indicated with
the small letter i underneath each note in the banjo tab). However, the right-
hand middle finger is another option preferred by many players. Try playing
both ways and go with what feels best to you.
Here are some tips for developing good right-hand clawhammer technique:
 Having your finger knock the head after striking the string is okay (the
head is the round, white top surface of the banjo; for more on banjo parts,
check out Chapter 1). Remember, clawhammer is a percussive and rhyth-
mic approach to playing the banjo. Don’t be afraid to make some noise!
 Most players use their index or middle fingernails to get a good clawham-
mer sound. In lieu of fingernails, you can use fingerpicks as an extension
of the fingernail but be sure to place the pick so that it covers the nail,
not the pad of the finger as in bluegrass technique (see the section
“Choosing and fitting thumbpicks and fingerpicks” later in this chapter).
Try playing without picks first to see what kind of sound you get, and
then play with picks if you think your fingernails aren’t long enough to
get enough contact with the strings.
 Remember that your finger is moving both down into the string and
down towards the floor. Work towards developing a quick, decisive
movement from the wrist that keeps your hand in control.
 When your index or middle finger plays the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th strings, it
usually comes to rest against the next highest string.
 Some players bend their thumb at the joint to get that “claw” effect of
hooking the finger underneath the strings. Other players extended the
thumb outward. Again, try both and see which works best for you.
77
Chapter 4: Getting Right with the Right Hand

Melody-note exercises
Try playing individual notes on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings with
your right-hand index or middle finger (see Tab 4-1, which is Track 10 on
the CD). As you slowly play these individual notes, focus on your hand 
position and technique. Are you moving from the wrist? Are you practicing
with good economy of motion (no swooping right hand like guitar player
Pete Townsend)? Does your finger maintain its bent shape when it meets
the string?
Tab 4-1: Clawhammer right hand melody note exercise 1 (Track 10).
As you get more comfortable with this first melody-note exercise, try playing
different strings in succession in whatever order comes to mind. Tab 4-2
(Track 11) shows some examples.
Tab 4-2: Clawhammer right hand melody note exercise 2 (Track 11).
Brush exercise
The brush follows the melody note in basic clawhammer banjo technique.
In banjo tab, the right-hand indication for the brush is the letter b, found
below the corresponding notes in the tab staff.
With the brush, you get to choose which right-hand finger (or fingers) to use
and how many strings to strike, but you don’t have to decide exactly how
you’re going to do brush right now. Just keep trying different combinations and
in time, you’ll decide upon the way that works best for you. However, if you
aren’t sure where to start, first try brushing across the top two or three
strings with just the middle finger by itself. Next, add the ring finger, using
both fingers to brush across the top strings. Now try the index finger by
itself.

Whatever fingers you use, try striking just the 1st string alone for the brush.
Then try the top two, top three, and finally all four strings (that is, excluding
the 5th string) with any combination of right-hand index and middle fingers.
Although the brush is most commonly played across the top two or three
strings (all four is uncommon), you need to get used to the feel and sound you
get with each brush. Don’t forget to maintain a consistent, bent finger shape
as you hit the strings. Try playing Tab 4-3 and listen to Track 12 on the CD.
Tab 4-3: Clawhammer right-hand brush exercise (Track 12).
5th-string exercise
After you have a good feel for the brush (see the preceding section) try com-
bining the brush with the 5th string. This time, as you play the brush with a
downward motion of either the index or middle fingers, remember to bring
the thumb against the 5th string as you complete the brush (as shown in

Chapter 4: Getting Right with the Right Hand
All part of the old-time way
Clawhammer banjo is also known as frailing,
rapping, or banging on the banjo. In the mid-19th
century, this way of playing was called stroke
style in banjo instructional manuals. These
terms are all strange to use to describe a way
of playing a musical instrument, but in this case,
they’re good ones because they all describe
what the right hand is doing when playing the
banjo in this way.
Clawhammer banjo is also frequently called old-
time banjo, but these terms aren’t synonymous.
Old-time refers to a wide variety of folk-based,
non-bluegrass banjo techniques. Record com-
panies in the 1920s used the term old-time as a
descriptive label on 78 rpm recordings to refer
to songs or artists with some kind of rural con-
nection. The term stuck and today old-time now
applies to a wide variety of string band music
with guitars, fiddles, mandolins, and banjos.
Clawhammer is one type of old-time banjo play-
ing, but many other ways of playing banjo are also
called old-time by the musicians who play them.

Figure 4-3a). You’re now ready to play with the 5th string with a downward
and sideways motion from the thumb. Don’t be afraid to really snap this note
with your right-hand thumb, bringing the right hand above the strings after
the thumb has done its work (as shown in Figure 4-3b). 
Listen to Track 13 and try the exercise in Tab 4-4.
Tab 4-4: Clawhammer right-hand brush and 5th-string exercise (Track 13).
Putting it all together: Melody note + brush + 5th string
If you combine the three movements from the preceding sections, you get the
basic clawhammer right-hand technique. The first note that you hit is the
melody note, played on either the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th strings. This step is fol-
lowed by the brush and ends with the thumb striking the 5th string. The first
note lasts twice as long as the brush and 5th-string notes.

Players often describe the rhythm that they’re after like this: BUM - dit - ty /
BUM - dit -ty, with the emphasis on the “BUM” (sorry, no offense intended!).
Tab 4-5 shows what this rhythm looks like, and you can hear it on Track 14 of
the CD.
Tab 4-5: Basic clawhammer technique exercise 1 (Track 14).
Each measure begins with a different melody-note string, so try practicing
one measure over and over again before going on to the next. When you’re
comfortable starting with any of the four strings, you can then begin to mix
up the melody notes, as shown in Tab 4-6 (Track 15).
Tab 4-6: Mixing up melody notes: basic clawhammer technique exercise 2 (Track 15).
To go one step further, you can try the basic clawhammer technique with the
G, C, and D7 chords (see Tab 4-7, which is Track 16). Although I suggest that
you use particular index melody notes for each chord, try as many different
string options as you can, from 1st to 4th, on each beat. (You need all of these
choices when you play melodies in Chapter 6.)

Using clawhammer banjo 
as accompaniment
Basic clawhammer technique is great to use as an accompaniment to all
kinds of songs.
The first note that you strike in basic clawhammer technique (which I call the
melody note in the previous sections) is dependent on the chord that you’re
playing (more on this in Chapter 6).
For now, follow the guide in Tab 4-7 in choosing the melody notes for the G, C,
and D7 chords and play along to the following tunes in Tab 4-8 (Track 17) and
Tab 4-9 (Track 18).

Bluegrass Right-Hand Basics
Bluegrass style banjo originated with the innovations of Earl Scruggs, who
burst upon the national scene in the mid-1940s. The bluegrass style is charac-
terized by a flurry of fast, brilliant-sounding notes and is the sound behind
all-time banjo classics such as Scruggs’ “Foggy Mountain Breakdown” and
“Dueling Banjos.” Although this way of playing the banjo is at the foundation
of the bluegrass style, banjo players such as Béla Fleck and Alison Brown
have used this approach as a starting point for incredible musical journeys
into classical, jazz, and rock styles.
Bluegrass banjo playing uses the thumb, index finger, and middle fingers of
the right hand and (for this reason) is sometimes called three-finger picking.
Because banjo players always go for the shortest description, the term 
three-finger picking has stuck over the years even though it would be more
accurate to call it a “thumb and two finger” style. Whether you call it blue-
grass or three-finger style, this sound is most frequently heard on recordings
and is the most widely played around the world today.
Just like when you’re figuring out how to play clawhammer banjo (see pre-
vious sections), the biggest challenge with the bluegrass style is in getting
a comfortable right-hand position that enables you to play clearly and
quickly. And because bluegrass banjo players use picks on their thumbs
and index and middle fingers, part of being able to play bluegrass comfort-
ably is finding the right picks. In the following sections, you can select and
fit the picks you need and find a right-hand playing position that works well
for you.

Chapter 4: Getting Right with the Right Hand

Before Earl, 19th-century musicians played the banjo by using fingerpicking
techniques borrowed from the guitar. Later, early 20th century rural musi-
cians, such as Uncle Dave Macon and Charlie Poole, featured simplified (at
least compared to Earl!) two- and three-finger picking techniques on their
early country recordings.
Choosing and fitting thumbpicks 
and fingerpicks
Bluegrass banjo players use metal fingerpicks on their right-hand index and
middle fingers and a plastic thumbpick on their thumb. Initially, you may find
that getting used to the feel of these picks is a struggle. It may feel like you’re
wearing a coat of armor over the ends of your fingers, and you may hear a lot
of scratchy sounds when you first start to play. However, just about everyone
gets used to the feel of the picks after a few weeks, and you’ll appreciate the
extra volume and drive that the picks lend to your playing.
A visit to a music store can reveal numerous kinds of picks available for the
thumb and fingers. In the following sections, I describe what you want to look
for when you’re picking up some picks.
The thumbpick
A thumbpick consists of a flat striking surface and a bent section that wraps
the pick around the thumb. Most players prefer thumbpicks made from plas-
tic, but a few players prefer the fit and sound of a metal thumbpick. In either
case, choose a thumbpick that fits as snugly as possible, with the blade
facing in towards your right-hand fingers.
Don’t mistake a thumbpick for the more common flatpick, which is a pick
used by guitarists and mandolin players. A flatpick is held in the right hand
by the thumb and fingers. You can see the difference between the two in
Figure 4-4. Don’t be afraid to ask a music store employee or fellow musician
to lead you in the direction of the thumbpicks.
Thumbpicks come in different sizes, thicknesses, and striking surface (blade)
angles (see Figure 4-5), so try as many different brands as you can to see what
feels the most comfortable to you. If you’re like most players, you end up trying
many different kinds of thumbpicks, and your preferences change as time
goes on. There’s nothing wrong with this! As in so many other aspects of banjo
playing, you can’t find one right answer. However, many professional players
prefer a thumbpick that isn’t too thin and doesn’t have too short of a blade.

Chapter 4: Getting Right with the Right Hand

As you fit the thumbpick onto your thumb, don’t push it too far up your
thumb — about halfway between the first joint and the end of your thumb is
about right for most players (you can check out this placement in Figure 4-6).
If your thumb is too small for your favorite pick to fit tightly, don’t be afraid
to add surgical or duct tape to the inside of the pick to make it fit more
snugly. Some players even place their thumbpick in boiling water for a few
seconds to soften the plastic. You can then shape the pick to fit tighter after
carefully removing the pick from the water. Do I have to tell you not to fetch
the pick out of the water with your hands? Of course not! Banjo players are
smarter than the average human being.
At prices around $1 to $4, thumbpicks aren’t expensive, so go ahead and pur-
chase a bunch of different kinds to see which one suits your playing best.
Look for thumbpicks by Dunlop, Golden Gate, National, Propik, and Zookies,
among others, for good sound and playability.
The fingerpick
Like thumbpicks, metal fingerpicks consist of a blade-shaped striking surface
joined to a collar that holds the fingerpick around the end of the finger. You
want to fit the picks on your index and middle fingers so that the striking sur-
face is on the opposite side of your hand from your fingernail (as shown in
Figure 4-7).

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

You can find many different kinds of fingerpicks on the market today (you can
have a look at a few of them in Figure 4-8). They vary in size and thickness
and also in metal composition. Some fingerpicks have more of a curved strik-
ing surface while others have a flat blade. Some have holes in them and
others don’t. Your best bet is to experiment with different fingerpicks to see
which ones fit the most comfortably and — most importantly — sound the
best to you.
Fingerpicks tend to be more expensive than thumbpicks, ranging in price
from $3 a pair to $35 for a pair of handcrafted stainless-steel picks. Look for
metal fingerpicks from Propik, National, Dunlop, Showcase 41, and Sammy
Shelor, among others, for the tone preferred by bluegrass players.

Chapter 4: Getting Right with the Right Hand

You need to bend the fingerpicks to get a good fit, because they don’t usually
come straight from the store ready to use without modification. Here’s how
you do it:
1. Place the pick on the end of your finger with the collar placed
between the end of the finger and the first joint.
Don’t place the collar at the joint itself because that’s too far up the
finger.
2. Grasp either side of the collar with your left-hand thumb and index
finger and squeeze it so that the fit is snug but not too tight on the end
of your finger.
Remember that you want the blade of the pick extending just past the
end of your finger. If your pick fits well, you can stop here, but most
players also like to bend the blade back a bit to match the natural curve
of the end of the finger, which I explain in the next step.
3. If your pick isn’t too heavy, you should be able to successfully bend
the blade by pushing down on the pick against a table top or another
hard surface (as shown in Figure 4-9).
Figure 4-9:

88
Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

One last modification that some players make to their fingerpicks is that they
fit the pick on the finger at a slight angle, so that when the finger strikes the
banjo string, the pick will then meet the string at more of a straight, or paral-
lel, angle. This modification can result in a fuller, more-pleasing tone as well
as added volume. You don’t need to worry about this right now, but you may
want to try angling the fingerpick as you gain more experience playing.
Acquiring a good right-hand position
I bet that one of the main reasons that you love bluegrass banjo music is that
it’s so incredibly fast and loud. Me too! In order to play at those tempos that
approach the speed of sound, you need to find a right-hand position that pro-
vides a stable foundation for the thumb and fingers to do all that incredible
picking.
Relaxation is key to great right-hand bluegrass technique, so remember to
constantly check for tension from your shoulder to your fingertips as you
work through the following steps to find a comfortable right-hand position.
Getting set
Here’s a quick way to get your right hand set in a good bluegrass playing
position. I’ve used this method successfully with hundreds of players, and it
can work for you too. Try the following steps while sitting comfortably in a
chair without arms, with your feet resting on the floor (for info on the parts
of the banjo I mention in this section, see Chapter 1):
1. Relax your right arm and hand, letting the arm dangle loosely at the
side of your body (see Figure 4-10a).
2. Bring the right hand up, resting it on your right leg and keeping your
arm relaxed (see Figure 4-10b).
Note the position of your right hand: When the hand is fully relaxed, it
should assume a cupped position with all the finger joints slightly bent.
3. Place your right forearm against the armrest (or against the side of
the banjo, if your instrument doesn’t have an armrest), positioning the
right hand to be over and above the banjo strings (see Figure 4-10c).
You don’t want to position your right hand either too high or too low in
relation to the strings. If your right-hand ring and pinky fingers are touch-
ing the banjo strings, your right hand is positioned too high. On the
other hand, if you feel you’re having to reach in quite a bit to play the
3rd string with your index, your hand is probably positioned too low in
relation to the strings.

Chapter 4: Getting Right with the Right Hand

4. Slide your right forearm back along the armrest until the ring and
pinky finger come to rest on the banjo head close to the bridge, but
aren’t actually touching it (see Figure 4-10d).
By completing Step 4, your right-hand thumb, index, and middle fingers
should be set in a good playing position. You may have to move the
right elbow out just a bit to allow your fingers to contact the head.
As you anchor the right hand with your ring and/or little fingers, arch
your wrist slightly so that your wrist and forearm don’t touch the
banjo head.
An arched wrist is just about essential for getting the right-hand fingers
in a good position for playing. However, falling into the bad habit of
bending the wrist in the opposite direction, towards the banjo head, 
is a common problem with many new players. This position only
adds tension to your right hand, forearm, and shoulder, and makes 
it difficult for the thumb to easily reach all the strings that it needs
to play.
Some players arch their wrists just a little and others a lot. You can work
out the fine details of your wrist arch as you continue to practice. For
now, try to remember to keep at least a bit of an arch in the wrist, and
you’ll be fine!
Putting your thumb and fingers to good use
With your hand positioned over the strings and ready to play (see the pre-
ceding section), you’re ready to take a look at how the thumb and fingers
actually strike the strings in bluegrass style:
 The thumb is the most active of the three striking fingers, and you need
it to be in position to play the 5th, 4th, 3rd, and 2nd strings as needed.
 Your index finger plays the 3rd and 2nd strings.
 Your middle finger plays the 1st string.
Refer back to that cupped hand position that you used in Step 2 in the pre-
ceding section to set your right hand on the banjo head. That’s your starting
point as you begin to play. Working from this relaxed position, you want to
strike the strings by sweeping the thumb across the strings, using the joint
that’s closest to the hand. If your wrist is arched, the thumb should move
across and slightly up as you strike each string. You want to avoid hitting the
adjacent string with your thumb.

Chapter 4: Getting Right with the Right Hand

Now try playing the 5th through the 2nd strings with your thumb, playing
each string four times slowly in succession before moving on to the next
string, as indicated in Tab 4-10, which is Track 19 on the CD. Listen carefully
to the result. Does the note ring clearly? Is there enough volume? Is your
hand relaxed as you pick the string with the thumb? If so, good work!
Tab 4-10: Right-hand thumb bluegrass exercise (Track 19).
After you have your thumb movement down pat, you must move on to play
notes with the index and middle fingers (be sure to refer to Tab 4-11 and
Track 20 as needed). You want to use primarily the first joint — the one that’s
closest to the hand — to play strings with your index and middle fingers:
1. Try playing the 3rd and 2nd strings with your index finger and the 1st
string with your middle finger.
By using mostly the first joint to move the end of the finger pick across
each string, you will almost feel as if you’re pushing down on the string.
2. Move the index or middle finger straight towards the palm of your
right hand after picking a string.
3. After the follow-through in Step 2, simply relax the finger so that it
can return to its original position.
Don’t deliberately sweep it outward from your palm.
Tab 4-11: Right-hand index and middle finger bluegrass exercise (Track 20).
I know that these steps can sound quite complicated! However, I’m actually
describing in great detail what usually occurs quite naturally after your hand
is properly positioned on the banjo head. Don’t think too hard about this
process (after all, we are banjo players, aren’t we?). Go for what feels effort-
less and natural and for what gives you the best tone and most volume.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Figure 4-11 shows my hand position when using the right-hand thumb to play
the third string, the right-hand index to play the second string and the right-
hand middle to play the first string. If your fingers and hand look close to
mine, you’re on the right track!
Staying relaxed while picking with the right hand is important. If you’re
moving on to the exercises in the next few sections, try to imagine that your
fingers are doing all the work, while your shoulder, arm, wrist, and top of
your hand stay loose and relaxed.
Playing roll patterns
Roll patterns are repeated right-hand sequences of notes that are the basic
building blocks for the rippling, fast sound of bluegrass banjo. While guitarists,
fiddlers, and mandolin players practice scales, bluegrass banjo players work
on roll patterns. You can use roll patterns as the foundation for accompany-
ing other players and singers and for playing solos and melodies on the
banjo.
Roll patterns are made up of both specific sequences of repeated right-hand
finger movements as well as the actual strings that are played (these aren’t
always the same, because you can play different strings, using the same pat-
tern of right-hand fingers). For most songs, roll patterns are made up of
repeated phrases of eight notes that are equal in length. You usually won’t
use the same right-hand finger twice in a row or strike the same string twice
in succession in playing a roll pattern.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 
The great debate: One anchor finger or two?
One of the raging controversies in the bluegrass
banjo world over the last several decades is
whether it’s best to anchor the right hand with
both the ring and pinky fingers or whether it’s
alright to anchor with just the pinky finger. Most
beginning players have trouble keeping the ring
finger anchored on the head, especially when
playing a note with the middle right-hand finger,
because the muscles of these two fingers are
interdependent and playing a string with the
middle finger often causes the ring finger to
move in tandem with it.
The majority of professional players have fig-
ured out how to anchor both the right-hand ring
and pinky fingers on the banjo head (see the
accompanying photo a), but several outstanding
players anchor just the pinky finger (see photo
b), letting the ring finger move with the middle
finger. I’ve taught many beginning students to
anchor both fingers by urging them to play for a
few weeks by using just the ring finger for an
anchor. After this finger is trained to stay on the
banjo head, having the pinky finger join it is a
relatively easy matter. A proper arch to your
wrist should really help in training the ring finger
to stay on the banjo head.
The bottom line? My advice is to try supporting
the right hand by using both fingers if you can,
but if it feels better to use just the pinky finger
for support, go for it! If you stay relaxed and
you’re finding you’re getting a good sound, you
can play well either way!

The alternating-thumb roll, the forward-backward roll, and the forward roll
are the basic roll patterns that get you into the fast lane on the bluegrass
banjo highway, and I explain them in the following sections.
Alternating thumb roll
The alternating thumb roll is sometimes called the thumb in-and-out roll.
Whatever you call it, the right-hand thumb plays every other note in this
eight-note roll, and you alternate using your index and middle fingers in
between using your thumb. Note that this roll is actually made up of a four-
note sequence that’s repeated.
Here are the details on how the alternating-thumb roll works:
 The order in which you use the right-hand fingers is as follows: thumb,
index, thumb, middle, thumb, index, thumb, middle.
 A common string sequence for this roll is: 3rd string, 2nd string, 5th
string, 1st string, 4th string, 2nd string, 5th string, 1st string. In tablature,
the alternating thumb roll played with the G, C, and D7 chords looks like
what you can see in Tab 4-12, which is Track 21 on the CD.
Tab 4-12: The alternating thumb roll with G, C, and D7 chords (Track 21).
As you play this roll, try to pick each note clearly, making sure that your
index and middle fingers are producing enough volume in comparison with
the thumb. Play the roll slowly and evenly and try not to stop as you change
from the G to the C and to the D7 chords.
The forward-backward roll
The forward-backward roll is also known as the forward-reverse roll or the
reverse roll. All of these labels suggest that this roll begins with the fingers
moving in one direction but then doubles back in the opposite direction —
and that’s exactly what happens here:
 The order of right-hand fingers for this roll is: thumb, index, middle,
thumb, middle, index, thumb, middle.
 A typical string sequence is as follows: 3rd string, 2nd string, 1st string,
5th string, 1st string, 2nd string, 3rd string, 1st string.

Chapter 4: Getting Right with the Right Hand

You can see what the forward-backward roll pattern played with the G, C, and
D7 chords looks like in tablature in Tab 4-13, which is Track 22.
Tab 4-13: The forward-backward roll with G, C, and D7 chords (Track 22).
The forward roll
The forward roll is the pattern that gives bluegrass banjo its rhythmical and
hard, driving sound. This pattern is a bit more difficult than the two rolls in
the previous sections because this roll gathers notes into groups of three.
You can find several different variations on the forward roll.
Here’s a standard way of playing this roll:
 The order of right-hand fingers is thumb, middle, thumb, index, middle,
thumb, index, middle.
 The string sequence for the G and D7 chords is: 3rd string, 1st string, 5th
string, 3rd string, 1st string, 5th string, 3rd string, 1st string. Note that
for the C chord, you substitute the 2nd string for the third string in this
series. See Tab 4-14 and listen to Track 23.
Tab 4-14: The forward roll with G, C, and D7 chords (Track 23).
Using bluegrass rolls as accompaniment
A great way to accompany other musicians or a singer is to use the rolls pre-
sented in the preceding section interchangeably in a song. Remember that
you aren’t really trying to play the melody of the song, but you’re using the
roll patterns to create a flowing accompaniment in the same way that a guitar
or mandolin player strums his instrument.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Try accompanying “Red River Valley” (see Tab 4-15, which is Track 24) by
using just the forward roll and “Boil Them Cabbage Down” (Tab 4-16,
Track 25) by using the alternating thumb, reverse, and forward rolls inter-
changeably.
As you master these arrangements, feel free to mix and match the roll pat-
terns in whatever way sounds good to you. As long as you stay in rhythm and
start a new roll pattern on the first beat of each measure, you can’t go wrong!
If you make a mistake while practicing or playing along with the CD, that’s
okay. Just stop for a moment and join back in at the beginning of a new roll
pattern as soon as you can.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Chapter 5
Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling:
Adding the Left Hand
In This Chapter
 Playing slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and chokes
 Using left-hand techniques in clawhammer and bluegrass banjo
W
hether you’re moving up or down the strings while fretting, coming
down on the string to create a higher pitched note, snapping off the
string to sound a lower pitched note or bending a fretted note up in pitch, the
left hand has a lot to say in the world of banjo music. You can hear a big dif-
ference in your own playing after you can make the left hand not only talk the
talk but also walk the walk!
In this chapter, you’re introduced to the left-hand techniques that all banjo
players use to make melodies flow more smoothly and sound more interest-
ing and varied. All the techniques in this chapter focus on how the left-hand
fingers can create notes that embellish what your right hand is picking. These
left-hand techniques are similar for both clawhammer and bluegrass banjo
and, when combined with the right hand, are the building blocks for both
ways of playing the banjo.
You don’t have to worry about playing the techniques in this chapter on the
5th string. The function of the 5th string in both clawhammer and bluegrass
banjo is to provide a steady, high-pitched drone (a drone is a repeated pitch;
bagpipes typically have low pitched drone notes while the banjo has a high
pitched drone). Stick to strings 1 through 4 with these left-hand techniques
and you’ll be picking fine in no time!

As you gain mastery over each new left-hand technique presented in this
chapter (the slide, hammer-on, pull-off, and choke), don’t forget to have some
fun with these ideas as you perfect them. Mix them up and play the different
techniques at random to get used to moving from a slide to a hammer-on or a
pull-off to a choke on different strings.
Approach the exercises in this chapter as if you’re learning the vocabulary of
a new language. As you gain more experience in playing, you’ll encounter
many more new phrases and gain greater skills in how to combine these
phrases into meaningful musical expressions. If you’ve mastered the tech-
niques in this chapter, you’re off to a great start in “talking banjo,” and you
can confidently go on to the next step — learning some actual banjo tunes
(which you can do in Chapter 6)!
Slipping into the Slide
You can’t find anything quite like the sweeping sound of a well-played slide
on the banjo, just like the ones you hear at the beginning of “Cripple Creek.”
Slides add emphasis to a melody note by moving to that note from another
pitch. They can add a bluesy feeling to your banjo playing, resembling the
sound of the lonesome wind, a baying hound, or even a speeding train.
To play the slide, you use a left-hand finger that’s already fretting a string to
sound a new note by moving up or down the banjo neck along the same
string to a new fret. The left-hand technique you use is the same regardless of
the string you’re on. However, the frets that you begin and end each slide on
vary according to which string you’re playing.
In this section, you’re introduced to the basic mechanics of the slide (using
the 3rd string) and then move on to playing other slides on the 3rd string
before going wild with additional slides on the 4th and 1st strings. (I don’t
include 2nd-string slides because they aren’t as common.)
The secret to a good-sounding slide is to maintain enough fretting pressure
with the left hand so that the sound isn’t cut off.
Getting down the slide: The basics
To play a slide, check out each of the following steps (I use the 3rd string for
the sake of example; you play slides on other strings too, starting and stop-
ping at different frets, but use these basic mechanics for all strings):
100
Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

1. Press down (or fret) the 3rd string at the second fret with the middle
finger of your left hand.
I tend to use the middle finger of my left hand for all the slides on all
strings in this section, because I feel like I have the most control with
this finger. However, depending upon what’s happening with your left
hand at a particular moment in a song, you may sometimes need to use
another left-hand finger to execute a slide. The left-hand index finger is
another good choice for any of the slides you encounter in this section.
2. Pick the 3rd string with your right hand.
If you’re playing clawhammer, move down across the string with your
right-hand index finger (or your middle finger, if you’ve decided to use
this finger for melody notes). If you’re picking bluegrass, play the note
with the right-hand thumb pick by moving down across the string.
3. After the note has sounded, slide the left-hand middle finger along the
3rd string from the second fret to the fourth fret.
Keep exerting the same amount of pressure with the fretting finger as
you originally used to fret the string and stop the finger just behind the
fourth fret. You want to hear a continuous sound as your left-hand finger
moves from one fret to another.
4. Keep the left-hand finger fretted at the fourth fret and let the new
note ring.
Congratulations! You’ve just successfully played your first slide.
Just like you don’t need a whole lot of pressure for the left-hand fingers to 
get a clear sound on a fretted note, you may also find that you don’t need to
exert much pressure with your fretting finger to get a good sound out of your
slides. Experiment to find the least amount of fretting pressure you need to
still maintain the ringing sound of the picked note as you slide from one fret
to another.
Keep reading to find more slides you can play not only on the 3rd string, but
also on the 4th and 1st strings too.
Trying 3rd-string slides
If you can play a slide on the 3rd string moving from the second to the fourth
fret (I show you how in the preceding section), it’s time to try two more 3rd-
string slides, once again by using the left-hand middle finger.
101
Chapter 5: Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling: Adding the Left Hand

You can tackle these 3rd-string slides in a few different ways. Both of these
slides paint a banjo blues mood:
 Slide from the second fret up to the third fret: You can follow the same
basic steps of a slide from the preceding section; just remember that
you don’t slide all the way to the fourth fret.
 Slide from the third fret down to the second fret: You carry out this
slide in the same way as a slide that starts lower and moves higher.
You’re simply going in a different direction.
In banjo tablature, the s indication lets you know that you’re supposed to
slide. For example, you can see what these three 3rd-string slides look like in
banjo tablature in Tab 5-1 and listen to Track 26.
Tab 5-1: Playing 3rd-string slides: second to fourth fret; second to third fret; and third to second fret (Track 26).
Undertaking 4th-string slides
After conquering third-string slides (see preceding sections), you’re ready to
move on to the brave new world of the 4th-string slide. The 4th string is the
lowest pitched string on your banjo. If you strike it with some force before
you move your left-hand finger for the slide, you can get a booming slide 
that you can feel all the way into your belly (this is good, by the way).
The 4th string is thicker and heavier than your 3rd string, so don’t be sur-
prised if you have to fret a bit harder with your left-hand finger to sustain the
sound of the note with your 4th-string slides.
Follow the basic instructions in the section “Getting down the slide: The
basics” presented earlier in this chapter for the mechanics of the slide and
don’t forget to use your left-hand middle finger to fret the string for the fol-
lowing 4th-string slides (note that both of these slides end at the fifth fret):
 Slide from the fourth fret up to the fifth fret: You don’t have far to go
on this slide, but remember to apply the appropriate pressure so you
can get the sound you’re looking for.

 Slide from the second fret up to the fifth fret: Although this slide moves
impressively three frets up the neck, other slides cover even more fretted
territory. Remember that you don’t want to hear all the pitches that lie
between the beginning and end points of your slide. Make it a smooth, con-
tinuous swoop, and you’ll be playing it the way that other banjo players like
to hear it.
Check out the tablature for these two 4th-string slides in Tab 5-2, and listen to
Track 26 on the CD.
Tab 5-2: Playing 4th-string slides: fourth to fifth fret; and second to fifth fret (Track 26).
Focusing on 1st-string slides
You may need some slides on the 1st string every now and then to catch some
high melody notes. You may notice that the following 1st-string slides are very
similar to the 4th-string slides (you’re just on a different string):
 Slide from the fourth fret up to the fifth fret: Because the 1st string is
lighter in weight than the 3rd or 4th strings, sustaining the sound of this slide
shouldn’t take much pressure at all.
 Slide from the second fret up to the fifth fret: You’re covering a greater dis-
tance with this slide, so use more pressure with the left-hand middle finger
to sustain the note.
To get a feel for these 1st-string slides in tablature, take a look at Tab 5-3 and
listen again to Track 26.
Tab 5-3: Playing first string slides: fourth to fifth fret; second to fifth fret (Track 26).

Chapter 5: Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling: Adding the Left Hand

Nailing the Hammer-On
An aggressive and well-played hammer-on, like you hear at the very begin-
ning of “Foggy Mountain Breakdown,” can be one of the most exciting
moments in banjo music. This technique lets everyone in the room know
you’ve got a banjo, and you know how to use it! Hammer-ons can crack like 
a whip, its sound hitting you like a hair-raising blast of freezing-cold air.
Hammer-ons are an important part of banjo music — and they’re a heck of a
lot of fun to play.
With the hammer-on, you create a new note with the left-hand fretting finger
by bringing it down with some force on a string that’s just been played by the
right hand. You aren’t moving along the string as you do with the slide (see
the section “Slipping into the Slide”), but you’re coming straight down on 
it with the tip of your finger — like a hammer. Like the slide, you use the
hammer-on to embellish or emphasize a melody note — the note that’s being
“hammered on.”
You can hammer-on either from an open string to a fretted string or from 
one fretted string to another, which I show you how to do in the following
sections.
Playing open-string hammer-ons
You can get a feel for the open-string (unfretted) hammer-on by following
these step-by-step instructions (for the sake of this example, go ahead and
begin on the 4th string; you use the same procedure for different strings as
well):
1. Play the 4th string open with either the index finger of the right hand
if you’re a clawhammer player or the right-hand thumb if you’re a
bluegrass player.
2. Let the note ring for a moment.
3. While the open string is still sounding, push the string into a fretted
position just behind the second fret with the left-hand middle finger
(like a hammer).
You need to use enough speed with the left-hand finger so that the
sound isn’t cut off as your finger moves down to fret the string. You
should hear an uninterrupted sound from beginning to end of the
hammer-on, just as you do in the slide.
104
Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

That’s all there is to it. You’ve just played a hammer-on! Now you can try the
same hammer-on on the 3rd and 1st strings, moving from the open string to
the second fret on either string. Banjo players prefer to use fretted hammer-
ons (see the following section) instead of open hammer-ons for the 2nd
string, so you don’t need to worry about this string right now!
You can check out what these three hammer-ons look like in tablature (the h
indication tells you to play a hammer-on) by looking at Tab 5-4. And listen to
Track 27.
Tab 5-4: Playing fourth, third, and first string hammer-ons (Track 27).
Although you use some force to get your hammer-ons sounding right, try 
not to raise your left-hand finger too high above the fingerboard to achieve
this (it’s not like you’re a baseball pitcher in a wind up — after all, it’s just 
a hammer-on!). Keep your finger just above where you want to play the
hammer-on, with the finger in a position that’s fairly close to the banjo 
fingerboard (see Figure 5-1). When it’s time to play the hammer-on, you can
have more accuracy if your finger has to travel just a short distance to the
fingerboard.
Giving fretted hammer-ons a chance
Fretted hammer-ons are a little trickier than open-string hammer-ons (see
preceding section), because you’re coordinating the movements of two left-
hand fretting fingers. To get started, I want you to try one of the most awe-
some maneuvers you’ll ever play on the banjo: the world-famous “Foggy
Mountain Breakdown” 2nd-string hammer-on, and be sure to pay attention to
the mechanics because you use this same technique for fretted hammer-ons
on other strings:
1. Fret the 2nd string at the second fret with the index finger of the left
hand.
2. Play the 2nd string with either the index finger of the right hand 
(in clawhammer banjo) or the right-hand index finger or thumb (in
bluegrass).

Chapter 5: Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling: Adding the Left Hand

3. Let the note ring for a moment.
4. Bring down the left-hand middle finger just behind the third fret of
the 2nd string, using enough force to sound a new note, and hold the
middle finger down behind the third fret to let this string ring for a
moment also.
Give yourself a round of applause. You’ve just played two notes exactly like
Earl Scruggs plays them — just 99,999 to go! (For more info on Earl Scruggs,
check out Chapters 8 and 14.)
When you use this technique in bluegrass, you often play two of these
hammer-ons right in a row. Try practicing the fretted hammer-on on the 2nd
string many times in succession, keeping the left-hand index finger that’s fret-
ting the second fret down the entire time.
Now try this same hammer-on technique on the 3rd and 4th strings, again
moving from the second fret to the third fret. (Although you can also play
fretted hammer-ons on the 1st string, you don’t need to worry about it to
play any of the tunes in this book.) Check out the written fretted hammer-ons
on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th string in Tab 5-5, and listen to Track 28.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Tab 5-5: Playing fretted hammer-ons on the second, third and fourth strings (Track 28).
Pulling Off the Pull-Off
Like the hammer-on (see preceding section), the pull-off is another left-hand
banjo technique that carries a lot of potential firepower. A pull-off can explode
like a firecracker on the Fourth of July, be as mournful as a scorned lover’s
sigh, or as rhythmical as a horse’s gallop. It’s the most percussive of all the
left-hand techniques and is generally used to connect a higher melody note
to a lower note.
With the pull-off, the left-hand finger is already fretting a note on the banjo
fingerboard. You create a new note by giving the string a slight sideways pull
or push, either up or down (some folks use the term push-off for the latter
kind of pull-off, but I use the term pull-off in this book to refer to both kinds).
As your left-hand finger moves across the string, it snaps off the string liter-
ally sounding a note that can have as much power as a note played by a right-
hand finger.
In this section, I show you how you can play pull-offs either from a fretted to
an open string or from one fretted note to another on the same string. You
can also use the pull-off in a special way that’s unique to clawhammer style. I
cover it all in the following section!
For most folks, pull-offs are a bit trickier than slides or hammer-ons. If you lift
straight up off the string with your left-hand fretting finger, you likely won’t
snap the string with enough force for a strong enough pull-off note. The trick
is getting used to the very small sideways movement that’s also required of
the fretting finger to pluck the string. Keep reading for more on this movement.
Digging into open-string pull-offs
You can start by taking the open-string pull-off step-by-step (I show you how
to do it on the 1st string, but you can use this same technique on the 3rd and
4th strings):

Chapter 5: Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling: Adding the Left Hand

1. Fret the 1st string at the second fret with the middle finger of your left
hand.
2. Play the 1st string with your right hand.
Use the index finger if you’re playing clawhammer or your middle finger
if you’re playing bluegrass.
3. Let the fretted note ring for a moment.
4. Pull the string with your left-hand finger to sound the open string.
Your left-hand finger should move both sideways (to pluck the string)
and up.
Listen to the (hopefully) clear and beautiful sound of the open 1st string!
Banjo players don’t use pull-offs often on the 2nd string but nothing is hold-
ing you back from trying this same pull-off on the 3rd and 4th strings, transi-
tioning from the second fret to the open string, just as you did in the steps on
the 1st string.
In banjo tablature, the letter p lets you know that a pull-off is in your very
near future, as you can see in Tab 5-6. Give it a listen on Track 29 of the CD.
Tab 5-6: Playing open-string pull-offs on the 1st, 3rd, and 4th strings (Track 29).
Mastering fretted pull-offs
In addition to playing a pull-off to an open string (see preceding section), you
can also play a pull-off to another fretted note. With fretted pull-offs, you
want to make sure that you use your left hand to fret both notes at the same
time before executing a pull-off.
The 3rd-string pull-off from the third to the second fret is a defining charac-
teristic of the sound of bluegrass banjo. Here’s how you “pull-off” a 3rd-string
fretted pull-off (and be sure to note the technique, because you use this pro-
cedure for other strings as well):

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

1. Fret the 3rd string at both the third fret with the left-hand middle finger
and the second fret with your left-hand index finger (see Figure 5-2a).
2. Pull the string, moving both sideways and up, to avoid the 2nd string; as
you pull-off with the middle finger, keep the index finger in place on the
second fret (see Figure 5-2b).
3. Let the new note ring!
Now try this fretted pull-off on the 1st and 4th strings (using the 2nd string isn’t
common), pulling off from the third to the second fret as you did on the 3rd
string. You can take a gander at the tab for fretted pull-offs on the 1st, 3rd, and
4th strings in Tab 5-7, and listen to Track 30 on the CD.

Chapter 5: Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling: Adding the Left Hand

Sizing up special clawhammer pull-offs
You may want to use the pull-off in a way that’s unique to clawhammer banjo.
The technique is similar to what you play for an open string pull-off (see the
section “Digging into open-string pull-offs” earlier in this chapter), but in this
case, you don’t play the string with the right hand at all. The sound is created
only by the left hand moving across the string. This kind of pull-off is played
almost always on just the 1st string. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do
this special clawhammer pull-off:
1. Fret the 1st string at the second fret with the middle finger of your left
hand.
2. Without striking the string with the right hand, pull off the first string
with the middle finger of your left hand.
This pull-off emphasizes just the sound of the open string. Because a note
isn’t actually fretted, many players simply grab the string with their left-hand
finger (without actually bringing their finger all the way down to the finger-
board) and pull down from the 1st string.
110
Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 
Headbanger’s banjo: A heavy metal lick
You can play anything on the banjo — including
rock and roll! Listen to Track 31 on the CD and
check out the signature heavy-metal banjo lick
shown in Tab 5-8, which consists of a fretted
hammer-on followed by a pull-off. Repeat for as
long as possible or as long as your audience
can stand it (whichever comes first).
Note that you use only the right hand for the first
note of this lick, freeing up the right arm to make
lots of sweeping big stadium rock hand 
gestures. This endless (and some might say
mindless) lick can be played anywhere on the
neck (but probably shouldn’t really be played
anywhere).

Bending the Chokes
When you’ve got a serious case of the blues on the banjo, you’re going to be
playing some chokes on your instrument. This left-hand technique involves
pushing or pulling on a fretted note to raise its pitch and then releasing the
pressure to lower it back again. A choke is sometimes called a bend. (I could
have called this section “Choking the Bends,” but that sounded even worse
than what I came up with, don’t you think?) Blues and rock guitarists utilize
this technique all the time to imitate the cry of the human voice, but it sounds
equally great, if not better, on the banjo too, in my humble opinion. You can
discover how to play a choke in the following sections.
Playing the Foggy Mountain choke
The classic choke for bluegrass banjo players is once again from Earl
Scruggs’ “Foggy Mountain Breakdown.” The Foggy Mountain choke is way up
at the tenth fret of the 2nd string. Here’s a step-by-step guide to a Foggy
Mountain choke:
1. Place your left-hand index or middle finger at the tenth fret of the 2nd
string (see Figure 5-3a).
Using either finger is fine; try both and see which one is strongest for you.
2. Play the 2nd string with your right-hand index finger.
3. While the note is still ringing, push the 2nd string towards the 3rd
string with your left-hand finger while still maintaining enough fret-
ting pressure to hear a continuous sound (see Figure 5-3b).
This movement is called the choke. Remember that the pitch goes up as
you choke the string.
Most banjo players like to raise the pitch of this Foggy Mountain choke
the equivalent of almost two frets. You have to really bend the string to
do this — so much that the left-hand fingernail should come into contact
with the 3rd string and push it out of the way.
4. Release the fretting pressure from the left hand to mute the note and
return back to a normal fretted position, but don’t lift the left-hand
finger up off the string.
You’re now ready to repeat the sequence. Playing two or three chokes in
rapid succession in a song isn’t unusual, but this requires a lot of coordi-
nation! The trick to playing one choke after another smoothly is to
release the left-hand fretting pressure when a choke is done. This
111
Chapter 5: Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling: Adding the Left Hand

quickly returns the string — and your left-hand finger — back to the
starting position and readies you to play another choke.
In tablature, a Foggy Mountain choke is indicated with an upward arrow, as
you can see later in Tab 5-9.
Experimenting with choke variations
You can also try playing the standard Foggy Mountain choke in almost the
same way I describe in the preceding section, but this time, keep downward
pressure on the string as the finger returns to the normal position. This tech-
nique is called a choke and release. You should hear the pitch go up with the
choke and then come back down again with the release.
Another way to add expression to your playing with chokes is to bend the
string before striking it with your right hand, and then bring the pitch back
down to its normal fretted sound by releasing the choke (but still keeping
enough fretting pressure to sound the string!). This technique is called the
pre-choke, for obvious reasons.
In tablature, a choke and release is indicated with an arched arrow going up
and coming back down again, but a pre-choke is indicated with a line going
straight up from the note with an arched arrow moving downward, as you
can see in Tab 5-9 and hear on Track 32.

Tab 5-9: Playing chokes on the banjo: Foggy Mountain choke, choke and release, and pre-choke (Track 32).
Putting Your Hands Together
The slide, hammer-on, pull-off, and choke are key ingredients to great banjo
playing, but it’s not until you add these left-hand techniques to right-hand
picking that you can really begin to cook. After you’ve coordinated the move-
ments of the right and left hands together, you’ve taken a giant leap forward
as a banjo player.
In the following sections, I go over a few of the right-hand basics I cover in
Chapter 4 to make sure you’re ready to move on. Then you begin to put the
hands together to play short phrases that are some of the most important
building blocks of clawhammer and bluegrass banjo music.
You want to be totally comfortable with the right-hand patterns before
adding the left-hand techniques I discuss in this section. This means you
should be able to play the right-hand patterns consecutively without stop-
ping and without looking at the music. If you’re a bluegrass player, you
should be able to move from one roll to the next without interruption. If
you’re playing clawhammer, you want to have enough right-hand control so
that your finger can go to whatever first note or melody note you want to
play — and actually hit that note a great majority of the time. If you’re uncer-
tain about your right-hand skills, you may want to take a moment to go over
the info on right-hand patterns for clawhammer and bluegrass banjo, which I
cover in Chapter 4. (You can do it now, if you want. I can wait here.)
Make sure that you keep a constant rhythm with your right hand as you add
the left-hand techniques. Begin by playing the following exercises slowly,
building up speed as you gain confidence. Note that you play all the left-hand
techniques relatively quickly, finishing the technique before you play the next
note with the right hand. These slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and chokes are
indicated with either eighth or sixteenth notes in the tab examples. And be
sure to listen to the corresponding examples on the CD to internalize the
sounds of these rhythms.

Making sure your clawhammer 
right-hand is ready
Try the basic clawhammer right-hand technique (see Tab 5-10), playing
strings 4 through 1 for the melody note (which is what I call the first note
played in the basic pattern). You can hear an example on Track 33.
Tab 5-10: Playing basic clawhammer technique (Track 33).
Even though the tab indicates that the index finger plays the melody note
and the brush, don’t forget that you can use either the index or middle finger
for these techniques. You can also choose to brush across one, two, or three
strings, depending on how you want your playing to sound at that moment.
If you feel like you don’t quite have your clawhammer right-hand ready, head
back to Chapter 4 for a more detailed explanation of clawhammer right-hand
positioning and technique.
Double-checking your bluegrass 
right-hand skills
Get those fingerpicks on your right-hand thumb, index, and middle fingers
and warm up by playing the bluegrass right-hand patterns I introduce in
Chapter 4 (and if you didn’t know that bluegrass players use picks on their
fingers, definitely check out Chapter 4 right now before proceeding!).
Following Tab 5-11 and Track 34, mix it up by playing alternating thumb, 
forward-backward, and forward rolls — bluegrass style.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Joining forces: Using both hands 
in clawhammer banjo
Banjo players use slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and chokes most often to add
flavor or draw attention to melody notes. The first note you pick with basic
clawhammer right-hand technique usually corresponds to a melody note in
the song that you’re playing. That’s the note that’s going to get the royal left-
hand treatment.
In the following sections, you get to use all the left-hand embellishments I
cover earlier in this chapter together with the basic right-hand clawhammer
technique (from Chapter 4), adding up to some remarkable banjo sounds!
Clawhammer slides
You’ve probably mastered 4th-, 3rd-, and 1st-string slides (see the section
“Slipping into the Slide” earlier in this chapter). All of these slides work in
clawhammer banjo.
For each of the following examples, you want to execute the left-hand tech-
nique just after striking the string with the right hand, finishing the technique
before the brush. Practice each individual measure over and over again until it
feels comfortable and sounds smooth before moving on to the next measure.
You start by working on integrating the 3rd-string slide into clawhammer
technique, because you play this slide most often, and then you move on to
playing slides on the 1st and 4th strings.
3rd-string slides
Play the three 3rd-string slides from the section “Trying 3rd-string slides” ear-
lier in this chapter: the second- to the fourth-fret slide, the second- to the
third-fret slide, and the third- to the second-fret slide. Follow each slide with
an index or middle finger brush and a 5th string played by the thumb.

Chapter 5: Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling: Adding the Left Hand

1st-string slides
Play the two 1st-string slides I introduce earlier in this chapter: the fourth- to the fifth-
fret slide and the second- to the fifth-fret slide, following each slide with a right-hand
brush and 5th string to get the full clawhammer effect. See Tab 5-13 and listen to 
Track 36.
Tab 5-13: Playing 1st-string slides in clawhammer banjo (Track 36).
4th-string slides
The two 4th-string slides use the same fretted positions as the 1st-string slides (see
preceding section), but don’t be surprised if you have to fret the 4th string a bit
harder to make the notes really ring. See Tab 5-14 and listen to Track 37.
Tab 5-14: Playing 4th-string slides in clawhammer banjo (Track 37).
Clawhammer hammer-ons
If you know how to play a hammer-on, you’re now ready to put the hammer-ons to
work by integrating this technique into basic right-hand clawhammer playing (flip 
to the section “Nailing the hammer-on” earlier in this chapter for a refresher on
hammer-ons).
One key to quickly integrating the action of the hands together is to first gain mastery
over the skills required from each separate hand. Also, keep the rhythm of what you
play with the right hand steady no matter what happens when you add the left hand.
You can coordinate the activity of both hands much more quickly if you let the right
hand lead the way.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

The following exercises group the open hammer-ons together, followed by
the fretted hammer-ons:
Open-string hammer-ons
As you play the open-string hammer-ons from Tab 5-15 in the clawhammer
style, remember to repeat each individual measure over and over until it
sounds good to you, and then move on to the following measure. Your ulti-
mate goal is to play all three measures in succession without catastrophe,
much like what you can hear on Track 38.
Tab 5-15: Playing open-string hammer-ons in clawhammer banjo (Track 38).
Fretted hammer-ons
Fretted hammer-ons are always a bit tougher to play than open-string
hammer-ons, but you can master them with some dedicated practice. Try
your hand at the exercise in Tab 5-16, which you can hear on Track 39. With
this exercise, you’re at least moving from the second to the third fret on each
string to ease you in nice and slow.
Tab 5-16: Playing fretted hammer-ons in clawhammer banjo (Track 39).
Clawhammer pull-offs
You’re probably no stranger to 4th-, 3rd-, and 1st-string pull-offs by now
(especially if you went through the section “Pulling Off the Pull-Off” earlier in
this chapter). And — you guessed it — the pull-off works perfectly in claw-
hammer banjo.

Chapter 5: Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling: Adding the Left Hand

Don’t forget to make the pull-offs in the following sections really pop by
putting some energy behind your left-hand motion. You want to play the 
pull-off so that it’s rhythmically placed exactly between the first melody note
and the right-hand brush, as you can see in the accompanying tab.
4th-string pull-offs
In the clawhammer 4th-string pull-off exercise in Tab 5-17, you play an open-
string pull-off followed immediately by a fretted-string pull-off, both on the
4th string. Most players use their left-hand middle finger for both pull-offs.
Note that you move the middle finger from the second to the third fret for the
second measure of this exercise. Listen to the example on Track 40.
Tab 5-17: Playing 4th-string pull-offs in clawhammer banjo (Track 40).
3rd-string pull-offs
The left-hand fingering for these pull-offs in Tab 5-18 is the same as for the
4th-string variety (from the preceding section). Begin with an open-string
pull-off from the second fret to an open string and follow it up with a fretted
pull-off that begins at the third fret and ends on the second fret, as you can
hear on Track 41.
Tab 5-18: Playing 3rd-string pull-offs in clawhammer banjo (Track 41).
1st-string pull-offs
Clawhammer pull-offs work well on the 1st string too. However, don’t pull so
hard with your left hand as you execute the pull-off that you pull the string
off of the fingerboard! Give the exercise in Tab 5-19 a try, and listen to the
example on Track 42.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Tab 5-19: Playing 1st-string pull-offs in clawhammer banjo (Track 42).
Special clawhammer pull-off
What’s so special about this pull-off? This technique is clawhammer-only —
where you pull-off on the 1st string without hitting the string with the right
hand first (and that’s pretty special). The timing is the same as for all the
other pull-offs in this section.
Most players use their left-hand middle finger for this pull-off, positioning it
behind the second fret. You can play this pull-off after any initial melody note
in clawhammer banjo. In the exercise in Tab 5-20, you use the pull-off while
playing melody notes on the 2nd and 3rd strings. Give Track 43 a listen.
Tab 5-20: Playing the special clawhammer pull-off in clawhammer banjo (Track 43).
Clawhammer choke
Although the Foggy Mountain choke is usually the domain of bluegrass pick-
ers, it is also a very hip thing to play in clawhammer banjo, as you can see as
you play along with Tab 5-21. The secret to successfully integrating the choke
into right-hand clawhammer technique is to concentrate on keeping the right-
hand rhythm steady. Play very slowly at first to maximize the sound of the
bending pitch in each stroke and to work into your motor memory the coor-
dination required of the two hands. And it wouldn’t hurt to listen to the
example on Track 44.

Chapter 5: Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling: Adding the Left Hand

Keeping both hands busy 
in bluegrass banjo
Slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and chokes add tremendous excitement to
bluegrass banjo music. In the following sections, you can take a look at how
some of the left-hand techniques I introduce earlier in this chapter work with
the alternating thumb, forward-backward, and forward rolls from Chapter 4.
You’re taking a big step in your bluegrass education when you combine both
hands in these ways. Don’t forget to use the examples provided by the tabla-
ture and the accompanying CD as you work to gain mastery of these skills.
Bluegrass slides
Remember to keep the rhythm of your right-hand roll notes evenly spaced as
you add slides to the bluegrass roll patterns. Play the slide quickly, letting it
occupy the rhythmic space of one roll note. If you arrive at your destination
fret with the slide just about the time you strike the next string in the roll pat-
tern, you’re playing it like the pros!
In the following sections, try playing slides in combination with the various
right-hand roll patterns (for a refresher on how to play a slide, you can refer
to the section “Slipping into Slides” earlier in this chapter).
As with clawhammer banjo (see previous section), having good command
over the left- and right-hand techniques separately before you combine them
is important. (For a bit more practice, you can turn to Chapter 4 for the right-
hand instructions and to the sections on the specific left-hand techniques
earlier in this chapter.) When you’re ready to add the left hand, keep your
rhythm steady with your right-hand picking, and it should sound great!
Alternating thumb–roll slides
Try a second- to fourth-fret slide on the 3rd string, followed by a second- to
fifth-fret slide on the 4th string with the alternating thumb roll, using Tab 5-22
and Track 45 as a guide.
Tab 5-22: Playing slides with the alternating-thumb roll (Track 45).

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Forward-backward roll slides
Try the 3rd-string slide from the preceding section, but at the beginning of a
forward-backward roll. You then follow this with a 4th-string slide that starts
at the second fret and ends at the fifth fret. You can use Tab 5-23 as a refer-
ence and listen to Track 46 as well.
Tab 5-23: Playing slides with the forward-backward roll (Track 46).
Forward-roll slides
Using left-hand techniques with the forward roll is one of the trickiest blue-
grass banjo moves, but it’s well worth the effort, giving your playing an
authentic and hard-driving sound.
Try playing the forward-roll slides pictured in Tab 5-24. In this exercise, you
begin on the 3rd string in measures one and two, playing a second to fourth
fret slide. For measures three and four, play a 4th-string slide that starts on
the second fret and ends on the fifth fret. Note that after playing the 4th-
string slide for these last two measures, you finish the roll by playing two 3rd
strings with the right-hand index finger. Hear what I mean on Track 47.
Tab 5-24: Playing slides with the forward roll (Track 47).
Bluegrass hammer-ons
Many bluegrass banjo players place the hammer-on between the notes of the
roll pattern, especially on slower tempo songs. As the speed of a song
increases, you don’t have enough time in between your right-hand roll notes
to worry about this, and your hammer-on may occur at the same time as you
pick the next note in the roll. Both ways of playing the hammer-on are good —
as long as you maintain a consistent rhythm in your right hand, that is! You
can try out this technique in the following sections.

Chapter 5: Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling: Adding the Left Hand

Repeat each measure over and over until you’ve mastered each technique,
and then move on to conquer the next measure. Take things one step at a
time, and you’ll rule your own banjo kingdom in no time!
Alternating thumb–roll hammer-ons
Try mixing open-string hammer-ons and fretted hammer-ons in this exercise.
Begin with open to second-fret hammer-ons on the 3rd and 4th strings before
moving to second- to third-fret fretted hammer-ons, using the alternating-
thumb roll as shown in Tab 5-25 and demonstrated on Track 48.
Tab 5-25: Playing hammer-ons with the alternating thumb roll (Track 48).
Forward-backward roll hammer-ons
Whatever works in the way of hammer-ons for an alternating thumb roll (see
preceding section) also works for a forward-backward roll. In this exercise,
you play four different hammer-ons: open to second-fret hammer-ons on the
3rd and 4th strings and second- to third-fret fretted hammer-ons on these
same strings. Note how the reverse roll changes in measures two and four to
accommodate these 4th-string slides. Jump in and get your feet wet following
Tab 5-26 and listening to Track 49.
Tab 5-26: Playing hammer-ons with the forward-backward roll (Track 49).
Forward-roll hammer-ons
Try open and fretted hammer-ons on the 4th, 3rd, and 2nd strings with the
forward roll by giving the exercise in Tab 5-27 a go. Note that the strings you
play with the right hand change according to which hammer-on you choose
to play. In measure one, you begin the forward roll on the 4th string, but in
measure two, you start on the 3rd string. In the last two measures, you start
the forward roll on the 2nd string. It’s all on Track 50 of the CD.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Tab 5-27: Playing hammer-ons with the forward roll (Track 50).
Bluegrass pull-offs
Aggressive, gritty-sounding pull-offs, like you hear master players such as 
J. D. Crowe and Ron Block play, are a hallmark of traditional bluegrass style.
Professional players try to place pull-offs in between the notes of the roll pat-
tern, which requires some quick and precise communication to the left hand.
Start slowly with the exercises in the following sections and work up speed
as you gain confidence.
Alternating thumb–roll pull-offs
Try open-string and fretted pull-offs in the bluegrass style by using the alter-
nating-thumb roll (see Tab 5-28), taking note to how the notes you play with
the right hand change according to the pull-off that you choose to play with
the left hand. Listen to the example on Track 51.
Tab 5-28: Playing pull-offs with the alternating thumb roll (Track 51).
Reverse-roll pull-offs
You can mix things up a bit and start this roll with a second- to third-fret slide
on the 3rd string, followed by a third- to second-fret pull-off. (You can use Tab
5-29 and Track 52 as a guide.) Bluegrass players use this phrase frequently.
Note that at measures two and four, you can relax by playing the reverse-roll
pattern without these left-hand techniques.

Chapter 5: Sliding, Hammering, and Pulling: Adding the Left Hand

Forward-roll pull-offs
You can take that third- to second-string pull-off on the 3rd string and use it in
a forward roll, starting the measure with a fretted hammer-on on the second
to third fret, as you can see in Tab 5-30 and hear on Track 53.
Tab 5-30: Playing hammer-ons and pull-offs with the forward roll (Track 53).
Bluegrass chokes
When combined with the right-hand forward roll, that Foggy Mountain choke
can send listeners into paroxysms of wonder and joy (at least I think it’s
wonder and joy . . . I’m never quite sure, really!). This phrase, which you can
see in Tab 5-31 and hear on Track 54, is an intensely idiomatic bluegrass
banjo lick. Be sure to apply the left-hand choke each time you strike the 2nd
string.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Chapter 6
Working Up Your First Tunes:
Clawhammer and Bluegrass
In This Chapter
 Unearthing the melody notes
 Arranging melodies for clawhammer and bluegrass banjo
 Using slides, hammer-ons, and pull-offs to enhance solos
 Playing four clawhammer and bluegrass tunes
You’ve no doubt been waiting for this moment: You’re ready to step into
the spotlight and play your first melodies on the banjo! If you’ve worked
through the previous few chapters, you’re taking a big leap forward as you
move from just playing along with a tune to being able to actually play the
tune itself. In time, you’ll not only be someone who can accompany others,
but you’ll also be a soloist (or, in banjo speak, a picker).
The beauty and challenge of working up a good solo is integrating the melody
with the playing techniques that are unique to clawhammer and bluegrass
banjo, which is what I help you tackle in this chapter. I break down the
process of working up solos into a series of steps that can get you started
down the road to creating your own music. You discover the relationship
between scales and melodies and use this knowledge to more easily map out
a song on the banjo fingerboard. You then apply right-hand clawhammer and
bluegrass techniques to make this melody come alive. Next, you throw in left-
hand slides, hammer-ons, and pull-offs to turn your tune into great-sounding
banjo music.
I close the chapter by having you play clawhammer and bluegrass versions of
four well-known tunes that all banjo players like to play: “Boil Them Cabbage
Down,” “Cripple Creek,” “Goodbye Liza Jane,” and “Ground Hog.” You can
follow along by listening to tracks on the CD that accompanies this book and
by reading the banjo music (called tablature) that’s in this chapter. You’ve got
a lot of ground to cover, so get out your banjo, get in tune, and get started!

Finding the Melody
As unbelievable as it may sound, you can find folks out there who think that
all banjo music sounds alike. They even assert that you can tell one tune
apart from another only by its title (yes, a banjo joke is in here somewhere). 
I believe that our mission as banjo players should be to dispel this cultural
misunderstanding by trying to play as much of the melody as possible in
each song we play while still trying to make it sound like good banjo music.
Because the melody of each tune is unique, each banjo version of a song also
has the potential of being different.
A well-played banjo solo consists of a melody, but a lot more is usually going
on as well. You may also hear the cascade of rolling notes that accompanies a
bluegrass banjo solo or the percussive and syncopated brush and 5th-string
techniques clawhammer players use. The real wonder of banjo music is how
the melody can be expressed inside and through these techniques.
When you figure out a tab arrangement from a book (like, for instance, Banjo
For Dummies), the melody is already provided for you, but bringing out that
melody as you play the song so a listener can recognize it is still up to you.
With more playing experience, you can work up your own arrangements from
scratch. In this case, you have to locate the melody notes on your banjo on
your own and combine the melody with the left- and right-hand techniques
that you know can make your arrangement sound like good banjo music.
Either way, knowing how to bring out the melody of a song is a must.
Because melodies are made up of a series of notes that can be organized into
a scale, understanding just a little bit about scales can be a big help in finding
the melody notes to any song on your banjo (yes, this is a bit of formal music
theory, but I promise that you’ll be a better banjo player for it). Armed with
your scalar knowledge, you also have the opportunity to play a few tunes in
the following sections.
Starting with the scale
The first step in working up a banjo solo is to locate the melody notes of 
the tune on your fingerboard. Unless you’re moving straight to avant-garde
modern classical music (in which case, this may not be the right For Dummies
book for you), the majority of the melodies you encounter are made up of
just a few notes. If these notes are grouped from low to high, they almost
always form a scale.
126
Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

You can begin a scale on any string or on any fret of the banjo. Scales are
made up of a select group of notes on the banjo fingerboard, and different
types of scales group notes in different ways. Melodies can start at the begin-
ning, in the middle, or at the end of a scale.
Many advanced players, especially those interested in jazz on the banjo, take
the time to locate the notes of a particular scale in every position and on
each string of the banjo and learn all kinds of scales appropriate to this style
of music. So if you’re interested in playing jazz on the banjo, you better get to
know your scales.
The major scale is the most commonly used scale in much of the music of the
Western world as well as a great deal of banjo music (banjo music is part of
country and western music, after all). Most people have the sound of the
major scale thoroughly ingrained into their musical subconscious from years
of hearing and singing this scale in all kinds of songs. Do you remember Julie
Andrews singing “Do Re Mi” from The Sound of Music soundtrack? Okay,
maybe you don’t want to remember this, but at any rate, that song is all about
the major scale.
To get started with playing melodies on the banjo, all you really need to know
for now is how to construct a major scale. In the following sections, I show
you how to do just that.
Scaling one string: Discovering the G-major and D-major scales
You can create a major scale on any note on the fretboard by following the
formula in this section. The first note of the major scale indicates what kind
of major scale you’re playing.
For example, because many of the melodies you’ll be playing use the notes
found on the G-major scale, you can discover how to build a major scale by
starting on the open 3rd string, which just happens to be a G note. You then
travel up the 3rd string, finding all the notes of the G major scale (do - re - mi -
fa - so - la - ti - do!) as you climb up the neck of the banjo.
To uncover a G-major scale, begin by picking up your banjo and following
these steps:
1. Play the 3rd string open, and as you hear the sound of this note on the
banjo, try singing the same note.
Think of this note as the first note, or the “do” of a major scale. You can
also think of this note as the first note in the melody “Frère Jacques.”
2. Sing what you think the second note of the major scale should be,
using the syllable “re.”
127
Chapter 6: Working Up Your First Tunes: Clawhammer and Bluegrass

You can also think of this note as the second note in the melody “Frère
Jacques.”
3. Find this second note on your 3rd string.
Because it’s a higher note than the first note of the scale, you need to
fret this string. Compare what you’re singing (and hearing in your head)
to the sound of the fretted string. You can find a match for the second
note of the G-major scale, the “re” note, at the second fret.
4. Sing “do” and “re” again, but now also continue up the scale by
singing “mi,” the third note of the G-major scale.
This note is also the third note in the melody of your ol’ buddy “Frère
Jacques.”
5. Find this “mi” note on the 3rd string.
The match is at the fourth fret of the 3rd string.
6. Try singing the next note in the scale, the “fa” note, and try finding
this note on the 3rd string.
This isn’t the next note in “Frère Jacques,” by the way! You can find this
note at the fifth fret, only one fret up from the “mi” note.
If you continue singing the rest of the notes of the major scale (so - la - ti - do)
in this way and match the corresponding notes on the banjo’s 3rd string to
your singing, you end up with the scale in Figure 6-1 as it ascends up the
banjo’s 3rd string. And if you can’t sing, Figure 6-1 shows you the notes,
which you can hear on Track 55.
As you can see in Figure 6-1, the names of the musical notes in a G-major
scale are G / A / B / C / D / E / F# / G. However, when you’re playing the banjo,
you rarely think about the actual names of the notes — you don’t have
enough time to worry about this! Banjo players more often think about the
distances between the notes in a scale, as measured by the number of frets

between one note and the next and the sounds that they hear as they move
from one note to another. When you think of the G-major scale in this way,
the pattern shown in Figure 6-1 emerges.
Banjo players just love to play songs that use the G-major scale, but sooner
or later you also have to find your way around other scales. D major is also 
a popular key for music played on the banjo (and you can play “Arkansas
Traveler” in Chapter 9 with this scale). Using the same formula for finding a
G-major scale, you can also discover the D-major scale if you start on your
open 4th string D and choose the ascending notes. If you do it correctly, you
end up playing a D-major scale, shown in Figure 6-2. You can also listen to
Track 56 on the CD.
Bringing more than one string into play: The G-major scale
As you can probably guess, when you play melodies on the banjo, you don’t
usually run up and down just one string. It’s more economical to play the
higher notes of the scale on the 2nd and 1st strings and the lower scale notes
on the 3rd string. This limits the movement of the left hand to the lower frets
of the banjo and makes it a lot easier to quickly find the correct melody note.
Figure 6-3 provides a road map to the G-major scale as you can find it on the
3rd, 2nd, and 1st strings of your banjo.

Chapter 6: Working Up Your First Tunes: Clawhammer and Bluegrass

However, melodies often go below the starting point of the G-major scale,
using notes found on the 4th string. You can now add these 4th-string notes
to get the full picture of where you can find the notes of the G-major scale,
using all four strings on the lower frets of your banjo. Be sure to note that by
starting on the open 4th-string D, you’re still playing a G-major scale, but
you’re now catching some of the lower scale notes that you use when playing
melodies. Check out Figure 6-4 and listen to Track 57 on the CD.
Although knowing the names of all the notes on the fingerboard of your banjo
is an impressive feat (the kind of information that can certainly win you new
friends at the next banjo players’ cocktail party), this same info can be found
in Appendix A in the back of this book! Remembering this kind of information
isn’t crucial right now. Focus instead on knowing where the notes of the G-
major scale are located on the lower frets of your banjo and learn the sounds
of these notes.
Trying out a tune (or two)
After you’ve found the notes of the G-major scale on the lower frets of the
banjo (see preceding section), it’s now time to work out some melodies by
using this scale. Keep in mind that all the open, unfretted strings on your
banjo in this tuning are also notes in the G-major scale.
With your banjo at the ready, try playing the melody of “Frère Jacques,”
which you can find in Tab 6-1 and on Track 58 on the CD. “Frère Jacques”
shows the relationship between a melody and its scale: all of this song’s
melody notes are in the G-major scale. After playing this song, you can proba-
bly see how becoming familiar with this scale can make figuring out a melody
on the banjo much easier.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Tab 6-1: Playing the melody to “Frère Jacques” (Track 58).
Because you don’t have much of a chance of hearing “Frère Jacques” at a jam
session, you can try something a little closer to home with “Red River Valley.”
(If you don’t know this song, listen to Track 8 on the CD, where I sing the
song with a pinch-pattern accompaniment, which is covered in Chapter 3.)
I’d like for you to challenge yourself and make an attempt to figure out the
melody first by using your ears in a trial-by-error approach before you look 
at the tab for “Red River Valley.” This exercise trains your ears and brain to
locate the melody by using your familiarity with the G-major scale on the
banjo neck. Here’s a hint to help you get started: Play the open 4th string,
and then the open 3rd, followed by the open 2nd. These are the first three
notes of the tune. Now try to find the rest of “Red River Valley” on your fret-
board, using your memory of the melody or my sensitively beautiful vocal
rendition on Track 8 of the CD to guide you.
Don’t expect to get all the melody notes perfectly the first time around. As
you experiment, you can learn from your mistakes, so don’t be afraid to make
them!
Try playing your version of the melody to a loved one and see whether she
can guess what song you’re playing. Did she hear “Red River Valley”? I hope
so, but if not, that’s okay too. You’re just getting started with this process, and
coordinating your brain, hands, and ears to figure out a melody and play it
without stopping could take a while. Now, compare your version with the
arrangement in Tab 6-2 and Track 59 on the CD.
Finding the melody by ear is the first step towards working up a great banjo
solo. Remember to let your ear be your guide and keep in mind that not all
songs use the G-major scale. After you’ve figured out the basic melody, you
can then use it as your foundation to work up a more “banjoistic” version of
the tune.

Tab 6-2: Playing the melody to “Red River Valley” (Track 59).
Making Melody with Style
After you feel like you’ve got a handle on a basic melody (see preceding 
section), it’s then time to add right-hand clawhammer and bluegrass tech-
niques and make the melody really come alive. As you begin to play honest-
to-goodness, authentic-sounding banjo music, the excitement can really begin
to kick in (let me hear a resounding “Well, alright!”). So as you make melodies
in both the clawhammer and bluegrass styles in the following sections, hold
on tight!
If you need a quick right-hand techniques refresher before moving forward,
check out Chapter 4. And if your basic left-hand fretting techniques are giving
you any trouble, you may want to look over Chapters 2 and 5.
Starting with the right hand
As you work up a solo, using either clawhammer or bluegrass right-hand
technique, you want to preserve as much of the melody as possible so that
your listeners (and you) can keep track of what you’re playing. However, you
also want to keep the right hand flowing by incorporating the basic clawham-
mer technique or bluegrass roll patterns with as little interruption in the

music as possible. All players experience conflicts between these two goals
at times. Listening and learning from other players and experimentation is
the key to coming up with your own solutions.
Here are a few more tips to keep in mind as you start to work out melodies
for clawhammer and bluegrass banjo:
 Be flexible with the basic clawhammer technique and the bluegrass
rolls and adjust these patterns to play those strings where the melody
notes are located. For example, if the melody is on an open 2nd string,
make sure you play that note as part of your bluegrass roll pattern or
basic clawhammer technique. Also, use the right-hand techniques to
make the solo flow continuously, but don’t be afraid to stop and play a
few melody notes all by themselves if that’s what seems to work the best
at a given moment.
 Although playing those melody notes that occur on the first beat of a
chord change is a good idea, don’t worry about trying to hit every
melody note. Decide which notes are the most important and see how
you can adjust the right-hand patterns to play as many of these notes as
possible.
 Relate the chord progression to the melody. For instance, if the song’s
chord progression moves to a C chord, some of the melody notes will
very likely be the same as the fretted notes that are part of the chord
you’re playing. Fret the full chord first and then go hunting for those
melody notes.
 Jump at the chance to enhance the melody. Most melodies have some
notes that are held for a relatively long time, alternating with notes that
are shorter in duration. Long notes provide a great opportunity to con-
tinue playing either the basic clawhammer technique or a bluegrass roll
that accentuates that same melody note.
 Adjust your playing to the duration of the note. Maintaining a flowing
right-hand technique is more difficult in those passages with shorter
melody notes. In these cases, you may have to interrupt your basic
right-hand technique to play those notes, and then resume when the
melody notes are once again of longer duration.
 When playing with others, always try to hold up your end of the
rhythm. Playing in time and changing chords at the proper time is much
more important than playing a solo that expresses every melody note but
doesn’t maintain the correct rhythm or follow the chord progression.
Ready to use these tips in action? In the following sections, you get the chance
to add clawhammer and bluegrass right-hand techniques to the melody of
“Red River Valley” and play two different arrangements of this song. Don’t hes-
itate to use the tab and the CD together to help speed up the picking process.

Chapter 6: Working Up Your First Tunes: Clawhammer and Bluegrass

Getting a feel for the clawhammer way
Try playing the arrangement of “Red River Valley” in Tab 6-3 and Track 60,
using basic clawhammer right-hand technique to capture as many melody
notes as possible. You can refer back to the bare bones melody of “Red River
Valley” in the section “Trying out a tune (or two),” earlier in this chapter, to
compare and see how the clawhammer version differs.
Tab 6-3: Playing “Red River Valley” the clawhammer way (Track 60).
Taking on the melody bluegrass style
For some serious melody-making, try “Red River Valley” in bluegrass style,
using the alternating thumb, forward-backward, and forward rolls I indicate
in Tab 6-4. You can always find more than one way to capture a melody with
bluegrass rolls. The more you experiment with different solutions, the more
skilled you become in working out your own arrangements of tunes. But for
now, get the feel for a bluegrass melody by following along with my arrange-
ment and listening to Track 61.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Note in Tab 6-4 how the melody note often determines which roll works best
in each measure. For instance, in the first full measure (at the syllable “val-”
of the word valley), I selected a forward roll that features the open 2nd string
prominently, because at this point in the song, that’s the melody note. The
next measure has three melody notes (matching the lyrics “say you are”).
These melody notes are the open 2nd string (a B note), a 3rd string fretted at
the second fret (an A note), followed by an open-string B note once again. As
you can see, the forward roll changes to accommodate each of these melody
notes.
Tab 6-4: Playing “Red River Valley” bluegrass style (Track 61).
Adding the left hand
After you’re comfortable incorporating melody notes into clawhammer and
bluegrass right-hand technique (see preceding section), you can enhance
your solos by adding left-hand slides, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and chokes.
Because you use these left-hand techniques to draw attention to melody
notes, banjo players naturally use them when they need to make a melody
note really stand out in a solo.

Chapter 6: Working Up Your First Tunes: Clawhammer and Bluegrass

Here are a few additional guidelines on how to use these left-hand techniques
to make the melody really pop:
 If a melody note falls on an open 3rd, 2nd, 1st, or 5th string, that’s a
good time to play a slide or a hammer-on on a lower string that moves
up to the same pitch as the open string. For example, if the melody note
is on an open 3rd string, you can emphasize this same pitch by sliding
from the second to the fifth fret on the 4th string.
 If the melody moves down from one open string to the next, try a pull-
off or a backward slide on the lower string to facilitate this move-
ment. For instance, if the melody moves from an open 2nd string to an
open 3rd string, try a third- to second-fret pull-off on the 3rd string.
 If a melody needs a bluesy or bent note, call on your left-hand choke.
You can use chokes in much the same way as a slide to make a transition
from a lower to a higher note.
I’m still amazed how adding a bit of left-hand flash can enhance any arrange-
ment. In the following section, you can play two versions of “Red River
Valley” that both add slides, hammer-ons, and pull-offs to the basic right-
hand techniques of clawhammer and bluegrass banjo.
Creating clawhammer melodies
Try the arrangement of “Red River Valley” shown in Tab 6-5 and on Track 62
of the CD. In this version, you play slides, hammer-ons, and pull-offs to create
an even more authentic and exciting clawhammer banjo sound. In banjo tab-
lature, these techniques are indicated by letters below the tab staff: s stands
for slide, h for hammer-on, and p for pull-off.
Note that at measures 11 through 14 you’re first fretting a C chord and then a
D7 chord for two measures each. Sometimes you have to lift one of your fret-
ting fingers up to play an open string (as in the first note of measure 11) or
move a fretted note from one string to another to get ready for a slide (as in
the fourth note of measure 13, where you move your middle finger from the
3rd string, second fret to the 4th string, second fret).
Compare this arrangement with the version presented earlier in this chapter
as Tab 6-3 in the section “Playing Melody with Style” to explore how these
left-hand techniques can add more stylistic impact to an arrangement.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Tab 6-5: Playing “Red River Valley” the clawhammer way with slides, hammer-ons, and pull-offs (Track 62).
Playing the bluegrass way
Just as you can add slides, hammer-ons, and pull-offs to clawhammer banjo
arrangements, you can also add these same techniques to right-hand roll pat-
terns to create a more genuine bluegrass banjo sound. Give it a try by listen-
ing to Track 63 and playing the arrangement of “Red River Valley” in Tab 6-6.
Before tackling this bluegrass rendition of “Red River Valley,” you may want
to take a moment and look at the exercises in “Keeping both hands busy in
bluegrass banjo” in Chapter 5 to make sure you’re comfortable adding left-
hand embellishments to bluegrass roll patterns.
You may notice how incorporating these techniques in bluegrass style makes
your playing sound much closer to that of such greats as Earl Scruggs, Sonny
Osborne, and J. D. Crowe.

Part II: Let’s Pick! The Basic Ingredients 

Part III
Playing Styles
Past, Present, 
and Future

In this part . . .
I
take you beyond the beginners’ material and present
the historical roots of the banjo. I also explore the most
recent stylistic and technical innovations. I take you back
to the late-19th and early-20th centuries as you play two
minstrel-style tunes and two classic-era pieces. You also
get a more in-depth look at bluegrass style, exploring
Scruggs, melodic, and single-string techniques and licks.
And you can find a handful of great tunes scattered
throughout this part, just ready for the playing. 

Chapter 7
Playing Historical Styles: African,
Minstrel, and Classic Banjo
In This Chapter
 Discovering the banjo’s African heritage
 Getting acquainted with minstrel banjo style
 Playing in the classic banjo style
B
anjo players have a thing about history. They play old songs and sing a
lot about the “old days”; they like old instruments and playing things
the old-time way. When you pick up your banjo to play “Cripple Creek” or
“Soldier’s Joy” or sing the old ballad “Pretty Polly,” you become part of a
deep and enduring current of music history. Clawhammer and bluegrass
banjo, the two most popular ways of playing banjo today, have historical
roots that go back over 150 years to late 19th and early 20th century classic
banjo styles, mid-19th century minstrel banjo styles and to even earlier
African musical influences. These historical banjo styles are the subject of
this chapter.
Get ready to travel back in time to trace the African ancestry of the banjo and
explore the fascinating world of 19th and early-20th century banjo music. I
show you an African piece from the late 1700s along with some tunes in min-
strel style from the pre-Civil War years that are historical predecessors to
clawhammer banjo music. I also help you to test your skills with some pre-
bluegrass classic banjo ragtime from the early 20th century. Whatever style
of banjo you like to play, you can discover a whole new world of musical pos-
sibilities in these really old, historical sounds.
African-American Banjo Roots
The idea of stretching a skin tightly across a resonating chamber, attaching a
neck, adding one or more drone strings, and playing the resulting instrument
in a rhythmical and percussive manner originated with the West Africans 
who were forcibly imported as slaves to the New World. The first banjo-type

instruments were documented in the Caribbean as early as 1689, and the first
mention of the banjo in the American colonies occurs in 1754 (where it is
called a “banjer” in a Maryland newspaper).
What music historians know about early African and African-American banjo
music comes from what observers at the time had to say about banjo playing
and from artists’ drawings and illustrations of banjos and banjo players
(check out Sinful Tunes and Spirituals: Black Folk Music to the Civil War by
Dena Epstein [University of Illinois Press] for an excellent overview of this
documentation). Researchers also look to how Africans play banjo-type
instruments today for clues about historical African-American playing styles.
African and early African-American banjos consist of a gourd or a carved
wood body with a stretched skin head and usually little more than a stick for
a neck.
From early on, observers have commented on the complex and percussive
playing style Africans and African-Americans used to play the banjo, and you
can easily hear elements of this approach in modern clawhammer banjo play-
ing. Clawhammer players strike the strings by moving their right-hand index
or middle fingers down across the strings, in a very similar way to how many
West Africans make music on their own native banjo-type instruments today.
Most historians agree that this aspect of the American clawhammer approach
is the result of African influence.
Although you can’t know exactly what early African and African-American
music sounded like 200 or more years ago, you can play my arrangement of
an African tune that ended up in a 1782 collection of British Isles fiddle tunes!
Called “Pompey Ran Away,” this tune makes for a wonderful clawhammer
banjo piece (see Tab 7-1 and listen to Track 72).
Tab 7-1: Playing “Pompey Ran Away,” a clawhammer version of an 18th-century African tune (Track 72).

Part III: Playing Styles Past, Present, and Future 

This piece has many of the characteristics commonly heard in traditional
West African music. Each musical idea (or phrase) is made up of just a few
notes (each phrase occupies one measure of tab in this particular tune). The
second phrases of each line (which are the second and fourth measures of
each line) answer the first phrases (which are the first and third measures of
each line) in a call-and-response (or question-and-answer) relationship. Each
phrase also offers a slight variation on the phrase heard just before it as this
simple tune organically unfolds.
To play this tune using traditional clawhammer techniques, use the right-
hand index finger to strike the first and second strings with a downward
motion and let the right-hand thumb strike the 2nd 3rd, and 5th strings in a
downward direction. (For more on the world of clawhammer banjo, check out
Chapters 4 and 6.)
Converging Cultures: The 
World of Minstrel Banjo
When Africans and Europeans came together in North America, they had
enough similarity in their ideas and attitudes about music for a new musical
synthesis to occur despite the dramatically unequal status of black and white
populations. In large part, the history of American music, from minstrelsy to
jazz, rock ’n’ roll to rap music, is the story of this continuing convergence of
musical sensibilties.
Uncovering the historical background
The mid-19th-century minstrel banjo is one of the first manifestations of the
meeting of these musical worlds. Along with the fiddle, the banjo was the
most popular instrument in African-American music in the United States
through the 18th and into the 19th century. A 19th-century banjo is shown in
Figure 7-1. In the early 1800s, white musicians began to take up the banjo in
imitation of southern African-American players. By the mid-1800s, white pro-
fessional stage performers had popularized the banjo all across the United
States and in England and had begun their own banjo traditions as they popu-
larized new songs. Because these musicians usually performed with black-
ened faces, they came to be known as blackface minstrels.

Chapter 7: Playing Historical Styles: African, Minstrel, and Classic Banjo

In 19th century minstrel banjo, African elements — the instrument itself, the
right-hand playing technique, and the use of varied and complex rhythms —
combined with the musical influence of the British Isles as exhibited in song
form, repertoire, and the use of harmony to create a uniquely American musi-
cal phenomenon.

Part III: Playing Styles Past, Present, and Future 

Because the minstrel stage depicted slaves and southern life in inaccurate
and degrading ways, there are many negative aspects to the legacy of black-
face minstrelsy. Nevertheless, as part of America’s first nationally popular
music, minstrelsy served to popularize the banjo and make it an instrument
shared by both white and black populations. With this popularity came the
publication of the first instruction manuals for the instrument and the first
factory-made banjos in the 1840s. Soon after, five strings became the
accepted norm for banjos.
Getting into minstrel banjo
As you play tunes using techniques that date from the 1840s, the sound of
minstrel banjo opens a door to the instrument’s past where you can hear and
feel the echoes of the banjo’s shared African and European heritage. If you’re
a clawhammer player, it should be an easy transition to minstrel style, as
most of the playing techniques are similar for both approaches.
Although you can purchase a replica of a fretless 19th-century banjo, you 
can play the minstrel repertoire on any five-string instrument, fretted or not.
Minstrel banjos are also usually strung with gut or nylon strings and are
tuned several steps lower than the conventional tunings used by banjo play-
ers today. However, you can play these pieces with any kind of strings on
your banjo, and in this section, I show you how to play in the minstrel style
by staying as close to conventional G tuning as possible.
Discovering drop-C tuning
Minstrel banjo uses a tuning that’s close to the familiar G tuning, but the 4th
string is lowered in pitch the equivalent of two frets from a D to a C (see
Chapter 2 if you need help with getting your banjo into G tuning). Usually
called drop-C tuning, this technique is used in other popular banjo tunes like
“Home Sweet Home” and “Farewell Blues.” You also use drop-C tuning in clas-
sic banjo, so it’s good to know this tuning even if your plans aren’t to become
a great minstrel player!
If your banjo is already in G tuning, lowering the 4th string from a D to a C is
easy. Simply loosen the tension on the 4th string so that the pitch is lowered
from a D to a C#, and then keep going until your electronic tuner indicates
that you’ve reached a C note. If you’re trying this by ear, congratulations!
That’s definitely the old-time way, and in this case, you want to lower the 4th
string so that it matches the 3rd string in pitch when you fret the 4th string at
the seventh fret.
149
Chapter 7: Playing Historical Styles: African, Minstrel, and Classic Banjo

Unfortunately, after you’ve lowered that 4th string to C, there’s a real good
chance that the rest of your banjo will be out of tune. If that’s the case, touch
up the other strings by making sure that your 3rd string is tuned to G, the
2nd string to B, the 1st string to D and the 5th string to G.
Mastering minstrel technique
Minstrel banjo uses many of the same techniques used by clawhammer banjo
players and it’s a good idea to know basic clawhammer technique well before
venturing into minstrel-banjo territory. As with clawhammer, in minstrel
banjo, you move downward across the strings with your index or middle fin-
gers to strike most melody notes, and you use your thumb for the fifth string. 
Minstrel banjo also frequently uses double-thumbing patterns, a right-hand
technique that is also used in advanced clawhammer banjo. In double-
thumbing, the thumb not only plays the fifth string but also catches melody
notes on the inside strings (for a review of basic clawhammer technique, visit
Chapter 4). 
You also encounter these new challenges with minstrel banjo:
 Triplets: Minstrel banjo frequently juxtaposes different kinds of 
rhythms — sometimes in the same measure. A triplet is a rhythm 
where you play three notes within a musical space normally occupied 
by two notes. Say “trip-o-let” while tapping your foot on the syllable
“trip” and you’ve got the idea of a triplet.
 Dotted notes: A dot after a note indicates that the note’s durational
value is to be increased by half. If you increase the value of one note,
you usually have to make the next note shorter by an equal amount.
Dotted notes result in a more abrupt and syncopated rhythm, as heard
in ragtime music. 
For example, if you’re playing two eighth notes, these notes would be
counted as “1 +” (or “1 and”) with each note having the same duration.
However, if you increase the rhythmic value of the first note by one half
(and give that note a dot in the tab notation), this new note would be
three times as long as the second note (which would then be given
another flag in tab notation, changing its value from an eighth note to a
sixteenth note). These two notes are now counted as “1 e + uh” with the
first note played on the “1” and the second note played on the “uh.”
Trying some minstrel tunes
Are you ready for some banjo time travel by attempting a few tunes in the min-
strel style? Both tunes in this section utilize the double-thumbing techniques
150
Part III: Playing Styles Past, Present, and Future 

discussed in the preceding section in addition to employing more conven-
tional right-hand clawhammer patterns and left-hand pull-offs (for more info
on pull-offs, see Chapter 5).
“Juba”
“Juba” is from Frank B. Converse’s New and Complete Method for the Banjo, an
instruction manual first published in 1865. Juba was also the name given to a
popular minstrel dance as well as to this tune. This piece, a simple theme and
variation, was often used in the instructional manuals to teach the basic min-
strel technique, and it’s a great way to practice your double-thumbing (see
Tab 7-2 and listen to Track 73).
Tab 7-2: Playing “Juba,” a minstrel banjo piece from 1865 (Track 73).
Note the use of the right-hand thumb on the second string throughout “Juba.”
Measures 5 and 6 alternate fifth string and second string notes, all played by
the thumb, providing a real 19th-century workout!
“Hard Times”
“Hard Times” is a piece from Briggs’ Banjo Instructor published in 1855 (see
Tab 7-3). Note that the time signature to this piece is 6/8, which means there
are six main beats per measure in this tune with an eighth note equaling one
beat (or one count). Use a bit more right-hand punch to play the notes that
fall on the “one” and “four” (as in ONE-two-three-FOUR-five-six) and you’ll
really make this tune come alive. Don’t forget to listen to Track 74 on the CD
to get the right feel for this tune.

Chapter 7: Playing Historical Styles: African, Minstrel, and Classic Banjo

Tab 7-3: Playing “Hard Times,” a minstrel piece from 1855 (Track 74).
Branching Out With Classic Banjo
In 1865, Frank B. Converse introduced the guitar style to the minstrel banjo
world, adapting the right-hand finger-picking techniques used by 19th-
century guitarists to the banjo and presenting a new way to play music on
the banjo. In the guitar style, the right-hand fingers pick up on the strings as
in bluegrass banjo (see Chapter 4 for an introduction to right-hand technique
in bluegrass), rather than downward on the strings as in minstrel and
clawhammer banjo (see the section “Mastering minstrel technique” earlier in
this chapter).
The guitar style soon eclipsed the minstrel banjo in popularity with those
mid- to late-19th century players who preferred to learn their banjo music
from sheet music. By the early 1900s, a vast repertoire of banjo pieces were
written and arranged in what is now called classic banjo style.
Classic banjo offers everything from Sousa marches to arrangements of classi-
cal works to ragtime pieces. Of special interest to banjo players are composi-
tions written specifically for the instrument by American and English banjo

composers such as Joe Morley, Alfred Cammeyer, and Parke Hunter in the
late-19th and early-20th centuries. A great deal of technical expertise is
required to play many of these pieces, which were often performed with
piano accompaniment or perhaps played by a banjo duo or trio. In these
days, there were even entire banjo orchestras made up of — you guessed 
it — many, many different-sized banjos playing orchestral scores. Amazing,
isn’t it?
Classic banjo refers not only to a specific repertoire (those pieces written or
arranged between approximately 1880 and 1920) but also to a specific way of
playing these pieces on the banjo. In the following sections, you’re introduced
to the ways of classic banjo and get the chance to try your hand at a few
beginners classic pieces. 
Understanding classic banjo technique 
Bona fide classic players use their bare fingers to play (no fingerpicks!) and
employ open-back instruments strung with nylon or gut strings. However, it’s
fine to use whatever kind of banjo you have handy to get started. Most clas-
sic pieces (including the two examples to follow) are in drop-C tuning, as in 
minstrel banjo (see the section “Discovering drop-C tuning” earlier in this
chapter).
Although all five fingers of the right hand are sometimes required to play
some passages in classic banjo music, the thumb, index finger, and middle
fingers are the ones you most often use to play this style (similar to bluegrass
banjo). Like the ragtime piano compositions of Scott Joplin (like “Maple Leaf
Rag” or “The Entertainer”), classic banjo pieces often consist of several con-
trasting sections in different keys and use many up-the-neck chords. For
these reasons, the best classic banjo players are very familiar with the loca-
tion and left-hand fingering of notes and chords on the banjo neck. The best
way for you to follow in these footsteps is to play as many pieces as possible,
internalizing new fretted positions as you tackle new pieces. 
If you’re really going to get into classic-style playing, you should become
comfortable with reading conventional music notation, because the great
majority of pieces use regular music rather than banjo tablature. Check out
Music Theory For Dummies by Michael Pilhofer and Holly Day (Wiley) for
more information on reading conventional music notation as well as a lot of
other useful information that comes in handy for whatever banjo style you
choose to play.
153
Chapter 7: Playing Historical Styles: African, Minstrel, and Classic Banjo

Introducing yourself to the classics 
If you’re a bluegrass player, you can be right at home with many of the right-
hand finger-picking techniques used in classic banjo. However don’t be sur-
prised if you find that these pieces are challenging. Classic banjo pieces are
typically longer than bluegrass pieces, with a lot of material to memorize
(you don’t usually improvise on classic pieces — you play them as they
appear on the printed page, adding your own expression and feeling). 
Also, prepare your left hand for a good workout as you travel up and down the
neck in the following pieces. Listen to the CD as you carefully work through
the tabs, but above all, have fun with these sounds from a century ago!
Don’t forget to tune your fourth string down to C for both of the following
classic pieces. Your playing will sound a lot better that way!
“Colorado Buck Dance”
A. H. Nassau-Kennedy’s “Colorado Buck Dance” is taken from Turner’s Banjo
Budget series from around 1898. This piece is a great introduction to classic
banjo, as you can hear on Track 75. In Tab 7-4, I give you the tune’s first two
sections. You may find some of the right-hand work a challenge, especially as
you use your right-hand index and middle fingers to play consecutive notes
on the first string in the second section (as in measures 10, 12, and 16).
“Banjoisticus”
Tab 7-5 presents two sections of a piece from 1909, “Banjoisticus,” written by
Philadelphia banjo orchestra leader and composer Paul Eno, one of the best
composers of classic banjo music. This tune has strong ragtime leanings and
is typical of the kinds of banjo pieces enjoyed in the United States at the turn
of the last century by listening to cylinder recordings (these were the first
“records” and were played on a phonograph with a needle, but were cylindri-
cally shaped rather than flat as their latter-day predecessors, the 45 rpm and
LP record — remember those?). Anyway, give it a listen on Track 76 of the CD.
154
Part III: Playing Styles Past, Present, and Future 
The American Banjo Fraternity
If you’re serious about playing classic banjo,
you should consider joining the American Banjo
Fraternity, the group that’s dedicated to the
preservation of this banjo style. I guarantee that
there are no hazing rituals or beer runs with this
fraternity; however, you get access to boatloads
of sheet music, and you’ll be welcomed by other
classic players who are glad to share their
expertise. The ABF hosts two get-togethers
each year, usually in either New York state or
Pennsylvania, and these gatherings bring
together the best classic style players in the
United States. The organization also publishes
two newsletters annually (containing music!) to
its members (you can find this organization on
the Web at www.abfbanjo.org).

Part III: Playing Styles Past, Present, and Future 

Chapter 8
Playing Three-Finger Styles:
Scruggs, Melodic, and 
Single String
In This Chapter
 Getting deeper into Scruggs-style banjo
 Branching out with melodic style
 Discovering single-string-style banjo
 Using three-finger techniques together
F
rom bluegrass to jazz, country, classical, folk, and rock, the banjo is right
at home in all kinds of music today (okay, maybe not Wagnerian opera . . .
not yet, anyway!). Three-finger style (where you use the thumb, index, and
middle fingers of the right hand to strike the strings) is the playing technique
that’s being used to blaze most of these new trails for the banjo these days.
Three-finger banjo is usually associated with the bluegrass banjo style that was
first developed by North Carolina banjo player Earl Scruggs. Earl Scruggs’s
banjo style is based around capturing the melody using right-hand roll pat-
terns that create a bold, fast flurry of notes. Scruggs ushered in a banjo revo-
lution in the mid-1940s when he introduced this technique to bluegrass and
country music. Scruggs style is one of the most emulated playing styles in the
world — on any instrument — and has truly become a universal way of play-
ing music on the banjo (yes, if aliens were to play the banjo, it would proba-
bly be in Scruggs style — it’s that good!).
Succeeding generations of players have built on Earl’s contributions to come
up with new three-finger possibilities that continue to expand the musical
potential of the banjo. Melodic and single-string styles are the most impor-
tant of these innovations. Both approaches enable you to more easily use
scales in your playing (scales are the collections of notes you use to play
melodies). In melodic style, you play scales and melodies by using roll pat-
terns that are similar to those used in Scruggs style. With single-string playing,

you use a technique that enables you to play notes on the same string con-
secutively when needed, much like guitar and mandolin players do when
playing with their flatpicks.
To play the Scruggs, melodic, and single-string styles I describe in this chap-
ter, you use a thumb pick and two finger picks on your fingers as well as the
right-hand position favored by bluegrass players. If you’re new to the banjo,
you may want to visit Chapter 4 to get a feel for these topics before jumping
into the great music that awaits you here.
Playing Scruggs-Style Banjo
Overestimating the contribution of Earl Scruggs to the world of the banjo is
impossible. Although other players used three-finger techniques before him,
Scruggs took this way of playing the banjo and perfected it, literally creating
a entirely new musical vocabulary for the banjo that enabled him both to
play blazing-fast solos and to accompany others in a bluegrass band. (To
read more about Earl Scruggs’s life and music, check out Chapter 14.)
Scruggs style is practically synonymous with bluegrass-banjo style. If your
goal is to someday play banjo in a bluegrass band, you need to soak in as
much of Earl’s playing as you can. Scruggs-style banjo is also an essential
foundation for playing melodic and single-string styles, and Earl’s techniques
are also great to use when accompanying others. If you want to play any
three-finger style that uses fingerpicks, you just about have to get into Earl!
Some great fun lies ahead! In the following sections, you discover the right-
hand patterns used in Scruggs-style banjo and use these patterns to play
short interchangeable phrases called licks by using left-hand slides, hammer-
ons, and pull-offs. You then combine these phrases to play full-length banjo
solos and songs in Scruggs style.
Flowing with the rolls
Much of Scruggs-style playing is based around roll patterns — right-hand
sequences of notes that crop up again and again when playing in this style.
Roll patterns are made up of eight notes played by the right-hand thumb,
index, and middle fingers. As a general rule, you use a different right-hand
finger to strike a different string for each consecutive note when playing a roll
pattern (in other words, you don’t want to use the same right-hand finger or
hit the same string twice in a row). This way of playing creates a smooth and
constant flow of notes and is a big part of what make Scruggs-style banjo
sound so great.
158
Part III: Playing Styles Past, Present, and Future 

I include the most important roll patterns used in Scruggs-style playing in the
following list, which you can see in Tab 8-1. Players often categorize rolls by
the sequence of right-hand notes played (using T for thumb, I for index, and
M for middle), along with the string sequence used (with numbers standing
for each of the five strings on your banjo), which is what I do here:
 Alternating thumb roll: The right-hand sequence of this roll is T - I - T -
M - T - I - T - M. Use this sequence with the following string order: 3 - 2 - 
5 - 1 - 4 - 2 - 5 - 1.
 Forward-backward roll: This roll’s right-hand sequence is T - I - M - T -
M - I - T - M and uses a string order of 3 - 2 - 1 - 5 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 1. Note that this
roll begins like the alternating-thumb roll but moves in a new direction
with the third note you play.
 Forward roll: This roll is very exciting to play in bluegrass banjo. You
can play with more power if you kick off the roll by using your right-
hand thumb, as indicated in the tab’s right-hand sequence: T - M - T - I -
M - T - I - M. This example uses the following order of strings: 2 - 1 - 5 - 2 -
1 - 5 - 2 - 1.
 Forward-reverse roll: This roll starts with the same sequence of right-
hand notes that you use in the forward roll but then shifts to the
sequence used in the last four notes of the forward-backward roll: 
T - M - T - I - M - I - T - M. The string order for this example is 3 - 1 - 5 - 
3 - 1 - 3 - 5 - 1.
 Foggy Mountain roll: Yes, this is the roll used to play the first measures
of “Foggy Mountain Breakdown”! Be careful to play the first four notes of
this roll correctly: begin with the right-hand index finger striking the
second string and the middle finger playing the first string but then be
sure to use the thumb to strike the next second string. This approach
will provide you with more speed and power as you get comfortable
playing this roll. The right-hand sequence is I - M - T - M - T - I - M - T,
playing these strings: 2 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 5 - 2 - 1- 5.
 Backward roll: This roll begins with the middle finger and moves back-
wards towards the fifth string. Note the right-hand sequence for this roll:
M - I - T - M - I - T - M - I. The strings indicated in the tab example are 1 - 2
- 5 - 1 - 2 - 5 - 2 -1.
 Middle-leading roll: As you might have guessed, there are a lot of
middle fingers used in this roll pattern as revealed in the right-hand
sequence: M - I - M - T - M - I - M - T. The strings you’ll play in this exam-
ple are 1 - 2 - 1 - 5 - 1 - 2 - 1- 5.
 Index-leading roll: This roll begins with the right-hand index finger play-
ing the second string. The right-hand sequence for this roll is: I - T - I - M -
I - T - I - M. The strings played in this example are 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1.

Part III: Playing Styles Past, Present, and Future 

Listen to Track 77 to hear the sound of each roll and to double-check your
playing against these tab examples.
Practice these rolls until they become second nature. You can then cover
ground much faster when you encounter these roll patterns in actual tunes. If
any of these patterns are new to you, try using them as an accompaniment to
“Red River Valley” by playing along with CD Track 24. (For more on how to
play along with songs, visit Chapter 4.)
Making your music hot with some licks
In Chapter 5, I show you how to add left-hand slides, hammer-ons, and pull-
offs to the right-hand roll patterns to begin making some real banjo music.
Scruggs-style playing is based around creating music that uniquely combines
these elements. As you listen and play pieces in this style, you may begin to
notice short phrases that appear in more than one tune. These phrases, called
licks, are the building blocks of Scruggs-style banjo. In the following sections,
you can figure out what licks are and how to play them Scruggs style.
Figuring out the basics about licks
A short phrase that can be lifted out of one tune and played in another is
called a lick (a hot lick is a particularly great-sounding phrase that is perfectly
acceptable to play in public or even in front of your parents). Licks are used
in melodic and single-string playing as well, but are especially at home in
Scruggs style. Licks make your playing sound more interesting and varied
and are essential elements to improvising on the banjo.
You can sometimes use licks as part of a melody, but often licks stand by
themselves as good things to play on the banjo even when they aren’t neces-
sarily related to the melody of the song that’s being played. Becoming com-
fortable integrating licks into melodies and knowing which licks can be used
at what points in a song takes a lot of playing experience and a lot of listening
to other good banjo players.
Using licks in your playing
Licks are almost always associated with chords. For example, you play G
licks at that part of the song where the accompaniment is a G chord; you use
C licks when everyone else is playing a C chord, and so on.
161
Chapter 8: Playing Three-Finger Styles: Scruggs, Melodic, and Single String

Each lick is a bit different, depending on which chord goes along with it and the
specific roll patterns and left-hand techniques you use. When you encounter
a new lick in tablature, do the following:
1. Figure out the right-hand pattern indicated in the tab and practice this
by itself until it sounds steady and solid (if you can memorize the
right-hand sequence as you play, all the better!).
2. Add whatever left-hand techniques the tab shows (slides, hammer-ons,
or pull-offs) while maintaining a solid rhythm in your right hand.
The best way to figure out whether a lick works in a particular place in a song
is to try it and see what happens. You usually know pretty quickly whether
you’ve played something that works by the expressions on the faces of the
other musicians around you! And for the songs in this book, don’t forget to
listen to the corresponding CD track and aim to match your sound to what
you hear me play on the recording.
By listening to Tracks 78, 79, and 80 on the CD (and using Tabs 8-2, 8-3, and
8-4), play a group of essential licks for the G, C, and D chords — the three
most frequently played chords in bluegrass banjo music. These phrases pop
up time and again in the playing of Earl Scruggs, Sonny Osborne, and other
bluegrass masters.
The process of adding licks to your musical vocabulary is a lot like adding
new words and phrases when mastering a foreign language. In both cases,
you expand the range of your expression as you internalize new things to say
and new ways of saying them. After a lot of practice, you can combine licks
into original phrases and come up with your own unique musical thoughts.
Incorporating fill-in licks
A special kind of lick that’s frequently played at the end of a banjo solo or
used in accompaniment when a singer takes a breath or pauses between the
lines of a song is called a fill-in lick. This lick is especially useful to have in
your grab bag of banjo tricks.
To play fill-in licks, you utilize the same techniques and roll patterns that you
use for regular licks (see previous sections). However, fill-in licks tend to pack
more left-hand techniques into the same amount of musical space as a regu-
lar lick and for this reason can be more challenging to play.

By playing Tab 8-5 (and listening to CD Track 81), you can get a feel for the
four common fill-in licks that you use when you return to the G chord at the
end of a tune’s chord progression. You use at least one of these fill-in licks
just about every time you play a song in the key of G.

Combining licks to play a solo
You can build entire solos by stringing licks together. Although you probably
won’t be able to capture much of the melody of a song this way, following one
lick with another is great survival strategy to use in a jam session as you fake
your way through a song that you don’t really know. Don’t forget to make
sure that your lick matches the chord that everyone else is playing!

You can see how this strategy works by creating a solo from the licks I pre-
sent in the previous two sections. You can see (and play) it for yourself in
Tab 8-6 (Track 82). The chord progression is an eight-measure cycle made up
of two measures of G, followed by two measures of C, and then two measures
of D, ending with two measures of G.
Tab 8-6: Creating a solo by combining licks (Track 82).
Progressing to Scruggs-style songs
As you gain confidence playing licks and combining them to create longer
phrases, you eventually want to use the licks you know to create and
enhance the melodies of songs. The following two tunes show you just how
this can be done.
“Everyday Breakdown”
Because this song is made up of a number of essential two-measure phrases
commonly used for the G, C, and D chords, “Everyday Breakdown” can get
you started in your quest to create longer phrases and play entire songs by
combining licks.
Many bluegrass banjo solos begin with a short, characteristic phrase that
propels you into the main melody. These phrases are called kick offs.
“Everyday Breakdown,” which you can see in Tab 8-7 (Track 83), uses a 
three-note kick off that also works with “Foggy Mountain Breakdown.”

“Shortening Bread”
To conclude this section on Scruggs style, you can take a look at my arrange-
ment of a melody that Earl played often on radio and television broadcasts in
the 1950s and ’60s. “Shortening Bread” is the familiar melody you may have
first heard as a child (“Mama’s little baby loves shortening, shortening/Mama’s
little baby loves shortening bread”).
Sometimes trying to capture the melody of a song in the simplest and most
elegant way possible is best — something that Earl Scruggs seemed to do
with ease just about all the time. I’ve tried to continue in Scruggs’s footsteps
with my arrangement of “Shortening Bread” in Tab 8-8 (Track 84).

Tab 8-8: Playing “Shortening Bread” (Track 84).
Making Music with Melodic Banjo
Although Scruggs style (see preceding section) is just about the most logical
and ingenious technique ever created to play music on the banjo, you unfor-
tunately can’t play everything in this way. Because you strike a different string
with each roll note in Scruggs style, playing note-for-note versions of a
melody that happens to contain lots of consecutive notes adjacent to one
another in a scale can sometimes be difficult.
In the early 1960s, bluegrass banjo players Bill Keith and Bobby Thompson
were independently working on solving this problem as they tried to find a
way to play fiddle tunes more easily in a three-finger style on the banjo.
These musicians came up with a new way of playing scales on the banjo
called melodic banjo, where a different string is picked with each successive
note, as in roll pattern–based styles of playing.
Melodic banjo is great to use as an addition to Scruggs style within bluegrass.
This way of playing, which I describe in the following sections, gives you a
new set of three-finger tools that you can apply to all kinds of music and also
use in improvising. In addition to playing complex melodies with this approach,
you can also create virtuosic improvisations that rival the best work of any
jazz improviser!

Chapter 8: Playing Three-Finger Styles: Scruggs, Melodic, and Single String

Melodic style banjo is a real attention getter and is great for playing melodies
that can’t easily be played by using Scruggs style and for improvising.
However, when it comes time to playing with others, you should rely on the
roll patterns and techniques used in Scruggs style to provide the most appro-
priate accompaniment (see Chapters 4 and 12 for Scruggs-style accompani-
ment ideas).
Discovering how to play melodic scales
Although Scruggs style uses right-hand roll patterns as the basic building
blocks of banjo technique, melodic banjo is based on finding and playing
scales up and down the neck.
In Chapter 6, I locate all the notes for the G-major scale on the first five frets
of the banjo (so if you want some additional scale info, you may want to turn
to that chapter). In this section, instead of labeling the notes with the sylla-
bles “do - re - mi” as the Von Trapp Family Singers might do, I’m going to be
more scientific and assign numbers to each step of the scale, with the
number 1 indicating your starting point on the G note, as shown in Tab 8-9.
Tab 8-9: Assigning numbers to the notes in the G-major scale.
Note in Tab 8-9 how many consecutive scale notes are located on the same
string (for instance, scale notes three and four are both on the 2nd string
while scale notes five, six, seven, and eight are all on the 1st string). With the
melodic banjo approach, you play the same pitches, but you locate each con-
secutive note on a different string, using a different right-hand picking finger
to play each string, as you can see in the following sections.
Beginning with the melodic banjo G-major scale
The secret to playing a melodic banjo G-major scale is to relocate the fretted
notes in Tab 8-9 to a lower string on your banjo (these are notes two, four,
six, and seven of the G-major scale). You can then play different strings con-
secutively as you climb up the scale, using right-hand roll patterns that are
related to Scruggs’ rolls.
For example, the second note of the G scale (called an A note) is not only
found on the second fret of the 3rd string, but is also at the seventh fret of
the 4th string. The fourth note of the G scale, the C note, is at the first fret

of the 2nd string, but you can also find it at the fifth fret of the 3rd string.
Playing these fretted notes on a lower string allows you to play a different
string and can make your playing sound smoother and more flowing.
To play a G-major scale by using melodic banjo technique, do the following:
1. Pick the 3rd string open with the right-hand index finger.
You’re playing the G note: the first note of the G-major scale.
2. Fret the 4th string at the seventh fret with the left-hand ring finger
and pick this string with your right-hand thumb.
This note is an A note, the second note of the G-major scale.
3. Pick the 2nd string open with the right-hand index finger.
In this step, you play the third note of the G-major scale, the B note.
4. Fret the 3rd string at the fifth fret with the left-hand index finger and
pick this string with the right-hand thumb.
You’re playing the fourth note of the G-major scale, which is the C note.
5. Pick the 1st string open with the right-hand middle finger.
You play the D note, the fifth note of the G-major scale, in this step.
6. Fret the 2nd string at the fifth fret with the left-hand middle finger
and pick this string with the right-hand index finger.
Here you play an E note, and if you’ve been counting, you know that this
is the sixth note of the G-major scale.
7. Fret the 1st string at the fourth fret with the left-hand index finger and
pick this string with the right-hand middle finger.
This note is an F# note — the seventh note of the G-major scale.
8. Play the 5th string open with the right-hand thumb.
You’re playing a G note that is one octave higher than the G note found
on your open 3rd string.
The right-hand index finger does a lot of work in melodic banjo, so make sure
you’re playing these notes with good volume and power. In the left hand, you
can add speed to your fingering if you release each fretting finger soon after
striking the note with the right hand. This allows the left hand to get ready
for the next fretted position.
Tab 8-10 shows you how you can play the G-major scale using melodic-banjo
technique. You can follow the left-hand fingering indications by looking at the
lower case letters above the tab staff (i stands for index, m for middle, r for
ring, and p for the pinky finger).
171
Chapter 8: Playing Three-Finger Styles: Scruggs, Melodic, and Single String

Tab 8-10: Playing the G-major scale by using melodic-banjo techniques.
The trickiest aspect of melodic technique on this part of the banjo finger-
board is getting used to the idea of playing a higher-sounding fretted note on
a lower-pitched string. Practicing a good bit to work melodic scales into your
motor memory can really come in handy. After you’ve internalized the finger-
board “route,” you won’t think about how unusual playing a scale this way
really is!
Getting acquainted with more scales
Although getting comfortable with the G-major scale first is best (see preced-
ing section), sooner or later you need to play scales that start on other notes.
If you keep in mind that the principle behind melodic banjo is to find an 
adjacent scale note on a different string, you can figure out and play many 
different scales using the melodic approach.
For example, to play a melodic banjo C-major scale, you start on the fifth fret,
3rd string. The next note (D) is the open 1st string. Although you can play the
following scale note (E) on the second fret of the 1st string, playing this note
on the fifth fret of the 2nd string is better in melodic banjo. The next note of
the C-major scale is an F note, and you can find it on the third fret, 1st string.
The open 5th string is the next note (G) in the C-major scale.
The last three notes of the C-major scale are A, B, and C and require you to
fret notes above the fifth fret. Because you just played the open 5th string,
the best choice for the A note is the 2nd string, tenth fret; followed by a ninth
fret, 1st string for the B note; and a tenth fret, 5th string for the G, as shown
in Tab 8-11.

Part III: Playing Styles Past, Present, and Future 

Melodic-banjo playing up the neck often uses left-hand positions where
you’re not only fretting the 5th string, but also fretting two or three other
strings with the left hand at the same time — not easy! Some players prefer to
use their thumb to fret the 5th string in these situations, but others rely on
their index finger. The finger (or thumb) you use then determines which left-
hand fingers you use to fret the other strings in a melodic position. In the
example in Tab 8-11, I’ve indicated both options above the tab staff. See
which way works best for you!
Getting a feel for melodic-banjo songs
Practicing scales familiarizes you with the basic moves you use in melodic
style, but this isn’t nearly as much fun as playing tunes that utilize this
approach. As you branch out and apply melodic-banjo techniques to your own
arrangements, the following tips can help guide your choices of what to play:
 Melodic style works best when you play melodies that have a lot of
quick notes that are adjacent to one another in a scale. Many fiddle
tunes fit this description exactly, making this a great time to go melodic.
Most vocal songs have melodies with longer notes and usually sound
better with Scruggs-based playing.
 The key of the song is directly related to the scales and licks you use.
For songs in the key of G, you can use the G-major scale to create
melodic licks that also work for C and D chords. However, songs with
more complex chord progressions sound better by using other scales
that match the chords being played. Check out Tony Trischka’s Hot Licks
for Bluegrass Banjo (Oak Publications) to find melodic scales and licks
for other chords and keys.
 You can expand the possibilities of melodic banjo beyond just playing
scales by applying roll-pattern ideas to the left-hand fretted melodic
positions to create impressive-sounding descending and ascending
runs. If you simply race up and down a major scale for any extended
length of time, your music could become boring pretty quickly (for your
listeners at least — I can personally do this all day and be as happy as a
clam!). For more info on roll patterns, check out the section “Flowing
with the rolls” earlier in this chapter. You can use roll patterns with
melodic banjo in the song “Banjo Cascade” later in this section.
 Melodic style is great for improvising too! You have different melodic
licks for different chords, just as in Scruggs style. Don’t be afraid to play
your favorite C melodic lick (or G or D lick) each time that chord comes
around in whatever song you’re playing (it may not always work, but
you’ll never know until you actually try it).
 Try different left-hand fingerings, especially when using melodic tech-
niques up the neck. You usually have more than one way to play the
same note sequence in melodic style. You can determine how to play a
note largely by what your left hand needs to be fretting at that moment. 
173
Chapter 8: Playing Three-Finger Styles: Scruggs, Melodic, and Single String

In this section, you can try two tunes, using the melodic approach. The first,
“Banjo Cascade,” is really more of an exercise to get you used to playing
descending and ascending scale patterns. The second is the perennial
favorite “Turkey in the Straw.” Don’t forget that the tabs indicate left-hand 
fingering above the staff, using lower-case letters, and right-hand fingering
below the staff, using italics.
Enhancing melodic techniques with roll patterns: “Banjo Cascade”
Try your hand (or fingers) at “Banjo Cascade,” a short song that explores some
of these possibilities with a chord progression that moves from G to C to D by
using forward and backward rolls (see Tab 8-12, which is Track 85 on the CD).
These kinds of sounds are what three-finger players draw on when improvising
over chord progressions in the melodic style. Note how the left hand shifts
from one fretted position to another as you move down and then up the scale.
Tab 8-12: “Banjo Cascade” by yours truly (Track 85).
Getting fancy with fiddle tunes: “Turkey in the Straw”
Fiddle tunes are a staple of any bluegrass jam session (especially if a fiddle is
present!). Bluegrass and old-time musicians use the label fiddle tune to refer
to a large body of instrumental pieces which may or may not have their
actual origin as fiddle music. Regardless of the instrument you play, everyone

loves to play fiddle tunes and encountering many of them in jam sessions
isn’t unusual (you don’t even have to have a fiddle in your jam session to
play a fiddle tune either, by the way).
Most fiddle tunes are made up of two sections with different melodies.
Musicians usually repeat each section once before moving on to the next 
section (players sometimes describe this tune structure as an AABB form).
Using melodic banjo technique for the first section and a more Scruggs-
oriented approach for the tune’s second half (see the section “Playing
Scruggs-Style Banjo” for more info), try to work out the familiar fiddle tune
“Turkey in the Straw.”
In this version of “Turkey in the Straw,” you use a lot of the fretted positions
you use in “Banjo Cascade,” and you also put in some laps running up and
down the G-major scale (see Tab 8-13, which is Track 86). When in doubt
about the left-hand fingering, don’t forget to look up for answers (not to the
heavens, but above the tab staff).

Chapter 8: Playing Three-Finger Styles: Scruggs, Melodic, and Single String

Playing Single-String Banjo
In the hands of such skilled innovators as Béla Fleck, Alison Brown, Tony
Trischka, and Noam Pikelny, the musical possibilities of three-finger banjo are
expanding ever outward from bluegrass to jazz, classical, and other musical
styles. Incredibly virtuosic and complex music is being made on the banjo
today in significant measure because of new developments in single-string
banjo technique.
Single-string banjo provides another solution to the dilemma of finding a way
to play scales and scale-based melodies on the banjo. Instead of playing con-
secutive scale notes on different strings as in melodic banjo (see preceding
section), single-string banjo utilizes a right-hand technique that’s based
around finding ways to play notes on the same string. The left-hand fretting
moves are also different with single-string banjo because you’re finding the
notes in different places on the fingerboard with this way of playing.
Short single-string passages abound in the classic banjo music of the late-
19th and early-20th centuries (for more on classic banjo, take a short trip to
Chapter 7). Bluegrass pioneers Don Reno and Eddie Adcock introduced this
way of playing to bluegrass banjo style in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Over the next several decades, younger players incorporated ideas from rock
and jazz guitar technique to expand the range of single-string technique.
In the following sections, you become familiar with the right-hand picking
patterns used in single-string banjo before moving on to experiment with 
different ways to play a single-string G scale. After playing the following 
exercises, you’ll have a much better picture of what single-string banjo is all
about and grasp the many exciting musical possibilities that are possible
with this approach.
Using the right hand
Single-string banjo technique is similar in many ways to playing lead guitar
with a flatpick. In lieu of the flatpick moving up and down to play notes on the
same string, in single-string banjo you use your thumb and index fingers in
alternation or use roll-pattern combinations of your thumb, index, and
middle fingers to play melodies on individual (or single) strings.
Your choice of which right-hand pattern to use is determined by the specific
song or lick you’re playing, so feel free to experiment to see what works best
for your playing and that particular song!
176
Part III: Playing Styles Past, Present, and Future 

And keep in mind that creating a smooth and flowing sound using single-string
techniques can be a real challenge. So as you play the following right-hand
exercises, keep as steady and even rhythm as possible and play each note
with the same volume.
Single string with thumb and index finger
Currently, banjo players are in moment of transition in how they choose to play
single-string techniques with the right hand. The more established way is to
use a steady alternation of right-hand thumb and index fingers, as in the follow-
ing exercise (you can follow along with Tab 8-14, which is Track 87, part a):
1. Pick the 1st string with the right-hand thumb and then strike it again,
using the right-hand index finger.
2. Repeat Step 1, alternating the thumb and index to play the 1st string a
total of four times in a row.
Each of these notes should be equal in length and in volume.
3. Play the same pattern from Steps 1 and 2 on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
strings, keeping a steady rhythm throughout and striking each string
four times.
4. Move up from the 4th string, playing the four-note pattern on the 3rd,
2nd, and 1st strings before ending on the 3rd string.
Tab 8-14: Single-string exercise, using the right-hand thumb and index finger (Track 87, part a).
Single string with thumb, index, and middle fingers
Another way of playing single-string patterns is to bring the middle finger into
the picture to play roll patterns on individual strings. For example, try playing
the same string sequence as in Tab 8-14, but this time use an alternating-thumb
roll on just one string, as shown in Tab 8-15, which is Track 87, part b. (For
more info on roll patterns and the alternating thumb roll, check out the section
“Flowing with the rolls” earlier in this chapter.)

Chapter 8: Playing Three-Finger Styles: Scruggs, Melodic, and Single String

If you have six notes per measure (as you do in an Irish-inspired jig in 6/8
time later in this chapter), you can try a three-note forward roll on each
string. To do this, you strike each string first with the right-hand thumb, fol-
lowed by the index and middle fingers, as you move from the 1st string to the
2nd, 3rd, and 4th strings, as shown in Tab 8-16, which is Track 87, part c.
Tab 8-16: Single-string exercise in 6/8 time, using the forward roll (Track 87, part c).
Taking a crack at single-string scales
Much of the left-hand work in single-string banjo is in mapping out the fretted
positions that provide an easy reach to the notes you use to play a particular
lick or melody fragment. You almost always have more than one way to play
just about anything in single-string style. But don’t let this discourage you —
when you begin to play licks and songs by using these techniques, you’ll
appreciate having choices!
When you play scales using single-string techniques down the neck (on the
first five frets of the banjo), you play a combination of both open (or unfret-
ted) and fretted strings, using what banjo players call open positions for your
left-hand fretting. However, when you begin to play single-string patterns up
the neck (above the fifth fret), you use left-hand fingerings in which most, if
not all, of the notes are fretted. These left-hand positions are called closed
positions.
And borrowing a bit of terminology from guitar players, you may notice that
in this section I refer to the various positions you use to play a scale across
strings as boxes. Where you’re coming from and where you’re going to on the
banjo fingerboard in a particular passage of a song determines which box
you use for a particular phrase. As you gain more experience playing single-
string banjo, you gain more confidence shifting from one box to another.
To get a taste of the technique that is at the heart of great single-string play-
ing, it’s time to take a look at four different ways to play the G-major scale as
well as D-major single-string scales. In the tablature examples, I ask you to
alternate the thumb and index finger in the right hand. However, if you feel
like using your right-hand middle finger to catch a note here and there, go for
it and see whether it works for you.

Unfortunately, this section doesn’t have enough room to cover every scale
you’ll ever need. However, after you can handle the closed-position G-scale
formations (later in this section), you can play other major scales by playing
the same exercise but starting on a different fret (musicians call this process
of playing licks and songs in different keys transposing; check out Appendix A
to locate all the notes on the banjo neck). To find out more about scales of all
kinds, check out Music Theory For Dummies by Michael Pilhofer and Holly
Day (Wiley).
Single-string open G-major scale
Get out your banjo and try a G-major scale in an open position, playing as
many unfretted strings as possible:
1. Begin by striking the open 3rd string with your right-hand thumb.
2. Pick the 3rd string, second fret with your right-hand index finger.
Playing the same string twice in a row using different right-hand fingers
is the heart of the single-string technique.
3. Play the open 2nd string, followed by the 2nd string fretted at the first
fret, using your thumb and index fingers to play these strings.
4. Play the last four notes of this G-major scale on the 1st string, once
again alternating between the thumb and index in the right hand.
Take a moment to check out the left-hand fingering, which is indicated
above the tab staff with lower-case letters in Tab 8-17, which corre-
sponds to Track 88, part a.
5. After playing the open 1st string, climb up this string, using your left-
hand index, ring, and pinky fingers, to play the 1st string at the
second, fourth, and fifth frets.
6. Finish up the exercise by moving back down the G-major scale to the
open 3rd-string G where you originally started.

Single-string closed G-major scales
You can also play the same notes from Tab 8-17 by using a fifth-fret closed
box. This way of playing takes a little more left-hand firepower, but a big
advantage is that you can move closed box patterns anywhere on the neck to
match other chords and scales.
Here’s one way to play a closed G-major scale (you can also check out Tab
8-18, which is Track 88, part b); remember that this particular exercise trav-
els up the G-major scale all the way to an A note located on the 1st string,
seventh fret:
1. Begin by playing the open 4th string.
2. Climb up to the G note at the fifth fret of the 4th string by playing the
4th string at the second fret (an E note) and the 4th string at the fourth
fret (an F# note).
3. Use the fretted positions from Step 2 to play all the subsequent notes
of the G-major scale out of this box.
Tab 8-18: Playing a second- to fifth-fret box-position single-string G-major scale (Track 88, part b).
Box positions help you to remember left-hand fingering patterns. Many play-
ers take advantage of what I call the one-finger-per-fret rule when using box
positions. After you’re in a box position, your left hand covers a fretting
range of four (and sometimes five) frets — with one left-hand finger responsi-
ble for each fret in the box. Your first choice in left-hand fingering on any
string is to use the finger in the box that’s designated for this fret.
For example, in this exercise (and in Tab 8-18), the pinky finger is used to fret
the fifth fret on any string, the ring on the fourth fret, the middle on the third
fret, and the index on the second fret. You don’t want to remain in just one
region of the fretboard for very long however, so players often shift the box
up or down one or more frets as needed to reach the notes that they want to
play. This is exactly what happens in Tab 8-18 at the last note of measure one
as the left-hand index finger shifts from a second- to a third-fret position,
moving the entire box up one fret. This movement allows the left hand to
catch the A note on the 1st string by extending the box (and the reach of the
pinky finger) up to the 1st string, seventh fret, as shown in Tab 8-18.

Part III: Playing Styles Past, Present, and Future 

After you have these basic steps down pat, try the same G-major scale, but
this time, use the middle finger to play the G note on the fifth fret of the 4th
string instead of the pinky finger. Note that four fingers of your left-hand have
now created a box that is two frets higher than the box you used for Tab 8-18.
Another left-hand finger shift occurs in this scale exercise at the beginning
of measure two as the index finger moves up one fret to fret the 1st string,
fifth fret. 
As you shift either up or down the fretboard, you can play higher or lower
notes as needed. Check out Tab 8-19 for all the details and listen to Track 88,
part c.
Tab 8-19: Using a fourth- to seventh- and fifth- to ninth-fret-box positions (Track 88, part c).
Now try moving the box up one more fret and play a G scale in which the left-
hand index finger frets the G note located at the fifth fret of the 4th string
(see Tab 8-20 and listen to Track 88, part d). Note that your box now covers
five frets, enabling you to play three scale notes on each string. Also, you
have a left-hand shift at the next to last note of the first measure (where the
left-hand index moves up two frets to the seventh fret) and again at the
second note of the second measure (where the index moves up two frets
again to play the ninth fret, 1st string). These shifts are common in single-
string playing, allowing greater fretting range in the left hand. 
Tab: 8-20: Using fifth- to ninth-, seventh- to tenth-, and ninth- to twelfth-fret box positions (Track 88, part d).
Single-string D-major scale
After you’re comfortable using single-string ideas in the key of G (see preced-
ing sections), branching out to new keys, using single-string techniques, is
fairly easy.

Chapter 8: Playing Three-Finger Styles: Scruggs, Melodic, and Single String

Try an open-position D-major scale beginning on the open 4th string (you can
follow along in Tab 8-21, which is Track 89). You can find the second and third
notes of the D-major scale (E and F#) on the second and fourth frets of the 4th
string. Next, play an open 3rd-string G followed by a 3rd-string, second-fret A
note. You can find the B note by playing an open 2nd string. Follow this with
a C# on the 2nd string, second fret and an open 1st-string D.
You can extend the D-major scale a few more notes by playing the 1st-string,
second-fret E; the 1st-string, fourth-fret F#; and the 1st-string, fifth-fret G.
Tab 8-21: Playing an open-position single-string D-major scale (Track 89).
Exercising single-string 
techniques in songs
Single-string banjo provides another way to broaden your range of musical
expression. Depending on what each musical situation needs, you can use
single-string techniques to play an entire solo or song, or you can just play a
few fancy single-string licks to add variety to a tune played in Scruggs or
melodic style. However you decide to incorporate these ideas into your play-
ing, the following tips can help you master using single-string techniques in a
tune faster and make them more fun to play:
 Make your single-string playing sound as smooth and as flowing as you
possibly can. You can do this by keeping a very steady rhythm in your
right-hand picking as well as holding one fretted note down for as long
as possible before moving to the next fretted note with your left hand.
 Know your scales and your box positions. You’ll quickly appreciate
how much easier it is to figure out a new tune if you’ve already spent
time working on scales and the different box positions you can use to
play single-string passages (see previous sections on these topics).
Do your homework (jazz musicians call this woodshedding)!
 Work up speed slowly. Playing single string fast isn’t easy! Don’t be 
discouraged if it takes months, or even years, to sound like your pro-
gressive banjo heroes. Begin by playing as slowly as you need to in
order to sound good and increase speed very gradually over time.
Now you’re ready to tackle a few tunes in single-string style!

Part III: Playing Styles Past, Present, and Future 

“Arkansas Traveler”
This first tune is the fiddle-tune favorite “Arkansas Traveler.” Most people
play this song in the key of D major, so you need to first map out a D-major
scale before jumping into the tune (see section “Single-string D-major scale
earlier in this chapter). For this song, the version of the D-major scale you
need begins on the open 4th string and climbs all the way up to the G note on
the fifth fret of the 1st string.
Now you’re ready to play “Arkansas Traveler,” using single-string techniques.
It’s Tab 8-22 and Track 90 on the CD. Note that the second half of the tune
shifts to a higher box as it climbs up to the A note found at the seventh fret of
the 1st string. You play a lot of consecutive 1st-string notes in the right hand
in this section, so be sure to pay close attention to the left-hand fingering
indicated above the tab staff. If you do that, you’ll be just fine!

Chapter 8: Playing Three-Finger Styles: Scruggs, Melodic, and Single String

“Reno’s Rag”
One of the advantages of single-string banjo is that you have easy access to
many different notes within a single box position. You can figure out much of
the left-hand fingering for the chord-based licks in “Reno’s Rag” by using the
one-finger-per-fret rule (which I describe in the section “Single-string closed
G-major scales,” earlier in this chapter). This tune is shown in Tab 8-23 and is
Track 91 on the CD.
With the G chord that begins this piece, you want to use your left-hand index
finger to fret across the seventh fret on all strings. You then use your middle
finger to fret any note that falls on the eighth fret and your ring finger to fret
all ninth-fret notes. You then shift this box down two frets for the A chord,
using one finger per fret once again.
Tab 8-23: “Reno’s Rag,” composed by me (Track 91).
Single-string innovator Don Reno created some great-sounding single-string
licks based around the F and D chord positions way back in the 1950s, and
these rock ’n’ roll–influenced licks still sound great on the banjo today. Several
of these licks are incorporated into the melody of my tune “Reno’s Rag.”

“Winston’s Jig”
You can try a bit of Irish-inspired music by using single-string techniques on
the song “Winston’s Jig” (Tab 8-24). Jigs have a different rhythm than other
kinds of fiddle tunes, with six beats in each cycle and six right-hand notes per
measure. When playing jigs, you have a prime opportunity to bring the right-
hand middle finger into your playing technique to use forward rolls that
match this rhythm (you can read more about using the forward roll in single-
string playing in the section “Playing Single-String Banjo: Using the right
hand” earlier in this chapter). Be sure to pay attention to this unique feature
of jigs as you work your way through this tune — and don’t forget to listen to
the Track 92 on the CD to hear my version.

Chapter 8: Playing Three-Finger Styles: Scruggs, Melodic, and Single String

Combining Three-Finger Techniques
Modern banjo players combine Scruggs, melodic, and single-string tech-
niques to create a wide variety of three-finger soundscapes. Although you
can’t find any rules written in stone, Scruggs style is generally used for 
hard-driving bluegrass songs and for accompanying other musicians, while
melodic and single-string banjo techniques launch the instrument into musi-
cal fusions blending bluegrass with jazz, classical, and international music
styles.
You shift from one technique to another in order to best capture what you
want to play at any particular moment. The greater your technical facility on
the instrument — something that comes with years of hard work — the more
you can express on the banjo. This lifelong journey provides great personal
rewards when you reach the point where you can instantly connect mind and
fingers to play the music you hear in your head and feel in your heart.
Until you’ve gained a lot of experience in each style on its own, you can’t
really put them all together. So if you need a refresher or some more experi-
ence on these three-finger techniques before tackling this section, I suggest
you take a look at the previous sections of this chapter.
To close out this chapter’s survey of modern three-finger styles, I’d like to
present my tune “Meadows of Dan” from the CD Bill Evans Plays Banjo, which
is shown in Tab 8-25. (You can hear more about this recording by visiting my
homepage at www.nativeandfine.com.)
This advanced-level tune demonstrates how many of the techniques I discuss
in this chapter can be blended together and used as inspiration in original
tunes. You can find a bit of everything in “Meadows of Dan” — from shifts in
time signature to a change of key in the tune’s second half. Although Scruggs
rolls predominate in the tune’s first half, the second half uses single-string
techniques in the key of E% major.
The accompanying CD has a track of me playing the tune slowly (Track 93),
followed by the full band track (Track 94) from the Bill Evans Plays Banjo CD.
Playing along with me are some of the best musicians in bluegrass music
today: John Reischman, mandolin; Missy Raines, bass; Rob Ickes, dobro; Jim
Nunally, guitar; and Greg Spatz, fiddle. I hope you enjoy this tune!

I
’m going to let you in on a secret: Buying a banjo can be really fun if you
know how to do it. You can find more choices and more ways to buy a
banjo today than ever before — and an instrument is out there for just about
every budget. Your banjo is waiting for you, and this chapter helps you to
find it.
Whether you have your eye on a beginner’s model or a professional instru-
ment, you need to know some fundamental differences in banjos before you
lay down your hard-earned cash. If (or when) you’ve been playing for a few
years, the time comes to step up to a better instrument, or you may someday
want to make the ultimate investment and buy a collectable vintage banjo.
This chapter guides you through each step of the process and helps you
avoid some of the common pitfalls that you may encounter on your banjo
acquisition quest.
Establishing Your Banjo Boundaries
Before you step into a music store or venture onto the Internet to begin your
banjo search, you need to set some guidelines to make your search more fun
and effective:
 Setting your expectations: Do you have a track record of getting excited
about various hobbies but then moving on quickly to something else
that strikes your fancy? Or do you have a gut feeling that the banjo is
just the thing that you’ve been waiting for all your life? Your answers to

these questions help you determine how much to invest or whether to
invest at all (and if you want to be sure you’re being honest with your-
self, consider asking for your significant other’s opinion).
 Deciding what’s important: Do you want an instrument with flash or
something simple? Do you want something just to play around the
house, or do you ever expect to travel with your banjo? Do you see 
yourself playing by yourself or with others? Are you also budgeting for
banjo lessons or instructional materials? The answers to these kinds of
questions help you sharpen your focus.
Here’s another important thing to consider: As a rule, banjos tend to be
heavier than guitars or mandolins. If you have back problems, you want
to find an instrument that’s on the lighter side.
 Determining your budget: I realize that thinking about the financial part
is a drag, but you’ve got to do it. After you’ve had some time to think
about what will make you happy (and what you can live with!), you then
need to determine both how much you can afford and the quality of
banjo you’re seeking. The minimum amount you need to spend for a
playable new beginner’s banjo and a few essential accessories is about
$350 to $400. A banjo with “all the right stuff” sets you back anywhere
from $600 to $4,500 or more, depending on just how much of the extra
goodies you really need! My advice is to get the kind of banjo that’s best
for the style you think you want to play, even if it costs more.
If you’re discovering a fretted instrument for the first time and have a busy life
full of work and family commitments, count on 9 to 18 months of dedicated
practice before you can move past the beginners’ level. If you purchase the
right beginners’ banjo, two years may go by before you want or need to buy
up. However, if you already play, a better-sounding instrument can jump-start
your enthusiasm and push you onward and upward. In this case, I suggest
you head to the section “Stepping Up to a Better Banjo” later in this chapter.
Making the Leap: Resonator 
or Open-back?
You have a choice of two different kinds of five-string banjos: 
 A resonator banjo has a wooden back that is attached to the back of the
instrument (see Figure 9-1).
 An open-back banjo doesn’t have anything attached to the back. You
can easily look into the inside of the banjo’s sound-producing chamber
(also see Figure 9-1).
192
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

You can identify a resonator or an open-back banjo by simply looking at the
back of the instrument: If it doesn’t have a resonator, the banjo is an open-back.
Your decision as to which kind of banjo is best for you should be based pri-
marily on the style of music that you think you want to play. The differences
between these two types of banjos can be hard to understand at first, but
they’re mainly about the sounds that skilled players prefer from each kind of
instrument. After you try out both kinds of banjos at a music store by holding
them in your hands, strumming a few chords, or playing a song or two, you
can immediately begin to understand some of these differences, even if you’ve
never played banjo before. The following sections discuss the advantages of
each type of banjo.
Pumping up the volume: Resonator banjos
Over the last 150 years, banjo builders have continually tried to make banjos
louder. I know what you’re asking yourself: Aren’t banjos loud enough already?
Well, maybe they are now, but it wasn’t always that way. Around 1860, some-
one came up with the idea of attaching a wooden chamber, or resonator, to
the back of the banjo body in order to increase the volume of the instrument.
The resonator reflects the sound off of its inside surface and projects the
sound out of the front of the instrument and away from the player. The result
is more volume and a brighter banjo sound. The resonator is usually
attached to the banjo with thumbscrews.
In bluegrass music, you need to be able to play with enough volume so that
the other band members and your audience can hear your virtuosic solos
(for more on bluegrass banjo, see Chapters 4, 6, and 8). Therefore, practically
all bluegrass-based banjo players prefer a resonator banjo strung with metal
strings. Musicians also use resonator banjos whenever they desire additional
volume and a brighter tone for other styles, from folk and old-time to progres-
sive three-finger approaches that are elaborations of bluegrass technique.
Entry-level resonator banjos are more expensive than comparable open-back
instruments. You can expect to pay from $50 to $150 more for a beginner’s
resonator banjo than for the same instrument in an open-back configuration.
However, if you’re interested in playing bluegrass, you should spend the
extra money and get a resonator banjo.
If you ever need less volume or the tone of an open-back banjo, you can
always loosen the thumbscrews and remove the resonator to create an
instant open-back instrument. (For an overview of the parts of the banjo,
see Chapter 1.)

Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Going the old-time way: Open-back banjos
Open-back banjos generally have a mellower tone, are lighter in weight, and
can be less expensive than resonator banjos. They also usually have a differ-
ent setup than a resonator banjo, often with a higher string action that is 
the preference of clawhammer players (string action refers to how high the
strings are positioned above the fingerboard of the instrument). Open-back
players use metal, nylon, or gut strings, depending upon the specific style of
music they’re playing, how their instrument is set up, and the sound they
want to get from their banjo.
Beginners can find new entry-level open-back banjos starting at around $300.
You can find differences in price, look, and construction between open-back
models depending upon whether they are made for old-time (including
clawhammer) playing, or for classic or minstrel styles.
195
Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide
The power of tradition
The sound and style of a particular piece of
music, how instruments are played, and the way
that musicians interact with each other all have
to do with agreed-upon ideas about music-
making traditions. Musical traditions take shape
as musicians think about music over many years,
passing down what works and what sounds
good from one generation to the next. These tra-
ditions relate to people’s deepest-held beliefs
about what good music should sound like and
what role music plays in their lives. However,
these traditions aren’t written in stone: They
change and evolve as musicians contribute
new ideas and innovative ways of playing.
Traditions also involve aspects of music that
aren’t strictly connected to the sound of the
music itself. For instance, if you went to a blue-
grass festival expecting to hear Ralph Stanley
and the Clinch Mountain Boys but the heavy
metal band Kiss suddenly took the stage,
plugged in their electric instruments and started
wailing at top volume, you would at least be, well,
surprised. When you attend a bluegrass concert
(or a heavy metal show for that matter), you
have certain expectations about what the musi-
cians will look like, what kind of instruments
they play, and even the content of their stage
patter. I’d never expect Ralph Stanley to yell at
the top of his lungs, “Hello, Poughkeepsie! Let’s
rock and roll!” at a bluegrass show. This display
would certainly be interesting, but it would be
totally out of place.
For the most part, banjo players take comfort
and even pleasure in following the traditions
already in place for the music that they play.
One of the most powerful of these traditions is
using the right kind of banjo for the style that
you’re playing. For better or worse, almost all
bluegrass players choose resonator instru-
ments, and most folk and old-time banjo players
prefer open-back banjos. If you’re thinking of
getting anything above the least expensive
beginners instrument, you should strongly con-
sider buying either an open-back or a resonator
banjo based on the style that you think you will
be playing most of the time.

Several manufacturers have entry-level open-back banjos with the same
sound chamber (or pot) and overall design and construction as a matching
resonator model available. However, more expensive open-back banjos likely
have a different configuration of metal and wood than you find on a resonator
banjo. 
Banjos were around for 100 years or more before someone thought it would
be a good idea to put resonators on them. The minstrel style of the mid-19th
century, the classic style of the late 19th and early 20th century and many of
the old-time styles of the early years of country music in the 1920s and ’30s
were all played at the time on open-back banjos. Folk music patriarch Pete
Seeger prefers an open-back instrument, and most clawhammer players find
the sound of an open-back banjo just right for playing old-time string band
music. (For more on clawhammer banjo, see Chapters 4, 5, and 6; for minstrel
and classic banjo, visit Chapter 7.)
Finding a Great Beginner’s Banjo
When I was learning to play banjo in the 1970s, I had virtually no good choices
in a beginner’s instrument. Luckily, that’s not the story today. You can pur-
chase a good startup banjo for a little more than $300 (or even less if you can
find a used model). However, you can also purchase an instrument that’s per-
fectly awful. The following sections help you separate the good from the bad.
Although the appearance of an instrument may provide an initial attraction,
the banjo that sounds the best to you is the one that you will be most happy
owning in the long run. You need to determine which instrument within your
price range speaks to you most powerfully. If your gut choice matches your
stylistic aspirations, you’re definitely on the right track to making a good
decision.
When you’re in a music store that has several different kinds of banjos in
stock, don’t be afraid to ask a salesperson to demonstrate each type. Better
yet, if the store has a banjo teacher, introduce yourself and arrange a time
where you can meet and be treated to a mini-concert. Another option would
be to take a banjo-playing friend with you to play each instrument and offer
advice. Sit directly across so that you can absorb the sound of each instru-
ment as deeply as possible.
Knowing what’s in the pot
The body of the banjo — the round part plus the resonator if it has one — is
called the banjo pot. Good banjo pots are built around laminated pieces of
196
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

wood called a rim, usually made of maple, that is pressed into a circular ring
shape (see Figure 9-2). More expensive instruments also have a circular piece
of metal or an unseen metal hoop called the tone ring resting on top of the
wooden rim. The banjo head is stretched across either the top surface of the
wooden rim or of the tone ring.
The pots on some inexpensive banjos are made of a single piece of aluminum.
These banjos not only don’t sound as good as a banjo pot built from a
wooden rim, but may also distort out of their round shape over time.
Regardless of your budget, go for wood in your pot!
Getting good string action
How high the strings are from the fingerboard of the banjo refers to the string
action. You want a string action that is high enough so that you don’t hear
buzzing against the frets when you play, but low enough so that the banjo is
easy to fret and stays in tune. Remember, players generally prefer higher
action for some styles (like clawhammer) than for others (like bluegrass).
One exactly correct string action doesn’t exist. You must develop your own
preferences as you play.

Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide

For now, make sure that the string action is around 1⁄8" above the 12th fret for
a bluegrass banjo by measuring the distance from the top of the fret to the
1st string. For clawhammer playing, it’s fine for the action to be 1⁄16" or more
higher than this (see Figure 9-3). The 5th string sits closer to the neck than
the other four banjo strings, so you don’t want to use this string as your ref-
erence. You may have to turn the banjo around to make the measurement. If
the string action is 1⁄16" more or less than 1⁄8", that’s okay. You have several
ways to precisely adjust the string action, and at this point, you just want to
make sure that it’s in the ballpark. If the string action is wildly higher or
lower, move on to another banjo — or to another music store!
The string action over the banjo fingerboard should be the lowest where the
strings meet the nut and highest where the banjo neck meets the body (the
nut is the notched white bar at the end of the fretboard at the opposite end of
the banjo from the bridge and guides the strings to the tuners). The banjo
should have a gradual and consistent increase in the string action as you look
from the lowest to the highest fret. If you see a big jump in the string action
occurring at one point on the neck, avoid this banjo because the neck of the
instrument could have problems.

Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

You don’t need to carry a toolbox in with you to each music store as you go
banjo shopping. However, have a ruler close by for measuring banjo bridges
and string heights and whatever else strikes your fancy. You can download
free, small printable rulers that you can cut out, fold up, stick in a wallet, and
take with you everywhere. I know this sounds tremendously geeky, but these
darned things have really come in handy for me. Visit www.vendian.org/
mncharity/dir3/paper_rulers for more choices in rulers than any
normal human may ever need.
Finding bridge height
A proper bridge height is essential if you want to enjoy playing your banjo.
Some inexpensive imported banjos come with bridges that are so short that get-
ting a good right-hand position for any playing style is difficult. You want a banjo
bridge that measures around 5⁄8" or more from bottom to top. You can take this
measurement on either the 1st- or 5th-string side of the bridge (see Figure 9-4).
Stay away from any instrument with a bridge that’s less than 5⁄8" tall and has
string action above 3⁄16". This combination of ingredients will result in a banjo
that is difficult to play and keep in tune.
Figure 9-4:
Measuring
bridge
height: 
5⁄8" or more
is best.
199
Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide

Unlike a guitar or mandolin, banjo bridges are easily removable from the instru-
ment (after you know how to do it, that is). Professional players often try many
different kinds of bridges on their banjos to find one that makes the banjo
sound great and is just the right height (for more on this, see Chapter 10).
If the bridge on your banjo is just a bit too short or tall, but the other aspects
of your prospective banjo purchase look good, you can always replace the
bridge later. If your string action is too high and the bridge is over 5⁄8", you can
replace the bridge with a shorter one and also adjust your string action at the
same time.
Measuring string spacing
The distance between the strings is called the string spacing and is usually
measured at the nut. If the strings are too close together, you will have trou-
ble fretting cleanly, or you may find yourself muting adjacent open strings.
You need more space between the strings if your hands are large or if your
fingers are stubby. On the other hand, if the strings are too far apart for the
size of your hand, reaching across the fingerboard to accurately fret chords
will be a chore, and your left hand will tire quickly.
To measure the string spacing, measure across the top of the nut from the
4th string notch across to the 1st string (see Figure 9-5). For most folks, the
string spacing at the nut should be around 1", give or take 1⁄16". These days,
encountering a banjo that doesn’t have adequate string spacing is unusual.
However, you can still find a few new imported banjos that don’t have enough
room between the strings to ever allow the left hand to feel comfortable.
Avoid these banjos unless your hands are really small!
Checking the tuners
It probably goes without saying that the job of the tuners on a banjo is to
keep the instrument in tune (although knowing when the banjo’s in tune is 
up to you — check out Chapter 2 to find out how). These days, most banjos
have geared tuners, with gears attached to the tuning shaft that make tuning
easier and more precise. The tuners on an entry-level instrument likely have
external gears that you can easily locate by looking at the back of the peg-
head. More expensive banjos have tuners with gears that are housed inside
the tuner’s body itself. Although internal tuners tend to work better, tuners
with external gears are fine on a beginner’s banjo if they’re in good working
order. Both kinds are shown in Figure 9-6.
In either case, you want to check to make sure that the tuners move smoothly
by tuning the strings up and down a bit and feeling the string movement
through the peg. If necessary, have someone in the music store put the banjo
back in tune for you after you’ve experimented in this way!

Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide

I’m sure that you’ve already noticed that the banjo has a tuning peg that sits
on the top part of the neck, almost right in the middle of the fingerboard.
That’s the 5th string’s tuner. In order to cut corners, some builders make
inexpensive banjos that have a 5th-string tuner with no gears at all (see
Figure 9-7). With this type of tuning peg (called a friction peg), the string fluc-
tuates wildly up and down in pitch with just the slightest movement, making
your attempt to get the string precisely in tune very difficult. These kinds of
tuners are common on banjos that are over 100 years old, but on a new
instrument, let your warning flags go up and avoid this banjo.
If you already own a banjo with this kind of tuner on the 5th string, don’t toss
the entire instrument! Have a knowledgeable music store replace it with a
geared 5th-string tuning peg (shown in Figure 9-7). The cost of this kind of
tuner plus the installation charge shouldn’t run more than about $30. This
amount of money is a small price to pay to save yourself hours of tuning 
frustration. Your loved ones will also be more appreciative of your practice
sessions if you’re playing in tune.

Taking the plunge
If you’ve read the previous sections, you’re now ready to make an informed
decision on purchasing a beginner’s banjo. The good news is that several
banjos that combine all the necessary elements are available for under 
$400, giving you an instrument that plays well, sounds good, and is built
to last until the time that you want to step up to something better. Check
out banjos from the Deering, Gold Tone, and Epiphone companies, among
others.

Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide
Help! I’m left handed. Can I find a banjo for me?
Eight to 15 percent of the world population is left
handed. A left-handed banjo player may naturally
want to pick the strings with the left hand and fret
with the right. On a guitar, this matter is simple
because you can reset the strings so that they’re
in the proper low to high pitch relationship to
your hands. (This is how Paul McCartney, who
is perhaps the world’s most well-known left-
handed musician, plays both guitar and bass.)
However, because the banjo has the shorter 5th
string that sits on the top side of the neck, you
simply can’t flip the banjo around and immedi-
ately begin playing the banjo left handed (well,
you could, but it may not sound very good
because the 5th string would be in the wrong
place in relation to your picking hand).
Playing the banjo takes both hands. For adult
learners, the issue isn’t so much what the left
hand is doing versus what the right hand is
doing as much as coordinating the different
actions of both hands at the same time. I’m left
handed, but I first learned to play the guitar right
handed. Then I learned to play the banjo. If I can
do it, anyone can!
However, to play left handed, you have to have
a banjo with a special neck that’s a mirror image
of a normal banjo neck so that the 5th string is
on the top side of the instrument when you turn
the banjo the opposite way. If you buy an entry
level banjo with a left-handed neck, you have a
choice of just a few instruments and have to
spend an additional $100 for this option. As you
buy up to more professional-sounding banjos,
your choices still remain limited, and you may
have to have your necks custom built, which
usually adds to the instrument’s price.
Unless you already play another stringed instru-
ment left handed, I suggest that you try a regular
right-handed banjo first. Try to make an arrange-
ment with a music store to return your banjo in
trade for a left-handed model if your experiment
doesn’t work out. If you feel extreme frustration
after trying a right-handed banjo for a few
weeks, consult with a local teacher or player to
check your technique and ask his advice. If you
both agree to try a left-handed instrument, then
go for it.

Don’t worry too much about how these entry-level banjos look. These instru-
ments don’t have elaborate inlay patterns on the fingerboard or even a glossy
finish, because the manufacturers are stressing good playability over fancy
looks. These banjos also aren’t going to sound as loud or as clear as more
expensive instruments. However, they should feel like a higher-priced banjo
and, at this point, that’s the most important thing you need as a beginning
player.
As a banjo teacher, every now and then I’ve witnessed new students who get
so excited about their new hobby that they rush out and buy a professional-
quality instrument that costs $2,000 or more before they’re able to play a
single song. For some reason, this kind of behavior seems to run rampant
among middle-aged men like me! Although this impulse often works out in the
long run to everyone’s satisfaction, owning a professional instrument right off
the bat can create too high of expectations of what you think you should be
able to accomplish on the banjo. Remember, spending money doesn’t make
you a good banjo player — only practice can do that. Don’t mistake the com-
mitment of your financial resources with the commitment of the time that it
takes to become a good banjo player.
The music store should offer to set up your banjo for free before handing it
over to you and in addition may offer semiannual checkups. Take advantage
of these services to keep your banjo in optimal playing condition (and for
more on maintaining your banjo, see Chapter 11).
Stepping Up to a Better Banjo
A good deal of complex psychology is involved in knowing when you’re ready
for a better (and higher-priced) banjo. Here’s the most honest way of know-
ing that it’s time: When you’ve reached the point in your playing where you
honestly feel that your current instrument is holding you back from becom-
ing a better player, consider it time to start looking for a better banjo.
If you hear greater clarity and volume as you play another instrument, then
you’re in the company of a potential new soul mate. A new banjo that’s better
than what you already have should also be easier to play and should sound
good when you play up and down the neck. The high notes should sound
bright and brilliant, and the low notes should be deep and penetrating. If the
banjo is considerably more expensive than what you already own, it should
look better than your current instrument and may have elaborate and beauti-
ful inlays in the fingerboard and on the headstock. Also, a better banjo is
likely heavier than your typical entry-level banjo.

Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

In the following sections, you match your musical goals to your budget and
personality. You then train your eye to identify good components on a quality
instrument and get acquainted with the differences between upper end res-
onator and open-back banjos to help narrow your future purchase choices.
Budgeting for a quality banjo
You have a number of different ways to think about an additional banjo pur-
chase (your significant other may call these rationalizations, but you can pre-
tend that this word is too big for you to understand). All of these various
strategies have worked for me at different times as I’ve considered a new
banjo purchase. See which of the approaches in the following sections is the
best match for you.
I can’t tell you how much to spend on your next banjo or which instrument
you should buy. You have to figure this out on your own. However, keep in
mind that banjos typically cost more than guitars for the same level of qual-
ity. Banjo players often spend $2,000 to $5,000 for a new professional-quality,
American-made instrument with a case. The more money you plan to spend,
the more time you should spend researching your options. Don’t forget to
spend time talking with family and loved ones about your purchase plans. In
this way, you may end up with a banjo that provides pleasure for the rest of
your playing days and could also become a valuable family heirloom.
The gradual-upgrade approach
You’re the sensible type. You never like to get into anything over your head,
and you’re slow and steady in regard to your long-range commitments. You
started by playing on one of those entry-level banjos that costs around $300,
but now you’ve got your eye set on the next most expensive banjo, which
costs about $200 more than your current instrument.
In the long run, you’ll be satisfied with this strategy only if you’re really getting
more instrument for your money. The potential downside is that you may feel
compelled to make a new purchase every couple of years. However, when I was
learning to play as a teenager, this buying strategy was the only one that I
could afford, and it worked out fine for me! If you follow this path, you want to
spend from $200 to $500 or more for each step up to a better-sounding banjo.
The leap-frog approach
You’re a bit more compulsive than the person described in the preceding sec-
tion, but you’ve reached a sure conclusion that playing the banjo makes you
happier than just about anything else in the world. You aren’t getting any
younger and because you only go around once in life, you’ve decided not to
wait on an instrument that’s close to the banjo of your dreams.
205
Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide

If you’re interested in an open-back banjo, be ready to spend from $750 to $2,000
or more for a professional-grade banjo ready for old-time playing. A vintage
open-back banjo from the first decades of the 20th century can top out at
$7,000 or more. Prices for professional-quality bluegrass banjos start at
around $1,000 and quickly escalate up to $4,500 and above. Vintage collec-
tor’s bluegrass banjos from the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s have skyrocketed in
value in recent years, costing from $3,000 to as much as $40,000 to $100,000
or more for the most coveted models.
What have you got to lose with this approach? New banjos generally don’t
appreciate in value until they’re several decades old, and vintage instruments
are just downright expensive. Make sure with the leap-frog approach that
you’re buying an instrument from a respected and well-known builder or
company so you can get back something close to your original investment if
you and your banjo have to part ways.
The buy-something-different approach
You’re a person who craves variety in life, and you don’t limit yourself to
enjoying and playing just one style of music. You love how various styles call
for different banjo sounds and setups, and you may even be interested in
starting a collection.
In this case, you want to purchase something that contrasts with what you
already own by buying a banjo with a different sound or appearance or perhaps
buying a bluegrass banjo if you already own an open back (or vice versa).
With this approach, you can set a budget more flexibly based on your inter-
est in the styles that you’ll play on a different kind of banjo.
This approach is usually the domain of experienced players or collectors
who are buying (or trading) professional caliber instruments. In this case, the
sky’s the limit. But even new players can add variety to their lives by buying
a different kind of entry-level instrument, like an electric banjo (which I discuss
later in this chapter), to complement an acoustic resonator or open-back
model. You can get away with spending as little as $400 to $500 with this
approach if you’re a beginner who craves variety out of their banjos.
Knowing a quality banjo when you see it
Unlike a guitar, a banjo can be taken apart and put back together again with
little more than an adjustable wrench. Many parts like necks, rims, tone rings,
tuners, and even resonators, are interchangeable with other similar kinds of
banjos. This case is especially true with professional-grade bluegrass banjos.
Therefore, knowing your components is crucial in selecting a quality instru-
ment. The following sections discuss what to look for in terms of the internal
parts when choosing a quality banjo.
206
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

A good banjo is the result of using well-made components that are matched
and fit together with care. A great banjo comes from using the best compo-
nents and fitting them together with the utmost skill and precision.
If you’re in the market for a quality bluegrass banjo, be sure to check out the
following builders: Huber, Gibson, Deering, Stelling, Nechville, Tennessee,
Sullivan, Kel Kroyden, Osborne, Louzee, Gold Star, Recording King, and
Williams, among others. For a quality open-back banjo, don’t forget to take a
look at these makers: Wildwood, Bart Reiter, Chanterelle, Chuck Lee, Kevin
Enoch, Jason Romero, Vega, Ome, and Recording King.
It’s all in the wood: Banjo rims
Like the engine of a car, the rim and tone ring (see the following section) are
the heart and soul of a banjo. The rim (or shell) is the ring-shaped piece of
wood that, along with the tone ring, gives shape and definition to the banjo’s
sound. Banjo rims are made of maple, but beech, mahogany, and other woods
are sometimes used. Most rims are made from pieces of wood laminated
together and pressed into a circular shape. However, some rims are assem-
bled from blocks of glued-together wood and are called, appropriately
enough, block rims. Both types of rims are shown in Figure 9-8.
Rims are fairly standardized on quality bluegrass banjos, measuring 11" in
diameter and around 3⁄4" in thickness. Most bluegrass players desire a dense,
hard piece of maple for the rim because they feel that this type of wood con-
veys the banjo’s sound more efficiently. If the rim is made from hard rock
northern maple, then you’ve got a top-of-the-line rim most desired today by
bluegrass players.
You find much more variety in the sizes of rims used for open-back instru-
ments, because open-back banjos come in many different sizes. Open-back
rims can measure up to 12" in diameter but are typically thinner in width
than a standard bluegrass rim.
Just about everyone agrees that older is better when it comes to the wood
that goes into a banjo rim, but good wood is getting increasingly hard to
come by all over the world. Some of the best “new” rims made today are
assembled from North American old-growth wood or wood that has been
submerged underwater for many years. These rims are often glued together
by using organic hide glue, as used in the first half of the 20th century. An
“old wood” rim is often a valued component in a top-of-the-line banjo built by
a small shop, but you can also add this option to a quality banjo later.
207
Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide

The fellowship of the tone ring
The other vital part of the banjo pot is the tone ring, which sits on top of the
wooden rim, increases the banjo’s volume, and brightens its tone. On a more
a

208
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

expensive banjo, the tone ring should be made from high-quality brass (often
called bell brass), not aluminum. Bluegrass banjo tone rings come in the fol-
lowing two types:
 Flathead tone rings: Most banjos made today have flathead rings. Most
bluegrass banjo players, including the first-generation masters Earl
Scruggs and Don Reno, use this kind of ring. The flathead ring causes
more surface area of the banjo head to vibrate, thereby giving the banjo
a deeper tone.
 Arch-top tone rings: An arch-top ring is most common among banjos
from the 1920s and 1930s. This type of ring uses a different profile that
causes less surface area of the banjo head to vibrate, usually resulting in
a brighter tone. Bluegrass icon Ralph Stanley has long been associated
with the sound of an arch-top bluegrass banjo.
As in the case of banjo rims, some builders have gone to great lengths to 
re-create the exact metal formulas found in banjo tone rings from the 1930s
and 1940s, and these types of rings are found in the best (and most costly)
new bluegrass banjos. Bluegrass tone ring sizes have become more or less
standardized for new bluegrass banjos in the last 15 years, enabling players
to experiment with their banjo’s sound by swapping out one ring for another.
A player may spend $2,000 to $3,000 on a new professional quality banjo, only
to replace its tone ring somewhere down the line. These so-called pre-war for-
mula tone rings range in price from $375 to $1,500, but can dramatically
change the sound of an instrument.
You can find more variety in the kinds of tone rings used in quality open-back
banjos, but also keep in mind that some old-time players prefer banjos with
no tone ring at all (in this case, the head is simply stretched across the top of
the wooden rim). Other old-time players prefer banjos that use a rolled brass
hoop (called a hoop ring) for a tone ring. A hoop ring is a round, ring-shaped
piece of brass that sits in a channel cut into the top of the rim with the head
stretched across its top. The more muted tone of a hoop-ringed banjo is
sometimes just right for the old-time sound, and, better yet, these instru-
ments are usually less expensive than a banjo with a tone ring. 
Some open-back banjos have tone rings that are virtually the same as those
found on a matching model bluegrass banjo. However, new high-end open-back
banjos are often fitted with specially made replicas, using tone-ring designs
originally found on banjos dating back 100 years or more. The Tubaphone
and Whyte Laydie styles of ring are two examples of replica tone rings found
on many new professional grade open-back banjos today (see Figure 9-9 to
see all the different kinds of tone rings mentioned in this section).
209
Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide

Necks and resonators
Necks are typically made from maple (in either straight-grained or curly vari-
eties), mahogany, or walnut. If the banjo has a resonator, its wood is almost
always of the same kind as the neck (although some high-end bluegrass
banjos now offer maple necks with mahogany resonators). Most necks on
high-end banjos are made from a single piece of wood and are called one-
piece necks. Although these kinds of necks are preferred by most players,
some builders prefer to outfit a quality banjo with a two-piece neck for addi-
tional stability and durability.
Builders and players alike agree that the type of wood used in the neck can
have a significant impact on banjo sound, but actually describing these sub-
jective differences can be very difficult! Generally speaking, walnut necks
tend to impart the deepest tone of the three woods; maple necks add sweet-
ness and clarity to the banjo’s tone, while mahogany necks provide a more
immediate response. However, the tone of any individual instrument is the
result of many different factors acting together, including the mass of the neck
itself. You can get a variety of banjo sounds from any of these kinds of wood.
Many players choose one type of wood over another based on appearance.
You can make this factor the basis of your buying decision even on a 
professional-grade banjo as long as all the other component parts are of
high quality. Elaborately figured maple or walnut and deep-grained mahogany
are each beautiful in their own way. Go with what makes the best impression
on your senses — both visual and aural!
Radiused fingerboards
The fingerboard, or fretboard, is the thin strip of wood glued to the neck that
serves as a mounting surface for the frets. When you fret a note with your left
hand, you’re pushing against the fingerboard. Most banjo necks have a flat
fingerboard, but some players prefer a fingerboard that is curved across its
playing surface. This kind of fingerboard is called a radiused fingerboard and
is an option on more expensive bluegrass instruments. You can expect to pay
up to $200 or more for this option. However, if you’re into more progressive
bluegrass and jazz styles on the banjo, you may find that you can more easily
strut your left-hand stuff on a neck with a radiused fingerboard.

Banjo bling: Inlays, plating, and engraving
Banjos are not only usually louder than guitars or mandolins, but they’re tra-
ditionally adorned with more ornate decoration — yet another reason why
banjos rule! Aesthetic enhancements come in the form of elaborate inlay 
patterns in the neck and fingerboard, intricately carved neck heels, and
engraved metal parts (see Figure 9-10 for some stellar examples).
Banjos with gold-plated or chrome metal parts may also grab your attention.
These features not only brighten up the look of a banjo but some players
assert that gold plating also positively affects the banjo’s overall tone by soft-
ening it.
For both open-back and bluegrass banjos, builders tend to decorate their
banjos based on earlier tried-and-true designs. However, these days you can
find planets, space ships, peace signs, Buddhas, the family dog, and just
about anything else you can think of to adorn a banjo fingerboard on a
custom-built instrument.

Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide

Banjo bling can add to the cost of an instrument, but these decorative
aspects of a banjo don’t enhance its sound or playability (outside of the gold
plating). The overall worth of a banjo is determined by the quality of its com-
ponent parts and how well these parts have been put together. For a more
expensive banjo, the proof is always in the sound, not the bling. So don’t get
too carried away with appearance at the expense of good components, playa-
bility, and great sound.
Plugging in: Electric banjos
You can play just about any kind of music successfully on the banjo, and for
those musicians who want to play in a rock, country, or jazz context or who
just need the extra volume that comes with pickups and amplifiers, an elec-
tric banjo is just the ticket. These days, stylistic innovators such as Béla
Fleck and Alison Brown are coaxing all kinds of exciting new sounds from
electric banjos. Nothing is stopping you from forging your own bold musical
horizons on an electric instrument, so check out some of your options in the
sections that follow.
Adding a pickup to an acoustic banjo
If additional volume is the main concern, you can add an electric pickup to
your regular acoustic banjo and be ready to take the stage at the next Banjo-
palooza festival. Banjo pickups are attached to the coordinating rods inside
the pot of the banjo and use a small piece of metal that is placed underneath
one of the bridge feet as a pickup (see Figure 9-11). Installation is usually
quick and easy. You can select from several different kinds of banjo pickups
that range in price from $70 to $170 from the McIntyre, Jones, and Fishman
companies, as well as others.
Don’t expect the sound of your banjo with an electric pickup to exactly (or
even closely) resemble the acoustic sound of your banjo. Because of the
placement of the pickup inside the pot and the physics of electric sound
technology, you may be frustrated if you’re expecting great banjo sound from
this kind of setup. Remember, players elect to reinforce their banjo sound in
this way to get more volume, not to get better tone!
Boldly going electric
If you’re interested in getting all kinds of different sounds from an electrified
banjo and you have your sights on being the first banjo rock star, you want to
purchase a fully electric instrument. You need to budget from $400 at the low
end to $4,000 or more at the high end for a top-of-the-line custom-made banjo
equipped with a MIDI interface, which essentially turns your electric instru-
ment into a five-string synthesizer.
212
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Electric banjos combine some of the structural features of banjos with the
electronics and body shapes of electric guitars. Most electric banjos have a
banjo head integrated into its body with two electric pickups positioned
underneath the head. A toggle switch allows you to mix and match the differ-
ent tones of the pickups to get a wider variety of sounds than you would find
with an acoustic banjo outfitted with a pickup (and they also look really
cool). Some instruments, like the Nechville Meteor, have small banjo heads
and bodies that retain the circular banjo shape, but others, like the Deering
Crossfire, have standard-sized heads and a larger body with the look of an
electric guitar. 
Because the sound is relayed from the bridge to the head just like on an
acoustic banjo, these types of electric instruments retain the general sound
quality of an acoustic banjo, but they aren’t nearly as loud (until you plug
them in, that is!). You can also get sounds out of these electric marvels that
are very close to what you’d hear from an electric guitar, and the playability 
of these instruments is much closer to an electric guitar than a banjo as well.
The strings feel light and fast underneath your fingers, and you can play with a
lighter right-hand attack and still get a very big sound when you’re amped up.
Some electric banjos dispense entirely with the banjo head and have only
wood for their bodies. Called solid body electrics, this type of electric banjo
comes even closer to the design and sound of an electric guitar (but won’t
sound like an acoustic banjo at all). Check out three options for electric
banjos in Figure 9-12.

Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide

Finding many different types of electric banjos in one place may be difficult
except at the largest of national acoustic retail outlets or at a major banjo
camp or bluegrass festival (check out “Finding the Right Music Store” section
below for some tips on where to buy). If you make a purchase, find out
whether you can return an instrument for an exchange or refund if you find
that the banjo doesn’t suit your needs after playing it for a day or two.

Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Electric banjos are way cool, big fun, and allow you to live out your rock-and-
roll fantasies, but keep in mind that you can’t be heard on an electric banjo in
a jam session without plugging in to an amplifier. Even more important, elec-
tric instruments are usually not a welcome sight at your typical all-acoustic
bluegrass, folk, or old-time jam session. The electric banjo is best viewed as
an instrument that is designed for a different performance context than a reg-
ular banjo and should be used accordingly (or at least ask permission from
the other musicians before plugging in and wailing away on “Tom Dooley”).
Going vintage
If you explore the “used and vintage instruments” section of an acoustic spe-
cialty store’s Internet inventory, your eyes may likely pop out at the high
value of some older banjos. The most prized open-back banjos such as an
1890s Cole Eclipse (see Figure 9-13) can very easily change hands for $6,000
to $10,000 or more. A prized pre–World War II 1930s Gibson Mastertone flat-
head banjo (also shown in Figure 9-13) with an original five-string neck can go
for more than $100,000.

Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide

What’s up with this? Well, you can’t find anything like the beautiful craftsman-
ship of a 100-year-old ornate vintage open-back banjo or the rich, booming
sound of an old flathead Gibson banjo — in the eyes and ears of the right
beholder that is! Demand has fueled the market for vintage instruments 
of all kinds in recent years, which has caused resale prices to take a dramatic
leap, not only for banjos but also for mandolins and acoustic and electric 
guitars.
One irony of this situation is that many of the best players, including those
who make their living playing banjos, most likely can’t afford these holy
grails. These instruments tend to be purchased by amateur players or collec-
tors with disposable income who often view vintage banjos as long-term
investments.
Buying a very expensive vintage instrument without first thoroughly educating
yourself about the history of banjo manufacturing, knowing which instru-
ments players and collectors treasure, and getting a handle on the ever-
changing state of the market is unwise. A good way to begin is to read up on
banjo history and visit those Internet sites of stores carrying vintage invento-
ries (see the following section for a list of these stores). Track resale prices
on those instruments that interest you most and start saving for a big future
purchase!
Finding the Right Music Store
The first store you think to visit on your banjo quest could be the local
branch of one of those large national music outlets designed to serve cus-
tomers more interested in rock music. As you enter through the front door,
you’re blasted by a shriek of heavy metal electric guitar. You gradually
regain your hearing as Music Store Dude, a teenaged sales clerk dressed
in black from head to toe with piercings in various parts of his anatomy,
approaches you.
You meekly ask, “Do you have any banjos?” Music Store Dude sneers, shrugs,
and raises his eyes to the ceiling, leaving you to explore the deep recesses of
the cavernous store. If you’re lucky, you may find a dust-covered beginner’s
instrument sitting forlornly in a corner, but you can’t tell what it sounds like
because the banjo’s sorely out of tune. Even if the banjo was playable, you
couldn’t hear it anyway because of the young Jimi Hendrix wannabe wailing
over in the next aisle. Consider it time to leave and find a music store better
fitted for your needs (and your hearing).
216
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

In the following sections, I help you find a store that can provide you with
quality service and banjos — either in person or online.
Buying from an acoustic specialty store
Banjo music is real music made by real musicians. You don’t have synthesiz-
ers, lip-synching, or wardrobe malfunctions in the styles of music you play
on the banjo (well, alright, there was that Beverly Hillbillies episode where
Lester Flatt’s city-raised wife shrunk his clothes by boiling them in Granny’s
iron kettle, but that doesn’t count). When you go looking to buy a banjo, you
should start with a retail outlet that specializes not only in acoustic music,
but whose staff also knows something about banjos. If that store has a variety
of different banjos and the sales staff can offer advice as to which banjo is
going to be best suited to your musical aspirations, then you can feel confi-
dent that you’ve found a good place to shop. If the store hosts weekly jam
sessions and has a banjo teacher on staff, even better!
Start your search by looking in your local yellow pages under “Music
Instruments: Retail.” Let your fingers do the walking until you find a listing
that indicates a focus on acoustic, folk, and bluegrass music. Here’s an exam-
ple from my yellow pages in the San Francisco Bay Area: “Since 1969; New -
Used - Vintage; Guitars - Mandolins - Banjos; Harps - Violins - Ukuleles;
Repairs - Appraisals; We Buy Used Instruments,” followed by a Web site
address. A quick search on the Internet showed me that this particular
store’s inventory included banjos in a wide range of price categories. You
should be looking for this kind of store.
If you can find a similar store in your area, the drive is worth it, even if it takes
you several hours away from home. By taking the time to get to know the
folks who work at this store, you can not only have access to their expertise,
but you also get lots of good advice regarding local teachers, jam sessions,
concerts, festivals, and workshops.
If you’re considering a purchase of a professional quality instrument — a
banjo that could easily cost $2,000 or more — your visit to an acoustic spe-
cialty store is practically mandatory. Whether you’re buying a beginner’s
instrument or the best that they’ve got in stock, you want to actually see
and play as many different banjos as possible. As you compare each banjo’s
sound, construction, craftsmanship, and playability, don’t be afraid to ask a
lot of questions of the banjo specialist at the store.
217
Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide

Buying online
The Internet is a great place to buy some things, but what about a banjo? If
you’re a new player and don’t have a more experienced banjo-playing friend
or a teacher to help you, I’d advise against it. Internet buying usually requires
a knowledgeable buyer, and if you’re new to banjos, you may not be able to
make the best purchase on your own. Take the stress off yourself and make
that personal connection with the acoustic specialty store to find just the
right instrument for you and your budget. You support your regional acoustic
music scene and aren’t at the mercy of the dreaded Music Store Dude!
If you’re already playing and looking to step up to a better-sounding instru-
ment, shopping on the Internet can be a positive experience. The key is
knowing what you’re looking for and being an educated buyer in regard to the
particular instrument you’re looking for (check out “Stepping Up to a Better
Banjo” earlier in this chapter for help in how to begin your banjo search).
Many of the best regional music stores maintain an active presence on the
Internet and update their inventory daily on their homepages. Several of
these retail outlets have a true international reach and are very dependable
places to buy both new and used instruments and accessories.
Be sure to check an Internet store’s return policy before you purchase. Don’t
buy from anyone who won’t allow you to return a banjo that you don’t like
after you’ve had it for a couple of days. And for now, I’d totally avoid online
purchases from individual buyers, unless you’ve been able to establish direct
phone contact with a seller and come to total agreement on a return policy,
method of payment, and how the instrument is to be shipped. Finally, never
buy an instrument from someone claiming in an e-mail to be a member of a
royal family or who wants to send $10 million dollars to you along with your
banjo!
Getting you started: A banjo 
store directory
Here’s a short list of some of the best regional and national stores that spe-
cialize in new and used resonator and open-back banjos, along with their
Web-site addresses. Each store is a brick-and-mortar walk-in establishment 
as well as a retail outlet providing excellent Internet and telephone customer
service. Inventory varies at each store depending upon what’s in stock:

Chapter 9: Finding Your Banjo Bliss: A Buyer’s Guide
Please Mr. Postman: Shipping your banjo
If you purchase a banjo that has to be mailed to
you, I strongly suggest paying more and using
an overnight or two-day service for shipping.
Package companies do inflict damage on
banjos every now and then. However, shipping
by air, rather than by the cheaper ground ser-
vice, dramatically decreases the risk of your
new banjo arriving in multiple pieces.
If your banjo does meet unfortunate circum-
stances in transit, immediately contact the store
or buyer from which you made the purchase.
The store will arrange for the shipping company
to come and inspect the banjo. Then, they either
take the instrument with them or have you
return it. Be sure to save all packing materials,
because this is crucial evidence in the shipping
company’s determination of damages. A rep-
utable music store either sends a replacement
or arranges for a repair as soon as the damaged
banjo is received.

 Picking up the essentials
 Choosing accessories that make practicing more fun
 Upgrading banjo parts to make your instrument sound better

anjo players are real “gear heads.” They keep up on the latest products
that help get banjos from one place to another with greater ease, make
practicing and playing more fun, and make their instruments sound better.
Join me for a voyage to the Island of Banjo Gear in this chapter, where you
encounter items (like cases, strings, picks, straps, capos, and tuners) that are
just about essential for happy picking and other things (like metronomes,
computer software and banjo bridges, heads, tailpieces and “D” tuners) that
just make playing a lot more fun or can improve the sound of your banjo. 
(Are you still in the market for a banjo? If so, sail on back to Chapter 9 for a
complete banjo buyer’s guide.)
If the significant others in your household start to complain about how long
your banjo gear wish list has become after you complete this chapter, feel
free to go ahead and put the blame on me!
Picking Up the Stuff You Really Need
Whether you’re practicing at home or playing in a jam session at a festival, all
banjo players need to have certain pieces of equipment — in addition to the
actual banjo, of course. The following sections provide the vital info on the
stuff you don’t want to be without either at home or on the road.
At the top of this list is a banjo case (after all, you won’t enhance the reputa-
tion of banjo players very much if you carry your banjo around town without
something to put it in — and no brown paper bags, please!). Although most
new instruments come with a case, you may want to grab a lightweight gig

bag to make walking around the festival campground a breeze or consider a
deluxe flight case so you can take your banjo with you on your next vacation
(won’t that make your family happy!). Check out the following sections for the
total lowdown on banjo storage and transport.
Cases: Becoming King of the Road
Most banjos stand up pretty well to the rigors of changing temperatures and
humidity in a house, but even so, you want a good case for keeping your baby
safe when you aren’t practicing and for providing secure transport to your
next lesson, rehearsal, or gig (yes, banjo players occasionally do get work).
Cases come in four basic varieties: hard-shell, soft-shell, gig bag, and flight
cases. Each of these cases have a time and a place, but keep in mind that the
primary purpose of a case is to protect your instrument. Usually, the more
you invest in a case, the better that protection is. If you plan on traveling a
great deal with your banjo, including taking your banjo with you on an airplane,
choosing the right case for a quality instrument is an important decision — a
decision I help you make in the following sections.
Cases or bags usually aren’t included in the purchase price with most entry-
level banjos. Although you can go through life without proper storage for
your instrument, it makes good sense to budget an extra $30 to $50 for a
simple case or bag. In addition to providing some basic protection for your
banjo, you have a pocket or two to store some of your other accessories, like
picks, a tuner, and a capo.

Come fly with me: Banjos on a plane!
Whether you’re headed to your next vacation
spot or your destination is halfway across the
country to attend a music camp or festival,
sooner or later you’ll want to take your banjo
with you on an airplane. I fly with my most valu-
able instrument frequently and although I’ve
never had an instrument damaged in transit (as
I write with fingers crossed), I know many other
musicians who have had pegheads snapped,
necks broken, and flanges busted on their way
to or from a show. 
Even in the best of conditions, you can never be
entirely sure how you’ll be able to store your
banjo on an airplane, and this unpredictability
can be maddening. Despite this state of affairs,
here are a few valuable strategies that I’ve
picked up over the years in dealing with banjos
at 30,000 feet. All of these tips are directed
towards the primary goal of getting your banjo
on board with you as carry-on luggage:

223
Chapter 10: Getting the Right Stuff: Banjo Gear
 Travel with a flight case. No matter what
happens, you’re still offering your instru-
ment the best protection possible with a
flight case. Taking your banjo in a gig bag is
an alternative option that works for some
musicians. But the idea of using gig bags on
a plane has always made me nervous,
because if you’re one of the last on board a
full plane and the overhead compartments
are full, you still have to surrender your banjo
to a flight attendant for storage down below.
If this happens to you and your banjo is in a
gig bag, your banjo won’t have close to the
same kind of protection a flight case offers.
If I know that I’ll be doing a lot of heavy lifting
with the banjo after I get to my destination, I
also bring along a gig bag, temporarily stuffed
with clothing, and check that as baggage. I
can then use the gig bag as my primary
means of banjo transport after I’ve landed.
 Know your airlines, figure out their board-
ing procedures, and choose routes with as
few changes of planes as possible. In my
experience, Southwest Airlines is the most
accommodating of all carriers for allowing
banjos on board. United, Jet Blue, Virgin,
Delta and West Jet are pretty good;
American and Alaska Airlines are fair;
America West is poor and is to be avoided
(I include these airlines because they’re the
ones I’ve used most frequently in the last
decade). Boarding procedures vary by air-
line, by plane, by airport, and seemingly by
the mood of the airline workers on that day.
Despite these obstacles, see what you can
do to figure out how to be in one of the first
boarding groups. For instance, if you know
that passengers board a particular plane
from the rear to the front, book a seat in the
rear. Apart from the individual airline’s policy,
the key to getting your instrument on board is
getting yourself on the plane while overhead
and closet space is still available for storage.
 Don’t draw attention to your banjo while
checking in and boarding. Act like taking
your banjo on board as a carry-on is a nat-
ural thing, and it will be! If you approach an
airline representative saying “I have a banjo
with me. What should I do with it?” you could
be asking for trouble, especially if the repre-
sentative hasn’t had enough morning coffee.
 Don’t try to preboard with your banjo.
Unless you have an otherwise valid reason,
carrying a banjo with you usually isn’t
deemed a good enough reason to earn
membership in the preboarding group. For
every time this strategy has succeeded, I’ve
been stopped an equal number of times by
an airline representative. In one case, I was
put on the plane last because I had the
nerve to request a preboard with a banjo!
 Be friendly, cooperative, and creative in
order to get your banjo onboard. If you’re
courteous and exercise some creative think-
ing, you’ll be treated with respect in return
from the flight attendants and the other pas-
sengers whose help you’re going to need to
get your banjo on board. I was once the last
person to board a Seattle to Oakland flight
with seemingly no room left in the overhead
bins. After politely explaining to the flight
attendant that I was carrying my most valu-
able possession with me, she helped me
rearrange quite a few overhead bags to make
room for my banjo, after we asked passen-
gers’ permission to gently displace them. On
another flight, the attendant removed her own
bags and tucked the banjo behind the last
seat. The bottom line: If you make a request
with kindness, you receive the same in return.
 Remove items from your case that won’t get
through the security checkpoint.These items
include strings, wire cutters, screwdrivers,
banjo wrenches, and other tools you may use
for banjo setup, but not fingerpicks or tuners.

Hard- and soft-shell cases
Hard-shell cases are the most common case option and usually accompany
most intermediate to high-quality banjo purchases (see Figure 10-1). Hard-
shell cases are made of wood and are covered with nylon or fabric (I espe-
cially like the vintage tweed look myself). This type of case is usually just fine
for day-to-day use, as long as the banjo fits in it well. With proper care, a
hard-shell case should last for many years. Expect to pay from $75 to $135 for
one of these, if you’re purchasing the case separately.
Soft-shell cases are usually made of cardboard. Although they prevent your
banjo from getting wet if some over-enthusiastic audience member spills her
beer while requesting “Rocky Top” for the umpteenth time, keeping your
banjo dry is about all these cases are good for. At around $30, they’re an inex-
pensive option and are lightweight, but they don’t offer much protection for
your instrument. If you paid more than $400 for your banjo, go for broke and
invest in a hard-shell case or a well-padded gig bag.
A banjo is usually damaged while inside a case due to a loose fit that allows
the banjo to move inside the case when it meets an impact. If you’re purchas-
ing a hard-shell case separately, look for the tightest fit possible between the
inside of the case and the instrument. Padding on the inside top of the case
and plenty of support for the neck are characteristics of a case that should
provide good protection. If you can see or feel the banjo move within the
case when you gently shake it, the case isn’t doing its job. Keep looking for
something that fits your banjo more snugly. Look to these brands, among
others, for good quality in hard-shell cases: Ameritage, Golden Gate,
American Vintage, Canadian/TKL, and Gold Tone.
Gig bags
Many musicians prefer the soft, padded gig bag either as their main case of
choice or as an alternative way of getting around with the banjo when weight
and portability are important considerations (check out the gig bag look in
Figure 10-1). Gig bags range from $30 for a no-frills nylon model to $300 for a
fine leather-padded bag that offers almost as much protection as a hard-shell
case (short of driving a tour bus over it).
Gig bags are lighter than hard-shell cases and are great when you need to
walk with your banjo over considerable distances at a banjo camp or blue-
grass festival. Higher quality gig bags have more padding, thereby offering
more protection for your banjo, and are often outfitted with shoulder straps
that convert it into a backpack. Storage for accessories is also more generous
on higher-priced models than what you find with hard-shell cases.
Check out the following brands, among others, when you’re shopping for
quality gig bags: Reunion Blues, Colorado Case, Superior Trailpak, and
Boulder Alpine.

Flight cases
If you ever plan on flying with an expensive banjo or you just want to pile all
of Aunt Myrna’s heaviest luggage on top of your banjo case in the trunk of
your car without fear, a flight case may be in your future. Flight cases are the
Hummers of the banjo-case world; heavy and large, they offer the utmost in
protection for your instrument (see Figure 10-2). Made from molded fiber-
glass, flight cases are watertight, offer extensive protection from movement
inside the case, and have generous inside storage and functional external
locks. One case should last a lifetime.
I bet you can already predict the negatives of this type of case. Yes, you
guessed it: price and weight. You can expect to pay $575 or more for top-of-
the-line cases, and you may have to be on a waiting list for a few months to
get one in your favorite exterior and interior color combination. These cases
are also heavy, as in really heavy — weighing in at 10 to 15 pounds. After you
put a ten-pound bluegrass banjo in one of these, you’re carrying around as
much as 25 pounds of music. Believe me, you’ll start to feel this somewhere
between Concourse A and Concourse D!
However, flight cases are the way to go if you’re looking for the best protec-
tion available for your instrument. Check out Price and Calton deluxe banjo
cases if you’re looking to buy the best.

Strings: You can’t pick without ’em
You’ve probably figured out by now that you need all five strings on your banjo
to make good music (if not, you may want to start at the first chapters of this
book!). Although your banjo probably had all its strings when you got it,
these strings aren’t lifetime guaranteed; it isn’t unusual for a string to break
every now and then while you’re tuning or playing. In this case, you need to
have the right kind of replacement string on hand to continue playing. 
The most economical way to buy strings is to purchase a set that contains all
five strings. String sets aren’t expensive; you should expect to pay from $3 to
$8 for a good name-brand set, and it isn’t uncommon to get a discount for
purchasing multiple sets. You also can buy individual strings from most
music stores. If you need to replace one string on your banjo more frequently
than the others (for most players, it’s the 1st string), you should purchase
several extras of this particular string so that you don’t have to constantly
break up entire sets. Note: You need to ask a sales clerk for help with pur-
chasing individual strings, because stores usually don’t put them on display.
Most players keep one or more extra string sets on hand to replace broken
strings on the spot. Many players replace an entire set of strings when they
sound dull, build up a lot of grit and grime, or become difficult to tune (visit
Chapter 11 for a step-by-step guide on to how to change strings). Be sure to
throw one or two sets in your case, along with a small pair of wire cutters to
slice off the unneeded string ends.
A dizzying array of different kinds of banjo strings is available today. Your
choice should be determined by the kind of banjo you play, the sound you
want to get, and how you want the strings to feel when you play them. The
following sections share the secrets of making good string choices.
Loop-end and ball-end strings
Banjo strings come in loop-end and ball-end varieties, shown in Figure 10-3.
You use one or the other depending on the design of your banjo’s tailpiece
(the tailpiece holds one end of the strings at the pot end of the banjo; differ-
ent kinds of tailpieces require different kinds of strings, as explained in the
following section): 
 A tailpiece with finger-like attachments made for grabbing the loops that
you can find at one end of the strings takes loop-end strings. The great
majority of banjo tailpieces feature this design, and most of the strings
you’ll find available are loop-end strings. Nylon and gut strings (see the
following section) require that you tie your own looped ends to the
banjo’s tailpiece.
227
Chapter 10: Getting the Right Stuff: Banjo Gear

 If your tailpiece has only small holes at its end, you need ball-end strings
for your banjo. The round ball at the end of the string prevents it from
feeding itself back through the small tailpiece hole. 
Nickel-plated, stainless-steel, nylon, and gut strings
Practically all bluegrass players and most clawhammer players (see Chapters
4, 5, 6, and 8 to discover these ways of playing banjo) use nickel-plated or
stainless-steel strings. These two kinds of steel string sets include a wound 4th
string, which has additional wire wrapped around its core to add thickness
and mass to the banjo’s lowest-pitched string. Both kinds of metal strings
produce the bright, ringing sound that is associated with the banjo and are
appropriate for all kinds of playing at any ability level.
Steel string sets differ according to the kind of material used as a wrap
around the 4th string. Fourth strings can be wound with bronze, stainless
steel, nickel, or monel (a nickel alloy). Each type of winding provides a
slightly different tonal quality: 
 Bronze and stainless-steel 4th strings tend to produce a brighter sound. 
 Monel produces a darker tone.
 Nickel falls somewhere in the middle.

Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Some open-back banjo players prefer to use nylon or gut strings on their
banjos. These strings produce a more authentic sound for clawhammer, clas-
sic, and minstrel styles. (Yes, I do mean gut strings, as in a totally carbon-
based, once-was-a-life-form product. Visit Chapter 7 to find out more about
classic and minstrel styles). 
A new type of string has recently caught the ear of many players: a synthetic
string called nylgut, which combines the durability and affordability of a
nylon string with the preferred “natural” tone of a gut string. It’s a great alter-
native to both nylon and gut, and you should try it if you want that organic
sound without having to actually harm any living thing in the process.
You need to search out an acoustic specialty store to find the relatively rare
types of strings such as nylon, gut, and nylgut. If you want an alternative to
steel strings, try them all and see which one suits your banjo and your way of
playing the best.
String gauges: Light, medium, or heavy
String thickness is expressed in terms of string gauge and is measured in thou-
sandths of an inch, believe it or not! A light gauge string set has slightly thin-
ner strings (and smaller gauge numbers) than a medium or heavy gauge set.
Your preference in strings should be determined by your playing style, your
banjo, and the kind of sound you want to produce with your instrument.
You can find a wide variety of string sets available today (an example is
shown in Figure 10-4), but the most important thing to remember is that
designers put string sets together according to whether they are loop- or ball-
end and also by the diameter of the strings and to the kind of wrap used
around the low 4th string. 
My own string preferences have evolved over the years. These days, I prefer
lighter-gauge strings because they sound the best to me on my banjo, and
they enable me to play fast as I creep into middle age! For bluegrass playing,
I prefer to use a string set with the following string gauges: .010, .011, .013,
.020w, and .010. Now let me translate! My first string is 10/1,000th of an inch
thick; my second string is 11/1,000th of an inch thick; and so on. My fourth
string measures 20/1,000th of an inch thick, and is a wound string (hence the
w). You name the 5th string last; it will almost always be of the same gauge as
the 1st string. This is how catalogs and store Web sites describe string sets (I
bet you never associated the banjo with such precision!).
Many other players prefer medium gauge string sets because of their tone and
playability. A typical medium gauge set may have the following gauges: .011,
.012, .014, .022w, and .011. As you can see, these strings feature variations of
only a couple of thousandths of an inch compared to a light set, but you can
definitely feel and hear the difference as you play. The heavier the gauge of
string, the stiffer it feels against your fingers and the darker its sound will be.
Unless you’re playing a banjo with a long neck or are experimenting with tuning
229
Chapter 10: Getting the Right Stuff: Banjo Gear

the banjo below normal pitch, most players don’t use heavy gauge strings.
However, these are available as individual string options from acoustic spe-
cialty retailers.
I can’t identify a single best set of strings — this is something that you figure
out over time. You should try different gauges and types of strings to see
what works best for you. Don’t be surprised if your choices change many
times over the years as you continue to play banjo.
Here’s a short list of some of the most popular strings brands: GHS, American
Made Banjo Company, D’Addario, Elixir, Gibson, John Pearse, Black Diamond,
LaBella, Martin/Vega, Chris Sands (for classic nylon strings), and Aquila (for
gut and nylgut strings).
Picks: Giving your fingers playing power
A thumbpick and one or more fingerpicks give you the ability to play with
more volume, greater dynamics, and a more forceful attack. Whether or not
you need picks is dependent upon the style of music you’re making and your
personal taste in how you want your music to sound. Most (but not all) play-
ers feel that clawhammer and other old-time styles sound best when played
with the bare fingers of your right hand and most all classic and minstrel
style players go pick-less in their playing. However, the bluegrass style pretty
much requires the use of a plastic or metal thumbpick along with two metal
fingerpicks shaped to fit the player’s index and middle fingers. 
Although the feel of the picks on the ends of your digits can be uncomfort-
able at first, in the long run you’ll play with more volume and power for the
styles that need it.
Figure 10-4:
A typical
five-string

230
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Numerous choices of thumb and fingerpicks patiently await you at your local
acoustic music store. They range in price from a couple bucks to $35 or more
for a pair of hand-crafted, stainless-steel fingerpicks. 
You should try as many different kinds of picks as you can to hear what
makes your banjo playing sound the best. Check out Chapter 4 for detailed
information on selecting picks that are right for you and for tips on how to fit
them on your fingers.
Straps: Take a load off!
A quality banjo weighs up to ten pounds, so using a comfortable strap can
save wear and tear on your back, shoulder, and neck. And banjo players don’t
use straps only to play while standing up. If the banjo neck is heavier than the
banjo pot, which is the case on most entry-level instruments (see Chapter 1
for more info on banjo parts), you should use a properly fitted strap even
while sitting down. This helps balance the weight of the banjo and frees up
your left hand for gymnastic feats of fretting. 
Banjo straps range in price from $8, for a simple nylon or woven-fabric strap,
to $60 or more, for a fancy, handmade leather beauty. I prefer a simple and
sturdy leather strap that has little to no decoration; these cost about $40.
You also may want to explore dual shoulder strap models and straps with
shoulder pads, because these types of straps help cushion the impact of the
banjo on your body.
Don’t try to fit a strap by attaching one end of it to the banjo peghead. Banjo
straps attach to the tension hooks of your banjo pot by using metal or plastic
clips or with the strap ends fastened to the banjo with Chicago screws (see
Chapter 2 for detailed help with fitting a strap on your instrument). 
If you have an extra guitar strap around your house, you can turn it into a
serviceable temporary strap for a lighter banjo; just attach shoelaces to each
end and securely tie the shoelaces around the banjo’s tension hooks.
Capos: Playing easily in different keys
Capo is shorthand for the Italian word capotasto, which unfortunately doesn’t
refer to the latest variety of flavored cappuccino drink. It literally means
“head of fretboard.” A capo (pronounced KAY-po) is an adjustable tension
clamp that shortens the effective length of the fingerboard of your banjo (the
fingerboard is the flat surface of the neck that’s used by the left hand to fret
231
Chapter 10: Getting the Right Stuff: Banjo Gear

the strings). In so doing, the capo also shortens the length of your strings
(which causes them to sound higher in pitch). A capo allows you to play in
different keys by transferring the chords, licks, and songs you already play to
a new place on the banjo neck. A capo is a required piece of musical gear to
take along whenever you may be playing music with others.
Banjo capos are designed to fret the 4th to the 1st strings on your banjo, but
not the short 5th string. Because the 5th string needs to be raised the same
number of frets as the other strings when using a capo, it gets its own special
equipment to raise its pitch when you also use a capo on the other strings.
Raising the pitch of the banjo to play in a new key is a two-step process: First,
you apply the capo to raise strings 1 through 4 and then you work with the
5th string to adjust its pitch.
The following sections explore capo options, how to properly use a capo, and
the equipment you can use to raise the 5th string’s pitch.
Choosing a capo
Banjo capos cost between $5 and $100. Your choices range from inexpensive
elastic-band models to spring-loaded capos to fancy, professional, hand-tooled,
stainless-steel capos in velvet cases (really, I’m not kidding!). Figure 10-5
shows a variety of capos that you can choose from.
A banjo player uses a capo a lot, so it doesn’t make sense to cut corners with
this purchase. Fortunately, you can find perfectly good capos for under $20.
Although some players prefer spring-loaded capos for quick installation and
removal, I use a capo that wraps all the way around the banjo’s neck and
attaches to the banjo using a quick-release button lock. I control the amount
of tension that the capo applies to the strings by loosening or tightening a
Figure 10-5:
Different

capos allow

232
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

thumbscrew in the back. One advantage of this kind of capo is that you can
place it out of the way behind the nut when you aren’t using it (the nut is the
white strip below the first fret that guides the strings from the fingerboard to
the headstock).
Using a capo
Here’s a step-by-step guide to hassle-free capo use:
1. Bring the edge of the capo just behind (but not on top of) the fret on
the banjo neck where you want to place it. 
As indicated in Figure 10-6a.
2. Slowly tighten the adjustment screw a few turns while maintaining
pressure on the top of the capo with your other hand.
Just as in Figure 10-6b.
3. When you think that the capo is tight enough, try playing a few notes
with the right hand. 
4. Continue to tighten the adjustment screw just until all the fretted
strings sound clear with no buzzing. 
Don’t apply any more pressure than is needed because this will cause
the strings to sound sharp.
5. Experiment with capo placement: some capos may apply just the right
amount of pressure if they are a slight distance away from the fret
instead of right up against it (as in Figure 10-6c); however, in most
cases, you’ll stay in tune more easily and your banjo will sound better
with the capo positioned as close to the fret as possible.

Tuning with a capo
It’s not uncommon to find that the banjo has gone just a bit out of tune with
the capo on, even if it was in very fine tune without it. When this happens to
you, don’t retune by using the tuning pegs, because this will result in an out-
of-tune banjo when you take the capo off again. Here’s what you should do:
 If the string is sharp (which it usually is when using the capo), try push-
ing down on the string on the bridge side of the capo (as in Figure 10-7a).
 If the string is flat, press down on the string at the peghead (see Fig-
ure 10-7b). You’ll be equalizing the tension of the string on both sides of
the capo with this slick maneuver and the string should still remain in
tune when removing the capo.
Some spring-loaded capos grip the strings with such force that they cause
the strings to fret sharp, causing the banjo to go out of tune. Be sure to select
a capo with adjustable tension to deal with this common problem.

The 5th-string capo and spikes: 
Going along for the ride
If you place a capo at the second fret, you also need to raise the pitch of your
5th string the same number of frets so that all your banjo strings are in the
same relationship as before you used the capo. How does that work? In this
case, the 5th string is so special that it gets its own equipment to raise its
pitch. Check out the following options to achieve this miraculous 5th string
feat:
 Slide-mounted 5th-string capos: The distinguishing characteristic of this
capo is the long, slim metal bar that is attached with two small screws to
the banjo neck. You slide the capo along the bar to the fret you want to
use, and then lower the capo against the string by tightening the thumb-
screw. Because the hand screw controls the amount of tension against
the string, the 5th string stays in better tune with this kind of capo.
Disadvantages? The metal bar adds just a bit of width to the neck and
your left hand may have to move around the capo screw when moving
up and down the neck. However, this kind of capo works well for many
players.
 Fifth-string railroad spikes: Another ingenious solution to the problem
of raising the 5th string’s pitch is to use the small railroad spikes from
the train tracks of an HO gauge model train set. The spikes are gently
nailed into the banjo fingerboard above the 5th string with the hook of
the spike remaining just high enough off of the fingerboard to hook the
5th string behind the appropriate fret. Hey, I know this sounds strange,
but I’m completely serious here!
Luckily, you don’t have to ruin your neighbor’s model train display by
hiring a bunch of miniature John Henrys to steal the spikes right off of
the track. This operation is best left to a good repair person, but if you
insist on doing this yourself, you can buy a package of spikes with instruc-
tions from most acoustic specialty stores. The spikes are installed at the
frets where you want or need them. Most players have just two spikes
installed for the 5th string at the seventh and ninth frets for playing in
the keys of A and B, but some players prefer having additional spikes at
other frets.
The more spikes you want on your banjo, the more you need to have a pro-
fessional repair person do this installation work for you. Placing the spike in
just the right place so that it doesn’t get in the way of your left-hand fretting
fingers or any other spikes when in use is important.
235
Chapter 10: Getting the Right Stuff: Banjo Gear

If you have 5th-string spikes already installed on your banjo, look to see
which way the hook is pointed. Most spikes are installed so that the hook
points down towards the 1st string. If this is the case, you can hook the 5th
string underneath the spike by pushing the string down and underneath the
hook (as I show in Figure 10-8). At first you may need both hands pushing
down on the string on either side of the spike to do this, but after a few tries,
you should get the hang of it.
Your 5th string will probably be sharp after it’s underneath the spike, so take
a moment to tune it to the rest of your banjo. Now you’re ready to pick!
Electronic tuners: Getting 
by with a little help
I’m not sure how banjo players survived in the era before portable tuners!
Although these amazing little devices never replace a good ear, they have
made getting the banjo in tune a lot easier by adding a visual reinforcement
to what you hear. Tuners especially come in handy at a festival, a jam ses-
sion, or even onstage — where you sometimes have so much noise around
you that using your ear alone to tune the banjo is difficult. Just about every-
one carries a portable tuner along with them, and you should too.
You want to choose a chromatic tuner. Unlike a guitar or bass tuner, a chromatic
tuner gives you all the notes available in Western music (what more could you
ask for?). Believe it or not, you’ll eventually need most if not all of these refer-
ence points for tuning your banjo, especially if you’re an old-time player.
Tuners give an astounding amount of information to help you get in tune.
When you pick a string, the tuner responds by indicating which note you’re
closest to and a moving needle tells you just how sharp or flat you are from
Figure 10-8:

spike to

5th string’s

236
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

that note. As you tune the string up or down in pitch, the meter responds
accordingly, letting you know when you’ve tuned your string exactly to the
correct pitch. Tuners also work equally well whether or not you’re using a
capo (but don’t forget, if you’re tuning with a capo in position, you’ll get dif-
ferent note readings than you would if the banjo were in an open position).
There are two main varieties of portable tuners:
 Internal microphone tuners: These tuners (one is shown in Figure 10-9)
have a built-in microphone that picks up the sound of your banjo if the
tuner is placed on a nearby music stand, table top, or even resting on your
knee. These tuners are affordable at $20 or more and are durable (I have
a Boss tuner of this type that’s lasted over 20 years). On the downside,
although these tuners can be accurate in a quiet room, they experience
problems if another musician is playing nearby or if the room has too
much ambient noise. 
 Clip-on tuners: Portable clip-on tuners made a huge splash on the acoustic
scene when they were introduced about a decade ago. These types of
tuners attach directly to your banjo at the peghead or onto the pot and
focus only on the sound of your instrument, excluding whatever noise is
around you. This feature is a real lifesaver if you’re trying to tune while
other musicians are playing or if you’re in a workshop with 15 other
players, who are all using their clip-on tuners to tune at the same time!
One disadvantage of these tuners is that they’re sometimes not as accu-
rate as the internal microphone variety of tuner. They also tend to be more
delicate and a bit more expensive, with prices running from $30 to $60.

237
Chapter 10: Getting the Right Stuff: Banjo Gear

Many tuners have a backlight that allows you to see the tuner’s readout in a
dim or dark environment. You pay more for this feature, but you may be sur-
prised at how often this little light comes in handy around a festival campfire
or waiting in the backstage wings for your American Banjo Idol audition.
Collecting More Cool Tools 
to Help Your Playing
From banjo mutes to string winders and finger exercisers to torque wrenches,
there’s no end to the available accessories promising to make you a better
player. Although buying everything in sight is tempting, you want to know
about a few items that can actually enhance your playing and make your
banjo sound its best. 
Metronomes and drum machines
Keeping a steady rhythm is essential to great banjo playing and figuring out
how to play with a metronome or drum machine is a good way to develop
this important musical skill. 
A metronome maintains a steady beat at whatever tempo you choose while a
drum machine goes to the next level by providing realistic drum sounds for
different styles and rhythms at different speeds. In either case, it’s difficult
for most players to jump right in and start playing along. In the following sec-
tions, I show you different kinds of metronomes and provide a practical guide
to using these tools in your daily practice routine. 
How they work
The metronome has come a long way from the pyramid-shaped wooden box
with the moving pendulum that used to sit on top of your grandmother’s piano
all those years ago (although there’s no question that these retro models are
still very cool). Today’s metronomes use digital technology to combine a
myriad of features in increasingly small packages (see Figure 10-10). Although
they all share the primary function of allowing you to control the speed of a
clicking beat, most electronic metronomes also provide a visual component,
with small lights and arrows providing additional cues for playing in rhythm. 
The more expensive the metronome, the more bells and whistles you get
(and I mean this quite literally!). You can find metronome and tuner combos,
tiny in-ear metronomes, as well as deluxe models that allow you to stack
rhythms one on top of another. Expect to shell out from $25 to $160, depend-
ing upon which bells and whistles suit you best.
238
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Drum machines do everything that metronomes can do, but they’re also
capable of emulating hundreds of percussion sounds. Most models have pre-
sets that instantly give you satisfying jazz, country, funk, and rock backing
rhythms, but you can create your own drum sounds as well. Turn it on and
set the speed and the preset, and you’ve got an instant drummer cooking
underneath your banjo playing! Many professional players prefer practicing
with a drum machine, and if you follow in their footsteps, you’ll spend from
$180 to $300 for a current model.
Playing along with the metronome
I rely on my trusty metronome to assist me in checking my rhythmic accu-
racy and to help me increase speed. Unfortunately, metronomes don’t come
with instructions on how to use them, and figuring out how to get started on
your own isn’t easy. Here’s a step-by-step guide to playing with the
metronome with examples oriented towards the bluegrass player (for more
on bluegrass banjo, see Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 8):
1. With banjo in hand, set the metronome to around 66 beats per minute. 
If your metronome has the option of accenting a particular beat, turn
this feature off for now.
2. Start counting in a cycle of four beats, saying one number for each
metronome click: one, two, three, four, and repeat.
3. Because bluegrass roll patterns have eight notes in them, play two of
these roll notes for every metronome click. 
Pick one note when you hear the click and the second note exactly half
way between one click and the next.

239
Chapter 10: Getting the Right Stuff: Banjo Gear

4. Use an alternating thumb roll to get started; continue until you’ve
reached the end of the roll pattern.
If you play 3-2-5-1-4-2-5-1 as your string sequence, play the 3rd string at
the same time as you hear a metronome click, play the 2nd string
between that click and the next, and play the 5th string on the next click.
Congratulations! You’ve successfully played with the metronome. 
5. Now try the same roll pattern, repeating the sequence as many times
as you can without stopping while staying with the metronome beat. 
You want to go from the end right back to the beginning of the roll with-
out missing a beat.
If the metronome is set too fast for you to keep up, gradually adjust it to
a lower number setting until you find a tempo where you can play along.
If the metronome is too slow, increase the speed by moving it to the next
highest number.
After you’re comfortable playing this first roll with the metronome, try
playing other rolls or an easy song that you already know well.
Even the best musicians have trouble following the beat of the metronome.
If this happens to you, don’t worry. Stop playing, find the beat, and start over
again. If you’re still having trouble getting started, listen to the beat of the
metronome and imagine what your roll pattern should sound like against that
beat. After you can hear this in your head, try again.
After you’re able to play an exercise or song effectively all the way through at
one metronome setting, adjust the tempo to the next highest setting and try
it again. This is a great way to gradually increase your speed and accuracy.
You will find that there are some tempo settings where you’ll hit a roadblock
and find it difficult to play what you just played at a slightly slower tempo
(and these roadblocks can be different for each song). Just keep practicing
and you’ll soon be able to move on to the next higher metronome setting.
As you continue to increase speed, the metronome may end up beating so fast
that it becomes a frantic distraction at 140 beats per minute or more. At this
point, it’s a good idea to change the note value that the click equals from two
roll notes to four. Because you’re now going to play four roll notes instead of
two for every metronome click, you need to adjust your metronome accord-
ingly. If you left the metronome setting at the same number as before, you’d
now be playing twice as fast, so go ahead and back the metronome down 30 or
40 beats per minute and try playing once again with the metronome in this
new way. If you try the alternating thumb roll again, this time you will play four
notes for every metronome click instead of two.
240
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Because of the banjo’s robust volume, you may have trouble hearing the beat
of your metronome above the beautiful sounds of your own playing. If you’re
thinking about purchasing an electronic metronome, make sure it has a head-
phone jack. You can then use an external set of headphones to more easily
hear the beat. Better yet, try hooking up a set of external speakers like you’d
find on your computer to your metronome’s jack. This way, you get as much
sound as you need.
Do you practice near a computer? If so, try using a metronome or drum
machine application that can be downloaded for free off the Internet (type
the words metronome or drum machine into an Internet search engine and see
what turns up). Most of these programs have just a small learning curve and
work about as well as a stand-alone metronome.
Your computer and the banjo
In addition to metronome and drum machine applications (see preceding sec-
tion), a host of other computer programs and Web sites can enhance your
banjo-playing experience. I go into more detail about how your computer can
be one of your banjo’s best friends in the following sections.
Many valuable banjo resources on the Internet are completely free, including
Web sites with tablature, downloadable MIDI files, and lively discussion
groups (begin your hunt by checking out www.banjohangout.org and
www.bluegrassbanjo.org). 
Slow-downer programs
Perhaps the most useful type of computer aid for banjo playing is one of sev-
eral applications that slow down the tempo of a digital music source without
changing its pitch, called a slow-downer program. These programs make it
easier to play along or to understand a particular piece of music. I use one
of these programs all the time when I really want to dig deep into another
player’s work to get every note and nuance.
Although you can buy a special stand-alone CD player that performs these same
functions, you can save $200 or more by going the computer-application
route. Two of the most popular slow-downer programs, both of which cost
around $50, are Transkriber, available at most music stores, and the Amazing
Slow Downer (shown in Figure 10-11), which is available for purchase only via
download at www.ronimusic.com. You can also find no-cost options out
there as well. Windows Media Player has a slow-downer feature already built
into its interface, and several Macintosh freeware programs also do the trick.
However, getting a dedicated program with special looping and mixing fea-
tures that can isolate the specific licks you want to learn is worth the cost.
241
Chapter 10: Getting the Right Stuff: Banjo Gear

After opening a slow-downer application, you put a CD into the computer,
choose the track you want to work with, and then set the tempo (which is
usually expressed as a percentage of normal performance speed). You can also
control the pitch of what you’re listening to and work with various mixing
options to hear the banjo more clearly through your computer’s speakers.
Recording software
Applications such as Apple’s GarageBand and Audacity allow you to record
directly into the computer (so you can hear how good you really sound), and
programs such as Band in a Box (for both Macs and PCs) provide you with a
digital bluegrass band accompaniment. GarageBand is for Macs only while
Audacity is available as a free Internet download for either Macs or PCs. 
Band in a Box is available at most music stores, with prices ranging from
$100 to $300 depending upon the quality and variety of instrumental sounds
you want to add to your accompaniment.
YouTube
Just about everyone by now has seen a talking dog video or two from www.
youtube.com. You can also find numerous banjo-related videos at this site, but
if you want to avoid watching Harry, the amateur banjo player from northern
Minnesota struggling through “Cripple Creek” in his pajamas, be sure to begin
your YouTube search by using a particular artist’s name. You may still run into
some annoying dead ends, but you can also find video jewels from great players

such as Pete Seeger, Don Reno, Earl Scruggs, Bill Monroe, and others dating
as far back as the 1950s to as current as last weekend’s festival appearance.
Swapping Out Parts to Make 
Your Banjo Sound Better
Because the banjo is put together with nuts, bolts, and screws, exchanging
parts on a banjo is easier than on a guitar or mandolin. Not a month goes by
without someone bringing to market a new custom part of some kind adver-
tised to give your banjo that extra edge. Although you can replace just about
everything on a banjo, you can discover in this section a few of the easiest
parts to swap out that can still improve the sound of your instrument. 
Don’t forget to refer back to Chapter 1 if you run across a banjo part you’re
unsure of in the following sections.
Bridges
A bridge is a small investment for something that can make a significant 
difference in the sound of your instrument. The bridge is a piece of wood
(usually with three contact points, called feet) that sits on top of the head
and transmits the vibrations from the strings that rest on top of it to the head
and the rest of the banjo. The tension of the strings is all that keeps the
bridge pressed against the head; glue isn’t necessary. To replace the bridge,
you can loosen the strings, pull out the old bridge, and install a new one
(in Chapter 11, I discuss how to properly place the bridge; several different
kinds of bridges are shown in Figure 10-12).
A banjo bridge is conventionally made from hard maple with a strip of ebony
glued to the top. These days, builders also offer bridges made from birch,
teak, koa, rosewood, and other exotic woods. Bluegrass players especially
value bridges made from old growth or submerged wood. Various kinds and
densities of wood transmit the vibrations of the strings in different ways and
trying a new bridge is one way to noticeably alter the sound of your banjo.
Generally speaking, a bridge made from a dense wood that’s lighter in weight
will make any banjo sound brighter (but possibly more shrill), while a heavier
and less-dense bridge will add bass (but perhaps take away some clarity).
Banjo players love to experiment with different kinds and sizes of bridges to
find just the right balance of weight and density for their instrument (and
then argue about what works best!).
243
Chapter 10: Getting the Right Stuff: Banjo Gear

Replacement bridges come in a variety of heights, ranging from 5⁄8 " to 11⁄16 " or
taller. Go with the same height as the bridge that’s currently on your banjo
unless you’re interested in experimenting with slightly higher or lower string
action (string action refers to the distance that the strings are above the banjo
neck and is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 9). 
You need to seek out an acoustic retail outlet for the largest selection of
custom bridges. Look for prices that range from $15 to $35 from custom
builders such as David Wadsworth, Silvio Ferretti (Scorpion), Gary Sosobee,
Snuffy Smith, and Rick Sampson, among others. 
Heads
Spotting the banjo head is easy: Look for the round, light-colored membrane
that’s stretched tightly over the banjo pot and acts as the main vibrating sur-
face of the instrument. Because the primary resonating surface is a membrane
rather than a piece of wood like on a guitar or mandolin, the head is largely
responsible for the beautiful, mind-boggling, piercing tone that says banjo!
Every now and then, a head breaks and needs to be replaced. But players
also choose to install a particular kind of head in order to get a different
sound from their banjo.
Heads were made of animal hide up until the early 1960s when the plastics
revolution took over the banjo world in the form of Mylar heads, which
proved much more resistant to humidity change and to breakage. Most play-
ers now use plastic heads, and that’s what comes on most new instruments.
However, you can still go retro and get a calf or goatskin head for that “organic”
sound. The vintage sound associated with these skin heads is still preferred
today by many open-back banjo players and some bluegrass players.
Figure 10-12:

iment with

tone.
244
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Heads come in varying thicknesses and also have different kinds of spray
coatings on their surfaces. Thicker plastic and heavier coatings impart a mel-
lower tone, but skin heads usually give the deepest tone quality of all. Heads
with little to no coating make your banjo sound brighter, and if you decide to
go this route, you can also choose a clear head or a cool color. Although most
synthetic banjo heads set you back from $15 to $30, be prepared to spend
$40 to $50 for a skin head.
Banjo heads come in all kinds of diameters to accommodate the various sizes
of banjo pots. If you’re in the market for a new banjo head, be sure you pur-
chase one that’s the same size as the one you’re replacing. Especially if you
have an open-back banjo, you should take your banjo with you to the music
store and ask for assistance to make the correct purchase.
Tailpieces
The tailpiece holds the strings to the banjo and is attached to the pot at the
opposite end from where the neck is joined. Most bluegrass banjos have
adjustable tailpieces that control the tension and angle of the strings as they
meet the bridge. Changes in tailpiece height and angle can subtly affect tone
and volume.
If a player desires a clearer sound from a banjo, that will often call for an
adjustment of the tailpiece down towards the banjo head (this puts more
pressure on the bridge and eliminates some overtones, the frequencies that
are present above the basic pitch that color the banjo tone). If a musician
wants a more open or full sound, the tailpiece will be adjusted up and away
from the banjo head (allowing for more overtones).
Three types of tailpieces (shown in Figure 10-13) include the following:
 Presto-style: Presto is the name of the company that supplied the tail-
pieces found on many older bluegrass banjos and for this reason is
still preferred by some players (the power of tradition is strong!).
These tailpieces are lightweight but can be adjusted only up or down
in relation to the banjo head.
 Straight-line: Most straight-line tailpieces have adjustment screws that
allow for a greater variety of positions in relation to the head. Note how
the strings travel in a straight line out from the tailpiece to the bridge
(hence the name). Some players feel that the “straight line” of the strings
enhances the instrument’s tone by putting a more uniform string pres-
sure on the bridge.
245
Chapter 10: Getting the Right Stuff: Banjo Gear

 No knot: These tailpieces are lightweight and small, and are the prefer-
ence of many clawhammer players. Unlike the other two kinds of tail-
pieces, the no knot tailpiece accepts both loop- and ball-end strings. Like
the Presto-style tailpiece, this tailpiece can be adjusted up or down in
relation to the banjo head.
Players sometimes swap out a tailpiece on a banjo for the same reasons they
may try a new head or bridge: They’re looking for that very small, extra edge to
their instrument’s sound. Prices for a new tailpiece can range from $20 to $80.
“D” tuners
If you’ve ever heard a banjo instrumental that features the swooping sound
of a string being detuned and then magically retuned up to its exact pitch,
you’ve heard the effects of “D” tuners (they are called “D” tuners because
they can quickly and easily get the banjo into a D-major tuning from G major
if they are set properly). These special kinds of tuners are usually used on
just the 2nd and 3rd strings by bluegrass players. Two types of “D” tuners
include (both are shown in Figure 10-14): 
 A cam-type design that attaches to the peghead. The cam-type tuner
applies pressure to the strings at the top of the peghead, with the pitch
of the string changed by adjusting levers that are positioned on each
side of the peghead that push and pull on each string. One advantage to
the cam-type tuner is that both strings’ pitches can be changed at the
same time with this design and the tuners even be used when fretting.

Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

 An internally geared design, developed in part by banjo innovator Bill
Keith, uses two screws on the tuner shaft itself to set high and low
stops. With this type of tuner, the pitch is changed through a movement
of the tuning peg shaft rather than being pushed or pulled above the
peghead. When it’s adjusted correctly, the tuner stops when it reaches
the desired pitch. The Keith tuners are an especially good investment
because they function as excellent regular tuners and can be easily
moved from one banjo to another.
These tuners can be an expensive addition to your collection of accessories
at $170 to $250 per pair, but they’re ultimately the only satisfying way to play
such instrumentals as “Flint Hill Special” and “Earl’s Breakdown,” tunes
which feature the sound of the banjo’s strings being raised and lowered in
precise ways.

anjos are the mechanical wonders of the acoustic-instrument world. To
the uninitiated, a banjo appears as a complex and intimidating hybrid of
wood and metal with a bit of plastic (that would be the banjo head and your
tuning peg’s buttons, by the way). However, for those of you who know your
way around a banjo, the instrument offers endless potential for adjustment
and tinkering. Of course, knowing what you’re doing before you start going
crazy with a wrench and wire cutters is always good!
Part of being a good banjo player is knowing how to keep your instrument in
top shape. In this chapter, I start you down the road to becoming a banjo-
adjustment expert by introducing several basic things you can do now to
keep your banjo sounding its best. You discover how to take off your old
strings and put on new ones, how to properly set the bridge so that all the
fretted notes stay in tune, and how to adjust head tension. You also figure out
how to keep your banjo looking its best, and I discuss when you need to seek
professional advice on repairs and maintenance.

The type, quality, and workmanship of the main components of your banjo —
the wooden rim, the metal tone ring (if you have one), and the neck — 
determine the basic sound of your banjo. However, that basic sound can be
altered in ways that you can easily hear by using different kinds of strings
or by making adjustments to such components as the bridge and head (or
replacing them entirely with different parts; see Chapter 10). The art of banjo
adjustment, which consists of matching the playability and sound of the
instrument to the preferences of an individual player, is called setup.
Replacing Banjo Strings
Like checking the oil in your car, shining your shoes, or balancing your check-
book, changing your old banjo strings for new ones is one of those slightly
annoying tasks that’s always possible to put off for another day. Although you
don’t do any damage to your banjo by continuing to play with worn-out
strings, you’ll feel much better about your banjo and your playing after
you’ve installed a slick, shiny set of new strings. Your instrument will sound
great and be easier to play, and you may be inspired to practice even harder.
If you’ve never changed strings on an instrument before, replacing the strings
for the first time should take you no more than 30 to 40 minutes if you follow
the instructions in this section. After you’ve gotten the hang of it, you should
soon be able to change all your strings in 15 minutes or less. The only tools
you need to have on hand are a pencil and a wire cutter. A couple of handy
tricks makes string changing a much less onerous task. I cover everything
you need to do in the next sections.
Deciding when your strings 
need a changin’
Some banjo players are able to play on the same set of strings for months at
a time, but other players change strings as frequently as once a week. Body
chemistry and climate have a lot to do with how fast strings wear out. In either
case, the stickier and dirtier the immediate environment for your banjo, the
quicker your strings collect dust and grime — and the more frequently you
should change them.
Because a set of strings costs about as much as a latte these days, claiming
poverty probably isn’t a good reason for not keeping them fresh and new.
However, if you live in a moderately humid climate, you keep your hands rela-
tively clean when you play, and you wipe your strings down with a soft rag at
250
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

the end of each practice session, your strings should last for a good, long time.
Here are a few telltale signs that you need to think about making a change:
 The banjo becomes more difficult to tune; the strings especially sound
out of tune when fretted up the neck.
 The strings feel rough to the touch, and you can see signs of grit, grime,
and corrosion.
 A string breaks! You definitely need to replace the broken string. If you
haven’t changed strings for a while, go ahead and change all of them.
(By the way, if the same string breaks consistently you could have a
problem with your nut or bridge, in which case you should consult your
local acoustic music store repairperson.)
Make sure you’ve figured out whether your banjo is designed to take loop- or
ball-end strings (the great majority of banjos use loop-end strings). Take a
moment to read up on this topic in the section on strings in Chapter 10 so
you can make an informed string purchase. After you’re at the store, go
ahead and buy more than one set so you have plenty of extra strings on hand
(stores often offer a discount on multiple sets too, so don’t be afraid to ask!).
Changing strings 1 through 4: 
A step-by-step guide
Some folks like to place the banjo on a table to change strings, while others
simply hold the banjo in a normal playing position. Either way, the process of
replacing old strings with new is the same.
The bridge isn’t glued to the head. It stays attached to the banjo with the ten-
sion of the strings. If you were to remove all the strings at one time, the
bridge would come off, and you would have to reposition it while installing
your new strings. For this reason, I recommend changing just one string at a
time. It doesn’t really matter in what order you change strings, as long as you
can remember which ones you’ve changed and which ones you haven’t after
you’ve started.
In the following sections, I give you the steps to change your 1st string.
Follow the same steps to change the other strings on your banjo — with one
important exception. The 3rd- and 4th-string tuners rotate clockwise to raise
the pitch of a string and counterclockwise to lower it. This direction is opposite
from how the 1st- and 2nd-string tuners raise and lower strings. Remember
that all four strings are threaded so that they wrap around each tuning post
from the center of the peghead.

Chapter 11: Taking Care of Your Baby: String Changing & Basic Maintenance

Step 1: Meeting your new strings
Your new strings most likely come packaged in a plastic pouch. Inside this
pouch, you find each string stored in a separate paper envelope. The five
envelopes are labeled either with the numbers 1 through 5 indicating which
string is which (1st for 1st string, and so on), or they have numbers indicat-
ing the width of the string, measured in thousandths of an inch (0.010, 0.0121⁄2,
for example). If this is the case, the outside packaging indicates which width
goes with which string. The width of the 1st and 5th strings should be the
same and are the smallest numbered strings in your set. The 2nd, 3rd, and
4th strings are consecutively larger.
Step 2: Removing the old string
Before you can put a new string on, you have to remove the old one. This
step isn’t rocket science. Begin by changing the 1st string. Simply turn the 1st
string peg counterclockwise until the string is completely slack. Carefully pull
the string through the hole in the tuning peg at the headstock to free it from
that end of the banjo. Then take a moment to observe how the string is
threaded through the tailpiece at the pot end of the banjo before removing it.
You retrace these steps when you attach the new string.
Step 3: Attaching the string to the tailpiece
Before you unravel the new string and install it on your banjo, take a sharp-
ened pencil and gently rub its point back and forth a few times in the grooves
of both the bridge and the nut, blowing off the excess. The graphite provides
lubrication for the string at these two points of contact, which makes keeping
the string in tune easier. You can also use the pencil to widen the loop end of
the string to secure it to the banjo more easily (both of these steps are shown
in Figure 11-1).
You always want to attach the loop end of the string first onto the banjo’s 
tailpiece (the claw-shaped object attached to the edge of the head that holds
the strings at the opposite end of the banjo from the tuning pegs). Most tail-
pieces have five finger-like hooks or knobs that are designed to hold this end
of the string. Tailpieces on bluegrass banjos often have covers, in which case
you need to lift that up to find the attachments. Take note of how the old
string is fastened to the tailpiece and install your new string in the same way.
Figure 11-2 shows the string fit on two kinds of tailpieces typically found on
open-back and bluegrass banjos.
Most bluegrass banjo tailpieces are designed so that the string comes out
from under the front edge of the tailpiece. Check to see that you’ve threaded
the string so that it emerges from the tailpiece in the same way.

Chapter 11: Taking Care of Your Baby: String Changing & Basic Maintenance

Step 4: Fastening the string to the tuning post
Now you must attach the other end of the 1st string to the tuning peg’s post.
Note that the post has a small hole in it. Thread the end of the string through
this hole from the center of the peghead, pushing the string out through the
hole towards the peghead’s outer edge. Then pull the string through the hole
so that you have just a bit of slack in the string along its entire length —
enough for you to wrap around the tuning shaft no more than three or four
times. See Figure 11-3 to see how this process looks.
Make sure that the string is seated in the proper 1st-string notch in the
bridge. The loop end of the string may occasionally slip out from the tail-
piece, so use this time to check that the string is still secure at that end of
the banjo.
Step 5: Winding the string around the tuning post
Things get a little tricky with the next two steps. While holding the string
with the right hand, use your left hand to create a crease in the excess string
pointing towards the center of the headstock (see Figure 11-4). This kink 
prevents the string from moving back through the post when you begin to
tighten it.

Now tighten the 1st string around the post by turning the peg in a clockwise
direction. Try feeding the string through your right-hand thumb and index
finger. As you continue to turn the peg with your left hand, guide the string so
that it wraps in downward circles around the post, towards the direction of
the headstock (see Figure 11-5).
Step 6: Securing the string to the tuning post
Remember the crease you put in the string in Step 5? Most of the time, this
crease prevents the string from slipping back through the hole in the tuner.
However, many players also pin the excess string against the tuning post to
insure that the string won’t slip back through the hole.

255
Chapter 11: Taking Care of Your Baby: String Changing & Basic Maintenance

Here’s how to do this: Wrap the excess part of the string back around the
post towards the center of the headstock and bring it underneath the string
just in front of the tuning post. Now pull the excess string up and wedge it
between the string and post. As you continue to tighten the string with the
tuner, the excess string will be pinned against the post, preventing it from
slipping out of the hole (both steps are show in Figure 11-6).
Step 7: Bringing the string up to pitch
You’re almost finished! Continue to turn the peg clockwise to tune the 1st
string up to a D note, making sure that the string is sitting in the 1st-string nut
slot. Use your electronic tuner to tune the 1st string or use the 2nd string fret-
ted at the third fret as a reference pitch. (For more instructions on tuning, see
Chapter 2.)
Trim the excess string as close to the tuning post as you can by using your
wire cutters, and you’re done!

Replacing the 5th string
Most banjos have a geared 5th-string tuning peg, meaning that the tuner has
internal gearing to assist in more accurate tuning, like your other tuners.
With this kind of peg, the tuning post emerges from the side of the peg, making
the string installation process a bit different. Here’s a step-by-step guide:
1. Remove the old 5th string, observing carefully how it is wrapped
around the tuning post and attached to the tailpiece.
2. Turn the tuning peg so that the hole in the tuning post is parallel to
the direction of the other four banjo strings.
3. Secure the new 5th string at the tailpiece and thread the string
through the hole in the tuning post, leaving just a bit of slack.
Check to see that the string is seated in the bridge notch for the 5th string.
4. Turn the peg counterclockwise.
This step also causes the post to move counterclockwise as the string
begins to wrap around the tuning post.
5. Crease the excess part of the string in a clockwise direction and move
it around the back of the tuning post and underneath the string to pin
it against the post.
Doing this after the string has wrapped around the peg with one full rev-
olution may be easier.
6. Because the 5th string has its own nut or a small spike to guide it to
the peg, make sure that as the string tightens, the string is seated in
the 5th-string nut.
7. Tune the string up to pitch (G for G tuning), and trim the excess string
with a wire cutter.
And you’re done! If you need some help tuning your 5th string, you can
use an electronic tuner or check out the tuning instructions in Chapter 2.
A few inexpensive banjos have 5th-string tuners without gears. The big differ-
ence between geared and non-geared tuners is that the string’s pitch goes up
and down much more dramatically with only a slight movement from a tuner
without gears. The process of changing the 5th string with a non-geared peg
is the same as the steps I outline in this section, except that this time around,
you wrap the string counterclockwise around a vertical tuning post (see
Chapter 9 for more on geared and friction 5th-string tuning pegs).
257
Chapter 11: Taking Care of Your Baby: String Changing & Basic Maintenance

Setting the Bridge
Unlike a guitar, the bridge on a banjo is movable. However, the bridge needs
to be positioned on just one spot on the banjo head so that your strings
sound in tune when fretted up and down the neck.
Even though the tension of the strings usually keeps the bridge firmly in
place, over time the bridge may drift from its original position or may even
fall over if bumped the wrong way (this scenario is typically a moment of
high drama accompanied by a loud cracking sound, but usually no perma-
nent damage is done). You may also decide to try different kinds of bridges
on your banjo to see how they affect the sound (for more on this, see
Chapter 10).
For these reasons, you need to know how to properly set the bridge. For this
procedure, you don’t need three hands — just your two ears and the help of
an electronic tuner, if you have one. Finding the correct bridge placement
involves playing harmonics and comparing the sound of these notes to
the sound of a fretted string, which I explain how to do in the following 
sections.
When in doubt about bridge placement, consult your friends at your local
acoustic music store. They should be more than glad to set the bridge as well
as get you on the road to making this adjustment yourself without the stress
and hassle.
Discovering harmonics
Harmonics (or chimes) are one of the natural physical byproducts of a vibrat-
ing string. When you pick a string, it vibrates not only along its entire length,
but also in fractional sections of 1⁄2, 1⁄3, 1⁄4, and so on. These additional, shorter-
length vibrations add color and tone to the sound of the string.
If you very lightly touch a string directly above a fret at one of the points
where the string length can be evenly divided and play that string, you hear
the bell-like sound of a harmonic. Harmonics are a central feature of such
bluegrass favorites as Bugle Call Rag and Earl Scruggs’s Foggy Mountain
Chimes. For the 4th to the 1st strings on your banjo, harmonics are found
directly above the 5th, 7th, 12th, and 19th frets. Because the 5th string is a
different length than your other banjo strings, its harmonics are found at the
10th, 12th, and 17th frets.
258
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

It can take some practice (and some time) to get your banjo harmonics
sounding good. The key is to find the exact location over the appropriate fret
with the left hand and to use the lightest touch possible. Move the finger ever
slightly back and forth along the string to find the exact spot that allows the
string to ring at its best.
Using harmonics to set the bridge
After you have a feel for how to play harmonics (see preceding section for
tips), you can use them to help you set your bridge. Try playing the harmonic
that’s found at the 12th fret of the 1st string (see Figure 11-7). Remember that
creating a harmonic takes a very light touch and that your left-hand finger has
to be positioned directly over the fret instead of behind it as you would when
normally fretting a note. After you’re able to sound the harmonic (you’ll know
it when you do), you can enhance the bell-like effect by raising your left-hand
finger off the string just after you strike it with the right hand.
Compare the pitch of the 12th-fret harmonic to the pitch of the string when
fretted at the 12th fret. If your bridge is placed correctly, these two notes
should sound the same. However, if you can hear a difference in pitch, you
need to reposition the bridge in the following ways:
 If the fretted note sounds higher than the harmonic, move the bridge
away from the neck, towards the tailpiece.
 If the fretted note sounds lower than the harmonic, move the bridge
towards the neck, away from the tailpiece.
Figure 11-7:
The 12th-fret
harmonic on
the 1st
string.
259
Chapter 11: Taking Care of Your Baby: String Changing & Basic Maintenance

Usually only very small movements — fractions of an inch — are required to
find the right position for the bridge. Grab one end of the bridge with each
hand and firmly but gently push it just a bit along the head in the proper
direction to get the string in tune.
After moving the bridge, you need to retune the banjo and try this procedure
again. Getting the bridge in the best position may take several tries to get
the harmonic in precise tune with the fretted note (your tuner can help
you here). 
After you’ve matched the pitches for the 1st string, try the same exercise on
the 4th string. The 4th-string side of the bridge may need to be positioned
slightly closer to the tailpiece in order to match the pitch of the harmonic to
the fretted note.
Adjusting Head Tension
Tweaking the tightness of the banjo head is another basic skill that makes a
difference in the tone and volume of your instrument. The head is the drum-
like skin that’s stretched across the top of your banjo’s round pot (to read
more on banjo heads, visit Chapter 10). When you play a note, the energy
from the moving string is transferred through the bridge to the surface of
the head, which amplifies and colors the sound of the string across its entire
surface. The tightness of the head affects how bright and loud your banjo
sounds and can also contribute to the playability of your instrument along
with its ability to stay in tune.
In the following sections, I discuss the relationship between the tightness of
your head and your instrument’s tone and show you how to make adjust-
ments to the head to bring out the best from your banjo.
Relating head tension to banjo tone
In general, the looser your banjo head is, the mellower your banjo sounds.
A looser heads adds more low (or bass) tones to the banjo and somewhat
reduces the volume of the instrument. Conversely, the tighter the banjo head,
the brighter and louder the instrument is. Although adjustments or changes
in bridges and tailpieces can also affect the tone of your banjo in similar
ways, changing head tension is the best — and easiest — thing you can do to
brighten the sound of your banjo (or take a bit of the edge off in order to stop
attracting the pets in your neighborhood).
260
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

The philosophy of banjo setup is usually to find a middle ground within a
range of adjustment to bring out the best tonal qualities of a particular instru-
ment. In regard to banjo heads, when you hear players talk about loose or
tight heads, they’re usually splitting hairs and talking about small adjust-
ments in head tension. If the head is really loose, keeping the banjo in tune
would be next to impossible and its tone would be very muddy. If the head is
really tight, the banjo would sound like a tin can, or the tension may even
cause the head to break. Although beauty is in the ear of the beholder, most
players feel that a banjo responds best and has the best tone when the head
is “medium tight.” When pushing against the head with your thumb close to
the bridge, a medium-tight head should offer a good deal of resistance
against your thumb but should depress slightly against this pressure.
Tightening the head
A new head, whether on a brand-new banjo or as a replacement head on an old
instrument, stretches and needs some retightening once or twice in the first
couple of weeks of use. For this reason, bringing a new banjo home from a music
store with a loose head isn’t unusual. After the first weeks of using your banjo,
the head should remain stable and only need a slight adjustment once every
three to four months or when temperature and humidity significantly change.
The head is stretched tightly across the top of the banjo by the tension hoop,
and everything is held in place by the brackets that ring around the pot.
Banjos vary in the number of brackets that they have. Most bluegrass banjos
have 24 brackets, but minstrel banjos have far fewer brackets and some
open-back instruments have even more. Figure 11-8 shows the side view of a
bluegrass banjo pot as it appears when looking down on it while playing.

Chapter 11: Taking Care of Your Baby: String Changing & Basic Maintenance

To check to see whether your banjo’s head is loose, try pushing against the
head near the bridge with your thumb. Does the head bend under this pres-
sure and cause the bridge to sink with it? If so, you need to try tightening it
by using the instructions in the following sections.
Using your banjo bracket wrench
Your banjo likely came with a bracket wrench tucked in the pocket of your
case. Banjo bracket wrenches are sized to fit securely over the ends of the
bracket nuts, which are the nuts that are attached to the long, slender metal
rods (called brackets) that hold the banjo head tightly to the pot (see Figure
11-9). Make sure you use the right size wrench for this adjustment. In a pinch,
an adjustable conventional wrench works for quick fixes, but this type of
wrench can be difficult to work with in the close quarters of the banjo pot —
and inadvertently cause you to strip out the bracket nuts. Consult your local
acoustic music store or acoustic Internet retailer to find a wrench that’s
designed for your banjo. They usually cost around $5.
If you have a resonator on your banjo, you need to remove it to find the bracket
nuts. Most resonators are attached to the pot with three or four screws that
are easily visible and can be unscrewed by hand. Some entry-level banjos use
small Philips head screws to hold the resonator. In this case, you’ll need to
dig through your garage tool kit for a screwdriver that will provide a proper fit.
After the resonator is off your banjo, use your banjo bracket wrench to
tighten the head by turning the nuts clockwise, and loosen the head by turn-
ing in a counterclockwise motion. For more specific instructions on how
tightly or loosely to adjust your banjo head, you can “head” to the next 
section.
Making small adjustments
The key to having a well-adjusted and happy head is to make gradual adjust-
ments and to keep the pressure as uniform as possible around the tension
hoop. Here’s a step-by-step guide to tightening the head:
1. Before you go to work with the banjo wrench, make sure that each
bracket is finger tight.
Having one or two brackets work themselves completely loose isn’t
unusual if the head hasn’t been adjusted for some time or at least since
the banjo was in the showroom. Feel each bracket with your fingers,
tightening each one as needed by hand, before tightening with a wrench.
262
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

2. After the brackets are finger tight, fit the banjo wrench onto the end
of the bracket that’s closest to the neck of the instrument and tighten
no more than 1⁄4" of a turn or until the wrench meets some additional
resistance; tighten the other brackets in the same way.
Monitor the resistance you feel in the banjo wrench as you tighten each
nut and try to match the tightness of the other brackets as you move
around the pot.
Some players tighten opposite brackets when installing a new head,
moving consecutively to the bracket that’s 180 degrees across the rim
near the banjo tailpiece and proceeding around the circle in this way. If
you’re doing only a slight adjustment to the head, you don’t need to do
this. Just move to the adjacent bracket and go around the circle.

263
Chapter 11: Taking Care of Your Baby: String Changing & Basic Maintenance

After moving around the banjo pot to uniformly tighten all the brackets, take
a moment to retune your instrument and try playing a few chords or tunes.
As you tighten the head, you should hear a brighter and clearer tone and
more volume, but if the head gets too tight, the sound of the banjo becomes
thin and wiry. If your head was very loose to begin with, the bridge should
rise in response to the tighter head, causing the string action to become higher
(in this case, your banjo is likely closer to factory specifications).
Maintaining uniform tension is key to having a good banjo sound, whether
your preference is for a mellow or a bright tone. Take a moment to visually
inspect the tension hoop; it should appear level around the pot and parallel
to the tone ring and the top of the rim. If the tension hoop has one side pulled
lower than the other at any point around the circle, the hoop is providing
uneven pressure to the head. In this situation, loosen the head to even the
pressure and begin the tightening process again.
Keeping Your Banjo Looking Its Best
Keeping your banjo looking sharp should be a part of your regular maintenance
routine. Banjo players tend to go off the deep end in everything that they do
related to the instrument, including cleaning. I try to practice moderation in
this aspect of banjo maintenance. With a brand-new banjo, I try to keep it clean
and shiny for a while, but sooner or later, especially after the first weekend
festival of the summer, the plating inevitably begins to show signs of wear.
At that point, I resort to spot cleaning the banjo every now and then when
the mood strikes me, leaving a complete and thorough polishing of the metal
parts for those times (maybe once every couple of years) when I have the
banjo disassembled (to install a new head, for instance).
If you keep up with regular cleaning rituals, your instrument will be easier to
play, you’ll have to change strings less often, and you’ll preserve the wood
finish and metal plating longer. So be sure to follow these few simple mainte-
nance guidelines:
 Rub the strings down with a cloth after each playing session to dra-
matically increase the life of your strings. A cloth diaper or flannel rag
is just right for this job.
 After cleaning off the strings, gently rub the back of the neck with the
cloth to remove smudges and hand oil from the neck. Keeping the
wooden surfaces of your banjo free from dirt and hand oil preserves the
finish and keeps your banjo shining for years to come.
264
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

 Take a moment to wipe off fingerprints, smudges, and whatever else
may have accumulated on the metal plating of your banjo. If your
banjo has nickel plating (which is silver in appearance), that cloth
diaper or soft rag can once again work wonders.
Even the softest rags can scratch fancy gold plating. For gold, try an eye-
glass cleaning cloth and spray. Together, they remove smudges without
scratching the delicate plating.
 Wipe off your armrest with a soft cloth to remove any sweat or other
grime and dirt. The plating on your armrest is especially susceptible to
tarnishing. Sooner or later, you’ll likely just give up and let the power of
biochemistry take its course, but some extra attention with the cloth
keeps nature at bay for a while.
Wearing a wristband on your right arm while playing is an even better
solution if you want to keep your banjo in like-new condition for as long
as possible. You may look a little silly, but you’ll have the cleanest arm-
rest in town!
 Every month or two, use a guitar polish to bring luster back to the
wood finish on the resonator and neck. Most high-quality polishes are
applied by using a damp soft cloth and are buffed using a clean and dry
soft cloth. If your banjo has a resonator, take it off the banjo to make pol-
ishing it easier.
When cleaning plated parts, use the softest cloth you can find and don’t
apply too much pressure when cleaning. The idea here is to gently remove
stains from the surface of the plating, not to rub off the plating itself! Some
folks recommend using silver polish every now and then on nickel- or
chrome-plated parts (never use silver polish on gold plating!). I stopped
doing this kind of housekeeping on my banjo some years ago when I realized
that what was left on my polish cloth used to be the plating that was on my
banjo! Although metal polishes such as Simichrome Polish can make the
metal parts of your banjo shine like nothing else can, keep in mind that metal 
polishes are actually removing your plating in very small increments to
create that shine. Metal polishes are best for very occasional use (once or
twice a year).
Sooner or later, I always forget to move my belt buckle to the side, and I put a
few scratches into the back of the resonator. No big deal! Your banjo is meant
to be played and a scratch here and there or some tarnished plating isn’t
going to hurt your instrument or make it sound worse. The point is to have
fun playing and not spend too much time worrying about keeping your banjo
in showroom condition.

Chapter 11: Taking Care of Your Baby: String Changing & Basic Maintenance

Knowing When to Consult a Professional
You may have gotten the impression from the discussion in the preceding
section that a banjo is a delicate flower of an instrument, susceptible to
damage by just breathing the wrong way on it. Of course, nothing could be
further from the truth. Banjos are hardy creatures, and if you have a well-
made instrument, it should provide years of enjoyment with no significant
repairs of any kind needed.
However, you may have occasions when consulting a repairperson for help
on things that you shouldn’t try to fix yourself is your best option. These
problems include the following:
 Cracks in any part of the wood or metal — anywhere on your banjo,
inside or out.
 Severely twisted or bowed neck.
 Worn frets. Over time, the frets develop gouges where they come into
contact with the strings. A repairperson will first even out the frets
(this is called dressing the frets). This gives them a couple of years of
additional use, at which point you will want to replace your old frets
with new ones (called refretting).
 Broken head. After you’ve been playing a while, you’ll learn how to
install a new head yourself. For now, leave this task to your trusted
repairperson.
 Tuner, tailpiece, or nut problems. With more experience, you can fix
some of the problems that arise from these parts. For now however, con-
sult a repairperson before replacing or working on any of these parts
yourself.

P
laying the banjo isn’t intended to be a solitary experience. Although you
may feel that you’re the only person in town who has ever even heard of
a banjo (much less like one), I can assure you that hundreds of thousands of
other people who share your passion for the instrument are out there. I know
this may be hard to believe, but these folks are just as nuts as you are about
everything to do with the banjo.
This worldwide community is just waiting for you to find them, and in this
chapter, you can figure out how to connect with other players who can help
you on your banjo journey. I discuss how to find a good teacher, how to
locate other musicians in your area who play your kind of music, and what to
expect at your first jam session. You also discover how workshops, camps,
and festivals can heighten your banjo-playing experience.
Most people become interested in the banjo because they love the sound of
the instrument. Most players stay interested because of the new friendships
and experiences that come from their involvement with the banjo and with
bluegrass and old-time music. Whatever your ability level, becoming a part of
banjo culture is one of the most important things you can do to become a
better player and increase your knowledge of the instrument.

Taking Private Lessons
One-on-one lessons from a skilled teacher are the best way to learn how to
play the banjo. However, if you’ve never studied with a teacher before, recog-
nizing a good instructor from a not-so-good one and gathering up enough
nerve to go in for a lesson can be intimidating. This section unlocks the
process of finding a teacher and getting comfortable with lessons by using a
little psychology and a little detective work.
Overcoming lesson anxiety
The thought of music lessons may dredge up negative experiences you’ve
had with music teachers in the past or other not-so-successful attempts at
learning an instrument (I still remember my childhood piano teacher and her
ruler — ouch!). Or you may feel that you’re too old (or too young) to start
serious study with a teacher. The bottom line is that everyone experiences
fear of failure in their lives. Try your best not to let these kinds of thoughts
limit you from doing everything within your power to find a banjo teacher in
your area and start taking lessons.
Another reason that many folks don’t take lessons is that they think they
aren’t yet good enough to get together with a teacher. They convince them-
selves that they’ll contact a teacher after they’ve taught themselves the next
section in that book or DVD that came with the banjo or after they’ve finally
figured out how to get the banjo in tune!
Stop a minute and examine this way of thinking. Seems illogical, doesn’t it?
However, I’ve met many folks who have talked themselves out of lessons
because they don’t want to waste the teacher’s time. I’ve talked myself out of
everything from tennis lessons to subjecting my dog to obedience training
with this kind of thinking. (Okay, it really would be a waste of the dog trainer’s
time, but that’s a story for another time.)
Most professional teachers love working with students who have no playing
experience. Brand new players don’t have bad habits to unlearn and are often
more fun (and less work) to teach than someone who already plays banjo.
You aren’t going to be wasting a teacher’s time if you don’t know the first
thing about playing. That’s the reason you’re starting lessons! Teachers want
to help you and welcome you just as you are. Also, don’t worry if you’re start-
ing as an adult. Most new banjo players are middle-aged or older. I’ve known
many people who begin to play banjo in their 70s!

Finding just the right teacher
After you make up your mind to take lessons, you have to go about the
process of locating a good teacher. Sound like a headache waiting to happen?
Don’t stress it. With the advice in this section, you can be well on your way to
finding an A+ teacher.
If you’re new to the banjo, my best advice for finding a teacher is to start
close to home. However, if you’ve already played for a few years, you
may have to cast a wider net to find a teacher who can take you to the
next level.
Using local and online resources
Your regional acoustic specialty store is the best place to find out about
banjo teachers in your area. This store may even have an instructor who
teaches in-house. If the store is some distance away, you should still place a
phone call to inquire about teachers closer to home. This kind of store has
contacts over a wide area and can probably connect you with teachers in
your immediate area who the folks at your local all-purpose rock ’n’ roll
music store may not know.
The Internet has also made finding a good teacher easier. Type the key words
banjo teacher (your city and state) or banjo teacher directory into an Internet
search engine and see where it leads you. You may also be able to find a state
or regional bluegrass club or association that sponsors events in your area,
and its members should have the scoop on area instructors. Try conducting
a search using bluegrass association (your state) as key words and see what
comes up.
You can also post to one of several Internet banjo community Web sites to
inquire about teachers in your area. You can get a response within hours!
A few sites with good teacher directories include www.banjohangout.org
and www.angiesbanjo.com.
The first stages of your search for a banjo teacher are going to be the most
difficult. Don’t get discouraged. Depending on where you live, finding some-
one in your area who can help you takes some persistence. One person may
lead you to another who may lead you to then another before you’ve located
the right person to teach you. If over time you have real trouble connecting
with other players, consider attending a banjo camp (I discuss camps later in
this chapter).

Chapter 12: Networking into Banjo Culture

Choosing the right teacher
After you’ve uncovered a couple names of teachers (see preceding section),
you need to decide which one to visit first. Try taking a lesson with each
instructor who seems qualified and sounds interesting. Here are some of the
most important questions to ask your prospective teacher:
 Does the teacher actually play banjo? The answer to this question may
seem like a no-brainer, but many, if not most, “banjo” teachers play
something else — usually the guitar — as their primary instrument.
Although the person who offers lessons in guitar, mandolin, autoharp,
violin, bass, piano, drums, glockenspiel, hurdy gurdy, theremin, and
banjo may actually be a fantastic banjo teacher, approach this kind of
lesson situation with caution. A few pointed questions should quickly
reveal your prospective teacher’s depth of knowledge.
If you’re a total beginner and can’t find anyone else, this kind of teacher
can at least help you to fret chords and get you started with right-hand
technique, which is better than nothing! However, you soon want to
move on to an instructor who really can play banjo.
 Does the teacher play clawhammer or bluegrass? Be sure to ask up
front about this important aspect of teaching. Most teachers feel more
comfortable giving lessons in one approach or the other, but if you find
an instructor who is capable of teaching you both clawhammer and
bluegrass, all the better (if you want to learn both ways of playing)!
 Does the teacher welcome all levels of students? Most dedicated, 
professional-level banjo teachers accept all levels of students. If a
teacher accepts only beginning students, this may indicate that she may
not be a very skilled player. If you’re looking for lessons for a child, be
sure to ask about the teacher’s experience and comfort level with kids.
Also feel free to ask how many banjo students the teacher is currently
teaching. This number gives you a good idea of how serious this person
is about teaching banjo.
 How are lessons put together? Does the teacher instruct everyone in
the same way or are lessons tailored to fit the individual needs of stu-
dents? Does the teacher use tablature, or will you be learning by ear
(either is fine — the quality of teaching in either area is what counts)?
Is the teacher willing to instruct you on accompaniment skills? Does he
have a lesson plan? You want to be sure your prospective teacher is flex-
ible enough to match your learning style, and the answers to these kinds
of questions give you an idea of the instructor’s willingness to shape
lessons to what’s best for you.
 How often, and how much? Weekly lessons, with travel time to and
from your teacher’s studio, can be difficult to work into an adult’s busy
schedule. However, if your lessons are too far apart in time, staying
focused in your practice is difficult. In my experience of teaching hun-
dreds of students over the last 30 years, most adults can make good
progress on the banjo with a one-hour lesson every two to three weeks.
270
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Kids (teenagers and younger) need more structure and a weekly half-
hour lesson is just about perfect for them. Discuss scheduling with your
teacher up front to see what’s going to work out best for both of you.
Lesson prices can range from $25 to $80 or more per hour, depending
on where you live and your individual teacher’s scale. Better teachers
cost more — this truth is the way of the world! However, even if you’re
a beginning-level player, I recommend splurging on at least one or two
lessons from the very best teacher that you can find in your area, regard-
less of price. You can avoid months of frustration if you use this opportu-
nity for an expert player and teacher to fine-tune your overall technique
and help you with your sound at the initial stages of your banjo journey.
Connecting with a great teacher is the easiest way to make quick progress on
the banjo, but you must determine how many lessons you need, the type of
teacher you want, and how long to stay with a teacher. Some players study
with the same teacher for many years, while others are more comfortable set-
ting out on their own after only a few lessons. If your primary goal is to just
get familiar with a few chords to strum along with others, you don’t want or
need many lessons. However, if you’re interested in becoming a real blue-
grass or old-time banjo player, you can expect to work with your teacher for
six months to a year on the basics before spending another year or more on
advanced tunes and techniques. Sound like a long time? It won’t be if you’re
having fun with a good teacher.
Playing Music with Others
One of the greatest pleasures you experience playing banjo is when you make
music with others. These days, connecting with other acoustic musicians is
easier than ever before. Whether you’re a beginner or a more experienced
player, you make faster progress on the banjo if you take the opportunity to
make music with other musicians as often as you can.
The primary way that amateur bluegrass and old-time musicians get together
to make music is via a jam session. At a jam session, musicians at a variety of
different skill levels come together to share tunes. Each musician gets an equal
chance to be featured, but you aren’t expected to know every tune that’s
played. One of the best things about jams is getting to hear and try your hand
at new songs. Most jam sessions provide a welcoming environment for just
about all levels of players (I note some exceptions in the following sections).
Jam sessions are common in other styles of music such as jazz, folk, blues,
and even rock, but they play an especially important role with the kinds of
music you play on the banjo. Bluegrass and old-time music are participatory
art forms, and if you’re a serious fan, you’re more than likely a musician as
well. Jamming is a primary way to become a better banjo player as well as get
connected to your local music scene.
271
Chapter 12: Networking into Banjo Culture

In the following sections, you unlock the secrets of how musicians are able to
miraculously play together in a jam session. You also figure out how to match
a jam session to your ability level and become familiar with how musicians
interact with one another to make the music flow more smoothly. By observing
good jam etiquette, you can be a welcome participant at any musical gather-
ing that needs a banjo!
Finding a good jam
In most urban areas, the amateur acoustic music scene is based around free
weekly jam sessions in music stores, cafes, coffeehouses, churches, and private
homes. Your acoustic specialty store, banjo teacher, local music association,
or the Internet should be able to point you in the direction of the most appro-
priate local sessions for your ability level.
Be sure to investigate slow jams or jam classes in your area. Both are rela-
tively new phenomenon on the acoustic music scene and are ideal ways for
newer players to start making music in a group context. The following
describes what these kinds of jams are all about:
 Slow jams are led by one or two professional teachers and are designed
for brand-new or beginning-level players to get accustomed to playing
with other musicians by following along on bluegrass and old-time stan-
dards played slowly. The instructors lead you in playing simple tunes to
give you a chance to use the capo, play in different time signatures, and
become familiar with many different bluegrass and old-time standards.
Slow jams have no limit in size, and they provide an easy and painless
way to begin developing the techniques you need to play music with
others in real jam sessions.
 Jam classes bring together one or two people on each ensemble instru-
ment (banjo, guitar, fiddle, mandolin, dobro, and bass) to make music in
a way that’s a lot like playing in a real band. With the help of one or two
professional teachers who are at the ready to provide comfort and aid to
the jam afflicted, you work with other players to arrange tunes, work out
vocal harmonies, and divide up the instrumental solos. You have the
first-hand opportunity to experience what works (and what doesn’t)
when playing banjo with others. Jam classes are usually designed for
musicians who have played six months to a year or more and already
have many of the skills they need to get out and play with others.
Both slow jams and jam classes are often structured as weekly classes that
run in eight- to ten-week sessions. In addition, many larger bluegrass festivals
around the country also host slow jams or jam classes as part of their program-
ming. In this case, these classes may take place before the festival actually
begins, so be sure to check schedules (for more on festivals, see the section
“Heading to a Bluegrass Festival” later in this chapter). As a complement to
private lessons, both slow jams and jam classes are great ways to expand
your playing horizons and help you get ready for a real jam.
272
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Getting ready for a jam session
The egalitarian attitude shared by most bluegrass and old-time musicians is
one of the most remarkable aspects about the communal experience of playing
music with others. At a bluegrass festival, you may see professional players
showing a song or lick to a young novice or see people from all walks of life
(and all musical ability levels) joining together in an impromptu jam session
around a festival campfire. The accessibility of the music’s most skilled per-
formers and the willingness of practically all players to share knowledge are
unique to bluegrass and old-time music.
However, you don’t want to just walk up to any jam session, take out your
instrument, and start to play. Before you consider joining a real jam, you
need to have mastered the following skills on the banjo:
 Keeping your banjo in tune. All participants in a jam session must be in
tune with one another for the music to sound pleasing — nothing is less
welcome than an out-of-tune banjo! You need to be able to tune your banjo
by using either an electronic tuner or by getting a reference pitch from a
guitar player. If you’re a beginner, ask for tuning help from others instead
of continuing to play out of tune. (For more on tuning, see Chapter 2.)
 Fretting the G, C, and D or D7 chords and playing along to a simple
chord progression by using basic right-hand techniques. Hundreds of
songs use just these chords. If you’re comfortable fretting these chords
and moving from one to another, you’re well on your way to being able
to play along with many tunes.
In slow jams, an instructor calls out the chords, but in a regular jam ses-
sion, you’re expected to figure out the chord progression as you play.
This may seem like an impossibly difficult skill to master, but as you
become familiar with more songs, you’ll start to hear how one piece is
similar to another. You’ll soon be able to quickly figure out new chord
progressions by using your ear. Asking other musicians for assistance is
fine if you’re having trouble figuring out any chord progression (for more
on fretting, chords, and chord progressions, see Chapters 2 and 3).
 Maintaining good rhythm as you play. Rhythm is the most important
organizing factor in making music with others because all the musicians
participating in a jam session need to play a song at the same tempo. If
they didn’t do this, everyone would quickly be at a different place in the
same song and that would really sound interesting!
Banjo players have the unfortunate reputation for wanting to play faster
than everyone else. The secret to playing in good rhythm with others is
to calm down, take a deep breath, and listen to what other musicians are
playing, and then you can adjust your own playing to match what you
hear other musicians doing. If you stop playing, everyone else is going
to keep going! Figuring out how to play in good rhythm is a lifelong
process, but finding and staying in the groove with others is one of the
most fun parts of making music. (For more on rhythm, see Chapter 3.)
273
Chapter 12: Networking into Banjo Culture

In reality, this list is just the bare minimum set of skills you need to keep your
head above water in a real jam session. You should also know a wide variety
of chords both in first position and up the neck and be comfortable with
accompaniment techniques such as vamping (a bluegrass banjo rhythm tech-
nique that uses up-the-neck chords and allows you to play on faster songs).
In addition, you should know how to use the capo and be able to play songs
in the keys of C and D.
Keep in mind that a jam session isn’t a private banjo lesson. Although other
players or the jam leader are usually willing to help you with some aspects of
a song, such as showing you a new chord or assisting you with the capo,
you’re essentially on your own after a tune begins. Unless the jam is specifi-
cally advertised as a slow jam (see preceding section), musicians play tunes
up to speed and won’t slow down or stop for you.
Joining in a jam
Whether you’re wandering around the campground at a bluegrass festival or
heading to an evening session at the local acoustic music store, deciding if,
when, or how to join a jam session can be difficult and awkward. Each jam
session is a bit different from any other one, and many factors can affect your
decision whether to join in. You may see that a banjo player (or two) is
already part of the group, or maybe they’re playing faster than what you’re
used to. So how do you know whether you should take out your banjo and
join in? And how do you best start to play with others in a session?
Although the group dynamics of a jam session can be subtle, you need to
consider two important things before joining in:
 What is the general ability level of the jam session? If the skill level of
the other players seems to be significantly above your capabilities, the
better decision is probably to leave the banjo in the case and spend
some time watching and listening. However, if you’ve found a session
where the other players are just slightly better than you are, you may
have found an ideal jam to take part in.
If you join in a jam session where the players have less experience than
you do, keep your playing at their level. The other players will appreci-
ate your generosity and may even say good things about you behind
your back after the session is over. (And who wouldn’t like that?)
 How many other banjo players are already playing? In a more
advanced-level bluegrass jam, many musicians prefer to take part in a
session where just one player, or two at most, is on each instrument —
just like you see in a band playing on stage. By adding your banjo to the
mix, you could disrupt the musical dynamic that’s already been estab-
lished. On the other hand, if the jam is large and everyone seems to be
having a good time just playing along (and making a racket!), that’s a
good indication to join right in!
274
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Look for signs from the other musicians to gauge how welcome you may be
to their session. Players often sit or stand in a circle and if that circle opens
up right where you’re standing, that’s an unspoken invitation to join in. If one
of the other banjo players, or the person who seems to be leading the jam,
invites you to play, you’ve also just been given the green light.
When one of these signals occurs, you still need to figure out whether you
can hold your own on the banjo with these folks. But at least you now know
you’re welcome to play along if you choose to do so. By the way, turning
down an invitation to join in is fine if you’d rather listen.
Observing good jamming etiquette
After you’ve been accepted into a jam circle, it’s time to play! These first
moments can be stressful as you figure out your role (as well as remember
your rolls) in the session. Here are a few tips to make yourself a welcomed
guest after you’ve started playing:
 Play conservatively to get comfortable. If you’ve been asked to be a part
of a jam that’s already started, begin by playing quietly and simply, taking
cues from the other musicians as to when to take a solo. You want to give
room to the other banjo players in the session, especially with backup.
 Strive to make the group sound good. The best jams happen when all the
participants try their best to make the entire group sound good. Showing
off can be considered bad form, especially if you’re the newcomer in a
session. Don’t use an introduction to a new group of players as an oppor-
tunity to put on display everything you know, played at excessive speed.
 Keep good rhythm. Nothing spoils a jam session for other musicians
than someone who rushes the tempo, slows down, or starts and stops
while playing. Although missing a chord change or even blowing your
solo is alright, bad timing truly disrupts everyone in the session. If you
can’t keep up, you’d be better off not to play.
275
Chapter 12: Networking into Banjo Culture
Closed jams: A time to listen
Although you never see a sign indicating a jam
session is closed, you may find some jam ses-
sions where you aren’t welcome, regardless of
your playing level. Closed jams take place for a
variety of reasons that have absolutely nothing
to do with you: perhaps an annual reunion of old
friends who travel long distances to a festival
just to play music with one another or a band is
showing off its stuff for fans in an informal set-
ting. Exercise great caution and a lot of common
sense before joining in on what sounds like a
very high-level jam session around a private RV,
featuring just one other banjo player. This ses-
sion is likely private!

 Use good dynamics. For banjo players, good dynamics translates into
not playing too loudly. Tone it down when playing behind another instru-
mental solo or a singer who sings quietly. ’Nuff said!
 Be ready to contribute a song. In most jams, everyone gets the opportu-
nity to play one or more songs he chooses. Have several songs worked
up well enough so you can lead others through the song by telling them
the chords and directing the order of solos.
 Make sure that your song choice is appropriate and everyone knows
it. Don’t suggest “Stairway to Heaven,” “Take Five,” or “Smoke on the
Water.” Fit your song choices to the kinds of tunes that have already
been played in the session. If everyone is having fun playing traditional
songs with three chords, suggest another tune of this type. If more than
one or two folks are hesitant about playing with you on your tune, choose
something else that the other players can quickly catch on to as the
song is being played.
Sitting out a particularly challenging song in a jam is perfectly fine, but if you
find you’re sitting out on almost every song, you may want to put the banjo
back in the case. One strategy that works in many sessions is to stay outside
the primary circle of pickers and follow along quietly by mirroring what other
banjo players are doing, but being careful not to disturb the inner circle of
players as you play.
Attending Workshops and Camps
A fantastic way to jumpstart your banjo playing is to attend a workshop or
camp. Both events allow you to leave the rest of the world behind for a while
and focus on nothing else but playing banjo. You also get the chance to hang
out with legendary players and teachers as well as connect with other musi-
cians from not only your own part of the country but also all over the world.
If you’re interested in this type of experience, keep reading the following 
sections.
The most common excuse I hear from folks who don’t attend workshops and
camps is that they feel that they aren’t “good enough” to benefit from these
kinds of experiences or that their own playing skills are so marginal that they
will drag the other players down. Don’t be a needless victim of workshop 
anxiety syndrome! These events are designed to help each and every banjo
player move to the next level in their playing. You can’t find a “best” player 
or a “worst” player in these situations. Each musician has a personal and
unique set of strengths and weaknesses and all participants — teachers and
students alike — come to a workshop or camp ready to help others.
276
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

Workshops: Fine-tuning your techniques
A workshop is usually a one-day event, lasting from a couple hours to a full
day of instruction. Often, your area acoustic music store sponsors a weekday
evening or a weekend afternoon workshop when a well-known player passes
through town or when the local teacher wants to present a session on a par-
ticular topic, such as working up solos, banjo setup, or playing backup.
Workshops present a great opportunity to network with other local players
as well as provide an opportunity to experience different teachers’ perspec-
tives on playing. Plus, hanging out with a famous player for a couple of hours
and hearing this musician demonstrate techniques and play tunes in an inti-
mate setting is a whole lot of fun.
Most workshops are geared towards intermediate- to advanced-level players.
However, don’t let that dissuade you from attending a workshop if you’re a
beginning player — especially if the featured teacher is one of your banjo
heroes. Audio and video taping is usually encouraged at workshops, so if you
don’t understand everything that’s covered right then and there, you can
come back to this material later on when you’re ready for it.
Workshops are group instruction sessions, so don’t expect to receive much
individual attention from the instructor in this kind of learning environment.
On the other hand, you also won’t be asked to play for the teacher or the rest
of the class, so you don’t need to worry about trying to impress everyone
with your playing.
You can expect to spend from $25 to $80 on a workshop, depending on
the number of hours of instruction and the notoriety of the teacher. Don’t
forget to bring extra money to buy some of the instructor’s CDs, books,
and DVDs!
277
Chapter 12: Networking into Banjo Culture
Catching the workshop bug
Although workshops on topics related to the
banjo are naturally of greatest interest to us,
don’t pass up sessions that cover subjects such
as harmony singing, music theory, arranging
songs, or developing good listening skills. The
more general music knowledge you can absorb,
the stronger a banjo player you’ll be in the long
run. General workshop sessions also provide a
chance to meet local folks who play other instru-
ments, and these new friendships can result in
new jamming opportunities or even the formation
of a new band — featuring you on the banjo!

To find workshops in your area, check with your local acoustic music store
as well as your regional folk or bluegrass music association. Don’t forget to
also take a look at your favorite performers’ or teachers’ touring schedules,
which can quickly be accessed via their Internet homepages. In addition,
many festivals sponsor workshops as part of their programming at no extra
charge. Be sure to take advantage of these opportunities.
Banjo, bluegrass, and old-time camps:
Rubbing elbows with the pros
Camps are more intense experiences than workshops (see preceding sec-
tion), because they involve living from two to five days or more with 50 to 200
other music enthusiasts of all ages from all over the world who share your
passion for the banjo, bluegrass, and old-time music. Imagine spending time
and getting to know such banjo legends as Sonny Osborne, Mike Seeger,
Tony Trischka, Bill Keith, Pete Wernick, and Alan Munde — and even getting
the chance to play music with them and share a meal (or a game of hoops).
As the television commercial says, that’s priceless!
Well, not exactly. Camps are big investments, and after you factor in trans-
portation costs, you can easily spend $600 to $1,500 or more for this kind of
experience. Choosing a camp that matches your ability level, your musical
interests, and your personality is important. Camps are experiments in com-
munal living, and you also want to make sure you’ve selected an event that
fits your tastes in food, accommodations, and overall comfort level.
The biggest decision to make in choosing a camp is whether to attend a banjo
camp that’s designed just for banjo players or a bluegrass or old-time camp in
which the banjo class is part of a larger event that provides instruction on all
of the different instruments in the bluegrass and old-time ensemble (such as
guitar, mandolin, fiddle, bass, and dobro). Each type of camp has its own
strengths and advantages, so consider the points in the following sections as
you shop for a camp that’s a good match for you.
Banjo camp
The great thing about banjo camps is — you guessed it — they’re all about
banjos! You get small-group instruction in clawhammer and bluegrass styles
in an all-banjo, all-the-time environment where you play banjos, talk about
banjos, eat and sleep banjos, and maybe even take a few of them apart and
put them back together. Plus, you’ll never run across a more interesting bunch
of folks in your life than those you meet at a banjo camp — you’ll love it.
The main advantage of a banjo camp is that you soak in more banjo at this
event than you can at an all-purpose bluegrass camp. The larger banjo camps
have teaching staffs of up to 20 professional players with class offerings that
278
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

encompass a wider variety of styles than what you might encounter at a blue-
grass or old-time camp with fewer banjo teachers.
Most banjo camps offer instructional tracks designed for beginning-level play-
ers, with some camps even offering classes for those who are picking up a
banjo for the very first time. Even if you’re an advanced-level player, plenty of
great class topics are available for you to choose from. Read up on the types
of classes offered by each camp and the level of student that typically attends.
A few banjo camps I recommend include the Midwest Banjo Camp in Lansing,
Michigan (www.midwestbanjocamp.com); Banjo Camp North in the Boston,
Massachusetts area (www.mugwumps.com/bcn.html); the American Banjo
Camp near Seattle, Washington (www.langston.com/ABC); Pete Wernick’s
Winter Banjo Camps in Boulder, Colorado (www.drbanjo.com); and my own
NashCamp Fall Banjo Retreat near Nashville, Tennessee (www.nashcamp.com).
Bluegrass and old-time camps
Bluegrass camps offer instruction in bluegrass banjo style while old-time
camps focus on clawhammer and pre-bluegrass finger-picking techniques.
Some camps, such as the California Bluegrass Association’s Music Camp in
Grass Valley (www.cbaontheweb.org), offer instruction in both styles at the
same time. Other sponsors, such as the Augusta Heritage Center’s camps in
Elkins, West Virginia (www.augustaheritage.com) hold separate bluegrass
and old-time events at different times.
The advantage of a bluegrass or old-time camp that offers instruction in all
the instruments is that your jamming possibilities are much broader with an
event of this type. Many bluegrass camps put you together with other musi-
cians at your ability level to form a real (if temporary) band. The music you
make in this context can be the most rewarding and memorable experience of
your week at camp.
In addition to several hours per day of small-group instruction on banjo, you
spend the afternoons during the week practicing with your bandmates and
getting help from professional instructors as you work up a song or two to
play on stage for the other campers at the end of the week. You come away
from this kind of camp being more comfortable playing with other musicians
and having a greater understanding of the role of the banjo in a band.
In addition to the bluegrass and old-time camps I mention previously, other
great camps to check out include Camp Bluegrass in Levelland, Texas
(www.campbluegrass.com); NashCamp’s Bluegrass Weeks near Nashville,
Tennessee (www.nashcamp.com); Bluegrass at the Beach outside of
Portland Oregon (www.bluegrassatthebeach.com); and the Swannanoa
Gathering near Asheville, North Carolina (www.swangathering.org) for
old-time music.
279
Chapter 12: Networking into Banjo Culture

Room and board
Food and accommodations are usually included in the price of a music camp.
I bet you thought your days of sharing a bathroom with several other hall
mates in a college dorm and eating at the cafeteria were behind you, right?
Not so — at least not at a banjo camp! Many camps utilize college campuses
or actual summer camp venues to host their events to keep tuition prices as
reasonable as possible. Don’t be surprised to share a room with one or two
other people at most camps.
Living in such close quarters to other aspiring musicians is usually a high-
light of the camp experience for most students. You aren’t at camp long
enough for this living arrangement to be a hassle. However, if dormitory life
and shared bathrooms prove to be a bit too much for you, you can arrange
for private lodging at a local hotel during your camp stay.
A few camps, such as my own event, the NashCamp Fall Banjo Retreat held
each fall near Nashville, Tennessee (www.nashcamp.com), offer bed-and-
breakfast style accommodations with gourmet meals. You pay a higher
tuition for such extravagances, but if your creature comforts are a primary
concern, be sure to check out the fine print regarding food and lodging for
your camp as you make your decision on which camp to attend.
Heading to a Bluegrass Festival
The most popular way to experience bluegrass and old-time music and find
others to play music with is to attend one of the several thousand annual out-
door bluegrass festivals that are held all over the United States each year as
well as in Japan, the United Kingdom, and Europe. At a festival, you hear
renowned performers on stage as well as participate in jam sessions that take
place at all hours in campsites throughout the festival grounds. People flock
from all over to be a part of the fun, and you can too! In the following sections,
I break down what’s so great about bluegrass and old-time festivals and help
you find one near you.
Discovering what festivals are all about
A bluegrass festival can be one of the highlights not only of your banjo-playing
experience, but also your year. These festivals are designed for musicians
and their families to temporarily be part of a community who enjoys and
plays bluegrass and old-time music. The outdoor setting provides a perfect
context for down-home music making.
You can find bluegrass festivals of all shapes and sizes. Some bluegrass festi-
vals, such as Hardly Strictly Bluegrass in San Francisco, California (www.
hardlystrictlybluegrass.com); MerleFest in Wilkesboro, North Carolina
280
Part IV: Buyer’s Guide, Care and Feeding, and More 

(www.merlefest.org); the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado
(www.bluegrass.com); or the Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival in upstate New
York (www.greyfoxbluegrass.com) attract large international audiences
numbering 100,000 or more that travel to hear the most well-known perform-
ers in bluegrass and acoustic music today. Contrast this kind of event to a
local bluegrass or old-time festival held at a nearby county fairground with
around 300 to 400 people in attendance or a regional contest held out in the
country that attracts the best amateur musicians from a wide region.
Most festivals last from two to five days and are held outside, but a few cold
weather events, like Wintergrass in Tacoma, Washington (www.acoustic
sound.org) and Bluegrass First Class in Asheville, North Carolina (www.
bluegrassfirstclass.com), are held indoors at a hotel or convention
site. Very few festivals are free of charge, and most events charge up to $100
or more for a full weekend adult ticket (which really isn’t bad for a full week-
end of music). Children’s admission prices are frequently much less than an
adult ticket price, which allows the entire family to attend.
A bluegrass festival is different in several ways from a rock, jazz, or classical
music festival, and you can have more fun if you keep the following guidelines
in mind:
 Bring the whole family. Bluegrass festivals offer a secure and safe envi-
ronment for the entire family to have a good time. Your kids are soon
playing with new friends, and you’re playing music with the folks you’ve
just met at the campsite next door. And although you should bring the
spouse and the kids, remember that most festivals don’t allow pets.
 Pack your camping gear. You enjoy a bluegrass festival more if you camp
out at the festival site for the weekend. Bring all the equipment that you
would normally bring with you to a drive-in campground (or bring your
RV if you have one). You can buy a variety of food from festival vendors
or bring your own. Don’t forget sunscreen, insect repellant, rain gear,
and a flashlight (which you use to walk from one midnight jam session
to another without falling over a tent stake).
 Take your instruments. Don’t forget your banjo! At a larger festival, you
have many opportunities to play with others in campground jam ses-
sions at virtually all hours of the day (and night). Also don’t forget extra
strings, picks, and even an audio recorder to preserve a hot jam session
or a new tune.
A festival is also a great opportunity to get other members of your family
interested in playing, so be sure to pack extra instruments and bring these
with you. Don’t be surprised if someone in your family starts playing a
new instrument by the end of the weekend.
 Remember your earplugs . . . and aspirin. Your adrenalin keeps you
going until about Saturday afternoon at a three- or four-day festival.
Sooner or later, you need to catch up on your sleep and recover a bit from
whatever overindulgences you may have committed the night before.

Chapter 12: Networking into Banjo Culture

Finding a festival that’s right for you
Although seeing legendary performers at a large mega-festival is thrilling, you
may have just as much fun and get the chance to play more music by attend-
ing a smaller event closer to home. Many of my favorite bluegrass festivals,
like the California Bluegrass Association’s Father’s Day Bluegrass Festival in
Grass Valley (www.cbaontheweb.org) and the Gettysburg Bluegrass Festival
in Pennsylvania (www.gettysburgbluegrass.com), lie somewhere between
the two extremes. Make sure you choose a festival that’s large enough to
attract the best musicians in your region, but small enough to still easily
allow lots of opportunities to make music with others in a safe environment.
So how do you find just the right bluegrass festival? The Internet once again
is a great resource in finding the right music festivals for you in your area
and beyond. Visit www.bluegrassfestivalguide.com for a national data-
base of bluegrass and old-time festivals. You may also want to check out
Bluegrass Unlimited (www.bluegrassmusic.com) and The Old Time Herald
(www.oldtimeherald.org) magazines, because each publishes an annual
festival guide in their spring issues.
The Web site of your regional music association, the bulletin board of your
local acoustic music store, and the calendar listings provided by your local
bluegrass radio DJ can also point you in the right direction towards the best
area festivals. And don’t be afraid to ask other musicians what festivals they
like to attend — word of mouth is important too!
A wide variety of festivals around the country these days use the name 
bluegrass to describe their programming. Some of these events hire bands
popular with younger audiences, while others attract mostly retired folks.
Other festivals include a wide variety of music in their programming. The
kinds of bands hired to play at different festivals are a good indication of
what kind of audience will be in attendance. Make your decisions based on
which festival looks like the most fun for you and your family.

Chapter 13
Ten Tips to Make Practicing 
More Fun
In This Chapter
 Making the most of your practice time
 Discovering practical tips to make you a better player
P
ractice. Ugh. For many people, just the word itself conjures up bad memo-
ries of traumatic mandatory childhood music lessons. You already know
by now that if you’re going to make progress on the banjo, you have to practice
just about every day if you can, but I don’t want you to view this as a chore.
Practice should be something that you look forward to every time you pick up
the instrument. You gotta do it, so try to find ways to make it as fun as possible.
In this chapter, you find practical and useful tips you can use right now that
will keep you coming back time and time again . . . to practice!
Listen Actively
Actively listening to your favorite banjo music on CD or to other musicians at
concerts and jam sessions makes you a better player. Before you even start
to work on a new song, find a recorded version of it first and try to pick up
the song by ear. As you listen to great playing, you’re internalizing what the
banjo is supposed to sound like, the finer details of the style you’re learning,
and how the instrument fits in a group setting. Active listening also helps you
to remember a song’s chord progression and gives you ideas on how to
accompany others when you aren’t taking a solo.
Keep in mind that there’s a time and a place for active listening. To keep the
peace at home, carve out time when you can listen alone or in a way that
doesn’t disturb others (here’s where headphones can come in handy). If you
feel compelled every once in a while to expose your friends to your favorite
banjo music, be aware that they may not want to listen to “Whoa Mule” 20 or
30 times in a row (I’m not sure why however. . . ).

Set Goals
Setting short-, medium-, and long-range goals keeps your practice routine on
the right track and helps you to assess your overall progress. Your goals are
unique to you. If you’ve never played a stringed instrument before, your first
goal may be to successfully play a few simple songs for your friends. A little
farther out in time, you may aspire to hold your own in a beginners’ jam ses-
sion. If you’re feeling even more ambitious, someday you may want to play in
a local amateur band or organize your family to make music together.
Your long-range goals (where you want to be one to three years out in time)
determine your medium-range goals (6 to 12 months out in time). These
medium-range goals help you to focus on what you should be practicing in
the next one to two weeks (your short-term goals). Adjusting your goals
every once in a while is fine. They’re there to inspire you to keep scaling to
ever-greater banjo-playing heights, not to take all the fun out of playing.
If you’re taking lessons, work with your teacher to create a set of realistic,
achievable goals that you can put in writing. You can even do this on your
own. After you write down your goals, check back every month or two to see
whether you’re still on track.
Practice Regularly
Regular daily practice, even if each session is for a short amount of time,
leads to quicker progress than cramming in long sessions on your days off
from work. When my daughter Corey was learning to play piano a few years
ago, she came up with an interesting practice regimen: She would play for
five or ten minutes three or four times almost every day, approaching the
piano to play whenever the urge struck her. Similarly, when he’s at home,
banjo virtuoso Béla Fleck also practices several times a day in short intervals.
If you can play for a little while almost every day and find one or two days a
week where you can stretch out and play for a couple of hours at a time, all
the better. Keep in mind that the more skilled you are as a player, the more
practice time you need to advance to the next level.
Take the banjo out of its case and keep it on an instrument stand in your
practice area (but out of the way of dogs, cats, and young children who may
inadvertently tip it over). Then, when you’re ready to spend a few minutes
playing, your instrument is right there waiting for you.
286
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Warm Up
Athletes warm up with stretching routines, and you can do the same in your
practice sessions. Warming up is a very important part of your overall practice
as it prepares you mentally and physically for what comes next. When you
warm up, work on aspects of your playing that you don’t have time to think
about after you start playing faster.
For instance, you can devise warm-up exercises to isolate and work on spe-
cific right-hand picking patterns or left-hand techniques apart from songs.
Your warm up is also the time for you to focus on your tone, your rhythm, and
the clarity of your left-hand fretted notes, making adjustments when necessary.
Try playing a few of your favorite songs, listening carefully to the clarity
and fullness of each note and checking your overall technique as you play.
Chapters 4 and 5 cover the fundamentals of banjo technique and contain
excellent exercises for your warm up.
Although some players may need to warm up for only a few minutes before
they’re ready to move on (which is the case with some experienced players),
you may want to stay in this warm-up mode for up to 30 minutes or more
before moving on to work on specific tunes. That’s fine! Practicing “within your
zone” is better than wasting time playing things that are too difficult for you.
Use Tablature Sparingly
Although tablature (written music) is a wonderful resource that allows quick
access to hundreds of tunes and also allows you to study closely the sub-
tleties of a master player, use it in small doses. Tablature is great for showing
you the left and right mechanics of how something is done, but don’t confuse
the ability to read and play tab with really being able to play banjo. Try to
internalize the sound of what you’re playing as quickly as possible so that
you’re concentrating on what you’re hearing, rather than what your eyes are
following on the tab page. (For more tips on how to read tab, see Chapter 3.)
Using tab in a jam session can be a significant breach of custom. You can
begin to break the tab habit now by working on your accompaniment skills
and playing with other musicians at your level as much as possible. Think of
tablature as a road map, not a destination! (For more ideas on accompanying
others, see Chapter 4.)
287
Chapter 13: Ten Tips to Make Practicing More Fun

Get the Right Hand First
For adult learners, one of the most difficult aspects of banjo playing is putting
the right- and left-hand techniques together and using both hands at the same
time to play smoothly without interrupting the even flow of notes. If you’re
also experiencing this problem, try playing the right-hand part by itself on
the banjo’s open strings. After you have the rhythm and the mechanics of the
right hand down, begin to add the left-hand techniques, bit by bit if neces-
sary. Using this building-block approach may feel a bit mechanical at first,
but it can cut your learning time in half. Plus, this method is a good way to
check whether you’re playing something correctly.
Your right-hand technique communicates a lot about you as a player — your
tone, your rhythm and drive, your volume, and even your mood! When play-
ing with others, staying in rhythm is much more important than getting every
note fretted correctly. Great players spend a lot of time working on right-hand
technique. If you do the same, you’ll be a great player some day too!
You can get the basics of right- and left-hand techniques in Chapter 4; for
more in-depth coverage, check out Chapters 5, 6, and 8 for bluegrass banjo
and Chapters 5 and 6 for clawhammer banjo.
Gradually Increase Your Speed
Playing slowly until you master a technique or song is a tough guideline for
banjo players to remember, because they all want to play as fast as they can
as soon as possible. However, if the song doesn’t sound right when played
slowly, the tune isn’t going to get any better when played fast (trust me on
this one!). After you’re warmed up, use your practice time more efficiently
(and enjoy it more in the process) by practicing at a slow enough speed
where you’re still in control of what you’re playing. Keep in mind that this
tempo could be different for each piece you’re working on.
After you’re comfortable playing at a slower pace, you may decide that you
want to crank the speed up a notch. Regular practice with a metronome can
help you to play faster. First, find a tempo where you’re playing a song well
and get comfortable playing along without getting out of sync. Now try
increasing the tempo on the metronome to the next highest setting and start
playing again. The increase in speed is sometimes so gradual that you may
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

not notice a difference in the tempo at first. However, sooner or later you’ll
hit a bump in the road where you find one or two parts of a tune that give
you problems. Work on just those sections at the new tempo, and after you’ve
mastered them, start playing the entire tune again. You’ll soon be playing
effectively at a faster tempo. (See Chapter 10 for more on metronomes.)
Be patient with your progress in this area — speed is a function of time spent
with your instrument and is measured over months or even years. Especially
if you’re an older player or if you’ve never played a fretted instrument before,
speed may be the last element that falls into place as you’re learning to play.
Banjo music is virtuosic stuff — think of it in the same way as you would
approach a piece by J. S. Bach or Charlie Parker if you were an organist or
a sax player. You wouldn’t expect to pick up that kind of music overnight
would you? Just keep playing as much and as often as you can, and you will
reach your goals.
Take Songs One Measure at a Time
Tablature enables you to play a song from beginning to end without really
knowing what you’re playing. However, when you go to actually internalize
something that you just played from tab, you need to work on memorizing
each note and phrase and be able to move comfortably from one part to the
next without stopping. The best way to do this is to start at the beginning
(hey, what a concept!) and play the first measure or two over and over until
you’ve got it without looking at the tab. If you’re learning by ear, you want to
be able to play these measures by hearing them first in your head.
Listen to the sound of several measures played together and try to identify
the musical phrases of your song (think of a musical phrase like you would a
line of verse from a lyric — a phrase is a complete musical thought that usu-
ally consists of a couple of measures of music). After you’ve mastered the
first phrase, move on to the second phrase. After you’ve got the second
phrase down, spend a few moments playing the first and second phrases
together, remembering not to rely on the tablature. Keep building out in this
fashion to the end of the song, remembering to work each new phrase into
the entire tune as you go along.
You’ll likely encounter some repetition along the way, so after you have the
first section of a tune down pat, the second section usually takes less time.
(See Chapter 3 for an introduction to the anatomy of a song.)
289
Chapter 13: Ten Tips to Make Practicing More Fun

Play the Right Repertoire
If your goal is to play music with others, work on the tunes that they like to
play. Luckily, almost all bluegrass and old-time musicians learn a basic shared
set of tunes at one time or another. The musicians at your local jam session
may also play a few personal favorites, including some tunes that may be
unique to your part of the country. Keep in mind that more advanced players
share a different set of tunes than beginning-level players, bluegrassers have
a different repertoire than old-timers, and younger musicians may play some
different tunes than the older folks play.
In Chapter 6, you can play four tunes that are jam standards, using both blue-
grass and clawhammer techniques. These examples give you a good place to
start in terms of building up your repertoire. After you’ve mastered a few
basic pieces and you feel you’re ready to try a beginner’s jam session, find
out what tunes these musicians like to play. Attend the session and make a
list of the songs you hear or (with the permission of the other musicians)
bring a tape recorder along to record the pieces you don’t know, so that you
can work on them at home.
The Internet can also be of assistance as you search for tunes. Banjo player
Pete Wernick has lists of bluegrass jam session favorites at www.drbanjo.
com. You can also find several archives of old-time music; visit the homepage
of the Friends of Old Time Banjo (www.oldtimebanjo.com) for links to the
Digital Library of Appalachia at Berea College and other archival resources.
Keep Track of Your Progress
Most players keep a tune list in the front pocket of their music notebook. You
can group tunes in any way you like. Some players group by key or tempo,
while others create a list of tunes they already know, a list of tunes they’re
working on right now, and another list of tunes they want to learn in the near
future. A tune list comes in handy when you’re comparing what you know
with another musician, but you suddenly can’t recall a thing about any of the
tunes you know (believe me, it happens, even with professional players).
If you’re working hard at building up speed with the metronome, write the
tempo settings down in pencil for each tune you’re working on so that you
know at what tempo to start at your next practice session. You may also want
to maintain a practice diary where you can keep some brief notes about some
of the things you worked on that day and also remind yourself about what
needs more work the next time your pick up the banjo, which will be either
just after you put down this book today or tomorrow at the latest, right?

Chapter 14
Ten Banjo Players 
You Need to Hear
In This Chapter
 Getting to know some path-breakers in the world of banjo
 Exploring the music of the most influential banjo players to date
T
his chapter presents ten players (more if you care to count) who have
made a difference in the world of the banjo. They’re not only the best at
what they do, but they have also been among the most influential upon other
banjo players. Some have expanded the musical potential of the banjo, while
others are responsible for bringing new audiences to the instrument. I end
this chapter with a list of other great players you should check out if you
have the time.
Earl Scruggs (b. 1924)
You can’t possibly overstate Earl Scruggs’s influence on the world of the
banjo. His three-finger technique is the most emulated banjo style in the
world and is the important defining characteristic of bluegrass music (for
more on bluegrass banjo, see Part II and Chapter 8). After raising the banjo
within country music from a simple accompaniment instrument played by
comedians to an instrument capable of the highest levels of virtuosity in the
1940s, Scruggs helped popularize the banjo and bluegrass music with a large
national audience in the 1950s and ’60s through television appearances
(The Beverly Hillbillies) and movie soundtracks (Earl’s unforgettable show-
piece “Foggy Mountain Breakdown” was featured in Bonnie and Clyde).
Hundreds of thousands of banjo players cite him as a primary influence.
Check out The Essential Earl Scruggs (Columbia) for a good overview of his
music and career. Scruggs’s early 1960s instrumental masterpiece Foggy
Mountain Banjo (Copper Creek Roots/Columbia) is the best bluegrass banjo
instrumental album of all time.

Pete Seeger (b. 1919)
In the 1940s through the 1960s, Pete Seeger placed the banjo front and center
in the American folk song revival as part of a long and prolific career as a
singer, songwriter, author, and political and environmental activist. Pete’s
1948 book How To Play The Five-String Banjo was the first instructional book
on American folk banjo styles. This book reveals his musical eclecticism, with
chapters also devoted to blues and Spanish and South American music in
addition to clawhammer, old-time, and bluegrass playing techniques. (For
more specifics on banjo techniques, check out Parts II and III of this book.)
On the head of his trademark long-neck banjo is written “This Machine
Surrounds Hate and Forces It to Surrender.” You may want to check out his
CD Darling Corey and Goofing Off Suite (Smithsonian Folkways) for a taste of
Seeger’s wide-ranging musical sensibility.
Béla Fleck (b. 1958)
Béla Fleck emerged from the progressive bluegrass scene in the 1980s to
blaze trails and set new standards for the banjo within contemporary rock,
jazz, classical, and world music. He’s the premiere banjo player in the world
today, bringing a staggering technical ability and lyrical musicality to the
music he creates with his band, Béla Fleck and the Flecktones, and through
collaborations with such diverse artists as Chick Corea, Zakir Hussein, Edgar
Meyer, Tony Trischka, and others. I recommend listening to the bluegrass-
oriented Tales from the Acoustic Planet (Warner Brothers), the classical
recording Perpetual Motion (Columbia), and the Flecktones’s The Hidden Land
(Columbia) to learn more about today’s most influential player.
Tommy Jarrell (1901–1985)
Some of the best traditional clawhammer banjo playing in the world originates
from the Round Peak, North Carolina and Galax, Virginia areas. Although
Tommy Jarrell is more celebrated as a fiddler, his drop-thumb clawhammer
banjo playing, usually on a fretless banjo, has influenced many of today’s
finest players, including Paul Brown, Bruce Molsky, Brad Leftwich, and Kirk
Sutphin. Simultaneously intricate and hard driving, Jarrell’s music, along with
other clawhammer players such as Wade Ward, Kyle Creed, Fred Cockerham
and Matokie Slaughter, served as a bridge connecting the music’s late 19th
century rural Southern roots to the modern old-time music revival. For more
on Jarrell, check out The Legacy of Tommy Jarrell Volume 3: Come and Go
With Me (County), a recording featuring Tommy’s solo clawhammer playing.
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Bill Keith (b. 1939)
The banjo’s innovative Renaissance man, Bill Keith helped to develop the
melodic style of banjo playing, enabling banjo players to play scales while
still using familiar three-finger roll patterns. This widely adopted technique
empowers the player to reproduce note-for-note versions of everything from
a fiddle tune to a Bach invention and has significantly enhanced the banjo’s
musical potential. (For more on the melodic style, see Chapter 8.)
Keith is also responsible for the Keith “D” tuner, which allows the player to
quickly and accurately move from one pitch to another within a song. To dive
in deeper to Keith’s music, you can explore Something Auld, Something New
(Rounder) for Bill’s ingenious playing on bluegrass and jazz tunes.
Mike Seeger (b. 1933)
Mike Seeger (Pete’s half brother) has devoted his life to singing, playing, and
documenting traditional music made by American southerners before the
media age. With over 25 field recordings to his credit, Mike has helped to pre-
serve the diversity of southern folk banjo styles while exposing historically
important players such as Dock Boggs to a wider audience.
As a player, Mike uses old-time music as a wellspring for his own creative and
personalized fusions, forming a model for contemporary artistic expression
within this genre that has influenced hundreds of other old-time players.
Southern Banjo Styles (Smithsonian) is essential listening if you want to get a
feel for what Mike Seeger is all about.
Uncle Dave Macon (1870–1952)
Nicknamed the “Dixie Dewdrop,” Dave Harrison Macon was the most popular
banjo player in the first decades of commercial country music (from the
1920s to ’40s) and the early Grand Old Opry’s biggest star. With musical roots
in 19th century minstrel, folk, and vaudeville music, Macon, whose folksy 
performing style earned him the nickname of “Uncle Dave,” brought a dizzy-
ing array of banjo playing techniques to the sound of early country music.
His outrageous humor and showmanship often obscured his considerable
banjo playing skills, which are on fine display on the recording Go Long Mule
(County).
293
Chapter 14: Ten Banjo Players You Need to Hear

J. D. Crowe (b. 1937)
Considered the most influential banjo player of bluegrass music’s modern age
(1970s to the present), J. D. Crowe brings a forceful right-hand attack and a
bluesy intensity to his Scruggs-based bluegrass banjo playing. With crisp,
aggressive pull-offs and ideas borrowed from early rock ’n’ roll and country
guitar, Crowe is also a superb and influential band leader. The mid-1970s 
version of his band, The New South, featuring mandolin player Ricky Skaggs,
guitarist Tony Rice, and dobro player Jerry Douglas, set the standard for the
sound of modern bluegrass, absorbing contemporary country and folk influ-
ences. J.D. Crowe and the New South (Rounder) and The Bluegrass Album Band,
Vol. 1 (Rounder) are essential discs for any banjo player’s music collection.
Don Reno (1927–1984)
Around the same time Earl Scruggs was learning to play in nearby North
Carolina, Don Reno developed his three-finger approach to banjo playing in
South Carolina. As his professional performing career blossomed in the 1950s
and ’60s, Reno separated himself from Scruggs’s sound by bringing a new set
of playing techniques to bluegrass banjo, adopted from his extensive knowl-
edge of country guitar playing. From jazzy chordal licks to virtuosic single-string
runs and an innovative right-hand technique, Reno’s playing offered an alter-
native to Scruggs’s approach within bluegrass and has inspired several suc-
cessive generations of bluegrass banjo players. Reno’s Founding Father of the
Bluegrass Banjo (CMH) is a compilation of some of his best late-career work.
(See Chapter 8 for an introduction to Reno’s single-string playing technique.)
Sylvester (Vess) Ossman (1868–1923)
This classic banjo performer recorded almost a thousand cylinder and disc
recordings at the dawn of the recording era, from 1893 to 1917, and was prob-
ably America’s most well-known banjo player at the beginning of the 20th
century. Ossman had spectacular fingerpicking technique and a wonderful
rhythmic feel to his playing. He was usually accompanied by piano, band, or
orchestra. The immense popularity of ragtime in the early 1900s is reflected
in Ossman’s repertoire, which included marches and popular music of the
day as well as music composed for the banjo (see Chapter 7 to play two early
20th-century classic banjo pieces).

Alison Brown (b. 1962)
Count this Nashville-based banjoist at the top of the list of today’s most influ-
ential progressive players. Combining influences from jazz, folk, Latin, blue-
grass, Irish, and world music, Brown’s work on electric and acoustic banjo is
lyrical, warm, and virtuosic — all at the same time (a rare accomplishment
on this instrument)! She fronts the Alison Brown Quartet, a jazz-tinged
ensemble featuring drums, piano, and bass, and she also heads up her own
record label, Compass Records. Check out Stolen Moments (Compass) for the
acoustic side of Brown’s playing and Out of the Blue (Compass) for a listening
adventure in jazz fusion.
Tony Trischka (b. 1949)
Tony’s reputation as the first avant-garde bluegrass player was established in
the 1970s through a series of groundbreaking recordings filled with startling
original compositions. Luckily, the rest of the banjo world has finally caught
up to him. Today, in addition to being at the forefront of the boldest of banjo
explorations, Tony is known as a master of a wide variety of traditional banjo
styles, including Scruggs-style bluegrass banjo. He’s a complete player who’s
at home in any kind of music played on the banjo. Tony is also known an out-
standing instructor who has influenced thousands of players through his
books, DVDs, and private teaching. Count such players as Béla Fleck, Chris
Pandolfi, and yours truly among his dedicated students. Check out Double
Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular and World Turning (both on Rounder Records) for
a sampling of music from this very influential player.

banjo neck (frets one through five) along with five chord shapes used for 6th
and 9th chords. 
I’ve included a movable banjo chord position chart, Figure A-3, which shows
the positions of the G, C and D movable major, seventh, minor, and diminished
chords on the first 12 frets of the banjo. A movable chord position requires
the left hand to fret strings one through four of your banjo. The advantage of
movable chords is that they can be easily shifted up and down the neck to
fret new letter name chords.
To find other letter name chords using these same positions, shift the movable
chord position up or down according to the order of notes listed below:
G    G#/A%
A    A#/B%
B    C    C#/D%
D    D#/E%
E    F    F#/G%
G
For example, if you fret the F-shape G chord that’s found at the fifth fret (and
shown on the upper left chart on the movable banjo chord positions page),
and if you move this chord up two frets, you’ll now be playing an A chord.
Note that the A note is located two notes above the G note, as shown in the
list above. Each adjacent note corresponds to a one fret change up or down
on your banjo neck.

Appendix A: Banjo Chords and Notes

Figure A-3: A movable banjo chord position chart.
Notes on the Banjo in G Tuning
Figures A-4 through A-8 show you the names of the notes on the banjo finger-
board in G tuning. Knowing these names can be useful in building chords and
for locating melody notes on your banjo. Each figure lists the names of the
notes on an individual string.
There are often two notes (for example, G#/A%) at the same fret. Called 
enharmonic equivalents, these notes have the same pitch but are called either
by one letter name or the other depending upon what key you are playing in.

About the CD
T
he CD that accompanies this book contains a whopping 94 tracks. Each of
these tracks contains musical examples that you can listen to and prac-
tice as much as you need to in order to improve your banjo playing.
A fun way to use Banjo For Dummies is to scan the chapters for the On the CD
icon. In every instance, the text flagged by this icon refers to a musical exam-
ple that not only appears as written music, or tablature, but also is presented
as an audio track on the book’s CD. When you see an example that seems
interesting, skip to the corresponding track on the CD and give it a listen.
Maybe you can even play along.
Relating the Text to the CD
Throughout the book, the text contains musical examples that you can play
and practice over and over again. These musical examples most often come
in the form of tablature. If a piece of tablature appears on the CD, the CD’s
track number appears in the tab’s caption. Just use the track-skip buttons on
your CD player to move to whatever track you want to listen to. 
System Requirements
For many of you, all you’re going to do is pop the CD in your CD player and
skip around to the tracks you want to hear and play along with. Others may
want to load the CD onto a computer. This section helps you do both.
Audio CD players
The CD included with this book will work just fine in any standard CD player.
Just pop it in and press play or use the track-skip buttons to jump to what-
ever tracks you want to explore.

Computer CD-ROM drives
If you have a computer, you can insert the CD into your CD drive to access
the MP3 files of all the CD tracks. Make sure your computer meets the mini-
mum system requirements shown here:
 A computer running Microsoft Windows or Mac OS
 Software capable of playing MP3s and CD audio (such as iTunes or
Windows Media Player)
 A sound card (almost all computers these days have the built-in ability
to play sound)
 A CD-ROM drive
Using the CD 
To install the items from the CD to your computer’s hard drive, follow these
steps:
1. Insert the CD into your computer’s CD-ROM drive. The license agree-
ment appears.
Note to Windows users: The interface won’t launch if you have autorun
disabled. In that case, click StartÍRun (For Windows Vista, StartÍ

D:\Start.exe. (Replace D with the proper letter if your CD drive uses a
different letter. If you don’t know the letter, see how your CD drive is
listed under My Computer.) Click OK.
Note for Mac Users: The CD icon will appear on your desktop; double-
click the icon to open the CD and double-click the Start icon.
2. Read through the license agreement, and then click the Accept button
if you want to use the CD.
The CD interface appears. The interface allows you to install the MP3
files onto your hard drive with just a few clicks.
3. If you would like to install the MP3 files of the CD audio tracks onto
your computer, click the MP3 button.
You can now copy the MP3 files from the CD to your hard drive.
306
Part VI: Appendixes 

The Tracks on the CD
