Chapter 1 
Introduction 
There is a strong and broad-based need from many educational, research and commercial 
organizations and individuals for information on the planning, design, construction and 
operations of seawater systems (salinities from freshwater to brines) with flow rates in the 
range of 10-1000 gallons per minute (40-4000 liters per minute). While the objectives 
of these systems vary widely, they all depend on a common technological and biological 
database. Since the seawater system is usually only a means to an end, most potential users 
have little prior practical experience or technical knowledge in this area. Practical information 
on seawater systems for culturing purposes tends to be fragmented and not readily available 
in usable form. Most conventional engineering experience is with marine systems which are 
orders of magnitude larger. This technology is often not readily scaled down, or directly 
useable and, more than likely, prohibitively expensive. 
Unfortunately, neither a good understanding of the biology nor the engineering alone is 
likely to result in a practical system. Biologists generally do not understand the mechanical and 
hydraulic aspects, engineers usually do not sufficiently appreciate the biological requirements, 
and usually neither appreciate the economic and regulatory constraints that can heavily 
influence decisions. In short, because success depends on a blend of expertise, avoidable 
mistakes with seawater systems are common. While many may claim expertise, there are, 
in fact, few experienced bioengineers available and they tend to be associated with small 
consulting companies specializing in these matters. 
Bioengineers generally spend much of their time 'educating' the user or client to the 
tradeoffs and consequences of major-system decisions. Not uncommonly, major-system 
decisions have already been made and fixed prior to seeking bioengineering assistance. This 
can be a serious problem. In addition, this bioengineering expertise may be either unavailable 
or unaffordable to many potential users. While considerable knowledge and experience 
has been gained with the design, construction, and operations of seawater culture systems, 
this accumulated experience has been very poorly documented and is therefore not readily 
available. In addition, much of this knowledge has been learned the hard way by trial and 
error. Since communications are poor, the same mistakes tend to be made over and over again. 
This book is intended to fill these gaps and hopefully reduce seawater systems problems. For 
simple systems and conditions, this book may be completely adequate. For more complex 
systems or conditions, this book may avoid the expensive mistakes often made by users early 
in a project and greatly reduce the 'user education' phase of system design. 
Even with this book as a guide, many projects will be sufficiently complex to require 
the user to seek outside technical expertise. There are usually a number of sources of 
'free' technical help, such as universities, equipment manufacturers, or various governmental 

extension services. This is all well and good if the needs are limited to advisory services. 
These sources will generally not provide any design services, such as systematic evaluations of 
alternatives, numerical sizing of systems or components, or providing drawings, construction 
specifications or cost estimations. At some project scope or stage of development, the 
user may have to seek professional aquacultural consulting services. There are a number 
of considerations, alternative approaches, tradeoffs, and potential problems in this complex 
matter (see Mayo, 1998). 
The seawater flow rate range of 10-1000 gallons per minute (gpm) or approximately 
40-4000 liters per minute (lpm) has been chosen because it includes the vast majority 
of such systems currently in use. Many educational systems tend to the low side of the 
range while large research-oriented systems are towards the upper end. This also includes 
marine aquariums and most commercial and governmental molluscan, crustacean and marine 
fish hatcheries. The only major omission is large-scale commercial grow-out operations (as 
distinct from the hatchery phase). For economic reasons these systems tend to be much larger 
and often tidally pumped, either with ponds, pens or cages, and are outside the scope of this 
book. 
The stated flow rates of interest are very small by industrial water use standards. As 
an example, a single-unit 1000-megawatt nuclear power plant may pump 500,000 gpm 
(1,900,000 lpm) of water through its condensers. While the necessary equipment and 
techniques to handle the flows of interest to us are well within the mechanical and hydraulic 
state of the art, aquaculture imposes additional constraints on the design and operations which 
are not normally encountered in industrial applications. The primary additional constraints 
are due to the life support requirements of the culture organisms. This may include both 
maximum and minimum concentrations of dissolved gases, major ions, heavy metals, trace 
organic contaminates or particulate matter, to name just a few. Therefore, the available 
industrial water handling equipment and techniques must be used with caution when applied 
to seawater culturing systems. 
The primary objective of this book is to provide, in one place, basic information and 
considerations necessary to plan, build and operate seawater systems for culturing purposes. 
Due to the complexities of the subject and the fact that requirements of specific situations 
are highly variable, all the potentially important information cannot be fully developed or 
presented in a single book. Since a unit of aquatic animal or plant biomass, to a good 
first-order approximation, will react similarly under identical conditions, species differences 
have purposely been de-emphasized. This simplifies the presentation, broadens the usefulness 
of the text, and allows generalized conservative guidelines to be developed. Considerable 
thought and effort has been applied towards providing directions for more detailed efforts in 
the form of references and appendices in various technical areas. The book is not primarily 
intended for the experts or those already very experienced with seawater systems, although 
conditions vary widely and 'experts' may also find it to be of value. The primary value to 
'experts' may be in the substantial accumulation of readily accessible data. The authors have 
found the first edition of their own book to be a valuable and frequently consulted reference. 
Of particular importance is Appendix A, which covers conversions of units, definitions, and 
seawater properties. The subject of this book crosses many different disciplines, interests, and 
backgrounds. This can cause considerable confusion with definitions and units of measure. 
Mixed systems of units are common and often unavoidable. Even within a system of measure, 

there may be several different parameters and units commonly used for a particular purpose. 
Appendix A provides definitions, conversion factors between units and important constants to 
reduce this confusion. However, the problem is often more complicated than straightforward 
numerical conversion. As an example, a 1 in. pipe is not the same as a 2.54 cm pipe. A '1 in.' 
pipe is not a dimension, since neither the inside nor outside diameters are likely to be exactly 
this dimension, but rather a designation, which does not readily convert without knowing 
the type of pipe and the industrial standard involved. At least in the Western Hemisphere, 
industrial equipment and engineering practices are still predominantly in 'English' units while 
scientific matters are largely metric. The International System of Units (abbreviated SI in all 
languages) is intended as a basis for worldwide standardization of measurement units. Even 
in those countries using SI units, it is unlikely that all units will be SI (though they may be 
related to SI units). For example, the units of volumetric flow are cubic meters/second. A 
flow of 50 gpm is equal to 0.0032 m3/s, an inconveniently small number for practical use. 
The units of hour, day, month, liter, and hectare are not SI units. For practical applications, 
one must often cope with mixed units. For these reasons, this book has purposefully not 
standardized on either system. Numerical examples, provided to demonstrate methods, may 
be in either system or even have mixed units. 
In the United States, the conventional decimal marker is a dot ('.'). Outside of the United 
States, the comma (',') is sometimes used as a decimal marker. In the United States, the 
comma is also used to separate digits into groups of three (for example, 24,567), a practice 
that can cause confusion. The SI convention recommends separating digits into groups of 
three using a small space instead of the comma (for example, 24 567). This book will use the 
dot as a decimal marker and the comma as a separator. 
Another area of confusion arises in the use of parts per hundred (%) (or parts per thousand, 
%0). While this convention is convenient in many situations, it is important to understand that 
because the parameter is expressed as a percent, the actual number has not changed. A 2% 
growth rate is 2 parts per hundred or actually 0.02. A 1000 lb of fish growing at 2%/day, will 
grow 1000 x 0.02 = 20 lb, not 1000 x 2 -- 2000 lb. Computer spreadsheets can reduce the 
chance of errors as they allow numbers to be displayed as percentages, but retain the actual 
values for use in computations. 
The First Edition of this book was published in 1989. There have been a number of 
developments in this field since that time. Probably the most significant is the rapid growth 
in the industrial infrastructure specifically designed for aquatic life support activities. In the 
past, most of the equipment has had to be taken and adapted on an individual basis from other 
fields such as wastewater treatment, chemical process industries and various industrial and 
manufacturing applications. This change, while dramatic, has been more of an adaptation and 
modification process rather than the development of any radically new processes. In short, 
while there is now a considerably wider choice of parts and equipment and they are also easier 
to identify, the basic principles are unchanged. The changes that have occurred are reflected in 
the unit process chapters of this Second Edition. 
Computer use has accelerated rapidly in our society. This has had some impact in the 
form of greater computer usage in the monitoring and control of life support system and 
for data acquisition and dissemination. Chapter 14 has been renamed (Alarms, Monitoring 
and Control Systems) and expanded and Appendix N (Computer Data Search) added to 
include these changes. Since the first edition of this book was published, three important 

changes have impacted the organization of this revised edition: the widespread availability of 
computer spreadsheets (EXCEL and 123), the consolidation of the software industry, and the 
ability to communicate rapidly over the Internet. For routine computations, the spreadsheet 
has largely replaced both the remote mainframe computer and to a significant degree, the 
use of hand-held calculators. (Newer hand-held calculators are much more user-friendly and 
many have the ability to plot results.) The combination of these two technologies allow the 
posting of useful spreadsheets on a website, the downloading (or e-mailing) of these programs 
to personal computers, and use of these programs. The common spreadsheet programs are 
available on a wide number of platforms (IBM, Macintosh, Sun, etc.) and commonly can read 
other spreadsheets (for example, EXCEL can read Lotus 123 spreadsheets). 
The regulatory and permitting environment has, in general, gotten a lot more severe 
since the First Edition. This is due to a lot of factors, such as reduced site availability, 
expanding populations, competition and conflicts in the near-shore environment, and increased 
legislation. The effects can differ considerably between regions and can be quite local in their 
specific characteristics. Increased constraints exist on both the supply side, for access to good 
water, and on the discharge side, relative to discharge permitting. Treatment prior to discharge 
is becoming much more common and more extensive. Water problems have increased interest 
and development in greater water reuse. While considerable progress has been made in high 
reuse system technology, these systems are not suitable for some applications and are still 
economically constrained for other applications. 
Biosecurity, in terms of reducing the transmission of pathogens between internal units as 
well as with the outside, has gained in importance in some applications. These include marine 
mammal rehabilitation facilities and for hatcheries of various kinds. This can have major 
design impacts. Physical security has also increased in importance due to possible treats of 
vandalism or terrorism as well as due to liability concerns in our increasingly more litigious 
society. 
The numerical problems contained in the First Edition have proven useful. The Second 
Edition includes even more examples in the various subject areas. However, practical problems 
rarely include only one subject area but more often require application and synthesis of a 
number of different technical and non-technical aspects. For this reason, Chapter 19 (Putting It 
All Together), dealing with integrating problems and examples, has been added in the Second 
Edition. 

Chapter 2 
Problem Definition and Establishing Requirements 
2.1 Design process 
The design process is a complex and iterative operation. It has many characteristics that 
are common to all hardware systems, whether they are seawater systems or space shuttles. 
There exists many simplified schematics of the process. Fig. 2.1 has many of the common 
components of such models and has been chosen to be compatible with the format of this 
book. All human activities are motivated by subjective human needs. These are basic needs 
such as for food, shelter, clothing, security/defense, educating and rearing of the young 
and, by extension, making money. These needs have to be translated into specific objectives 
(see Section 2.2) which might be satisfied by hardware systems, in our case seawater 
systems. These statements of objectives generally need considerable greater refinement and 
quantification before any design calculations or dimensioning can be done (see Sections 2.3

and 2.4). Systems synthesis or, if preferred, systems design, is done in the next phase. 
However, it cannot be done in isolation. The total environment (physical, economic and 
legal/political/social) within which the system is expected to operate must be considered. The 
environmental factors impose limitations or constraints on system design. These constraints 
may be physical, economical, legal, time or other factors. It is not at all uncommon that 
the constraints are sufficiently severe to make the design of a workable system impossible 
or impractical. In this case, the only option is to reexamine the statements of objectives or 
requirements. This evaluation and feedback will often occur, even when it is not a matter of 
infeasibility. It is often done to improve performance or lower initial or operating costs. Many 
cycles of design, evaluation and redesign may occur before the decision to build is made. 
Feedback often occurs into the construction and operating phases, but is hopefully limited to 
matters of 'fine tuning'. Major reevaluations in the later phases can be serious matters that can 
be fatal to projects. The benefits that result from the operations of the system hopefully meet 
the needs that initiated the project in the beginning, assuming that these have not appreciably 
changed with time. 
2.2 Defining objectives 
A critical first step in the design process is the clear definition of the objectives of 
the system. While this book is directed towards applications with educational, research or 
commercial objectives, what does this actually mean? Is the education to be of the 'show and 
tell' variety common to public aquariums, or of the participatory type more characteristic of 
field stations or in a more formal academic context and for what age group or audience. Is it 
for tropical or temperate species, how many species, both animals and plants, which species, 
how many, etc.? What specifically are the educational goals? How many people at a time 
and for how long? Similar questions can be developed for research and commercial systems. 
While the answers may vary widely, they will strongly influence the specification and design 
of the system. Wrong directions or assumptions at the beginning of a project can seldom be 
reversed later without high cost, extensive delays, or poor system performance. Such mistakes 
often prove fatal to the project. 
System objectives may be based on (1) a clear present need, (2) a potential need that must 
be addressed, (3) an anticipated future need, or (4) a combination of the first three. While it is 
very difficult to clearly define in quantitative terms, present and future objectives, it has to be 
done. Considerable time and effort should be devoted to checking all assumptions, identifying 
implicit assumptions and resolving differences in objectives between the participants. Many 
doomed projects have been launched based on a false premise, which no amount of 
engineering ingenuity or operator expertise can overcome. It is also not uncommon to 
have different participants in a project working towards different and sometimes conflicting 
objectives. In addition, there is often the problem of unstated or 'hidden' objectives. These 
might involve aspects of 'prestige', bureaucratic needs, or even individual egos. 
What can considerably complicate the matter is that it is very rare to have just a single 
well defined objective. The more common pattern is a series or a hierarchy of objectives in 
decreasing priority. Educational systems are often also used for research purposes, commercial 
systems usually have active research aimed at improving production, and research systems 
may have limited holding or production requirements. The problems are generated by the fact 

that the requirements to support the different objectives may be in direct conflict or indirectly 
competing for scarce resources (time, money, water flow, etc.). The ordering and relative 
priorities of the various objectives can significantly influence design decisions. Since relative 
priorities of objectives is by necessity subjective, personnel changes can dramatically alter 
project objectives. Not uncommonly an important requirement or objective is not considered 
during design. The discovery of new requirements can prove to be seriously disrupting 
and expensive. An example is provisions for visitors, both formal and informal. While 
considerably removed from their basic objectives, research and commercial systems often 
entertain visitors for educational, promotional or 'public relations' reasons. These visitors can 
easily get in the way, pose a biosecurity hazard, threaten the work in progress or present a 
liability risk, if these potential problems have not been foreseen. Making a good impression 
and 'looking good' does have some value and might be considered during design, even for 
these types of systems. 
During the early stages of a project, the objectives are not fixed but dynamic. They change 
as new evaluations are made and design feedback is provided. They characteristically proceed 
from an initial general statement to greater and greater refinement and detail, which consider 
all of the objectives, priorities, and given conditions. A simple example for a commercial 
shellfish hatchery is given below:

2.3 Quantifying requirements 
The problems of establishing requirements for a new culture system and defining them 
quantitatively is a very difficult task. It is the source of the biggest and costliest mistakes. 
The basic statements of needs, which launch the project, are often quite subjective and not 
quantified. These statements of need must go through many iterations of progressively greater 
detail, refinement, and evaluation before anything can be built and operated. The problems of 
translating basic objectives into quantitative terms necessary for construction are usually not 
given the attention and scrutiny they deserve.

One common and frequently encountered basic mistake is that the user at the very 
beginning of the project makes a number of major system's decisions without knowing the 
system consequences, without any sort of systematic evaluation and based solely on a priori 
judgment. These types of decisions are listed in Table 2.1. Such decisions may be irreversible, 
such as the site having already been purchased or otherwise secured. These decisions and the 
specifics of any given situation are so interactive that, if these decisions have to be accepted 
as 'givens', the project may be doomed before it starts. The tradeoffs involved with these 
decisions can be long and complex. Species selection may be fixed by research or educational 
needs. Criteria for selection of species for commercial culturing can be more involved (Webber 
and Riordan, 1976a) but the decision is often erroneously made on marketing considerations 
only. Site selection is equally complex with many important considerations (see Chapter 3). 
While there is no such thing as a perfect site, a bad site can easily doom a project. Bad choices 
with respect to the other decisions in Table 2.1 can, depending on circumstances, be equally 
serious. The probability of irreconcilable conflicts between the 'fixed' system's decisions 
and the project objectives and criteria is greatly increased if there exists strong economic 
constraints. It is common to have 'no acceptable solution' without fundamental changes in 
the project. If not recognized early, this can prove fatal to the project. The considerations and 
tradeoffs involving many of these decisions will be considered further. 
Another basic mistake is for the user to provide the general objective statements and 
then bow out of the process expecting someone else to 'engineer' the system. This can 
result from the users inability to answer detailed quantitative questions about both present 
and future needs. The user then assumes that the questioning engineer is better qualified to 
quantitatively define the requirements. The end result can be equipment and facilities which, 
in their approach, dimensions and capabilities, have implicit statements about not only present 
and future objectives and requirements but also on priorities, future growth, and management 
and operating philosophies. In addition, if the engineers do not have considerable prior 
experience with biological systems, 'sound engineering judgment' can produce systems that 
cannot adequately support the culture organisms and may hurt them directly. Sometimes such 

mistakes can be remedied, but often can only be reversed at unacceptable cost. Working 
around such built-in problems often results in accepting reduced capacity, reduced efficiency, 
operating constraints, increased cost and increased risks. 
It often happens that even after considerable iteration between users and engineers, future 
requirements cannot be precisely defined. This is not surprising, since a fixed major seawater 
system and associated facilities may have a useful lifetime of 50 years or even more, and 
external conditions can dramatically change several times in this period of time. The problem 
is likely to be most acute for research oriented systems, due to the rapidity with which their 
requirements can change. Philosophically there are two extreme approaches to this problem. 
One is to purposely build the system for only the limited period of time for which the 
requirements can be clearly defined. This can be the best approach, especially for some 
seasonal or temporary systems, which may be entirely reconfigured and rebuilt from year to 
year, or if intended for some highly specialized purpose. This approach generally has the 
lowest initial cost. The dangers are that the requirements may change faster than anticipated 
or the system may not be abandoned or replaced when originally planned. The result may 
leave the user with an expensive to maintain system with low reliability and marginal 
usefulness. Under these conditions the overall cost could be very high. The alternate extreme 
approach is to hedge against all uncertainty by providing extra capabilities to match the 
range of uncertainties and by providing design features which will simplify future additions 
and modifications. Experience has shown that system requirements can change very rapidly 
with time and are not entirely predictable. However, the vast majority of changes in system 
requirement's are usually in directions that were at least considered during design, and often 
even anticipated. Changes in requirements are likely to occur late in the design phase or 
early in the operational phase and they can be very disruptive if they were not foreseen. 
The problems with this approach are that future requirements may develop in completely 
unanticipated directions and that, in the extreme, this approach inevitably becomes money 
limited. A flexible or adaptive system can cost much more than one whose requirements can 
be precisely stated with confidence. 
2.4 Production cycle 
Based on the system objectives, the production cycle must be defined and may include the 
following items. 
(1) The total number of steps in the production cycle. For many species, a separate rearing or 
holding unit may be needed for each step. For short-term holding of a single adult species, 
there may be only one step. In contrast, a hatchery for even a single species might include 
broodstock holding, adult maturation, spawning, larval rearing and rearing of juveniles. 
Each of these steps or phases might have distinctly different requirements and facilities. 
(2) The total amount of time required for each step. This may be highly variable, depending 
on assumed environmental conditions, such as temperature, food sources and other 
factors. 
(3) The reproductive potential of the adults and the survival during each step. The repro- 
ductive potential in many species can be strongly influenced by conditions during the 
maturation process. Survival can also be highly variable depending on the system used, 
culturing conditions, and the skill and knowledge of the operators.

Example 2.1. Computation of required capacity per stage 
It is desired to produce 100,000 of the rare alpha fish, with an average weight of 1.5 pound each. The 
following data on alpha fish have been derived from previous operations. The tendency is to use for design 
the best of previous results, with the consequences that expectations are extremely over-optimistic relative to 
initial operations of a new system. Compute the number of individuals needed at the start and end of each 
rearing stage.

270 females 
Number males, 270/4 
68 males 
Starting with the production objective and survival data for the last step, the number of 
animals needed at the start of the last step can be computed. This process is repeated for 
each production step in reverse order and will result in the total number of animals or adult 
spawners needed at the front end (see Example 2.1). 
This information for each stage will also be used to compute the required water flows 
and tank volumes needed, as shown in a more detailed example for a shrimp hatchery 
(Example 2.2). However difficult, these parameters must be quantified. Since the inputs for 
these calculations are functions of assumed environmental conditions, operating procedures, 
and expertise of personnel, the numerical results usually have high uncertainty. The planning 
numbers often prove to be very optimistic relative to actual subsequent performance. If 
multiple species are being considered, the problems and uncertainties are increased. If the 
species are closely related, the differences may be important to the project but fortunately are 
often of minor importance in terms of impacts on equipment requirements and procedures. 
Since the parameters are interdependent, there are also a number of possible tradeoffs 
between production cycle values and water quality, environmental conditions, food sources, 
procedures, loading densities, economics and acceptable risks. One of the most common 
tradeoffs is the faster growth versus increased costs of more optimum temperature control. 
Other common tradeoffs are the increased cost of higher water quality or greater feed quantity 
versus the faster growth they may produce. In the absence of hard data directly relevant to 
the conditions of a given project, these tradeoffs can become highly subjective with a high 
premium on prior direct personal experience.

Example 2.2. Shrimp hatchery capacity and sizing 
A marine shrimp hatchery is designed to produce 1,000,000 post-larval (about P-20) shrimp per month. The 
total process takes about a month. The following data for a 'large tank' hatchery have been compiled from 
similar operations.

(B) The spawning females are temporarily moved to the spawning tanks and then quickly returned to the

(typical water depth 12-18 in., use 12 in.), estimate the total maturation tank bottom area, water volume, and 
required seawater flow rate using research criteria. 
Tank bottom area (based on 2 animals/m 2) = 146/2 = 73 m 2 (2580 ft 2) 
For 1 ft water depth, volume = 22.25 m 3 (786 ft 3)

volume at each stage and identify the limiting condition.

The most limiting time from a loading standpoint is, not surprisingly, at the end of the culturing cycle. 
Note: While the numbers in this problem have been taken from several sources on 'large tank' hatcheries, the 
example presented in Fig. 5.2 is for a similar 1,000,000 PL/month penaeid shrimp hatchery.

2.5 
Production 
modeling 
The space and water requirements of aquatic species depend strongly on size of the 
animals. Therefore, in cases where significant growth occurs, it is necessary to estimate total 
biomass, space, and water requirements on a weekly or monthly basis. Production modeling 
typically requires the following input components: 
- Time-step for the model; 
- 
Estimated starting and ending dates; 
- 
Initial and final weights (or lengths); 
- Growth model; 
- Mortality model; 
- 
Water flow and animal density requirements; 
- 
Metabolic production functions (if needed). 
The output of the production model is an estimate of the total biomass in the group as well 
as the water and space requirements. This information can be used to estimate the ending date 
of the production cycle or estimate what temperature changes would be necessary to achieve 
a needed ending date. For commercial operations, this type of analysis is used to adjust 
the starting dates of multi-batch production facilities to achieve maximum output or relative 
constant harvest rates (Watten, 1992). 
There are a vast number of different types of growth models for different life stages, or for 
different species. Three simple models will be discussed: A L method, degree day method, and 
the exponential method. Additional information on length-weight relationships, presented as 
conversions between lengths and weights, is commonly needed by species. 
2.5.1 Growth Models 
The AL method is based on Haskell's work on trout (Haskell, 1959). He observed that 
at a constant temperature and adequate food supply, the increase in the length of a fish is a 
constant. This same relationship has been commonly observed for mollusks and crustaceans: 
Lt+l 
-- Lt + AL 
(2.1) 
where Lt+l is equal to the length at time t 4- 1, L is equal to length at time t, and AL is 
the change in length/unit time. The AL is typically expressed in inches per day or inches 
per week. It is also possible to derive the following relationships for specific growth rate and 
specific feeding rate: 
[AW] 
3xALxl00 
(2.2) 
Specific growth rate (%) - 
-- 
100 - 
L 
IF ] 
3 x AL x 100 x FCR 
(2.3) 
Specific feeding rate (%) - 
~ 
100 - 
L 
where A W is change in weight, W is weight, F is wet weight of feed/time period, and FCR 
is feed conversion ratio (feed input/change in weight). 

13 
If the AL is expressed as inches per day, the specific growth and feeding rates will be 
in %/day. Once the A L is known, growth and feeding rates can be computed if the feed 
conversion ratio and length are know. 
The AL method can be applied to variable temperatures by the use of what is commonly 
called the temperature unit theory. This 'theory' is based on the assumption that over some 
temperature range, growth is directly proportional to temperature. The dependence of AL on 
temperature has the general form of 
AL = (TUGR)(T- To) 
(2.4) 
where TUGR is equal to temperature unit growth rate (inches/day per ~ 
T is the water 
temperature (~ 
and To is the temperature (~ 
that results in no growth (AL = 0). For many 
cold-water species, To is generally assumed to be equal to 0~ (Westers, 1981). Eq. 2.4 can be 
used to modify Eqs. 2.2 and 2.3 for changes in temperatures. This discussion has been based 
on daily ~ temperature units; other forms of the temperature unit have been used (monthly 
temperature units and temperature units based on ~ 
An example of production planning 
with the AL method is presented in Example 2.3. 
When weight is plotted against time, the growth of many species can be described by an 
exponential curve of the form: 
Wt = Woe Gt 
(2.5) 
where Wt is weight at time t (g), e is base e (2.71828183 .... ), W0 is weight at t -- 0 (g), G is 
specific growth rate (%/day), and t is time (days). 
In general, a single value of G may be valid for only part of the growth curve, although the 
growth over the whole period may be modeled by dividing the growth curve into successive 
exponential segments. Many aquatic species are only reared over short periods of their total 
life, and a single value of G may be entirely adequate. The value of G will depend on species, 
temperature, and the specific rearing conditions (see Example 2.4). 
If the weight is known at two times, Eq. 2.5 can be solved for the growth rate (G): 
G -- [ln(W2) - ln(W1) I 
- tl 
(2.6) 
where In is the natural logarithm, W1 = weight at tl, and W2 is the weight at t2. 
2.5.2 Mortality Models 
Mortality data are typically quite site- and system-dependent. For modeling purposes, it is 
common to assume a fixed mortality in terms of %/day or %/week. 
2.5.3 Length-Weight Relationships 
The relationship between length and weight for aquatic animals has the form of: 
W = cL" 
(2.7) 
where W is wetweight in grams, L is length in mm, and c and n are species-specific 
constants. Typical values for c and n are presented in Table 2.2 for important culture species. 

Example 2.3. Growth model using the A L method 
Compute the total biomass, specific feeding rate, and total feed requirement for 100,000 chinook salmon using the AL method (Eqs. 2.1-2.4). The 
temperature (~ 
is equal to 11.5 § (7.5) sin (0.985d + 238.4), where d is the Julian day (1-366). The initial length = 140 mm, c = 8.1910 -6 mm/g, 
n = 3, FCR = 1.3, mortality -- 0.25%/week, TUGR = 0.08 mm/day per ~ 
and To = 0~ 
The fish are ponded on 4/19/95 and the final target weight is 
300 g. With the given conditions and equations, the following table of predictions can be developed. The final weight of 300 g is estimated to be reach on 
9/13 after 21 weeks of rearing.

The weight term in Eq. 2.7 is generally reported on a wet weight basis. For mollusks, wet 
body weight (excluding shell weight) may be reported. For crabs, the width of the carapace is 
used. For crayfish, shrimp, or lobster, length is measured in terms of carapace length or total 
length. Carapace length is typically measured from the back of the eye socket. The value of n 
for fish is near 3.0. The value of c for fish typically ranges from 5 x 10 -6 to 15 x 10 -6. Both 
n and c may vary with sex, especially for mature animals (see Example 2.5). 
Example 2.4. Comparison of exponential growth curve with AL methods 
The following growth curve was observed over a 360-day trial (Actual weight column). Compute the 
exponential growth rate from Eq. 2.5 and compute the predicted weight for each time step. Compare results 
with AL method (c -- 11.22 x 10 -6 and n -- 3.00) using the mean AL for the whole production cycle.

Note that it is always possible to fit an exponential growth curve between any initial and final weights of any 
growth curve. This does not mean that it is a good fit. For this example, the AL method (Eq. 2.1; column 7) 
gives a far better fit than the exponential method (Eq. 2.5; column 5). See the following plot of the actual 
weights versus the predicted weights from the exponential and AL methods.

2.6 Types of systems 
There are several possible types of seawater systems and these are classified at two 
extremes as open cycle and closed cycle systems. Open or flow-through systems depend 
on relatively large quantities of good quality incoming seawater to provide life support to

W - cL n, where length is in mm and weight in grams. Note that the actual value of c is the value of c in the table 
• 10 6. 
The value of n does not depend on the units of weight or length, but the value of c depends on the units of both. 
Much of the length-weight data reported in the literature are based on other units. The value of c in other units can 
be converted to c based on millimeters and grams by observing that if L = 1 mm then W = c. The value of c is 
equal to the weight in grams of a 1 mm animal. Therefore, in a system based on inches and pounds, convert 1 mm 
to inches and solve for weight. Convert weight in pounds to grams -- this is the value of c that should be used in

the culture organisms. When the seawater's properties become unacceptable, the water is 
discharged. The advantages of open systems are proportional to the input water quality and 
quantity. If the input water parameters are consistently good and no discharge treatment is 
required, these systems are clearly the simplest, cheapest, most reliable and have the least 
risk (see Fig. 2.2A). Few, if any, completely open systems exist. The incoming seawater may 
require some treatment before use. This may include filtering to protect pumps or remove 
eggs, larvae or debris, heating/cooling, aeration/degassing or settling of solids. In addition, 
it is very rare that there would not be some internal water treatment in the system (see 
Fig. 2.2B). This might include adding oxygen, removing uneaten food and fecal matter or 
reducing the concentrations of pathogenic organisms. Flow-through systems can become quite 
complex. Depending on physical and regulatory conditions, it may be necessary to treat 
process water prior to discharge (see Fig. 2.2C) and such requirements are becoming much 
more common. Systems that are predominantly open or flow-through systems are by far the

most common type, although this is not reflected in the available literature (see Appendix B). 
The available literature on flow-through systems is sparse, unbalanced in representation and 
biased towards research oriented systems. 
A completely closed cycle system, such as a well balanced aquarium, has no water inflow 
requirement, except to make up for evaporation, and no discharge (see Fig. 2.3A). The water 
is treated and reconditioned internal to the system by a series of complex biochemical and 
physical processes. If everything is working well, all the processes are in equilibrium and 
good water quality is maintained. Any changes, such as increased feeding, chemical additions, 
adding or removing animals, or even cleaning parts of the system, can destroy the delicate 
balances. For most practical uses, a completely closed system of any appreciable size is 
difficult to monitor and manage and is often uneconomic if any alternatives exist. There

can be depletion of necessary trace materials and build-ups of other persistent contaminants 
to troublesome levels. Periodic recharging with new seawater is often required. Thus, even 
closed systems need access to good quality seawater or use high cost artificial seawater. 
Therefore, some net flow through the system is usually present and a better label for most 
systems would be a water reuse system (see Fig. 2.3B). Generally a 90% water flow reuse 
(10% new water and 90% reconditioned water) can be achieved with reasonable processing. 
Technical and management difficulties progressively increase as one approaches 100% reuse 
(completely closed system). The difficulties and their severity are conditional on the specific 
circumstances. A reuse system being operated at a fraction of its carrying capacity is likely 
to be much less trouble than one being operated at its limits. In spite of the difficulties, 
complexities and costs of seawater reuse systems, there is considerable prior experience with 
such systems in the size range of interest (see Appendix C). Closed systems have primarily 
been used in marine aquariums, which are often far from the sea or in urban areas with highly 
polluted seawater. In marine aquariums small numbers of organisms are held in good water 
quality conditions. The operating costs of these systems may be in the range of US$10-1000 
per year per pound of animals. Much of this expense is due to maintaining the appearance 
of the water (turbidity and color) required for public viewing, rather than for the life support 
requirements of the animals themselves. High reuse systems, under some conditions, may be 
economical for hatchery operations, short-term holding, or for very high value organisms, but 
have generally proven uneconomical for the growth of shrimp, lobsters and fish to marketable 
size for human food unless heavily subsidized. 
Thus, there is a spectrum of possibilities between completely open and completely closed 
systems. If sufficient quantities of good quality water are readily available, the decision will be 
towards the open systems due to their greater simplicity, reliability and lower costs. However, 
if sufficient water is not available or of poor quality, or if environmental considerations are 
paramount, there will be a tendency towards greater water reuse. While leaning towards one 
type or the other, most seawater systems have some net water flow through the system as well 
as some degree of water reconditioning internal to the system and increasingly some required 
post treatment of discharge water. It is, therefore, useful to consider the systems externally as 

20 
open or flow-through systems while considering various water reuse or reconditioning options 
internally. In short, internal reuse loops in a flow-through system (Fig. 2.3B) or in a more 
elaborate version as shown in Fig. 5.1. 
2.7 System carrying capacity 
The carrying capacity of a flow-through system is dependent on many parameters and 
the specifics of any given application. Table 2.3 lists just some of the factors that might be 
critical. These factors cannot be considered independently, but must all be evaluated relative 
to the biology of the culture organisms. This complex evaluation of environmental parameters 
and organism biology is often termed 'water quality'. While much is known relative to 
economically important species, there are nevertheless a number of important data voids for 
culturing purposes (Huguenin and Colt, 1986). One of the most significant problems is that 
most of the data on water quality criteria are based on short-term experiments, and in many 
cases, lethal effects. Detailed criteria based on chronic effects and long-term experiments 
are unavailable for many species over their life spans. Low risk and fast growth require 
not stressing the organisms. The acceptable values for 'no stress' are often not precisely 
known. Determining the water quality requirements and inherent tradeoffs for specific culture 
organisms and life stages is critical and essential to the specification of the seawater system 
(see Appendix D). A very brief review of water quality parameters and water quality 
considerations is presented in this section. 
Water quality criteria for use with marine systems will be needed in the site selection 
process and loading computations. They may be quite different from published environmental 
protection criteria (for example, USEPA, 1976, 1986), as these criteria are formulated to 
protect a wide range of ages and species. In a specific marine system, (a) only a single species

may be cultured and for a only a part of its life, (b) the animals may be held for only a 
short time (example, holding of lobsters or test animals), or (c) the condition of the animals 
may not be too important as long as they do not die too rapidly. For some key parameters 
such as ammonia, the formulation of a single fixed criterion based on a no-effects level may 
be inappropriate or at least costly for many applications. Water quality criteria for research 
applications may be more restrictive than for environmental protection. For the small volumes 
of seawater flow involved in most research projects, the cost of maintaining exceptionally high 
water quality is usually not significant compared to labor, equipment, and supplies. 
Two types of water quality criteria may be specified: screening criteria and production 
criteria. Preliminary screening and production criteria for fish and crustaceans are presented 
in Table 2.4. The screening criteria are used to screen potential sites or seawater sources. If 
measured water quality does not satisfy the screening criteria for all components, small-scale 
rearing experiments may be needed prior to construction or more extensive water treatment 
will be required prior to use. High concentrations of ammonia, nitrite, and metals may 
make a site unacceptable as they are expensive and difficult to remove. On the other hand, 
low dissolved oxygen, high concentrations of nitrogen gas or hydrogen sulfide, while not 
desirable, can sometimes be economically treated. Production criteria are the criteria used in 
the actual culture system. They may be significantly different for marine algae than for fish 
and crustaceans. In particular, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and phosphorus compounds may 

22 
have to be enriched many times to support rapid growth of aquatic plants. The important water 
quality criteria parameters are given in Table 2.3 and are discussed below. 
2.7.1 Ammonia 
Ammonia is the major end-product of protein metabolism in most aquatic animals. The 
toxicity of ammonia is due to the free or un-ionized form (NH3) while the ionized form (NH +) 
has little toxicity. Un-ionized ammonia is typically reported as nitrogen and written as NH3-N. 
Ammonia concentration expressed as the NH3 compound can be converted to a nitrogen basis 
by multiplying by 0.822. Wet chemical tests measure the sum of the un-ionized and ionized 
ammonia or the total ammonia (called total ammonia nitrogen or TAN when expressed on a 
nitrogen basis). 
The concentration of un-ionized ammonia depends primarily on total ammonia, pH, 
temperature, and salinity. The mole fraction of un-ionized ammonia is equal to the percent 
un-ionized ammonia/100. The concentration of un-ionized ammonia is equal to: 
Un-ionized ammonia (mg/1 as NH3-N) - otTAN 
(2.8) 
or 
Un-ionized ammonia (Ixg/1 as NH3-N) - 1000otTAN 
(2.9)

Sames notes as Table 2.5. 
where ol is mole fraction of un-ionized ammonia (%/100), and TAN is total ammonia nitrogen 
(mg/1 as N). 
Values of the mole fraction of un-ammonia are presented in Table 2.5 for freshwater and 
brackish waters and in Table 2.6 for marine waters. At a given pH and temperature, the 
concentration of un-ionized ammonia is significantly less in seawater (see Example 2.6). For 
equal concentrations of total ammonia, the concentration of un-ionized ammonia is typically 
higher in seawater because of the generally higher pH compared to freshwater. Therefore, the 
carrying capacity in seawater is generally lower relative to freshwater (see Section 2.7). There 
are situations where one may wish to increase or adjust the un-ionized ammonia concentration 
(see Example 2.7). 
The concentration of un-ionized ammonia is strongly dependent on pH. In freshwater, pH 
meters are calibrated with low ionic strength buffers, commonly called 'NBS' or National 
Bureau of Standards buffers. Tables 2.5 and 2.6 are based on the use of these buffers. The 
National Bureau of Standards has been renamed as the National Institute of Standard and 
Technology (NIST), but commonly these buffers are still called 'NBS' buffers. 
In seawater, many chemists use a 'tris' seawater buffer (Hansson, 1973). While the use 
of this buffer has important thermodynamic advantages, it is not commercially available. 
Experimental work on the ammonia equilibrium in seawater (Khoo et al., 1977) is based on 
this pH scale. A number of researchers have published tabular listings or computer programs 
for the computation of percent un-ionized ammonia in seawater based on this work (Hampton, 
1977; Bower and Bidwell, 1978; Spotte and Adams, 1983). The computation of un-ionized 
ammonia from these articles must be based on the use of the 'tris' seawater buffer. The error 
resulting from the use of 'NBS' type buffers with these data will be greater than the use of 
equilibrium constants for freshwater. 

24 
Example 2.6. Computation of un-ionized ammonia nitrogen 
Given a water temperature of 20~ pH of 7.9, salinity of 35 g/kg (ppt) and a measured total ammonia 
nitrogen (TAN) of 0.82 mg/1, what is the concentration of un-ionized ammonia nitrogen in Ixg/l? Is the 
concentration of un-ionized ammonia greater in freshwater or seawater at the same pH and temperature. 
(A) Using the pH and water temperature read the mole fraction (or) from Table 2.6 and Eq. 2.9. 
c~ = 0.0169 (dimensionless) 
NH3-N = 1000 (c~) (TAN) = 1000 (0.0169) (0.82) = 14 Ixg/1 
(B) Comparison of un-ionized ammonia in seawater and freshwater 
Mole fraction (or) for freshwater - 0.0304 (Table 2.5) 
Mole fraction (or) for seawater = 0.0169 (above) 
From Eq. 2.8, the concentration of un-ionized ammonia is proportional to mole fraction and therefore the 
concentration in freshwater is greater by: 
{ 0"0304 - 0"0169 ] 100 = 79% 
0.0169 
2.7.2 Nitrite 
Nitrite, an intermediate in the conversion of ammonia to nitrate, can oxidize the iron in 
hemoglobin such that it is unable to transport oxygen. The toxicity of nitrite, while still 
formidable, is significantly reduced in seawater due to the high concentration of chloride and 
calcium (Lewis and Morris, 1986). 
2.7.3 Nitrate 
Nitrate is the final compound produced by the oxidation of ammonia. This compound is 
largely nontoxic, except at very high concentrations, which can occur in closed systems. 
2.7.4 Dissolved Oxygen 
The equilibrium or saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen depends on temperature 
and salinity. Saturation concentrations of dissolved oxygen are presented in Table 2.7 for 
salinities in the range of 0-40 g/kg and water temperatures of 0-40~ 
Photosynthesis and 
solar heating can produce dissolved oxygen concentrations higher than saturation (supersat- 
uration). Dissolved oxygen concentrations significantly less than saturation are commonly 
produced by pollution. Dissolved oxygen concentration must be measured immediately after 
sampling to avoid changes with time in the sampling container. For fish and crustaceans, 
growth will be reduced when the dissolved oxygen falls below 6 mg/1 and significant mor- 
tality will result below 2-3 mg/1. Bivalve shellfish may be able to tolerate lower dissolved 
oxygen concentrations for extended periods of time, especially if the temperature is low. Water

Example 2.7. Adjustment of un-ionized ammonia 
A bioassay tank contains 40 1 of water with a temperature of 5~ 
salinity of 35 g/kg and a pH = 8.0. 
How much NH4C1 must be added to produce an un-ionized ammonia concentration of 1000 Ixg/1 NH3-N? 
(A) Compute concentration of TAN 
From Table 2.6, 
mole fraction (or) --- 0.0067 
From Eq. 2.9, 
1000 Ixg/1 = (1000) (0.0067) TAN 
TAN = 149.3 rag/1 
(B) Compute concentration and weight of ammonia chloride. 
TAN or total nitrogen is based on nitrogen with a molecular weight of 14.0 g/mole, therefore, molecular 
concentration is equal to: 
149.3 x 10-3/14.0 = 1.066 x 10 -2 moles/1 
The molecular weight of NH4C1 is: 
N 
(1 • 14.00) 
-- 
14.00 
H 
(4 • 1.01) 
-- 
4.04 
C1 
(1 • 35.45) 
= 
35.45 
53.49 g/mole 
NHaC1 = (1.066 x 10 -2) (53.49) = 0.570 g/1 
Total amount of NHaC1 required = (0.570 g/l) (40 1) -- 22.8 g 
temperature, even within seasonal variations, can significantly impact the oxygen saturation 
concentration (see Example 2.8). 
2.7.5 Carbon Dioxide 
High carbon dioxide concentrations reduce the ability of animals to transfer oxygen. 
Carbon dioxide concentrations should be maintained below 10 mg/1 (Smart et al., 1979), 
although many animals can tolerate higher levels, especially if the dissolved oxygen is high. 
For marine plants, the more dissolved carbon dioxide the better, as it is often the growth 
limiting substance. In fact, in the mass culturing of phytoplankton, such as may be needed 
in bivalve or shrimp hatcheries, direct carbon dioxide injection into the water may be used 
to increase growth rate. Some care must be taken to control carbon dioxide concentrations 
even in aquatic plant culture as it is possible to reduce the pH to below 5 at extremely high 
concentrations. 
2.7.6 Hydrogen Sulfide 
High concentrations of hydrogen sulfide may be present in well waters or the bottom water 
of some marine bays with restricted circulation. Samples used for total sulfides analysis must 
be specially treated to prevent loss of hydrogen sulfide gas during transport and analysis. 
A criterion of 1 t~g/1 of hydrogen sulfide gas is suggested as a maximum for fish and 
crustaceans.

Example 2.8. Air solubility of oxygen in seawater 
It is important to understand the air solubility effects created by seawater temperature changes. Assume a 
salinity of 20 g/kg and atmospheric pressure. 
(A) Increasing the seawater temperature from 5 ~ to 20~ will increase or decreases the air solubility of 
oxygen and by what percentage? 
Table 2.7, for 5~ C* = 11.175 mg/1; for 30~ C* -- 6.772 mg/1 
[6.772-11.17511.175] 100=-39% (decrease in solubility) 
(B) Assuming oxygen saturation at 5~ and none of the dissolved oxygen is allowed to escape during the 
heating to 30~ what is the percent saturation of oxygen at 30~ 
The final dissolved oxygen concentration is the same = 11.175 mg/1 
11.1751 100 : 165% of saturation 
6.772 J 
2.7.7 Total Gas Pressure 
Gas supersaturation can be produced by a variety of natural and man-made conditions (see 
Section 12.4) and many surface waters and seawater wells are, at least at times, supersaturated 
with dissolved gases. Lethal gas pressure ranges from 100 to 200 mm Hg, but levels in the 
range of 40-50 mm Hg may increase the mortality of fish on a chronic basis (Colt, 1986). Gas 
supersaturation must be measured in situ. A maximum criterion of 20 mm Hg is suggested for 
fish and crustaceans. Dissolved oxygen is not a good measure of total gas supersaturation. 
2.7.8 pH 
The normal pH of seawater ranges from 7.9 to 8.2. Values outside of this range may 
indicate pollution or excessive freshwater runoff. Animals that typically live in full-strength 
seawater can be very sensitive to changes in pH outside the normal range. Animals that live in 
tidal streams or estuaries may be much more tolerant to changes in pHs. A criterion of 7.9 to 
8.2 is suggested. As discussed in the ammonia section, pH meters may be calibrated by use of 
two different types of buffers. The low ionic strength buffer ('NBS' type) is widely available 
for general use and most pH readings are based on this buffer. 
2.7.9 Residual Chlorine 
Chlorine is widely used to disinfect drinking water, wastewater prior to discharge, and 
prevent fouling of heat-transfer systems in power plants. It is also used to control fecal 
coliform counts in marine mammal pools and to disinfect water used in molluscan and shrimp 
hatcheries. A maximum criterion for chlorine residual of 1 Ixg/1 is suggested for fish and 
crustaceans. Marine mammals can tolerate considerably higher concentrations without ill 

28 
effects. Analysis of chlorine residual at this low level is difficult and expensive. Common wet 
chemical tests for chlorine residual are not reliable below 20-100 Ixg/1. 
2.7. l0 Temperature 
The temperature of seawater may vary from - 1 to greater than 40~ 
No single criterion can 
be suggested, as some animals can survive over this full range, while most will be restricted 
to only a portion of this range. The water quality criteria for temperature will depend on the 
species and the life-stage. Rapid temperature changes are entirely another matter. Very few 
animals can tolerate even modest temperature changes if rapid and prolonged. For prolonged 
temperature changes, a change up or down of not more than I~ per day is recommended. 
2.7.11 Salinity 
The salinity of seawater is expressed in terms of parts per thousand (g/kg). In older 
literature, the symbols %o or ppt (parts per thousand) are often used. The salinity of seawater 
may vary from 1 to greater than 40 g/kg. Salinity can be easily measured by use of 
conductivity or refractive methods. The water quality criteria for salinity will also depend on 
the species and life-stage. As with temperature, different organisms may have broad or narrow 
tolerances and rapid changes can be very stressful, even within the acceptable range. 
2.7.12 Heavy Metals 
Heavy metals include cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, 
and zinc. High levels of manganese and iron may occur in well water low in dissolved 
oxygen. Samples used for heavy metal analysis should be treated with acid to reduce loss of 
metals during travel and storage. The presented criteria (Table 2.4) are based on total metals 
(particulate § dissolved forms) as the toxic mode for iron and manganese may be physical 
blocking of the gills by particulate matter (Chen et al., 1985). If water is aerated and allowed 
to stand for days before analysis, the majority of the iron and manganese will precipitate out 
of solution. Therefore, high iron and manganese concentrations may not be reported if water 
samples are allowed to stand for sometime prior to analysis. The addition of 1-10 mg/1 of 
EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetate, a common chelating agent) can significantly reduce the 
toxicity of heavy metals and it is commonly used in some crustacean and molluscan hatchery 
facilities. Screening levels for metals may be several times higher than those listed in Table 2.4 
if use of EDTA is anticipated. 
2.7.13 Biocides 
A vast number of organic chemicals are introduced into the natural environment. These 
include herbicides, pesticides, and industrial chemicals. Rare storm events may introduce 
significant quantities of such chemicals from agricultural runoff or resuspend them from the 
bottom. Such storm drainage problems can be anticipated but are not obvious site selection 
considerations (see Chapter 3). Depending on the purpose of the seawater systems, it may 
be necessary to conduct detailed monitoring of water, sediment, animal tissue, or conduct a 

29 
pilot-scale operation to assess the potential problems from biocides and industrial chemicals. 
Acutely lethal concentrations of biocides can be introduced into streams and ponds from 
transport accidents (crop duster crashes, truck crashes, or railcar derailments). Extreme water 
levels may also result in destruction of agricultural and industrial distribution facilities and 
float containers of biocides and toxic chemicals for significant distances. 
2.8 Carrying capacity guidelines 
While the carrying capacity of flow through systems are dependent on species biology 
and specific conditions, there are some generally valid 'rules of thumb' that can be used 
for planning purposes, assuming good quality input water. The intensity or carrying capacity 
of an aquaculture system can be described by a number of parameters. The most common 
parameters are: 
Volumetric density (lb/ft 3) - 
mass of animals (lb) 
(2.10) 
volume of rearing unit (ft 3) 
Areal density (lb/ft 2) = 
mass of animals (lb) 
area of rearing unit (ft 2) 
(2.11) 
mass of animals (lb) 
Loading (lb/gpm) = 
(2.12) 
flow to rearing unit (gpm) 
(60) (flow to unit, gpm) 
Exchange rate (exchanges/h) = 
(2.13) 
volume of unit (gal) 
Loading, exchange rate and volumetric density are related by: 
8.02 • density 
Loading (lb/gpm) = 
(2.14) 
exchange rate 
Another important measure of rearing intensity is cumulative oxygen consumption (COC). 
For a single rearing unit, COC is equal to DOin- DOout. For n rearing units in series, the 
COC is equal to: 
i=1 
COC (mg/1) - ~ 
(DOin 
-
-
 DOout) 
(2.15) 
The COC depends strongly on animal size and temperature and therefore integrates both 
animal size and metabolic activity. 
If loading rates are maintained at low values (high exchange rate), densities in small-scale 
experimental systems have been as high as 34 lb/ft 3 (545 kg/m3). These numbers are 
well above any practical values. The maximum practical density will depend on water 
quality considerations, management skills and the ability of the particular species to tolerate 
crowding. Maximum loading rates in production systems typically range from 4 to 10 lb/gpm 
(0.5-1.2 kg/lpm). For research purposes maximum loading rates typically range around 1 
lb/gpm (0.125 kg/lpm) or less. 
Carrying capacity may not be limited by water flow but by volumetric or area density. 
Surface area limitations often apply for plants due to their need for sunlight and to organisms 
that require a substrate, such as some shellfish. A substrate requirement may also be combined 

30 
with quantifiable territorial needs of the organisms. As an example, juvenile or adult lobsters 
and some crabs are cannibalistic bottom dwellers and generally must be individually isolated 
to prevent unacceptable mortality. In surface-limited systems, the capacity can sometimes 
be increased by stacking substrate layers or clever packaging. For organisms that tolerate 
communal crowding, volumetric density is an important economic parameter, having a direct 
impact on the required rearing volume and a major impact on capital costs. The maximum 
density depends on both the loading and behavior characteristics of the animals. Much of the 
available volumetric data are of questionable use because of the interactions between biomass, 
density and loading. As an example, if 1000 lb of fish is held in 1000 ft 3 of rearing volume 
with 1000 gpm of flow, this results in a loading of 1 lb/gpm and a density of 1 lb/ft 3. If the 
biomass of fish is doubled both the loading and the density are also doubled. If the flow is 
cut by half, the loading doubles but the density remains unchanged. If the loading is kept low 
(high exchange rate), the maximum density is only limited by the ability of the organisms 
to tolerate crowding. As a general rule, assuming good water quality and amenability to 
crowding, the following are suggested as maximum densities for organisms that are spread 
throughout the water column, such as most fish: 
Research: 
0.01-0.1 lb/ft3; 
Production: 1-2 lb/ft3; 
Holding: 
2-5 lb/ft 3. 
The consumption of oxygen by aquatic animals has been studied extensively by physi- 
ologists because it can be used to estimate energy expenditure. The respiration or oxygen 
consumption of aquatic animals is composed of three components 
T = Tstandard --[- Tactivity -3 I- Tsd a 
(2.16) 
where T is total respiration (mg/h per individual), Tstandard is oxygen consumption of an 
unfed and resting animal (mg/h per individual), Tactivity is additional oxygen consumption 
due to swimming or movement (mg/h per individual), Tsda is additional oxygen consumption 
required for digestion, assimilation, and storage of material (mg/h per individual). 
The standard metabolic rate can be determined by extrapolation to zero activity from 
determination of oxygen consumption at various levels of forced activity. The sum of 
Tstandard + Tactivity is the routine metabolic rate and is a measure of the random activity of 
the animal. The routine metabolism of an individual animal may vary more widely than its 
standard metabolic rate. The active metabolic rate is the maximum sustained metabolic rate of 
an animal swimming or moving steadily. Most oxygen consumption studies are conducted on 
unfed animals and measure either the standard or routine metabolic rate. 
The effect of weight on oxygen consumption of aquatic animals has been studied 
extensively. At a given temperature and feeding level (typically a zero feeding rate), the 
oxygen consumption of a single animal is equal to: 
T' = a' W b' 
(2.17) 
where T' is oxygen consumption in mg/h per individual, a' and b' are constants, W is weight 
of animal in grams. 

31 
The oxygen consumption may also be expressed in mg/h per kg biomass basis. Letting 
a = 1000a' and b = b' - 1, Eq. 2.17 can be rewritten as 
T = aW b 
(2.18) 
where T is the oxygen consumption in mg/h per kg. 
Typical values of a and b are presented in Table 2.8 for aquatic species. The value of b 
ranges typically from -0.100 to -0.300. For many species, the value of b is independent of 
temperature and feeding level. 
The value of a depends primarily on temperature, but feeding levels and activity can also 
have significant effects. The impact of temperature on the a value can be modeled as an 
exponential: 
a = ott ~ or T =ott ~ W b 
(2.19) 
where ot and/3 are constants for a specific species and activity level, T is temperature (~ 
When available, values of ot and/3 are presented in Table 2.8. When oxygen consumption 
data were collected at a single temperature, only the a value has been listed. 
The impact of activity level and feeding is much more difficult to estimate. Commonly, the 
maximum oxygen consumption rate of fed fish is twice the standard rate. The average oxygen 
consumption rate of fed fish is about 1.4 the unfed routine rate. The impact of activity depends 
very strongly on species and culture system. For very active fish such as tuna or salmon, the 
active rate can be as high as 10 times the standard rate. 
The metabolic activity of animals depends strongly on size, temperature, and activity level. 
For example, the oxygen consumption of the American lobster (McLeese, 1964) is equal to: 
Oxygen consumption (mg/h per kg) -- 5.52T~ 
-0"120 
(2.20) 
where T is temperature (~ 
and W is wet weight (g). At 12~ 
the oxygen consumption of 10 
kg of 1, 50, and 1000 g lobsters is equal to: 
Size 
Oxygen consumption 
Oxygen consumption 
(g) 
(mg/h per kg) 
(mg/h) 
1 
66 
661 
50 
41 
413 
1000 
19 
192 
Therefore, a given flow of water that would support the oxygen requirements of 10 kg of 
50 g lobsters would also support 22 kg of 1000 g lobsters. 
An alternative approach to the computation of oxygen demand is based on the ingested 
ration. For trout, the average daily oxygen demand (Haskell, 1955; Willoughby, 1968) is 
proportional to the total ration: 
Average daily oxygen demand (lb/d) - OFR • R 
(2.21) 
where OFR is oxygen/feed ratio (lb/lb), R is total ration (lb/d). 
The oxygen requirement to process a given mass of feed depends on animal size, feeding 
rate, composition of the ration, digestibility of the feed components, and moisture content and 
can be described by the oxygen/feed ratio (OFR).

In salmon and trout production systems, OFRs ranging from 0.20 to 0.22 kg oxygen/kg 
wet feed have been reported (Willoughby, 1968; Westers, 1981). In commercial high density 
warm-water fish culture, a value of OFR = 1.00 lb oxygen/lb wet feed is commonly used. 
Limited data are available for OFRs in recycle systems. The oxygen demand from bacterial 
oxidation of organic compounds, ammonia, and solids strongly depends on the unit processes 
and their operation. The upper bound for OFR equals the ultimate biochemical oxygen 
demand (BOD) of the feed, which for channel catfish feed is equal to 1.1 lb O2/lb dry feed 
(Harris, 1971). Careful feeding and rapid removal of solids from the system can significantly 
reduce the OFR. 
The feeding rate is commonly reported in terms the amount of actual feed fed (wet feed 
or on a 'as fed' basis). The feeding rate can also be reported in terms of amount of dry feed. 
Many commercial dry diets contain only 5-8% moisture, so the difference between the wet 
and dry values are small. This is not the case for 'semi-moist' diets (i.e., Oregon moist pellets) 
or diets that are made from unprocessed fish products. In these cases, the moisture content can 
vary from 30 to 90%. It is likely that the feeding rate used in Eq. 2.21 should be based on a 
dry fed basis for semi-moist and moist diets, although specific data are lacking. 
On a daily basis, the maximum oxygen consumption occurs 4 to 6 h following feeding in a 
flow-through system. The peaking factor can be reduced by increasing the number of feedings 
per day. Westers (1981) suggested a peaking factor of 1.44 to account for the maximum daily 
oxygen consumption rate: 
Maximum daily oxygen demand (kg/day) = 1.44 x OFR x R 
(2.22) 
Working with freshwater fish, Piper et al. (1982) popularized an approach to estimating 
stocking density as a function of animal size. This approach is based on a density index (DI) 
which is equal to: 
Biomass (lb) 
DI -- 
(2.23) 
Rearing volume (ft 3) • Total length (inch) 
The units of the DI are lb/(ft 3 • inch). Eq. 2.23 can be rearranged to: 
Density (lb/ft 3) 
DI = 
(2.24) 
Total length (inch) 
or 
Density = DI • Total length 
(2.25) 
For domestic rainbow trout, a DI = 0.50 is commonly used; for anadromous salmon, DI 
values in the range of 0.08 to 0.15 are used. For a DI = 0.50, 2-inch fish could be held at 1 
lb/cf while 8-inch fish could be held at 4 lb/cf. 
For many hatchery fish, the behavioral impacts of density are not a significant problem. 
The density computed from Eq. 2.25 accounts for the impact of size on metabolic activities 
that would occur when the water flow over the production cycle is relatively constant. The 
intrinsic impact of density is much more important for crustaceans and many marine fish, 
especially for small juveniles. Regardless, of these impacts, Eq. 2.25 offers a simple way 
to evaluate the impact of animal size on metabolic carrying capacity. Water reconditioning 
and reuse internal to a flow-through system will raise the carrying capacity. This assumes 

35 
Fig. 2.4. Mass balance relationship for flow-through systems. 
that the water parameters are the limiting factor, which is often but not always the case. It 
is also critical to know the specific limiting water quality parameter, because improving a 
nonlimiting parameter will not have much effect. Predicting the carrying capacity of a system 
with considerable water reuse approaching a closed system is complex and beyond the scope 
of this book (see Appendix C). 
In a flow-through system, flow is needed to supply oxygen and remove ammonia, carbon 
dioxide, soluble organic compounds, uneaten feed, and fecal matter. Typically, the most limit- 
ing water quality parameters are dissolved oxygen, un-ionized ammonia, and carbon dioxide. 
The flow needed to maintain a given water quality criterion can be developed from 
mass-balance considerations. For a given control volume (Fig. 2.4), the mass-balance on a 
single parameter under steady-state conditions (concentration is not changing) is simply: 
in § generation - decay -- out 
(2.26) 
The mass of compound 'x' leaving the control volume is equal to the mass entering, plus 
any generation within the control volume, minus any decay within the control volume. 
The ability to estimate mass (or concentrations) using the mass balance approach depends 
strongly on the complexity of the system and how well the biological and chemical processes 
are understood. Fig. 2.4 has generation of ammonia within the control volume but no decay. 
This is appropriate for a flow-through system where detention times are in the range of 20 to 
60 min, but would be totally invalid in pond systems. 
The following equations are based on typical flow-through systems where gas transfer 
across the air-water or water-bottom surfaces is commonly small and may be neglected 
and the only metabolic loads are from the culture animals. These equations are not valid 
for pond systems because a significant part of the pond's metabolic activity may be from 
algae or bacteria and the gas transfer across the air-water and water-soil interface can not be 
neglected. Modeling of these types of systems is much more complex. 

36 
Application of the mass-balance equation to the system presented in Fig. 2.4 and neglecting 
mass transfer across the air-water and water-substrate interfaces results in the following two 
equations: 
Koxygen • R 
Qoxygen -- DO(in) - DO(out) 
(2.27) 
-ot Kammoni a x R 
Qammonia -- 
(2.28) 
NH3-N(in) - NH3-N(out) 
where Q is flow required to maintain a given oxygen (Qoxygen) and un-ionized ammonia 
criterion (Qammonia), K is production rate per unit of feed for oxygen (Koxygen) and un-ionized 
ammonia (Kammonia), R is total ration, DO is influent (DO(in)) and effluent dissolved oxygen 
concentrations (DO(out)), NH3-N is influent (NH3-N(in)) and effluent un-ionized ammonia 
concentrations (NH3-N(out)), el is mole fraction of un-ionized ammonia. 
The values of DO(out) and NH3-N(out) are set to the water quality criteria for the specific 
species under consideration. Values of Koxygen and Kammoni a are typically in the range of 
200 and 30 g/kg of feed, respectively. Typically, the influent concentrations of ammonia in 
nearshore waters are small and can be neglected. Based on the above assumptions and unit 
selections of lpm for Q, kg/day for R, and rag/1 for all concentrations, Eqs. 2.27 and 2.28 can 
be written as: 
0.694 x SFoxygen • Koxygen • R

DO(in) - DO(out)

A safety factor (SF) term has been added to each equation. The K values are based on daily 
averages. This safety factor is used to adjust the flow requirement for periods of higher than 
average metabolic activity. The instantaneous K values can range from 0.5 to 3.0 (or larger) 
depending on feeding or other activities. The maximum K values for active fish such as tuna 
or striped bass may range as high as 10 times the average value. For typical fish, a SF of 2 is 
probably adequate. For less active crustaceans or mollusks, a value of 1.25 is suggested. For 
large systems, this safety factor can represent a significant cost and pilot-scale determination 
may be prudent. 
A similar equation could be written for carbon dioxide. When oxygen is not limiting, 
the consumption of 1 mole of oxygen produces approximately 1 mole of carbon dioxide 
(1.375 mg carbon dioxide per mg oxygen). Under normal surface water carbon dioxide 
concentrations (< 1 mg/1) and common loadings, carbon dioxide is rarely limiting. This may 
not be true if deep ground waters and/or pure oxygen aeration are used. Carbon dioxide 
does have a significant impact on flow requirements due to its impact on pH and un-ionized 
ammonia concentrations. 
Eqs. 2.29 and 2.30 can be used to estimate water requirements to maintain oxygen and 
un-ionized ammonia concentrations for a specific species under conditions typical of common 
flow-through marine culture systems. The water flow estimates will depend strongly on the wa- 
ter criteria values selected. The actual design requirement will be the largest of the two flows.

Fig. 2.5. Reuse ratio (RRoxygen/ammonia) as function of pH and temperature. Based on Koxygen = 200 g/kg, 
Kammonia = 30 g/kg, NH3-Nout -- 10 Ixg/1, DOin -- saturation, DOout -- 6 mg/1 and salinity of 35 g/kg. Note that 
between 32 ~ and 33~ 
the reuse ratio is equal to zero because DOin < 6.00 mg/1. 
For general design considerations, it is also useful to consider the reuse ratio: 
Qoxygen 
(2.31) 
RRammonia/oxygen -- Oammonia 
If the reuse ratio is below one (Eq. 2.31), the maximum allowable ammonia concentration 
has already been reached and aeration will not help. The reuse ratio for typically marine 
conditions (salinity of 35 g/kg) is presented in Fig. 2.5 as a function of pH and temperature. 
The reuse ratio decreases as the pH increases due to the increase in the mole fraction of 
un-ionized ammonia. At a given pH, the reuse ratio first decreases as temperature is increased, 
then increases as the temperature increases above 20~ 
Over typical pHs and temperatures, 
the reuse ratio varies from 2 to 3, so aeration can often increase the carrying capacity. Above 
25~ the reuse ratio rapidly increases, but the actual carrying capacity is decreasing because 
the available DO is rapidly decreasing. Above 32~ 
the reuse ratio is zero because influent 
DO is less than the DO criteria. 
In general, Eq. 2.30 will over-estimate the flows needed to maintain the required un-ionized 
ammonia concentration. This is due to chemical reactions of metabolic carbon dioxide in 

38 
water and the impacts of metabolic carbon dioxide on pH and un-ionized ammonia. The 
mole fraction of ammonia (c~ in Eq. 2.30) depends strongly on pH. If the metabolic carbon 
dioxide excreted by the animal reduces the pH, Eq. 2.30 will significantly over-estimate the 
value of Qammonia. The impact of these two factors on the required flows depends strongly on 
the amount of carbon dioxide retained in the water (under normal pHs, negligible ammonia 
(NH3) is lost to the atmosphere). Compared to oxygen, carbon dioxide is a very soluble 
gas and is much more difficult to remove by aeration. To accurately predict the impact of 
metabolic carbon dioxide on water requirements, it is necessary to estimate carbon dioxide 
losses to the atmosphere across the water surface (due to aeration or other processes). Limited 
information is available on the transfer of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere under marine 
culturing conditions. As a result, this book will neglect all reactions of carbon dioxide in 
water. This is equivalent to assuming that pH is constant and carbon dioxide gas is an inert 
gas. For more information on the impact of metabolic carbon on water chemistry and water 
flow, see Colt and Orwicz (1991 a). 
While the reuse ratio increases at high temperatures, the actual carrying capacity decreases. 
This is better demonstrated by looking at the total amount of dissolved oxygen that can be 
used before the un-ionized ammonia criterion is exceeded. Assuming that the influent water 
is saturated and the effluent DO concentration is a minimum of 6.00 mg/1, the maximum 
available oxygen to the animals ranges from 4.107 mg//1 at 5~ 
to 0.236 mg/1 at 30~ 
(Fig. 2.6). Even though the reuse ratio is higher at 30~ than at 5~ 
the potential available 
dissolved oxygen is less. 
If the oxygen consumption rate of the culture animal is known, the loading rate can 
be computed. The loading rate will depend on dissolved oxygen and un-ionized ammonia 
criteria, temperature, and size of animals. Guidelines for maximum loadings are presented 
for holding (Fig. 2.7A), production (Fig. 2.7B), and research (Fig. 2.7C) conditions. For 
holding conditions, aeration can increase the loading rate. For production conditions, it has 
been assumed that aeration will be used. The maximum loading for unaerated production 
conditions is typically 50 to 60% of the aerated values but falls off significantly above about 
25~ 
For research conditions, maximum loading is controlled by the ammonia criteria and 
aeration will have no effect on loading. Note that the recommended maximum loading is 
higher for large animals and at low temperature. In the absence of more specific loading 
criteria, this information can be used in system design. While these recommended loadings 
should, in most circumstances, be conservative, they should still be used with caution. 
The loading rates in Fig. 2.7 are significantly less than under freshwater conditions, 
primarily due to the high pH of seawater increasing the toxicity of un-ionized ammonia. 
Depending on the pH, temperature, and water quality criteria, un-ionized ammonia is often 
the most limiting parameter and when this limit is reached aeration cannot be used to increase 
carrying capacity. In fact, above 20~ 
only 1-2 mg/1 of dissolved oxygen can be used before 
the un-ionized ammonia criterion is exceeded (Fig. 2.6). Increasing the loading above these 
somewhat arbitrary numbers results in rapidly increasing risk. The given values assume good 
conditions but no internal water reconditioning and may represent the carrying capacity of 
even a reuse system, whose water reconditioning has either mechanically or biologically 
failed. Earlier life stages are usually much more demanding on water quality and quantity then 
juveniles and adults and this must be considered when using data such as Fig. 2.7 in hatchery 
applications (see Example 2.9 for production and Example 2.10 for holding). Except as an

emergency measure, it would also be unwise to initially plan to use a seawater system at its 
maximum capacity until experience is acquired with the system. 
A great deal remains to be learned about water quality and water reconditioning. Success 
with heavily loaded systems is in many ways an art. The best policy for high water reuse or 
recycling systems is not to exceed very conservative limits, unless one is very experienced, is 
researching such questions or enjoys high risk. 
In those cases where little is known about the effects of ammonia on growth or mortality, 
chronic bioassays may be needed to develop design loading information (Meade, 1988). These 
tests are expensive but will allow optimum design and should be cost effective in the long-run, 
especially for large commercially oriented culture systems. 
2.9 Design requirements 
Design is based on the loading criteria, density criteria, and production objectives. The 
most important design parameters to be computed in the design phase are the water flow rate, 
rearing volume (or area) for each step, and the size and number of individual rearing units.

Dissolved oxygen for inflow assumed at saturation and discharge at 6.0 mg/1. Oxygen consumption is assumed 
equal to that for a fed rainbow trout for production and research and an unfed trout for holding. Ammonia criterion 
for holding is 40 Ixg/1, for production 10 Ixg/1, and for research 2 Ixg/1. The dashed lines are used in Examples 2.9 
and 2.10. These guidelines should be used with caution and only in the absence of data more relevant to the species 
or conditions.

Given the loading requirements and number of animals at the start of each culture step, the 
water flow rates for each culture step can be computed. If some of the tanks are to be filled, it 
is important to compute the maximum water requirement that may occur when everything is 
'on' and cleaning and tank filling is also in progress.

2.9.2 Rearing Volume/Area 
Based on the density criteria and the total number of animals at the start of each culture 
step, the total volume (or total area) is computed for that culture step. If the animals spawn 
only once a year or fry are available only during a limited period, it may be prudent to size 
equipment and capacity based on the needs of this surge period. 

43 
Example 2.9. Carrying capacity m production 
One thousand pounds of fish are kept in a flow-through system at 12~ 
pH of 8.2, salinity of 35 g/kg (ppt) 
and a maximum ammonia criterion of 10 Ixg/1NH3-N. Compute the required water flow needed for 10 and 
1000 g animals. How much more water is needed if the temperature increases to 25~

2.9.3 Rearing Container Size and Number 
While the volume or area needed can be directly computed, the size of the individual 
rearing unit can vary widely. A small number of large units are often cheaper to purchase 
than a large number of small units of the same total capacity. On the other hand, smaller units 
are easier to monitor and manage. In many systems, the number of individual units will be 
determined by the intended use or application. Often individual unit size will be determined 
by the optimum batch size as determined by production objectives and timing. 
2.10 Constraints 
While the bioengineer's solution to providing a successful low risk system is excellent input 
water quality and quantity coupled with very conservative density and loading of the system, 
there are many realistic constraints to this approach. The influent water quality parameters may 
not always be within the desired limits and the water may have to be treated before use. This 
creates costs which are proportional to the flow rate, degree of treatment specified, and risk of 
equipment failures. The limiting environmental parameters that can be controlled to increase 
system performance or reduce risk may vary depending on season and culture conditions. The 

44 
Example 2.10. Minimum required flow m holding 
It is desired to hold 2560 one-pound lobsters at 10~ without aeration for several weeks. What is the 
minimum required flow rate in gpm? 
This is a holding situation. Therefore, Fig. 2.7A applies. From the figure, one pound (454 g) animals held 
without aeration at the stated temperature have a maximum recommended loading of 3.0 kg/lpm. 
Biomass of animals = (2560 animals)(0.454 kg/lb) = 1162 kg 
Flow rate x Loading rate -- Biomass of animals -- 1162 kg

The conversion factor is from Appendix Table A-1. 
This is the minimum flow rate and should be used with caution as there are many inherent assumptions in 
Fig. 2.7 and in the problem statement. Using flow rates in excess of the minimum will often reduce risks. 
problem is most acute where there are economic limits on initial cost or profitability. The 
problem then becomes a tradeoff between treatment level, with associated cost and equipment 
reliability, and reduced growth and increased stress (risk) to the culture organisms without 
treatment. While retaining conservative loading is rarely a problem in educational or research 
systems, loading is often a critical factor in commercial systems. Overly conservative values 
may make the system economically unattractive. There are strong economic incentives in 
commercial systems to minimizing the water treatment quantity and quality (front end capital) 
and maximizing the loading of the system. In the inevitable absence of sufficient directly 
relevant hard data, the resulting evaluation and tradeoff of anticipated system performance 
versus risks is difficult and usually highly subjective. What is often forgotten, or at least 
minimized, is that most system parameters are interrelated and that pushing the limits on more 
than one variable at a time generally produces unfavorable interactions resulting in multiple 
sources of increased stress on the organisms. Unfortunately, quantitative cost factors usually 
dominate over subjective consideration of risk. If the decisions reached are overly optimistic, 
the resulting high risk operations often exhibit reduced growth rate, susceptibility to disease, 
increased cannibalism and frequent mass mortalities. 
Under most situations, input water parameters are very unlikely to be at optimum values 
at all times. A major problem is in determining the costs versus benefits of regulating these 
parameters and compensating for these naturally occurring deficiencies. Seawater processing 
equipment can be expensive to buy and maintain and quantitative requirements in these areas 
need careful evaluation. While the same types of equipment might also be useful for internal 
water reconditioning, the two functions should, at least initially, be considered separately. Ad- 
ditional information, including considerations and more specific tradeoffs are presented later. 
Since seawater processing equipment is expensive, a common approach is to initially 
install only the minimum necessary to meet specific short-term needs. However, the initial 
design can be made sufficiently flexible to enable the easy retrofit of new types, higher 
performance, or larger-scale equipment to meet future needs or changing priorities. Without 
this early foresight, later retrofit may be very expensive or even prohibitive. This added 

45 
flexibility is not necessarily very expensive and in most cases requires only the crudest idea of 
future requirements. However, providing flexibility and preserving future options does involve 
costs and can be over done. The major considerations are easy access to seawater lines in 
appropriate places, spare floor space, floor drains and access to power. Additional flexibility 
can be acquired by not burying pipes, and by using threaded or flanged connections in piping, 
facilitating future reconfiguration of the piping system. 
In summary, considerable care should be exercised in the quantitative statement of 're- 
quirements' for seawater systems involving living organisms. In particular, careful evaluations 
are needed of cost/benefit/risk tradeoffs for each specific application. Special care should be 
taken in differentiating between short-term and long-term requirements. In many applications, 
short-term requirements are readily quantifiable but are usually subject to frequent change and 
are often of peripheral importance. Long-term requirements are often more difficult to define 
but are usually of a more fundamental nature.

Chapter 3 
Site Considerations 
3.1 Marine conditions 
Ideally, the site should be selected by means of a thorough site reconnaissance and selection 
process (Webber, 1971; New, 1975). Some of the important selection parameters are listed in 
Table 3.1. In many private and public projects the site selection process is very abbreviated 
because the site options are either few or the site is already determined at the start. In public 
sector projects, it may be necessary to complete a formal selection process to justify the site 
picked, but in reality, the site has already been selected. This site may already be owned by the 
project owners (or good old Uncle Fred), or may be dictated by legal, political or economic 
reasons. Trying to design a system for a site chosen for reasons independent of seawater 
system requirements may prove to be very expensive or even impossible. While there is never 
an ideal site, a bad site can easily doom a project. 
Prior to the start of the design phase, basic information is needed on the marine conditions 
at the site. Seawater systems design requires detailed information on the tidal variations, 
including both high and low tidal information. The astronomical tides are due to the rotation 
of the earth, moon, and sun. These tides can be accurately predicted and detailed tidal 
predictions are available for major ports. Tides for other sites close to the reference station can 
be estimated by published tidal differences in elevation and time. The tables are only good for 
the published times. Typically, there are two high tides and two low tides per day. The height 
of the two daily tides may be equal or unequal. Some areas only have a single tidal cycle per 
day (one high and one low tide per day). The average interval between two successive high 
tides or between two successive low tides is 12 h and 25 min. 
In working with tides, it is important to clearly define the datum with which all tidal 
elevations are referenced. At least three datums are commonly used in tidal information: 
mean sea level (MSL), National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) and the chart datum (see 
Fig. 3.1). In general, computation of mean sea level, chart datum, and other tidal parameters 
requires long-term tidal data, commonly 19 years. Some of the most important tidal datums 
and parameters are defined below. 
Mean sea level (MSL). This is the average hourly tidal heights over a 19-year period. On a 
global basis, sea level is rising approximately 0.50 ft/century. 
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). This is a fixed surface whose elevation does not 
vary with time. Due to elevation changes in sea level and land surface, differences between 
MSL and NGVD in the U.S. range from -1.90 to +2.33 ft (Harris, 1981a). Elevations on 
land are usually based on NGVD. 
Chart datum. Predicted tidal heights and chart soundings are referred to the chart datum. The 
chart datum is selected so that most tidal elevations are positive. In the U.S., either MLW

In the U.S., tidal data are collected and tabulated by the National Ocean Survey (NOS). 
This agency maintains a running summary of the monthly mean and extreme high and low 
water of the month, and many other tidal statistics for approximately 50 reference stations 
(Harris, 1981 a) (see Table 3.2). This information is available at a nominal charge. 
A wide variety of tidal information may be needed in the design process. Depending on the 
type of intake and pumping cycle, detailed information may be needed on both the high and 
low tides at the site. The design of the intake, pumping system, and vertical location of the 
pumps will be strongly influenced by the tidal conditions. Ideally, the detailed information on 
the distribution of the high and low tides should be used to define the tide in a probabilistic 
manner. Detailed probability density distribution tables have been developed for seven tidal 
parameters for 50 sites in the U.S. (Harris, 1981 a) and include the following parameters: 
(1) extreme monthly high water; 
(2) extreme monthly low water; 
(3) highest high water; 
(4) high water; 
(5) hourly water levels; 
(6) low water; 
(7) lower low water. 
The tidal height corresponding to a desired probability can be simply interpolated from 
the appropriate table. Once the design tidal height is determined at the reference station, the 
design tidal height at the closest secondary station (listed in the tide tables) can be adjusted 
by use of the published tidal height difference for the station. The accuracy of this adjusted 
value to the actual site under consideration may depend strongly on the water depth and 
configuration of the coastline. 
For design of the pumping and intake system, a 1% probability level might be used. If 
the system was designed to be operable down to the 1% low tide, in an area with two

Computed datums, extremes, and standard deviations referenced to mean sea level. Extreme values are highest and 
lowest ever recorded. U.S. data from Harris (1981 a). All values are in feet. 
daily tides this would correspond to approximately 7 tidal cycles/year when the system 
would not be operable. In choosing the design probability level, decreasing these periods 
of inoperability may, depending on conditions, result in significantly increased construction 
costs. For example, costs of providing storage or curtailing operations for the 7 tides/year 
when the intake system will not operate may be cheaper than designing the system to operate 
for the extra 7 tidal cycles/year. Under other conditions, it may be just as easy to design 
the pump station to withstand the 0.01% tidal level (one down time every 27 years). These 
considerations will tend to be more critical for areas with high tidal ranges. 
In most locations, detailed probability information on tides will not be available. Tidal data 
do not form a normal distribution and interpolations of data can be difficult and misleading. 

51 
It is still necessary for design and operations to develop maximum and minimum tidal 
elevations. In the absence of good tidal data, the following procedure is recommended: 
Design low tide = MLLW- 
(mean tidal range)/C 
(3.1) 
Design high tide = MHHW + (mean tidal range)/C 
(3.2) 
A value of C = 4 is recommended for intakes and a C = 2 for more critical elevations 
such as for pump stations, electrical components and rearing units. For most conditions, this 
procedure will yield conservative results. However, it does not account for rare extreme events 
such as typhoons, hurricanes, and tsunamis (see Example 3.1 for a numerical example). Where 
very expensive or critical facilities are involved, more detailed site specific analysis may be 
prudent. 
The effects of barometric pressure and wind are much more difficult to precisely predict. 
These two components must be added to the astronomical produced tides. The barometric 
component may exhibit a seasonal pattern which is included in tidal data, but these two factors 
are much more significant in relationship to major storms. Tides caused by major infrequent 
storms can be critical. 
Extreme high water levels commonly result when (1) high astronomical tides and strong 
inshore winds occur simultaneously, or (2) major tropical weather events occur. These events 
occur randomly and the fact that a severe tidal event has not occurred in the last 20, 30, or 40 
years does not preclude two serious floods occurring in the next year. 
Example 3.1. Determination of design tide 
It is desired to build a culturing facility on the seashore near Atlantic City, NJ. What are the design tide 
elevations for normal operations for the intakes and facility components nearest to the water edge? Atlantic 
City tidal data can be acquired from Table 3.2 and design tide values calculated from Eqs. 3.1 and 3.2. 
MHHW = +2.41 ft (from Table 3.2) 
MLLW = -2.18 ft (from Table 3.2) 
Mean tidal range -- 2.41 + 2.18 = 4.59 ft 
(A) Using Eqs. 3.1 and 3.2 for the intakes: 
Design low tide = -2.18 - 4.59/4 -- -3.33 ft 
Design high tide = +2.41 + 4.59/4 = +3.56 ft 
(B) Using Eqs. 3.1 and 3.2 for the facility: 
Design low tide = -2.18 - 4.59/2 = -4.48 ft 
Design high tide -- +2.41 + 4.59/2 = +4.71 ft 
These values are all relative to mean sea level and tend to be conservative. A more detailed analysis using the 
probability functions of 1% and 99% yields -3.25 and +3.31 ft for the intakes and -4.12 ft and +3.45 ft for 
the facility. Note that the extremes of record at the site are -6.0 ft and 7.4 ft. This analysis accounts for 
seasonal weather factors but not rare extreme events, such as hurricanes, which must also be considered in 
placing components.

Winter Fetch

Fig. 3.2. Ocean exposure example. This example is of a relatively well sheltered site. Waves generated by prevailing 
winds in summer and winter will be relatively modest in size due to the short distances (fetch) the winds have 
available for generating waves. However, major storms coming up from the south may generate impressive waves 
coming in from the exposed south and southeast. These waves and their effects will be maximized if the site is 
actually hit by the northeast (for example on the east coast of the U.S.) quadrant of the storm due to its forward 
wind speed combined with the storm speed and general counter-clockwise rotation. 
For extreme storm events, it is necessary to be able to predict both the peak surges and the 
wave run-up (how far up the beach the waves will climb). Wave run-up can result in physical 
damage to buildings or more commonly erosion of the foundation and total building collapse. 
The surge and run-up can be computed from the storm track, intensity, size, and forward speed 
(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1975; Taylor, 1980). In many coastal areas, 100-year flood 
maps have been prepared by the National Flood Insurance Program (Fry and Rhodes, 1985). 
The prevailing seasonal wind directions and speeds should be obtained from local weather 
stations or published data and plotted on a hydrographic chart of the area. The greatest length 
of unobstructed length of sea over which the wind can blow is called the fetch (Fig. 3.2). 
The hydrological and meteorological conditions will determine the height and frequency of 
normal seasonal wind generated waves. Storm directions and associated wind velocities can 
be very different from prevailing seasonal wind directions and velocities. Since wave forces 
and wave effects associated with rare storms are usually the biggest threat to intakes, pump 
stations and other shore-side facilities, it is important to quantify these waves and their effects 
(see Section 5.3). 
Information on the beach profile is needed for specifying the burial depths for piping and 
locating the intakes (see Section 5.3). Beach profiles should be collected at least four times

Fig. 3.3. Typical beach profile characteristics. Beach profiles can vary considerably. This figure shows some of the 
common features that may exist and possible seasonal changes for a typical 6 ft (2 m) tide. Additional features 
might include a scarp (sharp drop) in the beach above the normal high tide, an alongshore trough below low tide or 
an alongshore bar further out. Single events, such as major storms, can substantially alter beach profiles. 
over a year, to get seasonal variations caused by changes in weather patterns and seasonal 
storms (Fig. 3.3). A longer period of observation would be even better. Beach profiles can 
be variable and depend on soil characteristics and oceanographic conditions and are dynamic 
in nature (Shepard, 1963). The profile should be extended to at least 10 ft or 3 m below 
the extreme low tide elevation, preferably deeper. The average slope of the off-shore bottom 
should be estimated from published charts. 
The salinity and temperature of the ocean water should be determined at least four times 
over the year. Other parameters that may also be required are presented in Chapter 2. For sites 
on coastal rivers or estuaries, it may be necessary to sample over the full tidal cycle as both 
temperature and salinity may vary widely. If the facility is near any rivers, special care must 
be directed towards determination of the salinity during the rainy season or during periods of 
maximum run-off. River effects may vary considerably from year to year, so long-term data 
are very desirable. Rainy season salinities may be so low or uncertain as to make the site 
unacceptable. 
If the site is located close to present or prior industrial and agricultural activities, detailed 
chemical analysis of soil and groundwater may be required. If a site has previously been used 
in agriculture, possible residues from past use of herbicides, insecticides and other chemicals 
could be important, especially if there are to be earthen ponds. In cases of questionable water 
quality, it may be necessary to test the water by bioassaying with target species or determine 
residues in native animals or plants. 
During site survey, information on quality and quantities of freshwater available near the 
site must also be collected. This can become critical if freshwater is required to control salinity. 
Evaporation during dry seasons or larval culture needs may require continual freshwater input 
to reduce salinity to acceptable levels. Some freshwater will also be needed for washing, 
laboratory use, or drinking. Hauling of freshwater or production by reverse osmosis is both 
expensive and troublesome. Freshwater requirements of 'marine' systems have often resulted 
in the elimination of otherwise attractive sites. 

54 
3.2 Terrestrial conditions 
Prior to the start of any serious design work, the property should be surveyed and all 
corners and sidelines clearly marked. It may also be prudent to establish permanent comer 
markers with concrete and steel. Unless the site is clearly within the property boundaries, it 
may be necessary to use registered surveyors so that there is a legal basis for any property 
disputes. It is also desirable to bring a vertical datum from the nearest benchmark. In sites 
where it is prohibitively expensive to survey in a vertical datum, comparison of observed 
and predicted tides may allow a rough estimate of mean sea level. A permanent vertical 
benchmark should be established nearby. A topographic survey of the potential site must also 
be completed as part of the property survey. 
In areas with low bearing strength soils, detailed soil testing may be required. Having 
to provide extensive filling and compaction can significantly increase the cost of site 
development. Soil permeabilities can be important factors for seawater or freshwater wells 
and if natural soils are to be used to seal ponds or raceways. 
3.3 Permitting 
Major commitment of time and money may be required to obtain all the necessary permits 
for a marine or estuarine project. Permitting problems have increased substantially in the 
past decade. The actual cost of the permits themselves is typically low. The major costs 
are associated with the man hours that must be directed towards obtaining the permits, and 
possible delays to the project as a result of permitting complications. Permitting can easily be 
a long lead time item, requiting submissions very early in the design process. It is possible to 
spend years and thousand of dollars on permits, only to have the last agency refuse to grant 
approval. 
The number of permits required will depend on (1) the country, state, and county where the 
project is located, (2) the type of agency proposing the project (government, company, private 
individual), (3) the year the process was started, (4) the ownership of the site, (5) the organism 
to be maintained or cultured, and (6) the project characteristics. 
The construction and operation of a seawater system must be consistent with local county 
or city zoning. A specific seawater system may be classed as agriculture, fisheries, education, 
or some other industrial operation. An unfavorable ruling on zoning can eliminate many 
potential sites. Very often, the acquisition and use of land for a seawater facility is a new 
use not contemplated by zoning authorities and not designated under the guidelines of a local 
master plan (Wypyszinski, 1984). Therefore, it may be necessary to obtain a variance or an 
amendment to the zoning code, which can be difficult and time consuming. 
In many coastal areas of the U.S., Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) have been 
developed by the National Flood Insurance Program (Fry and Rhodes, 1985). Areas covered 
by FIRMs are classified from high to minimal flood hazard. Construction in high hazard areas 
will be restricted or limited to structures built above the flood line of the 100-year storm. 
In the United States, the Federal Government passed the Coastal Zone Management Act 
(CZMA) in 1972 and established a system of federal grants as incentives for individual states 
to develop enforceable programs for land and water use planning in the coastal zone. The 
coastal zone includes just about all possible sites that may need a seawater system. Installation 

55 
of new facilities or construction in the coastal zone will require a water development 
permit and require detailed engineering drawings. Permit applications may require a formal 
environmental impact statement. An archeological survey may also be required. Evidence 
of old buildings or native American activities may seriously constrain facility layout on a 
site. 
In developed countries, other than the U.S., the details will vary but the nature of the 
problems is very similar. Even in third world countries, considerable attention will be focused 
on possible environmental impacts. The days when large coastal areas could be bulldozed into 
ponds and mangrove swamps destroyed without any questions are over. 
Generally, anyone seeking to raise or hold freshwater, marine, or anadromous animals 
must apply for an aquaculture permit from a state fish and game agency for a nominal 
fee. The species to be cultured must be listed on the permit. As long as commonly reared 
indigenous species are cultured, this type of permit is sometimes simple and straightforward 
to obtain. Exceptions can exist when the culture species is a 'game' animal and possession of 
under-sized specimens or holding 'out of season' is illegal. If game and conservation laws are 
interpreted to apply to culturists, this can doom projects. Problems are also aggravated when 
dealing with exotic species, which have to be brought in from somewhere else. Acquiring 
permits to import, even between adjacent counties and states, can be difficult. Possible 
ecological impacts, escapes, and disease and parasite transmission to indigenous species may 
become significant issues. 
The discharge of waters from aquaculture projects are regulated by the Environmental 
Protection Agency through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) 
and generally administrated by the states. An application for a discharge permit must be filed 
before the pollutants are discharged. Certain types of aquaculture facilities may be exempted, 
but most agencies will make a case-by-case ruling. Exemptions are much less likely today 
than they were in the past. The following factors may be considered in the designation of an 
exempted facility. 
(!) The location and quality of the receiving waters. 
(2) The holding, feeding, and production capacities of the facility. 
(3) The quantity and nature of the pollutants from the facility. 
(4) Other factors relating to the significance of the pollution problems in the area. 
NPDES permit applications may require a definition of a proposed facilities effluent waste 
stream. Common parameters that may need to be specified include BOD, solids (settleable and 
suspended), nitrogen and phosphorus loading, and residual chlorine (if applicable). Necessary 
input data include design biomass, anticipated feed type and feeding schedule (% body weight 
per day) and species-specific waste generation numbers. Unfortunately, waste generation data 
on many aquatic species are not presently available. Numbers can be extrapolated from 
trout/salmon (Liao, 1970; Clark et al., 1985; Seymour and Bergheim, 1991) or catfish data 
(Chen, 1998). Trout and salmon could be considered representative of high animal protein 
users, while catfish would be more typical of low protein users. Additional data exist for seed 
clams (Pfeiffer et al., 1999) and adult clams (Zhu et al., 1999). Another possibility is the 
use of 'rules of thumb', such as one pound of feed generates 0.03 pounds of ammonia, 0.5 
pounds of fecal matter, and 0.4 pounds of BOD. For some applications waste generation data 
from terrestrial animals may be useable. There are a lot of data on farm animals. However, it 

56 
may be surprising that there is information on the waste generation of Bengal tigers but none 
currently available for seals. 
In aquaculture facilities, simple removal of settleable solids may be the only type of 
treatment required to achieve discharge standards (Federal Register, 1978; Harris, 1981b). 
This is equivalent to the 'primary treatment' process in municipal wastewater treatment. 
Information on the types and quantities of drugs and chemicals to be used in the facility may 
also be requested. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is currently reviewing NPDES 
regulations for aquaculture facilities. While the final regulations have not been drafted, 
possible changes to the regulations may include use of best available technology for treatment 
of discharges and regulation of pathogens in discharges. 
Construction in navigable water requires a permit from the U.S. Corps of Engineers. 
The definition of 'navigable waters' includes the ocean, tidal rivers, and just about any 
water connected to or within 20 miles of the ocean. Regulated activities include construction 
of intake and discharge lines, pilings, piers or dikes. A permit submitted to the Corps of 
Engineers may be reviewed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, state fish and game 
agency, National Park Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, Coast Guard, coastal zone 
management agency, and the EPA. If one of these agencies objects, the Corps will seek 
project modification from the applicant. The Corps requires that all other permits must be 
obtained before the Corps will process an application (Bowden, 1981). This makes the Corps 
of Engineers the last step in the permitting process in marine or estuarine areas. 
When permits are finally issued, they may contain specific restrictions that may have major 
impacts on design, construction, and/or operation of aquaculture facilities. These restrictions 
could be on effluent parameters, pipe intake/discharge placement or the timing of activities. 
In some areas, in-water construction is only allowed when it is difficult to impossible to carry 
out such work, such as during the winter. This restriction may be due to a possible negative 
impact on migration or spawning of aquatic or terrestrial species that occur during specific 
time periods. 
Many of the permit fees and monitoring requirements are based at least in part on effluent 
flow. A relatively small laboratory or commercial operation can have a flow similar to a 
small town. An effluent flow of 500 gpm (1900 lpm) corresponds to the wastewater from a 
town of about 7000 people. Municipalities, however, have a considerably greater ability to 
pay for permits, monitoring, and reporting activities than aquaculture and research projects. 
The costs of water quality monitoring can be very significant, especially if nutrient analysis 
is required. The mandated administrative aspects of keeping record and reporting can also 
become burdensome. These problems are increasing with time. 
3.4 Site selection 
Many considerations have been mentioned as being important in evaluating sites. However, 
all factors are not of the same relative importance. No site is ever perfect in all regards. So 
how does one select one site among a selection of useable sites. It has to be assumed that all 
the choices are 'possible' and without any major 'red flags' (problems of sufficient severity 
that, if not resolved, can doom a project). Picking a site with 'red flag' items is a very fast, 
and unfortunately not uncommon, fatal mistake. Schedule or funding considerations or wild 
optimism can sometimes force such a serious premature decision. A common variation on 

57 
this problem is that there is only one site being considered and it has serious 'red flag' items. 
Going ahead, while assuming that these problems will be resolved in time or go away, is often 
fatal to the project. 
Site selection is a critical decision and, unfortunately, often has a high subjective content. 
One approach that can be useful in clarifying choices and in decision making is shown 
in Example 3.2. In this example, important factors are listed. Some are positive factors 
(i.e., good water quality) and some are good in the negative (i.e., lack of archaeological 
sites). Relative subjective weighing factors can be assumed based on the project's objectives, 
proposed scale of application and technical approach. This evaluation method, and a number 
of similar variations, is helpful in eliminating obviously less desirable sites but should be used 
with considerable caution if the numbers are close. As in this example, water quality and 
quantity tend to be the key considerations. This is not uncommon, especially in predominately 
flow-through systems. 
If, as sometimes happens, there are no suitable sites, this requires a basic rethinking about 
project objectives, assumptions and approaches. With basic changes, there may be a suitable 
site. Site problems involving suitable water quantity and quality and sometimes coupled with 
area limitations, have been a big factor in the increasing interest in reuse systems. 
Example 3.2. Site evaluation and selection 
Four sites (numbered 1 to 4) are to be evaluated for shrimp culturing using pond grow-out. Each site is 
graded on a 1-5 scale (5 is best) for 13 considerations. The importance of each consideration is adjusted by 
the use of a weighing factor (1-10). The overall score for each factor is equal to the weighing factor times

Seawater Sources 
4.1 Options and considerations 
If a seawater supply is needed for the system, there are only three possible sources. The 
three sources are artificial seawater, a seawater well, and an ocean or estuarine intake. This 
supply may be needed continuously, for just a part of each day, only during certain seasons, or 
in batches at intervals. Artificial seawater is used mostly for small aquariums, research projects 
that need a highly repeatable and predictable seawater source, or inland systems where there 
is little choice. If large quantities of seawater are required at an inland site, a closed system 
will be needed. The advantages of artificial seawater are a defined composition with a reduced 
risk of chemical and biological contamination, but this risk is not zero. Artificial seawater 
systems often work quite well, especially if operated very conservatively. However, for some 
specialized applications, such as the hatchery phases of delicate organisms, there may be some 
problems due to the complex interactions of seawater and marine organisms which are not 
presently completely understood. 
Seawater wells are another option (Clark and Eisler, 1964; Cransdale, 1981). Their 
advantage is that the water is already filtered, reducing or eliminating the introduction of 
disease microorganisms, parasites and predators. In addition, diurnal and seasonal water 
temperature variations are damped out resulting in much greater temperature stability and 
predictability (Cransdale, 1981). In-ground temperatures down to 50 ft below the surface are 
usually fairly constant and very close to the yearly mean average air temperature for the site. 
If seawater is withdrawn from this zone, it will be at ground temperature. Depending on 
the biological requirements, this may greatly reduce system complexity and cost by reducing 
needed water processing equipment, such as filters, disinfection and heating equipment. 
The big problem with seawater wells is that the site conditions and geology are usually 
unfavorable. In addition, high flow requirements can prove difficult and expensive, even where 
the geology is favorable. 
By far the most common source of seawater is from shore side or offshore intakes. The 
water may be drawn from a sump constructed on a very protected shore or canal, or from 
behind a dike or berm with a large-diameter pipe connecting it to the sea. Intakes can be 
suspended from a dock or pier with the pumps immediately above on the pier. Where there 
is a suitable dock and conditions permit, this is a very desirable approach. The seawater 
lines can be run to shore along the side or even under the dock. The seaward section of the 
seawater system tends to be relatively inexpensive and everything including the intakes are 
easily accessible for maintenance. However, the intake pipes hanging down from the pier may 
be subject to ice and wave damage and the presence of treated wooden pilings and boats 
may create potential water quality problems. A variation is intakes suspended from a floating 

60 
platform which also holds the pumps. The platform is often moored to a pier providing both 
access and power. This approach may be particularly attractive for seasonal systems or if there 
is a large tidal range, which otherwise might seriously complicate pump placement, selection 
and operations due to excessive suction lift. Like the pumps on the pier, this approach tends 
to have easy access for maintenance and to be relatively inexpensive. However, such floating 
platforms can be very susceptible to ice damage, boat collisions, and waves and currents from 
major storms. 
Alternatively the water may be drawn from a pipe leading to an offshore submerged 
intake. Submerged intakes, while the most common type, are often very expensive to install 
and maintain, and are still somewhat vulnerable to damage by major storms, boat traffic 
and fishing gear. While there are many complex considerations (see Section 4.4), there is 
also considerable prior experience with such intakes in culturing systems. In all cases, the 
input water quality will be subject to all the diurnal and seasonal variations of the natural 
environment. 
Drawing seawater in batches and trucking it to a distant seawater system is sometimes used 
as a cheaper substitute for artificial seawater. The intake, in this case, may be simply dropping 
an intake hose from a tank truck over the side of a dock. This approach can work but if, as 
commonly occurs, the water quantity requirements prove greater than originally planned, it 
can be expensive, annoying and time consuming. Some variation of this approach is often used 
for systems that bioassay industrial waste effluents, drugs or chemicals on indicator marine 
organisms. Due to potential and often unknown toxicity, these systems are required to be 
completely disconnected from any seawater system. Post-use seawater processing, handling 
and disposal can get complicated. 
4.2 Artificial seawater 
There are a large number of published recipes for the preparation of artificial seawater 
(Bidwell and Spotte, 1985). This comprehensive citation lists 169 seawater and enrichment 
formulations for culturing everything from marine yeasts, fungus, and up to vertebrates. 
Enrichment formulations contain trace elements and compounds that may not be present in 
artificial seawater formulations or may be depleted in culture systems, but are incapable of 
supporting marine organisms by themselves. Many artificial seawater formulations have been 
developed and used in specialized applications involving single species and for only parts 
of the life cycle. In addition, there exist commercial mixtures that have broader uses. An 
artificial seawater should have some specific characteristics (see Table 4.1). Many of the 
published mixtures do not meet these requirements. Some have compositions far removed 
TABLE 4.1 
Characteristics of good artificial seawater mixtures (derived from Spotte, 1979) 
(A) It is simple but contains in reasonable concentrations elements known to be essential to animals and plants. 
(B) It is relatively easy to measure and mix. 
(C) Major ions are present in concentrations and ratios approximating natural seawater.

in content and concentrations from natural seawater. Others have very elaborate preparation 
processes involving up to four steps. Very few can simply be dumped into the right amount of 
freshwater and used soon thereafter, except in small quantities. Preparation of large quantities 
of artificial seawater requires use of specialized dissolving equipment (see Spotte, 1979). 
Some formulations require considerable time for components to dissolve and reach chemical 
equilibrium. 
Artificial seawater mixtures that are useable with animals (see summary Table 4.2) may 
not be suitable for plants. Even for only marine animals, a given mixture may not be suitable 
for a particular species or life stage. Using a mixture for a new application will involve some 
risk. Unless there is specific information that a mixture is suitable for a given application, 
the risk can be minimized by using a commercial preparation that has been demonstrated to 
have broad applications. One such commercial mixture, trade-marked 'Instant Ocean', was 
developed based on earlier research (Segedi and Kelly, 1964) and is listed in Table 4.2. For 
routine use, commercial mixtures may be a better choice than custom mixing of components 
because of better quality control of individual components and the mixing process. Trace 
contamination of specific components can be a serious problem in critical applications. For 
critical applications, enough chemicals (or commercial mixture) should be purchased for the 
entire experiment and preliminary bioassay should be conducted to ensure that the resulting 
seawater is acceptable. 
Commercial seawater mixtures, however, neglect the needs of marine plants (Spotte, 1979). 
Mixtures suitable for marine plants have been reviewed by Droop (1969), McLachlan (1973) 
and Kinne (1976). 

62 
One of the major problems with artificial seawater in closed systems is that if something 
goes wrong, it may be impossible to determine the precise cause. It could be the original 
mixture or a whole host of other problems involved with closed systems, such as build-up 
or depletion of critical substances. The precise requirements of many species are not well 
documented, especially in the area of trace components. Since all mixtures are a simplification 
of natural seawater, the small missing components may prove critical in a given situation. 
4.3 Seawater wells 
The relationships between seawater and freshwater ground waters near the shoreline 
can be quite complex and variable depending on specific site conditions. Fig. 4.1 shows 
two simple possibilities. Even in the case of a narrow sand spit surrounded by seawater, 
there can be significant freshwater present. The higher elevation of the freshwater is due 
to the lower density of freshwater and static equilibrium conditions. The second case is 
also typical, with alternating permeable and impermeable layers. It demonstrates how it 
is possible to get freshwater offshore and just below the bottom. Since the layering can 
be complex, discontinuous, folded and spotty in distribution, the number of variations is 
immense. Therefore, it is very important to have a clear understanding of the local geology of 
the site before one can seriously discuss the possibility of developing seawater wells. 
For any type of seawater well the soil permeability will be critical. Permeability is 
measured by hydraulic conductivity, in older texts also called the coefficient of permeability, 
which may have a number of units (ft/day, cm/s). Gravel and clean sand, preferable coarse 
and large grained, might be suitable for a seawater well. Clays and soils with high organic

Example 4.1. Determination of hydraulic conductivity 
A l0 cm diameter cylinder of undisturbed soil (as close to in situ 
condition as possible) is tested for hydraulic conductivity with a constant 
head permeameter. The difference in the water elevations in the two 
standpipes connected to the soil sample at a vertical separation of 20 cm 
is 127 cm. The flow rate through the column is found, with a graduate 
tube and stop watch at the bottom, to correspond to 1 1 in 2.88 m. What 
is the value of the hydraulic conductivity for this sample and is there 
any possibility of developing seawater wells in this soil material?

This is an attractive value characteristic of coarse sand, and seawater well possibilities should be further

content, unfortunately very common in estuarine and sheltered waters, are clearly unsuitable. 
While soils vary widely and generalities without knowing the specific requirements of a 
given situation are hazardous, some 'rules of thumb' can be presented. Soils with hydraulic 
conductivities less than about 10 ft/day or 3.0 m/day are poor prospects. The higher the value 
the better. Hydraulic conductivity of coarse-grained soils is usually determined by a constant 
head permeability test (Lowe, 1969). In this test, water is supplied from an elevated constant 
head tank (see Section 9.2) to an undisturbed vertical column of soil. There are two standpipes 
connected to the column with a fixed difference in elevation on the column, one near the top 
of the sample and one near the bottom. The differences in elevation of the tops of the two 
static water columns in the two standpipes is measured as is the flow rate through the column. 
The hydraulic conductivity is then calculated from the equation below, while being careful 
with dimensions (see Example 4.1).

where K is hydraulic conductivity, Q is flow rate through sample, L is sample length in flow 
direction (vertical separation between standpipe taps), h is difference in head (elevation) across 
sample as measured by water levels in standpipes (hydraulic gradient), A is cross-sectional 
area perpendicular to flow. 
Many times it is impossible to obtain a truly representative and undisturbed soil sample 
and it may be necessary to drill a test well to determine hydraulic conductivity and well yield. 
This approach has the additional advantage that the water quality can be tested. 
There are several approaches to seawater wells. One is to lay a gravel-packed crib just 
below the bottom (see Fig. 4.2A). This in effect uses the overlying coarse sand as a sand 
filter (see Section 10.6). The cap is needed to prevent short-circuiting directly above the crib

and in the event of backflushing. There are a number of variations of this approach and 
in a variety of sizes. Placement can be intertidal, which lowers the pumping opportunities 
but makes installation easier, or preferably for operational flexibility, sub-tidally. Large flows 
are produced by thin layers of highly permeable sands. Even in geographic areas composed 
primarily of coarse sand, the bottom's surface layers just offshore are likely to be more 
impermeable and to have quantities of organic and inorganic fines to clog the system. In 
addition, too thin a cover could be removed by currents, wave action or backflushing of the 
filter. If there is little likelihood of strong currents or waves even during storms, the cover 
could be as small as about a half foot (15 cm). Since breaking waves, even small ones, can 
cut terraces in near-shore bottoms, a much safer value for most sheltered sites would be about 
1.5 ft (0.5 m). If large ocean waves can be encountered during major storms, considerably 
more may be needed. The flow possible from such a crib will be highly variable but a 'rule 
of thumb', assuming favorable conditions, is 1 m 3/h per 3 m 2 of perforated crib surface area 
(0.14 gpm/ft 2) (Cransdale, 1981). Generally, several smaller cribs can produce more water 

65 
than a large one. If more than one is to be used, they should be separated by at least 20 (6 m) 
and preferably about 30 ft (9 m). 
Another way is to lay an offshore leaching field of perforated piping a few feet below the 
bottom and just below or above the low tide line (see Fig. 4.2B). One can specify the size of 
the trench, the quantity of coarse material packing around the well and the depth of uniform 
cover based on the same considerations as for a crib or sand filter (see Example 4.2). However, 
properly installing such a system sub-tidally, in an area with any currents or wave action, 
range from difficult to impossible. Intertidal placement reduces pumping opportunities and the 
Example 4.2. In situ sand filter 
A 1-ft-diameter slotted or screened pipe (or a smaller pipe with a packing) is buried with its center-line 2 ft 
below the surface of a submerged sand bottom. The sand is the same as in Example 4.1 (K = 10 m/day) and 
the sand is barely covered by seawater at low tide. 
(A) If the maximum acceptable head loss across the sand filter is 3 ft of water, roughly estimate the seawater 
flow rate in gpm per linear foot of filter pipe. 
Using Eq. 4.1 with K = 10 m/day = 32.8 ft/day, L = 2 ft (average), h = 3 ft

hydrostatic head available for filtering. Even under the best of conditions and using the same 
'rule of thumb' provided for the crib, the size of the required leaching field may be impressive. 
The laterals must be sufficiently separated, at least 10 ft (3 m), preferably more. There is 
always the possibility of storm waves carving a terrace fight through the system, burying it 
much deeper than intended or exposing parts, thereby short-circuiting the filtering action of 
the bottom. If the design is overly optimistic or the flow requirements increase, the pumps 
will pull an increased partial vacuum in the well system. There is a high probability that this 
deterioration in pump suction side conditions will lead to major pump problems (see Chapter 
7). The crib system also shares some of these problems. The leaching field approach will often 
prove to be both expensive and risky. The crib system is usually easier and cheaper to install 
and is somewhat less vulnerable to storm damage. If working properly and conditions are 
good, neither should have any fouling problems nor loss in performance with time. If short- 
circuiting and resulting biofouling occur, or fines clog the intake, backflushing may be helpful. 
The third approach uses more conventional well technologies (Driscoll, 1986) with the 
hope of finding seawater which has percolated in from the nearby ocean (see Fig. 4.2C). These 
well points may be shallow, in the order of 15 ft (5 m) or much deeper. If shallow, they can be 
'jetted' in and the oversized hole packed with gravel or very course sand. What one may find 
instead of seawater is freshwater, even at the shoreline, or fossilized seawater. Coastal areas, 
even sand barrier beaches, often have sub-layers of impermeable clay or organic materials, 
such as peat or old mangrove swamps. Even if seawater is found, it may be of poor quality. 
It may be low in dissolved oxygen, even anaerobic, and may contain dissolved hydrogen 
sulfide. With the exception of iron and manganese, the concentrations of heavy metals from 
seawater wells is generally lower than that in the open ocean (Scholes, 1980; Chen et al., 
1985). In addition, the salinity and pH of well water also are usually lower than the sea. On 
aeration of anaerobic waters, iron and manganese may precipitate out. These solids can clog 
the gills of larval forms resulting in high mortalities. A quick test is to place a few young 
specimens of the culture organisms in the well water. If they quickly die, the water quality is 
clearly inadequate; on the other hand, their survival for more than a few hours would mean 
that the water should be thoroughly analyzed for more subtle factors. When the seawater 
quality is marginal, treatment may increase water quality. However, this negates most of the 
advantage of such systems relative to intakes and increases complexity, cost and risk. Even 
though the quality is good, it may be difficult to get the needed quantity, requiting a number 
of separated wells, increasing costs. If the conditions are favorable and the system is designed 
and constructed properly, a well point system will have the highest reliability and the most 
consistent water quality (see Example 4.3). 
4.4 Marine intakes 
Submerged marine intakes are the most common type of intake. There are a number of 
important interactions between the location of the intakes and the rest of the system. These 
are discussed in Section 5.3. This section will concentrate on the engineering considerations 
dealing with the intakes themselves. 
Marine intakes by necessity must protrude above the bottom. They are, therefore, subject 
to currents and wave forces. Wave effects associated with rare storms are usually the biggest 
threat to intakes, pump stations and other shore-side facilities. It is important to quantify 

67 
Example 4.3. Seawater well 
A four inch seawater well is to be placed on a sand spit. The static level of the seawater in the ground is at 
about mean sea level (MSL) and there is no freshwater present. The sand layer is believed to extend at least 
50 m below MSL. A maximum draw down of 5 m, a radius of influence of 25 m and a tested soil hydraulic 
conductivity of 10 m/day (see Example 4.1) are believed to be reasonable for this site. Based on the equation 
given below for an unconfined aquifer, what is the maximum sustainable flow rate from this seawater well? 
Q = l'366K(H2 - h2) (flow in m3/day) 
K = hydraulic conductivity (m 3/m 2 per day) = 10 m/day 
R -- radius of cone of depression = 25 m 
r 
- radius of well - 2 inches - 0.0508 m 
H --- static head from base of aquifer to static water level -- 50 m 
h = static head from base of aquifer to depth of water in well = H - draw down = 50 - 5 = 45 m 
Q = 
1.366K(10)(502 - 452) 
log { 
25 
0.0508 } 
= 2410 m3/day = 0.279 m3/s 
Q = 0.0279 m 3/s = 0.985 ft 3/s = 443 gpm 
these waves. Wave characteristics can be predicted from meteorological conditions such as 
wind speed, wind duration, direction, distance over which the wind blows, and depth of water 
relative to the waves (Pierson et al., 1955; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1975). These 
methods are based on empirical data. Since our interests are centered on rare extreme storms, 
the accuracy of these methods is low. This is due to the rarity of data-taking opportunities and 
problems of taking accurate data under extreme conditions. Based on a cost-risk evaluation, 
a 'design' storm is chosen. For large permanent systems, this may be the 25, 50 or 100 year 
storm (the worst storm that on the average occurs with this frequency). For short-term systems 
it could be a lot lower, say the 5 to 20 year storm depending on the desired system lifetime 
and season of use. Since the winds create a whole series of different waves, the predictions 
are for the 'significant wave height'. The significant wave height is the average of the highest 
one-third of the waves present. Although it is not a normal distribution, the wave height 
is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. At very low probabilities, a very 
impressive wave might be seen during a not very rare seasonal storm. For design purposes a 
maximum wave height of twice the significant wave height of the design storm is conservative. 
There are no unique values for wave length or period for a given wave height. However, most 
probable values can be used. The characterization of the worst or 'design' wave includes the 
wave height and the most probable associated wave length and period. Wave forces at any 
depth can now be calculated on different shapes (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1975). Wave 
forces decay hyperbolically with depth, at a depth of one-half wave length wave forces can 
be neglected. As waves approach shore, their heights will increase and their wave lengths 
decrease. Given the near-shore bottom topography, wave characteristics and possible changes

Fig. 4.3. Intake elevations and placement. Near-shore topography, wave characteristics and required vertical 
dimensions will dictate intake placement and lengths of intake lines. Efforts to reduce required intake water depths 
and resulting intake pipe lengths with their high associated construction costs may introduce substantial risks and 
losses in operational flexibility. 
in direction due to refraction can be calculated as a function of position. At some point, the 
wave will break. Using the maximum and minimum tidal elevations that could be associated 
with the selected design storm and the offshore beach slope, it is important to determine 
the maximum and minimum distance from the shore that the storm waves will break (U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers, 1975). The reason is that wave forces due to breaking waves can 
have peak values as much as 100 times higher than the already impressive numbers from a 
non-breaking wave with the same parameters. Intakes or other structures caught in the surf 
zone of a major storm have a high probability of being destroyed. Waves can be destructive 
even above the highest water elevation due to wave runup (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 
1975). Storm waves and storm flooding are a serious threat to many coastal facilities. 
The intakes should be sufficiently seaward and deep enough to be outside of the area of 
breaking storm waves at an extreme low tide (see Fig. 4.3). There is also a minimum water 
depth which is required above vertically oriented open pipe intakes to prevent them from 
drawing air. At high levels of air ingestion the pumps may cavitate and self destruct. At lower 
levels of air entrainment, high levels of gas supersaturation may be produced (see Section 
12.4), with possible resulting mass mortalities. The minimum water cover is a function of the 
average velocity in the intake pipe (see Fig. 4.4). This submergence is also helpful in avoiding 
collisions with small craft, which can be a serious hazard to intakes too close to the surface 
at low tide. The intake lines should be sufficiently buried to avoid exposure by storm induced 
beach profile changes (see Section 5.3). 
The intakes may be screened or unscreened. In areas with floating and drifting debris of 
natural or man-made origin, or ample marine life, there is no choice. In the vast majority of 
cases, the intakes have to be screened to prevent the possible ingestion and resulting damage 
from these causes. If there is little or no seaweed, debris or fish, even associated with storms, 
then the risk of not using a screen may be acceptable. The advantages of unscreened intakes 
are greater simplicity, reduced cost and lower suction-side frictional losses (see Chapter 6). 
Intake screens can be a complex subject whose basic characteristics and tradeoffs are often 
not understood even by longtime users (Huguenin and Huguenin, 1984).

Average Fluid Velocity in Pipe 
(ft/s) 
Fig. 4.4. Minimum intake submergence to preclude air ingestion. Vortexing of a submerged intake is a very 
complicated subject without any easy answers. It can sometimes occur even with considerable submergence, 
especially at high pipe flow velocities. The presented guidelines are believed to be conservative under most 
conditions and assume a vertically oriented straight pipe intake (the worst case situation). A velocity cap or 
horizontal plate above the intake may dramatically reduce the minimum required submergence. 
There are a number of important points with screens. The mesh openings should be as 
large as possible and still protect the pumps. The pump manufacturer will usually state the 
size of the largest solid object that a given pump can accommodate without damage. Some 
pumps, such as 'trash' pumps, allow ready access to the pump impeller without disconnecting 
the piping, resulting in easy removal of any pump-clogging debris. Small screen holes foul 
much faster than big ones. The usual range would be with hole dimensions of about 0.5 to 
1.5 in. (13-38 cm), preferably on the large side. Fish with lengths as much as five times the 
hole size can get through, sometimes unhurt although most will get hashed by the pumps. 
The screen area should be as large as possible so that the through screen velocity (flow 
rate/screen open area) is very low, in the order of 0.1 ft/s (3 cm/s) (see Example 4.4). A low 
velocity reduces both the capture effect of the screen on nearby drifting marine life and debris 
and the frictional head loss across the screen. A properly designed screen in clean condition 
will have a negligible head loss. However, blockage from drifting objects and biofouling can 
dramatically increase the head loss, if the screens are not periodically cleaned and maintained. 
A vacuum gage on the suction side of the pump should be used to monitor the fouling of 
the screens and intake line. Intake screens have to be regularly inspected and kept clean of 
any significant biofouling. Rapid biofouling of screens can be a serious problem (Huguenin 
and Ansuini, 1981) and a maintenance nightmare. With proper care, biofouling-resistant 
copper-nickel metal screens have been successfully used for marine laboratory seawater 
intakes. The screens, if made from thin mesh, should be internally reinforced to structurally 
withstand the pressure differential caused by even modest fouling. At high fouling levels, the 
pressure differential could approach one atmosphere, at which point pump system problems 
are certain. Most screens will collapse under these conditions, sometimes restoring flow but 
without providing any protection for the pumps. Another consideration is that the screen 
should be shaped to best shed drifting debris. A spherical shape is best but impractical. An 
uptight cylinder or cone is the next best. The intakes should not be placed where debris is 
likely to accumulate due to local flow patterns. 

70 
Example 4.4. Intake screen 
You have to design an intake screen to flow a maximum of 100 gpm. 
(A) You wish to keep the average through screen velocity to under 0.1 ft/s, what is the minimum open area 
on the screen? 
100 gpm = 0.222 ft3/s 
Flow = area x velocity = 0.222 = area x 0.1 
Area -- 2.22 ft 2 (this is the minimum required open area of the screen) 
(B) You are considering an intake made of large-diameter plastic or fiberglass pipe drilled with 1-inch holes. 
What is the minimum required number of 1-inch holes? 
Area of 1 inch in diameter hole = 0.00545 ft 2 
Number of holes = required area/area per hole = 2.22/0.00545 = 408 holes 
(C) 1-inch holes on 2-inch centers with staggered rows gives an effective open area of only 20% of the 
screen area (prove this to be true). If you use only the sides of the cylinder and a 1-ft-diameter pipe, what is 
the minimum height of the intake screen? 
Screen face area = 2.22/0.2 = 11.1 ft 2 = 7r(d)(height) = (3.14)(L)(height) 
Minimum screen height = 3.5 ft 
(D) If you use strong expanded metal formed into a 1-ft-diameter cylinder with an effective open area of 
60% instead of the pipe above, what is the minimum height of the screen? 
Screen face area = 2.22/0.6 = 3.7 ft 2 = 7r(d)(height) = (3.14)(L)(height) 
Minimum screen height -- 1.2 ft 
A velocity cap is a horizontal plate above an intake pipe which changes the intake flow 
from the vertical direction in the pipe to horizontally at the point of intake. The cap should be 
positioned about a half diameter or more above the intake pipe and should have a somewhat 
larger diameter than the pipe, in the order of one and a half diameters. Studies have shown 
that small swimming marine organisms are more resistant to capture by the intake if flow is 
horizontal rather than vertical. A cap can also greatly reduce the required intake submergence 
depth shown in Fig. 4.4, especially at the higher fluid velocities, but adds surface area for 
biofouling and for storm waves to act upon. A velocity cap can be used alone or built into a 
screen structure as a solid horizontal top surface (see Fig. 4.5). The screen top may be hinged 
to allow access to the interior without having to remove the entire screen. This can be helpful 
in recovering pipe cleaning 'pigs' from inside the intake. 
Many different types of intake structures have been used but most have been some variation 
of the two approaches shown in Fig. 4.5. Both have flanges, allowing them to be disconnected 
from the intake piping, facilitating initial assembly and subsequent replacement in the event 
of damage by storms or fishing gear. Approach 'A' uses a small light block, which is buried, 
and it can be used with or without a screen. Approach 'B' uses a more massive block, which 
is only partially buried. It is usually used with a screen which is attached directly to the

Fig. 4.5. Two conceptual approaches to intake design. Both approaches should use as dense a concrete as possible. 
Approach 'A' can be used with or without a screen. If the block in approach 'B' is heavy and dense enough and the 
area is not subject to strong currents or major storm effects, it may not need further anchoring. 
block. A variation of Type B is to have a truncated pyramid with a solid top and mesh on its 
four sides. The advantage is that the shape more readily sheds fishing gear and boat anchors. 
The disadvantage is that the base is larger and heavier, increasing handling and placement 
problems. All types are often secured to the bottom with pilings, screw augers or other means, 
especially if placed on the surface. The pilings can be steel pipes or concrete-filled plastic 
pipes with or without steel reinforcement bars. Any appreciable penetration of the intake 
structure into the bottom will substantially reduce the need for piling to resist lateral forces. 
In benign areas with no appreciable currents or waves, even during storms, mass of concrete 
alone may suffice for anchorage. On a flat surface, a general guide for clump mass anchors 
is that they can withstand a horizontal force of about one-half their in-water weight (Myers 
et al., 1968). There is an advantage in using denser concrete. Obviously the dimensions and 
specifications of these systems will depend on individual conditions and site characteristics. 
Another variation is building the intakes on a sled (Bouck, 1981), which can be towed into 
position and secured. Storm forces being what they are, even a good intake design may not 
compensate for a poor intake location. 
Another type of submerged intake sometimes encountered in sheltered areas involves an 
above-bottom variation of the crib shown as A in Fig. 4.2. In this case, no fine filtering with 
its attendant advantages occurs. However, the gravel can provide coarse filtering, acting in 
the manner of a screen. However, with this type it is harder to remove biofouling than from 
a screen, since much of it will be on the gravel internally. Frictional head losses through the 
gravel are likely to be much higher, especially once biofouled. It is usually much bigger and 
heavier, but possibly cheaper if made of available materials, than comparable screen intakes 
of the types shown in Fig. 4.5. Since larger, it will also experience greater current and wave 
forces and will have to be better secured to prevent movement. Due to its mass, it may provide 
considerably greater protection to the intake from boat and fishing gear collisions.

System Planviews and Elevations 
5.1 Generic system 
Assuming that the general site and desired system flow rate are known, it is necessary 
to consider piping layout options and considerations. The physical dimensions, soil types, 
elevations, and orientations of the site should be precisely determined. It is particularly 
important that the elevations of the seawater source be precisely known under all possible 
conditions relative to the site. This includes normal as well as unusually high and low tides 
associated with extremely rare storms (see Section 3.1). Errors of only a few feet in elevation 
could have serious consequences to the operation of the seawater system. From a strictly 
seawater system perspective, the best location is to have all the components close together and 
as close to the seawater source as topographical constraints and storm-tide elevations and wave 
run-up will allow. Unfortunately, the specific locations are often fixed by previous facilities, 
practical considerations not directly related to the seawater system and site-specific factors. 
In short, economic, political and regulatory factors, rather than technical considerations, often 
dominate. 
A simplified diagram of a generic seawater system is given in Fig. 5.1. It does not show 
any redundancy, parallel operations, or cross-connections that may be required. The water 
processing equipment may be at positions noted as #1, #2, both, or neither locations. If 
all the water to be used in the system is to receive the same level of treatment, the water 
processing equipment will usually be at location #1. The advantage is that the pumping 
equipment can then be selected to compensate for whatever frictional head losses are created 
by the equipment. If only part of the water needs treatment or some part of it needs more 
extensive treatment than the rest, treatment equipment is likely to be located at position #2

and only on those parallel lines where specifically required. For multiple small-scale culture 
units with diverse requirements, such as is typical in a marine laboratory context, location 
#2 is often at the point of use immediately adjacent to the culture unit. The nature of the 
processing equipment at any position #2 will vary according to the requirements of that 
culture unit. While location at position #2 allows use of smaller-sized equipment, it can also 
have undesirable effects on flow stability and regulation downstream. This problem is most 
serious if any of the treatment units has significant head losses (see Sections 5.3 and 9.1). 
To correctly place, size, and specify the processing equipment, it is very important to know 
the specific seawater quality and quantity requirements for the different parts of the system. 
All the uses may have the same requirements or they may be quite different. Furthermore, 
experience has shown that off-line operational needs, such as tank filling, rinsing and cleaning, 
can increase the maximum flow requirement by as much as 20%. It is necessary to determine 
both the total daily water requirement as well as the maximum flow rate. Fig. 5.2, as an 
example, shows the internal water distribution in a crustacean hatchery and placement of 
processing equipment (Colt and Huguenin, 1992). In this case, algal culture needed finer 
filtration than the other functions. A diatomaceous earth filter with an integral booster pump 
was used. Determining the scale for each activity is not as straightforward as it may appear, 
if the activities are interrelated. There are inherent assumptions both present and future as 

75 
to loading, growth, survival ratios, and efficiency in each activity and these are linked to 
the activity-specific water treatment specifications. Under-capacity in one part of the system 
can limit the entire system, while over-capacity is irrelevant and expensive (unless it can be 
translated into extra production at some intermediate stage, such as post-larvae, that can be 
sold to other culturists). 
5.2 Elevations and head tanks 
Head tanks, head boxes, or head ponds are needed to minimize the pumping steps in 
the system by providing the elevation required for gravity flow. The importance of water 
elevations in head tanks has already been stated. Even so, it can get complicated. Fig. 5.3 
shows the elevations and relationships of components in one marine research facility. In this 
case, elevations were very precisely determined because there are many steps in the gravity 
flow sequence for different process waters. 
A head tank is a common component of most seawater systems and can serve a number 
of other functions (Table 5.1). It provides a buffer to smooth-out transients between supply 
and demand caused by irregularities in demand and variations in supply. Irregular demand can 
be created by batch processes and the cleaning or refilling of tanks. Variations in supply can 
be caused by tidal effects, switching of pumps or changes in water processing. By necessity 
the average supply must be greater than the demand. If the supply is adequate to maintain 
the head box elevation at overflow and the piping between the head box to points of usage 
are large enough to have negligible frictional losses, the head box can be used to provide 
a constant flow rate at any desired point. This control through the use of fixed orifices (see 
Section 9.1) or valves can be quite accurate and stable, sometimes eliminating the need for 
expensive flow control devices. A major function of head boxes is to provide water for a 
period of time after a seawater supply failure. This provides time to troubleshoot the failure

From the head boxes the fluids flow by gravity from one level to another. The nutrient distribution system shown is 
actually a double system, since two different fluids can be fed simultaneously to the ponds and raceways from the 
three large storage tanks. The seawater inflow is about 600 gpm with one pump on (Huguenin, 1974).

and/or make repairs without loss of seawater supply to the culture units. The time available 
is a function of system design and can vary from minutes to days. The time period available 
for critical uses can usually be increased by stopping or cutting back the flow to lower priority 
uses. The size of the head box is usually determined by the time estimated to be needed after 
failures under the range of likely present and future operating conditions. Cost is also a factor, 
but in the range of flows being considered the head boxes are still usually rather modest in 
dimensions, and the costs are a small part of the total system cost and can be further reduced 
by clever design. 
Another service performed by head boxes is to act as sedimentation chambers (see Section 
10.8). This may be especially valuable during storms, due to the large increases in suspended 
materials often encountered in shallow coastal areas. Performance in this capacity is dependent 
on several factors, including the size and specific gravity of the suspended particles. Generally, 
residence times in the head box of greater than 1 h can significantly reduce turbidity. During 
severe storms that produce high concentrations of suspended solids, even a few minutes of 
settling may produce dramatic improvements. On the other hand, suspended colloidal-clay 
particles may never have sufficient time to settle. Provisions must be made to periodically 
remove the settled solids. The quantity and weight involved, even for just one short storm, 
can be impressive. It is worth remembering that sediments not removed in the head box may 
be deposited in other places downstream within the system wherever the flow velocities are 
reduced. 
Head boxes can affect water parameters other than turbidity. They often develop surprising 
amounts of resident life forms, which can affect water properties. Surprisingly, while water 
temperatures may be much different from ambient temperatures around the head box, water 
temperatures do not change significantly from that in the incoming water. This is due to 
the high specific heat capacity of the water, the limited residence time in the head box, 
and the insulative properties of the tank materials. However, indoor head boxes can under 
humid conditions condense impressive amounts of freshwater out of the air on their cold 
sides. Over-head seawater pipes can also 'sweat'. This sweating can be reduced by insulation. 
Electrical and corrosion hazards from the condensed water can be reduced by careful layout. 
5.3 Intake and pump house considerations 
While water quality should have been one of the primary considerations in site selection, 
there are often intake location options on a given site which will maximize the available 
water quality. The intake should be placed far away and upstream from any possible source of 

77 
water contamination. In addition to other discharges, these include inlets, streams or brooks, 
boat anchorages, industrial or municipal outfalls and storm drainage. Some of these possible 
contaminant sources are readily visible, others may be less obvious. Sources of drainage may 
only be obvious at certain seasons or after major storms. Sewage or industrial outfalls may not 
be shown on hydrographic charts, even when completely legal. Illegal or quasi-legal outfalls 
can sometimes be spotted, especially from the air, at extremely low tides or by chemical, 
physical, or biological differences at slack water, when the discharge water may rise to the 
surface. For examples, seagulls may congregate over sewage outfalls to feed or the water 
color may be significantly different. Another way of maximizing water quality is to draw 
water from an area where its properties show the highest consistency and least variation. 
This usually means as deep and as far from shore as possible. This will also minimize wave 
damage and possible boat damage to the intake structure but increases the installation cost 
and probability of damage from fishing gear. If they exist, there is a strong temptation to 
use sheltered shallow water areas for the intake. This minimizes the probability of storm 
damage, simplifies the system and decreases costs. On the other hand, shallow areas often 
have reduced circulation, higher probability of pollution incidents from other users or boat 
traffic, variable water temperatures and may be subject to rapid salinity drops after heavy 
rains. The probability of short-circuiting the drain may also be increased. The best intake 
location is strongly a function of the specific site conditions, evaluation of risks, and the 
available budget. 
Tidal water elevations and their variations are very critical to the design of the seawater 
system. There are three tide components: astronomical, barometric and wind (storm) tide. 
The astronomical tide, being due to the rotation of the earth, moon and sun, is the only 
completely predictable component. The barometric component may exhibit seasonal patterns, 
which can be factored in on a probabilistic basis. On top of these values it is important to get 
an appreciation of the extreme highs and lows that could be associated with really rare events, 
such as the 25, 50 or 100 year storms (see Section 3.1). 
Once the water elevations can be quantified in a probabilistic manner, there are a series of 
decisions to be made relative to the intake system and pumps. If the range of elevation values 
from maximum high to minimum low are not great, there is no problem with continuous 
operations throughout the tidal range. If the tidal range is high, say greater than 18 ft or 
6 m, then continuous operations may add cost to the system. Pump selection and elevation 
becomes critical (see Chapter 7) and pumps can provide serious design problems at both high 
and low tides. At this point it is worth considering pumping only during some portion of the 
tide, usually the high side. For a given daily flow, this will require bigger and more expensive 
pumps and place some restrictions on the operators, but will reduce the excavation depth 
of the pump house with possible major cost savings. Obviously, this is an area of complex 
tradeoffs. Placing the pumps on a floating platform will solve the high tidal range pump 
problem but may create a number of others. 
The criterion with respect to major storms is usually one of survival and damage minimiza- 
tion. One of the important decisions is defining the storm which the system is designed to 
survive. This is a cost and risk assessment tradeoff. The more extreme the storm, the higher 
the system's cost. Luck also helps, as one could get hit with the 100 year storm the very first 
year. Assuming survival, some parts of the seawater system, but not necessarily the intakes 
and main pumps, may have to remain functional during the storm, such as for providing life

Fig. 5.4. Seawater intake profile example. There are several potential trouble points in a marine intake. This 
example is typical of benign or sheltered sites, where the probabilities of large waves and major storms effects are 
small but not zero. 
Note A. Pipes in this area near the pump station should be straight and especially well supported from below before 
backfilling. All turns should be as gradual as possible to prevent flat spots and stress concentrations on the pipe, 
which might lead to pipe collapse under partial vacuum. 
Note B. The points where the beach changes its slope is where the cover over the pipes is likely to be at a 
minimum. One such point generally occurs at or just below the normal low-tide elevation. Care must be taken 
during installation to assure the minimum cover over the pipes at this vulnerable point. 
Note C. If direct wave action is a possibility during rare storms, some measures to protect the investment in the 
pump house are likely. The hatch on the access trunk would be elevated above grade and water tight. The area 
around the hatch should have a sloped concrete collar to protect the access trunk. The base of the collar should 
extend below grade to counter scouring. To prevent the lateral movement of the collar and subsequent shearing of 
the access trunk, there should be at least four steel pilings or concrete-filled plastic pipe, say about 6 ft or 2 m long, 
acting as pilings and rigidly cast into the collar. The pump house should have a strong steel snorkel of adequate 
height to provide ventilation, an automatic sump pump and an external means of turning off power. 
Note D. The cast concrete intake structures should be buried with the tops as close to grade as possible. The actual 
opening of the intake pipe should be at least 1 ft above grade to prevent the ingestion of bottom-drifting sediments 
and debris. The intake structures must be well secured to the bottom with small pilings or screw-auger anchors, as 
forces from breaking waves under some conditions could be substantial. Under extreme conditions, destruction of 
screens and riser pipe are highly probable and spares should be available for replacement. 
support to brood stocks or critical life-stages. However, for the duration of the storm, water 
quality requirements can usually be greatly reduced with little or no long-term consequences. 
Emergency survival requirements have to be considered during the design phase. 
Beach profiles are also important in systems layout. Data on beach profiles should be 
acquired at least four times over a year, to get seasonal variations (see Fig. 3.3). A longer 
period of observation over several years would be even better. The profile should be extended 
to at least 10 ft or 3 m below the extreme low-tide elevation, preferably deeper. Beach profile 
information is necessary for specifying burial depths for piping and positioning intakes. The 
intake lines have other potential problems, some of which are shown in Fig. 5.4. The pump 
house should be as close to the intakes as tides, waves and flood zone regulations allow to 
minimize suction side frictional losses (see Chapter 6). This also generally minimizes the 
excavation required to install the pump house (see Chapter 7). However, pump houses placed 
very close to the water may increase the probability of storm damage and placement on the 
flood plain (flood zone defined by 100 year flood in coastal zone regulations) can trigger a 
number of regulatory issues. The worst case is an exposed shore where a piping trench cannot 
be excavated or readily blasted. Blasting, in any case, is very unpopular with regulatory 

79 
agencies and in some area may not be allowed. Fortunately for rocky shores, it is often 
possible to find at least a partially sheltered intake location for protecting and securing the 
pipes and intakes. For unfavorable site conditions, even the best engineering and construction 
may result in a system with very high risk of damage to intakes and piping during storms. 
The best answer may be to have backup equipment that can be quickly deployed after damage 
from a major storm. 
A major new and rapidly expanding problem with intakes, pump houses and discharges 
concerns regulatory restrictions. Coastal Zone Management regulations in the USA make it 
very difficult to place pump houses in the 'flood plain'; in short, on a spot with a ground 
elevation below the 100 year storm surge for that area. This results in longer suction side 
pipe lengths and deeper pump house placements, with increased costs. The deeply buried 
pump houses activate 'confined space access' regulations, which make routine access legally 
very difficult without elaborate and costly procedures. The increased costs and operational 
restrictions often result in serious compromises in the design with subsequent increased risks 
of system failure. 
Another area of regulatory restriction is on when and how to construct and emplace intakes 
and discharges. In some areas, in-water construction is only permitted in the winter, due 
to possible construction impacts on 'migration' and 'spawning' of fish and birds. Winter 
weather can make actual construction very difficult or even impossible. The costs in winter 
are very much higher and also impossible to predict with any confidence ahead of time 
due to uncertainties about the weather. In addition, use of sediment fences along in-water 
pipe excavations may be required, even in winter. In-place casting of concrete may not be 
allowed due to restrictions permitting only fully cured concrete. Due to serious weather 
and time constraints, the resulting construction may have important and serious deviations 
from specifications and design criteria. It is imperative for the user to inspect all in-water 
construction as soon as possible after emplacement and certainly before any legal 'sign-off'. 
If serious deviations are found, what can realistically be done to 'fix' the situation may be 
very limited. All this impacts available design options and may result in serious compromises 
with good design practices. 
Regulatory construction restrictions are highly site-specific. Construction in some areas is 
getting much harder to accomplish. It may not be long before otherwise excellent sites are, for 
practical purposes, no longer useable due to regulatory restrictions. It is unfortunate that many 
of the restrictions appear illogical and based more on ideology than scientific facts. 
5.4 Discharge considerations 
The discharge is an often neglected aspect of seawater systems. Since metabolic wastes, 
chemicals, disease organisms, and decay products will be in the drain water, it is essential 
that the drain be situated so as to prevent discharge water from reentering the intake 
(short-circuiting). This is easy to state but sometimes hard to do. There are several basic 
possibilities, which will be determined by the site configuration and conditions (see Fig. 5.5). 
The best situation is to have intakes on one side of a sand spit and the discharge on the other 
with no nearby inlet (Fig. 5.5A). If the site has a consistent alongshore current, the discharge 
can be placed downstream and as far from the intakes as practical (Fig. 5.5B). An alongshore 
current under some conditions can switch direction and develop countercurrents or large

eddies, resulting in short-circuiting of water flow. If the alongshore currents are unpredictable 
or switch direction with the tide, which is a common situation, the intake can be taken from as 
far out as practical while the discharge is dropped along the same line but as close to shore 
as possible (Fig. 5.5C). The discharge could even be on the beach or buried in a rock jetty. 
Factors of aesthetics and environmental regulations must also be considered. Short-circuiting 
under various environmental conditions can be checked with fluorescent dyes. 
Another major consideration is that drain lines should be greatly oversized. They cannot 
be sized for the normal flow but must be capable of handling much larger transients. These 
high transient flows can occur when someone pulls the plug on a tank for cleaning, recycling 
or repair. If the drains cannot handle the flow, it will be quickly apparent. The consequences 
run from annoying to serious, depending on the circumstances. Subsequent tank draining 
procedures will then require much more time and attention to avoid overflow. In addition, 
drains have a great tendency to fill with sediments, wastes, debris, and assorted garbage, 
further reducing flow capacity. Any sumps or other chambers in the drain system will be 
particularly susceptible to clogging or fouling due to biological growth. Most gravity-flow 
drain lines do not have sufficient flow velocity to be self-cleaning. Drains must be frequently 
inspected and maintained and can require considerable time and effort. The extra costs of 
oversizing drain lines can usually be easily recovered in reduced problems and reduced 
servicing.

Chapter 6 
Piping Design and Calculations 
6.1 Major tradeoffs 
There are basically two ways to transport water: open channels and pipes. Open channels 
require strict control of elevations over their entire length but usually have very low frictional 
losses compared to pipes. At flow rates one or more orders of magnitude above our area of 
interest, open channels can be cheaper than pipes if the soil types, required length, and topog- 
raphy are favorable. For our flow rates and typical conditions, channels are clearly not compet- 
itive, with one possible exception. This is for drain lines. Even in this case, a prepared channel 
will most likely be more expensive than pipes. However, the cost difference may be compen- 
sated for by the improved access to channels for inspection and cleaning (see Section 6.6). 
Given a desired flow rate, one apparent choice is between a small pipe with high frictional 
losses or a large pipe with low frictional losses. Frictional losses in pipes or equipment can be 
measured in pressure units or elevation (head) units. These are interchangeable by knowing 
the specific weight of the fluid, i.e., seawater (see Table A-3). Considerations include the 
extra cost of large diameter pipe balanced by the increased pumping costs of small pipes 
due to higher frictional losses resulting in more powerful pumps and increased energy costs. 
Smaller pipes have higher velocities, which make them more susceptible to water hammer 
(see Section 6.3). As will be seen, predicting frictional losses is difficult, imprecise, and may 
vary with time and conditions. Frictional losses are a function of the fluid properties, pipe 
velocity, pipe material, pipe condition, and pipe diameter. Additional frictional loses also 
occur wherever piping changes direction, such as at an elbow, a T, or where the pipes change 
diameter, such as at a reducing fitting or the inlet/outlet of a tank. If flow is controlled by 
gravity rather than pumps, the acceptable frictional losses for the desired flow rate may be 
severely constrained by the available elevation differences and the piping system will have to 
be carefully designed to minimize frictional losses. 
For preliminary design purposes, pipes can be sized by using a velocity criterion, such as 
1.5 m/s (5 ft/s). This is a suitable compromise for many conditions, although gravity flow 
situations and long pipe runs may require even lower values. In calculating average pipe 
velocities it should be noted that the nominal pipe sizes are not exactly the same as the inside 
diameter dimensions. However, for rough calculations the errors will usually be small. An 
exception is polyethylene pipe on the suction side of a pump, where concern for possible 
pipe collapse under partial vacuum requires thick walls. As an example, 16 inch nominal 
polyethylene SDR 11 pipe can have an inside diameter of only 12.9 inches (an error of about 
35%). Since pipes come in discrete sizes and not all sizes are readily available or provide the 
same selection of fittings, the velocity criteria will not necessarily provide a clear decision on 
the best pipe size. 

82 
A fact not fully appreciated by many, is that the specifics of the piping, processing system 
and the pumps are highly interdependent in seawater systems. If you alter the specifications 
or operating conditions of the piping or other system components, you will alter the operation 
and performance of the pumps, and vice versa. How a seawater system will perform is 
dependent not only on the installed equipment but also on the precise operating conditions 
at any given time, especially in areas with high tidal variations. If the conditions exceed 
the operating envelope of the system, problems and possible failure will follow. For this 
reason determining system head losses and pump selection are very complex and receive 
considerable attention. 
6.2 Biofouling control 
One of the most important factors which can affect the performance of a seawater system 
over a period of time is due to marine biofouling. Its control is also one of the most 
troublesome factors associated with the operation and maintenance of seawater systems. 
The extent of the problems is highly dependent on season and location. Different sites can 
have high variations in biofouling rates, even over relatively short distances. Biofouling 
roughens the surfaces of pipes and equipment, thereby increasing frictional losses. If allowed 
to continue, it will effectively reduce the flow areas, dramatically increasing pipe velocity 
and frictional losses while reducing flow capacity. Over a period of 12-16 months, a heavy 
growth of mussels can turn an 8 inch pipe into a 3 inch pipe. High frictional losses can 
lead not only to greatly reduced system performance but also to total system failures. As a 
consequence, considerable efforts are often devoted to biofouling control. Biofouling control 
will be much easier if the various control options are considered during the design phase, 
rather than only after problems become evident during operations, as is common. If biofouling 
is allowed to proceed until flow rates are significantly reduced, it may be necessary to turn the 
system off for a prolonged time period, days, weeks, or even months, to fix the problem. The 
methods needed to clean heavily fouled lines may seriously damage plastic or fiberglass pipes 
and fittings, especially in turns. In some cases, it may be quicker and cheaper to completely 
replace heavily fouled pipes and fittings. 
Many methods have been used to control biofouling in seawater systems and all have their 
advantages and disadvantages (Table 6.1). In a complex system, many of them may be used 
in different parts of the system. It is general practice to have at least two options for every 
part of the system. There can be major cost and reliability considerations involved with these 
decisions and they will affect system design. 
A common approach in many research oriented seawater systems is to have two complete 
parallel piping systems, suitably cross-connected for maximum flexibility. This allows the 
water in the non-operating system to go anaerobic, thus killing all the fouling organisms, 
while the other system is in use. These two systems are alternated in use on a fixed schedule, 
usually about every 2 weeks. This approach is very reliable and works well but has the 
increased cost associated with a double system. In the special case of a short term or seasonal 
system in a low biofouling area, the same control method might be used with a single system. 
Another approach is to design the system such that the water velocities in the pipes are 
sufficiently high to preclude biofouling. Minimum water velocities in the range of 8-10 ft/s 
(about 3 m/s) are required. These values are valid only under conditions which preclude

photosynthesis, such as opaque pipe, since some attached algae can tolerate much higher 
velocities. This approach can be reliable, works well and is best suited to long straight pipe 
runs, especially for supply lines. If operational conditions change and the velocities drop 
below the minimum, the lines may foul. Intakes, discharge areas, and lateral branches, where 
velocities could be lower, may be particularly susceptible to biofouling. If the velocities are in 
the region of 15 ft/s (4 m/s) or above and there are entrained abrasive particles, such as sand, 
the life time of plastic pipe may be seriously reduced by erosion, especially in turns. In areas 
of substantial tide, the flow velocities in the main supply lines may vary by 1.5- to 3-fold over 
a tidal cycle. Therefore, if the minimum flow velocity is high enough to prevent biofouling, 
excessive velocities may be produced at other times. In addition, high water velocity coupled 
with long pipe runs increase the hazard from water hammer (see Section 6.3). In spite of its 
potential problems, this approach is sometimes attractive because it is simple and tends to 
minimize front end capital expenses. For long pipe runs, it is often combined with a 'pigging' 
option (see below). 
Mechanical methods are very reliable and can be practical, if provisions for their use have 
been anticipated by allowing for easy access. Often these methods are the method of last 
resort because all others have failed to restore system capacity. Few of the other methods 
actually remove attached biofouling, sediments or debris. If biofouling is allowed to get out 
of hand, these other methods may kill the organisms without restoring adequate flow capacity. 
'Snakes' are the most effective for short runs while polyurethane or plastic 'pigs' work well 
on long runs. These 'pigs' are bullet- or spherically shaped, flexible and contractible (see 
Fig. 6.1). They are of somewhat greater diameter than the inside diameter of the pipe to be 
cleaned. They are pushed through the piping under pressure, cleaning the pipes by friction 
as they proceed. They are available for various types of biofouling, from just surface films 
to major encrustation. They can make 90 degree turns and get through partially closed gate 
valves. The increased pressure normally does not exceed 100 psi and is often considerably

less and suitable for plastic pipes. They take only a few minutes of system downtime for use 
but require piping access for the launch and recovery of the 'pigs'. 'Pigs' can be launched 
from a pressurized cleanout in the line or a specialized 'pig' launcher. A 'pig' launcher for 
'bullet-shaped' pigs can be made with a 'Y' fitting (see Fig. 6.1), with the branch having an 
expansion fitting connected to a section of pipe one size larger in diameter and with a length 
about twice that of the pipe to be cleaned. The end of the branch should be closed with a 
removable cap to allow insertion of the 'pig'. The end of the branch requires a means of 
adding a launching pressure to the back of the 'pig'. This can be a small auxiliary pump or 
small diameter line from the discharge side of a pump. 'Pigs' can be recovered from cleanouts, 
rock traps, wetwells, intake screens or tank water surfaces (most types float). This method is 
cheap, quick, efficient and reliable but does require the discipline to carry out the scheduled 
cleaning. The time interval is dependent on conditions, but cleaning intervals of about 2 weeks 
during the fouling season should be adequate under most conditions. 
Many of the other biofouling control methods depend on the availability of specialized 
processing equipment already there for other purposes. These include filters, sterilizers, and 
heat exchangers. They can all be very effective in reducing biofouling problems. Other 
options, such as chlorination and biofouling resistant surfaces, may be acceptable and 
attractive under some conditions. Chlorination is most likely to be used in a flowing system 
for treating the drain lines. An application of 1-1.5 mg/1 chlorine for 24-48 h every 2-4 
weeks, if allowed by environmental regulations, should suffice to keep drain lines free of 
biofouling. However, this will have no effect on clogging problems. 
6.3 Water hammer 
Water hammer is a transient pressure phenomenon caused by the rapid stopping of flow. 
The rapid deceleration causes a pressure wave to propagate upstream, where it is reflected and 
returned creating an increased pressure pulse at the slowing point. This pressure pulse causes 
a loud 'bang' to be heard followed by others at regular intervals. The intervals are determined 
by the sound velocity in seawater (5000 ft/s or 1500 m/s) and twice the upstream distance 
to the point of reflection. The pressure pulse can have a value several orders of magnitude 
above the normal operating pressures. Due to the widespread use of relatively low pressure 
rated synthetic pipe materials in seawater systems, the transient pressures produced by water 
hammer can easily rupture pipes or blow fittings apart. The magnitude of the pressure pulse 
depends on the average velocity in the pipe, pipe length and rate of valve closure. High 
velocities and long pipe runs are the worst combination. Pipe diameter or flow rate, by 
themselves, are not important. The most common situations producing water hammer are the 
rapid opening of a line resulting in a high velocity flow proceeding down an open pipe and 
suddenly encountering an elbow or almost closed valve, or the closing of a valve in a flowing 
line too rapidly. The quarter turn full-open to full-close ball or butterfly valves commonly 
found in seawater system are particularly dangerous in this regard, since they can be fully 
cycled with a flick of the wrist. If these types of valves cannot be avoided, such valves in 
critical places should be red flagged, have their handles removed, or be locked. 
Fig. 6.2 is a nomograph for calculating water hammer with an example to demonstrate the 
use of the figure. In order to further illustrate the danger, if a typical main supply line from 
a pump house had a velocity of 10 ft/s, a length of 700 ft from the pumps to the valve and

Fig. 6.2. Water hammer nomograph. The pressure pulse due to water hammer can be found by knowing the average 
velocity of the fluid in the pipe, the pipe length, and the valve closing time. The fluid velocity is found on the left 
side of scale (A) and the pipe length on scale (D). These two points should then be connected by a straight line. 
The intersection of this line with scale (C) is noted and connected with a second line to the appropriate value for 
the closure time on the right side of scale (A). The pressure pulse in psi is then read from the intersection of the 
second line with scale (B). The pressure pulse must be added to the existing line pressure to find the maximum 
pressure needed for selecting pipe type and wall thickness. The example shown is for a pipe length of 200 ft, fluid 
velocity of 20 ft/s and a valve closure time of 1 s. The resulting transient pressure pulse has a value of 270 psi. 
the same closure time of 1.0 s, it would produce a pressure pulse of about 500 psi above 
normal pressure. Most synthetic pipes have pressure ratings of only a few 100 psi at best. It 
may require a closure time in the order of 15-20 s to avoid unacceptable pressures. While 
this is a potential problem with a straightforward solution, operating personnel may not have 
the patience to close valves this slowly. Example 6.1 is an example of a real water hammer 
problem with a real system. Its pipe velocity with one pump operating was just sufficient to 
preclude biofouling for decades until pump wear significantly reduced the flow velocity. This 
site has a negligible tide. 
6.4 Frictional losses in pipes 
Frictional losses are usually measured in elevation or head units, which have the dimensions 
of length (ft or m). Sometimes frictional losses are given in pressure losses between two points. 

88 
Example 6.1. Main seawater line water hammer 
The system shown in Table 5.3 was designed with a single 1000 ft long 6 inch (actual ID = 5.72") 
polyethylene main intake line between the pump house and the facility. This was done to save the cost of a 
double line and the pipe was sized to provide sufficient flow velocity to prevent biofouling in the line (see 
Section 6.2). The system was designed to provide 600 gpm with one pump and 1000 gpm with both main 
pumps on. The pressure rating for normal usage of the main pipe is 100 psi. 
(A) What is the minimum closure time for a valve at the end of this 1000 ft supply line to not exceed the 
pressure rating of the pipe due to water hammer for the two design flow rates? 
Since the transient pressure must be added to the normal operating pressure in the line, there is in fact less 
than a 100 psi margin. In the context of this example, the normal operating pressure is unknown but is 
usually half or less of the rating. The rating is usually determined by the shut-off head of the pump (or the 
other way around). The ratings are also usually conservative, especially for very short duration transients. 
Realizing that it may be a bit optimistic, we will assume that the full 100 psi is available. 
600 gpm = 1.33 fi3/s, 
V = Q/A = 1.33/0.1785 = 7.5 ft/s 
1000 gpm = 2.22 ft3/s, 
V = Q/A = 2.22/0.1785 = 12.4 ft/s 
Using Fig. 6.2 with L = 1000 ft and pressure increase = 100 psi 
For V = 7.5 fl/s (600 gpm), 
Tminimum : 4.5 S 
For V = 12.4 fl/s (1000 gpm), Tminimum : 
7.0 S 
(B) What are the minimum closure times if the normal operating pressure at the valve is around 50 psi? 
Using Fig. 6.2 with the same length and velocities but with an allowable pressure increase 
of 50 psi instead of 100 psi 
With 600 gpm, 
Tminimum -- 8.5 s 
With 1000 gpm, Tminimu m : 
11.0 s 
(C) The main seawater valve at the end of the line in this system is in fact a quarter turn full-open to 
full-close valve. What is the transient pressure pulse if the valve is inadvertently closed in one second? 
Using Fig. 6.2, closure time = 1 s, length = 1000 It, and stated velocities 
At 600 gpm get 500 psi pressure increase 
At 1000 gpm get 800 psi pressure increase

where pl - p2 is pressure drop, lb/fl 2 (Pa), h is head loss, fl (m), and ~, is specific weight of 
fluid, lb/fl 3 (N/m 3) 

89 
The value of specific weight varies slightly with temperature and salinity (Table A-3). At 
35 g/kg salinity and 25~ 
1 atm (14.7 psi) is equal to 10.10 m or 33.12 ft of head. In the 
English system of units, it is important to note the units of pressure are expressed as lb/ft 2 
rather than the common units of lb/in. 2. 
There are many factors which effect the frictional head loss in pipes. All of the following 
discussion relates only to pipes running full. Pipes with a free surface are open channels (see 
Section 6.6). While the frictional losses will depend on both fluid temperature and salinity, 
over the range of 1-35 g/kg salinity and 0-40~ temperature, these effects are relatively small 
due to the small changes in the physical properties of water (see Table A-3). 
Other major factors affecting frictional head losses are the specific characteristics of the 
pipe. This includes not only the pipe material but also the existing and future condition 
of the pipe. The condition of the pipe depends on age, velocity and sand load, formation 
of scale, deposition of sediment, and biofouling. There are a number of analytical methods 
for estimating frictional losses in pipes (Davis and Sorensen, 1969). They all use a 'flow 
coefficient', which has various definitions depending on the method. All these coefficients 
are estimated for 'average' or 'normal' conditions, primarily based on freshwater applications 
where biofouling is not generally as severe a problem as in seawater. Therefore, the choice 
of a coefficient value is at best an educated guess as to the current or projected situation and 
is time dependent. Usually, one will carry out the calculations for a 'used' pipe with minor 
biofouling. The head losses for a new pipe will be much lower than for a 'used' pipe, but 
once in operation a new pipe will very soon become a used pipe. The inherent assumption 
is that the lines will be maintained and that biofouling will be controlled. If the lines are 
not maintained, the biofouling will reduce the pipe diameter, increase the pipe velocity and 
dramatically increase the frictional losses, and reduce the flow rate. 
Many pipe manufacturers and engineering texts will present frictional head losses in pipes 
in tabular form (see Table 6.2). The input variables are nominal pipe diameter (which may be 
quite different from the actual inside diameter) and the flow rate. The outputs are the average 
pipe velocity and the frictional head loss per unit length. The total frictional head loss is 
then calculated by multiplying the table value by the number of unit lengths in that pipe run. 
These tables are fine if the assumptions and conditions of the table and the resulting errors 
are acceptable. Most of the available tables are for freshwater (Table 6.2 is for seawater), a 
fixed temperature and assumed pipe type and conditions. Since most tables do not consider 
biofouling, such values should be used conservatively. Depending on conditions, errors from 
use of such tables may or may not be significant. They are useful for preliminary calculations 
but should be checked by more rigorous methods during the detail design phase. Because of 
potential biofouling problems, these tables should be used very conservatively. 
There are a number of methods to calculate estimated frictional losses in pipes. Probably 
the most common method in fluid mechanics texts (Granet, 1989; Roberson and Crowe, 1990; 
Munson et al., 1994) is based on the Darcy-Weisbach equation (6.2). A major advantage is 
that it is readily useable in both metric and English units.

These values should be typical of clean used plastic pipe and seawater. Note assumptions inherent in calculations. They do not include allowance for any 
significant biofouling, which can create much higher losses. Since Schedule 80 pipe has relatively small inside diameters, these values should be conservative for

or drainage in a seawater system. Values do not have allowance for significant biofouling. 
average pipe velocity, isvolumetric flow/pipe cross-sectional flow area, in ft/s (m/s), and g is 
gravitational constant, is 32.2 ft/s 2 (9.81 m/s2). 
While the equation is straightforward, this is not true for getting the proper values for f. 
A parameter called equivalent sand roughness (Ks) must be developed. This is an estimate of 
the roughness of the pipe's interior surface due to basic material, service use and cleanliness. 
Table 6.3 presents values for average conditions. These values are not specifically for seawater 
uses and do not allow for any significant biofouling. If a plastic line has ever been heavily 
biofouled, its values are likely to be in the range of steel to concrete pipe values even after 
rigorous cleaning due to unremovable calcareous deposits. Pipes with significant biofouling 
in effect have reduced diameters. Losses for biofouled pipes can be calculated using the 
estimated effective or available unfouled pipe diameter and high Ks values in the order of 
0.01 ft or 0.003 m. The actual value of equivalent sand roughness to be used in design 
calculations is a function of where the specific length of pipe is situated in the system, the 
natural biofouling characteristics of the water expected to go through the line and the degree 
and quality of the expected maintenance on this section. In short, no simple answer and it 
is best to be conservative. Another needed parameter must be derived from the equivalent 
sand roughness, and this is the relative roughness. Relative roughness is defined as Ks/d and 
is dimensionless. Another non-dimensional factor to be defined is called Reynold's number 
(Re). Reynold's number is used to characterize and compare fluid flow. 
Vd 
Re =

where Re is Reynold's number (non-dimensional), V is average pipe velocity in ft/s (m/s), d 
is pipe inside diameter in ft (m), and v is kinematic viscosity, Table A-3, ft2/s (m2/s). 
The relative roughness and Reynold's number are used to estimate the resistance coefficient 
(f) by use of the Moody diagram (see Fig. 6.3). The relative roughness value is found 
at the fight-hand margin and followed to the left and slightly upward until it intersects a 
vertical coming from the calculated Reynold's number on the bottom margin. The output is 
the resistance coefficient (f), also non-dimensional, which is read by going directly to the 
left-hand margin from this intersection. Most practical applications will fall in the fight half 
and, especially if biofouled, towards the top of the Moody diagram. The read value of f can 
now be inserted into the Darcy-Weisbach equation (6.2) to determine the line's frictional head 
loss.

If the flow goes through several different pipe diameters or if the pipe materials or 
conditions change along the line, each section must be calculated separately with the 
procedures above and the results added to get the total pipe losses. 
Another method for estimating frictional losses in pipes involves the Hazen-Williams 
coefficient (C) and equation. There is a metric (6.4) and an English (6.5) form for this 
equation listed below. 
10.7Q]-85/ 
h - 
(6.4) 
C1.85d4.87 
where Q is flow rate in m3/s, l is pipe length in m, C is the Hazen-Williams coefficient 
(dimensionless), d is pipe diameter in m. 
4.72Q1.85/ 
h - 
(6.5) 
C1.85d4.87 
where Q is flow rate in ft3/s, l is pipe length in ft, C is the Hazen-Williams coefficient 
(dimensionless), and d is pipe diameter in ft. 
One advantage of the Hazen-Williams equations is that the coefficients are independent 
of flow rate and velocity. Useable values for 'used' plastic pipe is C -- 100 and for new 
conditions C - 130. 'Used' concrete pipe is about C -- 60 and new around C -- 100. As with 
the Moody approach, these values do not allow for significant biofouling, assuming that the 
pipes will be well maintained. 

93 
6.5 Frictional losses in fittings 
If a section of pipe has any fittings, equipment or transitions (changes in diameter), these 
items will have additional frictional losses themselves. It must be remembered that both a 
pipe exiting a tank and a pipe flowing into a tank are pipe diameter transitions with associated 
frictional losses. These losses must be calculated separately and added to the pipe losses to get 
the total losses between any two points. The frictional loss will depend on the type of fitting 
or transition, the abruptness of the flow change, the material and the present condition of the 
internal surfaces. Usually only the type of fitting and the abruptness are considered. For some 
fittings, such as valves, there can be considerable variation in losses from one manufacturer 
to another due to internal dimensional differences. Even for more standardized fittings, the 
variations can be as much as 50%. The frictional head loss for any given fitting or transition is 
calculated from the equation below. 
KV 2 
h = 
(6.6) 
2g 
where h is head loss in ft (m), K is loss coefficient (non-dimensional), V is average velocity 
in adjoining pipe in ft/s (m/s), and g is gravitational constant, 32.2 ft/s 2 (9.81 m/s2). 
The loss coefficient (K) is a function of the type of fitting and conditions (see Table 6.4). 
Note that losses are keyed to the velocity in the adjoining pipe and that for transitions it is 
either the upstream or downstream velocities depending on conditions. 
Head losses for some inline components, such as heat exchangers and UV systems, may be 
given by the manufacturer for only the rated flow rate. If the diameters of the inlet and outlet 
pipe are known, a loss coefficient value can be computed. This will allow calculation of head 
losses at other flow rates (see Example 6.2). The engineering assumption is that the K value 
is constant and independent of the flow rate or velocity (if the internal configuration is not 
altered). Head losses and K values will be very manufacturer- and model-specific. 
A length of pipe may contain a large number of fittings and pieces of equipment. Many of 
these fittings may be identical. If the pipe diameter is constant over this length and there is no 
flow branching, the velocity will also be constant. In this case, it is not necessary to calculate 
the head loss for each fitting individually but to take the sum of the K values. With the sum 
of all the contained K values, the head loss from all the fittings can be acquired with one 
calculation and combined with the pipe loss (see Example 6.3). If there is more than one pipe 
diameter or pipe material, the sum of the K values have to be taken separately for the fittings 
associated with each type pipe. 
Another method that might be encountered for finding head losses in pipe fittings involves 
the concept of equivalent length. In this method, the head losses for the fitting are expressed 
in terms of the length of straight pipe with the same head losses. Tabulated data on fittings 
are presented as a factor which is multiplied by the associated pipe diameter to produce an 
equivalent length of straight pipe. 
6.6 Open channel flow 
Seawater flow in open conduits or channels is more common at flow rates much higher 
than those of interest to us. However, it may still occasionally be encountered, especially in

These are approximate loss coefficients for standard fittings and transitions (adapted from Hydraulic Institute, 1979 
and other sources). There is no allowance for biofouling. Threaded fittings will have higher values than flanged 
fittings or solvent welded fittings. Check valves that are not flowing sufficiently to fully open will have much higher 
losses. The loss coefficients are dimensionless. Actual values depend strongly on type of material, specific brand, 
and installation; the typical range of variation may be as large as 4-25 to 50%. 
drains. The advantage of drains is easy access for cleaning and amenability to very much 
higher transient flows, which drains must be able to handle. The channels can be of any shape 
but are often roughly rectangular or semi-circular in cross-section. 
Open channels used for drain lines must be over-sized as the maximum flow will occur 
during draining of tanks or during cleaning. Drains should be designed for at least 10 
times the average flow rate for the system. If possible, they should be covered to preclude 
photosynthetic biofouling in the channels. If the channel fouls, the frictional head losses go 
up. If the frictional head losses exceed the available elevation in the channel, it will no longer 

95 
Example 6.2. Head losses in processing equipment 
A heat exchanger is installed in a 2 inch inside diameter line to heat seawater. The manufacturer gives the 
frictional loss to be 10 psi at the rated flow of 100 gpm. However, this system is designed to flow at 80 gpm. 
What is the expected head loss of the process water through the heat exchanger at a flow of 80 gpm? 
It is first necessary to translate the frictional pressure loss into frictional head loss by using Eq. 6.1. However, 
the fluid properties used by the manufacturer are rarely stated but can be assumed to be freshwater at room 
temperature. 
p~ - p2 : 
10 psi = 1440 lb/ft a 
y = 62.3 lb/fi 3 for freshwater of (0 g/kg salinity), temperature of 20~ (Table A-3C) 
h = (pl - Pz)/V = 1440/62.3 = 23.1 ft 
100 gpm = 0.223 fi3/s, conversion from Table A-1 
2 inch diameter gives a pipe flow area of 0.0218 ft 2 
Fluid velocity : flow/pipe area : 0.223/0.0218 : 10.2 fi/s 
Using Eq. 6.6 
h -- 23.1 -- KV2/2g : K(10.2)2/2(32.2) 
K -- 14.3 can now be used to solve for h at other flow rates. 
As done above, 80 gpm correspond to a flow of 0.178 ft3/s and a resulting average fluid velocity of 8.17 ft/s. 
At 80 gpm the frictional heat loss through the heat exchanger is: 
h--kV2/2g = 14.3(8.17)2/2(32.2)-- 14.8 ft 
Note that a 20% reduction in flow rate results in a 36% reduction in frictional losses. Assuming that 
frictional losses are a linear function of flow can lead to large and important errors. 
be able to flow at the required rate and water will back-up and overflow. There are a number 
of ways to calculate flow velocities and flow capacities but one of the most common is based 
on the Manning equation. The equations in English form are given in Eqs. 6.7 and 6.9, and for 
metric units in Eqs. 6.8 and 6.10 below (see Example 6.4)

Example 6.3. Frictional losses in pipes and fittings 
A 500 ft horizontal length of 2 inch Schedule 40 PVC pipe (actual inside diameter of 2.067 inch) flows 
seawater at 68~ and 35 ppt (g/kg) salinity at a rate of 50 gpm. The pipe includes one open gate valve, four 
90 ~ elbows and ten couplings. What is the average pipe velocity and the total frictional losses for pipe and 
fittings in both head and pressure units? 
Q = 50 gpm = 50/448.83 = 0.111 ft 3/s conversion from Table A-3 
d = 2.067 inch -- 0.172 ft 
Pipe area = 0.0233 ft 2 
Velocity = flow/pipe area = 0.111/0.0233= 4.78 ft/s

Equivalent sand roughness (Ks) = 4.2 x 10 -5 ft from Table 6.3 
Relative roughness -- Ks/d -- 0.00024 
Into the Moody diagram (Fig. 6.3) with Re and Ks~d, read f = 0.020 
Using Eq. 6.2 and pipe length of 100 ft 
h -- flvZ/2gd 
= 0.02(100)(4.78)2/2(32.2)(0.172) = 4.13 ft/100 ft 
The calculation above was done for 100 ft pipe length rather than the total of 500 to enable a comparison to 
losses for a 2 inch Schedule 80 pipe as shown in Table 6.2. Schedule 80, due to its thicker walls and smaller 
inside diameter, has a somewhat higher average pipe velocity of 5.4 ft/s and frictional loss of 5.6 ft/100 ft of 
pipe. Using Table 6.2 directly would have produced quicker and more conservative values. Using the 
calculated value to get total frictional loss for the pipe 
Pipe frictional loss = 5(4.13) = 20.6 ft 
Now for fittings losses using Eq. 6.6 
Fittings losses = (Kvalve q-4Kelbow -k- 10Kcoupling)V2/2g 
= (0.19 + 4(0.85) + 10(0.08))(4.78)2/2(32.2) -- 1.56 ft 
Total head losses -- pipe losses + fittings losses -- 20.6 + 1.56 = 22.2 ft 
Using Eq. 6.1 to convert to pressure units 
Fluid specific weight y = 63.975 lb/ft 3 from Table A-3d 
h = (pl - pz)/y = 22.2 = (pl - p2)/63.975 
Frictional pressure loss = Pl - P2 = 1420 lb/ft 2 = 9.9 psi 
To ensure water drainage the slope must be 0.0013 or greater and to ensure self-cleaning 
the slopes of open channels should be in the range of 0.005 to 0.010 (0.5 to 1 unit of elevation 
for each horizontal length of 100 units). If there are appreciable solids or debris in the flow, 
the minimum slope can go up to 5-fold. Since these slopes required for self-cleaning with 
appreciable solids content are often not possible, drains usually require constant maintenance 
to remove deposited solids.

Example 6.4. Open channel flow 
A central rectangular open channel drain has been cast into the concrete floor of a wet lab. This wet lab has a 
number of large tanks, which need to be periodically drained and refilled. If the channel has a width of 6 
inches (15.24 cm) and a minimum depth of 4 inches (10.16 cm) and a slope of 3/8 inches per foot of drain 
length, what is the maximum rate at which the tanks can be emptied without overwhelming the drain? What 
is the average velocity in the drain under the maximum flow conditions? Calculate these values in both 
English and metric units.

The design of open channels requires some trial and error. The following procedure is 
recommended. 
(1) Estimate design flow based on 10 times average system flow. 
(2) Select likely slope based on site conditions and guess trial channel dimensions. 
(3) Compute flow. 
(4) Compare estimated flow to required flow rate in step (1). 
(5) If necessary, recycle to step (2) with new channel trial dimensions. 
6.7 Momentum in pipes 
When a fluid flowing at constant speed changes direction there is a change in velocity. 
This is due to the vector property of velocity (magnitude and direction) as distinct from the 
scalar property of speed (magnitude only). A change in velocity of flowing mass requires 
an acceleration of that mass to rotate the velocity vector to the new direction. This requires 
outside forces at the bend to maintain static equilibrium. If these forces are not provided, 
the pipe will move until it either breaks or something provides the required forces. These 
forces are usually provided by thrust blocks placed at the bends, which are in turn secured 
to the ground or some other rigid structure. They are generally not provided for very small 
pipes with low fluid velocities, say below about 2 inches (4 cm) in diameter, as the pipe

itself and the pipe hangers placed next to the bend can usually provide these balancing 
forces. 
We will consider only steady state flow (constant speed) in pipes of constant cross-section 
and laying in the horizontal plane. The horizontal assumption lets us assume that the pressure 
inside the pipe is the same on both sides of the bend. The only pressure loss would be due 
to frictional effects (pipe and bend fitting) and under most conditions, for the short distances 
involved from one side of the bend to the other, would be negligible. If one leg of the bend 
is in the vertical plane, there might, or might not, be an appreciable pressure change due to 
hydrostatic effects. We will also ignore the dead weight of the pipe and contained fluid, which 
can be very appreciable, which are in the vertical direction and must be supported at regular 
intervals by mountings or hangers. We will concentrate on the momentum effects, which, for 
our conditions, places all forces to be considered in the horizontal plane. We have to resolve 
all forces into x and y components. Static equilibrium requires that all forces in the x direction 
sum to zero and that all forces in the y direction also sum to zero. We will cut off a section of 
the pipe near the bend to determine the forces involved. The forces include the pressures times 
the areas of the two pipe cuts, the momentum effects and the reaction forces (Rx, Ry) required 
at the bend to sum to zero. The governing equations in the x and y directions are given below.

where p is mass density of fluid (kg/m 3, slugs/ft3); Q is volumetric fluid flow rate (m3/s,

and y directions at bends due to momentum; ~PAx, ~-~PAy is sum of pressure times area 
(force) in the x and y directions. 
The most likely applications of this section are for determining thrust block requirements 
at 90 degree and 45 degree elbows. Example 6.5 provides a numerical example of each of 
these cases. Note the explicit definition of the cut-out elbow sections (control volume) and 
the specified sign convention. Table 6.5 provides 'standard' thrust block details for use with 
flowing water. 
Example 6.5. Thrust block requirements at elbows due to momentum 
You have a 4 inch inside diameter pipe flowing seawater (p - 2.0 slugs/ft 3) at a speed of 5 ft/s in the 
horizontal plane. The pressure in the pipe around the elbow is measured to be 7 psig. Given the control 
volumes and sign conventions specified for each of the elbows below, solve for the required thrust block 
forces (Rx, Ry) for each elbow. These forces are shown on the sketches but without magnitudes or plus or 
minus directions, which remain to be determined. We must first solve for some more dimensionally useable 
numbers from the given data.

Pump Selection 
7.1 Pump options 
There are many types of pumps (see Table 7.1), although very few of them are likely to be 
used as main supply pumps in culturing applications. Axial and mixed-flow pumps are widely 
used in aquaculture, but in low-head high-flow situations. These usually involve grow-out 
operations with ponds or raceways and open-channel flow distribution. Archimedes' screw 
pumps are much rarer but fulfill the same requirements. The highest flow rates of interest to us 
are at the lower extremity for all three of these type pumps. The vast majority of applications 
will use radial (sometimes called centrifugal) pumps. Determining the best type of pump 
for any given application depends on a non-dimensional parameter called specific speed (see 
Fig. 7.1). This parameter, as shown, is a function of the desired flow rate and head conditions. 
Some of the other pump types shown in Table 7.1, such as the reciprocating positive 
displacement pumps, while capable of pumping water, are not very likely to be encountered as 
main seawater supply pumps. Rotary cam and vane type pumps are often used for low pressure 
air blowers in culturing applications. Peristaltic pumps are commonly used as metering pumps 
at very low flow rates. Screw pumps are often used to transport and meter dry chemicals or 
feeds. Air-lift pumps are widely used to circulate seawater in tanks. 
Any project will have quantitative values for average, maximum and minimum flow 
requirements. The maximum and minimum values may be determined by daily or seasonal

are suited for high-flow low-head applications, others are encountered in auxiliary functions. 
Air lift, jet, hydraulic ram pumps, none of which are likely to be used for main seawater 
supply; air lifts are used for circulation in tanks.

requirements. They must include all auxiliary water requirements, and not just the flows 
required for life support. Auxiliary flow requirements such as for backflushing, cleaning tanks 
or refilling tanks can be significant. In addition to present values, there should be an idea of 
possible future requirements. The most severe problems will be encountered if the maximum 
and minimum values are widely different or if the pumping conditions are highly variable, 
such as in areas with high tidal variations. 
When the water requirements vary significantly with time of day, seasonally, or over the 
production cycle, variable speed motors for the pumps may be considered. However, these are 
expensive, may have reduced reliability, and complicate the operation and maintenance of the 
system. A far better method, the dominant one in practice, is to provide sufficient water flow 
to a head box, using it as a buffering device. High transient flow requirements can then be 
satisfied by temporarily drawing down the water level in the head box. Excess water during 
periods of low demand can be short circuited to drain or the input to the headbox reduced 
by a valve on the discharge side of the main pump. Wasting a little water is often a very 
acceptable price for gains in system simplicity and reliability. On centrifugal pumps, throttling 
the pump's discharge will actually reduce the power requirement. The problem is that the 
valve will have to be reopened if the demand increases. If the demands are highly variable 
and prolonged, multiple pumps can be installed. When demand is high, additional pumps in 
parallel can be turned on (see end of Section 7.4). However, turning on two pumps instead of 
one does not double the supply, since the frictional losses are proportional to the square of 
the water velocity. Pumps placed in parallel are often identical, but this is not a requirement. 
Mixing pumps of different capacities can increase flow-rate options and flexibility. However, 
there are restrictions on the selection of parallel pumps (see Section 7.4) and mixing types can 
complicate operations and maintenance. 
There are two separate reasons to install multiple pumps in parallel and it is very important 
to clearly differentiate these functions. One is to provide greater flow rate during periods 
of peak demand, which has already been discussed. The other is to provide redundancy 
in the form of a backup system in the event of failure of the primary pump. The backup 
equipment should never be used for flow peaking, except under the greatest emergency. If 

103 
one gets in the habit of depending on the backup for normal operations, it is no longer a 
backup but a primary. One has, in effect, increased the probability of failure by using multiple 
units, eliminated any backup capability, and increased the consequences of an uncompensated 
for failure by increasing the scale of operations. If greater flow is required, additional 
capacity should be installed. If during the design phase the consequences of failure were 
considered unacceptable without backup, increased scale is unlikely to alter this judgment. 
The temptation to use backup equipment in normal operations should be vigorously resisted 
as false economy. 
The number of pumps needed depends on several factors. If the flow demand is considered 
to be relatively constant, only one pump is needed. If the consequences of failure are severe, 
a second identical pump is needed as a backup. The two pumps are then alternated in service 
as primary and backup. This is a very common situation. If flow demand is quite variable, 
several pumps may be required to meet requirements under different operating conditions. If 
backup is needed, the backup pump should have the same capacity as the largest primary. The 
two largest pumps can then be alternated in service. In this case, the backup can compensate 
for the failure of any given pump. Lastly, there is the question of possibly future increased 
flow requirements. Due to the high cost of pumping equipment, there is reluctance to install 
capacity in the form of larger pipes and pumps for which there is no firm current requirement. 
What can be done is to design the piping system conservatively and provide floor space and 
access to piping for additional pumps without actually installing them. This has two additional 
benefits. It provides more working room around the equipment and enables replacement 
equipment to be installed without requiting prior removal of the older pump. This also avoids 
the high risks that may be associated with operating without a backup during the replacement 
process. If this additional floor space and access to piping have not been provided and the flow 
requirements increase in the future, the practical options to meeting the increased demand 
may be very limited. Adding floor space in a pump house or increasing the main line pipe 
sizes, can easily prove cost prohibitive and require that the whole system be shut down for an 
extended period of time. 
The practicality and flexibility of a pump system is dependent on more than just the 
selection of the pumps. It depends to a great extent on the accessibility to the pumps and 
internal critical parts (such as the impellers), capability to monitor pump performance, and 
flexibility of use inherent in the piping and cross-connections in the immediate area of the 
pumps. The diameter of the suction and discharge lines are often larger than the suction and 
discharge fittings on the pumps. The transitions from the larger pipes to the smaller fitting 
diameters should be as close to the pump as possible, especially on the suction side. This 
will minimize suction-side frictional losses (see next section). Provisions for maintaining, 
cleaning and back-flushing are usually provided in the piping around the pumps. Fig. 7.2 
shows a typical pump installation. This example has two pumps in parallel, only one of which 
is intended to be 'on' at any given time. However, additional pumps could easily be added in 
parallel. This configuration also shows two intake lines and has the capability to back-flush 
either intake line using the other line with either pump or to back-flush the intake lines using 
water from the head or storage tanks. The capability to back-flush the intakes is helpful in 
removing sand and other debris that may collect in the lines and on the intake screens and 
to prevent water that has been standing in unused pipes from contaminating the system on 
start-up.

Fig. 7.2. Generic pumphouse piping example. (1) Suction-side fittings should be the same size as the intake lines. 
This is more costly but reduces critical suction-side frictional losses and increases NPSH margins. Suction-side 
piping is in the horizontal plan and at a specified elevation. Considerable care is required to avoid any air leaks 
on this side, as they can cause mass mortalities due to supersaturation and, at higher levels, pump problems. (2) 
Discharge side is in the vertical plane followed by 90 degree elbow and horizontal run to point of use. (3) These 
valves must be ball or gate valves to allow use of pigs. With quarter turn full open to full close valves, water 
hammer is a serious threat. Operators must be cautioned to open and close valves slowly when the system is 
operating. (4) Pig launchers with arrows in launching directions. Provisions must be made to recover the pigs at the 
ends of the intake and discharge lines. (5) Crossing headers should have X and T fittings with threaded or flanged 
caps on unused faces for accessibility and cleaning. (6) Reducers and expanders are to transition the main pipe 
diameters to the inlet and outlet diameters of the pumps. There is a choice of unions or flanges. These will allow 
the disconnection and/or removal of the pumps without having to damage the piping system. The union/flanges 
may not be necessary if the adjacent valves have union ends. 
There are some additional critical data that are required before anything definitive can 
be stated about the pumps. For the pumps, the most critical values are the water elevations, 
and distances of the pumps from the seawater supply, and from the points of application. 
Hopefully, the elevations and placement of the intakes, pumps, processing equipment, and 
headbox(es) as well as pipe diameters will be design variables that can be changed if problems 
develop during the design process. Matching pump selection to the conditions, which might 
be highly variable, is a very interactive and complex process (see Section 7.4, Walker, 1972). 
It is very easy to get into situations for which there are no acceptable alternatives. 
7.2 Generic centrifugal pump 
Since the vast majority of applications of interest will use radial (centrifugal) pumps, it 
is necessary to consider the characteristics of such pumps. A centrifugal pump is a kinetic 
energy device, which accelerates water from a low to a high velocity and converts the velocity 
into increased pressure or head at the discharge. A centrifugal pump has no capability to 
lift water from a lower level, unless it has been primed and all air has been removed from 
the suction piping and pump body. While 'self priming' centrifugals exist, this capability 
is limited (specified by the manufacturer as a maximum vertical lift) and cannot always be 
relied upon, especially on the first start of a new pump. When starting or restarting centrifugal 
pumps with suction lift, one must assure that the pump is adequately primed or the pump 
may, after a period of time, self-destruct. It is usually very obvious when the pump 'catches'.

Flow Rate 
Fig. 7.3. Generalized centrifugal pump curves. 
The pump may be primed by allowing water from a headbox to flow backward through the 
pump, connecting a vacuum pump to the pump suction or discharge, using a hand pump to 
backflow water through the pump, or by using an available freshwater source (the temporary 
salinity dilution in the head box will generally be insignificant). Backflowing water through a 
pump just before starting it may make the impeller rotate in reverse. Most, but not all, pumps 
can tolerate reverse rotation, so check with the pump manufacturer before attempting this 
procedure. Due to high head losses and biofouling problems associated with seawater, check 
or foot valves on intake lines are not recommended. Reciprocating pumps and other positive 
displacement pumps, are truly capable of self priming if the plunger and valves are tight. 
Centrifugal pump data are specific to each pump. For a given pump body, data are presented 
for a number of different impeller sizes and pump speeds (rotational rate, usually in rpm). 
A generalized pump curve is presented in Fig. 7.3. Usually a given pump and impeller are 
offered with various speed controllers, resulting in a series of essentially parallel curves for 
related equipment packages. Fig. 7.3 shows only one speed option to simplify presentation. 
Information on developed head, efficiency, and power is presented as a function of flow rate. 
The head across the pump (ft, or m) can be converted to a pressure across the pump using Eq. 
6.1. Due to the wide number of pump body, impeller, and speed combinations available, the 
data catalogue from a single pump manufacturer may be 6 to 12 inches thick. 
The actual shape of the head capacity curve is critical to the pump selection process. 
In general, the head capacity curve decreases uniformly from high head/low flow to low 
head/high flow conditions as shown in Fig. 7.3. If the head capacity curve has a flat spot or 
decreases at low flows, the pump may not operate smoothly in this region either by itself or 
in parallel with other pumps. Another characteristic of centrifugal pumps is that as the head 
is reduced, both the flow rate and horsepower increases. Therefore, the maximum current 
requirement to the pump's electric motors will occur at exceptionally high tides and, unless 
the motors are sized for this increased load, they may trip out or burn up. If electrically 

106 
powered pumps have a tendency to trip breakers during unusually high tides, a remedy is to 
very slightly close a valve on the discharge, never the suction, side of a pump. This will reduce 
the electric power requirements to the pump motors. The minimum power requirements will 
occur under high head conditions, such as at low tide or operations against a partially closed 
valve. 
If a discharge side valve is completely closed, the flow is zero and the head will usually 
be at a maximum. This head is called the 'shut-off head'. The pressure (head) rating of all 
piping and components on the discharge side of the pump must be higher than this number or 
catastrophic system failure may occur. This mistake is often made when using plastic pipe and 
hose clamps. A centrifugal pump can be operated for short periods of time against a closed 
valve. If this operation is prolonged, the pump may burn up, as the frictional heat generated 
by the pump is no longer removed by the flowing fluid. When the discharge valve is opened, 
the initial slug of water might have an elevated temperature and pose a thermal shock threat to 
culture organisms if not sufficiently diluted before use or rerouted. 
Generally, centrifugal pumps function best around their region of maximum efficiency. 
Continuous operations far from this region and at the extremities of their performance 
envelope, is not recommended. It may be difficult to find a pump that will stay within its 
operating boundaries under all conditions likely to be encountered, especially if the site has a 
high tidal range. 
Centrifugal pumps require either stuffing boxes or mechanical seals to prevent excessive 
leakage around the pump's shaft. Stuffing boxes use soft plastic-like materials cut in rings 
and tightly fitted around the shaft or shaft sleeve. Stuffing boxes must be lubricated either by 
allowing some water leakage through the packing or by providing a separate cooling flow. The 
stuffing box must never be tightened to the point that cooling flow is stopped; otherwise the 
packing will overheat, shrink and fail. Stuffing boxes require continuous attention and small 
defects can prevent satisfactory operation of the pump. However, they are cheap and rarely 
fail completely without warning. Mechanical seals are much more varied in their designs 
and features. Seals are a technical specialty and the best course of action is to consult the 
pump manufacturer. The right choice of a mechanical seal is an excellent investment and can 
give many years of trouble-free service. Their reliability is very high but when mechanical 
seals fail, it is usually due to excessive vibration or misalignment, rather than any inherent 
seal defect. They can fail spectacularly, emitting high pressure streams of water. This can 
pose an electrical hazard. Spare seals for critical pumps are a good spare-parts item to have 
on-hand, especially if the equipment is remotely located. Mechanical seals can be lubricated 
with water or oil. If freshwater is not available, seawater has been taken from the discharge 
side of a pump filtered through a small cartridge filter and used successfully. Oil leaking into 
the seawater, even in minute quantity, might pose a hazard to delicate culture organisms. More 
acceptable mineral oil can usually be substituted. All such seal questions should be referred to 
the pump manufacturer before implementation. 
Centrifugal pumps are generally well behaved but can develop a number of problems, 
especially when operating conditions change. Table 7.2 is a useful trouble shooting chart for 
such equipment.

7.3 NPSH and dynamic head 
For a centrifugal pump to operate, seawater must enter the eye of the impeller under 
pressure. This pressure is called the available net positive suction head (NPSH) and deals only 
with the suction side of the pump. The design of the intake suction side piping (see Dornaus, 
1976) is particularly important in maximizing the available NPSH. This available NPSH is 
shown in Fig. 7.4. The frictional losses are the sum of the losses from the pipe, fittings and 
screen on the suction side and are calculated as discussed in Chapter 6. The vapor pressure 
of water increases with temperature, further reducing the available pressure at the pump. At a 
water temperature of 32~ (0~ 
it is 0.2 ft and at 100~ (38~ 
it is 2.2 ft. The atmospheric 
head at sea level is normally 33.9 ft (10.6 m). Storms can cause the atmospheric head to drop, 
and values of as low as 29.5 ft (9.2 m) are not uncommon during major storms. This is a loss 
of 4.4 ft (1.4 m). Seawater systems with small operating margins are most likely to fail due 
to suction side limitations when it is least convenient, which is during major storm events. 
Storm-related clogging of screens from seaweed and debris adds to the risk of system failure. 
The available NPSH is shown in equation form below. All components have dimension of 
length (ft or m).

frictional losses on suction side of pump, Hvapor is vapor pressure (absolute) of fluid at given 
temperature. 
There are in fact two NPSH values. One is the available NPSH as defined by Eq. 7.1 
and the other is the minimum required NPSH as specified by the pump manufacturer. The 
required NPSH is usually given with the pump curves as a function of flow rate (see example 
in Section 7.4). It is generally given for the highest speed available for a given pump. 
The required NPSH is a slight function of speed, but using the manufacturer's data will be 
conservative for the same pump and impeller operated at a slower speed. For proper operation 
of a pump, the available NPSH must be greater than the required NPSH. If it is not, the pump 
will not only produce little or no flow but will cavitate and may quickly self-destruct. If a 
cavitating pump operates for prolonged period of time, such as over low tide, it will tend to 
'eat' pump impellers over the long-term (weeks to months). The appearance is like a rapid 
corrosion of the impeller requiting frequent replacement (weeks to months). Cavitation is 
often audible, in the form of a high pitched screeching. 
NPSHavailable must be greater than NPSHrequired 
(7.2) 
The problem is that the available NPSH is not a fixed or constant value. The frictional 
losses in the suction piping is dependent on both flow rate and time. This term is highly 
dependent on the degree of fouling on the screens and intake lines, which can vary with 
time. In addition, the static lift can vary with the tide and the atmospheric head with weather 
conditions. In short, available NPSH must be determined for a range of possible conditions. 
It must be greater than the required value under all possible combinations. Since many of the 
analytical methods lack precision, suitable minimum margins of available NPSH are strongly 
recommended. The margin should be no less than a few feet under the most severe set of 
operating conditions. Not meeting suction side requirements is the single biggest source of 
pumping system problems. 
The major impact on NPSH limitations is determined by the choice of suction-side pipe 
diameters and the design elevation of the pumps. Continuous operation of an intake system in 
areas of high tidal range may require that the pumps be located below the high water or even 
mean water elevation. Construction may be very expensive and difficult, due to the volume 
of earth to be removed and site-dewatering problems. If the minimum elevation of the pump 
is raised, due to cost or construction considerations, the system may not be operable over the 
complete tidal cycle. 
The total dynamic head (TDH) of a seawater system is sometimes called the system head 
and is equal to the head across the pump. It is defined below in Equation 7.3. 
TDH- 
Z 2 - 
Z 1 -+- hps + hfs + hpd + hfd -+- vZ/2g 
(7.3) 
where Z 2 is elevation of discharge at head tank (fl, m), Z1 is elevation of ocean surface (ft, m), 
hps is frictional losses in suction piping (ft, m), hfs is frictional losses in suction fittings (ft, m), 
hpd is frictional losses in discharge piping (ft, m), hfa is frictional losses in discharge fittings 
(ft, m), V is average pipe velocity at discharge to headtank (ft/s, m/s), and g is gravitational 
constant (32.2 ft/s 2, 9.81 m/s2). 
TDH is the sum of the static lift from water source to line discharge (often an elevation 
slightly above the water level of the headbox) and all frictional losses from intake to line 
discharge. The velocity term is often negligible. These frictional losses include piping, fittings 

110 
and processing equipment on both the suction and discharge sides of the pump (see Chapter 
6). The pump itself is ignored in these calculations. Since the frictional losses will be a strong 
function of flow rate, these calculations have to be done for a range of flows. This will produce 
a locus of values as a function of flow rate for a given set of operating conditions. Both 
biofouling and tidal elevations can introduce major variations into these calculations, requiring 
the calculation of completely new curves. It is of course impossible to do these calculations 
at all, unless the piping system has been completely defined as to lengths, diameters, fittings, 
elevations, etc. The iterative nature of the problem is due to the fact that you need a feel 
for the outcome from these calculations before you can specify the inputs. If any operating 
conditions change or if the specifications of any components in the lines are changed or 
altered, the calculations have to be redone. If frictional losses increase by fouling, someone 
partially closes a valve, or smaller diameter components or greater pipe length are introduced, 
then the new curve will swing to the upper left side. Decreased tidal elevations will have 
the same effect. If the tide rises or frictional losses are less than expected, it will swing 
towards the bottom right. Even for a completely specified system, there are many different 
piping configurations and operating conditions. A single valve in the system represents a 
continuous range of possibilities. Each of the possible combinations will produce different 
systems curves. Needless to say, this can require a great deal of 'number crunching'. No 
amount of computer help can make up for wrong assumptions or incorrect input values. 
7.4 Matching system and pump 
The operating point for a piping system and pump in combination is where the pump head 
curve intersects the system's head curve. At this point the total dynamic head is equal to the 
head across the pump. The operating point is specific to a fixed piping system configuration, 
operating conditions and pump impeller and speed. With the specified system, the operating 
point is the only possible set of operating conditions, IF the pumping system is pumping at 
all. In short, if it is pumping, it will do so only at the specific flow rate and TDH. If the 
pump impeller or speed is changed or there are any changes in the system or conditions, the 
operating point will move. 
Given a spectrum of possible system curves, the task is to find a pump that will meet 
the flow requirements and remain within its operating constraints under all conditions. There 
are regions of TDH and flow rate where it is difficult to find pumps. Even in the more 
usual regions, the choices may not represent a continuum. In order to find a match, the 
system specifications may have to be modified. Reduction of suction-side frictional losses or 
lowering the elevation of the pumps are two of the most common changes. Sometimes, due 
to cost constraints, there will be evaluations of possible changes towards smaller or cheaper 
components and elevations with reduced construction requirements. These cost-reducing 
exercises may require changes in operating approaches. A common option in areas of high 
tidal variation is only pumping over a portion of the tidal cycle. While this may reduce 
construction costs, larger pumps and piping as well as greater storage capacity will be 
required to maintain the same average flow rate. In short, the system and pump are an iterative 
design problem with many considerations. 
The pump and system matching process can best be illustrated with an example. The site 
and system information is presented in Example 7.1. This site had a high tidal variation and

the specified system and conditions is tabulated below. These TDH values as a function of flow rate are then 
graphically plotted on the selected pump curve (Fig. 7.5) to determine the interactive operating point of about 
125 gpm between the pump and system at a very low tide.

an average flow requirement of about 150 gpm (9.5 l/s). The normal extreme tide over a year 
ranged from -2 to 18 ft relative to mean low water (20 ft or 6.3 m tide). This is a relatively 
severe requirement for continuous operations. Fortunately, it was on a very benign coast, 
with very low probability of additional storm effects. It was necessary to design for both the 
extreme low-tide (Example 7.1) and high-tide (Example 7.2) operating conditions. Note that 
both the suction and discharge sides are completely specified as to lengths, pipe roughness and 
loss coefficients of fittings and transitions. At high tide the pump is below the water level with 
a suction head. The TDH data from the tables for low and high tide are plotted over the pump 
curve for a specific pump in Fig. 7.5. Note that the pump is specified not only as to model but 
also as to impeller and speed. All the data irrelevant to this specific set of conditions have been

superimposed on the selected pump curve (Fig. 7.5) and yield a high tide operating point of about 290 gpm.

Flow Rate 
Fig. 7.6. Two identical pumps in parallel. The curve for a single pump is supplied by the manufacturer but the 
curve for two in parallel must be developed from the supplied information. At every value of pump head, such as 
hi shown, the value of the flow rate for two pumps can be found by doubling the value X for a single pump to 
develop the two pump curve. The system curve is the same as developed for finding the operating point with one 
pump operating (A). The operating point for two pumps operating is seen to be the intersection of the systems 
curve and the two pump curve at point B. 
removed from the figure. The limits of the pump's operating range and the required NPSH 
have also been specified by the manufacturer and are also shown in Fig. 7.5. The operating 
point at low tide produces a flow of about 125 gpm (7.9 l/s) and 290 gpm (18.3 l/s) at high 
tide. Intermediate tidal elevations will fall between these extremes. Computation of total or 
average flows over a day will require the estimation of tidal elevations and resulting flow rates 
at periodic intervals, such as hourly, over one or two tidal cycles, depending on if there are 
equal or unequal daily tides. The NPSH margin between the available and required NPSH is 
10.1 ft (3.2 m) at low tide and 21.6 ft (6.8 m) at high tide. These are very ample margins and 
allow for biofouling and other contingencies. At low tide the suction lift is 17 ft, which is 
below the maximum repriming lift of 19 ft specified by the manufacturer for the stated pump 
speed. Irrespective of the margin, the operator should always assure the pump's 'catching' 
before going on to other things. 
Another common situation is where more than one pump in parallel is 'on' at any given 
time. If pumps are identical or have identical head curves, there usually will be no problems. 
The important point is that the second pump must have a shut-off head higher than the 
existing head in the pump discharge manifold or it will not be capable of starting. If we 
assume two identical pumps in parallel, each with a head curve as shown in Fig. 7.6, and a 
single pump operating point given as point A, what will be the capacity if both are turned 
on simultaneously? This is a common question. The pump curve for both pumps operating 
together must be constructed. This is done by adding their capacities at every value of head. 
The systems curve, assuming no changes in the system or external operating conditions, will 
now form a new operating point at intersection B. This may or may not be close to a doubling 

114 
of flow depending on conditions. If the systems curve intersects the single pump operating 
curve near its shut-off head the gain from the second pump will be small and very possibly 
outside of the operating requirements. If point A is at a small fraction of the shut-off head, the 
gain may be large. This is important to consider, if adding pumps in the future is a serious 
possibility. A little extra initial expense, in the form of larger pipes and fittings, especially on 
the suction side, producing lower system frictional losses, will buy options for the future as 
well as reducing energy costs in operations. 
If in the future, more flow is desired, one possible way to get it is to install a larger pump 
motor with a higher rotational speed. This approach is usually relatively cheap compared to 
adding an additional pump in parallel. If the original design was conservative, especially on 
the suction side, it will often work. This is one reason that suction side piping is often of

Example 7.3. (continued) 
(A) If the 1134 rpm speed controller is chosen and the pressure differential across the pump is measured in 
operation to be 19.1 psi, what is the seawater flow rate, the required net positive suction head at the pump 
intake and the average velocity in the pipe? 
/ 
Head across pump = pressure/specific weight -- (19.1)(144)/64.1 -- 42.9 ft. 
Specific weight from Table A-3. Note that this head corresponds to that at the 1134 operating 
point confirming the validity of the systems curve. 
Intersection of system curve and pump curve for 1134 rpm, read Q = 4 ft3/s. 
By reading down from the operating point to the NPSH required curve and then to the scale at right, 
the required NPSH = 4 ft.

deficit? 
Required NPSH -- 4 ft

has changed except the pump's spin rate. Graphically determine the new flow rate, the required NPSH and 
head across the pump. The new flow and pump head could also be calculated by assuming the pump's 
discharge and head coefficients to be constant.

larger diameter than the discharge piping. Note that in Example 7.3, both the suction and 
discharge piping is of the same diameter. In this example, the system does not meet its NPSH 
requirements at higher pump speeds. Unfortunately, major concerns with initial cost result in 

116 
systems that are NPSH limited both at faster speeds and with added pumps in parallel. This 
type of system has limited expansion potential without major costs. The savings in the initial 
costs are often relatively small.

Materials Selection 
8.1 Biological constraints 
Selecting materials for use in marine culturing systems involves several major sources of 
problems. One set of constraints is due to the potential toxicity of many common construction 
materials. Materials may leach out or release specific ions, chemicals, or corrosion by-products 
from their surfaces. These released substances, in most cases, may not be clearly identified. 
The rates of release depend strongly on natural conditions (temperature, water velocity, 
dissolved oxygen level, pH, etc.). The rates may also be time-dependent, being generally 
highest with 'new' materials. Whether these released materials are toxic to a marine organism 
is an important subject, but one for which hard answers are often lacking. Toxicity is not only 
species-specific, but also a function of the total environmental conditions and the specifics 
of the age, genetic strain, history, and present health of the target organisms. At high levels, 
the effects are obvious m mortality. Considerable data are available on lethal levels of many 
substances, although these chemical forms might be somewhat different from those released 
from construction materials and the interpretation of the data to real situations is often very 
debatable. At lower levels, toxicity may result in reduced growth, susceptibility to disease or 
cannibalism and decreased survival rates. These symptoms may not even be obvious and it 
may be difficult to separate potential materials-related problems from other chronic stresses 
producing the same effects. 
There are very little direct data on toxicity of potential seawater system materials on 
delicate organisms, and what data exist sometimes seems contradictory (see Appendix F). 
Most of these data have been generated from short-term tests for lethal effects on marine 
phytoplankton. The assumption is that marine phytoplankton are very sensitive and can be 
used as a limiting case or 'representative' organism. Whether delicate larval forms of many 
marine animals are less sensitive than phytoplankton under any given set of circumstances, 
is certainly debatable. In the absence of more specific data, the algal data as summarized 
by Blankey (1973) can be used as a preliminary material selection guide for biological 
acceptability (see Table 8.1). 
There are no construction materials that are acceptable for all purposes, especially for 
culturing of larval forms and for research applications. This even includes plastics and glass, 
which may be toxic to some degree. Toxicity can be primarily temporary or it can be more 
permanent. Even such common seawater system materials such as polyethylene and polyvinyl 
chloride, are usually initially toxic and should be conditioned in running seawater for at least 2 
weeks before use with marine organisms. The reduction in toxicity can be due to the removal 
of surface coatings (sometimes applied to prevent the sticking of hot plastics to other surfaces 
during manufacturing), the leaching out of solvents from the near surface, or by the formation

of protective coatings, which separate the seawater from contact with the toxic material. In the 
past, lead pipes were often used in marine laboratories because they were readily acceptable 
after such aging due to the impermeability of the surface oxide. However, if the mechanism is 
a protective coating, a 'good' cleaning could renew the toxicity. Machining-off or removing 
the surface layer of a seawater-aged plastic pipe may rejuvenate the toxicity. When there is any 
doubt (there always will be doubt, if one is dealing with sensitive organisms), a sample of the 
material from the same batch as is to be used, after pre-leaching in running seawater, should 
be tested for toxicity with the culture organism. If the test organisms die, the materials are not 
acceptable. All adhesives, paints, and coatings that are to be used should be similarly tested. 
The 'same batch' requirement is due to the fact that manufacturers, especially of plastics and 
adhesives, often change their formulations or manufacturing processes without notification. In 
the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency is requiting all sealants, paints, and coatings 
to be reformulated to reduce Volatile Organic Carbon (VOC) releases. This may be far worse 
as instead of high initial toxicity followed by acceptable toxicity, there may now be long-term 
chronic effects from the new formulations. One batch may be good and another bad. Some 
synthetic materials exhibit persistent toxicity and should be avoided. For example, Hyperion 
tank liners in seawater have been found to be toxic to marine phytoplankton for more than 2 
years. The possibility of long-term subtle effects, even from 'acceptable' materials may still 
exist. 
While it is generally considered good practice to eliminate all metals from contact with 
culture water, this is often not done. It is difficult, if not impossible, to acquire high-precision, 
high-temperature, and high-strength parts made of more biologically acceptable materials, 
especially at reasonable costs. These materials are often not basically suited for these types of 
uses, although composite technology is advancing rapidly. Some metals, such as titanium, ap- 
pear to be biologically inert and therefore biologically acceptable. Titanium heat exchangers, 
while expensive, are found in a number of seawater culture systems. Other metals, particularly 
steel and cast iron, are commonly used, because they are cheap and available, compared to 
more preferred materials. While rust may be unsightly, steel and cast iron have little or no 
direct toxicity and in modest amounts rust may often be biologically acceptable. In particular, 
it may be possible to get relatively cheap and reliable pumps made from these materials. Stain- 
less steel components are also commonly used, particularly 316 stainless steel, because a con- 
siderable amount of industrial equipment is available in this material. Stainless steel will cor- 
rode in seawater under some conditions (see Section 8.2) and its corrosion products are toxic. 
Stainless steel components should only be used with considerable caution. Even potentially 
objectionable materials, such as copper alloys, can be safely used in small quantities if the sea- 
water flow is high and the contact time with the water is short (Huguenin and Ansuini, 1975). 
An individual brass or bronze fitting or valve under conditions of high flow rate might be used, 
due to its availability, without any apparent ill effect. However, it is important to remember 
that if flow rates decrease, toxicity problems may result. As a general rule, the amounts of 
potentially toxic materials in the system should be reduced to an absolute minimum. 
Flow-through systems can often take small amounts of objectionable material without 
ill effects, but this is not true in reuse loops. Metallic ions, organic solvents, and other 
leachates can quickly build up to dangerous levels. While the clinical signs might be obvious, 
identifying it as a material problem and then identifying the specific source may be very 
difficult. As has been discussed, all materials can be potentially toxic or objectionable under 

120 
some conditions and great caution must be exercised. Material toxicity problems produce 
clinical signs that are similar to many other sources of culture stress. 
8.2 Seawater constraints 
One set of constraints involved with the selection of materials for use in marine culturing 
systems is due to the engineering properties and life time of materials immersed in seawater. 
Unfortunately, most materials dissolve or corrode to some degree in seawater, some faster 
than others. In addition, seawater often contains organisms, both large and microscopic, that 
like to eat, burrow into or otherwise destroy materials, including wood, concrete and synthetic 
materials. In addition, there are natural processes associated with seawater that physically and 
chemically destroy materials. These include abrasive particles in high current flows, wave 
forces, biofouling effects and a number of possible problems from ice. Thus, it is often 
difficult to find biologically acceptable materials that will meet the engineering requirements 
and last for long periods of time in seawater. Selecting marine materials is an engineering 
specialty (Tuthill and Schillmoller, 1965; Dexter, 1979) and may require special assistance, 
especially for large projects. 
On exposure to air or oxygenated water metals will form oxides. Most of these oxides are 
protective, in the sense that their formation slows or inhibits further corrosion. The notable 
exception is carbon or structural steel, where rust does not preclude deeper oxidation. For 
many metals, corrosion tends to be uniformly distributed over the material, such as with 
copper alloys, and for others, such as stainless steels, all the corrosion tends to occur at 
specific places in the form of deep pitting. Most of these oxides are relatively soft and can be 
removed by water flow, especially if the flow contains abrasive particles. Therefore, corrosion 
rates for most metals increase with increasing fluid flow. The exceptions are the chromium 
(including 316 and 304) and nickel (400 series) stainless steels, which have very hard oxides 
and much higher corrosion rates at very low velocities and under stagnant conditions. For 
the stainless steels, lack of flow inhibits the removal of the acidic corrosion products from 
the bottom of the pits and reduces the transport of oxygen into the pits needed to form the 
protective oxides. These low oxygenated areas that promote rapid local corrosion can also 
occur in corners, cracks and under washers, nuts or biofouling. This mechanism is called 
an oxygen concentration cell or crevice corrosion. In stagnant water, stainless steels can 
corrode very quickly. This can be important when pumps with stainless steel components are 
turned off. All corrosion mechanisms are also temperature-dependent and higher temperatures 
increase corrosion rates. 
If two conductive materials are immersed in seawater and electrically connected, a battery 
or galvanic cell is formed. These conductive materials include not only the metals, but also 
carbon, which is a common material for heat exchangers and pump linings. In such a cell, the 
more electronegative material will be the anode and will corrode. The more electropositive 
material will be the cathode and will be protected from corrosion. Fig. 8.1 shows the relative 
potentials of common marine materials. While the precise values of electropotential are 
dependent on velocity and temperature, the relative positions of the materials will not be 
substantially altered for different conditions. Table 8.1 is therefore useful even at conditions 
other than those specified. Note that the potentials are not points but ranges of values. These 
values cover the variability of cleanliness, surface oxides and composition from different

sources for the given material. In any combination of two materials, the one on the fight will 
corrode and the one on the left will not. If their ranges overlap, you cannot be sure which one 
will in fact be the anode. The stainless steels have two ranges of values. The one on the fight 
is called the active state, and is often associated with stagnant water conditions, low dissolved 
oxygen, and rapid corrosion. The one on the left is the passive state. 
Another factor affecting the corrosion rate on the anode in a galvanic cell is the relative 
exposed surface areas of the anode and cathode. This is called the area ratio. If the corrosion 
rate (in thousands of an inch/year or mg/cm 2 per year) is X with both materials having the 
same area, and the cathode area is then increased to 10 times the anode area, the corrosion 
rate will now be about 10X. The converse linear proportionality also holds. If the cathode area 
is reduced to 1/10 of that of the anode, the corrosion rate on the anode drops to about 1/10X. 
Small dimensionally critical components (shafts, beatings, seals, impellers, etc.) should be 
designed to be the cathode and the large dimensionally non-critical parts to be the anode. 
Also the cathodes should be painted and anodes should generally not be painted or covered. 
Small 'holidays' in the coating of the anode may see a very large and unfavorable area ratio 
and experience a phenomenal corrosion rate. The bi-modal behavior of the stainless steels 
coupled with an unfavorable area ratio as they switch from cathode to anode explains why 
these materials may be satisfactory for a long period of time and then suddenly will corrode 
rapidly. This is most common with stainless impellers in pumps that have been 'off'. 
There are a number of other marine corrosion mechanisms but they would rarely be 
encountered in seawater culturing systems. For these less common forms of corrosion see 
Tuthill and Schillmoller (1965). 
8.3 Piping materials 
Table 8.2 presents the most common piping materials used in seawater culturing systems. 
While they all have been successfully used, the labels can represent a wide variety of 
different chemical compositions, mechanical properties and physical characteristics or forms 
(see Dexter, 1979). The caveats in Section 8.1, about the biological acceptability of any 
components made from these materials, must be assured on an individual basis. These 
materials are used because they are available from other types of applications. Occasionally 
more exotic piping materials (glass, Teflon, etc.) are used in culturing systems but are 
generally very expensive and available components are limited. 
Rigid PVC is probably the most common piping material. It is widely used in wet lab areas 
for seawater distribution and drainage. It is available with thick walls for threaded applications 
(Schedule 80) and thinner walls (Schedule 40) for joining by solvent welding or flanging. 
Because of its rigidity, it is not particularly suitable for in-ground or offshore placement. 
Uneven bedding support will cause stress concentrations and distortions in the pipe and it is 
not flexible enough to adjust to the existing profile without failing. It is also prone to cracking, 
especially when cold. An additional hazard on the suction side of pumps is minute leaks in the 
many couplings required to join PVC pipe. Any air leakage could lead to mass mortalities due 
to gas supersaturation. Water leakage into the system could also be detrimental. PVC piping 
is readily available, easy to work with and is usually affordable. However, when comparing 
costs on piping materials it is necessary to include the many required couplings, which can 
significantly increase the cost.

Polyethylene is probably the most common piping material for main seawater and drain 
lines and is available in different densities, of which the higher densities are more commonly 
used in marine applications. It is also available in different wall thicknesses with different 
pressure ratings and in a wide range of pipe sizes. Since it is widely used for industrial 
and municipal water distribution, it is readily available and relatively cheap. It can be 
very quickly welded together by thermal fusion, but requires special equipment. Fusion-butt 
joints are usually neat and stronger than the basic pipe. Long sections can be quickly 
joined into a homogeneous flexible pipe. It is available in individual lengths or it can be 
shipped prefabricated to the correct length with flanged ends and coiled with a radius of 
about 15 pipe diameters. Its flexibility makes handling and deployment easier and allows 
it to adapt to gradual changes in the bedding of a prepared trench. Solid joints make it 
attractive for suction-side applications, greatly reducing the possibility of air ingestion and gas 
supersaturation. It is likely to be the preferred pipe material for offshore intake and discharge 
piping for both practical and economic reasons. One potential problem with all the plastics, 
high density polyethylene in particular, is the possibility of collapse under partial vacuum on 
the suction side of a pump. The problem is not the pressure rating of the pipe but the care with 
which these sections are emplaced. If the pipe is bent or has a flat spot or out of roundness 
(ellipticity) due to local stresses, it will be much more prone to collapse. All bends should 
be very gradual. The solution is thicker walls on the sections near the pumps and careful 
installation (see Fig. 5.4). 
Fiberglass piping is generally used when the strength or pressure ratings of the plastics 
prove to be inadequate. It is also useful for higher temperatures than most plastics. Generally, 

124 
temperatures above the practical range for plastic pipe are not common in culturing systems. 
Exceptions are at the seawater discharge of heat exchangers or in low pressure air distribution 
system fight near the compressor. High temperatures will tend to weaken and melt the 
plastics and will also tend to leach out any volatile components in the plastic, with possible 
resulting toxicity. Fiberglass is more expensive than any of the plastics and is not as readily 
available. 
Concrete pipe is widely used industrially, readily available and usually rather cheap to 
purchase. It is variable in its properties and may be reinforced or not reinforced, and comes 
in large diameters. When its cost is compared to other large diameter pipes, it usually is 
at least initially attractive. However, transportation and installation costs of concrete pipe 
are significantly higher than for plastic or fiberglass pipe. Concrete pipe is heavy and 
hard to handle. For large diameter pipe, installation may require specialized equipment and 
experienced contractors. In addition, because of sealing problems between sections and the 
high probability of air or water leakage, it should not be used on the suction side of pumps. 
Steel pipe with an inside liner of plastic is an attempt to get the biological and chemical 
advantages of the plastic lining material and the mechanical and cost advantages of steel. It 
is most likely to be used in piping and fittings around pumps. Unfortunately, the bonding 
between the pipe and liner tends to fail and when they suddenly separate the liner material 
may clog the pipe or pump. After removal of the lining, you have some rusting steel pipe, 
which may or may not be acceptable. Steel pipe, if biologically acceptable, has a strong 
advantage in applications requiting high strength and impact resistance. Such an application 
could be for main lines on a rocky coast with high exposure to the sea and the possibility of 
frequent impacts by rocks and other debris. 
8.4 Pump materials 
Seawater pumps are available in a wide variety of materials (INCO, 1976), including 
many metals, carbon, fiberglass and plastics. Pumps may have homogeneous parts made 
from different materials or may only be coated or lined with these materials. It is unlikely 
that any of the available pumps were designed specifically for marine culturing applications. 
Therefore, some care must be exercised in the selection of pump materials (see Example 8.1). 
The materials that might be most biologically desirable, carbon, fiberglass, and plastics, 
do not generally have the mechanical or physical properties best suited for pump use. Again, 
biological acceptability must be determined on an individual basis and not assumed. Carbon 
readily cracks, and does not have the strength or abrasion resistance often required. Pumps 
made with these materials are primarily used in specialized applications in chemical process 
industries. They are not generally designed to pump abrasive particles, safely pass large solid 
objects or operate over a wide range of conditions. In culturing applications, they can readily 
cause operating, maintenance and spare parts problems. Since they are specialized, they tend 
to be very expensive, often custom items, and the selection may be very limited. However, in 
recent years a number of equipment suppliers specializing in aquaculture have emerged. They 
carry a limited amount of fiberglass and plastic pumps with (presumably) a good track record 
in culturing applications. Chapter 7 discusses in detail the problems of matching the system 
to the pumps. Limited selection of pumps can considerably complicate the design process and 
may result in major compromises in overall system performance or flexibility. 

125 
Example 8.1. Suitability of pump materials for use in seawater 
You have a need to pump 10,000 gpm of seawater (70~ 
30 g/kg salinity) into an elevated channel. The total 
head across the pump, including both frictional losses and static lift, is expected to be 10 ft or less. You have 
found a locally manufactured vertical turbine or axial pump with a very good service record in irrigating 
cranberry bogs with freshwater. These pumps can be driven with a wide variety of engines (you have a few 
readily available) or the power takeoff of a tractor across many speeds and operating conditions. Assume an 
operating speed of 1000 rpm. Since these pumps are very simple in design and locally used in agriculture, 
they are very inexpensive relative to more widely known brands. You have considerable economic incentives 
to use these pumps, if they are judged to be suitable for the given application and for use with seawater.

the most reactive to most noble, cast iron-low-alloy steel-bronze. Cast iron and low-alloy steel 
overlap. The biggest pieces (lower body and large propeller) are likely to be the anode, are likely to 
corrode uniformly and are not dimensionally critical. 
Good prospects for satisfactory seawater service. 
Note: A number of these inexpensive pumps in several sizes up to 20,000 gpm gave excellent long-term 
service with seawater at a Central American shrimp farm. 
Pumps made of cast iron and steel are readily available with a wide selection, are cheap, 
and often very reliable. These materials under many conditions are biologically acceptable, 
especially in limited applications such as pumps. The cheapest pump impellers are carbon 
steel. Abrasive particles such as sand and cavitation due to inadequate suction-side conditions 
can seriously reduce the lifetime of steel impellers. Under these conditions harder but more 
expensive impeller materials should be considered. These include specialized steel alloys and 
stainless steels. If available, titanium would also be an excellent choice. In all this, it is 
important to remember the significance of Fig. 8.1. The electropotentials of all the materials 
exposed to seawater and electrically connected must be considered. The small high precision 
parts (shaft, beatings, impeller, etc.) must be the cathode and the large non-critical parts the 
anode (usually the pump body). Sacrificial anodes, such as zincs, are usually not realistic in 
culture systems because of the toxicity of their corrosion products.

8.5 Marine concrete 
Concrete is often used around seawater for items such as tanks, channels, bases for intakes 
and piping. It is an excellent and very adaptable marine material and methods for handling 
it, even underwater, are available (Gerwick, 1969). By using various aggregates, additives or 
techniques it can be made with densities of as low as 30 lb/ft 3 (which if sealed will easily 
float) to as much as 220 lb/ft 3. Normally, it is about 150 lb/ft 3. It can be dense and highly 
impermeable to seawater or completely porous. Its properties appear to get better with time 
in seawater. Under extreme conditions, it is subject to erosion by abrasive materials carried 
by strong currents and waves and poor quality concrete can be bored into by tropical marine 
mollusks. Unless foreseen during design, freeze-thaw cycles on exposed concrete can be very 
destructive. 
Concrete is often reinforced with steel to improve its structural properties. When steel is 
included, great care has to be taken to assure that seawater or any form of salt does not 
get to the steel. Common mistakes include inadvertently allowing salt into the mixture. Salt 
can get in from poor choices of sand, aggregates, chemical additives, and use of brackish or 
seawater in the mix. Salt corrodes the steel, which expands and cracks the concrete, letting 
in more seawater. If such a mistake is made it will be obvious within a few years. Properly 
prepared reinforced concrete (Table 8.3) may last forever in seawater. Cover is the minimum 
distance from the outside of the concrete to the shallowest steel reinforcement. Covers of as 
low as 3/16 to 1 in. are adequate with dense impermeable concrete. Irrespective of what the 
construction specifications say, it is important to assure the placement and minimum cover 
of the steel before the concrete is poured. Using a sealer, such as epoxy, waxes or paints, is 
usually not necessary with top quality concrete but can be beneficial with more common types 
of concrete. Another sealing method is using a thin layer of superior concrete over a lower 
quality core. 
8.6 Problem areas 
In practice, preferences of materials have to be balanced against cost considerations. It is 
interesting to note that similar materials can have greatly varying costs depending on how 
they are specified and where they are purchased. Recent years have seen ever increasing 
industrial and non-culturing uses of synthetic pipes and components. Substantial savings can 
be achieved by considering such mass produced and readily available equipment. The less 
exclusive the market of the supplier, the lower the prices are likely to be. Large catalogue

stores, especially for smaller sizes of equipment, can be good sources of materials and 
components. The specialized aquaculture equipment suppliers should also be checked. Since 
a big part of the cost of components such as plastics is due to the basic materials costs, thinner 
gauges, such as those used in drainage applications, can also lead to savings if the mechanical 
properties and pressure ratings are acceptable. 
While potential toxicity problems from seawater-system components is obvious, there are 
many less obvious potential sources of toxicity. These include paints, insulative materials, 
and wood preservatives in the building. Toxicity can be introduced into the water directly 
from the air, especially if the building gets hot, or with small particles that might fall into 
culture water, possibly from above with condensation or carried by air currents. As an 
example, a 'no pest strip' hung in a hatchery to control flies, can completely preclude larval 
culturing. The occasional dripping of condensation or the dropping of insulative material from 
overhead piping may result in toxicity problems. All building materials and supplies used in 
building maintenance should also be checked for toxicity, especially if one plans to work with 
delicate organisms. Creosoted pilings and organotin antifouling boat paints (no longer legally 
available), if situated near intakes, can also produce toxicity problems. Paints, bug sprays, 
cleaners and solvents should be used around culturing systems only with great care, if at all. 
Another source of problems can be the low pressure air often used in culture operations. 
The air could at times be contaminated. This could occur from the ingestion of automobile 
or diesel generator exhausts under some conditions or oil from the compressor. Oil lubricated 
compressors should not be used without the use of oil traps. Regenerative or carbon-vaned 
blowers are more desirable. Carbon-vaned units throw carbon particulates that may clog the 
gills of delicate organisms or merely be unsightly. If high pressure building air is to be used, 
it must be filtered to remove any oil, water or particulates before use. Air, which has been 
rapidly compressed, can get quite hot. If the air is very hot, it can leach volatile materials 
from synthetic pipes. As an example, an air system with one compressor 'on' may produce 
only warm temperature in downstream piping. Infrequently, multiple compressors may be 'on' 
simultaneously, producing elevated temperatures downstream. The first few times this is done, 
it may produce mortalities, reduced growth or other biological problems. In complex systems, 
such correlations are not always noted.

Seawater Flow Control 
9.1 Gravity flow 
Flow control means knowing what the distribution of seawater flow is to the various parts 
of the system and having sufficient control to adjust it to whatever flow is desired. It also 
means that these flows will be stable over time and reliable. This requires control over the fluid 
head or pressure within the system. In a gravity flow situation, this means control over either 
the water elevation in the head tank or the discharge elevations. Controlling the frictional 
head loss between the head-tank water elevation and the discharge is also critical in gravity 
systems. 
Fig. 9.1 shows a typical gravity flow situation from a head tank, which also serves as an 
emergency supply (see Section 5.15). The various priorities of use in emergencies can be 
reflected by the elevation of the taps into the head tank. Taps for large-flow low-priority or 
noncritical uses would be highest and taps for critical high-priority uses would be near the 
bottom. If the distribution system between the head tank and the point of application has low 
frictional losses (see Sections 6.4 and 6.5) relative to the driving head (H) and the water 
elevation in the head tank is constant, the flow rate can be well controlled, stable with time

and reliable. If the losses are an appreciable fraction of H, the flow rates will change every 
time conditions on any of the branches of that distribution system are altered. The mainlines 
should, therefore, be very generously sized to virtually eliminate frictional losses and in-line 
processing equipment removed or minimized (see Example 9.1). Since the lengths involved 
are often short, this is usually not a hardship. Example 9.1 shows the interactive properties 
of pipe velocity and resistance coefficient at low Reynolds numbers. A general guide is that 
if the valves are sized to keep the pipe velocity at 1 ft/s (0.3 m/s) or less, that all the valves 
can be operated independently. However, the reduced velocity will increase the sedimentation 
and biofouling in these lines, requiring more frequent servicing to maintain the low friction. 
However, another advantage of low pipe velocity is that the thrust blocks at pipe ends can 
usually be omitted. Thrust blocks are often required to hold pipes in bends due to momentum 
effects of changing flow directions (see Section 6.7). 
The discharge elevation is often very easy to control at the point of application, since it 
Example 9.1. Flow control with constant head tank and discharge elevations 
You have a laboratory distribution system similar to Fig. 9.1 with a large constantly overflowing head tank 
and a distribution system made with 'large' diameter piping and terminating immediately below a header 
pipe with distributed 'small' ball valves at a fixed elevation. The valve discharge is to the air and presumably 
over a tank. You wish to limit the amount of water that can be used at any specific point of application to 
0.0005 m 3/s (about 8 gpm) for each user. The elevation difference between the water level in the head tank 
and the valve discharge is 4 m. 
(A) What size small valve should you use? If the piping is 'large', it can be assumed that the only frictional 
lose in the line is at the small valve. This also means that no matter what each user does with his valve he 
cannot substantially impact anyone else's flow rates. Using Bernoulli's equation, which is a more general 
form of Eq. 7.3 without a pump (TDH -- 0), with Point 1 on the water surface of the head tank and Point 2 
being in the discharge plane of the valve, y~ hf is the sum of the piping losses between Points 1 and 2 as 
defined in Eq. 6.2 and y~ hi the sum of the fitting losses as defined in Eq. 6.6. The Zs are the elevations at 
the respective points. 
vZ/2g + P1/Y -k- Z1 -" vZ/2g + P2/Y -k- Z2 -'[- Y~ he + ~_, hi 
The pressure at Points 1 and 2 are both atmospheric or zero gage pressure. Assuming a 'large' head tank, the 
velocity at the head-tank water surface is also zero. The seawater velocity at Point 2 depends on the 'size' of 
the valve. Putting in the zeros and replacing ~ hi with Eq. 6.6 produces the following: 
Z1 - 
Z2 -- 4 m = vZ/Zg + KvVZ/Zg = (1 + Kv)VZ/Zg = (1 + 0.2)V2/2(9.81) 
We get the 'small' ball valve loss coefficient (Kv) from Table 6.4. We now have one equation and one 
unknown. Solving for V2 = 8.09 m/s. Now solving for the cross-sectional diameter that will produce the 
maximum stated flow at this velocity: 
Velocity = flow rate/cross • area = 8.09 m/s = O.O005/(rcd2/4) 
Solving for the diameter d: 
d = 0.0089 m = 0.89 cm (about 1/2 inch valve) 
Now valves come only in discrete sizes and the nominal size may not correspond to the actual flow diameter, 
so some adjustments have to be made in valve selection. 

131 
Example 9.1. (continued) 
(B) What is the minimum size of the 'large' pipe that will make the pipe losses 2% of the previous total 
frictional losses with the valve fully open? Let us assume an 'equivalent pipe' length of 25 m. We will 
neglect losses from fittings and transitions or include them in the specified 'equivalent' length (see Section 
6.5 for discussion). We will also estimate from experience a fairly clean plastic 'smooth' pipe with a 
resistance coefficient = 0.03. 
Total losses before = elevation head - velocity head 
-- 4 - v2/2g = 4 - (8.09)2/2(9.81) = 0.66 m 
2% of 0.66 = 0.0132 m, so 
pipe losses = flV2/2gd 
(Eq. 6.2) = O.03(25)V2/2(9.81)d = 0.0132 m 
In this equation the velocity is that in the pipe. This appears to be one equation with two unknowns, but V 
and d are not independent, substituting in: 
V -- flow rate/(rcd2/4) and solving for d = 0.065 m = 6.5 cm (about 2.5 inches) 
We now can solve for the pipe velocity (0.15 m/s) and the Reynolds number (1 x 104) and can check the 
assumed resistance coefficient using Fig. 6.3. The estimate was good. 
(C) If there are 10 users, what is the minimum pipe diameter for the main distribution lines to still to be 
'large'? We have to tenfold the flow rate, estimate a new resistance coefficient (which will be checked later) 
for a smooth pipe equal to 0.02 and keep the pipe frictional losses at the same 2% (0.0132 m). Recalculating 
the equations above: 
d' = 0.0899 m -- 8.99 cm (about 3.5 inches) 
v' -- 0.79 m/s, Reynolds number = 7 x 10 4 
Check Fig. 6.3 for resistance coefficient, 0.02 was a good estimate 
Main seawater distribution pipes of about this size should assure the independence of each system user's flow 
rate from the actions of the other users. 
usually involves much smaller flow rates than those at head tanks. This can be done with 
flexible tubing on the discharge spigot and a vertical support stand. The amount of control 
this will provide over the flow rate is proportional to the magnitude of the possible elevation 
variation at the point of application relative to the total driving head at that point. If h is 
a substantial fraction of H (see Fig. 9.1), there will be a considerable range for flow rate 
control. 
9.2 Water level control 
There are a number of ways to control water levels in head tanks, or any other type of tank. 
These are shown in Fig. 9.2. They will all effectively control the water elevation, providing 
that the flow into the tank is greater than any flow demands on the tank (not shown). The 
first is the simple overflow. Since this is built into the tank, it has the least capability to alter 
the water elevation. The only possibility is to change the elevation of the entire tank, which 
for small head tanks may not be too difficult. The removable standpipe can be switched for

a longer or shorter one (within limits) to change water elevations. A related alternative is an 
external standpipe. This allows unrestricted access to the tank and easier drainage. As with 
the internal standpipe, water elevation in the tank can be controlled by selecting the length 
of the standpipe and both provide easier tank cleaning than the other options due to the 
inherent bottom drain capability. The siphon is the most flexible as the small auxiliary box 
can be readily moved up or down. It does not require any modifications to the main tank. 
The only constraints are that the siphon must be sufficiently large so as to have negligible 
frictional losses and must be secured at both ends. The small tank should contain at least 15 
seconds of flow to keep the velocity effects negligible. It is helpful if the siphon is flexible and 
transparent. There are a number of other possible variations on the use of siphons in level and 
flow control and more detailed design information is presented by Garrett (1991). 
Under normal operating conditions all four approaches can accurately control the water 
level. During periods of water stoppage, critical flow needs supplied from the tank or even 
small leaks in the tank or standpipe may allow complete or partial tank drainage. This may be 
more important for siphon systems, as the siphon effect is broken when the water level drops 
below the siphon intake hose and it will not restart by itself when the water is restored. Also, all 
four approaches can fail by flooding, if overflow pipes or screens become clogged with debris. 

133 
If water levels become too high or to low, it is important to find out about it as soon 
as possible. Changes in water level are often the first noticeable sign of a failure. For these 
reasons, water levels are often instrumented to set off alarms or trigger other actions at 
predetermined high or low water elevations. As an example, if a pump is drawing from a tank 
that loses water and the pump is not automatically shut off, it will run dry and self destruct. 
There is a wide variety of programmable water level switches available, many made with 
synthetic materials. In addition, one can easily be made with a small float, a vertical rod, two 
brackets, two rod guides and two contact switches. The rod is connected to the float and is 
allowed, by the two guides, to go up and down with the water level. The brackets are fastened 
to the rod at the correct elevations and activate the contact switches as the rod moves up and 
down with the float. 
9.3 Control of flow rate 
The desired flow can be controlled with a valve at the point of application. This is 
commonly done and in many cases is a satisfactory solution, if the rest of the distribution 
system has negligible frictional losses. More precise control of flow rate may be required 
under some conditions. 
Fig. 9.3 shows the discharge of an orifice to air. This can provide flow rates that 
are consistent for long periods of time to within a few percent, even for wide seasonal 
water-property variations and with raw seawater. However, the hole diameter (D) must be 
larger than the biggest particles to be encountered to avoid clogging. H can be the driving head 
directly from the head tank, if the distribution system to the point of use has negligible losses, 
or it can be the head of a small auxiliary head box at the point of application. For accuracy 
it is important that the flow velocity just upstream of the orifice be negligible. A large pipe 
is adequate if the flow velocity in the pipe is very low. It is also important that the edges of

the orifice be sharp, to prevent variations in flow separation and resulting changes in flow rate. 
This approach has been used successfully with orifices cut into threaded PVC caps on 4 and 
6 in. lines with flows over 50 gpm (3.1 l/s) and down to flows as low as 0.25 gpm (0.0016 l/s) 
with raw seawater and auxiliary head boxes (see Example 9.2). A similar water flow control 
device for use inside tanks, but with its discharge underwater, has been demonstrated to 
be precise, inexpensive and reliable (Kinghorn, 1982a). Discharging to air above the water 
surface has the distinct advantage that the proper operation of the device can be easily checked 
visually and by sound. With a little experience, even small changes in flow due to partial 
clogging or loss of head are readily observed. The amount of servicing required depends on 
prior processing of the water (filtering, sterilization, sedimentation, etc.). With a little care, 
even under the worst conditions, such devices can often be left unattended for long periods. 
Another variation for very low flow rates in the order of 0.08 gpm (0.005 l/s) involves 
the use of nonwetting micropipette tips. These can be cut with a razor blade and fine 
flow adjustments accomplished by varying the discharge elevation above the water surface 
(see Fig. 16.1). With filtered water the tips will not clog, but with water containing high 
concentrations of phytoplankton daily attention is required. This approach provides very 
precise flow control and is an alternative to very expensive metering pumps. 
9.4 Flow measurement 
It is sometimes necessary to monitor flow rates in pipes and there are several approaches 
to this requirement. There are a number of industrially available induction or ultrasonic flow 
meters that can precisely monitor most flows from outside the pipe. Other types of flow meters 
have rotors or other appendages exposed to the flow but are generally undesirable for extended 
marine uses due to biofouling and seawater corrosion problems. However, remote reading 
propeller flow meters have been successfully used in freshwater hatcheries. Orifices or venturi

Reynolds number is within the specified range and flow rate estimate should be close. Actual calibration of 
flow rates versus manometer deflections would be more accurate than such calculations. 
combined with a simple manometer or differential pressure gauge provide a cheap and reliable 
alternative to expensive industrial equipment (see Fig. 9.4). The manometer is an air-seawater 
type and may require a vertical height of around 6 ft (2 m). It has a captive air bubble and 
the measurement is the difference in the elevation of the two sides (see Example 9.3). It 
is helpful if the tubing from the devices to the manometer's glass or clear plastic tubing is 
flexible and transparent. If any bubbles are in the lines, other than the big one at the top of the 
manometer, the accuracy of the measurement can be greatly degraded. The venturi has much 
lower frictional losses than the orifice and this may be an important consideration for some 
applications. The manometer deflection, h, happens to be the actual frictional head loss for 
the orifice, but this is not true for the venturi. The orifice ports should be a few pipe diameters 
on either side of the orifice. The orifice edge should be sharp to get consistent flow separation. 
The loss coefficient K is dependent on the diameter ratio d/D (higher ratios higher values) 
and somewhat on the Reynolds number (Re), especially with Re below 5 x 103. More precise 
values for K can be found in fluid mechanics texts (Roberson and Crowe, 1990). More recent 
fluid mechanics texts tend to eliminate coverage of manometers. If a differential pressure 
gauge is to be used in place of a manometer in Fig. 9.4 or Example 9.3, the manometer 
deflection (head of manometer fluid) can be converted to a pressure reading. The maximum 
and minimum manometer deflections can likewise be converted to maximum and minimum 
pressure readings needed to specify the pressure gauge.

Occasionally, flow might have to be measured in open channels. Some of the available 
open channel flow measurement devices can be used down to relatively low flow rates of 
about 0.5 gpm (0.028 l/s), even though such equipment is usually associated with very high 
rates. Open-channel flow measurement devices include V-notch, rectangular, and trapezoidal 
weirs and Parshall flumes. They all involve the prediction of flow rate based on the backing 
up of water upstream of the device. For more information see Davis and Sorensen (1969) and 
Leupold and Stevens (1975). 
All the flow measurement and control devices mentioned have to be checked and calibrated 
with various versions of 'graduate tube (bucket) and stopwatch'. Calibrating with actual 
measurements can result in excellent subsequent flow measurement and control.

Suspended Solids Removal 
10.1 Considerations, tradeoffs and options 
Filtering is a term that generally means more than simply straining. Depending on the 
type of filter and conditions, the operating mechanisms can include: straining, sedimentation, 
adsorption, diffusion and chemical bonding. Filtering options are usually classified by the size 
of the smallest particle removed. Note that the older unit of micron is equal to the SI unit of 
micrometer (txm). Because of the complexity of some of the processes that might be involved 
and the dependence on conditions, many of which vary with time, predicting the performance 
of at least some of the filter types at any given point is often, at best, an estimate with low 
precision. There are some recent data comparing the solids removal of several alternative 
approaches (Piedrahita et al., 1998). 
Quantifying the filtering requirements is also often an approximation based on anticipated 
conditions. Generally, when additional filtering is required at all, these requirements tend 
to fall into three categories. Some coarse filtering is likely to have been already done by 
intake screens and places in the system with high residence time (headboxes, storage tanks, 
etc.), where sedimentation would have occurred (see Section 10.8). The next coarsest type 
requirement is to remove zooplankton, larvae of larger animals and eggs of various kinds. This 
requires filtration down to the 75-100 Ixm (0.075-0.10 mm) region. The next is to remove all 
phytoplankton, which generally requires filtering down to 2-10 txm (0.002-0.010 mm). The 
most severe requirement is to remove very fine suspended colloidal particles, usually clays, 
that occur in some areas and can greatly reduce the clarity of water, giving it a cloudy or 
smoky appearance. They will usually not settle by themselves, no matter how much time is 
allowed. These very fine particles, often in the 1-2 Ixm range, have generally little biological 
impact and their removal is usually required only where viewing conditions are important, 
such as in aquariums and some educational systems. This requires filtering down to about 
1 Ixm (0.001 mm) or less. 
It is important to not overstate filtering requirements. Filters can be a source of system 
failure, high initial and operating costs, and high labor demand. They have the capability 
to be a continuous source of problems and irritation to operating personnel. These types of 
problems usually increase proportionally to the requirement for finer filtration. 
Fine filters must not be exposed directly to raw seawater. During storms or periods of 
heavy waves, impressive amounts of coarse solids can be suspended in coastal waters and 
pumped into the system. Exposing fine filters directly to such waters will produce virtually 
instantaneous filter clogging. It is imperative that the fast settleable solids be removed by 
sedimentation (see Section 10.8). Even a few minutes of the fluid at rest can accomplish much, 
but the longer the better. A minimum of an hour of residence time is preferred but 15 min 

138 
might be adequate, especially if followed by coarse filtering. Normal design of a system often 
results in useful, but often inadvertent, sedimentation of the coarsest and heaviest particles in 
headtanks or supply channels. Since a single storm may deposit many inches of sediments 
in these areas, provisions for removal must be provided. In order to reduce the load on fine 
filters, it is common to have a two-step filtering process with two different types of filters, the 
first being a coarser filter. Another major reason for this two-step sequence is that only a part 
of the flow may require the finer filtration, with most of the uses being satisfied by the coarser 
filtering alone. 
Most filter operations are batch processes and time dependent. The filters start out clean 
and gradually or rapidly, depending on the solids content of the water, accumulate solids 
within the filter system. Most filters have appreciable head losses even when clean. As the 
filter becomes dirty, the head losses increase rapidly and the flow rate through the filter 
decreases. For a very dirty filter, the through flow will approach zero. Because of the variable 
and often high frictional head losses across filters, they are usually placed downstream of a 
pump to provide the required pressures (typically 10 to 60 psi). The head losses across the 
filter must be included in the matching of the pump and the system (see Chapter 7). Since 
the filter losses are usually a substantial part of the total piping system's losses, putting in or 
taking out a filter from a system not designed for it is very likely to lead to incompatibilities 
within the pump-piping system (see Chapter 7). In gravity flow situations adequate heads for 
operating many types of filters are generally not available and the variability in the head losses 
will degrade the flow-control capabilities inherent in gravity systems. Placing a filter in the 
gravity flow portion of a system often requires use of a dedicated booster pump. 
When batch type filters get sufficiently dirty to reduce the flow rate below some minimum 
value, they must be cleaned in place or changed. If this cleaning is carried out in place with 
a reversal of flow it is called backflushing or backwashing. During backwashing the filter 
system is generally out of operation. The time out of operation can range from 2 to 15 min. 
The time interval between replacements or backflushings is called the filter run. It is highly 
variable and depends on conditions. Servicing requirements may, therefore, also be highly 
variable. Exceptions to these problems of variable head loss and flow rate are filters which 
are classed as continuously backflushing. Because of their much more constant head losses, 
flow rate and continuous operation, they are very desirable from a systems' design and control 
stand point. Unfortunately, most of these filter types are towards the coarse end of the particle 
spectrum. 
The backflushing water for one unit may be the filtered output of one or more identical 
parallel units or a prefiltered supply, such as from a headtank. For continuously backflushing 
units, the backwash flow is usually a small fraction of its own filtered output (in the order 
of 5-10%). It is important that the backflushing flow be sufficient to completely clean the 
filter, or subsequent filter runs will be gradually shortened to unacceptable levels. Since 
backflushing flows are discharged, the seawater supply to the system must be designed with 
consideration for this and other auxiliary flow requirements. 
It is important to not filter more water than is required. To do so is a waste of energy and 
filter servicing time. Such a situation is very common, especially when the filters are located 
between the main pumps and the headtank. Headtanks are usually of the overflow type, with 
excess filtered water being discharged to the drain. One possibility is to throttle the discharge 
side of the pump to reduce the flow rate so that the headtank is barely overflowing. If tidal

use. 
or other pump system conditions are continuously changing, this would require continuous 
adjustments. In this case, it would not be worthwhile trying to get the minimum at all times 
but only using this approach for coarse-flow adjustments. An option is to place the filter on a 
gravity line between the headtank and the point of application. This has the advantage of only 
filtering the water required but may have other problems in this location (see above). Another 
option for small scale use is to loop the filtered overflow back to the suction side of the pump 
(see Fig. 16.1). If this is done, great care must be taken to assure that no air gets ingested into 
the suction side of the pump to prevent mass mortalities from gas supersaturation. 
There are many different types of filters available. Some types are adequately covered in 
the available literature on filters in seawater-culturing systems (see Appendix G), while others 
are not. Manufacturers can be found through equipment supplier indexes (Appendix M). 
Filters can be categorized by filtration performance and flow rate. The types commonly used 
in seawater systems are listed in Table 10.1. Since much of this equipment has been developed 
for use in quite different applications and is available in many variations of materials and 
material combinations, considerable care is required to assure biological acceptability and 
compatibility with seawater (see Chapter 8). 
10.2 Cartridge filters 
Cartridge filters can be used directly in a seawater line under pressure. The disposable 
cartridge is usually in a transparent canister for the smaller sizes, which is easily unscrewed 

140 
to get access to the cartridge. Replacement does require turning off the system. The 
cartridges are available in a wide variety of sizes, materials and filtration performances 
(Nickolaus, 1975), not all of which would be acceptable for use in seawater systems. Multiple 
filter units can be placed in parallel to increase flow capacity. There are a number of 
manufacturers specializing in these components. Since cartridges are interchangeable, this 
provides considerable operational flexibility to meet changing requirements. Head losses for 
the finer filters when clean can be as low as about 16 ft (5 m), increasing as the cartridge 
gets dirty. It is important to continuously monitor the flow rate through the cartridge, usually 
visually at a discharge over a tank. Visual estimations from observation of filter coloration 
through the transparent cases are not a reliable indication of either flow rate or cartridge 
filtering status. Careful specification of the filtering equipment and its loading can assure 
filter runs sufficiently long to go through unattended periods. Replacement will often be 
required about once a day. If the seawater to the filter can be highly variable in its particulate 
content, such as due to storms or blooms, the filter runs could be greatly shortened. If the 
dirty cartridge is not replaced, the filter will stop flowing and the pump may overheat and 
burn up. An example of a practical use of such equipment for fine filtering is shown in 
Fig. 16.1. In this case, the raw seawater was coarsely filtered and exposed to a large tank 
(residence time well over 1 h), where sedimentation could take place before being fine filtered. 
It was operated unattended at night but did require daily cartridge replacement and servicing, 
including weekends. 
10.3 Diatomaceous earth filters 
Diatomaceous earth (DE) filtering and related equipment are an alternative to cartridges 
and are available to handle higher flow rates. In fact, disposable cartridges already coated with 
DE are offered by some suppliers. DE is a granular material composed of the skeletal remains 
of diatoms. Before it can be used as a filter medium, it must be deposited in a dense layer on 
a porous substrate forming a filter cake. If the filter cake is not uniform, there can be partial 
short-circuiting of the filter. The substrate is a cloth-like material, often polypropylene, in the 
shape of a long tube or two-sided flat plate (leaf). This material, usually called the sleeve, 
is removable because it may be periodically cleaned or replaced. This cloth has no structural 
strength and must be supported by a core structure. There are basically two types of DE units. 
One is called a gravity unit with the supply side at atmospheric pressure. This type is powered 
by a partial vacuum on the discharge side. The other type is a pressure DE unit driven by 
a pump on the supply side. Both types require a preparation cycle to establish the DE layer 
on the porous substrate by addition of DE to the supply side in a closed loop. Once in the 
operating mode, the filter run can often be greatly lengthened by the continuous addition of 
small amounts of DE to the unfiltered water. Filter runs are highly variable and dependent 
on conditions, but are often designed to be normally about 24 h. Once dirty, the DE filter 
is backflushed and a new filter cake established to complete the cleaning cycle. Very little 
pressure is required to backlash, since the filter cake is only held to the substrate by operating 
pressure or partial vacuum. The performance of the DE filter is determined by the specifics 
of the DE material used, the equipment, operating conditions and the servicing procedures 
(Spotte, 1979). DE equipment can be expensive to own and operate, sometimes requiting 
considerable servicing and labor. 

141 
10.4 Filter bags 
Filter bags are cloth materials (usually nylon or polypropylene) in the shape of a bag and 
attached to a semiflexible ring at the open top. They are placed at the end of a pipe by a disk- 
shaped pipe fitting, over which the slightly deformed ring is placed edgewise and rotated into 
position. They usually discharge over or within an open tank and several can be used in parallel. 
When clean, their head loss is very small. When they are dirty, they balloon. This shape change 
is easily visible. It takes only a few seconds of downtime to replace a filter. A dirty filter can be 
surprisingly heavy, due to trapped water. They are usually cleaned by hand. This cleaning is not 
100% and the bags ultimately have to be replaced. A typical application is shown in Fig. 16.1. 
A wide variety of equipment variations are available. The basic approach is quite flexible. 
For coarser filtering applications, synthetic microscreening meshes have been formed into 
bags or socks and used to screen the inflow to tanks and ponds. If large, the socks have to 
either be supported or be placed in the water, since their weights when dirty can be impressive. 
The only penalty for in-water use is that their status is not as easily visually checked. These 
microscreen bags are typically custom-made from bulk screening material, although some 
ready made units are available. 
10.5 Centrifuges and cyclones 
Centrifuges and cyclones do not filter by size but rather on differences in specific gravity 
between the fluid and particulate matter. Since many organic particles have densities close to 
that of seawater, high rotational speeds are required. Continuous centrifuges have been used 
in commercial bivalve hatcheries. Since this equipment was developed for other applications, 
more care than usual in selection is required. Due to the high energy contained in the spin 
rates (order of 30,000 rpm), corrosion leading to imbalance or breakage, could result in a 
catastrophic explosion-like failure. In addition, due to engineering requirements, they are 
unlikely to be available in the most biologically acceptable materials. This equipment is 
complicated and expensive but the alternatives also have problems and limitations. 
10.6 Sand filters 
Sand filters of various kinds are very common in seawater systems. Their performance is 
dependent not only on the type of filter and operating procedures, but heavily on the sand 
characteristics. There may be only one type of sand in a filter (single medium) or several 
(multi-media). The lower limit for a single-sand medium is about 20 ~m. Each sand is 
characterized by its grain size, uniformity of grain size, grain shape and specific gravity, all 
of which are important to filtering performance. The physical differences between sands can 
be critical. Choosing the sand for a given application and predicting its performance is a very 
difficult matter (Rich, 1961; Spotte, 1979) that still contains considerable subjective judgment. 
Even the 'experts' make mistakes in this area. If not done properly, sand filters can easily 
prove to be a continuous source of operational problems. 
Most of the filtering action in a sand filter occurs in the first few inches. Since many of 
the organic particulates are compressible, they can easily cake. Proper sand parameters can 
considerably reduce the resulting head losses.

Sand Fi Iter 
Fig. 10.1. Types of sand filters. 
Most of the problems with sand filters are a result of improper backflushing. The back- 
flushing must be sufficient to fluidize the bed without blowing the media out the discharge. 
This means that the backflushing velocity must reach but not exceed the terminal velocity 
of the sand particles and must do so uniformly over the filter area; obviously, this is a 
delicate process. If more than one sand is included, they must be matched so that they will 
segregate properly on backflushing. If they mix appreciably, head losses may be substantially 
increased. If the sand changes shape over time due to friction on backwashing (becoming more 
spherical), or the fluid temperature or salinity changes, the particles' terminal velocities will 
also change. This will affect the required backflushing flow. Uniformity over the filter area is a 
big problem. Dead spots not adequately fluidized or cleaned will become even 'deader'. High 
velocity spots may locally blow out the finer media causing a short-circuit across the filter. 
Sand filters can be classified a number of ways. Fig. 10.1 presents three general categories 
of sand filters. The rapid and slow filters in fact represent a continuum of loading (flow/area) 

143 
possibilities rather than two distinctive types. They both often use a foundation of coarse 
gravel with high specific weight (about 2.5) and manifolds with slotted laterals. There are 
other alternate under-drain systems. Filter loading values have to be used with caution, as 
performance is heavily dependent on input water parameters and specific filter conditions. The 
key to minimizing the very considerable potential problems from sand filters is to lightly load 
them and service them properly. 
Rapid sand filters are pressurized units often used in multiple parallel units. They are 
available from a number of manufacturers in varying sizes and capabilities. They require 
relatively small floor area. The pressure case may be steel, often epoxy-coated inside, in the 
larger sizes. The smaller varieties are often fiberglass. Both of these types are used in many 
industrial applications. In rapid sand filters the loadings typically run as high as 20 gpm/ft 2 
(1.4 lps/m2), although one would be very unwise to use such values with raw seawater. More 
reasonable maximum values would be about a quarter of this number. Their head losses when 
clean can be in the order of 30-90 ft (9.1-27.4 m). The head or pressure across the filter must 
be monitored to determine when backflushing is needed (see Example 10.1). Backflushing is 
often automated, but this adds substantially to the cost. The advantage of automation is that it 
reduces the problem of erratic servicing requirements due to variation in filter runs, especially 
if raw seawater is the input. When the filter clogs and if the shut-off head of the pump is 
higher than the pressure rating of the filter, then the filter will literally blowup; furthermore, 
this may occur rapidly if the input seawater suddenly becomes turbid due to storm or wave 
action. This is a common source of failure when 'swimming pool' filters of this type are used 
in culturing systems, due to relatively low cost and availability. Because they are definitely 
high head-loss devices, putting them in or taking them out of a seawater system will usually 
require a major system redesign. 
Slow sand filters usually have loadings of 1 gpm/ft 2 (0.68 lps/m 2) or less. As a 
consequence they require more floor space. Unlike the rapid sand filters, these are usually 
provided on a custom design and manufacturing basis (see Example 10.2). They are usually 
unpressurized, although a positive displacement pump applying a partial vacuum to the 
discharge will increase their flow. They are also low head devices (a few inches of head loss) 
and as such can sometimes be used in gravity flow situations. When they clog, the top sand 
layers can be scraped off and replaced, or they can be configured for backwashing as shown 
in Fig. 10.1. The problems of sand characteristics and uniformity of rapid sand filters will 
also apply to the backflushing of slow filters. Since their operation is usually visible, they 
are easier to monitor. If they clog heavily, they will simply overflow to drain, cutting off the 
seawater supply. 
The continuously backflushing sand filter (see bottom drawing in Fig. 10.1) is a relatively 
new approach and has been successfully used in seawater-culturing systems. Its maximum 
loading is about 8 gpm/ft 2 (5.4 lps/m2). It has a constant head loss of only about 2 ft (0.6 
m) and is available in a range of sizes. It has no downtime for backflushing and appears to 
solve all the backflushing problems of more conventional sand filters. Its low head makes it 
attractive from a system design standpoint, as it can be placed or removed from any place in 
a system with little in the way of repercussions. In most applications, it only requires a small 
flow of low pressure compressed air and does not require electronic controls or automatic 
valves. 

144 
Example 10.1. Rapid sand filter 
A fine filtering requirement has resulted in the selection of a fine but angular sand with a K -- 10 m/day 
being placed in a rapid sand filter similar to that shown in Fig. 10.1. The filter bed has an effective thickness 
of 6 inches and is circular in cross-section with a diameter of 5 ft. Upstream of the filter there is a centrifugal 
pump drawing seawater (30 g/kg, 68~ 
off of a wet well and after going through the filter, the flow 
discharges to a head tank as shown in Fig. 5.3. The pump is the same model as specified by the pump curve 
in Fig. 7.5. You can assume that all the other frictional losses on both sides of this pump are negligible 
compared to the losses across the filter (usually a good first-order assumption). 
(A) What is the maximum flow rate through the filter when it is completely clean? 
K = 10 m/day = 0.0228 ft/min 
L = 0.5 ft 
A -- red2~4 -- (3.14)(5)2/4 = 19.63 ft 2 
Using Eq. 4.1, Q = KhA/L = 0.895h (Q in ft3/min). To convert to gpm, the previous equation 
should be multiplied by 7.48 gallons/ft 3, so Q -- 6.70h (Q in gpm). h is the filter loss plus the 
elevation change from the wet well water surface to the discharge elevation above the head tank (ft). 
Since the filter is the only appreciable loss in the system, the above is the effective system curve. 
Plotting h vs gpm in Fig. 7.5, results in a straight line and an operating point (intersection) of about 
250 gpm. This is the maximum possible flow through the filter with this pump. 
(B) Based on the guidelines of Section 10.6, what is the estimated nominal flow of this unit? 
Conservative value given as 5 gpm/ft 2 gives 5 x 19.63 = 98.2 gpm or about 100 gpm. 
(C) If it is decided to backflush the filter when the flow drops to 75 gpm, what will be the pressure difference 
measured across the filter bed in psi? 
From Fig. 7.5, at 75 gpm the total head loss is 47 ft, which is assumed to be entirely due to the filter loss and 
the static lift. In the case of the system in Fig. 5.3, the static lift was about 12 ft. The specific gravity (V) 
comes from Table A-3 for seawater at 68~ and 30 ppt. 
Eq. 6.1, Pl - P2 - (h)(v) -- (47 - 12) x 63.74 = 2231 lb/ft 2 -- 15.5 psi 
10.7 Microscreens 
Microscreens are industrially available in a wide variety of materials, configurations, and 
sizes. There are versions for pressurized and unpressurized applications. The unpressurized 
applications are usually rotating-meshed barrels 75% submerged across a flow channel. 
Filtering usually takes place from inside to outside of the barrel. The filtered flow leaves in a 
channel 90 ~ to the input flow. A small horsepower motor rotates the barrel and a strip of the 
mesh across the top is continuously backwashed by a small pump to a drainage tray inside 
the barrel. Unlike sand filters, there is no problem with a little overkill on the backflushing. 
The head loss across the screen is negligible, a few inches at most. The pressurized units also 
involve a rotating cylinder. The filtered water is removed from the center and backwashing 
occurs to a slipper-type discharge on the outside of a small section of the cylinder. The head 
losses are usually within 12 ft (3.8 m) and constant. With careful choices of mesh, materials, 

145 
Example 10.2. Slow sand filter 
Slow sand filters are generally not commercially available and you have decided to build your own 
down-flow system with backflushing capability as shown in Fig. 10.1. The filter bed is to be 6 inches of 
coarse sand (K = 100 m/day) and the bed dimensions are for practical construction reasons to be 4 • 8 ft. 
The minimum pressure below the sand layer at the filter exit can be assumed to be atmospheric. The 
overflow and backflushing drain is 12 inches above the sand layer. 
(A) What is the maximum flow rate through the filter in gpm when it is clean and with the maximum amount 
of water over it?

32 • 1 = about 32 gpm 
(C) By dropping a number of individual sand grains in a long graduated cylinder of still water, you find that 
the average settling velocity is 0.5 ft/min. What is the approximate backflushing flow rate needed to fluidize 
the filter bed during backflushing? 
Q = VA = (0.5)(32)= 16 ft3/min = 120 gpm 
and coatings, these units can give long periods of relatively low maintenance and trouble-free 
service, especially if the filtering requirement is not too fine. Problems can develop if they 
receive large amounts of debris or seaweeds. However, this will be true for any kind of 
filter. 
Microscreens have also been used to remove solids from culture effluent (Bergheim et al., 
1993). They are much more compact than a sedimentation chamber and have faster processing 
time. Microscreens also reduce the amount of water associated with the sludge, simplifying 
sludge handling and disposal. 
10.8 Sedimentation 
Sedimentation depends on the particle density relative to the fluid, particle shape and 
particle size. The larger the particle size and density, the faster the particle will settle. Very 
small particles such as clay may not settle at all, as the random movement of water molecules 
is larger than the settling velocity. Sedimentation in marine culture systems may be required 
to remove sand from the influent or waste solids from the discharge. 
The ideal sedimentation tank is commonly rectangular with a uniform horizontal fluid 
velocity (Vh). The solids that collect on the bottom of the basin must be removed either 

146 
periodically on shutting down of the unit or automatically during normal operations. Ideally 
the performance of the settling basin is independent of basin depth but practical considerations 
associated with sludge accumulation limits the use of shallow basins. Typical depths are in the 
range of 1.2-1.8 m. 
For a single sized particle with a settling velocity of Vc, complete removal of the particles 
will occur when: 
OVh 
Vc: 
L 
(10.1) 
where D is depth of basin (ft, m), L is length of basin in horizontal flow direction (ft, m), Vc 
is vertical settling velocity (ft/s, m/s), Vh is horizontal velocity, is Q~ cross-sectional area, is 
Q/D W (ft/s, m/s), Q is flow rate (ft3/s, m3/s), and W is width of basin (ft, m). 
Combining Eq. 10.1 and the definition of the horizontal velocity results in: 
Q 
Q 
Vc -- L W : horizontal area of basin 
(10.2) 
The velocity Vc is also called the overflow rate or surface loading rate and is expressed 
in m/day or m3/m 2 per day. In practice, design must allow for inlet and outlet turbulence, 
short-circuiting, and sludge storage (see Example 10.3). Available data on settling rates of 
aquaculture solids and protocols for the measurement of settling rates are presented by Wong 
and Piedrahita (2000). 
Example 10.3. Sedimentation -- removal of uneaten feed and fecal solids 
It is desired to remove all particles with settling velocities greater than 0.5 inch/min from a 100 gpm flow. 
This is typical of a post-treatment process involving the removal of uneaten solid food and fecal matter. 
Compute the minimum length of the sedimentation basin. Assume a water depth of 1.8 m and a width of 
3.0m. 
0.5 inches/min = 18.29 m/day 
100 gpm = 545 m 3/day 
Eq. 10.2, Ve = Q/(L x W) or 18.29 -- 545/(L x W) 
(L)(3.0) = 29.8 m 2 
L =9.9m 
If 1000 mg/1 of solids drop out in the sedimentation basin, how long will it take to deposit a 6 inches layer? 
Assume that the average density of the deposited solids is 1500 kg/m 3 and the solids are uniformly 
distributed. 
6 inches -- 0.152 m 
Volume of solids = (0.152)(3.0)(9.9) = 4.51 m 3 
Mass of solids --- volume x density -- 4.51 m 3 x 1500 kg/m 3 -- 6772 kg 
Deposition rate --- flow rate x concentration 
= (100 gpm x 3.78 1/gal x 60 min/h x 1000 mg/1)/106 mg/kg 
-- 22.8 kg/h 
Mass of solids -- deposition rate x time 
Time = 6772/22.8 = 297 h -- 12.4 days 

147 
In real systems, there is a wide range of particle sizes present. All particles having settling 
velocities greater than Vc, will be completely removed. If the particle sizes are uniformly 
distributed at the inlet zone, particles having velocities less than Vc will be removed in the 
proportion of V~ Vc, where V is the settling velocity. Decreasing the overflow rate will remove 
smaller or lighter particles at the expense of increasing the size of the sedimentation basin. 
The determination of the overflow rate required to meet a given removal efficiency can be 
based on batch settling testing or pilot-scale experiments. 
The designs of sedimentation basins for aquatic culture sygte-riis are quite different from 
those used in wastewater treatment. Freshwater hatchery wastes are denser, settle faster, and 
tend to form a heavy viscous sludge (Mudrak, 1981). The solids loading to the sedimentation 
basin tend to be lower than wastewater applications so that continuous sludge removal is not 
generally required. However, if the sludge is allowed to remain for much longer than six 
weeks, it may become very viscous and difficult to remove (Mudrak, 1981). 
To reduce the amount of water that must be treated, a variety of dual drain systems have 
been used in production applications. Solids that accumulate on the bottom are removed by 
a separate drain while the majority of the clean water is discharged from an upper drain 
(Timmons et al., 1998). The solids concentration in the bottom waste stream can be a factor 
of 10 times or higher than the concentration of solids in the upper drain. Because the bottom 
flow ranges from only 1% to 20% of the total flow, the capacity of the solids processing 
equipment can be reduced by a factor of 5-100. In addition, the higher solids concentration 
in the bottom water discharge results in improved sedimentation efficiency more typical of 
primary sedimentation. 
Typical overflow rates range from 40 to 60 m/day for cold water fish and 160 to 175 m/day 
for warm water fish. The overflow rate should be based on the peak hourly flow. Mudrak 
(1981) has recommended that an earthen stabilization pond follow the sedimentation basin. 
The pond should be designed with a 4 h detention time and an average depth of 1.2 to 1.5 
m. This pond will serve as a 'buffer zone' should any operational problems occur with the 
sedimentation basin. Based on freshwater fish precedents, a properly designed sedimentation 
system should be able to remove approximately 85% of solid wastes (Mudrak, 1981) and 
produce effluent solids concentrations near 6 mg/1 (Henderson and Bromage, 1988). Detailed 
information for most marine animal wastes is lacking at this time (see Section 3.3). 
An ongoing dramatic change is in the sophistication and availability of prepackaged 
(modular and prebuilt) wastewater treatment plants and systems for modest flow rates well 
within our area of interest. Much of this equipment may be readily useable to meet culturing 
wastewater treatment needs, especially if using double drains on culturing units to drastically 
reduce water entrainment with waste solids. With the nature of culturing solid wastes, one 
can expect this equipment to work even better than it does with municipal wastewater. Most 
of this equipment is already made with materials suitable for exposure to seawater (plastics, 
fiberglass, etc.). 
Another change is greatly increased restrictions on sludge handling and disposal. Simple 
sludge drying beds may no longer be acceptable due to concerns about smell, public health 
and possibilities of ground water contamination. Since even 'good quality' sludge may have 
more than 90% water content, removing this water (dewatering) can considerable simplify 
sludge handling and disposal. Again, equipment from the wastewater treatment field may be 
directly useable. 

148 
While sedimentation is often used to remove suspended solids from effluents before 
discharge, there is another sedimentation situation common in coastal aquaculture facilities, 
which is inadvertent. The suspended solids concentrations in coastal water is highly variable. 
It depends on sediment sources and environmental conditions in a specific coastal area at 
a given time. Major factors are bottom agitation caused by waves, tidal currents and their 
interactions with the coastal bathymetry. The concentrations are known to be often heavily 
dependent on precise elevation above the bottom. There is a lot known about this turbid layer 
above the bottom in estuarine areas under normal conditions (generally with thicknesses of 
inches to feet), but under the effects of major storms it is entirely a different matter. Seawater 
intakes (see Section 4.4) are generally a foot or two above the bottom and close to shore, 
where the suspended materials are likely to have the highest concentrations during storms. 
Suspended materials brought in to the facility will tend to settle at the first low velocity 
parts of the system. These can be head tanks, supply channels, wet wells or storage tanks. 
Under normal conditions the accumulation rate of sediments in these areas can be expected 
to be modest but can accumulate to appreciable depths over a prolonged period of time. An 
example of this slow accumulation is provided in Example 19.6. However, when major storms 
hit coastal areas the suspended solids concentrations in shallow coastal waters can increase 
manyfold. A lot of this material can be coarse and very fast settling given a chance. It is also 
possible that certain combinations of wind, waves, tide, and fiver flow could produce the same 
effects without the presence of an actual storm event. A few feet of solids accumulation from 
a single event, even in tanks or channels with modest detention times, are not uncommon. 
Example 10.4. Estimating storm sedimentation in a storage tank 
A tidal pumping system draws water from the mouth of a river from a salt wedge, which is present at high 
tide. Seawater is pumped for a minimum of 3 h per tidal cycle to a large storage tank. The average flow rate 
to the facility is 500 gpm (1900 lpm). Due to the mix and interactions of waves, river currents and tidal 
currents, a lot of sediment can be suspended from the bottom in this area. A really rare and nasty storm can 
have effects which last a maximum of 48 h and can produce in the estuary an average suspended solids 
concentration of 50 ml/1. Since the storage tank has considerable volume margins that are seldom used, the 
detention time in the tank is at least 6+ hours. With this very long detention time, a suspended solids capture 
efficiency of at least 70% (and very possibly higher) can be anticipated. 
(A) If the tidal pumping storage tank is 20 m in diameter, how thick a solids blanket can be deposited by this 
single storm? 
Flow over 48 h -- 1900 x 2 • 1440 = 5.47 x 106 1 
Solids deposited = (0.7)(50)(5.47 x 106) - 1.92 x 108 ml = 192 m 3 
Bottom area = 314 m 2 
Depth of solids blanket = 192/314 = 0.61 m = 2.0 ft 
(B) If the settled material contains a lot of sand and has a specific gravity of 1.3, what is the approximate 
weight of solids that must be handled from this single event? 
Solids volume = 192 m 3 
Sludge weight = 10,000 x 1.3 x 192 = 2.5 x 106 N -- 561,151 lb = 281 tons 

149 
If the detention time in the first 'slow spot' is less than 1 h, appreciable quantities of the 
finer and lighter solids may not settle there but proceed through the system accumulating or 
causing complications down stream. Solids accumulation must be anticipated during design 
and means provided for accessibility, removal and handling. 
Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any published data on suspended solids concen- 
trations or compositions at seawater intakes in shallow coastal waters during major storms. 
In the absence of real data, some estimates must still be made. An example (see Example 
10.4) is provided with an average of 50 ml/1 suspended solids in the influent for 48 h. The 
concentration could equally be much higher for a shorter interval and get the same result. 
If there is a lot of 'lighter' and 'fluffier' materials present, the accumulation depth could be 
considerably greater. Suspended solids concentrations in shallow coastal areas due to major 
storms are believed to be higher than those encountered in wastewater treatment processes. 
In waste water treatment the typical ranges for settleable solids is 5-20 ml/1 and suspended 
solids 100-350 mg/1, with the settleable solids typically being 60-65% of the suspended 
solids on a weight basis (Tchobanoglous and Burton, 1991). Converting between volume and 
weight is complicated by the fact that weight is on a dry basis and volume measurements are 
wet loosely packed solids with highly variable properties in water. Solids accumulation due to 
storm effects can prove to be a serious operational problem in coastal facilities.

Heating and Cooling 
11.1 Setting requirements 
The heating or cooling of culture water is a frequent systems requirement (see Ap- 
pendix H). This may be to eliminate natural temperature variations and achieve longer periods 
of time at optimum growth temperature or to provide a number of precisely controlled tem- 
peratures for research purposes. If species exotic to the region are involved, heating or cooling 
may be essential for survival. Rapid changes in temperature, even for temperatures within the 
natural range of an organism, can easily prove fatal. Such fatal temperature changes could 
occur by turning something 'on' or 'off', or by the failure of a seawater heating or cooling 
system. The reliability and modes of failure of such systems can assume considerable impor- 
tance. While the tolerance of marine organisms to temperature changes varies considerably, 
a rule of thumb is to limit temperature changes to a maximum of about 2~ 
(l~ 
Tolerances to momentary temperature changes are higher, although any rapid change will, at 
the least, be a source of stress. Fortunately, most culture organisms of interest are estuarine, 
with relatively high tolerances to temperature changes. Deep sea organisms and those from 
isothermal environments may prove much more sensitive to both water temperature values 
and fluctuations. 
Most of the requirements are for seawater heating rather than cooling. The two require- 
ments are very similar. The principles, concepts, and some of the equipment would be 
common. The major difference would be in the need for a heat source for heating rather than 
a heat sink for cooling. 
It is often not appreciated that heating or cooling seawater involves moving considerable 
energy. The energy units most commonly used are the British Thermal Unit (BTU) and the 
gram-calorie. A BTU is defined as the energy necessary to raise the temperature of one 
pound of water one degree Fahrenheit at a water temperature of I~ The gram-calorie is the 
energy necessary to raise one gram of water one degree centigrade at 4~ 
In place of the 
gram-calorie, the kilogram-calorie or large calorie (1000 gram-calories) is often encountered 
in the literature. These heat-energy values for water can be assumed to be constant with 
temperature and salinity over the conditions encountered in aquatic systems. The efficiencies 
of the processes are defined as the energy moved divided by the energy input. For heating, this 
value must be less than one or 100%. For cooling, if a refrigeration cycle is used, the value is 
called the coefficient of performance and usually has a value greater than one. 
Energy flows (power), into or out of the seawater, can become substantial. See Appendix A 
for conversion factors between the various energy and power units. Thus to raise or lower 
1 gpm I~ requires 8.5 BTU/min or 0.2 hp (149 W), assuming 100% efficiency. One lps 
raised or lowered I~ requires 1026 calories/s or 4300 W (5.8 hp). As an example, a winter

Seawater Temperature Increase (~ 
Fig. ll.1. Seawater heating requirements. Based on a unit flow of one gallon per minute of seawater, fuel oil at 
19,000 BTU/lb and specific gravity of 0.9, and several different overall thermal efficiencies. Lower efficiencies are 
due to heat losses at furnace, piping, and heat exchanger. Value will be determined primarily by degree of insulation 
provided to components. Also shown is the numerical example from Example 11.2. 
heating requirement could be to raise 100 gpm 40~ This requires 800 hp to be transferred 
into the fluid. Typical fuel oil has a heat content of 19,000 BTU/lb, and this need would 
require about a gallon of fuel every 4.25 min or 339 gallons/day, assuming 100% efficiency. 
Fig. 11.1 provides information for a wider range of conditions. For higher flows, multiply the 
fight side results by the flow rate in gpm to get the required power or fuel oil inputs. The 
transfer efficiency will be determined primarily by the type of system and amount of thermal 
insulation provided. For high flow rates and large temperature increases, the energy costs can 
easily get out of hand, even at 100% efficiency. Seawater heating systems have been installed 
in test facilities and laboratories that could not be used to anywhere near their capabilities due 
to the impacts of high fuel costs on limited operating budgets. 
There are a few direct heating methods. One is the use of thermostatically controlled 
electric quartz or Teflon immersion units. While small ones are common in home aquariums, 
larger industrial units are available to very substantial power levels. Powers up to 1 kW are 
available in 120 volts and some as high as 3 kW may be available (see Example 11.1). 
Higher power units require higher voltages, which can substantially increase the risks around 
seawater to both culture organisms and operating personnel if not properly handled. These 
units typically have very high transfer efficiencies and can control the temperature to about a 
degree F (half degree C). However, they sometimes fail full 'on', resulting in an unintentional

Readily available electric power is limited to 120 V AC power. The highest readily available rating for a 
thermostatically controlled quartz immersion heater in 120 V AC is about 1 kW. How many gpm of seawater

cooking of the culture organisms. Another possibility is direct steam injection. Some care 
would have to be taken as to its location in the system and, to our knowledge, it has never 
been used in culturing applications. 
Most heating or cooling processes need a heat source or heat sink. This is often also a 
fluid, which may or may not be seawater. If this fluid is in a closed loop and simply a carrier 
of heat from some other heat source or sink, it is called a working fluid. Common working 
fluids include steam, freshwater and a number of chemical refrigerants. Natural heat sinks and 
sources can be many and varied, and may be seasonal. They include lakes, the atmosphere, 
ocean, ground water, earth and rock. Any large mass with temperature above or below the 
culture water temperature can be utilized. The higher the heat capacity of the mass material 
the better. It may be possible to add heat to the mass in the summer and withdraw it in the 
winter. If these masses have temperatures that are higher (heating) or lower (cooling) than the 
desired culture temperatures, the processes can be simplified to simple heat transfer. If the 
heat sink is a pumpable fluid, it can be directly used through a heat exchanger. If the heat 
sink is a solid, a loop with a separate working fluid will be needed. If the heat source does 
not have quite high enough temperature, it can still be used with the addition of a heat pump. 
A heat pump is a refrigeration cycle run in reverse so that heat is removed from a 'cold' 
source and transferred to a 'warm' area. Depending on the temperatures of the heat sink and 
desired temperature, heat pumps can be designed to both heat and cool. Some care would 
have to be taken to prevent unintentional leakage of the working fluid into the culture system. 
Depending on the thermal fluid's properties and toxicity, this could be critical. The greater the 
temperature differences, the more attractive is the prospect of using natural heat sources or 
sinks. While such use is highly dependent on specific circumstances, when conditions permit, 
they often provide simple, reliable and inexpensive temperature control capabilities. If their 
temperatures are in the fight direction but not sufficient, they may still be used but powered 
assistance will be required. 

154 
For heating applications, the most common source of heat is an oil- or gas-fired boiler. 
These units are commercially available in a wide range of sizes and have excellent reliability. 
However, they generally have electrically powered controllers and thus will automatically 
shutdown on loss of electricity, even though they are run from an independent power source. 
This is an important factor in evaluations of overall system reliability and of need for backup 
electric power. Other sources of heat include waste heat from engines, power plants or solar 
collectors. Many of these heat sources may not be under the control of the culturist. Sudden 
loss or change in the heat supply could be catastrophic. Reliability and assurance of supply 
issues have precluded use of what might otherwise be a valuable resource. 
For cooling a refrigeration or chiller unit is generally used to cool a working fluid (usually 
a chemical in a sealed loop) to below the desired seawater temperature. These units usually 
include an evaporator, compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and control circuitry. They 
tend to be more complex and difficult to operate than heating units. A very common mistake 
is to enclose the refrigeration system in a small space without adequate ventilation. Since the 
heat removed from the working fluid must be discarded by the condenser, if ventilation is 
inadequate the space will quickly heat up and system performance will rapidly drop. 
11.2 Heat exchangers 
Most heating and cooling processes will require the use of one or more heat exchangers. 
The heat exchanger separates the working fluid from the process water, while efficiently 
transferring heat between the two fluids. This prevents the corrosion of the heating or 
cooling equipment by seawater and contamination of the process water by potentially toxic 
working fluids. Due to the corrosive properties of seawater, considerable engineering efforts 
have been devoted to the design of marine heat exchangers. However, their use in aquatic 
culturing systems involves biological constraints not typically of other industrial seawater heat 
exchangers (see Sections 8.1 and 8.2). Heat exchanger types that have been successfully used 
in marine culturing applications are shown in Table 11.1. Some are for use with pressure 
on both the seawater and working fluid sides. Others can be used directly in open tanks, 
with only the working fluid being pressurized. In this case, the circulation in the tank has to 
be controlled to assure uniform heat transfer (see Fig. 16.1). Carbon and titanium units are 
particularly well suited to most marine culturing applications. Stainless steel (type 316) heat 
exchangers are readily available and common in marine applications, but should be used with 
caution in culturing systems (see Section 8.2). The symbol U shown in Table 11.1 is the 
overall heat transfer coefficient generally associated with the respective heat exchanger types 
and materials. It is an important parameter in sizing heat exchangers and is generally stated in 
equipment specifications. 
Heat transfer is a complex subject and is dependent on flow configuration, heat exchanger 
internal design, materials and fluid properties. Flow configurations include parallel, counter 
and cross flows. Counter flow is the most efficient in that it results in the smallest heat 
exchanger. It is also the type most likely to be encountered. In counter flow the seawater to 
be heated or cooled flows in the opposite direction to the working fluid. Total heat transfer 
must be integrated over the entire heat exchanger. Assuming steady flows, no phase changes,

Example 11.2. Shell and tube heat exchanger sizing 
We have a winter heating requirement and wish to heat a maximum of l0 gpm of incoming seawater from 
40 ~ to 70~ We wish to use a single pass carbon shell and tube heat exchanger. The heat exchanger will be 
connected in a counter-flow arrangement with its own circulator pump to a hot water system and it is 
expected to provide 20 gpm at 200~ (see Fig. 11.2). We need to size the heat exchanger, and for estimating 
operating costs, we need to estimate heat inputs and fuel oil requirements. 
From Table 11.1 for carbon shell and tube heat exchangers find a U-value of 150-250, so we will use 
U = 200 BTU h -l ft -2 ~ 
Heat input into the seawater can be obtained from Fig. 11.1 by using 100% efficiency. This results in a 
requirement of about 255 BTU/min per gpm. For 10 gpm, this means that 2550 BTU/min or 153,000 
BTU/h must to transferred into the seawater. 
While the seawater in (40~ and out (70~ temperatures and the heating system in (200~ temperature are 
known, the hot water exit temperature may not be known. In this case the circulator flow rate is given and 
from knowing that the heat gained by the seawater must have come from the heating water, assuming no heat 
losses in the heat exchanger, the exit temperature must be about 185~ If the heating system has a high 
circulating flow, the temperature drop will be small. Even if one assumes no temperature drop of the hot 
input water, this will often not substantially change the required heat exchanger area.

A = 5.6 ft 2 of heat exchanger area 
From available options supplied by manufacturers, choose the next size above 5.6 ft 2. 
There will be some heat losses in the heating plant, heat exchanger, and piping runs. These losses will 
depend on the provided insulation. If we assume a 70% overall efficiency (30% thermal losses), going into

case of a simple counter-flow heat exchanger, a straightforward approximation is available 
for exchanger sizing (see Example 11.2). An example for heating in an open tank is given 
in Example 11.3. The seawater input and desired output temperatures are usually known, as 
is the input temperature of the working fluid. Q can be calculated from the seawater flow 
rate and required temperature change, leaving only the unknown heat-exchanger heat-transfer 
area. If needed, the working fluid output temperature can be calculated from fluid proper- 
ties, assuming that there are no heat losses out of the heat exchanger. Correction factors 
for multi-pass shell and tube units can be obtained from engineering texts such as Mark's 
Handbook (Baumeister et al., 1978) or equipment manufacturers. A more complex shell and 
tube example, without some of the simplifying assumptions previously made, is presented in 
Example 11.4. 
While heat exchangers are not usually cheap, they are not normally the dominant cost 
component in a heating or cooling system. Because of many uncertainties in required capacity 
or transfer coefficients, it is good practice to conservatively size the heat exchanger. In this 

157 
way, the system's performance will be limited by the capacity of the heat source or sink, rather 
than by the heat exchanger. When money is limited, a number of inexpensive heat exchangers 
can be built, especially for temporary or small-scale applications. If a little rust is acceptable, 
epoxy painted cast iron radiators can be successfully used. Interestingly, a thin epoxy coat is 
better than a thicker one, because it is less likely to develop small cracks in the coating due 
to thermal stresses and will have higher heat-transfer rates. Even materials with poor thermal 
conductivity can be used, if the area is sufficiently large. Large coils of polyethylene pipe have 
been used as a heat exchanger in outdoor algae tanks. In this case, the heat source was brackish 
ground water at about 55~ (13~ 
It was sufficient to keep the algae ponds from freezing and 
in dramatically improving winter algal production for a commercial shellfish hatchery. 
11.3 Problem areas 
Cross-contamination between the working fluid and the process water can cause serious 
damage to both systems. Probably the biggest single risk is leakage through the heat exchanger 
or some of its associated fittings. Glass and carbon heat exchangers in particular are brittle and 
can crack due to miss handling during shipment or installation. Leakage of seawater into the 
working fluid can cause corrosion problems in the heating or chilling unit and dramatically 
alter the performance of the system. Since the working fluid is likely to be at a higher pressure 
than the process water, leakage into the culture system is more likely than the other way 
around. Such leakage of working fluid into the culture system can be serious, since many of 
the possible working fluids have significant toxicity to culture organisms. Even if the working 
fluid is fresh water, it may contain significant quantities of undesirable contaminates (rust 
inhibitors, metals, hydrocarbons, etc.). 
The heat source or sink may be the heating or cooling system of a building or industrial 
plant. This can work, but there are some potential problems in addition to cross-contamination. 
The building systems were probably not designed with culturing uses in mind. The loads 
on these systems from the culturing requirements and their consequences, as well as the 
mechanics of 'tapping-in', have to be investigated. From the culturing standpoint, it may be 
critical to understand the workings and timings of other demands and functions upon the 
system. The heat source/sink may be sufficiently variable in its temperature and flow as to 
make control of the culture unit's heating/cooling system very difficult. Resulting temperature 
variations could be lethal. The probability of total or partial failure also has to be considered. 
In addition, the plant being relied upon may have inconveniently planned and unplanned 
shutdowns over which the culturist has little control or influence. Some of these shutdowns 
may be for a number of possible reasons, such as maintenance, overhaul, or during holidays. 
Powering down during periods of school holidays is common at some universities. It may be 
cheaper and less risky to have a completely dedicated system to support culturing operations. 
There are a number of ways in which heating and cooling systems can fail. The heat source 
or sink can be cut off. Even momentary events may shutdown the system. Even when the 
power source is an on-site fuel, electric power losses to the controls can shutdown the system. 
On return of electric power, the system will often have to be manually restarted. Pressure 
losses, flame losses, insufficient fluid levels, etc. can also cause shutdown. If culture water con- 
tinues to flow, the culture organisms may see a sudden and dramatic temperature change and 
the consequences could be lethal. It is usually better to immediately stop the flow, even though

Example 11.3. Open tank seawater heating 
A thin-walled titanium heat transfer panel is required to heat 5 gpm of 30 g/kg seawater from 30~ 70~ in a 
large open tank (8 ft long, 4 ft wide and 1 ft water depth) as shown in Fig. 16.1. This is the most demanding 
heating requirement that the system will experience. Hot water (200~ 
in large quantities is supplied from 
the building's hot water heating system. 
(A) Calculate the minimum panel heat transfer area required (being optimistic) and state the actual size that 
you would specify for this application. 
Table 11.1 gives a U-value of 100-175 BTU h -1 ft -2 ~ 
for this type of heat exchanger and states 
that the value is highly dependent on circulation. From Fig. 16.1 it is clear that circulation in the 
tank is artificially aided by a pump, greatly increasing convective heat transfer. The desired 
temperature increase is 70 ~ - 30 ~ = 40~ From Fig. 11.1, this requires an input of 345 BTU/min 
per gpm and 26 gal of fuel oil/gpm per day at 100% efficiency. If there is little opportunity for heat 
loss except between the two fluids across the heat exchanger, the efficiency will be high. At 100% 
and a flow of 5 gpm, the total requirement is for 1725 BTU/min or 130 gal of fuel oil per day or 
equivalent at the exchanger. Remember that this is a small research system and that the heating 
requirement is continuous seven days a week. The total fuel requirement would have to be adjusted 
for boiler inefficiencies and heat losses in the building's distribution system. 
Even though the panel is not completely a counter flow situation, the forced convection makes it a 
fair assumption and Eq. 11.1 can be used. The flow rate from the building's hot water system is not 
known but is stated to be high. The temperature drop of the hot water across the heat exchanger can 
therefore be assumed to be negligible.

A -- 4 ft 2 (minimum panel heat transfer area, no losses, optimistic U) 
A safety and contingency factor of 2 would not be inappropriate, making the area requirement 8 ft 2. 
The same operating conditions but using the lowest U (100), calculates out to 7 ft 2. The tank's water 
depth is 1 ft. If the panel is oriented in the preferred vertical plane (why would a horizontal 
orientation be less efficient?), this makes its maximum width to be 1 ft. For a required heat transfer 
area of 8 ft 2 and considering that the panel has two sides, results in a 1 x 4 ft heat transfer panel as 
shown in Fig. 16.1. 
(B) What are the potential problems inherent with this type of system? Discuss and quantify these problems 
and your approaches to reduce the risks and potential adverse consequences. 
9 If the cold incoming seawater is saturated with dissolved gases, heating it will result in 
substantial levels of supersaturation. From Table 2.7, it can be seen that the saturation 
concentration of oxygen at 0~ is 11.9 mg/1 but only 7.5 mg/1 at 21~ 
producing a 158% 
supersaturation of oxygen. Similarly for the other dissolved gasses, especially for the more 
critical inert gases such as nitrogen. Fortunately this supersaturation takes place in a large open 
tank. The flow of 5 gpm (0.67 ft 3/min) and the tank's water volume of 32 ft 2, results in a 
residence time of 48 rain. The amount of gas removed in the tank will be limited, and some type 
of degassing system may be needed. For sensitive larval stages, degassing will be needed if hot 
and cold water are mixed even if both waters are saturated with dissolved gases. This is a result 
of the non-linearity of gas solubility with temperature. 

159 
Example 11.3. (continued) 
9 Another potential problem is loss of heat input, possibly due to heating plant shutdown or failure. 
It is vital to not expose the culture organisms to a rapid 40~ temperature drop. Even if the 
thermal shock is tempered by the water mass in the tank, it is almost certain to still be fatal. 
Prompt action is essential. Note in Fig. 16.1 that an alarm system is provided. If prompt restart 
of heating can not be accomplished, the cold water inflow must be stopped and water 
conservation measures (priority allocations and aeration) implemented. Auxiliary heating, such as 
immersion heaters, might be used to allow some cold water inflow. Electric heaters may not help 
much if the original failure is a loss of electric power to the building heating system's controls. 
In this case, a backup power source, even if limited, might prove critical. If the tank runs dry, the 
headbox pump must be turned off to prevent pump damage. 
9 Another potential disaster is loss of seawater inflow. Since this heat exchanger is manually 
controlled, the water in the tank would be heated to levels well beyond those desired before 
being depleted. This type of failure would expose the culture organisms to a high temperature 
thermal shock followed by loss of flow. Prompt action is also required in this case. If water 
inflow can not be quickly restored or otherwise acquired, the heating must be turned off and the 
same water conservation measures previously mentioned imposed. 
loss of water may result in decreasing dissolved oxygen concentration or buildup of ammonia 
and other metabolics. The loss of water can be partially compensated by increasing aeration. 
However, this can be done only if the failure is immediately detected and action taken. As 
a consequence, heat-exchanger culture-water output temperatures are a common monitoring

Example 11.4. Performance of given shell and tube heat exchanger 
You acquire use of a single pass counter-flow shell and tube titanium heat exchanger with 10 ft 2 of heat 
transfer area in a hot water loop as shown in Fig. 11.2. The dedicated hot water circulator provides 10 gpm at 
a temperature of 200~ at the heat exchanger. You have to maintain marine animals at 70~ during the winter. 
The coldest winter seawater temperature is 30~ the salinity is 30 ppt and you can assume negligible heat 
losses in and around the heat exchanger. 
(A) What is the maximum seawater flow rate you can count upon during the coldest part of the winter? 
The heat gained by the seawater must equal the heat lost by the hot water. The seawater inlet and 
outlet temperatures and hot water inlet temperature and flow are known. The seawater flow rate, hot 
water outlet temperature and the heat transfer (Q in BTU/h) are not known. The specific heat of 
seawater and freshwater are both about 1. The average specific weight of the seawater is estimated at 
63.8 lb/fl 3 and 61.0 for the hot freshwater. F is the unknown seawater flow rate, T the hot water 
exit outlet temperature and 0.1337 the conversion factor (Table A-l) for gal to ft 3. The most 
pessimistic U of 225 from Table 11.1 for this type of heat exchanger is used in Eq. 11.1.

From inspection of the above and interpolation, the maximum seawater flow rate is about 13.6 gpm. 
(B) Assume that the boiler is relatively inefficient and the hot water distribution system is poorly insulated so 
that only half of the fuel oil's energy reaches the heat exchanger. If your seawater flow rate is the maximum, 
what is your worst case daily fuel consumption? 
From Fig. 11.1, temperature change is 40~ 50%, read 6.8 gal/day per gpm 
6.8(13.6) = 92.5 gal/day 
point on alarm systems. After the problem causing the shutdown is resolved, the system must 
be carefully restarted to prevent thermal transients that may stress or kill the culture organisms. 
Another major source of problems with heating and cooling systems involves problems 
with the control system. Much of the available literature deals with temperature-control 
problems, especially for research applications (Appendix H). A typical heating arrangement 
using hot water from a boiler is shown in Fig. 11.2. If the process (culture) water flow rate and 

161 
the ambient seawater temperature stay constant or change only slowly over a long period of 
time, this control system may be unnecessary (see Fig. 16.1). In this case the control system in 
the boiler, which maintained the hot water output from the boiler at a constant set temperature, 
and a heat-exchanger hot-water supply valve could be relied upon to accurately control the 
heat-exchanger culture-water output temperature. If there are tidal or daily ambient-seawater 
flow rate or temperature variations, a more active control system as shown in Fig. 11.2 will be 
required. This system monitors the process-water output temperature from the heat exchanger 
and controls a three way valve to bypass or use hot water from the boiler. If the 'dead band' 
on the heat-exchanger controller is set too wide, the resulting temperature fluctuations may 
stress the animals. This effect can be greatly reduced with higher water residence time in the 
culture units to dilute the temperature-controlled influent. If the band is too tight, the control 
system will be continuously operating, may overshoot and may become unstable, producing 
temperature pulses. If the power or air to the controller fails, the heating system will usually 
fail closed, which is the same as a heat loss. If it is configured to fail open, the culture 
organisms may be unintentionally cooked.

Aeration and Degassing 
12.1 Aeration system requirements 
Aeration or the addition of oxygen is one of the most common processes needed in 
culture systems. This may be required due to use of seawaters low in dissolved oxygen or 
to increase carrying capacity. Seawater may be supersaturated with oxygen and nitrogen gas 
due to heating, photosynthesis or breaking waves. Operational problems with piping, pumps, 
and water processing equipment, heating of process water, or aeration can also result in high 
levels of gas supersaturation (Colt, 1986). In addition, seawater from wells may contain high 
levels of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide gases. All of these later conditions may require 
degassing. 
The design of aeration equipment is based on (1) the amount of oxygen needed, (2) the 
minimum dissolved oxygen concentration, and (3) the concentration of other gases such as 
nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide. For juvenile fish and crustaceans, a minimum 
criterion of 6 mg/1 dissolved oxygen is generally used. It may be desirable to maintain 
dissolved oxygen higher than 6 mg/1, especially for eggs and very small fry. The average 
daily oxygen demand of aquatic species can be computed from Eq. 2.20 as a function of 
temperature and weight or from Eq. 2.21 as a function of ration. For salmon and trout, 
maximum daily oxygen demand is commonly assumed to be 1.44 times the average rate (Eq. 
2.22). This assumption may under-estimate oxygen demand for active fish and over-estimate 
the oxygen consumption for mollusks. 
Aeration and reuse of water can increase the carrying capacity, if all the other water quality 
parameters are acceptable. Due to the high pH of seawater, un-ionized ammonia may be more 
limiting than dissolved oxygen under many situations (Section 2.7). Aeration and reuse of 
water under these conditions will result in increased disease and mortality problems. 
Commonly, aerators are designed to produce oxygen concentrations equal to 90-95% 
of local saturation values. As will be discussed in a following section, it is generally not 
economical to achieve saturation. For applications that have very high oxygen demands or 
requirements for oxygen concentrations greater than 95% of saturation, pure oxygen aeration 
systems should be considered (Colt and Watten, 1988; Colt and Orwicz, 1991b). 
12.2 Gravity aerators 
Gravity aerators operate by allowing the water to run down over a physical substrate, 
thereby increasing the available air-water surface area. Gas transfer takes place at this inter- 
face. Since the process occurs at atmospheric pressure, there is no chance of producing gas 
supersaturation as there is with submerged aerators. Based on mass-balance considerations,

the amount of total and available dissolved oxygen in the effluent from a gravity aerator is 
equal to: 
Total dissolved oxygen (lb/h) = 5.00 • 10-4(Q)(DOout)

Avail. dissolved oxygen (lb/h) = 5.00 • 10-4(Q)(DOout- DOmin) 
(12.2) 
where Q is flow (gpm), DOout is effluent dissolved oxygen (mg/1), and DOmin is minimum 
dissolved oxygen (rag/l) 
Three common types of gravity aerators are shown in Fig. 12.1. The packed column aerator 
(Fig. 12.1A) consists of a column filled with a large surface area of a plastic medium. These 
mediums are available in a variety of sizes and shapes, such as barrel-shaped, curved or round. 
An ideal medium would have a high specific surface area (medium's surface area/medium's 
volume) and low resistance to air and water flow. While small mediums tend to have higher 
specific volume, biofouling may limit the use of a medium with a dimension of one-half inch 
or smaller. Many of the available types of mediums are also commonly used in biofilters (see

Section 15.2). Water runs downward over the medium in a thin film, allowing absorption of 
oxygen from the air. The perforated tray aerator (Fig. 12.1B) consists of a series of vertically 
stacked perforated trays. Oxygen is absorbed as the water drips from one tray to the next. The 
lattice aerator (Fig. 12.1C) consists of a number of straight steps. The water runs down the 
steps in a thin film; thus, oxygen is transferred into the water. 
Important design considerations for gravity aerators include hydraulic loading rate 
(gpm/ft2), total available height (elevation), and operational limitations. Since the perfor- 
mance of the units will vary with temperature and influent water quality, design should 
be based on the specific project conditions. In the absence of specific site conditions, the 
most conservative values must be used. This will generally result in a workable system, but 
at increased costs. While gravity aerators are simple and have no moving parts, they only 
function when water is flowing; therefore, they may not be suitable for some applications. 
12.2.1 Packed Columns 
The design of packed columns is based on influent DO concentrations, effluent DO 
concentrations, temperature, and salinity. Based on the work presented by Hackney and Colt 
(1982), column heights are presented for an influent DO = 0.0 mg/1 (Fig. 12.2) and an

Fig. 12.3. Packed aerator column height with DOin - 5 mg/1. Calculations assume 1.5 inch pall rings and a salinity 
of 35 g/kg. Calculated from Hackney and Colt, 1982. 
influent DO -- 5.0 mg/1 (Fig. 12.3). These column heights include 0.25 ft for the influent line 
and 0.25 ft for the outlet collection system. It is also assumed that no distribution plate is used, 
reducing the efficiency of the column by 25%. Figs. 12.2 and 12.3 are based on a medium of 
1.5 inch pall tings, a readily available size with good overall characteristics. The performance 
of packed columns based on mediums with other sizes and shapes can be calculated with the 
design equations presented by Hackney and Colt (1982). 
The required column height to achieve 90% saturation, decreases as the temperature 
increases; however, the required height to achieve a given DOout, in mg/1, significantly in- 
creases with increasing temperature. In the absence of influent dissolved oxygen information, 
Fig. 12.2 should be used for seawater wells and Fig. 12.3 for surface waters and reaeration 
of process waters (see Example 12.1A). If designing to achieve 90% of saturation, the design 
column height must be based on the minimum yearly temperature. If designing to achieve a 
dissolved oxygen concentration in mg/1, the design column must be based on the maximum 
yearly temperature. The required column heights increase significantly as the desired effluent 
DO concentration approaches saturation. Theoretically, an infinitely high column is required 
to produce a saturated effluent concentration. 
Based on a conservative hydraulic-loading rate of 25 gpm/ft 2, the capacity of standard 
large-diameter plastic pipe suitable for packed column aerators is presented in Table 12.1.

Example 12.1. Evaluation of aerator options 
A flow-through system with a flow of 250 gpm is used to rear cod to a weight of 1.25 lb each. Assume a 
maximum feeding rate of 1.5%/day, an influent DO of 5 rag/l, a minimum DO of 6 mg/1, water temperature 
of 10~ and salinity of 30 g/kg. 
(A) Compute the required height for a packed column to support 1,300 animals. 
Ration = (1300 animals)(1.25 lb/animal)(0.015) = 24.4 lb feed/day 
Eq. 2.22, using an OFR : 0.20 lb/lb feed (0.20 kg/kg feed) 
Maximum oxygen demand -- 1.44 x 0.20 x 24.4.45 = 7.03 lb/day 
= 7.03/24 -- 0.293 lb oxygen/h 
Eq. 12.2, 0.293 = (5 x 10-4)(250)(DOout - 6), DOout = 8.34 mg/1 
Using Fig. 12.3, read column height = 5.2 ft

Percent saturation influent --- (5.0/9.32) 100 = 54%

Since there is little pressure on the column walls, the columns can be constructed from 
thin PVC pipe or fiberglass. Depending on the configuration of the system, it may be more 
desirable to use a number of smaller columns rather than one large column. This is especially 
true if the packed column is used prior to filtration. Under these conditions, fouling of the 
medium by barnacles, mussels or debris may be serious and it may be necessary to clean the 
column periodically. If a fully redundant system is designed (two columns), potential fouling 
organisms can be killed by alternating between the two columns every 2-3 weeks. For small 
columns, it may be practical to simply replace the fouled column with a clean unit. The 
biofouling organisms can be killed by allowing the column to dry. 
12.2.2 Perforated Tray Aerator 
Detailed design information is not available for the perforated-plate aerators. Strasburg 
(1964) presents plans for a 100 gpm unit for aeration of anaerobic water from a seawater well 
for use with skipjack (Fig. 12.1B). The final design consisted of 16 perforated trays at 2 inch 
vertical intervals. The tray having 1/8 inch holes at 1/2 inch intervals. The overall dimensions 
of the aerator were 7 x 7 x 4 ft high. The trays could be withdrawn for cleaning, although 
this was not required due to the lack of biofouling with well water. This type of system may 
be ideal for small-scale applications, although the hydraulic loading (2.0 gpm/ft 2) is about 
1/12 of that for a packed column, resulting in a much larger unit for a given flow. 
12.2.3 Lattice Aerator 
A lattice type of aerator (Fig. 12.1C) is used in the La Jolla laboratory of the National 
Marine Fisheries Service (Lasker and Vlymen, 1969). The performance of a lattice aerator is 
presented in Fig. 12.4 as a function of influent DO and total height. These data are based on 
2 inch steps, 36 degree slope, and 7.39 gpm/ft of width. This aerator is probably useful for 
aerating normal seawater with oxygen concentrations not too far from saturation, but would 
require excessive heights for water with low dissolved oxygen concentrations. For a flow of 
100 gpm and a loading of 7.39 gpm/ft, the width of the system would be 13.5 ft. Increasing 
the hydraulic loading rate will decrease the performance. The surface area contained in a 
lattice aerator, 10 x 10 x 5 ft high, is equal to the surface area of only 5 ft 3 of 1.5 inch pall 
tings. One significant advantage of this type of system is that it is relatively resistant to the 
growth of fouling organisms such as barnacles and mussels (see Example 12.1B). 
12.3 Submerged aerators 
Submerged aerators can be placed directly in the rearing or holding system and generally 
use a central source of low pressure air. Therefore, a number of individual units can 
be operated from one blower and individual units can easily be turned off and on. Gas 
supersaturation, corrosion and biofouling problems will limit the use of many of the more 
efficient submerged aerators. 
Only two types of submerged aerators are commonly used in seawater systems: diffused 
aerators and airlift pumps. The diffused aerator consists of a porous diffuser connected to a 
source of low pressure air, or in some systems, low pressure oxygen. Diffusers can be made

of porous bonded silica, carbon, or polyethylene, and can be found in a range of shapes and 
sizes. The diffusers produce small bubbles. As the bubbles pass through the water, oxygen is 
transferred from the bubbles into the water. An airlift pump consists of a vertical tube with a 
diffused aerator placed inside the tube at, or near, its bottom. If the airlift pump is used for 
pumping (raising the water above the water surface), the vertical pipe will extend above the 
water surface (Fig. 12.5A). In many cases the airlift pump is used for mixing, and oxygen 
transfer, and therefore does not extend above the surface (Fig. 12.5B). 
The transfer efficiency of submerged aerators is usually stated at standard conditions of 
barometric pressure of 760 mm Hg (1 atm), temperature of 20~ 
and clean water conditions. 
The standard transfer efficiency is expressed in lb oxygen/hp per hour, or kg oxygen/kW per 
hour. The transfer efficiency under other conditions (Colt and Tchobanoglous, 1981) can be 
computed from the following equations: 
(flCeff -- C) 1.024T-20Ot

The mean effective saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen (Cen) is greater than the 
saturated values at the surface (Fig. 12.6) due to the effect of hydrostatic pressure. The actual 
increase in concentration will depend on the type of diffuser, bubble size, contact time, and 
turbulence. In the absence of specific data, the following relationships may be used: 
Ceff - C~eld (1.00 + K Z)

In freshwater catfish ponds, values of fi are approximately equal to 1.0 and the value 
ot ranges from 0.66 to 1.07 (Shelton and Boyd, 1983). Under intensive culture conditions, 
values of fl may be lower than found in ponds. It is important to note that the fi value can

fugacity) rather than concentration. Temperature will be the dominant factor in determining 
transfer efficiencies.

The transfer efficiency under field condition depends strongly on the dissolved oxygen 
concentration (C) that is needed or desired. For a fine bubble diffuser, salinity of 35 g/kg, 
ot = 0.9,/~ = 1.0, diffuser depth 3 ft, the transfer efficiency under field condition is presented 
as a function of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration in Fig. 12.7. 
The standard transfer rates of airlift pumps may be only 1/5 to 1/2 of the value for diffused 
aeration systems (Loyless and Malone, 1998). This appears to be due to the coalescence of air 
bubbles as they rise up the airlift riser. 
12.3.1 Absorption Efficiency 
Absorption efficiency is the percent of oxygen transferred from the air to the water. The 
absorption efficiency depends on temperature, water depth, air flow, type of diffuser, and 
dissolved oxygen concentration (Mavinic and Bewtra, 1976). Air flow rate is measured in 
terms of standard cubic feet per minute and represents the flow rate at a temperature of 68~

pressure of 14.7 psi (1 atm or 760 mm Hg), and 36% relative humidity. One standard 
cubic foot of air contains 0.0521 lb of air and 0.0173 lb of oxygen. The variation of absorption 
efficiency with depth and dissolved oxygen concentration is presented in Fig. 12.8. This is 
derived from freshwater data and a flow of 2.0 standard cubic feet of air per minute per square 
foot (Mavinic and Bewtra, 1976). The absorption efficiency is reduced at low water depths 
and high dissolved oxygen concentration. At typical aquaculture conditions, less than 1% of 
the oxygen is absorbed by the water. The actual mass of oxygen absorbed into the water is 
equal to: 
Oxygen absorbed (lb/h) = (1.038)(AE)(Qair) 
(12.7) 
where AE - absorption efficiency (decimal fraction, value in Fig. 12.8 divided by 100), and 
Qair is air flow (standard cubic feet per minute - scfm). 
The design of submerged aeration systems (diffused and airlift pumps) includes the design 
and specification of the diffusers, number of diffusers, piping, and blower. Design will

strongly depend on temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration, and diffuser depth. 
Once the oxygen demand is computed, the aeration system can be sized by two methods. 
The first method involves the estimation of the field transfer efficiency (Fig. 12.7) as a function 
of the temperature and required dissolved oxygen concentration and the computation of the 
total blower power from: 
1.50 • OD 
Blower power (hp) = 
(12.8) 
N 
where OD -- oxygen demand (lb/h), and N is transfer efficiency (lb oxygen/hp per hour). 
The factor 1.50 is equivalent to assuming that the overall efficiency of the motor and blower 
is 67%. This method can be used to estimate the power requirement for a complete system 
(see Example 12.1C). 
The second method involves computing the required air flow rather than the blower power. 
Once the absorption efficiency is determined from Fig. 12.8, the oxygen absorbed can be 
computed. This method may be more convenient when the amount of air is fixed or the air 
flow per unit is known from other considerations. 
12.3.2 Blower Selection 
Air used for aeration must be oil-free and typically in the 3-5 psi range. Three common 
types of low pressure compressors are the rotary vane compressors, rotary lobe compressors, 
and regenerative blowers. When the rotary vanes are constructed from carbon, a small amount 
of fine carbon dust may be present in process air. This material can be filtered, but is inert and 

174 
should have no effect on most aquatic animals. High pressure building air (60 to 100 psi) can 
be used, but must be filtered to remove oil and water. Many high pressure compressors are not 
rated for continuous duty and the high volume demand from an aeration system may result in 
early compressor failure as well as high power costs. 
The output of low pressure blowers depends on their discharge pressure and varies from 
high flow at low pressure, to low flow at high pressure. As the pressure of a blower is 
increased beyond the normal operating range, a phenomenon called surging may occur. This 
results in the rapid fluctuation in output between maximum and zero pressure. Surging can 
result in serious damage to bearings and rotating components. Most blowers are protected 
from surging by the installation of a high pressure relief valve. The relief valve will prevent 
the pressure from exceeding a safe level. The selection of a blower will depend on the air 
flow rate and system head (or pressure) requirements. The total pressure that a blower has 
to produce depends on the depth of submergence of the diffuser, the pressure losses through 
the diffuser, and the pressure losses in the distribution systems. Similar to Chapter 6, it is 
usually more convenient to express pressures in units of head or elevation (see Section 6.4 
for definition). Some care has to be taken with clearly identifying the fluid column being 
considered. A unit head of water and one of air are quite different. Typically a blower is 
connected to a distribution system and a diffuser at a given submergence or depth below the 
surface. The head at the blower will be equal to: 
Total head (ft) = submergence + ULpipe § HLdiffuser 
(12.9) 
where submergence is submergence depth of diffuser (ft), HLpipe is head losses in the pipes 
(ft), and HLdiffuser is head losses in the diffuser (ft). The submergence term is equal simply 
to the submergence depth of the diffuser. The HLpipe term depends on air flow, pipe size, 
pipe roughness, and pipe length. Head losses in plastic pipe as a function of flow and pipe 
size are calculated the same way as was done with water in Section 6.4. In this case the 
fluid is air and the equivalent sand roughness values for clean pipe (Table 6.3) can be used, 
because there is no risk of biofouling with air. Typical piping frictional losses are presented 
in Table 12.2. Since blower manufacturers usually present their compressor data in psi, and to 
avoid possible confusion between heads of water and air, the frictional losses in the table are 
presented in psi per 100 ft of pipe. At the low pressures being considered, gas compressibility 
is not a major factor. However, the gas temperature will vary in the piping and choosing a 
representative temperature value is difficult. The compression of air in the compressor results 
in a significant rise in the temperature of the air. These high temperatures will be seen by the 
compressor's discharge piping. If this piping is made from synthetic materials such as plastics, 
the temperature may be high enough to substantially reduce the strength of the pipe and to 
release from the piping potentially toxic compounds to the compressed air. Such problems 
are most likely to occur when two parallel compressors are turned on at the same time. 
Considerable care should be taken with the piping in the immediate area of the compressor 
and a section of steel pipe may be needed. The HLdiffuser term depends strongly on the type 
of diffuser (the smaller the bubbles the higher the head losses) and air flow rate. Commonly 
only the frictional loss at the rated flow capacity (either in head or pressure units) is published 
by diffuser manufacturers. To determine the head losses at other flow rates, it is necessary 
to calculate the loss coefficient (K) for the diffuser the same as one would do for any other 
piping component (see Section 6.5).

Calculations based on Schedule 40 PVC pipe internal diameters, pipe equivalent sand roughness of 4.2 • 10 -5 
ft, average pressure of 3 psi, average air temperature of 90~ and an air kinematic viscosity of 1.7 • 10 -4 ft2/s. 
Velocities are in ft/s and frictional losses in psi per 100 ft of pipe. Under this temperature and pressure, the SCFM 
volume is 13% greater than actual and the conversion for frictional head losses in feet of air to psi is loss (psi) -- 
head (ft)/1661. 
Once the total head losses of the system at different flow rates are computed, a compressor 
(air pump) must be selected to supply the desired flow. This is exactly the same match-up 
problem between system and pump presented in Section 7.4. At the operating point, the head 
(or pressure) produced by the blower must be equal to the losses in the system (Fig. 12.9). 
Blower manufacturers and distributors are very helpful in this process. It should be noted 
that if rearing or holding units are operated with different water depths, the system must be 
designed to provide air to the deepest unit. Valves must be installed on the distribution lines to 
the shallower units to increase the head losses. If this is not done, all the air will flow to the 
shallower units. 
If the total system head losses increase, the blower output will decrease. The greatest 
source of increasing system head losses is diffuser clogging from either pipe scale or bacterial 
growth on the exterior of the diffuser. Some diffusers can be cleaned by soaking in acid 
or chlorine solutions. Removal of scale lodged deeply in the diffuser may be difficult or 
impossible. External clogging occurs more rapidly if the diffuser is submerged but not in 
use (i.e., no air flow). Therefore, diffusers should be removed from the water when not in 
use. 
12.3.3 Pumping and Mixing 
In many situations, mixing rather than aeration is needed. Larval culture must be continu- 
ously mixed to (1) prevent the animals from settling out, (2) prevent the feed from settling out, 
or (3) distribute both the feed and animals evenly over the rearing volume. Phytoplankton and

seaweed cultures may be mixed to give the individual organisms exposure to the light, prevent 
settling, and to steepen gas concentration gradients on plant surfaces. 
Both diffused aeration and airlift pumps may be used for mixing. The mixing characteristics 
of diffused aerators is not well documented, but they have been used extensively in culture 
systems. Coarse bubble diffusers and high airflow rates may be more useful for mixing than 
medium or fine bubble diffusers. The design of a mixing systems is based on the criterion 
for pumping or a turnover rate (pumping flow rate/rearing volume). The number of units and 
their size are to be specified to achieve the required turnover rate. A number of smaller units 
may provide a more uniform mixing condition than a few large units. 
The distance between the water surface and the point to which the water is pumped is the 
lift. The submergence is the distance between the water surface and the level where the air is 
introduced. The percent submergence (Fig. 12.5A) is equal to: 
submergence (ft) 
Submergence ratio - X = 
(12.10) 
submergence + lift (ft) 
The maximum pumping rate of an air-lift pump depends on the submergence, lift, and pipe 
diameter (Spotte, 1979): 
Q - [(0.758x3/z)(L1/3) + 0.11961]d 22 
(12.11) 
where Q is water flow rate (1/min), X is submergence ratio, L is submergence + lift (cm), 
and d is inner pipe diameter (cm). 

177 
Example 12.2. Air lift pump 
A 4 inch (10 cm) diameter airlift pump picks up water 30 inches below the surface and drops it 1.5 inches 
above the surface. Calculate the submergence ratio and estimate the water flow rate in lpm and gpm for air 
flows of 1, 5, and 10 ft3/min. 
Eq. 12.10, submergence ratio is 30/(30 + 1.5) -- 0.95 
Fig. 12.10, using D = 10 cm, X = 0.95, air injection at 30 inches -- 76 cm, 
approximately equal to 75 cm (line D) 
1 ft 3/min air --- 90 lpm (24 gpm) 
5 ft3/min air --- 190 lpm (53 gpm) 
10 ft3/min air = 260 lpm (68 gpm) 
At high submergence ratios, the efficiency of the airlift pump is comparable to a centrifugal 
pump. Below a submergence ratio of 0.50, the efficiency of the airlift decrease rapidly 
(see Example 12.2). For applications requiting lifts of 0.1 to 3 ft, airlift pumps may be 
more efficient that centrifugal pumps, especially for flows less than 50 gpm. The selection 
of low-flow, low-head pumps is limited, especially for marine applications. The primary 
applications for low-head pumps are for irrigation or flood control and flow rates of 10,000 to 
100,000 gpm are not uncommon. When centrifugal pumps are used for low-head applications, 
it is likely that they are medium- or high-head pumps operated far to the left of their best 
efficiency point (bep) and at a low efficiency. 
No general expression is available for the computation of the gas-to-liquid (G/L) ratio at 
the maximum water flow rate. The G/L ratios typically ranges from 3 to 35. Smaller G/L 
ratios can be used at high submergence ratios and for small diameter pipes. Generally, the air 
is introduced into the airlift at a single point without a diffuser. 
Parker and Suttle (1987) present water flow rate versus air flow rate for submergence ratios 
in the range of 0.90 to 1.00 for a number of pipe sizes. These types of airlift pumps are 
used for mixing. The maximum water flow rate occurred when the air was introduced at the 
lowest depth (Fig. 12.10). The water flow rate depended on the logarithm of the airflow rate. 
Therefore, a linear increase in water flow rate requires a proportionally larger increase in the 
airflow rate. 
The pumping characteristics of airlift pumps depend strongly on the construction of the 
units, especially the entrance and exit conditions (Loyless and Malone, 1998). Since their 
construction is simple and inexpensive, there is little standardization among designs. Care 
must be taken when applying published performance information. Under some operating 
conditions, the pumping performance of airlifts does not depend on the type of injector or 
diffuser used (Loyless and Malone, 1998). For a given system and airflow rate, the water flow 
rate was the same, but the power requirement for the diffuser option was significantly higher 
because of the higher head losses in the diffuser. However, the oxygen transfer and carbon 
dioxide stripping characteristics of the diffuser option was superior under most airflow rates. 
Therefore, there may be design trade-offs between the pumping and gas transfer requirements 
of a single unit.

12.4 Gas supersaturation and degassing 
The use of submerged aeration equipment can result in lethal dissolved gas concentrations 
(Colt and Westers, 1982). For sensitive larval fish, this can occur at diffuser submergences 
as small as 1.0 m (Cornacchia and Colt, 1984). Higher levels of gas supersaturation result 
from the use of a fine bubble diffuser and other highly efficient submerged aerators. 
Approximate limits for diffuser submergence are presented in Fig. 12.6. Gas supersaturation 
problems will be relatively more serious in marine larval systems due to their increased 
sensitivity and required high concentrations of dissolved oxygen. In production systems, 
higher submergence can be tolerated because the ambient dissolved-oxygen concentration is 
likely to be significantly below saturation. 
Natural seawater may be supersaturated with dissolved gas from photosynthesis, solar 
heating, or air injection. Air entrainment on the suction side of pumps is a very serious 
problem in seawater systems due to rapid absorption of air (Kils, 1976). Air may be entrained 
due to leaks in the suction piping or through the pump seals (Colt, 1986). If saturated seawater 
is heated more than about 10~ (5.6~ 
it must be degassed prior to use. Lethal levels of 
gas supersaturation can be produced by submerged aeration systems and improper operation 
of water quality processes. In critical applications, the in-line installation of gas monitoring 
equipment is prudent (Bouck, 1982). 
The packed column, perforated tray, lattice aerator, and diffused aerators have all been used 
to degas water. The packed column is probably the most efficient degassing system (Bouck 
et al., 1984), but some of the other types may be used under special conditions. Also, more 
design information is available for the packed column compared to the alternative degassing 
systems. Perforated trays and lattice can be used for both aeration and degassing applications. 
These two systems are best suited for the degassing of natural seawater and probably should 
not be used for the degassing of highly supersaturated seawater.

Fig. 12.11. Degassing column heights for surface waters. Figure presents values that might be typical of 
supersaturated surface waters. Calculations based on 1.5 inch pall rings, influent supersaturation of 200 mm Hg, 
effluent supersaturation criteria of 20 mm Hg, and effluent DO criteria of 90% of oxygen saturation. 
The design of packed columns for degassing will depend on the gas supersaturation level, 
gas supersaturation criteria, temperature, salinity, and medium's size (Colt and Bouck, 1984). 
The gas supersaturation criteria will depend on the species, life-stage and specific gases 
involved, but a maximum criterion of 20 mm Hg of total gas supersaturation can be used for 
many organisms. 
Naturally occurring gas supersaturation levels will strongly depend on rare or infrequent 
events such as storms, extreme low tides, or periods of high solar heating and low winds. Gas 
supersaturation levels in subsurface waters will be relatively more constant. 
The required column height for degassing will depend primarily on influent DO and A P 
(pressure above saturation, mm Hg) values. The column height information is presented in 
Fig. 12.11 for typical surface water (AP is 100 mm Hg) and in Fig. 12.12 for a groundwater 
(AP is 200 mm Hg). These figures are based on a packing medium of 1.5 inch pall tings, 
an effluent dissolved oxygen criteria of 90% saturation, an effluent gas supersaturation A P 
criteria of 20 mm Hg, 0.25 ft elevation allowed for inlet distribution and 0.25 ft for the outlet 
collection system. For different dissolved gas criteria or influent gas levels, column heights 
can be computed from Colt and Bouck (1984). 
The physical design of the degassing columns is identical to the aeration column presented 
previously. The cross-sectional area of the column can be based on a loading rate of 25 
gpm/ft 2 or Table 12.1. As with the packed columns used for aeration, fouling by barnacles 
and mussels may be a problem and columns should be designed to allow easy replacement of 
mediums or with complete redundancy (i.e., at least two separate columns). 
The use of submerged systems, such as diffused aeration or airlift pumps, can result in 
some level of gas supersaturation (see Fig. 12.6). These systems will not reduce dissolved 
gas concentrations to equilibrium, regardless of the duration of aeration, and are unsuited 
for critical degassing applications. Diffused aeration or airlift pumps may have application 
in maintenance of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in phytoplankton or

greenhouse systems, or in other situations where slightly supersaturated concentrations of 
specific gases are desirable. 
12.5 Removal of other gases 
A number of other gases may need to be stripped out of process water. These include 
methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide. The removal of carbon dioxide and hydrogen 
sulfide present special problems because of their high solubility and liquid-phase chemical 
reactions. 
Methane is an insoluble gas that may be found in groundwaters and some ponds with 
high organic inputs. The bubbles observed rising from seawater ponds contain a significant 
amount of methane. Conventional packed column aerators are effective in removing this gas. 
In applications where a large amount of methane is present, the columns should be vented 
to the outside to avoid the potential for accumulation of explosive concentrations of methane 
gas. 
The carbon dioxide gas concentrations in marine groundwaters is highly variable and 
can typically range from below saturation (less than 0.5 mg/1) to 30-40 mg/1. While the 
concentration of carbon dioxide in surface waters is variable (and important to marine 
chemists), these variations are not important under most conditions. Carbon dioxide gas is 
difficult to remove because of its high solubility. Gas-to-liquid ratios in the range of 5-10 are 
needed to remove a significant amount of carbon dioxide (Piedrahita and Grace, 1994). 
When carbon dioxide gas is added to water, a portion is converted to bicarbonate and 
carbonate ions. Only the portion of carbon dioxide that is a gas can be removed in a gas 
transfer system. The kinetics of the carbonate system are slow compared to hydraulic transit 
time through a packed column. Therefore, only 40-50% of the added carbon dioxide gas can 
be removed by a well-designed packed column. For critical applications, packed columns are 

181 
not the best choice for carbon dioxide removal. The perforated tray or lattice aerator operated 
at very low hydraulic loading may have higher removal efficiency for carbon dioxide. Pure 
oxygen aeration systems remove a negligible amount of carbon dioxide because of very low 
gas flows. Diffused aeration or airlift pumps can also be used to remove carbon dioxide gas 
from culture units (Loyless and Malone, 1998). It is also important to note that the build-up 
of carbon dioxide gas in the gas phase will significantly reduce the effectiveness of carbon 
dioxide removal. High gas-phase concentrations of carbon dioxide have occurred in laboratory 
facilities built under strict energy conservation codes (restricted air flow rate). 
Hydrogen sulfide is similar to carbon dioxide, with high solubility and liquid-phase 
reactions with water. A forced-draft packed column is needed to strip significant amounts of 
hydrogen sulfide (Howe and Lawler, 1989). Because of the liquid-phase reactions, the amount 
of hydrogen sulfide removed depends very strongly on pH.

Chapter 13 
Disinfection 
13.1 Considerations and options 
Disinfection is the reduction in the number of bacteria, viruses, or fungi to a desired 
concentration. Sterilization, or the complete elimination of all microorganisms, is generally 
not needed or in most cases not possible. The actual concentration of microorganisms required 
to cause a disease (or some other criteria) is not well-defined under most conditions, and 
disinfection procedures have developed primarily from an empirical basis. 
Disinfection may be needed for two distinctly different situations: (1) disinfection of nets, 
holding facilities, and piping prior to use; and (2) disinfection of process water prior to use or 
before reuse. In general, the first situation is much simpler as toxicity to culture organisms is 
not usually a problem. In the second case, the toxicity of the disinfection agent and its residues 
or derivatives to non-target organisms (i.e., culture organisms) is critical and will control the 
disinfection process. 
The effectiveness of a given disinfectant depends on the concentration of disinfectant, contact 
time, temperature, turbidity, particulate concentration, and specific microorganisms. Because 
the concentration of microorganisms varies widely, microorganism concentrations are typically 
expressed in what are called log units. If concentrations are expressed in #/ml, then the log 
concentration is equal to the base 10 logarithm of the actual concentration (see Table 13.1). 
The effect of disinfectant concentration and contact time on the mortality of typical 
microorganisms is presented in Fig. 13.1. For many microorganisms, the rate of kill is a 
straight line on a semi-log plot. Therefore, it takes the same time to reduce the concentration 
of microorganisms from 1,000,000 to 100,000/ml as from 100 to 10/ml.

Fig. 13.1. Effect of disinfectant concentration and contact time on mortality of typical microorganisms. 
Note that a reduction in 1 log units is equal to a 90% reduction in concentration and a 
reduction in 2 log units is equal to a 99.0% reduction in concentration. Generally, as the 
concentration of disinfectant is increased, the rate of kill is increased. Therefore, to achieve 
a given final concentration of microorganisms, a high disinfectant concentration at a short 
contact time or a low concentration at a long contact time may be used. 
The options in disinfecting equipment are various chemicals, chlorine being the most 
common, and steam cleaning. Small steam generators are commonly used to disinfect culture 
equipment after a disease incident and work well on concrete, fiberglass, and epoxy tank 
surfaces but are unsuitable for most plastics or inaccessible areas, such as pipes. Chemicals 
can also be used to disinfect process water but only on a batch basis. Ultraviolet (UV) light is 
the most common method used in-line to treat process water. With some care, ozone treatment 
may also be useable in-line. 
13.2 Chemical compounds 
There are many chemical disinfectants including chlorine, quaternary ammonium com- 
pounds, formalin, and iodine compounds. A good review of chemical options can be found 
in Flick (1998). An ideal disinfectant should quickly destroy bacteria, viruses, and fungi, but 
should have low toxicity to humans. The most commonly used disinfectants for netting and 
rearing containers are iodophors (organic iodine complexes) and common chlorine. 
Concentrations of iodophor in the range of 50-100 mg/1 for 10-30 min can be used 
to disinfect culturing equipment. One advantage of iodophors is the amber color which 
indicates the disinfectant is effective (Amend and Conte, 1982). Once the color turns yellow 
or colorless, it is no longer effective. While an ideal disinfectant, costs may limit the use of 
iodophor for large-scale applications.

Values derived from recommendations of Amend and Conte (1982) and Hnath (1983). Assumes 3.70% available 
chlorine from bleach and 65% from calcium hypochlorite. 
The most widely used disinfectant is chlorine. This may be applied as sodium hypochlorite 
(common liquid bleach), dry calcium hypochlorite or electrically generated in place from 
seawater. Chlorine is often used to disinfect in the batch mode (i.e., no flow-through) at 
relatively high concentrations and in the absence of any culture organisms. Concentrations 
recommended by Amend and Conte (1982) and Hnath (1983) for disinfection are presented in 
Table 13.2. These concentrations are based on 65% available chlorine for calcium hypochlorite 
and 3.70% available chlorine for sodium hypochlorite (bleach). Sodium hypochlorite solutions 
up to 15% are readily available from industrial sources. Household bleach typically is in the 
range of 3.70-5.25% available chlorine. The amount of chlorine compound added will have 
to be adjusted if the available chlorine percentages are different from the values in Table 13.2. 
Calcium hypochlorite (a solid, usually in granulated form) is more stable than sodium 
hypochlorite (a liquid) and occupies less space, but sodium hypochlorite is more available and 
easier to use (see Example 13.1). 
The disinfection power of chlorine depends strongly on pH. The presented time/concen- 
tration recommendations in Table 13.2 are based on addition of glacial acetic acid or sulfuric 
acid to produce a pH = 6.0. If it is not possible or desirable to drop the pH to 6.0, an 
immersion time of 24 h is recommended. The following procedure (Amend and Conte, 1982) 
must be used when acid addition is used. 
(1) Fill the tank or other container with the desired amount of water. 
(2) Add the amount of acid to the water. NEVER ADD WATER TO ACID. 
(3) After the water and acid are mixed, add the required amount of chlorine compound to the 
acidified water. Do NOT ADD THE ACID TO THE CHLORINE COMPOUND. 
Following disinfection, all equipment and holding tanks must be carefully rinsed to 
removed any remaining chlorine residual. First the chlorine containing water should be 
drained and then the water flow resumed. At least 6-10 container volumes should be passed 
through a rearing or holding tank before new animals are added. The surfaces above the water 
level should be washed down several times during this period. Inadequate rinsing of holding 
tanks or nets is a major source of mortality in hatcheries and holding facilities. 
Chlorine is commonly used to disinfect marine mammal pools (Spotte, 1991; Coakley and 
Crawford, 1998). Most marine mammals are relatively tolerant of chlorine residues as are 
people (swimming pools are commonly in the 1-2 mg/1 range and sometimes much higher). 
An exception is the otter, because chlorine and other disinfectants de-grease the fur, which

be added at a minimum before scrubbing the sides and bottom of the tank?

(c) What other important factors should be considered? 
9 Care should be exercised not to expose skin to bleach or disinfecting water; one would be wise to 
wear goggles to avoid possibility of splashing into eyes. 
9 All rims, covers, plugs, equipment (samplers, nets, tools) or other items used in or around the 
tank should be disinfected at the same time to avoid recontamination. 
9 After cleaning, tank and associated equipment they must be well rinsed with clean water and 
allowed to dry before restocking tank to avoid potential toxicity effects to culture organisms. 
the animal counts on for thermoregulation. In reuse systems for dolphins and seals, a chlorine 
residual of 0.4 to 0.7 has been used for the disinfection of seal pool waters (Spotte and Adams, 
1979). To maintain this residual, approximately 2.6 mg/1 of available chlorine had to be added 
daily. Residual concentrations of 1.0 mg/1 and higher are used but are not recommended for 
prolonged exposure. Experience has shown that a chlorine residual of around 0.4 mg/1 is 
sufficient to produce nil fecal coliform readings in seal pools and has no detrimental effects 
on the animals (New England Aquarium). See Example 13.2. Interestingly, biofilters in reuse 
loops can function with chlorine residuals up to 1.0 mg/1, but are seriously degraded. At the 
lower concentrations around 0.4 mg/1, biofilters can function relatively well after a period of 
conditioning. For fish and crustaceans, a chlorine residual of these magnitudes would be lethal 
within a short time. 
Chlorine is also used to disinfect process water for shrimp and oyster hatcheries. Chlorine 
in the range of 1-5 mg/1 is added to filtered seawater and allowed to stand for several 
days prior to use. The chemistry of chlorine compounds in seawater is very complex and 
commonly available tests for chlorine residual are not sensitive enough to detect chronic 
chlorine concentrations. Therefore, the lack of a positive residual may not indicate the absence 
of chlorine toxicity. The decay rate of chlorine compounds depends strongly on light levels 
and the trace composition of the specific seawater. In freshwater, effective dechlorination 
requires chemical addition or activated carbon filtration plus chemical addition (Seegert and 
Brooks, 1978). Activated carbon filtration by itself is not adequate to remove chronic chlorine 
residuals. Sodium thiosulfate and sodium sulfite have commonly been used for dechlorination 

187 
Example 13.2. Disinfection of seal pools by use of chlorine 
You wish to control the coliform concentrations in a large seal pool to a concentration below 1,000 MPN 
(most probable number) per 100 ml as required by US Federal regulations. You know from experience that a 
chlorine residual of 0.4 mg/1 in the pool will produce a nil fecal coliform reading (tested weekly) and is well 
below any level that can in any way be harmful to the seals. The pool receives 200 gpm in a flow-through 
system and the detention time of the pool is 2.5 h. You estimate from experience, that with your conditions 
and maximum biomass loading of about 1,200 lb. of seals, you need a dosage of 8.0 rag/1 of chlorine into 
the pool influent flow to maintain the 0.4 mg/1 pool residual. You wish to use a sodium hyperchlorite 15% 
chlorine solution as your chlorine source. You decide to dilute the 15% dilution with water 10 to 1 to get a 
more dilute and safer solution. 
(A) How many pounds per day of chlorine do you require? 
200 gpm = 200 x 3.8 = 760 1/min 
60 1/min x 8 rag/1 = 6080 mg/min = 8.755 x 106 mg/day = 8.755 kg/day = 19.3 lb/day 
(B) How much of the 15% solution do you need per day? 
lb/day = 19.3/0.15 = 128.7 lb/day of 15% solution which is mostly freshwater at 8.34 lb/gal 
128.7/8.34 = 15.4 gal/day of 15% solution 
(C) What is your actual dosage requirement for the more diluted solution? 
A dilution of 10 to 1 with a 15% solution, new concentration = 15/11 -- 1.36% solution 
0.0136D = 8 mg/1, D = 588 mg/1 is required dosage of 1.36% solution 
(D) You wish the capability to leave the chlorine system unattended for the weekend, size your day tank of 
prepared diluted solution to carry you for three days. 
Chlorine flow for 3 days = 588 rag/1 x 7601 x 4320 rain = 1.93 x 109 mg solution = 1.93 x 103 kg 
= 4250 lb 
4250 lb per 62.4 lb/ft 3 (assumed freshwater) -- 68.1 ft 3, multiplied by 7.48 gal/ft 3 = 509 gal 
You should allow some freeboard in the tank and an allowance for ullage (liquid that is not useable 
in the very bottom of the tank and in the pipes). The tank should be sized around 600 gal (80 ft3). 
at 1 to 5 mg/1 concentrations. While these chemicals are non-toxic under freshwater 
conditions, 1 mg/1 of sodium thiosulfate proved toxic to larval penaeid shrimp (Johnson 
and Cichra, 1985). Therefore, these chemicals must be used with care for dechlorination; 
furthermore, toxicity of chlorine-treated water should be tested by bioassays with the culture 
organisms. 
13.3 Ozone 
Ozone (03) is a strong oxidizing agent that has been widely used for disinfection of 
drinking water. There are also some data on inactivation of bacterial and viral pathogens 
by ozone in freshwater and seawater (Liltved et al., 1995). Ozone is unstable and must be 
generated on-site using ultraviolet irradiation (Lohr and Gratzek, 1986) or corona electrical 
discharge (Honn et al., 1976). Ozone can be formed from either air or pure oxygen. If air is 
used it must be very dry, as ozone production efficiency is very sensitive to minute amount 

188 
of water in the air. Moisture can result in (a) the formation of nitrous oxides that lead 
to corrosion and reduced output and (b) production of hot spots that reduce ozone output 
and result in cracking of the dielectric. Air treatment for ozone production commonly uses 
a heat-regenerated desiccant dryer with two independent units. When the desiccant in the 
operating unit is exhausted, the drier switches to the other unit and regenerates the desiccant 
in the unit by heating. Ozone production is sensitive to hydrocarbon fouling and oil-free 
compressors are needed. For important applications, monitoring of the ozone concentration 
in the process gas is highly recommended. For a given power input, the use of pure oxygen 
results in a greater ozone production rate. The use of pure oxygen will also reduce the 
potential for gas supersaturation and gas bubble disease. 
When ozone is added to water, chemical reactions may produce an immediate reduction in 
ozone concentration or 'ozone demand'. The ozone concentration remaining in the water after 
sometime, is called the 'ozone residual'. The oxidizing power of ozone is higher at elevated 
pH as found in seawater. Ozone oxidation of nitrite is much more rapid than the oxidation 
of ammonia (Colberg and Lingg, 1978; Lohr and Gratzek, 1986). In aquariums, the use of 
ozone decreased turbidity, color, COD (chemical oxygen demand), BOD (biochemical oxygen 
demand) and total protein (Lohr and Gratzek, 1986). The use of ozone for ammonia or nitrite 
oxidation is probably not economical except for research applications. 
Most of the work done with ozone disinfection has been done in freshwater (Colberg and 
Lingg, 1978; Brown and Russo, 1979; Oakes et al., 1979). Typically, ozone residuals in the 
range of 0.1 to 1.0 mg/1 and a contact time of 1-2 min are needed to produce a 99% reduction 
in bacterial concentrations (see Example 13.3). Spores appear to be much more resistant to 
ozone than bacteria. 
Ozone is highly toxic to fish and crustaceans, but it is also highly unstable and will decay 
to non-toxic concentrations in 10-20 min, even if no organics are present. Therefore, ozone 
cannot be stored for any appreciable period of time and must be used as it is generated. 
Depending on ozone demand, contact time before exposure to culture organisms can be a 
very much shorter time interval. In reuse loops with high ozone demand, due to high organic 
content in easily oxidized form, contact tanks with detention times of five minutes or less are 
common. In fact, some systems do not even have contact tanks per se but count on flow time 
in the recirculation loop to consume the ozone residuals. 
The addition of ozone to seawater may produce long-lived by-products such as hypo- 
bromous acid, bromates, trihalomethanes (THM), haloacetic acid (HAA), haloacetonitriles 
(HAN) and cyanogen bromides (Grosvenor, 1999). These compounds may make the use of 
ozone for the culture of fish, crustaceans and other sensitive organisms risky, because the 
toxicities of these compounds are not precisely known. Even very low concentrations of these 
ozone by-products may be fatal to some organisms. Ozone has been commonly used in marine 
mammal systems (Spotte, 1991: Coakley and Crawford, 1998: LaBonne, 1998). As discussed 
in the chlorine section, marine mammals are relatively very tolerant to oxidizing agents. In 
addition, chlorine or ozone addition in marine mammal systems can remove 'yellow sub- 
stances' that are unsightly to human viewers. Ozone is widely used in aquaculture, particularly 
as part of reuse loops (Brazil et al., 1998; Singh and Wheaton, 1999). Singh and Wheaton 
(1999) in particular also point out the many unknowns relative to possible toxic effects of 
ozone by-products. Ozone has also been used for the disinfection and oxidation of ammonia 
with sharks (Honn and Chavin, 1976), but the biological impacts on the sharks was not well

defined. Ozone can be used to inactivate red tide metabolites (Blogoslawski et al., 1973) 
and in the depuration of shellfish (Rosenthal, 1981). Ozone can also substantially improve 
subsequent suspended solids removal (Reuter and Johnson, 1995). Until further information 
on the toxicity of ozone by-products becomes available, it should be used with caution in the 
culturing of sensitive species or life stages, especially in seawater with high organic content. 
Ozone also has some materials compatibility and human safety issues. Some commonly 
used aquacultural and building materials will degrade rapidly if exposed to ozone. There have 
been some interesting maintenance and repair projects around ozone units and their exhausts. 
There is some information available on materials compatibility (Singh and Wheaton, 1999, 
table 1) but it is limited. Ozone is also dangerous to people at very low concentrations. Some 
jurisdictions require ozone to be used only in isolated rooms with gas-phase ozone monitors, 
an alarm capability and an ozone 'destruct' unit on the contactor exhaust.

allow removal and replacement without having to stop water flow. The water flows (a) from the large tanks into the 
back of the units, (b) horizontally through the units and (c) vertically out of the bottom at the other end of the units. 
These units can be equipped with an automatic quartz wiper system to clean the quartz tubes and UV intensity 
monitors with output alarms (Engineered Products, used with permission). 
13.4 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation 
Ultraviolet radiation is probably the most commonly used disinfection process with 
seawater. In many hatchery or research systems, UV systems are added for 'safety', without 
any specific need or end-result. These systems are modular and can be equipped with UV 
sensors to ensure effective operation. Newer models pass the water through the system in 
Teflon piping, which is transparent to UV radiation, with the UV bulbs placed outside of the 
piping (Fig. 13.2). This avoids the problems with leaks around the liquid-air seals and fouling 
on the exterior of the bulbs when in direct contact with process water. The units have no 
moving parts, but require replacement of bulbs on at least a yearly basis, as the UV output of 
the bulbs decreases with time. As a number of equipment and operating conditions can greatly 
reduce the effectiveness of UV systems, it is important to periodically check performance. 
The output of a UV system is measured in microwatts per second per square centimeter 
(IxW/s per cm2). Commercially available units are typically designed to provide 30,000 to 
35,000 txW/s per cm 2 at the rated flow. This 'dose' is based on normal design of UV systems 
for human drinking water and has nothing to due with the use of UV for aquatic culture. The 
UV 'dose' can be increased by reducing the water flow through the units. Standard units are 
available up to 600 gpm (37.8 lps).

The UV 'dose' needed to prevent a given disease will depend on the specific pathogen, 
initial microorganism concentration, turbidity, particulate concentration of the water, and UV 
dose. Based on empirical studies, the adequate 'dose' for a variety of pathogens ranged from 
35,000 to 156,000 txW/s per cm 2 (Hoffman, 1974; Fischer et al., 1976; Brown and Russo, 
1979; Liltved et al., 1995). In marine mammal systems, yeasts appear to be more resistant 
to UV radiation than bacteria (Spotte and Buck, 1981). Viral fish pathogen have been shown 
to require several orders of magnitude higher dosages for the same 5 log deactivation as 
pathogenic bacteria (Liltved et al., 1995). 
For production conditions, where UV systems are added for general protection against 
microorganisms, a 'dose' of 30,000 to 35,000 txW/s per cm 2 is commonly used. If the UV 
system is to be used against specific pathogens, it would be advisable to acquire more specific 
data. Unfortunately, specific data of this type are not readily available. 
UV radiation is ideal for the disinfection of process water because nothing is added to the 
water that may prove toxic to the culture organisms. UV radiation is commonly used in oyster 
and crustacean hatcheries (Fischer et al., 1976; Brown and Russo, 1979). One disadvantage 
of UV radiation is that the presence of turbidity, particulate matter, or color will significantly 
reduce its effectiveness. This occurs either due to shielding of the microorganisms by the 
solids or reduction of the 'dose' due to absorption or attenuation of radiation by the water. 
Typically, filtration to 10 txm may be needed prior to treatment by UV radiation. 
While the lack of a residual (i.e., no remaining chemical concentration after the water 
leaves the unit) allows immediate use, it also means that when the power fails, the culture 
system will receive untreated water within seconds. In recycle systems or systems with long 
residence or detention times, the lack of a residual may result in little effect on the overall 
microorganism concentration in the rearing unit (Spotte and Adams, 1981). For example, in a 
simple flow-through system with a short residence time (Fig. 13.3A), an effective UV system

may result in a significant reduction in microorganisms. On the other hand, in recycle systems 
(Fig. 13.3B), growth of microorganisms either in the water or on walls and pipes may be 
rapid enough to maintain an unacceptable concentration of microorganisms. In short, even if 
the UV works, under these conditions it may have little or no effect on the concentrations of 
microorganisms in the culture tanks. The concentration of microorganism can be decreased 
by increasing the flow rate through the UV processing loop or by increasing the flow-through 
flow rate. While use of a disinfection agent, such as chlorine, that form a persistent residual is 
one solution (Spotte and Adams, 1981), this solution is probably only acceptable for marine 
mammals due to their reduced sensitivity to disinfection agents.

Alarms, Monitoring and Automatic Control Systems 
14.1 Characteristics and options 
The ultimate alarm system is an attentive human. A person can often observe and correct 
many problems before an automatic sensor or alarm system could detect an abnormal 
condition. In many cases, abnormal operation of machinery or alterations in water flow can be 
detected by a change in sound level or tone. When entering an operating area or building with 
seawater processing equipment, an experienced person may know instantly that something is 
amiss but may not be able to immediately identify the specific problem. 
There are three situations where an automatic alarm system can be useful. One is when the 
system is complex enough or sufficiently spread out that failures are not immediately obvious 
to operating personnel. The second situation is when the system is not continuously manned, 
such as at night, weekends and holidays. The third is when the time from failure to serious 
consequences is only a few minutes, which is common in heavily loaded reuse systems. Even 
if continuously manned, an alarm system can be very worthwhile. If long intervals between 
failures and their detection are acceptable, then the consequences of not having an alarm 
system may not justify the additional complexity and expense. 
If an alarm system is installed, it is likely to have several operating modes. Fig. 14.1 shows 
a typical alarm system for a seawater facility. There is a choice of alarm modes and these can 
be easily changed at will. One or more can be picked at anytime. These may include audible 
or visual alarms when the facility is manned and an outside alarm on an automatic telephone 
dialer when unmanned. Other types of remote alarms are also possible, such as having bells 
ring some distance from the seawater system. The best arrangement is having the dialer call a 
manned switchboard or security people. The person can then go down a list until someone is 
reached. Automatically leaving a 'message' may have unacceptable consequences if does not 
get through in a timely manner. The alternative is to continuously change the dialer telephone 
number or pager to that of the person 'on call' at any given time. The dialer may have 
more than one prerecorded message. However, on receiving an alarm, there is usually little 
information content as to the nature of the problem. If there are two channels on the dialer, 
one may have them divided into fire/intruder on one channel and seawater system problems 
on the other. This would be a logical split, since the responses might be quite different. 
There are two basic ways to wire an alarm system: normally open or normally closed. For 
normally open, the circuits are open until an alarm condition closes the circuit. In the normally 
closed approach, the circuit is closed until an alarm condition breaks the circuit. Since it has 
several advantages, the normally closed system is more common. Several sensors can be wired 
in series, any one of them breaking the circuit will activate the alarm. An example would be 
a high and low water level alarm on a wet well, head tank, or sump, which could be wired

together rather than requiring two separate circuits. Another advantage is that the normally 
closed system has a great deal more self-monitoring capability. Its circuits are powered at all 
times and any system failures producing breaks in the alarm circuits or loss of power will be 
immediately detected. The alarm system itself, or parts of it, are unlikely to fail without clear 
notification. If a normally open system has a faulty circuit, is short-circuited or has lost power, 
it will not alarm and will appear to be functional. The only disadvantage to normally closed is 
the continual requirement for power, although this is usually a minuscule amount. 
The loss of electric power is one of the most likely and serious failures, so the alarm 
system must have an independent power source. Since the power requirements are small and 
high AC voltages around seawater are undesirable, alarm systems often use 12 volt DC. A 
trickle charger is often connected across the backup batteries. When the electrical power is 
on, the alarm system is powered by the trickle charger. It is important that the backup battery 
be either manually or automatically checked at frequent intervals. An alarm system with dead 
batteries will fail when the external power is interrupted. The battery for the alarm system 
must not be the same as that used for starting the backup power generator. If the alarm system 
(or vice versa) was to short-circuit, it would also drain the starter battery and both emergency 
systems would have failed. Depending on an unreliable alarm system could encourage a false 
sense of confidence that might be a lot riskier than having no alarm system at all. 
The control console must have a master switch, very visible main system 'on' light, 
switches for choices of alarm mode and status of individual alarm points. It is very important 
that individual alarm points have separate on-off switches and status lights. If operating 
personnel get repeated 3 AM calls for false alarms or unimportant failures from specific alarm 

195 
points and cannot take them off the system, the entire system may be turned off. During 
unmanned operations, unimportant alarm points on the system should be turned off. The small 
status lights on the panel should tell at a glance what points are currently on the system. 
14.2 Alarm points 
Table 14.1 lists some of the operating functions in seawater systems that are likely to be 
placed on an alarm system. The number of points required is dependent on the specifics of the 
seawater system and the operating conditions. However, a console with 24 points, especially if 
of the normally closed variety, should be more than adequate for the majority of applications, 
including rather complex seawater systems. For simple systems only a few may be needed. 
Not all the possibilities listed will be used in any given application, although several of any 
given type are probable. The more elaborate the alarm system the more expensive it will 
be. 
Water levels are very commonly monitored. Supply sumps (wet well) and head boxes can 
be monitored for both low level and high. The triggering values should be set generously so 
that normal operating transients do not activate an alarm. High means the overflow has backed 
up or some of the normal water demands have stopped, although the overflow pipe should 
be of adequate size to handle the total flow. A low level means loss of water supply. A low 
level alarm is also likely to be used to automatically shutdown any pumps drawing from the 
sump or head box to prevent pump damage. Drain sumps are only likely to be monitored for 
high elevations, indicating clogging problems. Any liquid storage tanks that are important to

the proper operation of the facility, might be alarmed for low level. This would give some 
warning of depletion and could also prevent damage to any pumps that might be connected to 
the tank. 
Whenever the temperature of culture water is altered, these temperatures are likely to be 
monitored. They may be monitored for excessive low or high, but the two extremes may 
not be equally important. As many temperature controllers are cyclic (i.e., either on or off), 
temperature limits should not be too tightly set. Alternatives are to build in a delay of a few 
seconds, so that a momentary temperature spike does not trigger an alarm, or install the sensor 
in a constant head tank or mixing tank where momentary changes in temperature will be 
dampened out. For heating, heat exchanger outputs are likely to be low-temperature alarmed, 
indicating loss of heat addition. This might also be used to shut off the flow of unheated water 
to prevent thermal shock to the culture organisms. Loss of heat source is the most probable 
source of failure and heating system control valves are usually configured to fail 'closed'. 
Failures resulting in excessively high temperatures are not as probable but have happened. In 
one case, a batch of fish were cooked because the temperature control sensor was mis-located 
and could not see the increasing water temperature. With cooling systems the reverse is true. 
Monitoring for excessively high temperatures, indicating loss of cooling, would be relatively 
more important than monitoring for too cold. 
Electric power is often monitored directly, even though it is somewhat redundant. Loss 
of power is likely to trigger many of the other alarm points, as electric pumps will turn off 
and the controls for most processing equipment, being electrical, will also shutdown. The 
advantage is that monitoring electric power directly gives an earlier indication of impending 
problems. If time is important, it will be worth doing. If a pump house is at some distance, it 
may be on a different transformer or distribution system from the rest of the facility. In this 
case, it is quite possible to lose electric power to one part of the facility but not the others. 
More importantly, main pumps are likely to require three-phase electric power. The electrical 
control system should have the capability to shutdown the pump when one phase is lost. The 
operation of a three-phase motor with only two phases will result in over-heating and rapid 
failure. Single-phase equipment connected to one leg of a three-phase supply may operate 
normally with the loss of one phase as long as the equipment is connected to one of the 
operating legs. If from different external power sources, the main pumps, mechanical area and 
the wet lab power supplies should be monitored separately. 
Pressures can also be monitored. The most important usually involves air pressures, such 
as that in the low pressure aeration system. Another important air pressure is that in the 
receivers for the compressed air that might power automatic valves, such as used with heat 
exchangers. Pressure sensors might also be used to monitor water levels, and the suction 
and discharge sides of pumps. Monitoring the suction side pressure (vacuum) of pumps is 
particularly important. 
Sometimes flows are monitored directly, although this might be redundant with other 
monitoring points such as elevations in head tanks. Flow measurement is more likely if the 
alarm function is tied into a monitoring and data logging system. There are many sensors 
available and some of them could be used with seawater, but these are likely to be expensive. 
The alarm could be triggered by high or low flow values. Simpler 'on-off' flow monitoring 
devices can be made with spring loaded plates with mercury switches, which are held down 
by the flow. A similar device has been published (Ross and Muir, 1987). 

197 
There is a whole host of monitoring points and parameters that might be important 
in a given applications. Seawater processing equipment, especially the more elaborate and 
expensive models, may have integral alarm circuitry that could be connected to the alarm 
system. These might include automatic filters, 'sterilizers' and heat exchanger systems. In 
some facilities the monitoring of dissolved oxygen is of considerable importance and this 
can be automated even for a large number of individual culture units (Kinghorn, 1982b). 
The ability to automatically monitor the various forms of nitrogen in seawater systems has 
been available for decades, but has been hampered by various practical problems such as 
excessive costs, complexity, and support requirements. However, more recent technology may 
be more practical for seawater system management (Moschou et al., 2000). There has been 
considerable interest and effort directed at counting and measuring large numbers of fish 
without having to handle them. There are a number of different sensor approaches to this 
difficult problem (Huguenin, 1993). If chlorine is added to drains, residual chlorine may be 
monitored and alarmed at the discharge. In research applications, individual experiments may 
be alarmed so that they can be left unattended for extended periods of time (see Example 
14.1). 
Because of valuable culture organisms or equipment contained with the system, physical 
security against fire, and threat of theft or vandalism may be of considerable importance. 
Intrusion, smoke, and high-temperature (fire) sensors are widely used in seawater culturing 
facilities. They are essentially identical to those used for the same purposes in a variety of 
residential and industrial applications and can be integrated into the overall alarm system. 
The system may also include video cameras coveting facility entry points, video recording of 
camera outputs, and coded access requirements (especially during non-working hours). 
14.3 Automatic control 
Complex seawater facilities and some commercial operations are moving toward the use 
of dedicated computer based monitoring, data logging and control systems. These systems 
can be adapted, especially if planned for from the start, to monitor, control and alarm many 
complex processes. High/low alarm trip levels can be built into the software and can be 
changed as experience is accumulated or operating conditions evolve. If many people have 
access to the basic computer (many people may need access to the logged environmental and 
systems data), the alarm levels and control functions on the system should require passwords 
to prevent intentional or unintentional interference by unauthorized personnel. The use of 
computers for monitoring, controlling and alarming will require a backup power supply to 
retain functionality during loss of external power. Since computers generally use AC power, 
much more complex and expensive trickle chargers, battery and inverter systems may be 
needed. However, uninterrupted power is also of some importance for the monitoring and data 
logging functions. Acquiring data during emergencies may be particularly important. 
Alarm values on specific points may also be used to automatically activate some preplanned 
actions in addition to the alarm notification. Examples are turning pumps on-off, opening- 
closing automatic valves or starting a backup generator. In most cases, these actions would 
be initiated in parallel but separate from the alarm system. It has been common in the past 
to have individual sensors tied into the electric circuits of pumps or used to activate other 
individual units. Trip values were often mechanically determined at the sensor. If a dedicated

Using the system defined by Fig. 5.2, consider the desirability of providing an alarm capability. Discuss 
possible options and alarm locations/parameters. Group the possible alarm points into two categories of 
'highly desirable' and 'useful'. Since many details about the system, its operating conditions and its 
operating procedures, are not given there is no 'correct' solution and answers may vary. 
An alarm system for a commercial hatchery as shown in Fig. 5.2 is highly desirable. Disasters can happen 
quickly and the economic consequences can be very high compared to the cost of alarm equipment and the 
benefits of early warning of serious problems. Such a system is inevitably spread out in different rooms or 
locations. Even when well manned, not all parts are under continuous supervision.

9 Alarm of excessively high pressure differential across the sand filter. This would be indicative of 
clogged filters, the end of the filter run and the need for servicing before more serious seawater 
supply problems developed. Many filter systems have alarm capability and can be directly 
connected to an alarm system. The DE filter could similarly be monitored, especially if operated 
continuously and unattended (it in fact proved to be a maintenance headache). 
9 Alarm of excessive vacuum on the suction side of pumps. This would be indicative of clogged 
intake screens during storms or the accumulation of long-term biofouling of pipes and/or 
screens. In either case, a warning of more serious seawater supply problems if not serviced. 
9 Some UV systems have a self-monitoring capability, which could be connected to an alarm 
system. 
computer is used, these control actions can be done centrally by the computer and we are now 
talking about integrated systems. 
Using computers to actually control aquaculture systems has increased considerably in 
recent years. This is part of the general computerization of aquaculture functions (see Ernst 
and Nath, 2000). The major impetuous has been from highly loaded large reuse systems, 
where operational problems, if not immediately corrected, can quickly lead to disasters in 
minutes. The large monetary value of the biomass can justify the high complexity and cost 
of automatic monitoring and control systems. As a consequence, there have been dedicated 
conferences (Balchen, 1987; Libey and Timmons, 1998a) and book chapters (Ebeling, 1994) 
on the topic of automatic control. Additional good reviews include Plaia (1987), Ebeling 
(1998a,b) and Lee (1995, 2000). 
Automatic control is not the 'silver bullet' solution to the management of seawater culture 
systems. While they promise to reduce the risks of catastrophic events and reduce manning 
requirements, they can get very complicated and expensive. Sensors, automatic valves and 

199 
software can be very costly upfront and systems maintenance and calibration can consume 
considerable resources and effort. If sets of circumstances develop that have not been foreseen, 
the system may very well take the wrong action and actually make the situation much worse. 
Aquaculture is not a well defined, constant, steady-state and predictable process, like many of 
the manufacturing and processing industries from which these techniques and equipment are 
derived. If the control system is not flexible and adaptable to changing needs and requirements, 
it may become unusable. The control system should be able to operate in several modes, 
including automatic, semi-automatic (meaning that individual functions can be activated or 
inactivated without having to take the total system out of operation) and completely manually. 
A fully manual capability is the ultimate backup.

Water Recycling 
15.1 Setting requirements and options 
As the animal biomass loading per unit flow rate increases, life support limits are reached 
(see Section 2.7). Often the first limit is dissolved oxygen, which may be increased by 
aeration. The next is usually due to the accumulation of metabolic wastes from animal 
biomass in the system. The metabolic wastes of marine animals include ammonia, suspended 
solids, dissolved solids, and organic compounds which may be readily converted to ammonia. 
In addition, the concentrations of bacteria and other potentially pathogenic microorganisms 
can increase substantially above ambient levels. Removing or decreasing the toxicity of these 
wastes can be rather complicated and hard to accomplish. If, and this is a big if, this is done 
properly, the water can be recycled back to the culture system. Water reconditioning can be 
built fight into the culture tank or contained in a separate processing loop. The advantages 
of recycling are in reducing demand on external water supply and on heating/cooling 
requirements. On the other hand, proper operations usually require considerable analytical 
capabilities, formidable technical knowledge/experience, and a little luck. The higher the 
biomass loading, the more critical these problems. Some water treatment may be required 
to meet discharge standards imposed by regulatory agencies, since large marine biomasses 
represent a substantial potential source of pollution. In many cases, only simple sedimentation 
for effluent may be required (see Section 10.8). The following section pertains mostly to 
animal systems, as reuse systems with significant photosynthetic activity can be a different 
situation (Brune and Wang, 1998). 
The generation of metabolic waste is largely determined by the total biomass, the feeding 
rate, feed characteristics, and the feed assimilation efficiency (feed conversion) of the animals. 
Inefficient or suboptimum feeding practices can greatly increase the generation of metabolic 
wastes and recycling system requirement. In holding systems with no feeding, the metabolic 
load will depend primarily on water temperature, total biomass, and the quantity of dead 
animals and other organic debris. To reduce the metabolic load, solid wastes (settleable solids) 
should be removed as soon as possible by filtration or sedimentation to prevent solubilization 
or leaching of the solids. The removal of settleable solids leaves fine suspended solids, 
ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and dissolved organics (see Section 2.7), which can have varying 
degrees of toxicity depending on species, life stage, and environmental conditions (Colt and 
Armstrong, 1979). Ammonia toxicity is usually the most important. The toxicity of ammonia 
is due to the un-ionized form (NH3) and depends on pH, temperature, and salinity. Criteria for 
un-ionized ammonia and procedures for its computation are presented in Sections 2.7 and 2.8. 
Systems can be operated at higher levels but only with higher stress on the culture organisms 
and with the associated increased risk of greater disease and mortality.

A number of physical, chemical and biological processes have been used in seawater 
reconditioning (Table 15.1). Reconditioning or reuse in this section means the oxidation or 
removal of animal metabolic wastes. Many of these processes have several different functions 
that can be accomplished with various degrees of efficiency. As an example, ozone can both 
directly oxidize organics and can also act as a disinfectant. Many can both act as a biofilter 
and also filter out suspended solids. By far the most common reuse process is nitrification, 
with a number of options within this category, and others that are listed in approximate order 
of occurrence in seawater culture systems. Since use of at least one, and sometimes several, of 
these processes is essential for water reconditioning, substantial scientific literature on these 
processes in water reuse systems is available (see Appendix C). This literature provides an 
indication of the time, effort and resources that can be required to build, monitor and control 
water reconditioning processes. Much remains to be discovered about some of the processes. 
This is especially true for systems that are heavily loaded, have high water reuse and/or are 
operated for long periods of time. 
Considerable technical progress has been made on reuse technology since the first edition 
of this book. There have been dedicated conferences (Libey and Timmons, 1996, 1998b), 
specialized books (Timmons and Losordo, 1994) and special journal issues (Piedrahita and 
Verreth, 2000) as well as chapters in engineering books (Lawson, 1995). Reuse systems 
have established themselves for certain uses, particularly for small-scale applications where 
biosecurity is very important or for high value organisms. Their practicality for many other 
applications is still very much in doubt. 
15.2 Nitrification and biofilters 
Nitrification, or biological oxidation of ammonia, is a two-step process carried out by aero- 
bic bacteria. Recent research on the phylogenetics of ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria 
has demonstrated that the dominant nitrifiers in aquaculture systems are not Nitrosomonas 
and Nitrobacter or close relatives as commonly believed. Rather, the nitrifying assemblage is 
composed of members of the Nitrosospira and Nitrospira groups of bacteria (Hovanec and 
DeLong, 1996). 
Ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite by Nitrosospira and then oxidized again to nitrate 
by Nitrospira. These bacteria generally use carbon dioxide or bicarbonate as their carbon

source. The complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate requires 4.57 mg of oxygen per mg 
of total ammonia nitrogen. As a result of the high oxygen demand, oxygen is often limiting 
(Manthe et al., 1988). The oxidation of ammonia and nitrite supplies energy to the two groups 
of bacteria that can be used for metabolism and growth. Under high ammonia loadings and 
resulting high growth rates, it may be necessary to remove some portion of the biomass of 
these bacteria. 
The nitrifying bacteria are relatively slow growing and a change in ammonia loading, 
salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen can result in fluctuations in ammonia and nitrite 
concentrations. Especially critical is the start-up of a new filter (Fig. 15.1). Typically 1 to 3 
months may be needed to achieve steady-state operations on a brand new system. The start-up 
process is characterized by the accumulation of ammonia until the Nitrosospira population has 
sufficiently increased. As the Nitrosospira start to oxidize ammonia, nitrite will accumulate 
until the Nitrospira population has time to increase to oxidize the nitrite to nitrate. The culture 
animals can be heavily stressed or even killed by the ammonia or nitrite peak concentrations 
during this adjustment process. There are available data (Rijn and Rivera, 1990) on nitrite 
concentrations within several different processes. Changes in biomass and feeding practices 
have to be approached with caution when using nitrification to avoid dangerous transients. 
Good reviews of nitrification principles include Wheaton et al. (1994a) and Watten et al. 
(1998). 
Nitrate is much less toxic, with concentrations below 200 mg/1 often being acceptable. 
However, prolonged exposure to high nitrate concentrations can lead to serious problems 
(Hrubec et al., 1996). Unless there is some flow-through of seawater, the nitrate concentration 
will continuously increase and the pH will tend to drop even in seawater. A flow-through of 
5-10% will usually keep the nitrate concentration at acceptable levels. Bacterial denitrification 
can be used to convert nitrate to nitrogen gas, but it is an anaerobic process which will create 
considerable complexity, cost, equipment and operating problems, pH control has proven to 

204 
be a problem in some seawater recycling systems, even with some flow-through. Calcareous 
materials in the system, such as oyster shells and corals, may start to dissolve. In fact, these 
materials are sometimes intentionally added to adjust pH and alkalinity but tend to become 
coated with inorganic and organic materials and cannot be relied upon over the long run for 
this purpose. Addition of calcium bicarbonate, Ca(HCO3)2 or sodium carbonate (NazCO3), 
are usually better methods of adjusting pH. The long-term buildup of non-biodegradable 
organics (commonly resulting in a yellow color) may be of concern in the rearing of some 
sensitive organisms in recycling systems. There are also risks of depleting necessary trace 
materials if sufficient new water is not provided. 
Typically, the process of nitrification occurs in a separate container called a biofilter. The 
bacteria are grown on a physical medium and the biofilter may be submerged (filled with 
seawater), or exposed to air while water is allowed to trickle over the medium. In culturing 
applications, the submerged biofilter is the more common. In submerged biofilters, the water 
flow may be either upward (up-flow) or downward (down-flow). The down-flow mode has the 
advantage of being able to visibly observe the more heavily loaded top part of the filter. There 
are several other variations on biofilters, including rotating biological contactors (RBC), bead 
filters and a different function for coarse sand filters (see later in this section). Good reviews 
of biofilter design options are Turnbull and Timmons (1993) and Wheaton et al. (1994a). 
In cross-section, some biofilters are similar to slow sand filters (see Fig. 10.1). Instead of 
sand, they may use either a well graded calcareous gravel (oyster shell, dolomite, calcite or 
coral) of 2-5 mm in a bed with a minimum thickness of 3 in. (7.6 cm) (Spotte, 1979), or 
plastic media of various shapes and sizes such as used in column aerators (see Fig. 12.1A) 
and wastewater trickling filters, with filter depths in the range of about 2-4 ft (0.60-1.3 m). 
The calcareous substrates are low cost, buffer the seawater, and add trace materials needed by 
the bacteria; however, they have higher frictional head losses and are more prone to clogging 
with solids and short-circuiting than plastic media. Hydraulic loading rates will be in the 
order of 1 gpm/ft 2 (0.68 lps/m 2) for the calcareous gravel and 1.5-2.5 gpm/ft 2 (1.02-1.70 
lps/m 2) for the plastic media. These values often produce a filter with a footprint (floor) area 
about equal to that of the total bottom area of the culture tanks. Biofilter performance can be 
monitored by measuring the dissolved oxygen consumption across the filter (Manthe et al., 
1988). The choice of trickling filter medium can significantly affect the nitrification process 
(Lekang and Kleppe, 2000) as can directly manipulating the microorganisms (Horowitz and 
Horowitz, 1998). 
Rotating biological contactors (RBC) are drum- or cylinder-shaped with large internal 
surfaces for attachment of biofilms. An RBC is deployed with the cylinder axis horizontally, 
with about 40% of its diameter submerged and is slowly rotated about its axis. Water is 
trapped and rotated to the top and then splashed down through all the internal surfaces of the 
RBC. This flow also provides a self-cleaning aspect. RBCs used in aquaculture are greatly 
downsized variations of a common municipal wastewater secondary treatment process. The 
use of RBCs in aquaculture is covered in Wheaton et al. (1994b) and Hocheimer and Wheaton 
(1998). 
Bead filters and sand filters are classified as granular filters and can both provide substrate 
area for nitrification and can also remove suspended particulate matter. Both, with operating 
time and depending on conditions, will clog with solids and must be back-flushed similar to 
many other solids separation filters (see Chapter 10). Both functions cannot be optimized at

the same time, forcing a decision on the systems designer as to priority. Bead filters are most 
often optimized as biofilters and used in reuse loops, while sand filters are commonly used 
primarily for suspended solids removal. 
Bead filters use roughly spherical pellets (3-5 mm diameter) of unexpanded polyethylene, 
polystyrene or polypropylene, which are slightly positive buoyant. Specific substrate area is 
in the region of 1150 mZ/m 3 (350 ftz/ft 3) (Malone et al., 1998). Water flows upward in a 
column, which commonly has an hourglass shape. The backwashing can be with air, water 
circulation or mechanically (paddles or propellers). The mechanical backwashing tends to be 
more aggressive and may be disruptive to the biofilms on the beads. Bead filters tend to be 
comparable to other biofilter options on floor space requirements and superior on a volume 
basis. However, comparative tests of bead filters against plastic media trickling filters indicates 
better performance from the trickling filter (Singh et al., 1999). Other similar comparative 
tests showed much higher specific nitrification for trickling filters, although the volumetric 
nitrification rate was better for the bead filters (Greiner and Timmons, 1998). Excellent 
reviews of bead filters and their design are Malone et al. (1998) and Malone and Beecher 
(2OOO). 
A review of sand filters, when used as biofilters in aquaculture, is in Timmons and 
Summerfelt (1998). Variations in sand biofilter performance as a function of sand size and 
location within the biofilter are given in Nam et al. (2000). 
The performance of biofilters can be influenced by many factors (see Table 15.2). Some 
are related to the water properties and some to the design of the biofilter. The influent 
to the biofilter should be pretreated by filtering or sedimentation to remove the settleable 
solids, which can very quickly negatively influence the performance of the biofilter. The finer 
suspended material and the increasing microorganisms biomass will in time start to clog the 
biofilter, which then must be back-flushing with water or air or both. While this may restore 
the hydraulic flow through the biofilter, if too vigorous, the bacterial populations may be 
seriously disrupted resulting in reduced biofilter performance. An alternative cleaning method 
for down-flow submerged biofilters is to siphon off the surface debris and then to gently stir 
the top layer and again siphon. Biofilters should be shaded from direct sunlight to prevent the 
growth of algae on the top of the filter. The nitrifying bacteria in the biofilters are also very 

206 
sensitive to many chemicals, possibly much more sensitive than the culture organism. These 
could be drugs used on the animals for control of diseases or parasites, airborne chemicals or 
leachates from construction materials (see Section 8.1). 
In water reuse loops using biofilters, there is considerable interdependence between systems 
parameters. See Example 15.1 for relating parameters of water quality, operating conditions, 
and system loading. This example is based on principles of this section and equations and data 
from Chapter 2. 
15.3 Foam fractionation 
Foam fractionation, also called protein skimming, air stripping and froth flotation, removes 
surface active (surfactants) dissolved organics and suspended solids, which may be produced 
in the culture system. If aeration is vigorous, the process can also drive ammonia and volatile 
components directly to the atmosphere. Additional benefits include the removal of fine 
particulates and excellent aeration. The process can be very efficient but in some applications 
has been disappointing. It can be very sensitive to small design details and choices in values 
of operating variables. The process is believed to be most effective in marine applications, 
especially in lightly loaded systems. Most seawater applications have been aquarium reuse 
systems. If it is to be combined with ozonation, some users have strongly recommended, 
for system control reasons, to separate the two processes by not using ozone in the foam 
fractionator's gas supply but applying it separately. The equipment, unlike biofilters, does not 
require much space and maintenance is usually minimal. It is sometimes used in combination 
with biofilters instead of as a substitute. 
Foam fractionation involves agitating aerated seawater to produce a foam rich in dissolved 
organics and suspended solids. The resulting foam must be collected and discharged to the 
drain. The performance of this process depends on the organic load and composition, surface 
tension, temperature, viscosity, pH, salinity, bubble size, air-water ratio, and contact time. 
Not all these parameters are independent. The ideal bubble size is about a diameter of 0.8 
mm (0.03 in.) (Spotte, 1979). High air-water ratios and long bubble contact times increase 
removal efficiency (Wheaton et al., 1979). 
There are a number of configurations for foam fractionators. Some look like airlift pumps 
and others have a counter-flow arrangement between air and water to increase the contact 
time (Spotte, 1979; Wheaton et al., 1979). The process water may enter and leave submerged 
from the bottom or the process water may enter above the surface and counter-flows through 
the rising foam. In fact, any vigorous diffuser type aerator with an airlift pipe can be used in 
this manner, if the resulting foam is removed. Probably the most common configuration is the 
injection of air with a venturi and discharge of the resulting high velocity air-water mixture 
tangentially near the bottom of a column. This imposes a vigorous circulation, which delays 
the rise of the small bubbles, increasing contact time. Dimensional design information on the 
column and venturi (Hagen, 1970) and equations for guidance in optimization are available 
(Lawson and Wheaton, 1980; Weeks and Timmons, 1992; Timmons et al., 1995). A good 
review of its use in aquaculture is presented in Timmons (1994). There are indications that 
small dimensional changes and differences in operating parameters can have large impacts 
on performance. There is also evidence that prolonged use can lead to depletion of trace 
materials, especially some metals. 

207 
15.4 Activated carbon and ion exchange 
Activated carbon (charcoal) in powdered or granular form can adsorb dissolved organics 
directly from seawater. These include not only organic wastes but therapeutic drugs (Marking 
and Piper, 1976) and chlorine residuals (Sharp, 1951; Seegert and Brooks, 1978; Giles and 
Danell, 1983). The exact mechanisms and conditions involved and their relative importance is 
not clear. This is thought to include mechanical filtration, chemical adsorption and bacterial 
action (Spotte, 1979). Carbon works well at very low organic concentrations and is often used 
in addition to a biofilter as a polishing stage to remove persistent non-biodegradable organics. 
There is evidence that carbon can also remove needed trace materials, especially copper. 
The adsorption capability of active carbon is highly variable, since it can be manufactured 
with a number of methods and materials. Furthermore, its removal capacity depends strongly 
on the specific organics to be removed. The larger molecules and those with branches or 
longer chains are believed to be removed at a slower rate (Spotte, 1979). Predicting the 
adsorptive capacity of activated carbon under any given set of conditions cannot be done 
without experimentation (Spotte, 1979). 
The performance of an activated carbon unit is influenced by a number of factors. These 
include the adsorption rate of the carbon for the organics in question, contact time, the 
concentration of the organics, biological films on the carbon, carbon particle size, pore surface 
area, and selectivity. Fluid properties can also be important, such as temperature and pH. 
Suspended solids can greatly reduce the performance of the carbon and the flow capacity of 
the unit and should be removed (see Chapter 10) before treatment. 
Powdered carbon, because of its greater surface area, results in faster adsorption, but costs 
more, has increases head losses and is more difficult to handle relative to the granular form. 
Therefore, the granular form is more common. For small systems, plastic pipe with threaded 
caps and a screen to retain the granules may be used. For larger systems, rapid sand filter or 
related swimming pool equipment is often used. At some point the carbon must be regenerated 
or replaced due to saturation of its adsorption capacity. This point may not be obvious, since 
the unit may continue to perform reasonably well as a biofilter. Since monitoring specific 
organic compounds can be difficult, a more practical policy is often to replace the carbon on 
a regular basis. Removal of the carbon for regeneration or replacement will be much more 
frequent than if the same equipment was being used for different purposes with gravel or 
sand. As a consequences, access and handling difficulties associated with the equipment can 
be substantially more important when using carbon. 
Saturated carbon can be regenerated with high temperature and steam but its adsorptive 
capacity does not return to the original clean value. After a few cycles, the carbon will have to 
be replaced. For small quantities, regeneration is not worth the effort or risk and used carbon 
is usually discarded. More complicated chemical regeneration methods have been tried but do 
not appear to have any advantages for the culturist. 
Zeolites, such as clinoptilolite, are naturally occurring minerals that selectively adsorb 
ammonia from solution (Dryden and Weatherly, 1989). Clinoptilolite is found in large 
quantities in the U.S., although its purity, strength and adsorption capacity differs considerably 
from deposit to deposit. It has been tested in a number of freshwater culture systems (Liao 
and Lin, 1981), but has yet to be used in any large-scale culturing application. The material is 
available in different grain sizes and can be used as one would use gravel or activated carbon. 

208 
Example 15.1. Water recycling 
Due to the fact that a developer got a deal on the property (from an old Army buddy), seawater must be 
trucked from the ocean and therefore is limited. The following recycle system was selected: 
Biofilter 
d 
V 
a 
Qr 
c 
A 
,w 
b 
y 
The system must be able to hold 5000 lb of fish at a feeding rate of 2%/day. The environmental conditions 
and waste production rates are: 
Temperature = 15~ 
Salinity = 35 g/kg 
pH = 8.3 
Ammonia concentration in influent water = 0.0 mg/1 
Un-ionized ammonia criteria - 10 Ixg/1 
Ammonia production rate = 0.02 lb TAN/lb feed 
Efficiency of the filter -- 78% 
(A) Compute the maximum total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentration in the discharge from the rearing 
unit (point b). 
oe = 0.0288 (Table 2.6) 
From Eq. 2.9, NH3-N -- 1000c~ TAN -- 10 
TAN -- 10/(1000)(0.0288) -- 0.347 mg/1 
(B) Compute the ammonia production rate. 
Feeding rate = (5000 lb)(0.02) = 100 lb feed/day 
Ammonia production rate = (100 lb feed/day)(0.02 lb/lb feed)= 2.00 lb/day 
(2 lb)(453.6 g/lb)(1000 rag/g) = 907,000 mg/day 
(C) Assuming a 99% recycle flow (99% recycle water, 1% makeup water), compute the required makeup 
water flow (Q~) needed. Assume no change in ammonia concentration in the pipes. 
From conservation of mass considerations, the following relationships can be written in terms of M, 
the mass flux of TAN in mg/day: note that the mass flux is equal to the product of the flow x 
concentration. 
Between points a and b, 
Ma + 907,000 = Mb 
At point c, the mass flux is only 0.99Mb, because 0.01Mb is lost in the discharge from the system. 
Mc = 0.99Mb 
At point d, the mass flux is reduced to only 0.12Mc due to the biofilter. 

209 
Example 15.1. (continued) 
Md -- (1.00 -- 0.78)(0.99Mb) 
At point a, the mass flux can be written in terms of the flows and concentrations 
)Via = Q~ C~ n t- OrCd 
Since, it has been assumed that C~ -- 0.0, then 
Ma = Ma 
Ma = (0.12)(0.99Mb) 
Substituting this equation into the first equation results in: 
Mb = 1,029, 000 mg/day 
and 
Ma -- 122, 000 mg/day 
Since the concentration at point b is equal to Mb/Qtotal, 
0.347 mg/1 = 1,029,000 mg/day per Ototal; Ototal = 2,965,418 lpd (542 gpm) 
Make up flow = 0.01Qtotal -- 5.42 gpm 
(D) Compute the flow required for a recycle system with a 100% efficient filter. This system is equivalent to 
a flow-through system with zero ammonia in the influent. 
Mb -- 907,000 mg/1; 0.347 mg/1 = 907,000 mg/day per Q 
Q = 2,613,833 lpd = 478 gpm 
While the use of the recycle system reduced the make-up water flow from 478 gpm to 5.42 gpm, the 
total water flow (Qtotal) increased from 478 gpm to 542 gpm. 
(E) Compute the total flow needed (Qtotal) if the filter efficiency drops to 43%. 
Ma + 907,000 = Mb 
Ma = (0.57)(0.99Mb) = 0.564Mb 
Mb = 2,082,000 mg/day 
0.347 mg/1 = 2,082,000 mg/day per Qtotal 
Qtotal -- 6,000,000 lpd = 1096 gpm 
Decreasing the efficiency of the biofilter from 78% to 43% increased the total water flow from 542 gpm to 
1096 gpm. 
(F) A series of deep seawater wells are drilled and develop a supply of seawater at pH = 7.0, 
salinity = 35 g/kg, and temperature = 15~ 
Compute the flow needed for a flow-through system (filter 
efficiency = 100%). 
c~ = 0.0015 (Table 2.6) 
From Eq. 2.9, TAN = 10/(1000)(0.0015) = 6.67 mg/1 
6.67 mg/1 = 907,000 mg/day per Qtotal 
Qtotal "- 25.0 gpm 
Once saturated, the material is regenerated with a back-flush solution having a high sodium 
or hydrogen ion concentration. It is, therefore, not too surprising that clinoptilolite is not 
very effective in seawater. However, there has been promising research done with a selective 

210 
ammonia passing membrane exchanger, with freshwater around the ion exchange material. 
This technique has been used in the short-term transport of marine tropicals but has not yet 
been proven practical in seawater culturing applications and must be considered experimental. 
15.5 Algae 
Another interesting process for nutrient removal involves polyculture with marine algae. 
This includes both phytoplankton and macrophytes or seaweeds. Although there exist con- 
siderable data about the nutrient uptake properties of mass phytoplankton cultures, their 
microscopic characteristics make them difficult, in most cases clearly impractical, to separate 
from process water. Seaweeds are much easier to handle and very effective in removing 
nutrients from seawater. Since many seaweeds have high value for industrial, pharmaceutical 
and food additives, there are considerable data available on seaweed physiology but a great 
deal less on seaweed culture systems. Maintaining and operating algae cultures can require 
considerable time and effort. Unless the seaweeds are of direct interest, such as for educational 
or research purposes, they are not likely to be worth the trouble. Seaweeds need light, although 
too much can be inhibiting, a carbon source, substrate for attachment (sometimes), nutrients, 
trace materials and some water current. Algae cultures by themselves tend to drive the pH 
of the system to basic, while the animal wastes are acidic. With care a good pH balance 
is possible. One problem is that biological activity in recycling systems and some of the 
processing equipment tend to deplete essential trace materials that might be needed by the 
seaweeds. It is quite possible that there are a number of trace materials whose importance is 
not yet recognized. The addition of a seawater makeup flow will substantially reduce these 
risks. Sizing of the seaweed unit will depend on the animal biomass and their waste products. 
However, seaweeds are tolerant to wide variations in nutrient concentrations. Sizing data, 
design considerations and a bibliography can be found in Huguenin (1976b). While seaweeds 
can be effective in water treatment and can also be cultured for their extracts, optimizing 
for the two objectives produces different systems and modes of operation. Under many 
conditions, the seaweed unit may require an area comparable to that for the animal culture and 
may result in large heat gains or losses to the system. These can be major disadvantages. 

211 
Chapter 16 
Wet Laboratory Areas 
16.1 General considerations and trade-offs 
From an evaluation of present and future needs, one presumably can quantify seawater 
quantity and quality to be used in wet-lab areas. This also includes decisions on central 
seawater processing requirements and those that will be handled individually at the points of 
use. Water processing at the point of application has the advantage of minimizing the amount 
of water that needs to be treated and avoids the overspecification of required performance. 
From a management perspective, it also tends to shift the acquisition and operating expenses 
to the specific users' education or research funding rather than coming out of the facility's 
capital or operating accounts. In exchange, the user gets considerable more control and 
operational flexibility than from the central processing option. 
This still leaves many decisions involving wet-lab area sizing, configuration and distribu- 
tion of services. The answers to these questions may dramatically change with time as the 
nature of the work or conditions change. This will be true for all applications to varying 
degrees. Research uses are likely to see the fastest and most dramatic changes and commercial 
operations possibly the slowest. In any case, flexibility in operations of wet-lab areas is highly 
desirable. 
Configurational uncertainties with time, make it difficult to size wet-lab areas, even if one 
knows the total flow rates. If primarily deep tanks with high turnover rates are used, relatively 
little floor area is needed, while with shallow tanks requiting little flow the converse will be 
true. The range of values based on maximum flow rate is from 30 to over 200 square feet per 
gpm of flow (44-295 m 2/lps). The smaller area is for deep high turnover tanks and the higher 
number for shallow low turnover configurations. The sizing, once decided, may be difficult to 
alter in the future. Oversizing to cover the range of uncertainty may not be a problem, such 
as would be typical for outdoor wet-lab areas. However, indoor wet-lab areas are relatively 
expensive. Both types of wet-lab areas have their merits, and if future requirements are either 
highly variable or very uncertain, a mix might be attractive. 
No matter what the purpose is of the seawater system, some types of tanks or trays will 
be required in the wet-lab areas. The specifics of these units will be very dependent on the 
purposes. Appendix K includes samples of the published literature on the best tank designs for 
various uses. In addition, a wide variety of other tank types, made with synthetic materials and 
in a variety of shapes and sizes, are commonly used. These tanks are often used industrially 
for holding various types of contaminated water or chemicals (see Appendix M for a list 
of suppliers). For some applications, children's wading pools from catalog stores, either the 
solid type or the frames with plastic liners, are a cheap and effective solution. Again, all tank 
materials must be carefully evaluated for biological acceptability on an individual basis (see 

212 
Section 8.1). Those that are acceptable should be leached in running seawater for at least two 
weeks before use. 
Large tanks in wet labs can mask serious potential problems with influent gas supersatura- 
tion (see Section 12.4). If the tank is large, the residence time long (i.e., low flow-through rate) 
and the circulation and aeration in the tank are good, the incoming seawater may be highly 
supersaturated without producing any ill effects. This is due to rapid dilution, large air-water 
surface area and aeration. However, if the operating conditions are changed, serious problems 
could suddenly develop. 
Wet-lab areas are the locations where there is likely to be a requirement to distribute dry 
solids materials at frequent intervals. These materials might be chemicals or fertilizers but 
most likely are feeds of various kinds. While doing this by hand does give excellent control 
and, for feeds, provides feedback information on utilization, it can require considerable 
labor. Automatic feeders can reliably dispense dry materials. Liquid materials can be handled 
similar to other liquids. Moist feeds, which are neither wet nor dry, are very hard to dispense 
automatically. Appendix L provides a bibliography of published data on feeders. As can be 
seen, most are for scales of operation just about perfect for wet-lab use. Much larger feeders 
exist, but are not well reflected in the available literature. 
16.2 Indoor areas 
Indoor wet-lab areas have some strong advantages. They are protected from the weather 
and are in an environment that is relatively stable and controlled. Workers find it much easier 
to monitor and service the equipment. Expensive and possibly sensitive auxiliary equipment, 
such as metering pumps, laboratory equipment and sensors, may be better protected from the 
elements than they might be outdoors. Some parameters, such as light cycles, may be easier 
to control inside. Other conditions, such as noise and vibrations, from nearby mechanical 
equipment and the activities of people, and humidity may be worse inside. 
Since the configurational requirements of wet-lab areas are expected to change with time, 
the total available floor area should be as unrestricted as possible. This means no internal 
structural walls (temporary walls and partitions are common) and no vertical support columns, 
if they can be avoided. In high grade research facilities, it may be necessary to provide a mix 
of different sized wet-lab areas (see Lasker and Vlymen, 1969). Class educational activities 
and general holding of animals can be conducted in the larger spaces, while specialized 
research can be conducted in individual lab areas. If test parameters (such as temperature, 
photoperiod, light level, acoustics or use of toxic chemicals) must be rigidly controlled, then 
self-contained environmental chambers may be required. Segregating the various research 
projects also reduces friction between different researchers carrying out delicate research, 
who otherwise would all be interacting in a large room. These unwanted interactions include 
inadvertent altering of water or air supplies, 'borrowing' of equipment or disruption of 
experimental protocols. The social intricacies of shared wet-labs, especially in an academic 
research environment, are beyond the scope of this book. 
Wet-lab areas are often rectangularly shaped rather than the preferred square, because of 
structural limitations and costs of large spans. The area should also be well lit and ventilated. 
This will avoid the 'moist cave' atmosphere of some wet labs and will reduce humidity, 
corrosion and electrical problems, as well as improving working conditions. If the floor 

213 
is concrete a good sealer should be applied. This will reduce concrete dust, reduce water 
retention and humidity, and facilitate the flow of water across the floor. 
Those services common to all uses will generally be processed centrally and uniformly 
distributed over the wet-lab area. These may include raw, filtered or temperature-controlled 
seawater, low pressure air, freshwater, electricity and auxiliary inputs. These auxiliary inputs 
could include centrally distributed feeds, nutrients, or test pollutants. Yet another possibility is 
transportation from some other part of the seawater system, such as phytoplankton or larvae. In 
short, there could be a number of distribution systems for the various inputs. In order to keep the 
wet-lab area unrestricted, the placement of these systems is itself restricted. The usual answer 
is overhead placement with the valves about 7 ft (2.2 m) above the floor and the actual lines 
somewhat higher. Temperature-controlled water supplies will generally require continuous cir- 
culation of the water through the system (i.e., a loop) to prevent temperature change before use. 
An alternative to overhead distribution are main distribution points either in the middle or 
at one or more corners of the wet lab. In this case, temporary distribution lines can be laid 
where ever needed. This solution is only practical for small areas, if few inputs are required or 
if there is ample space for the equipment required. It tends to get messy and cluttered but does 
not require a permanent distribution system within the wet lab area. There can be a tripping 
hazard and electric lines on the floor of a wet lab are a definite risk to be avoided. Whether 
the distribution system is permanent or temporary, the maximum practical span or radius of 
supply to individual tanks is about 10 ft (3 m) from a distribution point. 
Provision for drainage must also be provided throughout the wet-lab area. The supply 
radius of 10 ft (3 m) previously mentioned is already on the long side for the distance from 
individual tanks to the drain. Drains must be sized for the maximum transient flows that can 
occur, such as when a tank is drained. Another requirement is adequate pitch of the floor to 
accommodate the flow. The standard pitch or slope for floors, drain channels and pipes to 
assure drainage of clear water is a vertical drop of 1 to 96 of horizontal length (1/8 inches 
per foot) and should be higher for water that may contain solid residues. A slope of 5 to 96 
(5/8 inches per foot) is needed to remove wet solids such as fecal matter, uneaten feed or 
sludge. Most wet-lab applications should be somewhere in between. Inadequate slope (floor 
or drain) or inadequate drain size will result in flooding or excessive labor to drain tanks. 
The resulting flooding could be a hazard as well as a mess to clean up. Drains can never be 
too large. They have to be protected from being clogged by various objects that could fall 
or be carried into them. The best way to do this is to use coarse screening, typically with a 
maximum hole dimension of one half of the drain pipe diameter. Open channels for drains are 
even better than large pipes, because they are easier to monitor and clean. What is sometimes 
done is to provide a large central drain channel with pipe drain laterals to more isolated areas 
of the wet lab. Even the largest drain and/or its screen can clog with time, if not maintained. If 
they clog, the drains will backup with subsequent flooding. The drain residues associated with 
many wet-lab operations can be impressive in quantity and smell. If drainage provisions have 
not been built into the floors, the bottoms of all tanks will have to be elevated to provide the 
elevation required to gravity flow the drainage from the bottoms of the tanks. The alternative 
is pumping them out when they have to be drained, an actuality that will require considerable 
manpower and should be avoided if possible. 
The required distribution of water within the wet lab may be highly uneven and vary 
with time. If one wants the flexibility to use the total supply at any given point, this will 

214 
have consequences in the selection of pipe and valve sizes and in operations. If one designs 
for uniform distribution and conditions unexpectedly change, requiring the concentration of 
services, serious problems may occur. For flow control reasons (see Chapter 9) one would 
like pipes as large as possible in the wet-lab distribution systems. These supply lines will 
often be connected at the ends in a loop to further reduce frictional head losses under varying 
flow distribution conditions. This automatically provides considerable flexibility in how to 
distribute the flow. The low flow velocities required for flow control, unfortunately, also make 
these lines susceptible to accumulating sediments and biofouling, requiring servicing. If the 
lines are small and the flow distribution changes (anyone opening or closing valves in the 
system), then flow control capability will be reduced. 'Small' and 'large' diameters can be 
determined by calculating frictional head losses from the head tank by using the procedures 
of Sections 6.4 and 6.5 (see Example 9.1). If the head losses are an appreciable fraction of the 
static head from the water level in the head box to the point of application, flow control will be 
very sensitive to all wet-lab flow changes. If large diameter distribution valves are used, they 
will add both flow flexibility and cost. While they are less prone to clogging and require less 
servicing, users are very likely to use more water than they really need. A compromise, if one 
cannot completely control the distribution, is to have a threaded reducer and relatively small 
threaded valves. These valves can then be exchanged for larger ones if needed. In research 
facilities with limited water supplies, it may be necessary to lock or secure individual supply 
valves in the system to prevent adverse flow changes to other experiments. Removing valve 
handles will eliminate casual alterations but will not deter a determined effort, often resulting 
in damage to the valve stems due to use of vise grips. 
If services to the general wet lab are required beyond what is already provided, such 
as specialized water treatment equipment, it can be added at the point of use. In research 
facilities, due to the variability and unpredictability of future requirements, it is generally more 
practical and economic to provide only minimal treatment to the water supply at the central 
point and require users to provide the additional processing to meet their own specialized 
requirements. Much of the needed processing information is included in Chapters 9 through 
15. As an example, Fig. 16.1 shows a small but rather elaborate wet-lab system built to do

some very high precision research. The only services supplied centrally were raw seawater and 
hot water from the building's heating system. It was necessary to filter, temperature-control, 
and flow-control the seawater and to provide an auxiliary continuous supply of phytoplankton 
(not shown). Flow control was provided with a constant head tank and micropipettes (in place 
of expensive metering pumps, see Section 9.3). The same type of overflow constant head tank 
system was provided to control the flow of phytoplankton. 
16.3 Outdoor areas 
Outdoor wet lab areas also have some distinct advantages. Much larger areas are usually 
available, facilitating access for improved working conditions and possibilities for large or 
more numerous tanks. Contrary to what some may believe, outdoor culturing conditions for 
marine organisms can be as good as indoors. Tanks can be covered and auxiliary equipment 
protected. The heat capacity of water, with any reasonable flow-through, and the insulative 
properties of many types of tanks, assures thermal stability. Outdoor wet areas, even under 
conditions of ice and snow, can produce good culturing conditions and excellent data or 
performance. With a little care and ingenuity, whatever could be done indoors probably can 
be done equally well outdoors. The hardships under such conditions are not usually felt by the 
culture organisms but by the servicing personnel. If the weather is benign, there is no hardship 
at all. These areas make excellent facilities for seasonal overload use. These periods of high 
demand, such as summer programs, tend to coincide with good weather seasons. Needless to 
say, outdoor wet labs are relatively inexpensive for the areas and capabilities provided. 
How are these outdoor wet areas configured? They often have a prepared, sloped asphalt 
surface with built in drains, either pipes or channels. A gravel surface is not as good as 
concrete or asphalt but is usually acceptable. Bare dirt or grass is usually not acceptable, since 
it will generally become a mud hole. While most are open and unrestricted areas, some have 
been built with permanent concrete tanks. Services must be available. These might be few and 
simple or just as numerous and varied as indoors. Except for the drains, no fixed distribution 
systems are usually provided. Distribution systems are often temporary or quasi-permanent 
installations, usually on the ground and as neatly placed as possible. This is not as bad as 
indoors, because more space is usually available. If there are no drains below grade, tanks will 
have to be elevated to provide the needed drainage heads. Electrical service may be provided 
at only one or two points. Some parts of the outdoor wet-lab areas may have light roofing 
to provide limited sun and rain protection. Pre-fabricated buildings without side walls are 
simple and economic and might be attractive if an increased level of protection is required. 
Another common and often useful addition is a small shed or mobile trailer in which to store 
equipment, carry out simple laboratory tests or serve as an office.

Chapter 17 
Construction Considerations 
17.1 Construction arrangements 
Arrangements for construction can be even more varied than arrangements for design. 
These can range from complete 'turn-key' contracts to complete 'do it yourself' approaches, 
with everything in between. Complete 'turn-key' situations are unlikely except for govern- 
mental facilities or for large companies with no previous experience in the field. Most of the 
smaller seawater systems to date have been predominately towards the 'do it yourself' side 
with varying degrees of outside contracted support. In many cases the user acts as his own 
general contractor. This has both advantages and disadvantages. The big advantage is that as 
problems surface they can be addressed and resolved with a minimum of contractual conflicts. 
In short, this option allows much more flexibility in handling the unexpected. On the other 
hand, the often stated major time and cost savings associated with being your own general 
contractor, in many cases, may not be that substantial. The big disadvantages are that the 
seawater user rarely has any directly relevant prior construction experience, does not have the 
required supportive infrastructure both in physical equipment or management systems, and 
generally grossly underestimates the problems encountered in the construction of aquaculture 
facilities. For a project of any size, a lot of time and effort goes into developing the required 
infrastructure, often by trial and error. Construction and deployment schedules, based on 
inexperience, rarely can anticipate errors or circumstances that lose time. Schedule slippage 
create a self-destructive panic mentality. This results in the adoption of short-term stop gap 
solutions rather than viable long-term answers. 
For owners with limited seawater construction experience, it may be prudent to retain an 
aquacultural engineer for some level of construction management (see Mayo, 1998) for a 
discussion of roles and responsibilities of the aquacultural engineering consultant). The level 
of involvement can range from periodic site visits to a full-time construction inspector. In 
large projects, the design engineer may also review shop drawings from the general contractor 
or subcontractors or review change orders (see Section 17.3). In the absence of a significant 
role in construction management it is difficult to hold the design engineer responsible for field 
changes made by the owner or contractor. 
17.2 Construction cost estimating 
For many projects, being able to accurately estimate costs may be critical. Costs may 
well be the dominant factor in major design decisions. Large estimating errors that become 
apparent late in a project can prove fatal to the project. It is, therefore, important to look at the 
estimating process. 

218 
Costing numbers can come from many sources. Some of the better general sources are 
commercially available construction costing guide annuals (Dodge, 2000; Means, 2000). 
These guides have not only unit prices but also installation and service costs with adjustment 
factors for different parts of the U.S. Such convenient cost estimating guides may not be 
available for some parts of the world. Initial cost estimating for projects in some of these 
countries has used the available guides, for lack of a better alternative, with adjustment 
factors for transportation, importation and local service costs. Since much of the specialized 
equipment is commonly imported for projects in these countries, these estimates are usually 
adequate for preliminary design, evaluation of alternatives, and decision making. When 
operating in unfamiliar parts of the world, it is very advisable, at some point in the design 
process, to develop an arrangement with a local engineering and design firm that has specific 
knowledge about conditions in the area, even though they may not have any aquacultural 
experience. Additional general sources for pricing data are catalogues from major mail-order 
firms such as Granger, McMaster and Sears. With these equipment cost numbers, it is 
important to adjust the values for the passage of time from the present to the estimated 
ordering date. It is also important to include related services, such as engineering services, 
transportation, import duties, broker fees, storage and assembly or preparation for installation. 
Neglecting these considerations can lead to major cost underestimations. 
There are other major sources of error. These include uncosted essential components 
or services. These missed items are often necessary but secondary components. Examples 
include a chain link fence around the facility, a concrete base for machinery, or a storage area. 
Another major source of errors results from the inclusion of new or upgraded requirements. 
These might include the requirement for water filtering halfway through design, where it 
had previously been judged to be unnecessary. Increased flow rate or additional temperature 
control are also examples. Surprisingly, the overall error on correctly identified items is 
usually small, even though the uncertainty about the cost of individual items is often high. 
While some items may prove to have been estimated high, others will be estimated low, and 
they tend to cancel. An exception is estimating the cost of in-water construction of intakes and 
discharges. Even engineers and architects with some experience in this area, will generally 
estimate far too low, and the cost discrepancies can be large. Rapidly increasing regulatory 
construction constraints are dramatically increasing in-water costs. In addition to in-water 
work, any changes in direction or requirements, project stoppages, and overlooked items or 
services are the major sources of underestimated costs. 
Cost estimates will usually be generated early in the project and continually modified as 
design progresses. These estimates are usually as detailed as design definition will allow 
and are often a source of feedback information that strongly influences the design efforts. 
Cost estimates almost inevitably creep or sometimes leap upward as the design definition 
progresses. Without dramatic downward scope changes, a general guide is that the final cost 
after everything is included will be about a factor of 7r greater than the first estimate. Why 
Jr ? The humorous answer is because it is an irrational number, but considerable experience 
indicates that a cost increase of about 300% is correct. Downward cost changes are usually the 
result of specific management decisions to reduce the project's size or scope. The budgeted 
cost contingency factor over the current cost estimate is a function of the design status and 
specific circumstances. However, with a completely specified design ready for construction 
bidding and a complete cost estimate, the cost contingency should not be less than 25%. This 

219 
is a somewhat higher value than sometimes used for general contracting but it is not a large 
number, since the major cost estimating errors already discussed can easily increase costs by 
a factor of two or more. 
17.3 Design changes 
The end purpose of the design and construction phase is an operational system. The design 
is based on a multitude of facts and assumptions about the site, species, operating procedures 
and operator skills. A specific project is likely to have some unique characteristics or unique 
combination of parameters that have never been tried before. Some of the possible inherent 
design problems and mistakes may show up during construction. Others will not be obvious 
until full-scale operations. The 'facts and assumptions' and value judgments on which the 
design is based may well change before construction is completed. This can occur as new 
information is received, from direct experience (if the site and species preparatory work 
has been properly done there should not be any site or species surprises, yet they do often 
occur), or from 'improvements' that are perceived during construction. Even more likely are 
important management decisions which result in a major change in the scale of the project, 
usually downward for cost and schedule reasons. Some design changes may be applied 
directly during construction, while the more disruptive changes may be held for retrofitting 
after the primary construction phase. Some changes may not fit either pattern. These are the 
critical changes that cannot be deferred or readily accommodated. These can halt construction 
completely while the problems are sorted out. These changes can easily kill a project, because 
a construction halt is very expensive, very disruptive, and certain to trigger a top management 
reassessment of the entire project. 
17.4 Installation of seawater lines 
If an intake system is to be placed offshore, its installation may be the single most 
difficult aspect of the project. Under the unlikely conditions that a site has no waves or 
water currents under any conditions or that the deployment is for a very short time period, 
the intake lines can be left exposed on the bottom. Even in this case, they will have to be 
secured with heavy collars, screw auger anchors, tiebacks, pilings or bent over rods driven 
into the bottom. For most conditions, the lines and intakes will have to be both excavated and 
secured. This excavation, placement and backfilling of lines and intakes may only be possible 
at certain seasons, tidal conditions and environmental conditions. This may impose severe 
scheduling constraints or delays into the entire project. Environment regulatory constraints 
on construction may dramatically increase these problems (see Section 3.3). Deployment 
opportunities may be very limited and not completely predictable. Environmental changes that 
occur during deployment can severely threaten the operation. It is therefore important to carry 
out the deployment cleanly and quickly. Due to these problems, intake and discharges may 
actually be built at considerable variance with the design specifications. 
Excavation methods will depend on soil types and environmental conditions. For common 
sand, clay, and mud bottoms with no appreciable waves or current, the trenches for the lines 
can be excavated with a backhoe or dragline from the beach at low tide, and from a barge at 
high tide. The trench will usually not backfill itself before the lines can be installed. Jetting 

220 
and blasting, if allowed, are two other options. Sediment curtains surrounding the excavation 
may be required. In the presence of significant current or waves, the tasks become much more 
difficult and should not be attempted by the inexperienced. At best, the jobs are difficult and 
can be almost impossible. 
There are at least two ways to lay the lines in the excavated trench. Since most intake lines 
are likely to be continuous synthetic pipes, these pipes will readily float, especially if full of 
air. These lines need weight to hold them on the bottom, even when full of water. This can be 
done with concrete collars. The entire line with concrete collars can be pulled off the beach, 
floated and held in position, then sunk in place by opening a temporary valve at the offshore 
end (Sclairpipe Marine Pipeline Installation Construction, 1969; Janson, 1975). After removal 
of the end plug and valve, the intake structure can be lowered and secured to the end of the 
line. The intake structure and line can then be secured to the bottom and backfilled. Under 
some conditions, the pipe may tend to rise in the trench on being backfilled (Janson, 1975). 
The second method is to assemble the line and intake together on shore. If the intake is formed 
into a sled type arrangement, the intake and line can be dragged directly down the trench 
along the bottom (Bouck, 1981). In this case, weight was added after positioning, by filling 
some of the pipes with concrete. It would probably be possible to add some jetting capability 
directly to an 'intake' sled, so that it could excavate its own trench in some soil types. There 
is trenching equipment used in the offshore oil industry to bury pipe lines, which might also 
be useable but it is very expensive. If the trench shows a tendency to backfill itself, it may be 
possible to let nature carry out this task. In sheltered areas, nature may be too slow and the 
trench may have to be backfilled. 
17.5 Start-up 
It is virtually inevitable, especially in the 'do it yourself' projects, that initial start-up and 
operations will commence before construction is fully completed. Even if both construction 
and operating crews work for the same company, it is imperative that there be a clear chain of 
command and coordinated activities between the groups to avoid mutual interference. 
Initial start-up of various systems has to be done with some care, whether by construction 
or operating personnel. The system to be started must be carefully and personally checked by 
the person in charge immediately prior to initial start-up. Things to be checked include that 
the system to be tested is complete (an incomplete system may not perform as intended), all 
components and parts are firmly secured (not just in position), there are no tools, rocks or 
debris in lines or sumps, the system is in start-up configuration (switches, valves and hatches 
in correct position, guards, interlocks and safeties 'on') and lastly that all personnel are clear 
of hazards and aware of what is about to happen. The previous sentences appear to be obvious 
and logical, but not doing these things has resulted in much serious damage. Examples of 
problems include a foreman taking the word of a worker that rocks have been removed from 
a sump, a switch in the full-on position instead of full-off, an open unvalved pipe in a large 
tank and a worker unaware of impending operation of a piece of equipment. Even if all these 
things are well done, the initial start-up is still a relatively high risk operation. If anything has 
been designed, fabricated, or installed improperly it may quickly become apparent. Start-up 
procedures have to be well thought out before hand, and implemented as planned. This is 
not the time for hasty or snap judgments. When starting equipment, alertness and prompt 

221 
shutdown can avert otherwise serious damage if something is wrong. This may require 
stationing people in various critical places and providing them means for communicating. 
Signs of problems include unusual noise or vibration, burning smells or smoke; water where 
it is not supposed to be; lack of water where it is supposed to be; and equipment getting hotter 
than it should. It is not uncommon to have several cycles of start-stop-reevaluate-restart, 
even for a perfectly good system. Common problems can be: a virgin 'self-priming' pump 
not priming itself the first time; some squeaking rotating machinery that was not lubricated; 
air locks in the pipes; vibrating parts that need to be better secured; and a system that is 
erroneously configured. The first few minutes of operations, as the equipment proceeds to 
steady state or equilibrium conditions, and testing over the first few operating cycles (such as 
tidal) are the most dangerous. Weak components usually will fail after some relatively short 
period of actual use, generally a few days up to a few weeks. After this 'burn in' period 
the probability of the equipment failing is relatively low. However, there is the possibility 
of operational problems due to seasonal factors, which may take some time to develop. In 
addition, there is a high potential for serious problems during the first few major storm events 
experienced by a new system. 
During initial start-up the experience level of all personnel with the specific equipment 
involved is usually at a minimum. The operators are not familiar with the equipment 
capabilities, limitations and specific constraints. Problems that have occurred include: toxicity 
due to 'new' materials; destruction of piping by water hammer due to closing valves too 
quickly; the overheating and death of brood stocks due to uncalibrated or poorly set heating 
controls; drain lines clogged with construction residues; or inadvertently contaminating or 
cross-feeding with different water types.

223 
Chapter 18 
Operational Considerations 
18.1 Operating procedures 
The design of the seawater system is partially based on the operating procedures that are 
expected to be followed. These include batch versus continuous operations in various parts of 
the system, expected seasonality in operations, scale and duration of culturing phases, need 
for water conditioning services, ranges of system operating values, training and experience of 
personnel, etc. The capabilities of the system will be dependent on these expected operating 
procedures. If they change, the seawater system may be found to be less than adequate 
to support the new procedures. This may require system modifications or putting up with 
marginal and inefficient operating methods. Operating procedures can change in many ways. 
If the need for some additional service becomes apparent after design or construction, serious 
problems may result if sufficient flexibility was not built into the system. Examples are 
addition of chlorination/dechlorination of culture water, need for better filtration, greater 
quantities of water, more aeration, or greater water temperature control capabilities. Often 
these needs had been considered during the design phase but dropped for cost reasons and 
because their need at that time had not been compelling. A designer with foresight will have 
left floor space and easy access to piping for possible later retrofit. 
Operating procedures also tend to be specific to individuals, especially in the details and 
in the organization of tasks. This is inevitable, as many culturing operations today are still 
more an art than an exact science. This does not make one set fight and the other wrong, they 
are just different. Design decisions are often based on the preferences and value judgments of 
key individuals. If key operating personnel are changed, incompatibilities and inefficiencies 
between the physical plant and the 'new' operating procedures can develop. 
The skill levels of personnel using seawater systems depends a great deal on the system's 
objectives. Research systems usually have a number of highly educated users, although 
this does not necessarily mean that they are all familiar with start-up and operation of 
complex mechanical equipment. The majority are usually from the biological sciences and 
they may have little background or interest outside of their areas of specialization. Manning 
of commercial systems usually follows the '6-3-1' Rule. For every ten people, six are 
intelligent and responsible but need no specialized knowledge or education; three have 
specialized knowledge through education or experience, or preferably both; and only one 
needs comprehensive knowledge and experience, including management experience. For 
commercial systems, a leader with only a Ph.D. and little practical experience usually proves 
inadequate. Commercial systems are hazardous enough, so that 'on the job training' for key 
individuals can be an expensive proposition. 

224 
18.2 Assignment of responsibilities 
While the chain of command for use of the system or component parts is usually clear, this 
is often not the case for the servicing, maintenance and repair activities. Problems in these 
areas are at least as critical as any of the biological functions. There may not be a clearly 
identifiable individual in charge of these services and, if he exists, he is unlikely to have the 
same status as the other system users or as clear a chain of command. If the service personnel 
are considered to work for all the various user groups, problems can develop. Key system users 
and team leaders are continually trying to improve their areas of activity whether production, 
research or education and will assign the service people accordingly. In effect, having too 
many bosses may be suboptimizing the overall process by expending time and resources on 
noncritical nonlimiting activities which could be used much more productively elsewhere. 
Some of the modifications and maintenance tasks might even be in conflict and self defeating 
in terms of the overall system. It is essential that the service function be accountable only to 
the top operational person, the same as any other key individual, group, team or department. 
This will enable the correct priorities to be assigned and long-term, but critical aspects, 
such as preventive maintenance, scheduled overhauls, and adequate spare-parts inventory will 
not be overlooked. With all the problems that routinely occur with seawater systems, these 
important activities are often ignored until they become critical, usually by unfortunate but not 
completely unexpected equipment failure. If the service function does not have an identifiable 
leader, these responsibilities are generally fragmented or assumed by someone as a secondary 
function. However, these individuals may often have their own problems and may not be able 
to give the service area the full attention that it often requires. 
18.3 Spares and redundancy 
During the design phase considerable thought is usually given to system reliability and the 
need for redundant equipment, which is ready to be used in the event of equipment failure. 
Decisions and trade-offs of cost for backup equipment versus system dependability must be 
carefully made. Areas for such redundancy often include spare pumps, compressors, motors, 
intakes, and backup power sources. Redundant equipment gives time for repairs of failed 
equipment without loss of services. Prolonged loss of services usually means disaster. What 
often happens in operations is that the backup equipment is brought on-line to increase the 
service. It then is no longer redundant but primary. If the consequences of failure without 
backup were considered unacceptable during design, are they likely to be less so with 
everything on-line? If the backup equipment is needed for a short-term emergency in a critical 
area, it will obviously be used. Once so used, like virginity, the redundant equipment may 
now be considered available for routine service. This must not be allowed to occur. If there 
is no alternative, additional equipment must be immediately purchased and installed. If it 
cannot be actually installed due to space or access limitations, it should be acquired and 
prepared so it can replace a failed unit in a minimum of time. Unfortunately, convincing 
management to purchase expensive equipment when there is no immediate problem with the 
current equipment and in the presence of other more immediate crises is very difficult. The 
same problem occurs with the purchase of spare parts. The inevitability of serious problems 
and the subsequent assignment of blame to the innocent is completely predictable. 

TABLE 18.1 
Critical spare parts and supplies 
225 
Spare parts are expensive. What parts should be on-hand depends on ordering delays, assurance of supply, and 
consequences of not having them in-hand during an emergency. The items below are often justified spare parts and 
supplies. 
9 Pump impellers 
9 Pump seals 
9 Pipe fittings (Couplings, L's, T's, etc.) 
9 Valves 
9 Lengths of pipe 
9 Pipe thread cutting equipment 
9 Plastic pipe adhesives, thread sealer 
9 Pipe patching components 
9 Ample hand tools 
9 Electrical breakers, fuses, GFI, etc. 
9 Skin and SCUBA diving equipment, small boat 
9 Spare intake screen 
9 Filter media, cartridges, bags, etc. 
9 Gasoline powered pump unit with hoses 
9 Portable gasoline powered generator 
The spare-parts problem has several other aspects. One is the availability of spare parts. If 
spare parts are readily and quickly available, then a minimum of on-hand parts are needed. 
If spare parts are difficult and time consuming to get, a large inventory is required. While 
the specifics of which spare parts to inventory dependent on the conditions, some items and 
supplies are often included (Table 18.1). Some spare parts are often ordered with the basic 
equipment and this is usually no problem. Those spare parts from the original purchase that 
are actually used should be immediately replaced, as these are the ones most likely to be 
needed again. This can easily be put off in the presence of more immediate problems, which 
surely would be a serious mistake. Management must be convinced of the importance of 
adequate on-hand spare parts. At remote sites, absence of parts can literally close down the 
system for prolonged periods of time. A loss of services and resultant mass mortality will 
automatically result in a minimum loss of one production cycle, even if the parts are quickly 
available, and possibly much longer if they are not. If larval forms are involved, only a few 
weeks may be lost, while for brood stocks decades of work maybe eradicated. 
When a piece of equipment fails and a backup is brought on-line, the system is now 
operating in a high-risk mode without a backup. It is essential to assign top priority to 
restoring a backup capability in the minimum time. Sometimes the equipment failure is 
not complete, in that the equipment still functions, but does not perform to the minimum 
requirements. In this case, the backup may be brought on-line and the defective unit becomes 
the backup, while repair plans are implemented. Until repairs are accomplished, it may be 
possible to reduce or reassign internal services to minimize the consequences of additional 
partial failures. 
When there is an equipment failure, it is very important to determine the cause. If the 
failure was due to conditions external to the equipment, then the backup equipment may soon 

226 
suffer the same fate. If a piece of equipment has been performing well and suddenly fails, the 
operating conditions may have changed and the equipment may have been forced to operate 
outside its specifications or some servicing requirements may not have been met. Failures 
due to age or normal wear rarely occur without a great deal of warning. While normal wear 
may be characterized by long-term decreasing performance, the same symptoms may indicate 
changing operating conditions and resulting accelerated wear. Typical examples include 
pumping water with a lot of sand and effects of biofouling. Biofouling can dramatically 
increase suction-side frictional losses and pumps can then no longer meet their suction-side 
NPSH requirements. The net result is cavitation, accelerated impeller deterioration and 
reduced flow. When some expensive parts, such as impellers, have to be frequently replaced, 
the tendency is to blame it on poor design rather than on poor servicing or use under improper 
conditions. 
18.4 Preventive maintenance 
Much of the philosophy relating to spares and redundancy also applies to preventive main- 
tenance. Equipment failures that cannot be quickly compensated for can lead to unacceptable 
consequences. Equipment that is not properly maintained will sooner or later fail. Since most 
maintenance tasks can be postponed without immediate or obvious consequences, it is very 
easy to get careless. Carrying out required maintenance demands discipline. Even if properly 
maintained, the equipment, or at least some parts of it, may be expected to wear out with 
extended service. In this case we are discussing normal wear, not that due to improper use, 
and the time interval may be many years. Whether wear is normal can be determined by expe- 
rience with similar equipment or by consulting the manufacturer. Highly wear-prone parts are 
often readily accessible; however, other parts may have to be replaced in an overhaul activity 
which is more extensive than routine maintenance, or the entire unit replaced. These overhauls 
or replacements should occur when the probability of failure becomes sufficiently increased 
due to wear, or when the performance approaches a minimum acceptable value. Both routine 
maintenance and equipment overhaul and replacement should occur while the equipment 
is operating normally without immediate problems. This provides planning and scheduling 
flexibility and will tend to minimize impacts on other activities. All these servicing functions 
require personnel time, resources and sometimes appreciable money. Many seawater systems 
are operated in a 'crisis management' mode, that is, nothing is done or resources expended 
until a problem reaches crisis proportions. By this time the options are few and the costs and 
consequences are high. In the presence of immediate crises and tight budgets, maintenance 
activities are usually put off and the potential disastrous consequences of failures, for which 
one is unprepared, are forgotten. In actual operations it is very difficult to give maintenance 
activities the priority dictated by long-term economics. 
18.5 Monitoring and control 
Monitoring and control is a critical activity, although this engineering phrase is rarely used. 
It is one's capability to know at any given time what is going on in the system and one's 
capability, by conscious actions, to alter or influence what is taking place. If something is 
going wrong and you do not know it, you obviously cannot do anything about it. If you know 

227 
something is going wrong, but do not have the capability to change it in a timely manner, you 
are no better off. 
With experience, monitoring and control functions are usually accomplished, but often 
without the realization of what they are. Greatly increased capabilities can result from more 
conscious attention. This does not necessarily mean more monitoring/alarm systems and 
automated equipment, although these can be very helpful (see Chapter 14). The most valuable 
inputs on the operational status of a system are often visual confirmation of water flow or 
water levels, and sounds or rather changes in sounds. These sounds may be associated with 
flowing water or mechanical equipment. An experienced person will react to even minor 
sound changes and promptly investigate. An inexperienced person may feel uneasy without 
knowing why, especially if the sound change is not dramatic. Timely action can often prevent 
serious damage. This does not mean that a lot of noise is good. However, it should be noted 
that excessive sound levels in mechanical areas can be a serious health problem and are not 
desirable for monitoring and control as they can mask the presence or absence of more im- 
portant sounds. Having all personnel check equipment performance visually and listen during 
their normal daily activities and report anything unusual, buys a lot of monitoring capability. 
The problems arise when equipment is remote, rarely visited, or during periods of greatly 
reduced personnel activity, such as at night. Under these conditions, if something starts going 
wrong it may not be discovered for a long time or until it produces serious effects elsewhere. 
It is under these conditions that automatic monitoring and alarm systems are most valuable. 
It is important not only to know something is wrong, but also that this information gets to 
someone who can act quickly. In an emergency, actions may require sacrificing some activities 
to save others. Obviously, the overall priorities should rule rather than that of individual 
activities. While the normal chain of command for such decision making is usually clear, 
problems can develop in the absence of the key individual or at odd hours (like 3 AM). 
Time and circumstances in emergencies may force relatively junior personnel to make critical 
decisions. Under these conditions, a 'do nothing' or deferred decision may be worse than 
a wrong action. If there are critical operations in progress, there must be an identifiable 
individual and a backup person available at all times, who are responsible for reacting to 
emergencies. These people must be provided with decision making guidelines to forestall 
later recriminations, given access to system technical information, communications and keys 
or codes that they may require. Needless to say that they also have to be familiar with the 
equipment and its operation. Restarting a complex seawater system after a shutdown may 
be a very elaborate process. Rarely does it involve simply restoring power. There may be 
many flow, temperature, pressure, and water-level interlocks and automatic shut-offs, that 
restrict the restart sequence. For safety reasons, most equipment must be manually reset and 
restarted. Electric motors require three times their normal electric current during start-up. This 
can be an important consideration in the start-up sequencing with limited power reserves. 
Pumps in particular may have priming requirements or other eccentricities. Small pumps, 
which may automatically restart on resumption of power, or larger pumps, which are started 
without assuring prime, may self destruct if allowed to operate without priming or without 
water. Means of pump priming, possibly several options, should be readily available. All these 
problems can be compounded if the system has to be reconfigured to bypass or circumvent a 
failure. In some cases, the potential for doing additional damage during system restart may be 
high. These types of problems must all be anticipated before they occur. The ability to easily 

228 
restart after various failures may be as important as the operating characteristics under normal 
conditions. 
18.6 Operational problem areas 
Operational problem areas tend to arise from two sources. One is due to internal process 
problems, that may be the result of design errors or inadequate operating procedures. Some 
of these include problems arising from materials, use of chlorine, gas supersaturation, and 
monitoring and control limitations. Many of these have already been discussed in previous 
sections. The other source involves failures of the system. The most common types and causes 
of such failures in coastal aquaculture facilities are listed on Table 18.2. A good review of 
types of failures and emergency procedures can be found in Shepherd and Morris (1987). 
Note that electrical power loss is high on the list of problems in Table 18.2. Backup power 
is very common in seawater system, and ranges from small gasoline powered units to large 
automatic starting diesel generators. Backup electrical power has a number of considerations 
(Wilton and Morey, 2000). Again, the best preventive measures against failure are care during 
the design phase and adoption of good operating procedures, including system maintenance. 
An important problem area, which has not yet been discussed, involves security. Few 
systems are manned 24 hours a day. Large complex reuse system, because problems can 
develop very quickly, are often the exception. Seawater systems and what they may contain 
can have a great deal of curiosity appeal and even monetary value. To limit inadvertent 
damage and for liability reasons, access to the system may have to be restricted. This may 
be easy or difficult depending on the circumstances. It may be as simple as doors, locks, and 
fences. In some cases theft and vandalism are also serious possibilities, which may require 
more extensive counter measures. For enclosed areas, the use of big dogs has in some cases 
proven useful. If an alarm system is already required, it should be relatively straightforward to 
connect up intruder and fire sensors to the system. Security and security related problems can 
become major operational concerns. 
One more topic must be considered. That is safety of personnel, especially electrical safety. 
TABLE 18.2 
Common sources of seawater systems damage and failures 
While the relative probability of various problems will depend on the conditions, the following list is in order of 
frequency for one large and complex seawater system over a prolonged period of time. 
(1) Loss of electric power 
(2) Screens or filters clogged 
(3) Human error (erroneous operations, foreign object blockages, misunderstandings) 
(4) Marine biofouling 
(5) Vandalism or unexplained damage 
(6) Corrosion 
(7) Storms and related effects (high water, heavy rains, water-borne trash, high turbidity, wave damage) 
(8) Boiler or heating plant failure 
(9) Boat anchor or fishing trawler damage to intakes 
(10) Failure to service suction side screens and piping leading to pump problems 

TABLE 18.3 
Tips for improving electrical safety around seawater systems 
229 
9 Provide all electrical circuits, both indoors and outside, with ground fault interrupters (GFI). In many areas, 
GFI protection is required by building code. 
9 Have all electrical equipment properly checked before use in or around seawater systems. This is especially true 
for outdoor use. 
9 Avoid splashing around drains. This will keep the floor dry, reduce humidity and avoid salt cake buildup. 
9 Adequately pitch all floors towards drains to promote fast drainage and avoid puddles. 
9 Adequately ventilate rooms to reduce humidity. 
9 If salt builds up on floors, flush with fresh water. 
9 Size drains for maximum transient flow, such as when draining a large tank. Place mesh screen (not too fine) on 
drain to avoid foreign object clogging. Clean drain screens regularly. 
9 Do not place any electrical equipment under water pipes or tanks. Even if no leakage or accidents occur, 
components containing water can sometimes produce dripping water through condensation. 
9 Do not place any electrical outlets on or near the floor. Overhead distribution of electric power is much 
preferred. 
Considering what is often done, it is surprising that there are not more serious accidents 
involving seawater systems. Electric power and seawater do not mix very well. This is due 
to the extreme corrosiveness and high electrical conductivity of seawater. A current leak that 
would give only a 'tingle' in a freshwater system might be deadly with seawater. Table 18.3 
is a list of good practical tips to minimize electrical hazards around seawater systems and 
in wet-lab areas. Electrical safety around seawater systems should be viewed as a personal 
problem, the life you save might be your own. 
A summary of much of the content of this chapter is included on Table 18.4. It specifically 
provides guidance for the management and operations of large marine science research and 
TABLE 18.4 
Suggestions for management of marine science facilities 
9 A Lab Director should be appointed early in the Design Process. Programs must be planned, operational 
procedures developed, sources of operating funds secured, and staffing organized in parallel with facility design 
and construction. These activities can impact decisions during the detail design phase and greatly help the 
initial start-up and transition to operations. 
9 The Lab Director should be an established marine scientist with management and people skills. Marine science 
tends to be a feudal system with each Principal Investigator (PI) or Faculty being a sovereign entity. The Lab 
Director's management of lab activities can be considered akin to trying to herd cats. The Lab Director has to 
have control over ALL activities taking place in the facility or chaos will result. 
9 If the facility is of any size, the Lab Director should secure, as early as possible, a full time administrative 
assistant. The amount of paper work required can be impressive and includes both writing proposals and 
reviewing proposals of prospective PIs and Faculty. The Lab Director has to assure that all programs and 
projects using the facility comply with legal requirements from outside, those of the overall institution and the 
policies and operating procedures of the lab. The lab's fees or overhead rate, if distinct from that of the 
institution, also have to be included in all proposals. 

230 
TABLE 18.4 (continued) 
A major facility will require at least one, and very possibly several, full time facilities and plant people to keep 
the seawater system and physical plant operating efficiently. They should be paid through lab overhead funds. 
This staff will require regular assistance from the institution's Facility and Plant Department. This is distinct 
from animal husbandry or research assistant type activities, which are usually staffed and funded by project or 
departmental funds. 
The lab's Facilities and Plant Manager should report to the Lab Director rather than the institution's Facilities 
and Plant Director. The F&P Director has institution-wide responsibilities and priorities and may not be 
familiar with lab scheduling or with aquatic life support constraints and requirements. The F&P Manager's 
interest should be centered on supporting lab objectives. The F&P Manager will have to work on a close and 
probably daily basis with the institution's F&P Director. The institution's F&P Director still retains overall 
responsibility for the institution's physical plant. This arrangement can and has worked well in the past. 
9 The lab's F&P Manager should be mechanically clever and resourceful, with a broad technical background, 
management skills, and seawater system experience. Past experience is much more important than a lot of 
degrees. Seawater systems are not static but in a continuous state of modification and change to meet new or 
expanding requirements. A good F&P Manager is critical to this process. 
9 The lab F&P Manager should have sufficient status so that he does NOT have to respond to the wishes of 
individual PIs or Faculty, since they tend to suboptimize. The F&P Manager should be guided and protected by 
the Lab Director in his many day-to-day operating decisions. Adjudicating and allotting resources among the 
'feudal lords' is the Lab Director's cross to bear. 
Guidelines for the F&P Manager and his staff to be used in emergencies have to be established before these 
situations arise (and they will). This involves relative priorities and who gets hurt first if critical decisions have 
to be made quickly and at times inconvenient for consultations (3 AM during a storm is a popular time for such 
emergencies). People on call have to have such guidelines and have to be protected from possible 
recriminations after the fact. 
9 A difficult aspect for the lab's F&P Manager is maintaining an adequate inventory of critical spare parts. If 
something goes wrong, they have to be on hand to minimize any possible seawater system downtime. Seawater 
system downtime, even if short, can result in mass mortalities. The problem is that money for parts has to 
compete for funds with other lab activities and they do not seem important when operations are going well. The 
parts that get used first are likely to be those that will again be needed in the future and they should be replaced 
immediately. The problem of securing needed priority also holds for preventive maintenance, including 
replacing expensive equipment BEFORE it fails. 
9 It is critical for the F&P manager to maintain an adequate inventory of plastic pipe and fittings. However, every 
PI and Faculty may see this supply as a source of parts for THEIR projects. Again, the F&P Manager must 
have sufficient status relative to individual PIs and Faculty to control this problem. The Lab Director should 
establish policy to this area. 
9 An aquatic life support system is a complex system with many component parts. Policy is needed as to who is 
authorized to turn things on or off. PIs and Faculty should be authorized to turn things on or off only at THEIR 
point of use. They should not be allowed to tamper with other peoples setups, open valves upstream, increase 
the size of the valves at the point of distribution or turn on backup equipment to increase the resources available 
to them. Clear physical separation between system users and removing or securing valve handles helps. 
9 The Lab Director has to resist pressure to turn on backup equipment under normal conditions to increase the 
available resources. Backup equipment is for use in an emergency. If the needs are that pressing, turning on 
backups increases the probability of a critical failure with unacceptably high consequences. 

231 
educational seawater systems. While the technical and operational aspects of marine science 
seawater systems is similar to all others, the social structure of marine science labs can 
considerably complicate their proper management. The Lab Director may be 'outranked' by 
the seawater systems users in terms of seniority, prestige/reputation, high positions elsewhere 
in the institution or in the 'outside' world, or just by the size of their egos. In contrast, 
commercial systems usually have a clear and universally accepted chain of command and a 
straightforward social structure. The table is based on considerable experience.

Chapter 19 
Putting It All Together 
As can be seen from this book, seawater systems have many interactive components. One 
can not randomly select parts and put them together with much chance of it 'working'. 
The specific objectives, site characteristics, system components (pipes, pumps and processing 
equipment) as well as water quality and material considerations are all highly interactive. The 
number of technical considerations that must be considered in system design are very large. 
Many of the important considerations have been discussed separately in the various chapters. 
It is now important to combine the factors and discuss the interactive effects. If one were 
doing one of the Examples in this chapter for actual implementation, it would be good practice 
to have the output reviewed by a colleague. It is very easy, even for the experienced, to forget 
or overlook an important factor in making the many design decisions that must be made. 
Due to the technical complexity, it is fortunate that many seawater projects are rather small 
scale, low key or remotely located. Many are additions to existing facilities and thus can be 
either 'grandfathered' or slide through without much notice. However, the opportunities for 
this are narrowing rapidly and do not exist for entirely new systems and systems of any size. 
While this chapter will focus on the technical aspects, the economic, political, legal and 
regulatory aspects often dominate decision making. There are many different participants 
with quite different objectives and interests (architects, lawyers, regulators, fund raisers, 
accountants, and hosts of managers). Few of these have any comprehension of the technical 
aspects. 'Image', public relations and visual aesthetics can sometimes take on extraordinary 
importance. Technical people and actual users (as distinct from their management) rarely are 
in the position of making any major decisions. There can be so much push and pull that 
it is like trying to herd cats. 'Managers' and architects like to move seawater system parts 
around and make them bigger or smaller with no comprehension of the consequences and 
tipple effects on the total system. More expensive mistakes have been made by managers 
trying to save small amounts of money in the short term than any other reason. Technical 
people are often in a continual 'management education' mode, while trying not be insulting or 
lose patience. Some core truths have to be continually iterated, such as water runs downhill, 
animals have life support needs, area is proportional to the square and volume of the cube, and 
many interactions are fixed by physical and biological laws and not by management, budgets 
or human schedules. Many of these core truths and useful principles are listed in Chapter 20, 
Summary Commandments. 
Site considerations have been discussed in Chapters 3, 4 and 5, but the interactions are 
even more extensive. A specific site will ALWAYS place technical constraints on system 
design. These constraints can be minor or serious enough to preclude use of the site. 
Unfortunately, a whole host of non-technical constraints can also be imposed. When these 
are added to the technical constraints it can seriously impact the feasibility of the project. 
Redesigning components slightly or rearranging them on a specific site can have major 
system consequences. Moving seawater components around on a site can be caused by such 

234 
considerations as parking needs or aesthetics. In short, considerations far removed from 
seawater technical requirements. Example 19.1 considers a large number of factors involved 
with the selection of seawater intake and discharge locations. While most are technical 
considerations, it tries to cover some of the more likely, legal, political, and regulatory 
considerations that might be present in a given situation. However, each situation can be very 
different in their specifics and this is not a comprehensive treatment of the subject. Many of 
these non-technical aspects can be critical. 
Once a seawater intake location is selected it is necessary to determine exactly how far 
offshore to place the intake. The cost of marine construction is so high that there is a strong 
inclination to minimize the in-water pipe lengths. This often becomes an important exercise 
in balancing risks and costs. Site factors (Chapter 3), intake depth considerations (Chapter 
4) and suction side piping frictional losses (Chapter 6) can combine with factors not directly 
involved with seawater system requirements to establish these critical in-water pipe lengths. 
See Example 19.2. High tidal ranges complicate many aspects of seawater system design, 
including intake placement. High tidal range can greatly extend the in-water pipe lengths, 
aggravating both suction side frictional losses and construction cost concerns. When the 
lengths required to get water at a very low tide become excessive, a pump storage system 
might be considered. See Example 19.3. 
Pumps are generally selected after the seawater system is dimensionally laid out. Since the 
system and pumps are highly interactive, it can happen that pump selection options may be 
very limited. Design iterations between system design and pump selection are not uncommon. 
Example 19.4 further explores the dynamics of pump and system interactions and shows how 
important changes can occur with time due to biofouling or external conditions, such as major 
storms. A system that 'works' may not work under all conditions or over time if not properly 
maintained. Pump system failures can occur quickly due to the loss of available NPSH 
(see Chapter 7). This can be due to lowered atmospheric pressure or rapid accumulation of 
storm-generated seaweed and other debris on the intake screen. 
Many seawater systems are used for limited periods of time, such as over a summer or 
for a specific project. These are commonly set up on a pier or along the shore and, due to 
their short-term nature, can be greatly simplified in construction and operations. Example 19.5 
shows the planning and design of such a system. Elements from just about every chapter of 
this book are included in this basic simple example. It is important to remember that there is 
no single 'correct' solution but a complete spectrum of options. However, some options may 
be much better than others. Many unstated factors or details about the specific requirements, 
environment or legal/political situation could easily have altered this design. 
It is important in system design to anticipate operations and maintenance problems that 
might occur and to plan for them. An example (see Example 19.6) is solids accumulation at 
the first 'slow spot' in the system. This example is for the slow accumulation of sediments 
in channels, large tanks and ponds that can occur from using seawater from more turbulent 
coastal waters. It is exactly the kind of problem that can take time to develop into a serious 
situation. Many things in the servicing, maintenance, overhaul and equipment replacement 
areas can act this way. You tend to put them off until they reach crisis proportions or cause 
a major failure. This example demonstrates that it may take major resources to address these 
types of operational problems and they must be confronted early in the project. They can add 
substantially to both initial costs for plant and equipment and to subsequent operating costs. 

235 
Example 19.1. Seawater system intake and discharge location 
In a real situation a very large number of factors may have to be considered and weighed in selecting the 
locations for seawater intakes and discharges, any one of them may be potentially critical. The hypothetical 
example illustrated by the provided sketch is intended to form a basis for qualitative discussion of possible 
options and considerations. However, such a simplified exercise tends to ignore, or understate, the many 
important but often highly specific legal, political, and economic circumstances that might be present in a 
given situation.

(A) List and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the sites numbered 1 to 5 as seawater intakes or 
discharge locations. 
#1 
9 Easy land access due to road, probable cheap pipe run. 
9 Easy access to deep water under pier, cheap seaward pipe run on or under pier for either intake 
or discharge. 
9 Reasons A to E below indicate probable water quality problems. Water quality may eliminate 
otherwise attractive intake location. 
(A) Wooden pier pilings probably treated, additional likelihood of periodic dock repairs with 
introduction of new treated pilings. 
(B) Normal and accidental boat waste and fuel discharges. 
(C) Boat-induced turbidity. 

236 
Example 19.1. (continued) 
#2 
(D) Other possible sources of harbor pollution (industrial, sewage or other ship discharges). 
(E) Possibly significant rapid changes in water salinity or temperature due to storms, shallow 
harbor, freshwater inflows or harbor circulations. 
9 Good place for discharge, but discharge may not be allowed in harbor, little likelihood of 
recycling discharge if intake is on seaward side of peninsula. 
9 Short pipe run distance on land. 
9 Sheltered area for intake or discharge. 
9 Offshore pipe run distance for intake unknown but likely long to get adequate depth in harbor. 
9 Intake would have at least some of the water quality concerns of location #1. 
9 Good possible discharge area, if allowed. 
9 Little likelihood of recycling discharge if intake on seaward side of peninsula. 
#3 
9 Relatively long land-side pipe run, although most can be alongside of road 
9 Steep contours near shoreline and probability of high tidal currents may create engineering 
problems. 
9 Engineering of required but unknown length of in-water intake line may be especially difficult 
due to currents, ship traffic and partially exposed location. 
9 Likely to have different water quality on incoming and outgoing tides (open water vs harbor 
water), possibly negating site as intake location. 
9 Better as discharge location, with small probability of short-circuiting of discharge if intake at 
location #4 or #5 due to assumed prevailing currents. For harbor intake, somewhat higher 
probability of recycling but probably still small due to physical separation. 
#4 
9 Shortest land pipe run but complicated by steep contours and rocky shore. 
9 Rocky shore and exposed location may lead to construction difficulties for offshore piping but 
contours indicate probable short intake length to get adequate depth. 
9 Probability of consistent good 'open water type water quality. 
#5 
9 Longer land-side pipe length than most other locations but less severe contours. 
9 Probability of consistent good 'open water' type water quality. 
9 Likelihood of vehicular access to shoreline may be significant construction and servicing 
advantage, especially relative to locations #2, #3 and #4. 
9 Backside of groin is somewhat sheltered but may have an eddy, which collects floating and 
drifting debris. 
9 If a major storm comes in from the 'other' open water quadrant, the backside of the groin may 
be completely filled with sediment during a single event. 
9 If intake is placed here, it should extend well past the end of the groin. 
9 Best as intake location, for discharge would probably provide some short-circuiting to other 
locations (especially #3 and #4), which may be acceptable based on more detailed circulation 
data and specific location. 
(B) Based on probable engineering, complexity, cost and water quality considerations, list the most 
promising intake and discharge locations as pairs in descending order. Since many possibly important factors 
are undefined and relative weighing of factors can vary, this listing is not definitive but only a guide.

Example 19.2. Seawater intake placement depths 
A seawater system (4 in. intake pipe, 150 gpm flow) intake is to be installed in a well sheltered area near 
Pensacola Florida. The nearshore bottom has a slope of 1:40 and it is estimated that even waves from 
extreme events will not break in water depths greater than 5 ft. Waves under normal conditions are negligible. 
(A) Estimate the minimum water depth and distance from shore (relative to MSL) for the seawater intake 
under normal conditions. 
From Table 3.2 at Pensacola MHHW = 0.67 ft, MLLW = -0.63 ft (mean tidal range 1.3 ft) 
Record high = 8.3 ft, Record low -- -2.8 ft 
Using Eqs. 3.1 and 3.2 for intakes (C = 4) 
Design low tide (DLT) = -0.63 - (1.3)/4 = -0.955 ft 
Design high tide (DHT) = 0.67 + (1.3)/4 = 0.995 ft 
Design tidal range = 1.95 ft 
From Fig. 4.3, need allowances for elevation above the bottom and for vortexing. In this case, a wave 
allowance is not necessary. Flow velocity in intake pipe from Table 6.2 is about 4.2 ft/s and from Fig. 4.4, 
need about 2 ft minimum above the intake for a vortexing allowance. Assuming that the intake pipe is 
oriented upwards, a minimum elevation above the bottom of 1 ft is required to avoid ingestion of bottom 
debris (if intake is horizontal at least 3 ft is needed). This results in a minimum water depth below DLT of 
3.0 ft. If small boat traffic is a potential problem, may need more clearance above the pipe than required for 
vortexing to clear propellers. A 3.0 ft minimum clearance above the intake pipe or screen should in most 
cases be adequate. This translates to a minimum water depth below DLT of 4 ft. With a 40:1 beach slope the 
horizontal distance is as shown on the sketch below and is 198 ft.

(B) Discuss the trade-offs in intake location and water depth to cover extreme events. 
If the record low tide was to be repeated and the system could be shut down for a short time interval without 
major consequences, no changes would be needed. For the intake in Part A (small craft clearance), operation 
at the record low would still leave about 1.2 ft of water above the intake. It would probably operate under 
these conditions but might vortex and ingest air, with possibilities of mass mortalities due to gas 
supersaturation. An additional 72 ft of pipe (extra 1.8 ft of depth) would substantially reduce the risks. 
However, it is important to remember that vortexing is a complicated phenomenon and not completely 
predictable. 

238 
Example 19.2. (continued) 
If breaking waves hit the intake structure, destruction is highly likely. Going to deeper water to avoid 
breaking waves may save the intake, but does not guarantee that the waves will not uncover and destroy the 
more inshore parts of the intake line. The worst case situation (not very likely) is a record low tide combined 
with extreme waves. This would require a minimum of 5 ft of water relative to the recorded low (see sketch) 
and about 114 ft more intake line than in Part A. This is likely to have major cost impacts. 
If extreme waves were to hit at any tide of MSL + 1 or greater, an intake 198 ft seaward of MSL would 
already be safe from breaking waves. If probabilities and consequences of extreme waves are of serious 
concern, additional intake length and depth should be considered. 
Another trade-off is frictional losses in suction (intake) lines. From Table 6.2, this intake line has about 1.5 ft 
of head loss per 100 ft of pipe if clean, if biofouled it could be considerably greater. The pipe lengths 
seaward of MSL that have been discussed range from 198 to 312 ft. When the probable pipe lengths from 
MSL to the pump intakes are added, frictional losses may be of serious concern (see Section 6.4). For the 
longer distances, a larger pipe diameter may have to be considered, at obviously increased costs. The 
offshore lines and intakes are likely to be a very expensive part of the system and there are usually strong 
economic incentives to keep the lengths to an absolute minimum. 

239 
Example 19.3. Intake placement depth in region of high tidal range 
A seawater system (described in Examples 7.1, 7.2 and Fig. 7.5) has 575 ft of 6 in. intake pipe. The beach 
has a plunge point at about the MLW waterline as shown in Fig. 3.3. The MLW waterline is about 200 ft 
(pipe length) from the pumphouse and the beach slope is about 1:5 and the slope of the bottom seaward of 
MLW is 1:50. Assume a design high tide = MLW + 18' and a design low tide = MLW - 2'. Except for 
very improbable extreme events, wave action at this site is negligible, with a maximum wave height of 1 ft. 
(A) What is the minimum water depth at the intake during the design low tide? 
Offshore length from MLW- 575 - 200 -- 375,375/50 - -7.5 ft elevation per MLW 
Design low tide = MLW - 2, water depth = 7.5 - 2 = 5.5 ft minimum 
(B) Does your value above seem reasonable? Explain! 
See Fig. 4.3 for required components 
Operating point at design low tide (Fig. 7.5) -- 125 gpm 
Pipe average velocity (Table 6.2) = 1.5 ft/s (interpolation between 1.1 and 1.9 for 125 gpm) 
From Fig. 4.4, vortexing allowance -- 1.0 ft (extreme end of curve and approximate) 
From problem statement, wave allowance -- 1.0 ft 
If the intake is 1.5 ft above the bottom and it is screened with the top of the screen extending 1 ft 
above the intake, this leaves a minimum of 3 ft above the screen for passage of small boat traffic. 
Since all components seem reasonable based on available information, the answer is YES. 
(C) If the cost associated with installing this length of intake pipe (especially the underwater parts) is 
considered prohibitive but that pumping only half the time (MSL and above, MSL = MLW + 8) is 
considered acceptable due to availability of water storage, where should the intake be placed and what would 
be the minimum pipe length from the pumphouse? 
Since the intake length has changed, for accuracy all the calculations should be redone. However, it 
is possible to estimate the operating point at MSL from Fig. 7.5 of about 215 gpm resulting in an 
average velocity of 2.5 ft/s (Table 6.2). From Examples 7.1 and 7.2, at this flow rate, the suction 
side losses are well under 10% of the total head. With shorter pipes, these losses would be even 
smaller. It is therefore possible to use the available computations for estimating purposes. 
With a higher velocity, the vortexing allowance (Fig. 4.4) = 1.5 ft, the wave allowance is still -- 1.0 
ft, the bottom ingestion allowance still -- 1.5 ft and the small boat factor is meaningless (collision at 
lower tide becoming an accepted risk). In fact the intake is completely out of water for part of the 
tidal cycle, making cleaning and servicing very easy. 
Minimum water depth for pumping= (1.5 + 1.0 + 1.5) -- 4 ft 
Intake elevation -- MSL- 
4 ft 
Pipe length seaward of MSL= 4 x 5 = 20 ft (remembering that MSL is inshore of MLW and at a 
slope of 1:5) 
Pipe length MSL to pumphouse about 200 - 40 = 160 ft 
Pipe length pumphouse to intake= 160 + 20 -- 180 ft, down considerably from 575 ft 
Total length of intake piping saved 575 - 180 -- 395 ft (375 ft of it below MLW), a 65% reduction, 
and all of it in the relatively expensive low tidal and subtidal areas.

Example 19.4. Pump-system interactions and biofouling effects 
A system as shown is to pump seawater (35 ppt, 40~ 
Assume loss coefficients for intake screen K -- 5.0, 
undefined processing equipment K = 10.0 and discharge over tank K = 0. All piping is 6 in. ID plastic with 
500 ft suction length and 300 ft discharge. Assume a normal atmospheric pressure of 14.7 psi and a seawater 
vapor head = 0.28 ft. The system curves for both low and high tide have been calculated and superimposed 
over the pump curve for the selected pump and speed (1500 rpm) controller as given. Remember that the 
ONLY possible operating points are at the intersections of the pump and systems curves.

(A) At low low-water (MLW - 1), what is the flow rate and head across the pump? At high high-water 
(MLW + 6), what is the flow rate and head across the pump? 
Reading low water curve, Q = 1.0 ft3/s, head = 50 ft 
Reading high water curve, Q = 1.05 ft 3/s, head -- 45 ft 
(B) At low tide, what is the available NPSH? 
Atmospheric head = pressure/specific wt. seawater = (14.7)(144)/64.2 = 33 ft 
V = Q/A -- 1.0/0.196 = 5.1 ft/s 
Suction side frictional pipe losses, Eq. 6.2, but need to acquire input values 
Pipe equivalent sand roughness (Ks) from Table 6.3 = 4.2 x 10 -5 (for plastic pipe, relatively clean) 
Relative roughness= Ks/d = 0.00008 ('smooth') 
From Table A-3F, v = 1.7 • 10 -5 
Reynolds number= Re = Vd/v = (5.1)(0.5)/1.7 x 10 -5 = 1.5 x 10 -5 
Using Re and Ks~d, read f = 0.016 from Fig. 6.2 
Eq. 6.2, h = (0.016)(500)(5.1)2/(2)(32.2)(0.5) = 6.46 ft of suction side pipe losses 

241 
Example 19.4. (continued) 
Suction side frictional fittings losses, Eq. 6.6 (screen k = 5, given) and one 90 ~ elbow (Table 6.4) 
h = (5.0 + 0.28)((5.1)2/(2)(32.2)) -- 2.13 ft 
Total suction side losses= 6.46 § 2.13 -- 8.59 ft 
Eq. 7.1, available NPSH-- 33 - 13 - 8.59 - 0.28 -- 11.13 ft 
(C) If the pressure gauge on the suction side of the pump is a direct measure of available NPSH, what is its 
reading in psig? 
Eq. 6.1, absolute head -- 11.1 ft = absolute pressure/specific wt. Seawater = pressure/64.2 
Absolute pressure -- 714.5 lb/sq ft --- 4.96 psi 
Gauge pressure = 4.96 - 14.7 -- -9.7 psig; this is a partial vacuum (below atmospheric pressure) 
(D) For the low tide condition, does the system meet its suction side requirement and by what margin or 
deficit? 
At low tide operating point, read, required NPSH = 5.0 ft 
Available NPSH -- 11.1 ft, conditions of Eq. 7.2 are met by margin of 11.1 - 5.0 -- 6.1 ft margin 
(E) In specifying the system it is important to know the maximum pressure that can be seen in this system 
with the given pump and controller. What is this maximum pressure in psig? 
Maximum head = shut off head (Q = 0) -- 90 ft 
Eq. 6.1, 90 = pressure/64.2, pressure = 5778 lb/sq ft = 40.1 psig 
(F) After several months of use the flow at low tide has degraded to 0.65 ft 3/s due to biofouling. The suction 
side pressure gauge now reads -12 psig. All the loss coefficients and pipe roughness values previously used 
are no longer relevant and the low tide systems curve has shifted dramatically up and to the left. What is the 
biofouled head across the pump and the available NPSH at low tide? 
The 'new' systems curve is stated to intersect the pump curve at a Q = 0.65 ft 3/s, finding this point 
and reading the head -- 74 ft 
Available NPSH-- (14.7 - 12)(144)/64.2 -- 6.1 ft 
(G) Since the system is stated to be operable in the biofouled condition at low tide, it must meet its suction 
side NPSH requirements (Eq. 7.1), but what is the margin? 
At 'new' operating point, read required NPSH = 3.0 ft 
Margin -- 6.1 - 3 = 3.1 ft, kind of a slim margin 
(H) A major storm is approaching and it is expected to hit at low tide and have an atmospheric pressure of 
13.0 psig. Do you expect your biofouled system to be operable during the storm? 
Atmospheric head = pressure/specific wt. = (13.0)(144)/64.2 = 29.2 ft 
Available NPSH loss relative to normal pressure -- 33 - 29.2 -- 3.8 ft 
Margin of Part G is now deficit of 3.1 - 3.8 -- -0.7 ft 
SYSTEM NOT OPERABLE ~ due to the conservative nature of the process, this system might in fact 
still operate but you cannot count on it 

242 
Example 19.4. (continued) 
(I) It is necessary in defining the system to specify the minimum power rating of the pump motor. This is 
normally done for the high tide condition as this is usually the greater requirement for centrifugal pumps. 
The power going into the water is called the water power. Assume that the system has been cleaned of 
biofouling and the original flow conditions restored and the pump has an efficiency of 60%. What is the 
required horsepower into the pump (pump brake power)? 
Operating point for high tide from Part A 
h = 45 ft, Q = 1.05 ft3/s 
Water power = (specific weight)(flow rate)(head across pump) = (64.2)(1.05)(45) = 3033 ft-lb/s 
Converting ft-lb/s to horsepower =3033/550 = 5.5 horsepower 
Pump brake power = water power/pump efficiency - 5.5/0.6 - 9.2 horsepower 
(J) Assuming that the pump efficiency does not change appreciably, will the required brake power be more or 
less for the biofouled conditions of Part F and what is the value? What minimum motor rating would you 
recommend for this system? 
Operating points from Part F, Q = 0.65 ft 3/s, h = 74 ft 
Water power--(64.2)(0.65)(74) = 3088 ft-lb/s 
3088/550 = 5.6 horsepower 
Brake power = 5.6/0.6 = 9.4 horsepower, 1/5 horsepower more when biofouled 
Specify minimum installed horsepower -- 10 hp 
Example 19.5. Outdoor wet lab design 
You want to design a summer outdoor wet lab for research and/or educational purposes at the corner of a 
pier or dock. The allocated area is 65 ft long on the seaward end of the pier by 30 ft on the side for a total of 
about 2000 ft 2. The hard asphalt surface is 5 ft above mean water and the maximum normal tidal elevations 
are mean water +2 ft. The water depths off the edges of the pier are both 7 ft at low tide. The average water 
temperature during the planned 3-months test period is about 70~ (34 g/kg salinity) and the water quality at 
this site is expected to be adequate and acceptable for the duration of project. Since there are no special 
system-wide water processing requirements, the seawater system is to be a straightforward supply, 
distribution and drain system. Any special needs will be met at the points of application and electric power is 
needed for these purposes. The program is expected to include four separate but related projects, each with 
about four students. The total system biomass is expected to be a maximum of about 40 lb of small marine 
animals (species and sizes not known). 
(A) Define the required seawater system flow rate. 
Using Fig. 2.7C (research criteria), 70~ 
5 g animals (worst case, larger animals would be less 
constraining) 
Conservatively estimate loading --- 0.4 lb/gpm 
For 40 lb biomass means design flow rate of 100 gpm

(B) Define and layout the system components, including intake and discharge locations and on-site seawater 
distribution pattern. Size and specify pipes and other seawater system components. Estimate required parts

Other system components 
9 Head tank, any available synthetic material, 3 min minimum residence time = 40 ft 3, three 
threaded taps with thread to hose adapters (2 in. drain at bottom, 3 in. overflow at top, 3 in. 
supply, mid-depth on tank). 
9 Centrifugal pump to deliver 100 gpm at estimated TDH of about 30 ft. Pump's shutoff head must 
be well below 225 ft (100 psi rating of piping system), conservatively about 1.5 hp required. 
9 Screen with 0.1 ft/s through screen velocity, at 100 gpm (0.22 ft3/s) need 2.2 ft 2 of open area on 
screen, with expanded metal of 60% open area will need about 3.7 ft 2 of screen face. 
9 Power distribution panel, pump may require voltage above 120 VAC, increasing on site risks. 
Distribution of 120 VAC will probably be required for individual projects, moveable outdoor 
boxes with GFI can be used if care is taken. Do not underestimate the electrical hazard. A central 
or several smaller moveable electrical compressors for aeration may provide a valuable backup 
capability. 
9 If available, a small portable shelter or trailer provides many practical benefits. 
(D) Discuss the major factors leading to your choices of layout and system specification. 
9 Intake and discharge were as widely separated as possible. The intake was placed on the seaward 
side, with the best circulation. The discharge was placed on the side of the pier, which on some 
part of the tide is likely to have eddies and collect floating debris. This is not a perfect 
arrangement as short-circuiting may occur under some conditions. A factor would be if the pier 
is solid or supported by pilings. 
9 Three supply pipes versus three for drainage and selection of 4 in. for drain is due to more 
critical gravity flow situation for drains. Selection of fragile thin-walled PVC drain pipe is due to 
considerations of cost and availability. Thin PVC can crack, especially at low temperatures but 
not likely in this application. The drain piping should be protected from physical damage by 
placing wood on each side of the pipe connected by strapping across the top. 
9 As shown, the wet lab area is divided into four equal working areas. If more information was 
available about individual requirements, the area allocations could be somewhat altered without 
to many problems. 
9 Many of the components have been specified as made of any available plastic. This is due to an 
expected lack of relevant toxicity data specific to the culture organisms, high flow rates to dilute 
toxic materials and practical aspects of cost and availability. All materials should be adequately 
leached in seawater before use and materials choices (when they exist) should consider risks of 
toxicity (see Section 8.1). 

245 
Example 19.6. Seawater supply channel for shrimp farm 
Evaluate the following shrimp farm water influent seawater supply system. The discharge channels are not 
shown. The farm draws seawater from a shallow protected estuary, where currents and waves produce a 
considerable amount of suspended solids. The sediment concentration does vary over the tidal cycle. The 
sediment concentration used in this example can be assumed to be a long-term average. The sediment 
concentrations during a storm event could be 10-20 times higher, but it is likely that the pumps would be 
shut down under these conditions. The first part of the supply channel acts as a sedimentation channel. With 
the systems information provided, compute the water requirement, installed pump capacity, sediment 
production, and water elevation in the supply channel. A Mud Cat is an amphibious unit developed for 
working in the bayous of the U.S. Gulf Coast. It is commonly fitted with a suction dredge.

(G) Compute the water surface elevation at the first and last supply point assuming that all the flow is 
supplied to the last set of pond. 
First supply point: 
Elevation of bottom = 2.10 m - (0.00001 x 150 m) -- 2.10 m 
Water surface elevation -- 2.10 m -4- 0.562 m -- 2.66 m 
Last supply point: 
Elevation of bottom = 2.10 m - 0.00001 x [15 x (300 m + 15 m) + 150] = 2.05 m 
Water surface elevation = 2.05 m -4- 0.562 m = 2.61 m 
Note that there is only a head loss of 5 cm (2 inches) between the first and last ponds. Therefore, this supply 
channel functions more like a constant head tank than an open channel. Difference in water surface elevation 
in the supply channel due to wind can be in the order of several inches. 
(H) Assuming that 70% of the remaining suspended materials will uniformly settle in the ponds, compute the 
average water depth of the ponds after 5 years of operation.

Summary Commandments 
The following are a list of basic guidelines and rules for maximizing the probability of 
success with seawater culture systems. They have been gained from experience. 
9 Take great care in quantifying the requirements, as they will greatly affect the complexity 
and cost of the system. 
9 Consider long-term as well as short-term requirements, even though they are more difficult 
to quantify. 
9 Major cost underestimates are more likely to result from necessary but uncounted compo- 
nents and services or increased requirements rather than errors in specific items. 
9 The initial cost estimates of in-water components, such as intakes and discharges, are 
usually greatly under estimated. 
9 The proper bioengineering of the seawater system is usually the essential core of the 
projects of which they are a part. When dealing with architects and money people who are 
trying to reduce the capital costs, it is important to remind them that if the system fails it 
will not make any difference how much money was saved or how beautiful the building. If 
they cannot afford to build it fight, the cost of doing it wrong is considerably greater. 
9 Due to the many critical interactions between life support requirements, site factors/ele- 
vations and seawater system design, the seawater system should be designed and laid out 
first, and then the building designed around it. It should be considered as a seawater system 
with a building rather then a building with a seawater system in it. Unfortunately, the 
architectural design is usually well ahead of the seawater system in the design process, 
often creating many serious incompatibility problems late in the process when trying to 
'fit' the seawater system into the building. 
9 Aquatic life support requirements are fixed by physical, environmental and biological laws, 
and not by management, budgetary or human schedules or dictates. 
9 Consider operating approaches and procedures before the design is fixed. Significant input 
from operational personnel is needed in the design and construction phases. 
9 Demands for services (seawater, compresses air, etc.) usually increase in quantity and 
quality with time. If possible, provide extra floor space, access to piping, access to drains 
and provisions for electrical power for potential anticipated future retrofits. 
9 Remember that the key to low risk and high performance systems is large amounts of 
high quality seawater. In short, maintain very conservative biomass loading relative to the 
available water quality. If a system is working well, increasing the biomass will increase 
the risks. 
9 Anticipate probable failures and plan accordingly to minimize the consequences. 
9 Water flows downhill. The design and layout of the seawater system on a specific 
site involves numerous and diverse considerations, many of a nontechnical nature and 
independent of the seawater system requirements. Trying to circumvent this gravitational 
fact will lead to considerably greater system complexity, cost and risk. 

250 
9 Provide redundant equipment to back up critical functions in emergencies. Resist tempta- 
tion to use backup equipment in normal operations just because it is available. 
9 Responsibilities and decision-making procedures for emergencies should be decided before 
crises occur, remembering that they rarely occur at convenient times. 
9 Do not forget routine maintenance and inventorying necessary spare parts when operations 
are going well; it is twice as important when things are not going well. 
9 Be extremely careful in selecting all materials and supplies used in and around seawater 
systems, because your organisms may be very sensitive and seawater is very corrosive. 
Do not forget to include the surrounding building and paints, sprays, cleaners, sealers and 
solvents used near culture organisms. 
9 Leach all materials in running seawater for at least two weeks before use. 
9 Take great care with all fittings, pipes and equipment on the suction side of pumps to avoid 
even the most minute air leak. Supersaturation can easily kill. 
9 Make the suction-side lines as large in diameter and as short as possible to minimize 
suction-side frictional losses. 
9 Never try to save money by reducing the size of pipes or fittings on the suction side of 
main pumps. This is sure to be false economy and to lead to major long-term problems and 
constraints. 
9 Place pressure gauges on both the suction and discharge side of pumps to monitor the 
condition of the lines and the performance of the pumps. Watch for biofouling, especially 
on the suction side. Service regularly. 
9 Adequately pitch all floors in wet-lab areas towards the drains remembering that concrete 
may shrink on drying. 
9 Greatly oversize drains to take high transient flows. Drains can never be too large. Even the 
largest drains will occasionally clog if not maintained. 
9 Expect very high suspended solids content in incoming seawater from shallow water 
intakes during storms or heavy waves. Solids will accumulate wherever the flow velocity 
drops. 
9 Anticipate the need to remove accumulated sediment and debris from any parts of the 
system with low flow velocities. 
9 Bury or otherwise make inaccessible as little of the system as possible. The inaccessible 
parts are inevitably the parts you will want to get at later. 
9 Place all electrical outlets up high, above any unintentional water input. 
9 Use ground fault interrupters on all indoor and outdoor electrical outlets. Do not underesti- 
mate the electrical hazards associated with seawater. 
9 Inspect and service intake screens regularly. 
9 Be careful in locating the intakes. They should not be situated so as to pick up debris, 
recycle drain water or ever experience breaking waves. Do not underestimate the forces of 
the sea on intakes and other exposed structures. 
9 Remember that the piping/processing system and the pumps are highly interactive. 
Changes in either area will affect the other. 
9 In wet-lab and mechanical areas use 'X' fittings with blanked faces where 'L's and 'T's are 
needed. This maximizes accessibility for cleaning and future modifications. 
9 If you are on call, do not place on automatic alarm any functions or events that can wait 
until normal working hours.

9 In a field with so much misleading or incomplete information, data voids, 'experts' and 
variations in conditions, it is worth remembering when dealing with the unknown or 
uncertain that one test, under the actual conditions to be encountered, may be worth a 
thousand expert opinions. 
9 Lighten up! This is an interesting field. You could be designing activated sludge plants or 
water distribution piping in Kansas.

A-2 Definitions 
The following terms have been selected for definition based on an assumption of a 
broad-based readership. Terms that might be common in one discipline might be quite 
confusing to someone from another. In particular, it includes both commonly encountered 
biological and engineering terminology. 
TABLE A-2 
Definitions 
Acute toxicity. A short-term exposure sufficient to result in death or severe injury to an organism, generally based 
on 50% mortality. 
Absorption. The taking up of matter in bulk by another matter, as in the dissolving of a gas in a liquid. 
Adsorption. The adhesion at the molecular level of a gas, solute or liquid to the surfaces of a solid body or liquid. 
Aerobic. Pertaining to the presence or need for oxygen. 
Air stripping. See foam fractionation. 
Anaerobic. The absence or a requirement for absence of oxygen. 
Anode. The more electronegative of two or more electrically conductive materials in electrical contact with each 
other. 
Backflushing. A cleaning or rejuvenating reverse flow of a fluid, which often is, but does not have to be, of the 
same type as in the normal flow direction. Most commonly, a reverse flow of seawater through a piece of 
equipment to remove accumulated solids and debris. 
Backwashing. Same as backflushing. 
Biofilter. Unit with high internal surface area used for biological oxidation or reduction of organic compounds. The 
aerobic oxidation of ammonia to nitrate (nitrification) is the most common process. 
Biofouling. Biological growth on materials and equipment placed in seawater. It is highly variable in its 
composition and intensity.

The cathode will be some equipment or structure which one wishes to protect from corrosion. 
Cavitation. When local pressure falls below the vapor pressure of a flowing liquid, it will flash to vapor. When 
these bubbles move on and encounter a higher pressure, they are no longer in equilibrium and will suddenly 
collapse. If these bubbles are in contact with a solid surface when they collapse, they will generate small areas of 
very high pressure, possibly sufficient to crater the surface. A very noisy and destructive process that can happen in 
pumps if they are operated under improper conditions.

and in sheets or shapes. Commonly used in water piping systems. Schedule 80 pipe has thicker walls for threaded 
applications (usually gray colored) and Schedule 40 for solvent welded joints (usually white) and other classes for 
drainage applications. CPVC (chlorinated PVC) is a variation with better properties at higher temperatures and is 
commonly used in hot water piping applications. 
Rearing unit. A container in which the organisms are held during the culture process. This may include tanks, 
raceways and ponds.

particle stays within the unit and is a measure of water exchange rate. Same as detention time. 
Reuse. Similar to recycling, but sometimes limited to only aeration. 
Reuse ratio. Comparison of the flows needed to satisfy two specific water quality parameters (i.e., 
Qoxygen/Qammonia). If the ratio is larger than 1, more flow is needed to satisfy the parameter in the numerator.

Significant wave height. The average height of the highest third of the waves in a given wave spectrum. Storm 
wave information usually presented as a significant wave height and it correlates well with the estimates of 
experienced mariners. This height can be used to calculate the height of higher and rarer waves, such as the 
average of the highest 1%. 
Specific speed. Non-dimensional parameter used under given conditions to determine the suitability of different 
types of pumps. 
Specific weight. The density of a fluid in units of weight (force)/unit volume, generally expressed as lb/ft 3, N/m 3

initial equipment activation or to any activation. Procedures the first time may be much more elaborate and 
controlled than subsequent startups. 
Stocking density. The number or biomass of culture organisms per unit area or volume (lb/ft 2, lb/ft 3, kg/m 2 or 
kg/m3). 
Storm surge. Increased tidal elevations due to storm winds and low atmospheric pressure. Wind directions 
encountered relative to the local geography are critical.

is also equal to the head across the pump. 

TABLE A-2 (continued) 
269 
TDS. Total dissolved solids. This is a measure of the total concentration of dissolved solids and involves removable 
of settleable and suspended solids and evaporation of know volume of water to constant weight at a specified 
temperature. TDS is not equal to salinity, although the two parameters can be expressed in the same units and both 
measure dissolved solids. 
Turbidi~.. Reduced clarity or light transmittance of water caused by suspended particles and organic matter. 
Turnover rate. The volumetric flow to a unit divided by the volume of the unit, with units of 1/time. It is the 
inverse of residence (detention) time. 
Viscosity. Is the proportionality between the force required to shear a fluid and the time rate of strain. In short, the 
'stickiness' of the fluid, which will vary significantly with temperature. There are two viscosity parameters 
commonly encountered. One is the kinematic viscosity and the other is the dynamic (absolute) viscosity. The 
kinematic viscosity is equal to the dynamic viscosity divided by the mass density of the fluid. 
Water hammer. Momentum of flowing fluid produces transient pressure pulse due to rapid stopping or altering of 
fluid flow. These pressure pulses can be very destructive to piping systems.

Append& B 
Flow-through Seawater System Bibliography 
Since it is unlikely that there exists any pure flow-through system, in the sense that there 
is absolutely no internal water reconditioning, selection of references is somewhat subjective. 
Appendix B contains those that are primarily flow-through while Appendix C has those with 
significant internal water processing and reuse. There are several overlaps of citations. 
Most of the information available on the design, construction and operation of flow-through 
seawater systems is from academies and research oriented groups. The literature is, therefore, 
not representative of relative use or common systems' characteristics. Table B-1 lists a 
selection of the available literature and much of this, unfortunately, is from not readily 
available sources. Considering the large numbers of flow-through systems in use, the literature 
is rather meager. The published systems tend to be more complex and more expensive than the 
majority of existing systems, which tend to be simpler and more straightforward. However, 
this is not true of some of the commercial systems, which can be quite sophisticated. Literature 
on commercial systems, mostly bivalve and shrimp hatcheries, would be of considerable value, 
if more of it were available.

Appendix C 
Reuse Seawater System Bibliography 
Since most seawater systems have some internal water reconditioning and some flow- 
through rate, the labels of 'reuse' and 'flow-through' are not mutually exclusive. While 
systems often tend to one side or the other, there is in fact a continuum of possibilities 
and much of the equipment and processes are shared. Appendix B contains literature that is 
slanted towards systems having modest internal water reconditioning and Appendix C towards 
systems with more extensive water recycling and reuse. Because of equipment commonality 
or mixed content, some particularly good references (Clark and Clark, 1964; Spotte, 1979; 
Hawkins, 1981; Lawson, 1992) are included in both appendices. 
A lot of the early experience with reuse systems has been with freshwater. This is due to 
frequently encountered terrestrial freshwater shortages or limitations. If one is located near 
the sea, acquiring good quality and quantity seawater has in the past rarely been a problem. 
Coastal pollution and coastal water and land use constraints in many cases are dramatically 
changing this situation. This is a fast moving technology and a great deal of progress has 
been made since the first edition of this book. However, the majority of this work is still in 
freshwater. While the principles, equipment and procedures are the same in freshwater and 
seawater, there are some differences in species and in biochemistry. Many review articles do 
not clearly differentiate between the two environments and some of these are included in the 
bibliography. Generally a little seawater, if it is acceptable to the culture organism, makes the 
system more stable and makes management a little easier. Selection of references has been 
loaded towards seawater applications and many otherwise good information sources have been 
excluded. Some of the selected references deal with low salinity brackish water applications 
and are, therefore, considered to be using seawater. 
There are a number of good books and proceedings that include many very good papers. If 
the books or proceedings are cited below, the individual contained papers of particular merit 
are not specifically identified. They will, however, be specifically referenced in the text of 
Chapter 15.

Appendix D 
Water Quality Bibliography 
Water quality criteria for various types of culturing systems may be quite different from 
those used for environmental protection. This is primarily due to the fact that environmental 
protection criteria are based on protection of a wide spectrum of species and life stages. 
Most culture systems contain only a single species or several closely related species and 
usually for only a limited part of the life cycle. Generally the order of decreasing severity in 
water-quality criteria are larval cultures, brood stock, aquariums, commercial grow-out and 
lastly holding facilities. Economic considerations may also heavily influence the selection 
of water quality criteria. Water quality criteria are best documented for freshwater fish, 
such as salmon, trout, and channel catfish. Less information is available for marine species, 
especially crustaceans and molluscs. Table D-1 contains selected references on the effects of 
environmental parameters on marine organisms and water quality criteria. The available data 
is far from complete in this important subject area.

Appendix E 
Biof ouling Bibliography 
Biofouling and its control is an important factor in the operation of many seawater-culturing 
systems, especially for flow-through systems. Biofouling can occur wherever there is flowing 
raw seawater, including in piping, heat exchangers and on screens. In spite of its importance, 
there is very little literature directly associated with culturing purposes. What does exist is 
mostly related to tray culturing of shellfish, where biofouling can be a serious problem. Many 
coastal seawater using industrial activities, other than culturing applications, have similar 
biofouling problems. However, they usually do not have the biological and toxicity constraints 
of culturing systems and as a result have more biofouling-control options. 
This bibliography includes the modest available directly associated literature. It also 
includes a few selected references on biofouling mechanisms and on control measures used 
in other marine applications. There has been considerable recent progress in understanding 
the biochemical nature of biofouling and in developing non-toxic antifouling coatings. All 
this information must be used with some caution in aquacultural applications. Biofouling 
is highly variable in quantity and composition depending on site, season and a number of 
other factors. In addition, control methods themselves may impose risks or constraints on the 
culture organisms.

Appendix F 
Materials Bibliography 
Materials selection for culturing purposes is a difficult and complex subject. There are 
two sets of constraints in selecting materials. One is from interactions of the materials 
with seawater resulting in deterioration or structural failure. The second involves biological 
acceptability of the materials to the culture organisms. Lack of biological acceptability is 
usually in the form of toxicity of the materials. Table F-1 contains information on both aspects 
of materials selection, although most documentation on biological acceptability is concerned 
with small-scale laboratory equipment and containers. 
General information on the physical and chemical properties of marine materials is well 
documented. These data should be used with some caution in culturing applications, as 
biological acceptability is usually not considered. Cost and availability will further limit the 
use of some of the more desirable materials. Documentation on the biological acceptability 
of materials is limited and sometimes in apparent conflict. The contradictions are often due 
to differences in test procedures, target species or variations in materials' composition. The 
composition of plastics, rubbers and polymers can vary widely between manufacturers and 
between batches from the same manufacturer. Changes in composition often occur without 
any notice. Published data should only be used as a guide in materials' selection. Bioassay 
tests with pre-leached material samples based on actual culture conditions and material lots 
should be carried out. Bioassays are usually carried out with the earliest life stages of the 
culture species, because they are usually the most sensitive to toxicity and are the easiest to 
test. 
In systems with high flow-through rates, economic or availability considerations may 
result in the satisfactory use of materials generally not considered acceptable in marine 
culturing applications. In contrast, special care should be taken with materials for static or 
reuse systems, as they are the most sensitive to problems of biological acceptability and will 
tend to accumulate some toxic substances. As general good practice, all materials should be 
adequately leached in seawater before use to reduce the risks. Even acceptable materials may 
have high initial toxicity due to surface coatings or leachable solvents. A change in conditions 
may make an acceptable material highly toxic. As examples, removing surface coatings or 
dramatic increases in temperature has lead to mass mortalities. Mass mortalities or chronic 
effects due to materials are often not identifiable from other possible sources of stress on the 
culture organisms.

Suspended Solids Removal Bibliography 
Suspended solids removal is a common process in many seawater systems. This includes 
removal of solids from influent water and/or removal of uneaten feed or fecal matter within 
the system. Information on the many options used in culturing is usually buried in publications 
concerned with the larger total system. Much of this information is included in Appendices 
B and C, with solids removal, filtration or related equipment mentioned in the title or 
annotations. 
Three common processes for removal of solids in culturing applications are sedimentation, 
screening, and filtration. Sedimentation is the settling of solids through time in a low-flow 
velocity condition. The distinction between screening and filtering is not always clear, 
although screening usually refers to the use of meshes and the removal of larger-size 
particles while filtering implies the use of granular mediums. In spite of the importance and 
commonality of solids removal processes, there is little directly applicable data dealing with 
marine culturing applications. Table G-1 includes references from a number of areas that 
might prove useful as a starting point for further investigations.

Appendix H 
Temperature Control Bibliography 
Controlling culture-water temperature is a very common process in many seawater systems. 
This is particularly true of reuse systems, because of their greatly reduced inflow rates. They 
can more readily retain the heat (or lack of) and thereby greatly reduce the energy costs. Both 
heating and cooling systems are found, although heating requirements are more common. 
Most of the available information on such systems are contained in publications which 
describe the broader systems and not just the heating or cooling aspects. Many of these 
references can be found in Appendix B (Flow-Through Systems) and Appendix C (Reuse 
Systems). Many of the titles or 'comments' in regards to these references specifically mention 
temperature control in the context of these applications. Culture-water temperature is a 
parameter that is often automatically monitored and controlled. Also, see discussion and 
general references in this subject area (Section 14.3). These citations will not be repeated here. 
Instead, selected literature that specifically addresses temperature control or was otherwise 
not selected for the other appendices will be presented. Since salinity has little effect on 
the heating and cooling of water, freshwater citations are also included. Some freshwater 
equipment may not be useable in seawater without modifications, due to corrosion or 
contamination problems.

Aeration and Degassing Bibliography 
The removal or addition of dissolved gases is commonly required in aquatic-culture 
systems. This may include oxygen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, or hydrogen sulfide. The 
commonest types of aerators are diffused aerators and airlift pumps. These units are easy to 
install and operate, but have relatively poor gas-transfer characteristics. In many applications, 
these units are used primarily to provide gentle mixing for algal or larval cultures. 
Due to the needs for high dissolved oxygen concentrations to support the respiration of 
aquatic animals, the transfer efficiencies of aerators in aquacultural applications is generally 
low. The required concentrations of dissolved oxygen are often at or near the solubility limit 
in water under the existing conditions. Some of the most efficient submerged aerators, due 
to the hydrostatic pressure of depth, can produce lethal concentrations of gas supersaturation 
with nitrogen from the air. Considerably more information is available on the use and design 
of aerators for freshwater applications than for seawater applications. Fortunately, much of 
this freshwater information is directly applicable to marine conditions, although corrosion 
problems may limit the use of some floating and submerged aerators. Aerator references 
applicable to marine applications are also included in Table I-1. These citations are divided 
into design and four categories of aerators by type. 
The following conversions may be helpful in sizing aeration systems. 
lb oxygen/hp per hour x 1.664 
= 
kg oxygen/kW per hour 
lb oxygen per foot of paddle wheel per hour x 1.491 
-- 
kg/m per hour 
Information on gas supersaturation and degassing is contained in Table I-2. These citations 
are divided into production, measurement of supersaturation and design of degassing systems. 
Since some equipment is used for both aerating and degassing, both Tables I-1 and I-2 should 
be consulted.

Efficient submerged aerators can create lethal levels of

some operating conditions. 
Cod may develop this condition in saturated water due to 
malfunctioning of the choroid gland-pseudobranch 
complex. 
Condition occurs spontaneously in five species of rock-fish 
held in aquaria. Bubble formation in choroidal rete 
mirabile was one of several mechanisms discussed. 
Air leaks on suction side of pump resulted in high level of 
supersaturation and mass mortality. 
Dissolution of air appears to be about 10 times faster in 
seawater than in freshwater. Small air leaks in marine 
systems maybe much more dangerous and difficult to 
detect as no bubbles may be present in the discharge water. 
Photosynthetic production of oxygen in 'greenwater' 
culture may result in gas-bubble disease in larval mullet. 
Gas-bubble disease developed in marine fish and shrimp 
held in heated effluents. Problem occurred primarily during 
winter. Degassing will be needed to use power plant 
effluents in aquaculture. 
Solar heating plus photosynthesis at times produced 
dissolved gas pressures sufficient to cause gas-bubble 
trauma in fish held in shallow aquariums. 
Intense photosynthesis during periods of light wind may 
result in supersaturation high enough to kill adult fish in 
shallow water.

Disinfection Bibliography 
Disinfection is the reduction in the concentration or number of viable pathogenic mi- 
croorganisms present. Sterilization is the complete elimination of microorganisms. In aquatic 
systems, ozone, ultraviolet radiation, and chemical treatments are the most common means for 
disinfection. The efficacy of a particular method will generally depend on the concentration 
of the particular agent, the decay rate, contact time, temperature, the specific pathogenic 
organisms, and often other environmental factors. Even though the culture organisms are 
rarely present during treatment (exceptions include marine mammals and fish eggs), the 
toxicity of the disinfectant itself, its residues and possible side effects on the culture organisms 
must also be seriously considered. Treatments are usually in the flow lines before the culture 
tanks or in a recirculating loop. Problems caused by the treatments may be subtle and occur 
at concentrations below the detection limits of available analytical equipment. Sterilization 
requires either strong chemicals or high temperatures and pressures, and is mostly used on 
equipment such as nets, tanks and handling devices to preclude the transmission of diseases; 
however, sometimes there is still the possibility of residues effecting the culture organisms. 
Basic references on disinfection and sterilization in aquatic systems are presented in 
Table J- 1.

Appendix K 
Culture Unit Shape, Size and Flow Pattern~Hydraulics 
Bibliography 
There are many kinds of culture units. These can include tanks, raceways and ponds in a 
wide variety of configurations and sizes. These culture units are usually specific to a particular 
purpose or type of organism and have generally evolved over time in actual practice. An 
important factor that is often not fully appreciated is that the culture unit configuration is also 
dependent on scale. Dramatic changes in scale for equipment from previous practice can be 
very risky, even if the purposes and organisms are the same. Hydraulics of culture units can 
be very non-linear. In addition, culture units that have been satisfactory in previous practice 
can prove to be unsatisfactory if the objectives or conditions of utilization are changed. An 
example is a switch from research to commercial criteria. In spite of these caveats, previous 
practice can be a useful guide. 
Considering the extensive experience with many types of culture units, there are relatively 
little published data concerning the equipment itself. Most of what exists is abbreviated and 
buried in 'Equipment and Methods' sections of papers primarily concerned with other matters. 
Table K-1 includes selected references that deal primarily or in part with the culture unit 
characteristics. Salinity is not a significant factor in unit hydraulics; therefore, this Appendix 
should be useful for both freshwater and marine applications. 
There has been significant progress in this topic area since the 1st edition. Many of these 
developments have been motivated by post-use regulatory waste removal requirements. Solid 
waste problems can be greatly reduced if the settleable solids (feces and uneaten food) can 
be separated from the main discharge and handled with as little entrained water as possible. 
Labor requirements associated with cleaning of large units is also of major concern, especially 
for commercial applications. This has focused attention on culture unit hydraulics.

Feeder Bibliography 
Most of the data on feeding practices are species specific. Much of it is contained in 
papers concerned primarily with the nutritional aspects. The vast majority of available data 
is on freshwater species, mostly catfish and trout. Relatively little is available on commercial 
feeding practices even for important freshwater applications. Commercial culturists, by and 
large, do not publish and the little that is available about commercial operations is primarily 
from academies and related agricultural (aquatic) experiment stations. 
This leaves the marine culturist with relatively little practical data although salinity should 
not be a significant factor. Table L-1 provides what information is available. It concentrates 
on feeding processes and survey papers. There has been no attempt to present species-specific 
data, which can often be found in the appropriate species literature. The intent has been 
to present the procedural and equipment information. An interesting development since the 
first edition is in the area of hydroacoustic sensors to shut-off feeding when uneaten feed 
is detected. These have been adopted for cage, pond and tank culturing. Also included are 
several references on developing techniques that show promise for practical use in culturing 
operations. 
There does exist some data on feeding devices of various kinds. Most of these are for 
small-scale use in research, hatcheries or larval rearing. Again, most are from academic or 
research oriented sources and for freshwater species. However, the feeds for marine species 
and those for freshwater are very similar and often identical in their characteristics. Such an 
example is with the use of brine shrimp, the equipment should be common and a selected 
bibliography is presented in Table L-2. Table L-2 concentrates on equipment and operations. 
The two feed forms best represented in the table are dry-pellet or flake, and live-zooplankton 
feeds. Delivery systems for other common possibilities, such as ground natural feeds and 
moist pellets, are poorly represented in the available literature.

Appendix M 
Indexes for Equipment and Supplies 
Since the first edition a number of sizable catalog companies specializing in aquacultural 
equipment and supplies have emerged. While manufacturers specializing in aquacultural 
equipment and supplies are increasing in numbers, much is still acquired and sometimes 
modified from other fields of endeavor. Some of these areas with crossover capabilities include 
wastewater treatment, agriculture and marine oceanographic/industrial pursuits. Another 
promising area, on the lower end of the flow-rate range, are the catalog stores. Many have 
'industrial supply' or 'ranch and suburban' catalogs and are a relatively inexpensive source 
of plastic pipe, fittings, tanks and many other useful items. Inexpensive cast-iron pumps from 
industrial or farm catalogs, if the rusting can be tolerated, can give up to a few years of 
continuous service, even in seawater. Adopting equipment or supplies from other applications 
often includes risks and should be done with some care. As a general rule, the broader 
the application for a piece of equipment, the cheaper, the more reliable and the easier to 
replace, repair and service. Unless the requirements clearly demand it, custom designed 
and manufactured equipment should be avoided. Many of these catalog companies, both 
aquaculture-specialized and not, now have their catalogs on the web. 
National, regional and international aquaculture conferences often are associated with 
trade shows where equipment manufacturers exhibit their products. If they can be attended, 
these shows are a quick and easy means of acquiring a lot of information on availability, 
performance and costs of equipment. Similarly, there are a number of aquacultural magazines 
and newsletters that routinely carry equipment advertisements, which can form a starting point 
for gathering information. 
Listed in the following are a number of periodical indexes of equipment and supplies by 
type and manufacturer that might be useful. Some also list services, information sources, 
consultants and other types of data. Only one annual so far is specific to aquatic culturing 
applications (Aquaculture Magazine Annual Buyers Guide) but most of its content is primarily 
for freshwater applications. However, it does also have excellent contact information, at least 
for the U.S., for extension services, regional aquaculture centers, Sea Grant Programs and 
educational institutions involved with aquaculture.

AquaSearch, The Aquaculture and Seafood Directory. This one is only on the web. One 
of the 18 subject categories on its introduction page is EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS; under 
the aquaculture subsection are listed 44 suppliers. Many of these have on-line equipment 
catalogs. Another subject category is EQUIPMENT with an index containing 41 alphabetized 
types of equipment. Each of these equipment types lists from one to many suppliers. This 
equipment also covers seafood processing and fishery applications in addition to aquaculture.

Appendix N 
Computer Data Search 
Appendix M contains leads for finding equipment, supplies and services. In contrast, this 
Appendix N is intended primarily to provide some guidance for acquiring scientific and 
technical data, although there is considerable overlap. This predominantly means finding 
pertinent technical papers and reports. Many of these data are species specific. Finding this 
material is rapidly becoming computer-based in contrast to the older library search techniques 
of progressing from the bibliography of one reference to find others. For some potential data 
sources, it is difficult to separate this search for technical data from an inundation of public 
relations and commercial information. However, contact with knowledgeable individuals (if 
they will talk to you) is still the fastest and surest way to finding the best published data 
available. Unfortunately, especially in areas of commercial aquaculture, a lot of the best and 
most current data may not be published at all. This is particularly true were efficiency of 
processes, operating techniques and procedures are involved. 
Many of the more interesting databases for technical and scientific literature are paid (li- 
censed) services intended primarily for the libraries of academic and research institutions. For 
example, the University of Washington lists 360 separate databases (www.lib.washington.lib). 
About 50% of the databases are contractually restricted to faculty, students, and staff, or 
to persons physically present in the University libraries. The non-restricted databases can 
be accessed by anyone with web access. For university staff, students, and others using the 
library, all of these databases are free to the user, so a drive to a research library is an 
economical approach to many data searches. Most of the licensed databases are probably cost 
prohibitive for individuals or small companies. However, many offer a free trial period of 
usually a month. 
Most searches allow the user to save the search information on a floppy disk, or e-mail the 
search to the user. The vast majority of these data bases, but not yet all, have web access. They 
offer abstracts and often full text services. Full text accessibility is increasing rapidly but is 
currently a modest fraction of the total. 
The computer data search is in a rapid state of change. This appendix is certain to be 
quickly dated. It is intent only to provide the reader with an entry into the myriad interlinked 
sources available. Good hunting! 
N. 1 Traditional fee-based searches 
This type of literature search has been available for 15-20 years. A given computer service 
bureau commonly provides access to 10-20 specialized databases. Generally, the search is 
completed by a research librarian in consultation with the user. The user is billed individually 
for the cost of the search (dependent on the number of citations found and the degree of 
information printed). This type of search may still be available for some databases, but 

323 
the vast majority of databases are licensed to large institutions and accessed through the 
web. 
N.2 Internet sources 
The organization of internet aquaculture sites is complex and rapidly changing. Many 
commercial sites offer a large amount of free information. The most important parts of some 
sites are their links to other sites. All internet search engines (Yahoo, Excite, Altavisa, etc.) 
allow the user to bookmark a site. This places a copy of the site's internet address in a 
'Favorites' folder and allows an easy return to the site in the future. 
N.2.1 Governmental sites (and sites with a lot of free information) 
Alternative Farming Systems Information Center, Aquaculture-Related Internet Sites and 
Documents. This is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's aquaculture web site. It has a 
strong U.S. orientation but never the less has many links to other aquaculture organizations 
worldwide. It has an alphabetized directory, including a lot more than literature (organizations, 
career information, etc.). It has about 230 links. Home page: http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/ 
aqua/aquasite.htm#Sites; E-mail: afsaqua@nal.usda.gov 
Aquaculture (Norway). This site is primarily for Norway although it has many links 
to other aquaculture organizations worldwide. It lists companies, research organizations 
(including SINTEF and MARINTEK), equipment and species. It has about 110 links. Home 
page: http://www.nofa.net/aquaculture.html 
AquaSearch Directory. This free service has about 485 links involving aquaculture, seafood 
and fisheries. Considerable international content. Acquiring scientific and technical data from 
this source would be at best indirect. Most of the content is organizational and commercial 
information. Home page: http://www.aquasearch.net 
FishBase. This is a global information system on fishes. It was designed for use by research 
scientists, fisheries managers and zoologists and contains a number of separate data bases, 
including Species 2000, LarvalBase, Food Web Data, etc. FishBase was developed at the 
International Center for Living Resources Management (ICLARM) in collaboration with the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and with support of the 
European Commission. While it contains much free information, some services are paid and 
only available (at present) on CD ROM, such as FishBase 99 containing 20,000 references 
and information on 23,500 species. Home page: http://www.fishbase.org/search.cfm 
Fish Information Service (Japan). This site provides up-to-date information about the 
fishing and aquaculture industry. Home page: http://www.fis.com 
IntraFish (Norway). IntraFish was established as Norway's leading net site for the fish 
farming industry. The companies have now prepared a system that provides consumers with 
direct access to the latest quotations on the world's foremost salmon markets. Home page:

services organization, with offices in the USA (also servicing Europe), Mexico, India, 
Singapore, Chile and South Africa. These paid services are intended primarily for the libraries 
of academic and research institutions. It currently offers 54 data bases in a wide variety 
of subject areas, of which several are very relevant to this book. These include Aquatic 
Biology, Aquaculture and Fisheries Resources, containing about 799,000 citations and starting 
in 1971. This data base utilizes at least ten other data bases, including Aquatic Sciences and 
Fisheries Abstracts and FISHLIT. NISC's data base Fish and Fisheries Worldwide contains 
about 225,000 references and starts in 1972 and the Marine Oceanography and Freshwater 
Resources includes about 979,000 citations and starts in 1964. The data base Water Resources 
Worldwide is supposed to have a significant engineering content. All those above are 
available on the web. While a paid subscription service, free 30 day on-line trial access 
is available on BiblioLine. Home page: http://www.nisc.com; E-mail: BiblioLine@nisc.com,
