PREFACE 
Magnetic Components Design and Applications is intended primarily for the 
circuit designer and the power processing systems designer who have found 
that in order to be more effective they must learn not only to use, but to 
design their own magnetic components. It will also be useful to the trans-
former engineer, by showing how to develop high-performance designs 
quickly and easily by employing optimization criteria. 
This book is a design manual, a how-to-build-it manual, and a survey of 
some common and state-of-the-art practices in magnetic component design 
and high voltage insulation. 
It contains the data necessary to design power transformers on a gradient 
scale from 60 Hz to several hundred kilohertz, conventional and air-core 
current transformers, power reactors, saturable transformers and saturable 
reactors, and air core and conventional pulse transformers. Further, it con-
tains essential information about dielectric materials and fabrication meth-
ods, basic heat transfer technology, and electric field gradient control for 
high voltage applications. 
Mathematical methods of optimization are developed, and results are 
given in a number of areas, particularly in the area of maximizing power den-
sity in power transformers and the maximization of stored energy per unit 
volume for power reactors. 
For various reasons, each chapter is written from a different starting level. 
The chapter on materials and fabrication methods assumes virtually no 
knowledge of transformer design. Its intent is to introduce the newcomer to 
the practical side of realizing his design. The chapters on heat transfer and 
field gradient control also assume no knowledge of the basics. They explain 
the physical phenomena and techniques from a very basic level, since even 
practicing engineers have misunderstood concepts in this area. It is impor-
tant that the fundamental physical phenomena be clearly understood for the 
art to be well practiced. The chapter on optimization assumes some familiar-
vii

PREFACE 
ity with calculus for an understanding of the concepts upon which the deriva-
tions are based, but the specific design methods can be used by anyone who 
can operate a pocket calculator. The chapters on pulse transformers, current 
transformers, and nonlinear magnetics assume a moderate familiarity with 
the subject matter. 
Since even the most experienced engineer may find that it was a very small 
and basic bit of information he did not have that kept him from understand-
ing and using material in a subject area, the basics of each subject area are 
covered in each chapter from the viewpoint of that chapter's subject. This 
makes the chapters more readable independently. 
The order of the chapters is not necessarily from most elementary to most 
advanced, but rather what I saw as a logical development of the subject. It is 
recommended that the book be read from front to back without skipping in 
order to ensure that one has a comfortable grasp of all the basic applications 
and uses of magnetics. 
Some of the equations and derivations in this book are in the English 
system of units (inches) while others are in the SI system (meters or centi-
meters). I have made no effort to use only one system of units, for the reason 
that at this time on this planet our units of measurement are in chaos. 
Tape-wound C-core manufacturers dimension their products in inches, as 
do tape-wound bobbin core manufacturers, but the flux capacity of those 
bobbin cores is measured in Maxwells (the metric system). The air core pulse 
transformer design equations were derived from basic physics, and are in the 
metric system. I have left them thus. There is a particularly handy rise time 
estimating formula, which uses the coil diameter in inches. Two handy for-
mulas for transformer and inductor design were set up for core dimensions 
in inches. I have also left them thus. Some heat transfer equations are in 
English units, some in metric, and some are mixed. 
The engineer who prefers to use only the English or only the SI system will 
find that half his work is done, and he need only convert the other half of the 
material to his preferred system of units. The engineer who can work com-
fortably with both systems of units will find both the subject material and the 
literature of transformer component suppliers ready to use.

LOW FREQUENCY 
POWER TRANSFORMERS 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Electric and magnetic fields are our description of how fixed or moving 
charges exert forces on other electric charges. We describe these fields by 
lines of flux, or simply lines. We use the idea of field lines to describe how the 
influence of our fixed or moving charges is distributed in the surrounding 
space. Electric field lines start and stop on charged particles, or objects that 
contain charges. Magnetic field lines do not start or stop. They are all closed 
curves, and they encircle the path of the moving charges which give rise to 
them. They tend to concentrate in nearby objects which have certain atomic 
properties that make them receptive to the presence of these fields. The ex-
tent to which magnetic fields tend to concentrate in these materials (fer-
romagnetic materials) over free space or nonferromagnetic materials is 
called permeability. For electric fields the dielectric constant indicates in a 
corresponding manner the preference of an electric field for one kind of 
material over another. 
Nothing has either an infinite dielectric constant or an infinite permeabil-
ity. Some small numbers of the magnetic field lines surrounding the wind-
ings in a transformer will surround some or all of the conductors of the 
primary winding only, rather than reside in the core where they encircle both 
primary and secondary. Some magnetic field lines will loop outside of the 
core itself, and constitute the "stray" field of the transformer. These stray 
field lines are loops like all magnetic field lines, and they will therefore encir-
cle nearby components or circuitry. Because they encircle a conductor, they 
can induce a current in the conductor, just as they encircled the current flow 
which gave rise to that field line.

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
The simple thing we call an inductive component, and which we design 
and construct so readily, is in reality a marvelous consequence of some of the 
most fundamental forces which make this physical universe behave as it 
does. The magnetic field is really a relativistic effect, arising out of a remark-
able interplay between the electric field and the nature of this space. The in-
terested reader is urged to obtain the three-volume set of the Feynman lec-
tures on physics, and read in particular the second volume. 
Since this is a book about magnetic components it might be helpful to 
define, or at least establish some agreement as to just what magnetic com-
ponents are. 
Magnetic components are those which store or transform energy by utiliz-
ing the magnetic fields associated with electric currents. 
Electric currents are electrons or charged particles which are moving or 
caused to move, usually through conductors. 
The actual velocity of an electron in a wire is perhaps a tenth of a milli-
meter per second, but when we push an electron in one end of a wire it repells 
nearby electrons which in turn repel further electrons, and a different elec-
tron pops out the other end of the wire very rapidly. The time it takes for the 
pushing in of the first electron and the popping out of the first electron is 
dependent on how fast the push propagates down the wire. That push is the 
electrostatic field of each electron nudging that of the next. 
Something else happens here when we do this. We are in effect setting 
charges in motion, and when something is moving it usually has an energy 
associated with that motion, called kinetic energy. An ordinary piece of mass 
stores its energy of motion within itself, but charges behave a little differ-
ently. You can look at the situation as if the charge stores its energy of mo-
tion in the surrounding space, rather than within itself. The mass of the elec-
tron stores kinetic energy in its mass, but the charge, which is not mass, 
behaves differently. 
It is this energy of motion of a charge which we call the magnetic field. A 
useful definition of a field is "a physical quantity which takes on different 
values at different points in space." 
Even if we can't see the field we can measure the presence of it. Magnetic 
fields affect the behavior of charges in such a way as to bring about the be-
havior characteristics of transformers and inductors. 
Physics is not an exact science, and we definitely do not know all the rules. 
If we set up a very simple, restricted experiment, we find that it behaves in a 
certain way, and we can say we understand the laws of physics that govern 
that experiment. The foregoing explanation of the nature of a magnetic field

would probably cause Maxwell to roll over in his grave, but for our pur-
poses-understanding the behavior of magnetic components-it is an ade-
quate explanation. 
Chapter 1 will introduce the basic considerations of low frequency (50-60 
Hz) power transformers up to sereral KV A. It does not give sufficient data to 
completely design even the simplest transformer. The subject of dielectric 
materials and fabrication methods is dealt with in the last chapter, while the 
mathematical tools for choosing the proper core are dealt with in Chapter 2. 
Chapter 1 is intended as a springboard from which (with the rest of the book) 
one can evolve sophisticated designs (high voltage, high frequency, opti-
mized form factor, etc.). In order to do this, some common design and con-
struction methods practiced by transformer engineers are presented. 
2. IDEAL AND SIMPLE TRANSFORMERS 
An ideal transformer is an energy transfer device. Actual transformers have 
parasitic components which store and/or dissipate small amounts of energy. 
The action of a transformer is in essence to match a source to a load by 
changing the voltage-to-current ratio in the power delivered from a source to 
that required by a load. The impedance of the load is transformed by the 
square of the turns ratio, while the voltage or current is transformed directly 
as the turns ratio. The maximum power transfer takes place when the trans-
formed load impedance is equal to the source impedance. This is why some 
transformers are referred to as "impedance matching" transformers. In 
truth, they all are. One would usually not speak of power transformers 
literally in this context, since a power source such as the AC line has an im-
pedance which is usually, to a first approximation, zero. 
The transformer itself has series impedances which can limit the available 
power to a load. The variation in output voltage from no load to full load, 
expressed as a percentage, is usually referred to as the regulation of a power 
transformer. "Five percent no load to full load regulation" means that 5<1/o 
of the input voltage is dropped across the series resistances and reactances, 
the balance being presented to the load. 
The parasitic components of a simple transformer are shown in Fig. 1-1. 
Note that the parasitic components to the right of Rp are due to the presence 
of the secondary, and from the viewpoint of the source are transformed by 
the square of turns ratio (N = Nsecl Npri). From the viewpoint of the load all 
components as shown would be multiplied by I I N 2â¢

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
Fig. 1-1. Transformer equivalent circuit. 
2.1. Primary Winding 
Lp is the inductance of the primary winding at the operating frequency and 
flux density. Since many core materials are nonlinear, measurement of this 
parameter should be performed at the design operating conditions. Rp is the 
equivalent parallel resistance of the core. The power lost in the core is 
represented as a current flowing through Rp. That current is in phase with 
the applied voltage. The power due to that current and the applied voltage 
shows up entirely as heat. The current which flows through Lp is almost 90Â° 
out of phase with the applied voltage, and the only thermal loss due to this is 
the loss from the current flowing through R'p (the primary winding 
resistance). 
The so-called magnetizing current, the current drawn by a transformer 
connected to a voltage source, with no load on the transformer secondary 
winding(s), is actually the vector sum of the currents through Rp and Lp (as 
well as any reactive currents flowing through shunt capacitances of the wind-
ings, usually negligible compared to the other two). 
R 'pis the DC resistance of the primary winding. R ~is the DC resistance of 
the secondary winding. At 50/60Hz the current flows essentially in the entire 
cross section of the conductor, so the DC resistance adequately describes the 
resistive winding loss parameter of low frequency power transformers. It is 
important to note that copper (the most commonly used conductor* for 
designs operating up to - 150-200Â°C) has a temperature coefficient of 
resistance of approximately + 0.30JofDC. In designs with a relatively high 
temperature rise, the resistance at the operating temperature must be used 
when calculating regulation or temperature rise. 
*In some power transformers where weight is important, aluminum foil is used for the wind-
ings. Its density is much less than that of copper, but its resistivity is somewhat higher. In certain 
situations it can be advantageous, but terminating the foil reliably to tabs or leads is not con-
ducive to the manufacturing of prototypes or small production runs with any degree of facility. 

LOW FREQUENCY POWER TRANSFORMERS 5 
2.1.1. Leakage Inductance. L Pis the leakage inductance of the primary 
winding. It represents magnetic field lines encircling primary conductors 
which are not linked to the secondary winding. 
Leakage inductance is a function of geometry alone; it is independent of 
the magnetic properties of the core. It is a function of the radial build (wind-
ing depth or thickness) of the winding, among other things. It represents 
energy storage potential in the volume of the primary winding and part of the 
space between primary and secondary. Since primary leakage inductance is a 
measure of the lines of flux encircling primary conductors only, the energy 
stored in it will induce a voltage in the primary winding when the primary 
current is interrupted. That induced voltage can in turn induce a current in 
the secondary winding of the transformer, but it does so in this indirect man-
ner. 
Leakage inductance in a finished transformer is commonly measured by 
shorting the secondary winding and measuring the primary inductance. This 
actually gives the total leakage inductance of primary and secondary wind-
ings, referred to the primary side. Leakage inductance is not usually a 
parameter of concern in 60Hz transformers; however, in large, high-voltage 
designs or some 400Hz designs it could be of some concern, as it would af-
fect the load regulation. In saturable reactors it can be a problem even at low 
frequencies, and should not be ignored. More about this in Chapter 4 
(Nonlinear Magnetics). Leakage inductance will also be discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 3 (Power Reactors) and Chapter 6 (Pulse Transformers). 
The considerations involved in the design of high frequency power trans-
formers have much in common with those involved in pulse transformer 
design, in that leakage inductance and stray capacitance are of great con-
cern. In addition, high frequency power transformers require that attention 
be given to heat transfer, field gradient control, and the materials of con-
struction. There is, therefore, no one chapter in this book entitled "high fre-
quency transformer design." The reader who wishes to design such compo-
nents is urged to read the book in its entirety and then apply the data and 
techniques of the various chapters as appropriate. 
2.1.2. Capacitance. Cp is the equivalent shunt capacitance representing 
the distributed intra winding capacitance of the primary winding. In Fig. 1-1 
it is shown to the right of the primary leakage inductance L pÂ· It is actually 
distributed across L 'p. but it can usually be approximated as a single lumped 
element. I have never known it to be a matter of significant concern in 60Hz 
low frequency power transformers, and only occasionally in 400Hz designs.

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
It may be measured by removing the core from the primary winding, mea-
suring its air core inductance, and then its self-resonant frequency. It may be 
easier to calculate it from the air core pulse transformer design equations of 
Chapter 6. 
Some apparent components of C'p and C~ can ':Je of concern in isolation 
transformers. The stray capacitance from the ends of windings to the core 
and thence to other windings or elsewhere can be a matter of great concern 
when attempting to build a device which will give, say, 100 dB of common 
mode source noise isolation from a sensitive load. Here one may be con-
cerned about literally a few tenths of picofarads of primary-secondary 
capacitance, and the windings must be carefully shielded in order to obtain 
this level of performance. Fig. l-2 shows some of the stray capacitances in a 
transformer. Some of the capacitances may be much larger than others, de-
pending on the particular geometry and arrangement of windings. Usually at 
least half of the capacitances shown are insignificant, but at one time or 
another the practicing engineer will see and have to deal with each one. 
3. SECONDARY WINDING 
3.1. Leakage Inductance 
L ~is the leakage inductance of the secondary winding. It is not the total leak-
age inductance of the transformer as seen from the secondary. That would 
be the primary leakage inductance reflected through the square of the turns 
ratio plus the secondary leakage inductance. 
The action of a transformer is to maintain equal ampere-turns in both 
Primary 
Secondary 
Core

LOW FREQUENCY POWER TRANSFORMERS

primary and secondary windings. If the geometry of primary and secondary 
windings were exactly equal and symmetrical, then equal ampere-turns 
would be present within the volumes of both windings, regardless of the 
turns ratio of the transformer. Then one would expect identical magnetic 
fields to link each winding with an equal portion of the space between them, 
but not with the other winding. One would then expect the leakage induc-
tance of each winding to be equal within only the square of the turns ratio. In 
other words, with the transformer in operation equal energies would be 
stored in both primary and secondary leakage inductances. When a time-
rate-of-change of current is forced in one winding of the transformer, the 
energy stored in the secondary leakage inductance is discharged out of the 
secondary winding into the load or winding capacitance, just as with the 
energy in the primary leakage inductance. Depending on the external cir-
cuitry, a discharge path for the secondary leakage inductance may or may 
not be present. The collapsing field will induce a voltage in one winding, 
which in turn induces a voltage in other windings. The energy definitely will 
go somewhere. Perhaps into charge stray capacitances, perhaps into induced 
eddy currents or hysteresis loss in the core, perhaps into external com-
ponents. 
This is not usually of great concern in 60Hz transformers, and only occa-
sionally in 400Hz transformers. It is definitely of concern in high frequency 
power transformers and pulse transformers. 
A method of calculating leakage inductance can be found in Chapter 6. 
3.2. Capacitance 
C's is the equivalent shunt capacitance representing the distributed intra-
winding capacitance of the secondary winding, similar to C'p. 
In high voltage, low current transformers it is possible for C~ to be high 
enough that significant excitation current could be drawn by C's to be com-
parable to the load current. But just as primary magnetizing current lags the 
load current by 90Â° and adds as a vector, the current drawn by C's would lead 
the load current and also add as a vector. Thus if the current drawn by C~ 
were 300Jo of load current, the apparent current drawn by the transformer 
would only be about 10% higher. 
4. LOSS 
It is often part of human nature not to waste something, or to save as much 
as possible. In our minds we can imagine a device or process which works 

8 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
perfectly, wastes nothing, does exactly what is expected of it, and lasts for-
ever. 
The transformers we must design must work not only in our minds, but in 
this universe as well; and this universe exacts a price from everything in it. As 
long as the natural laws that govern the structure and function of this uni-
verse persist, no physical thing will ever be 10011/o efficient. 
Therefore, one of the first tasks facing the transformer designer is to 
decide how much loss he is willing to have in his transformer. 
Some of this loss is reactive, i.e., volt-amperes of energy flow through the 
transformer but are not converted to heat. Some of the loss is resistive, i.e., 
manifested as heat. Of the resistive loss, some is dissipated as heat in the core 
(core loss) and some is dissipated as heat in the conductors of the windings. 
The designer must then decide how much thermal loss he will budget for 
the core and how much for the windings, and what limit of reactive loss is ac-
ceptable. He then proceeds to design a transformer with losses suitably close 
to the budget limits. Now we have the moment of truth. The designer looks 
at his design, considers the physical reality of that transformer, and decides 
whether his initial loss limits and allocation were appropriate to the physical 
reality he obtained. Some modification of the original loss budget may be-
come desirable if there is an insufficient agreement between the reality of the 
designer and that of the transformer. 
5. CORES 
From time to time, we will be discussing particular design situations, often 
pulling a particular core material out of thin air for purposes of an example. 
There are three main factors that influence the choice of core material: the 
core loss at or over the frequency range of interest, the maximum flux den-
sity capability, and the permeability of the core material at the operating flux 
density. There are other factors such as cost, availability of standard or 
custom shapes, and operating temperature range, but for reasons of brevity 
we shall take these to be of secondary significance in most discussions. Core 
manufacturers have such data readily available. 
Power transformers operating at 50/60Hz are able to utilize 0.012 in. (12 
mil) thick, tape wound C-cores or 14 mil (20 gauge) stamped laminations, as 
these materials have quite low core losses at this frequency. They can be com-
fortably operated at 12,000-15,000 Gauss; less in larger units, depending on 
available means of heat transfer. More will be said about this in Chapter 8. 
Twelve mil Z-type material may be operated several thousand Gauss higher 
with acceptable core loss. The permeability of these materials is quite good

for large AC or DC flux densities, but may be unacceptably low for some ap-
plications where a very small AC flux density is superimposed on a large DC 
flux density (for example, power reactors with high frequency ripple). 
6. STARTING A DESIGN 
As a first design approach to a transformer, one could start by choosing a 
tentative core type and shape. (A logical method of specifying cores is 
developed in Chapter 2.) In the case of 50/60Hz transformers, the material 
would usually be grain-oriented silicon steel, 0.012-0.014 in. thick, or 0.012 
Z-type silicon for higher flux density requirements. After choosing an initial 
flux density for our core, one would then proceed to calculate the volts per 
turn. Bear in mind that a final design would consider not nominal operating 
parameters, but lowest frequency, highest acceptable flux density (usually 
deriving from core loss and/or exciting current considerations), and 
minimum core area after mechanical tolerances and stacking factor are 
taken into account. Tape-wound or laminated steel cores have a thin coating 
of insulation on the laminated strips or sheets of steel. This takes up space. 
The space occupied by the core is therefore not lOOUJo iron, but some fraction 
less. This fraction is called the stacking factor, and may be obtained from the 
catalogs of core material manufacturers. 
A useful relationship among core area, turns, frequency, voltage and flux 
density is 
volts

-~-- = 2.8658/A X 10 
, 
turn 
(1) 
where B is in kilogauss, f is in Hertz, and A is the net core area in square 
inches. Another way of saying the same thing is 
volts _ <l>f(UJo saturation/ l 00) 
~r~- -
45 x 10 6 
(2) 
where <I> is core flux capacity in Maxwells, [<I>= B (Gauss) A (cm 2)]. 
The above expressions are for sine waves, where E is in volts RMS. For 
square wave excitation the operating flux density is about ll UJo higher, so 
VI N must be reduced by that factor, for the same B. 
Given a tentative value for volts per turn, one can then proceed to 
calculate the number of primary and secondary turns. Given the current in 
each winding, one can pick a tentative wire size and see if the required 

10 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
number of turns of those wire sizes fit within the winding area of the chosen 
core. If not, a smaller wire size, a higher flux density (to reduce the number 
of required turns) or more coil winding area is required. 
We do not yet have sufficient tools to completely design a transformer or 
predict the magnitudes of all the parasitic components, but we can use the 
tools we have. Let us say that we had a core to hand, with 2 sq. in. of cross-
sectional area (and a stacking factor of 0.95). Let us further say that we 
wished to transform the 120 V AC line down to 15 V to provide power to a 
vacuum tube heater. The number of turns required for the primary winding 
may be found by calculating volts per turn and dividing that into the primary 
voltage (120 V). Assume we operate the core at 12,000 Gauss, and that the 
frequency is 60Hz. Then, 
V/N = 2.865 X 12 X 60 X 2.0 X 0.95 X 10- 4 
VIN=0.39 
120 
Npri = 0_39 = 306. 
The number of secondary turns might be 
15 
Nsec = --= 38 
0.39 
' 
but we will actually get less than 15 V out when the transformer is loaded, 
since the load current will reduce the effective volts per turn as it drops some 
voltage across the winding resistances. 
Now we need to know the resistance of copper conductors so that we can 
select conductors which (hopefully) both meet our resistance limit require-
ments and fit within the available winding area of the core. 
7. THE WIRE TABLE 
At this point a slight digression is in order, so that the reader may become 
familiar with the table of wire sizes and its use in transformer design. 
There are a number of interesting things about the wire table. Remember-
ing these relationships will allow one to reconstruct it from memory: 
1. The diameter of bare #10 is about 100 mils. 
2. The diameter of bare #30 is about 10 mils. 
3. The diameter of bare #20 is about 31.6 mils. (The square root of 10 
multiplied by the diameter of #30.)

4. The diameter of bare #40 is about 3.16 mils. For each decade of AWG, 
the a.ea changes by a factor of 10. For each two decades of A WG, the 
diameter goes down by a factor of 10. 
5. The area of #20 is 1000 circular mils. 
6. The area of #23 is 500 circular mils. For any wire size, go three sizes up 
(or down) and the area halves (or doubles). 
7. The resistance of #10 is about 1 ohm per 1000 feet, or 1 milliohm per 
foot. 
8. The resistance of #20 is about 10 milliohms per foot. The resistance is 
inversely proportional to the conductor area. 
9. #20 weighs 3.17 lb. per 1000 feet. 
If one were to remember only the pattern of the wire table and the fact that 
#10 has a resistance of 1 milliohm per foot, one would be able to reconstruct 
most of the wire table from memory. 
The typical current densities mentioned here are extremely vague guide-
lines. Particular regulation and temperature requirements dictate exact cur-
rent densities. 
For smaller 60 Hz transformers, 500-750 em/ A might be an appropriate 
range to start in. For larger units (where the heat path from the inside of the 
winding to the outside is much longer, the thermal resistance higher, and 
hence the internal temperature rise potentially much more than in a smaller 
unit), perhaps 1000 em/ A or more might be appropriate. 
8. CONTINUING THE DESIGN 
Once we have found a suitable wire size for the above trial design we may 
then proceed to calculate core loss and copper loss, and then determine the 
temperature rise and load regulation of the finished unit. If these final 
parameters are within the user's limits of acceptance, we have a finished elec-
trical design. 
Let us now say that our load requires 12 amperes, and the window of the 
core (the place where the coil goes) is 1 in. high and 3 in. long. Refer to the 
wire table, and assume 750 em/ A current density. Choose for the secondary 
winding # 11. The turns ratio is about 8 : l, so the primary current would be 
about 1.5 amps. Choose #20. Start with the primary winding, if for no other 
reason than it will be easier to wind a few turns of heavy wire on top of the 
lighter gauge. (This is not necessarily true when dealing with extremely fine 
wires.) 
For a 3 in. coil length, assume the actual conductor winding length is 2.5

in. #20 would have about 26 turns/in., or 65 turns/layer. With 306 turns 
total, 5 layers would be sufficient, with 5 mil interlayer insulation. 
Assume 30 mils of something between the primary and secondary wind-
ings. 
#II will give about 9.5 turns/in., or about 24 turns/layer. Two layers are 
sufficient for 30 turns. The total build of the coil is then:

One would expect that, even with the wires bulging a bit, such a coil would 
fit within a 1 in. available height. 
In order to calculate the winding resistance we need the length of each 
winding. We will do this by calculating the mean length of a turn and 
multiplying by the number of turns of each winding. 
In Fig. 1-3, one may see that the inner perimeter of the coil is 2D + 2E, 
and the outer perimeter is 2D + 2E plus the circumference of a circle of 
radius r. The mean of those two is 2D + 2Eplus the circumference of a circle 
of radius r 12, or 2D + 2E + 1r x (radial build of our coil): 
MLT = 2 X 2 + 2 X I+ 1r X 0.52 = 7.63 in. 
Assume 8 in., or 2/3 foot. The length of the primary is then about 205 feet 
and the secondary about 26 feet. From the wire table, the DC resistances are 
about 2.07 ohms and 0.033 ohms, respectively. The J2R losses are then about

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
4.7 watts and 4.8 watts, respectively, for a total coil loss of 9.5 watts. 
Without having read the chapter on heat transfer we consider the size of the 
transformer, estimate that the coil loss looks fairly low, and assume that we 
won't have any thermal problems. 
The voltage drop from the primary current in the primary winding is 1.5 
amps x 2.07 ohms = 3.11 volts, or 2.60/o. This lowers the effective second-
ary induced volts per turn by 2.6%. The voltage drop in the secondary wind-
ing is 12 x 0.033 = 0.40 volts, or 2.6%. This lowers the secondary voltage 
under load by another 2.6%. We should add 5.2% to the secondary turns to 
make up for that, and add 5.2% to the incremental addition to make up for 
the proportionate loss in the added turns. That is: 
38 x 0.052 = 1.976 turns 
plus 
1.976 x 0.052 = 0.103 turns, 
for a total of 2.079 turns additional. 
Do not attempt to put fractional turns on a transformer. It is not good 
practice to drill holes in a core, which is the only way one can realize 0.079 
turns (by having a turn link 0.079 of the flux in the core, the hole being 
drilled off to one side so the turn encloses 0.079 of the cross-sectional area). 
We should therefore add 2 turns to the secondary (there is room on the last 
layer) to obtain 15 volts at full load with a 120 volt input. 
9. A CASUAL DISCUSSION 
Another method of handling the variables mentioned above and their inter-
action is to use the design algorithm developed by Col. William T. McLyman 
in his book, Transformer and Inductor Design Handbook (1978). That 
method is most conveniently applied to cores of standard sizes-those for 
which the design parameters McLyman developed (the K-factors) have been 
defined. As will be seen in the next chapter, one can benefit by allowing the 
core shape itself to be a variable. Manufacturers of C-cores can make vir-
tually any shape, and rarely keep any stock of even "standard" sizes. In 
many cases it may be more advantageous, especially f<;>r 50/60 Hz trans-
formers, to assemble the core out of a stack of punched laminations. This 
has a number of advantages, not the least of which is that one may be able to 
obtain delivery on a 50-100 lbs box of laminations in a few days but have to 
wait six weeks for a C-core. 
The reader will find within the chapter on optimization (Chapter 2) a 
graph of power-handling capacity versus a range of stack heights for a

typical lamination size. It will be instructive for the beginning engineer to 
design a transformer on a suitable stack of standard E-1 laminations, and 
then design the same unit on a C-core with an optimized form factor and 
compare the two finished designs with respect to volume, weight, and 
temperature rise for units having the same total losses. 
Another convenient beginning point, essentially that which is found or im-
plied in many core manufacturers' catalogs, is to use the tabulated products 
of core area and window area for C-cores or laminations. The product of 
core area and window area (in inches) multiplied by 50 is an approximate 
measure of the power-handling ability of a core at 60Hz. That total product, 
then multiplied by 7, is an approximate measure of the power-handling abil-
ity of a core at 400Hz. As will be seen in Chapters 2 and 3, this is not a proper 
figure of merit for transformers or inductors. Hopefully, all core manufac-
turers will soon begin noting the proper figures of merit in their catalogs. 
400Hz transformers are usually used in military applications. As such, a 
greater premium is placed on size and weight than for most 50/60Hz trans-
formers. There is a tendency to push performance harder, to design for 
higher operating temperatures, or to give greater consideration to heat 
removal. 
As one attempts to carry 60Hz transformer designs and design guidelines 
over to 400Hz, one must bear in mind that not everything carries over in a 
linear fashion (i.e., at a 1 : I ratio). As we will prove in the next chapter, the 
square of the operating frequency is inversely proportional to a linear dimen-
sion to the fifth power; and clearly the surface area is proportional to the 
square of a linear dimension. Hence, for a constant power loss mapping of a 
60Hz design into a 400Hz design, the surface area goes inversely as the fre-
quency to the 4/5 power. From 60 to 400Hz this means a reduction in sur-
face area of about a factor of 4-5 : I. That would imply a temperature rise 
over ambient of 4-5 times that of its 60 Hz counterpart. This would be true 
only for copper losses. Core weight decreases, core materials with different 
lamination thickness (different watts/pound loss characteristics) are used, 
and many more variables are introduced. 
Fortunately, copper losses need not map over l : 1, since the mean length 
of turn drops to less than half that of its 60 Hz counterpart (- 400Jo), and 
copper losses drop accordingly. Designing a 400 Hz transformer for about 
half the copper loss of its 60 Hz counterpart usually gets one into a 
reasonable temperature rise ballpark. More exact data in this area will be 
developed later in the book. 
One interesting consequence of the attendant size reduction of higher fre-
quency transformers is that the winding resistance of a 400 Hz transformer

tends to be lower than that of its 60Hz counterpart because of the increase in 
volts per turn and the reduction in mean length of turn. The inrush current 
experienced by rectifier diodes for capacitor input filters is therefore much 
higher, and it is occasionally necessary to choose rectifiers for their surge 
current capability rather than average current rating. This is not necessarily 
of direct concern to the transformer designer because the thermal mass of 
copper in the winding is usually sufficient to limit the winding temperature 
rise to a safe level. But it is a parameter over which he has some control, and 
the system designer should be aware of the available tradeoffs. 
Occasionally one will find requirements for higher frequency transformers 
operating at power line frequencies of 800-2400 Hz. Several years ago, I 
became aware of a system which required 125 kV DC at 1 amp from a three-
phase, 5000 V, 5 kHz power source. Fortunately, most low frequency power 
designs are at 60 to 400Hz. The designer can usually obtain higher frequency 
designs by an extension of the 400Hz design considerations. 
Skin effect in 400 Hz transformers is not usually a problem. If the designer 
is in doubt, he can check the wire table in this chapter. 
Leakage inductance is not usually significant in lower voltage, lower 
power 400Hz designs. In high voltage, high power designs it can be a signifi-
cant factor in the load regulation. A good example is a three-phase 
transformer with a wye secondary, delivering 33 kV at 12 kW. Each second-
ary had 3200 turns on a form about 2.5 in. by 4.5 in. The secondary leakage 
inductance was calculated to be on the order of one Henry per coil! At 400 
Hz, the impedance of one Henry is about 2500 ohms; at 360 rnA that gives a 
voltage drop of 900 volts per leg, or 1800 volts for the wye. This is 5.5o/o of 
the output, and even though the inductive drop is in quadrature with the 
resistive drop, this may need to be taken into consideration by both the 
transformer designer and the system designer. Series leakage inductance in 
square wave high frequency power transformers can be treated as an im-
pedance which drops a direct proportion of the input voltage, for regulation 
purposes. Its energy storage effects cause power loss in high frequency 
square wave inverters by momentarily blocking the power flow from the DC 
source to a load that accepts a power flow most of the cycle. This can be a 
major cause of power dissipation in the switches of many current-fed in-
verters. 
Leakage inductance is roughly a linear function of the coil length, build, 
or mean length of turn, but goes as the square of the number of turns. There-
fore the best way to reduce leakage inductance is to reduce the number of 
turns by increasing the core area. This will increase the mean length of turn 
linearly; therefore, to a first order the leakage inductance will go down 

LOW FREQUENCY POWER TRANSFORMERS 
17 
linearly as the core area goes up. The length of the winding can also be in-
creased, since this will reduce the leakage inductance approximately linearly. 
One can go only so far in this direction, for as we do this the number of volts 
per layer increases and demands thicker layer insulation. (It should not be 
considered unusual to see layer insulation on the order of one to two wire 
diameters in some high voltage designs.) When a large amount of layer in-
sulation is required, it can increase the radial build of the coil such that one is 
no longer gaining but begins to lose, and an increase in the winding length 
buys nothing. As the number of turns is reduced and the core area increased 
proportionately, the primary magnetizing current goes up, and one will soon 
reach a point where that magnetizing current is unacceptably high, and then 
one may reduce leakage inductance further only by decreasing the radial 
winding build and/or increasing the coil length. In current-fed inverters 
which must operate over a wide load range, excessive magnetizing current 
can be a problem as the transformer regenerates its magnetizing current back 
to the source for half of each cycle. If the average load current (including 
core loss) is not sufficient to give a net positive current into the inverter, then 
the current feed choke is forced by the inverter to accept an instantaneous 
current reversal, which of course it will not. The result is a large voltage 
spike. The simplest solution is to keep the inductance high enough that the 
magnetizing current is less than the average current into the inverter. A 
minimum load may be needed, or additional circuit components to handle 
the regenerative flow. 
Leakage inductance can be very significant in 400Hz saturable reactors. 
This will be discussed in Chapter 4. 
Those geometries which tend to reduce leakage inductance (relatively few 
layers, relatively long) also raise the shunt interwinding capacitance. One 
will rarely get in trouble because of excessive interwinding capacitance in 
high voltage, low frequency transformers, but it can happen. A three-phase, 
400Hz design, delivering 27 kV at 20 rnA DC from a wye secondary ended 
up being built on a core with about 2\14 sq. in. of core area and 5 sq. in. of 
winding area per coil. The coil length was 5 Y2 in. and the radial build of the 
coil about % in. This is a very poor set of proportions for a high voltage 
transformer. The coil is too long for the winding build, and the ratio of iron 
to copper area is somewhat low because the designer in a fit of extreme con-
servatism used a design flux density of 8 kilogauss. The secondary windings 
were each self-resonant at about 5 kHz, and this resonance was pumped 
fairly well by the 2400 Hz component of the rectification process, giving 
about 250fo ripple from a circuit that was supposed to have about 50fo. 
The designer could have recognized that the proportions looked instinc-

18 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
tively wrong, or he could have simply calculated everything and discovered 
the resonance. If the designer does not have a well-developed instinct for 
transformer design parameters, he should calculate everything; he will rap-
idly develop a sense of what "looks good" and what needs to be checked. 
Interleaving of windings is sometimes used in resonant charging reactors 
and some high frequency power transformers. 
The main purpose of an interleaved winding structure is to reduce the leak-
age inductance between windings. The main drawbacks are two. First, it in-
creases the coil complexity and hence the manufacturing cost. Second, it 
increases the capacitance between windings in an often surprising manner. 
Depending on the voltage developed between windings or winding portions 
during circuit operation, the energy stored (Yz CV2) in a particular stray 
capacitor may be rather high, and the transformer will have the behavior of a 
larger capacitor than had been intended. Discussion of leakage inductance 
and related parameters may be found in Rippel and McLyman (1982). 
A rough rule of thumb is that the leakage inductance is reduced as the 
square of the number of interleaves. 
Interleaving of windings should only be used where the required leakage 
inductance or the space available does not allow the component to be de-
signed in the normal manner, with one winding on top of another. As we will 
see in the chapter on pulse transformers, one can make the leakage induc-
tance of a winding structure arbitrarily low by increasing the winding length 
and reducing the radial build. 
Interleaving may be used to great advantage when the induced voltages of 
the windings to be interleaved are in phase or very small. In that case, there is 
little or no energy stored in the interwinding capacitance. One example of 
this is current balance transformers or high frequency power combining 
transformers. During normal circuit operation the induced voltage is 
relatively small. One-to-one non-inverting pulse transformers are another 
example. The reader must beware of using this indiscriminately, however. 
High voltage isolation transformers will store considerable energy in the in-
terwinding capacitance, and here interleaving is usually contraindicated. 
This will be discussed in more detail in the chapter on field gradient control 
(Chapter 7). 
The leakage reactance per se of an inductor is that associated with the 
radial build of the coil, and represents flux not coupled to the core. It may 
show up as a high frequency resonance (with the feed-through or interlayer 
capacitance) or it may cause coupling of high frequency noise to improperly 
dressed nearby wiring. Aside from making the inductor longer and thinner, 

LOW FREQUENCY POWER TRANSFORMERS 
19 
one can reduce the stray field by using a core structure which envelops more 
of the coil, and placing the gap in the core leg which is inside the coil. 
Pot cores offer the most effective self-shielding structure.* Next most ef-
fective are the Type lll constructed units (also known as coil-type wind-
ings-a winding on each leg of a U-U or U-1 core) and the Type li units (also 
known as shell type-one coil on an E-core). Least effective is the Type I 
construction (also known as core-type-one coil on one leg of aU-core). The 
effectiveness of a Type Ill design in reducing stray fields (or reducing pickup 
from external fields) should not be underestimated. All single-coil magnetic 
structures have an external field shape which is that of a dipole. Type III 
structures have a quadrupole field which falls off with distance much faster 
than a dipole field. A toroid is a special case of a Type III structure. 
The last few pages have given a rather casual discussion of some of the 
considerations that affect magnetic component design. It is hoped at this 
point that the novice designer has an awareness of the notion that there are 
more than two or three such considerations. This does not mean the subject 
is complex; complexity is only due to the subject not being fully seen or 
describable. The following chapters will take those various considerations 
and develop them in sufficient detail that the designer can deal with them 
systematically.

1. INTRODUCTION

OPTIMIZATION 
The word optimize has been used so frequently in the last few years to mean 
such a variety of conditions that its popular meaning appears to be 
"something the author has developed." The accurate meaning is, "to 
achieve the best or most satisfactory balance among several factors." 
Optimum form factor is not necessarily the optimum amount of 
mechanical redesign necessary to make it fit into the space available, and op-
timum efficiency may or may not be optimum cost. In most cases we will be 
seeking an optimum which is a maximum or a minimum of something, with 
something else taken as a variable and other things allowed to float in-
dependently or held constant as the situation indicates. This requires no 
more extensive mathematical background than understanding differential 
calculus and being able to differentiate simple functions to follow the deriva-
tion, and only a command of simple algebra to be able to produce results. 
We shall be using mathematical tools to evaluate magnetic components, 
and we define optimize as, "to seek a maximum or minimum for some 
parameter or weighted combination of parameters." Sometimes the func-
tions we will deal with have a single maximum or minimum, so the decision-
making process will be straightforward. We must recognize that the factors 
to which we wish to optimize our design must be included in the initial for-
mulation. If the least expensive design for a given temperature rise is the ob-
ject, then a mathematical statement of the cost must be formulated as a func-
tion of core sizes and shape, number of turns of different wire sizes, etc. 
Our basic approach will be to derive a general expression for the 
parameter to be optimized (maximized or minimized). We use known design 
relationships to reduce the number of variables so that the relationship can 
20 

OPTIMIZATION 
21 
be expressed in terms of one parameter. We then take the first derivative of 
that expression with respect to our parameter and set it equal to zero. This 
will locate a point of zero slope on our expression, which is a maximum or 
minimum. This is the basic process used in all applications of this concept in 
Â·this book. In more complex situations we will derive that which is to be op-
timized and then present the results of computer processing. 
A concept familiar to mathematicians and physicists, but new to most 
electronics engineers, is introduced in order to analyze magnetic components 
of varying characteristics and sizes. It is important that the reader under-
stand it, since it is the keystone of the optimization analysis. 
Triangles are said to be similar if they have equal angles, even if some are 
larger or smaller than others. Let us say we wish to discuss the general class 
of all similar triangles with one right angle. We take the larger triangles and 
scale them down to the size of a standard triangle of unit height. We take the 
smaller triangles and scale them up to the size of our standard triangle. The 
standard triangle of unit height is said to be the normalized size, all our dif-
ferent triangles have been normalized, and the process is called normaliza-
tion. 
We keep track of the scaling factor by which we multiplied each of our 
original triangles in order to normalize them, and when we are done studying 
our different triangles we wish to return them to their original sizes. We 
multiply the dimensions of each by the reciprocal of its original scaling fac-
tor. This is called denormalization. It is a returning to the original, real-
world size. The reciprocal of the scaling factor is called the denormalization 
factor. 
This is an extremely powerful mathematical tool. It allows us to easily ob-
tain a much deeper understanding of how to go about designing a magnetic 
component, and why some designs are better than others. 
The decision as to what to optimize, what to allow to be a variable, and 
what to hold fixed, must not be lightly made. In some cases the choice is 
clear, such as maximizing the power-handling capability of a single-phase or 
three-phase power transformer. By looking at watts per cubic inch of volume 
at constant copper losses and allowing the relative shape to vary, we can 
generate a family of normalized designs. From this the more efficient shapes 
can be selected and then scaled to whatever power level is required. We will 
repeat this procedure, looking at combined core and copper losses, and 
derive another family of normalized designs. 
In the case of a power reactor, we will address efficiency of the power reac-
tor as an energy storage element. This is done by seeking a criterion which 
maximizes the number of Joules of stored energy per cubic inch of volume, 

22 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
with respect to the rate of energy loss due to the current flowing through the 
winding resistance. The most efficient shapes for this purpose can be found 
by allowing the form factor to vary. Interestingly enough, the geometric 
criterion thus derived is identical to that for transformers, wherein only cop-
per losses were considered. This will be derived in Chapter 3. 
We have not sought to optimize anything for minimum weight, although it 
could be done. That is left as an exercise for the interested reader. Our first 
development of the subject will deal only with copper losses. Our second 
development will cover combined core and copper losses. 
It is probably implicit in any effort to apply rigorous, precise 
mathematical tools to something crafted by man, that there will be assump-
tions about relative significance and approximations made in the name of ex-
pediency. A totally precise generalized design would take into account every 
scrap of paper and gram of impregnant, would consider only discrete wire 
sizes rather than a continuum, and so forth. To avoid boring the reader to 
death and then presenting him with a single equation three pages long con-
taining a meaning known only to God, we simplify and make assumptions in 
order to obtain a generally useful tool. 
For special design considerations such as high voltage, the reader can with 
little difficulty modify the derivations along the lines indicated, to suit his 
purpose. 
One general assumption made in most of the work in this chapter is that 
the cross-sectional area of the copper in the winding area is roughly 400fo of 
the maximum available winding area. This is based on the concept that 
enough space and insulation to give the required degree of mechanical sup-
port to a coil usually also gives sufficient electrical insulation for the most 
common range of voltages (up to a few hundred volts in small units, or a few 
thousand volts in larger units). In small units the copper occupies somewhat 
less than 40% of the available area, but the mounting surface tends often to 
be larger in proportion to the unit than in large transformers. Therefore the 
internal temperature rise is somewhat less due to the increased heat transfer 
area. In some bobbin-wound designs with rectangular wire, or some foil-
wound designs, the copper fill factor is somewhat higher. 
2. DERIVING THE FIGURE OF MERIT 
FOR WINDING LOSS 
Consider a transformer with identical primary and secondary windings. Let 
the mean length of turn be U (the average of the primary and secondary 
mean length of turn in this development). The length (I w) of a winding is NV, 

OPTIMIZATION 
23 
where N is the number of turns in that winding. The resistance of that 
winding is: 
R 
(2.1) 
where e is the volume resistivity of the conductor material and A w is the area 
of one turn of the conductor. For copper, e is 7 x 10 -? ohms per square 
inch-inch. 
Hence, 
R 
(2.2) 
Let each winding occupy 200Jo of the available winding area of the core, 
whose dimensions shall be F (height) and G (length). Then

N 
and 
R 
eNzU 
(2.4) 
0.2FG 
where R is either the primary resistance or the secondary resistance referred 
to the primary. 
Let the input power to the transformer be P watts = Vvolts I amperesÂ· Note 
that we do not need PorI in these equations.

where B is the flux density in kilogauss, jis frequency in Hertz, D and E are

around) in inches, and Sis the space factor of the core (less than unity for all 
tape-wound cores,- unity for ferrites).

tions. 
3. USING THE FIGURE OF MERIT 
Choose a set of normalized core dimensions from one of the tables in this 
book. Those sets of dimensions have been selected to satisfy the criterion 
that, within each given overall form factor, each set of core dimensions gives 
the lowest value of U/D 2E 2FG. Each set gives the lowest resistance design in 
that form factor. 
That's not quite the end of the road. 
In the real world the engineer would specify a total copper loss for the 
transformer, either from regulation or temperature rise or from efficiency 
considerations. Any of these give a specific numerical maximum for the 
winding resistance. In light of this, Eq. (2. 7) can be rearranged to reflect our 
understanding: 
(2.8) 
Since all terms on the right are given, the right-hand side of Eq. (2.8) has a 
specific numerical value. This numerical value is associated with, and is a 
measure of, the real-world transformer we wish to build. That is the denor-
malized design. It is in fact power-handling capability at constant efficiency. 
The values of D 2Â£ 2FGIU and D 2E 2FGIUPQ, which are given in various 
tables within this chapter, are normalized. The former is a figure of merit for 
transformers. The latter is a figure of merit per unit volume (PQ representing 
the volume, as we will see later), showing that some overall form factors have 

OPTIMIZATION 
25 
better volumetric efficiency than others. They should be considered to have 
arbitrary dimensions. Normalized designs are used to compare one with 
another. We select one and scale it up or down to fit our specific require-
ment. Here is how that is done: 
1. Pick a normalized design with what appears to be a suitable overall 
form factor (shape) PQ and a suitably high value of D 2E 2FG/UPQ. 
2. For that design, note the value of D 2E 2FGIU. 
3. Take the numerical value of the right-hand side of Eq. (2.8) and divide 
it by the value noted in step 2. You have divided a denormalized value 
of D 2E 2FGIU by a normalized value of that same parameter. Call that 
quotient K 3â¢ 
4. Take the fifth root of the number obtained in step 3 (i.e., raise it to the 
0.2 power). The resulting number K is the denormalization constant. (I 
recommend five significant figures to minimize accumulation of 
round-off errors.) 
5. For the normalized design chosen in step 1, take the given values of D, 
E, F, and G and multiply each by K to obtain new dimensions KD, KE, 
KF, KG. Those are the dimensions (in inches) of the real-world core 
upon which the transformer of Eq. (2.8) may be constructed. 
Those are the basics. The material which follows develops those ideas in 
the light of specific circumstances. 
4. SPECIFIC GEOMETRIES 
There are three basic geometries of a single-phase transformer (not including 
the toroid, which is most closely related to Type III). The types are shown in 
Figs. 2-1 through 2-4. Type I is sometimes called a core type, Type II a shell 
type, and Type III a coil type. The designations for core dimensions given are 
those commonly applied to tape-wound C-cores (see Fig. 2-1). It may be 
noted that Type II (Fig. 2-3) corresponds also to a transformer constructed 
from E-E or E-1 stamped laminations. Observe that Type I designs (Fig. 2-2) 
are the simplest to construct with C-cores, while Type III designs (Fig. 2-4) 
offer roughly 500Jo higher power-handling capability at constant efficiency 
per unit volume. It has been known that the latter type is better than the 
former, but until this analysis was done no one knew how good they really 
were. The shell designs (Type II) are intermediate in volumetric efficiency, 
but offer reduced core weight since the magnetic circuit length is less than for 
single-core designs.

5. OPTIMUM CORE DIMENSIONS 
We have seen that the power-handling capability at constant efficiency is 
represented by D 2E 2FG/U. With the volume as PQ, the maximum value of 
D 2E 2FGIU can be calculated for each of the many sets of (P, Q). Hence op-
timum values of D, E, F, and G can be found for each set (P, Q). 
Finding the particular values of D, E, F, and G which give the highest 
value of D 2E 2FGIU for 500 different form factors in each of 4 cases is a task 
best left to a computer. It turns out that an operating system with six signifi-
cant figures can deliver only four significant figures in results, because of the 
accumulation of round-off errors. The computer was told to locate the max-
imum value of D 2E 2FG/Uto within I part in 10,000. It came fairly close. We 
have checked some of the optima on a pocket calculator (more tedious but 
much more accurate, with eight significant figures). The values given in the 
tables appear to be within a O.llt/o or better of the true optimum values, 
which is at least 20 times more accurate than needed for transformer design. 
The width of the peak at maximum is such that a variation of Don the order 
of 3% (with E, F, and G varying correspondingly to hold the overall form 
factor constant) produces a variation on the order of 0.3-3% in D 2E 2FGIU. 
Since the power-handling capability sensitivity factors are small, we can 
round core dimensions up or down to convenient nearby fractional dimen-
sions with little change in the actual power-handling capability. The tech-
nique is therefore a useful one in the real world of tolerances and standard 
fractional dimensions. 
We may compare these relative optima by forming the quotient 
D 2E 2FG/UPQ, power-handling capability per unit volume at constant effi-
ciency. A plot of the values of this factor over a range of proportions (P, Q) is 
presented in the Tables 2-1 to 2-3 for each of the three previously outlined

transformer dimensions, but an incentive to obtain the literature of some 
lamination suppliers. 
The three-phase transformer is now considered. Note that in most 
manufacturers' catalogs the leg thickness is designated as 2E. Since it is the 
total cross-sectional area per leg we have considered previously, for con-
sistency we shall also call the leg thickness E. Be sure to translate this when 
talking to manufacturers. They wind one C-core on top of another to pro-
duce a tape-wound E-core, and they call each C-core tape buildup E. (See 
Fig. 2-6.) 
The power-handling capability per unit volume at constant efficiency is 
given in Table 2-4, with exact core dimensions for various form factors 
shown as Case IV in Appendix A. 
6. HIGH VOLTAGE CONSIDERATIONS 
For a high voltage transformer we have somewhat more difficulty in starting 
with a normalized design. Different application requirements have different 
operating voltage levels, and those require real-world physical spacings 
which cannot be scaled at different power levels. Similarly, the number of 
turns per layer leads to some number of volts per layer, which requires a cer-
tain thickness of layer insulation. Layer width is therefore not an arbitrarily 
scalable parameter. The particular rectifier and shield configuration dictates

certain insulation thicknesses between windings, shields, and core, and these 
also cannot be arbitrarily scaled. 
A reasonably decent design can be done in some cases by selecting a core 
based on the previously outlined power-handling criteria and arbitrarily in-
creasing the F and G dimensions to allow for insulation. This is most useful 
where a relatively low voltage winding floats at a moderately high potential, 
and where the insulation area in the core window is less than the copper area. 
For high voltage, low capacity isolation transformers, the result tends to be 
an approximately square core area, an approximately square core window, 
and a secondary winding of roughly square cross section, sometimes wound 
on a circular form or in a toroidal shell and spaced symmetrically from core 
and primary. 
In the case of a high voltage transformer which develops higher voltages 
(above perhaps 10 kV), the form factor of the transformer begins to be in-
fluenced very strongly not only by the insulation around the secondary wind-
ing, but also by the required form factor of the secondary winding itself. The 
secondary wire size has been determined by a successive approximation/ 
trial and error initial design effort. At so many volts per turn a layer of some 
length develops so many volts. The layer insulation must not only provide 
mechanical support for the wire, but must also have sufficient thickness that 
when impregnated it will withstand the electrical stress of the layer-to-layer 
potential. In conventional coils, wound alternately left to right and right to 
left, the maximum stress on the layer insulation is due to the voltage 
developed by two layers of windings. In some cases, either to reduce the 

32 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
layer-to-layer voltage stress (by one-half) or the intra winding capacitance (by 
one-quarter) each layer is wound from left to right, the layer finish insulated 
and crossed over to the left, and the next layer wound again from left to 
right. 
The maximum length of a layer is governed in most cases by the thickness 
of layer insulation necessary to hold off the voltage developed by the number 
of turns in that length. When the volume of layer insulation begins to exceed 
the volume of the conductor, the point of diminishing returns is close for 
most 60/400 Hz transformers and some higher frequency situations. 
The most common procedure we have used for high voltage plate 
transformer designs is this: 
Select a core with E = F, D = (E to 2Â£), and G to be determined later. 
Juggle dimensions as necessary to fit into customer-specified overall dimen-
sions. 
If no overall dimensions are given, select a core by assuming a copper 
space fill factor of 20o/o instead of the 40% used for transformer derivation 
earlier in this chapter. Start with P somewhere in the range of 1-2 and Q on 
the ridge of maxima. Use the D and E dimensions of that core. 
Convince the customer to use a full-wave doubler circuit, as it eases 
transformer insulation requirements. 
Determine secondary RMS current from Schade's curves in Appendix C, * 
and pick a wire size of about 400 circular mils per ampere for 400Hz designs 
or 800 circular mils per ampere for 60Hz designs. Determine volts per turn 
from core area and flux density, using 12-14 kilogauss for grain-oriented 
silicon steel, and 14-16 kilogauss for Z-type material. Pick a layer insulation 
somewhere between half the wire diameter and twice the wire diameter. Use 
enough turns per layer to give an assumed 200 volts per mil layer insulation 
dielectric stress. That gives the winding length for a chosen wire size. Assume 
50 volts per mil of stress in the margins. That gives the G dimension of the 
core. Add up the required insulation thicknesses and builds of the primary 
and secondary windings, and see if it fits into the chosen F. 
Then calculate the approximate intrawinding secondary capacitance, us-
ing the air core transformer formulas for pulse transformers as developed in 
Chapter 6. The exception is that for the factor S (the layer insulation 
thickness of a one-turn-per-layer design), use the layer insulation thickness 
of your trial design divided by the number of turns per layer, since one layer 
*Shade's curves are used in rectifier circuit design. Any designer who deals with rectification of 
sine wave power and capacitor input filters should be intimately familiar with these curves. They 
are an invaluable design tool.

of insulation is associated with many turns per layer. Then calculate the 
leakage inductance of the transformer. The self-resonant frequency of the 
transformer must be well above the 12th harmonic of the input frequency for 
single-phase designs, or the 36th harmonic of the input frequency for three-
phase designs. 
Check the winding resistance to determine whether energy losses are ac-
ceptable and rework the design as appropriate. 
Check the core loss to ensure it is within acceptable limits for overall 
losses. Since the thermal conductivity of epoxy-impregnated paper is 
relatively poor, about 50-65"7o of the copper loss should be placed in the 
primary, where it can be conducted to the core. This gives a chance of 
roughly equal temperature rises in both primary and secondary. If at all 
possible, mold the entire unit in a high thermal conductivity epoxy resin to 
aid in heat flow from both the high voltage coil and the core to the mounting 
surface. Keep in mind that the thermal conductivity of the core is greater out 
to the edges of the laminations than across the laminations. If possible, make 
the winding form somewhat wider in theE dimension so that the high ther-
mal conductivity potting can surround both sides of the core in its E dimen-
sion and aid in heat flow from both the core and the primary. 
For high frequency, high voltage designs, proceed along similar lines. 
Here the exception is that the self-resonant frequency must usually end up 
high enough that the rise time of the transformer will be a fairly small frac-
tion of the period of the input waveform (no more than 10%). For high 
power, high frequency designs the rise time will usually become limited by 
the LIR time constant of the leakage inductance and the load resistance. 
In some high power, high frequency designs it may be necessary to use a 
larger wire size than would at first seem to be called for based on current-
carrying considerations. The design must be forced to enough layers that the 
distributed intrawinding capacitance is low enough, while at the same time 
the length of the coil is kept long so that leakage inductance will be low. This 
tends to occur in high volts-per-turn designs with very high turns ratios (in 
excess of 100 : 1), where leakage inductance must be minimized. In those 
cases secondary copper losses become almost negligible. The dominant 
dissipative loss is core loss, with primary copper loss the second major 
dissipative factor. Core loss can usually be fixed based on core surface area 
and heat transfer means available, thereby giving flux density, since a par-
ticular core, frequency, and core loss imply a particular flux density. 
In practice, I start a high frequency, high power, high voltage design by 
picking an allowable core temperature rise based on available cooling means. 

34 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
From that I work out a trial flux density and volts-per-turn. I then design the 
secondary winding and the insulation around it, and attempt to place a 
primary winding with acceptably low resistive losses in the remaining space. 
If the design does not fit, there are several options. 
If the ferrite core has an appreciable portion of its surface smooth and 
flat, as in pot cores, U cores, or E cores, aluminum shapes can be bent to 
those surfaces to aid in heat conduction or convective heat transfer. A higher 
flux density is thereby allowed in the core, and fewer turns. 
If the coil does not fit in the core window, and an appreciable fraction of 
the window area is taken up with the margin insulation, there are two solu-
tions. One is to look for a core with a greater G dimension so that the wind-
ing length can be increased without reducing the margins. The other solution 
is to keep the original core size and increase the winding length of the design 
by reducing the margins. This will raise the electrical stress in the margins. 
The more highly stressed the design, the more care must be taken to ensure 
not only adequate dielectric strength, but also a more uniform electric field 
in the stressed region. The electric field between coil and core can be shaped 
by putting a round conductor next to the sharp edge of the core facing the 
coil. That, and a number of layers of Nomex-Kapton-Nomex (or Kraft-
Mylar-Kraft, or Kraft-Kapton-Kraft) laminate inside the window going up 
one edge of the coil, along its length, and down the other edge (the F dimen-
sion, the G dimension, and again the Fdimension) with a width about 1.5-2 
times the D dimension, will allow the margin stress to be raised to about 
100-200 volts per mil with good epoxy impregnation. 
If the secondary resistance loss (including skin effect) is still small, the wire 
size can be reduced. If necessary the layers can be wound in the same direc-
tion to halve the layer insulation stress. 
High frequency, high voltage power transformers done on toroidal cores 
do not yield the most efficient designs. The major heat source will be the 
core, and the thermal conductivity of all the insulation and windings on top 
of it is poor. The entire voltage developed by the turns around 360Â° of the 
core is developed across the layer of interwinding insulation, and it is dif-
ficult to control insulation thickness while ensuring good impregnation on a 
toroid. Further, the many turns on a high voltage toroid tend to be piled 
somewhat helter-skelter on top of each other, so that turns far apart elec-
trically will find themselves in physical contact. The winding machine can 
occasionally scrape or scratch a piece of wire, reducing the film thickness of 
insulation on the wire. 
In designs of sufficiently high voltage or power that these factors would be 
significant, toroids are less than desirable. 

OPTIMIZATION 
35 
At higher frequencies, ferrites or tape-wound C-cores (one-half or 1 mil 
alloy thickness) are the preferred materials. At lower frequencies tape-
wound C-cores of 1-4 mils do best. One might be tempted to use thin-gauge, 
tape-wound bobbin cores at frequencies of 100 kHz or more for high 
voltage, but it really becomes academic since leakage inductance and in-
trawinding capacitance go up so fast with turns ratios that pushing the fre-
quency higher and higher does not help. For turns ratios on the order of 100: 
1 and power levels of a few hundred watts to a few tens of kilowatts, the best 
operating frequency ranges downwards from 200 kHz toward 2 kHz. (One 
would here define "best" as an equality of dissatisfaction between the 
physical size, the high parasitic losses due to the frequency not being lower, 
the core loss, and the excessively large filter components needed due to the 
frequency not being higher.) 
Given a fairly specific design situation, some parameter could of course be 
optimized with respect to some other, using differential calculus as we have 
done here and in Chapter 3. One fairly general item is the optimization of 
layer insulation thickness for maximum high frequency response. This very 
useful tool for high frequency designs is developed in Chapter 3. 
7. A DESIGN EXAMPLE 
Let us now work out an example of a power transformer design. Let us say 
that out input is 208 volts, 400 Hz, and we choose a flux density of 12 
kilogauss. The power to be transferred is 1 kw, the turns ratio is 1 : I, and we 
want 20Jo copper losses. For about 5 amps, with 1 OJo of the copper loss in the 
primary, our primary loss would be 10 watts, for a DC resistance of 0.4 
ohms. Using Eq. (2.8), and assuming a stacking factor for our 4 mil core of 
0.90,

l-.64X-10 8 x0.4 X 12 2 X 400 2 X 0.81 
0.2474. 
Assuming a Case I configuration, look at Table 2-1 and select (somewhat 
arbitrarily, but following the ridge of maxima) a form factor of P == 1.5, 
Q == 2.7. For this normalized core, D 2E 2FGIU (labelled "Pwr" in the 
table) is 0.01281. That core has dimensions of D == 0.735, E == 0.617, 
F == 0.132, and G == 1.465. Since the power capability of our normalized 
core is less than that required, we will obviously have to scale it up. Our 

36 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
denormalization coefficient will be (0.2474/0.0I281) 115 = 1.8079. Our nor-
malized core dimensions become D = 1.3288 (I Y. in.), E = I. I I 55 (I Y. in.), 
F = 0.2386 (Y. in.), G = 2.6485 (2 Y. in.), and our overall dimensions about 
1.8 X 2.7 X 4.9 in.

1,200 square mils, or

Pick #18. At 21 turns per inch and a winding length of 2 Y. in., we expect 47 
turns per layer, or 2.32 layers for each winding. 
This is distinctly inconvenient, as it means that two-thirds of a layer in 
each winding is wasted space. Further, we see that if we have a total of six 
layers of# I8, we're going to come out right about 0.25 in. build, without any 
room left over for the interwinding insulation or the winding form. A quick 
estimate of the winding resistance tells us to expect a length of about 50 feet 
and a resistance of 0.32 ohms per winding. So we are a little on the conser-
vative side and can afford to drop down to # I9 A WG. At 24 turns per inch 
we expect 54 turns per layer or 108 turns for two layers. Excellent. Change 
the number of primary turns to l 08 from 109 (a hair higher flux density) and 
run with it. 
Assume a winding form of 0.030 epoxy fiberglass and layer insulation of 
0.007 in. Nomex 410. Assume interwinding insulation of two wraps 212

This will fit in a 0.25 in. high space. The mean length of turn U (average of 
both windings) is 5 Y. in. The total length of each winding is about 52 ft. At 
8.05 milliohms per foot we have 0.417 ohms, just about what we wanted. 
We can take a look at core loss here, since this method does not predict it 
analytically and leads to a class of designs with a relatively large core com-
pared to the amount of copper. In this case our core volume is 12.77 cu. in. 
Assuming a specific gravity of 0.276 pounds per cubic inch and a stacking 
factor of 0. 9, we expect a core weight of 3.17 pounds. If our core loss is 
around I 0-15 watts peÂ·r pound, our core loss for this transformer would be in 
the range of 30-50 watts. 
Our total copper loss for the transformer is only about 20 watts, so we are 
on the wrong side of the maximum efficiency criterion where copper losses 
should be about equal to core losses. Since core loss goes (very roughly) as 
the 2.5 power of the flux density, we would expect that a reduction of flux 
density to 0. 76 of its present value would reduce our core loss roughly by 
half. Close discussion with several C-core manufacturers (Arnold, Magnetic 
Metals, Magnetics Inc., National Magnetics) would tell you who has a good 
batch of 4-mil silicon steel that gives better core loss, and whether someone's 
Z-type silicon might have less core loss-or one could go to a 2-mil core an-
nealed for minimum core loss. (In special cases some manufacturers can an-
neal tape-wound cores for minimum loss. Be sure to discuss this with the core 
manufacturer in critical applications.) 
With a little work on this matter we might be able to get the core loss down 
to the 20 watt neighborhood. 
If we were to specify a higher allowable resistance (say, 0.6 ohm) for a 
total copper loss of 30 watts, our denormalized core would be somewhat 
smaller than this one. The core weight would drop, and with it the core loss. 
Since our core has a significant radial build, the mean magnetic circuit 
length (and hence the core weight for the same DE and FG products) could 
be reduced by going to shell-type construction (type II). 
At lower frequencies where core loss comes out somewhat less than the 
design copper loss, core and copper losses can be balanced out somewhat by 
going to a type III design (coil type), and reducing the mean length of turn of 
the windings. 
One would conclude from an examination of the tables and the core loss 
data for 12 mil, 4 mil, and 2 mil silicon steels at various frequencies that 
Types I and II designs are more favored at lower frequencies (60Hz). Type I 
or III designs will be more favored for maximum efficiency designs with 
equal core and copper loss from 400 Hz up to where parasitics (leakage in-
ductance and shunt capacitance) begin to dictate coil geometry; at which 

38 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
point one usually ends up with a Type I or II geometry based on a single coil 
for simplicity and lower capacitance at high step-up ratios, or a Type III 
geometry for minimum leakage or saturation inductance at high step-down 
ratios. 
Looking back at our design, we might compare the core and copper 
aspects of this class of designs. The coil volume (UFG) is 15.09 cu. in. About 
40!1Jo of that, or 6 cu. in., is copper. Our total copper losses are about 20 
watts; the copper weight is about 0.4 pounds, for 50 watts per pound of cop-
per losses. On the other hand, our copper losses are about I .3 watts per cubic 
inch of total coil volume, and our core losses are roughly 3-4 watts per cubic 
inch (at 400 Hz), or about 10-15 watts per pound. 
You can see that there is a significant difference in the loss density when 
comparing core losses and copper losses. One might expect that something 
or other would become optimized if the transformer generated its thermal 
losses uniformly throughout its volume. This idea is a thermodynamic con-
cept, discussed in greater detail in the chapter on pulse transformers. 
8. AN OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM FOR MINIMUM 
VOLUME WHICH INCLUDES BOTH CORE AND 
COPPER LOSS 
It can be shown* that the winding loss in a linear magnetic component may 
be predicted and a specific core size selected to deliver that performance. 
Further, the volumetric efficiency of a magnetic component with respect to 
winding resistive losses has been shown to be a function of the relative 
overall proportions of the unit. Computer analysis has given exact core 
dimensions such that the volume is minimized for a given level of losses, for 
each of a wide range of form factors. 
These data, while expedient for much of magnetic component design, take 
no account of core loss, neither predicting it nor attempting to hold any op-
timum relationship (for minimum overall loss) between core and copper loss. 
Calculations can be made which show that the efficiency of a transformer is 
a maximum when core and copper losses are equal. This may or may not be 
valid. One can argue, based on thermodynamic considerations, that the 
transformer will be in its lowest energy state (and therefore, presumably, at 
maximum efficiency) when the rate of thermal energy generation per unit 
volume is equal in both core and coil. Whether only the copper volume of the

39 
coil or the entire coil volume is to be considered could also be discussed. Fur-
ther, these two lines of reasoning do not necessarily give the same result. 
Instead of attempting to pass on the validity of these considerations, we 
take a more objective approach and set up a general expression for the total 
loss of a transformer (the sum of core and copper loss). The advantage of 
such a general approach is that we do not force our preconceived ideas into 
the analysis, but simply state the problem in a totally objective manner. The 
application of mathematical tools to our problem will then give us the 
answer which is a logical consequence of the physical relationships of our 
problem as we have stated it. 
What we will do, specifically, is this: 
l. We will set up a general expression for total loss. 
2. We will add the condition that, for this total loss, we want the flux den-
sity to be as high as possible. This second condition means that we want 
to utilize our core material capability to the greatest extent possible. 
These results will be used to simplify our general expression. 
3. We will then solve our general expression for the denormalization con-
stant, which will allow us to scale a normalized core of desired relative 
proportions up or down to give the actual core upon which the 
transformer is to be constructed. 
4. We will observe that our expression for the denormalization constant, 
in terms of circuit parameters and core dimensions, has not presup-
posed any particular proportions. We then use the same technique for 
varying core dimensions to minimize the denormalization constant as 
we did when considering winding loss only. We will then obtain relative 
proportions for cores which give minimum total loss per unit volume, 
and we will be able to see which relative proportions are to be pre-
ferred. 
Nowhere in this procedure will we assume any fixed ratio between core 
and winding losses. We let that ratio fall out as it may, and are then free to 
speculate on what it means. 
8.1. Copper Loss 
We begin by recalling a general expression relating the core dimensions, 
winding resistance and denormalization constant of a transformer:

The core losses will have to be taken off the manufacturer's graphs unless 
analytic descriptions of their material properties have been furnished. It can 
be put in the form 
(2.11) 
where C 1 is a frequency-dependent constant which will vary with frequency 
and flux density, but can be determined with adequate accuracy. The 2.5 ex-
ponent of B is an approximation taken for the purposes of this analysis. It, 
too, will vary for one material or another, and depends somewhat on/, and 
B itself. These can be determined from the core loss data published by core 
manufacturers or by exact measurement of material properties in the 
neighborhood of the desired operating point. 
The actual volume of our denormalized core is DEU,, where U, is the 
mean length of the magnetic circuit. If we use normalized core dimensions 
and a denormalization constant, our actual core volume is

eighth degree polynomial, and such things apparently do not have general 
solutions. One could obtain a graphical solution for specific numerical cir-
cumstances, but that would not be very useful and we have many tools re-
maining. 
Let us say that we wish B to assume the maximum value possible, consis-
tent with the total loss limitation. We will differentiate the expression for 
Ptotal with respect to B, set it equal to zero, and find the requisite relationship 
between Band the other parameters. 
Rearrange Eq. (2.14), multiplying both sides by B 2K 5, and call P 101al sim-
ply P:

8.5. Discussion of Results 
Equation (2.23), the expression for the denormalization constant, is the 
result of step 3 as discussed in the introduction to this section. Note that it is 
independent of the flux density term B. Knowing the relationship of flux 
density to core loss, once the designer has specified a desired total loss he 
does not need to choose B; he has already done that implicitly in the loss 
specification. 
Depending on the total loss level required, the mathematics may ask for a 
sufficiently high level of B that the selected core material is required to 
operate at a flux density above its capability, i.e., in saturation. In this case 
the designer must select a higher maximum flux density material, or choose a 
somewhat higher Kin order to force a lower B. 
Equation (2.23) gives the denormalization constant of a core such that the 
maximum flux density is used, a given total loss obtained, and we have not 
assumed the results of the minimum copper loss transformer form factor 
analysis. Neither have we assumed any fixed apportionment of loss between 
coil and core. It is instructive, however, to look closely at Eq. (2.21). Pis the 
total power dissipated, and the second term on the right is the core loss term 
after the criterion that B be maximized was invoked. Note that this core loss 
term is% of the total power, roughly 44.50Jo. It would appear that when the 
exponent of Bin the core loss expression is 2.5, the core loss should be a bit 
less than 45% of the total loss for maximum efficiency.

8.6. Finding the Optimum Core Dimensions 
for Various Overall Form Factors 
The fourth step in our analysis is to vary the relative core proportions to 
minimize Kin Eq. (2.23). 
Substitute the original expression for C2: 
(2.24) 
K = ( _9_x_2_.4_x_l0_8_/_:2 e,_V_2 ) 1/2.6 (

(2.25) 
Since we are going to take the derivative of K with respect to D and express 
the remaining core dimensions (Â£, F, and G) in terms of D, the first and third 
bracketed quantities in Eq. (2.25) are independent of core dimensions and 
may be treated for the moment as a constant. Accordingly, let 
(2.26) 
Equation (2.25) then becomes 
0.8/2.6 
(2.27) 
When the derivative of K with respect to Dis set equal to zero, C3 will clearly 
drop out. Our expression then becomes 
0 = d~ { ( D 2~FG) 
112.6 ( nium) o.
812.6 }Â· 
(2.28) 
At this point the drudgery of solving Eq. (2.28) about six hundred times 
for each of four basic geometric configurations is best left to a computer. 
One would obtain the D, E, F, and G dimensions of a core such that the 
value of K is minimized for a design which delivers a specified total loss. Our 
last remaining question is whether some overall form factors are better than 

OPTIMIZATION

others. Eq. (2.25) gave K as a function of circuit parameters and geometry. 
For each (P, Q) form factor we have obtained a set of (D, E, F, G) values. For 
each such set we have the computer calculate the geometric portion of Eq. 
(2.25):

We then prepare a P-Q array of the value of this parameter per unit volume 
for each geometric configuration, and look over the array for the region 
where this parameter has a relative minimum. The values of (P,Q) cor-
responding to such minimum will be the preferred form factors for 
transformers designed in accordance with the foregoing concepts. For 
aesthetic reasons, the Tables 2-5 through 2-8 give the reciprocal of the above 
function. The reader's attention is commended to the ridge of maxima for 
each of the four cases, and to the relative volumetric efficiency. 
As will be discussed by those who read McLyman (1982), the flux density 
exponent of core loss varies from near 1 to almost 3 for available materials. 
We see (in the boxed discussion at the end of Section 8.5) that, as that expo-
nent varies, the optimum apportionment of loss between coil and core also 
varies. If we are concerned with maximum volumetric efficiency, it is ap-
parent that designs with relatively more core volume are penalized more if 
their material has a higher loss exponent (all other things being equal), forc-
ing a lower flux density for proper loss balance. That implies more turns and 
thereby lower volumetric efficiency. One might expect, therefore, that the

location of the ridge of optima [on a (P, Q) plot] would be different for dif-
ferent core Joss exponents, and the core and coil dimensions within those 
(P, Q) envelopes would also be different. This first complete analysis of op-
timum transformer geometry for low-frequency power transformers covers 
only the case of a core Joss exponent of 2.5. Later work will examine how 
geometry is affected by core loss exponents between 1 and 3. 
This procedure gives an electrical design for a linear transformer or AC 
ballast reactor which meets a given total loss specification, and provides the 
minimum volume for such a design. 
One sees for transformers something which I personally was surprised to

discover from the computer plots of volumetric efficiency (for that is what I 
believe the reciprocal of the transformer function per unit volume to be). 
The volumetric efficiency actually increases as one moves toward smaller 
(P,Q) values. There is over the (P,Q) range an absolute maximum, which 
certainly was not the case when resistive winding losses only were con-
sidered. Just as we had no (optimum) solutions for large P and small Q, we 
also have no solutions for very small P and Q. The volumetric efficiency rises 
slowly up to an absolute (or global) maximum (as opposed to the relative or 
local maximum of the inductor plots) and then drops off more or less 
abruptly. The plots were cut off at (P,Q) = (0.33, 0.33) because of space 
limitations. The absolute maxima are on the plots for Cases III and IV. 
Extended computer runs showed that the apparent maxima at the edges of 
the (P, Q) plots for Cases I and II were essentially the global maxima. One 
need not be too concerned about requiring all designs to be at the outer 
fringes of theoretical peak efficiency, however. Note that from (Case I, 
P = 0.33, Q = 0.56, Case II) toP = 2, Q = 3.3, the volumetric efficiency 
drops about only 18!t!o, and the latter design may well be vastly easier to 
fabricate, let alone to realize. The ubiquitous ridge of local maxima is pres-
ent, and it is suggested that where possible the designer attempt to place his 
designs in its vicinity.

1. INTRODUCTION 
A capacitor stores energy, functioning as a charge reservoir-a charge is in-
troduced into it, and is stored there. The voltage of the reservoir changes lit-
tle. 
A series inductor is the analog of a shunt capacitor. Just as a capacitor 
stores energy as charge, so an inductor stores energy in its magnetic field as a 
result of the current flowing through it. The stored energy is Y, L/ 2 , where L 
is in Henries, I in Amperes, and the energy in Joules. 
Just as a capacitor tries to hold a constant potential using its stored energy, 
or energy storage capability, so an inductor tries to hold a constant current 
using its stored energy or energy storage capability. 
All power supply ripple filtering chokes function this way: A pulsating 
voltage source from a rectified sinusoidal or "square" wave AC source at-
tempts to pass a pulsating current into it. The stored energy smooths out the 
pulsating current, and a more nearly constant current is the result. The 
stored energy resists the efforts of the fluctuating voltage to vary the current. 
There is a complementary use of which the designer should be aware. In 
this application, the idea is to have the net energy stored in the reservoir be 
small compared to the reservoir's capacity. Recall that the voltage an induc-
tor tolerates across itself for a time and the resultant change in current is 
Et!. T = Lt!.l, where E is in volts, L in Henries, !!. Tis the period of time in-
volved in seconds, and!!./ is the change in current in amperes. If Lis suffi-
ciently large, then for some E and !!. T, !!./will be small. This application is 
called a current balancing transformer. A similar application is called a com-
mon mode choke. We will look at their similarities and their differences. 
48 

2. BALANCING TRANSFORMERS AND 
COMMON MODE CHOKES 
POWER REACTORS 
49 
Note that currents in the choke (see Fig. 3-1), due to the intended energy 
delivered from the power supply to the load, are equal and opposite and 
therefore cancel. (This is assuming exactly equal numbers of turns and ex-
actly balanced leakage inductance.) If the high frequency impedance of the 
inductor is much more than that of the source that couples the common 
mode noise into our system (so called because the noise tends to be common 
to all lines from source to load), then we will have attenuation of the noise 
current flowing through the load. That attenuation depends on the ratio of 
those impedances. This is the case where the "arbitrary ground return im-
pedance" and the high frequency (HF) noise voltage source impedance are 
small. 
The ganged switches (Fig. 3-2) could be a pair of vacuum tubes or semi-
conductors, chosen because the demands of the load were more than one 
could handle. R 1 and R 2 are the internal resistances of each; R 1 or R 2 is 
usually much smaller than R loadÂ· Another common embodiment of this con-
cept is where a single switch serves two loads (Fig. 3-3). In most applications, 
R 1 and R 2 differ by only a small amount. 
In Fig. 3-2, the action of L is to keep the net current constant, which 
means close to zero, since the load currents are opposed. A difference be-
tween R 1and R 2 would cause different currents to flow through each switch. 
This is not often desirable. The different voltages developed across R 1 and 
R 2 place different voltages across the two windings of the choke-opposite 
but not quite equal. The choke tends to resist a change in the initially zero

In Fig. 3-3 the action of Lis to attempt to maintain equal currents in each

Balancing transformers work equally well in AC or pulsed DC applica-
tions, provided the inductor is properly designed to accommodate the flux 
density resulting from the actual AC and DC components. By a simple trans-
formation of Fig. 3-2, we see that a balancing transformer can combine the 
currents from two AC sources if they are nearly synchronized. Small voltage 
and phase imbalances are readily accommodated by the configuration of 
Fig. 3-4. Any number of AC voltage sources may be combined by an appro-
priate iteration of this technique.

3. AC BALLAST REACTORS 
Power reactors are also used as impedances to be inserted in AC power lines 
such that current limiting or control may be obtained with minimal power 
dissipated as heat. Many power reactors used to filter DC currents in power 
supplies have a relatively small AC flux component and a relatively large DC 
flux component. The usual procedure is to design the reactor as if the DC 
flux component were the only contribution to the peak flux density in the 
core. After completing the design, the AC flux component is calculated to in-
sure that it was indeed negligible, and that there was sufficient margin be-
tween the maximum flux density of the core material and the operating DC 
flux density to accommodate the AC flux superimposed on the DC flux level. 
In AC ballast reactors there is no DC component. The approach used here 
is to design the AC ballast reactor as if it were the primary of a power trans-
former. The wire size is chosen to handle the maximum current flowing 
through the reactor, such that an acceptable level of thermal loss is main-
tained. Then, insert such gap as may be required to obtain the desired induc-
tance, using Eq. (3.3b), which is given later in this chapter. 
4. INDUCTOR DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
4.1. Air Core Inductors 
The inductance of an air core inductor is given by 
L = 1-'0 1rr 2N_-2 Henries 
r + b 
' 
(3.2) 
alf dimensions in centimeters, where I! 0 is the permeability of free space, 
47r x 10- 9 Hy/cm, r is the radius of the coil, b the length, and Nthe number 

52 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
of turns. r should be seen as the mean radius (the radius of the inside of the 
coil plus half the radial build of the winding). 
Conditions under which air core inductors are useful include: where fairly 
small inductance is required; the frequencies involved are quite high (pulse 
width is short); the physical presence of a core is inconvenient or 
undesirable; space may not be at a premium; large thermal losses may be 
allowed and the presence of a core would hinder heat removal from the con-
ductors; no suitable core materials exist; or some interlocking combination 
of the above. The designer will recognize such circumstances either by in-
stinct or after a few attempts to design the inductor on a core. If there is some 
uncertainty, I would recommend designing an air core inductor first to ob-
tain a physical reality on this version. 
4.2. Ferromagnetic Core Inductors 
For inductors with cores, a useful relationship is 
which sometimes may be simplified to 
3.2N2A X 10- 8 
L = ------------
(3.3a) 
(3.3b) 
where N is the number of turns, A is the net core area in square inches (the 
gross core area times a "stacking factor" or volume fill factor, available 
from manufacturer's catalog data), I g is the gap in the magnetic circuit in 
inches, I c is the length of the magnetic circuit in inches, and 11 c. is the in-
cremental permeability (defined as shown in Fig. 3-5). 
We have here the hysteresis loop of some arbitrary material. With B in 
units of Gauss and H in units of Oersteds, the permeability of air (vacuum) is 
taken as unity. Note that if our operating DC flux density is at point I, any 
change in B requires a smaller change in H. At point II, however, the same 
change in B would require a larger change in H. The ratio of B to His the 
material permeability llâ¢ but you notice that it may not be a constant for any 
given material over the full operating range. At a given point, the ratio of an 
increment of B to the corresponding increment of H is the incremental 
permeability llt.Â· You must know the permeability of your core material at 
the operating point to an accuracy appropriate to your calculations.

~------~~~~~ 
Fig. 3-5. B-H loop. 
The choice of core material for an inductor must also be based on the max-
imum flux density at which the material permeability is still high, and on the 
frequency of the AC signal which the inductor is handling. The frequency 
will have an influence, sometimes a strong influence, on the permeability at 
that proposed maximum flux density. 
The core loss associated with the AC signal, due to the AC flux density 
arising out of the AC voltage appearing across the inductor, must not be ig-
nored because that core loss is, in effect, a resistor in parallel with the induc-
tor and it allows an AC current to bypass the inductor. In extreme cases it 
may reduce the effective inductance to almost nothing. 
Note that in Fig. 3-7 it may turn out that I g is 0.1 in., I cis 6 in., and all we 
need to know is that p. .6. is more than 600 to ensure an accuracy of lO"lo. On 
the other hand, I g may be 0.01, and if p. A is only 600, then the material prop-
erties and core dimensions cannot be ignored. In most of the following deri-
vations in this chapter, the I cf p. .6. term will be dropped for the sake of sim-
plicity. In many design situations it is not insignificant, and the designer 
must remember to calculate the actual inductance of a proposed design using 
Eq. (3.3a). 
Another necessary and useful relationship for DC inductors is

can be set. The designer would pick the material which would support the 
highest flux density and still have high permeability and low core loss at the 
ripple frequency. The current is presumed known, so a relationship between 
Nand I g can be formed. This can be substituted in Eq. (3.3b) and an induc-
tance found for some given core area. 
Clearly, a core must be chosen, and that makes the situation somewhat 
ambiguous. Two options are available. In the first edition of Transformers 
and Electronic Circuits (Lee, 1955), an interesting nomograph was given. A 
version of it is reconstructed here as Fig. 3-6 (for BDc = 12,000 Gauss) and 
Fig. 3-7 (for B DC = 2,000 Gauss). In neither case is any account made for 
the material permeability or the AC flux density which would have to be 
calculated separately and added to B DCÂ· to ensure that the reactor would not 
saturate under actual operating conditions. Using this nomograph, one can 
choose any two of the four parameters-turns, gap, current, and Henries per 
square inch of core area-and obtain the remaining ones. For example: Pick 
some core or core area dimensions as a trial. Knowing the desired induc-
tance, form the quotient Henries per square inch. Find the light line sloping 
from upper left to lower right which corresponds to this number. Knowing 
the desired operating DC current, find the heavy line sloping from upper left 
to lower right. Find the intersection of those two lines. Then read horizon-
tally to the left to obtain turns, and read vertically down to obtain the gap. 
The second option is to apply the tools of optimization theory to the power 
reactor, just as we did to single- and three-phase transformers. 
5. THE MAXIMAL EFFICIENCY POWER REACTOR 
A figure of merit for power reactors is the energy stored, Y2 L/2 â¢ Another is 
the power lost, / 2R. 
We can construct a very interesting figure of merit by expressing the "effi-

time. That is just: 
(3.5) 
It is true that the current cancels in this expression. Since we introduce it 
again in some of the following equations, let's just carry it along and cancel 
later. 
It is likely that some overall form factors are more efficient than others, in 
that the expression (3.5) might be higher for some than others. Further, with 
several design variables (turns, core area, flux density, gap, etc.) it would be 
expected that several different designs might be obtained within a given form 
factor, for which (3.5) might be different in each case. 
We shall develop an expression for (3.5) in terms of electrical constants 
and dimensional parameters, and study the manner in which the relative pro-
portions of the finished unit influence the magnitude of the maximum value 
of (3.5).

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
We shall use the geometry of a Type I power transformer and those terms 
(see Fig. 3-6). 
We know that L = (3.2N 2A x 10- 8)//g and lg = (0.6NI)IB from Eqs. 
(3.3b) and (3.4); hence L = (5.33NDEB x w- 8)//, and 
Y2 L/ 2 = 2.67NIBDE X 10- 8 â¢

The mean length of the turn of the coil is U, and the total length of the wind-
ing is NU. The resistivity of copper is e = 10.7 ohms/circular mil-foot, or 
0.7 ohms/square mil-inch, or 7 X 10- 7 ohms/square inch-inch. R = 
el wl A w where A w is the area of one turn, i.e., the winding area divided by 
the number of turns and multiplied by the winding space utilization factor. 
Call the space utilization factor a. We suggest the designer try a space utiliza-
tion factor of 0.4 initially. If some other space utilization factor is appropri-
ate for a particular class of designs, the engineer can modify this equation 
and those following with the appropriate factor. So

E = (P -

E, F, and G, which will be presented shortly) we take Eq. (3.6) and denor-
malize:

Note that the second term is a pure geometric criterion for any core. The 
smaller it is, the smaller the design will be and therefore the better the design. 
Hence we have

The value of D 2E 2FG I U for various overall form factors has been 
tabulated in Appendix A, along with the dimensions of cores which fit those 
form factors and maximize this geometric parameter. This is power handling 
or energy storage ability at constant efficiency. It is interesting to note that 
this criterion is identical to that developed for transformers, which are 
energy transfer devices rather than energy storage devices.

N may be obtained by substituting the normalized value of DE in Eq. 
(3.10a). 
Note that the terms DEK 2 in the denominator of Eq. (3.10a) are the nor-
malized terms D and E from the tables of Appendix A. If you useD and Â£as 
denormalized (i.e., the actual dimensions that the real core will have for the 
desired design), recognize that you are using KD and KE, which contain K2â¢ 
The expression I g = 0.6NJ IB [Eq. (3.4)] now gives the gap required, and 
the area of the conductor is just

square inches. 
6. DESIGN EXAMPLES 
To construct the design, choose the wire size nearest that specified by Eq. 
(3.13), select a core with dimensions reasonably close to the optimum 
specified, calculate turns per layer and number of layers, and determine the 
total winding build (including layer insulation if a bobbin is not used), and 
check for fit. The wire size may need to be adjusted up or down depending on 
the space fill factor of the particular situation. The next step is to calculate 
the inductance of the actual design to ensure that no numerical errors have 
been made, using Eq. (3.3a). 
In summary, to construct an inductor design we would: 
1. Pick a (trial) set of proportions for the finished unit, assuming Type 1, 
2, or 3 construction as experience, performance or construction 
simplicity may dictate. 
2. From the P, Q chosen in the previous step, look up the value of 
D 2E 2FG/U. 
3. Substitute that value in Eq. (3.12). Multiply the normalized core di-
mensions (listed in Appendix A) by K to obtain the denormalized core 
dimensions. 
4. From Eq. (3.10a), calculate turns. 
5. From Eq. (3.13), calculate conductor cross-sectional area. 
6. Work out turns per layer or strip width. Determine interlayer insula-
tion thickness required for mechanical support or voltage capability. 
Check winding build; rework if necessary. 
7. Calculate winding resistance; rework if necessary. 

60 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
8. Calculate AC flux density. Rework if necessary with lower DC flux 
density. 
9. Evaluate heat flow problems (if any) from thermal losses in coil (and 
core, if AC core loss is significant). 
For example, let's say we need a 100 mH choke for a DC filter application. 
The current is 750 rnA DC, and the allowable DC resistance is 2 n. We 
choose a 4 mil C-core; and for winding convenience we wish a single coil. We 
choose proportions of 1: 1.8: 3.3, for which D 2E 2FG/U = 2.191 x 10- 2â¢ 
Assume a a of 0.5. 
For that core D = 0.723, E = 0.761, F = 0.138, G = 1.777. We can 
operate grain oriented silicon steel at 12,000 Gauss easily in this application, 
so, using Eq. (3.12), 
K = 47.67

J 1/5 
0.5144 X 106 
2.191 X 10- 2 
= 0.848. 
Our denormalized core dimensions are therefore D = 0.613, E = 0.645, 
F = 0.117, G = 1.507. Choose close fractional dimensions for the conve-
nience of the C-core manufacturer and to eliminate unnecessary tooling 
costs: 
D = Y. inch, 
E = Y. inch, 
F = Y. inch, 
G = 1 V2 inch.

A w = ~~ = 280 square mils. 
Let's try #26 A WG wire. At 54 turns/inch and a 1 Y4 inch winding length, 
we would have 68 turns/layer, and five layers. Use 0.003 Nomex 410 for 
layer insulation, so we have 0.021 per layer x 5 layers = 0.105 in. winding 
build. This clearly fits, but ignores some practical matters like the thickness 

POWER REACTORS 
61 
of the winding form (0.020 minimum if we use epoxy/fiberglass) and the fact 
that the coil has some "spring" to it. Unless we impregnate it with epoxy and 
cure it in a C-clamp, we'll never get a coil with 0.125 build to fit a 0.125 win-
dow height. Even at that, we haven't put any outside wrap on the coil. 
Designing for an 80% fill factor on coil height gives us some room to accom-
modate dimensional tolerances on both the coil components and the core, as 
well as the inevitable "bowing" of wire wound over a rectangular coil form. 
Let's check the winding resistance first and make sure we have only one 
thing to fix. Mean length of turn == 2.9 in., total length == 81 ft, #26 has 
0.041 0/ft, so R == 3.31 0. Too high. 
This is because we calculated that we needed 280 square mils of cross-sec-
tional area for our wire, but picked #26 with 253 circular mils, so our con-
ductor had 200 square mils instead of 280. Let us look more closely at that: 
200 
square 
mils x 334 
turns == 66,800 square 
mils; 
coil 
winding 
area== 187,500 square mils, so we were only using about one-third of the 
space, and the equations assumed a space utilization factor of 0.5. That is 
just about how much our resistance was off by. The point here is that in 
many layer-wound coils using magnet wire, the space utilization factor for 
copper may be in the 25-40% range, not 50%. This is the nature of the inter-
face between theory and reality. 
One option is to raise the F dimension of the core to allow a larger wire 
size. We estimate #24 would be required. At 54 turns per layer, 6.19layers 
would be needed. This is mildly annoying. We have to squeeze the turns per 
layer up. We can increase the winding length and reduce the (Y. in.) margins, 
or we can lengthen the core to allow a greater winding length and keep the Y. 
in. margins, or we can try to wind more turns in the specified 11;4 in. winding 
length than the wire table recommends. We could, of course, simply leave it 
at 6.19layers and put the few remaining turns on a seventh layer, but that 
would waste the remainder of the space on that layer. 
There is another option. We can go back to our initial choice of flux den-
sity, and decide that 12,000 Gauss was conservative. We can get by and meet 
the specification with perhaps as high as 14,000 Gauss. The incremental per-
meability is still considerably higher than what we anticipate the effective 
permeability of the core will be when gapped (calculate I g from 
I 8 == 0.6NII B, then divide the mean length of the core by the gap. That is Jle 
if Jla is still much higher-perhaps 50 times higher; see Fig. (3-7). Along 
those lines, we could also specify our C-core to be 4 mil Z-type material. 
That is a square loop, grain-oriented material, and looks quite good several 
thousand Gauss higher than "round loop" silicon steel. 

62 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
Let's see what we can do with this approach. Keeping the same core size 
for the moment, from Eq. (3.10a), 
N= 
10- 1 X 0.75 
5.33 X 0.352 X 1.4 X 104 X 10 
8 
= 285 turns at 14,000 Gauss. 
Let us try this on for size. With #24, we had 54 turns per layer. For 285 
turns we need 5.28 layers. If we increase the G dimension of the core to 1 Y,. 
we can get 57 turns/layer and still keep our Ys in. margins. Now we have five 
layers. With #24 and 0.003 Nomex 410 for layer insulation and wire support, 
we have a total thickness of 0.026 in./layer, and a winding build of 0.130 in. 
A winding form would raise that to 0.150 in., and the outside wrap would 
make it 0.160 in. If 0.160 in. were 8511Jo of the available height, then we would 
want the F dimension to be Y. â¢Â· 
Our DC resistance for this design is now 1. 77 n. Our overall dimensions 
are now very close to those specified as optimum proportions. The finished 
unit has grown Y,. in. in length and Ys in. in width and height. 
Let's take another example. Let's say we want a 20 ~tH, 15 amp choke with 
0.010 n DC resistance. Since this will be used in a 500 kHz switching 
regulator, we select a ferrite core (Magnetics, Inc. type F material for highest 
DC flux density) and a DC flux density of 3,000 Gauss. Assume a = 0.5. 
Let us try core proportions of P = 1.2, Q = 1.8, and a type I geometry. 
For that core D 2D 2FG/ U = 0.004774 (from the Appendix), and D = 0. 742, 
E = 0.471, F = 0.129, G = 0.858. 
Substituting in Eq. (3.12), 
K = 47.67 [

Our denormalized core dimensions are therefore D = 0.471 in., E = 0.299

Area of one turn A w = FG/2N = 1718 square mils is required. Use 0.0040 
copper laminated to 0.001 Kapton, a spiral strip coil; copper width = 0.450, 
winding build= 0.065, mean length of turn == 1.79 in., DC resistance= 
0.0045 0/foot; 1.9 ft = 0.0086 0, slightly less than 0.010 0 because in this 
case our copper area was slightly better than 50<1/o. 
Admittedly, it is not often that one can specify such a custom shape in fer-
rite and be able to afford it. Still, it is now possible to look through the 
manufacturer's catalog for various ferrite cores which come close to the 
designed size. The search for the right size core to base the design upon has 
been vastly simplified. 
Another unusual thing done in this example was to specify a copper-
Kapton laminate as the winding material. Round wire could have been used, 
but the foil is much more convenient for fabrication purposes in this case. 
The material can be obtained from a company such as Scheldahl. Cut it to 
about 0.520 wide, with the foil etched back to a width of 0.450, centered on 
the Kapton film. 
As a final check, calculate the AC flux density for this choke. The RMS 
voltage is 30 Vat 500kHz, so [using Eq. (1.1)] 
30 = 2.865 X B X 5 X 105 X 0.14 X IQ- 4: 
13 
B = 1 10 Gauss, which is small compared to 3,000, so we can indeed use 
3,000 Gauss DC. 
The thermal loss in the winding is - 2.25 watts, and the final packaging 
and environmental requirements happen to be compatible with this level of 
heat and the coil surface area. 
Let's look at another example. We need an 80 mH choke to handle 8 amps 
DC, and our DC resistance is allowed to be 0.2 0. Further, we have only a 2% 
in. wide space available for this choke, but it can be as tall or long as we wish. 
Let us try this on a Type I configuration and see where we are. Pick P = 2.2, 
Q = 5.6, and see what we get: for this form factor D 2E 2FGI U = 0.06477, 
D = 0.720, E = 0.960, F = 0.140, G = 3.680. Use 12,000 Gauss. Assume

We see from this that our normalized dimensions would become 2.55 
in. x 5.61 in. x 14.28 in., which wouldn't quite fit in our 2% in. space. We 

64 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
elect to use a Type Ill geometry for this unit, to take advantage of its higher 
volumetric efficiency. For Case III, P = 2.2, Q = 5.6, D 2Â£ 2FG/ U = 0.1092, 
D = 0.772, E = 0.872, F = 0.228, G = 3.896. Then, K = 54.75 x 0.02695 
x 1.5572 = 2.2977, which would fit in 2Y. in. Our length is 12.9 in., and our 
height is 5.06 in. Our denormalized core dimensions are D = 1.774, 
E = 2.004, F = 0.524, G = 8.860. 
Note that the overall volume of the type III version is 143.6 cubic inches, 
where for the same electrical functions implemented in a type I design the 
overall volume is 204.3 cubic inches. Where space is at a premium the two-
coil single-core geometry is clearly superior. 
If we wished, we could specify 4 mil Z-type silicon for the core and operate 
our reactor at about 14,000-15,000 Gauss. If cost were no object, we might 
even go to Supermendur, operate around 19,000 Gauss and reduce the 
volume even further. 
At these current levels the larger wire size will give a better space fill factor 
than the previous example. Finishing the design, and selecting wire size, 
layer insulation, gap, etc., is left to the reader as an exercise. The reader is 
also urged to examine Table 2-2 and determine whether other proportions 
thart P = 2.2, Q = 5.6 might be more advantageous for this Type Ill design. 
It must be emphasized that there is no substitute for common sense. (Com-
mon sense may be defined as looking objectively and observing what really 
is, instead of assuming "what everyone knows" or assuming that because 
something has always been done a certain way that is the only way or the best 
way to do it.) 
Say we are given proportions of 0.68 x 0.68 x 1 in which to put a trans-
former or choke. From Table 2-1, we notice that the power handling cap-
ability per unit volume for P = 0.68, Q = 0.68 is about 75 x 10- 5â¢ But this 
assumes a certain orientation of the core and coil within that volume! 
0.68 x 0.68 x 1 has the same proportions as 1 x 1 x 1.47. Looking up 
P = 1, Q = 1.5 in the same table, we find the power handling capability per 
unit volume to be 186 x 10- 5 , more than double! 
7. A HIGH FREQUENCY CONSIDERATION 
We can see another interesting property of inductors by looking at some of 
the high frequency parasitics. Assuming the construction is fairly uniform, 
our inductor at higher frequency would look like Fig. 3-8. In the figure, C' 
is the equivalent lumped shunt feed-through capacitance and L' is the 
equivalent lumped leakage inductance of the winding. If we wished to max-

Fig. 3-8. High frequency parasitics of an inductor. 
imize the parasitic self-resonant frequency of our inductor we would proceed 
as follows: 
The leakage inductance of a cylindrical solenoid of radius r (em), winding 
build .6 (em), length b (em) is 
(3 .14) 
where J.l.O = 411' X w- 9 Hy/cm. The equivalent shunt capacitance is 
c~ 
(3 .15) 
where t r is the dielectric constant of the layer insulation, to = 8.85 x 10- 14 
F/cm (the permitivity of free space), Sis the thickness of insulation between 
turns in em, and .6 (the winding build) in em is just .6 = N(t + s), where tis 
the conductor thickness. 
The self-resonant frequency is proportional to the L 1 C' product. 
The characteristic impedance is Z 0 = .J L/ c; so L I = Z 0 2C' . Z 0 may also 
be seen to be the load impedance seen by the winding. Taking S as our 
variable, the L I C' product is smallest where

There is a lower self-resonant frequency involving the shunt capacitance 
and the inductance of the inductor itself at that frequency. In tape-wound 
cores, eddy current losses tend to short out the upper resonance. In ferrite 
core inductors this resonance may dominate the resonance discussed above. 
Note that for this concept to be meaningful, we have to have some under-
standing of the impedance seen by the winding. The higher the load im-
pedance, the higher the allowable leakage inductance and the less desirable 
the shunt capacitance. A flyback transformer may find itself disconnected 
from the driver at intervals, as would pulse width modulated inverter trans-
formers. An RC snubber would be used to damp the oscillations, and here 
Z 0 would tie related to R (preferably somewhat higher). This should facili-
tate the design of dissipative snubbers, the tradeoff between transformer 
parasitics and snubber power loss becomes apparent and can be dealt with in 
a predictable manner. This saves much "cut and try" time and permits rapid 
evolution of potential designs. 
In some circuit design situations the apparent self-resonant frequency of 
an inductor can be extended by placing a much smaller inductor, usually on a 
ferrite core, in series with the main inductor. This also has the effect of filter-
ing out the higher frequency components that could cause eddy current 
"losses" and attendant high frequency feed-through in the larger choke, al-
lowing the use (sometimes) of less expensive core material in the larger 
choke. These eddy current losses (and thermal core loss as such) comprise the 
shunt resistance of Fig. 3-1 shown as R cÂ· It corresponds to the parallel 
resistance representing core loss in Chapter 1, Fig. 1-l. 
8. SWINGING CHOKES 
In many applications it is desired that only a certain minimum inductance be 
maintained in an inductor, and that this inductance minimum gets less as the

current through the inductor increases. An example is input filter chokes in 
which only a certain critical inductance need be maintained for the choke to 
look like a choke-input filter over a range of operating currents. There are a 
number of methods of obtaining such performance. Core materials with a 
relatively large coercive force, such as grain-oriented silicon steel, behave ac-
ceptably as swinging chokes over a limited range. For higher frequency ap-
plications, molypermalloy powder cores are available from a number of 
manufacturers. High flux density powder cores are available from 
Magnetics, Inc. 
Molypermalloy powder (MPP) cores are very useful in a variety of DC 
filter applications. They are toroids, with effective permeabilities from a few 
tens to a few hundreds. They have in effect a distributed gap, eliminating the 
proximity effect of a gapped inductor heating up turns near the gap, and they 
can tolerate DC coercive forces in the range of 10-100 Oersteds. Simple DC 
filter reactors may be fabricated with a minimum of design work. On the 
other hand, they are toroids, and as such their parasitic capacitance can not 
easily be controlled. Toroids almost invariably have higher feed-through 
capacitance than layer-wound structures onE or U cores. In high frequency 
converters, the shunt capacitance in the energy storage reactor must be 
charged and discharged each cycle, and external snubbers* are often neces-
sary to damp the ringing associated with inductor parasitic capacitance. 
In most modern converters and inverters, chopping frequencies are in the 
range of 30-300 kHz, and the self-resonant frequencies of the associated 
inductors should be on the order of 1-30 mHz or higher. High frequency 
power processors will have abnormally high switching losses unless great 
care is taken to minimize the feed-through capacitance of power reactors. 
If one asks "How much capacitance is too much?" the answer is simply 
to set an allowable power loss limit, and then calculate Yz CV'2j. 
In toroidal inductors of a single layer, the dominant shunt capacitance is 
not turn-to-turn, but from the beginning turns to the core and thence to the 
ending turns. 
The permalloy powder cores have a very thin insulating coating and the 
capacitance can be relatively high. If this type of core is to be used the 
designer would do well to add a layer of some dielectric tape over the core to 
increase the spacing from winding to core. If it is compatible with other pro-
cessing requirements, Teflon, FEP, or polypropylene tapes would be pre-
ferred, as they have dielectric constants of about 2. With negligible AC core 
loss, non-adhesive-coated fiberglass cloth tape could be used, as the air

spaces between the fiberglass strands would give an effective dielectric con-
stant of perhaps 1.5. Increasing the average turn-to-core spacing from a few 
mils to a few tens of mils can do wonders for the feed-through capacitance of 
such designs. For lowest feed-through capacitance, layer-wound coils of 
magnet wire or foil would be preferred, where the winding geometry can be 
closely controlled and the turns nearer the core provide shielding for those 
farther away from the core. The dominant feed-through capacitive compo-
nent then becomes the layer-to-layer capacitance, and not only is thicker 
layer insulation used to reduce the capacitance, but higher core flux density 
is used to reduce the number of turns (and the copper loss!), thus leaving 
more of the core winding area available for insulation. It should not be con-
sidered unusual in high frequency magnetic component design, where 
capacitance is a critical problem, for the copper space factor to drop down to 
the 0.1-0.2 range. 
For applications in which the range of inductance variation with current 
approximates linearity over a current range of more than about three to one, 
or in which molypermalloy powder toroids are not suitable, there are anum-
ber of other options, all of which amount to constructing a series set of reac-
tors which saturate at different current levels. One can obtain an inductance 
which drops linearly (with a slope of -1) with increasing current, or slopes of 
- Vz or -2 or whatever may also be obtained. Instead of actually winding 
separate reactors and putting them in series, we can use the same winding 
and let it encompass magnetic circuits with varying gaps. In this manner we 
obtain a structure where, at high currents, the portion of the core with little 
gap will saturate (giving a very low permeability for its portion of the core 
area), while the remaining portion of the core area (which has a greater gap) 
may not be saturated and provides the desired level of inductance. 
A design procedure would be to design a choke for the lowest inductance 
needed at the highest DC current. For that number of turns, find the addi-
tional core area and gap for the higher inductance required at the lower cur-
rent. Increase the width of the core to give the additional area and gap that 
new portion appropriately less. One continues in steps, depending on how 
smooth one wishes the inductance-versus-current characteristic to be. In the 
actual fabrication of the design, one could use C-cores with identicalÂ£, F, 
and G dimensions and different D dimensions, placing them side by side in 
the common coil. The inductor can be placed on a stack of E-1 laminations 
with butt gaps or even a wedge-shaped piece of gap material in the gap 
region. Fig. 3-9 shows a stack of E-1 laminations with gaps of several dif-
ferent thicknesses; Fig. 3-10 shows a stack of E-1 laminations with a wedge 
in the gap.

Core

Fig. 3-10. Core with linearly graded gap. 
In higher frequency applications where ferrites might be desirable because 
of their low core loss, some number of cores could be assembled in parallel 
with a common coil wound around all of them. Each core would have a dif-
ferent thickness of gap material (shown in Fig. 3-9 or 3-10). Another 
method is to take a standard ferrite core and grind the gap region to produce 
a nonuniform air space across the width of the gap. In the case of a pot core, 
a contour could be ground on the face of the center leg. In the case of ferrite 
U-cores, for convenience of assembly the outer edges of the cores would be 
left in contact or separated by the minimum gap, and the middle portion con-
tour ground as shown in Fig. 3-11 . 
Calculation of performance of such nonlinearly gapped structures is 
relatively tedious. It consists of integrating the contribution of inductance 
for each increment of gap height across the width of the core face. In the case 
of a core such as a stack of laminations with two or three separate thick-
nesses of gap, it is a simple matter to calculate the inductance of each of the 
inductors and add them. 
In the case of a stack of laminations with a wedge-shaped piece of gap 
material, one must once again perform an integration in order to calculate 
Fig. 3-11. Ferrite core with step-ground face.

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
the actual inductance. As current increases, progressively more of the core 
saturates and may be assumed to have permeability of one. The remaining 
unsaturated portions of the core, together with the total number of turns on 
the reactor, then gives the inductance remaining at that current level. This is 
oversimplified. The saturated permeability is more likely to be on the order 
of 5-20, and the flux from the larger portion of the gap will fringe out into 
the narrow gap regions where the material is saturated. The simplest method 
of obtaining a finished design for a swinging choke is to calculate what will 
do the job, test it, and modify the design accordingly. As one gains ex-
perience, the first design will come acceptably close to the design re-
quirements more frequently. 
Methods of machining ferrites to obtain nonuniform gaps are discussed in 
Chapter 9. 
In inductors with relatively large gaps (comparable to the distance from 
the core to the first turn) the fringing flux from the gap has a component 
perpendicular to the winding conductor and therefore induces surface eddy 
currents, especially in foil-wound coils. These may be greatly reduced by 
bevelling the gap. The fringing flux can never be totally eliminated. It can be 
greatly reduced by using a bevel angle of 45Â° and a bevel depth of about 2-4 
times the length of the gap. This is only an approximate rule of thumb-ex-
act calculations are very difficult. Spacing the winding away from the core 
obviously helps, but just as obviously eats up valuable winding space. 
Since the fringing flux occupies volume outside of the gap between core 
faces, it reduces the effective gap length by increasing the effective core area 
at the gap, and increases the inductance over that calculated from our for-
mulas (which ignore fringing). One could choose a bevel angle, say 45Â° to 
start, and then increase the bevel depth until the measured inductance was 
equal to the calculated inductance. Then at least half of the fringing flux 
would be pulled into the gap. Increasing the bevel depth to obtain equal in-
crements of decreasing inductance would give roughly equal increments of 
reduction in the fringing flux, and corresponding reductions in the eddy cur-
rent losses due to this proximity effect. In critical situations one may have to 
initially design the inductance somewhat high to allow for the core face 
bevelling necessary to obtain very low levels of eddy current damping and 
losses. Many separate smaller (distributed) gaps are also used. 
9. RESONANT CHARGING REACTORS 
The design of resonant charging reactors (for energy storage capacitors, 
pu1se-forming networks, and the like) is an application of inductors that 
deserves special consideration. The reactor contains both an AC flux campo-

nent due to the impressed voltage, and a DC flux component due to the DC 
current flowing through it. The designer must budget a portion of the core's 
flux capacity to handle each flux component. The division of flux between 
AC and DC components in this application is not obvious. 
With reference to Fig. 3-12, assuming the capacitor initially discharged 
and + E voltage applied instantaneously, we see that the voltage across the 
reactor reverses during the charging cycle, while the current is a unidirec-
tional half-sine pulse. 
The resonant charging time is one-half the resonant period of the charging 
reactor and the load capacitor, chosen by the designer to give a required 
charging time for the given load capacitance. 
The charging period is given by T = 1n/LC. The angular frequency w is of

This form allows the designer to conveniently calculate I for circuit design 
purposes. For purposes of the derivation, we will use Eq. (3.20a) since we 
seek an expression independent of L or C explicitly. 
The DC flux through the reactor reaches a peak at half the charging 
period, while the AC flux (the integral of reactor voltage over time) reaches a 
maximum at half the charging period and then decreases. During the first 
half of the charging period the AC and DC flux add, and the maximum flux 
density in the core is reached at half the charging period. The peak flux den-
sity due to the AC component may be found by integrating the voltage over 
half the charging period:

For this application we discover that our geometric figure of merit is iden-
tical to that for inductors and transformers. In order to obtain a realizable 
design one would take our circuit-defined parameters, select a B maJo and 
plug them into Eq. (3.12) to obtain the required value of D 2E 2FGI U. Bear in 
mind that B max can be somewhat on the high side, as the AC core loss is that 
due to 45o/o of B maxâ¢ albeit at the high end of the loop closer to saturation. 
Then, determine the construction type (I, II, or III) and consult the com-
puter runs for a value of D 2E 2FGI U for a suitable form factor. That 
D 2 Â£ 2 FG/ U value is for a normalized core, just as before for transformers 
and chokes. One then forms the ratio of D 2E 2FG/ U for the normalized core 
and D 2E 2FG/ U for the actual requirement. 
The ratio obtained is K 5, the denormalization constant. K is then ob-
tained, and each of the dimensions of the normalized core is multiplied by K. 
That gives the dimensions of the denormalized core for the actual applica-
tion. 
We now have a core area, and using Eq. (3.28) we obtain turns. The induc-
tance follows from Eq. (3.19), and the gap follows from those data and Eq. 
(3.26). 
We have seen in this chapter some very interesting conclusions. There is an 
optimization criterion for inductors which have a flux density derived from 
DC operating conditions. When both AC and DC operating conditions are 
combined, as in resonant charging reactors, we have the same optimization 
criterion. For transformers where winding loss only is considered, we have 
the same optimization criterion. All linear magnetic components fall into 
one of these three classes (even pulse transformers!). It would therefore ap-
pear that the power-handling ability at constant resistive loss can be im-
proved for any such component by choosing core dimensions which max-
imize the D 2E 2FGI U figure of merit within the volume given for that compo-
nent. At operating voltages where dielectric stress is significant, or at fre-
quencies where capacitance, leakage inductance or core properties 
(permeability, core loss, interlaminar voltage stress) must be considered, it 
will become necessary to deviate from this criterion. It is nonetheless an ex-
tremely useful concept.

1. INTRODUCTION 
You may recall that in a conventional transformer some relationship be-
tween turns, voltage, core area, and frequency determined the flux density in 
the core. That flux density was either set as high as possible or chosen to give 
some desired level of core loss. 
We can no longer deal with these concepts on such a simplistic level. As far 
as the transformer is concerned, the applied voltage across some number of 
turns reduces to an awareness of volts per turn. This causes a magnetic field 
(flux) which increases at a rate depending on the magnitude of the voltage 
per turn around the core. Another way of saying this is that a space rate of 
change of an electric field can give rise to a time rate of change of a magnetic 
field. This observation forms part of the basis of Maxwell's equations, the 
most profound advance of physics in the nineteenth century. A time rate of 
change of a magnetic field can also cause a space rate of change of an electric 
field, which is why one winding can induce a voltage in another. 
The lower the frequency, the more time one-half cycle will take, and the 
more time there is for the flux to increase. 
The flux is the total flux inside the area of the coil. The smaller that area, 
the greater the flux density. It will appear that a current is required to drive 
the core through a flux excursion. In fact, it is the volt-second product 
developed across the winding by that current which causes a change in flux, 
and this relates back directly to Maxwell's equations. The current required to 
cause this is simply a consequence of the properties of the empty space or the 
material filling that space. 
We see now that we can look on a coil of wire wound around a core as a 
volt-second integrator. This is true whether we have one or more windings, 
76 

NONLINEAR MAGNETICS 
77 
and regardless of the circuit function. The product of voltage impressed and 
elapsed time (or the integral of voltage over time, more exactly) is stored in 
the core as the flux density at the end of that period of elapsed time. Depend-
ing on the application, or the design approach taken to that application, it 
may be more useful to approach the design in terms of voltage, time, and 
total integrated flux. The end result will be the same. The difference is one of 
viewpoint taken on a problem for the purpose of solving that problem. 
No magnetic material has an infinite capacity for information storage, 
and this implies that sooner or later our core material will run out of flux 
capacity. When this happens, the material is said to saturate. Saturation is 
seen as a gradual onset of the condition, or sometimes as a relatively abrupt 
transition. At or beyond this point, the continued presence of a voltage 
across the winding gives no further increase in the flux stored in the core. In 
point of fact, the flux in the core does increase, but only at 10-3-10-6 as 
rapidly as before, as the core in saturation has a permeability which is ap-
proaching one. When the impressed voltage is removed, the flux density in 
the core falls back to a residual value. This is shown in Fig. 4-1 for both 
square-loop and round-loop materials. For fairly decent square loop 
materials Bresidual/ Bmax would be above 0.90, approaching 1.0. For round 
loop materials Bresidual/ Bmax would be perhaps on the order of 0. 7. 
For the material of Fig. 4-1 (a), this is similar to introducing a gap into the 
magnetic circuit. Note that the material is still "square loop material" and 
the loop width is still the same, but the loop has been "sheared over," giving 
a much lower Bresidual/ Bmax while retaining the loop width and linearity of 
the square loop material. 
To see the effect of core saturation on a transformer we can look at the 
equivalent circuit of a transformer. (See Fig. 4-2). Before the core saturates, 
the impedance of LP is usually much higher than R1. or any of the series im-
pedances, so very little of the current from the source is diverted. Most is 
delivered to the load. 
When the core saturates, the impedance of Lp becomes much less than RL, 
preferably even much less than the series impedances. Under these condi-
tions most of the current from the source is diverted by Lp sat and very little 
flows thorugh the load. 
2. BASIC APPLICATIONS 
Figure 4-2 applies to a transformer (or inductor) in which the winding is 
across the lines carrying current to and from the load. When saturable 
magnetic devices are used to control the flow of power from a source to a

load, it is customary (for efficiency purposes) to place the saturable core in 
series with source and load. In this case we have the equivalent circuit of Fig. 
4-3. 
In both suppressed second harmonic and proportional phase control cir-
cuits, the power flows from the reactors to the load. In a suppressed second 
harmonic circuit, one core is always unsaturated and the other saturated (as

long as the circuit is in its linear region), but the output phase is shifted in 
single-phase systems by the reactors driving current back into the source for 
a portion of each cycle. High frequency inverters driving such regulators 
must be capable of handling bidirectional power flow. 
In proportional phase control circuits, one core is saturated; the other core 
is unsaturated at first and then saturates. Then power flows from source to 
load for the remainder of that half-cycle. 
In the suppressed second harmonic circuits, the reactors take turns being 
out of saturation, acting as DC-to-AC current transformers, and constant 
AC current control elements. 
In proportional phase control circuits, the reactors act as switches. In both 
cases the saturated inductance L 1 appears in series with source and load. The 
effects of L 1 can be far more deadly than that of Rp, with its simple resistive 
loss and consequent temperature rise. L 1 is not only the leakage inductance 
of the winding due to its nonzero radial build over the bare core dimensions; 
it is the inductance of the coil without a core (the "air core" inductance) 
multiplied by a number ranging from 1 (with luck) to perhaps 10 (the saturated 
permeability of the core). At load or control currents sufficient to give 
perhaps 100 times the loop width in Oersteds (manufacturer's data B-H loop 
plots), almost any material will have a saturated permeability approaching 
one. However, at a mere ten times overdrive, the nickel alloys begin to come 
close to 1; some ferrites may also, but 4 mil and 12 mil Z-type silicon steel 
may have effective permeability on the order of 5. This can be exceedingly in-
convenient. The saturation inductance drops the supply voltage at high load 
.currents and limits the maximum power transfer. The solution to having a 
design which is close, but has too much saturation inductance, is to go to the 
squarest possible core material affordable. Then raise the core area and 
reduce the number of turns as much as possible. Since the inductance goes 
down as the square of the turns, one need only hold the product of turns and 
core area constant. The overall effect will be that the saturation inductance 
goes down roughly linearly with decreasing turns. In many cases it also helps 
to make the minimum and maximum magnetic circuit lengths close, so the 
entire core saturates more abruptly. 
Carried to extremes, this can lead to ridiculous geometries. One must 
maintain a sense of proportion. 
As we reduce the number of turns we also reduce the unsaturated induc-
tance of the saturable reactor. That controls the amount of power which 
leaks from the reactors in their off state and appears across the load when the 
control circuitry says "deliver zero power to the load." The usual procedure 
to trim in an existing design with excessive saturation inductance is to reduce 

NONLINEAR MAGNETICS 
81 
the number of turns to get the desired saturation inductance. (On C-core 
designs the air core inductance can be halved by putting half the turns on 
each leg of the C-core, since the coils become decoupled as the permeability 
drops.) Then check the off-state inductance. On toroids a particular material 
or permeability may have to be specified, or the strip width raised while 
reducing the inside diameter and strip build. On silicon steel C-cores one 
would raise the off-state inductance by very carefully lapping the core faces 
on a sheet of #400 silicon carbide paper on a surface plate or a sheet of heavy 
plate glass, then clean the faces with solvent. Nickel alloy C-cores are much 
softer, more difficult to lap, and may require their faces to be etched. Such 
processes are best left to the manufacturer. Bond with an epoxy adhesive 
which is free of fillers or pigments, clamping tightly or passing a current 
through the coil until cured. A smooth radius on the edges of the core faces 
rather than a square edge or 45Â° chamfer will increase the bond strength 
significantly. With these techniques one can achieve a control range of, for 
example, 10 ~H to 600 mH for a 10 kW, 400Hz control reactor using 4 mil 
Z-type silicon steel. At an on/off ratio of 60,000: 1 this would be doing very 
well indeed. 
3. "MAGNETIC AMPLIFIERS" 
Saturable inductive components are capable of performing many tasks no 
other component can, with great simplicity and reliability. A few examples 
will be discussed. The first (the main control element in a power processing 
system) was the most popular some years ago, but has unjustly fallen out of 
favor because of a lack of current awareness and the advent of high speed, 
high power switching transistors. Semiconductor power control circuits are 
usually smaller, lighter, more complex, more fragile, and less reliable. It is 
occasionally useful to have magnetics as an option for trading off these 
parameters. 
The first basic type of "magnetic amplifier" or saturable reactor control 
circuit gives an output waveform theoretically identical to that obtained by a 
triac or SCR used in a proportional phase control circuit. Referring to Fig. 
4-4, the "firing angle" of the control elements is governed by the control 
current. In the most common application of this configuration, both 
reference and control ampere-turns are much larger than the ampere-turns 
(Oersteds) required to actually swing the cores over their dynamic control 
range. This gives gain in the ratio of the actual control or reference current to 
the control range, since only a very small fraction of the control current at 
threshold (where control and reference currents differ by the control range) 
is needed to control.

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
Figure 4-4(b) is the customary stylized representation of this configura-
tion: two toroids are wound with their AC windings, then placed one on top 
of the other and the DC windings wound over both. It is electronically 
equivalent to Fig. 4-4(c), with the separate windings and phasings shown for 
clarity. The advantage of a DC winding over both cores is that in the case of 
Fig. 4-4(c), each DC winding on each core develops a very high induced 
voltage. The voltages cancel because of the phasing, but each winding has a 
rather high voltage across it, giving insulation problems and necessitating 
some attention to winding capacitance. With a DC control winding going 
through both cores each turn, the induced AC voltages cancel on a turn-by-
turn basis, eliminating the above problems. This geometry also gives less 
leakage inductance between AC and DC windings, which is not so important 
for the phase control configuration. It is more important for the suppressed 
second harmonic configurations. (Apropos of which, note the capacitors on 
the DC windings. They define a low impedance source, so the AC second 
harmonic currents are free to circulate within the DC control windings.) In 
the suppressed second harmonic configuration, the DC control windings are 
fed from a high impedance current source (a series reactor, usually) and se-
cond harmonic currents essentially cannot circulate. A second harmonic 
voltage (for single-phase circuits), or a sixth harmonic voltage (for three-
phase circuits) therefore appears across the reactors. Since this configuration 
functions as a DC-to-AC current transformer, the output voltage waveforms 
to the load are, surprisingly enough, rectangular waveforms. The rise and 
fall times are related to the switching speeds of the saturable reactor cores, 
and in high frequency applications are critically dependent on the shunt 
capacitance in the DC control winding and the isolation reactor. Fig. 4-5 
shows the elementary configuration of a single phase control circuit.

The impedance of the inductor of Fig. 4-5 or the capacitors of Fig. 4-4 are 
of considerable significance. If the inductor of Fig. 4-5 has an impedance of 
less than twice the maximum load impedance, reflected through the square 
of the turns ratio of the reactor, the circuit of Fig. 4-5 loses its current 
transformation characteristic and tends to become a proportional phase con-
trol circuit. A similar transition in the circuit of Fig. 4-4 takes place if the 
source impedance of the DC control windings is allowed to become too high 
due to insufficient capacitance. 
4. THE THREE-PHASE SUPPRESSED SECOND 
HARMONIC SATURABLE REACTOR POWER CONTROLLER 
The three-phase applications of Fig. 4-5 deserve special consideration. 
First,let us consider ad-d system, with a single three-phase transformer and 
the saturable reactors in series with each leg. (See Fig. 4-6.)

Ripple voltage across the choke in series with the bias current supply 
feeding the bias windings is triangular, at six times line frequency and ap-
proximately EAC(Iine~ocNACÂ· 
Now let us consider the situation identical to Fig. 4-7 except that the 
secondary is wye instead of~- This is a~-Y system (Fig. 4-8 and 4-9). Many 
configurations are possible. For the rectifier transformer a single three-phase 
transformer may be used, withY or~ secondaries, or both. In the event that 
both Y and~ secondaries are used they should be separately rectified and the 
individual DC outputs connected in series. Two single three-phase rectifier 
transformers may be used, one with Y and one with ~ secondaries, the 
primaries in parallel and the secondaries handled as above. Three single-
phase transformers may be used, making three single-phase systems. 
The reactors can be inside the primary~. or in the line with either a~ or Y 
primary. They all work except three single-phase transformers with secon-
daries connected Y. Looking from secondary neutral-to-line, that gives three 
in-phase signals at three times line frequency, so there is nothing line-to-line 
to rectify. In all cases where reactors are in the line, line current is 120Â° con-
duction with 60Â° of zero current. With reactors inside a primary ~. 
transformer primary conduction is 180Â°, giving 120Â° conduction in the line. 
Not everything about these configurations has been reduced to a cut-and-
dried set of formulas. (That doesn't prevent us from using the data to deliver

a product!) Consider the case of reactors in the line, a three-phase, four-wire 
Y source, and a three-phase transformer with a Y primary. If the neutrals 
are tied together, a square wave current at three times the line frequency 
flows from neutral to neutral. Saturable reactor conduction goes to 180Â° 
-without changing secondary currents or load currents! This was a situa-
tion the original investigator did not pursue, and which I have not had time 
to. All of my applications to date have been 400Hz and I find ..1 primaries 
more attractive, so I have not needed to pursue the question. 
When one three-phase core is used for the rectifier transformer with 
saturable reactors inside the primary .1, the primary currents are the same for 
Y or ..1 secondary, but the primary voltages are different (Fig. 4-10). The 
wave form with a Y secondary has a better fit inside the line voltage sine wave 
envelope, allowing a closer approach to the load voltage obtained with full 
line voltage on the transformer. One obtains -7211fo with a ..1 secondary, and 
-83% of peak with a Y secondary. Three transformers, making three 
single-phase systems with outputs combined at the DC buss, gives 180Â° con-
duction (and separate bias supplies, giving three times the bias current), but 
180Â° primary voltage (square wave) which fits a sine wave rather poorly, so 
one obtains only -60% of peak line voltage as DC output. 
The basic working relationships are these: Assume all windings, both 
transformer and saturable reactor, are 1 : 1, with a ..1 primary and saturable 
reactors inside the .1. With a three-phase bridge on a ..1 secondary, load cur-

rent is twice bias current and load voltage is peak primary voltage. Using a Y 
secondary, three-phase bridge load current is ~ the bias current and load 
voltage is 1.5 times peak primary voltage. For both .1 andY secondaries and 
equal output voltages, .1leg turns should be 1.5 times Y leg-to-neutral turns 
(note that "-"3has no place here!). There are no off-phase relationships going 
on, so that with Y and .1 secondaries together you still get 6 times line fre-
quency ripple, not 12 times. 
Bias ripple voltage (which appears across the choke) for 1 : I reactors is 
about one-half line voltage at six times line frequency. 
Regulation of current (as load varies from minimum to maximum to 
shorted) is a function of the quality of the iron in the choke. Ordinarily 
grain-oriented silicon steel can give 25Ufo or worse regulation, whereas with 
Z-type silicon steel regulation may approach or exceed 1 Ufo. So, high-Jl 
square loop material is preferred, especially for open-loop current source ap-
plications. 
One interesting point here-since both saturable reactors in each pair 
share the voltage equally, one would think that each reactor need only be 
designed for one-half the AC line voltage. If this is done and the load is 
abruptly shorted, a fault current flows for about one-fourth to one-half cy-
cle. Since semiconductors blow before most fuses or circuit breakers, this is 
an undesirable condition. If the windings on the reactors are designed for 
three-fourths of the line voltage each, this condition seems to vanish and 
there appears to be no fault current when the load is shorted in a three-phase, 
sine-wave excited system. In square-wave excited systems, I would expect a 
fault current for a portion of the cycle unless the reactors were designed for 
full voltage. In any case, the reactors rebalance themselves after one cycle. 
5. OTHER APPLICATIONS 
Another application of saturable magnetics which comes to mind is coupling 
a trigger pulse into a high energy discharge circuit. The specific application 
we will discuss is a series injection trigger transformer for a flash lamp. 
Most flash lamp triggering systems (Fig. 4-11) use series injection (instead 
of parallel) because the triggering energy is more reliably injected into the 
flash lamp, and the trigger transformer itself can perform a pulse-shaping 
function for the flash lamp pulse current. Also, shunt triggering of flash 
lamps is usually accomplished with a wire on the flash lamp exterior and the 
attendant capacitive coupling. It has been found that this causes crazing of 
the flash lamp glass envelope and premature lamp failure. 
At t~o the trigger circuitry generates a high voltage pulse (typically

10-30kV on the secondary) such that the pulse polarity on the lamp is the 
same as the supply polarity. The lamp then breaks down, and a voltage op-
posite to the trigger pulse polarity and equal to the supply voltage appears 
across the secondary. This resets the core to - Bmaxâ¢ taking placing during 
/2. See Fig. 4-12. The flash lamp does not deionize during this brief period, 
since during this time a current (determined by the secondary inductance and 
the volt-second support of the core) flows. At the end of t2 the core is at 

NONLINEAR MAGNETICS 
91 
+B

- Bmaxâ¢ saturates, and a current [determined by the capacitor, the lamp im-
pedance (- 0.5 0), and the air-core inductance of the secondary winding] 
flows during /3 -
t4. The permeability of the core goes to essentially unity as 
it is normally driven to usually more than 1000 Oersteds. At the end of the 
discharge cycle the core is properly reset for another trigger pulse. 
The high energy discharge pulse from the secondary is isolated from the 
primary because the core is saturated (and presumably the primary is not 
physically too close to the secondary). 
The basic idea is that one can couple a signal from one circuit to another, 
and the action of the core saturating decouples the two circuits so some other 
action may take place in one circuit without then being coupled to the other. 
Another use is in pulse sharpening circuits, where one has a relatively slow 
rising pulse and is willing to accept some delay and lose some of the pulse 
width in return for sharpening the leading edge. Since the core is a volt-
second integrator, it can offer a high impedance for some number of volt-
seconds and a low impedance thereafter. If the integrated area of the (slow) 
rise time of the pulse is set roughly equal to the volt-second support of the 
saturable reactor, then one has the beginnings of a viable design. The 
sharpened rise time depends on the switching speed of the core, which in turn 
depends on the core diameter (the smaller, the faster, all other things equal); 
the ID/OD ratio (the closer to unity the faster, all other things equal); the 
drive level (load current times turns gives a multiple of that required to 
saturate the core; the higher the multiple, the faster); the alloy tape 
thickness, switching speed being on the order of the skin depth for unlimited 
available overdrive; and the material properties (some core materials such as 
the high nickel alloys switch faster than others). Since in the unsaturated 
state the reactor has a less-than-infinite inductance, some current will flow 

92 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
through it before it saturates. This will give a pedestal before the leading edge 
of the output pulse, as shown in Fig. 4-13. In most applications, this is not 
objectionable. In high current SCR modulators it is desirable, as priming the 
SCR with a low current before the main load current flows through it allows 
the SCR to turn on more fully, giving greatly reduced switching losses in 
most types of SCRs. 
In some circuits a square wave input is desired. From that, a pulse-width 
modulated output signal is generated, either for use as a variable duty cycle 
control signal or for power regulation purposes with a saturable reactor as 
the pass element. The basic circuit would be that of Fig. 4-4 or one of its 
many variations, such as the self-saturating configuration of Fig. 4-14. The 
reset current in that example is supplied by a feedback amplifier and the sup-
ply voltage is held off by the volt-second support of the core (controlled by 
the DC control circuit) until the core saturates. Current is then passed to the 
Input pulse

load. In higher frequency circuitry this would be most common. The core 
material would be likely to be I mil low nickel or high nickel alloy, or 
possibly one-half mil or even one-fourth mil if frequency and switching 
speed requirements dictated it. 
As a particular case of our first example, let us say that we specifically 
wished to limit the volt-second product or charge coupled from one circuit to 
another, or that we wished to integrate the areas of a number of pulses in a 
pulse train to form a duty-cycle limiter. It might be that a saturable reactor 
or transformer could perform that function more expediently than some 
other method. It depends on the specific application, but should be kept in 
mind as an often viable option. 
6. MATERIAL PROPERTIES 
The max/min ratio of an unsaturated/saturated core gives a max/min induc-
tance ratio which is a vital parameter in determining the performance of the 
finished product. The properties of the core material have a great deal to do 
with the maximum inductance and the attainable ratio. Fig. 4-15 shows a 
few interesting hysteresis loops which show some typical phenomena, and 
are characteristic of most materials. Certain proportions are exaggerated for 
clarity. 
The value of p. at some point between - Bmax and + Bmax is called the in-
cremental permeability (denoted by p.t::,., which is the slope of the B-H curve 
at that point). Recall the discussion of that point in Chapter 3. More rounded 
loop materials or gapped materials would have lower permeabilities and

hence a lower max/min ratio (assuming the core was driven in all cases to 
p. == I) than cores with less or no gap, or some square loop materials. The 
permeability comparison curves in Fig. 4-15 (c,d) show the behavior of some 
typical materials. The magnetizing current waveforms of pulse transformers 
using the core materials of Fig. 4-15(a-d) points out some interesting dif-
ferences between them. 
For the core material of Fig. 4-15(a) the permeability is infinite, hence the 
inductance is infinite and the pulse magnetization current (given by: 
ETIL = /)is zero. 
For the core material of Fig. 4-15(b) the permeability p.fl is constant and 
finite until saturation. Hence the inductance is constant. The pulse 
magnetization current rises linearly with time to saturation, and then rises 
abruptly to a level determined by external circuit impedance levels (Fig. 
4-16). 
For the core materials of Fig. 4-15(c) the permeability near - B or + B is 
much lower than around mid-range, hence the inductance will be lower in

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
The core materials of Fig. 4-15(d) are representative of some square loop 
50 nickel and most square loop 80 nickel alloys in that the incremental 
permeability rises on the average linearly with B. This gives an inductance 
which increases roughly linearly with time, and hence a roughly rectangular 
magnetization current pulse. The observed range of wave forms for this class 
of materials is shown in Fig. 4-18. 
With some square loop high nickel alloys the peak-to-valley ratio of Fig. 
4-18(b) may be somewhat more than 2: 1. 
When one is concerned about the droop on a pulse support capacitor 
because of the pulse current drawn by such a load, the more rectangular cur-
rent pulse wave form will give a more linear (average) droop on the pulse 
support capacitor. It is much easier to cancel out the pulse droop with other 
simple circuitry when the perturbations are linear instead of wildly 
nonlinear. 
Not all materials are specified such that one can in so many words predict 
how round or how square one "round" or "square" loop material is com-
pared to another, but there are several useful published parameters. First, 
look and see whether the manufacturer says anything like "round loop 
material" or "square loop material" or just says "our material." Next, look 
for a Br!Bm ratio, i.e., the ratio of the residual flux density (when the core 
has been driven to saturation and then the drive reduced to zero) to the max-
imum flux density. This is a measure of how flat the top of the loop is. 
Square loop materials should be expected to be above 0.90; round loop 
materials are considerably less than that. 
Next, look for a p. versus B set of curves, such as that in Fig. 4-19 
(reproduced courtesy of Magnetic Metals). Note that some of the materials 
show a much wider excursion of incremental permeability than others. Com-
paring p. at 1000 Gauss with P.maxâ¢ one would expect that Super Square 80,

Square 80, Supermalloy, Square 50, and Supermendur would have pulse 
magnetizing current wave forms somewhat more rectangular than the 
others. In fact, under pulse conditions the magnetizing current waveform 
will correspond to the hysteresis loop of Fig. 4-15(d). The actual material 
from a particular manufacturer will vary somewhat from Jot to Jot, and dif-
ferent manufacturers' "equivalent" materials will also vary in this respect. 
If this characteristic is critical each manufacturer will have to be qualified on 
a lot-by-lot basis. If the core is a small toroid it may be necessary to go to a 
tape-wound bobbin core made by a specialist. 
In any case, do go to several manufacturers and discuss your needs. They 
know what they can do with their materials and annealing cycle variations, 
and most can accommodate special requirements. 
Referring back to Fig. 4-3, we see that we can now draw equivalent cir-
cuits for the saturated and unsaturated states of a saturable reactor in a series 
circuit. Consider the feed-through capacitance as being distributed across 
L'. Then refer to Fig. 4-20.

7. USEFUL RELATIONSHIPS 
There are some useful design equations we shall review. 100Â£T = N'P gives 
the flux and turns required to support a rectangular pulse of E volts for T 
microseconds. Note that 'P is the full flux capacity from - Bmax to + BmaxÂ· 
This relationship is also useful for square wave AC excitation, where ET is 
one-half cycle of the impressed AC waveform. In the event that the im-
pressed waveform is a sine wave, multiply the RMS value by 1.11 to obtain 
the average value, which is the amplitude of a rectangular waveform of equal 
volt-seconds. (RMS stands for root mean square, which is the effective 
heating value of the waveform. The RMS current is the square root of the 
product of the peak current and the average current.) 
The flux capacity of a core in Maxwells, herein called <1>, is the product of 
the change in flux density in Gauss and the net core area in square cen-
timeters. A core which saturates at 8000 Gauss may swing from - 8000 to 
+ 8000 Gauss. If its area were one square centimeter, it would have a flux 
capacity of 16,000 Maxwells. 
The coercive force in Oersteds resulting from a certain number of ampere-
turns on a core is given by 0.4 1rNI = HI, where I is the mean magnetic path 
length of the core in em, I in amperes, and N is in turns. A table of 
millampere-turns required to give one Oersted of drive on various core sizes 
follows (Table 4-1), along with graphs of switching speed versus drive level

NoTE: These numbers are theoretical, for a core with unity OD/ID ratio. For a real core with finite radial 
build, I is higher for the last wrap of alloy than the first, and hence His higher. Taking the ID dimension 
in the table for the OD of the core we would come closer to reality. Recognize also that the core does not 
saturate all at once; the inside goes first and saturation progresses radially outward to the outside wrap of 
the core. If switching speed is critical, a core with ID/00 ratio as close to unity as practical should be 
used.

stability, and permeability of the nickel alloys are superior to those of fer-
rites, but cost rises exponentially with decreasing tape thickness. At very 
high frequencies it may turn out for a particular design situation that the 
high performance of a bobbin-core design (smaller size, less leakage induc-
tance, etc.) will justify the cost. At extremely fast core switching speeds, the 
alloy thickness should be comparable to the skin depth of the frequency 
associated with the output rise time (core switching time). The skin depth in 
mils is roughly 4.4...rt; with 1 in microseconds. 
9. A DESIGN EXAMPLE 
Now let us look at a design example. Say we are designing a Jensen circuit 
DC-AC inverter and need to construct our own feedback transformer T 2Â· 
(See Figure 4-22.) We have decided from various criteria associated with the 
switch transistors that we want the fall time of /2 (switching time) to be 0.1 
p.s. R2 will provide the switching drive while not dropping too much of the 
feedback voltage due to the base drive current passed by R !Â· Let us try a 1 : 1 
: 1 turns ratio for 12. We are given that the current to each transistor is 2 
amps, and we decide that 5 volts on each winding of /2 will make the base 
currents sufficiently independent of temperature for this application. 
We need to determine now how much higher than 5 volts V Fmust be, the 
value of R2, and the design of 12 itself. Our frequency is 33 kHz, so one-half 
period takes 15 p.s. We have to try something and see where we are, because 
core area and turns determine volt-second support, while turns and the 
short-circuit current, through R 2 , and the mean magnetic circuit length of 
the core determine switching speed. In a nutshell, we have too many 
variables and need to home in slowly on the design.

Fig. 4-22. A simple DC-AC inverter circuit. 
Since cost rises rapidly with flux for thin gauge bobbin cores, try a modest 
core of 100 Maxwells and see where this leads us: 
IOOET = Ncf> 
gives 
100 X 5 x 15 = lOON 
N = 75. 
This looks somewhat high from experience, but let us look into it further. 
For a Y. in. groove width (consulting a tape-wound bobbin core manufac-
turer's catalog, we find that this amount of flux capacity can easily be put in 
a bobbin core of 0.375 nominal ID and finished dimensions of 0.335 ID, 
0.478 OD, 0.175 height. We decide to wind the primary and both secondaries 
three-in-hand. With a 40o/o area utilization we have 112,000 circular mils 
multiplied by 0.4 for net copper area and divided by 225, the total number of 
turns, to obtain a wire area of 200 circular mils, which is #27. The mean 
length of turn is rougly 0.8 in., assuming the build over the core is one-third 
the inside diameter. The total length of each winding is then 5 ft., and the DC 
resistance of each winding is Y. ohm, and at two amperes of load current we 
lose 0.5 volt each in the primary and the secondary. Power dissipation is two 
watts, a bit high. 

NONLINEAR MAGNETICS 
103 
If R2 were 2.5 ohms and V2 therefore 10 volts, our power dissipation in R2 
would be 10 watts plus the excess l 2R Joss during the period the core was 
saturated, roughly the storage time of the transistors. If storage time turned 
out to be 0.5/Ls, then for 30Jo of the time power would be 40 watts, for an 
average power dissipation of about 11.2 W. The maximum current available 
from R2 is 4 amperes, and for this core I = 3.2 em, so 0.471" x 
75 X 4 -o- 3.2 = H. 
Our peak drive capability is therefore 117.8 Oersteds, and we estimate that 
even 1 mil 50 nickel would be fast enough. We are, however, asking for a 
Ill/ !l T of 40 amps per microsecond, and the saturation inductance of our 
primary winding will limit that. The saturation inductance we can estimate 
by unrolling the toroid into a long thin cylinder of mean radius 0.5 em, 
length 3 em, and use the air core inductance formula [Eq. (6.1), Chapter 6]. 
Assuming very optimistically that the saturated permeability is unity, 
L ::::: 47r X 10- 9 X 0.5 2 X 75 2/3.5 ::::: 5/LH. 
For 10 volts available, E = L(dlld1) gives the rate of rise of current. 
10 = 5(dlld1), for a maximum of two amps per microsecond. At that rate, 
in 0.1 ILS we would have at best 0.2 amps, for a drive level of a bit under 6 
Oersteds. It would appear that a Y. mil high nickel alloy would be required. 
Going back to R2, if it were Y, ohm and V Fwere 7 volts, our average power 
dissipation in R2 would be about two watts plus the additional losses during 
the core saturation interval. We note that saturation inductance will be much 
more of a problem, and our winding resistance is already too high. We could 
fit 200 Maxwells of flux capacity (80 nickel) in our original bobbin dimen-
sions, so let us do that. 
N now becomes 37 turns, and we have room for twice the wire area. Our 
winding resistance is now one-quarter of what it was before, or about 0.06 n. 
At two amperes we drop one-eighth volt in each winding. Our transformer 
primary voltage must then be 5.25 V, and if R 1 is Y, n, then V1 is 6.25 V and 
the peak drive current becomes a bit over 11 amps. The peak core drive level 
is now 159 Oersteds. The saturation inductance is on the order of a quarter 
of the previous level, or 1.25/LH. For 6 volts available, dlldTbecomes 4.8 
amps per microsecond. In 100 ns our current would have risen to only 0.48 
amps, for a drive level of about 7 Oersteds. One-quarter mil 80 nickel will 
switch in about 0.075 microseconds at 7 Oersteds. 
If we wished we could vary the design further; raising R 1 raises its average 
power dissipation. The point of diminishing returns will be where the power 

104 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
lost during the time when lz is saturated is equal to the power dissipation due 
to the load on lz's secondary. If more flux is required the core cost will start 
to go up almost linearly with flux. 
A low frequency, high power saturable reactor would be designed very 
much the same way, except for two items: first, the saturation inductance 
usually appears in series with the load, and the fraction of the input power 
dropped across it must be evaluated; second, the documentation available 
for determining switching speeds of 4 mil and 12 mil alloys is not good, and 
the user may have to personally evaluate a core material experimentally.

CURRENT TRANSFORMERS 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Current transformers, including most oscilloscope current probes, are most 
frequently used to measure the current amplitude and/or waveform in cir-
cuit locations where other measurement techniques are less efficient or less 
practical. 
Measuring the voltage across a sampling resistor or inserting a moving coil 
AC ammeter is often not feasible with very high AC currents, pulse wave-
forms, or circuitry floating at high voltages. Most current sampling resistors 
have more inductance than a fast risetime current transformer. When the 
current is in a circuit floating at high voltage the oscilloscope would have to 
be floated at that voltage, and that is rarely desirable. In high current circuits 
the power loss associated with feasible resistor values is usually inconvenient 
or objectionable. Current transformers are superior in all respects except 
two: where the picosecond rise time of pulses being viewed is too fast for the 
rise time of even the fastest current transformers (in a transmission line 
geometry, of course; one does not obtain such speeds outside of matched 
transmission line systems), or where one needs low frequency response down 
to DC. There are DC "current probes." However, these are not current 
transformers strictly speaking, but Hall-effect devices which use a magnetic 
field to deflect a current flowing through a conductor, developing a 
transverse potential proportional to the magnetic field of the current being 
measured. 
Current transformers can have remarkably low "insertion resistance," 
which is the effective resistance that seems to be in series with the current be-
ing measured due to their presence. Parasitic series inductance and stray 
105 

106 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
capacitance can also be quite low, and are usually insignificant in a properly 
designed application. 
Current transformers have a rise time limitation associated with the wind-
ing structure. There is also a "droop" on the observed waveform associated 
with the inductance of the winding (or other factors), and for current 
transformers with cores there is an ampere-second limitation corresponding 
to the volt-second limitation of conventional transformers with cores. 
2. CHARACTERISTICS 
The action of a current transformer is to attempt to force equal ampere-turns 
in both windings. Thus, for one turn in the current-sampling winding 
(primary) and 100 turns in the current-viewing winding (secondary) one 
views the current to be measured by the voltage the secondary winding 
develops across the load resistor. A schematic of a simple current trans-
former with a core is shown in Fig. 5-l. The inductance L (seen from the

secondary, for convenience) clearly diverts an increasing current with time 
from the load resistor, so that for a rectangular input current waveform the 
output voltage is not rectangular, but droops. 
The output may droop to zero following an exponential curve, or if the 
output volt-second product exceeds the volt-second support capability of the 
core the output waveform will collapse abruptly. 
The high frequency performance of current transformers is limited by a 
leakage inductance associated with the less-than-perfect coupling between 
the secondary winding and the primary (often a wire threaded through the 
hole in the toroid), and by a shunt capacitance across the winding (Fig. 5-2). 
The rise time for C' absent can be limited by the LIR time constant. The 
current source feeding the current transformer will of course attempt to 
develop whatever voltage is necessary to force itself through the inductance 
L', but stray capacitance and the properties of the source will usually limit 
the dvldt the source is capable of generating. Hence, the current through L' 
may not be a faithful representation of the current being sampled unless Ll R 
is much less than the rise time associated with the current pulse to be mea-
sured. A technique for raising the bandwidth of current transformers 
(distributed terminations) will be discussed later. 
For small C' the rise time is approximately the same, but ringing following 
pulse transitions begins to be apparent. If C' becomes too large, the ringing 
will become quite large. For a highly underdamped design with unusually 
large shunt capacitance the rise time becomes limited by the L' C' product. 
3. APPLICATION 
The action of a current transformer in forcing a secondary current equal to 
the primary current reflected through the turns ratio can be used to great ad-
vantage in measuring the current waveform in an AC power line going to 
some circuit. That signal can be fed to some logic or fault-sensing circuitry. 
In that case a unipolar (rectified) waveform is preferred as an input to the 
sensing circuitry. The current transformer forces its current through the rec-

tifier bridge in Fig. 5-3 and develops a unipolar waveform across the sensing 
resistor. 
Current transformers would be designed for the needed inductance 
and/or volt-second support on the secondary winding for the circuit of Fig. 
5-1(a) or Fig. 5-3. Where rise time or wide bandwidth is a consideration they 
should be designed as pulse transformers, with attention to limiting the stray 
capacitance between the winding and the shield covering the entire secondary 
winding. Such a shield is usually necessary to keep noise on the primary wire 
from influencing the sampled voltage waveform. 
4. AIR CORE CURRENT TRANSFORMERS 
There is another type of current sampling device, used mainly in pulsed 
power research, where the currents involved are measured in kiloamperes, 
not amperes, and current rise times are on the order of 109-10 12 amperes per 
second. These devices are called j (pronounced "1-dot") probes, a certain 
type of air core current sampling transformer is known as a Rogowski coil. 
These devices are known as j probes because their output is proportional 
to the rate of change of current with time. The dot over a symbol denotes the 
time derivative of what the symbol represents. They are convenient for a 
number of reasons, and they also have their inconveniences. 
They can literally be calibrated with a ruler. One configuration of an j 
probe is shown in Fig. 5-4. The coaxial transmission line is connected across 
the gap on the inside. The output voltage for such a configuration is 
P.O = 471' X w- 9 Hy/cm. 
(5.1) 

CURRENT TRANSFORMERS

In order to see the actual waveform, we must integrate it. Integrating the 
derivative of something gives us back that something, multiplied by some 
constant factors. One would take the output of Fig. 5-4, develop it across a 
resistance equal to the transmission line impedance, and then run that trans-
mission line to a location where the measurement was to be done and in-
tegrate it there, as in Fig. 5-5. Radiated noise picked up by the cable in tran-
sit is filtered out by the integration. The restored waveform is then the 
original current waveform, with some droop present due to the finite time 
constant of the integrator.

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
The rise time capability of such devices can be literally limited by the break-
down voltage capability of the transmission line, but the output voltages are 
quite low. A device of moderate dimensions ( w = Y, in., r 2 = Y, in.) sampling 
a IOO ampere, I microsecond pulse, with a IOO microsecond time constant in-
tegrator (for I %/microsecond droop) may only have a IO millivolt output. 
That is a high impedance output, suitable for connection to an oscilloscope 
preamp input, but definitely not a 50 ohm transmission line. To measure 
nanosecond rise times one may have to use a sampling oscilloscope (assum-
ing a repetitive waveform) and construct a cathode follower to buffer the 50 
ohm sampling preamp input impedance from the integrator. 
When measuring 10,000 amperes instead of 100 amperes, one can afford 
to divide the integrator output down with a fairly large resistance (perhaps 
5000 ohm) and a 50 ohm resistor to obtain a voltage developed across an im-
pedance which matches a transmission line impedance. This is vital if one 
wishes to propagate a fast rising pulse from anywhere to anywhere and main-
tain pulse fidelity. 
Instead of a droop due to the inductance of a winding, the result is a droop 
due to the integrator time constant. For, say, a desired I C1fo droop, the in-
tegrator time constant would be selected to be IOO times the width of the 
pulse being measured. An electrostatic shield around the device is often nec-
essary. 
Where an output signal of at least millivolts is needed to measure tens or 
hundreds of amperes, one may take the (ruler-calibrated) nonmagnetic, non-
conductive winding form of dimensions lr It r 2, w I and wind upon it a wind-
ing of N turns. Such structures are called Rogowski coils. The output of a 
Rogowski coil is then N times the output of the single-turn structure of Fig. 
5-4. However, there will be a rise time associated with the interwinding 
capacitance, the interturn capacitance, and the stray capacitance to the 
shield. 
A rough estimate of the rise time of such a structure may be obtained from 
t r = !.2ND nanoseconds, where D is the mean winding diameter in inches 
(the mean of the r 1 -
rz difference and w). 
For these types of i probes as well as conventional current transformers 
one may extend the bandwidth considerably by using a distributed termina-
tion. The winding of N turns may be divided into K portions, and the ter-
mination resistor divided by K. Each NIK turns is then terminated by RIK 
ohms, with all such terminated windings connected in series (Fig. 5-6). The 
total number of secondary turns is still Nand the termination resistance is 
still R, but the rise time has been improved by a factor of K.

In practice one rapidly runs into a nonlinear rise time improvement, 
because each winding rides on top of the pulse output of the previous wind-
ings, and the stray capacitance of each winding shunts high frequency com-
ponents of the waveform. This minor detail can be handled by isolating each 
winding's stray capacitance with a common mode choke (Fig. 5-7). The 
common mode chokes would usually be a few turns on a very small ferrite 
toroid, since they need only support the voltsecond product associated with a 
fraction of the risetime and the output pulse amplitude. 
It should therefore be possible to obtain increased outputs from single-

turn i probes (or multiturn coils with distributed terminations) by using 
pulse transformers to amplify the voltages associated with the i signal. Since 
the pulse transformers need only have a volt-second support to handle rise 
and fall time signals, they will usually be small ferrite toroids. Note, how-
ever, that their rise times must be much faster than the rise time of the i 
signal in order to faithfully reproduce it. 
Some of the previously discussed techniques can be combined by con-
structing a single-turn i probe and distributing a number of pulse 
transformers around its periphery (Fig. 5-8). Here one has a number of 
small )Julse transformers (usually on ferrite toroids, with modest step-up 
turns ratios, perhaps 1 : 5) with common mode chokes on the output of each, 
and series-connected terminated windings. It would usually be preferable to 
have the resistance terminations electrically closest to the transmission line 
output, with the common mode chokes between the windings and the ter-
minations. 
In Fig. 5-8, assuming five 1 : 5 pulse transformers, 25 times the output of a 
single-turn i probe would be obtained. With careful design the rise time 
should approach the rise times of the small step-up transformers, which

CURRENT TRANSFORMERS

must have volt-second support capabilities sufficient to handle the i signal 
from the main current probe. 
Larger amplitude signals can also be obtained with nanosecond rise times 
by summing the outputs of appropriate impedance transmission lines. Fur-
ther information on i probes and Rogowski coils may be found in Baum 
(1978) and Sower (1981).

PULSE. TRANSFORMERS 
1. INTRODUCTION 
If many electronics engineers regard magnetics design as a black art, then it is 
also true that many transformer engineers regard pulse transformer design in 
the same way. The reason is that a pulse transformer must faithfully 
reproduce the high frequency components of the leading edge of a rec-
tangular input step, the low frequency components of the flat top of the 
pulse, and all frequencies in between. At the same time it must present to the 
source and load appropriately balanced parasitic components whose 
characteristic impedances match the source and load impedances. 
The designer who has worked mainly with power transformers and induc-
tors is usually ill-prepared to deal with the complex and demanding addi-
tional design criteria which a good pulse transformer design requires. It 
should meet broadband frequency response criteria while maintaining the 
proper ratio of leakage inductance to parasitic capacitance. It should also be 
simple to fabricate, and as small, light, and inexpensive as is possible within 
some given limit of available engineering time and budget! 
It is true that a great deal of experience and involved calculations are 
needed to accurately predict the performance of a design. It is even more dif-
ficult to develop the best design for a given requirement. 
It turns out that it is not too difficult to get within a factor of two on pulse 
rise time the first time out. If one knows what the relevant design equations 
are and can make an informed choice from among the several basic design 
types, almost anyone can design pulse transformers that work. 
In order to introduce the reader to this area gently, we shall start with a 
consideration of air core pulse transformers, since these are the simplest. 
Later, we shall introduce ferromagnetic cores and their attendant advan-
tages and disadvantages.

2. AIR CORE PULSE TRANSFORMERS 
An air core pulse transformer has four major parasitic components: a total 
leakage inductance referred to the primary, an effective shunt capacitance 
referred to the primary, a series resistive component, and a primary induc-
tance (Aslin, 1977). These are represented schematically in Fig. 6-1. In real-
ity there is a primary leakage inductance between R5 and L; this will reduce 
the voltage gain if that primary leakage inductance is not much less than the 
primary inductance. 
For the case of a foil-wound pulse transformer, where each turn is the full 
width of the transformer, and each turn has insulation between it and the 
turn beneath, the geometric parameters are defined for a typical design in 
Fig. 6-2. The primary inductance of such a configuration is given by

One may view the air core transformer as a distributed or lumped L-C net-
work, which has a certain characteristic impedance and rise time. Since we 
have equations which express those distributed parameters as lumped 
parameters referred to the primary, it is a simple matter to derive expressions 
for the input impedance of our "transmission line" and its rise time into a 
matched load (output impedance equals input impedance times the square of 
the turns ratio).

3. CONSIDERING A DESIGN 
Let us say that we were interested in designing a transformer with a 1 : 5 turns 
ratio, an input impedance of 8 ohms, and a rise time of 10 nsec (nano-
seconds), to handle a 50 nsec wide pulse. Let us say that for reasons of dielec-
tric strength we had selected S = 0.05 em, and for current carrying capacity 
we had selected a secondary foil thickness of 0.012 em. Then ll ,. 0.3 em. 
Let us assume a single-turn primary winding and a five-turn secondary wind-
ing, since greater numbers of turns make the rise time more difficult to 
achieve. We find from rise time considerations that r must be on the order of 
3 em to meet our impedance requirements. The width b must be about 1.15 
em. The requirements for L' C' -limited rise time cannot be met if the mean 
winding radius is more than about 3 em. We have not, however, considered 

PULSE TRANSFORMERS 
119 
whether the system rise time might be limited by the leakage inductance and 
the source impedance: 
L' 
Tr = 1.1 R , SO

--~.-1-- = 72 nanohennes (nH) 
is the maximum leakage inductance allowable. Forb of 1.15 em, from Eq.

tl 
" 
1.15 
X 
. 
20.6nH 
so we are safe on that count. The reader might wish to check whether the 
distributed capacitance and the source impedance limit the rise time. 
Unfortunately, this value of L' means that the primary inductance will be 
about 86 nH, and for a 20 kV input the current drawn by the transformer 
primary inductance will increase at the rate of about 234 amperes per 
nanosecond of pulse width, becoming about 12,000 amperes in 50 nano-
seconds. 
It is for this reason that people put cores in transformers-to increase the 
primary inductance from otherwise unacceptably low levels while maintain-
ing specified leakage inductance and shunt capacitance levels. 
4. INTRODUCING THE FERROMAGNETIC CORE 
Let us consider the results of placing 20 square centimeters of ferrite cross-
sectional area in the coil, such that we have a complete magnetic circuit with 
negligible air gap. Typical ferrite materials will have a permeability of 
several thousand times that of a vacuum (47r x 10- 9 Hy/cm), and for this 
geometry a single-turn inductance of perhaps 10 microhenries. As we will see 
later, this inductance, measured well below one megahertz, may not be valid 
for very short pulses. 
The current drawn by our primary inductance is now no more than one-
hundredth the previous level and possibly less, or around 100 amperes for a 
20 kV, 50 nsec input pulse. There is of course a disadvantage. Ferromagnetic 
materials have a limited volt-second support capability, and after a while 
they saturate and the primary current is once again limited only by the air-
core primary inductance. 
If we assume our ferrite has a full flux reset, so that the full height of the 

120 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
B-H loop is available, we can assume a maximum flux density of 8000 gauss. 
The total flux capacity of our core in Maxwells is 4> = BA where B is in 
gauss and A is in square centimeters. 
For A = 20 em 2, our flux capacity is 4> = 8000 x 20 = 160,000 Max-
wells, and the volt second support is given by 100 ET = N4>, where Tis in 
microseconds. For 20 kV input, 
T = 
1 X 120,000 
100 X 20,000 
60 nsec. 
So the design looks viable if our magnetizing current is acceptable and our 
estimate of primary inductance is accurate. The primary load current (20 k V 
into 8 ohms) is 2500 amperes, and diverting 4o/o of that to Lp at pulse end 
gives 4% droop. 
We see that we can meet the design requirements with the possible excep-
tion of an adequately high primary inductance. At this point, if the designer 
is unfamiliar with core properties at these pulse widths he should build two 
units: one with the ferrite core protruding about one-quarter of the coil 
length from each end, and the other with a complete magnetic circuit. He 
should carefully compare the performance of the two at various pulse 
widths. Ferrite U and I cores with 1 sq. in. (6.45 em 2) of cross-sectional area 
are available, and several cores can be assembled together to give the re-
quired area. 
5. WINDING AND EDDY-CURRENT LOSSES* 
Resistance losses in the main windings of saturable inductors in short-pulse 
modulators are markedly influenced by skin and proximity effects in the 
winding conductors. In consequence, both the amount of the loss and the 
optimum winding form are dependent on the duration of the inductor cur-
rent pulse. This dependence is complex; only a few general principles of 
special importance are discussed here. 
Let I w be the average length per turn, ac the conducting-material cross sec-
tion in one turn, and e the resistivity of the wire used in the inductor wind-
ing. The resistance of an N-turn winding is then Nelwi(T/ac), where 11 is a 
coefficient < 1 introduced to account for skin and proximity effects-the

peak value of a half-sine current pulse of duration TsatÂ· (For other 
saturation-interval current waveforms, Tsat is adjusted to an effective value;

122 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
For DC or very low-frequency inductors, the procedure, once a specific 
core has been chosen, is to maximize all by selecting a wire size so that, with 
minimum space lost to insulation, the core window is filled. In short-pulse 
inductors, skin and proximity effects (through their effect on 17) place a prac-
tical limit on all that is often far less than that corresponding to a full core 
window. In consequence the inductor losses are increased, and this increase 
cannot be avoided by using more copper in the winding. In fact, adding con-
ductor cross section is doubly undesirable because it increases both the losses 
and the weight of the inductor. 
One useful form of short-pulse inductor winding comprises a single layer 
of turns arranged to fill the inner perimeter of the core-plus-insulation toroid 
as completely as possible. For some high-voltage windings it maybe possible 
to choose a wire size such that the required number of turns N exactly fills the 
available space. More often, however, to avoid requiring impracticably large 
wire, it is necessary to employ a K-filar winding, where K is an integer chosen 
so that KN strands of convenient size wire fill the space available. For exam-
ple, if K = 4, four strands of wire are laid side by side to form a four-
element "tape," and Nturns of this "tape" are wound on the core. The four 
strands are connected in parallel at each winding terminal; interstrand in-
sulation is necessary only between strands in different turns. It is essential 
that all strands of all turns fit in a single layer against the core insulation, and 
that the available winding space be filled as evenly and completely as possi-
ble. The wire diameter d (of a single strand) is immaterial, provided only that 
it is appreciably greater than the skin depth o-which may be estimated as 
2.61([ me) 112 mils, where f me (in megacycles per second) is taken in the range 
of important frequency components of the current pulse. For current pulses 
of several microseconds duration, o is of the order of 5-10 mils, and d > > o 
for wire strands of moderate size convenient for winding. 
Losses in a single-layer winding are high (relative to losses in a well-
designed low-frequency winding) because a in Eq. (2.25c) is o times the 
conductor-occupied part of the core-plus-insulation inner perimeter, which 
is somewhat less than/. Thus all is at most a few mils for current pulses in the 
several-microsecond range. Unfortunately, the losses cannot be reduced by 
increasing or decreasing wire size in the single-layer winding or, if the condi-
tion d> o is maintained, by providing more conductor cross section in a 
multiple-layer winding. In a d>o multiple-layer winding, the layers of con-
ductors function much as the walls in a waveguide. Each interlayer space 
forms (with the conductors on either side) a substantially isolated small in-
ductor in which losses (associated with skin-depth conduction in layers on 
both sides) are high. 

PULSE TRANSFORMERS 
123 
For short-pulse inductors the only useful alternative to the single-layer 
winding is a multiple-layer construction in which the condition d < < o is 
satisfied for individual strands. Then

where His the magnetic-field intensity in the vicinity of the strand of wire

!lH the increment of H from one side of the strand to the other (caused by 
current in that strand). For strands nearest the core, HI t:.H =:: n, the total 
number of layers of strands in the winding. Thus, if t "" nd denotes the por-
tion of the total depth of winding occupied by conductors, then 
Hl!lH =:: tid, and Eq. (2.26) indicates that losses in the innermost layer of 
strands increase rapidly if tlo is allowed to increase much beyond Old. In ef-
fect, tlo must be limited to a few times old to avoid a decrease of TJ in Eq. 
(2.25) that would more than offset the increase of ac provided by increase 
oft. 
The most practical means of producing multiple-layer windings with 
d < < o is use of very finely stranded litz wire, in which many insulated 
strands are twisted together so that each occupies all possible positions to ap-
proximately the same extent. Thus the total flux linkages are the same for 
each strand, and, with the strands connected in parallel at the winding ter-
minals, the current divides equally among the strands. For current-pulse 
durations of the order of 100 p.s or more, litz-wirc windings can be con-
structed to provide significantly less loss than single-layer windings. The ad-
vantage of the Iitz wire becomes less for shorter pulses and disppears 
altogether when the skin depth becomes only a little more than the smallest 
available strand diameter. For example, suppose o = 5 mils, and that 2-mil 
conductors with 2-mil-thick insulation are the smallest strands available. For 
old = 2.5, a winding with tlo = Old, or t = 12.5 mils, provides an AC loss 
substantially equal to its DC loss, so that a in Eq. (2.25c) can be taken to be 
equal to 12.513 "" 4 mils times the core-plus-insulation inner perimeter; here 
the factor X enters because the perimeter is occupied about X by insulation 
and only about X by conductors. In comparison, for a single-layer winding a 
can be very nearly o (5 mils) times the perimeter. Slightly less loss may be 
possible in a litz winding of somewhat larger t, but the improvement is 
sharply limited by the increased ACIDC loss ratio for tlo > old. 

124 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
The fast-changing flux that causes skin and proximity effects in saturable-
inductor windings also causes saturation-interval eddy-current losses in the 
magnetic-core material (as already mentioned in connection with Eq. 2.20) 
and in the protective case for the core if the case is metallic. It has been found 
convenient to account for these losses in connection with winding loss rather 
than with the major core loss; like winding loss, they are determined by 
saturation-interval current, whereas the major core loss is a function of 
switching and resetting voltage waveforms. Metallic-cased cores should be 
avoided in short-pulse modulator applications (plastic cases are available), 
because eddy-current losses in them are large, sometimes larger than the loss 
in a single-layer winding. This loss occurs despite the fact that metallic cases 
are always split to avoid short-circuiting the inductor. For pulses of a few 
microseconds duration, skin depths in the case metal (usually aluminum) are 
much less than the metal thickness, and the loss associated with skin-depth 
conduction in both sides of the case is a large fraction of the skin-depth con-
duction loss in a (copper) single-layer winding. The same changing flux that 
causes these losses penetrates the saturated magnetic core material. The 
eddy-current losses produced, though not negligible, are usually relatively 
small because the magnetic tape is thin. 
6. SOME HIGH FREQUENCY EFFECTS 
There are further considerations affecting core loss in laminated materials. 
One example is an interesting version of the wire proximity effect, related to 
skin effect.* Some tape wound C-cores had anomalously low high-frequency 
core losses, in that the material resisitivity appeared higher than it actually 
was. The induced eddy currents in thin laminations close to each other tend 
to repel each other, since the currents are flowing in opposite directions on 
each side of the insulation between adjacent wraps of the core material. Skin 
effect would force the eddy currents to the outer surface of the laminations. 
This is similar to the proximity effect, in which the current is forced away 
from itself by neighboring currents flowing in the same direction in a con-
ductor or in several adjacent conductors. The net result in both cases is to 
reduce the conductor area the current flows through. In the case of induced 
eddy currents, the actual current is determined by the induced voltage in an 
increment of core area and the material resistivity. Since the current here is

125 
confined to a smaller area, the apparent resistivity is higher, the eddy current 
less, and the eddy current J2R loss is lower. This means that the eddy compo-
nent of core loss, as frequency increases, should change from increasing 
linearly with frequency to increasing somewhat less than with the square root 
of frequency, as the skin depth at that frequency becomes comparable to, 
first, the alloy thickness and then the thickness of the interlaminar insula-
tion. In any case it would not scale up from 10kHz to 500kHz the same as it 
would from 10Hz to 500Hz. 
The charging of the interlaminar core capacitance on the leading edge of 
the pulse draws a small but noticeable current spike when rise times are 
below 50 nsec, as does an energy absorption phenomenon associated with 
electron spin in ferromagnetic materials. 
7. PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
From thermodynamic considerations it has been argued (Glascoe & Le-
bacqz, 1964) what the maximum efficiency of a pulse transformer would be 
if, at the end of the pulse, there were no temperature difference between the 
coil and the core and minimum (and equal!) stored energy in both coil and 
core. Similarly, in a power electromagnetic transformer it has been argued 
that the transformer would be in its lowest energy state if the power 
dissipated per unit volume of both coil and core were equal. Friingel (1965) 
maintains that, within this criterion, minimum total power will then be 
dissipated in the transformer when the transformer volume is a minimum, 
and that the volume will be a minimum when the perimeters and volumes of 
coil and core are approximately equal. This, then, is a criterion for equal 
total iron and copper losses. 
There arc thermodynamic plausibility arguments for the rate of heat 
generation per unit volume being equal in both core and winding. 
How low an energy state the unit might be in might be judged by the 
temperature difference between core and winding, since thermodynamics 
has the concept of the potential energy level being related to the temperature 
difference between two terminals, and the theoretical work that can be pro-
duced by a flow of thermal energy from a hotter to a colder terminal is the 
thermal energy generated multiplied by a theoretical maximum conversion 
efficiency factor (one minus the ratio of absolute temperatures). 
Quantum mechanics has the concept that the lowest energy state of a 
system is not a zero energy state, but rather that there is a certain irreducible 

126 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
amount of energy associated with this state. The lowest energy state is called 
the ground state, and its energy level is called the ground state energy. 
It may very well be that in a transformer which has been designed for most 
efficient volume utilization that there will be an inherent differential rate of 
thermal energy generation between core and winding. If this turns out to be 
the case, the transformer designer should not not be upset, for the quantum-
mechanical plausibility argument makes it all right. On the other hand, if our 
best designs lead to essentially no differential rate of thermal energy genera-
tion, the thermodynamic plausibility argument makes that all right. The 
point here is that there may be circumstances in which either of these con-
cepts will apply, and one viewpoint or another may give useful insight into a 
particular problem. The primary focus of the designer's attention should not 
be on these questions, but rather on applying design tools which work to pro-
duce a transformer which works. Philosophical considerations may make 
one feel better about a particular design tool or use thereof, but are only 
useful insofar as they lead to useful tools. 
Let us pick one of our transformer designs, optimized for winding loss 
only, and see how it corresponds to this concept. Take Case I, P = 1.8, 
Q = 2. 7. The core volume is calculated to be 2.68 cu. in. and the coil volume 
is 0.59 cu. in. The coil and core volumes are clearly not equal. 
Now let's take a look at a Case I design optimized for total loss (core and 
winding combined), and see how it does. Consider a fairly efficient design, 
P = 4.7, Q = 6.8. The core volume is calculated to be almost 20, and the 
coil volume about 2. We know that the core loss is about 45% of the total 
loss, so the loss per unit volume of the core is about one-tenth that of the 
coil. The coil perimeter is calculated to be about 7, whereas the core 
perimeter is about 22, almost three times the coil perimeter. 
A comment on the contrast between these results and the earlier 
philosophical considerations of other authors may be in order. The loss 
mechanism associated with the interaction of a magnetic field with fer-
romagnetic matter is not the same as the loss mechanism associated with the 
interaction of an electric field with a conductor. The energy densities of the 
magnetic and electric fields (per unit volume of transformer) are probably 
not equal, either. It should therefore be not at all surprising that in such an 
(optimized for minimum volume) transformer the core and coil volumes or 
perimeters or loss densities are disparate. 
On the other hand, it should be noted that these considerations may very 
well apply to pulse transformers, when the effects of high frequency coil 
parasitics (leakage inductance and coil capacitance) or high frequency core 
parasitics (magnetic field penetration depth into laminated materials, etc.)

are taken into consideration. Some discussion of this topic may be found in 
vol. 5 of the M.I.T. radiation laboratory series. 
8. SOME COMMENTS ON MATERIALS 
AND SUPPLIERS 
Various manufacturers of magnetic materials, including Ferroxcube, In-
diana General, Stackpole, Micro Metals, TDK, Magnetics Inc., Magnetic 
Metals, Arnold Engineering, and National Magnetics, have not only varying 
degrees of applications information but large amounts of technical data on 
the performance of their various materials. The reader is strongly urged to 
contact all possible sources, obtain all available data, and study everything 
carefully. These companies have many knowledgeable engineers on their 
staffs and they are familiar with many of the more subtle characteristics of 
their materials. Some of these manufacturers make unique materials (the 12 
mil Z-type silicon steel available from National Magnetics is a good 
example), and the designer must be aware of the performance advantages 
each company offers. 
The reader is also cautioned that not all similar-appearing items from dif-
ferent manufacturers are the same. Many people offer 2 mil tape-wound 
C-cores for pulse applications, but the pulse permeability may vary by a fac-
tor of 4 or more depending on the supplier. Pulse permeability is not 
necessarily the permeability as measured under DC, low frequency AC ex-
citation, or even high frequency AC excitation. It is the apparent permeabil-
ity as measured under pulse conditions. 
Further, many manufacturers can provide material performance equal to 
special selected grades or apparently proprietary items offered by others. 
Some manufacturers can work more closely with the engineer than others, 
and can tailor special core characteristics to a specific application. 
The difference between two designs can easily be the familiarity of one 
engineer with more types of materials and the capabilities of more suppliers. 
The following very general guidelines are suggested, at the risk of some 
repetition. For pulse transformers which handle pulse widths of several hun-
dred microseconds to several milliseconds, 4 mil Z-type silicon steel is an ap-
propriate core material. For pulse widths of 1-2 p.sec to a few hundred 
microseconds, 2 mil silicon steel is appropriate. For pulse widths of a few 
tenths of a microsecond to a few tens of microseconds, I mil 50 nickel 
C-cores or tape-wound toroids are often appropriate. For pulse widths of a 
few tens of nanoseconds to a few tens of microseconds, ferrite cores are 
often appropriate. For pulse widths of a few tens of nanoseconds to a few 

128 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
microseconds, air core pulse transformers are often appropriate, especially 
where very high peak powers (megawatts to gigawatts) are involved. 
9. MATHEMATICAL MANIPULATIONS 
Let us look at a few of the relationships we have introduced so far and see if 
we can find a relationship between the given parameters of a pulse 
transformer application and the transformer design parameters such as 
turns, core and coil dimensions, etc.

Ep and Tpw are given. The designer selects a B appropriate to the par-
ticular core material. T, is given and Z 0 is either given or can be inferred 
from the circuit application. The ratio of Np to N 5 is also given. 
Our knowns are now r, Np, b, s, and .1. Now .1 is just Np(fp + sp) + 
Ns(t5 + s5), and the designer often will choose the foil thickness based on 
winding convenience rather than allowable resistance. The foil thickness t 
for the moment will be assumed to depend only on Np and sand hence will 
not be an independent unknown parameter. We will look at winding 
resistance later. 
Note that r, Np, b, and s make four unknowns. Unfortunately, we have 
only two equations for air core designs or three equations for iron core 
designs, and cannot solve for four unknowns. It appears we have to look at 
winding resistance now.

If we pick lp and Is to be in the same ratio as Np and Ns, then we have one 
more unknown and one more relationship. 
We now have five unknowns and four relationships. Perhaps we can 
decide that we care what inductance the primary has, and that may help. For 
an air core,

which seems to give us one more relationship among our existing unknowns 
but naturally only replaces Eq. (6.18) for core designs. Can we now uniquely 
determine an air core design from the information given? The unknowns are 
r, N pâ¢ b, s, and ..:1. Our relationships are Eqs. (6.14), (6.15), (6.16), and 
(6.17). 
Equation (6.18) spoke of flux density, which is irrelevant for an air core 
design. So, for air core design we are short one relationship. 
10. MORE DISCUSSION AND EXAMPLES 
The situation is actually not so bad. We can design an air core transformer. 
The layer insulation thickness must support the voltage between turns, and 
this gives us a connection between the input voltage, turns, and layer insula-
tion thickness via a working stress level which the designer is free to choose. 
The same conceptual relationship exists in iron core designs, so we do not 
necessarily need to invoke a primary inductance. 
Beware of specifying too much. 1f we have four unknowns and we specify 
six parameters which arc functions of those, it will usually be impossible to 
meet simultaneously more than four of those six specified parameters. 
We haven't said anything about the permeability of the core material for 
iron core designs, or whether the effective permeability is determined by a 
gap in the magnetic circuit. Nonetheless, these are minor items. The designer 
can specify these and tweak the design later. For iron core designs we do have 
enough relationships to specify a design uniquely.

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
It may (and often does) turn out that the transformer rise time is limited 
not by its own L' C' product, but by the time constant of the load impedance 
with the transformer leakage inductance, or by the time constant of the 
source impedance and the internal shunt capacitance of the tranformer (in-
cluding any capacitive component of the load). 
One may use the idea that putting a core into a transformer which meets all 
design requirements (except primary inductance) as an air core will raise the 
primary inductance by a factor of anywhere from around 3-10 for a simple 
rod core inside the coil only to perhaps 10 3-10 4 for high permeability alloys 
in gapless construction. 
For typical configurations of tape-wound C-cores or ferrite cores one can 
assume the primary inductance will increase over an air core by about one 
hundred to a few thousand. Depending on materials and physical size, the 
range can go anywhere from 10 to 10 5â¢ 
Between resistance considerations, which may vary from significant to in-
significant, and volts per turn or volts per layer considerations, which may 
vary from irrelevant to so critical that turns per layer and/or layer insulta-
tion thickness is determined by allowable dielectric stress (which may con-
flict with capacitance or leakage inductance requirements for wire wound 
units, forcing a foil-wound design approach, and the myriad core materials 
and attendant permeability characteristics over a pulse width range of 
nanoseconds to milliseconds, it begins to look like we will not be able to 
come up with a simple cookbook criterion for pulse transformers as we did 
for power transformers or inductors. 
In some cases we may need a pulse transformer with high voltage isolation 
between windings. The need for distance between windings, combined with 
the need for tight coupling between windings and minimal delay time for the 
pulse transmitted through the transformer impose conflicting and often ex-
asperating design requirements. They not only make it difficult to obtain a 
viable design at the first attempt, but may tax the ingenuity of the designer. 
11. METHODS OF STARTING A DESIGN 
Very well, how do we start a pulse transformer design? The answer to this 
depends on which specifiable parameters are the most important. Say we 
know that our design is going to have its rise time limited by leakage induc-
tance and source impedance, and we have an allowable leakage inductance 
number. Let us say that this is a high voltage, high peak current, high repeti-
tion rate application, so that we care what the copper losses are. Given the 
turns ratio and voltage per turn, we can choose s to hold a given level of 

PULSE TRANSFORMERS 
131 
voltage stress. Assume the simplest possible geometry, a single primary turn, 
and the foil wound multi-turn secondary beneath. For the single-turn 
primary, use IOOET = N<P to get the flux density in the air core to the Bat 
which we expect to run the core (20,000-30,000 gauss or less for 2 mil silicon 
steel with full flux reset, or some other as appropriate). 
We now have a winding radius; calculate resistances and set allowable 
conductor thicknesses for some assumed coil width. We now have a winding 
build. Increase the coil width b until the leakage inductance requirement is 
met. Go back and recheck winding resistance, reduce conductor thickness as 
appropriate. These two parameters can be traded off for any specified 
resistance. Now calculate the primary inductance. It is usually too low. Place 
a simple rod core inside the coil, expect a primary inductance increase of 
about a factor of 10. If that is much too low, a C-core can be inserted around 
the coil and the inductance recalculated. 
What we just did in the previous example was to design a pulse trans-
former according to the following procedure: 
l. Assume a foil-wound design. 
2. Assume a given level of volts per turn. 
3. Pick a layer (turn) insulation thickness, assuming a high volts-per-
turn design. 
4. Determine the winding radius based on the fixed flux density limit 
which follows from the voltage per turn and the pulse width. 
5. Estimate the winding width. 
6. Pick a conductor thickness for that winding width such that copper 
loss requirements are met (with due attention to skin effect). 
7. Calculate leakage inductance, then vary the winding width b until the 
leakage inductance is met for the assumed coil build. 
8. For that coil width, recheck the new winding resistance. Vary conduc-
tor foil thickness as appropriate. 
9. For the new coil build (due to the new foil thickness) pick a new coil 
width such that leakage inductance still meets specifications. 
10. Now all parameters should be in line except primary inductance. 
Calculate the air core inductance, and add some type of core to the 
design such that we have adequate inductance and a pulse droop less 
than the specification limit. 
In one particular case where this procedure sequence was used, the re-
quirement was for a pulse transformer to deliver a quarter megavolt at a 
gigawatt to a resistive load. Pulse width was in the low microsecond range 
and repetition rate was below a kilohertz. 

132 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
If an iron core had not been used, the transformer size (less than 2 cu. ft) 
would have been around ten times the volume. Meeting both resistance and 
leakage inductance (less than 100 nanohenry) requirements would have been 
improbable. 
As we said previously, how we start a pulse transformer design depends on 
which specifiable parameters are the most important. If leading edge pulse 
fidelity is important and unusually high voltages are not present, one could 
start by making a ballpark estimate of the turns on the winding with the 
greatest number of turns from Tr = I.2ND p.sec, where Dis the mean wind-
ing diameter in inches. Guess a winding diameter. From that go to step 4 
above and follow through to step 10. If a viable design is not obtained it will 
be obvious whether to raise or lower Nor D, whether the rise time, pulse 
width, winding resistance, or other parameters are mutually incompatible. 
If pulse width capability is most important and rise time not too signifi-
cant, it may be simplest to design the unit as a conventional transformer, as 
outlined in Chapter 2. 
If magnetizing current is important, and high voltages do not complicate 
the situation excessively, determine the primary inductance required, and 
design it as a choke using the techniques developed in Chapter 3. Then go to 
step 7 above and rework the design as necessary. If a viable design is not ob-
tained for this case, go to a gapless core (tape-wound toroid) and modify the 
circuit for full flux reset in the core. 
If both leading edge and magnetizing current are important, set up the ap-
plication for full flux reset, then obtain a trial number of turns from the rise 
time estimate and a winding diameter guess. 
It may seem unscientific to start a design procedure with guesswork. A few 
design attempts will convince the reader that this design algorithm homes in 
very rapidly on core and coil dimensions. More complex and exact design 
tools are available in the references cited at the end of the chapter, but unfor-
tunately the more exact techniques take more time and require a working 
familiarity with advanced mathematics. This is simpler and gets the result 
faster. The reason is that this is not really guesswork. What we do is pick the 
most important parameter or parameters and design for that. Then we 
modify the design to obtain a close approach to conformance with the re-
maining requirements in order of their importance. You should take the per-
formance requirements and rate them in order of relative importance. If 
everything is totally important, nothing can be secondary to anything else, 
the needed performance requirements drown in an overwhelming sea of im-
portances. When one can differentiate the relative significance of the various 
parameters, the really hard part has been accomplished.

12. THE DESIGN STARTS WITH THE CIRCUIT 
Where we start with a pulse transformer design is often a complex interac-
tion with the circuit. Some parameters are the most critical ones, and others 
are ones that fall out as they may and we have to get them to some acceptable 
limit or find a way to live with them. Many high frequency converter 
transformers should be treated as pulse transformers where one starts the 
design with leading-edge or rise-time considerations, and plays these off 
against pulse-width capability. Let us take as an example a common situa-
tion, that of a gate pulse coupling transformer for the power mosfets in a 
half-bridge PWM inverter operating at 100kHz. The first step is to find out 
what the load really requires. As Ed Oxner of Siliconix showed in his Power-
con 9 paper, the load on the transformer (the mosfet gate) is a highly 
nonlinear capacitance. We rig up a breadboard gate driver and measure the 
average gate current drawn by the gate when driven by, for example, a 
12-volt 100-kHz signal, and the mosfet drain switching a small load. Let us 
say that we found this average gate current to be 30 rnA for this particular 
mosfet. Let us further say that we want the mosfet switching time to be on 
the order of 50 nanoseconds. Since there are two switching transitions percy-
cle, the peak gate current pulse would be about 50 ns wide, twice per 10 p.s 
period. The duty cycle of this waveform is therefore 1 fJ!o, and for 30 rnA 
average the design peak current would be 3 A. For a 12-volt signal, we should 
therefore treat the load as having an impedance of 4 ohms. If we assume that 
the pulse transformer rise time is inductance-limited, then we would want the 
current rise time (LIR time constant of transformer leakage inductance and 
the 4 ohm load impedance) to be on the order of 20 nanoseconds. This gives 
us a leakage inductance limit of 80 nanohenries. The load is too complex for 
a rigorous analysis to be simple. This approach gives an approximation 
which is usually close enough. 
We now juggle coil dimensions against core flux capacity. When these fac-
tors line up we then check core loss, and if there arc no thermal problems we 
then look at primary inductance and see if we can live with it. 
Let us assume that our primary and secondaries all have equal turns.

Maximum pulse would be at 1001Jfo duty, or Tp = 5 p.s: 
100 X 12 X 5 = 6<f.J. 
Our core must therefore have a flux capacity of 1000 Maxwells. 
We decided from an examination of the core loss curves for Magnetics, 
Inc., type S ferrite (we want the core loss to decrease with increasing 
temperature) that a flux density of 3000 Gauss would probably give an ac-
ceptable core loss for the size core we would end up with. The required core 
area is then <f.J/B = A = 0.3 cm 2â¢ 
A coil of mean radius 0.5 em clearly will have enough room for a core of 
area0.3 cm 2â¢ 
We need a core with a window length of 1 in. (a bit more than the actual 
winding length) and a window height of a bit more than Y. in., say Y..-Y. in. 
The core area of 0.3 em 2 (""' 0.05 sq. in.) could be met with a Y. in. x Y. in. 
core area. 
We discover from the Magnetics, Inc. catalog that there is a standard E-E 
core which would do the job. 
We can now proceed to design the coil. 
Let us say that we want our windings spread over the 0.8 in. winding 
length. Foil would be the most convenient way of controlling this parameter. 
Let us further say that 22 mils of insulation between each winding and the 
next will give us an adequately low level of interwinding capacitance. Two 

PULSE TRANSFORMERS 
135 
wraps of 0.010 Nomex 411 interleaved with one wrap of 2 mil Kapton will 
give adequate dielectric strength and adequate wicks for impregnation. Im-
pregnation into the structure of each winding is not important, as the wind-
ing has only 12 volts, and a mil or two of turn-to-turn spacing gives us a 
voltage far below corona inception. 
Use 2 mil copper foil slit to 0.800 wide, interleaved with 2 mil Kapton film 
slit to 0.950. Our coil build is then:

The actual build of the coil itself is 0.116 in., or 0.29 em. This winding 
structure will fit comfortably within a window height of 0.25 in., so we have 
a physical fit. 
A few more things need to be checked in order to have a complete design. 
The reader might find it an interesting exercise to calculate the copper loss, 
the exact core loss now that we know the core volume, and the primary in-
ductance. 
13. MISCELLANY 
Interleaving of windings is useful as a means of reducing leakage inductance 
where interwinding capacitance can be allowed to increase. Interleaving is 
also useful in some high frequency inverter transformer designs, and in reso-
nant charging reactors which have a second winding to return excess stored 
energy to the supply (this being the basis of many resonant charging and 
capacitive load voltage regulation functions). Interleaving was briefly 
discussed in Chapter 1. 
The design of resonant charging reactors is covered in the chapter on 
power reactors (Chapter 3). 
Shields can be useful in controlling interwinding capacitance. The applica-
tion of shields in power transformers is considered in the chapter on field 
gradient control (Chapter 7). 
Shields do, however, have their drawbacks. The designer is cautioned to 
calculate the capacitance between windings and shields in pulse 

136 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
transformers, and to ensure that the dielectric thickness is great enough, or 
the area low enough, so that the capacitance from windings to shields is suf-
ficiently low to preclude its interfering unduly with pulse transformer per-
formance. 
If one is not certain of the magnitude of the capacitance between two 
windings or a winding and a shield, these may be easily calculated from Eq. 
(6.4), assuming a single primary and a single secondary turn. 
In point of fact, one may specify an initial capacitance or leakage induc-
tance, go through the numbers, and come up with a winding width of 2.5 em 
(1 in.), a conductor thickness of 0.001 em (0.00025 in.) and an insulation 
thickness of 0.0001 em (0.000025 in.). 
One could hardly pick up something so thin and fragile, much less wind 
with it. 
This indicates that, in this case, one should go to round magnet wire of 
equivalent area. At N turns per layer, S becomes multiplied by N and so 
becomes more manageable. The wire diameter plus S should now be com-
parable to the original N (T + S) and performance will be somewhat 
similar, although definitely not identical. Since we no longer have each turn 
shielding the stray capacitance of the turn above it from ground, each turn of 
the layer looks directly at the core or the previous winding or layer. If this is 
critical the successive layers of a layer-wound coil can all be wound in the 
same direction, left to right, left to right, etc. In a toroid the capacitance 
usually becomes higher and more random for the same design compared to a 
single coil implemented on a C-core. 
14. THE CASE OF A COMPARATIVELY HIGH 
IMPEDANCE CAPACITIVE LOAD DRIVEN 
FROM A FAST-PULSED VOLTAGE SOURCE 
Assuming a pulsed voltage source of low impedance, and a load capacitance 
which is much larger than the internal capacitances of the transformer, in 
order to obtain a clean pulse it will be necessary to insert damping resistances 
in series with the load. 

PULSE TRANSFORMERS 
137 
L' is the equivalent lumped leakage inductance. C1 is the distributed shunt 
capacitance across L'. C1 is presumed to be much less than Cz. 
R 1 is a resistor (small, but always present) in series with the transformer 
primary. It can aid in damping of the L' C 1 resonance, but if too large it will 
give excessive pulse droop due to the pulse current which flows through it 
and the primary inductance L. R 2 damps the L' Cz resonance. It is the essen-
tial component for obtaining a clean pulse response where the rise time of the 
transformer is determined by the leakage inductance and the load 
capacitance. 
As C 1 becomes larger compared to C2, it will be necessary (for proper 
damping) for R 1 to become larger compared to R 2, putting more severe 
demands on the transformer design, as L must become higher. The proper 
design procedure is to keep C1 much less than Cz, perhaps I0-200Jo at most. 
If C1 < Cz the impedance of L' C1 will always be higher than that of L' Cz, 
implying that R 1 should always be greater than R 2. If R 1 is greater than R2, 
L' C 1 will be damped and L' C2 overdamped. It is therefore not practical to 
damp both resonances to obtain the fastest rise time. If one damps L' C2, 
there will be an oscillatory component of pulse magnetizing current on the 
leading edge due to the undamped L' C1 resonance. In order to obtain the 
proper (desired) rise time (that associated with L', C2, and Rz), the driver 
must be able to tolerate this behavior in its load. This circumstance is seen 
with fast pulse transformers driving power mosfet gates, as well as with grid 
pulse coupling transformers for power vacuum tubes. One of the more com-
mon methods of dealing with these situations is to slow down the rise and fall 
times of the input pulse to make them comparable to the rise and fall times 
that would be obtained with faster pulse edges and sufficient damping. In ef-
fect, the transformer acts as a low pass filter and we are restricting the signal 
bandwidth to the pass band of the L' C2R2 filter. 
15. COPING WITH THE REAL WORLD 
OF TRANSFORMER SPECIFICATIONS 
A common occurrence is that a circuit designer will request a transformer 
and not give sufficient data. For example, let's say we have the following 
specification: 
I. One primary, one secondary, I : I turns ratio 
2. 1000 V in, 1000 V out 
3. IOO V maximum droop 
4. pulse width X-I Y, p.sec 

138 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
5. 40 kV isolation between windings 
6. 40 nsec rise time 
We can make the following observations: 
l. It was not specified whether the I : I turns ratio was an inverting or 
non-inverting application. The pulse feed through capacitance may (depend-
ing on construction) be in phase or out of phase with the output pulse, and 
may markedly affect the rise time. 
2. A source impedance was not specified, so one does not know what 
primary inductance is required, or what level of pulse magnetizing current is 
tolerable, or what the impedance level of the parasitic inductance and 
capacitance of the transformer should be. 
3. No allowable limits on pulse overshoot or ringing were mentioned, nor 
is any mention made of pulse fall time or backswing. 
4. A load impedance and a duty cycle are not specified, so we do not know 
what peak or average currems will pass through the transformer. 
5. Nothing was said about allowable size, weight, whether a solid, liquid, 
or compressed gas dielectric is expected or allowable, the operating 
temperature, other environmental requirements, connections, etc. 
6. The circuit in which the transformer is to operate was not given. Even a 
simplified circuit can be helpful to the designer in understanding the 
transformer requirements. 
Assuming it is not possible at the moment to go back to whoever requested 
such a device and obtain the needed data, one could do well to apply a bit of 
deductive reasoning to the problem and perhaps discover some of the design 
requirements. 
Let us say that the quote came from an experimental scientist working in a 
laboratory, so we assume a laboratory environment and we assume that a 
liquid-immersed unit will be acceptable. Liquid immersion allows the con-
nections to be in the liquid as well, which at 40 kV is very desirable for safety 
reasons. 
We further assume that because load current was not mentioned, the load 
current was not large enough to appear significant to the experimenter. 
Similarly, we assume the duty cycle to be low, probably less than l OJo. 
If the foregoing assumptions are correct, it is plausible to assume that our 
experimenter has a pulse generator at ground which can deliver at least a few 
amperes of pulse current, and probably not more than 20 amperes. 
A noteworthy item is the 40 kV isolation requirement. We should start by 

PULSE TRANSFORMERS 
139 
assuming that however we construct th!! transformer, the stress between 
windings will be moderate, say 100 volts/mil. We then have a distance be-
tween windings of 0.4 in. At this point, the mean diameter of our winding is 
guaranteed to be more than 0.8 in. 
Let us assume that we will need a core, and that for this short pulse width 
we will use either a ferrite or a Y, mil tape-wound nickel alloy core, either 50 
or 80 nickel. 
The volt-second support of our core is given by

and a very rough estimation of the rise time of the transformer is T, = 3ND 
(T, is ns, Dis in.). Let us see whether we have any conflicts or conclusions 
with the data and assumptions so far. 
Convert the rise time estimate to the CGS system: 
T, = 7.5 ND (em)

ND =: 5. 
100 x 1000 x 1.5 = N<l> = NBA, where B is the flux excursion in 
Gauss and A is the core area in square centimeters. For a ferrite, high nickel, 
or low nickel core we can assume 7,500, 15,000, and 30,000 Gauss for cores 
with full flux reset. (Oh yes, remember to tell the customer he should arrange 
his circuit to provide reset current for the core, so that the full flux capacity 
can be utilized.) Since the tape-wound alloys will have stacking factors on the 
order of 500Jo (including the core case for larger cores), the effective flux den-
sities for low and high nickel become 7,500 and 15,000 Gauss. Dis the mean 
winding diameter, which is not the diameter of the core (see Fig. 6-3). 
If we assume for the sake of a simple analysis that all cross sections are 
round, then our core area A may be expressed as 1rr 2, where r is found in Fig. 
6-3 to be (D -

while for 7,500 Gauss it is ~pproximately the equation 
N 2 -
35N + 25 = 0. 
Both of these equations have real solutions, but in both cases N turns out to 
be slightly negative. That means either that this combination of parameters 
is impossible to physically realize, or that our rise time estimating parameter 
is not appropriate to this situation, with a large interwinding space and 
relatively thin (we presume) windings. Unfortunately, this rise time relation-
ship was derived primarily for this type of geometry, although it is a rough 
approximation. The results so far indicate that our closest approach to the 
requirements is with very small N. It is to be expected that very small levels of 

PULSE TRANSFORMERS

interwinding capacitance will be required. Just for example, assume an ef-
fective shunt capacitance (including the load capacitance, which the ex-
perimenter also neglected to specify) of 50 picofarads. To charge that to 1000 
volts in 40 nanoseconds requires (from IT = CE) 1 Y. amperes. That implies 
that our source impedance must be much less than 800 ohms. 
If the RC rise time is equal to the L/R rise time, that implies our leakage 
inductance must be on the order of 32 p.H. That implies N much more than a 
few turns for coil diameters of a few centimeters. If N were one turn, based 
on volt-second support considerations, a core area of at least 10 square cen-
timeters would be required. We would have a primary inductance on the 
order of 10-50 p.H, and a pulse magnetizing current of about 30-150 amps, 
which is far too much. For 10 turns we would need only 1 em 2 square of core 
area, and could expect a primary inductance of 100-500 JLH, for a pulse 
magnetizing current in the 3-15 ampere range. If the least primary current 
were to give the maximum allowable droop of 100 volts, our source im-
pedance would need to be about 30 ohms. For 10 turns and a 1 em 2 core, 
what might our leakage inductance be? 
L' = ~ ?rJLo( ~ )t::.N1 
(all dimensions centimeters) 
Assuming a fairly short winding length b to keep the interwinding 
capacitance down, user = 1.5, b = 1, D = I, N = 10. Then L' = 4 JLH, 
and for a 30 ohm source impedance the L/R rise time is about 130 ns. We can 
calculate the interwinding capacitance from the air core pulse transformer 
formula [Eq. (6.4)], or obtain a better result for this case by using the for-
mula for the capacitance between concentric cylinders. For short, stubby 
cylinders the end fringing effects will be significant, unless the length is at 
least several diameters. To reduce the LIR rise time to about 40 ns will re-
quire the leakage inductance to be about one-third of its present value, which 
can be done with b = 3 em. For that case we can calculate the interwinding 
capacitance using a relationship for the capacitance between coaxial 
cylinders (Radio Engineers, 1970): 
rz 
C = 0.24 e ,llog 10 -- pF/cm 
fJ 
where rz is the radius of the outer cylinder and r1 is the radius of the inner 
cylinder.

C = 0.24 X 4 pF 
1.5 
loglO 0.5 
0.96 
0.48 _ 2pF. 
This indicates that the interwinding capacitance will probably not be 
significant, as even with fringing effects is seems unlikely it would exceed 6 
pF. Intra winding capacitance may be a problem, but with only 10 turns one 
could space them a millimeter or so and hold the intra winding capacitance to 
perhaps a few picofarads. The customer's load capacitance, however, is go-
ing to be the dominant component. Depending on that and the source im-
pedance, we might or might not meet the required rise time with our tentative 
geometry (length of 3 em and leakage inductance of about 1 X I'H). For 
higher source impedances the rise time might be RC limited, while for a 
switched voltage source the rise time will be LC limited unless we increase the 
winding length considerably. 
You may have noticed that we did not take some initial requirements, go 
through a few neat formulas in a totally mechanical manner, and somehow 
come out with a perfect design. This is the real world, and not all examples 
have happy endings. We now have an idea of what the tradeoffs are going to 
be, and can discuss with the customer the tradeoffs between dielectric stress, 
peak drive power, source impedance, droop, and rise time for this particular 
situation. Once the customer has made a few decisions, deciding what he is 
willing to give in order to get what he needs, then we can design a 
transformer.

FIELD GRADIENT CONTROL 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Physics is the study of this universe, its constituents, and their behavior. To 
the extent that we understand clearly some part of the subject and can ac-
curately predict the methods to be used for the acquisition of new data, it is a 
science. To the extent that we do not know what results a particular experi-
ment will have, and rely on intuition to govern the choice of the next experi-
ment or "suddenly realize" that a particular datum is missing or not yet 
discovered, it is an art. 
Many of the basic concepts of physics are an attempt of the physicist to ex-
plain something which was observed. A good example of this is the electric 
field. I personally have never seen one, and I have never met anyone who 
has. Yet, it has been observed that matter acts as if it were composed of par-
ticles, some of which attract or repel each other. We call one type "positive" 
and the other "negative," simply because they are different. The opposite 
types attract each other, and two of the same type repel each other. There 
seems to be no physical thing which we can see moving bet ween our particles, 
yet there is a force there. It is as if each were "aware" of the other, the 
awareness becoming fainter with distance. 
This property of awareness we call the electric field. The characteristic we 
call charge. The electric field is not a thing. It is a manifestation in this uni-
verse of a concept; it has direction and magnitude, and fits very nicely into 
some natural laws we have discovered. 
Electrons and protons are particles which carry one unit of charge each. 
The measure of how much charge an item has is its excess or deficiency of 
electrons. When the number of electrons and protons in an item do not 
match, or when they are not neatly arranged very close to each other, an ex-
ternal electric field is manifested. 
143 

144 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
Conductors are materials on or through which electrons may move freely 
or easily. Insulators are materials over or through which electrons move only 
with great difficulty. As the temperature increases, conductors tend to be-
come poorer conductors and insulators tend to become poorer insulators. 
None of the ordinary materials used in transformer construction will cross 
over from conductors to insulators in normal circumstances. 
2. THE ELECTRIC FIELD GRADIENT 
The potential (voltage) of a particular conductor is measured (defined) by 
the amount of work it takes to transport a unit charge from a great distance 
up to the surface of the object. That seems to say that we are measuring the 
charge stored on that object. In fact, we are measuring the electric field 
which results from that charge, and that also depends in a special way on the 
physical geometry of the object. This geometric relationship between charge 
and voltage is defined by CV = Q. The greater the capacitance, the less 
voltage is present when a given amount of charge is stored. 
Referring to Table 7-1, look at columns B and F. Column B is the 
diameter of a sphere or wire. Column F shows the intensity of the electric 
field (the gradient) at the surface of the conductor. Note that the units are 
volts per mil of distance. As the diameter of the conductor gets smaller (ap-
proaching a point or sharp edge), the intensity of the electric field rises to 
truly absurd levels. Imagine what it would be at a really sharp edge!

A useful equation: E (volts per mil) = JO"' V (volts)/ R (inches), where R is the surface radius or curvature. 
NoTE: At field gradients above about 500 volts per mil in most dielectric media we would expect corona 
and eventual breakdown starting at the conductor surface and extending outward as the corona breaks 
down the dielectric and develops sharp-tipped paths or carbon through the dielectric.

145 
3. BREAKDOWN 
This is very important, because any gas, liquid, or solid will break down if 
the electric field gets too intense. What happens is that a stray electric charge 
(there is always a random electron or ion around) is accelerated by the elec-
tric field. It hits an atom, knocking an electron loose from it. These electrons 
in turn are accelerated, hitting other atoms and knocking more electrons 
loose. All the positive ions produced are likewise accelerated in the opposite 
direction, knocking other electrons loose and creating more ions and elec-
trons. You can see how there can be an avalanche multiplication of the 
number of free charges. 
When about as many free charges are generated as are losing their energy 
through collisions after a short distance, a small blue glow is usually visible 
around a sharp point in air. Sometimes there will be a short burst of ava-
lanching charges that will die off and then repeat. This is commonly called 
corona. When the number of charges grows and multiplies rapidly, finds or 
creates a path, and flows rapidly along it, a flash of light is usually visible. 
This is called an arc, a spark, or a mistake. 
4. THE ELECTRIC FIELD IN A VOID 
WITHIN A DIELECTRIC MEDIUM 
If we now look at the situation where a solid dielectric medium contains a 
void, we find something interesting (see Fig. 7-1). Electric fields in the three 
shapes of void~ are quite different. If the dielectric constant of the medium is 
K, the electric field in void A is essentially the same as that in the dielectric. 
The electric field in void B is K/3 times that in the dielectric. The electric field 
in void Cis K times that of the electric field in the dielectric. This is true even 
if the void is in contact with one of the electrodes. The only assumption we 
have made is that the width dimension of void A is small compared to the 
length, and vice versa for void C.

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
The gas in a small void (in a solid dielectric) is likely to be either air or low 
pressure vapor from the potting compound, which will break down at 50 
volts per mil or less. If we have designed a working stress level of 50-300 
volts per mil there will be, at the very least, internal corona wherever there is 
such a void. Furthermore, if our solid dielectric consists of something like 
epoxy resin with a layer of something which epoxy may not bond well to 
(such as untreated Teflon or polypropylene or even mylar), under thermal 
cycling a thin crack (void C) may appear. We will have corona. If the void 
(due to material orientation) is of shape A, then a current can creep along the 
surface (surface creep dielectric strength is much less than bulk breakdown 
strength). The remaining bulk thickness of dielectric at each end of that slot 
would be subjected to nearly the full electrical stress. 
5. THE. ELECTRIC FIELD GRADIENT 
AND CORONA 
If one electrode in a solid dielectric medium is a sharp edge or corner, we 
would have a potential situation for corona. It does not matter whether the 
sharp edge is at high voltage or at ground. 
Commonly, designers will very carefully radius and shield all terminals on 
a high voltage winding and ignore the fact that they now have a smoothly 
curved electrode facing a sharp one. This is not the best design practice. 
Corona is objectionable for several reasons. First, there are military 
specifications governing the performance of transformers. In some situa-
tions a transformer must meet those specifications or the customer will not 
buy it. It also turns out that the electron and ion activity which is corona will, 
if allowed to continue, cause a progressive degradation of the dielectric 
material. It turns into carbon, silicone slime, or other partly decomposed 
materials. Electrical breakdown will inevitably follow-the only question is 
when. 
Corona is also objectionable because the electron and ion activity, being 
somewhat random, induces small, high frequency currents in external cir-
cuitry. This electrical noise can interfere with the proper functioning of some 
systems. 
You can see now that it is important: (a) to use not-too-fine leads coming 
out of transformer windings; (b) to interpose a larger radius conductor be-
tween any sharp edge at high voltages (such as the edge of a shield) and 
ground, or other surfaces at largely different voltages; (c) never to leave an 
exposed sharp point or edge of any kind around a high voltage assembly; (d) 

FIELD GRADIENT CONTROL 
147 
to avoid incompatible dielectric materials; and (3) to avoid incomplete im-
pregnation or potting. 
One other noteworthy item-never leave a conductor (such as a field-
shaping electrode) without a definite conductive path to somewhere. Con-
ductors "floating" in a high voltage region can occasionally cause problems. 
For example, it may turn out that the insulation resistance from the conduc-
tor to the physically nearer electrode is much higher in proportion than the 
insulation resistance to the farther electrode. In this case the capacitance of 
the conductor charges up to a voltage determined by the ratio of insulation 
resistances. At this potential, the conductor may then break down the 
shorter length of insulating material. If the energy involved is not enough to 
establish a permanent arc path, an intermittent discharge will ensue. This 
will generate electrical noise, much as corona does, and in some cases can 
lead progressively to total failure of the insulation system. Dielectric unifor-
mity and positive control of the potential of all conductive materials play an 
important role in the design of reliable high voltage components and 
systems. 
6. A PHENOMENON AT A DIELECTRIC INTERFACE 
At a dielectric interface between air or some gas and a solid dielectric, some 
very interesting things can happen. Let us look at the situation shown in Fig. 
7-2. An electron (there is always a free electron floating around) is ac-
celerated by the electric field toward the positive electrode. It hits the dielec-
tric surface and knocks another electron loose, leaving a positive ion behind. 
Both electrons continue on, hitting the dielectric surface again, knocking an-
other two electrons loose, and leaving two positive ions behind. All four elec-
trons continue on their way, and in this way we can build up an avalanche of 
Fig. 7-2. Dielectric interface. 

148 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
electrons, leaving a path of positive ions behind on the dielectric surface. 
This creates a conductive path on the dielectric surface, which electrons from 
the negative electrode can then flow across. This is called breakdown. 
Depending on the dielectric constant of the material, the minimum break-
down potential will be when the dielectric surface between the electrodes 
makes roughly a right angle with the negative electrode. Now look at the 
slightly different situation illustrated in Fig. 7-3. 
The electron, as it is accelerated by the electric field toward the positive 
electrode, moves away from the dielectric surface. No positive ions are 
formed. The breakdown potential of this geometry may be as much as a fac-
tor of two or three higher than that of the previous situation. This 
phenomenon has actually been used to make three-terminal spark gaps, 
wherein a trigger electrode is embedded in the dielectric and biased in such a 
manner as to pull the electric field into or out of the dielectric surface. Elec-
trons are thus caused to be accelerated either toward or away from the sur-
face. 
The significance here is that the transformer designer, being aware of this 
phenomenon, can make an effort to shape the insulating surfaces in high 
voltage designs to minimize the likelihood of electrical breakdown. 
7. MECHANICAL FIELD GRADIENT 
CONTROL TECHNIQUES 
Many high voltage windings are wound with relatively fine wire. While the 
field gradient inside the winding structure may be quite uniform, the wire it-
self is far too small to bring out as a self lead due to the intense electrical field 
associated with a wire of that small diameter in free space. It may be 
desirable to terminate the fine wire to a larger one. This can be done in the 
following manner. 
Fig. 7-3. Another dielectric interface. 

FIELD GRADIENT CONTROL 
149 
Strip an appropriate length of each wire ( lf4 in. or more of the smaller one, 
Y. in. or more of the iarger); wrap a few turns of the smaller around the larger 
(see Fig. 7-4). Solder the wires together in the normal manner. Take a pair of 
flush-cutting diagonal cutters and cut off all but about Y. in. of the soldered 
part. Touch the soldered part to the oxidized shank of the hot part of a 
soldering iron (hot enough to melt solder, but where the solder will not wet 
the surface). Add a little solder to the joint. As it melts it will wet the already 
soldered wire and form a neat ball. 
When it becomes necessary to have smoothly rounded inner edges of the 
core which face the coil, there are a number of ways to accomplish this end. 
Some methods are more suitable for a single unit than for a production run, 
and some are more suitable for C-cores than stacked laminations or ferrites. 
To radius the edges of a C-core one may most expediently use a fine file 
(fairly new and sharp). It is vitally important that every stroke of the file be 
toward the edges of the laminations. That way the cutting face of the file 
tends to hold the laminations in place. If the motion of the file were toward 
the middle of the core, the cutting force of the file would tend to lift up and 
peel back the laminations. That would destroy the core in short order. 
If this same end must be accomplished on a ferrite there are two options. 
First, the ferrite manufacturer may be able to provide a special core with the 
appropriate edges already radiused. This is preferable for production runs. 
In other cases the ferrite cores, along with a drawing of the desired shape 
modifications, may be sent out to a local company which does form grinding 
with diamond grinding wheels. Such grinding can also be done in house. Ob-
tain a small bench grinder, and ask a local supplier of grinding wheels for a 
soft silicon carbide grinding wheel, fine grit. The supplier will know what 
that means. Also get a tool for dressing grinding wheels and use it as you do 
the grinding, because soft grinding wheels wear somewhat faster than the 
hard-bonded wheels.

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
This operation can b,e performed on a core made from a stack of E-1 
laminations. The laminations must be carefully and exactly assembled in the 
position in which they will be reassembled around the core, and held in place 
with a few small C-clamps. The stack of laminations may then be filed, tak~ 
ing care always to file toward the edge of a lamination. This is a fairly dicey 
operation, not too suitable for high volume production. Where the coil may 
be spaced away from the core on two sides, the following techniques are 
usually more suitable. 
Various items of rounded conductive material may be bonded to the core 
to control the electric field gradient (see Fig. 7-5). 
For physically larger structures and higher voltages it may be appropriate 
to take a piece of hard copper tube, remove a 90-120Â° segment, and bond it 
over the corner of the core. Note that since a voltage gradient exists along the 
edges of the laminations, it is important to place some insulating material 
(tape, paper, etc.) between the tubing and the exposed lamination edges. 
Otherwise a partial shorted turn may result [Fig. 7-6(a)]. Note that for most 
efficient utilization of space the segment should be cut out, and perhaps the 
tubing deformed, so that the corner of the core rests on the inside surface of 
the tube. In many cases it may be simpler to form strips of copper foil as indi-
cated in Fig. 7-6(b), and bond them to the inner portions of the core window 
facing the high voltage coil. With radii of curvature appropriate to the po-
tentials involved, a design with moderate and uniform electric fields can be 
obtained. 
The phrase corona ring or corona roll has come to mean a smoothly 
curved piece of conductive material, often in the shape of a ring, which 
shields the sharp points or edges of the assembly behind it from the high

voltage field between that assembly and elsewhere. The corona ring would be 
tied to the high potential source (to which the assembly to be shielded is 
referenced) by a direct low impedance path such that the discharge of stray 
capacitances does not pass through passive or active circuit components. 
Fifty picofarads of stray capacitance charged to 20 k V stores l 0 millijoules 
of energy. If allowed to discharge through a small rectifier diode, that energy 
could quite easily destroy it. Take, for example, the circuit illustrated in 
Fig. 7-7. 
Let us say that our load requires a maximum current of 20 rnA. This im-
plies relatively small components for the rectifier/filter and regulator. All 
the components could be assembled on lO square inches of board area. The 
Zener and the resistor may dissipate a few watts, and small heat radiators 
would probably be sufficient. All these things have points and sharp edges. 
Such an assembly would perhaps be shielded with corona rings in the manner 
shown in Fig. 7-8. The top and bottom surfaces are conductive planes, 
smoothly joined to wire or tubing at the edges. The edge of the component 
assembly is located in from the corona rings a distance on the order of the 
gap between the corona rings. The ring diameter in this example is on the 
order of the gap between rings. For these relative proportions, most of the

electric field goes to the corona rings as shown. Very little goes to the 
assembly. The proportions indicated above are guidelines only. 
In another example, a corona ring could be used to shield edges of shields 
and fine wires associated with a transformer winding. In most cases, simply 
making the width of the shield equal to that of the high voltage winding does 
a fairly decent job of hiding the sharp shield edge from the field while 
sacrificing a minimum of shielding efficiency. The overall shape of the wind-
ing, including its shield, is still that of a rectangular cylinder, and the ends of 
the cylinders are relatively sharp edges. The dielectric constant of the layer 
insulation may not be sufficiently higher than that of the surrounding 
medium to adequately distort the electric field. In this case one could either 
cover each end of the winding with a corona roll of relatively high resistance 
material (to avoid a shorted turn) but with a low enough resistance to act as a 
field-shaping electrode when its potential is referenced to the outside of the 
winding or the shield. Alternatively, one can progressively reduce the widths 
of the last few layers of the winding so that the winding layer edges approx-
imate the desired radius of curvature. The former technique allows most of 
the winding to be shielded, while the latter technique requires less space in 
the core window, hence gives a smaller design at the expense of shielding effi-
ciency. The latter technique is also very ~ifficult to do neatly without an 
automatic traverse winding machine. 
8. ELECTRICAL FIELD GRADIENT 
CONTROL TECHNIQUES 
For a high voltage output transformer with many tens of layers and many 
thousands of turns, space may be at a premium. Let us say that the end of the 
winding near the primary is floating at 16,000 volts DC, while the other end 
of the secondary winding has 16,000 volts AC superimposed on 16,000 volts 
DC. (Just what kinds of rectifier circuit give rise to this sort of situation will 
be discussed shortly.) 
In this case we are looking at the amount of insulation required between 
the edge of the coil and the core, as well as the insulation. above and below 

FIELD GRADIENT CONTROL 
153 
the winding, and how best to utilize that space. Let us say that we choose 
working stress levels for our insulation system of 200 volts DC per mil and 
I 00 volts per mil AC. At the bottom edge of the coil we would require 80 mils 
of insulation, and 240 mils at the top. The most efficient method of space 
utilization would be to smoothly taper the windirlg width to obtain the 
desired margin profile. This would best be done on a winding machine with 
automatic traverse. Adding a small shim on alternate sides of the traverse 
mechanism at the end of each layer would progressively narrow the winding 
width. On very large, hand-wound transformers, this would be done by 
hand. Various widths of insulating material could be used to guide the 
winder. 
Rectifier configurations in which one end of the transformer effectively 
operates at a DC potential, and the other end has all the AC voltage of the 
winding, are often desirable because they minimize the electrical stress on the 
transformer. 
Take, for example, a transformer that feeds a full wave bridge which 
delivers 28,000 V DC. Each end of the winding must be insulated for the 
peak AC voltage which appears there. If one DC terminal of the bridge is 
grounded, the stress on each end of the winding is 14,000 V DC Â± 14,000 V 
AC (peak). 
Now let us look at a full-wave doubler. Admittedly, the ripple amplitude 
may be higher, but it has some interesting consequences in transformer 
design. In Fig. 7-9, the end of the winding connected to the midpoint of the 
two capacitors floats at half the output voltage. The end connected to the 
two rectifiers goes from ground to 28,000 V, and so its operating level is seen 
to be 14,000 V DCÂ± 14,000 V AC (peak). Clearly, less insulation would be 
required in this situation-it would allow the physical size of the transformer 
to be reduced. In a given volume, more conservative stress levels could be 
employed. (It does, however, require identification of the winding termina-
tions in relation to the external rectifier circuit.) 
Another very useful configuration is the full-wave quadrupler shown in

Fig. 7-10. Note that one end of the winding floats at half the DC output 
voltage, and the other end has an AC voltage superimposed on that DC 
voltage. Since the full-wave quadrupler may be seen to be two full-wave 
doublers, that AC voltage must have a peak-to-peak value equal to half the 
output voltage. So our transformer secondary winding would have to 
develop 14,000 volts P-P or (for sine wave excitation) about 5,000 volts 
RMS. The RMS secondary current is, of course, twice that of the full-wave 
doubler (as found from Schade's curves in Appendix C). 
There you have it. Minimal working stress on the insulation system of the 
transformer, relatively few turns for the output voltage, and one end of the 
winding tied to a DC potential, with the tradeoff being higher ripple 
amplitude or larger output filter components. 
The case of the three-phase transformer with a wye secondary is extremely 
interesting (see Fig. 7-11). Wye secondaries are usually used for high output 
voltages, so that no one winding has to develop the entire output voltage. 
The number of turns of wire required is thereby minimized. On the other 
hand, for high current, low voltage secondaries a delta is usually used, so 
that all three secondaries may share the current for better thermal design and 
smaller conductor diameters. 
Note that the midpoint of the wye secondary shown above will float at half 
the DC output voltage. 
If the end of each secondary nearest the primary winding is connected to 
the wye center, a minimum of insulation is required between primary and 
secondary.

The insulation on the outside of each coil between it and the core must of 
course be half the DC output voltage plus the induced winding voltage. The 
insulation between coils (assuming sine wave excitation, 120Â° phase shift be-
tween coils) would be that necessary to hold off 1.5 times the peak AC 
voltage per leg. 
9. USE OF SHIELDS IN HIGH VOLTAGE TRANSFORMERS 
I am going to discuss a very important concept relating to the use of elec-
trostatic shields in high voltage transformers. This will lead in to general con-
cepts regarding use of shields in general-purpose transformers. Referring to 
fig. 7-12, let us look at a low-power supply (the bias supply) floating at high

voltage as part of the larger circuit including some of the load components 
and ground returns and showing some stray capacitances. 
Here we have a simplified schematic of some sort of high voltage 
regulator, controlling the power from the power supply to the load. Note the 
capacitors C 1 and C2. Let these represent the stray capacitance from the 
finish of the primary winding to the start of the secondary winding (C1), and 
from the finish of the secondary winding to the start of the primary winding 
(C2). Usually one (C1) will be relatively large and the other very small by 
comparison. A plausible value for the larger would be in the range of 30-300 
pF or so, depending. That capacitor is charged to essentially the full poten-
tial of the high voltage DC power supply. Let us say that the regulator tube 
arcs internally, some external part of the system flashes over to ground, or a 
triggered spark gap inside the high voltage power supply may fire. The 20 kV 
potential at the cathode of our vacuum tube goes essentially at once to 
ground. 
Now, what happened to C 1? A moment ago it was sitting there, blissfully 
charged to 20 k V. Let us look at the equivalent circuit of our new situation 
(Fig. 7-13). 
What is going to keep C 1 from discharging through this external circuit? 
Certainly not the components of the bias regulator-that is only a 200 volt 
regulator. The components certainly were not designed to withstand 20 kV. 
What else is left? The AC power line? Notice we have not drawn any explicit 
connections from the AC power line to ground. Do you think the AC power 
line is going to float up to some high voltage and nothing else connected to 
that power line would complain? No, indeed. 
We presume that one of the two AC input power terminals is usually pretty 
close to ground, but what about the other one? It goes to other things, maybe 
through a push button switch on the front panel. Is that switch rated to hold 
off 20 kV? What about the guy pushing the button?

You can see that at best, the energy stored in the interwinding capacitance 
of the transformer and other stray capacitances (there are always stray 
capacitances to somewhere from everything) will discharge only through the 
bias supply components, most likely blasting some component. At worst, the 
discharge path will include the AC power line, the switch on the front panel, 
the president of the company who bought your transformer to go in his 
equipment, and his customer (who happened to be touching both the presi-
dent and the cabinet containing the transformer). How does business look 
now? 
If there is a way, high voltage will find it. It is up to you to make it fool-
proof. Here is how: 
I. Control the stray capacitance between windings with electrostatic 
shields, so that the stray capacitance is to the shield and much less to other 
windings or the core. 
2. Provide absolute return paths for all stored energy, so that the dis-
charge path of that energy is controlled by design. 
3. Ensure that stored energy is returned to its source. 
4. If such a discharge path must pass through an area containing sensitive 
components, then install energy-diverting components such that it passes 
around, not through. 
Let us look at a start on doing this (Fig. 7-14). Here we have a basic con-
cept. Notice how the energy stored in the capacitance of the winding to the 
right-hand shield is only that associated with the output voltage of the bias 
supply itself. 
Notice how the right-hand shield is at the high voltage source point for the 
circuit. 
Notice how the left-hand shield becomes a return path for the energy 
stored in the capacitance of the high voltage shield.

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
Notice how the primary winding is now shielded from high voltage tran-
sients. 
On paper this works very nicely, but in the real world there is a minor 
detail which deserves our attention. The wire from the left-hand shield in 
Fig. 7-14 to "ground" has some inductance, associated mainly with its 
length. A high voltage arc is a fast rising spike, with a rise time in 
nanoseconds. The discharge current will therefore develop a voltage spike of 
some magnitude along that ground return wire, thereby elevating the poten-
tial of the left-hand shield to, in some cases, an appreciable fraction of the 
high voltage supply. In this case a moderate transient would be coupled into 
the AC power line. The solution is to add a third shield (Fig. 7-15). 
There is another reason for the third shield. "Ground" is sometimes a 
nebulous location. The exact point at which the low potential point of the 
high voltage energy storage capacitor is located is rarely the point at 
"ground" to which a high voltage arc will leap. The high frequency im-
pedance between these two points may also develop a voltage due to the arc, 
and this voltage can also appear on the middle shield of Fig. 7-15. The left-
hand shield of that figure serves to conduct those transients into power line 
ground. Since any properly designed high voltage system contains a low im-
pedance path from the prime power ground reference to high voltage 
ground, this concept provides for positive control of high voltage transients. 
The implementation of this technique in most transformers requires that 
the two shields associated with the high voltage circuitry (the two right 
shields of Fig. 7-15) be located both between the primary and secondary 
windings and on the outside of the secondary winding. This is shown ex-
plicitly in Fig. 7-16. 
In addition to controlling the energy stored in the stray capacitance be-
tween the external surface of the high voltage winding and nearby com-
ponents, it has the convenient advantage that the external surface of the unit 
is now largely at ground. The spacing to nearby components is thus made less 
critical and the tendency for dust pickup and corona is reduced.

You may note that I haven't said what to connect the core to. It varies 
somewhat. In high voltage transformers it is usually connected to chassis 
common. In high frequency inverter transformers (usually for reasons of 
noice control, but perhaps on occasion for other reasons) it may need to be 
connected to high frequency AC common, or perhaps power line common, 
or it may even be appropriate to allow it to float. I'm not going to give you a 
pat answer to this because there isn't one. Look at each individual situation 
in a new unit of time, use your common sense, and do what seems right. If 
the results aren't optimum, repeat the above steps. 
There is an additional consideration peculiar to high frequency inverters 
operating off the AC power line. If high frequency noise spikes on the 
primary winding are giving electromagnetic interference problems, it would 
be appropriate to place an additional shield on each side of the primary 
winding (above and below) and return that to the power common point of 
the inverter transformer drive circuitry. This serves to return the currents 
due to those voltage transitions to their source. In this implementation, our 
transformer would now appear as shown in Fig. 7-17.

low noise power supplies. It may be, when all appropriate shields have been 
implemented and properly connected, that a certain very small amount of 
AC ripple exists on the load. All attempts to remove it fail, and the regulator 
does not appear to be generating it. There may be some indication that it acts 
like common mode noise at the transformer operating frequency, and that it 
seems to be coming somehow from the transformer. It could very well be 
stray capacitance from the winding edges, coming out past the shields and 
going to the core or elsewhere. The cure for that is to make the shields wider 
than the winding, bend the edges inwards, or make total box shields or some 
such. This is extremely difficult to implement on high voltage transformers. 
There is another possibility which should be evaluated first. Assume that 
we are still talking about the transformer of Fig. 7-17, and that we are look-
ing at the last layer of the secondary winding and the shield right above it (the 
first shield to the right of the secondary winding in Fig. 7-17-see Fig. 7-18). 
You can see that there is some stray capacitance from each turn of the 
winding to the shield. There is a (different) AC potential on each turn, and 
different AC currents will flow between each turn and the shield. The source 
of those currents is the turns of the windings themselves. Those currents will 
return to those sources. The only question if how. If the shield were returned 
to the last turn of the winding, then that total current would just circulate 
back through the turns of the winding to their sources. However, that shield 
is returned to the output of the regulator. The current will therefore circulate 
back through the external circuitry and its impedance (current sensing 
resistors, wiring inductance, rectifier diodes, etc.) to get back to its source. 
That current, flowing through that impedance, gives rise to a voltage which 
modulates the output voltage of our regulators. 
The solution in this case is to implement first and last layer shields on each 
winding where needed. Our transformer (and a rather general one it is) now 
would look like Fig. 7-19, with the shields numbered for reference. 
Now that you have learned to do it the hard way, we can take a few short 
cuts. 
Very rarely would all these shields be needed in every circumstance. Some

Fig. 7-19. Transformer with all necessary shields for any occasion. 
circuit configurations can greatly simplify the implementation of needed 
shields. You will see that some become phantom shields, their function 
merged into that of another shield. Take the full-wave doubler of Fig. 7-20, 
for example. The following comments would apply equally well to the 
balanced quadrupler of Fig. 7-10. Let us look at what we have here. Our ex-
perience and the customer's application have (presumably) told us that 
primary first and last layer shields (2 and 3 of Fig. 7-19) are not needed. We 
have the AC power line and not a high frequency inverter for an AC power 
source, so shields I and 4 of Fig. 7-19 are not needed. Shield A of Fig. 7-20 
corresponds to shield 5 of Fig. 7-19. 
Shield C is beneath the first layer of the secondary, and shield 0 is above 
the last layer. Shield C clearly corresponds to the first layer shield 8, but it 
also fulfills the function of shield 7 even though it is not connected to the 
high voltage output. Being connected to the junction of the two filter 
capacitors (which are, or should be, identical and of reasonably low induc-
tance) it has a low impedance path to the high voltage output. Note also that 
the insulation required between it and shield Bat ground must only hold off 
half the output voltage.

Shield D clearly corresponds to shield 10. Being above the last layer and 
returned to one end of the winding, one might think that it would perform 
some of the function of the last layer shield (9). As it turns out, it does. Not 
as well as a discrete last layer shield might, but fairly well in most cases, and 
the benefits are free. Note that the insulation between shield D and the last 
layer of the winding must hold off only the AC voltage developed by the 
secondary winding. 
Shield E corresponds to shield 11. Note that here also the insulation re-
quired between shields D and E is only half the DC output voltage. 
A similar line of reasoning may be used for the primary shields to be asso-
ciated with the primary winding of a high-frequency inverter transformer 
when the drive circuitry is a half bridge. 
You see that once you understand the theory behind shields in trans-
formers, you can look at a particular situation and determine which of these 
shields are necessary and, from their function, specify the proper location 
for connecting them. Some manufacturers of transformers will install the 
five shields of Fig. 7-20 but not tell the customer exactly what they did. To 
all external appearances, the transformer may have no shields whatsoever if 
shields A, B, and E are connected internally to the mounting surface of the 
transformer. The performance will be noticeably different from one without 
any shields. 
There is a very important detail relating to shield construction in certain 
types of high voltage transformers. In certain applications, a high voltage 
transformer may have a shield which is held at the DC isolation poten-
tial-such as a transformer which supplies low voltages (heater, etc.) to a 
load floating at a high potential-or our transformer may be a doubler or 
quadrupler high voltage output transformer with a shield floating at half the 
output potential. In either case, the application may be one in which the load 
can arc or be crowbarred. In that case, the energy stored in the capacitance 
of the shield to ground will discharge very rapidly. Most designers will con-
struct the shield by connecting the external lead to one end of the foil, taping 
the start of the shield down, wrapping the foil around the coil, taping down 
the finish, and proceeding with the construction and winding of the coil. Let 
us look at the charge distribution of such an arrangement (Fig. 7-21). 
Consider what happens when there is an arc and the high voltage shield is 
abruptly shorted to ground. A high peak current flows out of the shield lead 
as all the charge stored in the high voltage shield capacitance flows rapidly to 
ground. Note, however, that some of the charges of Fig. 7-21 are on the op-
posite side of the core from the shield lead. That charge must flow through 
the hole in the middle of the core in order to reach ground. That charge Iran-

sient induces a high voltage transient in every turn of every winding on the 
transformer. In a 20,000-volt isolation transformer it can theoretically ap-
proach 20,000 volts per turn! In practice, core losses and the stray 
capacitance of other windings will damp it considerably, but an induced 
voltage spike of even 200 volts per turn can create a very nasty transient, 
which can not only cause external components to fail, but also can cause 
dielectric failures within the winding structure. 
The way to virtually eliminate this problem is to balance the stored charge 
on the shield so that half of it discharges in each of two opposite directions 
through the core, and a minimum of the charge passes through the core in 
the first place. Such a balanced construction is shown in Fig. 7-22. 
Notice that the shield connection is at the outside center of the coil, so the 
charge stored on the shield inside the core flows symmetrically in both direc-
tions away from the center line; thus in theory the net induced voltage is zero 
if the stored charge on each half of the shield portion inside the core window 
is zero. Notice also that most of the charge stored on the shield is discharged 
externally, without ever flowing through the core at all. Constructing a 
shield in this manner requires no more effort than constructing it the wrong 
way, and one creates not only a vastly more reliable transformer but imparts 
much more reliability to the circuitry the transformer serves. System 
reliability is thus raised, and that's really what it's all about. 
The attentive reader will notice that the correctly implemented shield, hav-

ing no flux linkages to the core, has in effect very little equivalent series in-
ductance. It thus acts as an effective shield in high frequency or low noise ap-
plications. Contrast this with the worst possible shield implementation, that 
in which copper foil laminated to mylar tape (mylar slightly wider than the 
foil) is wrapped around a toroid to effect a "shield" between windings on a 
toroidal transformer. Each wrap of the shield adds another large increment 
of inductance in series with the shunt capacitance of the shield, and the first 
part of the shield is almost entirely isolated from the last part for high fre-
quencies! The virtual impracticality of implementing an effective high 
voltage shield on a toroidal transformer is a very good reason for not design-
ing high voltage toroidal transformers if any other implementation is possi-
ble. 
An awareness of these concepts will greatly facilitate the design of reliable 
compact high voltage transformers. As the designer is now aware, it requires 
not only clever theoretical design but meticulous attention to the physical 
details of transformer fabrication and processing to ensure that the designer 
ends up with what he thought he was designing.

HEAT TRANSFER 
1. INTRODUCTION 
There is one concept, the most basic and important, which the engineer must 
understand about heat in transformers or in any component. 
It does not vanish. It does not go away. It goes somewhere-and you have 
to make sure that it can go wherever you want it to, and easily. 
Heat is energy. It flows, whenever there is a temperature difference, from 
a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. If an 
energy source is generating heat in a certain volume at a constant rate, the 
temperature of that volume will rise until the temperature difference between 
that volume and its surroundings is sufficiently high that some heat transfer 
mechanism will remove heat as fast as it is being generated. (There is always 
some heat transfer mechanism available. There is no such thing as a perfect 
insulator.) 
The stuff of which this universe is made, if left to its own devices, appears 
to behave in a certain repeatable fashion. We call this behavior natura/laws. 
The conservation of energy is one of these laws. The fact that we call these 
observed phenomena laws does not mean that nothing will ever happen that 
violates them-it just means that over a great period of time many in-
dividuals have made careful and extensive observations, and things seem to 
have behaved in a certain consistent manner so far. In order to express our 
confidence (and our desire) that things continue to behave as they seem to, 
we call some physical phenomena laws. It is well to bear this in mind, as 
sometimes natural laws turn out to be nothing more than someone's fixed 
idea of how they suppose things are. At one time "everybody knew" that 
heavier-than-air machines could not possibly fly, and that the sun revolved 
around the earth. 
165 

166 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
In this subject we are dealing with some fairly basic, well known 
phenomena. Heat can be transferred by three basic means-conduction, 
convection, and radiation. There are also other phenomena involving heat 
transfer. The Peltier and Seebeck effects involve the conversion of heat to 
electricity and vice versa by the passage of an electric current through the 
junction of dissimilar conductors. Thermocouples and thermoelectric 
coolers operate on these principles. The Nernst effect involves an electric po-
tential developed by the flow of heat across a magnetic field. Certain salts 
can be cooled by application and removal of a magnetic field. These 
phenomena have very little to do with conventional transformer design. The 
heat absorbed by a liquid when it boils, called the heat of vaporization, is 
very important in some liquid-cooled designs and will be discussed later in 
this chapter. 
The manifestations of energy most relevant to this subject are the motion 
of masses and the exchange or transfer of quanta of electromagnetic energy, 
called photons. The transfer of photons is called radiation. 
Energy can be transferred by the coupling of motion from one mass to 
another, or the transmission of a photon from a particle to free space or to 
another particle. When a particle of mass transmits a photon, it loses some 
of its energy of motion. When it absorbs a photon it gains energy of motion. 
When the particles that comprise a mass have more (random) energy of mo-
tion, the mass is said to have a higher temperature. 
2. CONDUCTION 
In the heat transfer mechanism called conduction, two masses are physically 
coupled together. The energy of motion of the particles comprising one por-
tion is coupled to the other portion across the area of contact. 
3. CONVECTION 
In the heat transfer mechanism called convection, some portion of our sys-
tem is a liquid or gas in which the particles have attractive forces much 
weaker than those present in solids. In liquid or gases the particles are free to 
move independently under the influence of attractive or external forces. A 
hotter liquid or gas is less dense than a cooler one and the greater energy of 
motion of the individual particles keeps them further apart. Reduced density 
of some portion of a liquid or gas relative to some other portion causes the 
lower-density portion to experience a buoyant upward force. Bulk physical 
motion is thereby coupled into the fluid, and the heated material moves up-
ward and presumably away from the heating surface. A cooler portion of the 

HEAT TRANSFER 
167 
fluid is pulled in from beneath to take its place, and we have a net transport 
of thermal energy away from the hotter region. The reverse effect takes place 
when a hot fluid meets a cooler surface or portion of the fluid. 
The convection phenomenon requires the presence of acceleration or a 
gravitational field. In the absence of gravity or acceleration there is no con-
vection. 
4. RADIATION 
Heat transfer by radiation is the absorption or emission of photons by par-
ticles of mass. Particles of mass, since they have electromagnetic properties, 
radiate energy when they are in motion. They are surrounded by other 
similarly behaving particles, and so an equilibrium condition is attained 
where the emission and absorption of photons is equal, and on the average 
our particles neither gain nor lose energy. 
Nothing can be totally isolated from radiative heat transfer. At any 
temperature above absolute zero (- 273 .l6Â°C) particles radiate energy. 
Deep space (between galaxies) is filled with background radiation at about 
3 o above absolute zero. 
The intensity of radiation from an object depends on the fourth power of 
its absolute temperature. The intensity of radiation from one object to 
another (the rate of radiative heat transfer per unit area) depends on the dif-
ference in the fourth powers of their absolute temperatures. It also depends 
on a property of the surface called emissivity. For a perfect "black body" 
radiator the emissivity (t) is unity. For everything in the real world it is Jess 
than one, and greater than zero. 
f is about 0.9 for most electrical nonconductors, and for metals coated or 
painted at least 0.002 in. thick with an externally nonconducting material. 
The decision of whether or not to coat a metal part to enhance heat transfer 
through radiation but slightly inhibit heat transfer through convection, can 
be made for a particular case depending on the temperatures and the 
temperature differences involved. For metals f varies roughly from 0.04 
(copper) to 0.25 (polished stainless steel). The lower range relates to 
materials of lower electrical resistivity, with f increasing roughly as the 
resistivity. 
5. HEAT TRANSFER 
Radiative heat transfer is not always a significant heat transfer mode in 
transformers, since it presumes a fairly "toasty" design (or a high altitude or 
space application). The case of (for example) 5511Jo convective heat transfer, 

168 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
45117o radiative heat transfer presumes a particular transformer-to-ambient 
temperature relationship. Fig. 8-1 shows the radiative heat transfer coeffi-
cient for various temperatures. A comparison of this graph with the one for 
convective heat transfer (Fig. 8-5) will indicate the magnitude of the dif-
ference between these mechanisms at the operating temperature of a par-
ticular design. One can definitely not make the blanket assumption that 
some particular fraction of the heat will be transferred by radiation and the 
balance by convection. 
When uncertain about what the operating temperature of a unit will be, ig-
nore the radiative component (it can only help lower the temperature) and 
calculate the temperature based on convection off the exposed surface and 
conduction through the mounting surface, and see what the temperature rise 
is. The radiative component can then be allowed for, new convection and 
conduction characteristics calculated, and the actual temperature arrived at 
by successive approximation. 
In calculating heat flow through the mounting surface, remember that the 
heat, once transferred to the chassis, has to go somewhere. There is a certain

resistance to heat flow through matter, so the chassis temperature at the heat 
source will be higher than elsewhere (unless, of course, something else which 
generates a lot of heat is mounted on the chassis right next to the trans-
former-but that is not usually wise). 
The concept of thermal resistance to heat flow is directly analogous to the 
opposition a resistance offers to the flow of a current. The thermal energy 
corresponds to electrical current, and the voltage drop corresponds to the 
temperature difference. 
6. HEAT FLOW AND THERMAL RESISTANCE 
Just as we use R = ell A and E = I R to calculate the resistivity and voltage 
drop of an electrical conductor, so we use T max= Tsurface + Q(b/Ak) to 
calculate temperature drop. Q is heat input in watts, b is the conduction 
length, A is the area the heat flows across, and k is the thermal conductivity 
of the material (the reciprocal of bulk thermal resistivity). bl A corresponds 
to the term II A used to calculate resistance, and T max = Tsurface + Q(b/ Ak) 
corresponds toE= Â£ 0 + /R, Ohm's law with a zero offset term to correct 
for the potential of the surroundings. 
Take the case of a simple slab of material, of area A and thickness b, with 
a heat input on one surface of Q watts (Fig. 8-2):

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
You may have seen the thermal resistance of a transistor to its mounting 
surface or the thermal resistance of a heat sink expressed in degrees C per 
watt. Each has a particular area, and so for each item there is a particular 
thermal resistance which we can add just as with electrical resistors in series. 
The temperature rise of a composite of several slabs (assuming zero ther-
mal resistance at the interfaces)* is given by Fig. 8-3: 
(8.3) 
When we have a uniformly heated volume (such as a winding on a core or 
the core itself) the temperature rise is shown in Fig. 8-4. 
With the heat uniformly generated at q watts per cubic inch, 
Yzqb 2 
T max = Tsurface + 
k' 
(8.4) 
where k' is the thermal conductivity determined by the volume percentage of 
metal filling the dielectric medium of thermal conductivity k. 
With reference, to Fig. 8-4, Table 8-1 gives the thermal conductivity 
enhancement of a dielectric of thermal conductivity k uniformly filled with 
wire, heat flow transverse to the wire cross sections. 
In the case where our material is anisotropic, we would calculate the ther-
mal conductivity in each direction separately. The thermal resistance to heat 
flow across the turns of a foil-wound coil or across the laminations of a tape-
wound core would be found by starting at the midpoint (or wherever the axis 
or plane of no heat flow is located) and, using the method of Fig. 8-3 or the 
data of Table 8-1, summing the thermal resistance of each layer of metal and 
insulation. In the case of a coil wound with layers of round wire, the thermal 
resistance along a layer is the thermal resistance of resin, 700Jo metal-filled, 
plus the thermal resistance of the resin-filled margins. In the case of the ends 
of a foil-wound coil, the thermal resistance of dielectric in the margins would 
be added to the (very low) thermal resistance from the center to one side of 
the winding. Conduction or convection heat transfer coefficients can then be 
added on to obtain a total thermal resistance in each direction and a total 
temperature rise. 
Convective heat transfer may be via either natural convection, in which 
*This, by the way, is not a trivial assumption.

Depending on the particular situation, the boundary layer thickness 
associated with natural convection in air is on the order of Y-1-l in. This 
tends to round off the surface contours of objects. Therefore, even though 
one may calculate the exact surface area of a transformer in excruciating 
detail, the effective surface area for natural convection is closer to the sur-
face area of a plastic bag pulled tightly around the transformer. For vertical 
fins, as height increases the fins become somewhat more effective due to the 
chimney effect (i.e., the greater the column of low density air, the greater the 
buoyant force), imparting greater convective velocity to the fluid, and 
thereby reducing the boundary layer thickness. For transformers molded in a 
high thermal conductivity material one could enhance the surface heat 
transfer efficiency either with molded fins, bonded metal fins, or molded 
holes in the unit. 
Figure 8-5 gives the convective heat transfer per unit length for either a 
thin vertical slab or a cylinder of diameter equal to the slab height for various 
heights (diameters). Note that the same curves represent both shapes. 
One could evidently obtain the convective heat transfer coefficient for the 
transformer of Fig. 8-6 in the following manner: Take the convective heat 
transfer coefficient of a cylinder of length Z and diameter the average of X 
and Y; add to that the convective heat transfer coefficient of two slabs of 
height the average of Wand Yand length XV (the two slabs approximate the 
ends). The sum of those two convective heat transfer coefficients will give a 
fair approximation of the total convective heat tram fer coefficient. To this

Fig. 8-6. Approximating the convective heat transfer coefficient for a transformer in air. 
may be added, if desired, the conductive heat transfer coefficient repre-
sented by heat flow across the core laminations, across the mounting surface 
interface, and the thermal conductivity of the chassis to the heat spreading 
out into it. Keep in mind (as will be shown later) that heat from the core is not 
necessarily transferred uniformly from all surfaces. Laminated cores 
transfer their heat mostly at the lamination edges. 
In the case of forced convection of air, given some number of linear feet 
per minute of air flowing parallel to the transformer surface (or an estimate 
of the air velocity being stirred past the whole surface), the simplest solution 
to calculating forced convection heat transfer is to determine the effective 
heat transfer surface area of the transformer, smoothing the contours to 
withinÂ± in. or so, and then (having in hand the catalogs of various semicon-
ductor heat sink manufacturers) look up various heat sinks which have 
similar surface areas. Take the published thermal resistance of that heat sink 
as the thermal resistance from surface to ambient for the particular case. 
This gives a fairly reasonable approximation to reality. 
Exact calculation of forced convection heat transfer coefficients is an abil-
ity which can take longer to learn than transformer design. A number of 
references on the subject are given at the end of this chapter. 
The heat of fusion (melting or freezing of a solid) or heat of vaporization 
(boiling of a liquid-heat given up when the vapor condenses) are special 
heat transfer situations in which the material exhibits thermal energy storage 
characteristics at some point as the temperature increases or decreases. Once 
the fluid has absorbed its heat of vaporization, it then boils and the thermal 
energy is carried off as vapor. The heat of vaporization of liquids used as 
boiling coolants can be quite significant. Water absorbs about one calorie 
per gram for every centigrade degree of temperature increase, but when it 
boils it carries off 540 calories per gram. Fluorochemical liquid FC-77 ab-

sorbs 0.25 calorie per gram for every centigrade degree of temperature rise, 
but when it boils it carries off 20 calories per gram. 
A very interesting device called a heat pipe is sometimes used where one 
must remove a moderate amount of heat with very little temperature rise and 
deposit it elsewhere. A heat pipe basically consists of a sealed tube lined with 
a wick, the wick saturated with a fluid, and a clear space down the middle 
(Fig. 8-7). 
A heat input at one end vaporizes the fluid out of the wick. The vapor 
flows to a cooler portion of the heat pipe and condenses back into liquid, 
which flows back up the wick by capillary action. Since evaporation and con-
densation take place at virtually the same temperature (there is only a 
miniscule temperature difference between the ends of the heat pipe, 
associated with the pressure drop of the vapor flowing through the central 
space) the heat pipe transfers heat with almost no temperature drop. By way 
of comparison with conventional materials, a simple heat pipe an inch in 
diameter can have the same thermal resistance as a bar of solid copper a foot 
in diameter. 
7. FLUOROCHEMICALS 
Typical properties of some fluorochemicals are shown in Table 8-2. It is 
noteworthy that the dielectric strength of the vapor is comparable to that of 
the liquid, which makes fluorochemicals ideal for the cooling by boiling of 
components in a high voltage environment. 
While water solubility may be on the order of a few parts per million and 
oil solubility may be quite low, the presence of such contamination or of dust 
or dirt of any kind can adversely affect the dielectric strength of fluorochem-
icals, as can dissolved gasses. 
A rough indication of comparative heat transfer coefficients is given in 
Fig. 8-8.

8. BOILING LIQUID HEAT TRANSFER 
In the event that the heat flux from the component being cooled is suffi-
ciently high to cause the fluorochemical to boil, the component temperature 
tends to stabilize somewhat above the boiling point of the coolant. This is 
shown in Fig. 8-9 for some materials. The heat flux transfer capability does 
not increase without limit, however. There comes a "boiling crisis" at a 
critical heat flux where the liquid cannot contact the surface because the hot 
vapor forces it away faster than the vapor can leave and allow liquid to con-
tact the surface. At this point the component temperature rises abruptly, the 
superheated vapor next to the component carries enough heat from the com-
ponent to boil the liquid before it even touches the component, and the com-
ponent gets hot enough to transfer a fair amount of heat by radiation. The 
heat flux associated with this sudden, tremendous temperature rise at the 
boiling crisis is referred to as the maximum heat flux or the burnout heat 
flux, for an obvious reason. 
One may calculate (or at least obtain a fair estimate) of the burnout heat 
flux from the following equation:

on the fluid, the exact geometry involved, and the patterns of

from time to time. 
In other words, sometimes it will burn out at a lower heat flux than at 
another time. I would suggest that when using boiling liquids for heat 
transfer, one stay well below the calculated burnout heat flux (by at least a 
factor of three or four). 

180

Visual observation of the unit in action in order to ensure that it is well 
below the burnout heat flux is also recommended in applications where one 
is pushing to the limit. 
9. SOME COMMENTS ON MATERIALS 
AND PACKAGING 
Commonly used liquids for dielectric and heat transfer requirements in-
clude refined mineral oil such as Shell Diala-AX, silicone fluids such as Dow 
Corning's, or the fully fluorinated liquids offered by 3M under the trade 
name Fluorinert. High thermal conductivity potting materials are available 
from (among others) Bacon Industries, Emerson Cummings, and National 
Beryllia. 
Silicone fluids have excellent dielectric strength but are somewhat hy-
groscopic, i.e., they absorb water from the air and hold onto it, somewhat to 
the detriment of their ultimate electrical capabilities. They also tend to 
polymerize in an arc and are not necessarily self-healing. 
Liquid-filled systems must have some means for accommodating the coef-
ficient of volumetric expansion associated with the change in temperature of 
a heated liquid. This is usually either a flexible membrane inside the case with 
the dry side vented to ambient pressure, a bellows system, or a gas cushion, 
wherein the gas pressure is allowed to increase as the liquid expands and 
compresses it. Sulfur hexafluoride is preferred as the gas because it has very 
good insulating properties (about 120 kV /in. at 1 atm.). 
Sulfur hexafluoride is also used as a dielectric and heat transfer gas in 
hermetically sealed transformer and power supply designs. With a density 
about five times that of air and a specific heat of about half that of air, 
respectable convective heat transfer rates can be achieved. 
10. A CALCULATION OF THERMAL RESISTANCE 
FOR AN ANISOTROPIC OBJECT 
Just for an example, let us look at the thermal conductivity of a tape-wound 
C-core. Assume 12 mil silicon steel, with a 950Jo space factor. That means 
that 50Jo of the volume is taken up with interlaminar insulation. If our core 
cross section is 2 x 2 in., then 50Jo of the 2 in. E dimension is insulation. 
Whether we calculate it as 1.9 in. of steel and 0.1 in. of insulation or 12 mils 
of steel and 0.6 mils of insulation, etc., we will obtain the same result. 
The thermal conductivity of steel is -0.1 cal/sec/cm/cm2/Â°C, and that of 
our insulation (usually a varnish) is estimated to be 0.0004. Since both steel 

HEAT TRANSFER 
181 
and varnish have equal areas, our composite thermal resistance per unit 
length would be the sum of each length divided by the conductivity of that 
length:

19 + 250 = 269

k = 0.0075. 
This is less than one-tenth of the conductivity of the steel in the perpen-
dicular direction, where the heat flows through the steel laminations out to 
the edges of the core. What we did here was to add the thermal resistances of 
two items to get the thermal resistance of the two items in series. 
From Fig. 8-3, we see that this is the technique used for calculating heat 
flow through composite structures. If we wanted to calculate the tempera-
ture rise of our C-core, which generates its heat as core loss throughout its 
volume, we would use Fig. 8-4, except that we would use fork' our k num-
ber determined above. Since the thermal conductivity is different in each 
direction, more heat will flow in one direction than another. Our total tem-
perature rise would be (extending the idea of Fig. 8-4 from the reasoning of 
Fig. 8-3 and expressing the heat flow parallel and perpendicular to the lami-
nations separately): 
bJ_ 
T max = T 1- surface + Yz q 1- --
kl-
T max will be the peak temperature at the inside of our C-core. T max is equal 
for the above two equations. 
We can observe that q J_ + q I is the total q representing the heat generated 
by the core loss in a particular volume and we know that more heat will flow 
parallel to the laminations than perpendicular. In this case we have a sym-
metrical situation, and while we have some nonlinear effects at the corners, 
we will simply say that there is, to a first order, no interaction between the 

182 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
components, so b .L and b 1 are equal. (For our 2 x 2 in. cross section, the 
planes of no heat flow are perpendicular to the outer surfaces and intersect in 
the middle, so both b's are equal to 1 in.) We now have two equations and 
four unknowns (the two surface T's and the two q's). If our core is potted in 
a high thermal conductivity epoxy (much higher than k 1) then equal 
temperatures will be forced at both surfaces. We can then solve for the heat 
flow in each direction. 
If our C-core is convection cooled, we must add the thermal resistance as-
sociated with the convective heat transfer coefficient off each surface for an 
assumed temperature of each surface. Add the q's thus obtained and see if 
they add up to the given total q. Make a new guess at the surface 
temperatures and repeat the above procedure. By a successive approxima-
tion procedure we can find the heat flow in each direction and the 
temperature rise over ambient for each surface. As the reader will find when 
he does this, with a thermal resistance in one direction over ten times that in 
the other direction, very little heat flows perpendicular to the laminations 
and the temperature rise over ambient at the surface where the edges of the 
laminations are exposed (the surfaces that get the heat which flows parallel 
to the laminations) is much greater than at the two perpendicular surfaces. 
This is why some effort must be made to cool the edges of tape-wound 
C-cores where significant heat is generated in the core. The same reasoning 
holds true for cores assembled from stacks of E-1 laminations. 
The problem can be particularly severe for three-phase transformers con-
structed with tape-wound E-cores, as coils are wound on all three legs and 
very little of the core edges are exposed. It is therefore important that some 
type of heat spreader be considered, or that the coil be spaced away from the 
core on those two surfaces to allow convection of a heat transfer fluid along 
the core edges.

MATERIALS AND 
FABRICATION METHODS 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The preceeding chapters showed how to design various types of magnetic 
components and discussed their function in some applications. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to familiarize the novice designer with 
basic fabrication techniques that he can understand, apply, and modify as 
needed, using materials suitable to his specific situation. Many of the 
fabrication techniques and considerations developed over the last century or 
so are included. I have not made an attempt to cover every facet of the sub-
ject in detail. After the designer has become familiar with the fabrication 
methods in this chapter, variations will suggest themselves from particular 
circumstances which arise in the course of design work. 
The mention of one or a few materials does not imply that nothing else ex-
ists. A tape manufacturer such as 3M has hundreds or even thousands of 
products, many of which are suitable for use in the fabrication of magnetic 
components. It would be impossible to discuss all types of materials for all 
applications in a book of easily readable length. A few items are mentioned 
here for the purpose of developing a basic familiarity with enough different 
materials to suit a fairly wide variety of applications. 
A particular manufacturer or his product may be mentioned for conve-
nience of reference. This does not imply that other manufacturers have in-
ferior products. They may have superior products. When a manufacturer is 
mentioned as having a unique material or capability, it is to be understood 
that the uniqueness is only within the experience and awareness of the 
author.

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
The reader is urged to talk to his local suppliers of magnet wire and 
materials, to discuss his specific requirements with several core manufac-
turers, and generally make his own determination among his various 
sources. With that out of the way, we begin with the concept of thermal 
classes. 
2. THERMAL CLASSES OF DIELECTRIC MEDIA 
Insulating materials are classed by the manufacturer according to how well 
they retain their insulating properties after long exposure to elevated 
temperatures. This is done by picking a set of temperatures and assigning 
each a designation (for convenience of reference). For a life expectancy of, 
say, 10,000 hr at a "maximum rated" temperature, the subject material is 
tested at each temperature. The probability of failure within the (10,000 hr) 
life expectancy will be lowest at the lowest temperature, and higher at higher 
temperatures. If an unacceptable failure rate is I <1Jo at 10,000 hr, it is a simple 
matter to test materials and assign them thermal classes. It is all ultimately 
based on the chemical stability of various kinds of polymers, minerals, or 
other chemical compounds with time and temperature. 
MIL-T -27 references certain thermal classes which magnetic components 
may be specified to meet. The thermal classes of dielectric media are derived 
from an AlEE standard. To some degree these are related (see Table 9-1). 
MIL-T -27 specifies a 12-week life cycle test (2,016 hr) for units with a 
10,000 hr life expectancy. A number of samples from the production lot (a 
qualification lot) are tested in a specified manner. No failures are permitted. 
The dielectric loss of a particular dielectric at the maximum working 
temperature can have a great deal to do with the reliability of a pulse trans-

former or high frequency power magnetic component. One dielectric failure 
mode is related to the self-heating of the dielectric in regions of intense high 
frequency electric fields by the high frequency loss of the dielectric, which in-
creases as the temperature increases. This leads to thermal runaway in the di-
electric in microscopic regions around defects or impurities. Dielectric media 
should be chosen only after consultation with the manufacturer regarding 
their loss properties at frequency and temperature. 
The corona threshold of a finished unit is an excellent test for assessing the 
reliability of a high voltage transformer. The test parameters should be 
chosen so as to bear a realistic relationship to the actual working conditions 
of the unit. The most severe corona threshold test is with square wave excita-
tion; this test should be used when that is the actual working condition. The 
rise time of the square wave in the corona test should of course be com-
parable to the actual rise time of the circuit in which the transformer 
operates. Information on corona threshold testing may be found in 
MIL-T -27 and its references, as well as from manufacturers of corona test-
ing equipment such as Biddle. 
3. INSULATING PAPERS 
Several common types of insulating papers are available for the combined 
functions of electrical insulation and mechanical support. The choice of 
which to use is governed by several factors. The mechanical stiffness of the 
material must be appropriate to the wire size. For foil-wound coils, a high 
degree of cut-through resistance is often necessary because the copper sheet, 
when slit, may have a sharp burr on one or both edges which can puncture 
some sheet materials.* A soft, porous material may be appropriate for en-
suring impregnation of layer-wound coils of many turns of fine wire with 
high dielectric stress. 
For class I 05 or 130 applications, kraft paper, a specially processed, acid-
free paper (also called blue-line neutral kraft), is appropriate. It is made in 
two forms-an easily impregnated paper ranging from Vz mil to 5 mils, and a 
stiff, dense paper which does not impregnate too well (called Fibrelec) in 
thicknesses of 7 mils or more.** 
Copaco, a stiff lOOo/o rag paper, is available from Lenni Products. It is 
particularly convenient for heavy wire(# 10-20) as it comes on rolls with the 
â¢ Thin Sheet Metals Co. can provide degreased copper foil slit to width with a burr less than 5"7o 
of material thickness. 
â¢â¢The Schweitzer Division of Kimberly-Clark in Lee, Massachusetts, is an excellent source of a 
wide variety of kraft papers.

edges folded over about Y. in. This material is called cuff, and the paper is 
said to be cuffed. It not only gives greatly enhanced stiffness at the coil ends 
where it is most needed, but serves as a convenient control of margin spac-
ing. These materials do not impregnate all that well. However, over the last 
five years over 1000 units of one design using 15 mil Copaco and vacuum im-
pregnation with a Class 155 epoxy resin have been operating in the field at 
500 volts per mil for a 1 microsecond pulse, with most of the units running 8 
hours per day, 250 days per year, at 15 pulses per second. The units are 
guaranteed to have a life of 109 pulses at 15Hz. To date there have been no 
electrical failures. 
For Class 155 or 180 applications, or for higher reliability at lower 
temperatures, several interesting materials are available. DuPont offers a 
polyimide paper called Nomex. It has exceptional high temperature 
capabilities, and is available in a soft, porous paper called Nomex 411 and a 
stiff, dense paper called Nomex 410. The combination of Nomex 411 im-
pregnated with 3M's epoxy #280 (an oven-curing Class 155 system) has 
shown excellent reliability in a variety of applications. 
Chase-Foster (and others) offer a variety of composite dielectric papers. 
Kraft paper or a polyester fabric may be laminated on either side of Mylar; 
Copaco may be laminated to Mylar; or Nomex may be laminated to Kapton. 
Kapton is a polyimide film made by DuPont, to which epoxies bond readily. 
Epoxies do not bond well to Mylar (Mylar film is often used as a release 
film). The composites of Mylar are treated with adhesion-promoting inter-
mediate materials in order to provide structural integrity. 
Nomex-Kapton-Nomex laminate, interleaved with Nomex 411 (the only 
available laminates at present being with the more dense Nomex 410), such 
that about 1511!o to 200Jo of the thickness is Kapton, seem to do well even at 
500 volts per mil. They should have exceptional life, as the Kapton film stops 
the "corona trees" which develop with high electrical stress and can lead to 
dielectric breakdown. If one were to decide to use this system an interleaved 
dielectric of, say, 2 mil Kapton and 10 mil Nom ex 411 could be manually 
wound. Chase-Foster may make Kapton/Nomex 411 laminates available in 
the future, but they report little demand to date. 
A West Coast supplier of insulating papers and films who does not object 
to selling modest quantities is Fralock in Los Angeles [(213) 873-6665]. If 
they do not have a needed material in stock both Chase-Foster [(401) 
434-2340] and DuPont [(800) 441-7515] have indicated a willingness to assist 
in development programs. Fralock has the capacity to make custom 
laminates for specialized applications.

4. TAPES AND WIRE INSULATION 
Tapes hold something in place, temporarily or permanently. An example of 
temporary usc is to hold a wire in place at the end of a layer while one's hands 
are occupied cutting a piece of layer insulation. Another example would be 
holding layer insulation in place until the next layer of wire is wound, when 
the second layer of wire holds the layer insulation beneath it in place. 
An example of permanent use is securing and providing strain relief for 
the start or finish of a winding. Another example is to provide electrical in-
sulation of a specific amount in a specific location. Tape is also used to pro-
vide mechanical strength in a particular situation. The latter example is best 
illustrated by a glass cloth tape in which the glass fibers, when embedded in a 
resin matrix, give a composite of exceptional strength. 
Tapes may be adhesive coated on one or two sides, or may have no adhe-
sive coating. The adhesives are usually thermosetting, so that when the 
fabricated unit is baked the adhesive cures and forms a permanent adhesive 
bond. 
Non-adhesive coated tapes are most commonly a fibrous mat of paper or 
synthetic material, or glass fiber cloth woven in a narrow width. The latter 
is frequently used for impregnatable interwinding insulation and outer 
wraps on toroids. 
Adhesive coated tapes may in general be classified as either film or fabric. 
Film tapes are thin, offer high dielectric strength with minimal physical 
build, and have a slick surface over which wire may slide. 
Fabric tapes will impregnate from one side and will trap air voids if wound 
overlapping. Fabric tapes are thicker than film tapes and can result in much 
higher physical strength due to their fibrous nature. 
It is important to use only electrical grade tapes. High-strength tapes are 
used for securing packages for shipping, but they are not acid-free and can 
cause long-term electrical failures. Equally obvious but common mistakes 
include using a pencil to mark the layer insulation before cutting it to length. 
The conducting graphite trace is an obvious risk to the life of the unit. Cor-
rosive materials are likewise a liability. Not all paper is acid-free, for that 
matter. Usc only materials specified for electrical applications. 
Temporary materials which will not be left in the unit when it is finished 
need not have the thermal class of the unit. They need only be sufficiently 
strong and sticky to do the job of the moment. All materials which become 
part of the unit must have at least the thermal class for which the unit is 
rated. 

188 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
Other temporary tapes need not have a thermosetting adhesive, as some-
thing else ultimately holds in place what the temporary tape held. Permanent 
usage tapes should have a thermosetting adhesive if at all possible. 
The choice between film or fabric may be made on the basis of elementary 
physical attributes. Very high temperature applications require a tape with a 
silicone adhesive. Kapton film tape coated with silicone adhesive is some-
what less convenient to use than others since the adhesive "gum balls" easily 
when the tape is cut. 
Fabric tapes such as 3M #28, an acetate cloth tape with excellent electrical 
properties and a Class 105 temperature capability are available. Others are 
3M #27, a Class 130 glass cloth tape, and Mystik #7001, a Class 180 glass 
cloth tape with silicone adhesive. 
Mystik #7367 is Kapton tape with an acrylic adhesive. It is a Class 155 
material and extremely satisfactory film tape with epoxy resin compatibility. 
Most polyester film tapes are Class 130. No adhesive bond should be ex-
pected unless the manufacturer specifically indicates the surface has been 
treated in some manner to give adhesion. 
Teflon tape with a silicone adhesive is available where a Class 180 material 
with releasing properties is required. 
For specific fire retardant requirements Kapton, glass cloth, creped 
Nom ex paper, Tedlar, and other materials are available from a variety of 
manufacturers. 
A heat bondable Kapton film is available from Fralock. Called T-183 or 
184, it has a 1 or 2 mil thick phenolic butyral adhesive applied to one or both 
sides of any standard thickness of Kapton. It is handled as a dry film, but 
when it is heated the adhesive melts, reflows, and cures, bonding the film to 
the adjacent surface. 
5. WINDING CONDUCTORS 
The most common winding conductor is round copper wire/with a coating of 
a film insulation. Copper foil or sheet may be used, slit to width and inter-
leaved with a paper, film, or composite material for interturn insulation. 
The latter is desirable where relatively high currents and/or high frequencies 
are involved, or where a better space factor is desired than that obtainable 
with magnet wire (the general term for round or square, aluminum or cop-
per, film-coated or fabric-served wire). Copper foil may not exhibit a good 
adhesive bond to epoxy impregnants. Under thermal cycling cracks will 
develop, degrading heat transfer and allowing moisture intrusion. A black 
oxide finish on the copper will enhance adhesion considerably, thereby obvi-

MATERIALS AND FABRICATION METHODS

ating this failure mechanism. Magnet wire is available in square cross section 
in sizes from 0 to 14, but is extremely difficult to wind neatly and is rarely 
necessary. Aluminum conductors are lighter than copper, but for prototype 
work they present problems in obtaining reliable terminations. I would 
recommend that square conductors or aluminum conductors be considered 
only when the design will not fly any other way. 
Of the various film insulations available, some have advantages over 
others in the same or nearby temperature classes. Where is it desired to bond 
the turns of a coil together, a butyral adhesive coating is available over both 
a polyurethane film (Class 105) and a nylon overcoated polyurethane film 
(Class 130). Both of these are solderable films, in that the film dissolves in 
hot solder. A Class 155 polyester film wire is available with or without a 
nylon overcoat. Both of these are solder able film insulations. It would be ex-
pected that the nylon overcoat would raise the moisture resistance of the base 
film. In critical applications the manufacturer should be consulted, as he 
should have the greatest familiarity with the capabilities of his own formula-
tions. The cross reference chart (Table 9-2) gives generic insulation type, ap-
plicable NEMA standards, and brand names various wire manufacturers 
assign to these products. 
6. THE USE OF CURE-IN-PLACE DIELECTRIC 
RESINS IN COIL FABRICATION 
Cure-in-place dielectric resins serve many functions in the fabrication of 
winding structures and finished transformers. They displace air voids be-
tween conductors and within layers of electrical insulation or mechanical 
conductor supports. This replacement of air with a solid medium has many 
consequences. The electric field is more homogenous, as dielectric constants 
are now closer to each other. Thermal conductivity through the coil is im-
proved, aiding heat transfer. With the outside air and its attendant moisture 
and contaminants excluded, the probability of electrical breakdown is vastly 
reduced. With adjacent turns bonded together and held in place by a highly 
adherent solid, the repulsive force between adjacent turns in high current ap-
plications will not blow the end turns out of the coil. The coil can now sur-
vive handling during assembly, and thermal cycling over its life, without 
unravelling. In many cases, the coil and core can be held firmly together for 
the life of the unit without extra mechanical assembly operations. Im-
pregnating the core and coil as a unit can provide a good mechanical bond 
and improved thermal path between coil and core.

MATERIALS AND FABRICATION METHODS

The impregnation of coil and core as a unit is contraindicated in several 
cases: 
I. The unit may be so large or heavy that it is inconvenient or impractical 
to impregnate coil and core together, in which case the coil would be im-
pregnated first, and then the core assembled onto the coil. 
2. The core may be a tape-wound nickel-iron C-core. These cores are ex-
tremely strain-sensitive, and must be carefully mounted and isolated from 
mechanical shock or strain if the maximum magnetic properties of the core 
are to be obtained and preserved. Most epoxy systems shrink on curing and 
impart too much mechanical strain to these cores. Polysulfides such as 
P RC's 120 I Q (liquid) or 1201 HT (paste) are often suitable for bonding coils 
to such cores, or for mounting them. 
3. The core may be a ferrite. Most ferrites have some degree of porosity, 
and vacuum impregnation with thermosetting resins will reduce the ferrite 
permeability. This can cause unacceptable degradation of the core magnetic 
properties. Some ferrites are available with a parylene coating. This may 
help to seal the ferrite. 
In lieu of or following impregnation, the unit may be placed in a mold or 
potting shell. (A potting shell is a thin dielectric shell to which the potting 
material adheres, the shell becoming the exterior surface of the finished 
unit.) A potting material is then introduced around the unit, surrounding it 
and filling voids between coil and core. Additional environmental protection 
and enhanced heat transfer may be obtained by judicious choice of the pot-
ting compound and the mold geometry. 
As a compromise between impregnation and molding, the unit may be 
dipped in a thixotropic resin, which results in a thick shell of resin (a con for-
mal coat) on the unit when cured. 
The electrical consequences of voids in high voltage transformers are 
severe. The presence of an air void in a winding or in the insulation between a 
winding and ground can cause corona, which will eventually lead to dielec-
tric breakdown and local conversion of the dielectric material to electrically 
conductive carbon and unsightly tars. This was discussed in the chapter on 
field gradient control (Chapter 7). 
Even with perfect impregnation, voids may be caused by the liquid im-
pregnant draining from the high points to low points during oven curing. 
Curing the coil with one end up can exacerbate this problem, as the resin not 
only drains from the top but pools at the bottom and can trap an air bubble 
in the coil margin at the bottom of the coil when it cures. When a high 

194 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
voltage coil is impregnated and then assembled onto a core there will be a gap 
between the coil ends and the inside oft he core. Corona can occur in this gap 
unless it is potted. When epoxy resins cure there is a volumetric shrinkage 
due to the change in molecular structure of the material. In some cases this 
shrinkage can cause cracks in a coil. The cracks are voids and corona can 
then start. 
All materials have a coefficient of volumetric expansion. A perfectly cured 
impregnated coil can, on cooling down from its curing temperature, develop 
cracks due to thermal shrinkage. 
Under thermal cycling some parts of a transformer may expand more or 
less than others. If the resin used can not accommodate the strains due to dif-
ferential coefficients of expansion, cracks can occur. 
Under thermal shock the outer part of a unit may expand or contract 
faster than the interior, causing mechanical failure. 
These kinds of failures can be prevented by adequate care in processing 
and the choice of suitable materials. 
Voids can also develop when the potting material does not adhere to the 
conductors or insulating materials. 
When copper or brass foil is used as an electrostatic shield and not ade-
quately degreased, voids between the foil and the impregnated coil will 
develop. The thermal conductivity of such an air gap is rather low. Several of 
these within a coil can cause the temperature rise to be far beyond design 
limits, leading to catastrophic failure. Most silicone or urethane im-
pregnating resins have little or no adhesion to magnet wire or core materials, 
and under extremes of temperature can separate from their surrounding sur-
faces as a consequence of their large coefficients of volumetric expansion. 
There are primers available for obtaining adhesion of urethane or silicone 
systems to various substrates. These primers are not suitable for impregna-
tion. For most applications, epoxy resin systems offer an adequate range of 
performance characteristics and adhesion. 
In some cases the unit may be designed to operate in pressurized gas or a 
liquid (such as oil or fluorochemical). In these cases, potting or molding is 
usually not required, and corona due to voids between coil and core is largely 
eliminated. Thermosetting tapes may be relied upon to hold the coil together 
if tests show the thermoset polymer to not be affected by the gas or liquid 
over the temperature range of concern. 
Dielectric media such as Teflon, polyethylene, or polypropylene are very 
useful in transformer design, since they have low dielectric constants, high 
dielectric strength, and are available in both block and sheet form. Virtually

nothing bonds to these materials without special treatment, so they arc not 
suitable for most epoxy-impregnated designs. 
When expecting adhesion between a resin system and a cured polymer sub-
strate, the designer may find a few rules of thumb helpful: Urethanes and 
silicones will adhere to epoxies (primers are required with some systems), but 
epoxies will not adhere to either. Some silicones can adhere to urethanes 
(primers may be required), but urethanes will not adhere to silicones. Epox-
ies bond nicely to Kapton but not to Mylar, although Mylar is commonly 
used in transformers. ln that usage one either has a noncritical commercial 
grade application or takes a (hopefully calculated) risk. 
Where it is desired that the insulation resistance between windings be ex-
tremely high, in a relatively low-voltage application, a wrap of kraft-Mylar-
kraft laminate, Kapton, or a Kapton laminate will do wonders. Epoxy-im-
pregnated kraft paper may give an l R of perhaps 108-10 10 ohms, but a single 
wrap of Mylar or Kapton embedded in the dielectric can easily raise it several 
orders of magnitude, and the difference at elevated temperatures will be even 
greater. The reason this works is that the volume resistivity of Mylar or Kap-
ton is many orders of magnitude higher than that of a thermosetting im-
pregnating resin. 
The insulation resistance of a resin-impregnated structure may be easily 
calculated if the cured impregnating resin is the controlling element. 
One would use R = ell A, where e is the volume resistivity of the cured 
resin, I is the insulating thickness, and A is the interwinding area. 
7. SECURING CONDUCTORS 
There are several commonly used methods of securing conductors. For the 
start of a winding, a piece of tape may be used, as shown in Fig. 9-1. This 
method is useful for wire sizes of less than approximately #33, or whatever 
size it is practical to wrap a piece of tape around. When the wire is large 
enough that additional strength is needed to hold down the tape securing the 
first turn, an additional piece of tape may be applied [Fig. 9-l(b)]. 
When sleeving is needed on the start (or finish, or tap) leads of the wind-
ing, strain relief for the sleeving may be effected by splitting the end of the 
sleeving and securing with a piece of tape in either of the manners shown in 
Fig. 9-2. 
The finish of a winding is best secured by placing a piece of tape down a 
few turns before the last turn of the winding, sticky side up, and using the 
last few turns to hold the tape down. After the last turn the tape is folded

coil if (rarely) needed, may be used to secure the finish tape, as shown in Fig. 
9-3. 
Taps are a little more difficult than a finish to secure but are very similar. 
The tap at the end of a layer is the simplest tap to secure. Anticipate the tap a 
few turns before the tap point and place two pieces of tape, sticky side up and 
4-10 wire diameters apart [Fig. 9-4(a)]. The first piece of tape is folded over 
the free end of the winding to secure one lead of the tap [Fig. 9-4(b)]. The 
free lead is looped out as far as needed for the length of the tap, and then re-
turned to the coil. It is secured by the remaining piece of tape folded over it. 
A piece of tape may be placed over both of the first two tape ends to hold 
them down [Fig. 9-4(c,d)]. 
A tap in the middle of a layer must be secured very much as in Fig. 9-4, but 
the additional complication of the following turns is present. The tap leads 
must not be allowed to rest on the adjacent wires but must be protected or 
cushioned, usually with a piece of tape or two, or a piece of the layer insula-
tion. If the tap is taped down and the rest of the layer wound on top of it,

then the protection (and electrical insulation!) must be placed on top of the 
tap lead. 
If the tap is held in the air until the remainder of the layer is wound and 
then laid on top of the remainder, or laid back down over the portion of the 

198 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
layer wound before the tap, then of course the cushioning is placed under the 
tap lead. Tape is used as required to hold the various items in place (Fig. 
9-5). 
It is difficult to wind further layers over the tapped layer because the coil 
has become tapered, lumpy, and irregular. Fig. 9-6(a) shows a cross section 
of Fig. 9-5. Placing some cut pieces of layer insulation opposite the tap lead 
for the remainder of the layer (a width and thickness comparable to the tap 
lead), gives the coil a symmetrical lump, no taper, and succeeding layers may 
easily be wound [Fig. 9-6(b )]. 
Taps on high current windings are sometimes needed. It may be desired to 
vary the load voltage, in which case the tap must carry the full winding cur-
rent. When the wire size is inconveniently large to pull out a tap as in Fig. 
9-5(a), this can be accomplished by stripping the wire for a short length, 
soldering on a tab of copper foil, insulating the solder joint and tab, and con-
tinuing the winding. It is often possible to put taps on the primary (which 
would have a smaller, more convenient wire size) than on the secondary of a 
step-down transformer.

When the secondary is a multifilar winding (several strands in parallel) 
and a center tap is required (the center tap carrying a relatively low current, 
such as the center tap on vacuum tube heater transformers) a tap of only one 
of the strands may be pulled out in the manner shown in Fig. 9-4 or 9-5, and 
accomplish all necessary electrical functions. 
When fine wire is wound by hand it will not always feed evenly in the 
desired direction but may jump back and wind over several previously 
wound turns before jumping forward again and continuing to wind in the 
desired direction. The causes of this are vibration and runout in the shaft of 
the winding machine or (more commonly) muscle tremors in the hands of the 
winder. This must not be allowed to happen. The machine must be backed 
up, the wire unwound and rewound properly. The reason is the same as the 
reason why insulation must be placed above or below a tap in the middle of a 
layer. When round wires lie on top of each other at an angle, they make con-
tact at a very small point. The pressure is quite high at that point and the thin 
film of insulation on the wire can be damaged, leading to a shorted turn and 
failure of the transformer or inductor. 
In high voltage transformers the layer insulation serves several functions. 
One is to cushion the wires against mechanical damage of the film insulation. 
Another is to provide a wick of controlled thickness into which an impreg-
nant may be introduced. The third function is mechanical support of the 
winding during the fabrication process. The thickness, stiffness, and poros-
ity of the layer insulation must all be considered in the selection of layer in-
sulating media. It may be necessary to specify a composite (kraft paper 
laminated to Kapton, or whatever) to obtain a desired combination of 
physical and electrical properties. 
8. WINDING MACHINES 
Coils for transformers or inductors may be wound in a variety of manners. 
For something small with many turns, especially when one does not need to 
count the exact number of turns as they are wound, a bench-mount hand-
cranked grinder may be used. These devices have a simple gear arrangement 
that speeds up the shaft rotation by 10 or 20 to 1 over the turning speed of the 
hand crank. One hand turns the crank, while the other hand feeds the wire 
onto a bobbin affixed to the shaft in place of the grinding wheel. This is ex-
tremely crude, but simple, and I have seen circumstancs where it was expe-
dient. 
A step up from this arrangement is to C-clamp a variable speed electric 
drill to a table, operate the trigger control with one hand and feed the wire 

200 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
Fig. 9-7. 
with the other. A simple turns counter may be arranged by gluing a small 
magnet to the side of the chuck and using a reed relay capsule (mounted on 
the bench, suitably near the magnet) to couple signals into an electronic im-
pulse counter. 
Commercial winding machines are readily available for as little as a few 
hundred dollars. They consist of a headstock shaft supported by bearings for 
minimal shaft rotation eccentricity, a variable speed motor drive, a foot 
operated speed control (leaving both hands free for winding), and a 
mechanical or electromechanical counter. High torque, low speed versions 
are available for winding heavy wire or foil. Semi-automatic winding 
machines which feed the wire at controlled turn-to-turn spacing are available 
as one's budget moves upward from hundreds to thousands of dollars. 
Winding a toroid of few turns may most expediently be accomplished by 
holding the toroid between the thumb and one or more fingers of one hand 
and passing a calculated length of wire through the hole and around the cross 
section of the core. Each succeeding turn is held down with the thumb as the 
winding proceeds around the core. If needed, a piece of tape may be used to 
secure the start to the outer periphery of the core (Fig. 9-7). 
Succeeding turns of wire hold down the right side of the piece of tape. If 
the layer is 360Â° the last turns hold down the left side. The finish may be 
secured as the finish of a layer-wound coil. A piece of tape may be wrapped 
around 360Â° of the outer periphery of the core to further secure the flying 
leads. On very small toroids no tape may be needed, the wires staying in 
place by themselves adequately for further processing such as an epoxy dip 
and cure. 
9. MAKING A MANDREL FOR A COIL OR BOBBIN 
Most winding machines will be configured so that the headstock (drive shaft) 
is terminated in a three-jaw chuck, typically of Yz in. capacity. Simply sketch 

MATERIALS AND FABRICATION METHODS 
201 
a Y2 in. diameter aluminum cylinder, an inch or so long, with a square or rec-
tangular shape extending from one end and coaxial with the cylindrical part. 
A local machine shop can then machine the square section from that part of 
a round shaft. For larger winding forms (over Y2 -l in. square) it is more con-
venient to machine a shaft and have the machine shop press a rectangular 
block (the winding form with a precisely bored hole through the center) onto 
the shaft. The hole should be true to the rectangular winding form to such an 
extent that the wire may be wound at the maximum coil diameter with wob-
ble or runout of less than one-half wire diameter. 
In some instances the shaft may be a threaded rod, with a set of coil man-
drels, all of which have clearance holes. The blocks are held to the threaded 
shaft with nuts and washers. This is not suitable for heavy wire (too much 
torque) or very fine wire (mandrel will not be coaxial with the chuck of the 
winding machine). 
In some cases it will be necessary to make a tube or winding form for the 
coil. With a mandrel machined to fit, a layer of nonadhesive plastic film 
(Mylar, Teflon, or polyethylene, 1 mil thick) may be wrapped and sprayed 
with dry film mold release, and a narrow strip of glass fiber cloth wound on 
the mandrel. This structure is then heated, saturated with epoxy resin, and 
cured, and then the mandrel is carefully driven out. The finished winding 
form is then trimmed to length and the exterior surfaces sanded. A coil may 
then be wound. This approach is time consuming and is only recommended 
where time does not permit an outside fabricator to make a length of rec-
tangular epoxy fiberglass tubing to order. I have used Darco Electronics of 
Paramount, California for almost 20 years and found them to be an excel-
lent supplier of such custom tubes. 
Pot cores have bobbins available to match the pot core sizes. They must be 
supported on both ends or the coil flanges will bulge out from wire pressure 
during winding and the finished coil will not fit the core. A mandrel design 
such as that shown in Fig. 9-8 has been found adequate. 
When the bobbin is assembled on such a mandrel, it is held by compres-
sion and the end flanges adequately supported. The washers may be notched 
to match the bobbin flange notches. A similar design may be used for square 
nylon bobbins. 
10. HOW TO WIND A BOBBIN 
When the bobbin has holes in the side flange simply pass the start through 
the hole, bend it at a right angle once inside the flange, secure it with tape as 
needed, and proceed to wind. In some cases it may be necessary or desirable

to secure the wire so that adequate initial winding tension may be applied 
(Fig. 9-9). 
When the bobbin has no side holes or it is not desirable to use them, the 
start (or tap or finish) must be secured to the winding surface (or portion of 
the coil already wound) and then laid over to a flange, run up the flange and 
over. Tape or insulating material must usually be used to protect the exiting 
lead from the abrasion of succeeding turns being wound and whatever 
potential differences may be present.

11. HOW TO WIND A COIL WITHOUT A BOBBIN 
Bobbins are usually used to support the turns of a winding which may not 
have layer insulation to support the layers of wire. They are also used where 
the greatest space utilization factor is desired and the film insulation on the 
magnet wire is adequate electrical insulation for the potential developed by 
two layers of winding. 
If the coil is to be layer wound with insulating support sheet between 
layers, or is to be a single layer, epoxy-glass fiber or kraft paper tubing may 
be used. Kapton, Nomex, and a wide variety of materials are available in 
tube form from various specialty manufacturers. 
If no space is available for a winding form or no winding form is desired, 
an aluminum mandrel can be machined to the desired coil diameter, etc. (Be 
sure to radius the corners on square or rectangular mandrels!) After mold re-
lease, the wire is wound on the form while liquid epoxy resin is fed onto the 
coil (wet winding). The wound coil is then placed in an oven for curing. 
As a highly desirable alternative to wet winding, bondable magnet wire 
can be wound on a mold-released mandrel and the wires bonded together by 
passing a current through the wound coil for sufficient time to cause the 
bondable layer to melt. On cooling the coil stays together as a unit, and may 
be wrapped with glass fiber cloth tape and vacuum impregnated with epoxy 
resin if desired. 
12. HOW TO WIND A LAYER-WOUND COIL 
Layer-wound coils are specified to avoid placing turns of succeeding layers 
directly against each other. This may be for electrical reasons, to ensure that 
the placement of turns is regular, to wind a coil of several layers such that the 
layers are of equal length and the end turns do not fall off the coil during or 
after winding, or where multiple coils are being wound on a production 
multiple winder. Where interlayer insulation is important in a bobbin-sup-
ported coil, layer insulation may also be used. 
To wind a layer-wound coil, choose a winding form (round, square, or 
rectangular tubing as required, cut to length) from a material and shape 
which is available, appropriately easy to fabricate, and has the desired elec-
trical and mechanical properties. Spiral wound kraft paper tubing is often 
used, as is the more expensive glass-epoxy tubing. Molded bobbins of epoxy, 
diallyl phthalate, or Nylon are available, although the latter usually require a 
winding form with end plates to support the flexible Nylon bobbin flanges. 
Choose a layer insulation based on the degree of mechanical support re-

204 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
qui red, its thermal class, its electrical properties after impregnation, the ease 
of impregnation, the ability of the impregnant or encapsulant to form an ad-
hesive bond with the layer insulation, and the ability of the layer insulation 
surface to hold the turns in place so they do not slide around during winding 
and handling, as well as availability and cost. In some cases a laminate or 
composite material may be required. Select the tape or tapes to be used to 
hold things together while winding the coil. Some of the more commonly 
used tapes are paper, Mylar, and glass cloth, or Kapton with a thermosetting 
adhesive. 
Begin by securing the start of the winding as previously discussed. Then 
rotate the mandrel while guiding the wire onto it so that adjacent turns end 
up next to each other with very little space between them, but so that suc-
ceeding turns do not pile up on top of previous turns. The wire being wound 
meets the mandrel at an angle slightly less than 90Â°, lagging the advance of 
the winding by about 0-10Â°. With fine wire the angle may be only a few 
degrees off perpendicular. Much practice will be necessary to develop the 
fine touch necessary to hand-wind neat coils with wire sizes in the range of 
30-38 A WG. The first few layers on square or rectangular coils are more dif-
ficult to wind than succeeding layers because of the sharp corners. Coils with 
large aspect ratio (cross-section dimensional ratio over 3 : I) are more diffi-
cult to wind than nearly square coils. The beginner might practice by winding 
I 8 A WG wire on a 2 in. diameter round form. This is easy. Then try a I Yz in. 
square form, then a % x 2Y4 in. form, then wind #28 AWG on a I in. 
diameter round form and a Yz in. square form. Machines with automatic 
wire traverse feed, while expensive, are well worth the price when many coils 
of hundreds of turns of 24 A WG or finer wire must be wound. 
When the prescribed number of turns of the first layer has been wound, 
you are ready to put in the sheet layer insulation. Place a piece of tape on the 
coil covering the last few turns. This may often be only a temporary item to 
hold the winding in place and free the operator's hands. Then cut a piece of 
layer insulation (precut in strips of the proper width) to the required length. 
Wrap the strip around the coil in the winding direction. Allow a bit for over-
lap and cut with scissors. That gives the correct length. Then take a piece of 
tape (width Y4-I in. or so as appropriate-start with about one-fourth the 
layer insulation width and change if needed to what suits the particular job 
best)-and stick it to the layer insulation as shown in Fig. 9-IO(a). Then 
place it on the coil, slipping the wire between tape and layer insulation [Fig. 
9-1 O(b )]. Press the tape entirely down. Wrap the layer insulation around the 
coil, maintaining a moderate tension (practice will teach you the proper 
amount). Place a second piece of tape across the lap, parallel to the coil axis

(perpendicular tape placement can build up lumps and allow the layer insula-
tion to twist and swim in the winding direction, leading to skewed coils, off-
set wraps of layer insulation, and a sloppy product). After final tape place-
ment the coil is ready for another layer to be wound. It will look like Fig. 
9-IO(c). Then wind another layer. Taps and finishes are handled as previ-
ously described. 
When a layer-wound coil is wound in a bobbin and the layer insulation 
width exactly matches the inside bobbin width (or perhaps one-fourth wire 
diameter less), the layers may be wound from one bobbin wall to the other 
and a reasonably neat product obtained. 
Layer-wound coils per se cannot have the winding extending the full width 
of the layer insulation. Some margin is usually needed for electrical reasons, 
and the first and last turns of such a coil would tend to fall off unless an inor-
dinate amount of tape were used. The wire must be spaced somewhat in from 
the edges of the layer insulation. This spacing is usually symmetrical. The 

206 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
distance from the edge of the layer insulation to the nearest conductor of the 
winding is called the margin. High voltage considerations may dictate a 
greater margin than mechanical considerations. For example, a margin of 
Y,- \/.! in. is adequate for mechanical support of 10-12 A WG wire with 0.015 
in. Copaco cuffed layer insulation. A margin of Y. in. is adequate for 16-20 
A WG with 0.010 in. Copaco or Nomex 410. A margin of 0.08 in. is adequate 
for 28-32 A WG with 0.010 Nomex 411. Stiffer materials or cuffed materials 
may only need two wire diameters of margin width for mechanical support, 
while softer or more flexible materials may need five to ten wire diameters. 
When bringing out self-leads from layer-wound coils it may be necessary 
or desirable to add an insulating sleeving over the lead. A number of sleev-
ings serve well for this purpose. For lower temperature applications (Class 
105 or 130) vinyl-glass sleeving is available from most magnet wire and insu-
lation suppliers. For Class 155 or higher braided fiberglass sleeving is 
necessary. All of these materials will become stiff when the impregnant 
soaks into the sleeving. This may be good electrically but does not leave a 
flexible lead. It may be necessary for this sleeving to be cut short, and an 
unimpregnated length of sleeving slipped over it and bonded to it after im-
pregnation (a dab of epoxy will usually suffice) to obtain a flexible insulated 
self lead. 
Flying leads of insulated stranded wire are often specified by systems 
designers. These must be anchored mechanically inside the coil so no tensile 
stress is transmitted to the solder joint or the wire of the winding. The lead 
and its solder joint must also have adequate electrical insulation to whatever 
is in its vicinity. 
It is convenient in many cases to bring the leads of the winding out to a ter-
minal block, solder pins or some such, and let the user bring his wires to the 
transformer. Many bobbins have molded-in pins or lugs for just this pur-
pose. 
13. FOIL-WOUND COILS 
High frequency or space factor considerations may make it advisable to use 
copper foil as the winding conductor. It is important that the sheet, once slit 
to width, have a minimal burr and be free of oil. A supplier of custom widths 
of copper foil is Thinsheet [(203) 756-7414). In large quantities copper sheet 
mills can actually provide foil rolled out in such a manner that the edge not 
only has no burr but is radiused or chamfered. If this is critical (hundreds or 
thousands of volts per turn) the engineer may have to sand the edges of an 

MATERIALS AND FABRICATION METHODS 
207 
unrolled length of foil by hand and then solvent wipe to remove metallic dust 
before winding. 
Starts, finishes and taps are usually accomplished by soldering a narrower 
strip of thicker sheet perpendicular to the foil to be wound. The foil and a 
strip of wider layer insulation are then wound two-in-hand (either manually 
fed or positioned by a fixture built in-house) onto the winding form. 
It is important that the materials be fed perpendicular to the winding 
form, that the foil be kept centered on the layer insulation in order to pre-
serve electrical design specifications, and that adequate winding tension be 
maintained. 
If the materials are not held perpendicular the winding will be conical. If 
the foil is not centered it may creep out from under the insulation and turn-
to-turn shorts can result. If inadequate tension is maintained the winding 
build can be excessive, the turns can slide around, and the inside can literally 
drop out of the coil. 
14. ASSEMBLING CORE AND COIL 
It is of the utmost importance that cleanliness be maintained when a split 
core is assembled onto a prefabricated coil. Whether the core material is tape 
wound, or a ferrite or powdered iron core, it is important that no dust, 
flakes, or shreds of insulation from the coil or whatever be allowed to end up 
between the core faces. A "gapless" design is not obtainable when a flake of 
epoxy or a shred of paper a few mils thick is trapped between the core faces. 
A carefully measured thickness of gap material for an inductor will not yield 
the correct inductance when extraneous materials add an unpredictable 
amount. Crud in the gap will also cause acoustic noise in units with AC ex-
citation. 
Tape-wound cores may be assumed to have an oil film on them when re-
ceived. They must be degreased before adhesive bonding the core faces 
together or an adhesive bond will not be obtained. Ferrite or powdered iron 
cores have a residual "dust" on the core faces from the grinding process. 
They must be ultrasonically cleaned immediately before adhesive bonding. 
If this is done it is possible to obtain a bond strength exceeding that of the 
material itself. If this is not done it is impossible to obtain consistent high-
strength bonds. An epoxy adhesive that has been found very useful for bond-
ing cores is Armstrong C-7 /W mixed 1 : 1 by weight and cured two hours at 
160Â° F. Another is Hysol EA-956. 
Tape-wound cores may be fastened together by banding. Tinned steel 

208 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
bands and solder seals are available from Electrical Specialty Products, 
Sharon, Pennsylvania; Westinghouse Electric Corp., Greenville, Penn-
sylvania; Gerrand and Co., Des Plaines, Illinois; or their distributors. 
Crimped or soldered steel bands are useful when time for adhesive bonding is 
not available, where it is desired to band the core halves together and 
simultaneously attach them to a mounting foot, or wh.ere other considera-
tions make this desirable. 
Adhesive bonding is an excellent method of core assembly. So is banding. 
I have assembled many thousands of transformers by each method. Each has 
its pros and cons. When adhesive bonding is used the cores must be either 
clamped together or held together by a current passed through a winding (the 
latter method was suggested to me by Dick Wood of National Magnetics). 
Ferrite cores are not usually banded because the sharp outer corners interfere 
with proper tensioning, and also because of the high frequency loss of the 
steel band. Gapped structures may have their properties altered somewhat 
because the steel band shunts the gap. Being brittle, they can easily be 
chipped or broken during banding. 
A mechanical clamping arrangement can be contrived wherein end plates 
are bolted to each other, compressing the core halves between them. This 
method is not often used because of the cost of the hardware and the propen-
sity for acoustic noise. It occasionally can be implemented in a cost-effective 
manner and has its place. 
When assembling a core around a coil, insulation is occasionally required 
between the core and coil. If impregnation or potting is to follow, a piece of 
insulating paper or laminate can be inserted in the margin (the space between 
coil and core in the G dimension) to give some minimum thickness of insula-
tion after processing. 
15. HOW TO WIND A TOROID 
In many cases a toroidal core is to be wound with a modest number of turns 
(say, less than 100) of a wire size which is convenient for hand winding. If the 
length of wire to be wound is a few feet or less a shuttle may not be necessary. 
For greater lengths it is convenient to use a shuttle to carry the wire through 
the hole. A simple shuttle may be made by cutting a piece of;-;. in. G-10 or 
Plexiglass to a handy length, say 4-8 in., and a width narrow enough that it 
can easily be passed through the hole of the toroid (when it is fully wound 
and the diameter of the hole is reduced from that of the bare core). Sand off 
all sharp corners so that wire insulation will not be abraded away from 
repeated passage of the shuttle through the hole. Plexiglass or birch (tongue 

MATERIALS AND FABRICATION METHODS 
209 
depressors) are preferred materials in this respect, while G-10 has greater 
strength. Then cut a rectangular notch in each end of the shuttle. The width 
and depth of the notch must give sufficient area to contain the number of 
turns that will be wrapped on the shuttle to provide the winding length. File a 
smooth radius on all sides of the notches. A small hole near one end is often 
helpful in securing the start of the wire to the shuttle. 
One way or another, we now have core and wire and are ready to wind. 
First, make sure that the core has adequate insulation. Some ferrite cores, 
for instance, have sharp corners and can easily cut through the insulation on 
the wire. Next, take a length of tape somewhat more than the circumference 
of the core for small cores, or enough to cover a 120Â° segment oft he 0 D for 
larger cores (once you get the hang of this you can use any amount of tape 
any way you find it expedient). Tape the winding start against the OD, 
roughly centered on the tape (Fig. 9-11). 
Then, assuming you (the winder) are right-handed, place the left thumb 
over the start and the left forefinger on the opposite side of the core. Other 
fingers may be used as convenient. With the right hand feed the wire up 
through the hole, pull toward yourself, roll the core slightly between the 
thumb and forefinger to expose the last turn wound, and pull the wire 
toward yourself and down. Roll the core back slightly so the left thumb holds 
the turn last wound in place. The right hand is now free to fiddle with the 
wire, apply tape, manipulate a coffee cup, or wind another turn. 
If the winding docs not cover 360Â° the last turn may be secured with a 
patch of tape, a full 360Â° wrap around the OD, or occasionally a wrap over 
the last turn, wound just as the winding turns were. If the winding happens 
to cover 360Â° it is possible to do without any more tape by threading the last 
turn under the tape holding the first turn in place. If the wire is sufficiently 
stiff tape may not he needed at all.

MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
There is a danger here for designs which require thorough impregnation in 
order to meet electrical, thermal, or other requirements. Most tapes do not 
impregnate. The layers of adhesive-coated film or fabric may have excellent 
high voltage test properties, but air voids will be entrapped within the tape 
laps, preventing impregnant from flowing through to the winding beneath. 
A glass cloth is available, woven in various widths and thicknesses. The 
range includes% in. wide x 0.003 in. thick and \12 in. wide x 0.015 in. thick. 
It impregnates very nicely. 
When it is necessary to machine-wind a toroid, either because there are too 
many turns of wire, especially fine wire, and/or so many units to be done 
that machine winding offers an economy, different toroidal winders can be 
evaluated to decide where the best options lie. 
16. IMPREGNATION AND POTTING 
Impregnation means soaking the unit thoroughly with something that dis-
places all the air inside the fabricated structure. Either simple soaking or 
vacuum-assisted impregnation qualifies, although vacuum impregnation of-
fers far superior results. Potting generally means to cast the unit into a block 
of cured resin, whether the finished unit is surrounded by a metal can, a pot-
ting shell, or has an "as molded" surface. Again, the potting resin can be 
poured and allowed to cure, or vacuum may be used to aid the escape of 
trapped air. 
The way vacuum impregnation aids the escape of trapped air is this: As the 
atmospheric pressure surrounding a part immersed in liquid is reduced, the 
air bubbles trapped inside the part expand. As they expand, the buoyant 
force on them is greater because they are displacing a greater volume of the 
heavier liquid. The bubbles tend to rise, leaving behind smaller bubbles of 
low-pressure air. When atmospheric pressure is restored the bubble con-
tracts to a volume which leaves the remaining air at atmospheric pressure, 
and the bubble is of course much smaller. Assuming a good vacuum pump, 
the pressure on an immersed part will eventually get down to a point where 
the liquid is foaming or bubbling violently. It is necessary to have some extra 
container height to contain this foaming. At this pressure we either have a lot 
of air trapped in layers of paper or mat and fine wire, or the resins themselves 
are boiling. It is not unusual for one of the components of an impregnating 
or potting compound to boil at the process temperature and a pressure in the 
range of 5 mm Hg or less. 
On the one hand this is bad because we are losing one of the components 
of the resin system and it will end up contaminating the vacuum pump and 

MATERIALS AND FABRICATION METHODS 
211 
all the vacuum plumbing. On the other hand, when the resins boil the air in 
those trapped voids is being displaced with a condensible vapor. When atmo-
spheric pressure is reestablished the vapor condenses, the liquid moves into 
the void space, and we have perfect impregnation with no void whatsoever. 
This sounds nice but in real life it does not happen. 
When a part is immersed in a liquid, the liquid itself exerts a pressure on 
the part, depending on how much liquid is above the part. If we have a 13 
mm depth of immersion, the liquid adds a pressure of 13 mm of whatever it 
is. For most epoxy resins, that is about 1 mm of mercury for a depth of only 
Vz in. As atmospheric pressure around the immersed part is reduced, the 
resin will boil on the surface but not down deep inside the part and its voids, 
because down deep the pressure is several mm Hg higher. If one observes a 
part immersed in a resin system in a vacuum chamber, bubbles can occa-
sionally be seen coming to the surface from beneath. After a while bubbles 
begin to form and break on the surface. The latter type of "boiling" is char-
acteristic of boiling resin. 
One common method of displacing the air within a coil is by simply dip-
ping or soaking the finished structure in a liquid resin or varnish and then (at 
room or elevated temperature) allowing the resin in the "saturated" coil to 
harden. This procedure usually provides a gross mechanical bond. With 
relatively large wire sizes (# 10-20) it does a fair job of soaking through the 
coil to the inside. Many voids will, however, remain in the coil after such 
processing. Vacuum impregnation is far superior. In this process the coil or 
transformer is immersed in the liquid resin, the container is placed in a 
vacuum chamber, and a vacuum pump is used to reduce the pressure to 
0.1-10 mm Hg. The vacuum chamber may be a vacuum oven if it is necessary 
to heat the resin during impregnation to reduce its viscosity. 
When the pressure is reduced beyond some point most resins will boil, es-
pecially when heated. This sets a lower limit on the vacuum to which the unit 
may be subjected and a consequent lower limit on the extent to which air may 
be removed from the coil. A small amount of air may remain in the coil, and 
when atmospheric pressure is restored to the immersed coil small but finite 
air bubbles (voids) may remain. A mitigating factor is that if the pressure is 
reduced to the boiling point of the resin, some of the residual air becomes 
displaced with resin vapor which then condenses upon return to atmospheric 
pressure. 
In order to obtain very good impregnation the part is placed in a container 
in a vacuum chamber. The pressure is reduced to less than Vz mm Hg and 
held there for a period of time (until the part finishes outgassing), then liquid 
resin is introduced into the vacuum chamber until the part is totally im-

212 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
mersed. The chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure, and the part 
allowed to soak long enough for the resin to flow into all the interstices (a 
few minutes for small parts, perhaps 15-30 minutes for a 6-8 in. coil with 
many layers of paper and fine wire). It is then placed on a tray for draining 
and curing. 
A variation on this process achieves a more thorough impregnation. One 
method is to place the coil or unit in a vacuum chamber, evacuate to 0.1 mm 
Hg, and then introduce the liquid resin into that chamber from a separate 
chamber. The coil ends up being totally immersed in the liquid. The chamber 
is then brought to atmospheric pressure. After this procedure, the unit (in a 
conformal mold or potting shell) is then placed in a pressure vessel and pres-
surized to 100 psi or more for sufficient time and temperature to cure the 
resin. Curing under pressure aids and speeds the flow of liquid resin into the 
coil, reduces the size of the residual air voids to a minute level, and with suf-
ficient pressure the residual gas will dissolve in the liquid resin, the void thus 
vanishing. 
The overall impregnation and/or potting process begins with a dry coil 
which has been wound and may have been assembled onto a core. The first 
step is to bake it in a forced air circulating oven. Material thermal limitations 
permitting, 24 hr at 250Â°F (120Â°C) is recommended. This baking process 
serves two functions: It cures the adhesive on thermoset tapes; it also drives 
out the residual moisture inside the coil and can volatilize the oil film present 
on magnet wire. 
There are epoxy systems, both rigid and semiflexible, which cure at room 
temperature. For best impregnation only unfilled systems should be used. 
Some of these have less shrinkage on curing, and of course there is no 
shrinkage on cooling down from an elevated temperature cure because there 
is no elevated temperature. Less shrinkage puts less stress on strain-sensitive 
core materials. 
Other epoxy systems, either rigid or semiflexible, require an elevated 
temperature cure. They offer the advantage of lower impregnating viscosity 
and longer working time (pot life) so that the same batch of resin may be 
used to impregnate successive batches of coils. 
After curing the unit is ready for the next processing step, whatever that 
may be. 
Some designs require a corona threshold test which production units, im-
pregnated and cured according to the resin manufacturer's curing specifica-
tions, may have difficulty passing. The corona threshold may be raised by 
subjecting a unit to post-curing, an extended baking procedure, after the 
manufacturer's specified curing schedule is completed. For example, 3M 

MATERIALS AND FABRICATION METHODS 
213 
#280 epoxy is supposed to cure in 2 hr at 250Â°F. In one instance units so 
cured were found to have a corona threshold in the 6-9 kV range. There-
quirement was 10 kV. Post-curing in a forced air circulating oven for 24 hr at 
250Â°F raised the corona threshold about 2 kV for all units. Post-curing for 
seven days (168 hr) at 250Â°F raised the corona threshold on all units to the 
12-13 kV range. There is nothing inadequate about 3M #280. It was chosen 
for its excellent electrical properties. The effect of post-curing on corona 
threshold is common in varying degrees to all polymer systems. 
Post-curing works because the chemically reactive groups on the compo-
nent molecules combine during the curing reaction to form larger molecules 
and complex polymer matrices. The remaining reactive groups become pro-
gressively more hindered in their movements and not all the reactive groups 
are able to find each other and react. The manufacturer's specified curing 
time may be enough for, say, 99f1Jo of the reactive groups to react, but the 
corona threshold can be severely degraded by even a minute amount of un-
cured ingredients. Prolonged heating during post-curing can give sufficient 
time for virtually a11 the reactive groups to react, thus giving results which 
can approach the ultimate available from that resin system. 
17. ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS AND CONSEQUENCES 
MIL-T -27 may be specified for a component, or the application may be a 
commercial or industrial grade unit which is expected to last the life of the 
equipment in which it is installed. 
The unit may also end up being built by the lowest bidder, who will pro-
vide the minimum quality level necessary to pass incoming inspection. Even 
industrial or commercial grade units will be exposed to other environmental 
factors than a 55Â°C ambient and one thermal cycle per day. 
The air within 50 miles or so of the ocean will contain a significant amount 
of salt crystals as fine as dust. These will find their way into the innards of 
most electronic instruments. The humidity may approach 10011/o, and con-
densation may occur on cold surfaces. Fingerprints leave a residue of oil and 
salt. High voltages gather the dust from the air, some of which adheres to in-
sulating surfaces around high potential regions. Moisture will slowly 
permeate dielectric resins. Microscopic traces of salt and moisture will form 
conducting paths from pinholes in the insulation to anywhere, and it may 
seem that the physical universe as a whole is conspiring to cause that compo-
nent to fail. It is. 
We can do a great deal to prolong component life. We can eliminate weak 
points, and make it very difficult for pinholes to exist or moisture to degrade 

214 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
the insulation. Manufacturers of resins and insulating sheets and films usu-
ally have life expectancy data on their products. It is not unreasonable to ex-
pect magnetic components to have a 10,000 hour life. Knowing the degrada-
tion rate of dielectrics versus temperature, one could design components for 
a 100,000 hour life with a fair degree of confidence. It remains to construct 
the unit adequately to withstand the environment. 
MIL-T -27 specifies three grades of transformers and specifies certain 
tests for these grades (Table 9-3). 
The methodology of these tests is given in MIL-STD-202 as referenced by 
MIL-T -27. Electrical testing in conjunction with accelerated environmental 
stress is designed to assure that the unit is capable of a 10,000 hour life expec-
tancy (about 14 months of continuous operation). Any commercial unit 
worth its salt should have several times this life expectancy, and most do. 
Moisture and abrasion resistance of the magnet wire is crucial in achieving 
a long life in open-type transformers, which may be merely bobbin wound 
and then dipped in varnish. Moisture resistance under electrical stress is im-
portant because such units have no seal against ambient air and the internal 
humidity will be the external humidity. Abrasion resistance is important 
because the winding process unavoidably abrades the wire as it passes over 
other strands on the spool, the edge of the spool, pulleys, wire guides, bob-
bin walls, etc. Using more abrasion-resistant magnet wire insulations and 
giving careful attention to winding procedures and machine design can 
minimize abrasion. An impregnation with varnish or epoxy is much more 
beneficial than dipping in obtaining a long life from open type units. 
Encapsulation for commercial or industrial units should be considered for

operating voltages higher than -500-1000 volts. This includes not only 
molded or potted units but those processed by immersing the impregnated 
and cured unit in a thixotropic resin system (usually an epoxy), subjecting 
the unit to a vacuum, then removing and curing. The process puts a thick 
conformal resin coating over the unit. It is very advantageous for trans-
formers with tape-wound C-cores or stamped lamination cores that have 
high operating voltages, as it assures an essentially void-free unit even in the 
margins where the thin impregnating resins drain out. 
Metal-encased, hermetically sealed units are desirable or mandatory in 
many circumstances. For liquid or gas filled units a hermetic seal is obviously 
necessary. The steel case can afford magnetic shielding, either to protect 
neighboring circuitry from the transformer or inductor, or to reduce stray 
field pickup by the shielded component. Metal-encased hermetically sealed 
units offer the best protection against moisture, contamination, reduced at-
mospheric pressure, and other undesirable environmental influences. 
All other things being equal, metal-encased hermetically sealed units are 
the most expensive to manufacture. Molded encapsulated units are usually 
less expensive to produce. Small units potted in potting shells are even less 
expensive, as are conformally coated units. The cost difference between the 
latter three depends on the particular circumstance. The high volume, small 
units may be very economically encapsulated by transfer molding. The tool-
ing for this can be quite expensive. Small units in moderate volume may be 
most economically potted in a potting shell, while it is often more convenient 
to conformally coat larger units (over perhaps a few cubic inches) than to 
mold or pot them. Heat transfer requirements may not permit the high ther-
mal resistance of a potting shell but require a high thermal conductivity 
epoxy as the external surface. 
When cost is a significant factor and the unit will not be build in-house, 
the unit should be properly specified and quotes obtained from magnetic 
component manufacturers. Life expectancy is a crucial and often invisible 
part of the unit cost. If a system has components with a definite life expec-
tancy (such as a flash lamp) then the associated magnetic components (such 
as the trigger transformer) should be specified for that same life expectancy. 
Competing designs should be evaluated side by side in a full life test if at all 
possible. 
18. MOUNTING 
The military specification MIL-T -27 indicates standard sizes of drawn 
metal cans. While the sizes may look a bit odd, it turns out that they were 

216 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
chosen for a comfortable fit around standard sizes of E-1 laminations in 
square stacks. In the packaging of magnetic components one is not necessar-
ily restricted to those can sizes. If a metal can with threaded studs or inserts is 
required it is not difficult to have custom cans made to enclose any shape. 
Steel cans afford electrostatic and a fair degree of magnetic shielding and are 
often desirable or mandatory in industrial and military equipment. 
If for some reason a steel can is not desired or feasible, but an enclosed or 
potted unit with outer dimensions as close as possible to the actual compo-
nent is needed, the component may be potted in a potting shell (if small) or 
molded into a block with the appropriate molds or tooling. Mounting may 
be by molded-in threaded studs, threaded inserts, or molded or drilled 
through-holes. 
If the unit is fairly small, whether molded or not, adhesive bonding pro-
vides a convenient and entirely adequate mounting means. Adhesives such as 
silicone or polysulfide would usually be preferred, as they are flexible and 
can readily accommodate local stress. 
In commercial equipment small magnetic components such as toroids may 
be easily mounted on a printed circuit board with a nylon cable tie or two 
around the part and through a couple of holes in the board. Toroids may 
also be mounted with a screw through the middle, holding a fiber washer or 
some such against the top of the toroid and compressing it against the 
mounting surface. 
Most sizes of pot cores have metal clips for mounting. Pot cores may also 
be mounted with a screw through the middle (Nylon screws would be pre-
ferred, especially if the pot core is gapped) or by adhesive bonding. Smaller 
pot cores may be mounted with printed-circuit-mount bobbins, as these have 
molded-in pins to which the windings are terminated. The bobbin pins are 
then soldered to the PC board. The core is secured to the bobbin either by 
standard pot core hardware or by adhesive bonding the pot core halves 
together. 
Stamped and formed mounting brackets such as those offered by Hall-
mark Metals can be used to mount tape-wound cut cores (C-cores). The 
C-core may be secured to the bracket by banding or, for small units, adhesive 
bonding. If shock and vibration requirements permit, the core halves may be 
adhesive bonded to each other with an epoxy adhesive and the core then 
bonded (usually with a polysulfide) to a plain flat plate with mounting holes. 
Larger C-core units may be mounted by two lengths of metal angle stock, 
held against the core by bolts between the angles. The bolt spacing is slightly 
more than the coil length, so that the bolts lie within the lower corner spaces 
of the core. Mounting holes in the metal angles secure the unit to the mount-

MATERIALS AND FABRICATION METHODS 
217 
ing surfaces. Insulating sheet materials must be inserted between the sides of 
the angle brackets and the edges of the core laminations, or a partial, shorted 
turn can result from the mechanical pressure of the metal angles against the 
lamination edges. 
E-I laminations have been in use for a very long time and are an extremely 
economical means of obtaining a magnetic structure. It is therefore not sur-
prising to find many ways to mount standard size laminations. 
Stamped metal shells called end bells have bent-over sheet metal ears for 
fastening the unit to the chassis. The end bells are bolted to the lamination 
stack on each end, covering the coil structure. Holes are provided for flying 
leads to exit the end bell. L-shaped angle brackets are available for mounting 
stacks of laminations-the angle is bolted to the stack of laminations and the 
foot of the Lis bolted to the mounting surface. 
When bolts are passed through the punched holes in stacks of laminations, 
it is important to ensure that at least one end of the bolt is electrically isolated 
from that side of the stack. A shorted turn can result if the mounting hard-
ware makes electrical contact across all or a part of the lamination stack. 
Printed circuit bobbins are available for the smaller size laminations. 
Their strength is adequate only for commercial applications. Even so, it may 
be necessary to use adhesive bonding or mechanical means to secure the core 
to the PC board and to attach the PC board to the chassis at that place. 
Stamped and formed metal brackets called channel frames are available to 
fit a wide range of lamination sizes. A channel frame is a sheet steel channel 
bent in two places such that it wraps around three of the four sides of a 
lamination stack. Sheet metal ears fold over and retain the lamination stack 
within the channel frame. Ears (or tabs on smaller sizes) are the mounting 
means. 
19. STRESS-FREE PROCESSING 
Special processing to minimize or isolate mechanical stress or coupling may 
be necessary for a variety of reasons. Ferrite cores should not be im-
pregnated with anything which develops a curing stress, as it reduces the 
permeability. Even varnish or epoxy dipping and curing can noticeably 
degrade the permeability. When such processing is necessary, cores with an 
impermeable coating applied by the manufacturer should be used. As an 
alternative the impregnating and potting compounds should be restricted to 
silicone elastomers or a low shrinkage urethane such as 3M #221. Strain-
sensitive nickel alloy cores or lamination stacks are easily degraded by im-
pregnation with the so-called semi flexible epoxy systems. No impregnation, 

218 
MAGNETIC COMPONENTS 
potting with 3M #221, or a silicone elastomer is recommended. Mounting 
such cores on a mounting bracket or plate with polysulfide rubber can pro-
vide stress-free mounting. 
All magnetic materials are magnetostrictive. Under pulse or AC excitation 
they will change their dimensions very slightly. This can generate noise if the 
core is acoustically coupled to an acoustic radiator such as a chassis. 
Silicones, polysulfides, and similar soft, flexible materials can provide 
acoustic isolation. 
A molded or impregnated coil has a coefficient of thermal expansion 
which differs greatly from that of core materials. It may be desirable for 
some or all of the above reasons to isolate the coil from the core while pro-
viding some means of mechanical attachment of coil to core so the coil does 
not rattle around on the core. The previously mentioned materials can per-
form this function. These are the primary reasons for designing a stress-free 
processing procedure. 
Molding or impregnating the coil separately from the core is practical for 
most split-core designs and offers several advantages. Not only does it allow 
compensation for the differential coefficient of expansion, but it provides 
acoustic isolation between coil and core. It is not only chassis contact that 
will cause acoustic noise from a magnetostrictive core, but contact with any-
thing hard. Separate processing also allows finishing operations to be done 
on the coil that might be impractical or inconvenient if the core were present. 
If the design is tight or marginal there may be a significant percentage of 
electrical rejects. If these can be culled out before the core is made a perma-
nent part of the unit the cost of a reject is reduced. This can be crucial with 
expensive cores. 
Various mounting means are available which reduce, minimize, or essen-
tially eliminate stressing or coupling to the core. The unit may be potted in a 
deep drawn can such as the MIL-T -27 sizes or other, using appropriate 
materials. Potting shells may also be used. It is usually desirable to have 
something solid for a mounting plate for larger units, so molding the unit in 
an elastomer is rarely suitable unless the unit is to be mounted by adhesive 
bonding. Any significant amount of heat generated by the transformer or in-
ductor may cause problems. Elastomers have notoriously poor thermal con-
ductivity. Beryllia-filled silicone rubber is expensive, besides having a ther-
mal conductivity which varies with temperature. Heat causes the rubber to 
expand, moving the beryllia grains apart and lowering the thermal conduc-
tivity. 
For commercial designs it may be advantageous to use a bobbin with 
printed circuit pins molded in. 

MATERIALS AND FABRICATION METHODS 
219 
The core would usually be a stack of laminations, as bobbins are available 
to fit standard lamination sizes. A custom C-core with the same dimensions 
as a lamination stack could of course be specified if magnetic properties not 
available in laminations were required. The core would be assembled on the 
(wound and impregnated) bobbin, and could be secured with a wrap of ther-
mosetting tape to hold the laminations or core halves together. A bit of 3M 
#221 dribbled in between core and coil might be desirable, or a channel frame 
could be slipped over the lamination stack and held in place with polysulfide 
rubber in lieu of mechanical crimping. 
A channel frame can be mechanically crimped over a stack of nickel 
laminations without damage if a piece of 25 mil Copaco is used as a cushion 
between the lamination stack and the crimp ears of the channel frame. Do 
not crimp harder than necessary to bend the ears over or excessive strain can 
still be put on the core and lower the permeability. 
While means have been shown for isolating magnetostrictive cores andre-
ducing acoustic noise, bear in mind that all these methods offer only a 
relative degree of attenuation. Nothing has infinite attenuation. In some ap-
plications one may have the option of either a tape-wound or ferrite core 
design. Ferrites have much less magnetostriction than tape-wound cores, 
and will generate much less acoustic noise with little or moderate acoustic 
isolation. Ferrite cores are also among the least expensive. 

AFTERWORD 
This is the end of this book, but not the end of the subject. Many variations 
of these fabrication techniques exist, and many more can be created. The 
foregoing were the basics. From these one can cre<!te or evolve as many 
unique design implementations as there are specific design requirements. 
New mathematical techniques are constantly being developed, the most 
notable among recent ones perhaps being a mathematical description of core 
loss by James Triner. If core manufacturers were to specify their materials 
with the same mathematical parameters which Mr. Triner suggests, a unified 
power transformer design algorithm could be set forth in general terms. 
There is much material which was not covered in this volume because of 
the limited amount of personal time available for this work and an editor 
who would not tolerate a manuscript more than two years late. Wideband 
low level communications transformers and high frequency power trans-
formers are worthy of a chapter each, although much pertinent data for the 
latter is to be found in the chapter on pulse transformers (Chapter 6). 
There are far more uses or potential uses for nonlinear magiletic com-
ponents than the few mentioned in the chapter on nonlinear magnetics 
(Chapter 4). With the current popularity of high frequency converters many 
circuit functions may be simplified or performance advantages obtained if 
the circuit designer is aware of the basic capabilities and limitations of these 
components, and the ease with which they may be designed and fabricated. 
Take this knowledge, combine it with what you already know, and use it 
well. I wish you success.

INTRODUCTION TO 
APPENDICES A AND 8 
In the analysis for minimum copper loss (chokes and resonant charging reac-
tors), we differentiated with respect to a core dimension in order to find the 
maximum value of D 2E 2FG/ U (the smallest denormalization constant) for 
each of many overall form factors (P,Q sets). 
In the analysis for minimum total transformer loss we differentiated with 
respect to a core dimension to find the minimum of [the geometric portion of 
Eq. (2.25)], which again gives the smallest denormalization constant for each 
of many P,Q sets. 
In both analyses the plots of the magnitude of this geometric parameter 
versus P and Q show that there is a ridge of relative maxima running along 
certain P,Q values. This ridge is denoted by a dotted line in each of the P,Q 
plots. Overall form factors or relative shapes which would be preferred are 
to be found on that ridge. 
The question of how far out on that ridge one should go to pick a relatively 
more efficient design is answered by a second set of P,Q plots. For each of 
the two analyses, the magnitude of the geometric parameter per unit volume 
is plotted for the P,Q range. One sees, then, that as one moves along the 
ridge of optima this volumetric efficiency increases faster at first and then 
more slowly. Where it increases more slowly one gains less (although one still 
gains) by moving further in that direction. 
In the following pages the reader will find the copper-loss-only analysis 
(entitled "chokes and resonant charging reactors") and the combined-core-
and-copper-loss analysis (entitled "transformers"). Preceeding each case 
analysis are the two P-Q plots. They are Case I, geometric parameter; Case I, 
geometric parameter per unit volume; Case II, geometric parameter; Case II, 
geometric parameter per unit volume; and so forth. These plots have been 
223

previously presented in the text (Chapters 2 and 3 ), but are shown here in full 
for the convenience of reference. 
In general, the reader will note that for chokes and resonant charging reac-
tors the preferred form factors tend to be somewhat long, and higher than 
the width. For transformers the preferred form factors tend toward square 
shapes, with the length comparable to the height and both large compared to 
the width. In this regard it might be noted that square stacks of E-Ilamina-
tions are not too far from an optimum, while double stacks are somewhat 
further removed. 
Ferrite cores can be pressed in any shape, and it takes only the manufac-
turer's recognition that he could offer a better product for such optimized 
shapes in ferrite to become available. 
Tape-wound C-cores may today be made in almost any shape, and the 
designer will find that optimized designs can be readily fabricated using tape-
wound cores. The increasing costs of assembly labor and the higher perfor-
mance offered by special alloys or thin gauges also serve to make tape-
wound cores a preferred means of realizing these designs today.

APPENDIX C 
RECTIFIER CIRCUIT DESIGN 
Capacitor input rectifier circuits can be designed accurately and simply with 
the aid of the following graphs, known as Schade's curves. 
lkpending on whether your circuit is a half wave rectifier, a full wave 
(center tap or bridge), or a full wave doubler, refer to Fig. C-1, C-2 or C-3, 
respect ivcly. 
For some ratios of source to load resistance, select the appropriate curve. 
Form the product wCRL, and move upward to where the vertical line in-
tersects the chosen curve. Read horizontally on the left the fraction of peak 
AC voltage which the load will see (the voltage the filter capacitor charges up 
to). 
If one operates on the horizontal plateau to the right of the knee of the 
chosen curve, the output voltage will be relatively insensitive to the value of 
the capacitor, a great convenience when one is using electrolytic capacitors 
which have rather wide tolerances. 
Next, go to Fig. C-4. For the particular circuit, the chosen value of wCRL, 
read the ratio of peak to average rectifier current. 
Given the average DC output current, one can obtain the RMS (effective 
heating value) current from the expression /RMS = v /pklavgÂ· 
One can now properly specify the rectifiers. Knowing the RMS current in 
the transformer, one can compute its temperature rise. 
Now go to Fig. C-5. For the chosen value of wCR~., the circuit, and the 
Rs!RL ratio one can read the RMS ripple voltage on the capacitor as a ratio 
with the DC output voltage. If some values do not work out to an acceptable 
situation, one can choose a different value of Rsl RL or a different 
capacitance value and recalculate. 
One can also work backwards from a desired output voltage and a given 
capacitance value to the value of source resistance required, and then design 
the transformer to meet that resistance requirement.

APPENDIX C 
A large fraction of the engineers I have known were not familiar with 
Schade's curves or their use. I have induded this in formation to make it 
more available. l have also observed a very common error among circuit 
design engineers, that of ignoring the actual RMS ripple current in the filter 
capacitor. Fig. C-4 gives the RMS current in the rectifier, from whil:h one 
can calculate the RMS ripple current in the capacitor and ensure that it is be-
ing operated within the manufacturer's ratings.
